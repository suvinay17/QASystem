   MORGANTOWN, W.Va. -- Natalie Tennant raises her
muzzle-loading rifle into the air, races onto the West
Virginia University football field and pulls the trigger. The
blast jolts her, but the real kick comes next: Booing
cascades from the student cheering section in the upper deck,
and front-row fans taunt, "Go back to the kitchen] No
Mountaineer can have PMS]"
   Ms. Tennant, a 22-year-old senior, is the university's
Mountaineer mascot this year -- the first woman ever. Some
people want her to become the first to be targeted in a
recall election.

   West Virginians have revered the buckskin-clad Mountaineer
mascot of the university as the embodiment of the state's
macho frontier past. Many students and alumni are mortified
that the pride of West Virginia now uses eyeliner instead of
after-shave.
   Angry football fans have thrown paper cups and ice at Ms.
Tennant during games. Others have circulated petitions
demanding her ouster and passed out bumper stickers and
buttons that read: "We Don't Want a Mountain-dear. Give us
back our Mountaineer."
   Other places don't seem to have this problem. Harvard
hasn't even figured out what a Crimson looks like, much less
what its gender is. Nobody cares whether there's a woman
under the Princeton Tiger-skin. Notre Dame's Leprechaun has
always been male, although who would know the difference if
it wasn't?
   The difference could become an issue elsewhere, of course
-- just as it has here. Sitting in the stadium's lower deck
during the Maryland game, Jim Bartley, a Morgantown
advertising man, boos as Ms. Tennant passes by. "Should the
Florida State Seminole be a squaw?" he asks. "Should the USC
Trojan be a maid? Should the Texas Longhorn be a milk cow?
For 60 years," he adds, "we've had nothing but total support
for the Mountaineer, and now she's divided the state."
   Huffs Derek Farley, who graduated from the university two
years ago, "If finding sanctuary in a 100-year tradition is
sexist, then you can tattoo it on my chest."
   Ms. Tennant has her supporters. Stores here are selling
sweatshirts emblazoned with a striking dark-haired woman
dressed like Daniel Boone. The campus newspaper has rallied
behind Ms. Tennant with glowing editorials. Many alumni,
particularly women, call out encouragement when they see her.
"Keep it up, Natalie]" yells a woman at a pre-game tailgate
party. "I've got four daughters, and you're a pace-setter]"
   University officials have expressed dismay over Ms.
Tennant's treatment. "I thought we were more sophisticated
than this," says Gordon Thorn, the school's assistant vice
president for student affairs. "It's discouraging, and it
says we have a long way to go before we can handle this kind
of question."
   Ms. Tennant, a journalism major who was raised on a West
Virginia farm, shows a steely indifference toward her
opponents. The abuse is directed toward the idea of a female
Mountaineer, she says, not toward herself as a person. "It
keeps me humble and gives me more drive," she says of the
opposition.
   During the game, she scurries through the stands of the
60,000-seat stadium, slaps hands with fans and has her
picture taken with children. A small blond-haired boy runs up
to her, hands her a quarter and says, "Call me."
   The mascot mess began in the spring, after a student club
selected Ms. Tennant and a male aspirant as finalists in a
competition to become mascot. At a basketball game "cheer
off," thousands of students baited Ms. Tennant, raucously
informing her that she wasn't anatomically fit to be
Mountaineer. To almost everyone's surprise, the club selected
her anyway.
   The next day, the campus statue of the rifle-holding,
knife-toting Mountaineer was wearing women's underwear.
School officials later sprayed the statue with lubricant to
keep it from being painted.
   Some students and alumni want the entire, 22,000-person
student body to elect a new mascot. They say West Virginia's
mountaineer iconography is ample proof that the mascot was
never meant to wear skirts and pantyhose. Whether on the
state seal or a corporate logo, they say, the moutaineer is
almost always depicted as a virile white male.
   The university mascot not only attends athletic events and
parades but also gives speeches at high schools, 4-H Club
meetings, Bible-study classes and pig roasts.
   Many students say that about three-quarters of the student
body, including many women, don't think Ms. Tennant should be
the mascot. Some attribute this to tradition; others, sexism.
There's concern that male students will try to take her gun
at the football games.
   "Some men just hate women," says Dawn Miller, managing
editor of the Daily Athenaeum, the campus newspaper.
   Says Ms. Tennant: "I'm the first female mascot at West
Virginia University, but there were female mountaineers long
before me, like our grandmothers."
   When humans dress up as tigers, panthers or even, as at
Syracuse University, oranges, they rarely display obvious sex
characteristics. But there's never been any doubt about the
gender of the Mountaineer, who dresses in tight-fitting
buckskin with coonskin cap and moccasins. Ms. Tennant's
critics fault her for not having a beard, for being too short
(5 feet, 3 1/2 inches), and for not yelling loud enough.
Because of her size, she can't carry the state flag at games;
it would scrape the ground.
   After the Maryland game, an exhausted Ms. Tennant's
lace-trimmed suit is streaked with sweat. Her cheeks are
sunburned, her hands are smeared with gunpowder and her
pinkie finger sports a bruise from shooting the rifle.
   "You shot the gun too late]" yells a student from the
stands, sunglasses draped around his neck. He also complains
that she didn't wave the state flag and didn't come up to the
student section. He recommends that Ms. Tennant study last
year's mascot from game films.
   Yet her enthusiasm for the mascot-ship has won over some
of West Virginia's crustiest males. This past summer,
attending a pig roast in coal-mining Boone County, she was
told to avoid a 70-year-old resident called "Ol' Buster."
Instead, she marched right up to him, extended her hand and
said, "I hear you're my biggest fan."
   "The hell I am]" Buster snorted, refusing to shake it.
   But Ms. Tennant persisted. She had her rifle; and Buster
also carried a muzzle-loader. Bonded by gunpowder, the two of
them went to an abandoned field to blast away. "Buster" --
Mosie Atkins -- was won over. Today he offers her his
ultimate compliment for her tomboyish toughness. "Hell, she's
worse than a damn boy]" he says in admiration.

   The man who gave the University of Notre
Dame a sweater worn by football legend George Gipp says he is
stunned the university gave it away _ even to Ronald Reagan.
   ``Belatedly, I now regret not stipulating that the Gipp monogram
would be `on loan,''' said John N. Cackley in an opinion column in
Friday's South Bend Tribune.
   ``I never dreamed that someone at Notre Dame would go to the
extreme of satisfying egos in the White House and at the university
just to create an atmosphere of good old-fashioned `show biz,'''
said Cackley, a 1937 graduate and executive director emeritus of the
alumni association.
   University President Edward Malloy presented the blue and gold
Notre Dame sweater to Reagan when the national champion Notre Dame
football team visited the White House on Jan. 18, two days before
Reagan left office.
   Reagan played the dying Gipp in the 1940 movie ``Knute Rockne,
All-American,'' his first big break in the movies. He has used as a
political slogan Rockne's instruction to his players to ``win one
for the Gipper.''
   Cackley, of South Bend, said the 70-year-old sweater was an
``authentic, irreplaceable, one-of-a-kind'' item that had been
displayed only six months near the athletic department offices.
   ``Tradition, so often cherished at this institution, was shunted
aside with the Gipp article being handed over to the old actor for
his Notre Dame collection,'' he said.
   Charles Lennon, director of the Notre Dame Alumni Association,
said at least 15 alumni called to praise the idea.
   ``Most of our alumni would certainly understand the gift has
strong meanings for the president, as well as to the university,''
he said.
   Cackley said the dying Gipp gave the sweater to roommate Percy
Wilcox, who later passed it to another classmate, Tom Lee. Lee gave
the sweater to Cackley, who kept the sweater about five years before
giving it to Notre Dame.
   ``The sweater was not intended to be a give-away, regardless of
who might like to have it _ whether that be Ronald Reagan, Jimmy
Carter, John Paul II or anyone else,'' he said.
   University spokesman Richard Conklin referred questions to James
E. Murphy, associate vice president for university relations, who
was out of town Friday.

<TEXT>
   In one of the last public events of his eight
years in the White House, President Reagan on Wednesday paid a
sentimental tribute to the championship Notre Dame football team and
received in return a sweater once presented to _ who else? _ George
Gipp.
   Reagan, whose role as Gipp, the Notre Dame star, in ``Knute
Rockne, All-American'' gave him his first big break in the movie
career that helped propel him to the presidency, told the players:
   ``I can't help thinking that somewhere a long way off there's a
fellow with a big grin and a lot of pride in his school and he might
be thinking to himself that maybe you won another one for the
Gipper.''
   The line was a paraphrase of one spoken by Pat O`Brien as Rockne
in the movie, invoking the memory of Gipp after his death to inspire
the team to victory. It has become a political slogan Reagan has
repeated many times.
   Reagan told the players how much he values his association with
Notre Dame, which he has twice visited during his presidency.
   ``The INF Treaty and George Bush's election were important, but
having the Fighting Irish win the national championship is in a
class by itself,'' he said.
   The president of Notre Dame, the Rev. Edward Malloy, presented
Reagan with the sweater, in a glass-lidded presentation box. The
sweater had been awarded to Gipp for his performance as a halfback
on the Notre Dame team in 1917 and 1918.
   ``I think that's a great sacrifice by the university, but,
believe me, no one could treasure it more than I will,'' the
president said.
   Lou Holtz, the coach of the Fighting Irish, gave Reagan a
football from the team's 34-21 Fiesta Bowl victory over the
University of West Virginia. Reagan tossed the ball to a member of
the Notre Dame team.
   The Fiesta Bowl victory Jan. 2 gave the university its eighth
national championship _ the most in the 53-year history of the
Associated Press poll.

   The University of Notre Dame bucked the College
Football Association and became the first college to sell its home
football games to a major network by agreeing Monday to a five-year
contract with NBC beginning in 1991.
   ABC and ESPN thought they had acquired rights to Notre Dame home
games when they agreed to exclusive contracts with the CFA, which
consists of 64 schools.
   But the deal by the Fighting Irish, a member of the CFA, created
the possibility that other colleges might defect from the CFA's
package. The terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
   ABC announced Jan. 17 that it had purchased rights to the CFA
for $210 million over five years. ESPN announced Oct. 4, 1989, that
it had bought the group's cable rights for $110 million over five
years.
   ``It would be premature to speculate on how the CFA membership
may be affected,'' said David Ogrean, CFA assistant executive
director for television. ``The CFA television committee will review
the situation and consult with the membership. Both ABC and ESPN,
with whom the CFA has agreements commencing in 1991, have expressed
interest in continuing their relationship with the CFA.
   ABC said in a statement that it intends to ``pursue all remedies
available to protect its agreement with the CFA from interference
by third parties, including NBC Sports, and to ensure participation
of all CFA'' schools. ESPN declined to comment.
   In a news conference Monday in South Bend, Ind., to announce the
deal, Notre Dame said it had not given the CFA any guarantees it
would be part of the new television package.
   NBC said it was legally free to conclude a deal with the
Fighting Irish since the school had not committed to the CFA's
package.
   ``We did not interfere with an existing relationship,'' said NBC
Sports President Dick Ebersol.
   Ebersol said that, for now, NBC would not attempt to sign
contracts with other schools. However, he said NBC ``would stand by
and see what the developments are in the other schools.''
   Sam Jankovich, athletic director at the University of Miami,
said he would not rule out a similar plan for the Hurricanes, the
1989 national champions.
   The Notre Dame package will begin with a Sept. 7, 1991 visit by
Indiana. Notre Dame will play six home games a year during the
contract against 16 opponents.
   The agreement will not prohibit Notre Dame road games from being
televised by other networks or cable stations.
   Ogrean said the deal does not affect Notre Dame's status in the
CFA.
   ``The involvement with the television package is separate from
being involved with the CFA,'' said Notre Dame executive vice
president E. William Beauchamp.
   University athletic director Dick Rosenthal said he had had
problems with ABC's plan to show many games on a regional basis
when its new deal begins in 1991. ``It would almost be better for
us not be on than to be on in only part of the country,'' he said.

   Knute Rockne, the Notre Dame football
coach being honored this week by his government, was a raw-boned
Norwegian immigrant whose locker-room orations inspired the
Fighting Irish to three national championships and indirectly
helped make Ronald Reagan a star.
   A master at motivating his players with such pleas as ``Win one
for the Gipper,'' Rockne was killed on March 31, 1931, in an
airplane crash that stunned the nation. He remains a giant figure
in the school's _ and the country's _ football legend.
   Reagan, who played the Gipper in a 1940 movie, was going to
Notre Dame today for the issuance of a commemorative postage stamp
in Rockne's honor. The 22-cent stamp is the sixth in a sports
series that also includes Bobby Jones, Babe Zaharias, Babe Ruth,
Roberto Clemente and Jim Thorpe.
   Rockne was born in Voss, Norway, in 1888, came to the United
States with his parents in 1893 and grew up in the Logan Square
district of Chicago. After high school, he worked as a mail
dispatcher for four years to save enough money to attend Notre Dame.
   He lettered in track, was a semi-pro boxer, wrote for the
student newspaper and yearbook, played flute in the orchestra and
paid his way by working as a janitor and as a chemistry research
assistant.
   As a football player, Rockne was credited with making the
forward pass a legitimate offensive weapon, although he was a
receiver for quarterback Gus Dorais. The pass first gained
widespread notice in the 1913 Notre Dame-Army game at West Point,
and the series became one of college football's greatest
intersectional rivalries.
   As coach, a post he assumed in 1918, Rockne made the Fighting
Irish a standard for college football in an increasingly
sports-hungry nation.
   ``We heard about Red Grange and Illinois, of course. But the
idea of a team with a real national reputation was almost unheard
of when I was a young man,'' said Hugh Devore, who served as Irish
head coach in 1948 and in 1963. ``But Rockne changed that because
he would go anywhere to play anyone.''
   It was in 1924 that the most famous backfield in college
football history _ Elmer Layden, Don Miller, Harry Stuhldreher and
Jim Crowley, better known as the Four Horsemen _ gained recognition
in a 13-7 victory over Army.
   The 1928 meeting was the game immortalized in ``Knute Rockne _
All American,'' starring Pat O'Brien and the young Reagan.
   As the story goes, Notre Dame trailed 6-0 at halftime. Then
Rockne inspired the Irish by recounting a deathbed scene eight
years earlier in which All-American George Gipp, stricken with
strep throat, told his coach:
   ``I've got to go, Rock. It's all right. I'm not afraid. Some
time, Rock, when the team is up against it, when things are wrong
and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go in there with
all they've got and win just one for the Gipper.
   ``I don't know where I'll be then, Rock. But I'll know about it,
and I'll be happy.''
   The fired-up Irish came back with two touchdowns in the second
half and won 12-6.
   As to whether the Gipper deathbed story is true, former athletic
director Edward ``Moose`` Krause says, ``I wasn't there, but I've
talked to guys who were ... They swear it happened just like in the
movies.''
   The Irish were undefeated the next two seaons. Then an era came
to an end when a plane carrying the 43-year-old Rockne to
California to make a football demonstration movie flew into a
storm, became covered with ice and fell into a wheat field near
Bazaar, Kan. Seven other people also died.
   ``You would have thought the world had come to an end,''
recalled Krause, then a freshman.
   Rockne's funeral Mass on the Notre Dame campus was broadcast
across the country.
   ``Everybody looked on Rockne as a God. I was in awe of him,''
said Krause, who was athletic director for 32 years until his
retirement in 1981 and will be part of Wednesday's program at the
university's Athletic and Convocation Center.
   During his 13 years as Notre Dame's coach, Rockne won 105 games,
lost 12 and tied five for an .897 percentage. He also also served
as athletic director, business manager, ticket distributor, track
coach and equipment manager, wrote a newspaper column once a week
and was the principal designer of the current Notre Dame Stadium.
   He and his wife, Bonnie, had four children. A daughter, Mrs.
Anthony Kochendorfer of Tulsa, Okla., is expected to be at Notre
Dame for the ceremony.
   Besides Gipp and the Four Horsemen, other All-Americans who
played for Rockne included Roger Kiley, Johnny Mohardt, Harvey
Brown, Art Boeringer, John Smith, Frank Carideo, Jack Cannon, Joe
Savoli, Bert Metzger, Tom Conley and Marchy Schwartz.

News item: "South Bend, Ind. -- Football Coach Lou Holtz today apologized to
the University of Southern California's football team for a pregame brawl that
erupted in the stadium tunnel before Saturday's USC-Notre Dame on the Irish's
home field.
</P>
<P>
"We take full responsibility for that thing occurring," the coach said in
urging a written apology from his team. "We were completely out of line."
</P>
<P>
 You can bet the Notre Dame coach is quick with an apology.
</P>
<P>
It is, of course, easy to be magnanimous in victory. But, the issue goes deeper
than that.
</P>
<P>
You would never think it to look at them, their image in films and television
and story books and the rich lore of collegiate football being what it is, but
the Fighting Irish often skirt the thin line between ostracism and adulation.
</P>
<P>
Their crime is evident: They win too much.
</P>
<P>
If you think this sits well with their victims, you don't know college
football.
</P>
<P>
You see, you don't have to play Notre Dame. The Irish don't belong to your
conference. They don't belong to any conference. You don't have to get through
them to get to a bowl game.
</P>
<P>
They are the bully boys of the Midwest. They annually have 80 or 90 of the best
football players on the planet in their gold and blue (or, sometimes, Kelly
green). They are the darlings of the subway alumni and the Cadillac Catholics
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
Other sectors of the population are able to restrain their enthusiasm. In fact,
the powers that be in the church have pretty much de-emphasized football at
other major Catholic schools -- Fordham, the Loyolas, Holy Cross -- at least
partly because their success tended to exacerbate anti-Catholic sentiment,
polarize prejudice.
</P>
<P>
It was all very well for Notre Dame to reign supreme when the Irish had Knute
Rockne, the Four Horsemen, Hollywood films with Ronald Reagan playing the
Gipper. They were part of the era of wonderful nonsense. Schoolboys hummed the
fight song. Outlined against a blue-gray sky was the original America's team.
</P>
<P>
Rockne was a publicly jovial showman and salesman, a canny old Norwegian who
looked a little like Santa Claus and had an almost Churchillian wit and charm.
It was darn near a pleasure to lose to Rockne.
</P>
<P>
His successors were something else again. Fortunately, Hunk Anderson and Elmer
Layden didn't win too much. Sometimes, not at all.
</P>
<P>
But then along came Leahy -- and all the latent anti-Notre Dame sentiment
surfaced. He gave it an excuse.
</P>
<P>
Frank Leahy was no Rockne. He didn't charm anybody, he just beat them. Teams
began dropping off the schedule like rats leaving a burning building. The
storied Army series, the games that gave the country the legend of the Four
Horsemen, the rivalry that filled Yankee Stadium and Soldier Field, was
unceremoniously ended after 34 years. Michigan gave Notre Dame a wide berth.
Woody Hayes at Ohio State wouldn't be caught dead -- or alive -- playing Notre
Dame.
</P>
<P>
There was a very real fear that Notre Dame would become the pariah of
intercollegiate football. So they fired Leahy as a sop to those who contended
that it was not the college that ticked them off but the coach. They even
de-emphasized football, which was a mistake for Notre Dame. Their varsity began
to look less like next year's Chicago Bears than this year's California Bears.
</P>
<P>
I remember going to USC Coach Jeff Cravath in the critical period before Notre
Dame dumped Leahy. The concern in South Bend was that they would lose Southern
Cal, as the West Coast school was always identified in Hoosierland, and this
would be a catastrophic public relations blow for the school that Rockne built.
</P>
<P>
Cravath acknowledged that his colleagues were jumping off Notre Dame's schedule
and trying to talk him into joining them. SC would not join the parade, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"You can't be the best if you don't play the best," Cravath told me.
</P>
<P>
If you don't think Notre Dame was relieved, you underestimate the value they
put on their Southern California connection, with its proximity to show
business, sound stages, networks and swimming pool alumni.
</P>
<P>
Ara Parseghian won just enough to keep the alumni happy -- and lost enough not
to make the competition unhappy.
</P>
<P>
Now, it's Lou Holtz's turn. He has Rockne's jokes -- but Leahy's teams. So,
it's back to the tightrope.
</P>
<P>
It's all very well to get in a pregame donnybrook with, say, the University of
Miami. Notre Dame prizes the series but Miami's image, rightly or wrongly, is
that of a bunch of thugs in pads. Harvard, it ain't.
</P>
<P>
Southern California is something else again. Lou Holtz knows it. Notre Dame
knows it. Ugly brawls between the two squads do not serve the image of the
rivalry. Taunting does not serve Notre Dame's image. Too many people worked too
many years to make the Irish-Trojan game what it has become, an American
institution, to see it dissolved by a hoodlum rumble.
</P>
<P>
An apology is a nice start. A cleanup of their act would be more to the point.
Notre Dame has beaten up SC seven times in a row now. It would seem that the
Irish could wait till the kickoff. Or, Holtz is afraid, they won't have SC to
kick around anymore.

GERRY FAUST FINDS SERENITY AT AKRON;
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: FIVE YEARS AFTER HIS DISAPPOINTING TENURE AT NOTRE DAME, THE
COACH DISCOVERS THAT THE CROWDS ARE SMALLER, BUT THE REWARDS ARE GREATER, WITH
THE DIVISION I-A ZIPS.

<TEXT>
<P>
At Moeller High School in Cincinnati, Coach Gerry Faust and his players drew
thousands of people to home games to watch the nation's most dominant prep
football team play. Later, when Faust was at Notre Dame, a stadium crowd of at
least 59,000 was guaranteed -- regardless of the opponent.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays Faust is lucky if he can get one-third of the seats filled at the
Rubber Bowl, home to his University of Akron Zips. Although Faust probably
couldn't fill the stadium's 35,000 seats if he gave tickets away, he finally is
finding serenity as a college football coach.
</P>
<P>
"I have a great group of kids with a super attitude," said Faust, who takes his
Zips (3-2-1) to Annapolis, Md., on Saturday to face the Naval Academy (2-3).
"I'm really enjoying myself now."
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere surrounding Faust, in his fifth year at Akron, has not always
been pleasant. When he left Moeller after the 1980 season to coach Notre Dame,
Faust was supposed to carry the winning tradition to South Bend, Ind.
</P>
<P>
But by the time he resigned after five years, Faust had the most losses of any
football coach in school history, with a 30-26-1 record. After the Irish lost,
58-7, to Miami in his last game there, a Sports Illustrated article described
Faust as the man who left "Notre Dame's football program . . . in shambles."
</P>
<P>
"You don't like to read or hear the things you hear about the coaching, but you
have to learn to accept that," Faust said of the media attacks. "I wanted to
win. Not because people were upset. I wanted to do it because I believed in the
university and what it stood for."
</P>
<P>
What Notre Dame followers could not accept were the two 5-6 seasons under
Faust. In that time Notre Dame lost four straight times to Air Force -- its
only losses to a service academy since dropping a game to Navy in 1963.
</P>
<P>
Despite his lack of success at Notre Dame, Faust received nine job offers after
he left. He settled on Akron, a Division I-AA school that was looking for a
well-known coach to engineer its transition to Division I-A.
</P>
<P>
"I looked forward to the challenge," he said. "After taking the job at Notre
Dame, I realized I had a lot to learn. Looking back, I wasn't ready. I know how
to deal with college kids now. Ten years ago, I didn't."
</P>
<P>
The Zips -- Zippy the kangaroo is the mascot -- are 25-23-2 under Faust. Last
year, in just its third year of I-A ball, Akron had a 6-4-1 record after two
losing seasons.
</P>
<P>
"We're doing better than we thought we would be doing. We have a long way to
go, but we're pleased with the progress we've made," Faust said. "We eventually
would like to get to the level of the Naval Academy, Syracuse, West Point and
Boston College. The transition to I-A has been really tough."
</P>
<P>
After coaching at an institution that pretty much sold itself, Faust has had to
become a salesman to attract players.
</P>
<P>
"We made great strides over the last couple of years, and the enthusiasm is a
lot better in the community," he said. "You have to really work hard to get
kids here, and I'm always out recruiting. But the work is paying off. Our kids
have a great belief in each other."

ST. FRANCIS GRADUATE ADDS GLITTER TO IRISH DIAMOND
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ed Lund is surrounded by tradition at Notre Dame where there are almost as many
legends as trees.
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame is Knute Rockne, the Four Horsemen and Win One for the Gipper.
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame is Frank Leahy, Ara Parseghian and Lou Holtz.
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame is national championships -- football championships.
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame, therefore, is not the place baseball players reared in Southern
California continue their careers. At least it wasn't when Lund graduated from
St. Francis High in 1986 and took off for South Bend, Ind.
</P>
<P>
You want Notre Dame baseball tradition? The Fighting Irish made it to the NCAA
tournament five years in a row from 1956-60. End of story.
</P>
<P>
Lund, however, has been part of a transformation that is allowing Notre Dame
baseball players to not only bask beneath the Golden Dome but also in the Top
30.
</P>
<P>
Lund, a 6-2, 200-pound catcher from Pasadena, is batting .280 with three home
runs and 24 runs batted in for the Fighting Irish, who are ranked 27th in the
poll produced by Collegiate Baseball magazine.
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the student who said he visited Notre Dame when he was a junior in
high school because "I grew up in a Catholic family and was always hearing
about Notre Dame" is getting the education he always wanted and attention from
professional baseball scouts that he yearned for almost as much.
</P>
<P>
"If you were to tell me when I was a freshman that I would be at this point, I
would have never believed you," Lund said. "It's been a big turnaround."
</P>
<P>
Most of the credit for the revitalization of the program has gone to Coach Pat
Murphy, 30, a lifelong Fighting Irish fanatic.
</P>
<P>
Murphy took the job last year after two successful seasons at Claremont
College, where he led his team to its first Southern California Intercollegiate
Athletic Conference title in 11 years, and coaching the national team from the
Netherlands to the European championship in 1987.
</P>
<P>
"His energy has no bounds," USC Coach Mike Gillespie said of Murphy.
</P>
<P>
Last season, with a nucleus of players that went 15-29 during Lund's freshman
season, the Fighting Irish finished 39-22.
</P>
<P>
"In our first team meeting, he (Murphy) was very intense, very straightforward
and very honest about the way the program was going to be run and how things
were going to be done his way," Lund said. "You could tell right away that he
didn't want to be our buddy or our friend. He wanted to be our coach to help us
win and become better baseball players."
</P>
<P>
An All-Del Rey League outfielder at St. Francis, where he batted .360 in his
senior year, Lund has blossomed as a catcher -- a position he was unable to
play in high school because of the presence of teammate Sam Vranjes, now the
starting catcher for USC.
</P>
<P>
Lund and Vranjes may meet when the Fighting Irish and Trojans clash in a
two-game series scheduled for next fall in South Bend -- a few days before the
schools' football teams play.
</P>
<P>
Murphy arranged a similar series with Miami last fall.
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame swept the series and beat the 14th-ranked Hurricanes again in March
during a spring trip to Florida. The Irish have also defeated 10th-ranked Texas
this season.
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to see some recognition and it's nice to see the hard work paying
off," said Lund, who is majoring in finance. "But we can't dwell on that
because we have a long way to go."

NOTRE DAME FOOTBALL PLAYERS DENY REPORT OF RAMPANT STEROID ABUSE

<P>
Notre Dame football players closed ranks behind their boss Wednesday, defending
Coach Lou Holtz -- and themselves -- from published charges that Holtz
tolerated widespread steroid abuse.
</P>
<P>
"I know the guys on this team don't use steroids, and that's all there is to
it," co-captain Todd Lyght said.
</P>
<P>
Chris Zorich, a senior nose tackle who bench-presses 500 pounds, said former
Notre Dame player Steve Huffman has a "chip on his shoulder."
</P>
<P>
Huffman wrote a first-person account for Sports Illustrated in which he claims
steroid use was rampant among Notre Dame players. He claimed Holtz must have
known and implied the coach tolerated the situation.
</P>
<P>
Holtz and other university officials denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
But Notre Dame revealed Wednesday that five players have tested positive for
steroids since 1987 among 466 tests conducted by the university.
</P>
<P>
The players were disciplined, although athletic director Richard Rosenthal
refused to say whether they were thrown off the team or expelled from school.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, several players say they have never witnessed scenes described by
Huffman of dozens of steroid bottles and hypodermic needles littering dormitory
rooms.
</P>
<P>
The players also rejected Huffman's claim that Holtz forced athletes to
practice and play through painful injuries. "Yesterday I was injured and I took
myself out of practice, and Coach Holtz didn't seem to have any problem with
that," Lyght said.

FATHER EDWARD SORIN CAME FROM FRANCE;
</P>
<P>
THE MAN WHO FOUNDED NOTRE DAME
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES HILLINGER, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SOUTH BEND, Ind.
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the center of the campus of the best-known Catholic university in America is
a larger-than-life statue of a man with a white beard that flows to his waist.
</P>
<P>
The man is Edward F. Sorin, a Catholic priest who came to America from France
in 1841. A year later, at age 28 and a bankroll of $300, Father Sorin founded
the University of Notre Dame du Lac (Our Lady of the Lake).
</P>
<P>
Sorin dedicated the university to the Blessed Virgin Mary and vowed: "When this
school, Our Lady's school, grows a bit more, I shall raise her aloft, so that,
without asking, all men shall know why we succeeded here.
</P>
<P>
"To that lovely lady, raised high on a dome, a golden dome, men may look and
find the answer."
</P>
<P>
Ever since 1888, when Sorin's huge golden dome was erected on top of the
school's administration building, students here have been known as the "Golden
Domers" or simply "Domers."
</P>
<P>
Crowned by a 19-foot-high, gold-leaf statue of Notre Dame, the Golden Dome is
part of Sorin's legacy. And recently releafed, the Dome appears more lustrous
than ever.
</P>
<P>
Sorin served as Notre Dame's president until 1865. Then he became
superior-general of the Congregation of Holy Cross priests who teach and
administer the school. He was also chairman of the university's board of
trustees and played a key role in Notre Dame's leadership until his death in
1893.
</P>
<P>
His imprint is everywhere on the 12,500-acre campus, including Sorin Hall, the
school's oldest dormitory. He started the school band, one of the oldest
university bands in the country.
</P>
<P>
In the 1850s, all locales with a Post Office appeared on official government
maps. To make sure his school was on the maps, Sorin applied for -- and was
granted -- a Post Office in 1851. Sorin was the first postmaster and Notre Dame
has had a Post Office ever since.
</P>
<P>
President Reagan officially unveiled the Knute Rockne commemorative stamp at
the Notre Dame Post Office on March 9, 1988 -- the first U.S. stamp ever to
honor an athletic coach.
</P>
<P>
Because he played "The Gipper" in the Warner Bros. 1940 movie "Knute Rockne --
All-American," the former President considered himself an honorary alumni. He
delivered the commencement address here in 1981, when he and Pat O'Brien, who
played Rockne in the film, were given honorary degrees.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rockne Died in Plane Crash
</P>
<P>
Rockne, a chemistry professor, was head football coach at Notre Dame from 1918
until he was killed in a 1931 airplane crash at 43. His teams won 105 games,
lost 12, tied five. Five Rockne teams went undefeated, six lost one game, two
were national champions. His lifetime winning percentage of .881 ranks at the
top of the list for college and pro football coaches.
</P>
<P>
Though the game put Notre Dame on the map, there is more to the campus than
football. On a wall in school publicist Dennis Moore's office, and in many
places on campus, is a photograph of a football and this message underneath:
"If this is all you know about Notre Dame, you have a lot to learn."
</P>
<P>
Ranked 18th academically among America's 204 national universities in a recent
U.S. News and World Report survey, Notre Dame attracts more than $20 million a
year in research funding, primarily in science and engineering. It is a
significant figure given that university has neither a medical complex or
agricultural school.
</P>
<P>
The aerodynamics of glider flight and transmission of wireless messages were
pioneered at Notre Dame. Formulas for synthetic rubber were discovered here.
The university is a world leader in radiation chemistry and gerontological
research. Notre Dame Press is the largest Catholic university press in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Located next to the Golden Domed Administration Building and also completed in
1888 is the French Gothic church Sacred Heart. Designed by Sorin and Brother
Charles Harding, Sacred Heart is patterned after the main church in Sorin's
hometown, Aluille, France.
</P>
<P>
Sorin maintained close ties with France and the Vatican, making 52
transatlantic crossings in his lifetime. In 1874, during a visit to Rome, he
convinced Pope Pius IX to grant Vatican artist-in-residence Luigi Gregori a
two-year leave to go to Notre Dame. Gregori stayed 17 years, becoming Notre
Dame's artist-in-residence.
</P>
<P>
He did all the church's frescoes as well as a series of 12 paintings in the
Administration Building depicting scenes from the life of Christopher Columbus.
Each is 11 feet high and 5 1/2 to 9 feet wide.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 92% of the students were Catholics. Co-ed since 1972, today women
compose one-third of the student body and minorities account for 13%. Students
come from all 50 states, and 60 countries. The 1988-89 enrollment totaled 7,500
undergraduates, 1,300 in the graduate program and 850 in law school.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Once Had Own Mortuary
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame had an agriculture school until 1932, when both the school and the
campus farm were discontinued. For years, the university was self-sufficient in
many ways. It even had its own mortuary and hearse to handle burials in the
school cemetery.
</P>
<P>
The 14-story Theodore M. Hesburgh Library is the largest collegiate library
building in the world. Hesburgh, 72, the university's 15th president, retired
two years ago after 35 years on the job.
</P>
<P>
Hesburgh was also an international leader. President Eisenhower appointed him
to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission in 1957; President Reagan sent him to El
Salvador to oversee the elections in 1982. And Pope Pius XII sent him to Vienna
in 1956 to represent the Vatican at the International Atomic Energy Agency.

Hesburgh's successor, the Rev. Edward "Monk" Malloy, 47, like all previous
presidents of the school, is a member of the Congregation of Holy Cross. There
are 405 priests in the religious order, most connected with Notre Dame. The
president of the school is always selected from the ranks.
</P>
<P>
Malloy, who played basketball for Notre Dame on an athletic scholarship, has
been a professor since 1974. He lives austerely in students' quarters in
century-old Sorin Hall. He likes to tell the story of his first few months as a
student at Notre Dame:
</P>
<P>
"I flunked math and engineering drawing my first semester. I was .1% from
flunking out of the university. I went on to become president of the school I
almost flunked out of. So, there is hope. . . ."

<LEADPARA>  By the end of a bizarre week, even by the standards that life in a fishbowl
creates for football players at Notre Dame, there were smiles and a sense of
relief that public-intoxication and disorderly-conduct charges had been
dropped against quarterback Rick Mirer and linebacker Demetrius DuBose.;   But
the Fighting Irish continue to respond to a number of unplanned personnel
losses as they begin their season against Indiana today at Notre Dame Stadium.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Notre Dame's adjustment to the departure of Raghib Ismail after his junior
season, for the riches of the Canadian Football League, has become the
most-discussed aspect of its preparation.;   Another loss is George Williams,
the 6-foot-2, 300-pound tackle who would have been the only returning starter
in the defensive line.;   Williams, who is two courses away from a degree in
American studies, is not with the team as a result of what university
officials have described only as personal reasons.;   Dick Rosenthal, the
athletic director, said it was his understanding that Williams had said he did
not want to play so that he could concentrate on his studies.;   Williams, who
missed the 1989 season because of academic difficulty, has not spoken publicly
about his status and could not be reached. But his mother, Ellen Williams,
said Notre Dame had determined her son would not play because of a violation
of university policy.;   Williams' mother said she thought her son had been
treated fairly because the policy, which she preferred not to specify, had
been made clear. Speaking by phone from her home in Willingboro, N.J., she
said the violation had not been academic in nature and was relatively minor.;
 "If he had been anywhere else but Notre Dame, he would have been able to
play," she said.  </TEXT>

   President Reagan has invited the Notre Dame
University football team, the Fighting Irish, to visit the White
House on Jan. 18, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater announced
today.
   Notre Dame won the national championship Jan. 2 by defeating West
Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl.
   In one of Reagan's notable movie roles, he played George Gipp,
legendary Notre Dame football player, in ``Knute Rockne _ All

QUINN SUES NOTRE DAME AFTER HE IS DISMISSED

<P>
A Notre Dame senior and former football player has gone to court to fight his
dismissal from the university after a woman alleged he attempted to rape her,
according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
Daniel M. Quinn, 21, of Encinitas, Calif., has sued Notre Dame for breach of
contract. He filed a second suit Tuesday against the woman, a student at Saint
Mary's College in South Bend, alleging slander.
</P>
<P>
St. Joseph Circuit Court Judge Terry A. Crone denied Quinn's request Friday for
a preliminary injunction to block his dismissal.
</P>
<P>
Patrick C. Doran, the university's assistant director for residence halls,
ordered Quinn to leave his dormitory room and the campus by 5 p.m. last Friday,
court documents show.
</P>
<P>
Quinn was recruited by former coach Gerry Faust and was a reserve outside
linebacker during the 1985 and 1986 seasons.
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame sports information director John Heisler said Quinn was suspended
from the university last spring for an undisclosed reason and was not permitted
to return last fall. Quinn was permitted to re-enroll in January but was not on
athletic scholarship, he said.
</P>
<P>
In his suit against the female student, Quinn alleged the woman made untrue,
slanderous claims when she told officials he attempted to have sex against her
will and that he beat her and confined her, court documents show. No criminal
charges have been filed.
</P>
<P>
In the suit against Notre Dame, Quinn alleged breach of contract in that the
university failed to allow him to complete his degree after signing him to an
athletic scholarship. He asks the court to order Notre Dame to permit him to
return and finish school.

NOTRE DAME'S DEAL SHOULDN'T BE A SHOCK
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Indignation is doing a brisk business these days as the country's big-time
athletic directors line up to criticize Notre Dame's decision to become a free
agent and sell its 1991-95 home football games to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
Monday, the university signed a five-year deal with NBC worth about $40
million.
</P>
<P>
The landmark agreement leaves the College Football Assn. without its No. 1
draw, the box-office equivalent of "Casablanca" without Bogart. It also exposes
how frail the union of 64 -- oops, 63 -- CFA member institutions can be when
millions of dollars and precious television exposure are at stake.
</P>
<P>
The CFA finds its own five-year, $320-million combined deal with ABC and ESPN
in jeopardy as the networks ponder the alternatives, which are few. They can
pursue legal action against the renegade Fighting Irish or renegotiate their
contracts with the Notre Dame-less -- and thus less attractive -- CFA.
</P>
<P>
Look for renegotiation and continued Notre Dame-bashing from the CFA's more
vocal members.
</P>
<P>
"I call it greed," said Rudy Davalos, Houston's athletic director.
</P>
<P>
Added Georgia's Vince Dooley: ". . . Ultimate greed."
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame would prefer to call it the ultimate business opportunity, a chance
to add money to its endowment and further improve its visibility. Armed with
the Notre Dame mystique, university administrators simply took advantage of the
market demand, albeit clumsily.
</P>
<P>
"There's not another school in the country that could have done it," one
network official said. "There are some who think they could, but they can't. If
they sat back and looked at it, they'd realize it."
</P>
<P>
The evidence:
</P>
<P>
 -- Only three college football games received double-digit ratings last
season, and each involved Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
 -- A look at the ratings of ABC's or CBS' top four college football games in
1989 shows that Notre Dame played in each.
</P>
<P>
"Now, if that doesn't tell me something, nothing will," the network official
said.
</P>
<P>
In short, NBC, in need of sports programming, purchased the most viable college
product available. If there were a Q rating -- TV's recognition factor -- for
college football, Notre Dame would win easily.
</P>
<P>
According to Dick Rosenthal, Notre Dame's athletic director, the university
will apologize for nothing. Greed wasn't the issue as much as exposure, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the CFA's new agreement with the networks, Notre Dame's
visibility could have been compromised by a viewing schedule that emphasized
regional games. The fear among school officials was that the Fighting Irish
would get heavy play in the Midwest but perhaps few appearances on the West or
East coasts. For a private, independent school that considers itself a national
institution, such possible constraints were considered unsatisfactory and,
ultimately, unacceptable. Financial contributions would be threatened, a no-no
at any university, Rosenthal argued.
</P>
<P>
"That's what motivated us to act," Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame played 13 games last season, 12 of which appeared in one form or
another on national television. By signing with NBC, the school guarantees
itself at least six national appearances a season with more to come when ABC,
ESPN and the CFA rework their arrangement. After all, what network wouldn't
want to broadcast Notre Dame's 1991 road schedule, which includes Michigan, Air
Force and Penn State? The next year, the Fighting Irish visit Michigan State,
Pittsburgh and USC, among others.
</P>
<P>
While it is difficult to argue with Notre Dame's logic, it is easier to argue
with its methods.
</P>
<P>
CFA members are outraged over what they consider a form of treason by one of
their own, and, in a small way, they have a point.
</P>
<P>
While it is clear that Rosenthal never committed to the CFA television package,
it is unclear why so many CFA members and officials, including CFA Executive
Director Chuck Neinas, were so shocked by Notre Dame's announcement. Rosenthal
never signed a contract sent to him by the CFA that would have given the
school's consent to the ABC/ESPN deal. But it remains to be seen if Rosenthal
expressed Notre Dame's dissatisfaction to the CFA before the school negotiated
its own arrangement with NBC. If he didn't, CFA members have a reason to feel
misled.
</P>
<P>
Said Rosenthal: "We clearly haven't done anything wrong. We have the rights to
our games. We were volunteer members of the CFA."
</P>
<P>
Big Eight Commissioner Carl James has questioned the role of Father William
Beauchamp, the Notre Dame executive vice president who was involved with the
CFA's television negotiating committee. Without accusing Beauchamp or Notre
Dame of conflict of interest, James made it clear that the school's
participation in the negotiations was ironic, considering the school's decision
to essentially secede from the CFA.
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal said Beauchamp "acted very responsibly. His role was to try to aid in
bringing what was the best television contract to the membership of the CFA."
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal also said that most of the money earned from the NBC deal -- $30
million for the 30 home games, about another $10 million in "additional rights
fees," said a source familiar with the negotiations -- will go to the school's
student-aid endowment, not the athletic department. Also, the revenue of $1
million a game will be shared by Notre Dame and the visiting university.
</P>
<P>
So, the CFA was caught by surprise, but in retrospect, it shouldn't have been.
It was only a matter of time before a school such as Notre Dame, which attracts
large national audiences, would strike its own deal. It happened in college
basketball, where such conferences as the Big East and the Atlantic Coast
Conference are reaping the riches of television money. It now is happening in
college football, an inevitable development.
</P>
<P>
What probably irks the remaining 63 CFA member schools the most isn't that
Notre Dame is assured of big bucks and increased viewing time, but that they
aren't part of a similar package. To this end, there are rumors of further
movement.
</P>
<P>
The University of Miami, the defending national champion, is reassessing its
position with regard to the CFA contract, said Sam Jankovich, Miami's athletic
director. Like Notre Dame, it never officially agreed to the ABC/ESPN
agreement. What is to stop Jankovich from approaching, say, CBS -- as is
rumored -- and making a deal of his own? Last season, Miami earned about $2
million in regular-season television money. Contrast that with what Notre Dame
will receive in 1991, and it's easy to understand why high-profile programs
such as Miami's are reevaluating their monetary worth.
</P>
<P>
Free agency in college football has begun, in earnest. And despite the protests
of the CFA, it will continue. Notre Dame merely took the first step on a trail
that will be traveled by many.

NOTRE DAME JUMPS SHIP, SIGNS WITH NBC
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NBC and Notre Dame announced Monday that the network will carry live, national
coverage of all home Irish football games for five years, beginning in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame thus becomes the first school in the 64-member College Football
Assn. to make a national television deal of its own.
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Dick Rosenthal said that the school plans to remain a member
of the CFA but will not be a part of the organization's television deals with
ABC and ESPN.
</P>
<P>
Father E. William Beauchamp, Notre Dame executive vice president and
secretary-treasurer of the CFA, said: "The involvement with the television
package is separate from being involved with the CFA."
</P>
<P>
Terms of NBC's deal with Notre Dame were not announced, but television
executives speculated that it is worth between $40 million and $75 million, or
roughly $10 million per year.
</P>
<P>
ABC announced Jan. 17 that it had purchased rights to the CFA for $210 million
over five years. ESPN announced in October its purchase of the group's cable
rights for $110 million over five years.
</P>
<P>
Under ABC's deal, the three USC-Notre Dame games at South Bend, Ind., during
the term of the contract would more than likely have been shown nationally. But
most of the other Notre Dame home games would have been shown regionally.
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal said he had problems with ABC's plan to show Notre Dame games only
regionally.
</P>
<P>
"It would almost be better for us not to be on than to be on in only part of
the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
ABC said in a statement: "ABC and the CFA have an agreement to televise the
home games of all 64 member institutions beginning in the 1991 season. The
agreement was reached on Jan. 16 and ratified unanimously the following day by
the CFA television committee.
</P>
<P>
"At this point, ABC Sports intends to pursue all remedies available to protect
its agreement with the CFA from interference by third parties, including NBC
Sports, and to ensure participation of all CFA-member institutions."
</P>
<P>
ESPN declined comment.
</P>
<P>
David Ogrean, the CFA's assistant executive director for television, said: "It
would be premature to speculate on how the CFA membership may be affected.
</P>
<P>
"The CFA television committee will review the situation and consult with the
membership. Both ABC and ESPN, with whom the CFA has agreements commencing in
1991, have expressed interest in continuing their relationship with the CFA."
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame said it had not given the CFA any guarantees that it would be part
of the new television package.
</P>
<P>
"In the process of negotiating new contracts, Notre Dame's position was (that)
we would not indicate our position until we had a chance to review that
contract," Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
NBC said it was legally free to conclude a deal with Notre Dame, since the
school had not committed to the CFA's package.
</P>
<P>
"We did not interfere with an existing relationship," said Dick Ebersol, the
president of NBC Sports.
</P>
<P>
Ebersol said that, for now, NBC would not attempt to sign contracts with other
schools.
</P>
<P>
"We have no intention or any basis to seek out other schools," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he added that NBC "would stand by and see what the developments are in the
other schools."
</P>
<P>
Sam Jankovich, athletic director at the University of Miami (Fla.), said he
would not rule out a similar plan for the Hurricanes, the 1989 national
champions.
</P>
<P>
"Miami did approve the latest TV agreement that was proposed by the CFA with
ABC, but we have not signed off officially on this proposal," Jankovich said.
"At this point, we're going to have to take a step back and assess (Monday's)
developments. We will have to look at how the CFA's plan might be accepted and
then determine what impact it would have on the University of Miami."
</P>
<P>
The Notre Dame package will begin Sept. 7, 1991, with a game against Indiana.
Other teams on Notre Dame's 1991 home schedule are Michigan State, Pittsburgh,
USC, Navy and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will not prohibit Notre Dame's road games from being televised by
other networks or cable outlets.
</P>
<P>
SportsChannel America, the cable network that is 50% owned by NBC, also showed
games against Rice and SMU live, and the rest of the Notre Dame schedule on
tape-delay. It is highly unlikely SportsChannel will televise any games live,
but its delayed telecasts are expected to continue.
</P>
<P>
Today, one day after ABC apparently lost Notre Dame football, the network is
expected to announce a two-year deal to televise games involving the NFL's new
spring football international venture.
</P>
<P>
The league, now dubbed the World League of American Football after two name
changes, will start play in the spring of 1991.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which is expected to pay the league $12-$15 million a year, will
start off with 12 franchises -- six in the United States, four in Europe and
one each in Mexico and Canada.
</P>
<P>
New York is the only U.S. city set, with the international sites expected to be
London, Frankfurt, Milan, Barcelona, Montreal and Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
The ABC contract is only the first step in the television arrangements for the
league, which is headed by Tex Schramm, former president of the Dallas Cowboys,
and overseen by the NFL.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan revisited the
University of Notre Dame on Wednesday and dedicated a new 22-cent
stamp in honor of Knute Rockne, telling students that the legendary
football coach's life exemplified ``the faith that makes things
happen.''
   It was Reagan's second visit as president to the Notre Dame
campus. On his earlier visit in 1981, he was reunited with Pat
O'Brien, who played the title role in the 1940 movie, ``Knute
Rockne, All-American,'' in which Reagan enjoyed one of the first
big successes of his Hollywood career.
   But Reagan first went to Notre Dame as a young sports announcer,
to broadcast a football game. Later, he returned with O'Brien and
other stars for the premiere of the Rockne film.
   Clips from the black and white picture, in which Reagan played
Notre Dame football star George Gipp, were played for the audience
in the Joyce Athletic and Convocation Center before Reagan's
arrival on Wednesday.
   The clips showed O'Brien, as Rockne, giving a pep talk to his
players at halftime of a 1928 game against Army, with the score
tied 0-0. Gipp had died eight years earlier, but the coach tells
his charges that on his deathbed the young athlete said, ``Some
time when the team is up against it and the breaks are beating the
boys, tell them to go out there with all they got and win just one
for the Gipper.''
   In fact, Army went ahead in the third quarter, 6-0, but Notre
Dame went on to win the game, 12-6. Army was on the 1-yard line
with the tying touchdown as time ran out.
   Reagan told his audience that the role of Gipp ``was a young
actor's dream'' but that playing in a film about Rockne ``was more
than that'' to him.
   ``I know that, to many of you today, Rockne is a revered name, a
symbol of greatness and, yes, a face on a postage stamp,'' he said.
   ``But my generation, well, we actually knew the legend as it
happened _ we saw it unfold. And we felt it was saying something
important about us as a people and a nation.''
   ``Most of all, the Rockne legend meant this ... that on or off
the field, it is faith that makes the difference, it is faith that
makes great things happen.''
   Rockne, a graduate of the men's college at Notre Dame, was its
head football coach from 1918 to 1931 and compiled a record of 108
victories, 12 losses and five ties. During his tenure, the
``Fighting Irish'' were undefeated in five seasons and won six
national championships.
   At the end of his speech, Reagan repeated the line from Gipp's
deathbed scene in the movie, saying, ``Win just one for the
Gipper.'' But he actully pronounced it ``Gippet,'' although few in
the crowd noticed the mistake because they already had begun their
applause.
   Afterward, Reagan was handed a football, which he hurled toward
a group of football players seated in the crowd. Heisman Trophy
winner Tim Brown caught the pigskin as the crowd roared its
approval.
   Reagan then unveiled a replica of the new postage stamp, which
shows Rockne in a jersey holding a football. As a 22-cent stamp, it
is unlikely to be widely used for long, since first-class letter
postage is due to go up to 25 cents next month.
   The ceremony ended when Reagan, a graduate of Eureka College in
Illinois and the holder of an honorary degree from Notre Dame, was
given a plaque bearing the words of the school song, ``Notre Dame,
Our Mother.'' He sang along softly as the song echoed through the
athletic center.
   In his speech, the president coupled his reminiscences about
Rockne with praise for the American economy, saying, ``There's a
will to succeed evident in our land.''
   ``It is a far different picture than the agonizing sight of a
decade ago, when many were counting out American workers and
American industry,'' he said.
   ``We were told Americans would no longer go the extra mile, no
longer had the drive to excel; that our country was in decline; and
that we, as a people, should lower our expectations.''
   ``Today, we see an America ready to compete, anxious to
compete,'' Reagan said.
   ``I predict that as this year progresses, we will see American
manufacturing re-emerge as the leading force in the world
marketplace.''
   Reagan also used the occasion to renew his claim, disputed by
some, that his administration, abetted by first lady Nancy Reagan's
``Just Say No'' campaign, is making significant inroads into drug
use among young people.
   ``We still have a long way to go, and when Nancy and I see
stories saying just that in the story, we welcome them,'' he said.
   ``But let's also remember that the shock of recognition is not a
sign of defeat, it's the beginning of victory.''
   The president tempered his customary optimism with the
observations that ``there are those who see a dark side to our
technological progress. ... It is pointed out that, regretfully, as
man has advanced into this new age, so has his capability to kill
and destroy.''
   But, he said, ``Technology is pointing toward a way out of this
dilemma'' with research on the space-based missile defense system.
The system, informally called ``Star Wars,'' is a cornerstone of
the Reagan national security policy.
   As he boarded Air Force One in South Bend for the trip back to
Washington, Reagan was carrying an autographed basketball presented
to him by Notre Dame basketball coach Digger Phelps.
   Reporters shouted at Reagan to toss the ball toward them, which
he did. NBC-TV reporter Chris Wallace caught it, lobbed a pass to a
member of the White House staff, who then presented it to Reagan.
   Reagan laughed as he reached the top platform of the stairs,
bounced the basketball once, grinned then entered the plane.
   The president arrived at Andrews Air Force Base, on the
outskirts of Washington, shortly before 4 p.m. EST and then
returned to the White House.

Everything you always wanted to know about USC, Notre Dame and the greatest
intersectional rivalry in college football:
</P>
<P>
USC graduate Shelley Prochaska and Notre Dame alumnus Don Smail will be married
Friday and then delay their honeymoon until after Saturday's game. The couple
has bought 90 Coliseum tickets for members of the wedding party and other
guests. One guess as to what Mr. and Mrs. Smail will argue about first. . . .
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame leads the series, 34-23-4. The breakdown: ND leads 18-8-1 in South
Bend and 2-0-0 in Chicago. USC leads 15-14-3 in the Coliseum. . . .
</P>
<P>
Dressing for success -- Notre Dame's colors are blue and gold, but the Irish
switched to green jerseys after the warmups in 1977 and 1983, and won easily
both times. . . .
</P>
<P>
If you want to come early, your football ticket will admit you to the
USC-Chicago State basketball game at the Sports Arena at 1:30 p.m. If you want
to stay late, you can hear the postgame concert by the USC band, which expands
its game repertoire. . . .
</P>
<P>
Raghib (Rocket) Ismail has rushed 18 times for 262 yards and two touchdowns in
fourth quarters but didn't play in the fourth quarter of Notre Dame's losses to
Stanford and Penn State. . . .
</P>
<P>
Only time both teams went into the game unbeaten and untied was in 1988 when
Notre Dame was ranked No. 1, USC No. 2, and the Trojans the favorite in the
Coliseum. The Irish won, 27-10. . . .
</P>
<P>
Four Notre Dame players list actor George Wendt of "Cheers" as the most
impressive person they've met. Wendt attended Notre Dame. On the set, they say
he talks more about football than does former Kansas State student Kirstie
Alley. . . .
</P>
<P>
USC is a private institution, was founded in 1880, has an enrollment of 29,657
and boasts Schools of Cinema-Television, Social Work, Public Administration and
International Relations that are among the oldest and most prestigious in the
country. . . .
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of Notre Dame's students are Catholic, although religion is not
considered in the admission process. Females were first admitted as
undergraduates in 1972 and make up about one-third of the student body of
7,673. Ninety-two percent of varsity athletes earn degrees. . . .
</P>
<P>
USC Athletic Director Mike McGee, the 1959 Outland Trophy winner at Duke, will
be honored during pregame ceremonies for his induction into the National
Football Foundation's College Football Hall of Fame. . . .
</P>
<P>
Most controversial call in the series might have been one in 1978 at the
Coliseum while USC was driving for the game-winning field goal. The Irish
thought Trojan quarterback Paul McDonald lost the ball on a fumble, but it was
ruled an incomplete pass. . . .
</P>
<P>
The two old rivals and the University of North Carolina have teamed up to form
the Sports Management Institute, which trains students to become college and
professional sports executives. . . .
</P>
<P>
Biggest crowd was in 1929 at Soldier Field in Chicago, an estimated 120,000,
although the official paid count was a non-record 99,351. Smallest crowd was
25,037 in 1933 in Notre Dame Stadium. . . .
</P>
<P>
Four of the first six games decided the national championship. . . .
</P>
<P>
Todd Marinovich's uncle, Trojan quarterback Craig Fertig, threw the touchdown
pass to Rod Sherman that upset the top-ranked and previously unbeaten Irish in
1964. . . .
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles attendance record for a ticker-tape parade honoring a sports
team is the 300,000 who turned out to salute USC in 1931 after its 16-14
victory over Notre Dame in South Bend. . . .
</P>
<P>
Against a Notre Dame team that led the nation in defense, USC exploded for 55
points in a span of 16 minutes 55 seconds, overcame a 24-0 deficit and won,
55-24, in 1974. However, Anthony Davis didn't score six touchdowns in that
game. He got the half-dozen in 1972 when USC won, 45-23. . . .
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame's Joe Theismann and USC's Todd Marinovich both set school records of
33 pass completions in defeats, Theismann in 1970 and Marinovich last year. . .
.
</P>
<P>
Trojan Coach Larry Smith is 1-4 against Notre Dame. He scored his only victory
in 1982 when his Arizona Wildcats won, 16-13, on a field goal by Max Zendejas
with no time remaining. . . .
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame's longest winning streak in the series is seven, beginning in 1983.
USC won five in a row from 1978-82 and was unbeaten in six games, including two
ties, from 1967-72. . . .
</P>
<P>
Subway and overseas alumni, alike, will be able to see Saturday's game that
will be televised in the United States, Japan, and 19 European countries. . . .
</P>
<P>
Heisman Trophy winners who have played in the series include Angelo Bertelli,
Johnny Lujack, Leon Hart, Johnny Lattner, Paul Hornung, John Huarte and Tim
Brown of Notre Dame, and Mike Garrett, O.J. Simpson, Charles White and Marcus
Allen of USC. . . .
</P>
<P>
Prediction: USC 27, Notre Dame 24.

GREAT AND PASSIONATE RIVALRY WILL END SATURDAY WITH MIAMI-NOTRE DAME GAME

<P>
We'll still have the Celtics-Lakers, Bears-Packers and Simpsons-Cosbys. But
another great rivalry will end Saturday when Miami plays at Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
The teams have met in 19 of the last 20 seasons, and the winner of the last
three games has gone on to the national championship. Second-ranked Miami and
sixth-ranked Notre Dame, both 4-1, are in title contention again this year.
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame officials have declined Miami's repeated requests to continue the
series, and the schools are not scheduled to play again.
</P>
<P>
"We hate to see the rivalry ending," Hurricanes Coach Dennis Erickson said.
"The last one may be the best one."
</P>
<P>
It could be a high-scoring send-off. Miami quarterback Craig Erickson will be
looking at a Notre Dame pass defense that yielded 63 points to air-minded
Stanford and Air Force the last two weeks. Miami shut out Kansas 34-0 last
Saturday, but yielded at least 21 points in its four previous games.
</P>
<P>
The series, labeled Catholics vs. Convicts by Notre Dame students, has strained
relations between the schools. Coach Jimmy Johnson was widely accused of
running up the score after Miami won 58-7 in 1985. A pregame fight between the
teams two years ago increased tension, and Notre Dame players have complained
about taunting by the Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
"I do think there has been a certain charge, a certain passion to the series,"
Notre Dame Athletic Director Dick Rosenthal said. "Perhaps a year or two off is
not without its benefits."
</P>
<P>
It's worth noting that Miami has won five of the last six meetings, outscoring
the Fighting Irish 190-61.
</P>
<P>
"Miami has a great team, and Notre Dame's history is to play great teams,"
Rosenthal said. "There's every prospect that the series will be renewed at some
time."
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame's schedule is nearly complete through 2004, Rosenthal said. An
opening recently developed in 1993 and 1994, but rather than approach Miami,
the Fighting Irish added games with Florida State, one of the Hurricanes' top
rivals.
</P>
<P>
"I wish they would've contacted us and told us they were doing it," Miami
Athletic Director Sam Jankovich said. Jankovich said he has written several
letters to Notre Dame about extending the series and received no response.
</P>
<P>
Receiver Lamar Thomas is only a sophomore but has already discovered what
Miami-Notre Dame means.
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to keep playing them every year," Thomas said. "It's a game you look
forward to. You know it's going to be on national TV. You get a chance to show
your stuff.
</P>
<P>
"But with the type of teams we have, we'll probably meet them in a bowl game
somewhere down the line."

HOLTZ DENIES KNOWING OF IRISH STEROID USE;
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: NOTRE DAME SAYS FIVE TESTED POSITIVE IN THREE YEARS, REFUTES BITTER
ALLEGATIONS BY FORMER PLAYER.

Notre Dame said today five football players have tested positive for steroid
use in the past three years, but Coach Lou Holtz denied published allegations
by a former player that steroid use was widespread and that he must have known
about it.
</P>
<P>
"I totally deny unequivocally everything that was written," Holtz said at a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
He also denied allegations in a Sports Illustrated story written by former
Irish lineman Steve Huffman that two assistant coaches suggested players use
steroids.
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Richard Rosenthal said the players who tested positive were
disciplined. He declined to identify them or to say whether any of them were
dismissed from the football program or from school.
</P>
<P>
"None of the five players who had positive tests were permitted to compete in
games while steroids were in their system," Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that printing this article with Notre Dame not absolutely having a
chance to participate or respond to the false charges is unfair, unprofessional
and journalistically irresponsible," Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
Huffman, who had two brothers who starred as linemen at Notre Dame, claimed in
this week's Sports Illustrated, that "almost half the lettermen at Notre Dame
used steroids at some time." He also said some players sold the muscle-building
drug, which is banned by the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
Huffman said he wrote the SI article because of what Holtz said about him in
his 1989 book, "The Fighting Spirit: A Championship Season at Notre Dame." In
the book, Holtz said Huffman let down his teammates by quitting the squad.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be going public with the way I feel about Holtz and his program if
he hadn't gone public about me," Huffman said.
</P>
<P>
Huffman had an injury-plagued career at Notre Dame before quitting the team
during preseason practice in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Although Huffman doesn't accuse Holtz of encouraging steroid use, he claims the
coach failed to take a strong stand against the drugs, which are known to have
dangerous side effects.
</P>
<P>
"I'm told that other players say that Holtz directly warned them not to use
steroids, but I never heard it," said the 6-foot-5, 270-pound Huffman.
</P>
<P>
"All I ever heard him say was, 'Be careful with steroids.' Whenever I was
around, that's all he ever said."

LAST DANCE WON'T BE SLOW FOR NOTRE DAME AND MIAMI

<P>
A moment of silence, please, for the rivalry that gave you fistfights and
highlights, taunts and touchdowns, cakewalks and classics.
</P>
<P>
At 12:30 p.m. today (Channel 2), sixth-ranked Notre Dame and second-ranked
Miami will conclude a relationship that blissfully began in 1955, but ends 23
games later amid veiled accusations of Irish cowardice and Hurricane thuggery.
</P>
<P>
Wave goodby to one of the few rivalries that still causes goose bumps. Storied,
tradition-dipped Notre Dame vs. the James Dean of college football, Miami. Or
as it's labeled on the hot-selling T-shirts here these days: Catholics vs. the
Convicts.
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame says it is ending the series because future Irish schedules, which
run through 2004, need more diversity. The Irish pride themselves on national
schedules, meaning there is a turnover in opponents. In this case, Miami gets
the boot after 23 games' worth of faithful service.
</P>
<P>
In its defense, Notre Dame correctly points out that other longtime opponents,
such as Michigan, will step aside in coming years for the likes of Florida
State. In essence, Notre Dame is saying the decision was nothing personal.
</P>
<P>
As you might expect, the Miami version of the story differs from the official
Notre Dame explanation. A lot.
</P>
<P>
The Hurricanes, whose schedule is set through 2000, offered to juggle or drop
opponents so the rivalry could continue uninterrupted. Notre Dame declined.
</P>
<P>
Miami tactfully mentioned the monetary benefits of such a series. After all,
the last two games between the Irish and the Hurricanes gave CBS its highest
college football rating each season. The 1987 game produced the second-highest
rating. Notre Dame shrugged.
</P>
<P>
And wouldn't a Hurricane-Irish matchup bring Notre Dame another huge payday for
those games played at the Orange Bowl? NBC owns Notre Dame's home TV rights
beginning next year, but that doesn't mean the Irish couldn't collect a hefty
paycheck for a nationally televised road game on another network.
</P>
<P>
"We have done everything possible to keep this game alive, both in the present
and future," said Sam Jankovich, Miami's athletic director. "And we would have
entertained any proposal from Notre Dame."
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame wasn't in the proposing mood. Last August, Irish Athletic Director
Dick Rosenthal told reporters that "nothing should be read into the fact that
the series is ending. It was something planned many, many years ago. There
should be no suggestion that Miami doesn't want to play Notre Dame or Notre
Dame doesn't want to play Miami."
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal also said that if an opening presented itself, Miami would be one of
the first schools the Irish called. Well, there were openings, but Notre Dame
signed Florida State and, later, West Virginia to contracts.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they even called us," said Larry Wahl, Miami's associate
athletic director.
</P>
<P>
Miami has its own reasons for the series' demise, beginning with the escalating
ill will that surrounds the game.
</P>
<P>
"They may feel it's gotten a little out of hand," Wahl said.
</P>
<P>
A little out of hand?
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the teams traded punches outside the tunnel leading to the Notre Dame
Stadium locker rooms.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the teams almost engaged in another pregame fight, but Miami and
Notre Dame coaches were able to separate the players before punches were
thrown.
</P>
<P>
"It became emotional maybe in the mid-'80s," Irish Coach Lou Holtz said earlier
this week in a teleconference. "I read where the players accused Miami of
spitting in their faces. I don't know what happened. That kind of talk fuels
emotions for the next year when they play."
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame leads the series, 14-7-1, but Miami has won five of the last six
games and six of the nine games played in the 1980s. Before that, Notre Dame
had won 10 consecutive games against the Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
If ever a rivalry caused a nation to take notice, this is the one. For the
fourth time in as many years, Miami and Notre Dame start today's game ranked in
the top 10.
</P>
<P>
One other statistic of note: In the last three seasons, the winner of this game
has gone on to win the national championship.
</P>
<P>
"It's a good rivalry," said Melvin Bratton, a former Hurricane running back
(1983-87) who plays for the Denver Broncos. "I just think they're tired of
getting beat by us."
</P>
<P>
The rivalry was doing nicely until 1985, when the fourth-ranked Hurricanes
destroyed the unranked Irish, 58-7. Miami, which was then coached by Jimmy
Johnson, was accused of running up the score.
</P>
<P>
"That kind of teed off Notre Dame fans around the whole country," Bratton said.
</P>
<P>
For the record, Bratton said the Hurricanes couldn't help running up the score,
so bad were the Irish that year.
</P>
<P>
Holtz and Miami Coach Dennis Erickson vowed that there would be no more fights.
The last game between the Irish and the Hurricanes, they said, will also be the
cleanest. Or so they say.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's going to be fine," Holtz said.
</P>
<P>
"We're going there to play a game," Erickson said in his weekly news
conference. "(Fighting is) something of the past, and you won't see it."
</P>
<P>
One other thing you won't see: a rematch.

THE BIGGEST FINGER POINTS AT LOU HOLTZ
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILBON, WASHINGTON POST
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The revelation that five Notre Dame football players tested positive for
steroid use was no revelation at all. In fact, the allegation by former Notre
Dame lineman Steve Huffman that half of the Irish lettermen took steroids isn't
even the most serious charge contained in the first-person story he co-authored
for this week's Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
Steroid use at America's University? The school under the personal watch of
Touchdown Jesus? Of course. The teenagers who enroll at Notre Dame as freshmen,
football players or not, are not the little angels propagandists like Lou Holtz
swear they are. They're normal kids. In the case of football players, they're
tempted, like players anywhere, to take steroids. Huffman wrote that he knew
players who were dealing steroids, that players kept up to 50 bottles of pills
and "injectables" in their rooms. Needles were in the trash cans, he said. If
that was the case, it doesn't make Notre Dame a terrible place; it means Notre
Dame is up against the same problems confronting any big-time college football
program.
</P>
<P>
"Notre Dame officials will deny all this, of course," Huffman said. And of
course, he was right. They denied widespread steroid use, and said five players
since 1987 have tested positive. Let's get something straight; just because
five players test positive doesn't mean only five payers used the stuff. One
reason the original NFL steroid policy had no teeth was that players had plenty
of time to train while using steroids in the offseason, then got off them in
plenty of time to pass a scheduled drug test. Notre Dame has been one of the
leaders in conducting random, year-round testing. Still, some players had to be
sophisticated enough to mask usage or evade detection.
</P>
<P>
Instead of trying to deny Huffman's story or hush it up, Notre Dame officials
would do well to check out his allegations further. They also would be
well-served by being a little more sensitive to Huffman's story than Holtz
allegedly was to injured players.
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, a coach is not responsible for a guy who makes a conscious decision
to juice up on steroids. But he is responsible for demonstrating some
compassion when a kid he has recruited and promised to take care of comes into
his office and says, "Coach, my shoulder is about to fall off."
</P>
<P>
Huffman writes about an argument his father had with Holtz back when he was
coach of Arkansas and Huffman's brother Mike was a Razorback. Mike Huffman says
Holtz would try to throw injured players out of the athletic dorm, lest they
"demoralize the other players."
</P>
<P>
Steve Huffman also says Holtz tried to run him out of South Bend and back to
school in Texas after he was injured at Notre Dame, and that Holtz called him a
"coward" for not playing through a shoulder injury that had required surgery.
Huffman's credibility already has been questioned, partly because current
players have not rushed forward to substantiate his claims and also because he
was paid (a reported $5,000) to co-author the piece. Still, on this score,
Huffman's account rings very true, and it's a story that can be told at
campuses all across America.
</P>
<P>
Holtz unconscionably called Huffman "a quitter" in his best-selling book, "The
Fighting Spirit." Huffman, quite appropriately, pointed out that it is Holtz
with the history of quitting-head coaching jobs at William and Mary, North
Carolina State, Minnesota (remember the infamous "escape clause") and don't
forget the New York Jets, where he lasted through only 13 weeks of a 14-week
NFL season. Holtz escaped from Minnesota just before the NCAA came to campus to
investigate alleged violations. Now, that's quitting.
</P>
<P>
Huffman's story wasn't critical of Notre Dame as much as it was critical of
Holtz, one of the more irritating men in college athletics. Is he a great
college football coach? Without question. He's rebuilt programs everywhere he's
been and won a national title.
</P>
<P>
He's also a world-class whiner. He offended practically anyone with common
sense, particularly his coaching colleagues, last year by saying over and over
that his team wasn't any good ("We're not No. 1; we may not even be in the top
50") despite the fact that Notre Dame was virtually a consensus choice for No.
1 in the preseason polls.
</P>
<P>
His teams hardly comported themselves as the gentlemen the school would like us
all to believe they are. Remember the fights in the tunnel at Notre Dame
stadium against Miami and Southern Cal. Only after three ugly incidents --
there also was unsportsmanlike taunting -- did Holtz accept responsibility for
his team's behavior and publicly insist he would resign if it happened again.
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame is not under indictment here; many schools would be wise to use its
overall student-athlete philosophy as a model. But if school officials really
believe there were only five players who took steroids the last three seasons;
if school officials believe Huffman simply lied to Sports Illustrated about
Holtz's insensitivity for a fee, then Notre Dame will continue to have a very
serious problem.

   For a brief moment, President Reagan was
transported back in time _ hurling a pigskin to a wide receiver at
a sentimental celebration of Notre Dame's Knute Rockne and his own
days as a Hollywood star.
   ``The Gipper'' returned to the Notre Dame campus Wednesday to
pay tribute to the late football legend and dedicate a 22-cent
stamp issued in honor of the coach's 100th birthday.
   It was a nostalgic trip into the past for Ronald Reagan, the
one-time actor, sports announcer and college football player who
clearly reveled in the crowd's friendly applause.
   The Notre Dame gathering of students and faculty _ including
many wearing Roman collars _ roared approval as they were treated
to clips from Reagan's 1940 film portrayal of Notre Dame football
star George Gipp in ``Knute Rockne: All American.''
   The film showed the fresh-faced Reagan, playing Gipp, as he
playfully kicked footballs high above the playing field while Pat
O'Brien, playing Rockne, persuades him to join the team.
   Another clip showed O'Brien, as Rockne, giving a pep talk to his
players at halftime of a 1928 game against Army, with both sides
scoreless. Gipp had died eight years earlier, but the coach tells
his charges that on his deathbed the young athlete said, ``Some
time when the team is up against it and the breaks are beating the
boys, tell them to go out there with all they got and win just one
for the Gipper.''
   Army went ahead in the third quarter, 6-0, but Notre Dame went
on to win the game, 12-6. Army was one yard from the tying
touchdown as time ran out.
   Reagan's supporters adopted the ``Win one'' phrase during his
presidency to help garner support for his programs. And the
nickname ``the Gipper'' has since stuck.
   At the end of his speech, the filled-to-capacity crowd was
silent as Reagan tried to repeat the lines from Gipp's deathbed
scene. Few, however, noticed that Reagan flubbed the line and
instead of saying ``Gipper,'' actually pronounced it ``Gippet,''
since his listeners erupted in a joyful cheer at the sentimental
moment.
   Handed a football, Reagan hurled it towards members of the Notre
Dame football team seated strategically near the podium.
   Aiming at one young man who held his arms high, Reagan heaved
the pigskin _ directly, it turned out, at Heisman trophy winner Tim
Brown. Again, the crowd roared approval.
   Reagan had told his audience that the role of Gipp ``was a young
actor's dream'' but that playing in a film about Rockne ``was more
than that'' to him.
   ``I know that, to many of you today, Rockne is a revered name, a
symbol of greatness and, yes, a face on a postage stamp,'' he said.
   ``But my generation, well, we actually knew the legend as it
happened _ we saw it unfold. And we felt it was saying something
important about us as a people and a nation,'' the 77-year-old
president said.
   ``Most of all, the Rockne legend meant this: ... that on or off
the field, it is faith that makes the difference, it is faith that
makes great things happen.''
   Rockne, a graduate of the Roman Catholic college, was its head
football coach from 1918 to 1931. He compiled a record of 108
victories, 12 losses and five ties. During his tenure, the Fighting
Irish were undefeated in five seasons and won six national
championships.
   The White House has worked for years to produce picture-perfect
events to frame the president as the nation's leader _ but few
could have been as nostalgic.
   ``He loved it,'' said Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, a 1940
Notre Dame graduate who traveled with Reagan aboard Air Force One.
   The Cabinet secretary said Reagan particularly enjoyed tossing
the football.
   ``The president threw a perfect strike,'' Lyng added with a
laugh.

<P>
The Miami Hurricanes have been ordered not to taunt, and Notre Dame has been
warned not to brawl. So, Saturday night's action at the Orange Bowl may be
limited to tackles and touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
Few complaints are likely, since the showdown between the top-ranked Fighting
Irish (11-0) and seventh-ranked Miami (9-1) is one of the year's biggest games.
The Hurricanes view it as a rematch; they lost at South Bend, Ind., last year,
31-30, and that was the margin by which Notre Dame won the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
The rivalry is heated, partly because the teams have contrasting reputations.
</P>
<P>
"It's the Miami Vice image against the Pope image," Hurricanes tackle Mike
Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
"Convicts versus Catholics," Miami safety Charles Pharms said. "Pure, wholesome
young men against these vile, nasty boys that should be in prison. I dislike
that. But that's part of the thing that keeps us fired up for this game."
</P>
<P>
The teams fought in a stadium tunnel before last year's game.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, eventual Heisman Trophy winner Tim Brown of Notre Dame complained
about the Hurricanes' taunting after they won 24-0. In 1985, the Irish accused
Miami of running up the score after a 58-7 loss.
</P>
<P>
Last spring, the head coaches and athletic directors from both schools met to
soothe resentment.
</P>
<P>
"When you get two great teams together, sometimes tempers flare," Miami
first-year Coach Dennis Erickson said.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was concerned about what happened, but that's over and done with.
What's important is playing the game itself. I don't think there'll be a
confrontation."
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz agreed.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not the least bit concerned," Holtz said. "I don't think we have any
bitter feelings toward Miami. . . . This is the rivalry right now that kind of
excites us, because we've had some degree of success, and Miami has had
tremendous success."
</P>
<P>
After Notre Dame engaged in another tunnel fight before this fall's game at
home against Southern Cal, Holtz said he'll resign if it happens again.
</P>
<P>
Erickson, meanwhile, has issued orders against taunting and gloating. Such
behavior has been as much a part of Miami football as great quarterbacks, and
Notre Dame guard Tim Grunhard expects it to continue.
</P>
<P>
"Miami will try to intimidate; that's the way they play football," he said. "If
they're pointing fingers and that kind of thing, I'll look them in the eyeand
say, 'Hey, I'll see you next play.'
</P>
<P>
"Notre Dame isn't going to be intimidated. We've won 23 games in a row. We're a
powerhouse now."
</P>
<P>
And the Fighting Irish respect Miami as a powerhouse, too, Grunhard said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the players see the game as good versus evil. I think we see it
as the two powers in this part of the decade clashing."
</P>
<P>
That it is. While Notre Dame has the nation's longest winning streak, the
Hurricanes have won 32 of their past 34 games, and 31 in a row at home.
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Irish have Heisman Trophy contender Tony Rice at quarterback;
Miami has the nation's top defense. The Hurricanes, bound for a Sugar Bowl date
where they'll likely play unbeaten Alabama, remain in contention to finish No.
1. Notre Dame, bound for an Orange Bowl berth against No. 2 Colorado, is the
front-runner in the national championship race.
</P>
<P>
"We're like being in the Final Four in basketball," Holtz said. "We've come
down to the last two games. We've come a long way, but we've got a long way to
go."

LOU HOLTZ: COUNTRY BOY MAKES GOOD

<P>
Lou Holtz can aw-shucks with the best of them. Raised up (that's how they say
it) in a part of Ohio that more closely resembles West Virginia, he learned to
talk the way all football coaches seem to talk, which is to say country.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the only people in the world who say criminy -- also, my golly --
are football coaches and certain elderly, Southern librarians who wear their
hair in a bun. You suspect Holtz would talk that way if he had been born in
Gotham itself.
</P>
<P>
Which is why you had to laugh, just a little, when Holtz, having won himself a
national championship, talked of always dreaming about coaching at Notre Dame
but never, my golly, letting himself quite believe the dream could come true.
At the close of the Fiesta Bowl Monday night, Holtz said the job was "for movie
stars" and not for the likes of him, an old country boy.
</P>
<P>
You laughed because you knew that, for years, Holtz had put escape clauses in
his contracts, allowing him to leave his position if Notre Dame ever called, or
hollered.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, as the Gerry Faust era came crashing to a close, Notre Dame
went looking for someone who could return the school to its past glory and
settled on Holtz, known equally for his country-boy savvy and for winning
football games. It was also suggested that he would retain the proper respect
for Notre Dame academic tradition.
</P>
<P>
And now, it has happened, the first Notre Dame championship since 1977, an
epoch by Irish standards, and there is the inevitable self-congratulation for
which Notre Dame is also famous.
</P>
<P>
"This is what is good and right in America," said Andy Heck, an All-American
offensive tackle. "Notre Dame being No. 1."
</P>
<P>
Just two years ago, the Irish were coming off consecutive 5-6 seasons and
nothing was good or right in America. Now, they're 12-0 and winners of either
their eighth or 11th national title, depending on who is doing the counting.
(Notre Dame claims three in the days before wire-service polls.)
</P>
<P>
In either case, it was Holtz's first, and he would admit that he wasn't quite
sure, after 19 years as a head coach, if he knew how to handle it.
</P>
<P>
"I'm no Barry Switzer," he had said earlier in the week. "This sucker's new to
me."
</P>
<P>
He is no Barry Switzer, and we can be thankful for that. In Notre Dame, we have
a national champion worthy of the honor. In these times where the concept of
student-athlete is the basic dictionary definition of oxymoron, Notre Dame
stands out like a gold helmet. Once again, it has graduated all its football
seniors. Since 1981, when the College Football Association began awarding
honors for graduation rates, Notre Dame has won five times. Duke and Virginia,
not exactly football powerhouses, have won twice apiece.
</P>
<P>
Would you rather the champion had emerged from the depths of the Citrus Bowl,
where Clemson and Oklahoma were playing? Is that what college football is all
about?
</P>
<P>
Of course, it's easier at Notre Dame, it being Notre Dame. People want to go
there. There is that tradition. There are those ghosts. Just as Holtz dreamed
of coaching there, a million kids across America dream of playing there. But no
one ever dreamed the Irish could be as hopelessly mediocre as they were in the
five years of Gerry Faust, who was a very nice man but a very bad wizard.
</P>
<P>
Holtz, as you might have heard, is an amateur magician, but he is a very
professional football coach. Even under Faust, Notre Dame always attracted good
players, and now the Irish have someone who can make something of the stew. The
bigger problem was in forcing Holtz to admit he had any players at all.
</P>
<P>
For the entire week before the big game, when hype makes right, Holtz had
underplayed his team, not unlike a hustler in a pool hall, suggesting that his
team won with a combination of grit and luck and perhaps a modicum of skill.
</P>
<P>
"Oh, my," he said. "We've really got some problems on our team."
</P>
<P>
Seriously, folks, when Holtz took the job, he foresaw just this scenario --
winning a championship and then being expected to repeat. He said he wanted
Notre Dame to reach the point where it could be ranked No. 1 and no one would
even notice. That's the way it used to be.
</P>
<P>
It looks as though it could be that way again.

DAVE DISTEL: VARDELL KNEW WHAT TO DO IN SOUTH BEND
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 21-year-old college football player walking onto the field at Notre Dame
Stadium is like a baseball player coming out of a dugout in Yankee Stadium or a
golfer standing on the first tee at St. Andrews or a priest entering St.
Peter's.
</P>
<P>
It isn't a stadium as much as it's a shrine.
</P>
<P>
It isn't who is there now but rather who has been there.
</P>
<P>
No football player, no matter how young, has gotten through high school and
into college without hearing of legends such as Rockne and Gipp. They are as
real in South Bend as the Golden Dome.
</P>
<P>
Onto this turf strode an athlete named Touchdown Tommy.
</P>
<P>
What a name.
</P>
<P>
Touchdown Tommy.
</P>
<P>
Square jaw. Wide shoulders. Powerful legs. Strong heart.
</P>
<P>
Hollywood would take one look at this guy, cast him opposite Brooke Shields and
wait for the cash registers to go crazy.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it is almost as if Touchdown Tommy was some fantasy character. He just
couldn't be real.
</P>
<P>
It had to be something like "The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant." Our hero
would have to take an underdog to the promised land and probably walk off with
a fair maiden.
</P>
<P>
You want a story line?
</P>
<P>
Touchdown Tommy and a bunch of his pals from a private school out west come to
Notre Dame as conservative 18-point underdogs. Naturally, Notre Dame would be
unbeaten and ranked No. 1 in the nation.
</P>
<P>
The stands would be filled with 59,075 pilgrims to this shrine, all of whom
fully expected the Fighting Irish to roll onward to bigger showdowns against
bigger foes.
</P>
<P>
However . . .
</P>
<P>
Touchdown Tommy would punch over from the one-yard line for first one and then
two and then three and finally four touchdowns, the last coming with 31 seconds
to play. The Irish would lose, 36-31.
</P>
<P>
End of unbeaten season.
</P>
<P>
Also, end of fantasy.
</P>
<P>
Touchdown Tommy was a very real nightmare for the Fighting Irish last Saturday.
He did, indeed, score four touchdowns to lead the visiting Stanford Cardinal to
a rather gigantic 36-31 upset that will be remembered in Palo Alto long after
they will wish they could forget it in South Bend.
</P>
<P>
To get more specific with the reality of this thing, Touchdown Tommy is Tommy
Vardell. He spent his high school days doing the same thing in far less
auspicious places for Granite Hills High School.
</P>
<P>
Like many local youngsters who choose to pursue their college careers
elsewhere, Vardell has suffered a bit from the "out-of-sight, out-of-mind"
syndrome. He was doing quite well at Stanford, thank you, but he had become
almost as anonymous hereabouts as the 47th entry on page 211 of the telephone
book.
</P>
<P>
They know him in Palo Alto . . . and South Bend.
</P>
<P>
Those touchdowns against Notre Dame were his eighth, ninth, 10th and 11th.
Eight of them have come from the one-yard line. The others were cross-country
jaunts from the three, five and eight.
</P>
<P>
No wonder his teammates took to calling him Touchdown Tommy.
</P>
<P>
As his coach, Dennis Green, said: "You know he's going to get the ball, they
know he's going to get the ball, now let's see you stop him."
</P>
<P>
Outrageous.
</P>
<P>
When Notre Dame is involved, you just don't say stuff like that. You go to
Notre Dame, and you have to run through 11 defenders and about 11,000 ghosts.
Nobody scores four touchdowns against the Irish. Teams don't score four
touchdowns against the Irish. No one had this year and only one, Air Force, did
last year.
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame itself does not know if any individual has ever run through its
defense for four touchdowns. It does know Anthony Davis scored six for USC in
1972.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been able to nail down four or five," said John Heisler, Notre
Dame's sports information director. "We've checked records back to 1980, and it
hadn't happened. I'd say the odds are probably good it's never happened."
</P>
<P>
In truth, the odds are probably good that someone scored four touchdowns in one
afternoon against the Irish, but let's just say that Touchdown Tommy cannot
have too much company among ballcarriers who have gone to South Bend to battle
those ghosts.
</P>
<P>
And maybe Notre Dame can feel a little better that it did not get knocked off
its pedestal by any Dick or Harry or even plain old Tom.
</P>
<P>
An institution so steeped in its legends and myths and heroes has to feel a
little more comfortable losing to someone named Touchdown Tommy.
</P>
<P>
In South Bend, he's a fit.

WORDS IGNITE USC-NOTRE DAME RIVALRY

<TEXT>
<P>
It's been more than 60 years since Knute Rockne supposedly implored his
Fighting Irish to win one for the Gipper.
</P>
<P>
Both George Gipp and the Rock are long-since gone, but the practice of firing
up the troops not only is alive and well at South Bend, Ind., but is being
employed for Saturday's Notre Dame-USC showdown.
</P>
<P>
This week, Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz is imploring his Fighting Irish to win
one against the Ripper.
</P>
<P>
That would be USC Coach Larry Smith, who is said to have ripped Notre Dame in a
Times story, written last spring, that has found its way onto the Notre Dame
bulletin board.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during spring practice of last year's Irish victory over USC, Smith
said: "People say we were out-coached and not physical enough against Notre
Dame. That's not true. We out-coached them, out-blocked them and out-tackled
them. We made about seven critical mistakes, and Notre Dame, being a good,
sound football team, took advantage and turned them into points."
</P>
<P>
Those words didn't create much of a stir at the time, but they were quickly
brought up by Notre Dame linebacker Ned Bolcar Tuesday in a national conference
call with reporters.
</P>
<P>
"It seems like the losing team doesn't want to give us much credit," he said.
"It gets kind of discouraging after a while. You play well for 12 games. You go
out to the West Coast and beat a team and their coach says, they out-hit,
out-coached and out-hustled us. If he says so, that's his business. He saw the
film. But after we play them again Saturday, maybe he'll have a different
opinion this time."
</P>
<P>
When Bolcar's words were relayed to Smith, the USC coach replied, "Was he at my
(press) conference? No? Then I guess it's something his coach told him.
</P>
<P>
"I think what we're getting involved in here is a blackboard war. To me, it has
no bearing on this week. We have great respect for them and all that kind of
thing. If they want to play that game in the newspaper, fine. I think the game
will be played on the field."
</P>
<P>
But the mind games have been going on all week.
</P>
<P>
With the final whistle still echoing in his ear Saturday after USC's 31-15
victory over California at Berkeley, Smith started talking about Notre Dame,
equating the Irish talent with that of the Rams and the San Francisco 49ers,
saying that if the Trojans continued to rack up the penalties as they did
against the Bears, Notre Dame would beat them, 90-0.
</P>
<P>
"They may be the best team in 20 years," Smith said. "If we play the way we did
(against Cal), we'll go up there and get killed."
</P>
<P>
Holtz was quick to answer with a self-inflicted shot of his own. He chose to
denigrate his secondary.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the performance of his defensive backs against Air Force
quarterback Dee Dowis last Saturday, Holtz said, "If he had thrown a hand
grenade in there, the only one who would have been injured would have been the
receiver."
</P>
<P>
But beyond all the golly-gee-they're-such-a-great-team-and
we'll-just-hope-to-show-up-and- not-embarrass-ourselves hype, there is no
denying that Saturday's game at South Bend matches two powerhouses. Notre Dame
is the defending national champion, still No. 1 in the nation and has won 18 in
a row. USC, expected to contend for the national title, has won five straight
since a season-opening loss to Illinois.
</P>
<P>
There's another streak, however, that sticks in USC's craw. The Trojans have
lost six in a row to Notre Dame, having scored their last win over the Irish in
1982.
</P>
<P>
"They're on a mission," Holtz said. "We're on a mission, too, but we just don't
necessarily know what it is.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that we've won six in a row against them, some people might say the
odds are against us. That's nonsense. What happens this year has nothing to do
with the last six. Or the last 50. This is a new game."
</P>
<P>
It's a game Smith is calling "the biggest challenge of my career -- as far as
psychologically, X's and O's, blocking and tackling, you name it."
</P>
<P>
It certainly shapes up as the biggest challenge of USC quarterback Todd
Marinovich's young career. The redshirt freshman has played in only six games,
but he has known about the importance of USC-Notre Dame all his life.
</P>
<P>
How could he escape it?
</P>
<P>
His father, Marv, was a linemen for the Trojans and co-captain of the 1962
national championship squad.
</P>
<P>
And his uncle, former USC quarterback Craig Fertig, led one of the great Trojan
comebacks against the Irish.
</P>
<P>
The year was 1964. Notre Dame was top-ranked, unbeaten, and, seemingly,
unaffected by anything the Trojans could throw at them, leading USC, 17-0, at
the half. But the Trojans came back and won, 20-17, scoring the final points on
a 15-yard touchdown pass from Fertig to Rod Sherman with 1 minute 33 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
Marinovich says that when he goes to his uncle's home, Fertig often finds an
excuse to pull out the tape of that game.
</P>
<P>
"I see it almost yearly," Marinovich said.
</P>
<P>
How does he feel about stepping into the midst of this storied rivalry on the
road with just half a season's experience?
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'll be spooked going in," he said. "I don't know how spooky
that field is. It's the same size field, I think, 120 yards long.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to try to get the crowd out of the way right away by making some
big plays. Good players play best in big games and that's what I'm going to try
to do."
</P>
<P>
As well as trying to keep his mind away from the mind games.
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes
</P>
<P>
Trojan flanker John Jackson sprained an ankle last Saturday against Cal, but
practiced Tuesday and is expected to play against the Irish. So will defensive
back Ernest Spears, who also sprained an ankle Saturday. The news is not so
good for running backs Aaron Emanuel and Scott Lockwood. Emanuel, who suffered
a shoulder injury against Washington and hasn't played since, remains
questionable for the Notre Dame game. Lockwood, who has been sidelined since
dislocating a thumb opening night, is highly doubtful for Saturday. Defensive
lineman Randy Hord is questionable with an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
Although Larry Smith has lost both games he has coached against Notre Dame
while at USC, he split two games against the Irish while at Arizona, beating
Notre Dame in South Bend in 1982, 16-13. . . . The South Bend Tribune-Irish
Fall Classic, a two-game baseball series between USC and Notre Dame, will be
held Thursday and Friday at South Bend's Stanley Coveleski Regional Stadium.
Former Irish coach Ara Parseghian, former USC quarterback Pat Haden and Kansas
City Royal infielder George Brett will throw out the ceremonial first pitches.

<LEADPARA>  Stanford basketball coach Mike Montgomery was scheduled to return late Tuesday
night from the Pacific 10 Conference meetings in Tucson, Ariz., apparently
intending to quell rumors regarding his interest in the vacant Notre Dame
job.;    Though Montgomery did not return phone calls while in Tucson this
week, he told staff members Tuesday that he would be on campus today "to put
out the fires."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Montgomery has been mentioned for the Notre Dame job along with Nebraska's
Danny Nee, SMU's John Shumate and Rick Majerus of Utah.;    Only Nee, a former
Notre Dame assistant, and Shumate, a former Irish All-American and assistant
coach, have ties to the school. Shumate is the only known candidate to have
been interviewed for the vacancy created when Digger Phelps resigned April
15.;    Alan Cummings, Stanford's acting athletic director, said Tuesday that
Stanford had not been contacted by Notre Dame for permission to speak to
Montgomery. That's standard courtesy among universities.;    However, Notre
Dame Athletic Director Dick Rosenthal disregarded such procedure and did not
ask Georgia Tech Athletic Director Homer Rice for permission to talk to Coach
Bobby Cremins this week. Cremins took himself out of the running Monday.  </TEXT>

Gerry Faust applauded Lou Holtz, his successor as Notre Dame coach, after the
top-ranked Fighting Irish claimed the national championship with a Fiesta Bowl
victory over West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
"I was really happy for the kids and Notre Dame and for Lou," Faust said after
the Irish won, 34-21, Monday night in Tempe, Ariz. "Lou did a heck of a job and
did very well. I was really happy for them."
</P>
<P>
Faust, who had a 30-26-1 record as Notre Dame coach from 1981 to 1985, said "it
would have been great" to have won a national championship for the Irish and
join former Irish coaches Dan Devine, Ara Parseghian, Knute Rockne and Frank
Leahy.

THE DUBIOUS VALUE OF NO. 1
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz made a strong case Tuesday for ranking his Irish as
the No. 1 college football team in the nation. Alas, the nation's sportswriters
and coaches already were voting to put Miami in the top spot since the Florida
school was the only one to defeat Notre Dame in 1989. Beyond that, Holtz should
not have felt compelled to lobby so vigorously for the mythical national
championship since it is -- remember -- only mythical. The Notre Dame record
speaks for itself, both academically and on the athletic field.
</P>
<P>
The debate this year over who's No. 1 went to extremes. This frenzy has once
again prompted proposals for a playoff system that would determine a true
national champion, one that could not be questioned or debated. But several
rounds of playoffs would only exacerbate the real problem with intercollegiate
athletics today: Too many games, too much national television exposure for the
top teams, too much money at stake and too much pressure to win, win, win.
</P>
<P>
The nation already has one professional football league with a monthlong
playoff period, including the obscene two-week hype before the annual Super
Bowl. The guys in the NFL are there for money, not education. It is supposed to
be different for students. But college sports seasons are already so long that
fewer than 30% of football and basketball players graduate, according to this
week's U.S. News &amp; World Report.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, there is no guarantee that a college football playoff system would end
the controversy over who's No. 1. What if the flu hit an undefeated No. 1 team
just before the semifinal or championship game? And even the best team goes
flat once in awhile, as in Notre Dame's 27-10 loss to Miami in the last game of
the 1989 regular season -- or Miami's defeat by Florida State for that matter.
</P>
<P>
The solution is not to lengthen the season and play more games before national
television audiences. What is needed is for the academic world to recapture
control of intercollegiate athletics. College and university presidents should
finally summon the intellectual fortitude needed to reverse the stampede toward
professionalization and commercialization of college athletics.

ROCKNE HAD TO BE SOLD ON THE IDEA;
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: A TROJAN GRADUATE MANAGER AND HIS WIFE PERSUADED COACH TO PLAY USC.
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gwynn Wilson has a unique place in the history of the USC-Notre Dame series,
which started in 1926 and has developed into the greatest intersectional
rivalry in college football.
</P>
<P>
It was his idea.
</P>
<P>
As USC's graduate manager, sort of a forerunner to a modern-day athletic
director, Wilson proposed a home-and-home series between the schools to Notre
Dame's legendary coach, Knute Rockne.
</P>
<P>
Rockne agreed to play USC and a monster was created.
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't that simple. Had it not been for the persuasiveness of Wilson's
late wife, Marion, the series might never have come to pass.
</P>
<P>
As Wilson, 93, recalled recently at his home in Rancho Palos Verdes, the idea
came to him on the Monday before Thanksgiving in 1925.
</P>
<P>
Wilson was acquainted with Rockne, who only a year earlier had conducted a
two-week coaching clinic at USC.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, we were looking for a new coach (after the 1924 season)
and he agreed to come out to coach at USC on condition that he would be
released from Notre Dame," Wilson said. "Well, of course, he wasn't released
and it didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
"But, as it turned out, it was better for us that he didn't come. If we had
signed him, we'd have lost our rival."
</P>
<P>
Wilson's thoughts were of Rockne as he drove to work on that Monday morning 65
years ago. Wilson had recently received word that Notre Dame planned to drop
Nebraska from its schedule after the final game between the schools on
Thanksgiving Day, 1925, in Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
It occurred to Wilson that maybe USC could replace Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
"At that time, no team had crossed the Rocky Mountains to play an eastern
team," Wilson said. "They'd only come west for the Rose Bowl."
</P>
<P>
Wilson suggested to USC officials that he board the next train to Lincoln to
meet with Rockne and propose a series.
</P>
<P>
A university vice president, Harold Stonier, said to Wilson: "The first time a
western team plays in the East, it's going to be one of the biggest games ever
played."
</P>
<P>
Stonier approved Wilson's trip, but was reluctant to grant Wilson's request
that he take along his wife.
</P>
<P>
"I'd only been married about a year and wanted to take her along," Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
So Stonier phoned another vice president, Warren Bovard, who approved of
Marion's making the trip. Wilson called his wife and asked her to meet him at
noon at Santa Fe Station.
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Bovard's decision was a critical one.
</P>
<P>
The Wilsons pulled into Lincoln the night before the game.
</P>
<P>
"The town was just humming -- 'Beat Notre Dame! Beat Notre Dame!' " Gwynn said.
"You could see why they were going to discontinue this thing because it was
just wild -- to the point where the game had taken over the town."
</P>
<P>
On the morning of the game, in the lobby of the Lincoln Hotel, Wilson ran into
a startled Rockne, who asked him: "What the hell are you doing here?"
</P>
<P>
Wilson made his pitch, but Rockne told him he was too busy to talk. He told
Wilson that the Irish would leave Lincoln on a midnight train for Chicago after
the game, and suggested that Wilson and his wife book reservations. They would
talk, he said, during the 17-hour trip.
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the next afternoon, though, after Notre Dame had suffered a
17-0 setback, that Wilson could get Rockne alone. After a stream of visitors
had continually disrupted their discussions, the two men retreated to an
observation car.
</P>
<P>
Rockne regaled Wilson with stories of Irish football.
</P>
<P>
"I never had such an afternoon in my life," Wilson said. "It was just a
wonderful afternoon. He was a wonderful guy."
</P>
<P>
But when talk turned to a USC-Notre Dame series, Rockne said that he wasn't
interested. Los Angeles, he said, was too far from South Bend, Ind. The players
would have to be out of school for too many days. The trip would be too
expensive.
</P>
<P>
The press, Rockne said, had started chiding his teams, calling them "The
Ramblers" because they traveled so much, and he didn't like it. He told Wilson
that he was more interested in playing games against teams from the Western
Conference, which later changed its name to the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
"We shook hands and he was very final about it," Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
But when Wilson returned to his seat and told his wife the disappointing news,
she was surprised. She had spent the afternoon with Rockne's wife, Bonnie,
telling her that California was magnificent.
</P>
<P>
She told Bonnie how well the Trojans treated their visitors, getting them great
rates at the Huntington Hotel or the Beverly Hills Hotel, which were among the
nation's best. She told her that when the teams departed, they were given
baskets of fruit for their trip home.
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Rockne wants the game," Marion told her husband.
</P>
<P>
About 20 minutes later, Wilson said, Rockne showed up at the Wilson's
compartment and tapped on the door.
</P>
<P>
"Now, we're about 15 minutes outside of Chicago," Wilson said. "He sat down
across from me. He had a silly, embarrassed grin on his face, but he had a
gleam in his eye and he said to me: 'Gwynn, what was this you were saying about
scheduling some football games?' "
</P>
<P>
A series was born.
</P>
<P>
The first game, played on Dec. 4, 1926, drew a crowd of 74,378 to the Coliseum,
which at the time was capacity. Notre Dame won, 13-12. The second, played on
Nov. 26, 1927, drew a crowd of 120,000 to Chicago's Soldier Field. The Irish
prevailed again, 7-6.
</P>
<P>
Ten times in the series, one team or the other has entered the game ranked No.
1 in the Associated Press poll.
</P>
<P>
"But if it hadn't been for those two women talking in a train on an autumn
afternoon in 1925, this great series never would have been played," Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
Wilson spent nine years at USC, where the student union is named for him,
before taking a job as associate general manager of the 1932 Olympics. He
retired in 1960 from Santa Anita, where he served as general manager of the
race track, and has lived since 1987 in a retirement home in Rancho Palos
Verdes.
</P>
<P>
Marion died in January and, because he has a hard time getting around these
days, Gwynn no longer attends USC games, but he still follows the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
He takes great pride in the USC-Notre Dame series, which he described as
probably the premier competition in the country.
</P>
<P>
"It's been a very constructive thing for the university all these years," he
said. "In fact, we're probably as well known nationally as any other school in
the nation because of that series."
</P>
<P>
For that, USC can thank Gwynn and Marion Wilson.

Notre Dame's Raghib (Rocket) Ismail is "very, very doubtful" for Saturday
night's game against USC at the Coliseum, Irish Coach Lou Holtz said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A deep thigh bruise kept Ismail out of the second half of Notre Dame's 24-21
loss to Penn State last Saturday at South Bend, Ind.
</P>
<P>
Ismail injured his right thigh two months ago against Michigan State,
aggravated the injury a week later against Purdue and didn't play the next week
in a 36-31 loss to Stanford at Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
"Initially, (the doctors) said he was definitely out of (this week's) game,"
Holtz said. "Rocket refuses to hear that. I'd say the chances of him playing in
the game are very, very doubtful, but I'd be less than honest if I didn't tell
you that I have saved a spot on the airplane in the event that something
changes."
</P>
<P>
Even if he plays, Holtz said, Ismail will not return kicks.
</P>
<P>
In last season's 28-24 loss to Notre Dame at South Bend, USC quarterback Todd
Marinovich passed for 333 yards, setting school records with 33 completions and
55 attempts. Last Saturday, in a 45-42 victory over UCLA at the Rose Bowl,
Marinovich threw a game-winning 23-yard touchdown pass to Johnnie Morton.
</P>
<P>
So, who will start Saturday against Notre Dame? As they have every week for the
past month, Marinovich and senior Shane Foley will compete for the job in
practice, Coach Larry Smith said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to change it now," Smith said. JERRY CROWE

<HEAD>Miami Edges Notre Dame in Final AP Football Poll</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS lead to CLARIFY that poll that began 21 years ago was
postseason. A longer version moved on sports wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICK WARNER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The University of Miami was voted national champion Tuesday in
the second narrowest voting since The Associated Press began its
postseason college football poll 21 years ago.
   Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz, whose team finished second, was one
of those who had a better choice in mind.
   ``You can justify why Miami won it. What you can't justify is
why we didn't,'' Holtz said a day after the Fighting Irish defeated
previously unbeaten and top-ranked Colorado 21-6 in the Orange Bowl.
   ``We played the toughest schedule, we had the best record ...
and we beat the No. 1 team quite decisively,'' Holtz said in an
emotional statement likely to renew debate over a playoff system.
   Miami won its third national championship in the last six years
by beating Alabama 33-25 in the Sugar Bowl on Monday night.
   The Hurricanes and Notre Dame each finished with one loss, but
Miami beat the Irish 27-10 on Nov. 25.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that we're the best team in the
country,'' Miami coach Dennis Erickson said. ``It just happens that
it came down to two teams with one loss, and we beat them.''
   Miami (11-1) received 39 first-place votes and 1,474 points,
with Notre Dame (12-1) getting 19 first-place votes and 1,452
points. The 22-point margin was the second closest since the AP
began its postseason poll of sports writers and broadcasters in
1968.
   The other two first-place votes went to No. 3 Florida State, the
only team to beat Miami this season. Colorado fell to No. 4.
   Miami also was chosen No. 1 in United Press International's
coaches' poll, and by USA Today-CNN.
   Erickson said the close vote will increase calls for a playoff
in college football.
   ``The debate is going to go on until there is one. I really
believe down the road there will be a playoff system,'' he said.

Notre Dame officials have informed the NCAA of a university investigation of
possible misuse of a telephone credit card number by members of the football
team, according to a newspaper report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The telephone charges reached thousands of dollars and could involve several
players, the South Bend Tribune reported.
</P>
<P>
Coach Lou Holtz refused to comment but hinted several players may be
disciplined for reasons he declined to explain.
</P>
<P>
"We never discuss disciplinary matters within the university," he said. "When
we practice, a certain number of individuals will be confined to study hall."
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Richard Rosenthal was out of town and could not be reached
for comment.

NEWSWIRE: NOTRE DAME CORNERBACK COLLAPSES, DIES
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Satterfield, a Notre Dame cornerback who previously attended Notre Dame
High School in Sherman Oaks, collapsed and died in a nightclub near South Bend,
Ind., early Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Satterfield, 22, died at 3 a.m., EST, at Pawatang Hospital in Niles, Mich.,
after collapsing at O'Tay's Nightclub in Niles, about 5 miles from the Notre
Dame campus, sports information director John Heisler said.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary autopsy indicated that Satterfield, 22, had suffered a seizure,
followed by cardiac arrest, according to Notre Dame physician James M.
Moriarity.
</P>
<P>
Test results showed no alcohol or drugs in Satterfield's blood at the time of
his death, Heisler said.
</P>
<P>
"The only significant findings of the autopsy examination were an inequality of
the size of the coronary arteries and the presence of increased fluids
surrounding the brain tissue," Heisler said.
</P>
<P>
Satterfield and the Notre Dame team attended a White House reception in honor
of its national championship on Wednesday. He was with defensive end Darrell
Gordon and tailback Mark Green when he collapsed.
</P>
<P>
"He was feeling fine," Gordon told the South Bend Tribune. "He had been dancing
some earlier, but we were just sitting there at the table, just talking and
joking, and all of a sudden he collapsed to the ground. It looked like he was
having a seizure."
</P>
<P>
After playing for Coach Kevin Rooney at Notre Dame High, Satterfield went to
South Bend as a walk-on and was awarded an athletic scholarship last August. He
was listed as a 6-foot, 181-pound cornerback and appeared in 2 games in 1988,
shifting to offense and rushing twice for 9 yards.

<HEAD>Jose Rios Named KCBS News Head</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jose Rios, assistant news director at KCBS-TV
the past three years, was named the station's news director Aug.
28. KCBS denied that pressure from a Hispanic group was behind the
promotion.
   Rios, a 12-year veteran of KCBS, replaces Michael Singer, who
will oversee the station's investigative reporting unit.
   The National Hispanic Media Coalition has threatened to
challenge the station's license with the Federal Communications
Commission over the company's hiring practices.
   The coalition says KCBS has not hired enough Hispanics in
policy-making positions and that the station's number of minority
hires is far below FCC standards.
   KCBS denies the charges.

   Viacom TV Group said Aug. 28 it has
agreed to sell KSLA-TV to Imes Communications Group of Columbus,
Miss.
   Terms of the agreement, which must be approved by the Federal
Communications Commission, were not disclosed.
   When the station was offered for sale in March, Viacom President
Pat Brady said the purpose was to raise funds to reinvest in a
larger television market.
   Imes owns several newspapers, including the Commercial Dispatch

<HEAD>Television Station WWL Sold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   WWL-TV was sold to a group of its employees
on Aug. 27 after more than a year of negotiations.
   The station, which was owned by Loyola University, was sold to
Rampart Broadcasting for $102,850,000, officials said.
   J. Michael Early, general manager of WWL-TV for 29 years, will
remain as chief operating officer. He said the entire management
team will stay with the station.
   ``That's the primary reason we put the deal together in the
first place to assure that loyal employees who put decades of hard
work into the station would not be displaced by new owners coming
in with no knowledge of the market or of past employee loyalties,''
Early said.
   Loyola put WWL-TV on the air on Sept. 7, 1957.

<HEAD>Notre Dame Reaches European Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Notre Dame, the first university to
negotiate its own football contract with a major television
network, is taking its act to Europe this fall.
   The school reached a tentative agreement Aug. 27 to have its
football games televised in six European countries for three years,
athletic director Dick Rosenthal said.
   The deal will allow London-based Screensport to use the feeds
from Notre Dame games being televised in the United States.
Screensport is an all-sports satellite channel that reaches most of
northern Europe.
   Rosenthal declined to disclose terms of the agreement but said
Notre Dame's earnings would be small. ``It's not a big market,'' he
said.
   In February, the Irish, whose television rights were held by ABC
and ESPN, broke from the 64-team College Football Association to
sign a five-year, $37.5 million contract with NBC.
   NBC will have exclusive television rights to Notre Dame's home
games for five seasons beginning in 1991.

<HEAD>KQED Drops Auction Tradition, Cites Small Audiences</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public station KQED-TV, which pioneered the
annual auction as a fund-raising mechanism 36 years ago, said Aug.
30 it was ending the practice because of dwindling audiences.
   Jon Abbott, KQED's vice president for marketing and development,
said the 1990 auction raised $550,000 on costs of $350,000, a
narrower margin than in previous years.
   Abbott said recent audiences ``were so small as to be
unmeasurable in the Nielsen ratings.''
   Public stations in New York and Washington, D.C., have recently
axed their auctions, too, said JoAnne Sutro, KQED's manager of
television promotion.

WHICH WALSH IS STAYING AND WHICH IS LEAVING?

<TEXT>
<P>
This was the weekend you reluctantly turned down the invitation from the Mount
Everest Triathlon to stay at home and compete in your own audio-visual
ultra-marathon.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to remote control, a bionic thumb and, of course, extremely limited
amounts of liquid refreshment, you watched all or part of 12 football games
over a 60-hour holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
But seeing was not always believing. Were Dave Krieg and the Seattle Seahawks
NFL or Yankee Conference? Should Troy Aikman be inducted into the NFL's Hall of
Fame this summer, or be made to play an exhibition game first?
</P>
<P>
If you lined up every serviceman who waved his arms for semaphore's sake in the
last 50 years and multiplied by 10, would it equal half the arm-waving of the
Miami Hurricanes? Hey, would you guys prefer to be called the Windmills?
</P>
<P>
And what about Walshgate? Both Walshes have really good jobs, yet both are
rumored to be staying and leaving at the same time and both keep issuing
non-denial denials.
</P>
<P>
Are they the same person, the product of a brilliant makeup artist? Why not a
switcheroo? If Steve Walsh coached the San Francisco 49ers and Bill Walsh
quarterbacked Miami, who'd win? Or care?
</P>
<P>
Have you seen Bill Walsh? Has he always been freeze-dried? Or does it just look
that way on TV because he was standing in fog at Soldier Field?
</P>
<P>
He wasn't? That's next Sunday? Sorry, folks. You run a 60-hour, 12-game
football marathon, you get a little confused.
</P>
<P>
But on this, the fourth day of the New Year, things are becoming clear. The NFL
season isn't quite over, but the college football season seems to be, now that
Notre Dame has turned down Miami's invitation for an unofficiated,
come-as-you-are rematch on an abandoned oil rig in the Straits of Hormuz.
</P>
<P>
Miami Coach Jimmy "Pile It On" Johnson thinks his team got gypped out of the
No. 1 ranking because it had an apparent touchdown nullified and later
attempted (and missed) a two-point conversion in its 31-30 loss to Notre Dame
last October in South Bend, Ind.
</P>
<P>
That's just as well. Despite reports that the Miami program is attempting to
erase its image as class-cutting, trash-talking, street-fighting men who live
as if above the law, how can you take seriously any school whose students' main
goal is a suntan?
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame, on the other hand, is a No. 1 the world can respect. Unlike
virtually every other big-time football power, Notre Dame has intentionally
avoided steps that would further separate its players from the student body.
</P>
<P>
At Notre Dame, there is no jock dorm. Football players live in regular dorms
with the other students. Even share rooms with non-jock students. I'll never
forget going to South Bend nearly 10 years ago to interview Notre Dame tailback
and Heisman hopeful Vagas Ferguson and feeling somewhat strange as his friends
on his hall, itty-bitty and average-sized Notre Dame students, stopped by to
say hi.
</P>
<P>
At most other schools, you go to interview a football player, you're surrounded
only by other meat hooks. Not at Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
Redshirting, the rampant practice of holding a player (usually a freshman) out
of competition for a year, is also done at most football factories. Often,
there's nothing physically wrong with the player, other than that there's
somebody better playing ahead of him at his position. He's redshirted so his
body can further mature and grow while he awaits his chance. Of West Virginia's
five starting interior offensive linemen in the Fiesta Bowl -- average size
6-foot-3, 271 pounds -- all were redshirted, fifth-year seniors.
</P>
<P>
Not at Notre Dame. At Notre Dame, a player is redshirted and becomes a
five-year campus man only if he can't play that season because of serious
injury. Otherwise, he is expected to play, to study and to graduate. Since
1965, only seven Notre Dame football players have failed to graduate, a 98.7
percent rate. That's admirable by any standard.
</P>
<P>
Like Jane Fonda or Morton Downey Jr., Notre Dame is not something many people
feel neutral about. As the most famous Catholic school in the country, its
wonderful fight song standard fare for every marching band, its gridiron heroes
immortalized on the silver screen (by future presidents, no less), Notre Dame
will always suffer backlash.
</P>
<P>
Critics say if Notre Dame doesn't cheat, or cheats less than other big-time
football programs, it's only because its national name is so glorious, its
allure so magical, that it doesn't have to.
</P>
<P>
Even with a poor schnook such as Gerry Faust running the program into the
ground, Notre Dame got great recruits. But then, so do UCLA, USC, Nebraska,
Oklahoma, Michigan, Auburn and Alabama. For every kid who wants to play at
Notre Dame, there's a kid who wants to beat them.
</P>
<P>
But if you're going to beat Notre Dame -- the Irish lose few top players to
graduation this year and figure to be even better next season -- you better get
lots of kids. That's what makes college basketball inherently more interesting
than college football -- so many more teams have a chance to be in the top 20,
if not No. 1.
</P>
<P>
Over the holidays, Alaska-Anchorage beat mighty Michigan in basketball. That
could never happen in football -- even if Alaska-Anchorage had a team.
</P>
<P>
In college basketball, you can land two or three blue-chip recruits and have a
great team. In college football, you have to land 20 or 30, which is why it's
so much harder to turn a college football program from also-ran to all-star.
</P>
<P>
If three bright blue-chip basketball players chose Harvard, Harvard could go to
the Final Four. That could never happen in today's big-time college football.
</P>
<P>
But what has happened is Notre Dame, with its great name, and a great coach in
Lou Holtz, is No. 1 for the first time in 11 years. And to the extent that
people use No. 1 as a guiding light, Notre Dame is not a bad one to have.

   President Reagan said today he sees ``a
will to succeed evident in our land'' reminiscent of the spirit of
legendary football coach Knute Rockne, who led Notre Dame to five
undefeated seasons.
   Reagan, unveiling a commemorative stamp to mark the 100th
anniversary of Rockne's birth, reminisced both about Rockne's
storied career and his own role in Hollywood's portrayal of it.
   And the president used the occasion to predict a rosy future for
U.S. business.
   ``American industry is lean and mean and ready to meet the
competition head-on,'' he said. ``I predict that, as this year
progresses, we will see American manufacturing re-emerge as the
leading force in the world marketplace. Exports will, in fact, race
ahead and lead our domestic economy.''
   Reagan said the Rockne legend ``stood for fair play and honor,
but you know, it was thorougly American in another way. It was
practical; it placed a value on devastating quickness and agility
and on confounding the opposition with good old American
cleverness. But most of all, the Rockne legend meant this ... that
on or off the field, it is faith that makes the difference, it is
faith that makes great things happen.''
   Reagan said Rockne recognized ``the fundamental element of the
American character that no tyranny and few of our competitors can
ever hope to match. Knute Rockne knew and appreciated it: The
creative genius and omnipresent optimism of our people.''
   Reagan also reminisced about his own heyday in Hollywood, when
he convinced a producer to allow him to play the part of George
Gipp in the movie ``Knute Rockne: All American.'' Gipp was the
Notre Dame football player whose deathbed request to Rockne _ ``Win
just one for the Gipper'' _ inspired the team to a 12-6 victory
over Army in 1928.
   Reagan called the part ``a young actor's dream'' and he said the
movie still has a message for Americans:
   ``There's a will to succeed evident in our land. I happen to
have always believed in the American people. Don't ever sell them
short. Given the proper tools and a level playing ground, our
workers can out-produce and out-compete anyone, anywhere.''
   He added that ``there are those who see a dark side to our
technological progress'' with the development of more deadly
weapons.
   However, the president said, ``Technology is pointing a way out
of this dilemma'' and cited his ``Star Wars'' space-based missile
defense system.
   The crowd in Joyce Athletic Center was treated to several
minutes of the Rockne film on a giant screen showing the young
Reagan as he portrayed Gipp throwing the ball and hustling with his
teammates.
   At the end of Reagan's speech, he was handed a football which he
hurled toward a group of players seated in the crowd. Heisman
trophy winner Tim Brown caught the pigskin as the crowd roared its
approval.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ``the Gipper goes
back'' as he announced the trip. During his presidency, Reagan's
supporters have seized upon his movie-inspired nickname to help
build support for his political programs.
   The president himself recalled the emotional movie during his
first visit to Notre Dame's South Bend campus, when he delivered
the commencement address on May 17, 1981.
   Rockne, a graduate of the men's college, was its head football
coach from 1918 to 1931 and compiled a record of 108 wins, 12
defeats and five ties. During his tenure, the ``Fighting Irish''
were undefeated in five seasons and won six national championships.
   An innovator of the forward pass and the ``box formation,''
Rockne taught his players to excel in the classroom as well as the
playing field.
   Rockne was killed in a plane crash on March 31, 1931, an
accident that stunned the nation. His funeral Mass was broadcast
across the nation on radio.
   He won a place in the College Football Hall of Fame's first
group of inductees in 1951.
   The 22-cent stamp produced in his honor bears a portrait of the
smiling, balding coach holding a football. Rockne's name is
emblazoned in blue and gold, the colors of the ``Fighting Irish.''
   It is the sixth in the American Sports series, which has honored
Babe Didrikson Zaharias, Bobby Jones, Babe Ruth, Jim Thorpe and
Roberto Clemente.
   The stamp was a joint effort of designer Peter Cocci and
engraver Tom Hipschen, both of the Bureau of Engraving and
Printing, the White House said.
   The new stamp goes on sale nationally tomorrow.

HOLTZ TAKES BLAME FOR PREGAME INCIDENT;
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: NOTRE DAME'S PLAYERS ARE EXPECTED TO WRITE A COLLECTIVE
LETTER OF APOLOGY TO USC FOR THE FIGHT THAT BEGAN AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
What really happened at Notre Dame?
</P>
<P>
Three days after the Fighting Irish defeated USC, 28-24, there remain more
questions than answers about the fighting the Irish and Trojans did before the
game. There is still little light at the end of the tunnel incident.
</P>
<P>
Who started it? Were the Notre Dame players lying in wait for the Trojans? Or
did USC instigate the brawl by disrupting the Fighting Irish pregame drills?
</P>
<P>
The evidence seems to support USC.
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz has taken full responsibility, and said he'd resign
if it ever happened again. Notre Dame's players are expected to write a
collective letter of apology to the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
Richard Rosenthal, Notre Dame's athletic director, has called Mike McGee, his
USC counterpart, to apologize and assure that this will never happen again.
</P>
<P>
But details remain sketchy. This is one case where instant replay is no help.
It just shows a mass of bodies pushing and shoving outside the tunnel leading
to the locker rooms at Notre Dame Stadium.
</P>
<P>
It got pretty rough in there. Two off-duty policemen, working as bodyguards for
the Trojans, got caught in the middle. One suffered a black eye. The other lost
a tooth.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, one of those most seriously injured was a Notre Dame security guard
who was attacked by his own players. His mistake was wearing a yellow rain
slicker, the same style and color as those worn by the USC coaches.
</P>
<P>
Figuring there were about 120 Notre Dame players in uniform and about 60
Trojans, you could probably ask each individual and get 180 different versions
of what happened.
</P>
<P>
This much seems clear: The Trojans, leaving the field after their pregame
warmup, ran into the middle of Notre Dame's punt drill.
</P>
<P>
"We were running in," USC quarterback Todd Marinovich said, "and guys were
getting picked off. That's going to happen because we were done with our
warm-ups before they were. They were right at the tunnel, punting toward us."
</P>
<P>
The rules, clearly marked in the visiting locker room, request that the
opposing team use the narrow sidelines to exit the field.
</P>
<P>
"There are no sidelines on that field," Marinovich said. "I don't see how 60
guys can go single file into the tunnel without going by them anyway. It was
just a madhouse.
</P>
<P>
"Most of our players got into the tunnel, but then they (the Irish) blocked the
tunnel from the stragglers."
</P>
<P>
Marinovich, although he made it safely to the tunnel, didn't escape the blows.
</P>
<P>
"I was dodging guys and I got a forearm I didn't even see. It was a jab," he
said, pointing to his ribs.
</P>
<P>
When Marinovich looked up, he saw defensive end Scott Kowalkowski.
</P>
<P>
"I don't get involved in those things," Marinovich said. "All you can do is
hurt your hand, and I don't need any of that. So I just kept going."
</P>
<P>
But not before the two exchanged words.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be running into you all afternoon, " Kowalkowski reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
Nor was Marinovich totally innocent.
</P>
<P>
Later, after throwing a touchdown pass, he deliberately ran into Kowalkowski.
</P>
<P>
"I just gave him a little nudge," Marinovich said, "to let him know I was
there."
</P>
<P>
Tit for tat.
</P>
<P>
Here were archrivals placed in a volatile pregame situation with the logical
result.
</P>
<P>
But it's not the first such incident at Notre Dame Stadium. A year ago, the
Fighting Irish and players from Miami clashed in the same tunnel before another
big game.
</P>
<P>
John Heisler, Notre Dame's sports information director, said one possible
solution would be for the Fighting Irish to warm up on the other side of the
field.
</P>
<P>
Such a good idea, you'd think somebody might have thought of it before.
</P>
<P>
USC Coach Larry Smith has tried to avoid discussing the Notre Dame game,
attempting to refocus his team's attention on Saturday's game against Stanford
at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
But asked about "the Spot," he broke his own gag rule.
</P>
<P>
The controversial spot came on USC's first drive of the third quarter. On third
and seven at the Trojan 14-yard line, Marinovich hit tight end Scott Galbraith
with a pass. On the replay, it appeared that Galbraith had reached the 22-yard
line before being pushed back and out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
But the ball was spotted at the 20, leaving USC a yard short. The Trojans
punted, and Notre Dame, trailing at the time, 17-7, drove down and scored to
get back in the game.
</P>
<P>
So what did Smith say to the official?
</P>
<P>
"I just asked him how he could sleep at night," Smith said. "How could he look
himself in the mirror?"
</P>
<P>
Smith, now in his third year at USC and his 14th year as a collegiate head
coach, said this defeat went down as hard as any.
</P>
<P>
"We put so much into it," he said, "emotionally, physically and everything,
played so hard and wanted to win it so bad . . . That was probably the hardest
I've ever seen a team take a loss."
</P>
<P>
Smith included.
</P>
<P>
The Trojans have lost seven straight games to Notre Dame. Smith himself has
coached the last three defeats, including last season's battle for No. 1.
</P>
<P>
But going in, he was sure this was the year.
</P>
<P>
"This is a down place right now," Smith said Tuesday of the USC campus. "We
haven't received any heat of any kind. It's been all support.
</P>
<P>
"But when you want something so badly and don't get it, we all have to know
this is part of life.
</P>
<P>
"It's like that kid at Christmas who has been wishing for that pony all his
life. He thinks, 'Boy, this is the year I'm going to get it. I'm old enough to
ride it. Everything's perfect. The barn's built.'
</P>
<P>
"And he doesn't get it. The next day, he's not going to be a very happy camper,
right?"
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes
</P>
<P>
Trojan defensive lineman Randy Hord, who limped into practice last week on a
sprained ankle, limped out of Saturday's game with an injury to the other ankle
and is listed as "very doubtful" this Saturday. . . . Running backs Aaron
Emanuel (shoulder) and Scott Lockwood (dislocated thumb) will also stay on the
sideline except in an emergency. . . . Kick returner Bruce Luizzi has a
shoulder separation and is not expected to play either . . . The cold weather
in South Bend, Ind., has left the Trojans facing a cold and flu attack, but
that is not expected to keep anyone on the bench against Stanford. . . . Nose
tackle Don Gibson, who has yet to play a down this season, may be just a week
away. Gibson, who tore knee ligaments in preseason training, may see his first
action against Oregon State Nov. 4 at the Coliseum. . . . Marc Preston has
beaten out Ron Dale for the punting job.

IRISH NOTCH 21ST WIN IN A ROW;
</P>
<P>
NOTRE DAME: SCHOOL RECORD FOR CONSECUTIVE VICTORIES IS TIED IN 41-0 ROUT OF
OUTMANNED NAVY.

How does a team win 21 consecutive games? Talent, lots of it. Just ask Navy
Coach Elliott Uzelac.
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty obvious Notre Dame had too many horses for us," Uzelac said
after his Midshipmen lost to top-ranked Notre Dame, 41-0, Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we played that poorly, but at times they made us look poorly."
</P>
<P>
Navy (2-6) remains winless against Notre Dame (9-0) since 1963.
</P>
<P>
The 21 consecutive victories ties the school record set by teams coached by
Frank Leahy, 1946-48, beginning with Army and ending with a tie against USC.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even mention it in the locker room after the game," Notre Dame Coach
Lou Holtz said.
</P>
<P>
The Irish, whose last loss was to Texas A&amp;M on Jan. 1, 1988, figures to
easily set a school record of 22 consecutive victories next Saturday they play
host to Southern Methodist, a struggling team that resumed football this season
after a two-year suspension from the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
"If we want to hold the score down, we'll pass on every down," Holtz said.
</P>
<P>
Against Navy, quarterback Tony Rice completed only one of eight passes for 28
yards with two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
But Rice led a rushing attack that gained 414 yards. Ricky Watters rushed for
134 yards and one touchdown, becoming the first Irish player this season to
rush for more than 100 yards.
</P>
<P>
Raghib (Rocket) Ismail, Notre Dame's speedy flanker and return specialist,
suffered a groin injury in the first half and did not return.
</P>
<P>
The shutout was Holtz's first in his four seasons as coach. The last one for
the Irish was a 42-0 victory over Army on Oct. 15, 1983.
</P>
<P>
Rice ran six yards for a touchdown 1:15 into the game and Rod Culver ran 11
yards for a touchdown on the Irish's next possession.
</P>
<P>
Navy's David Lerch interrupted the next Irish drive by intercepting a pass by
Rice, but the Middies' Alton Grizzard was sacked for a 14-yard loss on third
down and Watters rushed for a 48-yard touchdown on the next possession for a
21-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
Billy Hackett's 27-yard field goal made it 24-0 at halftime, and he kicked a
39-yarder on Notre Dame's first drive of the second half.
</P>
<P>
Navy advanced to the Notre Dame 34 in the third quarter, its deepest
penetration, but Grizzard fumbled and Eric Simien recovered for the Irish.
</P>
<P>
Dorsey Levens' two-yard touchdown run and Ted McNamara's one-yard plunge
completed the scoring.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: IRISH ARE IN A 1-3 HOLE WITHOUT STANDOUT LAPHONSO ELLIS --
THEIR WORST START SINCE 1981.

Without the Phonz, happy days have been few this season for the Notre Dame
basketball team.
</P>
<P>
Going into today's game against UCLA (4-0) at the Joyce Athletic and
Convocation Center, the Fighting Irish are 1-3 and seemingly counting the days
until the return of their best player, LaPhonso Ellis.
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot-9 forward who was a freshman All-American last season, when he
averaged 13.5 points and 9.4 rebounds a game and had 24 points and 13 rebounds
in an 82-79 victory over UCLA at Pauley Pavilion, Ellis is academically
ineligible for at least a few more days.
</P>
<P>
Last summer, his grade-point average slipped below 2.0, the university-imposed
minimum for athletes. Ellis, who is eligible by the less-stringent NCAA
standards, is expected to return to the lineup this week after the university
registrar accepts his fall grades.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Irish continue to struggle, though they have everybody back from
a team that was 21-9 and reached the second round of the NCAA tournament before
losing to Georgetown, 81-74.
</P>
<P>
After beating San Francisco in their only home game, they lost to Louisville at
Indianapolis, to Indiana at Bloomington, Ind., and to Marquette at Milwaukee.
The 80-68 defeat by Marquette ended a 12-game winning streak against the
Warriors.
</P>
<P>
Ellis' absence has played a major part in their worst start since 1981, Coach
Digger Phelps said last week.
</P>
<P>
"It's like the Celtics without Larry Bird last season," he said. "As one of the
kids said, 'It would be like football without Tony Rice.' Certain guys make the
chemistry work. LaPhonso is one of those guys."
</P>
<P>
Last season, Ellis helped the Irish gain a 39-20 rebounding edge over the
Bruins. In an 81-65 win over Vanderbilt in the first round of the NCAA
tournament, he had 17 points and 18 rebounds in only 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"I can understand why everyone's concerned and looking at us and saying,
'What's wrong?' " said Phelps, who believes that the reason should be obvious
to anybody who has seen Ellis play. "He's an impact player, and impact players
make a lot of things happen.
</P>
<P>
"He's a charismatic player and one of the best who will ever play Notre Dame
basketball."
</P>
<P>
For now, though, the Irish will make do without him.
</P>
<P>
And UCLA, seemingly, will take nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
Last season, the Bruins avoided J.R. Reid for all but 10 minutes in two games
against North Carolina -- he was returning from an injury when the teams met in
December and was suspended when they met in March -- and still they lost twice,
absorbing one of their worst losses at Chapel Hill, N.C.
</P>
<P>
In fact, in six games last season against teams that advanced beyond the first
round of the NCAA tournament, the Bruins were 1-5, beating only Louisville on a
controversial goaltending call at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
"That was probably as good as we were a year ago," Coach Jim Harrick said. "I
thought we really got the maximum out of the talent we had. You really couldn't
have expected much more out of that club.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to take a step further and be a little bit better this year."
</P>
<P>
Still, Harrick said, this rivalry means more to Notre Dame than it does to
UCLA. The most famous game in the series, of course, was a 71-70 Irish victory
that ended UCLA's record 88-game winning streak in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Harrick, though, grumbled for weeks after last season's game.
</P>
<P>
"Every UCLA coach has been programmed to say (this game isn't that important to
them)," said Phelps, who has faced seven Bruin coaches in more than 18 seasons
at Notre Dame. "I think any time they play outside their conference, they make
a statement like that. But this is like Notre Dame and Southern Cal in
football. It's a rivalry.
</P>
<P>
"If it's not that big a game, then why are we one of their few sellouts in the
last few years? When they come here, our students know it's UCLA. And when we
show up at Pauley, the UCLA student section seems to be really wired.
</P>
<P>
"No matter what the coaches say, the fans and student bodies know that this has
been one of the traditional rivalries in college basketball for the last 20
years."
</P>
<P>
Phonz or no Phonz, another scene will be played out today.

   Turning 100 calls for more than the usual
birthday cake. It calls for fanfare.
   That's just what Edward J. Story's going to get for his birthday
_ and for being Notre Dame's oldest living graduate.
   Story's 100th birthday was Tuesday. He'll be honored Saturday in
South Bend, Ind., during halftime at the Notre Dame football game
with Navy.
   Story graduated from Notre Dame in 1911. He attended chemistry
classes with legendary Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne.
   ``I helped him with his experiments,'' Story said.
   After graduation, Story worked as a pharmacist, served as an
Army lieutenant during World War I and taught high school.
   Story will get a T-shirt, a certificate and another belated
birthday present at the football game, said Charles F. Lennon Jr.,
director of Notre Dame's alumni association.
   ``He'll be wearing a hat that says Notre Dame Alumni Association
75-Year Club. He's the only member,'' Lennon said.
   Story credits his longevity to abstention from smoking, chewing,
drinking, gambling and running around.
   ``You wouldn't think I had much fun, and I sure don't,'' he said.

   Turkeys can do wonders for parking lot
scofflaws in the eyes of Judge Tom Fiorina.
   The judge is known for reducing parking fines in favor of
community service. And he did just that Tuesday night, when he
called a rare Halloween court session for chronic violators who had
failed to answer summonses.
   The municipal judge sought the presence of about 200 people, but
only about 40 showed up.
   Fiorina reduced fines, some as much as 80 percent, on the
condition the offenders who attended the court session donate food
to the poor, provide public service or sell tickets to Thanksgiving
In Santa Fe, an annual fund-raiser for charity.
   Adam Bernstein, who had about $500 worth of parking tickets,
left owing $12 and two turkeys for the poor.
   ``I'm known as a guy that's fair, maybe even more than fair,''
Fiorina said.
   Those who failed to show up won't be so lucky, he said.
   ``I thought Halloween would be a great night because it's trick
or treat, and those that didn't show up are going to find
themselves with two tricks, a ticket and a warrant,'' he said.

Notre Dame was proclaimed national collegiate football champion on all fronts
Tuesday, less than 24 hours after beating previously undefeated West Virginia,
34-21, in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Irish (12-0), ranked No. 1 for the final 6 weeks of the regular
season, received 58 1/2 first-place votes and 1,198 1/2 of a possible 1,200
points from a nationwide panel of 60 sportswriters and sportscasters in the
Associated Press poll.
</P>
<P>
Miami (11-1), the 1987 national champion whose only loss was at Notre Dame,
31-30, in October, finished second with 1 1/2 first-place votes and 1,141 1/2
points, followed by Florida State (11-1), Michigan (9-2-1) and West Virginia
(11-1).
</P>
<P>
UCLA (10-2) wound up sixth after downing Arkansas, 17-3, in the Cotton Bowl,
while USC (10-2) was seventh after losing to Michigan, 22-14, in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
The annual Kickoff game, staged in late August or early September at Giants
Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., would like to match Notre Dame with UCLA, but
both schools have had lukewarm responses.
</P>
<P>
The Irish also were the unanimous choice of the National Football Foundation
and Hall of Fame's 12-man committee as winner of the MacArthur Bowl, emblematic
of the national championship.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Notre Dame won the Football Writers Assn. of America's Grantland
Rice National Championship Trophy. The Irish were the unanimous choice of a
5-man committee.
</P>
<P>
"Winning the national championship was never in my thoughts," Holtz said.
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, you dream about it. But I never really thought that it would happen to
me. I never thought I would coach a national championship team. It still hasn't
sunk in on me yet."
</P>
<P>
Holtz was unhappy with only one aspect of Notre Dame's Fiesta Bowl victory --
the penalties the Irish received for unsportsmanlike conduct.
</P>
<P>
When Holtz came on the field to calm his players late in the game, he was also
hit with a penalty.
</P>
<P>
"I think late in the game we got away from some of the things we believe in,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame, which finished 17th a year ago, was No. 13 in the preseason AP
poll. The Irish jumped to No. 8 by opening with a 19-17 victory over Michigan.
</P>
<P>
The Irish climbed to second before taking over the No. 1 spot after top-ranked
UCLA lost to Washington State on Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the AP Top 10 are Auburn, Clemson and Nebraska. The Second 10
consists of Oklahoma State, Arkansas, Syracuse, Oklahoma, Georgia, Washington
State, Alabama, Houston, LSU and Indiana.

Notre Dame officials denied a report that football Coach Lou Holtz is stepping
up efforts to become head coach of the Minnesota Vikings or Tampa Bay
Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
Columnist Paul Domowitch of the Philadelphia Daily News on Thursday quoted
unidentified sources as saying the impetus for Holtz's job hunt is the NCAA's 2
1/2-year investigation of the University of Minnesota, where Holtz coached in
1984 and 1985.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the Daily News report on Holtz, Notre Dame Sports Information
Director John Heisler said: "I think there's a lot of misinformation in the
story. This has been answered. At every press conference we've had in the last
six weeks, he (Holtz) has said he's not contacted anyone.
</P>
<P>
"He's not looking for another job. He'll be back at Notre Dame."
</P>
<P>
The Daily News said sources told Domowitch that Holtz has an intermediary in
contact with both Tampa Bay and Minnesota about his interest.
</P>
<P>
The Tampa job became available two weeks ago when Ray Perkins was fired.
Vikings Coach Jerry Burns has hinted that he will retire at the end of the
season.

<LEADPARA>  LaPhonso Ellis, Notre Dame's leading scorer and rebounder, is academically
ineligible and will miss the rest of the season.;    Even with Ellis, Notre
Dame was suffering its worst start in two decades under Coach Digger Phelps.

games, over Miami (Fla.) and West Virginia. Ellis was averaging 16.4 points
and 10.5 rebounds.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  NOTRE DAME'S ELLIS ACADEMICALLY INELIGIBLE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "It will be a big loss for us," Phelps said Wednesday.;    The 6-foot-9
junior from East St. Louis, Ill., scored a career-high 32 points and grabbed
11 rebounds Tuesday in Notre Dame's 84-70 victory over West Virginia.;
"LaPhonso probably played his best game at Notre Dame against the
Mountaineers," Phelps said.;    Ellis, an accounting major, passed all his
courses but failed to maintain the 2.0 grade-point average Notre Dame requires
for athletes to compete, Phelps said. The loss of Ellis will force the Irish
to regroup before playing a difficult series of home games the next three
weeks, including No. 14 Virginia, No. 12 Duke and No. 8 Syracuse.;    "The
Ross twins (Jon and Joe) and Kevin Ellery are going to have to become more of
a factor," Phelps said. The freshman twins, playing at forward, have averaged
3.0 and 1.4 points per game. Ellery, a senior, has averaged 9.8 points and 4.8
rebounds.;    "We have to do things without Phonz," Phelps said. "It's like
he's in foul trouble.";    Notre Dame was earlier stung by the loss of point
guard Tim Singleton, who missed six weeks with a back injury. Singleton was
leading in assists when he injured his back against Kentucky. He returned
against West Virginia, scored four points and led the team with 10 assists.;
 The Irish lost a key player in September, when sophomore Monty Williams left
the program after doctors diagnosed a potentially dangerous heart condition.
Williams had started 18 games as a freshman and averaged 7.7 points.  </TEXT>

NOTRE DAME IS BACK WHERE IT BELONGS -- NO. 1

<TEXT>
<P>
Those faint fright tremors jolting most major-college football offices about
the country just now are similar to what hits particular corporate board rooms
each time IBM gets inspirational. Notre Dame (Gulp!) is back. Even more
unsettling, Coach Lou Holtz is worried.
</P>
<P>
Holtz is a witty man. After a loss at Arkansas once, he opened his television
show by saying: "Welcome to the Lou Holtz Show. Unfortunately, I'm Lou Holtz."
A golfer, the closest he says he has ever come to a hole in one is bogey.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the most laughter Holtz generated during a press conference the morning
Notre Dame officially became national champion was for saying: "I'll be shocked
if we have a good year (next season)."
</P>
<P>
When the chuckles stopped, Holtz quickly apologized. He knew us sainted scribes
could be fooled about a lot of things; he'd done a fair amount of the
slickering himself during this 12-0 season and before drubbing West Virginia in
the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
The sly coach said he understood how paid skeptics could recoil at such
apparent folly, that he would be startled if the gifted and experienced Irish
did much more next season than get each cleat on the proper foot.
</P>
<P>
He'd have laughed, too, Holtz admitted. Then he asked his frequent foils to
understand his position, which he never bothered to explain because he already
had done that a half-hour earlier. Indirectly. By quoting a high-school coach.
</P>
<P>
Holtz had talked about recruiting a player for Notre Dame. During a visit with
the prospect's coach, Holtz asked why he had enjoyed such uninterrupted
success. That nationally obscure high-school coach said: "We don't get bored
watching us run the same play over and over."
</P>
<P>
Boredom is the crabgrass of careers -- and Holtz knows it. That's why he rails
at his players, pushes his staff and himself so hard. He also says: "If we're
No. 1, I don't care who's No. 2."
</P>
<P>
To stay on top, Holtz has got to remain infatuated over the possibilities with
a football, even though all you can really do is throw it, catch it, run it,
keep from dropping it and make sure the other guys don't spike it in the end
zone too often.
</P>
<P>
With regards to that last thing, Holtz wants a kinder, gentler Notre Dame
defense than the one nailed for so much unsportsmanlike conduct during the
34-21 rout of West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
The coach even got a penalty, for dashing onto the field in the final minutes,
with victory well in hand. He was not grasping for Irish necks, only for the
source of that rare lack of Irish poise.
</P>
<P>
Holtz said his players were angry over being held, and frustrated that the
officials seemed so inattentive. The coach said his players were wrong, but not
cheap-shotters. Except for once, when a West Virginia player caught a touchdown
pass and the Notre Dame defender tried to shove him into Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
"I promise you this," Holtz said. "You won't see that again."
</P>
<P>
To keep the supply line of pure hearts, massive bodies, swift feet and keen
minds moving toward South Bend, Ind., Holts must remember to forget a popular
notion: Notre Dame doesn't recruit so much as it crooks a finger.
</P>
<P>
If Holtz wants to claim a national title on the field somewhere down the line,
he must be a winner in the right living rooms these next several weeks. Every
mother's meal must be a classic; no father's botched effort at humor can bring
anything but merriment from a master storyteller.

Holtz stays lean, he jokes, so he'll be easier to carry off the field.
Actually, he admits, the reason for all those pre-game milkshakes is a problem
with low blood sugar. Whatever, he looks hungry and talks as though near
starvation about next season.
</P>
<P>
"In everything we do," he said, "we've got to raise it a notch." With that in
mind, Holtz phoned prospects not long after the victory that kept Notre Dame
atop the polls; he met with quarterback Tony Rice early the next morning and
used a sermon he also will preach often to others:
</P>
<P>
"Now we'll find out how we all handle success." The team, and Rice most
especially, "won't be in the background any more."
</P>
<P>
The coach has been tough on Rice during practice and severe about him in
public. Rice ought to be flattered, in a way, because the coach treats his
quarterback in public no less affectionately than the coach does his wife.
</P>
<P>
Holtz has said: "We were at a beach one summer, and I had a bathing suit on. My
wife looked at me and said: 'Boy, you are skinny, aren't you?' I said: 'Honey,
I'd like to remind you that it was minor defects like this that kept me from
getting a better wife.' "
</P>
<P>
The team also was a tease, late in the third quarter against West Virginia. Two
plays after surrendering a touchdown that had narrowed the lead to 26-13, Rice
threw an interception that gave the Mountaineers the ball at the Notre Dame 26.
</P>
<P>
West Virginia had the ball for three plays. It didn't get a touchdown; it
didn't get a field goal. What happened was a Mountaineers' trip backwards that
ended with, of all deflating things, a punt followed by an 80-yard Notre Dame
burst for another touchdown.
</P>
<P>
Holtz had fussed before the game: "We cannot flinch." Nobody did, and Holtz
will have trouble fooling even the dullest minds from now on.
</P>
<P>
He might try and hide his obsession behind self-deprecating one-liners, but who
will believe him? Holtz insists he never dreamed of winning a national title,
yet he had a bailout clause in his contract at Minnesota for the job he now
has.
</P>
<P>
Any coach who wants so badly to coach at Notre Dame also wants to join Rockne
and Leahy in Notre Dame history. The ordinary-looking fellow with Olympian
ambition seems to be saying, as Notre Damers did when they peeked behind those
thick glasses and saw genius: let the gains begin.

<HEAD>DeBartolo Family Gives $33 Million to Notre Dame</HEAD>

   Developers Edward J. DeBartolo and his
son, Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., have donated $33 million to the
University of Notre Dame, one of the largest gifts ever made to an
American university.
   Most of the money will be spent in construction of a
computer-equipped classroom building and a performing arts center,
university board chairman Donald R. Keough, president of Coca-Cola
Co. Inc., said Thursday.
   Both DeBartolos are graduates of Notre Dame.
   The elder DeBartolo is founder of the Edward J. DeBartolo Corp.
headquartered in Youngstown, Ohio. His son is the company's chief
administrative officer. The corporation is one of the world's
largest developers of commercial and office property and owns three
shopping centers in Indianapolis.
   The gift is the largest contribution ever given Notre Dame and
the 18th largest to an American university. The largest gift was
$105 million given to Emory University in 1979 by Coca-Cola.
