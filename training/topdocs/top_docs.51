POP BEAT: BOB MARLEY'S LEGACY MIRED IN ESTATE BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN

<TEXT>
<P>
Almost eight years after his death, reggae master Bob Marley still stirs 
people's emotions. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, 6,000 fans are expected to gather at the Long Beach Arena for the 
seventh annual Bob Marley Day concert honoring the legacy of Marley, who died 
of cancer on May 11, 1981. The concert, which begins at 2 p.m., features a bill 
headlined by veteran reggae stars Burning Spear and Judy Mowatt. 
</P>
<P>
On a larger scale, the reggae sound that Marley popularized continues to make 
commercial inroads in this country. UB40's "Red Red Wine" recently became the 
first reggae single to top the Billboard pop chart, while Bobby McFerrin's 
"Don't Worry, Be Happy" was another surprise reggae-tinged success. 
</P>
<P>
The "Conscious Party" album by Marley's eldest son, Ziggy, and his Melody 
Makers band sold more than 500,000 copies, and when one of its selections, 
"Tumbling Down," hit the top of Billboard's black chart, Ziggy fulfilled a 
dream of his father's -- reaching the previously reggae-resistant black market. 
</P>
<P>
But Ziggy Marley's success and the increasingly rosy picture for reggae overall 
have camouflaged a bitter court battle over Bob Marley's estate. On Dec. 30, 
Jamaica's Supreme Court approved the $8.2-million sale of the assets of the 
Marley estate -- including the Tuff Gong recording studio in Kingston, the 
merchandising rights to Marley's image and the publishing rights for his songs 
-- to a company headed by Island Records President Chris Blackwell. (The actual 
sale has been stayed pending appeals.) 
</P>
<P>
Top executives at Island Records, the label that released all of Marley's 
albums from 1973 until his death, declined to comment on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
The Jamaican-born Blackwell, who founded Island and championed Marley and 
reggae when both were still unknown quantities on the international pop scene, 
was quoted in the Jan. 21 issue of Billboard magazine as saying: "I just felt I 
was the most appropriate person to buy it and I was the only one willing to 
take on the assets in Jamaica." 
</P>
<P>
But some -- including Marley's mother, Cedella Booker -- have been critical of 
Blackwell's action. 
</P>
<P>
Booker, who unsuccessfully mounted a bid against Blackwell for the estate 
assets, has charged that Blackwell got the assets at a bargain-basement price 
(published reports have put the value at $30 million at the time of Marley's 
death) and also claimed that the sale was insufficiently publicized outside 
Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to stop this because no man can buy Bob -- he's priceless," she said 
in an interview. "We do want the estate to stay in the family, and I don't 
think outsiders should take over because it's a legacy that Bob left on the 
earth for his children and the world." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it was Marley's insistence on living his life according to his 
Rastafarian faith that left his mother, heirs and closest associates vulnerable 
to the manipulations of the "Babylon system" he castigated in his music. Marley 
didn't believe in wills and didn't leave one. 
</P>
<P>
Bad feelings still linger between Marley associates and his widow Rita -- whom 
Jamaican courts removed from her post administering the estate after 
allegations were made that she mishandled the assets. Members of Marley's 
longtime backing band, the Wailers, are currently embroiled in multimillion 
dollar suits against the Marley estate's former attorney and accountant for 
royalties the band members contend are owed them. 
</P>
<P>
And Cedella Booker is in threatened with eviction from her Miami home because 
the title remained in Marley's name -- even though all parties to the dispute 
acknowledge that it was purchased by Marley as a gift for his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I am disappointed in what has taken place but I still have a lot of room to 
rejoice," Booker said. "As it is said, sorrow may last for a night but joy come 
in at the morning. I know that the day will come when I shall be rejoicing, 
even when I'm going through sorrows now. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob said, 'Don't cry, every little thing is going to be all right,' so when I 
feel the tears coming down on these words, I quickly dry my tears or hold it 
back. I know I mustn't cry because Jah's (God's) will must be done." 
</P>
<P>
DEATH OF A JAGUAR: The diabetes-related death Sunday of Herman (Sonny) Chaney, 
for 35 years the lead singer of the L.A. vocal group the Jaguars, served to 
remind pop historians of an era of local music that has had impact all the way 
through the success of Los Lobos and the movie "La Bamba." Credited as being 
L.A.'s first integrated pop group, the group was a key player in forging the 
vibrant multicultural scene that gave rise to the likes of Ritchie Valens. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to play a lot at El Monte Legion Stadium, and the audiences were a 
good cross section of whites, Chicanos and blacks," recalled group member Manny 
Chavez this week of the group's '50s beginnings. "I don't think kids today even 
think in those terms; it's common to see racially mixed groups now. . . . But 
that was the begining of rock 'n' roll and they were all into the music, so 
they didn't care (that the group and audience was mixed)." 
</P>
<P>
The Jaguars were spurred to return to active performing in 1987 in part because 
of their song "Charlena's" featured appearance in the "La Bamba" score. 
</P>
<P>
Memorial services for Chaney, who last performed with the Jaguars as part of a 
"Legends of West Coast Doo-Wop" concert in November, will be held today at the 
McKinley Avenue Baptist Church, 5025 McKinley Ave. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
LIVE ACTION: Ratt will headline the Los Angeles Sport Arena on March 12. 
Tickets are on sale now. . . . On sale today is Living Colour at the Palace on 
Feb. 23. . . . Also new on the Palace schedule are Michelle Shocked on March 7 
and That Petrol Emotion on March 9. . . . Stryper's Universal Amphitheatre 
concert scheduled for Sunday has been postponed, due to an illness in the band.

Hey, it's Dave. Or Ziggy. Yeah, Bob's kid. David (Ziggy) Marley. Marley and his 
band, the Melody Makers, plus enough other musicians to cast a Cecil B. De 
Mille movie will headline the tree-lined and totally spiffy Santa Barbara 
County Bowl on Saturday night. Also on the bill will be the Family Stand and 
Crucial DBC. 
</P>
<P>
Reggae was popularized by Ziggy's father, Bob, who died of cancer in 1981 when 
Ziggy was 13. The Melody Makers originated around 1979 in Jamaica but became 
well known on a 1985 Bob Marley Memorial tour. 
</P>
<P>
Ziggy, tall and 17 with plenty of dreadlocks, emerged as the star of the tour 
and sang mostly his father's songs. Since then, Ziggy and the Melody Makers 
have recorded four albums, have sold zillions of copies worldwide and received 
two Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
Ziggy is making more money than Bob ever did. He probably needs to. Bob left 11 
children and no will. Rastafarians don't believe in them but lawyers sure do. 
After all the legal hassles, the estate was basically broke. But the family is 
very close. In fact, three siblings, Cedella, Stephen and Sharon, make up the 
Melody Makers. The majority of the backup musicians are from a Chicago-based 
Ethiopian reggae band, Dallol. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Marley's music is quite different than that of his famous father. 
It's not as ponderous and it incorporates pop, soul, rock, jazz and good ol' 
rhythm-and-blues. The current album, "One Bright Day," like the last one, 
"Conscious Party," was produced by Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth, the rhythm 
section from the Talking Heads. 
</P>
<P>
One thing that all reggae music has in common is its preachiness. Reggae is all 
about peace, love, justice and harmony -- the good stuff. According to Marley, 
"Reggae is a simple music -- but it's from the heart. Just as people need water 
to drink -- and buy it in bottles -- people also need music. If it is true 
music, then the people will be drawn to it. You don't have to worry if the 
music is filled with life's experiences." 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: Family Stand, Crucial DBC and Ziggy Marley and the Melody 
Makers will be appearing at The Santa Barbara County Bowl on Saturday. The Bowl 
is located at 1122 N. Milpas St., Santa Barbara, 966-2727. Tickets are $17.50, 
$19.50, $20.50 and $24.50. They are available at Ticketmaster locations, the 
Bowl box office, or by phone, 583-8700. Showtime is 6 p.m.

SECOND GENERATION PICKS UP THE TORCH FROM BOB MARLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It may be time for the record industry to look seriously at reggae again. 
</P>
<P>
The Jamaican style, spearheaded by the late Bob Marley, was touted as a "next 
big thing" 15 years ago, but it failed to make a pop breakthrough and was soon 
pigeonholed as a cult music. For many fans, the last hope ended with Marley's 
death in 1981. To them, Marley was reggae. 
</P>
<P>
But the capacity turnout of 11,000 for the Bob Marley Day concert Sunday at the 
Long Beach Arena -- more than double the attendance at last year's event at the 
Santa Monica Civic -- indicated that reggae has spawned a sizable 
second-generation audience. 
</P>
<P>
While Marley remains a revered figurehead, this new audience -- much of it of 
high school and college age -- is embracing new heroes, including Marley's 
teen-age son, Ziggy, and England's UB40. This young audience also seems 
attracted by reggae's distinctive, almost communal feeling (much of the arena 
lobby was filled with the crafts displays that are a familiar part of large 
reggae gatherings). 
</P>
<P>
UB40's "Sing Our Own Song" could be an anthem embodying the second generation's 
experience as perfectly as the Bob Marley-Peter Tosh classic "Get Up Stand Up" 
did for the earlier reggae fans. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Mowatt, in fact, performed "Sing Our Own Song," though she slipped it in 
early in her 45-minute set rather than saving it for a triumphant finale. But 
the former backing singer for Marley still offered the most striking blend of 
contemporary and classic reggae on the eight hour-plus bill, which also 
featured Daddy U-Roy, Al Campbell, Haile Maskel and Matuzalem. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, Mowatt's sophisticated arrangements blended '60s girl-group 
harmonies, dance-hall toasting (Jamaican rapping) and American-style rapping 
without ever sounding artificial or forced. 
</P>
<P>
Working with a local band rather than a regular unit eliminated some of her 
subtle intricacies. Yet Mowatt's soaring voice (reminiscent of Martha Reeves') 
smoothed over the rough patches. 
</P>
<P>
Pato Banton, the young British toaster who was the only second-generation 
artist featured, could do no wrong for the crowd during his hourlong set. But 
his performance foundered on the question facing reggae's up-and-coming 
artists: Can they write songs as memorable as those of their predecessors? 
</P>
<P>
Banton operated in a slick, rock-influenced dance-hall style, but seemed more 
concerned with -- and was more successful at -- pushing his personality than 
making significant music. 
</P>
<P>
Although some of his socially conscious themes were laudable (anti-apartheid, 
anti-cocaine), the presentation was often trite -- as on the sing-along of 
"What the World Needs Now Is Love." Banton claimed that he helped pioneer 
England's rapid-fire "fast talking" deejay style, but it doesn't matter how 
fast you say something if you don't have much to say. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, you could be Burning Spear, a.k.a. Winston Rodney, whose voice 
alone is unforgettable. The veteran Jamaican singer displayed the liquid, 
grainy voice that gives him the authoritative air of a village elder entrusted 
with handing the tradition down. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Banton's, his 90-minute set made minimal concessions to show-biz ritual. 
A "do you want a sing-along?" query during "Slavery Days" was less an 
invitation than a challenge -- reminiscent of Robert DeNiro's "you talkin' to 
me?" line in "Taxi Driver." 
</P>
<P>
Even as the event celebrated Marley's birthday (he would have been 44 on 
Monday), the energy of the artists and the audience seemed to point to the 
future. The influx of young fans, who are growing up with their own heroes, may 
well be helping reggae move out of Marley's shadow.

POP BEAT / REGGAE: SETTLEMENT OF $30-MILLION BOB MARLEY ESTATE IS ANTICIPATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER STEFFENS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nine years after the death of reggae patriarch Bob Marley, it appears that a 
major settlement of the legal disputes surrounding his $30-million estate is in 
the works. 
</P>
<P>
This could mean the release of a major body of his work: more than 100 singles 
that have never been collected on albums, as well as a significant amount of 
unreleased recordings. 
</P>
<P>
Among the unreleased tracks are some songs that have long been legend in reggae 
circles, including "High Tide Low Tide," a hymn to his mother, and "I Know a 
Place Where We Can Carry On," which Marley wrote in 1978 after discovering he 
had cancer. The first releases may come before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Blackwell, president of Island Records and the man who helped establish 
Marley as an international star in the '70s, confirmed the broad outline of the 
proposed arrangements last week from his New York headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the final stages of negotiations right now. We've lined up virtually 
all of Bob's baby-mothers, along with his wife, Rita, and Mrs. Booker, Bob's 
mother," Blackwell said. (Baby-mother is the Caribbean term for the unwed 
mother of a man's children.) 
</P>
<P>
Central to the settling of accounts is the disposition of Tuff Gong, the 
company founded by Marley and his bandmates in the Wailers, Peter Tosh and 
Bunny Wailer, in 1970. When Marley succumbed to cancer on May 11, 1981, at 36, 
his widow Rita Marley assumed control of the company. But in 1986, the Jamaican 
government, which had taken over the estate, forced her to resign her post with 
the company and as executrix of the estate after revelations in court that she 
had been coerced into signing a false will. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the government appointed banker Louis Byles to take charge of the 
Marley holdings. The tiny flow of unreleased works, which had been initiated by 
Rita Marley, ground to a halt. Her country home was auctioned in the pages of 
the Jamaican Gleaner newspaper to pay back taxes, and she was indicted for tax 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Blackwell has already moved into Tuff Gong. "One of the initial things we've 
done is to close down the company to begin its complete reorganization. I plan 
to put in my own management team as soon as possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1989, the Jamaican government sold the entire Marley estate to 
Blackwell for $8.4 million. The sale was immediately challenged by Marley's 
mother and several others, with the final appeal scheduled last January in 
England's Privy Council. 
</P>
<P>
At the last minute, Blackwell was able to postpone the hearing while he 
attempted to reach a settlement with the many interested parties. These include 
Rita Marley, Bob Marley's mother Cedella Booker, his 11 children by seven 
women, various former co-workers and band members, and music publishers. 
</P>
<P>
In February, the broad outlines of the plan began to emerge. Blackwell would 
assume control of all of Marley's recordings; his properties in various 
countries; his likeness, and more. 
</P>
<P>
Once his assumption of the estate is approved by the Privy Council, Blackwell 
says he will turn it all over to a nonprofit Bob Marley Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
One person exhilarated by the apparent settling of most of the controversies is 
Marley's mother, Cedella Booker, who has gained title to her spacious Miami 
house as part of the resolution. Mrs. Booker also owns a great deal of the land 
in Nine Mile, the rural village in northern Jamaica where Bob was born and is 
buried. Blackwell has plans for the property. 
</P>
<P>
"We are currently looking into the feasibility of moving the Bob Marley museum 
there," he said. "And of course we will need other buildings nearby to 
accommodate the visitors in a properly organized way." 
</P>
<P>
Other ideas include a recording studio in Trenchtown, the Kingston slum that is 
the setting for many of Marley's songs. The facility would be geared to helping 
Jamaican youths learn music. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rita and her lawyer and accountant are still scheduled to go to 
trial in Jamaica on a $16-million fraud charge. 
</P>
<P>
"I welcome this opportunity," Rita Marley said earlier this year in Los 
Angeles. "It will force the government to show everyone just how they have been 
mishandling the estate since they took it away from me five years ago."

ZIGGY MARLEY LIVELIES UP HIMSELF IN THE NICK OF TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ziggy Marley did not wait a minute too long to dip into his father's songbook 
for "Lively Up Yourself." 
</P>
<P>
The first few songs of the nearly two-hour set Saturday at Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre by the Melody Makers slid by uneventfully, with proficient but 
colorless renditions of material from the band's current "A Bright Day" album. 
</P>
<P>
But the charged rendition of the celebratory "Lively Up Yourself," the only Bob 
Marley tune the Melody Makers performed Saturday, galvanized the performance. 
</P>
<P>
The Melody Makers band is made up of four singers: Ziggy, Steven and Cedella 
Marley, all children of Bob Marley, plus Sharon Prendergast. They are backed up 
by the instrumental band Dallol, which followed up the "Lively Up" high point 
by locking into the ominous, rolling groove of "Lee and Molly." When lead 
guitarist Earl (Chinna) Smith ripped off an unusually raucous solo, the Melody 
Makers were on their way to a set that visited far more peaks than valleys. 
</P>
<P>
The early section had foundered as much on Ziggy's lack of animation as any 
inherent weakness in the material (although the songs on "One Bright Day" do 
generally lack the catchiness of the Melody Makers' breakthrough "Conscious 
Party" album). Dressed in a loose, mismatched ensemble that sported 
Afro-Caribbean prints in black and white on the tunic and in red and gold on 
the pants, Ziggy came across as a distant performer who did not seem concerned 
with making audience contact. 
</P>
<P>
That initial impression may have stemmed from the difference between his 
performing style and that of his late father. Where Bob Marley functioned as 
the shaman-like visionary and projected that spirit to the audience, Ziggy cut 
a more private, Sphinx-like figure who required the audience Saturday to come 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
But he did progressively loosen up; the catalyst was the powerful support of 
his eight-piece band. Smith's raw-edged tone repeatedly injected added 
electricity into the arrangements. Ziggy took particular delight in the 
frequent "dub" excursions featuring the potent rhythm section of drummer 
Raphael W'Mariam and bassist Zeleke Gessesse. 
</P>
<P>
The Melody Makers are still a youthful unit, so the performance periodically 
suffered from rough stretches, such as the melodic fussiness afflicting some 
tunes and the overextended arrangements plaguing others. Prendergast and 
Cedella Marley (joined by a third vocalist) chipped in with sharp backing 
vocals and nonstop dancing, but the group needs to find something for Steven 
Marley to do other than wander around the stage, add very occasional snatches 
of percussion and sing a couple of songs. 
</P>
<P>
But Ziggy remained the focal point. In the ongoing speculation over whether he 
is filling his father's footsteps, what gets lost in the shuffle is that Ziggy 
is just 20 years old. The almost exclusively teen-age makeup of the crowd 
Saturday made it obvious that Ziggy is successfully talkin' to his generation 
-- the tomorrow people, not the reggae crowd that was fired and inspired by Bob 
Marley. Songs like "Tomorrow People," "Tumbling Down," "Pains of Life" and 
"Black My Story" are dealing with (or at least introducing in rudimentary 
fashion) some universal themes and major issues. 
</P>
<P>
Far better Ziggy Marley as a model than Pato Banton, whose well-received 
opening set included a brief cameo appearance by Ranking Roger, the former 
vocalist with the English Beat and General Public. Banton is a slick, 
personable reggae cartoon who relied on a kinetic stage presence and 
interminable audience participation numbers that plumbed the lowest common 
denominator of reggae cliches. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, he "challenged" the audience by shouting, "Do you people out 
there believe in freedom?" Way to ask the really tough questions, Pato.

Like John Lennon, the late Bob Marley was a visionary, unifying performer who 
could have accomplished much more had his life not been cut short. But it also 
couldn't be argued that the performers didn't do enough while they were alive. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about a Beatles reunion, Lennon once unleashed his sarcasm, asking if we 
really needed them to get up on that cross again -- weren't we paying attention 
the first time? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps not, for both Ziggy Marley and Julian Lennon have been stuck by 
listeners with the unenviable task of establishing their own art while cloaked 
in their fathers' ghosts. 
</P>
<P>
While the younger Lennon seems to have stumbled under that burden, Ziggy and 
the Melody Makers' (featuring other Marley offspring Steve and Cedella Marley 
and Sharon Pendergast) Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre show Sunday did justice to 
their legacy while delivering their own music with a contemporary vitality. 
</P>
<P>
While Ziggy's controlled stage presence couldn't be confused with the 
commanding live-wire immediacy of his dad, he nevertheless offered a solid, 
propulsive set drawn from 1988's "Conscious Party" and last year's "One Fine 
Day" albums. 
</P>
<P>
Lacking the demanding rough edges of the elder Marley, and buoyed by the 
exuberant youth of the Melody Makers -- sisters Cedella and Sharon dance like 
wildcats on a hot plate -- they have reached a larger U.S. audience than their 
father ever did. 
</P>
<P>
On most of their 14 songs a modern, energetic dance pulse was joined with 
socially conscious lyrics. Those lyrics weren't always up to the weight of the 
subject matter, as on "Black My Story (Not History)" which bit toothlessly at 
the truncated European view of African history taught in schools. Even Marley's 
resurrection of a Haile Selassie speech -- a staple of his father's 
performances -- seemed stilted and flat. 
</P>
<P>
But that was the exception amid the Marleys' uptown reggae grooves. Backed by a 
tight seven-piece band, they upped the octane of the album versions of 
"Tumblin' Down," "Look Who's Dancing," the unconditional "All Love" and the 
1985 track "Reggae is Now." 
</P>
<P>
The strongest of the original material was "Tomorrow People," which, with its 
incantation of "If you don't know your past, don't know your future" took on a 
particular resonance as performed to the largely young audience. 
</P>
<P>
Marley delivered a charged version of the late Marley's "Get Up, Stand Up" 
(with brother Steve handling Peter Tosh's mid-song rap) as well as a 
goose-bump-inducing encore of the meditative "Redemption Song." 
</P>
<P>
Opener Eek-a-Mouse has a unique, novel style of toasting (the Jamaican 
precursor of rap), sounding like a cross between Porky Pig, a tobacco 
auctioneer and a "Battlestar Galactica" Cylon warrior. But that wore mighty 
thin over his hourlong set. 
</P>
<P>
While it did get the crowd moving, his syllabic splatter, dead-simple reggae 
riffs and stork-like stage moves undermined whatever import the lanky singer 
might have intended for such numbers as "Terrorists in the City." 
</P>
<P>
Brooklyn's Family Stand, however, could have easily filled more than the brief 
35 minutes they were allotted. With their dance hit "Ghetto Heaven" as the 
centerpiece of their five songs, the septet offered a strong set of Sly 
Stone-derived soul and funk, resplendent with heavy bass lines, wah-wah guitars 
and cat-meow vocals.

<TEXT>
   At the age of 19, reggae artist Ziggy Marley has
seen enough of the world to know he wants to change it.
   ``I am not blind,'' Marley says. ``Even in Jamaica, injustice
happened. It happened all over the world. It means something all
over the world.''
   On the Melody Makers' new album, ``Conscious Party,'' Marley
sings of oppression, bigotry and hope for a better world.
   For anyone who follows reggae music, Marley's political
consciousness should come as no surprise. The late Bob Marley,
Ziggy's father, was reggae's most celebrated artist and famous for
such protest songs as ``Get Up, Stand Up'' and ``I Shot the
Sheriff.''
   But while acknowledging the legacy of his father, Ziggy Marley
is determined to establish his own identity. ``I want to be
fulfilled myself rather than try to follow exactly in my father's
footsteps.''
   Marley was born on October 17, 1968, in Trenchtown, an
impoverished section of Kingston in Jamaica. When he was 11, he
formed the Melody Makers along with his brother, Stevie, and
sisters, Cedella and Sharon.
   The Melody Makers' first song, ``Children Playing in the
Streets,'' was written by their father. In 1985, they released
their first album, ``Play the Game Right,'' which received a Grammy
nomination for best reggae record. In 1986, they released the album
``Hey World.''
   ``We're brothers and sisters,'' Marley said. ``Doing music was
part of being a family.''
   ``Hey World'' contained such overtly political songs as the
anti-apartheid ``666,'' and on the new album, he continues to
confront injustice with songs such as ``Tomorrow People,'' the
first single to be released.
   ``Tomorrow People, think of your past,'' he sings, attacking
those who think only of the future and their indifference to
humanity.
   ``The original idea was from robots, like the movie `Robocop' _
people becoming androids,'' Marley said. ``Scientists are making
dangerous things.''
   Although ``Conscious Party'' is only Marley's third album, he is
already attracting the attention of some of the music industry's
most highly acclaimed artists. Talking Heads members Chris Frantz
and Tina Weymouth produced the record and Rolling Stones guitarist
Keith Richards plays on the song ``Lee and Molly.''
   ``Lee and Molly'' is a story about racial bigotry. Lee is a
white man who dates Molly, a black woman, and is beaten up by his
father because of the relationship. The song is based on an actual
couple who went to high school in Kingston with Cedella Marley.
``He (Lee's father) thought going out with Molly set a bad
example,'' Cedella recalled.
   Ziggy Marley identifies strongly with the people of Africa. On
``Tumbling Down,'' he uses the symbols of the Eagle, the Bear and
the Lion to warn against the consequences of superpower oppression
of the third world.
   ``The Eagle is the United States and their allies. The Bear is
the Soviet Union because of what they've done in Ethiopia and
Afghanistan,'' Marley said. ``The Lion is Africa. Bad things are
done against my people. Consequences will come down on you.''
   Marley also sings about Africa on the ballad ``Dream of Home.''
   ``Home is Africa,'' Marley said. ``We know that's where we
originated from. We have to get rid of (South African President
P.W.) Botha. Through ourselves, our music, we fight apartheid.
   ``New Love'' is the album's only love song, although it's more
about the spiritual quality of love rather than a particular person.
   ``My love is always new; it shouldn't get boring,'' Marley said.
``Love can hurt you, like Lee and Molly. But new love is like the
sun rising. Like the morning dew.''
   Marley is a Rastafarian and religion plays an important role in
his life and music. On ``A Who a Sey,'' he attacks those who do not
share his belief in a higher being.
   ``My religion is a way of life. If I please Jah (God), I will
please many more people,'' he said.
   The Melody Makers started touring in 1975 and have appeared at
shows with Stevie Wonder, The Clash, the late Peter Tosh and Jimmy
Cliff. They performed at Reggae Sunsplash last August in Jamaica.
With a worldwide tour scheduled to begin in April, Marley is
anxious to play his new songs in front of a live audience.
   ``It's like relating to people. Like me talking to you,'' Marley
said. ``That is where the people feel the music and feel with you.
I'm dealing with people.''
   Marley hopes his music will help bring about his vision for a
better world.
   ``We have the obvious,'' he said. ``No war. No pollution. A
better life for human beings. No prejudice. Everybody has an
opportunity. Everybody has the basic things.
   ``People say they live and then die. I don't believe in death.
We believe in live and live. We believe in life. We are the
people.''

<LEADPARA>  'I WANTED to change everything with this album," says Ziggy Marley in his
thick Jamaican accent. "I just wanted it to be different. When we were
recording, I would say, 'That sounds too like me, let's try something new.' I
wanted to . . . stir it up.";    And that's exactly what happens with the new
Virgin Records release from Ziggy Marley &amp; the Melody Makers, punningly titled
"Jahmekya." The Melody Makers themselves -- Ziggy, brother Stephen, and
sisters Sharon and Cedella -- produced the disc with engineer Glenn
Rosenstein. Renting a mobile digital studio, they parked it outside Tuff Gong
studios in Jamaica, where the band cut the basic tracks live.  </LEADPARA>

ROOTS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Music  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The sonic effects yielded by the overdubs are more far-reaching than on
previous Melody Maker efforts. The beats rove from steady-state old-style
reggae to driving funk. The instrumental mixes change even more than on the
group's 1989 album, "One Bright Day," which broadly expanded on its debut
disc, "Conscious Party." Lending background vocals are mother Rita, still
Ziggy's manager, and grandmother Cedella.;    As for father Bob Marley, whom
Ziggy has always credited as his main influence to "stir it up," he makes
ghostly cameos -- as a sample during "Drastic," and through Stephen Marley's
hip-hop-inflected cover of "Rainbow Country," sung with the same passionately
rough-hewn, eerily Bob-like vocalizing that first stunned listeners coming
from brother Ziggy.;    "I wanted Stephen more in the forefront," says Ziggy,
"because people are always talking about Ziggy, Ziggy, Ziggy, but I want to
make sure everyone knows it's not just me.";    The appeal to his father's
enormous legacy is part of a deliberate effort to turn contemporary reggae's
thrust back toward political stances. "People are always coming up to me after
shows and all," explains Ziggy, "to say how they were touched by his messages.
So I wanted to make his songs for now.;    "Anytime I listen to music, I
always sing along with the lyrics," Ziggy continues.;    "The music I hear in
the clubs now is always dance hall, and it has no real messages. It's music
without consciousness," he adds. "But you can dance to music with
consciousness, too, like my father's. It can change people, and make them
change their lives. The politicians don't want that; everywhere they're no
good. But the listeners have to act on what they hear and make it happen.";   
One group Marley wants to get more involved with his music is
African-Americans. "Most of the people who come to my concerts in America are
white or Jamaican," he says. "I blame it on the marketing by the record
company. Maybe they feel they'll make more money that way. But I'm trying to
get them to give us more marketing on black radio.";    The Melody Makers will
make a European tour in June and July, then hit the U.S. concert circuit in
August.  </TEXT>

Marcia Griffiths didn't expect the second coming of the Electric Boogie. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran reggae singer, a member of the I-Threes vocal group that backed Bob 
Marley for years, released a record called "Electric Boogie" in 1983. But the 
single wasn't successful outside the reggae scene and didn't even become a 
fixture in her own concert repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
After a Washington deejay began playing the record last summer, other stations 
picked up on the song, and Griffiths suddenly found herself with a runaway hit 
in the nation's capital that spawned a club dance craze, the electric slide. 
</P>
<P>
Island Records released a re-mixed version of the single last summer, and it 
has been hovering in recent weeks around the Top 50 of the Billboard pop 
charts. 
</P>
<P>
The delayed success of "Electric Boogie" is part of a bigger story: Largely 
dismissed within record-industry circles as a Next-Big-Thing-That-Never-Was 
after the 1981 death of Bob Marley, the music's greatest star, reggae is 
enjoying a renewed popularity. 
</P>
<P>
It's still an underground music, but there are undeniable signs that the 
Jamaican style is on the upswing: more major-label deals for reggae artists, 
steadily increasing sales for reggae-oriented labels, and the arrival of a new 
generation of performers and fans. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the '70s, when the reggae world was caught in the spell of Bob Marley, 
the music's fortunes no longer seem tied to an individual. While the success of 
his son Ziggy's 1988 album "Conscious Party" was a crucial catalyst, most 
observers agree that the new reggae audience broadly supports the music as a 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
"There's more hope now for reggae than I've seen in the years since Bob died," 
said Roger Steffens, a former co-host of KCRW-FM's influential "Reggae Beat" 
program. "There is fresh new blood, there are people without long memories and 
people willing to take it to a new stream. That's healthy." 
</P>
<P>
The resurgence was brought home forcefully last February when the annual Bob 
Marley Day salute filled the 12,000-capacity Long Beach Arena. For longtime 
reggae observers who had been there at the beginning and seen the 1982 
celebration in MacArthur Park featuring local bands and drawing perhaps 1,000 
people, the Long Beach sellout was a shocker. 
</P>
<P>
This year's Bob Marley Day concert, scheduled today from 1:30 to 8 p.m., will 
again be at the Long Beach Arena, where another sellout is expected. The lineup 
includes the original Black Uhuru (Don Carlos, Garth Dennis and Duckie 
Simpson), the Mighty Diamonds, Shinehead and Tippa Irie. 
</P>
<P>
This rise in reggae's fortunes is especially dramatic in view of the pop 
industry's pessimism about the commercial viability of the music after Marley's 
1981 cancer death. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a definite lull after Bob's death because it was almost like reggae 
had not only lost its founding father but its leader," said Los Angeles deejay 
Ron Miller. "They were looking for somebody else to spearhead the movement, and 
no one came along that could fill those shoes. What took the leadership role 
was the music itself." 
</P>
<P>
The shock waves from Marley's death even affected some of reggae's strongest 
champions within the record industry. It was one of the factors that caused 
Chris Blackwell, whose Island Records label initially brought Marley and reggae 
to the world, to back away from the music during the early '80s. But now 
Blackwell sees interest in the music rising again. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's been brought about by Ziggy, who has become a real point of focus 
and leader," Blackwell said, by phone from Jamaica. "That was what reggae was 
lacking for some time. He brought some attention to himself and through that to 
the music and other artists." 
</P>
<P>
The figures may not be dramatic by rap or even underground rock standards, but 
the revitalized spirit in reggae is being reflected in record stores and 
concert sales. 
</P>
<P>
* Producer Tony Johnson started the Reggae Sunsplash festival in 1978 to 
provide a live showcase for reggae in Jamaica. Johnson took Sunsplash to London 
in 1984, and two years later started the package tours in America that are 
bringing the music into new markets. This year's Sunsplash tour should hit 
Southern California in May. 
</P>
<P>
* Rick Hocutt, vice president of California Record Distributors in Glendale, 
said that West Coast sales on Heartbeat and Mango, the small labels that have 
released the bulk of reggae records here during the '80s, have doubled in the 
last two years. Mango, for example, jumped from 96,000 in 1988 to 169,000 in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
* Real Authentic Sounds (RAS) Records, the Washington-based label that provides 
American distribution for 30 to 40 Jamaican labels, increased its sales by 50% 
last year from 1.2 million to 1.8 million. RAS founder Gary Himelfarb expects 
to crack the 2-million unit barrier this year, but he doesn't view the 
increased sales as a sign of mainstream acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, reggae and mainstream are oxymorons because reggae is an underground 
type music," he said. "It's for people who have deep feelings for humanity, and 
a lot of people don't want to be burdened with what's wrong with this world and 
how to make it better." 
</P>
<P>
There are other signs of reggae's vitality: the wide array of talent, a variety 
of reggae styles and reggae's penetration of the American pop mainstream, even 
beyond its influence on hits like Bobby McFerrin's "Don't Worry, Be Happy." 
</P>
<P>
But the most dramatic new development is that reggae, which has primarily 
attracted a white, rock-oriented crowd, may finally be making inroads with the 
African-American audience that has long resisted it. Ziggy Marley's "Tumbling 
Down" reached No. 1 on the black singles chart, a first for a reggae artist 
here, and director Spike Lee included Steel Pulse's "Can't Stand It" in his 
acclaimed "Do the Right Thing" film. 
</P>
<P>
More intriguingly, a fusion of reggae and hip-hop has surfaced in the last six 
months. Shinehead's canny blend of the two styles on his 1988 album "Unity" was 
the first portent, and now Sly &amp; Robbie's "Silent Assassin" collaboration 
with rap producer KRS-One has accelerated the momentum. 
</P>
<P>
"Aspects of the reggae rhythm are a tremendous dynamic in the hip-hop field, 
and that's starting to merge with rap culture," said Blackwell of Island 
Records. "Early Jamaican deejay records were somewhat of a precursor of rap 
music, so there's a lot in common in those two attitudes to music." 
</P>
<P>
The situation for live reggae in Los Angeles is volatile. The Rebel Rockers are 
familiar with the ups and downs common to American reggae bands -- record label 
interest that faded away after Marley's death and offers from producers who 
were willing to work with them . . . if they changed their sound. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Beach-based quintet went directly to the source, recording and 
releasing a few singles on Jamaican labels and even appearing twice at the 
Reggae Sunsplash event there. 
</P>
<P>
New-breed Los Angeles artists are making headway by releasing their own records 
and plugging into reggae's international tour circuit. Vocalist Swelele went to 
Japan for three months last year and is starting to attract major-label 
attention after several singles for local labels. 
</P>
<P>
Boom Shaka's "Creation" album was picked up by Celluloid Records last year 
after the group initially released it on its own label. They toured Europe and 
introduced live reggae to Tunisia at a government-supported cultural festival 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I listen to Bob Marley, I hear Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye, so 
he was influenced by the things that were around him at that time," said Trevy, 
lead singer for Boom Shaka. 
</P>
<P>
"To even think about looking for a new Marley is madness. That's like looking 
for another Jimi Hendrix or John Coltrane -- it can't be. Those people just 
come like a falling star and you can't duplicate a situation like that."

REGGAE TAKES THE HIGHER GROUND IN WAILERS' HANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With the death of the charismatic Bob Marley in 1980, reggae lost much of its 
luster, and its popularity seemed to be on the wane for several years. 
</P>
<P>
But with the emergence of such groups as Grammy-winning Ziggy Marley &amp; the 
Melody Makers -- a group composed of Marley's children -- and such recent hits 
as UB40's "Red Red Wine," reggae is no longer on the decline. On the contrary, 
it shows signs of finally earning real, broad-based popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night at the Universal Amphitheatre, on a program that will repeat 
tonight at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, the Wailers -- formerly Bob 
Marley's backup band -- played an hour-plus set that was long on fire and 
urgency and even showed an occasional burst of high-spirited invention. 
</P>
<P>
Percussionist Irvin (Carrot) Jarrett danced like a man possessed, his nearly 
waist-long dreadlocks whipping the air as the band took Marley's signature 
"Exodus" to higher ground. 
</P>
<P>
Lead singer Junior Marvin, smoothly assured and authoritative in his dapper 
white suit, revved up the crowd on "I Shot the Sheriff" (though a mid-song plea 
to "free James Brown!" merely drew polite applause). 
</P>
<P>
Bob Marley often expressed dismay that his music never attracted a sizable 
black following in the United States, so it's noteworthy that the audience at 
the Universal contained young black reggae fans who were children when Marley 
was at the peak of his fame in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Third World, the headline band, played a set that was longer on energy than on 
merit. They espoused Bishop Desmond Tutu's opposition to apartheid at the end 
of a song that urged listeners to let the "reggae jam boogie getta hold of 
you." Talk about a philosophical stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Third World has gained favor with black record buyers on the strength of the 
vibrant, Stevie Wonder-produced "Try Jah Love" and a great, reggae-powered 
version of the O'Jays' "Now That We Found Love." 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday they concentrated on new material. The new songs sounded fine, 
but "Now That We've Found Love" they're not. 
</P>
<P>
The Wailers and Third World play tonight at 8 and 10:30 at the Coach House, 
33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $25. Information: (714) 
496-8930.

<HEAD>Jamaican Court Orders Sale of Marley Estate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Appeals Court ordered on Tuesday
that reggae singer Bob Marley's estate be sold for $8.6 million to
the New York-based recording company Island Logic.
   Marley's widow, reggae singer Rita Marley, and lawyers for his 11
children had argued that the price was too low and appealed earlier
approval of the sale by the estate's administrator, a Kingston bank.
   Marley, 36, died of cancer in May 1981 in a Miami hospital
without leaving a will.
   Judge Ira Rowe upheld the sale and ordered that Island Logic pay
for the estate at once and not over a 10-year period as proposed
originally.
   Assets include Marley's song catalogs valued at $5.3 million, $3
million in recording royalties and record distribution rights,
recording equipment, and real estate in Jamaica.
   Marley was survived by his mother, his wife and their four
children, and seven other children born to seven different women.
   On Feb. 22, his four children by his wife, who perform as Ziggy
Marley and the Melody Makers, won the reggae music section of the
Grammy awards in Los Angeles with their album ``Conscious Party.''

   Sixteen years ago, Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh and
Robert Marley released ``Catch a Fire.'' The album catapulted the
reggae trio to international fame.
   A world tour followed. But Wailer, who is more at home in the
hills of his native Jamaica than the concert stage, returned home
and vowed never to go on the road again.
   The mystical mountain man busied himself writing and recording
songs on his own label, Solomonic, and farmed the land at the same
time.
   ``I think I love the country actually a little bit more than the
city,'' Wailer said. ``It has more to do with life, health and
strength. The city takes that away sometimes. The country is good
for meditation. It has fresh food and fresh atmosphere _ that keeps
you going.''
   This year, he launched a tour to support his ``Liberation'' LP,
which took him to 13 cities in the United States.
   His recent performance at Radio City Music Hall with the Switch
Dance Troupe marked his first New York appearance since selling out
Madison Square Garden in a solo concert nearly three years ago.
   Wailer was born Neville O'Reilly Livingston 42 years ago. His
career began in 1963 in a Kingston, Jamaica slum when he and his
childhood friend, Robert Nesta Marley, teamed with Winston Hubert
McIntosh, later to be known as Peter Tosh, to form the legendary
group, the Wailers.
   After the release of their first hit, ``Simmer Down'' in 1964,
the Wailers' popularity spread throughout Jamaica. By 1966, they had
five records in the Jamaican Top 10. But the pulsating sound of
reggae went largely unnoticed by the rest of the world until the
``Catch a Fire'' LP.
   On their first tour, they met thunderous applause as audiences
throughout the world jammed stadiums, packed concert and theater
stages and lined dance halls to catch a glimpse of those ``natty
dreadlocks'' from Jamaica.
   While Marley and Tosh lost no time blazing international trails
for themselves, Wailer headed for the Jamaican countryside to be
close to nature.
   Marley, whose ``I Shot the Sheriff'' was covered by such rockers
as Eric Clapton, and who had become the biggest of the reggae stars,
died of a brain tumor at the age of 36 in 1981.
   Tosh, who left the Wailers in 1973 and formed his own group,
Word, Sound and Power, was nominated for a Grammy for the LP
``Captured Live'' in 1985. He was gunned down and killed in his
Jamaican home on Sept. 11, 1987 at the age of 42.
   Marley and the Wailers did more to popularize and refine reggae
than any other artists. They had hits with ``Stir It Up,'' ``Get Up,
Stand Up,'' ``No Woman, No Cry'' and ``Could You Be Loved.''
   Bunny Wailer considers himself just as much a farmer as a
musician, and helped provide food for victims of Hurricane Gilbert
last fall.
   ``Sometimes people pay less attention to those things (food) but
they turn out to be the most important things. I am a farmer,'' said
Wailer, who was in the United States when the hurricane smashed into
the Caribbean island.
   Wailer chartered a jet, filled it with food and flew to Jamaica.
When Wailer returned to his farm on the border of Portland and St.
Thomas parishes, he found his home undamaged.
   ``Liberation,'' his fourth album on the Shanachi label, includes
messages on hunger, drug abuse, apartheid and freedom. The LP also
contains a copy of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
   ``Based on the history it projects, it's taken 400 years to
write,'' Wailer said in an interview. ``When I said I was going into
the studio, that only took four months. But to get all these things
together, it has taken my lifetime and so many other lifetimes
before.''
   Wailer was joined on portions of the ``Liberation'' tour by
Tosh's son, Andrew, and the Grammy-winning Ziggy Marley, Bob
Marley's son.

   Reggae has had its ups and downs over the past
decade, but Frederick ``Toots'' Hibbert just keeps playing.
   Hibbert, who has been making music since the early 1960s before
the word reggae ever hit American music stores, is back with his
first LP since 1981, ``Toots in Memphis,' a collection of soul
standards.
   His raspy voice, capable of sweetness and toughness, has been
likened to the late Otis Redding, one of soul's greatest singers.
The reggae star covers a pair of obscure Redding songs, ``I've Got
Dreams to Remember,'' and ``Hard to Handle.'' He also sings the
rhythm 'n' blues hit, ``Knock on Wood,'' and Al Green's ``Love and
Happiness.''
   ``I always listened to Al Green, Otis and Michael Jackson,
Stevie Wonder,'' Hibbert said. ``We are related somewhat.''
   Reggae's most famous rhythm section, Sly Dunbar and Robbie
Shakespeare, plays on the record. Also featured are guitarist
Teenie Hodges, who helped write ``Love and Happiness,'' and Andrew
Love of the Memphis Horns.
   Many of soul's greatest artists, including Redding, Wilson
Pickett and Aretha Franklin, recorded in Memphis. The idea for
making an album there often had been suggested to Hibbert, and the
singer finally contacted Island Records president Chris Blackwell
to express his interest.
   ``I'm not just a reggae singer,'' Hibbert explained. ``I can
sing anything, any song, rewrite the song and make it into my
style.''
   Thanks to young artists such as Ziggy Marley and Maxi Priest,
reggae has enjoyed a resurgence over the past year, inspiring those
who long for a return to the music's heyday of the early 1970s.
   Few of the stars who first made reggae internationally popular
are still around. Bob Marley, the music's most celebrated artist,
died of cancer in 1980. Peter Tosh, Marley's onetime bandmate and a
major performer in his own right, was murdered in 1987. Jimmy
Cliff, whose talents were featured in the popular reggae film,
``The Harder They Come,'' is no longer a commercial success.
   In the early '60s, Hibbert formed a ska trio, ``The Vikings,''
with Raleigh Gordon and Jerry Mathias. They quickly became one of
Jamaica's most popular acts, with Prince Buster producing and
Hibbert leading the way on a series of local hits, ``Pain in My
Belly,'' ``Little Flea'' and ``Dog War.''
   The group renamed itself the Maytals in 1966 and won that year's
Jamaican Festival Song competition with ``Bam, Bam.'' Hibbert
formed a permanent niche in reggae history by giving the music its
name in a 1968 song, ``Do the Reggay.''
   ``We were just playing around,'' Hibbert recalled. ``We used to
have slogans, jokes. Sometimes we'd say of a girl that's not
looking so great, `She's like a streggae.' That word was there and
one morning I said, `Let's do the `reggae.' I didn't think that the
name would last.''
   Under the production of Leslie Kong, the Maytals entered their
peak of popularity with a string of songs that became reggae
standards: ``Funky Kingston,'' ``54-46 That's My Number'' and
``Pressure Drop,'' a featured number in ``The Harder They Come.''
   But Hibbert was anxious to experiment with other forms of music,
covering the rock 'n' roll oldie ``Louie, Louie,'' and a
surprisingly danceable version of John Denver's ``Take Me Home,
Country Roads.'' Hibbert was surprised himself when he learned who
performed the original song.
   ``When I listened to it first I thought it was Ray Charles and I
always liked Ray Charles' sound,'' he said. ``I have a
country-and-western voice, very high pitched. I can find that voice
anytime.''
   Many reggae stars have been outspoken politically. Bob Marley's
active support for Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley led to an
assasination attempt in 1976.
   Priest and ``Burning Spear'' have each recorded tributes to the
late black nationalist leader, Marcus Garvey. Ziggy Marley's latest
album has several political songs.
   But Hibbert, who broke up with the Maytals in the early '80s,
prefers to concentrate on personal matters. ``I don't write about
politics,'' the singer noted. ``I write about naturality, about
real things that happen to real people.''
   One of Hibbert's most popular songs is ``Love Is Gonna to Let Me
Down,'' a heartfelt ballad.
   ``It's about a girl, and I'm giving encouragement,'' he said.
``It can mean anybody, male or female. `Everytime I see your face,
something moves in my heart.' I believe in love so even if love
lets you down, love also never dies.''
   He also differs from other reggae musicians by not being a
member of the Rastafarian religious sect. ``Reggae Got Soul'' is a
better way of expressing Hibbert's philosophy.
   ``I know it's got soul and if you got talent and soul, you can
sing it,'' he said. ``Everybody's got soul. Reggae music is the
music that carries love and good principles with it.''

REFRESHING REGGAE, PRAISE BE, FOLLOWS IRVINE SHOW'S TEACHING, PREACHING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Drum rolls and synthesized music of the spheres swirled with portent, then a 
figure robed in priestly vestments appeared, stretched out his arms and said, 
"Behold." 
</P>
<P>
A glitzy holiday extravaganza at the Crystal Cathedral? No, just a Sunday-night 
reggae show at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
The self-consciously beatific entrance was cause for fretting, even though the 
man in the holy Rastafarian trappings was Bunny Wailer, last living founder of 
the Wailers, a band that had few rivals in creating music with lasting 
spiritual and social impact. 
</P>
<P>
Wailer (given name: Neville Livingston) had come to teach and preach, and 
that's about all he did during the first half of a show that lasted more than 2 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Even a good sermon can become wearisome unless there is some climactic occasion 
to lend the words special weight or some special brilliance to the discourse 
that raises it from mere instruction to memorable storytelling. While any tour 
by the reclusive Wailer is a special occasion for reggae fans, the Jamaican 
singer's first hour on stage turned into sermonizing, not storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
There was no questioning the virtue or importance of Wailer's message, which 
proclaimed the need for justice, freedom and a sense of individual self-worth. 
Wailer also brought some special strengths to the delivery of songs with social 
themes and spiritual resonances: a gentleness that allowed him to be trenchant 
without sounding strident and a sense of proportion that enabled him to be 
urgent, yet not hysterical. 
</P>
<P>
Wailer's socio-spiritual rambles included some solid material -- first from his 
early days as a Wailer and as a solo artist, then from his new album, 
"Liberation." But the songs and lofty spoken interludes added up to something 
more didactic than enthralling. It didn't help that Wailer had to compete with 
a rumbling, overamplified bass. 
</P>
<P>
Just when one began to wonder whether he might be more interested in occupying 
a pulpit than a concert stage, Wailer changed everything. Reggae, he declared, 
is intended to refresh the body and soul as well as stir the mind and spirit. 
Off came the robes embroidered with Rasta iconography; out came Wailer in 
dancing trim, and away went the whole 20-member ensemble -- including two 
wonderfully limber and athletic male dancers -- for an excursion that was 
refreshment with a capital R. 
</P>
<P>
The songs, including a sharp Wailers medley in honor of the group's other 
co-founders, Bob Marley and Peter Tosh, were catchy, lively reggae dance music 
that seemed a special treat after the heavy early going. The Bunny Wailer who 
had seemed so imposingly patriarchal showed that he can also be a strutting, 
whirling party hound of the first order. 
</P>
<P>
The second half's easy fun made the first half's lofty seriousness seem more 
palatable in retrospect. But Wailer's final number pointed to how the best rock 
songs can unite fun with seriousness. The song was "Keep On Moving," a 
deceptively catchy Wailers gem that, if you concentrate on the words, is about 
an innocent poor man hounded by false criminal accusations. For the most part, 
Wailer's musical sermons early in the show could only tell about injustice. 
"Keep On Moving," besides its uncommon melodic strengths, conjured up a story 
that showed injustice happening. "Show, don't tell" is one homily that 
songwriters can take as gospel. 
</P>
<P>
Wailer's set capped a 6-hour evening steeped in reggae tradition. Second-billed 
Judy Mowatt, a longtime member of Marley's I-Threes backup vocal group, 
displayed a superb, flexible voice that can handle rootsy reggae as well as 
pop-soul stylings. There was a substantial gap, however, between Mowatt's own 
material and the Wailers songs -- especially a moving "No Woman No Cry" -- that 
highlighted her hourlong set. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Tosh, Peter's son, also had his best moment with a playful rendition of 
a Wailers song, "I'm the Toughest." Tosh also sang a plaintive yet strangely 
impersonal song addressed to his father's murderers. 
</P>
<P>
The Skatalites, a horn-driven band that was crucial to reggae's birth in the 
early 1960s, got the audience hopping gleefully as it offered quick-stepping 
ska rhythms and sax and trumpet solos in a jazzy, lightly tootling style. But 
the 10-man band, which included seven original members, performed with too much 
reserve for its lighthearted style of music, and an upright bass boomed 
annoyingly out of control. 
</P>
<P>
Ras Michael began the day with a spare, percussive set built around prayerful 
traditional reggae songs in what amounted to an opening benediction.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: POP MUSIC / THOMAS K. ARNOLD: REGGAE'S HEAVYWEIGHTS DON'T

Two of Jamaica's most acclaimed musical exports, Burning Spear and Pato Banton, 
will headline this year's Bob Marley Birthday Celebration. The ninth annual 
tribute to the late, great reggae pioneer will be held Saturday night at the 
California Theatre in downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Burning Spear, whose real name is Winston Rodney, is the heir apparent to 
Marley as the social conscience of reggae music. Unlike most contemporary 
reggae artists, who prefer to sing about love, sex and ganja (marijuana), the 
41-year-old Rodney concerns himself primarily with weightier topics. 
</P>
<P>
In most of his songs, he either rails against the evils of oppression -- black 
Jamaica's history of slavery -- or hails the virtues of achieving mystical 
transcendence through the Rastafarian religion. Rodney will appear with the

Pato Banton is no lightweight, either. Although the Birmingham, England, native 
first found success on the British charts a few years ago with such infectious 
dance tunes as "Allo Tosh" and "Mash Up the Telly," his music has since become 
increasingly topical. 
</P>
<P>
On "Never Give In," his 1988 U. S. debut, Banton sings about everything from 
apartheid in South Africa ("Sometimes I cry for my people in South 
Africa/Brutalized and persecuted by apartheid law/Living under the rule of a 
mass murderer/Who goes by the name of Mr. Botha") to poverty in Jamaica 
("Because of the government joke system/A lot of families find it hard to make 
a livin'/To be young and unemployed is an everyday thin'/That's why so many 
youths gone ragamuffin'. ") 
</P>
<P>
Also on the bill is Don Carlos, a founding member of Black Uhuru. Since going 
solo a few years ago, Carlos has released nearly a dozen albums in Jamaica, 
Africa and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Bob Marley Birthday Celebration will also feature an exhibition of Jamaican 
handicrafts and jewelry and a slide show chronicling Marley's career.

The biggest dance craze of the 1960s began in the eighth month of that decade. 
In August, 1960, a young black man from Philadelphia named Ernest Evans -- who 
a year before had quit his job as a chicken plucker in a local poultry shop, 
rechristened himself Chubby Checker (in emulation of the similarly built Fats 
Domino), and signed with Philly's Cameo-Parkway Records, under whose label he 
topped the charts with his version of "The Twist." 
</P>
<P>
The song was written, and originally recorded as a B side, by rhythm and blues 
singer Hank Ballard in 1958. But it was Checker's interpretation that became a 
hit -- one that soon had teen-agers all over the world dancing to "The Twist" 
and countless other rock acts jumping on the bandwagon with their own 
variations of the tune. 
</P>
<P>
There was Danny and the Juniors' "Twistin' U. S. A.," Jimmy Soul's "Twistin' 
Matilda," the Marvelettes' "Twistin' Postman" and Sam Cooke's "Twistin' the 
Night Away." There was the Beatles' "Twist and Shout" and Gary U. S. Bonds' 
"Twist, Twist Senora." There were even three follow-ups by Checker himself: 
"Let's Twist Again" in 1961, "Slow Twistin' " a year later and 1963's "Twist It 
Up." 
</P>
<P>
Checker, who will appear Thursday night at the Bacchanal nightclub in Kearny 
Mesa, subsequently promoted several other, less successful dance crazes in 
songs like "The Hucklebuck" (which went to No. 14 in October, 1960), "Pony 
Time" (No. 3, January, 1961), "Limbo Rock" (No. 2, September, 1962) and "Let's 
Do the Freddie" (No. 40, May, 1965). 
</P>
<P>
But, by the late 1960s, the hits had stopped coming, the toes had stopped 
tapping and Checker found himself relegated to has-been status. For the next 
two decades, he was a mainstay on the oldies circuit, regularly touring the 
country with rock revival shows. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, however, Checker's remake of "The Twist," with rap group the Fat 
Boys, put him back on the charts for the first time in more than 20 years. Ever 
since, he's once again been a top concert draw, this time attracting a whole 
new generation of fans. 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: Veteran singing duo the Righteous Brothers, whose mid-1960s hits 
include "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin' " and "(You're My) Soul and 
Inspiration," have picked San Diego as the site for their second retro-rock 
diner. Bill Medley and Bobby Hatfield have yet to settle on a name, but they've 
already settled on a location: next to the abandoned Loma Theater on Rosecrans 
Street in Point Loma. The combination restaurant-nightclub, modeled after the 
one the pair built a few years back in Orange County, is scheduled to open in 
November. There will be live music five nights a week, including regular 
performances by the Righteous Brothers and other oldies acts. 
</P>
<P>
The Pandoras will appear Saturday night at the Spirit nightclub in Bay Park. 
The all-girl rock group's new album, "Rock Hard," was produced by San Diego 
guitarist Stevie Salas, who spent much of last year on the road with Rod 
Stewart. . . . Local roots-rockers the Beat Farmers have finished recording 
their fourth album, "Poor and Famous," up at Indigo Ranch studios in Malibu and 
are back in town for a brief respite before they head out on tour in late 
March. The LP is due out around the same time on the MCA/Curb Records label.

<LEADPARA>  The Jamaican Supreme Court last week ended a bitter 10-year-old struggle over
reggae superstar Bob Marley's estate by approving a deal granting rights to
Island Records founder Chris Blackwell and Rita Marley, the singer's widow.
The Blackwell-Marley bid of $11.5 million prevailed over MCA-Matsushita's
higher offer of $15.2 million.;   The winning bid, placed by Rita Marley and
her four children, backed by Blackwell and his Island Logic company, ends a
decade of often emotional and bitter struggle over Marley's estate, which
includes his publishing copyrights, recording royalties, a recording studio
and some real estate. The singer died intestate.  </LEADPARA>

<HEAD>Reggae Roots Push Maxi Priest Up the Charts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A reggae version of Cat Stevens' ``Wild World''?
It wasn't Maxi Priest's idea.
   ``I never wanted to do it. It was the choice of the record
company,'' admitted Priest, who nonetheless went No. 1 for four
weeks with the song on the British singles chart.
   ``All the way from London to Jamaica I was saying, `I don't want
to do this. I don't like this record,''' he said, adding, ``I enjoy
the song now.''
   Though only 25, Priest is already a veteran in the music
business. ``Wild World'' is included on ``Maxi,'' his third album
and the first to be released in the United States.
   He grew up in southeast London, the son of a factory worker, and
described his upbringing as ``a bit too strict.'' Priest did,
however, have a diverse musical background.
   ``Coming from the Pentacostal church, I liked a lot of religious
songs. Having a Jamaican West Indian background, I was into reggae.''
   His influences were broad, ranging from the sounds of Studio One
in Jamaica to the Beatles. Although not a born musician _ he does
not play an instrument _ Priest was singing ``roughly from the time
the doctor slapped my bum when I came out.'' He created his own
studio at the age of 14.
   He was still a teen-ager when he joined Saxon International as a
deejay for ``Sound System'' and worked with noted English reggae
stars such as Smiley Culture and Tippa Irie.
   ``I found myself getting a lot of ideas very quickly. A lot of my
vibes came from Sound System. You just start singing and things come
out. I found myself getting good melodies and good lyrics at the
same time,'' he said.
   In 1984, Priest's debut single, ``Hey Little Girl,'' became the
first British reggae record to reach No. 1 in Jamaica. The following
year, he released his first album, ``You're Safe,'' and after
extensive touring, was named best male vocalist in the 1986 UK
Reggae Awards.
   His second album, ``Intentions,'' came out in late 1986 and
contained a cover version of Van Morrison's ``Crazy Love.''
   ``It was given to me by my manager. I like Van Morrison's stuff.
I think he's a very good writer.''
   On ``Maxi,'' Priest covers ``Some Guys Have All the Luck,'' a hit
for Rod Stewart.
   ``It was a song that I always wanted to do. It always used to
work with me on stage. Once I was doing this TV program. There was a
commercial break and I started to sing the song and the crowd went
`Yeah.'''
   But Priest writes most of his own material.
   ``I don't want to be cut out as a cover artist. I'm not putting
it down, it was a good idea and it worked. But I do not want to be
known as a cover artist.
   ``I think most of my music comes from the early Studio One where
you had to have a good song, a good melody.''
   Priest is especially proud of ``How Can We Ease the Pain,'' an
original song on ``Maxi.''
   ``It means a lot to me. It's not being too political but it's
stating something the whole world need to understand. That we could
live a lot better than we're living. I don't like to get into any
heavy politics but it's just a nice way to say something.''
   He does deal more directly with politics on ``Marcus,'' a tribute
to the late black nationalist leader, Marcus Garvey.
   ``It's giving thanks to somebody that thought of the apartheid
movement many years ago.''
   Reggae's most famous rhythm section, drummer Sly Dunbar and
bassist Robbie Shakespeare, played on ``Maxi.''
   ``They heard a lot about me in England and I always heard about
them. It was inevitable somehwhere along the line,'' Priest said.
``It was fun. Like sitting back and saying, `Hey, this is Sly and
Robbie.'''
   Priest will begin a tour of the United States this fall. He feels
at ease performing live, crediting his confidence to the time spent
at Saxon International.
   ``You have to sing with people right into your face. So I had a
bit of experience dealing with people directly. It was easier on
stage.''
   Despite his following in England, Priest is well aware of the
difficulty that reggae artists have selling records in the United
States. Even Bob Marley had problems. His only song to make the Top
10 was ``I Shot the Sheriff,'' and that was a cover version by Eric
Clapton.
   ``I'm realizing that now,'' Priest said, ``but this is a new
generation. The music is looking much, much better. Bob opened the
doors. There's Steel Pulse, Aswad, Ziggy Marley.''
   But don't go looking for any ``Maxi Priest Sings Cat Stevens''
compilations. ``I'm not a fan of Cat Stevens,'' he said.

Between the death of Bob Marley, the murder of drummer Carlton Barrett and 
legal entanglements restricting the group's activities for years, the Wailers 
Band has faced plenty of trials by fire. But there's little evidence of the 
reggae sextet's indomitable spirit on this undistinguished comeback album. The 
songs (all written or co-written by singer-guitarist Junior Marvin) steer a 
nondescript commercial course that echoes Steel Pulse and UB40. Only "Reggae 
Love" and "Irie" pack any kind of groove punch, while the lyrics are nebulous 
social protests or generic tributes to reggae music. No one should begrudge the 
Wailers an identity as something more than the official Bob Marley jukebox, but 
the anonymity of the material on "I.D." is pretty shocking -- as is the 
realization that the Wailers, who once defined the direction of reggae, are now 
followers rather than leaders. DON SNOWDEN

<HEAD>Music Makers: More Talking Heads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David Byrne was in a hotel bathtub in
Minneapolis when he wrote lyrics for ``No More Flowers'' for the
Talking Heads.
   This is just one bare fact the group revealed when talking about
themselves in an interview to promote their latest LP, ``Naked.''
   Byrne, the group's lead singer and lyricist, was in Minneapolis
to visit his wife, costume designer Adele Lutz, who was doing a
play there.
   ``I would work with this microcassette recorder,'' he said. ``I
would have it sitting just outside the tub. I would reach out and
speak into it. I'd be singing in the tub. I'd catch a phrase that I
thought was apropos; I'd put it on the little recorder.''
   The album is on their new label, Fly Records. It jumped onto
Cashbox magazine's best-selling album chart at No. 20 on April 2.
   ``This record actually goes back to our earliest songs and
albums `Remain in Light' (1980) and `Speaking in Tongues' (1983),
where we would each contribute ideas,'' said drummer Chris Frantz.
   ``We rented a rehearsal studio in New York and each threw out
ideas. We had a little cassette recorder and had all our
instruments there. We'd take an idea, play it and play it, trading
instruments, until it fell apart. Then we'd strike up a new idea.
We ended up after 10 days with many snippets of songs.
   ``We went to Paris into a recording studio and commenced to put
them all together into song form.''
   They went to Paris for several reasons. They laid down tracks
with Paris-based Third-World musicians who play Caribbean Zuok and
Algerian-Moroccan rai. Frantz said they also wanted to hang out
together, which they're more apt to do in Paris than in New York
where they have different sets of friends.
   ``My feeling is that lately there has been less openness here,''
said Byrne, the group's lead singer and lyricist. ``I wanted to get
away from that feeling. There is that kind of vibe here that
whatever is Top 10 in the United States is all there is. There is a
lot going on in other places.''
   Byrne, Frantz and Tina Weymouth met at the Rhode Island School
of Design, and still design their striking album packages. They
added Jerry Harrison to the trio and put out their first album in
1977.
   Wally Badarou, who played keyboards on ``Speaking in Tongues,''
found the Paris studio and brought in other musicians.
   ``One guitarist had a big smile the entire time he was playing
with us,'' Weymouth said. ``When you're putting down music with
that kind of heartfelt feeling, you know it's coming across in the
record.''
   Harrison said the album has two moods. ``This organic, larger
band is primarily on the first side of the album,'' he said. What
Weymouth terms ``the more experimental or ominous'' songs are on
Side 2.
   After 15 basic tracks were recorded, Byrne improvised melodies
and then wrote the words.
   ``I heard a story about a French screenwriter who, when it was
time to write a script, would rent a hotel room at the Rafael and
lock himself in the bathroom,'' Byrne said. ``His secretary would
deliver food. He didn't allow himself to go out of there until it
was all done. He could barely afford to stay there. He had to work
every day.
   ``I tried lyrics for all 15. On some the words and melodies
weren't quite right. It was nice that we had enough. There was one
about marijuana _ it's a great song. Too bad. It was lagging behind
in the race for the record so it didn't make it.''
   Byrne, who is British, married the American Lutz last July in
Paris. Harrison has a son who is 1 years old, and Weymouth and
Frantz, who are married, have two sons, who are 5 and 2.
   Since they all have individual commitments to pursue the next
Talking Heads project probably will be another album instead of a
tour.
   ``I put together `Storytelling Giant,' a compilation of all the
band videos, and shot some extra material to go between them, to
kind of link them.
   ``I hope to direct another movie, with Robert Wilson, in the
summer in Europe. That's still in the planning stage. We did
something a couple of years ago, `The Knee Plays.' I think that's
going into a theater in Chicago.''
   Byrne's last film was ``True Stories,'' a musical romp about an
``average'' Texas town.
   Byrne also composed music for some scenes in Bernardo
Bertolucci's ``The Last Emperor,'' which won nine Acaemy Awards.
   Harrison, who produced the BoDeans' ``Inside Looking Out,'' is
putting together a band to tour behind the album he just released
on Sire Records, `Casual Gods.'
   ``I did `Casual Gods' in Wisconsin in a basement studio,'' he
said. ``My mother was ill and my father had passed away. I went
back to Milwaukee to take care of her whenever I could be there. I
found a basement studio I could rent by the week rather than by the
hour, owned by the younger brother of someone I had grown up with.
   ``Musicians would pass through town or I used local musicians. I
was paying for it myself. When I was offered a production job I
would always do it. That caused my record to extend over the years.
I think it made it much better. The songs are more diverse and I
think my singing got better.''
   Weymouth said she and Frantz just finished ``Conscious Party''
by Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers. It is their only production
outside of the Tom Tom Club.
   ``We are going into the studio to finish up our third Tom Tom
Club record,'' Frantz said. ``After it's released in June, I think
we'll tour in Europe. We're in demand in Europe.
   ``Ziggy Marley, who's 19, writes all the material. His brother
Steve, 15, sings one song. Cedella is 20. Rita and Sharon, who's a
mother of two, sing backgrounds.'' The Melody Makers, formed by the
late reggae king Bob Marley, have been around since Ziggy was 8.
   ``It's hard for me to imagine doing all this when I was 19,''
remarked Byrne.

   Berke Breathed, whose pen illustrated the comic
strip ``Bloom County,'' plans to go a little overboard as a
contributing editor at Boating magazine.
   John Owens, editor in chief of Boating, said Tuesday that
Breathed, an avid boater who has homes in Evergreen and Florida,
will write a monthly humor column.
   Breathed, who owns four boats, said his column, titled
``Overboard,'' will reflect his consuming interest in the sport.
   ``Boating looks at equipment in the way I want to look at
equipment _ what's coming out, and why we silly boaters think that
a new-style helm station is exciting,'' Breathed said.
   The last ``Bloom County'' comic strip appeared in papers last
weekend. Breathed, who won a Pulitzer Prize for cartooning in 1987,
plans to begin work on a new strip called ``Outland'' that will
begin Sept. 3. ``Outland'' features a black ghetto child who was a
``Bloom County'' regular.

   CBS is firmly behind the ``The Pat Sajak
Show'' as the late-night talkfest struggles against reigning king
Johnny Carson and his ``Tonight Show,'' the show's producer said.
   ``CBS has just told me, `Do what it takes to make it work, and
we'll stick by you,''' Paul Gilbert said in a recent interview.
   The show, featuring Sajak of ``Wheel of Fortune'' fame, debuted
with good ratings seven months ago but has since dropped to third
place.
   Gilbert said the show has been revamped. The blue couch is gone,
replaced by a beige one. Only four guests will now appear nightly,
instead of five, a change Gilbert said was made ``to allow Pat time
to sink his teeth into an interview.''
   Most significantly, Sajak's monologue will run in the middle of
the show or not at all. ``We figure it doesn't make sense to
compete against Carson with his act,'' Gilbert said.

   Reggae singer Ziggy Marley says if
his audiences notice he's smiling a great deal, it's because he
loves the music he makes.
   ``I feel good. I feel like everything is goin' alright and I
love our music,'' said Marley, 20, at a news conference Tuesday.
   Marley and his band, The Melodymakers, began a world tour and
showed reporters their new video for the single ``Look Who's
Dancing,'' from the album ``One Bright Day''
   Brother Stephen Marley and sisters Sharon Marley Prendergast and
Cedella Marley also perform in The Melodymakers. The four are the
children of the late reggae great, Bob Marley.
   Ziggy Marley said his father once told him: ``On your way up
please take me up. On your way down don't let me down.''
   Reggae music is based on themes of peace and unity, Marley said.
   Marley and The Melodymakers will tour the United States, then
Europe, Africa and Japan. Marley and the band won a Grammy for best
reggae recording last year and an NAACP Image award.

   Running New York City isn't child's play, but

   Koch, better known for his brash, outspoken style, revealed a
yearning for the simpler life of a child Tuesday during a tour of a
new day-care center at police headquarters in lower Manhattan.
   ``It's marvelous,'' the mayor said as he was shown the playroom
and a second room where the 35 children in the program take a nap
after lunch.
   ``Sometime about 3 o'clock in the afternoon I feel like I want
to come over and be loved,'' Koch told Police Commissioner Benjamin
Ward, who led the tour.
   ``Come over between one and two o'clock,'' Ward replied.

said university officials.
   ``Working toward success in a rock 'n' roll band is really no
different than working toward success in any other endeavor,''
Weinberg said. ``You have to be disciplined, professional and, most
importantly, you have to believe in yourself and your goals.''
   Weinberg's address also will include film footage of his 14

   African rock stars, French singers and American rap

Friday.
   Harlem Desir, head of the group SOS-Racism, said the concert
involving 40 bands was ``the Band Aid of racism,'' a reference to
the worldwide concerts sponsored by British musician Bob Geldof to
benefit the victims of famine in Africa.
   African rock star Mory Kante, French singer Jacques Higelin and
Ziggy Marley, son of reggae legend Bob Marley, will perform in
Paris.
   At Demba Diop stadium in Dakar, Senegal, singer Youssou N'Dour
and Marley's former group, The Wailers, will head the bill.
   At New York's Apollo Theatre in Harlem, the rap group Living
Color will headline the show.

<LEADPARA>  Ten years after Bob Marley's death, reggae is still here. And in some ways,
it's thriving. UB40's "Here I Am Come And Take Me" is a top single. Ziggy
Marley's album "Jahmekya" is everywhere. And Maxi Priest, Steel Pulse,
Shinehead, Burning Spear and other top reggae groups are all on tour.;    The
beat goes on. But what about the politics?  </LEADPARA>

<HEAD>The Best and Worst in Film, Music and Theater</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   It was the year of a colossal flop and a colossal triumph on
Broadway, of strikes and turmoil in Hollywood, of a pop-music
bullseye in Dublin.
   Here are the best and worst in film, theater and pop music in
1988, as compiled by Bob Thomas, film critic and Hollywood reporter
for The Associated Press; Michael Kuchwara, AP drama writer, and the
AP's music critics:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MOVIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Best:
   _ `'' Drunks aren't funny anymore.
   _ ``Full Moon in Blue Water.'' A regional-theater
play-in-progress.
   _ ``The Lair of the White Worm.'' The pits from Ken Russell.
   _ ``The Seventh Sign.'' ``The Exorcist'' without brains.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THEATER</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Best:
   _ ``The Phantom of the Opera.'' The year's biggest hit and its
best musical. Andrew Lloyd Webber produced his most accomplished
score to date _ lush, romantic and sweeping music that perfectly
captured Gaston Leroux's passionate tale of love denied.
   _ ``M. Butterfly.'' David Henry Hwang's brilliant recreation of a
spy scandal and love affair involving a French diplomat and a
Chinese opera singer who turns out to be a man.
   _ ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone.'' August Wilson's story of the
search for identity among the children of slaves.
   _ ``The Road to Mecca.'' Athol Fugard's tale of one woman's
determination to remain independent.
   _ ``Speed-the-Plow.'' David Mamet's scathing look at Hollywood
greed and glory.
   _ ``The Cocktail Hour.'' A.R. Gurney's comic examination of
upper-class generational conflict.
   
   Worst:
   _ ``Carrie.'' An $8 million disaster, Broadway's most expensive
flop. It was based on the Stephen King horror novel about a dumpy,
awkward teen-age girl with telekinetic powers. Betty Buckley and
16-year-old Linzi Hateley, in the title role, sang their hearts out,
but nothing could save this dud.
   _ ``Chess.'' Another turkey that signaled that the British
musical domination of Broadway was over. Despite its good score by
Tim Rice and members of ABBA, it died because of a deadly book by
Richard Nelson and turgid direction by Trevor Nunn.
   _ ``Julius Caesar.'' Al Pacino and Martin Sheen brought Hollywood
glitz but nothing else to ``Julius Caesar.'' The two stars, along
with Edward Herrmann, massacred Shakespeare.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>POP MUSIC</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Best:
   _ ``Rattle and Hum,'' U2. An ambitious, important and satisfying
record. The Irish superstars swing wildly at numerous musical
styles, and more often than not hit the mark in their part-live,
part-studio double album.
   _ ``Tracy Chapman,'' Tracy Chapman. Stirring songs of love and
social conscience from the year's most distinctive new voice. Sets
one to wondering if Chapman is An Important Artist For The 1990s or
a folkie with a few great songs who just got a break. Her big tour
didn't answer the question; her next album will.
   _ ``The Mona Lisa's Sister,'' Graham Parker. A fine comeback by a
brilliant artist all but given up for dead. Parker, one of the '70s
finest songwriters, is caustic, as ever, but this literate and
listenable record shows more facets of the man than anything he's
done in years.
   _ ``Talk Is Cheap,'' Keith Richards. No, Keith Richards can't
sing. But this is rousing, rocking, flat-out fun _ a raunchy,
whiskey-soaked collection of songs with not a single frill attached.
The only problem with ``Talk Is Cheap'' is that its release has
revived childish arguments over who's the coolest, Mick or Keith.
Well, we've always known it's Keith, haven't we?
   _ ``Conscious Party,'' Ziggy Marley. The son of reggae legend Bob
Marley delivers a sparkling debut. Ziggy appears to have his late
father's knack for sharp, topical songs that also are danceable.
   
   Worst:
   _ ``Baby I Love Your Way-Free Bird Medley,'' Will To Power. All
the worst memories of the '70s come rushing back, sort of like a bad
meal.
   _ ``Don't You Know What the Night Can Do,'' Steve Winwood. Is it
a song? Is it a commercial? Only his accountant knows for sure.
   _ ``Heavy Nova,'' Robert Palmer. He sold his soul for a hit, and
this is our payback.
   _ ``Brian Wilson.'' Far from the triumphant comeback some
proclaimed. Wishing doesn't make it so.
   _ ``Hysteria,'' Def Leppard. Nothing could be worse.

POP EYE: A BANNER YEAR FOR GREED, FOOLISHNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when you thought rock 'n roll couldn't possibly get any sillier, along 
came . . . Milli Vanilli. 
</P>
<P>
But the disgraced pop hunks who were stripped of their Grammy after admitting 
they didn't actually sing on their multiplatinum album, weren't the only rock 
icons whose music turned out to be far less important than their marketing 
image. In fact, you could call 1990 the year of the Big Sell -- or the Big Sell 
Out -- as pop stars hyped themselves with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
The tackiest pitchman of all: M. C. Hammer. When rap's reigning kingpin 
accepted his Best Rap Song trophy at the MTV Awards broadcast, he made sure 
everyone knew he'd signed a lucrative deal to hype soft drinks by plugging his 
new sponsor and waving a Pepsi can at the podium. 
</P>
<P>
The most earnest pitchmen: New Kids on the Block. The teen idols had a string 
of hits this year (they have four albums in the Top 100 right now). But they 
made even more money with an incredible series of merchandising deals valued at 
upwards of $400 million (in other words, more than what Jose Canseco, Madonna 
and Jack Nicholson make in a year combined). 
</P>
<P>
And the Hamlet of pitchmen had to be George Michael. In interviews to hype his 
new album, the Three-Day Bearded One complained so much about how stardom had 
made him miserable that he received a stinging rebuke from no less an authority 
than Frank Sinatra, who advised: "Come on, George. Loosen up. Swing, man. . . . 
You're top dog on the top rung of a tall ladder called Stardom, which in Latin 
means thanks-to-the-fans who were there when it was lonely." 
</P>
<P>
And 1990 offered plenty of spills and thrills as well, whether it was Axl Rose 
being arrested on charges that he hit his neighbor with a wine bottle (the 
charges were later dropped) or Faith No More singer Mike Patton, who was 
questioned by Australian customs officials for smuggling a pair of fake breasts 
into the country (the eagle-eyed customs crew confiscated the falsies, which 
Patton planned to use in the band's stage show). Any way you view it, it was a 
banner year for pop follies. To celebrate the music world's clown princes, Pop 
Eye presents its yearly round-up of dubious achievements, inglorious moments 
and showbiz misadventures: 
</P>
<P>
HIP-HOP FAN OF THE YEAR: Former president Richard Nixon, who says in a taped 
memoir at his new Richard Nixon Museum: "When I was seven, I started taking 
music lessons . . . and learned to play the violin, the clarinet, the saxophone 
and recorder. I've often thought that if there had been a good rap group around 
in those days, I might have chosen a career in music instead of politics." 
</P>
<P>
ELVIS QUOTE OF THE YEAR: When ABC-TV canceled its "Elvis" series this spring, 
citing poor ratings, "Elvis" producer Alan Spenser observed: "Isn't it 
interesting that people see Elvis in 7-11s, Laundromats and Burger King, but no 
one watches him Sunday night at 8:30 on ABC." 
</P>
<P>
CHEF OF THE YEAR: Gourmet chef Carmen Bonnilla quit after only a month as 
Prince's personal cook, complaining that the pop star, while professing to be a 
vegetarian, wouldn't eat any salads or vegetables. "He eats a lot of junk 
food," Bonnilla said. "I have the feeling it's going to catch up with him." 
</P>
<P>
GENTLEMEN OF THE YEAR: After hearing that Deniece Wells had been arrested for 
using the men's room at a George Strait concert this fall, the members of Ratt 
sent the Houston woman free tickets to their show -- and an all-access 
laminated backstage pass saying she could use the group's men's room anytime. 
</P>
<P>
PROMO MAN OF THE YEAR: MCA Records promo exec Billy Brill, asked why he got 
into the record business, explained: "Since I was Jewish, I couldn't be a gym 
teacher -- I didn't look good in short pants and a whistle." 
</P>
<P>
CONTRACT CLAUSE OF THE YEAR: When Harper &amp; Row signed the Grateful Dead's 
Mickey Hart to write a new opus called "Drumming on the Edge of Magic," the 
publishing house had to agree to a "tree clause" in Hart's book contract 
stipulating that Harper &amp; Row plant a pair of saplings in a needy rain 
forest for every tree used to provide paper for the book. 
</P>
<P>
GRAMMY BEST NEW ARTIST OF THE YEAR: To Mrs. Gooch's meat counter store clerk 
Mick Rechtien, who crooned the National Anthem to pop diva Sinead O'Connor 
(after she'd refused to allow "The Star-Spangled Banner" to be performed before 
a concert in New Jersey). Rechtien was subsequently fired for harassing her. 
</P>
<P>
WACKO OF THE YEAR: As always, to Michael Jackson, who was one of many showbiz 
luminaries to appear in the documentary, "Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy 
Jones," but the only one to insist that his interview be filmed completely in 
the dark. (His interviewer is shown holding a flashlight on her list of 
questions.) 
</P>
<P>
QUOTE OF THE YEAR: John Connors, a Chicago-based vocalist who makes a living 
doing Frank Sinatra vocal impressions, admitted: "I've always thought that I 
sounded much more like Frank Sinatra Jr. than I do his father. But is there a 
market for a Frank Sinatra Jr. impersonator? I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
SEPARATED AT BIRTH, PART ONE: Perhaps because they both wear dreadlock-style 
hairdos, Lenny Kravitz is sometimes mistaken for Ziggy Marley, son of the late 
reggae legend Bob Marley. (Lenny's father is a TV producer named Sy Kravitz.) 
Sure enough, when Lenny was walking the beach in the Bahamas this year, he was 
approached by an excited fan, who told him: "You know, your father was such an 
inspiration. He meant so much to me -- he was the greatest!" Lenny eyed the fan 
and said, "Sy?" 
</P>
<P>
SEPARATED AT BIRTH, PART TWO: In a pop round-up piece, GQ Magazine ran a 
picture of Bob Mould but identified the thrash-rocker in the caption as being 
country songstress k.d. lang. 
</P>
<P>
POP EVANGELIST OF THE YEAR: MCA Records president Richard Palmese, asked why he 
gave up studying for the priesthood to join the record industry, explained: "I 
found it was easier to convince people a song was a hit . . . than convince 
them that there was a God." 
</P>
<P>
BEACH BOYS FAN OF THE YEAR: Just before he died earlier this year, Andy, 
"Doonesbury's" wisecracking AIDS patient, scrawled these words on a scrap of 
paper: "Brian Wilson is God!" To which his doctor responded: "Oh, he must have 
heard the 'Pet Sounds' CD." 
</P>
<P>
OVER-ENTHUSIASTIC CENSOR OF THE YEAR: The Pacific Northwest-based record store 
chain, Meyer Music Markets, slapped an objectionable lyrics warning sticker on 
Frank Zappa's "Jazz From Hell" album, despite the fact that it was an 
all-instrumental disc. 
</P>
<P>
MATHEMATICIANS OF THE YEAR: Motown Records staged its "Motown 30" birthday 
celebration this fall, even though the record label's lavish 25th anniversary 
special took place in . . . 1983. 
</P>
<P>
IMPOSTERS OF THE YEAR: Milli Vanilli. Need we say more? 
</P>
<P>
LISTENING PARTY OF THE YEAR: Arista chief Clive Davis' lavish October bash in 
the Grand Ballroom at New York's Regency Hotel, where 200 guests were forced to 
sit in folding chairs and listen to every track of the new Whitney Houston 
album, complete with gushing introductions for each song from Davis himself. 
</P>
<P>
I.Q. OF THE YEAR: Accused of hiding subliminal messages in his songs that drove 
two youths to suicide, Judas Priest guitarist K. K. Downing told the press 
after leaving the courtroom one day: "I didn't know what a subliminal message 
was until this case came up. It'll be another 10 years before I can even spell 
subliminal."

WHO'S NEXT WHEN ROCK 'N' ROLL VOTES TO INDUCT NEW ARTISTS TO ITS HALL OF FAME? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Who's three Southern California concerts this week are part of a 25th 
anniversary celebration for the landmark British band that is virtually certain 
to culminate with the group's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 
next January in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The question facing the 300 record industry leaders who have been asked to vote 
in this year's selection process: What other rock artists also deserve to join 
the fifth annual Hall of Fame class? 
</P>
<P>
The selection panel -- mostly record company executives, musicians and critics 
-- was given a list of 30 nominees and asked to vote for up to 10 artists. 
Results will be announced in October. 
</P>
<P>
Under Hall of Fame rules, performers become eligible for induction 25 years 
after the release of their first record -- in this case, 1964. 
</P>
<P>
The Who is one of five acts on the 1989 ballot that became eligible this year. 
The others: the Animals, the Kinks, Simon &amp; Garfunkel and the Yardbirds. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Marley also appears on the ballot for the first time, but he was eligible 
in 1986 because the reggae champion began his recording carer in Jamaica in 
1961. He didn't appear on earlier ballots because the early records weren't 
brought to the attention of the nominating committee members. Most members had 
assumed his career began with his mid-'60s recordings with the Wailers. 
</P>
<P>
Three other names appearing on this year's ballot for the first time were also 
eligible previously, but didn't receive enough votes in preliminary screening 
sessions to qualify. They are Johnny Cash, Brenda Lee and the Shirelles. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven artists have been on the ballot ever since the Hall of Fame voting was 
begun in 1985, but haven't received enough support to be inducted. They are 
LaVern Baker, Hank Ballard, Ruth Brown, King Curtis, Bobby Darin, Duane Eddy, 
Little Willie John, Frankie Lymon, Jimmy Reed, Gene Vincent and Chuck Willis. 
</P>
<P>
Del Shannon was nominated this year for the fourth time, while Solomon Burke, 
the Four Seasons, Gladys Knight and the Platters are on the ballot for the 
third time. 
</P>
<P>
Suzan Evans, executive director of the Hall of Fame Foundation in New York, 
said the decision on how many artists will be inducted in January will be made 
after looking at the final vote to see if there is a natural dividing point. 
Last year, five record makers were honored: Dion DiMucci, Otis Redding, the 
Rolling Stones, the Temptations and Stevie Wonder. 
</P>
<P>
While the foundation gives the 300 voters no guidelines for judging Hall of 
Fame qualifications, the balloting so far has shown that the voters lean much 
more heavily toward artists with a strong sense of artistic vision than artists 
who simply registered a lot of hits. 
</P>
<P>
Here's my rating of the 1989 nominees -- with artists listed alphabetically 
within categories. Commentary is provided on artists in the top two categories 
and on artists in other categories who are on the ballot for the first time. 
The others were discussed in previous Hall of Fame handicaps. 
</P>
<P>
The Musts 
</P>
<P>
The Kinks 
</P>
<P>
Stats: 12 Top 40 singles in the United States -- notably "You Really Got Me" 
(1964), "All Day and All of the Night" (1965), "Lola" (1970) and "Come Dancing" 
(1983). 
</P>
<P>
Despite the early hits, the Kinks didn't make as big a splash with the 
mainstream pop-rock audience in the mid-'60s as such rival British Invasion 
outfits as Herman's Hermits and the Dave Clark Five. But thanks to Ray Davies' 
songs, the Kinks went on to establish a body of work that far outdistances 
virtually every band from the period save the Beatles, Stones and Who. Davies 
wrote with imagination, passion and wit about social attitudes in England and 
his own frustrations and doubts in rock 'n' roll. Along with Dylan and the 
Beatles/Stones/Who, the Kinks helped establish the album -- rather than the 
single -- as the artistic showpiece in pop. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Marley 
</P>
<P>
No Top 10 singles, though eight of Marley's albums -- including "Rastaman 
Vibration" (No. 8 in 1976) and "Exodus" (No. 20 in 1977) -- made the Top 100 
album chart in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Marley was called everything from the Bob Dylan of reggae (for the commentary 
and grace in his music) to the Mick Jagger of reggae (for his charisma on 
stage), and both phrases made sense. But Marley's influence went far beyond the 
reggae world. There was a passion and commitment in his music and manner in the 
mid-'70s that helped remind countless rock fans and musicians of what was 
missing for much of the decade in their own music. Marley -- and reggae -- was 
especially influential in England on the Clash and other members of the 
punk/new wave uprising of the late '70s. Marley was 35 when he died of cancer 
in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Simon &amp; Garfunkel 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen Top 40 hits -- notably "The Sounds of Silence" (1965), "Mrs. Robinson" 
(1968), "The Boxer " (1969) and "Bridge Over Troubled Water" (1970). 
</P>
<P>
 Some purists will argue that the duo's soft, folk-aligned style wasn't truly 
rock, but Simon &amp; Garfunkel's music brought added breadth and dimension to 
rock. While concentrating on themes of interest to the young rock generation, 
Paul Simon's writing reflected a consciousness of traditional pop craft, 
ultimately helping rock expand its base to the thirtysomething and 
fortysomething audience. 
</P>
<P>
The Who 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen Top 40 hits -- notably "I Can See for Miles" (1967), "Pinball Wizard" 
(1969), "See Me, Feel Me" (1970) and "Won't Get Fooled Again" (1971). 
</P>
<P>
 One of the half-dozen greatest rock bands ever, though the current tour -- 
which includes stops Tuesday at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, Thursday at the 
Universal Amphitheatre and Saturday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum -- may 
offer only a distant glimpse of that greatness. The Who never achieved the mass 
acceptance of the Beatles or the Stones during its early and most creative 
years because Pete Townshend didn't write with the same pop sensibilities as 
Lennon/McCartney and Jagger/Richards. But Townshend's early music for the Who 
expressed the energy, insecurities and desires of youth with an integrity and 
force that have rarely been exhibited in any art form. 
</P>
<P>
The Near-Musts 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bobby Darin 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one Top 40 hits -- notably "Splish Splash" (1958), "Mack the Knife" 
(1959), "18 Yellow Roses" (1973) and "If I Were a Carpenter" (1966). 
</P>
<P>
 One reason Darin has been passed over by Hall of Fame voters for four years is 
that he never seemed committed to rock. After breaking into the pop charts with 
a series of rock hits (including "Early in the Morning" and "Queen of the 
Hop"), the ambitious Darin headed quickly for the adult pop market. For all his 
many changes (he also dabbled in country, R&amp;B and folk), Darin was a 
legitimate part of the first rock generation and his vocal authority and 
passion reflected the spirit of the rock experience. 
</P>
<P>
The Four Tops 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two Top 40 tunes -- notably "I Can't Help Myself" and "It's the Same Old 
Song" (both 1965), "Reach Out, I'll Be There" (1966) and "Standing in the 
Shadows of Love" (1966). 
</P>
<P>
 The Four Tops were also passed over last year, partly because the Detroit 
outfit was in the shadow of the Temptations, a more significant vocal group 
that was inducted. However, the Tops' best music -- much of it shaped by the 
team of Holland-Dozier-Holland -- was an integral part of Motown's marvelous 
first decade and an unforgettable part of the pop-rock-soul history of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Ike &amp; Tina Turner 
</P>
<P>
Six Top 40 singles as a team -- notably "A Fool in Love" (1960), "It's Gonna 
Work Out Fine" (1961), "Proud Mary" (1971) and "Nutbush City Limits" (1973). 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of Ike &amp; Tina Turner to get into the Hall of Fame last year 
was an even bigger surprise -- and disappointment -- than the Four Tops 
oversight. The duo doesn't have an impressive string of chart hits, but Ike was 
a studio pioneer and Tina's vocal on Phil Spector's recording of "River Deep, 
Mountain High" was among the most spectacular ever in rock. Still, the Turners' 
most memorable contribution to rock was their sizzling live show. 
</P>
<P>
The Yardbirds 
</P>
<P>
Six Top 40 hits -- notably "For Your Love," "Heart Full of Soul" and "I'm a 
Man" (all 1965), "Shapes of Things" (1966). 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing that keeps this English band from the "musts" category is its 
short life span. Before breaking up in 1968, however, the group came up with 
some explosive blues-rock explorations that made an extraordinary impact. The 
Yardbirds not only served as the launching pad for such classic guitar figures 
as Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page, but they also stimulated an army of 
musicians to move farther along the band's spectacularly original path. Among 
the most notable descendants: Cream and Led Zeppelin. 
</P>
<P>
Next in Line 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Animals 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen Top 40 songs -- notably "The House of the Rising Sun" (1964), "Don't 
Let Me Be Misunderstood" and "We Gotta Get Out of This Place" (both 1965) and 
"Don't Bring Me Down" (1966). 
</P>
<P>
 Though this British band carried on longer than the Yardbirds, its peak 
creative period was not much longer, one reason it isn't ranked higher. For a 
few electrifying moments in the mid-'60s, however, the Animals looked like as 
much of a contender as the Beatles and the Stones, thanks to a series of 
records that recalled the frightening intensity of the most striking early 
R&amp;B. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Cash 
</P>
<P>
Twelve Top 40 hits -- notably "I Walk the Line" (1956), "Guess Things Happen 
That Way" (1958), "Ring of Fire" (1963) and "A Boy Named Sue" (1969). 
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
   A shotgun-waving young man who was killed by police
after he stalked through a shopping mall was identified Monday as a
brother of late reggae music star Bob Marley.
   Police said they hadn't been able to explain the actions of
Anthony Booker, 19.
   ``The investigation's still going on. We don't have many
details,'' said Metro-Dade Police Lt. Glen Kay.
   Police were called to busy Cutler Ridge Mall around 3:30 p.m.
Sunday after customers saw a tall, thin young man dressed in white
and carrying a pistol-gripped .12-gauge shotgun. The man was
railing incoherently and mumbling to himself, witnesses told police.
   ``He was really mad. He was looking for someone,'' said shopper
Carol Williams, who said she was shopping with her two small
children when Booker pointed the shotgun at her, then continued on
his way.
   ``He was saying: `I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you,''' she
said.
   Shoppers scattered as the gunman walked through the mall until
police arrived.
   As an off-duty Miami police officer chased him, a police
helicopter hovered overhead and Metro-Dade police moved in, the
gunman ran through the mall parking lot, police said.
   He fired at least once. Officers returned fire, killing him,
police said.
   Booker's mother, Cedella Booker, said she didn't know what
caused her son to go to the mall with a gun.
   ``He is just a ... humble young man. When I saw him yesterday,
he didn't look like my son,'' she said.
   Friends and relatives said he had seemed upset since returning
last week from a trip to his homeland of Jamaica. They said he
hadn't been in trouble before and aspired to be a musician.
   Bob Marley, who brought the reggae music of Jamaica to
international prominence, died in Miami of a brain tumor in 1981.

<TEXT>
   A convicted robber who doubled as a
street vendor and poet has been sentenced to hang for the murder of
reggae star Peter Tosh and two of his friends.
   A jury of eight women and four men took six minutes Friday to
convict Dennis Lobban, 33, on three counts of murder.
   Justice Carl Patterson then sentenced him to hang.
   Throughout the trial which began Monday, Lobban insisted he was
innocent. He claimed he was drinking with friends far from Tosh's
house the night of Sept. 11, 1987, when Tosh, radio disc jockey
Jeff Dixon and Wilton ``Doc'' Brown were gunned down during a
robbery at Tosh's home.
   Four others survived the attack.
   Lobban, a convicted felon with a long police record, was out on
parole when the murders were committed.
   Steve Russell, 26, of Kingston, who had been charged jointly
with Lobban, was freed on Thursday. Russell's lawyer argued
successfully that the prosecution failed to show Russell was
involved in the slayings.
   Russell claimed he only drove the killers to Tosh's home without
going inside or knowing they were going to kill Tosh.
   Lobban is a ``higgler,'' or street vendor, and a ``dub poet,''
who recites poetry to reggae music. He has been convicted of eight
previous felons, ranging from illegal possession of firearms to
armed robbery.
   Lobban was escorted from court by armed guards and taken to
prison to join 188 other people on death row.
   Any appeal would go to the Jamaican Court of Appeal. The final
court of appeal is the Privy Council in England.
   Tosh, 42 years old at the time of his death, was nominated for a
Grammy in 1985 for his album, ``Captured Live.''
   In 1963, Tosh, Bob Marley and Neville Livingstone formed the
group The Wailers, which catapulted reggae's easy rhythms from the
slums of Kingston onto the world stage.
   Born Winston Herbert MacIntosh, Tosh left The Wailers in 1973.
One later Tosh group was Word, Sound and Power.
   Outside Jamaica, Tosh was perhaps best known for his
collaboration with Rolling Stones lead singer Mick Jagger on the
Smokey Robinson song, ``(You Got To) Walk and Don't Look Back,''
and for his hit, ``Legalize It,'' a plea for the legalization of
marijuana.

<P>
It's as primitive as King Kong's jungle on Skull Island. It's as basic as cops 
and doughnut shops, as basic as boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, 
boy-wants-to-kill- mother-in-law. It's only cerebral if your brains are in your 
feet. It's reggae music -- sort of Deadhead music from the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
Reggae has the beat, but it can't tell time because reggae songs seem to last 
for weeks at a time. But your feet don't care -- they know what to do. They 
move. And reggae is everywhere, except on the radio. It's even in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
And just like McDonald's, which everybody has, every town not in Jamaica seems 
to have its own reggae band. Even in the Valley. Ventura, for example, has The 
Lion I's, and Reseda has the cleverly named Urban Dread. 
</P>
<P>
The band plays on Sunday nights in Canoga Park. The locale is pretty urbanly 
dreadful, the bar of a family restaurant in a shopping center on the corner of 
a four-lane street that has a shopping center on the other three corners as 
well. Few people know this, but Valley is actually an old American Indian word 
that means "it's too hot here, and everything looks the same anyway." Sometimes 
you gotta suffer for rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, suffering has a lot to do with Urban Dread's Friday night gig at La 
Casa de la Raza in Santa Barbara. The reggae quartet is doing a benefit show 
for El Rescate, an organization that helps South American refugees. The only 
Friday night suffering that may befall you, the reggae fan, is sore feet from 
too much dancing. 
</P>
<P>
Urban Dread plays often from Orange County to Santa Barbara County -- they know 
about 100 songs, with probably 20 or 30 originals. Jason Bourne, who often sits 
in with the Lion I's, sings, plays sax and keyboards. Calvin Banks, who also 
sings, is the guitarist. Gary Stevenson plays bass and Kris Carpenter beats out 
the rhythm on the drums. In a recent interview at the band's Valley venue, 
Bourne discussed the life and times of Urban Dread: 
</P>
<P>
You guys are Valleys, why reggae? 
</P>
<P>
Reggae is good vibes music. It's world music that crosses all boundaries and is 
played in Third World countries. It's a little blues, a little rap, a little 
hip-hop and a little rock. Reggae is all about positive change, and it deals 
with issues that need to be addressed. Reggae is a reflection of things we care 
about. 
</P>
<P>
How did Urban Dread get started? 
</P>
<P>
My parents were really into music -- they are both professional musicians. A 
few years ago, I saw a couple of reggae shows that really made an impression on 
me, mostly this band called Brave New World. They inspired me to get a band 
going where I could sing and play -- that was close to three years ago. Calvin 
and I write most of the songs, but everyone in the band has an input. No one 
guy is the boss. And after being together for just a month, we started to get 
gigs. Now we play from three to five nights per week, from Orange County to 
Santa Barbara -- and I think we'll be doing some shows in San Luis Obispo soon, 
too. We can play as often as we want. 
</P>
<P>
Who are your musical influences? 
</P>
<P>
Bob Marley, Steel Pulse, Black Uhuru, Shinehead, and we all really like Pato 
Banton. 
</P>
<P>
Describe Urban Dread music. 
</P>
<P>
It's roots music from Jamaica with a customized, urbanized twist to it. We put 
a California accent on reggae music. 
</P>
<P>
What would be your dream gig and your nightmare gig? 
</P>
<P>
Our dream gig would probably be to open for Pato Banton. We don't really have a 
nightmare gig. 
</P>
<P>
Who comes to your shows? 
</P>
<P>
All sorts of people -- all sizes, all colors, all ages. Sometimes, we play 
underage places so kids can come to see us. 
</P>
<P>
What's the lowdown on this benefit for El Rescate? 
</P>
<P>
We try to do at least four concerts per years for free. And El Rescate -- that 
means "the Rescue" -- was something we felt was a very good cause, and we like 
helping people. 
</P>
<P>
Can a reggae band from the Valley get signed? 
</P>
<P>
Well, all we can do is play our hearts out and hope to get signed. We play a 
lot, and right now we're entirely self-sufficient. We're not this real 
hard-core dread reggae band; we just really love the music. We just want to 
pass along the reggae message, which can be very uplifting. 
</P>
<P>
What's the difference in the music scene between L.A. and Santa Barbara? 
</P>
<P>
Reggae is happening more along the coast than it is inland. Maybe that's 
because the beach people are more laid back -- islands, palm trees, the beach, 
all that California stuff. More people attend our shows when we play near the 
beach -- it's harder for us inland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
Urban Dread at La Casa de la Raza, 601 E. Montecito, Santa Barbara, Friday at 8 
p.m. Tickets are $7. For more information, call 486-3798.

   Street vendor-poet Dennis Lobban was
found guilty Friday and sentenced to hang for the murder of reggae
star Peter Tosh and two of his friends.
   A jury of eight women and four men took six minutes to convict
Lobban on three counts of murder.
   ``I am innocent, sir,'' Lobban answered when Justice Carl
Patterson asked if he had anything to say before sentencing him to
hang on each count.
   The judge told the jury: ``I would have arrived at the same
verdict. I have no doubt in my mind that he went there (to Tosh's
home) that night and killed Tosh and the others.
   ``It was just by chance that the other four (visitors at the
house) survived or we would have had seven people lying dead.''
   Lobban, 33, a convicted felon with a long police record, was out
on parole when the murders were committed.
   He insisted throughout the trial that he was innocent. He
claimed he was drinking with friends far from Tosh's house the
night of Sept. 11, 1987, when Tosh, radio disc jockey Jeff Dixon
and Wilton ``Doc'' Brown were murdered by three gunmen who burst
into Tosh's home.
   The trial began Monday and had been expected to last for weeks.
   Like all trials in Jamaica involving illegal firearms, it was
held behind closed doors in the Gun Court Division of Home Circuit
Court. Reporters were allowed into the courtroom on condition they
not publish the names of witnesses.
   Steve Russell, 26, of Kingston, who had been charged jointly
with Lobban, was freed on Thursday. The judge accepted a no-case
motion from Russell's lawyer, who said the prosecution failed to
show Russell was involved in the slayings.
   Russell claimed he only drove the killers to Tosh's home without
going inside or knowing they were going to kill Tosh.
   Lobban, who turned 33 on Thursday, is a ``higgler,'' or street
vendor, and a ``dub poet,'' who recites poetry to reggae music.
   He has been convicted of eight previous felons, ranging from
illegal possession of firearms to armed robbery.
   Lobban was escorted from court by armed guards and taken to
prison to join 188 other people on death row.
   Any appeal would go to the Jamaican Court of Appeal. The final
court of appeal is the Privy Council in England.

Grammy in 1985 for his album, ``Captured Live.''
   Tosh, Bob Marley and Neville Livingstone in 1963 formed the
group The Wailers, which thrust reggae's driving rhythms from the
slums of Kingston onto the world stage.
   Born Winston Herbert MacIntosh, Tosh left The Wailers in 1973.
One later Tosh group was Word, Sound and Power.

Smokey Robinson song, ``(You Got To) Walk and Don't Look Back.''

   Actress Jaclyn Smith says television has treated
her better than the silver screen.
   ``I've been offered Hollywood parts, but they were as an
`armpiece' or decoration. Or there was nudity,'' the ex-Charlie's
Angel says in this Sunday's Parade magazine.
   ``And they were just not as good as the parts I get in
television.''
   Smith, 42, admits she's happy working in TV, although Broadway
could lure her from the tube.
   ``Broadway ... now that would be something else. I'd love to do
a stage musical,'' she said.
   Smith, who has appeared in several television movies and
miniseries, stars in the NBC movie, ``Danielle Steel's
Kaleidoscope,'' later this month.

   LAS VEGAS (AP) - Phyllis McGuire of the McGuire Sisters says
there's something about diamonds that make you smile.
   McGuire, 59, who says her jewelry collection is one of the
largest in the nation, put part of it on display Wednesday for the
first time at a jewelry store near the strip, as a favor for friend
and shop owner Wayne Christensen.
   ``No two stones are alike,'' said McGuire, pointing to a canary
yellow 42-carat diamond ring she was wearing and one in a display
case. ``Each have their own personality.''
   McGuire, who keeps expensive pieces in Las Vegas and New York
bank vaults, declined to reveal their value, saying only that it
was ``in the millions.'' She and sisters Christine and Dorothy
amassed a slew of gold records in the 1950s and '60s as one of
America's hottest trios before splitting up in 1968. They returned
to the stage five years ago.
   McGuire also is known for her relationship with mobster Sam
Giancana, who was slain gangland style in Chicago. She says she's
writing a book about their time together.

   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) - Gene Autry, owner of the California
Angels since the baseball team's founding in 1961, has passed on
the duties of club president so he can devote more time to his
Western Heritage Museum in Los Angeles.
   Autry, who turned 83 last Saturday, said Thursday the move
represents a withdrawal from the daily demands of the team's
affairs.
   ``It just got to be too much for me,'' the former movie cowboy
said at an Anaheim Stadium news conference. ``I've been so involved
with other things. I'll no longer have to take phone calls every
day about the team.''
   Named as Autry's successor was Richard M. Brown, an attorney who
has represented Autry's broadcasting empire since 1981 and has sat
on the Angels' board of directors since 1986.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Rapper Will Smith, better known as The Fresh
Prince, says he may have grown up too fast.
   ``I started my music career at 16, moved out of the house when I
was 18 - got my own house, had a car and was worrying about having
my taxes done when other kids were going to the prom,'' Smith said.
   Smith, 22, who now stars in NBC's ``Fresh Prince of Bel Air,''
said in this Sunday's Parade magazine he's now making up for his
lost teen years.
   ``It would have been nice to have a few more years just hanging
out. So I'm indulging my young tendencies now,'' he said. ``I just
bought my Nintendo yesterday, and I have it set up in the living
room.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - ``Saturday Night Live'' regular Kevin Nealon
took custody of three monkeys abandoned by a Soviet circus that
went bankrupt during a U.S. tour.
   Nealon said Wednesday the Bim Bom circus left the monkeys behind
because of ``behavioral problems.''
   ``They looked like there was no fight left in them. They looked
angry and upset and helpless. It made you want to cry,'' said
Nealon's wife, Linda.
   The couple, who took custody of the monkeys on behalf of People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said they hoped to return
them to the wild, where they would not be subjected to trainers'
discipline.
   The last of the original 115-member circus returned to the
Soviet Union on Aug. 23.

   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - Percussionist Alvin Patterson of
the Jamaican reggae group The Wailers, formerly led by Bob Marley,
is recovering in Brazil after undergoing surgery following a
stroke.
   ``Alvin was moved out of intensive care today,'' Sallim Emed,
director of the Cajuru Hospital in Curitiba, said Thursday. ''The
surgery was successful nd there were no complications.''
   Patterson suffered the stroke Sunday shortly before a scheduled
concert in Curitiba, a city 1,500 miles southwest of Rio. The
operation was performed Tuesday morning.
   The Wailers, one of Jamaica's most popular reggae bands, were in
Brazil for a series of concerts. Marley died in 1981 at age 36 from
brain cancer.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Singer Garth Brooks has been named one
of the regular performers on the Grand Ole Opry country music show.
   Brooks, 28, will be the youngest of the more than 60-member cast
when he debuts Saturday night.
   Brooks also is a finalist for five Country Music Association
awards that will be presented Monday night during a nationally
televised broadcast.
   He has been nominated for male vocalist of the year, music video
of the year for ``The Dance,'' the Horizon Award for a promising
performer and single and song of the year, both for ``If Tomorrow
Never Comes.''

POP EYE: SOUND TRACK FEVER

If you've read most of the movie reviews, you know how vital it is to avoid -- 
at all costs -- the hopelessly dumb "Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventures." On 
the other hand, the film's sound track is a delight, especially for hard-rock 
fans who'll appreciate such high decibel rockers as Shark Island's "Father 
Time," Extreme's "Play With Me" and Vital Signs' "The Boys and Girls Are Doing 
It." Oddly enough, the record's most infectious potential single is "In Time," 
an ear-catching ballad performed by Robbie Robb. It's especially ear-catching 
if you've just listened to U-2's "With or Without You." We couldn't help but 
notice a curious resemblance, especially in the lilting melody and ringing 
guitar-chord departments. Think Bono would agree? . . . If they gave Grammy 
nods to reggae sound tracks, the year's most adventuresome entry would be the 
music to "The Mighty Quinn," the upcoming thriller starring Denzel Washington 
and Robert Townshend. Due out from A&amp;M Records, the sound track features "I 
Gotta Keep Moving On" by UB-40, "Groove Master" by Arrow, "Giving/Sharing" by 
Half Pint and "Send Fi Spanish Fly" by Little Twitch. The title cut, performed 
by Sheryl Lee Ralph with Cedella Marley and Sharon Marley Prendergast (both Bob 
Marley daughters), has new lyrics rewritten (with Bob Dylan's permission) to 
fit the plot of the film. . . . And thanks to Rhino Records, a classic live 
double album -- "The New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival 1976" -- is back 
in print. Available in all formats, it offers performances by Allen Toussaint, 
Lee Dorsey, Ernie K-Doe, Irma Thomas and Professor Longhair.

<HEAD>Polygram To Acquire Island Records</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polygram NV, the world's third-largest music
recording company, said Tuesday it agreed to acquire the privately
held Island music group, best known for developing Jamaican reggae
music.
   The price was not disclosed but it was rumored in recording
industry circles to be about $332 million.
   The 27-year-old, London-based Island group was founded and owned
by the Jamaican entrepreneur Chris Blackwell. It consists of the
Island Records Ltd. recording company, music publisher Island Music
Ltd. and Island Visual Arts Ltd., a company that produces music
videos.
   ``Island will continue to operate creatively as an independent
and autonomous group with Chris Blackwell as chief executive,''
David Fine, Polygram's president, said in a statement.
   Island controls recordings by the late reggae singer Bob Marley
plus those of singer Steve Winwood, the Spencer Davis Group and
others.
   It has a stable of well-known popular music artists, including
the Irish rock band U2, as well as artists such as Melissa, Anthrax
and Tom Waits.
   Financial details of the company were not disclosed.
   Also London-based, Polygram's popular artists include Dire
Straits, Elton John and Andrew Lloyd Webber.
   With annual sales of over $1.7 billion, it controls 15 percent
of the international recorded-music market.
   The company is 90 percent owned by the Dutch electronics group
NV Philips. The remaining 10 percent is owned by an institutional
investor that Philips won't identify.
   Polygram was formed in 1962 through the merger of the recording
industry operations of Philips and the West German electronics
group Siemens AG, which pulled out of the venture completely by
1987.

So where's the beat? Right here with The Lion I's, a group of seven Ventura 
County locals who do reggae right. They do original rockin' reggae that keeps 
the dance floor packed whenever and wherever they play. 
</P>
<P>
So infectious is The Lion I's beat that they could probably make a statue of a 
guy yawning in the opera get up and dance. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Raging Arb &amp; The Redheads, The Lion I's are probably the best 
draw among local bands. They play the usual places, such as Charlie's in 
Ventura. But they also have played The Ventura Theatre, a few places in Santa 
Barbara and San Luis Obispo and also at the recent Fiesta del Sol at the 
Ventura Marina. 
</P>
<P>
This Saturday, the band will open for the Jamaican reggae hot guy, Halie 
Maskel, at La Casa de la Raza in Santa Barbara, home to hardwood floors, cheap 
beer and killer burritos. 
</P>
<P>
The Lion I's feature Bobby Galyan on vocals, Guy Jeans on keyboards, Dave 
Spasiano on guitar, Robert Cadeel on drums, Brian Conaway on sax, Bruce Conaway 
on bass and Tony Soria on trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first started, Bobby and I used to do all these old blues covers," 
said Jeans, who is studying to be an elementary school teacher. "Then we met 
Dave and started doing a lot of parties, at least, until the cops came. We met 
Bruce and Brian, hit it off real well, and they joined and the band became 
better. Tony is the newest member. He joined two months ago." 
</P>
<P>
"We became a reggae band because we all like reggae," Galyan said. "We all like 
Steel Pulse, Black Uhuru, the English Beat and Bob Marley. We only do about 
four covers -- we've got over 20 originals, maybe three albums worth of stuff. 
We practice twice a week and play at least once a week. We're working on a tape 
right now, or maybe it'll be a CD. Anyway, whatever it is, it'll have about 10 
tunes on it." 
</P>
<P>
"We just want to get a tape out and get signed," Spasiano said. "Right now, 
everyone has a day job. I'm a Realtor, and a waiter at night. Guy delivers gum 
to machines; Bobby's in construction." 
</P>
<P>
The band is an example of democracy with a beat. "Everyone in the band has 
input, but I do a lot of music, and Bobby writes a lot of the lyrics," Jeans 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the tunes that inevitably pack the dance floor are "Closer," "Time Will 
Tell," "Gimme Some Time" and "Who to Trust." All of these songs are at least 
five minutes long, sometimes longer, and guaranteed to get the dancers in shape 
-- or kill them off. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't played our best gig yet," Galyan said, "but last December when we 
opened for Bamiki Bandula at The Ventura Theatre, we sounded pretty damn good. 
We love that big stage. 
</P>
<P>
"When we play, we want people to have a good time," Galyan said. "I just tell 
everybody to chill out. We don't want no violence; violence can ruin a band." 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: On Saturday, The Lion I's will open for Halie Maskel at La 
Casa de la Raza at 601 E. Montecito St. in Santa Barbara. Tickets are $10. For 
more information call 965-8581.

   Maxi Priest recently was out shopping in London
and decided to buy some clothes. He found a nice store, selected a
pair of trousers and went into the dressing room.
   When he came out, a line had formed for autographs.
   ``Obviously, the attention is there a lot more than it was
before,'' said Priest, whose sunny smile and sunny No. 1 single,
``Close to You,'' have made him a man worth waiting for.
   ``When I go to a club I like to find my little corner and dance
and see what's going on, trying to enjoy myself the way I used to
enjoy myself.''
   He insists that success won't change him. And even if you've
heard that a million times before, this time it might be true;
Priest has always been the center of attention. Aunts and uncles
fussed over him. Girls followed him in high school. Party guests
gave him money.
   ``I was brought up in a family of nine kids and I was the second
youngest,'' said Priest, 27, who grew up in southeast London.
``When you grow up in a big family, there's so many personalities
that you learn to deal with all different kinds of people. That
also helped me develop my personality.''
   Priest, speaking at the Manhattan offices of Charisma Records,
considers himself an international artist and his songs have popped
up all over the world. His debut release, the 1984 single ``Hey
Little Girl,'' became the first British reggae song to top the
charts in Jamaica. In 1988, he had an unlikely hit with a cover of
Cat Stevens' ``Wild World,'' a No. 1 single for four weeks in
England.
   But ``Close to You,'' his breakthrough American single, was the
most satisfying achievement for Priest. He only recorded ``Wild
World'' at the request of the record company and criticized the
song even after it became successful. ``Close to You,'' with its
funky track and breezy hook, was his idea.
   ``I was on my way to my writing suite in England, and I was
singing the hook, `I just want to be close to you,' '' Priest
recalled. ``When I got to the studio, I started to sing and the
other writers kind of dropped everything else. It just fell into
place.''
   Priest co-wrote seven of the 12 songs on his new album,
``Bonafide,'' a mix of pop, reggae and gospel. Included are love
songs such as ``Just a Little Bit Longer'' and ``Temptress,'' and
the more message-oriented ``Prayer for the World'' and ``Peace
Throughout the World.''
   He wanted diversity, bringing in 15 other songwriters and using
four sets of producers, including Grammy Award-winners Jazzie B and
Nellee Hooper of Soul II Soul.
   ``The album is almost the closest I've been to the ultimate
album I want to make, with all different styles of music for all
different types of people,'' Priest said.
   ``There are party songs. There are message songs, love songs.
It's almost like a personal cassette - a compilation of songs, with
different tempos and different feelings.''
   Priest created his own studio at age 14 and soon joined Saxon
International as a deejay for ``Sound System.'' In 1985, he signed
with 10 Records in England and released his debut album, ``You're
Safe.''
   Influences include Dennis Brown, Bob Marley, Motown, the Beatles
and Louis Armstrong. He listened to them all as a kid, but not just
for entertainment. Priest was already checking them out, looking
for tips on phrasing and songwriting.
   He thinks he's close to becoming a major star. ``Just a Little
Bit Longer'' is the next single off ``Bonafide'' and Priest
predicts if that becomes a hit, ``All doors are open.''
   ``It's a reggae track,'' he explained, `` `Close to You' is more
pop; they're very different songs. If that makes it, there are a
lot of other songs that could make it.''
   His shopping days would then be over, but Priest accepts that as
destiny. ``I know I've been gifted by god,'' he said. ``I think
there's a light shining on me.''
   Even if he decides to stay on the ``normal side'' of life, his
prayers are for peace, love and more hit singles, a humble way of
slipping payola to the lord.

   In another move toward consolidation in the record industry, N.V. Philips's Polygram Records unit agreed to buy one of the industry's biggest closely held labels, rap and reggae music specialist Island Records Ltd. 

   The price that Polygram is paying for the U.K. company, estimated by analysts at roughly $300 million, stunned many in the record industry, who said the figure is about 25 times Island's earnings. 
But Island is a rapidly vanishing commodity, an independent record company with a small but respectable market share, and Polygram is apparently willing to pay top dollar to grab those crucial share points in the U.S. market for records, tapes and compact disks. 

   Island, which is distributed by Warner Communications Inc. in the U.S., has about 1.4% of the U.S. market for pop albums, which would boost Polygram's share to about 9% from 7.6% currently. 
In addition to such big reggae artists as the late Bob Marley and Jimmie Cliff, Island's musicians in other fields have included Cat Stevens, Jethro Tull, U2 and, recently, a gaggle of U.S. rap musicians including current hit-maker Tone Loc. 

   The price Polygram is paying "is a lot of money, and it indicates how important the record business is becoming," said David Geffen, chairman of Geffen Records Co., Los Angeles, one of the only remaining independent record concerns. 
He added that "record companies are becoming as rare as hen's teeth, and by the end of the decade, there probably won't be anybody left except the five international distributors (Warner, CBS Records, Polygram, Thorn-EMI PLC and Bertelsman Music Group) and one domestic distributor (MCA Inc.'s MCA Records). 

   Indeed, in recent years, even giants have been gobbled up. 
Warner's dominant record unit was one of the main attractions for Time Inc., which agreed to buy the parent company for $14 billion last month. 
Two years ago, Sony Corp. bought CBS Records, and Bertelsmann AG bought RCA Records. 
The Island purchase will cap a series of acquisitions of smaller companies by the world's recording giants. 
Recently, Thorn-EMI paid about $80 million for a 50% stake in Britain's Chrysalis Records, and a group including MCA bought Motown Records for $61 million. 

   Like Island, most "independents" already rely on industry giants to manufacture and distribute their records globally. 
But their ever-growing thirst for cash in bidding for big-name musicians has driven them to seek financial ties -- including outright ownership -- with the industry majors. 
And the larger companies are all too eager to buy in their quest to expand market share. 

   Industry executives said Warner had considered buying Island, but at only a fraction of the price Polygram paid because it didn't badly need the market share. 
According to Billboard Magazine, Warner's pop music share, which includes Island's tiny share, was 44.4% in the six months ended July 1, up from 33.2% a year earlier. 
By contrast, one record industry executive said, "Polygram is looking at it from a different perspective -- for the first time they clearly have a shot at being No. 2 or 3 in the record business, and it's clearly worth more to them to take that shot." 

   While Polygram's market share slipped to 7.6% in July from 8.8% a year earlier, its larger rivals have lost share as well. 
CBS Records' share dropped to about 14.2% of the market from 18.2% in the same period last year, while the third-ranked company, Bertelsmann Music Group, dropped to 10.8% from 17.6% 

   Rapid U.S. expansion is a prime goal of Polygram, which on a world-wide basis ranks third in the industry. 
Polygram's Deutsche Grammophon, Decca and Philips Classics labels already command more than half the U.S. market for classical recordings, but in the bigger, more-lucrative pop and rock field, Polygram is an alsoran. 
Jan Cook, Polygram's chief financial officer, said the unit of Philips, an Anglo-Dutch concern, plans further U.S. pop and rock expansion by buying other small labels and boosting investment in its current U.S. operations. 

   Island, which grew on the reggae-music boom from Jamaica, said its annual revenue is about $200 million. 
The need for a powerful backer drove Island to Polygram, Island founder and Chairman Chris Blackwell said yesterday. 
As Island grew, it found itself competing more often with industry giants for high-priced talent, yet lacked the cash to outbid them. 
"We were too big to be small, and too small to be big," Mr. Blackwell said. 

   He added, however, that he doesn't expect all the industry's independents to be bought up by giants. 
"Independents are the lifeblood of this business," he said, and are the source of most new trends in the music business. 

   Mr. Blackwell, 52 years old, started producing records in the late 1950s in Jamaica, where his family had been part of the British colonial establishment for generations. 
His first recordings, which he produced and peddled to specialty music shops, were of the island's emerging reggae music culture. 
As the reggae beat spread through Britain and the U.S. in the 1970s, his roster of reggae musicians grew to include its biggest stars. 

   Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed, but Mr. Blackwell said he will receive about 30% of the purchase price. 
The remainder, he said, goes to Island's two other, undisclosed investor groups. 

   Polygram's Mr. Cook said Island will be run as a separate Polygram division under Mr. Blackwell's management. 
He added that Polygram, which already distributes Island recordings in Britain, will also handle the smaller company's distribution elsewhere when existing contracts expire. 
Island's biggest contract, with Warner in the U.S., expires next year, he said.

FIXED IN THE MIX: Talk about patting yourself on the back. The 12-inch version 
of Ziggy Marley's hit, "Tumblin' Down," is loaded with a hefty chunk of 
sampling (excerpts of previously recorded songs) from the 1982 Tom Tom Club 
hit, "Genius of Love." And guess who produced Marley's album? Tom Tom Club duo 
(and Talking Heads members) Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth. But wait -- it 
turns out that the duo didn't plug their old hit in "Tumblin'." In fact, 
according to Tom Tom Club manager Gary Kurfirst, Frantz and Weymouth had "no 
idea" their old song was on the 12-inch single. 
</P>
<P>
"All that sampling stuff wasn't on the original version of 'Tumblin' which 
Chris and Tina produced," said Kurfirst. "Apparently when Virgin (Marley's 
label) remixed the 12-inch, someone added the sampling. No one even asked for 
our approval." 
</P>
<P>
Since Frantz and Weymouth receive royalties as the record's producers -- and 
are slated to handle Marley's next album -- they're happy to see the record on 
the charts. Kurfirst added: "We just don't want anyone to think that Chris and 
Tina took advantage of their producer's role to push their hit on Ziggy's 
record."

TRACY CHAPMAN SCORES BUT MISSES A GRAMMY RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tracy Chapman was derailed Wednesday in her bid to become the most honored 
debut artist in the 31-year history of the record industry's Grammy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
The singer-songwriter, whose folk-flavored tales about society's underclass 
scored critical and commercial triumphs in 1988, won Grammys for best new 
artist, contemporary folk recording and female pop vocal. 
</P>
<P>
But Chapman lost to Bobby McFerrin's "Don't Worry, Be Happy" in the best song 
category, eliminating any chance that she could break the record of five 
Grammys set in 1980 by Christopher Cross' debut album. 
</P>
<P>
The folk award was among 61 announced during a pre-telecast ceremony at the 
Shrine Auditorium, site of the nationally televised event sponsored by the 
6,000-member National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
Other artists who picked up multiple awards during the pre-telecast affair were 
Anita Baker, best female rhythm and blues vocal and best rhythm and blues song; 
the Irish rock band U2, saluted for rock group vocal and music performance 
video; Robin Williams, children's recording and comedy recording; Robert Shaw 
and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, classical album, orchestral recording and 
choral recording, and Sir Georg Solti, opera recording and chamber music. 
</P>
<P>
Coupled with his best song victory, McFerrin's award Wednesday for best male 
pop vocal was his seventh Grammy citation since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The country mother-and-daughter team The Judds were honored for best country 
vocal by a duo or group for their recording of "Give a Little Love." It was 
their fourth victory in that category in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
The late Roy Orbison won his second career Grammy, cited for his country vocal 
collaboration with k.d. Lang on a remake of his own '60s hit, "Crying." 
</P>
<P>
After accepting the award for her husband, who died of a heart attack on Dec. 
6, Barbara Orbison said backstage, "Roy was so fortunate to have felt the love 
of the fans and the whole world before he passed on." 
</P>
<P>
On a lighter note, veteran blues man Willie Dixon, whose win in the best 
traditional blues recording category was his first Grammy ever, quipped to the 
press backstage, "Better late than never. I give in and I give out, but I don't 
give up." 
</P>
<P>
As the pre-telecast awards were announced inside the auditorium, about 350 fans 
waited outside the Shrine, hoping to catch glimpses of the recording stars as 
they entered the building. Unlike the Oscars, where film personalities make a 
big splash by entering the building through the front door, most of the 
performers and big-name guests at the Grammys enter the building through a 
backstage area that is blocked off to fans. 
</P>
<P>
Once the telecast began inside the hall, Chapman's quest to break Cross' 1980 
record provided the most drama. (The record for most Grammys in a single 
evening was eight, a mark achieved in 1984 by Michael Jackson.) 
</P>
<P>
Chapman's pop female vocal award was the first award announced on the program, 
and the singer accepted the Grammy with the same shy, retiring manner that 
characterizes her concert appearances. She later returned to the stage to be 
acknowledged as the best new artist. 
</P>
<P>
Until her Elektra album was released last spring, Cleveland-born Chapman, now 
24, was little known outside the club circuit in Boston, where she was living 
while attending Tufts University. 
</P>
<P>
Because the stark realism in her themes -- many of which deal with such 
subjects as welfare mothers and children victimized by racism -- is so far from 
the upbeat, dance-minded music that has dominated Top 40 radio station play 
lists in recent years, Chapman's album was considered a commercial long shot 
when it was released. 
</P>
<P>
But the reaction was dramatic: glowing reviews and album sales of more than 2 
million. Chapman climaxed her remarkable year by co-starring with Bruce 
Springsteen and Sting on Amnesty International's worldwide "Human Rights Now!" 
tour last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Her most popular song, "Fast Car," was a look at a woman's struggle to break 
free of emotional and economic bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The single was up Wednesday for best record. Chapman was also nominated for 
best album, song and new artist. 
</P>
<P>
Though the music academy has made great strides in recent years in reducing 
criticism for being out of touch with "cutting edge" elements in pop music, 
there was one embarrassment Wednesday when three nominees in the newly 
established rap category said they were boycotting the show because the rap 
award was not included among the 15 awards announced during the telecast. 
</P>
<P>
Will Smith, the Fresh Prince of rap duo D. J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh 
Prince, said at an afternoon press conference in West Hollywood: "We're not 
anti-Grammy. Our problem is with the 1989 Grammy Awards show. It's like you go 
to school for 12 years and they give you a diploma, but you aren't allowed to 
walk down the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like we got F's through school; we got straight A's," he said, 
referring to the group's artistic and sales credentials. The duo's latest 
album, "He's the D. J., I'm the Rapper," has sold more than 2 million copies. 
Also not attending the ceremony: rap nominees Salt-N-Pepa and L. L. Cool J. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, D. J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince won the rap award. 
</P>
<P>
First time winners in jazz included Take 6 (group vocal), Betty Carter (female 
vocal), Michael Brecker (solo instrumental). Others winning Grammys for the 
first time included Carlos Santana (rock instrumental), Bill Monroe 
(bluegrass), Shadowfax (new age recording), Roberto Carlos (Latin pop 
performance), Ziggy Marley &amp; the Melody Makers (reggae). 
</P>
<P>
Repeat winners: Robert Palmer, named best rock vocalist for the second time; 
Amy Grant, female gospel performance, her fifth award; Larnelle Harris, male 
gospel performance, fifth award; David Sanborn, pop instrumental, fifth award; 
Robert Cray Band, contemporary blues recording, third award. 
</P>
<P>
"Into the Woods" was judged best musical cast show album, while Mike Post's 
"The Theme From L.A. Law" was named best instrumental composition. "The Last 
Emperor" was voted best album of original musical score written for a motion 
picture or television. Phil Collins' "Two Hearts" was named best song written 
for a motion picture or television. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Jesse Jackson won a Grammy in the spoken-documentary field for a 
speech that was included in Aretha Franklin's "One Lord, One Faith, One 
Baptism" album.

PREVIEW: THE BEACH AND REGGAE CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
What's better than beach music in a surf bar? Reggae and ska, say the operators 
of Toes Tavern in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
The nightspot is part of a three-club chain with a decided beach motif. 
Surfboards hang from the ceiling. Pictures of waves and surfers cover the 
walls. The DJ booth is a lifeguard stand. 
</P>
<P>
And at a pre-Fourth of July party Tuesday night, the ocean theme will crest 
with the giveaway of a $500 long board. 
</P>
<P>
But the music that night won't be from Beach Boys or Jan and Dean. 
</P>
<P>
The group Jah Bone will play songs by Bob Marley, the English Beat and UB40. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun music, party music," said Jah Bone drummer Ken Kobel. "It's more 
danceable than beach music because you get more of a back beat that people can 
pick up." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night's performance will be Jah Bone's debut at the 55,000-square-foot 
Toes Tavern in Canoga Park, which opened in January. But the six-member group 
is a veteran of the sister clubs in Redondo Beach and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"In Redondo we get the beach crowd," Kobel said, "and in Pasadena it's more of 
a college crowd. They seem to enjoy the music the most. From what I hear, the 
Valley crowd is like the one in Pasadena, so I expect we'll have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
Bar manager Dave Radanovich said Toes Tavern draws a young clientele. 
</P>
<P>
"They're 22 to 30 or 35," he said. "It's the white-bread crowd." 
</P>
<P>
The Jah Bone instrumental lineup consists of guitar, bass, drums, keyboard, 
saxophone and trombone. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us were in a group called the Generals for three or four years," Kobel 
said. "We played all around Redondo -- the Lighthouse, beach parties, the Toes 
club there." 
</P>
<P>
Toes Tavern owner John Stafford said the nightclub chain is named after Toes 
Beach in Playa del Rey, which in turn was named for the long-boarding 
expression "toes over." 
</P>
<P>
He said reggae music in a surf club "really gets the people moving." 
</P>
<P>
That's gnarly, Marley. 
</P>
<P>
 Jah Bone will play at 9:30 p.m. Tuesday at Toes Tavern, 7230 Topanga Canyon 
Blvd., Canoga Park. No cover or drink minimum. Information: (818) 347-7668.

   An abortion clinic says it may use reggae
music's positive vibrations to drown out the chants of protesters
at its door.
   Mary Litman, a spokeswoman for Women's Health Services Inc. of
Pittsburgh, said the clinic may hire a reggae band to play during
the next large protest by Project Multitude, a Pittsburgh
anti-abortion group.
   The band would play louder than singing protesters and,
possibly, drive away those who dislike reggae music, Ms. Litman
said. The blend of rock 'n' roll and calypso is performed by such
Jamaican artists as Yellowman and the late Bob Marley.
   ``We are going to take the initiative and try to have some
control over what goes on,'' Ms. Litman said.
   In June, Women's Health Services solicited pledges from
supporters based on the number of people who attended an
anti-abortion demonstration. The clinic collected $2,800 after 350
people attended the protest, or about $8 per picket, Ms. Litman
said.
   ``I would rather that our patients and their husbands and
mothers and friends be able to walk into our clinic in total
privacy,'' Ms. Litman said. ``But we cannot keep the pickets away,
so we will use this to thumb our noses at them.''
   The pledge drives and other tactics will not deter the protests,
including one planned for September, said Mary Irwin, director of
Project Multitude.
   ``If the Ku Klux Klan tried to make money off the number of
blacks protesting in Alabama, I hope that would not discourage them
for standing up for what is right in Selma,'' Ms. Irwin said.

POP CAPSULES: SHINEHEAD ELECTRIFIES 'REGGAE SUNSPLASH' CONCERT 
</P>

If the Greek was an indoor theater, Shinehead's opening reggae-rap-rock salvo 
"Unity" would have torn the roof off at Saturday's "Reggae Sunsplash" concert. 
The lanky New Yorker electrified the crowd's spirit of amiable anarchy by 
strolling through the audience (unescorted by security guards) during a 
sparkling set that again confirmed his enormous potential. 
</P>
<P>
Marcia Griffiths unintentionally built on Shinehead's energy when she invited 
audience members on stage to demonstrate the "electric slide" dance to her 1989 
hit "Electric Boogie." Bad move -- the stage was instantly inundated with fans, 
but what could have been a momentum-breaking debacle turned positive when 
everyone maintained his cool while clearing the stage. Griffiths then kept the 
fire stoked with a triumphant medley of Bob Marley's "Three Little Birds" and 
"Buffalo Soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
Headliner Burning Spear represented reggae's old school, blending blues-rock 
lead guitar, horn punctuations and bass-heavy grooves around his inimitably 
coarse, rich vocals. His trance-dance moves seemed more inspired by some 
private muse than show-biz convention, and just when the hypnotic grooves 
bordered on deadening, Spear's nine-piece band exploded into some thunderous 
dub excursions. 
</P>
<P>
Also performing were smooth singer Freddie McGregor, energetic dance-hall diva 
Shelly Thunder and U-Roy. "Reggae Sunsplash" hits San Diego's Open Air Theatre 
Thursday, Irvine Meadows on Saturday. DON SNOWDEN

POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: 1989 THE YEAR AHEAD; 
</P>
<P>
LETTING LOOSE WITH A LOT OF WISHFUL THINKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Boehm

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I used to work for a newspaper that ran a weekly column of football 
point-spread predictions under the heading, "Watch, but Don't Bet." 
</P>
<P>
The rationale for that curious title seemed to be that, while prognostication 
is too delicious to forgo, the sporting seers weren't about to be held 
responsible if anyone took them seriously and lost the milk money. 
</P>
<P>
In that spirit, here are some predictions for the coming year in pop. You can 
call this column of guesses, fantasies and wishful thinking "Read, but Don't 
Believe": 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the Redcoats will be coming again -- but it will be nothing for rock 
fans to shout about, let alone Paul Revere. This year marks the 25th 
anniversary of the British rock invasion of 1964. Veterans of that 
revolutionary assault will stage comebacks to exploit the occasion, with mostly 
dubious results. 
</P>
<P>
The Who has already announced plans for a reunion album. It will turn out to be 
a humdrum affair, further tarnishing a once-imposing legacy that diminished 
considerably with the albums after Keith Moon's death in 1978. This is one band 
that should have let its career die before it got old. 
</P>
<P>
The lure of megabucks will help the Rolling Stones reconcile their differences 
and tour again. But megabucks will also dictate a shoddy, exploitative tour of 
outdoor stadiums rather than indoor shows that might have generated some real 
heat. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards will produce another lukewarm Stones 
album, no better and no worse than anything they have done since "Some Girls." 
</P>
<P>
Paul McCartney and George Harrison won't reunite, but they will have something 
in common: Each will release a mediocre solo album and mount a mediocre tour. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison will have better luck, however, as a Traveling Wilbury. The group will 
release another strong album, with Don and Phil Everly taking over for the late 
Roy Orbison. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the less famous '60s British invaders will pull off some of the more 
rewarding reunions. The Zombies will come up with a charming album, and so will 
the Hollies. The Kinks will announce early in the year that they have 
disbanded, ending their run as the longest-lived of all rock bands (at least as 
a continuously functioning unit). But the Kinks, who have cried wolf before 
about calling it quits, will come back strong before year's end with the first 
reunion of their original lineup since 1969. The Bee Gees will shuck the disco 
jive and make an appealing album harking back to their days as a folk-rock 
harmony band. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, 1989 will be the year that harmony and pop bel canto make a strong 
comeback. Noting how well Bobby McFerrin did in '88, many acts in R&amp;B will 
rediscover the traditions of the great Motown vocal groups -- the Supremes, the 
Temptations and the Miracles. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of yelling along to a beat box, young ghetto musicians will gather once 
more to sing a cappella on street corners. The result will be a welcome 
transformation for rap music, which in 1989 will begin to mature with a melding 
of tough rhythms and spoken raps interspersed with adventurous, melodic singing 
in a sort of recitative/aria structure. The creative and commercial 
possibilities of this combination will be limitless, propelling black music 
into the '90s on a decided upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Chapman will use her new acclaim in the finest, most adventuresome way, 
by mounting a joint tour, and perhaps recording an album, with Sweet Honey in 
the Rock -- the outstanding, all-female, socially trenchant a cappella 
folk-singing group from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
One of the year's biggest music-related controversies will erupt when a major 
pop figure releases an anthem lauding the PLO and demanding Palestinian 
national rights. The outcome will determine whether rockers stick to such easy, 
uncontroversial issues as human rights (who is publicly for torture and 
repression?) and apartheid (who, outside of South Africa, believes in it?). 
</P>
<P>
Independent record labels will continue to die. Ownership of record companies 
will become so concentrated that an organized movement of musicians, critics 
and fans will arise to lobby federal authorities to move to break up the 
entertainment cartels. Bruce Springsteen will be the first major rocker to 
declare that small is beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County will finally get the full-time, night-in, night-out original rock 
music club it needs. This will happen when Sam Lanni, former proprietor of 
Safari Sam's, hits the lottery and becomes filthy rich overnight. Plowing his 
winnings into a club, Lanni will found a new Safari Sam's that serves both as a 
showcase stage and a social meeting ground for the local music scene. 
</P>
<P>
The new Sam's will also bring to Orange County innovative, lesser-known touring 
talent that previously only played Los Angeles. Anti-rock municipal authorities 
will try to undermine the new Sam's, much as they succeeded in doing with the 
original one. This time, able to afford a team of experts in First Amendment 
law, Lanni will take the stuffed shirts to court and win in a rout. 
</P>
<P>
Before we get on with the new year, let's have the '88 nominees for the Pop 
Hall of Shame: 
</P>
<P>
Ziggy Marley, purported heir to his father's reggae ministry as poet of the 
downtrodden, appears in a Rolling Stone magazine fashion spread wearing clothes 
priced at several times the per-capita wealth of many Third World countries. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Reed, whose name had been synonymous with uncompromising, hard-edged rock, 
takes an unfortunate walk on the mild side. Performing in the Grammy Awards 
program, Reed kowtows to the demands of national prime time television by 
expurgating sexually explicit verses from "Walk on the Wild Side." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Winwood jumped on the gravy train by writing a song for a beer 
commercial, then included it on his hit album, "Roll With It," which was a dull 
rehash of his previous hit album. John Barleycorn must die, Steve-o. 
</P>
<P>
Pink Floyd ripped off its public by taking what had been a fine indoor arena 
show with crisp sound and vivid lighting effects and moving it, unchanged, into 
outdoor stadiums where the sound and effects were swallowed up. 
</P>

like Run D.M.C., below. And maybe Orange County will finally get a full-time

the lottery. Los Angeles Times

CARIBBEAN CARNIVALS -- A MAGICAL BLEND OF DIVERSE CULTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ST. THOMAS, Smithsonian News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Behind the Caribbean's sandy beaches, palm trees and fruity rum drinks is a 
festival waiting to happen. A festival, Caribbean style, is part street party, 
part masquerade and part jam session. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers to Trinidad know that a Caribbean festival is not a spectator sport. 
Unlike an American parade, where people line the sidewalks watching the bands 
march and majorettes twirl, audience participation is part and parcel of 
Caribbean festivals. When a Carnival band goes by, playing its infectious 
calypso or steel-band music, the audience jumps in and dances in the street 
with the music makers. 
</P>
<P>
"The music almost forces you to participate," said singer and poet Hollis 
(Flash) Lashley, a native of Trinidad who lives in Silver Spring, Md. "It's 
what our Caribbean culture is all about. The movement and music and color of a 
festival are an integral part of who we are and how we live." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Take Festivals Along 
</P>
<P>
These festivals have become such an important part of peoples' lives in the 
Caribbean that they don't leave home without them. Wherever West Indians settle 
in large numbers, their festivals are likely to follow. Brooklyn, Toronto, 
Baltimore, Boston and London have all been host to Caribbean festivals. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Smithsonian Institution is recognizing these annual events 
as an art and as the cultural expressions of the people of the Caribbean in a 
new exhibition, "Caribbean Festival Arts," continuing until Feb. 15, 1990. The 
exhibition, originally organized by the St. Louis Art Museum, is complemented 
by dozens of special events, including live performances of calypso and 
steel-band music, crafts and costume-making demonstrations, films and 
educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
"In presenting three festivals -- Junkanoo, Carnival and Hosay from Trinidad 
and Tobago -- we hope to give North American audiences a sense of the Caribbean 
culture," Vera Hyatt, the Smithsonian's project director for the exhibition, 
said. "The essence of this culture is a synthesis of many influences: African, 
English, French, Indian and Spanish. A kind of cross-fertilization took place 
in the islands of the West Indies and the result is a culture that is unique to 
the Caribbean." 
</P>
<P>
In the exhibit, as in a real-life festival, the dominant themes are music and 
masquerade. Music is at the heart of any festival, whether it is reggae in 
Jamaica or French songs in Haiti or steel bands in Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
European Influences 
</P>
<P>
Original Carnival music can be traced to European influences -- to minstrel 
bands and court music. The African sounds of drums were introduced in the 17th 
Century when millions of African slaves worked on the sugar-cane plantations 
dotting the islands. 
</P>
<P>
Calypso was introduced in the mid-1800s in Trinidad where slaves sang the 
call-and-response songs and humorous ditties of their African homelands. 
Today's soca, popular music combining calypso and American soul, began in 1975 
with the release of two recordings, "Sweet Music" and "Endless Vibration" by 
singer Lord Shorty. 
</P>
<P>
Reggae originated in the mid-1960s as a music of the Jamaican poor. The 
distinctive sound of reggae's loud electric bass with organ, piano and drums, 
was popularized in the United States in the early 1970s in the film "The Harder 
They Come," starring singer Jimmy Cliff, and through tours of Bob Marley and 
the Wailers. 
</P>
<P>
But the drum provides the pulse of all Caribbean music, and nowhere is that 
more obvious than in the steel band. The pan or steel drum tradition goes back 
to the drums of Africa. When the Trinidad government banned drums in 1883 on 
the grounds that they were loud and disruptive, the "tambour bamboo" bands 
played on, using bamboo cylinders similar to the African Shango drum ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Found' Instruments 
</P>
<P>
Fifty years later, bands were experimenting with an array of "found 
instruments" -- including kettles, salt boxes and paint cans -- to give louder, 
stronger sounds. 
</P>
<P>
On V-E Day, May 8, 1945, everything from trash cans to biscuit tins was fair 
game for the drummers rejoicing in the streets. One year later, a new device 
arrived on the Carnival scene -- the 55-gallon oil drum, used to ship 
Venezuelan oil to refineries in Trinidad, Aruba, Curacao and other Caribbean 
islands. The unique sound qualities of the oil drums and their availability 
made them immediately -- and lastingly -- popular. 
</P>
<P>
Today, some say that Carnival without pan would be like nature without color. 
Journalist Knolly Moses, a Trinidadian living in New York City, occasionally 
plays pan and describes the experience this way: "A veil is lifted and it takes 
everyone over. It's almost as if I'm possessed. The music is that powerful. Our 
goal is to bring everyone together with our music." 
</P>
<P>
The costume of masquerade of festivals is also steeped in traditions that can 
be traced to the days of slavery and rule by European colonists. Jamaica's 
Junkanoo traditionally celebrated in late December, today is often presented on 
important state occasions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Masks Came in Handy 
</P>
<P>
Junkanoo is the perfect illustration of African and European influences, 
according to Judith Bettelheim, co-curator of "Caribbean Festival Arts" and 
professor of art at San Francisco State University. The masks worn during 
festivals came in handy during the years before emancipation, she said, since 
slaves could make fun of their owners during festivals while remaining 
anonymous behind their disguises. 
</P>
<P>
Costumes are also essential to Carnival, and today many people begin planning 
next year's creation the minute this year's festival is over. 
</P>
<P>
Masquerade bands number from 100 to 5,000 members; a band leader sets the theme 
for his group, which can be literally anything under the sun -- from sailors to 
extraterrestrials. A 1981 band, "Jungle Fever," organized by Trinidad's Peter 
Minshall, required 2,500 costumes, 15 seamstresses and more than two dozen 
painters and decorators. The band's most spectacular costume measured 15-by-2O 
feet and sparkled with 220,000 hand-stitched sequins. Regardless of theme, the 
bands' most elaborate masquerades are made of wire structures covered with 
brilliantly colored and decorated fabric. 
</P>
<P>
The costumes and bands are different every year but, according to poet Lashley, 
a veteran of more than 20 Carnivals, a traditional Carnival will include at 
least one American Indian, a sailor and a casual, randomly costumed Ole Mas 
(Masquerade) band. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Costumes a Treasure 
</P>
<P>
Roslyn Ledley, who lives in Brooklyn, N.Y., said she began wearing costumes at 
Carnival as a child when she would "dress in a little nonsense." She now 
treasures her costumes. "I feel so good because other people can see what we 
can do with a few pieces of material," Ledley said. "We make these costumes 
come alive in the streets." 
</P>
<P>
Exhibition curator John Nunley of the St. Louis Art Museum sees the costumes 
themselves as art. "These modern urban costume designers," he said, "are 
artists who use non-traditional objects -- tinsel, aluminum, mirrors and bottle 
caps -- to fashion their masquerades, which remind me of dancing mobiles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the almost magical combination of music and masquerade that makes these 
festivals unique," Nunley added. "The costumes are a visual art but the rhythm 
and beat of the music is what draws people into the celebration." 
</P>
<P>
Trinidad hosts what one guidebook calls the "granddaddy of all festivals." 
Carnival-goers begin preparation in January when costumes are designed and 
steel-band rehearsals begin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
King and Queen Named 
</P>
<P>
On the Friday before Carnival, celebrated during the week before Ash Wednesday, 
contests are held to select the king and queen. On Saturday, thousands of 
schoolchildren play mas on the streets of Port-of-Spain and that evening the 
steel-band competition, or Pan-O-Rama, is held. Bands play through the night 
and on Sunday in preparation for Jouvay (from the French for opening day) 
Monday, when bands parade through the streets of the city to Independence 
Square. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Carnival's grand finale, the air is filled with the sounds of 
soca, calypso and steel bands as the revelers parade over an outdoor stage to 
show off their costumes. 
</P>
<P>
Carnival is as unique to Trinidad as Junkanoo is to Jamaica. But, in their own 
ways, they are unifying events. "The festivals of these islands are what bring 
the various elements of the diverse cultures together," the Smithsonian's Hyatt 
said. "It is the one art form that cuts across the social and economic 
stratification that is so prevalent in the Caribbean."

   Katie Kelly, who quit her job as a movie
critic on ``Entertainment Tonight'' to teach English to children in
Vietnam, is a hit in her hometown.
   Today was Katie Kelly Day in Albion, a town of 2,000 about 140
miles northwest of Omaha.
   Ms. Kelly has been tutoring Amerasians in Vietnam since March.
She described her work as ``an experience of a lifetime; I wouldn't
have passed it up.''
   Vietnam, she said, ``has grabbed me by the heart. The people are
absolutely incredible _ friendly, social, generous. They have
nothing, but they'd give you the shirt off their back.''
   Ms. Kelly's works in the Amerasian Transient Center, recently
constructed by the U.S. government in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly
Saigon. Her students have ranged in age from 5 to 51.

   A handful of Baptist ministers complained
that Pat Conroy's use of profanity in some of his best-selling
novels made him unsuitable as Furman University's commencement
speaker.
   Conroy, whose books include ``The Lords of Discipline,'' ``The
Prince of Tides'' and ``The Great Santini,'' was to give Furman's
commencement address today.
   The clergymen sent protest letters to John E. Johns, president of
the private college of 2,500 students founded by Baptists and
supported by the South Carolina Baptist Convention.
   ``I have nothing against Pat Conroy, but with Furman supposedly
being a Christian and a Southern Baptist school, I don't think he
should be receiving an honorary degree,'' said David Satterwhite, a
minister at Roebuck Baptist Church in Spartanburg.
   Johns said the college was honoring Conroy ``as an outstanding
novelist and script writer'' and would not withdraw the invitation.
   Conroy on Friday welcomed the ministers to his speech.
   ``It will probably be a far more interesting speech than the
sermons they give on Sunday,'' he said.

   A judge allowed actor Todd Bridges to remain
free on $25,000 bail pending his trial on an assault charge but
warned he would be sent to jail if he shows up in court under the
influence of drugs.
   ``There were two appearances when I suspected you were under the
influence of narcotics,'' Superior Court Judge Florence Cooper said
Friday. ``But on this and another occasion, you gave the impression
your conduct has improved.''
   On April 9, Bridges told the judge he failed to make a previous
appearance because he was involved in a car accident on his way to
the courthouse.
   Bridges, the former child star of television's ``Diff'rent
Strokes,'' is to go on trial July 30 on a felony assault charge
stemming from the Feb. 2 shooting of an unarmed man in a Los Angeles
house where drugs were on sale.
   Bridges was acquitted of attempted murder and involuntary
manslaughter in the shooting of Kenneth ``Tex'' Clay. Bridges
testified he was too high on cocaine to remember what happened.
   Jurors could not reach a verdict on the charge of assault with a
deadly weapon, and prosecutors refiled that charge.

   Bob Marley's widow, Alfarita, has been sued
for $10 million for allegedly reneging on promises to perform in
Hawaii.
   Anthony Spence, owner of Premiere Productions, filed the lawsuit
Friday in U.S. District Court alleging that the late reggae star's
widow agreed to perform three concerts in Hawaii in the summer of
1988 and also promised Premiere future concert dates with her son,
Ziggy.
   According to the lawsuit, Premiere advanced Mrs. Marley $22,500
and sent her 15 airplane tickets worth $15,126. The day she was
scheduled to arrive in Hawaii, she canceled, saying bronchitis
prevented her from making the trip, the lawsuit says.
   Spence says she returned only $10,000 of the advance and five
tickets.
   A woman who answered the telephone at the number listed for
Marley's home in Kingston, Jamaica, said the performer was out of
the country and could not be reached for comment.
   Spence is asking for all of the money to be returned plus $10
million in damages for breach of contract and fraud.
