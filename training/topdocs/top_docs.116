   WASHINGTON -- The Postal Service is moving to speed up the
use of mail with address bar codes, which enable post offices
to use efficient automated equipment.
   Postmaster General Anthony Frank announced several actions
aimed at encouraging business customers to put bar codes on
letter envelopes, large flat mail pieces and even packages.
The agency also said it will send brochures encouraging
mailers to use complete addresses, with ZIP codes on the line
next to the city and state, to the more than 116 million U.S.
addresses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, the agency awarded two contracts totaling
$27.2 million for modified equipment that will read address
bar codes almost anywhere on the face of envelopes. Automated
bar code sorters currently in use can only read bar codes
printed in the lower right-hand corner.
   The awards include a $14.2 million contract to
Westinghouse Electric Corp., Pittsburgh, and a $13 million
contract to Bell &amp; Howell Co., Skokie, Ill. Each contract is
for modification of 614 bar code sorters that currently are
being built and for changing an additional 694 sorters
already being used by the Postal Service.
   By 1995, the service hopes to have all letters bar coded
with 11 digits, which narrow delivery to the recipient's
address. It hopes to have 40% of all letters coded by
customers, 40% by post offices and 20% by contractors who do
the coding from remote locations, or using other
technologies.
   Mr. Frank said the agency proposes to begin offering rate
incentives for barcoded letters next June, and to extend them
to all of the nation by three months after that. The service
originally had proposed starting the discounts in 1992, then
moved the plan up to September 1991. While the agency has
proposed that first-class mail be charged 30 cents, up from
the current 25 cents, mailers who bar code letters could pay
as little as 24.3 cents under the rate proposal pending
before the Postal Rate Commission.
   The agency will file for a bar-coding rate discount for
flats, possibly more than one cent per piece, next spring,
Mr. Frank said. It has contracted with several vendors to
develop a flats bar code reader. Finally, the Postal Board of
Governors has approved $52 million for a package bar coding
system to process packages, Mr. Frank said.

<LEADPARA>  The U.S. Postal Service has leaped into the era of bar codes, scanners and
automatic sorters, but automation has its price: up to $4 billion in start-up
costs, a continued deficit, put this year at $900 million, and the loss of as
many as 100,000 jobs.;   "Automation is our passport to the future, and in
many respects the future is now," said Anthony M. Frank, the eighth postmaster
general since the service was reorganized in 1971. "In the past three years we
have cemented our commitment to automation; we have developed new technologies
from scratch."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Five-year plan under way; In the mid-1980s, Frank established a five-year
plan, which began in 1990, to automate the Postal Service and increase
efficiency.;   Postal officials say machines are able to sort 10 times faster
than humans, and replacing workers with machines could eventually save money,
perhaps resulting in fewer rate increases. For the workers, the toll is
severe: Officials estimate that 100,000 jobs nationwide will be eliminated by
automation.;   Frank has said he hopes most layoffs can be handled through
attrition, but many analysts say it is unrealistic to expect no layoffs.
Automation comes with built-in costs -- $4 billion to buy equipment such as
bar-code readers, automatic sorters and remote bar-coding equipment.;   Bar
codes are the future; Bar codes, the computer-readable lines on all consumer
products, are the wave of the postal future. Some of the equipment the Postal
Service is buying will read addresses on envelopes and translate them into bar
codes.;   Other machines will read bar codes, sort them and speed mail to its
destination.;   Last year, more than half the letters mailed were handled or
partially handled by machines. This gave the Postal Service a 3.1 percent
increase in productivity.;   Currently, 38 percent of all letter envelopes
carry bar-coded addresses and are sorted by machines. While no legislation is
planned to require bar codes on envelopes, Frank said he hopes rate
incentives, which are yet to be determined, will encourage their use,
especially by businesses.;   By 1995, Frank expects 40 percent of letters will
be bar-coded by customers, many of them businesses, through computer software.
Another 40 percent will be bar-coded by optical scanners in the post offices
and the remaining 20 percent by remote bar-coding systems.;   According to
Frank, labor costs the agency 83 cents of every dollar it spends. In a recent
settlement with the American Postal Workers Union, arbitration increased
workers' wages more than the service wanted for a four-year contract. But
management now has the flexibility in work rules to make the transition to
automation.;   Hiring rules change; They can use more part-time workers and
hire temporary employees from the private sector, while hiring new workers at
10 percent less than the current starting salary.;   William Burrus, the
executive vice president of the American Postal Workers Union, was not pleased
with this development. He called the Postal Service officials "the worst
planners in the world," and said they "don't have any idea how many workers
will be fired as a result of automation.";   Postal officials hope that
attrition and increased volume of mail will prevent layoffs, but there are no
guarantees. Largely because of two recent rate increases, the volume of mail
is lower than they had expected, resulting in a projected deficit of $900
million for this year.  </TEXT>

   Postmaster General Anthony Frank, in a speech to a mailers' convention today, is expected to set a goal of having computer-readable bar codes on all business mail by 1995, holding out discounts and service concessions as incentives. 

   The agency sees widespread use of the codes as a way of handling the rapidly growing mail volume and controlling labor costs. 
Currently, only companies with extremely large mailings apply bar codes themselves and thus help to limit the Postal Service's need for sophisticated machines that "read" typewritten addresses and apply the coding at mail-processing centers. 

   Businesses that apply bar codes to first-class mail currently get a five-cent discount from the regular rate of 25 cents for the first ounce. 
Postal officials said new incentives for businesses will include a range of discounts for all classes of mail, relaxing some sorting rules and improving service. 
Service incentives could mean, for example, guaranteeing shorter delivery times for third-class mail, which is mostly advertising. 
Many of the changes will be subject to approval by the independent Postal Rate Commission. 

   Getting mailers to use the latest technology before giving their mail to the Postal Service "is the only way to achieve the rate stability they want," said Michael Cavanagh, a consultant to major postal customers. 
"Mr. 
Frank will get credit for moving to a logical automation strategy." 

   About 20% of all letter-size mail now carries a bar code, with the Postal Service applying two-thirds of those and businesses applying one-third. 
By next year, the agency expects that 40% of letter mail will have bar codes because several hundred more postal machines that read and apply the code will be in use. 

   If most large mailers begin placing bar codes on their mail, the postal machines, called optical character readers, will be used primarily to handle mail from households and from smaller concerns that aren't likely to apply the codes.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Technology: Bar-codes take on a new dimension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From the talking cash resisters at Cannata's Food World in Louisiana to the
high-speed checkout at Sainsbury in London, bar-code technology has become a
standard feature of modern life.
The ordinary one-dimensional bar-code works by using a laser to scan a
pattern of parallel black and white bars and spaces which carry data along a
single line. The laser scanner reads the information and feeds it into a
computer.
Bar-codes have revolutionised inventory management, merchandise shipping and
parts tracking in industries ranging from general retail to healthcare. They
speed up the sales process and help businesses keep a tighter control on
inventory and data.
Yet the capabilities of today's bar-codes are minuscule when compared with
the possibilities of the two-dimensional bar-code, which holds so much
information that it would allow a cash register to play the William Tell
Overture.
Two-dimen-sional bar-codes are being tested by a number of companies, and
the imminent introduction of a new scanner by Symbol Technologies of
Bohemia, New York, will make them available commercially next month.
The original bar-code was developed by Joseph Woodland, a former IBM
employee and Drexel University researcher. Woodland came up with the idea of
using the rectangular format after seeing the black- and-white patterns of
motion picture sound tracks and the dash-dot-dash pattern of Morse codes.
Woodland and his associates started working on the bar-code in 1948, but it
was not until the 1970s, with the advent of lasers and the drop in computing
costs, that the technology became inexpensive enough to be commercially
viable.
The one-dimensional bar code is practical for processing fairly simple
information. But its usefulness is limited by the fact that only 20-30
characters per inch can be squeezed on to a standard label. Symbol
Technologies has developed a two-dimensional bar-code which can store
roughly 100 times more information in the same space.
The company's PDF417 bar-code works by reading the rows and columns. 'With
one-dimensional codes, the information in the height is redundant,' says Rob
Durst, senior director of PDF business development at Symbol Technologies.
'With two-dimensional codes, there's additional information in the height.'
Other two-dimensional bar-codes work by stacking a large number of
one-dimensional bar-codes on top of each other. A high-speed laser scanner
weaves through the stack until it has covered all the rows.
The PDF417 functions like a portable data file or disposable, paper-based
computer memory. It eliminates time-consuming manual data entry, and with it
an element of human error. In addition, Symbol Technology's two-dimensional
bar-code has an error correction formula to help recover a full message if
part of the code has been torn off.
'We started out inventing a bar-code which developed into a portable data
file, and now we have a full-blown data communications protocol for paper,'
explains Durst.
Symbol Technologies says its two-dimensional bar-codes will greatly increase
the speed of moving and receiving goods, but the possible applications for
the medical and hazardous waste industries are even more substantial.
In the case of hazardous waste, two-dimensional bar-codes could contain
warnings, storage details and disposal instructions, as well as
identification. They could also include emergency instructions, allowing
almost instant clean-up of a toxic waste spill.
For the medical community, doctors in remote regions would be able to get a
patient profile from scanning a bar-code, without needing access to a
central database.
'It's not going to be a revolution you'll notice in 1993,' says David
Nelson, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, 'but conceptually it's clear that
two-dimensional bar-codes will become very common over the next decade and
should nearly supplant one-dimensional bar-codes.'

   United Parcel Service is betting 888
tiny black hexagons will ease the organized chaos of delivering 12
million packages a day.
   The hexagons, printed on a small square label, hold 100 letters
or numbers that a computer can read. That's five times the
information provided by traditional bar codes, which the UPSCODE
hexagons are intended to replace.
   It is the key to a $1.4 billion program to develop a package
delivery system that uses people for little more than the driver
handing the parcel to its recipient, UPS officials said.
   ``Bar codes, in my opinion, are '80s technology, not '90s
technology,'' said Wesley E. Hughes, who led the team that
developed the new system.
   UPS uses bar codes to keep track of the 700,000 packages it
delivers by air every day. But no such computerized system is in
place to follow the ground-transported packages, which make up the
bulk of UPS's business, said Alan Caminiti, a UPS spokesman.
   An employee must be involved in sorting and distributing
packages through every step of the delivery process.
   Thousands of package handlers line up along conveyor belts at
UPS's 150 U.S. sorting hubs. They must pick up each package, read
its address and send it down the appropriate chute, either to be
piled into UPS's familiar brown delivery truck for its final
destination or sent to another hub for further sorting.
   If a ground delivery package is lost, clerks must dig through
files to determine where it entered the UPS system and whether it
got out - a tedious process at best and a lengthy one at worst.
Air-delivered packages are a little easier to trace, as the bar
code labels allow workers to scan a tracking number into a computer
that can perform an electronic search.
   But both systems require people, and UPS faces a shrinking pool
of young and educated workers who can swiftly read and sort
packages. More than 45 percent of the company's 244,000 employees
are part-time package loaders and sorters, many of them college
students, Caminiti said.
   UPS delivered 2.8 billion packages last year and expects that
number to grow steadily in the coming decade. The only way the
company can keep up with that pace, Hughes said, is to develop
automatic sorters, robotics and computerized tracking systems.
   ``Without some type of automation, we literally are concerned
that we'd run out of people to . . . process our packages in the
time frame that we need to get them processed,'' Hughes said.
   UPS researchers developed and patented UPSCODE after they found
bar codes couldn't pack enough information to meet their needs.
UPSCODE's hexagon pattern can be translated into names, addresses,
tracking numbers and any other information.
   As a UPSCODE-imprinted package rolls along a conveyor belts at
slightly more than 5{ mph, a specially made camera finds, reads and
interprets the code in less than a second. Without the label,
packages crawl past human sorters at a tenth of the speed so the
workers can read the labels.
   With UPSCODE and a fully automated sorting system, the conveyor
belts can be revved up to allow 5,000 packages an hour to get
through, rather than the current 2,000 to 3,000, Hughes said.
   UPSCODE will first be used for air-delivered packages next
spring, Caminiti said. Widespread use isn't likely to start until
1992, when UPSCODE will be used to help UPS track every package in
its system, Hughes said.
   Bar coding will soon be used by the U.S. Postal Service to sort,
distribute and trace its daily deluge of 2.3 million packages, said
Peter A. Jacobson, assistant postmaster for engineering.
   He said the Postal Service wouldn't be interested in using a
dense-code system like UPSCODE, because its scanners and readers
would be too costly.
   ``The more exotic the code, the more investment you need to
make,'' Jacobson said.
   UPSCODE could be used in other industries besides packge
delivery, if the company decides to sell it commercially, Hughes
said.
   Warehouses, which need to keep tight inventory control, could
use a system like UPSCODE, he said.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Postal Service board of governors
approved spending $379.3 million Tuesday on new letter sorting
machines.
   The board, meeting in Raleigh, N.C., voted to launch the program
that will lead to bar-coding of all mail by 1995.
   Bar codes are a series of thin lines, similar to those used in
supermarket pricing.
   The money approved Tuesday will cover purchase of 1,349
automatic bar-code reading machines which can sort mail carrying
the codes. It is the first of a three-phase program to make the
coding universal.
   Bar codes already are being used in sorting much business mail,
and the company sending the mail applies the codes in the lower
corner of the letter.
   The new machines will be able to read a code anywhere on the
face of the letter, an advantage which is expected to encourage
more businesses to use the codes.
   Individuals will not be expected to place barcodes on their
mail. However, by the mid-1990s the postal service will begin
placing the codes on letters that do not have them to allow the
material to be sorted by machine.

   Post Office Plans
   To Hire Outsiders
   For Automation

   WASHINGTON -- Over the protest of the American Postal
Workers Union, Postmaster General Anthony Frank will announce
today plans to hire contractors outside the Post Office to
encode a big chunk of the mail for automation.
   While the Postal Service refers to the plan as
"preliminary," Moe Biller, the union president, contended the
plan isn't preliminary, but final. He said the announcement
was sparked by a grievance the union filed against the idea
June 28.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A Postal Service spokesman said there is no connection
between the grievance and the agency's announcement, however.
   Hardware for the remote bar coding system will be supplied
by the winning bidder among three potential suppliers, Postal
Service officials said at a news conference. The companies
are Bell &amp; Howell Co., Skokie, Ill.; TRW Inc., Cleveland; and
AEG Electrocom, Konstanz, West Germany. The service wouldn't
estimate how much the equipment might cost.
   Awards to furnish the equipment will probably be made near
the end of this year, the officials said. Plans are to
install 295 systems at 220 post offices by the end of 1995,
said Peter Jacobson, an assistant postmaster general. The
contractor will do the coding at another location, using an
electronic hookup to the post office. Bids to run the remote
coding operation will probably be solicited in September,
with contract awards in February or March, he said.
   Officials said the contracting out will save the Postal
Service $10 to $12 per work hour, or $4.3 billion over the 10
years the new equipment is expected to function. But Mr.
Frank has insisted that no regular postal worker will lose
his or her job because of the move to contract out the work;
instead, those who sort mail manually or on mechanical
equipment now will be retrained for other jobs, officials
said.
   To which Mr. Biller said, "They're not doing anybody a
favor." Those employees will become surplus, and costly to
retain, while outside contractors take over some of the work,
he argued.
   The Postal Service hopes remote encoding will help the
service fully automate mail processing by 1995. It will be
needed for about 20% of the letters going through the postal
system -- those that lack full, clear addresses that can be
read by the service's optical scanning machines.
   About 80% of the mail will have bar codes, representing
nine-digit address numbers, imprinted by mailing customers or
by bar-code machines at the post office, the Postal Service
hopes. Letters with the codes can be sorted rapidly by
machine.
   Under the new system, letters without customer-printed bar
codes or which optical character readers cannot read and
imprint with bar codes will be shunted aside. Images of the
envelopes will be transmitted to another site, where
operators will read them and put address data into a
computer, which will also provide coding information for the
letter.
   Using that data, machines back at the post office will
print the bar codes on the envelope. Pilot remote coding
operations are planned for post offices in Garden City, N.Y.,
by Bell &amp; Howell, and Louisville, Ky., by TRW, in the next
two months, officials said. The New York coding site is about
a mile from the Garden City post office, and the Louisville
location is about 10 miles away.

   The Postal Service awarded Westing house Electric Corp. a $33 million contract for bar-code sorters. 

   The contract calls for the Pittsburgh company's Westinghouse Electronic Systems Group to produce 211 sorters, to be delivered from September 1990 through October 1991. 
The pact was the first hardware contract awarded to Westinghouse, the agency said. 

   The machines will separate as many as 40,000 letters an hour, sorting them by electronically scanning a bar-code representation of the ZIP code on the face of the envelope. 
Sorters separate mail, previously bar coded by business mailers, into 96 channels, according to ZIP code areas.

<TEXT>
   First-class letters will probably cost 28 to 32
cents to mail in three years and could include an 11-digit zip code
by the turn of the century, says the postmaster general.
   Increased automation and other economies at the U.S. Postal
Service will most likely keep price increases for mailing a letter
below inflation after 1991, Postmaster General Anthony Frank said
Monday.
   Speaking at the opening of a three-day convention of major
Northeastern large-volume mailers, Frank said the actual increase
for a first-class stamp by 1991 might be 5 cents, to a total of 30
cents.
   ``I'll point out that 5 cents is a 20 percent increase in three
years, which is more or less the amount that the costs have gone up
over the last three years,'' Frank said.
   The cost of mailing a first-class letter rose from 22 cents to 25
cents in the spring of 1988. An increase in 1991 would continue the
recent policy of increases every three years.
   Frank said that after running a surplus last fiscal year, the
postal service will be hard pressed to break even in the current
year and faces the greatest deficit in its existence, up to $1.7
billion, in fiscal 1990.
   Automation will cost the postal service $4 billion between now
and 1995 but will save having to hire 100,000 workers, he said.
   New machines exist that can scan nine miles of mail an hour and
can spot a bar code anywhere on the face of an envelope, even one
sandwiched into a cluttered address block or placed amid graphics
and colorful designs.
   Scanners now in use at post offices can pick up a bar code only
on the lower right hand side of an envelope, isolated from the
address block and other print.
   Frank said the postal service wants to have nine-digit bar coding
on all mail by 1995 and will begin testing an 11-digit code.
   With the current nine-digit code, the so-called ZIP plus 4, a
piece of mail is automatically sorted to one or another side of a
specific street in a given locale.
   The 11-digit code would sort a letter down to the building
address, in effect stacking the mail in delivery sequence for a
carrier at the destination.
   Businesses that code their own mail would get substantial postage
discounts, Frank said.

   The Postal Service will experiment with bar
codes on Christmas cards sent by 1,900 Ohio customers to speed up
delivery of the holiday mail.
   The volunteers will share their card mailing lists with the
Postal Service, which will create bar code labels for the envelopes
that can be read by sorting equipment.
   The experiment will involve postal customers in Akron, Canton,
Kent, Ravenna, Wadsworth and Medina.
   Postal officials hope the bar labels will help move holiday mail
faster. Mail with bar labels is sorted by automatic equipment,
rather than by hand.
   The Postal Service expects to use bar codes on 100,000 pieces of
holiday mail this year. The Akron-Canton area alone handles 7
million Christmas cards each season.
   Lou Eberhardt, a spokesman for the Postal Service in Washington,
said concerns over postal customers sharing their private mailing
lists was a concern, but officials decided privacy would not be
jeopardized.

<P>
The U.S. Postal Service will suffer its worst deficit ever next year -- more 
than $1.5 billion -- but Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank plans no cutbacks 
in post office operating hours or delivery schedules. 
</P>
<P>
Frank said he is confident that an ambitious cost-reduction program, heavily 
dependent on automation, can keep the postal system's finances under control 
until the next rate increase, expected in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Operating hours at local post offices were reduced from March until September, 
1988, generating criticism in many communities. But Frank said that he will not 
approve similar measures this year or next despite the fiscal crunch. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to do that, absolutely not," Frank said in an interview this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won't Alter Deliveries 
</P>
<P>
Saturday service also is sacrosanct, according to the postmaster general. 
Reducing deliveries to five days a week "is not a possibility," Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
"We handle 530 million pieces of mail a day," he said. "If we cut out Saturday, 
we would have to handle a billion on Monday, and we just couldn't do it. We 
couldn't deliver them, handle them and store them." 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service is in the final year of its traditional three-year rate 
cycle. It will apply next year to the independent Postal Rate Commission for an 
overall increase, probably between 15% and 20%. The commission, after lengthy 
hearings, will decide on the allocation of higher rates among different types 
of mail. New rates will take effect in the first quarter of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The price of a first-class stamp, now 25 cents, would rise to 30 cents if the 
rate commission decides on a 20% increase. 
</P>
<P>
Losses are mounting as the Postal Service reaches the end of the three-year 
cycle because labor cost increases and inflation are exceeding the revenue 
increases produced by the last rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
The system should break even for fiscal 1989, which ends Sept. 30. But fiscal 
1990 will produce losses of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, the biggest deficit 
since the Postal Service became an independent agency in 1971. The largest 
previous loss was $802 million in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The key to Frank's plans for controlling Postal Service costs is increased use 
of automation. 
</P>
<P>
An extensive automation plan "is more crucial to the Postal Service than 
anything else," Frank said. "We want to have a program that fully automates the 
mail stream." 
</P>
<P>
A vital element is the use of bar codes, the computerized horizontal stripes 
printed on some envelopes. They help reduce the number of people handling each 
piece of mail. 
</P>
<P>
Bar code information goes far beyond zip codes. For example, bar codes can 
direct a letter to a specific floor in a big building or to one side of a block 
on a residential street. That means fewer hours spent sorting and bundling 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
About 40% of all letters carry bar codes now, up from 7% at the start of last 
year. Frank hopes to encourage businesses to increase the figure to 60% by the 
end of next year, and he will make a pitch for automation in his speech Monday 
to a conference of major mailers. 
</P>
<P>
The inducement will be financial. He said he hopes to raise the discount given 
to businesses that use bar codes. 
</P>
<P>
The postal service has just developed a machine able to read bar codes through 
the clear address windows on business envelopes. When the machines are in 
common use, businesses will be able to print bar codes on letters instead of 
placing them on envelopes, which is more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Increased reliance on automation, combined with a $200-million reduction in 
spending by headquarters and elimination of 1,000 management jobs through the 
system by attrition, should enable the Postal Service to handle its budget 
crunch next year, Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
The deficit for 1990 will be driven by cost-of-living increases and regular 
wage increases under labor contracts as well as by a surge in workmen's 
compensation claims. The cost of benefits for the Postal Service's 
800,000-member work force also is rising rapidly, with health insurance 
payments increasing at an unsustainable rate of 30% a year, Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
Total hours worked throughout the system will be reduced for 1990, with fewer 
part-time employees hired and less overtime for regular workers. In addition, 
some 8,000 jobs won't be filled as vacancies occur, Frank said. Normal 
attrition is 60,000 people a year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Difficult Undertaking' 
</P>
<P>
"We will operate in the field with fewer hours next year than we did this 
year," Frank said. "That is a very difficult undertaking because our volume is 
going up." 
</P>
<P>
Each year, the system must accommodate an additional 1.5 million to 1.8 million 
addresses of new homes and new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Various marketing innovations are being implemented, including the sale of 
stamps on an experimental basis through automated teller machines at banks in 
Seattle. The experiment will be tested at banks in Santa Ana later this year.

   U.S. Postal Service
   Expects to Trim
   47,000 Jobs by '95

   WASHINGTON -- The Postal Service expects to trim 47,000
more jobs from its work force by late 1995 as it steps up
automated processing, Postmaster General Anthony Frank said.
   Mr. Frank said such labor-cost savings would help postpone
further rate increases. He said that if the agency is allowed
to put a 30-cent rate into effect for the first ounce of
first-class letters, it hopes to have just one more rate
boost -- in 1995 -- by the end of the 1990s.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last year, the service asked to lift the first-class rate
to 30 cents from 25 cents, but the independent Postal Rate
Commission held the rise to 29 cents. The commission also
widened the rate increase for third-class mail 25% from the
17% the service sought.
   The service has asked the commission to reconsider the
case. Postal officials complain that both the smaller
first-class rise and damped advertising-mail volume caused by
the recession and the large third-class increase have hurt
postal revenue. In addition, Congress has forced the agency
to shoulder $4.9 billion more in postal retiree costs, Mr.
Frank said.
   If the commission continues to stick by the 29-cent
first-class rate, the Postal Service board of governors
could, on a unanimous vote, put the 30-cent rate into effect
on its own.
   The 47,000 jobs expected to be trimmed by 1995 would be on
top of 37,000 jobs already eliminated since the agency's
record employment of 787,000 in May 1989, Mr. Frank said. He
added that he hoped the reductions could continue to be made
through attrition, without actual layoffs.
   Mr. Frank said that letter carriers increasingly will feel
the effects of automation that so far have been experienced
mostly by processing clerks. The agency is moving to extend
automation to final sorting of mail for delivery routes. He
said it will take letter carriers substantially less time to
sort mail at the post office and give them more time for
delivery.
   By the end of 1992, about 61% of all cards and letters
handled by the Postal Service will carry bar codes that
signify destinations. The agency's goal is to have all cards
and letters bar-coded by 1995, Mr. Frank said. New automated
equipment reads the bar codes and speedily sorts the mail.

<TEXT>
   Postal executives this week will be introduced
to a new breed of postal clerk that may never smile, but which also
never frowns or gets cranky or takes a break when there's a line
waiting.
   It's the new face of postal technology _ automated postal clerks
_ and they will begin ``greeting'' the American public later this
summer.
   The clerks, Infopost and Autopost, will be on display at the
U.S. Postal Service's Third Advanced Technology Conference in
Washington this week.
   Infopost, which answers customer questions, already is whirring
away in test form. It will be deployed to post offices in the
Washington area this summer to see how it does in real-life
meetings with the public.
   Autopost, which weighs mail, takes money, makes change and sells
postage, is still being built, although a wooden mockup will be on
display. Field tests of a working model are expected in the fall.
   These are but two of the developments that will be under
discussion at the three-day international conference, where
technical managers will exchange ideas about speeding mail movement.
   Improved mail-handling technology is critical to speeding up
movement of the increasing volume of mail while holding down costs,
explained Kenneth Hunter, senior assistant postmaster general for
management information and research technology.
   Postal officials say the agency needs automation to avoid being
swamped by the 250 billion pieces of mail expected by the year 2000.
   Other developments described by U.S. postal officials at a
preconference briefing last week included machines that can arrange
letters and parcels so the addresses all face the same way, read
ZIP codes and handle a variety of other tasks.
   Teaching machines to read handwriting, for example, is something
technicians have struggled with in hopes of developing equipment to
find and read ZIP codes and then print a bar code on the letter _
like those black lines used on supermarket items.
   With the bar code, already widely used by business mailers,
letters can be sorted more quickly.
   Other items under discussion will include laser equipment to
help sort mail, automatic truck loading equipment and robots to
move mail containers and do other jobs.
   On hand to see the American work and discuss developments in
their own nations will be officials from 16 foreign countries,
including Australia, Canada, West Germany, Britain, Japan, the
Soviet Union, Switzerland and Uruguay.
   While these executives may long for high-speed mail sorters and
cargo handlers, the public face of technology will be embodied in
Infopost and Autopost. People accustomed to automatic banking
machines will likely find the new machinery familiar.
   Infopost offers information on a television-type screen which
the customer touches to enter questions. It can respond either with
an answer or with more questions.
   Asked about rates for overseas mail, for example, the machine
can ask the weight of the item, tell what types of things are
allowed to be mailed to the country in question, and give the rates
and expected delivery time for various mail. It also will print the
information on a slip of paper if asked.
   While Infopost deals with just information, Autopost _ also
using an interactive television screen _ is a mailing station.
   It contains a scale which weighs the item to be mailed and asks
for the destination ZIP code. With that information it outlines
mailing options _ first class, priority mail, Express Mail or
parcel post, for example _ and tells the cost of each option and
how long it is expected to take for delivery.
   The customer can then feed coins, bills or a bank cash card into
the machine, and it will make change and issue a postage-meter-like
strip to be stuck on the letter or parcel. It will also give a
receipt, if asked.
   The item to be mailed can then be dropped into a mailbox.
   While Infopost and Autopost are planned for tryouts in lobbies
of post offices, eventually they could be extended to shopping
malls, supermarkets and other locations, according to postal
managers.
   Each will be connected to a central commuter, which will monitor
the supply of postage and change, and call for a technician if
problems develop. The computer will sound an alert if someone tries
to break into the machines.
   The machines should be able to handle an estimated 68 percent of
post office customer business, the Postal Service estimates,
freeing clerks for more complex transactions.

eliminate 47,000 jobs by 1995 through an ambitious automation program, but he

<HEADLINE>  POSTAL SERVICE TO CUT 47,000 JOBS
NEW MACHINES WILL SORT MAIL FASTER  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "The biggest automation program in history" will be virtually completed by
1995, when almost all mail will be processed with a computerized bar code
marked on the envelope for rapid sorting and easy delivery," Frank said.;  
The Postal Service has eliminated 37,000 jobs in the past two years through a
hiring freeze, and Frank had indicated in private meetings with union
officials that the organization sought further reductions.;   But Thursday's
announcement was the first public disclosure that the Postal Service planned
to wipe out 47,000 more jobs. The new cutbacks, which will reduce the agency's
payroll to 703,000, will have a direct impact on mail carriers for the first
time.;   These workers now spend about four hours in the office sorting mail
and four hours on the streets delivering it. Automation will cut the time in
the office to two hours. The carriers, with six hours on the street, will be
expected to cover longer routes.;   The automation program should not affect
most individuals sending personal letters and cards. There will be no change
in the current five-digit zip code for addresses.;   The Postal Service is
developing machinery that can read handwriting and hopes to have the device
available by 1995. It would scan the handwritten address at the post office,
and then spray on the envelope a bar code -- a series of vertical lines --
translating the address into computerized language for rapid sorting and easy
delivery.;   The job cutbacks will save the Postal Service $4.5 billion a year
in salary and benefits by 1995, Frank said. The savings should keep postage
costs stable, he predicted.;   The current 29-cent rate for a first-class
letter, in effect since February, was adopted by the independent Postal Rate
Commission over the protests of the Postal Service, which had asked for 30
cents. Frank appealed the decision to the commission, but was turned down
once. He is now awaiting the result of a second appeal. If he is turned down
again by the commission, the Postal Service's own board of governors could
adopt the 30-cent rate by a unanimous vote.  </TEXT>

   The new rates proposed by the board of
governors of the U.S. Postal Service would mean higher mail costs
for most individuals and businesses.
   Here are some examples of the changes when the new rates take
effect, probably sometime in early 1991:
   _Individual cost of mailing a letter or paying a bill: 30 cents,
up from 25 cents.
   _Cost to mail a regular post card: 20 cents, up from 15 cents.
   _Price of sending a seven-pound package: $5.06, up from $4.00.
   _Charge to a bank to send a three-ounce statement: 76 cents, up
from 65 cents.
   _Department store cost to mail a pre-sorted bill: 26 cents, up
from 21 cents.
   _Price to send a credit-card bill, sorted according to the full
nine-digit ZIP code: 25.3 cents, up from 20.5 cents.
   _Utility company cost to send a bill with imprinted bar code,
allowing it to be handled by machines: 24.3 cents, up from 20 cents.
   _Lawyer's cost to send one-pound of legal documents by priority
mail: $2.75, up from $2.40.
   _Charge to send eight ounces of high-speed business information
via Express Mail: $9.75, up from $8.75.
   _Cost for two-pounds of urgent business materials via Express
Mail: $13.75, up from $12.00.
   _Postage for a typical weekly newsmagazine: 16 cents, up from
13.5 cents.
   _Cost of sending a somewhat heavier monthly magazine: 37.4
cents, up from 29.7 cents.
   _Postage for two ounces of advertising, with special bar code
imprinted to permit handling by new automated machinery: 16.1
cents, down from 16.7 cents.
   _Rate for half-pound catalog, sorted according to ZIP code: 33.1
cents, up from 27.1 cents.
   _Charge for advertising mail, sorted in advance according to the
sequence of houses that the letter carrier visits: 9.6 cents, down
from 10.1 cents.
   _Cost of sending a local three-pound business package: $2.00, up
from $1.58.
   _Book club cost to mail a four-pound package: $2,26, up from
$1.95.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Double the dose in a bar code
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Bar codes are widely used on items such as food to identify the item. But in
blood transfusion, where large amounts of data need to be carried on the
blood bag, more complex options are being investigated.
The regional transfusion centres in Oxford, UK, and Kassel, Germany, are
looking at a two-dimensional bar code called PDF 417 to identify the donor,
reveal test data and so on. Unlike traditional bar codes where data is held
in the thickness of the stripes and the height of the bar is irrelevant,
PDF417, developed by Symbol Technologies, of Bohemia, New York, and promoted
in the UK by Bar Code Systems, contains a series of codes stacked on top of
each other.
As a result a single code can contain up to 1,750 characters, compared with
13 on a traditional bar code. Symbol Technologies: US, 516 563 2400. Bar
Code Systems: UK, 081 549 0909.

<HEADLINE>  CIVIL DEMAND LAW COMES INTO PLAY  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Action Line  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  A  The California Civil Demand Law, Section 490.5 of the state Penal Code,
allows a merchant "injured" by such petty theft to recover the retail value of
the merchandise plus $50 to $500 in damages from an adult shoplifter or a
juvenile's parent or legal guardian in civil court. Many retailers make such a
demand hoping they won't have to resort to court action.; BAR CODES ON
ENVELOPES; Q  On many return envelopes that businesses use (including the
Mercury News), there are two sets of what appear to be bar codes. One is in
the middle top portion of the envelope and has longer lines. The other has
shorter lines and appears on the bottom nearer the right side. Are they bar
codes?;    -- Donna Araiza, Cupertino; A  They are. John Di Peri, manager of
technical sales and services for the United States Postal Service, says the
longer lines on the top of the envelope are the Facing Identification Mark, or
FIM. This code directs different types of business and courtesy reply mail to
appropriate automated equipment so the mail can be processed, says Di Peri.
The code on the bottom is called a "POSTNET" bar code. It represents the ZIP
code on the address so the automated equipment can sort the mail faster.;
SHADES OF ENLIGHTENMENT; Q  I have been told by various people that turning on
a fluorescent light uses as much power as leaving it on for one hour; or
leaving it on for 30 minutes; or leaving it on for 10 minutes. I wrote to
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric to see which is correct. The reply I received stated
that older fluorescent lights used a lot of power when being turned on, but
the newer ones don't, so one should turn the newer ones off if leaving a room
for just a few minutes. The same day I received this response, I saw an
article on energy conservation that said to leave fluorescent lights on unless
you're going to be gone for 30 minutes. OK, what's the correct answer?;    --
C. Gabriel, Cupertino; A  Turning a fluorescent light on uses about as much
energy as leaving that light on for three minutes, says Mary Ellen Ittner,
PG&amp;E spokeswoman. She says this information is based on research conducted at
the University of California, Berkeley's Lawrence Hall of Science. Ittner says

   Parallel Computing
   Finds Mainstream Uses

   PARALLEL-DESIGN supercomputers, once reserved for esoteric
research applications, are being put to more commercial uses.
   At Prudential Securities, a powerful parallel
supercomputer gives quick risk analysis for mortgage-backed
securities, while clients are on the line. Previously, the
analysis took several minutes on conventional computers --
too long to keep clients on the phone, and long enough for
market prices to change, sometimes rendering the analysis
obsolete.
   Now, with parallel machines -- which use dozens, or even
hundreds, of processors working on different aspects of a
problem at the same time -- customers get answers in as
little as 30 seconds. Parallel processors, which can range
from $300,000 to $3 million, offer supercomputer power at far
less cost. They provide a clear strategic advantage over
traditional systems, says David Audley, research director for
Prudential's financial strategies group, which has used an
Intel parallel machine for about a year.
   Indeed, with increasingly arcane derivative securities
requiring time-sensitive computations, supercomputer-class
horsepower may become a cost of doing business for
financial-services companies, says George Lindamood, a
consultant with market researcher Gartner Group.
   Other emerging markets include credit-card companies and
retailers. American Express just bought two Thinking Machines
computers for its travel-services operation, while Kmart is
using a Teradata parallel computer to coax new sales
strategies from the mountain of transaction information
collected by all of its stores each day.
   Kmart had long noted that some stores sold lots of
confetti around Easter. The parallel machine analyzed sales
data and other information for every store and pinpointed the
reason: Confetti sells best in or near Hispanic
neighborhoods, where it is used in traditional holiday
celebrations.
                                                                                                       

   U.S. Bobsled Drivers
   Take Simulated Ride
                                                                                                       

   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., a sunny Silicon Valley city, might
not seem the best place for the U.S. Olympic bobsled team to
train. But the team's drivers will be there today to practice
on a computer simulation of the Olympic bobsled run in La
Plagne, France, for next month's games.
   With the margin of victory in this high-speed event
measured in hundredths of seconds, familiarity with the run
could give the U.S. team an edge. So every twist and turn of
the mile-long course has been recreated on a computer
simulator by researchers at the University of California at
Davis working with Silicon Graphics of Mountain View.
   Team members will pilot an actual bobsled whose steering
control is connected to a powerful computer, which projects a
lifesized, three-dimensional simulation of the course on a
screen in front of the sled. Every tug at the steering is
instantly reflected in the simulation, which projects the
sled's flight down the icy track by calculating aerodynamics,
gravity, friction, steering and weight 30 times a second. The
run takes about a minute to complete.
   "You can see your mistakes without crashing," says Randy
Will, a driver on the U.S. team who took a trial run Friday.
"We were skeptical at first, but the visual aspect is very
real. All that's missing is the cold."
                                                                                                       

   Vanishing Ink Stymies
   Invisible Bar Codes
                                                                                                       

   INVISIBLE bar-code technology might already be on the
market, but for the problem of disappearing ink.
   Researchers at Battelle Memorial Institute developed the
new bar-code technology for the U.S. Postal Service -- which
uses bar codes to automate letter-sorting -- and licensed it
last year to AccuSort Systems, a bar-code equipment company
in Telford, Pa. Accu-Sort envisions all kinds of potential
uses, including on cash, ID cards and passports to prevent
counterfeiting. In law enforcement, detectives could use the
invisible bar codes on cash to track the flow of money
following an illegal transaction.
   The problem is the invisible ink, which after a few weeks
becomes invisible even to the infrared photocell designed to
read it, an Accu-Sort researcher says. "There are still some
technical hurdles, but we expect to get it worked out soon,"
says Michael Hrabina of Accu-Sort.
                                                                                                       

   Tiny Electronics Help
   Give Life to Microrobots
                                                                                                       

   SILICON "ants" might one day sweep up radioactive dust
from hard-to-reach laboratory corners, purge diseased cells
from blood or even be used by spies to bug a room.
   Such microrobots are becoming feasible with advanced
materials and microscopic electronics. For his ant, inventor
Johannes G. Smits of Boston University has devised
micromotors three millimeters long and the width of a human
hair to drive the tiny machine's legs and pincer. The motors
work without gears: Chromium-gold electrodes under varying
electric charges cause zinc oxide coatings on tiny silicon
rods to expand and contract, in turn making the rods move.
   The ant would walk as its electrically charged silicon
legs flex up and down, and its pincer would work the same
way. The device, still under development, would be powered by
a solar cell and controlled by a microprocessor brain
responding to acoustic signals.
   Prof. Smits, who recently received a patent for the ant
design, says other micromotor designs usually depend on tiny
gears turning in response to rapidly changing electrical
fields. But such moving parts can get clogged with dust and
are more likely to break down, he says.

   BETHESDA, Md. -- Martin Marietta Corp. received a $19.9
million contract from the U.S. Postal Service to provide new
bar code readers. The 23-month contract for 812 reading
systems calls for first deliveries in 20 weeks and includes
an option for 300 additional systems.
   The equipment will be capable of reading postal bar codes
anywhere on the surface of large, flat items, such as
oversized envelopes and magazines, the aerospace and
technology company said. Current equipment only reads bar
codes on the front of standard-sized letters.

   Cost of Mailing First-Class Letter Likely
   To Climb to 29 Cents Early Next Month

   WASHINGTON -- Mailing a first-class letter likely will
cost 29 cents starting early next month, but it probably will
cost only 27 cents to mail some bill payments.
   Postmaster General Anthony Frank said a new two-level,
first-class rate scheme recommended by the Postal Rate
Commission is acceptable to the Postal Service. Although the
agency had proposed boosting the rate to 30 cents from its
current 25 cents, he expressed "relative satisfaction" with
the commission's recommendations and said the postal Board of
Governors probably will accept them when it votes later this
month. If so, the new rates will go into effect Feb. 3.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The commission's rate schedule would bring in to the
postal service an estimated $6.2 billion in additional
revenues a year, only about $100 million below the amount
sought by the service.
   The recommended new approach would set a 29-cent
first-class rate. But it would let people pay only 27 cents
to mail bill payments using return envelopes with bar codes
provided by many firms. The bar codes enable post offices to
use automated equipment for more efficient processing.
   Mr. Frank did say, however, that it will take "quite a bit
more thinking" to put the two-tier plan into effect.
   The proposed new charges are part of a package of
recommendations disclosed over the weekend by the commission.
While recommending that the increase in the first-class rate
be held to 16%, the commission urged a 25% increase in the
rate for third-class bulk mail sent by advertisers. The
service had proposed a 17% increase.
   By the commission's calculations, the Postal Service's
rate proposal would boost revenue from first-class mail to
135% of the cost of handling it from 120%, while trimming
revenue from third-class mail to 79% of its costs from 84%.
By contrast, the commission said its plan would lift the
first-class burden to 124% of a fair share of costs and the
third-class portion to 93%.
   A postal users group formed last year by consumer advocate
Ralph Nader applauded the commission's emphasis on reducing
the relative burden on first-class mailers. But the group
said the commission should have frozen all rates at current
levels to "squeeze" the postal agency to become more
efficient. The American Bankers Association said the
commission's rollback of the Postal Service proposal was "a
wonderful victory."
   Third-class mailers, for their part, were even more
unhappy with the commission recommendations than they were
with the Postal Service's proposed rate rises. Gene Del
Polito, executive director of the Third Class Mail
Association, called the new recommendations "a disaster" and
the product of "political ratemaking." The Direct Marketing
Association, another mailer group, said businesses will be
"seriously hurt" by the recommended third-class rate
increases.
   The commission endorsed the postal agency's plan to give
deeper discounts for volume mailers when they pre-sort or
barcode their letters, including use of the four extra digits
in addition to the five-digit ZIP codes for more precise
distribution for delivery. But the commission modified the
service's proposed schedule of discounts.
   The postal Board of Governors has little practical
alternative to accepting the recommendations, though it could
try to rebuff them.
   To be sure, the board could reject them and send them back
to the commission for further review, or the board could let
them go into effect under protest and still return them for a
second review. But in either case, the board could only spurn
the commission's ultimate recommendations and put its own
plan into effect by a unanimous vote of its five board
members -- and only on the ground that the commission plan
wouldn't provide adequate revenue.
   By law, the Postal Service must break even over a period
of years. George Haley, the postal commission's chairman,
said Congress has saddled the postal agency with new budget
burdens since its rate filing in March 1990, and he noted a
worsening forecast for the impact of the economy on postal
revenue. But "significantly better" Postal Service financial
performance, which the agency has ascribed to a reduced work
force and more automation, slightly outweighs the negative
factors, he said.

  [Text] Beijing, June 28 (XINHUA) -- The Beijing Legend 
Computer Group and the U.S. Intermec Corporation, a world leader 
in automated data collection technology, signed an agreement 
here today to jointly develop bar code technology and market it 
in China. 
  The Legend Group is to be responsible for distributing 
Intermec's automated data collection technology and products in 
China. It will also help train personnel for the new 
technology, according to the agreement. 
  Official sources said that more than 75 percent of the 500 
enterprises listed in "FORTUNE" magazine are users of Intermec 
products, which include data collection hardware, software, 
label supplies and services. 
  Speaking at the signing, the Vice-President of the Beijing 
Legend Group, Liu Jinduo, said that his company plays a vital 
role in the domestic micro computers market as well as in 
developing Chinese character processing software. 
  "Our cooperation with Intermec has brought us to the new 
high- tech domain of bar code data collection technology," he 
said. 
  Intermec President Timothy A. Koogle said that his company 
is 
willing to be a firm backer for its Chinese partner. 
  "What is in our mind is to modernize China's manufacturing 
and distributing industries as soon as can be desired and, 
moreover, help China get in line with international practices in 
the circulation area," he said. 
  Bar codes, a new information technology started in the U.S. 
in the 1970s, has been broadly used in computer systems for 
industrial production, commerce, postal service, the management 
of blood banks, libraries, storing, communications and the 
management of commercial bills. 
  Bar code technology was introduced into China in the 1980s. 
By the end of l992, more than 3,000 enterprises applied for bar 
codes and over 40,000 commodities now carry the marks. 
  According to official forecasts, about 8,000 enterprises 
more 
are expected to have bar codes of their own this year and a 
further 100,000 commodities will join the ranks of the code 
carriers.

THOSE MYSTERIOUS STRIPES MAY STUMP CONSUMERS, BUT THEY LAY IT ALL OUT IN BLACK

Safeway Stores figured out a few years ago that shoppers bought more candy bars 
when they were stocked at front-end checkstands than when placed only on racks 
in the middle of stores. So the Oakland-based chain started stocking the sweets 
up front. 
</P>
<P>
Ralphs Grocery recently found in a store-by-store analysis that sales of fresh 
pasta had "really exploded" in certain of its locations, according to Al 
Marasca, executive vice president of the Compton firm. That enabled the company 
to expand the space for that product only in those stores where demand was 
greatest. 
</P>
<P>
What led to these changes were bar codes, those ubiquitous black and white 
stripes on products from peanut butter to kitty litter. To shoppers, the codes 
are best known for being pulled by a cashier across a window-like device in the 
checkout stand, which somehow translates them into a price that flashes onto a 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
But bar codes also have a secret life -- as speedy providers of facts and 
figures about what people buy and why. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to streamlining the checkout process and saving grocers the cost of 
tagging many items, bar codes are being used increasingly to help manufacturers 
and retailers make smarter decisions about which products to sell and how to 
market them. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers depend on the data to find out how well their products are moving 
and what promotions work best to stimulate sales. At Ralston Purina Co. in St. 
Louis, maker of Chex cereal, Wonder Bread, dog food and other products, bar 
code data is "relied upon in different degrees in our different divisions, but 
all of them do use it," said spokesman Patrick Farrell. 
</P>
<P>
The technology, which uses laser beams to scan bar codes, is worthy of "Star 
Wars." Scanning was pioneered in the early 1970s by Kroger, the big 
Cincinnati-based grocery company. Now, according to industry figures, nearly 
17,000 of the nation's 30,000 supermarkets (not including small mom-and-pop 
stores) have laser scanning equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how the process works: 
</P>
<P>
Before any information about a product can be collected, a supermarket company 
makes an entry in a host computer at headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The file usually contains a 10-digit number represented by the bar code plus 
the current price. The first five digits stand for the manufacturer, whose 
number is assigned by the Uniform Code Council in Dayton, Ohio. The council, 
which maintains a database of about 60,000 companies from 77 different 
countries, also determines the specifications for each bar code, including the 
width of stripes and the contrast between the bars and the background. 
</P>
<P>
The next five digits, assigned by each manufacturer, signify the product, with 
variations by flavor, size or weight. A 16-ounce box of Rice Krispies, for 
example, would have a slightly different code from a 24-ounce package. And an 
8-ounce container of strawberry-flavored Dannon yogurt would have a different 
number from an 8-ounce container of blueberry. 
</P>
<P>
Back at the checkout stand, a cashier passes the bar code across a window 
embedded in the counter that covers the inner workings of the laser scanner. 
The scanner can read the code in the proper order, even if the item is upside 
down. If the scanner recognizes the code as one contained in the store's 
computer, it sounds a beep and flashes a brief product description and the 
price on a screen. It also tallies another sale in that store for that product. 
</P>
<P>
Although stores could analyze the data on a daily basis, "most don't have the 
time," noted Jerry Morton, who runs Store Systems Consulting in Lawrence, Kan., 
and advises supermarkets about scanning equipment. 
</P>
<P>
More commonly, the headquarters computer retrieves information on a weekly 
basis from each store, and then the chain sells the data to services that 
analyze it for manufacturers. Some large chains get as much as $1 million a 
year just for selling the data, according to Tony MacNeary, vice president of 
retailer client services for one such company, Information Resources Inc. 
</P>
<P>
IRI and A. C. Nielsen Co., both based in Chicago, use the vast stores of data 
to track the success or failure of products and promotions. By tracking data 
from a representative sample of stores, these companies can analyze how an 
individual item (say, Diet Pepsi) or company (PepsiCo) is faring during a 
certain period or in a given region. They can also determine whether sales of 
bean dip go up if a supermarket puts taco chips on sale. 
</P>
<P>
"For the retailer or manufacturer, we can see whether it's worth more to run a 
feature ad in a newspaper or a huge display in a store," MacNeary said. 
"Combining them might be even more effective." 
</P>
<P>
As part of its service, Nielsen analyzes a wealth of data from 15,000 U.S. 
households. Using special hand-held scanning equipment at home, participating 
residents scan the groceries and other products they have bought. They note 
such factors as whether the price was marked down or whether they used a 
coupon. Nielsen also takes into account what magazines and newspapers these 
people read to find out what ads they may have seen. Participants are rewarded 
with gifts and trips. 
</P>
<P>
Although manufacturers have started putting such data to good use, retailers 
have yet to tap the full potential of scanner information, many observers say. 
Instead of using scanner data and computers to develop automated reordering of 
products, an estimated 98% of the nation's groceries still use manual methods. 
Usually, store personnel must walk the aisles with hand-held scanners that read 
bar code tags on the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is getting more than 10% of value out of the data," said W. Frank Dell, 
vice president in the New York office of Cresap, a Towers Perrin company that 
consults for food and consumer products companies. 
</P>
<P>
Safeway Stores is an exception. In May, 1983, the big chain hired a 
developmental psychologist named Louise H. Booth to head an in-house marketing 
research organization. Her team collects and analyzes scanner data for other 
retailers and for manufacturers, such as Procter &amp; Gamble, Ralston Purina 
and PepsiCo. 
</P>
<P>
"We not only earn some money by doing research," said Booth, manager of Safeway 
Scanner Marketing Research Services. "We learn the answers to questions (our 
clients are) asking." Safeway also analyzes its own data, looking for ways to 
boost sales, as it did with candy bars. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with scanner data, manufacturers can get influential retailers such as 
Safeway on their side by proving that shelf space for their products can mean 
added profit all around. 
</P>
<P>
Take kiwis. In 1984, the New Zealand Kiwifruit Authority went to Safeway to 
learn how best to market the exotic fruit to U.S. customers. In a series of 
tests, Safeway showed that added display in the produce area plus special 
advertising and a reduced price could boost weekly kiwi sales to more than 450 
per store from 25. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so useful that we're thinking of updating it in the next year or two," 
said Hillary A. Brick, with the kiwi marketing board in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
(To be sure, kiwis and other fruits and vegetables don't have bar codes affixed 
to them. To ring up produce purchases, cashiers punch in a two-digit code that 
prompts the computer to look up the price for that item. The data is then 
analyzed in the same way as other bar code information.) 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, as the system becomes even more sophisticated, Booth expects 
Safeway's service to help manufacturers target customers more effectively. 
"P&amp;G might want to send a coupon to people who buy disposable diapers, in 
particular people who buy the other brand, or to anybody who buys baby food," 
she said. "This is a way for P&amp;G to get a mailing list based on the 
purchase behavior of a household."

   The Postal Service will seek rate increases that would average 16% for all classes of mail and boost the cost of postage for a first-class letter to 25 cents for the first ounce, officials said. 

   If approved, the increase would take effect in about a year, and postal officials hope to maintain the new rates for about three years. 

   The chairman of the Postal Service Board of Governors, John Griesemer, said the rising cost of postal operations, labor and retirement benefits will require higher rates by mid-1988. 
Under the law, the proposed increase must be reviewed by the independent Postal Rate Commission. 
The commission's lengthy hearing process and further deliberation by the board usually take at least a year. 

   Postal officials estimated that the increase would cost the average consumer less than 20 cents a week, or less than $10 a year. 
The most recent rate increase, raising a first-class stamp to 22 cents, took effect in February 1985. 

   Along with the rate increases, the Postal Service proposes changes in its rate structure that would create a new discount for first-class business mail that is partially sorted by customers using computerized bar-codes. 
And the agency will ask for new services and a less costly rate structure for its overnight Express Mail Service. 

   The rate-increase request comes two weeks after the Postal Service and its unions began negotiations on a three-year contract. 
Postal officials yesterday wouldn't disclose what kind of wage settlement they assumed in preparing the rate-increase request. 

   "This decision is a financial decision, and it won't affect labor negotiations," said Deputy Postmaster General Michael Coughlin. 
He said that while the agency's estimate of its labor costs could, like any other estimate, be off base, the board can delay enactment of a rate increase if it decides the extra revenue isn't needed. 

   Leaders of the two major postal unions, however, attacked the board's decision to seek a specific rate increase at this time as a sign that the Postal Service doesn't intend to bargain in good faith. 

   Moe Biller, president of the American Postal Workers Union, and Vincent Sombrotto, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, said the action is an effort to pressure union leaders and lead the public to believe that labor costs are causing postal rate increases. 

   Postmaster General Preston Tisch and other officials maintain that several factors, such as increased costs resulting from a new federal retirement system, make a rate increase inevitable. 
Mr. Tisch has recused himself from discussions on setting rates for the various mail classifications because the CBS Records division of CBS Inc., in which he has an interest, is a large business mailer. 

   Officials said they will formally file their rate request with the Postal Rate Commission this week. 
Under the proposal, the rate for first-class business mail that customers partially sort by applying computerized bar-codes -- a new classification -- will be 20.2 cents an ounce. 
And for mail on which business customers use the nine-digit ZIP code, the rate would rise to 23 cents from the current 21.1 cents. 

   Rates for Express Mail would drop to a range of $7.75 to $70, from the current range of $8.35 to $104.95. 
Officials will also seek to offer volume discounts on Express Mail, an improved pick-up service and a reduced rate for parcels weighing eight ounces or less. 

   The minimum charge for single pieces of third-class advertising mail would increase to 16.5 cents from 12.5 cents. 
The second-class rate, which applies to magazines and newspapers, would increase to 10 cents a pound, from 9.1 cents, for material mailed within the county of publication. 
Second-class rates for materials mailed outside the county of publication would drop to a minimum of 10.3 cents a pound from 11.8 cents currently.

   Enterprise:
   U.S. ZIP-Code Conversions Zap Postal-Service Firms

   Rivals Give Stamp of Disapproval to
   Government's Free Nine-Digit Lists

   Small postal-service companies are accusing the U.S.
Postal Service of taking the zip out of their ZIP-code
business.
   Among other services, these companies update business
mailing lists by converting five-digit ZIP codes to newer
nine-digit numbers. The companies complain that the Postal
Service is stealing their customers by offering to do the
conversions free.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's got an entire industry outraged," says Gene Del
Polito, executive director of the Third Class Mail
Association of Washington, D.C. The Postal Service has
started aggressively marketing the conversion service in the
last several months.
   The several hundred private postal-service companies and
letter shops complain that the gargantuan Postal Service, the
nation's largest civilian employer, is beating up on small
business. Many of the companies have invested heavily in
computers and software to perform the very mailing-list
updates that the government's postal agency is now offering
at no cost.
   The private firms charge anywhere from $2 to $6 per
thousand names for providing "ZIP-plus-four" codes, which
qualify bulk mailers for postage discounts and are supposed
to speed delivery. The customer provides computer disks of
ZIP-coded addresses, which the service company runs through a
computer program that adds the four additional digits.
Usually within a few days or a few weeks, the customer is
given back revised disks with the new codes.
   The nine-digit ZIPs, when scanned by high-speed
optical-character readers, identify addresses down to a
specific city block or apartment-house floor. Machines can
also apply bar codes to envelopes with up-to-date ZIP codes,
which makes sorting quicker.
   The Postal Service has been offering free conversion for
small mailing lists for several years, but the criticism from
private industry didn't surface until last fall. That's when
local postal officials began actively soliciting much larger
lists. The timing reflects new Postal Service employee
performance guidelines that tie salary bonuses for postal
managers with the number of addresses they convert to
ZIP-plus-four.
   The Postal Service says it's providing the free
conversions to help cut postal costs and hasten a fully
automated mail system. It says it will quit when it thinks
private companies can satisfy market demand. "We only want to
stay in coding activity until there's enough software and
technology to handle the tens of billions of addresses out
there," says Robert Krause, director of the Postal Service's
office of address information systems.
   The Postal Service says that once companies see the
benefits of updating their mailing lists, they will do it
regularly with private mail shops. "It's like dope; if you
get hooked, you'll use it," agrees Ronald Friedman, president
of Group 1 Software Inc., a Greenbelt, Md., maker of
mailing-list software.
   The aim is a fully automated mail system by 1995. To meet
that goal, the Postal Service says it must persuade some
eight million small businesses and professional firms, most
of which spend less than $50,000 annually in postage, to
update their address lists.
   Small mailers that send out a couple of hundred monthly
invoices, or the occasional newsletter, typically handle
their own mailing chores and seldom patronize mail-service
companies. But the private service firms say the government's
increasingly aggressive marketing of free ZIP-code conversion
is beginning to attract junk mailers and larger first-class
mailers that are the bread-and-butter of their business.
   Charles Thompson, president of Ace Mailing Services Inc.,
Smyrna, Ga., says the Postal Service is servicing a
186,000-name mailing list of W. S. Badcock Corp., a Mulberry,
Fla., furniture and appliance retailer that had been an Ace
client for eight years. Mr. Thompson says he has no quarrel
with the postal agency's attempts to reach small mailers that
don't use ZIP-plus-four, but adds: "Rather than selling to
people who have sloppy lists, they're taking on the major
accounts."
   Dick Wendel, Badcock's data processing vice president,
says the Postal Service's address-improvement offer was too
good to pass up. "Sure you're going to use the free service,"
he says.
   Todd Butler, president of Butler Business Services Inc.,
St. Marys, Ohio, says local postal officials assured him they
were targeting address lists of no more than 3,000 names.
Then he discovered that the Cincinnati post office was
offering free ZIP-code conversion to lists with 80,000 names.
"Lists that size are my baby," Mr. Butler says.
   Last fall, the Postal Service's southern division sought
bids on a contract that would offer ZIP-plus-four updating to
lists of as many as 15 million names. "So `small lists' went
from 3,000 to 15 million," Mr. Butler complains.
   Postal officials argue that automated mail will help stem
postage-rate increases. But Mr. Butler says postal customers
are underwriting the costs of the free conversion service in
the form of software and payments to private companies that
perform the conversion for the Postal Service.
   "If they charge their costs out, I'll compete and blow
them away," Mr. Butler insists. "But free, I can't compete."
   Mail-service company owners and trade-association
executives say they have argued their case through technical
committees set up to iron out postal users' problems. They
say they continue to complain, but the government isn't
showing much sympathy. "We protested this all the way up to
{Postmaster General Anthony} Frank, and all we get is lip
service," says Lee Epstein, president of Mailmen Inc., a
volume mail service in Hauppauge, N.Y.
   Mr. Krause says the Postal Service wants to cooperate. He
says local postmasters are instructed to inform customers who
ask about free ZIP-code conversion that private concerns will
do the same work, albeit for a price. He says mailing lists
must be updated every six months to qualify for discount
rates; post offices will do only one free conversion for most
customers. "No business customers should be led to believe
they can rely on the Postal Service long-term for their
address-improvement needs," he says.
   But even now, the industry insists it could handle all the
work. Mr. Friedman of Group 1 Software says the Postal
Service should put its efforts into promoting the concept of
ZIP-code conversion and leave the actual work to private
enterprise. He says, "We need more money out there selling
the religion. We'll deliver the Bibles."

   Martin Marietta Corp., Bethesda, Md., received a $138
million contract from the U.S. Postal Service to make 614
automated mail-sorting machines, the company's second such
job, as part of the agency's multiphase initiative to
automate sorting fully by 1995 at a cost of $2.5 billion.
   The company said the accord signals its efforts to find
civilian applications for its defense and aerospace
technologies to hedge against defense spending cuts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Martin Marietta's contract is for a new, high-speed
sorting machine that uses barcode technology to process
first-class and third-class mail by ZIP code. The Postal
Service uses bar-code machines to process 51% of its mail;
the remainder is handled manually or with mechanized sorters.
Martin Marietta's Information Systems Group will deliver the
machines by October 1992, with the first delivery expected in
late summer of 1991. It has options to build an unspecified
number of additional machines; they were developed under a
joint licensing pact between Martin Marietta and closely held
National Presort Inc., a Dallas-based technology concern.

   Here's how the electronic data interchange
system at apparel maker Levi Strauss &amp; Co. works:
   _Levi's pre-tickets its jeans and other items with tags
containing bar codes similar to those used in supermarkets.
   _At a retail store, electronic scanners at the checkout record
the information contained on the tags. The store's computer records
the fact that an item has been sold. Using the information, the
computer can automatically reorder goods from Levi's.
   _As orders are shipped by Levi's, the company's distribution
center generates packing slips and sends them electronically to the
store's computer. The store now knows what is coming and when to
expect it.
   _Stores receive pre-ticketed Levi's products in boxes printed
with a bar code on the side. This bar code is cross-referenced to
the electronic packing slip number. When stores scan the bar code
they eliminate the need to count the merchandise by hand, and the
goods can be sent directly to the store shelves.
   _Under an improvement in the system to be introduced soon,
Levi's computers will automatically reorder denim and other
supplies needed to make more jeans to replace those shipped.

<P>
At the gigantic mail-processing center in New Orleans, 22 clerks sit in front 
of pigeonholes, the kind used 214 years ago by Benjamin Franklin's office, 
slowly examining each letter before placing it into its proper, numbered niche. 
</P>
<P>
Mail handlers unload letter trays from trucks, wheeling them inside where 
others haul, lift, toss and sort mail all night and half the day. 
</P>
<P>
In the middle of this scene from the 1950s is an island of innovation, the U.S. 
Postal Service's link to the 21st Century: new, electronic sorting machines 
that flush 28,000 letters an hour past blinking electronic eyes and into one of 
100 steel traps, each representing a carrier's route. 
</P>
<P>
But the sorted letters must be picked up again by human clerks and delivered by 
human carriers. In the course of being sorted and delivered, a typical letter 
is touched by 14 humans' hands. 
</P>
<P>
Decades after its first stab at modernizing, the Postal Service -- a 
$41-billion-a-year, government-owned corporation with more employees than the 
U.S. Army -- has undergone the most expensive, traumatic technological change 
in its history. The change has not yet been palpably beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
Having poured $526 million into new sorting machines and other technology in 
the last 12 months, the Postal Service faces a $1.6-billion loss this year, 
declining business growth, lagging worker productivity and raids on its most 
lucrative business by private competitors. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to capture the savings dollar-for-dollar that these machines 
represent or we can kiss the Postal Service as we know it goodby," Robert 
Setrakian, chairman of the Postal Board of Governors, told postmasters in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
30-Cent Stamp Expected 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, U.S. postal patrons can get ready to kiss the 25-cent stamp goodby. 
As Postal Service costs continue to rise nearly 1 1/2 times as fast as 
inflation, the board is prepared to raise postage rates again in 1991, probably 
to 30 cents for a first-class letter. 
</P>
<P>
First-class mail delivery performance was at a five-year low last year, and 
complaints about late mail rose last summer by 35%, despite a sluggish 1% 
growth in mail volume. 
</P>
<P>
Automation was to be the service's hope for a turnaround. But efforts to 
automate have been plagued by poor management and planning, costly changes of 
direction, internal scandal and an inability to achieve the paramount goal of 
moving the mail with fewer people. 
</P>
<P>
With 822 new sorting machines like the one in New Orleans installed across the 
country in the last two years, the post office's total work force declined by 
only 1.1%. In the area most affected by automation, mail processing, the worker 
pool actually increased by 5,131 people, according to postal figures. 
</P>
<P>
Work-force reductions are complicated by union contracts that provide postal 
workers with wages and benefits worth about $20 an hour and contain strict work 
and assignment rules, strong seniority rights, restrictions on the use of 
part-time employees and bans on layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The New Orleans post office is one example of how poor planning from above and 
labor restrictions from below can play havoc with efforts to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
Within an eight-month period, the facility received seven new 60-foot-long 
letter-sorting machines, had two others taken away and another four already in 
the plant retrofitted with new equipment. To make room, concrete walls were 
knocked down overnight and some of the new equipment was used to hold down 
still-drying floor tile. 
</P>
<P>
Despite drastic decreases in the volume of mail handled, the service had to 
hire additional employees: technicians to run the new machines. Postal managers 
were unable to lay off people whose jobs were made redundant by technology. 
Instead, they transferred employees to areas where there was more work and 
adjusted work hours to better coincide with the new mail flow. 
</P>
<P>
Morale Plummets 
</P>
<P>
The changes affected workers' personal lives and depressed morale. "You're 
talking upheaval," said postmaster Charles K. Kernan, general manager of the 
New Orleans division. 
</P>
<P>
About 550 processing clerks on the late-night shift downtown were told to begin 
work at midnight instead of 10 p.m. This meant a 10% pay cut because more of 
the shift occurred in daylight hours. The change also made it impossible for 
many parents to get home in time to send their children to school. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Cola, who works the letter-sorting machine, said his three children now 
must spend the night with his mother-in-law because he gets off later in the 
morning. "The kids don't like it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Postal officials in New Orleans also centralized mail processing so they would 
have more mail to feed into the machines. As a result, 22 of the 34 manual 
clerks in a nearby suburb were forced into the downtown processing center 
because there was no work for them elsewhere. They were put in one corner of 
the facility where they spend the day under-employed, sorting letters by hand. 
</P>
<P>
"The mail is not coming in here so we have to slow down" to avoid looking idle, 
said C. J. Roux, a postal clerk. "We don't want to work ourselves out of a 
job." 
</P>
<P>
The transfer infuriated some longtime employees, who had thought that they 
would be protected in desirable jobs because of their seniority. 
</P>
<P>
"They shuffled me away like an old piece of furniture," said Alvin Coulon, a 
27-year veteran of the post office and one of those transferred to the midnight 
shift in New Orleans. "Nobody knew nothing" about the change. "Nobody can do 
nothing about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With more mail being sorted in processing offices, the goal across the country 
is to have letter carriers spend more time on the street, with larger 
quantities to carry. But some carriers are not happy about that possibility and 
they, too, admit to slowing their work pace. 
</P>
<P>
"They know the future," Joseph Williams, manager of the Carrollton post office 
in a section of New Orleans, said of his disgruntled carriers. 
</P>
<P>
Although automation was planned for years, some offices were caught off-guard 
when it finally arrived. For example, last fall a planned upgrade of some of 
the sorting machines in the main District of Columbia processing center, which 
serves Washington, as well as Montgomery and Prince George's counties in 
Maryland, caused a drop in on-time deliveries from 93% to 79% because postal 
managers were unable to adjust to the temporary shutdown of some equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The standard is 95% on-time arrival. 
</P>
<P>
The most advanced machine in the current automation plan is called a 
"multi-line optical character reader." Its electronic eye can read a five-or 
nine-digit typed or printed ZIP code and up to four lines of address. The 
machine translates the address or ZIP code into a bar code symbol, which it 
sprays on the envelope, then sorts to a particular tray that represents a 
carrier's route. Bar code machines read and sort envelopes that contain the 
codes. 
</P>
<P>
Officials point to San Diego as a model of the way automation should work. The 
success there is due largely to the innovative work of local managers who 
devised their own strategy for using the machines and, more important, figured 
out how to stop the workers from feeling threatened by the change. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a rock in the water," said San Diego division postmaster and general 
manager Margaret Sellers. "You start out with a ripple; if you don't do 
planning, you get a tidal wave." 
</P>
<P>
First, Sellers created an automation team, with five subcommittees to manage 
the change and to sell it to employees. When she received the first sorting 
machine, she put it on display at a post office open house and then persuaded 
union leaders to hold meetings and to walk the workroom floor explaining to 
workers what the machines could and could not do. 
</P>
<P>
"Our reaction at first was against it," said postal clerk Gary Pattee, an 
eight-year veteran. "It was hard to sell it to us because we thought we were 
out of here." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Pattee, like other workers, was encouraged to learn how to operate the 
mechanical letter-sorting machines, and he was paid for doing it on his own 
time. Now his skills and his position are more flexible. 
</P>
<P>
Fast-growing San Diego has been insulated from some of the problems experienced 
elsewhere because redundant employees are used to handle an increasing volume 
of mail. Still, the office has been able to reduce the number of manual sorting 
clerks by 10% during the first year of automation. 
</P>
<P>
The mission of the U.S. Postal Service is indisputably ambitious. Each day a 
work force of more than 800,000 employees in 40,000 post offices and processing 
centers across the country flies, ships, trucks and carries an estimated 537 
million pieces of mail to 92 million households and 7.3 million businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The United States alone produces 40% of all the mail in the world and has kept 
the cost of its first-class stamp well below that of every other major 
capitalist nation. 
</P>
<P>
Postal officials are lobbied by no fewer than 70 industry groups and must 
negotiate compensation and working conditions with four labor unions and three 
managers' organizations. Once a repository for political patronage jobs, its 
relationship with Capitol Hill today consists of 24 annual oversight hearings 
before committees in both houses of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Its work has been made no easier by constant turnover at the top -- there have 
been four postmasters general in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
The history of the service's efforts to automate is one that "makes me want to 
cry when I rehear it," said Deputy Postmaster General Michael S. Coughlin. 
</P>
<P>
D. H. Shepard first invented an "apparatus for reading" addresses in 1951, 
according to records of the Patent Office. A handwritten memoir by Omer M. Long 
in the postal archives shows that during the late 1950s and 1960s the then-Post 
Office Department had the lead in optical character readers. 
</P>
<P>
"We were visited regularly by the foreign engineers trying to learn the state 
of the art," Long wrote. "Unfortunately, management . . . changed so often . . 
. (or was) totally unsuited for the position . . . that we lost all respect for 
lack of performance in the field." 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence F. O'Brien, postmaster general in 1965-68, called the post office's 
1960s research and development investment "laughable." 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, then-Postmaster General William F. Bolger announced the invention of a 
nine-digit ZIP code, which made it possible for new machines to read an 
envelope and sort it to a particular carrier's route. Reacting to opposition 
from commercial mailers and the public, Congress put a three-year hold on the 
idea. When the nine-digit code finally became policy, many fewer mailers used 
it than predicted. 
</P>
<P>
There were other problems as well. In one 18-month period, the Postal Service 
gave $25 million in rate discounts to business mailers for using a nine-number 
ZIP code that the new machines could process, but then failed to process them 
on the machines, according to the General Accounting Office. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, then-President Ronald Reagan appointed Peter E. Voss to the Postal 
Board of Governors. In 1986, Voss pleaded guilty to accepting kickbacks from a 
Michigan lobbying firm for his help in trying to steer a $250-million 
sole-source contract for optical scanners to Recognition Equipment Inc., a 
Texas firm. 
</P>
<P>
Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank said the Voss scandal set the agency back 
18 months in its effort to automate. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign firms now dominate the field of mail-automating equipment. Contracts 
for many of the newly installed machines went to a Texas licensee of a West 
German firm, AEG Telefunken. 
</P>
<P>
This month, reaffirming its long-term commitment to automation, the Postal 
Board of Governors endorsed a five-year strategic plan that will cost more than 
$5 billion. Frank has promised to keep costs 2% below inflation, to achieve 
historic productivity gains and to increase revenues. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a speedboat here. It doesn't turn on a dime," Frank said in an 
interview. "It is changing, it is slow, it is frustrating once in a while, but 
so is every large corporation." 
</P>
<P>

<F P=106> [Article by Toby Moore, transport correspondent: "Luggage </F>
Bar-Code To Beat Bombers"] 
  [Text] Airlines are being ordered by the Government to stop 
unaccompanied luggage being put on board aircraft, as part of 
attempts to prevent a Lockerbie-style disaster. 
  The decision follows successful trials at Manchester Airport 
with a refinement of the bar-code system used to price goods in 
shops. 
  An explosive device hidden in luggage without an 
accompanying 
passenger brought down Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in 
December 1988, with the loss of 270 lives. 
  Since then, fast, thorough checks make sure that passengers 
and luggage are booked on the same flight. But the risk remains 
on a terrorist checking a bag onto a flight and then walking out 
of the airport. 
  It is then up to random screening in baggage-handling areas 
and the watchful eye of an X-ray operator to spot anything 
suspicious. 
  The Manchester trial of equipment designed by Ferranti has 
convinced ministers it is now possible to make sure that luggage 
does not enter an aircraft without an accompanying passenger. 
  Lord Mackay, the aviation minister, will use a visit to 
Manchester Airport on Monday to announce that from July 1 every 
airline operating international flights out of Britain must 
introduce some system to ensure that luggage and passengers 
match. 
  Using the bar-code technology favoured by the Government, 
travellers would have a code stamped on their boarding pass when 
checking-in and the same code stamped on luggage they send for 
storage in the hold of their flight. Airline staff will use a 
device to read the bar-code on the boarding passes. This will 
tell the airline's computer system that a particular passenger 
has boarded. 
  The baggage handler will use a code-reader to check luggage 
sent for stowage. It will give him a pass or fail signal that 
the luggage is authorised for the flight and matches someone who 
has at least checked in. If the passenger fails to board, the 
airline's computer will automatically register that there is 
unaccompanied luggage on board. The system will show instantly 
where the unaccompanied luggage is stored. This will end the 
long process of taking out every single item of baggage. 
  Bar-coding will also make it less likely that baggage will 
end up at the wrong destination. "Airlines spend millions of 
pounds each year reuniting luggage with passengers," said a 
Department of Transport spokesman. 
  Meanwhile, the first system for automatically detecting 
explosives in luggage is now installed at Heathrow and Gatwick.

   Symbol Technologies Inc., New York, said it received a
Japanese patent on its hand-held laser-scanner technology
after a 10-year wait.
   The Bohemia, N.Y.-based company, a leading maker of
bar-code data capture systems, said at its annual
shareholders meeting that it had applied in Japan for a
patent in 1981, despite the opposition of three major
Japanese companies.

   Symbol, which has been selling bar-code reading devices in
Japan since 1985, in March formed a venture with Tokyo-based
Olympus Optical Co. to sell bar-code scanning products in
Japan. This patent will strengthen the venture, said Paul
Berge, vice president, international marketing.
   The Japanese patent involves the handheld "aim and shoot"
devices, considered the fastest growing segment of the
scanner market. The technology is similar to the scanner that
was at the center of a U.S. patent infringement suit by
Symbol. A federal court judge in New York ruled last year
that Opticon Inc. and its parent, K.K. Opto Electronics of
Japan, infringed on three Symbol patents.

<HEAD>658 Bags of Fertilizer Damaged in Coupon Caper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   K mart store officials don't know what
to make of hundreds of bags of grass fertilizer that were destroyed
after-hours when rebate coupons and their bar-code labels were cut
off. Nothing else was taken.
   In the past two weeks, three area stores have been hit and 658
bags of fertilizer damaged, The Palm Beach Post reported today.
   ``We came in the next morning, and we just couldn't believe
it,'' said Vance Callahan, manager of a Hollywood K mart, where 150
rebate coupons were cut out May 1.
   ``The fertilizer was all over the place,'' said David Phillips,
manager of a Deerfield Beach store, where the bar codes from 233
bags were cut out Sunday night.
   In the latest incident Tuesday, bar-code labels were ripped off
275 fertilizer bags at a Boca Raton store.
   Managers are baffled over why only the bar-code labels were
taken off some bags and only the rebate coupons _ which can be
redeemed for $3 or $4 _ off other bags. In order for the rebate to
be honored, the coupon must be accompanied by the bar-code label
and a store receipt, Callahan said Thursday.
   There's also another catch. There is a limit on the number of
rebates per household, managers said.
   ``Who knows?'' Phillips said. ``If they're taking this amount of
time and organization ... apparently they've got something that
works.''

FT  16 JUN 94 / Technology: The end of the queue - Automated supermarket
checkouts will cut waiting time, writes Della Bradshaw in a series on
electronic retailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After steering a packed shopping trolley along busy supermarket aisles on a
Saturday afternoon, there is yet a greater hurdle to overcome: the wait at
the checkout counter. Mindful of such irritation, supermarket bosses are now
considering how to cut the queues using self-service checkout counters and
automated trolleys.
John Hollis, partner at Andersen Consulting, believes it is the push for
better customer service and the need to beat the competition that is driving
such innovations. 'Anyone starting up now would use this kind of
technology,' he says.
Chris Hughes, managing director of the UK's Retail Automation Consultancy,
is more sceptical: 'The main advantage to retailers is that it will cut down
labour costs.'
In the Netherlands, in the Geldermaisen store of Albert Heijn, the largest
Dutch supermarket chain, shoppers are now using a hand-held scanner which
they attach to their trolley as they enter the store. Customers
electronically read the bar-codes on their choice of goods using a scanning
gun. Once shopping is complete, a bill is automatically printed out which
the customer takes to the cashier in order to pay.
Although self-scanning involves extra work for customers, it does mean they
can check the price of each item as it goes in the trolley and keep a
running total of how much they are spending. It also eliminates the need to
unload the items on to the conveyor belt and then put them back into the
trolley at the checkout.
Elsewhere, much of the research effort has gone into automating the conveyor
belt at the checkout so that customers scan their own goods. Retailers in
Scandinavia and the US have been the most eager to install these. But they
could become common throughout Europe within the next five years,
particularly for scanning small numbers of items, such as sandwiches at
lunchtime. 'I have difficulty in seeing someone scan 120 different items
from the monthly shop,' says Terry Fielding, managing director of the UK's
Chiltern Retail Systems.
The basic principle of these checkouts is that the customer passes the goods
over the glass plate in the conveyor belt, a job usually done by the
cashier. Once the task is finished, the customer goes to the cashier to pay.
In the US, various derivations of the basic system have been tested, says
Geoff Beckett, director of business development at Uniquest, supplier of
software systems and services. In the Uniquest check-out, the scanned goods
travel through an archway where they are measured and weighed. If the weight
and shape tally with the information from the scanned bar-codes, the item
travels on; otherwise, it is rejected.
Uniquest has gone further by building in swipe card facilities so that goods
can be paid for electronically. But the popularity of discount coupons in US
stores complicated the process and this scheme has largely been abandoned.
Contrary to expectations, the self-scanning check-outs have proved
particularly popular in the US with elderly people. 'They are convinced that
the cashiers fiddle them. Also they can take their time and can keep a
continuous check on how much they are spending by looking at the sub-total,'
says Beckett.
The popularity of self-scanning checkouts will vary according to the
location and culture of the store, believes John Polidore, director of
front-end operations for Pathmark Supermarkets. It has installed Uniquest
checkout systems in seven of its 150 US stores and plans to introduce a
further two as part of its trial phase.
In some cases customers are eager to scan their own goods, in others they
want someone else to bag the goods and lift them on and off the conveyor
belt.
However, no Pathmark store will be equipped entirely with Uniquest systems,
says Polidore. 'We would like our customers to choose. We see this firstly
as a customer service issue. If the customer likes to use it they'll come to
us. It will increase our customers.' A second advantage is that the
self-scanning system deals more effectively than traditional checkouts with
any sudden rush of customers.
Innovation is continuous. The latest self-service checkouts incorporate
scanners that can read the bar-code through 360`, so that customers can
place the goods in a random fashion on the belt. In a development from
German manufacturer Potrafke, the goods travel on a belt through a
transparent acrylic tunnel where the bar-codes are read.
The advantage to the customer, says Gerald McLucas, managing director of
Potrafke in the UK, is the speed with which the goods are scanned. The
advantage to the retailer is that they get 'two cashiers for the price of
one'. Because the goods scanned have to pass through the tunnel, the system
also helps to prevent shop-lifting.
The potential for higher levels of shop-lifting is still seen as an
important disadvantage of self-scanning systems. But the emphasis on
security varies from country to country, says William Wood-Robertson,
marketing manager with German manufacturer ADS Anker. 'The Americans are
enthusiastic about the technology even though they have a relatively high
crime rate.'
John Pellaumail, director of custom products for the international arm of
Symbol Technologies of the US, which developed the Albert Heijn system in
conjunction with the retailer and the TNO Product Centre, in Delft, believes
there is still a 'psychological barrier to stealing'.
At Albert Heijn, customer trolleys are randomly checked to ensure that
contents match the items listed on the bill. To make customers aware of the
checks, they have to join a 'club' before using the scanners and agree to
the terms.
The club system could have further inherent benefits. 'Because customers
have to be pre-registered members of the club, this could be used by
retailers to build customer loyalty schemes,' says Hughes. He believes the
membership cards issued could become the retailers' equivalent of a 'gold'
card.
The overriding feature of all of today's systems is that each bar-code has
to be read separately. 'In 15 years' time, there probably won't be any
checkouts,' says Fielding. 'If bar-codes could be read electronically, you
could swipe a bank card at the beginning, push the filled trolley through a
loop and your bank account would automatically be debited.'
Earlier this year, the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research in conjunction with the British Technology Group announced that it
had developed Supertag, where each item of shopping would be labelled with a
tag emitting a radio signal. Once the customer finishes shopping, the
trolley is pushed through a gate - similar to the X-ray machine at an
airport - which 'reads' each signal. All the items in a full trolley of
shopping could be individually identified in seconds.
Today the high price of the tags - about 60p each - precludes their use on
packets of tea or tins of baked beans. But, says Peter Hawkes, assistant
director of electronics at BTG, within the next two years, the tags could be
used to secure high value items such as leather jackets.
He believes that as more applications for the Supertag emerge, and costs
drop, the technology will appear in food stores, starting with discount
warehouses, 'where they can tag the whole carton, not just the can'.
Even more revolutionary would be for customers to sit in front of a computer
terminal in the supermarket coffee shop and select packaged goods by
pointing to pictures on the screen. The customer would pay the cashier and
drive round to the delivery point to have the goods loaded into the car -
bypassing the trolley and check-out belt altogether.
As Hollis points out, revolutionary though the concept sounds, 'the
technology for this sort of system is already here'.

The county's General Post Office in Santa Ana found itself under siege Monday, 
grappling with double the normal number of cards and letters and packages in 
the holiday mail crush. 
</P>
<P>
On a normal day, about 1.5 million pieces of mail come through the facility -- 
officially the Santa Ana Sectional Center -- but Monday 3 million cards, 
letters and packages were processed. 
</P>
<P>
The 2,400 employees dug in for the barrage of holiday mail like seasoned 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
"You know it's coming," said Gladys Quan, 50, a postal worker for 21 years. 
"It's not like it creeps up on you." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly every piece of mail posted in the county is processed at the facility, a 
bustling, noisy postal hub for all but six Orange County cities. On any normal 
day, the center's operations are a lesson in controlled chaos. At Christmas, 
it's just plain chaos. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, the machines worked nonstop, sorting an endless stream of multicolored 
envelopes that cascaded down sorting "waterfalls" to waiting mail handlers. 
</P>
<P>
And it wasn't just the machines that worked nonstop. 
</P>
<P>
"We work 12 hours a day, six days a week, and you got your home to take care of 
and you got your presents to buy," Quan said. "I hit the malls right after 
Thanksgiving." 
</P>
<P>
Roberta Kriksciun, 31, of Vista, has also worked long hours, including 12-hour 
shifts, seven days a week, in the three weeks immediately after Thanksgiving. 
But she, unlike other postal workers, didn't lose any time away from her 
husband, Mark. 
</P>
<P>
"He works here, too," said Kriksciun, a letter sorting machine operator and a 
Postal Service employee for more than eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Kriksciun's job is to key-punch in the first three numbers of the ZIP code for 
every letter that passes before her -- one per second. That's about 500 letters 
an hour, amounting to more than 6,000 on a 12-hour shift. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done this for so long it gives me time to think," she said. "It makes me 
think why we're here six or seven days a week, 12 hours a day. I get a chance 
to think of what the meaning of Christmas is. It gives me a real good 
perspective." 
</P>
<P>
While the increased hours are designed to keep up with the surge of mail, the 
long shifts can actually decrease efficiency, according to Bill Fisher, a 
superintendent on the afternoon shift. 
</P>
<P>
"The workload is heavier," Fisher said. "The employees get a little tired by 
the end of the night, so our productivity isn't what is should be." 
</P>
<P>
Hector Godinez, the Postal Service's field service director for Orange County, 
said productivity can also be affected by factors that even advanced technology 
can't handle. 
</P>
<P>
"Our bar code readers (devices that electronically cancel stamps) cannot pick 
up a colored envelope," he said. "So we're using our old-time canceling 
machines that we have to feed by hand." 
</P>
<P>
Another problem, Godinez said, is that optical character readers -- electronic 
machines that "read" addresses and ZIP codes -- can't read script, which most 
people use to address Christmas cards. 
</P>
<P>
And despite its "neither rain nor sleet" motto, the Postal Service is still at 
the mercy of the weather. 
</P>
<P>
"If the planes don't land (because of bad weather), the mail doesn't land 
either," said Postal Service spokesman Joseph Breckenridge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HANDLING THE DELUGE 
</P>
<P>
Monday was the busiest day of the year for the Santa Ana Sectional Center of 
the Post Office, the postal "hub" where mail for all but six Orange County 
cities is gathered and processed. 
</P>
<P>
Other busy periods, according to spokesman Joseph Breckenridge, are: 
</P>
<P>
April 15 -- deadline for income tax returns 
</P>
<P>
Mother's Day 
</P>
<P>
Week before the opening of school -- Breckenridge says many stores clog the 
mails by sending out circulars advertising back-to-school sales. 
</P>
<P>
Week after Christmas -- retailers clog the mails with post-Christmas sales 
circulars.

<TEXT>     Installing these two programs is pretty simple.;    If you have regular
customers, you can enter their names and addresses through your data base.
Otherwise, you enter the mailing address manually. You tell the program what
your sales tax rate is (be sure to enter it in decimal points, such as .06 for
6 percent) and it will total up the order, subtracting any discounts or any
amount already paid.;    The evaluation copy of Fastmail Zip, which prints
envelope addresses, won't actually print your bar codes; you'll need to
register for that. After evaluating the programs (look for Version 2.2 on

   BOHEMIA, N.Y. -- Symbol Technologies Inc. said it formed a
joint venture with Olympus Optical Co. of Tokyo, to sell
bar-code scanning products in Japan.
   The new venture, Olympus Symbol Inc., will be based in
Tokyo and will be financed equally by both partners. The
partners have also signed a comprehensive long-term
technology agreement that calls for sharing of technology
related to bar-code products.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Initially, Symbol Technologies, which designs and
manufactures bar-code scanners and terminals, will supply
Olympus with the products for distribution. But once the
technology is transferred to the new venture, Olympus will
design and make the products in Japan.

FT  25 AUG 94 / Technology: Pioneers on the barcode trail - Vanessa Houlder
reports on a system that has earned its stripes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barcodes, it seems, have become ubiquitous. The machine-readable panels of
black and white stripes are being used to identify everything from newborn
babies to pension books.
Yet barcodes have drawbacks, notably in the amount of information that can
be squeezed on to a label, which is usually restricted to a simple
identification number. In an attempt to pack in more data, manufacturers
have been working on a new generation of codes which store information in
two dimensions.
These codes, which are capable of storing information 100 times more densely
than their one-dimensional counterparts, have been used in applications
ranging from military security passes to labelling parts on the space
shuttle.
The latest company to announce plans to launch a 2D barcode is Tec (UK), a
subsidiary of Toshiba, the Japanese corporation. Its Data Matrix system,
which can store up to 2,000 bytes of information per code, will come on to
the UK market next month.
Its system has little in common with the conventional barcode, in which data
is represented by a pattern of bars and spaces, which can be scanned by
laser and fed into a computer. The Tec system works by putting raw data into
binary code and representing it in the form of dark and light squares in a
matrix - creating what looks like a blank crossword puzzle. To decypher the
code, a reading machine takes a photograph of the image, which is then
decoded.
The company believes that the system's potential uses include keeping
records for hospital patients, keeping track of components on production
lines, and verifying the identity of document holders.
A similar system has already been introduced by Veritec, a Calfornian
developer. The Veritec system was spotted by Nasa when it was attempting to
improve its method of identifying parts in the space shuttle. By marking the
Veritec codes directly on parts, Nasa was able to bypass steps where a human
would manually transfer serial numbers, thus reducing the risk of human
error.
Another advantage of the system was that it was suitable for marking very
small parts, since the mechanism for reading the code includes a camera with
a lens capable of magnifying the image. The technology also stood out by
producing marks on delicate components that were capable of being read after
being exposed to outer space.
A different technology underpins the two-dimensional system designed by
Symbol Technologies. Its system, which it describes as a portable data file,
consists of a series of codes stacked upon each other. A single code can
contain up to 1,750 characters, compared with around 13 on a traditional
barcode.
The system which was launched commercially two years ago, is being used to
mark the uniform of US fire fighters with their identification and medical
history. Symbol Technologies has also experimented with marking blood bags
with the donor's blood group, the blood's expiry date and centre of origin.
The system is being used in security passes by the US Department of Defence
and will be used by policemen working at the Conservative party conference
in October.
Few developers expect the 2D barcode to replace the traditional barcode. The
traditional one-dimensional systems are relatively cheap and effective and
have already commanded substantial investment.
None the less, the champions of 2D codes firmly believe that their
technology will open up new applications. 'It is the most exciting thing
that has ever happened to barcoding,' believes Brian Marcel, managing
director of Bar Code Systems, a UK distributor of Symbol Technology's
system.
Yet so far, the uptake of 2D barcoding has been relatively slow. The
barriers are not due to cost or technology, says Marcel. Rather, the
acceptance of 2D systems depends on potential users' vision and willingness
to be pioneers, he says. 'No one likes to be first.'

<HEAD>Postmaster General Says Mail Changes Inevitable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It may make some people uncomfortable, but
change is necessary and is coming at the post office, Postmaster
General Anthony Frank said Wednesday.
   ``We have to have the foresight and the courage to take
responsibility for our future,'' Frank told a Senate post office
and governmental affairs subcommittee.
   ``It is not going to be placid waters, smooth sailing, and
huzzahs all around,'' said Frank, who was not specific about
changes.
   The postal waters have been decidedly choppy in recent weeks,
following reports of some planned reductions in service standards
at the same time the agency is seeking a rate increase.
   Higher postal prices _ including a 30-cent first class stamp _
are expected to take effect next year.
   Frank told the subcommittee, however, that postal costs have
been held below inflation for the first half of the current fiscal
year and work efficiency in the organization has increased for
three consecutive quarters.
   Mail volume and delivery points have increased slightly over the
last year, but the postal service now has 19,000 fewer career
employees than a year ago, said Frank.
   At the same time, he said, the agency is $361 million in the
black for this fiscal year, although it is expected to fall into
the red as the normal summer and fall decline in mail volume occurs.
   Frank noted the Postal Service will begin negotiating new
contracts this summer with its major unions and said changes in the
way workers are used may be discussed. He did not get into
specifics, however.
   Increased automation will also have a great impact on the
future, especially the use of bar codes on virtually all mail. Bar
codes resemble the rows of lines used for computerized supermarket
pricing and will allow mail to be handled more easily by machines.

   HOME PRICES will keep climbing, but more slowly than last year. 

   "Interest rates aren't going to fall in 1987 the way they did in 1986, so house prices aren't going to rise the way they did in 1986," says John Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. 
He predicts a 4% increase in home prices nationwide, compared with 6.5% last year. 

   The hottest markets are still in the Northeast, where double-digit increases are widely predicted. 
Lexington, Mass., real-estate agent Richard DeWolfe sees home-price appreciation of 10% to 22% in his area, compared with 32% last year. 
Schlott Realtors Inc., Fair Lawn, N.J., says New York metro prices are picking up again after cooling in late 1986. 
Even markets with sluggish economies see improvement. 
"Business has noticeably picked up," says Des Moines, Iowa, real-estate agent John Tiefenthaler, noting a 23% sales increase in February. 

   Oil-patch real estate bottoms out and starts to attract investors. 
Homes for sale in Oklahoma City dropped to 9,739 in January from 15,000 in early 1986. 

   PENSION PLANS put more money into stocks and less into bonds. 

   "There is a definite reassessment of what the asset mix of the public pension funds should be," says Charles Ellis of consultant Greenwich Associates. 
A recent Greenwich survey finds that by 1989, public funds plan to increase their share of assets in stocks to 42.3% from 37.6%, with bond investments dropping to 40% from 45.5%. 
Large corporate plans have 51% of their assets in stocks and expect to stay there, but bonds' share will drop to 24.8% from 26.3%. 

   Equity exposure peaked in 1972, when 73.4% of total assets of private, non-insured pension plans were in stocks. 
"I think we're working our way back," says William Fouse of Mellon Capital Management Corp., predicting equity levels in the 65% to 70% range. 
But without such a major shift, impact on the markets would be negligible. 
"Pension funds are a small part of the pie right now," with their buying dwarfed by corporate buybacks, foreign investment and money put in mutual funds by individuals, says Robert Farrell, chief market analyst of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. 

   BAR CODES move far beyond groceries as technology gets cheaper. 

   More laboratories put bar codes on containers of blood and urine samples for accurate identification. 
Alamo Rent A Car bar-codes its 60,000-car fleet in preparation for a new inventory system. 
Airlines standardize bar codes for making sure luggage gets to the right city. 
New bar codes developed by Cauzin Systems Inc. carry more data and will even store computer programs. 
IBM MidAmerica Federal Employees Credit Union prints financial statements with data in this bar-code form to allow quick entry of the information for use with computer money-management programs. 

   Availability of low-cost scanners for use with personal computers "allows relatively small groups of people to make use of bar codes," says Kenneth Bosomworth of market research firm International Resource Development Inc. 
A departmental control system now costs as little as $4,000, compared to as much as $200,000 when software work was done by consultants. 

   Some future uses: matching people of similar interests at singles bars and in airline-seat assignments, says a "semiserious" Mr. Bosomworth. 

   THE GOOD LIFE costs a lot more. 
The Moet Index, which tracks prices of a dozen luxuries in New York City, jumped 6.1% in 1986, outpacing the 1.9% inflation rate. 
The index's market basket includes a Rolls-Royce, champagne, and a mink coat. 

   SOCK IT AWAY: A collection of 472 socks is donated to North Carolina State University's textile library. 
It includes green Army socks from the '40s, bobby socks from the '50s, early panty hose from the '60s, and a Mickey Mouse sock of 1962 vintage. 

   TAX ADJUSTMENT? 
A Houston restaurant knocks 20% off its "oil barrel lunch" to make up for decreased deductibility of business meals under new tax law. 
Cards on the table read: "The government took it and La Colombe d'Or will give it back." 

   HOSPICE SERVICES gain ground in the health care system. 

   Assured continuation of Medicare's hospice benefit gives wider acceptance to programs that provide aid and comfort to the terminally ill. 
More insurers add hospice benefits, in most cases without any deductible or additional premium. 
One reason: findings that hospice care is 20% to 30% cheaper than hospitalization in the last 30 days of life. 
"Cost containment has a lot to do with it," says Joseph Martingale of Towers, Perrin, Forster &amp; Crosby. 

   Some 95% of hospice patients have cancer, but the mix is changing because of AIDS. 
"It may be the disease that forces the issue of what hospice is about," says Patricia Jones of the Hospice Association of America. 
Thomas O'Hara of insurance broker Jardine Emett &amp; Chandler, Boston, says insurers will aggressively support hospice once AIDS claims start to hit their books. 
"Without hospice, the financial impact would be absolutely enormous," he says. 

   Hospice programs, numbering 269 in 1980, have increased to an estimated 1,500 to 1,700. 

   BRIEFS: A pilot project by Wendy's International lets Dayton, Ohio, customers pay for their burgers with electronic banking cards. . . . 
The first annual MBA Games April 3-5 at Harvard University will pit students from six business schools in such events as inner-tube water polo.

<TEXT>     The Postal Rate Commission said it rejected a bigger increase because small
postal customers already carry too much of the postal system's costs, while
high-volume business users get rate breaks.;    The commission called for a 25
percent increase for third-class rates, which would hit catalog retailers
especially hard. By contrast, the price of a first-class stamp would go up 15
percent.;    And it recommended a price break for small users by establishing
a new, 27-cent first-class rate for bill payers who use pre-addressed
envelopes provided by businesses that feature the more detailed ZIP-plus-4
code and bar codes. These envelopes, which can be sorted automatically at the
post office, make up about half of a typical household's monthly mailings,
according to the commission.;    The 2-cent discount would allow small users
to share the savings the Postal Service has realized from its automated mail
sorting equipment, but previously bestowed only on mass mailers, said
commission Chairman George Haley.;    "The most important part (of this rate
decision) is our effort to restore an equitable balance between the two
biggest classes of mail -- first- and third-class," Haley said at a news
conference.;    Inconvenient denominations;  But even commission members
conceded that the 29-cent and 27-cent denominations would be somewhat
inconvenient for consumers.;    Asked if it would not be easier for patrons to
pay 30 cents than to have to come up with four pennies, W.H. (Trey) LeBlanc
III, one of five members of the Postal Rate Commission, said, "Don't you drive
around the corner to save a nickel on a gallon of gasoline?";    To deal with
the new 29-cent rate, postal officials said 4-cent stamps will be available in
post offices for those holding 25-cent stamps.;    The total package will
increase postal service revenues by $6.2 billion a year, to $48 billion in
1992. The overall amount is roughly what the Postal Service had requested last
March.;    The Postal Service board of governors will meet Jan. 22 to decide
whether to accept, appeal or reject the recommendations.;    But Postmaster
General Anthony Frank signaled support for the complex package of rate
increases Friday, saying in a statement that "our initial reaction . . . is
one of relative satisfaction.";    The Postal Service would decide when to
implement the increases, but experts said Sunday, Feb. 3, would be a likely
date.;    The Postal Service lost $450 million last year, primarily because of
higher labor and fuel costs.;    A penny increase in the price of a
first-class postage stamp raises about $800 million for the Postal Service.;  
 The proposed increase would be the first since April 1988, when the price of
a first-class stamp rose from 22 cents to a quarter.;    Under Friday's
recommendations:;    (check) Postcard postage would cost 19 cents, up from 15
cents.;    (check) Express Mail overnight delivery of a letter would cost
$9.95, up $1.20.;    (check) Rates for second-class mail -- mostly magazines
and newspapers -- would rise an average of 22 percent, or 1 percent less than
the Postal Service requested last March.;    (check) Rates for third-class
mail -- mostly so-called "junk" mail -- would rise 25 percent, well above the
17 percent increase requested by the Postal Service.;    The commission's
recommendations evoked widespread criticism across the political spectrum.;   
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce called the recommendations "another blow to the
American public and the nation's business community, already reeling from a
recession.";    Hard on small business;  Tracey Schreft, associate director of
the organization's Small Business Center, said, "While large firms generally
will be able to pass on the increases to their customers or switch to
alternative systems, many smaller companies will be forced out of business."; 
  Ralph Nader, the consumer activist, said:;    "Their decision of 29 cents is
not supported by their analysis, which would have supported the present rate
of 25 cents. This would have forced the Postal Service to start doing
something about its waste, inefficiency and mismanagement."  </TEXT>

   NEW YORK -- About a year ago, gutsy investors scooped up
shares of Symbol Technologies for as little as 5 3/8. Today,
with the stock at 24 5/8, some money managers think it's time
to sell.
   Sure, prospects for the bar code industry look bright. And
Symbol Technologies, based in Bohemia, N.Y., is the industry
leader. Bar code scanners, best known for their use in
supermarkets, now control inventories in warehouses, keep
track of luggage on airplanes and identify blood samples,
among other uses. Optimists say sales and earnings will grow
15% to 25% a year.
</LP>

   But the stock has grown expensive. Even after being
roughed up in this month's market slide, it sells for 31
times the past four quarters' earnings. Some insiders have
been selling. And competition is intensifying, particularly
in the new "wireless" systems.
   Mitch Kuflik of Brahman Securities is buying the stock of
rival Telxon, which was at 24 Wednesday, and he's selling
short (betting against) Symbol. "The fastest growing segment
of the business is wireless communications," he says. Telxon,
out of Akron, Ohio, "has built a consistent 10-year track
record of growth and high returns as a leader in wireless
systems. The weight of the evidence favors Telxon, which is
also cheaper," Mr. Kuflik notes.
   Telxon is indeed cheaper, but at 23 times earnings for the
past four quarters, it isn't inexpensive itself. Earlier this
month, David Nelson, a Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst,
downgraded both stocks to weak buys. Shearson is "still
recommending the stocks," he says. "We just thought they were
getting a tad ahead of themselves on price."
   Mark Cohodes of Rocker Partners is also long Telxon and
short Symbol. Rocker Partners owns about 7.7% of Telxon, Mr.
Cohodes says, and also owns shares in LXE, a smaller bar code
firm. Mr. Cohodes maintains that Telxon, LXE and closely held
Norand all have better wireless technology than Symbol does.
Mr. Nelson says that so far as he can tell there isn't any
clear winner among the competing systems.
   Symbol claims that it is clearly the technological leader,
and it recently scored a coup by installing its "spread
spectrum" wireless system in many Kmart stores. Telxon, LXE
and Norand generally use "narrow band" radio systems. "Narrow
band will be an obsolete technology within about two years,"
declares Dr. Fred Heiman, the father of Symbol's system.
   Symbol gets royalties from its rivals, which use Symbol's
patented laser scanning technology. But a few competitors,
particularly Panasonic and Nippon Denso of Japan, don't use
lasers. They sell CCD, or "charge couple device" scanners
that use an imaging technique similar to that in facsimile
machines. The CCD devices aren't wireless, but they are
"lower cost, with no moving parts and no maintenance," says
Mr. Kuflik. "The drawback has been that you had to touch the
bar code" with the scanning device, but now a close skim will
suffice. He says that if CCD scanners became widely used, it
would imperil Symbol's royalty revenue stream.
   But Richard Bravman, Symbol's marketing vice president,
scoffs at the idea that CCD could pose a threat. Symbol's
equipment is extremely flexible, he says, allowing a
warehouse employee on a fork lift, for example, to point a
scanner two feet away one moment, and 15 feet away the next.
Experimental CCD systems can go out to four feet or so, he
says, but can't vary their focal length.
   According to InvestNet, six Symbol insiders have sold
371,979 shares since May 1. Nine Telxon insiders have sold
296,366 shares. Also, four Symbol insiders have made
government filings indicating their intention to sell shares
this month. Chairman Jerome Swartz intends to sell 125,000
shares, President Raymond Martino intends to sell 100,000,
general counsel Leonard Goldner intends to sell 22,500, and
Mr. Heiman intends to sell 20,345.
   "Would I be buying {the stocks} here? No," says Robert
Gabele, president of InvestNet. "The insiders probably feel
that these are good levels to sell at, not buy at." Thomas G.
Amato, Symbol's chief financial officer, says insiders are
just "diversifying their positions. . . . Stock options are
an important part of compensation for most people at
high-tech companies."
   Mr. Goldner, the general counsel, adds, "You'll always see
selling . . . even if people think the stock is going over
100." As for the stock's valuation, Mr. Amato says it isn't
out of line "in the context of the market and the industry."
   Still, Symbol's price gives some analysts pause. "Telxon
stands out on a valuation basis," says Robert P. Anastasi of
Robinson Humphrey in Atlanta. "It's something you have to
consider pretty strongly."

At a store in Morrow, Ga., supermarket giant Kroger Co. is taking another step 
with the scanner concept that it pioneered: At two of eight checkout lanes, 
customers may unload their carts and scan items themselves. The products then 
travel along a conveyor belt equipped with a sensor to make sure that all items 
have been "rung up." The shopper then gets an itemized receipt and pays a 
cashier. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fairly user-friendly system," said Paul Bernish, a spokesman for 
Cincinnati-based Kroger. Although Kroger plans to continue testing the nearly 
3-year-old program to "work out some of the kinks," Bernish acknowledged that 
the company has no plans to expand the idea to its other 1,234 stores. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the manpower and resources to devote to this project," said 
Bernish, noting that Kroger has been undergoing a costly corporate overhaul 
since last September. He added that there is tremendous "expense involved in 
trying to make a store totally scannable." 
</P>
<P>
Who likes self-service scanning? Not surprisingly, Bernish said, older 
customers haven't taken to it much. But younger shoppers have. "There is a 
perception that it saves time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another pilot program could help eliminate what many bargain-minded shoppers 
dread: the need to clip and keep track of coupons. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1987, a unit of Citicorp, the New York-based financial company, 
set up an electronic coupon program with the 18-store Ukrops supermarket chain 
in Richmond, Va. About 6,500 volunteers received cards to use when shopping. 
Each month they are also given a list of 40 items for which they can 
automatically receive cents-off credit. 
</P>
<P>
Each time participants visit a Ukrops store, they hand the card to the cashier, 
who runs it through a machine. Scanning equipment then captures a record of 
that person's purchases. If any items bought are on the electronic-coupon list, 
the equipment records the deduction. 
</P>
<P>
"For the consumer in the long run, this saves bother on clipping (coupons), and 
they get $500 per year of coupons," said William J. Ahearn, a Citicorp vice 
president. Ukrops gains because it can tailor promotions to individuals or 
families. And down the road, Ahearn added, Citicorp could benefit by having 
supermarket customers use debit cards tied to Citibank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about precise. Dwayne H. Rapp, operations manager for Stork Symbology in 
Monrovia, one of about 10 U.S. manufacturers of the bar codes that go on 
product packages, said each code must be correct to within 4/10,000ths of an 
inch. But to be on the safe side, Rapp said, "we don't like to send out any 
differences plus or minus 2/10,000ths." 
</P>
<P>
Grocery shoppers may benefit from the increased speed and accuracy that bar 
code scanning affords, but many cashiers pay a high price for the technology. 
Many checkout stands require clerks to stretch, reach, bend or stand in 
uncomfortable positions for long periods. Typically, cashiers move their wrists 
back and forth over a scanner up to 600 times an hour, in many cases twisting 
items so that the laser can read the bar code. Over an eight-hour shift, 
cashiers may handle more than three tons of groceries, according to a United 
Food and Commercial Workers report on problems stemming from scanner equipment. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the repetition, many workers suffer from cumulative trauma 
disorders, or repetitive trauma injuries. Back and shoulder strain and hand and 
wrist disorders, such as tendinitis and carpal tunnel syndrome, are common. 
</P>
<P>
One survey of 1,345 members of UFCW Local 899 in Santa Barbara found that 62.5% 
of female cashiers aged 18 to 49 reported symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, 
such as pain, numbness or tingling in the hands, wrists or fingers. 
</P>
<P>
When scanners first came on the scene, customers frequently complained that 
prices rung up at the register often differed from those in advertisements or 
on shelf tags, frequently in the store's favor. As supermarkets have gotten 
better at keeping their in-house computer price lists up to date, the problem 
has diminished considerably. 
</P>
<P>
But "it took legal action to improve compliance," contended Nahan Gluck, who 
carries the unwieldy title of deputy director of the Los Angeles County 
Department of Agricultural Commissioner/Weights and Measures. His agency is 
responsible for ensuring, for example, that boxes contain as many ounces of 
cereal as they advertise. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, investigations by Weights and Measures have led local and 
state officials to sue several Southland supermarket chains for pricing 
violations. Some stores have been forced to pay sizable fines for overcharging.

   Novels on Computers
   Can Roar and Flash

   YOU CAN LOOK it up on a computer.
   So far, a small but steady stream of reference books has
been put on floppy and CD-ROM disks so they can be used on a
computer. Reference material is a natural for computers,
because it's so easy to search for a specific word or string
of words, letting a user dispense with often-fuzzy indexes.
Publishers also like being able to include video and sound in
their encyclopedias or history books, so a user can, say,
hear Martin Luther King's "I have a dream" speech or watch
Neil Armstrong's first steps on the Moon.
   Now, some publishers are considering moving beyond
reference works into fiction. Voyager, Santa Monica, Calif.,
recently introduced the first of a line of computer-disk
books, beginning with "Jurassic Park" by Michael Crichton,
"The Complete Annotated Alice" by Martin Gardner and
"Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams. "Jurassic
Park," for instance, comes with dinosaur pictures and sounds.
The books, which work only on Macintosh computers, cost
$19.95 apiece.
   Denise Caruso, editor of Digital Media, a trade
publication, says publishers still must wrestle with some
basic issues. Adults are generally uncomfortable reading an
entire book on a computer screen, she says. But, she figures,
people will like being able to search rapidly through books
and to mark up the pages without permanently marring them.
   Later this year, Voyager will introduce a "tool kit" that
will let authors and publishers make their own electronic
books in Voyager's format. Slate, Scottsdale, Ariz., will
come out with a tool kit designed for pen-based computers.
                                                                                                       

   Easing Consumers' Fears
   About Data on Purchases
                                                                                                       

   WITH technology raising concerns about privacy, some
marketers are taking a new, direct approach. In effect,
they're saying to consumers, "Perhaps you do own the data on
your buying patterns, but maybe we can make a deal."
   Some supermarkets have experimented with electronic
systems that collect data on all the purchases that each
buyer makes in their aisles, but they do it by giving
discounts to those who participate in the programs. Now, two
entrepreneurs are hoping to do the same sort of thing using
fax machines. Chip Elitzer and Don Peppers, the founders of
HomeFax, want to give people the free use of fax machines at
home. In return, people will have to promise to accept two
pieces of targeted advertising a day and fill out a monthly
questionnaire about things they plan to buy.
   HomeFax says it will only promise advertisers that it will
deliver a fax to a certain number of households with a
certain set of characteristics, but it won't tell the
advertisers who's being reached. That way, the advertisers
can't send more faxes or junk mail later and can't sell data
on a consumer to anyone else.
   Esther Dyson, editor of Release 1.0, a computer industry
newsletter, says that even if HomeFax doesn't ever come to
pass, lots of things like it will, because such ventures
address privacy issues in such clear-cut fashion. "It's a
neat idea," she says of HomeFax, which is currently raising
funds to test its system.
                                                                                                       

   Shortening Store Lines
   With Handy Registers
                                                                                                       

   THOSE lines at department store cash registers may not be
so long if hand-held "charge" registers catch on.
   Symbol Technologies, Bohemia, N.Y., and Telxon, Akron,
Ohio, recently unveiled registers weighing a couple of pounds
apiece that have keyboards, small display screens,
credit-card readers and bar-code scanners. The devices also
are wireless, communicating over a radio frequency with the
store's central computer. That portability means that a
salesperson can ring up a transaction on the spot rather than
sending the customer to a line. Stores also can have roaming
troubleshooters armed with the wireless registers to pitch in
when regular lines get too long.
   The devices have drawbacks, notably that they don't take
cash. They do, however, fit in with the trend for big stores
to make their networks wireless, so they don't have to rip up
their floors and rewire everything whenever they want to move
a cash register or rearrange a department.
                                                                                                       

   Now Computer Illiterates
   Can Pay Bills at Home
                                                                                                       

   OVERCOMING consumers'reluctance to pay monthly
   bills electronically is the goal of US Order, Herndon, Va.
   Electronic bill-paying hasn't caught on with many people
because it requires the bill payer to have a home computer
and to be on speaking terms with it. Some of the services
were initially very expensive, too.
   US Order has come up with a way to pay bills
electronically without a home computer. For a time-pressed
consumer who's willing to pay $9.95 a month, US Order will
supply a special telephone with a small screen, a slot for
reading the magnetic stripe on a bank or credit card and a
penlike bar-code reader. The company also will provide a
sheet of bar codes, one for each utility and store to which
the consumer makes regular payments.
   To make a payment, the bill payer dials US Order's
computer, punches in the amount of the payment, and then uses
the pen to scan the bar code representing the company to be
paid and the date on which the payment should be made. The US
Order computer then debits the user's bank account on the
appropriate day and makes the payment.
   US Order also will supply special catalogs with which the
consumer can order and immediately pay for merchandise.

   WASHINGTON -- The Postal Service awarded $133 million in
contracts for the first nine operations outside post offices
that will encode for automation a big portion of the mail.
   Four companies were given contracts to do the keying and
data entry for the so-called remote bar coding system at six
outside locations for nine large Postal Service
mail-processing centers. Eventually, the agency expects the
remote coding to cover 20% of the letters going through its
system. Those letters lack full, clear addresses that can be
read by the service's optical-scanning machines in postal
facilities.

   Bell &amp; Howell Co., Skokie, Ill., received an $11.9 million
contract for keying work at Knoxville, Tenn., for the Carol
Stream, Ill., center. DynCorp., Reston, Va., won contracts
totaling $86.7 million for keying at Tampa, Fla., for the
Tampa center and at York, Pa., for the Melville, N.Y.;
Minneapolis; King of Prussia, Pa., and Belmar, N.J., centers.
   The agency awarded contracts totaling $27.4 million to
Envisions, San Diego, for keying operations at San Diego and
Oakland, Calif., centers. It gave a $7.4 million contract to
Unibase, Salt Lake City, for similar work at Twin Falls,
Idaho, for the Pembroke Pines, Fla., center.
   The first remote coding equipment will be installed for
the Tampa center next April. Units are to be installed for
the other eight centers by the end of 1992. The Postal
Service expects 295 systems to be used at 220 post offices,
with more than 200 keying operations at remote sites, by
1995.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hiring permanent part-time workers and
contracting out some services may have to be considered as ways to
save money in postal operations, Postmaster General Anthony Frank
told a Senate subcommittee Friday.
   Rising health care costs and other expenses are eating up
savings realized through automation, and the massive postal agency
needs to look throughout its operations to find ways to cut costs,
Frank told the subcommittee on federal services, post office and
civil service.
   ``So far this year, while we still anticipate that revenues will
exceed expenses by a small margin, we have not done as well as we
had planned,'' Frank reported.
   The Postal Service had planned for a surplus this year based on
the 25-cent postage rate that took effect just a year ago.
   Frank has said previously that he expected the agency to drop
into the red in 1990 and face another rate increase in 1991,
maintaining the recent cycle of increasing postage costs every
three years.
   When postal managers applied for the current rates they were
overly optimistic in their projections in an effort to achieve the
``round figure'' of a quarter, Frank told the subcommittee.
   In the real world, costs have exceeded those expectations,
resulting in a smaller surplus than had been hoped for. Also
affecting the postal budget was legislation last year requiring the
agency to contribute funds toward reducing the federal debt.
   Frank told the subcommittee that in order to maintain universal
postal service, and to save money without affecting the current
postal employees, his managers are having to re-evaluate all
operations of the agency.
   ``Maybe we need to look at permanent part-time people,'' he
commented, noting that such workers are common in other countries.
The Netherlands, for example, hires many housewives to deliver mail
four hours per day, Frank said.
   Another possibility is contracting out some work. The Postal
Service currently uses contractors to handle about 15 percent of
its rural routes, and may need to expand that share and consider
hiring contractors for other tasks, Frank said.
   Use of bar codes on all letters by 1995 and other improvements
in automation will help speed the mail and save money, but those
are long-term benefits and not things that will affect the agency
overnight, he said.
   In addition, automation requires a considerable investment,
Frank said. For example, several years ago managers bought machines
designed to read the nine-digit ZIP codes. Those codes were delayed
by Congress and never become popular with the public, so the
machines are now being converted to perform other tasks.

   BAR CODE scanners, familiar to most supermarket shoppers,
may become common in courthouses too.
   Courts in a growing number of states are experimenting
with bar code technology to improve efficiency in
administration and record keeping. And bar codes may soon
find a place in courtrooms.
   A state court in Plymouth, Mich., will be installing bar
code technology in its courtrooms early this year. The codes
will be used in the disposition of cases, says Judge James N.
Garber. Adjournments, prison sentences and other verdicts
will be recorded on computer by simply running a penshaped
scanner over a series of codes, says Judge Garber. The
Michigan court will use a system developed by Manatron Inc.,
Kalamazoo, Mich.
   "Hopefully it's going to simplify things and cut out the
necessity of someone on the other side of the building
repeating what I do on the bench," says the judge.
   Trial courts in Maryland are using bar code technology to
improve efficiency in a variety of administrative tasks. Bar
codes are used to record arrests and process fines. "It saves
a lot of time and it saves a lot of errors," says James R.
Demme, the director of judicial information systems in
Maryland.
   Mr. Demme says that starting early next year, bar code
technology also will be used in courtrooms to record verdicts
and other orders and produce forms to implement them.
   The total cost of implementing the technology in
Maryland's district courts will be approximately $1.6
million, Mr. Demme says.
                                                                                                       

   Sign on Dotted Line
   About Going Part Time

   SAN FRANCISCO law firms are promising to try to offer
parents parttime work schedules -- in writing.
   The Bar Association of San Francisco is asking law firms
to sign a statement committing them to the organization's
policy on alternative work schedules for lawyers raising
children. The policy asks that law firms, if at all possible,
allow parents to work part time. It states that lawyers
should be paid on a pro-rata basis, based on hours worked,
and that associates on alternative work schedules continue to
be eligible for partnership.
   "Although it is sex-neutral, the real intent of this
policy is to afford women really full participation in the
profession and overcome what has been a major barrier to
that," says Drucilla Stender Ramey, the bar's executive
director and general counsel. She said that six large law
firms have already signed on, and that about 20 other major
legal employers are "on the brink of adopting" the policy.
   Bars in other states have adopted similar policies, but
none have asked law firms to commit themselves in writing,
according to Linda G. Marks, a consultant who worked with the
San Francisco bar.
   She says that law firms often make ad hoc arrangements,
but that many mothers have trouble making career plans. "This
way . . . people really are going to know what's going to
happen," Ms. Marks says.
                                                                                                       

   Lawsuits Could Affect
   Pension-Plan Structure
                                                                                                       

   SEVERAL lawsuits recently filed on the West Coast may
change the way some union pension plans determine eligibility
for retirement benefits.
   Most of the suits were filed in the wake of a verdict in a
class-action suit in federal court in Seattle last summer.
Hotel and restaurant workers, who had been employed on the
Alaska Pipeline construction project, won a
multimillion-dollar verdict from their union pension trust. A
judge ruled that the Alaska Hotel and Restaurant Workers
Pension Plan was structured so that most plaintiffs ended
their work on the project before they became eligible for
retirement benefits.
   Laurence Walner of Chicago, who represented the workers,
said the trustees "knew that almost no one would get a
benefit. They knew there would not be enough jobs around to
cover the required years of vesting." The case is being
appealed.
   In the past six months, other suits have been filed
against pension trusts on behalf of carpenters, electrical
workers, laborers and Teamsters who worked on the pipeline
project.
   Pension lawyers say similar cases could be filed by
workers on other big projects against pension plans with long
vesting periods.
   But Bruce McKenzie of Seattle, who represented the hotel
and restaurant workers pension plan, says, "What's disturbing
about the decision to date is the trusts are having to
provide benefits to people for whom no funds were set aside."
                                                                                                       

   Divorce Expert Warns:
   Look Before You Split
                                                                                                       

   DO YOU REALLY want a divorce? That was the title of a
seminar sponsored recently by the Cuyahoga County Bar
Association in Cleveland.
   Five two-hour workshops were offered to educate nonlawyers
about how to deal with divorce lawyers and the financial
implications of divorce. The seminars were also designed to
help spouses figure out whether they really wanted to file
for divorce.
   C. Terrence Kapp of the bar's Family Law Section called
the workshops "a preview of how harsh divorce can really be."
   Jan L. Warner, who conducted the seminars, is a former
divorce lawyer whose firm specializes in providing practical
information about life transitions through seminars,
publications and videotapes. Mr. Warner says he advises
people to "think, before they run to a lawyer and pull that
final trigger," and to "be your own policeman."

   Linda Fournier bounds up the steps into the reception area, carrying a package filled with back issues of The Wall Street Journal. 
Just before she hands it over, she whips a device from her pocket that reads the envelope's bar code and lets her type in the receptionist's name and the location. 

   It is 9:30 a.m., and a package that was picked up in New York at 7:10 the night before has arrived at its destination, a radio station in suburban Orlando. 
After the delivery, Ms. Fournier returns to her truck and transmits the data she has collected to a computer in Memphis, Tenn. 
That lets Federal Express Corp. know that it has absolutely, positively delivered the goods again. 

   With technology like this, the company that invented the overnight-express business 14 years ago still dominates it. 
Federal Express collects more than half the revenue in what is now more than a $6 billion industry. 
And at a time when deteriorating service is a national malady, this company claims to deliver more than 99% of its letters and packages on time. 

   But Federal Express faces some major obstacles in the months ahead. 
Its heady days of 40% annual growth are over. 
The market for its core business -- shipping documents -- is saturated, forcing it to expand in areas like box hauling from warehouses. 
Its very mode of delivery is being challenged by new technology, most notably facsimile machines. 

   And now, casting the biggest shadow of all, comes United Parcel Service. 
This package-delivery giant is muscling into the overnight-express business, and it aims to grab a large piece of it. 
"It's the immovable object vs. the irresistible force," says Bernard La Londe, a transportation consultant. 

   To the people at Federal Express -- employees as well as managers -- this is no mere business challenge. 
They see it as a battle between good and evil, symbolized by such matchups as the lively orange and purple colors of Federal vs. the dull brown trucks and uniforms of UPS; the easygoing velvet-glove management of Federal vs. the stopwatch, highly engineered UPS style; Federal's up-the-ranks complaint system vs. 
UPS's union-grievance procedures; and publicly traded Federal vs. closely held UPS. 

   Frederick W. Smith, Federal's youthful founder and chairman, puts it this way: "UPS is like -- I don't mean this disrespectfully -- the Politburo. 
And with those zillion brown trucks, like the Russian army." 

   But the Russians still have a way of throwing their weight around. 
With an estimated $9 billion in revenue last year, UPS, based in Greenwich, Conn., is about three times the size of Federal Express. 
That has given it the resources to build its overnight-delivery business from nearly zilch to an estimated $1.3 billion annually in five years. 
Already it has forced Federal to cut some prices, which may preserve customers but eats into historically lush profit margins. 

   Now UPS is spending millions of dollars to develop technology that will give it many of the same luxury services that Federal offers and enable it to truly go head to head -- features like on-call pickup and continuous tracking of packages. 
UPS has also opened storefront counters and letter drop-boxes, and on Jan. 1, it began offering air-express customers their money back if packages aren't delivered on time. 
It claims that it now delivers 99.5% of its packages by the noon deadline. 

   Though it is adding these services long after Federal, UPS views its prospects with the cockiness that might be expected of an industry giant. 
"Our goal is not to chase them, our job is to leapfrog them," says Robert Hughes, the company's strategic-planning manager. 

   Those are fighting words to proud Federal Express, and it doesn't want to give an inch. 
"We feel our God-given right is 100% of the overnight-express business," says Theodore L. Weise, the senior vice president for domestic ground operations. 

   A look at the path of one package through the Federal Express system shows how the company works and how it is trying to hold its ground. 
Accompanied by this reporter, the parcel starts its journey at 7:10 on a Wednesday evening in the Journal's visitor-message center at the World Financial Center in New York. 
There Raymond Harley, a Federal courier, checks the addresses on the packages he has picked up, leafs through a book that translates ZIP codes into Federal's own code numbers, and writes the Federal numbers on the packages to guide them through the main sorting hub in Memphis. 

   On the Journal's envelope Mr. Harley writes the code SFB, and then he gathers all of the packages together and heads out to his van. 
Once inside, he hits a button on a small computer terminal that lists his stops and flashes several special pickup requests from a dispatch center in Manhattan. 

   UPS drivers, by contrast, get a list of customer stops before they go out, and can't communicate with dispatchers from their trucks. 
In fact, UPS industrial engineers study each facet of a worker's task and then dictate, for example, how fast a driver should walk from his truck to a customer's door. 

   Federal drivers are left to their own devices in meeting deadlines. 
But by 7:20 p.m., Mr. Harley is ready to transfer his 60 packages to another van, which takes them to a lower Manhattan sorting station. 

   Cargo handlers there, wearing headsets attached to a scanning device, listen for the beep that indicates that our package's bar code -- which represents the airbill number -- has registered. 
The scanner reading, which is beamed to the Memphis computer, is the first of many that will allow Federal to track our envelope. 
Then the package is taken with a truckful of others to Newark, N.J., where it is loaded into the belly of a Boeing 727. 
By 11:31 p.m., it is airborne, and it lands in Memphis at 1:24 a.m. 

   From 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. each night, 3,000 workers at Federal's national hub sort 880,000 packages as the parcels wend their way through a 65-mile-long labyrinth of conveyor belts and chutes. 
Documents are first sorted manually by the workers -- mostly part-time college students -- who type the destination codes into a computer before sending the packages along on the belt. 
The computer determines how many seconds it will take for a parcel to reach the mouth of the right chute, where a mechanical arm will shoot out and direct it to the right region. 
Then the packages will be sorted once again for the proper city and loaded onto another plane. 

   At 3:30 a.m., Capt. Frank Groner and two crew members take off for Orlando. 
Mr. Groner is part of the minority among Federal's 900 pilots who don't have military backgrounds. 
Founder Smith favors veterans; he was a Marine pilot in Vietnam himself, and he admires the military's gung-ho spirit. 
A poster at the hub declares: "Anything Less Than 100% Is Unacceptable. 
Show No Mercy. 
Take No Prisoners." 
And a program bearing the Navy nickname "Bravo Zulu" gives cash or gift awards to employees who perform above and beyond the call of duty. 

   Mr. Groner touches down at the Orlando airport at 5:54 a.m., and a dumpster-size container carrying our package is rolled onto a truck bound for a sorting center in Longwood, Fla. 
At 7:35, Ms. Fournier plucks the envelope from a conveyor belt there. 
Soon, it is nestled in a van full of other packages and envelopes. 
At 8:10, Ms. Fournier pulls away from the sorting center to begin her round of 38 deliveries. 
From start to finish, the operation has been a human and technological tour de force. 

   More of one, perhaps, than some people want to pay for. 
Fantastic Sams International Inc., for one, has switched its $5,000-a-month account to UPS. Federal's computerized tracking system is superior, says Victor Johnson, the traffic manager for the Memphis hair-care franchiser. 
But, he adds, "So what? 
UPS can get the package there by noon all the time. 
Federal is a good company, its trucks are cleaner, but I'm not that worried about how clean a truck is." 

   Chairman Smith concedes that competition has made customers more prickly about price. 
Federal's basic overnight letter rate is $11, after all, and UPS's is $8.50. 
But Mr. Smith insists that extra service sets Federal apart and that in an era of intensifying competition, that is what's important. 
"The trick now is to keep differentiating," he says. 

   That wasn't the case before Mr. Smith hatched Federal Express, because there was no industry. 
As a Yale undergraduate in 1965, Mr. Smith wrote an economics paper criticizing the slow, unreliable cargo services available then and proposing an independent air-service system. 
His professor, believing the idea futile, gave the paper a C. 

   But Mr. Smith started such a delivery business anyway, in April 1973, at the age of 28. 
At first, it still didn't seem like an "A" idea. 
Federal Express had 14 planes but handled only 20 packages the first month. 
The company was partly staked by $8 million from a family trust of Mr. Smith's, but it had to turn repeatedly to banks and venture capitalists for more money in the early years. 
One time, Mr. Smith met part of a payroll using $27,000 he had won in blackjack. 

   Only after the airline industry was deregulated in November 1977 did Federal Express begin to take off. 
Once it was no longer restricted to 7,500 pounds of freight a plane, it made sense to buy larger airplanes and use its smaller Falcon aircraft to expand into small and medium-size markets. 
The company's operating profit rose from $19.5 million on revenue of $160.3 million in fiscal 1978 to $167 million on revenue of $3.18 billion in the year ended May 31. 

   Unlike many founding entrepreneurs, Mr. Smith has retained firm control of the company and continued to set an energetic tone. 
When bad weather hits Memphis, he often pops over to the airport hub from corporate headquarters to keep up morale. 
He personally hears final appeals of employee grievances, along with other senior managers, each week. 
And he proselytizes, telling employees that they are involved in moving "the most important commerce ever moved" and frowning on anything less than maximum effort. 
"We have high standards and will terminate people if they don't perform," he says. 
"If you brook mediocrity, eventually you will become mediocre. 
We make no apologies for that." 

   As top strategist, however, Mr. Smith doesn't have a flawless track record. 
ZapMail, a document-transmission service, was started as a major diversification effort and proved a major embarrassment. 
Following a three-year effort, it was closed in September 1986 after a $190 million write-off. 
Mr. Smith says it proved to be "tremendously more complex" than expected. 

   But he doesn't apologize for the idea, because ZapMail was an effort to address a real and continuing problem. 
Facsimile machines, which transmit documents over telephone lines, are eating into Federal's overnight business. 
In just one year, the growth rate of Federal's letter shipments has been cut in half, to about 25%. 

   That's one big reason that Federal has begun to focus more on big-box delivery, or the "back-door" loading-dock trade. 
But that move is risky, too. 
It targets a very different crowd from the white-collar clientele of Federal's "front-door" document-delivery business, and the company has had to fine-tune its marketing. 
A big new ad campaign shows transmission companies and fish producers sending big boxes, and the "absolutely, positively" tagline has been dropped. 

   The foray into boxes also moves Federal squarely into UPS's bailiwick. 
In the past, UPS's big brown trucks have crowded out most of the competition for the "back door" market. 
Timing may be a problem, too. 
Federal is opening up this battle front just as UPS is launching its attack on Federal's overnight business. 

   So whom do the experts like in this high-stakes confrontation? 
Most are betting that Federal can prevail in the overnight market as long as it cuts its costs enough to keep its prices within hailing distance of UPS's. 
They argue that certain intangibles favor the reigning champ over the challenger. 
Says Kevin Murphy, a Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. analyst, "There's a little bit of the Ayn Rand type of characters down there -- freedom-fighting heroes, an intense pride."

   Symbol Technologies Inc. declared a 2-for-1 stock split, payable May 31 to stock of record May 16. 

   The maker of bar-code scanning equipment also reported fiscal third-quarter net income more than doubled on an 85% increase in sales. 

   The improved results stemmed from a "steady increase in shipments to a diverse customer base, coupled with a substantial level of sales to the retail segment," Symbol said. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Symbol closed yesterday at $46.25, up $1.375. 

   Net income for the quarter ended March 31 climbed to $5.3 million, or 55 cents a share, from $2.2 million, or 32 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. 

   Year-earlier net included a credit of $902,000, or 13 cents a share, from a taxloss carry-forward. 
Thus, operating profit tripled. 
Sales grew to $22.3 million from $12.1 million. 

   Symbol said it received a federal patent on the design of an optical scanner module. 
Symbol said the design facilitates the replacement of its bar-code scanners.
