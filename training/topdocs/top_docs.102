   The Alberta government approved construction of one of the
world's largest pulp mills, after two years of often stormy
debate in the Canadian province.
   The Japanese-backed, 1.3 billion Canadian dollar (US$1.12
billion) bleached kraft pulp mill became the main target for
critics of the Alberta government's recent push to develop
its northern forests.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Environmental groups oppose the mill, which they maintain
will harm the Athabasca and Slave rivers. Lorraine Vetsch of
Edmonton (Alberta) Friends of the North said her group will
take court action to try to block construction of the mill.
   Bleached kraft pulp is used to produce a wide range of
paper products.
   The mill will be built by closely held Alberta-Pacific
Forest Industries Inc., Edmonton, Alberta, an affiliate of
British Columbia-based Crestbrook Forest Industries Ltd.
Crestbrook, a small pulp producer, is controlled by
Mitsubishi Corp. and Honshu Paper Co. of Japan.
   "We're really happy," an Alberta-Pacific spokeswoman said.
The company first announced the mill in 1988 and initially
planned to complete construction in 1991. Now it plans to
break ground next spring and complete the mill in late 1993.
   Situated near the town of Athabasca, north of Edmonton,
the mill will have an annual capacity of 496,000 metric tons.
A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.
Alberta-Pacific plans to build a C$300 million paper mill on
the same site later.
   Alberta-Pacific said its project will be the first
greenfield pulp mill that doesn't use chlorine, which is
traditionally used in the bleaching process. The company was
forced to redesign the mill to use other bleaching agents,
after an environmental review board found that the company's
first design could have damaged the Athabasca River.
   "The Alberta-Pacific project is the cleanest bleached
kraft pulp mill ever proposed in Canada," said Alberta
Forestry Minister LeRoy Fjordbotten. Analysts agreed, saying
that environmental safeguards also make this one of the most
expensive mills per ton of capacity ever built in Canada.
"This project has been studied from here to kingdom come," an
analyst said. "It has all the bells and whistles possible."
   About C$3.5 billion of pulp and paper projects either are
proposed or in various stages of completion in Alberta.
Daishowa Canada Co., a unit of Daishowa Paper Manufacturing
Co. of Japan, just completed a C$500 million bleached kraft
pulp mill near Peace River, Alberta.
   The provincial government backed many of the projects with
loans and other incentives. The government will ease the
sting for Alberta-Pacific of the long delay in approving the
mill by investing C$250 million in the project, C$100 million
more than initially promised. The government also will invest
as much as C$150 million in the company's proposed paper
mill. The government granted Alberta-Pacific timber rights to
a 28,000-square-mile area, a territory close in size to the
state of South Carolina.

<HEAD>Canadians Shed `99 Tears' For Loss of National Treasure Gretzky</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The mayor of Edmonton, members of Parliament and
even Wayne Gretzky's father bemoaned the loss of the hockey
superstar to the United States, but it's a path pioneered by many
other Canadians from Mary Pickford to Michael J. Fox.
   The decision Tuesday by the Edmonton Oilers to trade Gretzky _
``The Great One'' _ to the Los Angeles Kings touched the most
sensitive nerve in this northern culture: the fear that Canada's
best and brightest inevitably end up in the United States.
   The expatriates include economist John Kenneth Galbraith and
anchorman Peter Jennings, but it's Hollywood that has brought the
most fame to Canadians such as Miss Pickford, Fox, Glenn Ford,
Raymond Burr, Lorne Greene, Raymond Massey, Ruby Keeler, Yvonne De
Carlo, Rich Little, John Candy and Margot Kidder.
   ``It's like ripping a heart out of a city,'' said dejected
Edmonton Mayor Laurence Decore, who credits Gretzky with putting
his blue-collar city of 574,000 people on the map.
   It is not just for the four Stanley Cups and his numerous
records that Gretzky will be missed. His sincerity and quiet charm
made him a goodwill ambassador for the city.
   The tabloid Edmonton Sun carried a simple, sad headline
Wednesday: ``99 Tears,'' referring to the number on Gretzky's
jersey.
   Telephone lines to local radio stations were jammed.
   ``We've had literally hundreds of calls,'' said Rod Phillips,
play-by-play announcer for Edmonton radio station CFRN. ``Everyone
we talked to said, `That's it, I'm never going to see another
Oilers game.'''
   Callers blamed Gretzky's departure on the American he married
July 16, actress Janet Jones, who has a home in Los Angeles.
   Although 3,000 fans lovingly greeted the newlyweds when they
were married in a lavish ceremony in Edmonton, many people have now
turned against the bride. She was likened to John Lennon's widow,
Yoko Ono, blamed by some fans for the breakup of the Beatles.
   An Edmonton Sun editorial disagreed. ```The Great One' owes
Edmonton nothing ... It is Edmonton who owes Gretzky. And all we
can do it seems in repayment is label Gretzky a traitor (and) call
his new wife a Jezebel.''
   Many fans were bitter because the trade came one day after the
deadline for renewing season tickets, and one irate supporter
burned an effigy of Oilers' owner Peter Pocklington in front of
national TV cameras.
   In Ottawa, Parliament member Nelson Riis of the New Democratic
Party made a tongue-in-cheek demand for government intervention.
   ``Wayne Gretzky is a national symbol, like the beaver,'' Riis
said. ``The Edmonton Oilers without Wayne Gretzky is like apple pie
without ice cream, like winter without snow, like the `Wheel of
Fortune' without Vanna White.''
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's office stayed out of the
controversy.
   ``We wish Mr. Gretzky well and we're sure he will be a great
representative of Canada and all that's finest in Canada's national
game no matter where he plays,'' a spokesman for Mulroney told The
Associated Press.
   One official pointed out that Bobby Orr, Gordie Howe and Bobby
Hull _ three other Canadian hockey legends _ also played for
American teams.
   Legislators in Alberta Province demanded an investigation of
government loans given Pocklington on the basis of his contract
with Gretzky as collateral.
   ``The government should hold up the deal until they've
investigated to make sure the taxpayers aren't being honked,'' said
Liberal Party leader Nick Taylor.
   Gretzky's father, Walter, who trained his son on a backyard rink
in Brantford, Ontario, said he was as patriotic as any other
Canadian and was sorry to see the move.
   ``He's a Canadian institution and had been in Edmonton for nine
years. But if it's what Wayne wants and it makes him happy, then
I'm delighted for him,'' he said.
   If there was one bright spot on the Canadian landscape it glowed
in Calgary, the southern Alberta city whose team, the Flames, are
locked in a bitter rivalry with the Oilers.
   ``This should be a civic holiday here,'' said Calgary fan David
Scott.

<TEXT>     "It brought back a lot of memories," Kurri said. "I've got to be a happy
man to be able to play with (Gretzky) again.";   At times it looked as if the
old Edmonton Oilers were skating against the Jets as Kurri was lined up with
Gretzky, while Marty McSorley and Charlie Huddy guarded the blue line. All
were former teammates of Kurri with the Oilers during their Stanley
Cup-winning years of the 1980s.;   Kurri spent last season in Italy after a
glittering career in Edmonton, where he helped the Oilers win five Stanley
Cups.; FLAMES 9, OILERS 2: Theoren Fleury scored two goals and added two
assists as host Calgary breezed past Edmonton in the season opener for the
Alberta Province rivals.;   An Olympic Saddledome crowd of 20,133 saw Calgary
score three power-play goals in the first period to break the game open
early.;   The game produced 44 penalties -- Edmonton was assessed 24 for 103
minutes and the Flames 20 for 90 minutes.; PENGUINS 5, SABRES 4: Jaromir Jagr
had three assists, including on the winning goal, as Pittsburgh began defense
of its Stanley Cup championship with a victory over host Buffalo.;   Gord
Roberts' 30-foot slap shot on the power play at 13 minutes, 38 seconds of the
final period proved to be the winner, as the Penguins came back from a 3-1
deficit.;   Mario Lemieux, who left Wednesday's practice complaining of back
pain, gave the Penguins a 4-3 lead before Roberts' goal put Pittsburgh up by
two.;   Uwe Krupp scored for Buffalo with less than five minutes to play.;
CAPITALS 5, FLYERS 2: In Landover, Md., Dino Ciccarelli scored the go-ahead
goal late in the second period and goalie Mike Liut stopped 24 shots as
Washington continued its domination of Philadelphia.;   Peter Bondra had two
goals and Dale Hunter had three assists for the Capitals, who improved to
9-1-1 in their last 11 games against the Flyers. Philadelphia hasn't won a
game at the Capital Centre since Dec. 1, 1989.  </TEXT>

<HEADLINE>  KINGS PURSUE DEAL FOR KURRI  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Hockey Report
Some information in this report was obtained from writers in other cities.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Gretzky and Kurri combined to help the Edmonton Oilers win four Stanley
Cups before the Kings acquired Gretzky in 1988 in the most-publicized deal in
NHL history. Kurri left the Oilers at the end of last season to play in Italy,
but the Kings have expressed interest in trading for his NHL rights, which are
still held by the Oilers.;    The Kings had been losers for years before they
gained instant credibility by acquiring Gretzky, who is the NHL's all-time
scoring leader. They are battling the Calgary Flames for first place in the
Smythe Division this season, and Kurri, 30, would be a significant addition.;
  Of course, the Kings would be gambling that they could persuade Kurri to
leave Italy if they made a deal. But when Kurri left the NHL, many insiders
guessed that he would return as a free agent to rejoin Gretzky in L.A.;
Because Edmonton kept Kurri's NHL rights, any team signing him as a free agent
would have to compensate the Oilers. But Kings General Manager Rogie Vachon
told a Vancouver, British Columbia, radio station that he wouldn't be
surprised to see Oilers General Manager Glen Sather trade Kurri's rights to
strengthen the Oilers for the playoffs. The NHL trading deadline is March 11.;
   "Glen has lost him for the year and doesn't have anybody in return," Vachon
said. "I'm sure he's going to try to move him to get some assets for the
playoffs.";    Before leaving for Italy, Kurri scored 1,043 points in 10
seasons with the Oilers. He helped them to another Stanley Cup last season,
and his 92 career playoff goals are a league record.; WEST STARS: Minnesota
North Stars owner Norm Green might be able to keep some of the young prospects
he is afraid of losing to the expansion San Jose Sharks, but only if he is
prepared to give up some veterans in exchange.;    Green has been trying for
months to restructure the complicated deal that allows the Sharks to stock
their initial roster with as many as 30 players from the Minnesota
organization, and the Sharks say they're interested if the changes would give
them access to some players they otherwise couldn't have.;    The deal allows
the North Stars to protect certain veterans when the teams begin their special
dispersal draft in June. But the number of players is in dispute because the
North Stars have traded or released several players who would have been
eligible for selection by the Sharks, who begin play next season at the Cow
Palace in Daly City and will move to San Jose's downtown arena when it opens
in 1993.;    Still, Art Savage, the Sharks' chief executive officer, said the
Sharks might be willing to compromise on the number of players the North Stars
can protect if it would land them some of those veterans. Otherwise, the
league might have to arbitrate the dispute.;    "We have no reason to bend
over backward on this," Savage said. "They're the ones who wanted to make a
deal, not us.";    Green wants the deal changed because he says the loss of
his best young players will put his team's future at risk.; SHARK BITES: The
Sharks had hoped to unveil their uniform sometime next week, but they now say
manufacturer delays have pushed the target date back to the second week of
February. . . . Purchasers of season tickets in club and rink-side locations
should receive their seat assignments in the next week or so, said Matt
Levine, the Sharks' executive vice president in charge of business operations.
People buying seats in other locations should start receiving seat assignments
in about a month. . . . The Sharks will begin a new ticket-selling push
Monday, when the team's first radio advertisements begin on seven Bay Area
stations. The Sharks have sold about 5,200 season tickets for next season but
hope to have about 10,000 sold by the time the season starts. . . . Levine
said the Sharks hope to play exhibition games at the Cow Palace during the
second and fourth weeks of September. He said the earliest available date is
Sept. 14 and indicated that the team also might try to play at least one
exhibition game in Fresno or Sacramento. . . . San Jose attorney Allen C.
Speare, who attended the NHL All-Star Game last weekend as a guest of the
Sharks, said the trip provided lots of lasting memories. Speare said he met
several players, including Gretzky, and found most of them to be quite
friendly. Speare was awarded the trip when his entry was randomly selected as
the grand-prize winner in the name-the-team sweepstakes run by the Sharks last
summer. . . . The Sharks are working to launch a "Sharks and Parks" youth
street hockey program and are asking advertisers to provide funds for
equipment. Levine, who plans to have organized leagues established by
September, said the team has contacted about 75 community centers in the Bay
Area and estimated that about 25 of them might be involved in the initial
phase of the program.  </TEXT>

<P>
The final image from Game 6 Saturday night at the Forum remains indelible.
</P>
<P>
Calgary Flame goalie Mike Vernon is on his knees, stretching like an outfielder
going for a fly ball. Just beyond his straining fingertips sails the puck,
moving seemingly in slow motion.
</P>
<P>
With it sails the prospect of keeping the Stanley Cup, won a year ago, but just
out of the grasp of Vernon and his teammates. The puck, hit by the Kings' Mike
Krushelnyski, lands in the net to end the series.
</P>
<P>
It's an image the Flames won't soon forget.
</P>
<P>
But it's an image that weighs heavily on the minds of the Kings, too, as they
prepare for Game 1 of the Smythe Division finals tonight against the Edmonton
Oilers at the Northlands Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
This is the 23rd season of existence for the Kings. It is their 15th appearance
in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
And they have never advanced beyond the second round. Good teams and bad,
Stanley Cup after Stanley Cup has eluded their grasp. It is no problem feeling
for Vernon.
</P>
<P>
Those not into ancient history need only remember a year ago to appreciate the
frustration the Kings have endured.
</P>
<P>
The team was flying high. It was Wayne Gretzky's first season in Los Angeles
and the Kings had just bumped off Edmonton, then the defending Stanley Cup
champion, in seven games. To add to the exhilaration, the Kings had done so by
coming back from a 3-1 deficit, becoming only the sixth team in NHL history to
do so.
</P>
<P>
Enter Calgary in the second round.
</P>
<P>
Exit the Kings, in four games.
</P>
<P>
Now, the roles are reversed. This time, the Flames were the defending champions
knocked off by the Kings.
</P>
<P>
And this time, Edmonton has come back from a 3-1 deficit to survive the first
round, beating the Winnipeg Jets in a seventh game Monday night.
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot different this time," Gretzky said. "We are so much stronger this
year.
</P>
<P>
"Last year, it (the playoff against Edmonton) was such an emotional series.
Then, we were horrendous (against Calgary) and it was over before we knew it."
</P>
<P>
Mark Messier, Gretzky's Oiler counterpart and the man considered the favorite
for the Hart Trophy as NHL most valuable player, doesn't want to dwell on last
season, either. Particularly, his team's collapse against the Kings.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think what happened is going to enter into it this time," he said.
"That's all behind us. We're not looking at that. That's like when you rip your
rear-view mirror on your car. What's behind you isn't important."
</P>
<P>
Unless you can use it as a motivator. Edmonton Coach John Muckler isn't
hesitant to bring up Gretzky, who led the Oilers to four Stanley Cups before
coming to the Kings two seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people remember the joy Wayne got from beating us (last season),"
Muckler said, "and it was joy. I don't blame him, but he's an opponent now and
has to be treated as such. Wayne will do everything in his power to win and we
should, too."
</P>
<P>
Messier, on the other hand, would prefer to leave Gretzky in the past.
</P>
<P>
"All the emotional ties are gone," he said. "This is a brand new club. Wayne
hasn't entered into our talks once all year.
</P>
<P>
"We have to contend with Wayne obviously because he's such a great player, but
it's not us against him. It's the Oilers versus the Kings. That's the truth."
</P>
<P>
If the emotion from last year has truly dissipated, how about the emotion
generated the last time these teams met in the regular season? The result was
an NHL-record 86 penalties in a confrontation that was more a brawl than a
game.
</P>
<P>
The Kings' Tomas Sandstrom wound up with a facial fracture and a scratched
cornea as a result of a punch thrown by Glenn Anderson.
</P>
<P>
"They were coming off a bad loss to Calgary," King Coach Tom Webster said, "and
we were trying to establish ourselves as a team. We both clashed at the wrong
time.
</P>
<P>
"We played with great discipline against Calgary in the playoffs, and we now
have to do the same thing against Edmonton."
</P>
<P>
The Kings got bad news from doctors Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Tom Laidlaw, out since March 17 with a lower back injury, may be
through for the season.
</P>
<P>
And veteran right wing Dave Taylor, who suffered a strained shoulder in Game 6
of the Calgary series, may not be back for the Edmonton series.
</P>
<P>
There was good news. Defenseman Tim Watters, out since Game 4 against the
Flames with a deep ankle bruise, may be back by Game 3 of this series.
</P>
<P>
And left wing John Tonelli, who bruised his knee in Game 6, skated Tuesday and
is expected to play tonight.
</P>
<P>
Taking Taylor's spot on the line with Luc Robitaille and Todd Elik will be
Scott Bjugstad, finishing his first season with the Kings.
</P>
<P>
For Edmonton, goalie Grant Fuhr is out for the year with an injured shoulder,
but backup Bill Ranford played well in the Jet series, stopping 26 shots in
Monday's 4-1 victory to finish the series with a 2.81 goals-against average.
</P>
<P>
Oiler center Craig MacTavish has a hip injury, but is expected to play.
</P>
<P>
King Notes
</P>
<P>
The Oilers were 4-2-2 against the Kings in the regular season, 2-1-1 both home
and away. . . . Game 2 will be at Northlands Coliseum Friday, with the scene
switching to the Forum for Games 3 (Sunday) and 4 (Tuesday). If necessary,
Games Five and Seven would be back in Edmonton April 26 and 30. Game Six would
be at the Forum April 28.

<HL> Who's News: Pocklington, Scrappy and Outspoken, Weathers Heat Over Gretzky Trade </HL>
<AUTHOR> Gary Lamphier (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<IN> BIO </IN>
<TEXT>
   Canadian financier Peter Pocklington is used to being in scraps.
The outspoken owner of the National Hockey League's Edmonton Oilers has been sued by a psychic, held for ransom, reviled as a unionbuster and roundly thumped as an aspiring politician.

   But after Mr. Pocklington stunned the sports world last week by trading hockey hero Wayne Gretzky to the lowly Kings of Los Angeles, he found himself in a bigger pickle than ever.

   The issue: did Peter Puck, as the 47-year-old Mr. Pocklington is nicknamed, initiate the trade for Edmonton's favorite son and the most prolific scorer in hockey history?

   Mr. Pocklington says the trade was Mr. Gretzky's idea.
Mr. Gretzky initially agreed, saying he wanted the move for the benefit of his new wife, Los Angeles actress Janet Jones, and the couple's expected child.
But by Friday he had changed his story, telling a Toronto newspaper that Mr. Pocklington indeed forced the trade.

   For the moment, Mr. Pocklington may be the most disliked man in Edmonton, an Alberta city of about 600,000 that is fiercely proud of its four-time NHL champion Oilers.
Fans canceled season tickets, and there were rumblings about the team's future.
Last week, he defended trading players as necessary to maintaining a sports franchise.

   These troubles may soon pass.
Mr. Pocklington has survived other crises.
A former car salesman who in the 1970s rode the crest of Edmonton's real estate boom, he now has interests mainly in the meatpacking and food-processing businesses.
He estimated last week that total annual revenue of his business interests, which are closely held, is about 1.5 billion Canadian dollars (US$1.23 billion).

   The transition has been bumpy.
At one meat-packing plant Mr. Pocklington locked out union workers and brought in non-union replacements, which led to violent demonstrations outside the plant.
Three years ago he was sued (unsuccessfully) by a psychic who said he came to her for financial advice.

   When the value of Mr. Pocklington's real estate assets fell with oil prices in the early 1980s, his debts swelled.
Creditors grew restless.
Receivers took over his dealerships and seized his cars.
He sold off assets and even used the Oilers as security for a loan to keep his operations afloat.

   On top of all that, Mr. Pocklington in 1983 was held for ransom briefly by an armed intruder in his Edmonton home, and in his rescue by police he was injured.
Before Canada's last federal election in 1984, he made a bid for the leadership post of the Progressive Conservative party.
The nomination was won by Brian Mulroney, who went on to become prime minister.

   Mr. Pocklington, a vocal proponent of free enterprise, survived and rebuilt, albeit with financial help from Alberta's government.
In the past 13 months he spent $53 million to acquire a large dairy and a food company.
"When I first met him, he was interested in any business that walked.
Now he's much more focused and disciplined," says James Leech, president of Union Enterprises Ltd., which sold the businesses.

   Despite the storm of protest over the Gretzky trade and the way it was handled, some say Mr. Pocklington may yet have the last laugh.
In return for his 27-year-old star player and two others, Mr. Pocklington received 20-year-old Kings star Jimmy Carson, a second talented youngster, three high draft picks and an undisclosed cash sum, believed to be about $15 million.

   "One of the reasons the Oilers will be successful for many years is that I don't mind trading off my people," says Mr. Pocklington, who last year traded away another Oilers star, Paul Coffey.
"That's why the Edmonton Oilers won't be another New York Islanders."

   Jim Devellano, now general manager of the Detroit Red Wings and the man credited with building the Islanders into the NHL's premier team before the Oilers dynasty, agrees.
"It's a deal I would have made if I was in his shoes," he says.
"What Pocklington did was to perpetuate the Oilers well into the 1990s."

   Even Ed Mio, the best man at Mr. Gretzky's wedding, sees logic in the deal.
"I don't want to criticize Peter.
He's got a business to run.
If you look at it, it's not a bad deal from a business standpoint."

<HL> NHL's Lowly Kings Seek Higher Ground With Great Gretzky --- Trade Upsets Oiler Fans; Move Could Help Hockey In Southern California </HL>
<AUTHOR> David J. Jefferson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lowly Los Angeles Kings acquired hockey's crown jewel, Wayne Gretzky, from Canada's Edmonton Oilers in a costly transaction designed to put the sport on the map in Southern California.

   Mr. Gretzky, 27 years old, led the Oilers to four Stanley Cup championships in the past five years and holds 47 National Hockey League records, including single-season records for most goals, assists and points.
The Kings, who placed 18th out of 21 in league play last season, have never won the league title.

   The Kings will pay the Alberta team more than $10 million and hand over three first-round draft choices in the trade, which also involves the exchange of four other players between the Kings and Oilers.
While it is hard to place a value on such a transaction, some experts speculated it could be the richest trade ever in any sport.

   "I don't think there's ever been a trade in pro sports that you can say is comparable," said Steven Matt, a manager in the Dallas-based appraisal and valuations group of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. that follows sports businesses.

   At a news conference in Edmonton, a tearful Mr. Gretzky indicated that he requested the trade as a result of his recent marriage to actress Janet Jones, who maintains a home in Los Angeles and has plans to continue her acting career.

   Although "disappointed about having to leave Edmonton," he said, playing for the Kings would be "for the benefit of Wayne Gretzky, my new wife and our expected child in the new year."

   Mr. Gretzky had been the league's most valuable player for eight straight years until last season and ranks third among hockey's all-time leading scorers with 583 goals and 1,086 assists.
His annual salary with the Oilers was estimated at about $1 million.

   Bruce McNall, who earlier this year became the Kings' sole owner, was recently quoted in news reports as saying, "I've got to do something radical to sell hockey in L.A."

   The Kings' season overlaps with that of the popular Los Angeles Lakers, who share the Forum arena with the hockey team.
The 11,600-person average attendance for a Kings game last year was in the bottom one-third for the league, a Kings spokesman said.

   But news of the trade had fans flooding the phone circuits at the Kings box office here, hungry for season tickets.

   Meanwhile in Edmonton, the lines were jammed with disgruntled fans steaming over the defection of their star player.

   John Ziegler, the hockey league's president, broke with a longstanding policy of not commenting on trades to say, "We wish all the players involved the best and hope that {the trade} continues the success of Edmonton and improves the fortunes of Los Angeles."

STANLEY CUP: EDMONTON WINS GAME, 4-1, AND SERIES, 4-1, FROM BOSTON FOR FIRST
CHAMPIONSHIP SINCE GRETZKY TRADE TWO YEARS AGO. GOALIE RANFORD NAMED MVP.

<P>
It was the trade that shocked a nation, angered a city and, supposedly,
decimated a team.
</P>
<P>
Goodby Wayne Gretzky. Goodby Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
For two years, that's all Edmonton Oiler owner Peter Pocklington has been
hearing after dealing The Great One to the Kings.
</P>
<P>
But no more. Not after Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky may be in Los Angeles, but the Stanley Cup is back in Edmonton after
the Oilers defeated the Boston Bruins Thursday night, 4-1, before a Boston
Garden crowd of 14,448 to win the finals in five games.
</P>
<P>
Pocklington, champagne dripping from his forehead, beamed outside the Oiler
locker room after his team won its fifth Stanley Cup in seven years.
</P>
<P>
Arguably the team of the last decade, the Oilers are alive and well in the new
decade. There is life after Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
"I was as much disturbed as anybody in Edmonton over the trade," Pocklington
said. "Wayne Gretzky is not just a hockey player. He's an icon.
</P>
<P>
"But to win in the '90s, you sometimes have to do something unpopular in the
'80s. I did what I had to do. There is no doubt in my mind I did the right
thing."
</P>
<P>
This was a night of vindication:
</P>
<P>
 -- For Pocklington, who has been under siege in Edmonton for the past two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
 -- For goalie Bill Ranford, who had never won a playoff game before this
season and wound up winning the Conn Smythe Trophy, given to the most valuable
player in the finals. Ranford had a 16-6 record, tying the all-time mark for
most playoff victories. In the five games of the finals, he allowed Boston a
total of eight goals.
</P>
<P>
 -- For center Mark Messier, who was handed the mantle of leadership when
Gretzky departed. He had a Gretzky-type regular season, and is the favorite to
win the Hart Memorial Trophy, given to the season's most valuable player. But
Messier struggled through the first three games of the finals, getting only one
assist. He came on strong in the final two games with four assists while
centering a line that collected 16 points in the last two victories.
</P>
<P>
 -- For a defense that was often forgotten behind the fast-skating, wide-open
offense that grabbed the headlines in Edmonton. But Kevin Lowe, Craig Muni,
Charlie Huddy, Steve Smith and Randy Gregg cleared out the puck and shut down
the Bruins in the Oiler zone game after game, allowing both Ranford and the
offense to shine.
</P>
<P>
 -- For John Muckler in his first year as head coach. Muckler, who finally
stepped out of the shadow of Glen Sather, proved he could make the right moves
on his own at the championship level.
</P>
<P>
 -- And vindication for Sather, who left the bench and the coaching to Muckler
and concentrated on doing the wheeling and dealing as general manager who
rebuilt this club.
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the nicest of the five Stanley Cups," Muckler said, "because
coming out of training camp, we never expected to be here."
</P>
<P>
Certainly not when they fell behind the Winnipeg Jets, three games-to-one, in
the opening round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
Edmonton won three in a row to survive that series, swept the Kings in four and
beat the Chicago Blackhawks in six.
</P>
<P>
The Oilers then won the opener of the finals in the Garden in triple overtime,
3-2, and also won Game 2 in Boston, 7-2.
</P>
<P>
After losing the third game back home, 2-1, Edmonton came up with its best
playoff effort in Game 4, winning easily, 5-1.
</P>
<P>
Still, Game 5 was expected to be tough. The Bruins, owners of the league's best
regular-season record, didn't figure to lose three in a row at home, surely not
against a club that had stumbled so often here before in the regular season,
going 2-13-2.
</P>
<P>
And sure enough, Boston came out aggressively Thursday night, smashing bodies
into the boards and the puck into the Edmonton zone.
</P>
<P>
But when it became obvious the Bruins weren't going to be able to handle
Ranford any better than they had in the past, it became merely a matter of
time.
</P>
<P>
The game was scoreless in the first period, but Glenn Anderson broke through at
the 1:17 mark of the second after Bob Sweeney smashed the puck off him near the
left boards at mid-ice.
</P>
<P>
Anderson controlled the puck, skated down the left side and into the slot,
where he found defensemen Don Sweeney and Ray Bourque awaiting him.
</P>
<P>
Wisely avoiding Bourque, Boston's defensive leader, Anderson, without breaking
stride, skated past Sweeney and rammed the puck through the pads of goalie Andy
Moog.
</P>
<P>
Boston never recovered.
</P>
<P>
Craig Simpson scored his league-high 16th playoff goal later in the period, and
Smith and Joe Murphy added third-period goals.
</P>
<P>
Lyndon Byers accounted for the Bruins' only goal late in the game.
</P>
<P>
Boston outshot Edmonton, 30-22, but it didn't matter with Ranford on duty.
</P>
<P>
Messier, the Stanley Cup held high over his head in the locker room with
champagne pouring out of it, also took a moment to look back.
</P>
<P>
"We all missed Wayne, he's a good friend of ours," he shouted above the roar of
celebrating teammates. "This is for you, Wayne. We love you."

<P>
Los Angeles' Luc Robitaille outpolled his more famous teammate, Wayne Gretzky,
for the second consecutive year to lead all vote-getters today in balloting for
the Campbell Conference starting team in the 41st NHL All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
Robitaille, a left wing who leads the Kings with 31 goals, received 298,914
votes in fan balloting for the Jan. 21 game at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena. His
vote total was more than three times the number received by runner-up Gerard
Gallant of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty happy. It's always a surprise," Robitaille said. "I guess I picked
the right position as a kid, left wing. It's always fun to be there."
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, who broke Gordie Howe's career scoring record earlier this season and
leads the NHL in scoring, had 276,980 votes, more than twice as many as
Detroit's Steve Yzerman.
</P>
<P>
Robitaille and Gretzky were joined on the starting team by two members of the
defending Stanley Cup champion Calgary Flames, goaltender Mike Vernon and
defenseman Al MacInnis, as well as right wing Brett Hull of St. Louis and
defenseman Kevin Lowe of Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
Vernon received 216,448 votes, beating out Edmonton's Grant Fuhr to earn his
first All-Star start. MacInnis, last spring's playoff MVP, led all defensemen
with 218,000 votes, followed by Lowe, one of eight Oilers on the ballot, with
187,091. Steve Duchesne of the Kings was third, less than 5,300 votes behind
Lowe.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky was happy for Lowe, his long-time teammate with the Oilers, and
Robitaille, a teammate since the trade that sent Gretzky to Los Angeles in
August, 1988.
</P>
<P>
"Kevin works hard every game and comes to win every game. It's great to see the
fans recognize his contributions," Gretzky said. "Luc is having a great year,
31 goals. What else do you need to say?"
</P>
<P>
Of his own selection, Gretzky said, "It's nice of the fans. I just come out to
play every night. All-Star games are fun."
</P>
<P>
Hull, son of Hall of Famer Bobby Hull, has 35 goals, tying him with Pat
LaFontaine for the league lead. He was tops among right wings with 248,024
votes, edging Edmonton's Jari Kurri, who got 230,565. Kurri became the 25th
player in NHL history to reach 1,000 career points when he had a goal and two
assists in a 6-4 victory over Hull and the Blues Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The Wales Conference starters, announced Tuesday, include Pittsburgh center
Mario Lemieux and defenseman Paul Coffey, Boston defenseman Ray Bourque and
right wing Cam Neely, Montreal goaltender Patrick Roy and Philadelphia left
wing Brian Propp.
</P>
<P>
Wales Coach Pat Burns of Montreal and Campbell Coach Terry Crisp of Calgary
will select the rest of the 20-man rosters. Each of the 21 NHL teams must have
at least one representative.

MIKE DOWNEY: FOR ONE NIGHT, AT LEAST, NOBODY IN NHL IS BETTER
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE DOWNEY

<TEXT>
<P>
If the last period of the hockey season is anything like the first period, the
Kings can go get fitted for rings.
</P>
<P>
There is nothing Bruce McNall would rather be doing next May than be having
breakfast at Tiffany's when the Stanley Cup playoffs come to an end. But like
the rest of us, about all Bruce the Boss can do for now is sit back and watch
and wonder whether another long season will end with another Los Angeles loss.
</P>
<P>
In the Inglewood season opener Thursday night between the has-been New York
Islanders and the wanna-be Kings, there was more than just a chill in the air.
There was hope. Playing shot-a-minute hockey in those 20 minutes, the Kings
outhustled and outmuscled the Islanders, setting the tone for what turned out
to be a 4-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky lit the first red light -- which, if I am not mistaken, has been
written into the National Hockey League charter as mandatory. King Wayne, who
leads the Kings in goals, assists and autobiographies, got another goal and an
assist later in the game, christening the new season with his aluminum-shaft
stick, Excalibur.
</P>
<P>
It was the start of his 13th NHL season and the end of an interesting
off-season for Gretz. A horse he owns ran first in a million-dollar race, and a
book he co-wrote with Rick Reilly had some very interesting things to say about
the Edmonton Oilers, who have not as yet dismantled the statue of Gretzky that
sits outside their arena.
</P>
<P>
What interests Wayne most is where the Oilers and Kings will be at season's
end. As part of an apparent plan to spot Los Angeles a handicap, similar to
horse racing, Edmonton is now doing without Gretzky, Jari Kurri, Paul Coffey,
Jimmy Carson and Grant Fuhr, and is considering a request that Mark Messier
play with one glove tied behind his back.
</P>
<P>
The poor little rinky-dink Kings are bound to make it to the Cup finals one of
these seasons, so how about this season? They close the regular season March 31
at Calgary, and then the fun starts. Or at least that's the general idea.
</P>
<P>
While there were hardly wholesale changes on the King roster, the Forum crowd
Thursday was introduced to Rob Blake, the hotshot 20-year-old defenseman, who
found himself on a line with Gretzky, Tomas Sandstrom, Luc Robitaille and Steve
Duchesne at the time of the season's first goal.
</P>
<P>
Blake is so young that I'll bet Larry Robinson could call him "Toe" without the
kid understanding why. Robinson, who has a son in college, found himself in the
same pairing Thursday with Blake, which probably made Larry feel a little like
Ken Griffey Sr.
</P>
<P>
Although the Kings continue to have as many old faces as new, they did use
rookie winger Francois Breault. Now there's a name for a hockey player. Hockey
players should all be named Francois and Marcel and Jean-Hyphen-something, if
you ask me.
</P>
<P>
The Kings wasted no time putting Blake to work, using him on a power play 41
seconds into the game, when Rich Pilon of the Islanders decided the season was
never too young to start tripping people.
</P>
<P>
Four minutes from the end of the first period, the Islanders found themselves
being outshot, 18-3. That's how frisky the Kings were on opening night. They
made Tom Webster a happy coach on his birthday, playing with zest and
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
But do they have what it takes to go to the Land Beyond Alberta, or is this
going to be another of those years when Edmonton or Calgary get to have all the
fun? The Kings have the greatest player in the game, a generally reliable
goalie, a team plane worthy of Wonder Woman and an entire season, presumably,
with Sandstrom and Tony Granato at their disposal, which might make King fans
forget Bernie Nicholls by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
What they need most to do is be as aggressive on the last day of March as they
were in the first week of October. Nobody ever accused the Kings of being
violent cross-checkers or vicious defensemen. They can't just outshoot
everybody and leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
We shall see. It is only October, and the outlook for winter is bright. Now is
the season of our content.

MIKE DOWNEY: AS HARD AS THEY TRIED, IT'S AN OLD STORY

Turn out the red lights, the party's over.
</P>
<P>
Joe Murphy, the man Edmonton got for Jimmy Carson, who was the man Edmonton got
for Wayne Gretzky, wrote the finish to the Kings' season Tuesday night at the
Forum. His overtime goal handed the Kings a 6-5 loss and a four-game Smythe
Division playoff wipeout.
</P>
<P>
Ow.
</P>
<P>
Talk about adding Inglewood insult to injury.
</P>
<P>
Here are the Edmonton Oilers, without the greatest hockey player since Gordie
Howe, and how good are they?
</P>
<P>
So good that, after Tuesday's game, Gretzky said: "I've never seen them play
better."
</P>
<P>
Seems sort of unfair that a team could trade Wayne Gretzky and get better.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky didn't play in this game; he watched it with a backache. The Kings,
somewhat weirdly, played their two best games of the playoffs -- Game 1 versus
Calgary and Game 4 versus Edmonton -- without Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
For a team that got broomed, the Kings went out like winners. Kelly Hrudey took
shots to his sore ribs and turned them away. The Kings got their fans out of
their seats and onto their feet with a rally from a 4-1 disadvantage that
nearly sent them back to the Great White North.
</P>
<P>
Crazy people, these King fans. They actually had the gall to chant "Ranford!
Ranford!" taunting the one man, Edmonton goaltender Bill Ranford, who had been
the star of the series.
</P>
<P>
There is no truth the rumor that they didn't chant "Hrudey! Hrudey!" because
they couldn't pronounce it.
</P>
<P>
The Kings outshot the Oilers in every game of this series. That's how awesome
Ranford was. They should have chanted his name after the game, as a nice
gesture.
</P>
<P>
But maybe, like the rest of us, they were too disappointed at another season of
Los Angeles hockey going down the old Forum drain.
</P>
<P>
This was the season the Kings could have lugged home the big silver jug.
</P>
<P>
There was nobody else left out there who scared them -- not the Blues,
Blackhawks, Bruins, Canadiens, Rangers or Capitals.
</P>
<P>
The Kings can consider themselves victims of alignment. Calgary and Edmonton
probably have been the two best teams in hockey over the last two seasons. If
Los Angeles played in the other conference, it might have made both the 1989
and 1990 Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the NHL might realign the divisions, putting all the Canadian
teams into one, and slipping the Kings into the Norris with St. Louis, Chicago,
Detroit and the Minnesota (California?) North Stars.
</P>
<P>
But, for the moment anyway, the Kings would rather not think about the future.
</P>
<P>
They are a team centered by an 11-year veteran with a bad back (Wayne Gretzky).
</P>
<P>
They are a team that relied this season on a 38-year-old defenseman (Larry
Robinson), a 34-year-old right wing (Dave Taylor) and a 33-year-old left wing
(John Tonelli).
</P>
<P>
They no longer have Bernie Nicholls, Jimmy Carson, Mark Fitzpatrick, Martin
Gelinas . . .
</P>
<P>
They are a team that hasn't gone one step further with Gretzky than they went
without Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
They are a team that took away Edmonton's greatest player and gave Edmonton
millions of dollars and all sorts of draft choices and still can't get past the
second round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
They are a team that did not play any better with Tom Webster as coach than
with Robbie Ftorek as coach, and, in fact, during the regular season played
worse.
</P>
<P>
They are a too-old team that lacks draft choices. They remain unsettled in
goal, not knowing whether to stay with Kelly Hrudey, give Mario Gosselin or Ron
Scott a chance, or hope that young Robb Stauber will be physically and
emotionally ready by fall.
</P>
<P>
They have not gotten much out of Mikko Makela or Brian Benning, two guys who
were supposed to be valuable pickups, and the jury is still out on whether
Tomas Sandstrom and Tony Granato will make them rue the day they let Nicholls
get away to New York.
</P>
<P>
The best thing the Kings have going for them is Bruce McNall's pocketbook and
his insatiable desire to bring Los Angeles a winner.
</P>
<P>
If he does not produce a Cup finalist with Gretzky working for him, how can he
be expected to deliver one without him? McNall might have to find some sucker
willing to part with a Mario Lemieux-type for a few billion bucks.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky made hockey a happening in this town. Most of us wouldn't trade the
last two seasons for anything.
</P>
<P>
But, as we said at the time, the Kings were gambling an awful lot on giving up
so much for Gretzky. They have gambled and lost.
</P>
<P>
It isn't over yet, for him or for them. You never know what tomorrow will
bring, and, like Scarlett O'Hara, they won't worry about tomorrow until
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
All we know is that, to win a Stanley Cup, the L.A. Kings need more than just a
new division.
</P>
<P>
It isn't enough to have the player. They need players -- plural.

OTHERLIVES: GRETZKY: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY BY WAYNE GRETZKY WITH RICK REILLY

<P>
It's unlikely we'll ever see a deal in sports to compare with the one that
brought Wayne Gretzky to the Los Angeles Kings in 1988. Gretzky so dominated
the National Hockey League that he had won its Most Valuable Player trophy
eight of the previous nine years; he had not only set but obliterated every
previous offensive record in the book.
</P>
<P>
So why was Gretzky traded? Money, he says here, in his first extended comment
on the deal; the trade had nothing to do with his marriage to aspiring actress
Janet Jones and everything to do with the financial straits of Edmonton Oilers
owner Peter (Puck) Pocklington. Gretzky didn't want to leave Edmonton, he says,
expecting to win the city a few more Stanley Cups -- the Oilers won their
fourth in five years just two hours before Gretzky first learned of the trade
talk -- but Pocklington had to break his personal-services contract with the
player before he could take the Oilers public and stave off possible
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Few athletes can claim to dominate a sport the way Gretzky has dominated. How
many have won their lifelong epithet -- Gretzky's is "The Great One" -- at age
10? That's when he scored 378 goals in 69 games in Little League play (the
next-highest scorer tallied 140), and it was only the beginning of a long
string of triumphs. Gretzky turned pro at 16, landed in the NHL -- his third
pro league -- at 17, and thereafter let his stick do most of the talking. In
the book, he does criticize the occasional coach, but rarely other players, and
is careful not to boast. He says he looks "like the guy who bags your groceries
at the local supermarket," he always finished dead last in the Oilers' strength
tests, and, amazingly, he has poor peripheral vision.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky tiptoes around his experiences to date in Los Angeles. He heaps praise
on the Kings' owner, Bruce McNall; hints at minor problems with coaching and
management, and talks of bringing the Stanley Cup to the city, but says he
still wants Edmonton "to be a home." Hockey fans will get a kick out of
Gretzky, for the author is more voluble here -- credit co-author Rick Reilly --
than his reputation would have us believe.

THE PUCK STOPS HERE FOR OILERS;
</P>
<P>
KINGS SCORE 6-3 VICTORY TO FINISH OFF COMEBACK, DEFENDING CHAMPIONS
</P>

<P>
Without Wayne Gretzky, the Edmonton Oilers will not be the Stanley Cup
champions. Not this year, anyway. Gretzky and his new mates, the once
futureless Kings, eliminated the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions with
a 6-3 victory in the seventh game of their best-of-seven National Hockey League
playoff series Saturday night before a raucous capacity crowd at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
It's a new era of Kings hockey with the Great Gretzky, who scored the first
goal and the last goal as the Kings completed their comeback from a
three-games-to-one deficit against the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, who set a club record for points in a playoff series, with 12, and
tied a club record for assists in a playoff season, with nine,has brought the
Kings to life. And he has brought hockey to life in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
But to do that, he had to defeat, with some regret, the players with whom he
has shared four Stanley Cup titles. He also had to defeat, with some degree of
glee, the owner who traded him to the Kings last Aug. 9, Peter Pocklington.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky was last in line as the teams skated past each other, formally shaking
hands. He shook hands with most of his old teammates, hugged a few, then gave
his new fans a No. 1 sign as he skated off.
</P>
<P>
"I honestly had a lot of mixed emotions," Gretzky said. "I don't think it
affected me on the ice, but it bothered me off the ice.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy for the people of Los Angeles, for the players here, for the
coaches, and I'm especially happy for (King owner Bruce) McNall. . . . But I
know that no one takes losing harder than (Mark) Messier and (Kevin) Lowe.
Those guys are champions. I enjoyed playing with them. . . . I feel deeply
sorry for what they're feeling now.
</P>
<P>
"Going through the line was difficult. I wanted to talk with them, but I also
wanted to let them alone. . . . Personally, I didn't enjoy the series at all.
It wasn't fun for me. For 15 days or whatever, I saw those guys every day, and
no words were spoken. That's not what life should be about. You're supposed to
be able to talk to your best friends."
</P>
<P>
There were plenty of new friends packing the Kings' dressing room after their
impressive comeback. McNall was about as happy as a man can be on his 39th
birthday. "I felt like a father giving birth to a new franchise tonight," he
said. "I kept flashing back from Aug. 9 up to today. I was ready to cry,
really. I couldn't believe it."
</P>
<P>
After an epidemic of flu helped saddle the Kings with a 3-1 deficit, they came
back to win Game 5 at the Forum, Game 6 at Edmonton and Game 7 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
That's what home-ice advantage is all about. The Kings became only the sixth
team in the history of the National Hockey League to come back after trailing,
3-1.
</P>
<P>
The Kings will open their Smythe Division final series Tuesday night against
the Flames at Calgary.
</P>
<P>
The crowd of 16,005 and then some roared when the Kings skated out. The fans
stayed on their feet while the team skated through warmups, quieted for the two
national anthems and resumed the original roar through the final strains of the
Star-Spangled Banner and the opening faceoff.
</P>
<P>
Folks barely had a chance to settle back into their seats before Gretzky scored
on the first shot of the game, bringing them back to their feet for a frenzied
ovation.
</P>
<P>
It was a moment reminiscent of Gretzky's first game as a King, when a capacity
crowd cheered him onto the ice and then went wild when he scored on his first
shot on goal.
</P>
<P>
But Gretzky was not a one-man show Saturday night. Bernie Nicholls had two
goals, and goalie Kelly Hrudey, acquired late in the season from the New York
Islanders to give the Kings a veteran in the nets for a game such as this,
stopped 31 shots and earned a number of standing ovations.
</P>
<P>
As he held off the Oilers, preserving the Kings' tenuous one-goal lead through
most of the third period, and then continued to stop them when they attacked
with a two-man advantage (after pulling Grant Fuhr out of goal) in the final
minutes, the fans chanted "Hru-dey, Hru-dey, Hru-dey" on every save.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's goal, 52 seconds into the game, came on a two-on-one break, with
Gretzky slapping a shot at the left corner of the Oiler net. Fuhr was kneeling
there, ready for the shot, and he thought he had stopped it when the red light
went on and the crowd erupted. Fuhr glanced over his shoulder to see the puck
trickling in.
</P>
<P>
The Kings' lead was short-lived. Jari Kurri evened the score at 4:48, putting
in his own rebound of a shot he took off a three-on-one break.
</P>
<P>
Chris Kontos got credit for the Kings' go-ahead goal in the first period when
Nicholls' slap shot from the left circle went high and was about to fly past
the Oiler net when it hit Kontos, standing near the right post, and dropped in
behind Fuhr at 11:56.
</P>
<P>
Kontos' goal came on a power play, the result of a holding call on Normand
Lacombe.
</P>
<P>
A holding call on Kontos with just 26 seconds to play in the first period gave
the Oilers a power play at the start of the second period, and the Oilers took
advantage, tying the game again just 34 seconds into the second period when
Kurri centered a pass from behind the net to Craig Simpson, who fired the shot
past Hrudey.
</P>
<P>
Again the Kings went ahead by a goal, taking a 3-2 lead at 6:51 when Dave
Taylor battled for the puck along the right side boards, took the puck into the
right corner and then sent it across the ice to Nicholls, who took the scoring
shot from the left faceoff circle.
</P>
<P>
But again the Oilers tied it up, making it 3-3 at 7:48 when defenseman Lowe
followed up on his own shot and put the puck over Hrudey, who had been knocked
over by Simpson.
</P>
<P>
A shot by John Tonelli on a power play late in the second period hit high in
the back of the Oiler net and popped back out before goal judge Ted Metcalfe
saw it. Television replays from different angles showed that the puck had been
in, and both Gretzky and Nicholls pleaded, but since none of the on-ice
officials had seen it, the goal did not count.
</P>
<P>
Seconds after Tonelli's shot, Craig Muni was called for holding, giving the
Kings a two-man advantage for the 53 seconds that were left on an interference
call on Jeff Beukeboom.
</P>
<P>
Skating five against three, Nicholls put the Kings ahead, 4-3, with his second
goal of the period at 16:23. Gretzky sent him the pass from the left-side
boards and Nicholls went right in on Fuhr, tripping over the kneeling goalie
and then pushing the puck backward, behind Fuhr and into the left corner, while
falling head first to the ice.
</P>
<P>
A clinching goal, making it 5-3 at 14:50 of the third period, was scored on a
45-foot slap shot by Dale DeGray, a King who had not scored a goal since Dec.
21.
</P>
<P>
The Kings' sixth score, a short-handed goal on the net abandoned by Fuhr, was
not extra insurance. It was simply the finishing touch, just one more reason
for the fans to stand and cheer.
</P>
<P>
Nicholls said: "This was my first-ever seventh game, so obviously, it was the
most exciting game of my career. These are the loudest fans of any building in
the NHL. Once you step out on the ice, you get goose bumps. All year, they've
shown support and, hopefully, now L.A. will be a hockey town."
</P>
<P>
King Notes
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the best-of-seven Smythe Division final series between the Kings
and the Calgary Flames will go on sale to the public today at 9 a.m., following
sale by priority numbers at 8, at the Forum box office and all TicketMaster
outlets. The series opens in Calgary, and the first games at the Forum will be
Saturday, April 22, and Monday, April 24. Because of conflicts in the building,
the rest of the series will be announced Sunday after a conference call with
the NHL. Tickets will be $31, $22 and $16. . . . A shot by Bernie Nicholls that
bounced off Chris Kontos and into the Oiler net in the first period gave Kontos
a National Hockey League record for power-play goals in a playoff series (six)
and added to his club record for most goals in a series (eight). . . . Wayne
Gretzky's goal at 52 seconds of the first period gave him 11 points in this
series, breaking the club's playoff record of 10 that was shared by Mike Murphy
(1977 vs. Boston) and Daryl Evans (1982 vs. Edmonton). Gretzky's assist on
Nicholls' second-period goal gave him nine assists in the series, tying the
club record for assists in a playoff season.

GRETZKY TIES HOWE'S SCORING RECORD

<P>
He was called the Great Gretzky even before he played his first National Hockey
League game. On Sunday night, in only his 11th season and before the adoring
fans of his former team, he pulled even with Gordie Howe, hockey's greatest
all-time scorer.
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky, at age 28, tied Howe's record of 1,850 points with an assist
early in the first period of the Los Angeles Kings' game against the Edmonton
Oilers.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky fed defenseman Tom Laidlaw, who put the puck in front of the net, and
Bernie Nicholls knocked it past Edmonton goaltender Bill Ranford at 4:32 for
the game's opening goal.
</P>
<P>
It was fitting that Gretzky tied the record against the Oilers, who he led to
four Stanley Cup titles in nine seasons. Oilers owner Peter Pocklington traded
him to Los Angeles on Aug. 9, 1988 in the biggest trade in NHL history.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky was revered by Edmonton fans and left the city in tears on the day of
the trade. He had predicted before the season that he would break Howe's mark
on his first visit of the season to the Northlands Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's specialness, Howe said, made the loss of the record easier to take.
</P>
<P>
"If it was, pardon the expression, some clown breaking it, it would have
bothered me," Howe said earlier. "But not Wayne."
</P>
<P>
Howe was at the Northlands Coliseum Sunday night, along with NHL president John
Ziegler and Gretzky's family. Howe scored 801 goals and added 1,049 assists in
26 seasons. Gretzky, playing his 780th game, was one point short of a tie going
into the game and the Edmonton fans were rooting for the record to fall.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky already had the NHL assists record with 1,209. He's fourth in goals
with 640 but Howe's record of 801 doesn't figure to last too much longer.
</P>
<P>
"This one is different from all the rest," said Gretzky, who holds or shares 51
NHL records. "There's no urgency to do it."
</P>
<P>
The swiftness is what makes it so special. Gretzky is scoring points 126
percent faster than Howe. If he plays the same number of games (1,767) and
continues this pace, he would finish with 4,196 points.
</P>
<P>
At similar paces in their quests, Hank Aaron would have hit 1,614 home runs in
breaking Babe Ruth's record of 714 and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar would have scored
71,007 points (a 67.9 average) in breaking Wilt Chamberlain's National
Basketball Assn. record of 31,419.
</P>
<P>
That's why Howe realized shortly after he began playing that Gretzky would
easily top his records.
</P>
<P>
"When he started pumping out 200 points, 80 goals, you knew it wasn't going to
last long," Howe said. "One year he got 215 points and that was 85 more than
the next guy. I got 85 points one year and broke a record."
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's been scoring so fast that he's been the league's MVP in nine of 10
seasons since joining the NHL. He has seven scoring titles, was an All-Star in
all 10 years and has been MVP of the Stanley Cup playoffs twice.
</P>
<P>
Howe, Gretzky's idol, took over the all-time scoring lead from Montreal's
Maurice Richard on Jan. 16, 1960, when he scored his 947th point. Howe said he
didn't recall a big fuss being made.
</P>
<P>
"I can't remember. I played 32 years without a helmet," he said, adding in his
years with the World Hockey Association.
</P>
<P>
Joe Malone led the NHL in scoring in its first year, 1917-18, but was overtaken
in career points the next season by Cy Denneny. Malone went back ahead in
1919-20, but Denneny overtook him again in February of 1923.
</P>
<P>
Howie Morenz took the lead in 1931 and was passed by Nels Stewart in 1937-38.
Bill Cowley went ahead in 1945-46 and Elmer Lach went in front in 1952-53.
Richard took over the next season.
</P>
<P>
Now Gretzky has equaled Howe. And he did it in the most special way: against
the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
"This summer we were talking about Gordie's record," Edmonton's Kevin Lowe
said, "and Wayne told me he had a chance to do it in Edmonton. And I'm saying
to myself, 'Wayne's the only guy in the world who would know what the schedule
is in July.' "

KINGS ARE BEATEN IN EDMONTON, 4-1

<P>
Although he probably could have used two or three times as many, Edmonton
native Kelly Hrudey requested only eight tickets for his debut Friday night as
the Kings' No. 1 goaltender.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to rock the boat," he said.
</P>
<P>
It's probably just as well because Hrudey and his new teammates were treated
rudely by the Edmonton Oilers, who held Wayne Gretzky scoreless and beat the
Kings, 4-1, before a crowd of 17,503 at the Northlands Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, who was held without a shot on goal for the first time this season,
has yet to score a goal against his former teammates, and the Kings are 1-4
against the Oilers, their probable first-round opponents in the National Hockey
League playoffs, which start in less than six weeks.
</P>
<P>
Not even the fine play of Hrudey, who was acquired Wednesday in a trade with
the New York Islanders, could help the Kings, who haven't won a regular-season
game at Edmonton in more than two years, losing six and tying one since last
winning at the Northlands Coliseum on Jan. 7, 1987.
</P>
<P>
This one started to slip away in the first two minutes, when the Kings were
penalized because Coach Robbie Ftorek sent out a different starting lineup than
the one that had been announced.
</P>
<P>
The two-minute bench minor wiped out a power play.
</P>
<P>
It only got worse for the Kings after that. They gave up two power-play goals
and a short-handed goal and failed to score during seven manpower advantages of
their own.
</P>
<P>
Hrudey gave up two goals in the first 10 minutes, including one on a shot that
he probably should have saved, and said later that he was so nervous and unsure
of himself that he didn't feel comfortable in his skates.
</P>
<P>
"It felt like I had foreign objects on my feet," said Hrudey, who later settled
down and made several nice saves while facing 34 shots.
</P>
<P>
Hrudey, who flew from New York to Los Angeles Wednesday and then from Los
Angeles to Edmonton Thursday with his new teammates, appeared anxious even
before a low-key practice Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
"I can't wait to get this first game over with and start to feel more
acclimated," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hrudey said it would be wrong for the Kings to think of him as a savior,
although Gretzky reportedly helped initiate the trade when he cornered Islander
General Manager Bill Torrey at the All-Star game 2 1/2 weeks ago and inquired
about the goaltender's availability.
</P>
<P>
"I'm just another piece in the puzzle," Hrudey said. "It's a team game.
Obviously, we're a highly talented team, but we have to play as a unit and we
have to show some chemistry because as I look around the (locker) room, there
aren't a lot of guys who have been in this organization a long time."
</P>
<P>
Does he feel pressured?
</P>
<P>
"Who doesn't," said Hrudey, who is expected to provide a missing link for the
Kings. "There's been a lot of hype. As much as you try to block it all out, you
can't. You're always going to be subject to it."
</P>
<P>
Especially now that he's with the Kings, who have given up more goals than all
but two other teams in the league.
</P>
<P>
Hrudey found out why in a hurry, when Edmonton's Craig MacTavish stole the puck
from King defenseman Steve Duchesne along the right boards in the Kings' zone.
MacTavish fed the puck to Charlie Huddy, whose shot from the top of the left
circle deflected off Hrudey's pad and trickled into the net.
</P>
<P>
The short-handed goal -- Doug Halward was in the penalty box for hooking --
gave the Oilers a 1-0 lead just 6 minutes 8 seconds into the game.
</P>
<P>
Edmonton made it 2-0 at 9:53, again taking advantage of a mistake by the Kings.
Actually, it was a pair of mistakes.
</P>
<P>
First, a bench minor for having too many players on the ice gave the Oilers a
power play. Then, Gretzky was unable to control a clearing pass in the Kings'
zone. The puck glanced off his skate and was chased down by the Oilers' Jimmy
Carson, who quickly passed to Esa Tikkanen.
</P>
<P>
Tikkanen, streaking in from the right side, took the pass, juked Hrudey with a
pretty move and tapped a short shot into the net.
</P>
<P>
That goal, however, made up only part of Tikkanen's contribution. Described by
Mario Lemieux of the Pittsburgh Penguins this season as the NHL's premier
checker, Tikkanen this time hounded Gretzky, his former linemate, holding him
without a point for only the sixth time in 61 games.
</P>
<P>
How would Gretzky rate him?
</P>
<P>
"By his performance tonight, he's got to be one of the best," Gretzky said. "He
shut me down."
</P>
<P>
And the Oilers shut down the Kings. The first period ended with the Kings
trailing, 2-0, and in serious trouble. Edmonton is 17-0-1 this season in games
it has led at the end of the first period.
</P>
<P>
Dave Taylor finally scored for the Kings at 8:56 of the third period, but that
only cut their deficit to 3-1. A power-play goal by Jari Kurri, who scored from
in front off a pass by Mark Messier, had given the Oilers a 3-0 advantage at
5:02 of the second period.
</P>
<P>
King Notes
</P>
<P>
Glenn Healy, suddenly the Kings' No. 2 goaltender, on reports that teammate
Wayne Gretzky initiated the trade that brought Kelly Hrudey to the Kings from
the New York Islanders: "I'm not going to hold it against Wayne. It disappoints
me that 25 wins, with (18) games still to go, isn't enough. But when everything
is all cut and dried, if it brings us the Stanley Cup, I'm not really going to
mind so much. But it is discouraging." Only Mike Vernon of the Calgary Flames
and Ron Hextall of the Philadelphia Flyers have won more games this season than
Healy, who is 25-16-2. Mario Lessard established a club record when he won 35
games for the Kings in the 1980-81 season.

<TEXT>     "I can't root for those guys," Ferreira said the other day. "I'm supposed
to be starting a rivalry with them.";    The Kings have clinched first place
in the Smythe Division, marking the first division title in franchise history.
But Ferreira's sentimental choice for the Stanley Cup is the Calgary Flames
because he was a scout for the Flames in the early 1980s and helped build the
team that won the Cup in the 1988-89 season.;    Calgary's road to the final
is full of obstacles, however. The Flames open the playoffs against the
defending Stanley Cup champion Edmonton Oilers, and the winner of that series
will face the Kings in the second round if the Kings beat the Vancouver
Canucks in another first-round series.;    And although the Kings have never
advanced past the second round, they appear to be legitimate contenders this
season.;    Just don't expect Ferreira to root for them. It hasn't taken him
long to catch on to the Bay Area-L.A. rivalry.;  SHADES OF BLUE: Former San
Jose resident John Blue is playing for the Maine Mariners, an American Hockey
League affiliate of the Boston Bruins.;    Blue, a goalie who was on the 1988
U.S. Olympic team and led a U.S. squad to a victory over the Soviet national
team in an exhibition game in Oakland last summer, has been with the Mariners
since March 5, when he was sent there on loan from the Minnesota North Stars'
organization.;    Blue is 2-4-1 for the Mariners and has allowed an average of
2.57 goals per game.;  AROUND THE NHL: The public-relations department of the
Chicago Blackhawks is working overtime to push players for postseason awards.
The Hawks have mailed out clippings to promote goalie Ed Belfour for the
Calder Cup as the NHL's rookie of the year, Steve Larmer and Dirk Graham for
the Selke Trophy as the best defensive forward and Chris Chelios for the
Norris Trophy as the best defenseman. Belfour also is a candidate for the
Vezina Trophy as the league's No. 1 goalie. If he wins the Calder and the
Vezina, Belfour would become the fourth goalie to accomplish the feat. The
others were Hall of Famers Frank Brimsek (Boston Bruins, 1939) and Tony
Esposito (Chicago, 1970) and current Pittsburgh Penguins goalie Tom Barrasso
(Buffalo Sabres, 1984). . . . The Quebec Nordiques are expected to spend about
$200,000 on a huge light and sound show to mark Guy Lafleur's final NHL game
tonight. Fittingly, the Nordiques will face Lafleur's former team, the
Montreal Canadiens. . . . Rookie center Stephane Morin of the Nordiques
already is thinking about what life will be like with Eric Lindros, the
talented center who is expected to be Quebec's No. 1 pick in June's entry
draft. Morin moved to left wing for a recent game against Edmonton and had
four assists in a 7-6 loss. "It was the first time I've ever played left
wing," Morin said. "Maybe next year when Lindros is here, the coach will put
me on left wing with him. I like left wing." . . . Kings center Wayne Gretzky,
who just invested in a Honus Wagner baseball card worth nearly a half-million
dollars, has started a hockey card collection for his 2-year-old daughter,
Paulina. But this collection has only one card -- an autographed version of
the first card picturing Gretzky in a Los Angeles uniform. Gretzky says it's
the only copy of that particular card that he will sign, which should make it
quite valuable.;  SHARK BITES: The Sharks announced Saturday that they have
selected the Kansas City Blades as their top minor league affiliate. The
Blades presently are an independent franchise in the International Hockey
League. . . . Ferreira also said the Sharks may follow the lead of the Kings
and invest in a private jet. The Kings have traveled in their own plane this
season, and players have said the convenience has been worth several points in
the standings.;  SHOPPING FOR VALUE; Who is the most valuable player in the

HOCKEY: RESURGENT EDMONTON IS 9-1-1 IN ITS LAST 11 GAMES, A STREAK THAT HAS
TAKEN CLUB FROM LAST TO ATOP THE SMYTHE DIVISION.

<P>
Is there life after Wayne Gretzky?
</P>
<P>
Apparently so.
</P>
<P>
The Edmonton Oilers, decimated by the trading of their superstar to the Kings
before last season and mired in last place in the Smythe Division three weeks
ago, are beginning to rise again, bringing shudders from the rest of an NHL
that remembers all too well the Oiler rampage through the 1980s that resulted
in four Stanley Cup championships in six seasons.
</P>
<P>
That, of course, was largely due to Gretzky, but there are new stars here now,
several of whom helped the rejuvenated Oilers defeat the Kings Friday night,
5-4, in overtime, for their sixth consecutive victory. In their last 11 games,
the Oilers are 9-1-1 to move atop the division.
</P>
<P>
The winning goal came at 2:03. A pass by Bernie Nicholls was intercepted by
Oiler right winger Jari Kurri, who skated into the Kings' zone, flipped the
puck behind him to teammate Petr Klima, then received it back on a pass into
the right corner.
</P>
<P>
From there, Kurri passed it in front of the net to the waiting stick of Mark
Lamb, who was barreling down the middle.
</P>
<P>
In an instant, Lamb, King goalie Kelly Hrudey, stick and puck all came
together.
</P>
<P>
There was little Hrudey could do as Lamb flipped the puck past him, sending the
Northlands Coliseum crowd of 17,503 home into the snowy night.
</P>
<P>
"It was an easy goal," Lamb said. "The pass was right on my stick."
</P>
<P>
Lamb was smiling as he spoke, but that was not the case in the second period
when he misfired on a breakaway.
</P>
<P>
"That (the goal) kind of made up for the breakaway," he said. "I had too much
time to think on that one. There were a million things on my mind. That would
have made them fold."
</P>
<P>
It would have made the score 5-2 at the time.
</P>
<P>
In losing anyway, the Kings (14-12-2) fell five points behind the Oilers
(15-10-5).
</P>
<P>
It certainly didn't appear the game would be close in the second period, when
the Oilers took a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
But the Kings crept back and tied the score in the third period on a Gretzky
power-play goal.
</P>
<P>
Standing behind the Oiler net at the 14:30 mark, Getzky pushed the puck into
the crease, where it caromed off the skate of Adam Graves into the net.
</P>
<P>
"I just threw it in front and it hit Adam in the skate," Gretzky said. "It was
just one of those lucky goals. It happens."
</P>
<P>
It was Gretzky's 13th goal of the season and his fourth on the power play.
Earlier, he had extended his scoring streak to 14 games with an assist.
</P>
<P>
Edmonton defenseman Randy Gregg opened the scoring with his first goal of the
season. Taking a perfect pass from Klima in the left corner, Gregg -- wide open
-- smacked the puck in at 6:10 of the first period. Lamb also got an assist on
the play.
</P>
<P>
The Oilers' other goal of the period came on a power play at 15:21, Mark
Messier scoring his 19th of the season from the middle of the right circle. It
was his sixth power-play goal, with assists going to Steve Smith and Charlie
Huddy.
</P>
<P>
The Kings' offense went from weak to non-existent. They took only six shots on
goal in the period, none in the last 8 1/2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
But early in the second period, the Kings got back in the game on a power play
goal initiated by Luc Robitaille. From behind the net, Robitaille flipped the
puck out to Gretzky, who passed it to Steve Duchesne. Duchesne responded with
his eighth goal of the season at 1:51 and the Kings had pulled to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
But the Oilers came back with two second-period goals. The first came on a shot
by Craig Simpson, who scored his 11th goal at 7:04, past goalie Hrudey on his
short side with the assist to Glenn Anderson.
</P>
<P>
The second came on a power play. Kurri fired a shot that Hrudey deflected off
the boards. The rebound came back to Klima, who backhanded it in at 12:47. It
was Klima's sixth goal, his third on a power play.
</P>
<P>
The Kings got their second goal at 15:43 when Duchesne carried the puck to the
goal mouth. There it was pushed away by goalie Grant Fuhr. But John Tonelli
followed the puck across the goal mouth and pushed it back in.
</P>
<P>
The Kings again pulled to within one when Mike Krushelnyski scored a
short-handed goal at 7:45 of the final period.
</P>
<P>
"We showed a lot of character coming back," Hrudey said. "We stuck our noses in
it. To lose then was a bit of a heartbreak."
</P>
<P>
King Notes
</P>
<P>
Much of the world may be intrigued by the Soviets, but apparently not Edmonton.
Wednesday's exhibition game here between the Oilers and Khimik Voskresensk, a
touring Soviet squad, drew only 6,804, smallest crowd ever in Northlands
Coliseum. . . . How big was the game to the Oilers? "It was better than
practicing," said Edmonton Coach John Muckler. . . . Because Khimik played the
Kings earlier in the week, Soviet Coach Vladimir Vasiliev was asked by an
Edmonton Journal reporter to compare the two squads. "The Oilers are much
stronger," Vasiliev said. "It seems to me they have more superstars than Los
Angeles. Of course, it goes without saying (Wayne) Gretzky is superstar No. 1."
</P>
<P>
Another Edmonton paper, the Sun, is asking its readers to pick the newsmaker of
the decade. Among the top choices are both Gretzky and Peter Pocklington, the
man who traded him to the Kings.

<LEADPARA>  THE NHL will open its 75th season with a first-time defending Stanley Cup
champion, a new franchise in San Jose and a search party for Eric Lindros.;
Naturally, most eyes will be on champion Pittsburgh. Many thought when the
Penguins drafted Mario Lemieux in 1984, it was only a matter of time before
they won a Cup. Now it's time to see whether he can stay healthy and lead the
Penguins to a reign of championships the way Wayne Gretzky did in Edmonton.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Special Section  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  NHL'S 75TH SEASON HAS A DIFFERENT LOOK  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  HOCKEY '91. DIVISION PREVIEW  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Making that job more difficult will be the pall cast on the Penguins'
season by the brain tumor of Coach Bob Johnson.;   Although stuffed with
talent and confidence, the Penguins are not a heavy favorite to repeat.
Calgary and Los Angeles will battle for the Smythe title, and Detroit could
join Chicago and St. Louis in a Norris tussle.;   Back east, the New York
Rangers are still trying to win their first Cup since 1940. The balance of
power could shift if and when Lindros decides to play in Quebec, or forces a
trade.; CAMPBELL CONFERENCE; SMYTHE DIVISION; (box) LAST SEASON: The Kings won
the division by two points over Calgary, and then there was a drop off of 20
points to Edmonton, which finished .500. The Flames scored more goals than any
team in the NHL (344), and the Kings were just four behind.;   (box) NEW
FACES: Well, how about a whole new franchise in San Jose? Other than that, the
news is the reunion of Wayne Gretzky with Jari Kurri, who again will ride
shotgun for Gretzky, this time in Los Angeles. The Oilers again traded
veterans for younger stars, acquiring Vincent Damphousse and Luke Richardson
from Toronto. Vancouver added experience with defensemen Randy Gregg and Dave
Babych.;   (box) GONE: The Edmonton championship machine was further
dismantled as goalie Grant Fuhr was dealt to Toronto, and Charlie Huddy wound
up in L.A. The biggest loss might have occurred in Los Angeles, where the
Kings had to give mobile defenseman Steve Duchesne to Philadelphia in the deal
to get Kurri back from Finland.;   (box) OUTLOOK: The Kings will get the
attention, but the Flames again have the most talent. With veterans such as
Joe Nieuwendyk, Theo Fleury, Al MacInnis and Gary Suter, they have to be
favored. The Oilers have replenished their roster with younger legs. The
Canucks are being built with a solid plan by coach/general manager Pat Quinn,
but barring a spectacular season from Petr Nedved they're still far away.
Winnipeg is due for its every-other-year success, made easier by the addition
of San Jose to the schedule.; Norris Division; (box) LAST SEASON: Chicago (106
points) won a season-long battle with St. Louis (105) to finish with the best
record in hockey, and then was knocked out in the first round by the Minnesota
North Stars, whose fairy tale finish landed them in the Stanley Cup finals.;
(box) NEW FACES: Left wing Brendan Shanahan was signed as a free agent by the
Blues. The Blackhawks picked up free agent left wing John Tonelli. The Red
Wings bulked up with tough guy Troy Crowder and physical players Alan Kerr and
Brian MacLellan. Minnesota acquired center Todd Elik from Los Angeles, and
Toronto obtained Fuhr and wing Glenn Anderson from Edmonton.;   (box) GONE:
The Blues lost defenseman Scott Stevens in the free-agent game. The Hawks
traded unhappy defenseman Doug Wilson to San Jose.;   (box) OUTLOOK: Brett
Hull might chase a 90-goal season, but the loss of Stevens in St. Louis cannot
be overemphasized. He was the captain, and a guy who could grind it out for 30
or 35 minutes. For that reason -- and also on their own merit -- the
Blackhawks should win the division with a balanced and hungry lineup. Detroit
has added enough muscle to become a factor, and Minnesota will prove that last
spring was not a mirage.; WALES CONFERENCE; Patrick Division; (box) LAST
SEASON: The Penguins held together while Lemieux was out with back problems,
and blossomed into a champion upon his return. The Rangers entered the season
with great expectations and fell apart. Washington had its usual problems
scoring; New Jersey did not live up to predictions; Philadelphia missed the
playoffs for the second consecutive season and the Islanders were just awful.;
  (box) NEW FACES: The Flyers made their defense much more mobile with the
acquisition of Duchesne. The Rangers added right wing Tim Kerr, and possibly
two Soviets, and the Islanders could get help if Scott Lachance joins the team
after playing for the United States in the 1992 Olympics.;   (box) GONE: The
Devils lost Brendan Shanahan and Troy Crowder as free agents. The Rangers lost
Ray Sheppard. Washington traded defenseman Mikhail Tatarinov to Quebec.;
(box) OUTLOOK: By matching Boston's offer and retaining Kevin Stevens, the
Penguins are assured of having enough offense to challenge for the top spot.
However, with Scott Stevens, the Devils have put together one of the NHL's top
defensive units. If they had some centers they'd be very tough. The Rangers
could be a factor on the basis of goalie Mike Richter and defenseman Brian
Leetch.; Adams Division; (box) LAST SEASON: Boston used its core of stars to
win the division with 100 points. Montreal Coach Pat Burns coaxed 89 points
out of a team that used 11 rookies. Buffalo was its annual disappointment.
Hartford got its coach fired, and Quebec finished last in the NHL for the
third consecutive season.;   (box) NEW FACES: The Bruins and Whalers changed
coaches, Rick Bowness taking over in Boston and Jimmy Roberts in Hartford. The
Bruins beefed up their defense with Glen Featherstone from St. Louis.;   (box)
GONE: Boston sent left wing Dave Christian to St. Louis. The Caps unloaded
right wing John Kordic.;   (box) OUTLOOK: Somehow the Bruins manage to win.
But the offense will suffer without Kevin Stevens, whom Boston failed to lure
away from Pittsburgh. Another problem for Boston is that Cam Neely could miss
early games with a thigh injury. Still, the only team in the division likely
to challenge them is Montreal, where a healthy Patrick Roy could push them to
the top.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  The Minnesota North Stars' incredible playoff journey is now three-fourths
complete. The Edmonton Oilers' glorious ride as one of hockey's great
dynasties is apparently over.;    Bobby Smith snapped a tie with 15 minutes, 1
second to play as the North Stars beat the defending NHL champion Oilers 3-2
Friday night, giving Minnesota a five-game triumph and a ticket to the Stanley
Cup finals for only the second time in the franchise's 24-year history.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Edmonton's first failure in seven trips to the semifinals guarantees the
first championship series between U.S.-based teams since 1981, when Minnesota
lost to the New York Islanders.;    Pittsburgh leads Boston 3-2 going into
tonight's game in the other semifinal series.;    In the nine finals since
Minnesota's appearance, Edmonton went six times, winning the Stanley Cup in
1984, 1985, 1987, 1988 and 1990.;    But through attrition, trades and
defections, the Oilers have lost superstars such as Wayne Gretzky, Jari Kurri,
Paul Coffey and Andy Moog. The nucleus that remains from their glory years has
dwindled and aged.;     The NHL's 16th-best regular-season team polished off
the top two clubs, Chicago and St. Louis, as well as the defending champions
-- and needed only 17 games to do so.;    The North Stars, who finished 38
points behind Norris Division-leading Chicago with a 27-39-14 record, will be
the first losing regular-season team to play for the title since Vancouver in
1982. Only two teams with losing records have won championships: Toronto in
1949 and Chicago in 1938.;    It was fitting that Smith scored the winner
because he was the star of the North Stars' 1981 team. He is in his first
season back after Minnesota traded him to Montreal in 1983.;    Smith's goal
came just 41 seconds after Mark Messier capped Edmonton's rally from a 2-0
deficit with a goal that brought an otherwise quiet crowd at Northlands
Coliseum to its feet.  </TEXT>

GRETZKY GETS 5 POINTS, KINGS 1;
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: LOS ANGELES SCORES TWICE IN FINAL 1:31 TO CATCH EDMONTON, 5-5. GRETZKY
HAS FOUR ASSISTS AND TYING GOAL.

<P>
As he stood and watched the puck rattle around in the Edmonton Oilers' net
Thursday night, Wayne Gretzky lifted his arms and screamed with joy, looking as
if he were about to raise the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky didn't win a Cup Thursday, just some much-needed confidence and respect
for his Kings with a come-from-behind 5-5 tie against the defending Cup
champions before a Forum crowd of 13,831.
</P>
<P>
After blowing a two-goal lead, and trailing by two with a minute and a half to
play, the Kings scored twice in 42 seconds to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
Tomas Sandstrom scored on a breakaway off a pass from Gretzky with 1:31 to
play.
</P>
<P>
And then Gretzky tied the score with 49 seconds left on his first goal and
fifth point of the night.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky was on the bench when Coach Tom Webster pulled goalie Kelly Hrudey, but
Webster quickly sent Gretzky in.
</P>
<P>
"He went right to the front of the net, where he was supposed to," Webster
said.
</P>
<P>
And there Gretzky camped, until Steve Kasper, on the left side, spotted him
alone at the right post.
</P>
<P>
"I never really get open against them," said Gretzky of his former teammates.
"I had a little time."
</P>
<P>
Edmonton goalie Bill Ranford spotted Gretzky, but a little too late. Gretzky
took the pass from Kasper and shoved the puck home as Ranford dove to the ice.
"I was excited," Gretzky said of his celebration. "It was an important win,
especially the way we came back."
</P>
<P>
Especially since it was the Kings' first game against one of the NHL's big boys
after opening the season against the New York Islanders and Vancouver Canucks,
two of the league's weaker teams.
</P>
<P>
And especially since the Kings had to overcome the ejection of one of their
remaining veteran defensemen, Steve Duchesne, for high sticking and drawing
blood from Craig Simpson, and an Oiler lead that looked insurmountable with
less than two minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
The Kings are 2-1-1, Edmonton 1-0-2.
</P>
<P>
In the first period, Rob Blake, at the top of the left circle, took a pass from
Gretzky on the right side and slid the puck past the stick of Craig MacTavish
and under Ranford's glove to give the Kings a 1-0 lead 9:03 into the game.
</P>
<P>
That was the fifth point of the season for Blake, 20, who had played in only a
dozen NHL games coming into this season.
</P>
<P>
Another power play enabled the Kings to take a 2-0 lead in the second period.
Larry Robinson, coming down the left side, fed Sandstrom in the slot. From
there, Sandstrom, who had four points, scored between Ranford's pads at the
2:29 mark.
</P>
<P>
But, near the middle of the second period, it became a different game.
</P>
<P>
The Oilers turned on the offense that led them to last year's Stanley Cup title
and the Kings fell back to the defense that has left them in the cold all too
often.
</P>
<P>
Before the period had ended, Edmonton scored four times in the following
fashion:
</P>
<P>
 -- Goal No. 1 at 8:07. Petr Klima came face to face with King defenseman Rene
Chapdelaine, but skated around him as Chapdelaine slipped to the ice, then fed
the puck to the unchecked Anatoli Semenov, who shoved it in from the left side.
</P>
<P>
 -- Goal No. 2 at 12:31. MacTavish, unchecked in front of the net, redirected a
shot by Geoff Smith through a helpless Hrudey's pads.
</P>
<P>
 -- Goal No. 3 at 15:25. This time, Semenov was unchecked in the slot. Taking a
centering pass from Esa Tikkanen, Semenov, without a defenseman within reach,
had time to pause and aim before ramming the puck in on Hrudey's stick side
from 20 feet out.
</P>
<P>
 -- Goal No. 4 at 17:44. Ken Linseman skated down the ice with defender Dennis
Smith on his back. But Linseman kept his balance, kept the puck and, despite
Smith's best efforts, flipped it past Hrudey.
</P>
<P>
The Kings had a great opportunity to come back in the final period when Klima
was hit with a five-minute major and automatic game misconduct for ramming the
end of his stick into Brad Jones' stomach.
</P>
<P>
With five penalty minutes to tie up the game, the Kings scored on their first
shot, Gretzky centering a pass for Tony Granato. From the slot, Granato, at the
7:10 mark, scored between Ranford's pads, bringing the Kings to within one goal
at 4-3.
</P>
<P>
But the Kings failed to score again on the extended penalty, missing their only
three shots.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it was the Oilers who scored, getting a short-handed goal at 11:03 on
a backhander by MacTavish to extend the lead to 5-3.
</P>
<P>
King Notes
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government is asking for back taxes on affected members of the
Edmonton Oilers for their rings from the 1987 Stanley Cup finals. That has
drawn outrage from the organization for what is believed to be a test case. If
the government is successful in collecting, assessments could be made on all
Canadians who won Stanley Cup rings over the last five years. The value of the
rings has been set at $3,000. "It seems to me a Stanley Cup ring is as much a
part of the uniform as anything," Edmonton General Manager Glen Sather said.
"What's next," one club official asked, "engagement rings?"
</P>
<P>
King defenseman Marty McSorley practiced with the team Thursday before sitting
out his second game with a twisted knee. He is expected back by Saturday's game
against the Boston Bruins. Fellow defenseman Tim Watters (bruised ribs) and is
not expected back by the weekend.

STANLEY CUP: JARI KURRI HAS HAT TRICK IN 7-2 VICTORY TO BECOME LEADING
POSTSEASON GOAL SCORER. HE ALSO TIES SINGLE-GAME RECORD FOR A FINAL WITH FIVE
POINTS.

<P>
This time, it didn't take six periods.
</P>
<P>
It didn't even take three.
</P>
<P>
The Stanley Cup finals segued from one of its more memorable games to one of
its more forgettable Friday night at Boston Garden as the Edmonton Oilers, led
by Jari Kurri's record-setting hat trick and five points, defeated the Boston
Bruins, 7-2, in Game 2 of the best-of-seven series. Edmonton had won the opener
Tuesday night in triple overtime.
</P>
<P>
Games 3 and 4 will be played Sunday and Tuesday in Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
The Oilers blew Friday's game open with four second-period goals and coasted
through the final 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
While this game may not rate high in NHL history, it has to rate at the top in
the Kurri chronicles.
</P>
<P>
Not only did he score three goals. Not only did his five points tie a Stanley
Cup final mark.
</P>
<P>
But Kurri also broke a tie with former teammate Wayne Gretzky to become the
league's leading postseason goal scorer.
</P>
<P>
And he did it all on his 30th birthday.
</P>
<P>
Kurri's wife, Tiina, had filled his hotel room in the afternoon with so many
balloons that Kurri complained, "I couldn't move."
</P>
<P>
That certainly wasn't his problem Friday night before a sellout crowd of
14,448.
</P>
<P>
Kurri began the night tied with Gretzky at 89 playoff goals each.
</P>
<P>
Then came:
</P>
<P>
 -- No. 90 in the first period. Camped to the right of the net, Kurri
redirected a shot by Esa Tikkanen for a goal to give the Oilers a 2-0 lead
after Adam Graves' earlier score.
</P>
<P>
 -- No. 91 in the second period. It broke a 2-2 tie after goals by Boston's Ray
Bourque and Greg Hawgood. Kurri took a pass from Tikkanen and fired from the
top of the right circle, the puck dribbling through goalie Andy Moog's pads.
</P>
<P>
 -- No. 92 in the final period on a power play long after the issue had been
all but finalized.
</P>
<P>
Kurri, of course, was thrilled.
</P>
<P>
"It is one of those days," he said, "that I'm going to remember the rest of my
life."
</P>
<P>
But he also took time in the packed locker room to praise the man he had
passed.
</P>
<P>
"He's the guy," said Kurri of Gretzky, with whom he played for eight seasons
before Gretzky was traded to the Kings. "When he left, I realized I had to
change. He was the best playmaker in the league.
</P>
<P>
"Gretz did a lot for me. I'm just happy to be up there with those guys. But you
never know with Gretz. Next year, he might pass me."
</P>
<P>
Asked if he and Gretzky had talked about the record, Kurri replied: "He's a
busy man. He's on vacation. I'm a busy man. I'm here. But I'm sure he's happy
for me."
</P>
<P>
Kurri may soon be on vacation as well if this series continues to go as it has.
</P>
<P>
He may have been in the spotlight Friday, but Edmonton goalie Bill Ranford was
again on the spot.
</P>
<P>
Ranford, who played all 115 minutes and 13 seconds in Game 1 and stopped 50 of
52 shots, stopped 25 of 27 Friday, keeping his team in the game when it could
have easily slipped away early.
</P>
<P>
The Oilers were outshot, 10-2, in the first period but scored on each of those
shots.
</P>
<P>
When Kurri broke the 2-2 tie with Edmonton's third goal, it came on the Oilers'
fourth shot.
</P>
<P>
Exit Moog.
</P>
<P>
Enter Boston backup goalie Reggie Lemelin.
</P>
<P>
Exit Bruins.
</P>
<P>
The Oilers scored three more goals -- by Craig Simpson, Tikkanen and Joe Murphy
-- in less than four minutes to all but settle the issue.
</P>
<P>
And that doesn't include a penalty shot missed by Petr Klima. Given an open net
when he faked out Lemelin, Klima fanned on his swing. The shot had been awarded
when Lemelin threw his stick at the puck.
</P>
<P>
"As incredible as Game 1 was," Boston Coach Mike Milbury said, "this one was
equally incredible. For us to look up at the 30-minute mark and be behind was
virtually unthinkable. We dominated every facet of the game with the obvious
exception that Andy wasn't sharp."
</P>
<P>
Kurri took the puck away from defenseman Don Sweeney to set up Edmonton's
fourth goal.
</P>
<P>
"We blew our composure when it was 3-2," Milbury said. "Understandably, our
guys, as much as we tried to settle them down, felt they had to get it back
immediately, and I lost them at that point. We started to make foolish
mistakes, turnovers.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of being a tight-checking team, we became a team that was trying to
create too much, manufacturing plays at the offensive blue line when they
weren't there. We tried to handle the puck far too often and, as a result,
turnovers came about. Edmonton is the best team in the league at capitalizing
on turnovers. We blew our composure."
</P>
<P>
Which gave Kurri the perfect way to blow out his birthday candles.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Cup Notes
</P>
<P>
Jari Kurri became the sixth player to score five points in a Stanley Cup final.
The most recent was Toe Blake for the Montreal Canadiens against the Chicago
Blackhawks in 1944. . . . Boston's Dave Poulin left the game after only 49
seconds, following a hit by Mark Messier, and never returned. Poulin suffered a
mild knee sprain.

IS KONTOS' SUCCESS A CATCH-22?;
</P>
<P>
KINGS' NEW WING MAY BE FORCED TO FLY OFF TO ISLANDERS
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If he is as productive offensively against the Calgary Flames as he was against
the Edmonton Oilers, Chris Kontos of the Kings might just play himself right
off the team.
</P>
<P>
Kontos, 25, could be the player to be named in the trade that sent goaltender
Mark Fitzpatrick and defenseman Wayne McBean to the New York Islanders and
brought goaltender Kelly Hrudey to the Kings.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't thought about that," said Kontos, who signed with the Kings as a
free agent about two weeks after they acquired Hrudey on Feb. 22. "In fact, I
didn't even know about that. Any more good news?"
</P>
<P>
A source in the Kings' organization said Tuesday that, if they are eliminated
from the National Hockey League playoffs by the Flames, the Kings will be
allowed to protect 12 of their players from being chosen by the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
They will be allowed to protect 11 if they beat the Flames, 10 if they reach
the Stanley Cup final and nine if they win the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
General Manager Bill Torrey of the Islanders, who was a guest of owner Bruce
McNall of the Kings for two games during the Kings' division semifinal series
against the Oilers, said he couldn't help but notice the young wing, who scored
eight goals in the series, including an NHL-record six on the power play.
</P>
<P>
"I think he's caught everybody's eye," Torrey said from his office in
Uniondale, N.Y. "Of course, playing with Wayne Gretzky doesn't hurt a guy's
batting average. But he's made the most of his opportunity."
</P>
<P>
Kontos, who was released by the Kings last summer and played in Switzerland
last winter, didn't rejoin the Kings until March 7, but he scored three goals
in Game 2 against the Oilers, the first postseason hat trick by the Kings in 12
years.
</P>
<P>
His second-period goal Tuesday night in the Kings' 4-3 overtime loss was his
fifth in five games.
</P>
<P>
"I'm just having fun helping a club I watched with envy from Switzerland,"
Kontos said. "What better place to play than on a team with Wayne Gretzky?
Somebody must be looking out for me."
</P>
<P>
Among those looking at Kontos is Torrey.
</P>
<P>
The Kings might have won Game 1 Tuesday night if not for an unusual bounce that
led to the game-tying goal by Gary Roberts of the Flames with 1 minute 36
seconds left in regulation.
</P>
<P>
A pass by the Flames' Dana Murzyn circled behind the Kings' net and hit a steel
post, ricocheting out in front, where Roberts cut inside of defenseman Steve
Duchesne of the Kings to chase it down.
</P>
<P>
Duchesne turned the wrong way, expecting the puck to circle all the way around
to the right corner.
</P>
<P>
"I was lucky enough to have the inside on (Duchesne)," Roberts said. "He kind
of turned to the right and I turned to the left and it came back out.
</P>
<P>
"It was a bad bounce for them."
</P>
<P>
And a lucky bounce for Roberts, who skated in and fired a shot that glanced off
the hip of goaltender Kelly Hrudey and into the net, sending the game into
overtime. A goal by Doug Gilmour at 7:47 of the extra period gave the Flames a
4-3 victory and left the Kings shaking their heads.
</P>
<P>
"I turned my head and the puck came behind me," Duchesne said. "It happened so
quickly that I didn't have time to hook him or anything.
</P>
<P>
"It was bad luck."
</P>
<P>
Tickets to Flames' games are hot in Calgary.
</P>
<P>
In fact, ads have appeared in local newspapers offering the right to buy season
tickets for $10,000 a ticket.
</P>
<P>
That would enable the buyer to avoid a waiting list for season subscriptions
that includes more than 5,000 names.
</P>
<P>
Clare Rhyasen, vice president of business and finance for the Flames, told the
Toronto Star that, according to the club's legal interpretation of Alberta's
Amusements Act, it is not illegal to sell the right to buy season tickets.
</P>
<P>
"People aren't selling the tickets, they're selling the rights," Rhyasen told
the Star.
</P>
<P>
Most of the time, tickets aren't available.
</P>
<P>
From their first game in Calgary, a 5-5 tie against the Quebec Nordiques Oct.
9, 1980, through a 5-5 tie against the Edmonton Oilers Nov. 5, 1987, the former
Atlanta Flames sold out 323 consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
But when capacity at the Olympic Saddledome was increased last year for the
Winter Olympics, the Flames held 2,800 upper-level seats a game to be sold on a
per-game basis, and the sellout string ended.
</P>
<P>
The extra tickets are put on sale the day before each game.
</P>
<P>
Still, the Flames have sold out 27 of 45 home games this season, and their
smallest crowd of the year was 17,784.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night's game drew a capacity crowd.

<LEADPARA>  ANYONE who ever met Bob Johnson felt the loss when brain cancer claimed his
life last week.;   Hockey lost one of its greatest ambassadors when Johnson
died. And the world lost a genuinely good man.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  JOHNSON WAS A GREAT AMBASSADOR FOR HOCKEY  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Some information in this report was obtained from writers in other cities.;
Hockey Report  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Johnson, who coached the Pittsburgh Penguins to the Stanley Cup
championship last season, always had time to talk. Especially if the subject
was hockey.;   "He had an incredible love for the game," said Sharks winger
Brian Mullen, who played for Johnson at the University of Wisconsin in the
early 1980s and was a part of the Team USA squad that Johnson prepared for the
Canada Cup tournament this fall. "He did a lot for hockey in the United
States, and he made everything fun. He just had that kind of a personality.";
 Johnson, who has been replaced on the Pittsburgh bench by Scotty Bowman, put
his personality on display in Santa Rosa last summer, when he played in an
old-timers tournament. And he made the experience fun for all who came into
contact with him.;   "It's a great day for hockey," Johnson would say. And he
always made you believe it.;   "The thing that I'll always remember about Bob
is that he was always so positive," said Sharks General Manager Jack Ferreira,
who worked with Johnson in Calgary after Johnson left Wisconsin to become the
coach of the Flames in 1982. "I remember times when the team would lose 7-1 or
8-1 and he would find three things that the players did right and focus on
those things. His love for the game was infectious, and he always made your
day.";   Even at the end, Johnson, who coached Mullen's brother, Joey, in
Pittsburgh, was immersed in the game. Although brain surgery had left him
unable to hold a conversation, he constantly sent notes and faxes to the
Penguins to outline strategies or help motivate the players.;   "I think it
was fitting that he was able to win the Stanley Cup," Ferreira said. "I know
that was the one thing that had always eluded him.";   The sad thing is that
he didn't get to enjoy it longer.; REALIGNMENT TALK: The Winnipeg Jets are
expected to push hard for realignment during the regular NHL Board of
Governors winter meetings this week in Florida.;   The Jets want to get out of
the Smythe Division and return to the Norris, where they played during the
1981-82 season. The move would put them in a division with teams in their own
time zone and would cut travel costs associated with being in a division with
Vancouver, Los Angeles, Calgary, Edmonton and the Sharks.;   "I think it's
really important for our franchise to play other teams in the Central time
zone," Jets President Barry Shenkarow has said.;   Shenkarow says the Jets
left the Norris Division with the understanding that they could return when
the league added another western franchise. And Shenkarow figures that
happened when the Sharks joined the league for this season.;   "We've paid our
dues," Shenkarow said.; AROUND THE NHL: The New York Rangers reportedly have
agreed to contract terms with center Mark Messier, who was obtained in a trade
with the Edmonton Oilers early this season. The deal reportedly will pay
Messier at least $13 million over five seasons, which would make him the
second-highest-paid player in the league, behind L.A. center Wayne Gretzky. .
. . Gretzky and Kings owner Bruce McNall scored a nice daily double last
weekend, when the Toronto Argonauts won the Canadian Football League
championship and Golden Pheasant won the $2.77 million Japan Cup horse race.
Gretzky and McNall share in the ownership of each. . . . The Oilers would like
to trade left wing Petr Klima, and representatives of the Toronto Maple Leafs

Gilmour. . . . Toronto Maple Leafs rookies Rob Pearson and Alexander Godynyuk
recently got a taste of hazing, NHL style, when their heads were shaved by
teammates. "I really feel I'm part of the team now," Pearson said. "The barber
added a few streaks to my hair. It doesn't look too bad."; SHARK BITES: Sharks

played in more NHL games this season (26) than the other 21 first-round picks

   The Edmonton Oilers defeated the Boston Bruins 4-1
on Thursday night, winning the National Hockey League championship
and their fifth Stanley Cup in seven years.
   The Oilers won four of five championship games, including all
three games in a compact Boston rink that was supposed to cramp
their flashy style.
   Edmonton won on goaltending by Bill Ranford, high-speed scoring
by Glenn Anderson and Craig Simpson and dazzling passing. The
slower Bruins were never able to catch up.
   It was another night of frustration for Boston's big guns. Cam
Neely, who had 55 regular-season goals, finished the series with no
goals and four assists.
   The Oilers, whose last Cup came in a 1988 sweep of the Bruins,
became the fifth team to win it five times.
   It was their first Cup without star center Wayne Gretzky, who
was traded to Los Angeles in 1988.
   The Oilers won the Cup in 1984, 1985, 1987 and 1988. With
Montreal winning in 1986 and Calgary in 1989, Canadian teams have
won seven consecutive Cups.
   Ranford won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoff's most
valuable player.

KINGS LIMP INTO CALGARY, LEAVE GRETZKY BEHIND
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With the injured Wayne Gretzky a doubtful participant, the battered Kings open
the NHL Smythe Division playoffs Wednesday night against the defending Stanley
Cup champion Calgary Flames.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, sidelined after absorbing a hard check from Alan Kerr of the New York
Islanders on March 22, is one of six injured Kings. That's hardly encouraging
considering the Kings' 8-4 loss to the Flames in the season finale Sunday night
and a healthy Los Angeles team's playoff loss to Calgary last season in four
straight games.
</P>
<P>
"At this point, we do not expect to have Gretzky back in the lineup on
Wednesday," Coach Tom Webster said Monday before the Kings -- without Gretzky
-- left for Banff, Alberta, to prepare for the first-round series.
</P>
<P>
"I've no idea when Wayne will return," Webster said. "We just have to take it
day by day."
</P>
<P>
Team officials say Gretzky, who won his eighth NHL scoring title this season,
has spasms and a hyperextension of the back. But they haven't ruled out the
possibility, however remote, that he may play Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
"Wayne continues to be treated in Los Angeles, and remains on a day-to-day
basis," team physician Dr. Steve Lombardo said.
</P>
<P>
The other injured Kings are forwards John Tonelli, Dave Taylor and Steve Kasper
and defensemen Larry Robinson and Tom Laidlaw. All missed Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
"We do expect to have Robinson back, hopefully Tonelli and Kasper, too," said
Webster, himself recovering from an inner ear operation. "But both Tom Laidlaw
and Wayne Gretzky are big question marks."
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, who likened the Kerr check to being rear-ended in an auto accident,
had 40 goals and 142 points this season. Those were the worst numbers he has
posted since getting 137 points as a rookie in 1979-80.
</P>
<P>
His absence would be a severe blow to the fourth-place Kings, whose 75 points
this season surpassed only the Islanders' 73 among the NHL's 16 playoff teams.
</P>
<P>
"Gretzky is the best player in the world," Kings goaltender Mario Gosselin
said. "With him in the lineup, it changes the way the other team plays against
you."
</P>
<P>
Despite the injury, some of the Flames wonder if the questions concerning
Gretzky might be a ploy to throw them off their game.
</P>
<P>
"It could be," forward Theoren Fleury said. "The only guys that know are the
Kings. We can't be worried if he's going to be playing or not. We have to focus
on us and how well we're going to play."
</P>
<P>
The first-place Flames, whose 99 points are second-best in the league, will
host the first two games of the best-of-seven series. After Friday night's
second game at the Olympic Saddledome, the series shifts to Inglewood, where
games three and four will be played Sunday and next Tuesday. The teams would
alternate sites for games six through seven, as needed.
</P>
<P>
That rotation also would hold for the other Campbell Conference series.
</P>
<P>
In the other Smythe Division series, Winnipeg opens at Edmonton, where Gretzky
led the Oilers to four Stanley Cups in 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In the Norris Division, regular-season champion Chicago is host to Minnesota
and Toronto visits St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
The Wales Conference playoffs start Thursday night, with the second game in
each series set for Saturday. Games three and four would be Monday and next
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Boston Bruins, whose 101 points led the league, are at home against
Hartford to open the first round in the Adams Division. Montreal, a loser to
Calgary in the Stanley Cup final last year, opens at Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
In the Patrick Division, the Islanders open at the New York Rangers.

GRETZKY IS ON ROAD TO EVERYWHERE;
</P>
<P>
KINGS' STAR STILL FACING SPLIT-LOYALTY SCENES IN EDMONTON
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Since last he skated for the Kings, Wayne Gretzky has been to Europe, where he
invested in a horse; to New York, where he was host of "Saturday Night Live;"
to Toronto, where he was honored as the most valuable player in the National
Hockey League; to Las Vegas, where he attended the Victor Awards; home to
Ontario, for his charity softball game; back to Los Angeles, where he played
host to a couple of vacationing Edmonton Oilers; to Victoria, Canada, for
another charity appearance, and back to Los Angeles where, Friday, he started
his day as a KIIS-FM guest disc jockey alongside Rick Dees.
</P>
<P>
From there, it was on to the Forum to talk with a small group of reporters
about last summer's trade from the Oilers to the Kings, a trade that ranks
among the biggest in the history of sport and is still being felt -- throughout
the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky calls it a trade that "definitely helped hockey."
</P>
<P>
It definitely helped hockey in Los Angeles. But it didn't do much for Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Edmonton would have traded me to L.A. if they had thought I
would come back to haunt them," Gretzky said Friday. "In that, I think I was
underestimated as a hockey player. They didn't think L.A. could compete the way
we did."
</P>
<P>
Gretzky remembers the weeks before the trade as "an emotional time . . . a hard
time . . . a fun time."
</P>
<P>
And it led into an emotional, hard, fun hockey season.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky is hoping that this season will be a little easier, with less emphasis
on his change of allegiance.
</P>
<P>
But before he skates for the Kings again, he has another of those emotional
scenes to face in Edmonton where, on Aug. 27, he will attend the unveiling of a
bronze statue of himself outside the Northlands Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
It's a statue of Gretzky in an Edmonton Oiler uniform holding the Stanley Cup
over his head.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky struggles with these split-loyalty scenes.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, he said that the exhibition game in Edmonton Sept. 22 might be one
that he sits out.
</P>
<P>
According to NHL rules, players can appear in only eight exhibitions and the
Kings have 11. That means the fans in three cities are going to be sorely
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
The trade has had a profound effect on the Kings' training camp and exhibition
schedule. According to King Vice President Roy Mlakar, camp and the exhibition
season used to cost the Kings more than $250,000. Now, they will make almost $1
million.
</P>
<P>
"I spent the months of January and February entertaining offers from promoters
throughout North America who wanted a game," Mlakar said. "It's big business
now. I tried to put the games in big buildings. In Milwaukee, they have already
sold 17,000 tickets at an average price of $20. . . . The promoter in Cleveland
has already sold 10,000 tickets at an average price of $25. We anticipate a
sellout in Denver.
</P>
<P>
"I won't be surprised if we sell out every game."
</P>
<P>
It also will be no surprise if the Kings open the regular season with a string
of sellouts.
</P>
<P>
At some point early in the season, Gretzky will break the all-time scoring
record set by his longtime idol, Gordie Howe, who scored 1,850 points. Gretzky
is only 14 points away from that.
</P>
<P>
The record will mean that the focus will stay on Gretzky for a while, even
though he's hoping for a little break sometime soon.
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was going to be a hectic, tough year last year because it was a new
thing for everybody," Gretzky said. " . . . Obviously it will be a lot easier
for me this year. It's not as new. The excitement will have died down a lot."
</P>
<P>
But the excitement over the scoring record?
</P>
<P>
"That's the fun part of the game," Gretzky said.
</P>
<P>
King Notes
</P>
<P>
Goalie Glenn Healy, a free agent with compensation, is not likely to be back
with the Kings next season. He is expected to sign with another team, possibly
the New Jersey Devils, early next week. . . . John Tonelli, the only other King
whose contract is still unsettled, is expected to reach an agreement with the
team soon.

MIKE DOWNEY: NICE ON ICE WON'T CUT IT HERE

OK, King family: We won't suggest anything too outrageous here. We don't want
any drastic line changes, Wayne Gretzky benched in favor of Mike Allison or
anything like that. We shouldn't get too worked up about one lousy loss. And we
definitely wouldn't advocate that you start playing, uh, dirty hockey. Don't go
around shish kebabing anybody with your sticks.
</P>
<P>
But, to beat the Edmonton Oilers, you might have to beat them up. Check 'em,
deck 'em and wreck 'em. Otherwise, these oily little rascals are just too
slick. Unless you smack them around and slow them down, the Oilers will leave
your defensemen as frozen in their tracks as the Gretzky statue that guards the
door of the Northlands Coliseum, and they will leave your goaltender flopping
on his belly like a seal.
</P>
<P>
Right from Wednesday night's opening faceoff of the Smythe Division finals, the
Oilers demonstrated their superior quickness and stickness. Glenn Anderson put
a move on King goalie Kelly Hrudey the likes of which hasn't been seen in
Alberta since Katarina Witt slipped into her lace teddy. He scored. Five
minutes later, Jari Kurri did a dipsy-do that left Hrudey sprawling flat on
his, uh, mask. Another score.
</P>
<P>
Came the next two periods and more of the same. Mark Messier slapped one.
Score. Martin Gelinas flipped one over the goalie's glove. Score. Esa Tikkanen
bluffed a slap shot and faked Hrudey into the organist's private box. Score.
Joe Murphy made Hrudey go into a dive like the "Red October." Score. Tikkanen
tikked another one in. Score. Game 1 turned into an Edmonton avalanche, 7-0.
</P>
<P>
Talk about losing ugly.
</P>
<P>
Maybe for the Kings it was just one of those nights when the only thing that
goes right is that your suspenders don't snap.
</P>
<P>
Or maybe, just maybe, this was a classic case of a bunch of guys taking too
much time off for good behavior. Maybe the time has come for the Kings to turn
back into the Manchester Blvd. Bullies, same way they did when they pounded
lumps on Edmonton's helmets last time they met.
</P>
<P>
When the King-Oiler rumble turned gruesome at the Forum on the final night of
February, everybody made note of the 86 penalties and 356 penalty minutes that
made this game the nastiest confrontation in the Los Angeles area since the
last time Roseanne Barr's writers had a staff meeting. Oh, the fuss that was
made over Marty McSorley, the mutant ninja hockey player, doing his level best
to mess up Messier's face.
</P>
<P>
Forgotten in all the commotion was that the Kings won that particular game,
4-2. And face it, they don't ordinarily have much luck against Edmonton,
regardless of how that 1989 playoff series turned out. The Oilers played the
Kings eight times this season, and lost to them only twice. Edmonton has had
L.A.'s number, and we don't mean 99.
</P>
<P>
If Wednesday's game is any indication of how this series is going to go, may we
humbly suggest that when the Oilers take the ice here Friday night, the Kings
go right out and crown them.
</P>
<P>
Hey, we were just sort of getting comfortable with the notion of L.A. as a
tough hockey town. These were becoming the all-new, leaner, meaner Kings, bad
boys dressed in black. Nobody was accusing them of turning into the
Philadelphia Flyers, but 356 penalty minutes -- man, that's not hockey, that's
mud-wrestling. That's some dirty stuff.
</P>
<P>
And the Kings haven't been making many friends lately, either. Some of them
were offended by former teammate Bernie Nicholls' alleged comment that the only
thing the Kings know about defense is how not to play it. There was also some
fuss made over Theron Fleury of Calgary supposedly hurling his stick at Gretzky
and calling him "the most hated player in the league," and Flame Paul Ranheim
accusing Gretzky of waving his arms and laughing right in the Flames' faces.
</P>
<P>
It was kind of nice having people bad-mouthing the Kings for a change. In the
past, people hardly mentioned them at all.
</P>
<P>
Sadly, though, the Kings who laced up their skates for Game 1 against Edmonton
were about as inoffensive as a hockey team gets. We can scarcely remember a
hard check into the boards, much less a punch in the snoot. Oh, McSorley gave
Kevin Lowe a little love bump as the first period was ending, and later on Lowe
and Steve Duchesne demonstrated surgical techniques to each other's eyebrows
with their sticks. Otherwise, the Kings played like perfect gentlemen.
</P>
<P>
And came away with a big fat zero.
</P>
<P>
OK, Kings: You tried the polite bit. You tried to be nice, pleasant guests. You
probably wiped your feet before stepping into the arena. It didn't work. The
Oilers still have to beat you three more times. Beat them to the punch.

STRUGGLING OILERS OPEN AGAINST JETS

<P>
A year ago, after winning four Stanley Cups in five seasons, the Edmonton
Oilers had to learn to live without Wayne Gretzky, who led them to the titles.
</P>
<P>
They did all right in the regular season, but when they faced Gretzky and the
Kings, they were knocked out in the first round.
</P>
<P>
Until about a month ago, the Oilers, although they played much of the season
without goaltender Grant Fuhr, one of the best, appeared to be a legitimate
contender for the Cup again.
</P>
<P>
As they open the NHL playoffs tonight at Edmonton against the Winnipeg Jets in
the first of the best-of-seven series, the Oilers are again without Fuhr and
are below their February peak. Fuhr reinjured his shoulder Friday and may not
be available for the opener.
</P>
<P>
And backup netminder Billy Ranford, who played well in the middle of the
season, has tailed off.
</P>
<P>
However, they figure to get to the division final against either the Kings or
the defending champion Calgary Flames because the Jets are not accustomed to
winning playoff games, especially against the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
The Jets were one of only five teams who did not make the playoffs last spring.
They have qualified for postseason play seven times, but have won only two
series.
</P>
<P>
Usually they wind up playing the Oilers. In 19 playoff games against Edmonton,
the Jets have won only once.
</P>
<P>
First-year coach Bob Murdoch, a longtime defenseman for the Kings, has done a
remarkable job with the Jets. But they lost all four games at Edmonton this
season.
</P>
<P>
The other games tonight involve the Norris Division teams. The Chicago
Blackhawks, who won the division, open at home against Minnesota and Toronto
plays at St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks and North Stars figure on a brawling series. They had
free-for-alls in several games this season. The Maple Leafs finished below the
Blues, but hammered them, 7-1, during the season.
</P>
<P>
The Boston Bruins, the lukewarm favorite to win it all after being the only
team to earn 100 points, play Thursday night at home against Hartford. The
Whalers have a 2-1-1 record at Boston.
</P>
<P>
In other openers Thursday, the Rangers and Islanders play in New York, New
Jersey faces Washington and Montreal meets Buffalo. DAN HAFNER

   Hockey superstar Wayne Gretzky has more than his
share of titles, but ``Canada's most eligible bachelor'' won't be
among them after today.
   Canadians have been treating Gretzky's marriage to American
actress Janet Jones as their version of a royal wedding, with the
ceremony, the gifts, the ring and even the bride's background
coming under intense scrutiny.
   The 27-year-old Edmonton Oilers star is regarded as a national
treasure, a Mr. Clean who acts as ambassador-without-portfolio for
the sport he loves. He makes an estimated $2.5 million annually.
   Given his squeaky clean stature, it's not surprising his
Edmonton marriage to an actress from Missouri who posed for the
March 1987 issue of Playboy magazine has set the nation abuzz.
   ``What I can't figure out is why he chose to marry a Playboy
bunny when he could have the pick of the crop,'' complained one
letter to the Edmonton Sun.
   But wedding guest Gordie Howe, a hockey hall of famer, described
the bride as ``OK, if you like them young and beautiful,'' and the
Toronto Star heralded ``the royal wedding of a Canadian prince and
his starlet lady.''
   Canadians have learned all about Miss Jones' former flings with
tennis pro Vitas Gerulaitis and actor Bruce Willis, while Gretzky's
former girlfriend, Vickie Moss, was tracked down in Los Angeles for
comment.
   Rumors got so out of hand that Gretzky intervened to assure
reporters he did not pay more than $200,000 for Miss Jones'
three-carat wedding ring; honeymoon plans do not include Lear jets
and private yachts; and guests will drink Canadian champagne, not
Dom Perignon.
   ``We want it to be as first-class as possible, but it is not a
million-dollar wedding like everyone says. We're from sensible
families,'' said Gretzky, who didn't deny buying his bride a
$207,500 Rolls Royce as a wedding gift.
   Miss Jones, 27, is from Bridgeton, Mo., and has appeared in the
films ``American Anthem,'' ``The Flamingo Kid,'' ``A Chorus Line''
and ``Police Academy 5.''
   To accommodate the 700 guests, the Roman Catholic Church waived
its rules to permit the Anglican groom and Methodist bride to wed
in St. Joseph's Basilica, the city's largest church.
   Miss Jones flew in from Los Angeles with her $40,000 wedding
gown. Her sister, Jeannette, is her maid of honor, while former
Edmonton Oiler goalie Ed Mio is best man.
   The couple met in 1982 when Gretzky was a guest on the TV disco
show, Dance Fever, where Miss Jones was a dancer.
   Gretzky began rewriting the record books after entering the
National Hockey League in 1979.
   Until an injury sidelined him part of last season, he won eight
straight Hart Trophies as the league's most valuable player and was
its leading scorer seven times. With Gretzky back for the playoffs,
the Oilers won their fourth Stanley Cup championship in five years.

MIKE DOWNEY: FLAMES MAKE FOR HOT TIME AT THE FORUM
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Downey

<TEXT>
<P>
Here they come, the Calgary Flames, now appearing at a hockey rink near you.
Fasten your safety belts, it's going to be a bumpy couple of nights.
</P>
<P>
From Canada they have flown, to continue their revolution against the Kings.
The Flames want this Stanley Cup badly. The last time anybody in Calgary won
anything, it had something to do with tying a rope around three legs of a calf.
</P>
<P>
The Kings must now win four of the next five, starting tonight, to overtake the
Flames in these playoffs. Obviously they can do it, so long as they still have
Wayne Gretzky. Where there's Wayne, there's a way.
</P>
<P>
They also still have goalie Kelly Hrudey, who has never been bested at home as
a King. And they still have Bernie Nicholls, which is remarkable in itself. The
way he assaulted Calgary goalie Mike Vernon in Game 2, Nicholls is lucky he
wasn't suspended by the league, or arrested by a Mountie.
</P>
<P>
As for the Flames, since they had the best record in the National Hockey League
this season, they need no introduction.
</P>
<P>
Like hell they don't.
</P>
<P>
There's Lanny McDonald, who had to buy two airplane tickets -- one for himself,
and one for his mustache. Lanny shouldn't trim that hedge, he should water it.
Any more hair on this person's face and he is going to resemble the Addams
Family's Cousin It.
</P>
<P>
There's also Theoren Fleury, the Spud Webb of hockey, who saved the club a
considerable amount of money by giving his seat to McDonald's mustache and
sleeping in the overhead luggage compartment.
</P>
<P>
And then there's Joey Mullen, the highest-scoring American-born player in NHL
history, who was reared in New York City's Hell's Kitchen and is accustomed to
witnessing behavior such as Bernie Nicholls'.
</P>
<P>
And we mustn't forget Mike Vernon, who was minding his own business on the
flight to Los Angeles, having a drink, when suddenly Robbie Ftorek summoned a
stewardess and forced her to measure Vernon's swizzle stick.
</P>
<P>
The Flames have the Kings pretty rattled for the time being, having whipped
them nine straight times on their home ice. They have only lost five games at
the Saddledome all season. No wonder Ftorek demanded that Vernon's stick be
measured Thursday night; we're surprised the King coach didn't ask an
electrician to make sure the red light behind Vernon hadn't blown a fuse.
</P>
<P>
Home-ice advantage is a reality at Calgary, where even the trainer is permitted
to skate onto the ice anytime he feels like it. While tending to the fallen
Vernon, this Jim (Bearcat) Murray person probably could have stopped a couple
of shots with his first-aid kit and gotten away with it, the way things work at
Calgary.
</P>
<P>
The Flames have a real surprise in store for them tonight when, just at a key
moment, sports columnist Jim (Bare Facts) Murray of The Times rushes to
Hrudey's side and distracts the Flames while Los Angeles is scoring a goal.
Fair is fair.
</P>
<P>
Something definitely needs be done if the Kings intend to prolong this series.
We remain divided between patting their backs over that valiant comeback
against Edmonton to reminding ourselves that Edmonton was a third-place team in
its own division. Calgary, after all, is the class of the league. It has four
solid lines and an All-Star goaltender. Its Stanley Cup probably runneth over.
</P>
<P>
The Kings, on the other hand, have a melting pot of ex-Oilers, ex-Flames,
ex-Islanders, ex-Bruins, ex-Rangers, ex-etceteras who somehow have blended
together to play above their visible capabilities. King linemates change
partners more often than couples at a square dance. King defensemen are thin in
talent and number, although Ftorek finally saw fit Thursday to give Doug
Crossman some ice time and might put Ken Baumgartner back to work tonight.
</P>
<P>
Several key players have to snap out of slumps if the Kings are to have a
chance. Luc Robitaille, who hasn't been himself since the All-Star break, made
a devastating error that contributed to Thursday night's defeat. Mike
Krushelnyski is way overdue to have a decent game. So is Dean Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
We hope each and every King is feeling aces-high for tonight's Game 3, because
if they aren't, there might not be a Game 5.
</P>
<P>
We know they will be out there trying.
</P>
<P>
We know if anybody in a red uniform goes anywhere near Gretzky, sorehead Marty
McSorley will be there to do something about it. When Gretzky gets a bad
haircut, McSorley probably goes out and beats up his barber.
</P>
<P>
We also know that owner Bruce McNall is so superstitious, he won't permit his
wife to attend tonight's game (the Kings lost the last time she was there),
won't permit the singing of our usual national anthem (the Kings haven't lost
since using "America the Beautiful" instead) and won't permit the opening
faceoff to be dropped until that dude with the lucky gluteus maximus drags his
icy tush out there.
</P>
<P>
Hey, a team's gotta do what a team's gotta do.

<P>
Wayne Gretzky was nervous before the National Hockey League All-Star game
Tuesday night. It was his ninth All-Star game, but it was special. Not like
those games of the past, the games he played for fun.
</P>
<P>
This game was being played in the Northlands Coliseum, on the ice that was his
during 10 years with the Edmonton Oilers. This game was being played before a
sellout crowd of 17,503 that rocked the building with a stirring ovation when
he was introduced.
</P>
<P>
This game gave him a rare chance to play on the same line again with his old
Oiler teammate Jari Kurri. With Oiler goalie Grant Fuhr in the net. With Oiler
defenseman Kevin Lowe on the team. With Oiler Coach Glen Sather behind the
bench.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky really wanted to win this game.
</P>
<P>
So he did. He charged the Campbell Conference team with the same kind of spark
he has used to jolt the Kings to life this season.
</P>
<P>
Just like old times, he and Kurri raced down the ice to combine for a goal with
a little over a minute played in the game. And the Campbell Conference was on
its way to a 9-5 victory over the Wales Conference.
</P>
<P>
The crowd went wild when Gretzky skated up the right side and slid the puck
across to Kurri on the left side, and Kurri put the puck in behind goalie Sean
Burke of the New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky scored the second goal himself at 4:33, picking up the puck that fellow
King Steve Duchesne had floated in front of the goal for him. Gretzky put his
stick down to stop the puck in his path to the left of the goal, then quickly
scooped it around to the right of Burke.
</P>
<P>
There was no mistaking the pure joy Gretzky felt at pleasing this crowd again.
</P>
<P>
And when he was named most valuable player of the game, he was moved. It had
not been an automatic choice. As Gretzky pointed out: "No one player dominated
the game."
</P>
<P>
Gretzky had a goal and two assists. Joe Mullen of Calgary had two goals and an
assist. Jimmy Carson of the Oilers had a goal and an assist. Mark Messier of
the Oilers had a goal and an assist. Luc Robitaille of the Kings had a goal and
an assist. Kurri had a goal and an assist. Gary Leeman of Toronto had a goal
and an assist. Duchesne had two assists.
</P>
<P>
For the Wales Conference, Walt Poddubny had two goals.
</P>
<P>
Mario Lemieux, the NHL's leading scorer and the man who stole this show a year
ago with six points for the Wales Conference, had just one assist and really
wasn't a factor.
</P>
<P>
Maybe he will be next year, when the game is played on his home ice at
Pittsburgh. This night belonged to Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky figures that having the crowd behind him was worth a couple of votes,
at least, for the MVP honor.
</P>
<P>
"I had a great time tonight," he said. "I don't think I stopped smiling all
night."
</P>
<P>
Explaining that it felt just like old times, he said: "I don't think it really
hit me that I'd been traded until after the first period tonight."
</P>
<P>
Yes, he admitted, he said that with a touch of longing.
</P>
<P>
"I've never denied that I miss Edmonton," Gretzky said. "I've never denied that
I miss my teammates. I won't ever deny that. We won four championships in five
years. We grew up from being a bunch of kids to being the best in the league. I
miss them a lot.
</P>
<P>
"But I'm in a situation now with an owner (Bruce McNall) who is just
outstanding, and I'm with a fine organization. Maybe we can build something
there. I'd like to do that for him.
</P>
<P>
"It would have been easy to sit back here, maybe even win another two or three
Stanley Cups. But I'm also enjoying the pressure and the challenge that I have
now."
</P>
<P>
On this night, though, he relived some of the old glory and allowed himself to
show the emotion he feels for the players he misses.
</P>
<P>
"Ten or 20 years from now, when I look back on my career, there will be times
that stand out," Gretzky said. "The first time that I was back here with the
Kings is a time I'll always remember. Tonight will be extra special. . . . I
think I'll go home and watch the tape."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the Campbell Conference's locker room, there were a lot of other
guys who didn't stop smiling all night.
</P>
<P>
Sather was, of course, very pleased to coach his first All-Star victory. He was
0-4 before Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Duchesne was happy for Gretzky and thrilled with the victory.
</P>
<P>
"Ecstatic," said the French-Canadian defenseman. "I'm ecstatic. Ecstatic.
That's a new word I learned today. That means very, very happy. That's what I
am. Ecstatic. I learned it from watching TV today. I'm ecstatic and everyone in
this room is ecstatic."
</P>
<P>
Getting a little more specific, Duchesne said that he was ecstatic to get the
assist on Gretzky's goal.
</P>
<P>
The game wasn't wrapped up at that point, though. The Wales Conference tied it
on goals by Cam Neely of Boston and Poddubny of Quebec before the end of the
first period.
</P>
<P>
Then the Wales Conference went up, 3-2, just 1:16 into the second period on a
goal by Glen Wesley of Boston. But the Campbell Conference scored three
straight for a 5-3 lead at the end of the second period.
</P>
<P>
It was 3-3 when both teams changed goalies at the game's midpoint (Rejean
Lemelin of Boston relieving Burke and Mike Vernon of Calgary relieving Fuhr),
and then Steve Yzerman of Detroit and Leeman scored just 14 seconds apart.
</P>
<P>
Poddubny scored his second goal of the night early in the third period to cut
the lead to 5-4, and Mullen answered with his second to make it 6-4. Then Mike
Ridley of Washington scored the last goal for the Wales Conference before
Robitaille, Carson and Messier ran up the score.
</P>
<P>
NHL All-Star Notes
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky said that he would give the car he won for being named most
valuable player of the game to a former Oiler teammate, Dave Semenko. "I think
the car should stay here in Edmonton," he said. "Dave was one of the guys who
really helped me in my career." . . . With his goal in the first period,
Gretzky tied Gordie Howe's All-Star career record of 10 goals. Howe scored his
10 in 23 games. Gretzky has scored 10 in nine games. . . . The Campbell
Conference's nine goals tied the All-Star record for most goals by one team in
a game, set by the Campbell Conference in a 9-3 victory in 1983. And the 14
goals set a record for most goals by both teams, breaking the record of 13 set
in the Wales Conference's 7-6 victory in 1984.
</P>
<P>
The Edmonton Oilers announced Tuesday night that they have acquired right
winger Dave Brown from the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for center Keith
Acton and a future draft pick. Brown, 26, has played all five years with the
Flyers. He has three assists and 100 penalty minutes in 50 games this season.

<MEMO>  NHL Playoffs  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  Division: Norris.; Records -- The Blackhawks had the best record in the NHL,
finishing 49-23-8. The North Stars were fourth in the Norris Division at
27-39-14.;  Chicago update -- Forwards Steve Larmer and Jeremy Roenick
combined for 85 goals and 110 assists, and rookie goalie Ed Belfour led the
league in victories (43), goals-against average (2.47) and save percentage
(.910). By finishing with the league's best record, the Hawks earned the
home-ice advantage throughout the playoffs. Chris Chelios, acquired in an
off-season trade for center Denis Savard, has tightened up the defense.;
Minnesota update -- The North Stars fired off a warning shot when they beat
the Hawks 2-1 Saturday. Despite losing five of their final six games, the
Stars were one of the league's better teams in the second half of the season.
Dave Gagner had 40 goals and 42 assists to lead the Stars offensively, and
goalie Jon Casey posted a 2.98 goals-against average.; Key to the series --
Belfour's stamina. He already has played in 74 games. As long as fatigue
doesn't become a factor, the Hawks should advance.;  ST. LOUIS VS. DETROIT;
Division: Norris.; Records -- The Blues were second in the division at
47-22-11. The Red Wings were third at 34-38-8.; St. Louis update -- Brett Hull
scored a league-high 86 goals, the third-highest total in NHL history, and
Adam Oates had 90 assists. Hull led the league in power-play goals (29) and
game-winning goals (11), and goalie Vincent Riendeau, who won his last six
starts, ranked fourth in the league in victories with 29.; Detroit update --
Steve Yzerman scored 51 goals to become the first Red Wings player to score 50
or more in four consecutive seasons. But the defense and goaltending are
question marks. The Wings allowed 298 goals, which was the fifth-worst total
in the league. Rookie forward Sergei Fedorov, who defected from the Soviet
national team before last summer's Goodwill Games, was impressive at times but
faded down the stretch.; Key to the series -- For the Red Wings to have a
chance, Yzerman must have a super series and the defense must find a way to
stop Hull and Oates.;  head,23p6,14,neb Los Angeles vs. Vancouver; Division:
Smythe.; Records -- The Kings finished atop the division at 46-24-10. The
Canucks were fourth at 28-43-9.;  Los Angeles update -- Wayne Gretzky and his
pals combined to score 340 goals. More important is the fact that the Kings
have learned to play defense. They limited opponents to 254 goals, the
fourth-best mark in the league and an 83-goal improvement from last season.;
Vancouver update -- The Canucks benefited from a late-season trade in which
they acquired Geoff Courtnall and Sergio Momesso from St. Louis, but they are
clearly overmatched in this series. The Canucks ranked 20th in the 21-team
league in power play efficiency this season and were 19th in penalty killing.;
Key to the series -- The Kings simply have to guard against being
overconfident. If they play to their potential, the series will be a short
one.;  head,23p6,14,neb Calgary vs. Edmonton; Division: Smythe.; Records --
The Flames placed second in the division at 46-26-8. The defending Stanley Cup
champion Oilers slipped to 37-37-6 and third place.; Calgary update -- The
Flames scored a league-high 344 goals. Theo Fleury led the way with 51 goals
and 53 assists. Defenseman Al MacInnis added 28 goals and 75 assists, and Joe
Nieuwendyk contributed 45 goals and 40 assists. Sergei Makarov had the best
shooting percentage in the league, scoring on 30 of 93 shots (32.3 percent).;
Edmonton update -- The Oilers are better than their record indicates. Mark
Messier, last season's MVP, missed 27 games because of injuries and the Oilers
were 8-17-2 without him. He's healthy for the playoffs, but the Oilers also
miss Jari Kurri, who left at the end of last season to join a team in Italy.
Kurri is the NHL's all-time leader in playoff goals (92 in 10 seasons).; Key
to the series -- Watch Fleury. If the Oilers keep him quiet, they could win
the series.  </TEXT>

EIGHT IS ENOUGH FOR KINGS;
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: GRETZKY HAS FIVE POINTS AGAINST OILERS AS WINLESS STREAK FINALLY COMES
TO AN END, 8-3.
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It's over.
</P>
<P>
After three weeks. After four losses and four ties.
</P>
<P>
After embarrassing defeats and valiant comeback attempts, painful injuries and
pointless penalties.
</P>
<P>
After countless pep talks, displays of temper that left clubhouse furniture in
ruins and one lost stick, the Kings have won a game.
</P>
<P>
Letting out all the frustration collected over an eight-game winless streak,
the Kings blasted the Edmonton Oilers, 8-3, Saturday night before a sellout
Forum crowd of 16,005.
</P>
<P>
Led by Wayne Gretzky's five points and a pair of goals each from Steve Duchesne
and Bob Kudelski, the Kings racked up their highest goal total of the season to
improve to 17-9-5 and move back within three points of the Smythe
Division-leading Calgary Flames.
</P>
<P>
"There's a sense of relief," Gretzky said of the end of the streak. "I'd be
lying if I said there wasn't.
</P>
<P>
"But you have to look at the positive. If people had said in the beginning that
we'd have the fewest losses in the division and be just three points behind
Calgary with a couple of games in hand at this point, people wouldn't have
believed it."
</P>
<P>
And if people had said the Oilers, defending Stanley Cup champions, would
stumble from the start of this season, and spend some dark days in the Smythe
Division cellar where they are again stuck after Saturday's loss, few would
have believed it, either.
</P>
<P>
Edmonton, playing without injured center Mark Messier, dropped to 12-16-2. By
winning Saturday, the Winnipeg Jets moved a point ahead of the Oilers back into
fourth place in the Smythe.
</P>
<P>
The Oilers came into this game having allowed only 88 goals, fewest in the
division, but the Kings were not to be denied this night.
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, Coach Tom Webster showed his frustration at the winless streak
by throwing a stick onto the ice.
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, the emotional leader was Luc Robitaille, who was slapped with a
major penalty for getting into a rare fight. The opponent was Craig Simpson. It
was a rematch of their last meeting when Robitaille was suspended for four
games for high-sticking Simpson.
</P>
<P>
Robitaille got Simpson in a headlock in one corner Saturday and pummeled him.
</P>
<P>
When he was asked if the fight was indeed a continuation of his confrontation
last month with Simpson, Robitaille replied with a smile, "Oh, was that who it
was?"
</P>
<P>
Then, he added, "When you're out for four games, you have memories of sitting
home."
</P>
<P>
The Kings buried their memories of the previous eight games early Saturday.
They got on top with a two-goal spurt midway through the first period, Dave
Taylor getting his eighth goal and Kudelski his 10th.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky got his team-leading 20th goal on a power play to make it 3-0, scoring
at the 6:57 mark of the second period.
</P>
<P>
At 12:54 of the period, Steve Kasper increased the Kings' edge to 4-0 with his
fourth goal.
</P>
<P>
Duchesne scored at 18:03 in a four-on-four situation.
</P>
<P>
It took the Robitaille-Simpson battle to get the Oilers on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
Simpson was given a double minor for roughing. Robitaille was given two minutes
for instigating and five minutes for fighting.
</P>
<P>
Given a three-minute major penalty to work with this time, the Oilers managed
only three shots on goal, including Anatoli Semenov's fourth goal.
</P>
<P>
Edmonton's other goals were scored by Steve Smith (his seventh) and Petr Klima
(his 11th).
</P>
<P>
Kudelski scored the Kings' sixth goal. It was his second of the night and 11th
of the season. Robitaille added his 16th goal and Duchesne his ninth and second
of the night. Duchesne also had two assists.
</P>
<P>
The Kings got plenty out of their efforts, scoring the eight goals on 34 shots.
Fourteen of those came off goalie Bill Ranford. He was replaced by Kari Takko
for the final period, but the Kings touched him up for the remaining 10 shots
and three goals.
</P>
<P>
"We've been very upbeat," Webster said of the agonizing winless streak. "We
knew the breaks would eventually have to start going our way."
</P>
<P>
Although the Kings face a tough week on the road, in Edmonton, Calgary and
Vancouver, Gretzky is optimistic.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody goes through a bit of a tailspin," he said. "Hopefully, ours is
behind us."
</P>
<P>
King Notes
</P>
<P>
The Oilers left center Mark Messier home to rest his left knee. Messier
sprained that knee earlier in the season and missed 10 games. Edmonton won the
first game after he was injured, then lost nine in a row. Since Messier's
return, the Oilers are 10-4. But with the knee acting up and only one game this
weekend, the Oilers decided to give Messier a few additional days of healing
time. He is expected back in the lineup Tuesday when the Kings play at
Edmonton. . . . King defenseman Marty McSorley missed his sixth game with a
bruised rib. McSorley had been scheduled to return Saturday, but experienced
soreness in practice. . . . Defenseman Bob Halkidis has been recalled from the
Kings' Phoenix farm team. Halkidis appeared in two games for the Kings last
week on emergency recall after missing the early part of the season while
recovering from shoulder surgery.

<LEADPARA>  The Los Angeles Kings thought they had problems going into Game 3 of the
Smythe Division finals on Monday night at the Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton,
Alberta.;    Tomas Sandstrom and Bob Kudelski, both shelved with injuries in
Game 2, were gone. The Edmonton Oilers had the home-ice advantage, and they
are, after all, the defending Stanley Cup champions.  </LEADPARA>

KINGS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  NHL Playoffs  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Things couldn't get worse, could they?;    Unfortunately for the Kings,
yes. Eighteen minutes into Monday's game, Steve Duchesne's shot bounced off
the left ear of teammate Wayne Gretzky, who immediately slammed his helmet to
the ice. Then, holding his ear, with blood dripping down his cheek, Gretzky
skated, slumped over, to the Kings' bench. He was examined by an ear
specialist, received 25 stitches, and did not return.;    And with a slap shot
between the pads of Kelly Hrudey 48 seconds into the second overtime, Esa
Tikkanen sent the Kings to a 4-3 defeat before a sellout crowd of 17,503. On
the goal, Tikkanen checked Tony Granato in the corner, then took a pass from
Petr Klima and fired a 35-footer for the winner.;    Every game in the series
has reached overtime, and the last two went into a second overtime. The Oilers
lead the best-of-seven series, 2-1. Game 4 is Wednesday night at the
Northlands Coliseum.;    For much of the night, the action was overshadowed by
Gretzky's injury.;    "He's hearing all sorts of noises in his ear," said
Stephen Lombardo, the Kings' physician. "Right now, he has headaches and
dizziness. If he plays in Game 4 depends on how he feels (today).";    Each
team scored in the second period, the Oilers going ahead at 4:48 when Jeff
Beukeboom's shot from the right point deflected off Kings defenseman Marty
McSorley and went between Hrudey's pads.;    But the Kings tied the score at
18:08 on a power play, as Steve Smith, near the Oilers' net, passed to
Beukeboom. But Beukeboom couldn't handle the pass, and John Tonelli stole the
puck and passed in front to Luc Robitaille, who beat Grant Fuhr to the glove
side from 15 feet.;    The Kings took a 2-1 lead 5:38 into the third period,
on another power play, as Tonelli poked in a centering pass from Todd Elik.;
 The Oilers got even at 11:16, on a power play of their own. Starting behind
his own net, Tikkanen carried the puck to center ice, got around Brad Jones,
split between Tim Watters and Marty McSorley, and beat Hrudey to his stick
side.;    Undeterred, Tonelli put the Kings back in front 36 seconds later,
with a five-foot backhander between Fuhr's pads.;    But Anatoli Semenov sent
the game into overtime with 5:05 left, stuffing in a centering pass from
Martin Gelinas.;  NORTH STARS 5, BLUES 1: Jon Casey made 29 saves and Curt
Giles' first playoff goal since 1984 ignited a four-goal outburst in the first
10:48 as Minnesota beat St. Louis in Bloomington, Minn., to take a 2-1 lead in
their series.;    Minnesota, the NHL's 16th-best team during the regular
season, beat No. 1 Chicago in the opening round and now has home-ice advantage
against No. 2 St. Louis heading into Game 4 of the Norris Division finals
Wednesday night. The North Stars have won five of their last six playoff
games.;    The Blues, who finished 37 points ahead of Minnesota, had a similar
start in their first-round series. They split at home against the Red Wings
and lost twice in Detroit before winning three straight to become only the
eighth team to rally from a 3-1 series deficit.;    Casey has followed a solid
regular season with a sensational postseason. He has started all nine of
Minnesota's games and leads playoff goalies in victories (six), goals-against
average (2.35), save percentage (.919) and shutouts. He has allowed one goal
or less in five of the last six games.;    Casey received superb support from
his defensemen and back-checking forwards such as Stewart Gavin and Gaetan
Duchesne, who again held Brett Hull scoreless. Hull, who had 86 regular-season
goals and eight more against Detroit, had three shots Monday and now has eight
shots in the first three games.;    St. Louis' Dave Thomlinson didn't score
until 6:12 remained in the second period with Minnesota leading 5-0.;  ETC.:
New York Rangers president Jack Diller was fired Monday, nine days after his
team was knocked out of the playoffs. The surprise announcement came less than
two months after Diller was dismissed as president of the New York Knicks in a
restructuring move that brought Dave Checketts to the NBA team as its new
president.  </TEXT>

MIKE DOWNEY: WHEN WILL KINGS LAND BOBBY ORR?

Hockey in July. The guy has got us talking hockey in July. And just so the
general slapshot-happy public can keep everything straight -- although,
remember, this could change in the next 24 hours -- here are some of the few
remaining people Bruce McNall has not yet brought to the Los Angeles Kings, but
still might:
</P>
<P>
 -- The rest of the Edmonton Oilers.
</P>
<P>
 -- Bobby Orr, Bobby Hull or Bobby Clarke.
</P>
<P>
 -- The Howe family.
</P>
<P>
 -- Brian Boitano.
</P>
<P>
 -- That Russian goalie, Tretiak.
</P>
<P>
 -- Anybody born in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
 -- Either Esposito.
</P>
<P>
 -- Czech defectors.
</P>
<P>
 -- The 1980 Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
 -- Mario Lemieux.
</P>
<P>
 -- Pepe Lepieux.
</P>
<P>
 -- Any Detroit player not currently behind bars.
</P>
<P>
 -- Any Sutter brother, Stastny brother, Schmenge or McKenzie brother.
</P>
<P>
 -- Anybody nicknamed Boom Boom, Rocket, Toe, Punch, Tiger, the Cat, Moose or
Goose.
</P>
<P>
 -- Anybody named Guy who pronounces it Gee.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, McNall has gotten around to just about everybody. His latest
acquisition: Larry Robinson, 17-year veteran of the Montreal Canadiens,
defenseman deluxe and another of Canada's national treasures.
</P>
<P>
A million-six? Sure thing. Sign here. How many years you want, Lar? Two? Three?
You got it.
</P>
<P>
Love that Bruce! You gotta love this guy, if you love good hockey players. He
wants 'em, he gets 'em. Oh, we assume that General Manager Rogie Vachon dials
the phone, but McNall is the man behind the scenes, the man with the checkbook
as thick as the Yellow Pages, the man who is going to bring a championship
hockey club to California if he has to sell every expensive black silk suit he
owns and go around the Forum wearing a barrel.
</P>
<P>
McNall is turning into Bob Barker. Wayne Gretzky, come on down! Larry Robinson,
come on down! Kelly Hrudey, come out West! Steve Kasper, Mike Krushelnyski,
John Tonelli, Ron Duguay, Marty McSorley, Chris Kontos, good guys, tough guys,
old guys, unwanted guys, come on out to Bruce's Holiday on Ice! The Kings said,
"California is the place you oughta be," so they loaded up the truck and they
moved to Beverly. Hills, that is. Swimming pools. Movie stars.
</P>
<P>
Larry Robinson will lend a hand to a defense sorely in need of one. L.A. has
enough offense to take a Stanley Cup, but not enough defense, except in goal.
Even if Robinson is not the player he used to be, he was good enough to work
long shifts for Montreal during the 1989 Stanley Cup finals, and in savvy alone
he's an asset. Glad to have him.
</P>
<P>
Canadians (and Canadiens) must be going nuts, though. The sight of Gretzky and
Robinson in Los Angeles uniforms . . . ugh. Picture Magic Johnson playing for
San Antonio. Or how about Chris Evert defecting to Czechoslovakia?
</P>
<P>
Don't you get the feeling, too, that McNall is just getting started? He's got
an offensive super-hero, a defensive wonder, a goalie, a new coach, new
uniforms, a guy with a "lucky butt" as a good-luck charm, Sylvester Stallone at
rinkside.. . . What more could anyone want? A 25,000-seat arena in the Valley?
A practice facility in Palm Springs with hot-and-cold running Molson's from the
faucets? His own TV super-station?
</P>
<P>
McNall has it all. He and Gretzky own a horse together, so it'll probably win
the Breeders' Cup or something. McNall could probably buy a donkey and win the
Preakness, the lucky butt.
</P>
<P>
We thought for a while that the Kings might sign Guy Lafleur, who has been
around so long he calls Larry Robinson Sonny. But Lafleur has signed with the
Quebec Nordiques, proving that there are some guys even Los Angeles can't buy.
</P>
<P>
Montreal center Bobby Smith believes Lafleur is putting too much of a load on
himself. "He's going to be in the spotlight now, and he's going to have the
type of pressure he wouldn't have faced in Los Angeles, let's say, where Wayne
Gretzky and Bernie Nicholls and Luc Robitaille are such great players."
</P>
<P>
We can't help wondering who else McNall might get his hands on before too long.
</P>
<P>
Maybe he will raid Edmonton again. If he can't get goalie Grant Fuhr, who is so
fed up with Oiler management that he announced his retirement at 26, we can
easily see McNall getting his hands on Jimmy Carson, who could play out the
rest of his contract at Edmonton, then sign with the Kings as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
It is no big National Hockey League secret that Carson would love to return to
Los Angeles. He still has a house here. It wasn't Carson's fault that he was
ordered to leave the country in the great Gretzky trade on Aug. 9, 1988. Carson
is an all-star who still might be as good as Gretzky someday, and has a dozen
years or more left to prove it.
</P>
<P>
Boy, this is fun, talking hockey.
</P>
<P>
Let's get this baseball business over with and get back to the good stuff.

<LEADPARA>  The Edmonton Oilers traded malcontent hockey superstar Mark Messier to the New
York Rangers today for three players, making good on Messier's prediction last
month: "I don't think you'll see me in that uniform again.";   Messier's
contract dispute with the Oilers dates back to last winter, but he said his
later trade demands also revolved around the club's inability to win over the
past two seasons.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  OILERS TRADE MESSIER TO RANGERS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "It's about winning," he said last month.;   Along with Messier, the
Rangers received future considerations in return for center Bernie Nicholls,
right wing Steven Rice and left wing Louie DeBrusk.;   The Rangers said
Messier, 30, winner of the Hart Trophy as the league's MVP after the 1989-1990
season, would be ready to play Saturday night in Montreal.;   Messier was part
of five Stanley Cup championship teams in the past seven years at Edmonton,
playing alongside Wayne Gretzky.;   But Gretzky was traded to Los Angeles in
1988, and Edmonton's star has been on the decline since. Messier has said he
blames the Oilers for not holding onto its good players, such as forward Adam
Graves, who left as a free agent.;   Messier, a 12-year Oilers veteran, is
perhaps the player most often associated with Edmonton's Stanley Cup
victories. He forced the deal with his refusal to report to training camp.;
Like many before him, he left the team on bad terms after complaining that
management was refusing to reward the players for their loyalty by giving them
better salaries.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  ADD A new contender to the list of potential training-camp sites for the San
Jose Sharks.;    If everything falls into place, the Sharks could set up camp
in September at the Ice Capades Chalet in Cupertino's Vallco Fashion Park
shopping mall.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  SHARKS MIGHT TRAIN AT VALLCO  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Pro Hockey
Additional information attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Although the Cow Palace in Daly City (where the Sharks will play their
first two seasons) and facilities in Santa Rosa and Fresno have been mentioned
by Sharks officials as options, the folks from Vallco have caught the team's
attention.;    The Sharks used the Vallco rink for their uniform unveiling
ceremony in February, and they are exploring the possibility of making the
rink a permanent practice site.;    "There are some things that are attractive
about the idea," said Dean Lombardi, the assistant general manager of the
Sharks. "I expect that we'll sit down with them again soon and talk about it
some more.";    The ice surface at the Vallco rink is about 175 feet long and
75 feet wide, making it considerably smaller than typical NHL rinks, which
generally are 200 feet by 85 feet. But Bob Wahlquist, Vallco's general
manager, said the rink could be expanded. Wahlquist also indicated that there
is available space in the building for locker rooms, shower facilities, a
retail shop and offices.;    "Right now, we're just having conversations with
the hockey team," Wahlquist said. "They're looking for a site, and we have ice
available.";    If the Sharks do move into Vallco, they'll be following the
lead of the Edmonton Oilers, who train at a rink in the West Edmonton Mall.
And if a deal can be worked out to get the desired improvements made, the
Sharks would be interested in discussing a long-term commitment to the rink,
Lombardi said.;    But could the necessary work be completed by September?;
"I don't think anything is impossible," Wahlquist said. "If you want it badly
enough, you can make it happen.";  SENIOR SHARKS: Even if the Sharks don't win
the Stanley Cup anytime soon, owner George Gund can say he has won a
championship with Sharks from San Jose.;    Gund is on the roster of the San
Jose Senior Sharks, a men's team for players 50 and older. And last weekend,
the team won a championship at a tournament in Vancouver, British Columbia.;
 Gund is listed as a player-coach on the 50-and-older team, which was 3-1
during the tournament. He also is listed as the coach of a San Jose Senior
Sharks team in the 45-and-older bracket, and that team was 2-2 in its division
during the Vancouver tournament.;  ON THE TUBE: A spokesman for SportsChannel
Bay Area said the cable station has agreed to provide KICU-TV (Ch. 36) a live
feed of the April 12 playoff game between the Los Angeles Kings and Vancouver
Canucks so that the game can be broadcast on over-the-air television in the
Bay Area.;    SportsChannel is scheduled to show the game on tape delay at 11
p.m., said Eric Stanion, a spokesman for the station. Stanion said the game
will not be shown live on SportsChannel because the station will be carrying
an A's game that night.;    Stanion also said the station isn't concerned
about providing KICU with a competitive program.;    "We're considering it as
more of a goodwill gesture to the Sharks and Channel 36," he said.;    KICU is
scheduled to broadcast 30 Sharks games next season, and SportsChannel Bay Area
has expressed interest in carrying some additional games on cable.;  FORGET
GAME 1: Although six of the eight teams with home-ice advantage were upset in
playoff openers Wednesday and Thursday, recent history says the key to winning
a series in the NHL is winning the second game.;    Winners of the second game
went on to take 12 of the 15 series that made up last season's playoffs. And
six of those teams were beaten in series openers.;    Makes those
opening-night upsets seem a little less significant, eh?;  SHARK BITES: Sharks
officials will be in the SportsChannel Bay Area studios Thursday night to make
a live appearance with comedian Bob Sarlatte, Stanion said. The activity will
kick off a week in which SportsChannel programming will be available free on
cable systems that offer the station to subscribers. . . . Don't expect the
player dispersal draft involving the Sharks and Minnesota North Stars to take
place before the middle of May. Although the draft technically could take
place anytime after the North Stars are eliminated from the Stanley Cup
playoffs, the world championship tournament is scheduled to begin April 19 in
Finland, and Sharks General Manager Jack Ferreira, the G.M. for Team USA, will
be departing for the tournament a few days before it starts. Ferreira won't
return to the United States until the first week of May. . . . Ferreira said
he probably won't name a coach for the Sharks' new minor league affiliate in
Kansas City, Mo., until after the NHL's entry draft in June.;  HOCKEY

<P>
NO QUESTION, THE GAME HAS PLENTY OF ANSWERS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the Stanley Cup is back at its old home at Edmonton, where it resided
through much of the 1980s, the NHL is entering the bright new world of the
1990s with a new wave of popularity in the United States, a new wave of
interest in the Sun Belt and a new wave of Czechoslovakians everywhere.
</P>
<P>
Soccer has been hailed perennially as America's sport of the future, but the
future seems to have arrived for hockey.
</P>
<P>
As the NHL prepares to drop the puck on its 74th season Thursday night, the
curtain appears ready to fall on the old era of neglect.
</P>
<P>
No longer can the entire league be dismissed with the old Rodney Dangerfield
line, "I went to a fight and a hockey game broke out." No longer does a
majority in this country plead ignorance at the mention of icing the puck. No
longer can Canadians claim the puck stops there.
</P>
<P>
But along with the new popularity and the big bucks have come big problems.
</P>
<P>
On this eve of another season, what's ahead for the NHL? The best way to answer
that question is with 18 others.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1. How popular is the league?
</P>
<P>
Attendance reached record levels last year for the 11th consecutive season,
with nearly 14 million people attending NHL games, including the Stanley Cup
playoffs. Locally, in the second year of the Age of Gretzky, the Kings achieved
a new high: 628,274, with 32 sellouts in 40 regular-season dates. At
Pittsburgh, Mario Lemieux has proved the equal of any Steeler or Pirate in the
T-shirt and autograph-signing market. Two weeks ago, 25,581, the largest crowd
in NHL history, paid up to $99 a seat to watch the Kings and the Penguins play
an exhibition game in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2. Will there ever be an NHL team in Florida?
</P>
<P>
Will there ever be ice? In games at both St. Petersburg and Miami, promoters
found a good crowd is great, but a good Zamboni ice-grooming machine is even
better. In a few spots, the Kings and their opponents were horrified to find
themselves skating on concrete. But those kinds of problems will be solved. And
when they are, don't be surprised to find the Miami Heat joined by the Miami
Ice.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3. When will that happen?
</P>
<P>
According to its master plan, the NHL will add seven teams to its current 21 by
the end of the century. There were a lot of chuckles when that idea was
announced, especially when the league is charging expansion teams a $50-million
entry fee. But the new Bay Area club, the Sharks, is already preparing for
1991-92, and the line at President John Ziegler's door has formed, with
interest stretching from San Diego to Milwaukee to Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4. If the league is so popular, why isn't it on U.S. network television?
</P>
<P>
Low ratings chased hockey off the national tube more than a decade ago. But the
NHL made a brief return last season with a live network telecast of its
midseason All-Star game. The hope is that continued attendance increases and a
truly national league, containing franchises everywhere from the Sun Belt to
the Pacific Northwest, will persuade network executives to again take a chance.
Failing that, NHL officials hope to get more cable exposure. The violence
remains a sticking point, but it would seem that a medium with room for
"American Gladiators" and professional wrestling could put up with a few
out-of-control goons.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5. Why doesn't the NHL just stop the violence?
</P>
<P>
That's up to Ziegler.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
6. What does he say?
</P>
<P>
Hardly anything.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
7. Hasn't the league cracked down more on the fighting?
</P>
<P>
Yes it has, but you'll know league officials are serious when they pass one
simple rule: You fight, you're gone. No long stays in the penalty box. No stiff
penalties. Anybody who throws a punch is thrown out. Plain and simple. It works
in other sports, so there's no reason to think it wouldn't work in hockey.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
8. Why hasn't the league already done this?
</P>
<P>
Because of a lingering fear it will alienate the fans it already has,
completely ignoring the potential fans it fails to attract because of the
stigma of fighting. True, incidents of violence are down, but one game like
last season's record-breaking brawl between the Kings and the Edmonton Oilers
offsets all the good publicity the NHL accrued over a season of fewer fights.
If the Kings' Marty McSorley and the Oilers' Mark Messier, who struck the first
blows, had been tossed out at the start of that game, the violence would have
ended there.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
9. What other problems does the league face?
</P>
<P>
Drugs. Revelations of such problems have paled in comparison to big brothers
basketball, football and baseball. But the Bob Probert case last season and the
Grant Fuhr case this year indicate that might be changing.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10. What can be done?
</P>
<P>
One answer might be a drug rehabilitation program such as other sports have.
Ziegler maintains that the league doesn't have a drug problem. So when cases
surface, he simply suspends the player, hoping he has also suspended any
problem.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
11. What's the good news?
</P>
<P>
For players, it's money. Loads of it. Seven players, led by Wayne Gretzky, are
earning in excess of $1 million a year. The recent million-dollar-plus
contracts of Ray Bourque of the Boston Bruins, Chris Chelios of the Chicago
Blackhawks and Scott Stevens of the St. Louis Blues elevated defensemen into
the high-rent district.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
12. Can the owners afford it?
</P>
<P>
No way, says almost every owner in every sport. Of course, that's the same
thing they say when they're asked if they want to sell their clubs. But the
Kings, despite the NHL's highest payroll, went from a $5 million loss to a
profit of slightly more than $5 million in Gretzky's first year in L.A.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
13. What will be the biggest change in the league this year?
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the Czechs. A year ago, everybody was yelling, the Russians are coming!
They came, they saw but they hardly conquered. The Soviet players had little
impact. Sergei Makarov was rookie of the year but wasn't much help when his
Calgary Flames fell to the Kings in the opening round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
14. Will the Czechs be better?
</P>
<P>
Many clubs think so. NHL teams selected 21 players from Czechoslovakia in this
year's entry draft, as opposed to only eight last season. Czechs expected to
help this season include wing Jaromir Jagr of Pittsburgh, who scored 60 points
in 51 games last year in his native country; center Bobby Holik and defenseman
Jergus Baca of the Hartford Whalers, wing Richard Kron and defenseman Jiri
Slegr of the Vancouver Canucks, wing Zdeno Ciger of the New Jersey Devils,
center Robert Reichel of Calgary and goalie Dominik Hasek of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
15. What's new in the league?
</P>
<P>
Five coaches: Doug Risebrough of Calgary, Bryan Murray of the Detroit Red
Wings, Bob Gainey of the Minnesota North Stars, Dave Chambers of the Quebec
Nordiques and Bob Johnson of Pittsburgh. Murray is also general manager in
Detroit, as is Coach Mike Keenan in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
16. Who figures to be strong in the Campbell Conference?
</P>
<P>
It would be foolish to discount Edmonton after its performance in the Stanley
Cup finals. Although they have lost wing Jari Kurri, who bolted the NHL during
the summer to play in Italy, the Oilers still have the speed, goaltending and
defense to rate as favorites. After all, this team survived the loss of
Gretzky, didn't it? Calgary, Chicago and St. Louis should also be in
contention.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
17. How about the Wales Conference?
</P>
<P>
Boston will be back. But this might be the year for the Buffalo Sabres,
strengthened by the acquisition of Dale Hawerchuk, to make a strong run.
Montreal also has a shot, as does the survivor of the competitive Patrick
Division.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
18. How will the Kings do?
</P>
<P>
With Tomas Sandstrom and Tony Granato on his line all season, the old Gretzky
may be back. Unfortunately for them, unless all their question marks on defense
are answered, the old Kings also may be back.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The highway between Banff and Calgary was treacherous Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The bus moved cautiously through the Canadian Rockies, its tires seeking
traction on a road slick with a sheet of ice.
</P>
<P>
But inside there was only laughter. An Eddie Murphy video played on a big
screen. A stunning victory was being replayed in the heads of the passengers.
</P>
<P>
The Kings had come down to Calgary from their mountain retreat earlier in the
day, assured by all that they were heading for defeat.
</P>
<P>
Facing the defending Stanley Cup champion Calgary Flames in the opener of a
best-of-seven playoff series without Wayne Gretzky? Forget it.
</P>
<P>
Now the Kings were heading back to their training site in Banff having the last
laugh after coming from behind with four third-period goals to win the opener,
5-3.
</P>
<P>
"It sure felt good on the ride home," said Luc Robitaille, who scored two
goals.
</P>
<P>
By Thursday, however, the mood had mellowed.
</P>
<P>
Banff is a holiday town. Skiers move easily across picture-postcard mountains.
Vacationers snap shots of elk running through the forests. Tourists jam the
colorful shops and restaurants along Banff Avenue.
</P>
<P>
But in the Banff Recreation Center, where the Kings train, it was all business.
</P>
<P>
"We're back on Earth," defenseman Steve Duchesne said. "We're back in the real
world. We know we have to win four times."
</P>
<P>
There was conjecture before this series began that if the Kings lost the first
two games and looked hopelessly out of the series, the club might choose not to
use Gretzky at all, allowing him to heal his back injury in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
But with the Kings' chances and Gretzky's back much improved, it is likely
he'll play Sunday when the series switches to the Forum for Game 3.
</P>
<P>
"My back is 100% better," Gretzky said by phone from his Encino home.
</P>
<P>
He is hoping to skate today for the first time since he injured the back
against the New York Islanders on March. 22. If that workout goes well, he'll
practice with the team Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Anything would be better than viewing the playoffs on television, as Gretzky
did Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot easier to play," he said. "I don't like to watch.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I've ever been as excited. The guys should be proud, yet this
thing is a long way from being over. I'm happy for (owner) Bruce (McNall),
(General Manager) Rogie (Vachon) and (Coach) Tom (Webster). They took a lot of
heat during the year, along with the heat over the Bernie (Nicholls) trade."
</P>
<P>
When a reporter asked Webster about Gretzky Thursday, he responded loudly: "Let
it go! Why are you always asking about Gretzky? Leave it alone!"
</P>
<P>
His mood was not one of anger, but playfulness. Why not? He had endured a
season of injury and criticism to coach his first playoff victory after
finishing fourth in the Smythe Division.
</P>
<P>
"We'll deal with (Gretzky's return) when it happens," Webster said. "I hope it
happens. But we can't deal with it now. We have to stay with what's going well
for us."
</P>
<P>
With Gretzky missing, the Kings have asked for leadership from veteran
defenseman Larry Robinson, who is appearing in his 18th Stanley Cup playoff.
Robinson responds by stressing a low-key approach.
</P>
<P>
"You're all right as long as you don't get too much of an emotional high or
low," he said. "You have to keep it in perspective. In the playoffs, there's
more hype each game, each shift. You can't get too caught up in it."
</P>
<P>
Robinson was the voice the Kings heard when things got tense Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"When we were down, 3-1," Robitaille said, "we were scared a little. And even
when we got up, 4-3, it was Larry who said, 'Let's cool down. Let us play our
game and we know we are going to win.' "
</P>
<P>
Robitaille has a message of his own for his teammates, which he plans to
deliver tonight before Game 2 in Calgary's Olympic Saddledome (at 6:30, PDT, on
Prime Ticket, KGIL-1260 and KORG-1190).
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to tell the guys what happened my first year," he said.
</P>
<P>
That was the 1986-87 season, when the Kings opened the playoffs in Edmonton,
beating the Oilers, 5-2.
</P>
<P>
"We came out the next game," Robitaille said, "and they were all over us all
night." Final score: Edmonton 13, Kings 3. The Oilers didn't lose again,
winning the series in five games.
</P>
<P>
In Calgary, the mood had also shifted. Before Game 1, there was an obsession
with Gretzky. Would he come? Was he already there?
</P>
<P>
Flame Coach Terry Crisp talked as if the Great One was involved in the Great
Scam, that he was hiding somewhere on the slopes of Banff, waiting to drop in
at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
Papers chronicled the Gretzky Watch. One television station reported he had
been spotted in Calgary.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky sightings became an overnight rage in Canada.
</P>
<P>
By Thursday, however, the Flames were more concerned with spotting their own
deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
As practice ended in Banff, Robinson had a parting observation for a reporter.
"It is not so much the joy of winning," he said, "but the fear of losing that
makes you stronger. That's what keeps me going."
</P>
<P>
Robinson headed out into the sunshine of Banff. The ice had melted, and the
roads would be clear for today's trip down to Calgary.
</P>
<P>
But as Robinson would be the first to add, that didn't mean there might not
still be danger ahead for the Kings.

GRETZKY SCORES TWICE, BUT OILERS COME BACK TO GAIN A 6-5 VICTORY
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky had two of the Kings' goals as they played even-up through two
periods, but his former teammates, the Edmonton Oilers, typically jumped on
every opportunity down the stretch to come away with a 6-5 victory before a
sellout crowd of 16,005 at the Forum Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
It was a spirited game between teams that played to a standoff in their eight
Smythe Division games last season and then battled to the end before the Kings
eliminated the then Stanley Cup defending champions from the playoffs, winning
an emotional come-from-behind seven-game series.
</P>
<P>
Edmonton Coach John Muckler said: "I thought L.A. played pretty well. It was
like a playoff game. I don't think L.A. can play any harder."
</P>
<P>
The Oilers played hard, too, paying no special heed to Gretzky or his pursuit
of the National Hockey League's all-time scoring record.
</P>
<P>
The emotion of the big trade is starting to fade.
</P>
<P>
"If anything, they're worrying less about me," Gretzky said. "I'm worrying less
about them, too. Both of us are more and more comfortable. We're just playing
the game."
</P>
<P>
Gretzky had trouble scoring a goal against his former teammates last season,
not getting his first goal against the Oilers until the sixth game the teams
played, in March.
</P>
<P>
Not so Saturday night. He got into the spirit of his record chase, those orange
and blue sweaters giving him no pause.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's two goals against the Oilers were his first two of the season, adding
two more points to his career total -- which is now 11 from being the all-time
record in the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky has a total of 1,840 points and is closing fast on the total of 1,850
that Gordie Howe set during 25 years in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
Luc Robitaille, who had a goal and two assists Saturday night, said the team is
not distracted by the knowledge that everyone is watching and counting
Gretzky's points.
</P>
<P>
"There would be more pressure if it was at the end of the season and he had 92
goals or if he was trying to keep one of his big scoring streaks alive,"
Robitaille said. "Then you would have to want him to have the goals. But 11
points? He's going to get those points. The only question is when."
</P>
<P>
Robitialle assisted on Gretzky's first goal, making the pass for the shot that
scooted under the stick of Oiler goalie Bill Ranford, who has replaced Grant
Fuhr since his emergency appendectomy.
</P>
<P>
That first goal, midway through the first period, gave the Kings a brief lead.
</P>
<P>
Only 31 seconds later, Kevin McClelland stole the puck from Marty McSorley and
carried the puck back toward the Kings' goal. Kelly Hrudey came out to meet
him, but McClelland fired the puck right past him to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky scored his second goal 1 minute 7 seconds into the second period,
taking advantage of the power play with Oiler defenseman Kevin Lowe still in
the penalty box for a holding penalty at the end of the first period.
</P>
<P>
The Oilers were about to clear the puck out of their zone when Bob Kudelski
dived to the ice as if he were trying to cover a fumbled football. His body
deflected the puck out to John Tonelli, who sent it across the ice to where
Gretzky was waiting near the left post. Gretzky stopped the pass on his
backhand side, turned, took aim and put a forehand shot past Ranford.
</P>
<P>
Craig MacTavish tied it for the Oilers again at 4:33 of the second, racing up
the left side, passing across to Jari Kurri and then getting the puck back from
Kurri for the shot.
</P>
<P>
Bernie Nicholls put the Kings back on top, 3-2, with his first goal of the
season, scoring on a power play off a centering pass from Robitaille, who
waited until the split second before he crossed the goal line to make the pass,
letting Ranford think he was going around behind the net before making the
perfect pass back to Nicholls.
</P>
<P>
Soon after that, momentum took a turn toward Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen seconds before the Kings could get out of the second period with the
lead, Mark Messier beat Hrudey to the puck and poked it into the net. Hrudey
had gone to his knees to stop a long shot by Lowe. The puck was sitting in a
dangerous spot on the rebound, so Hrudey was scrambling to push it away when
Messier pounced on it to tie the score at 3-3.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's linemate in his Oiler days, Kurri, got the goal that put the Oilers
up, 4-3, early in the third period, scoring only nine seconds into a two-man
advantage.
</P>
<P>
Then a flurry of three goals in less than a minute left the Kings trailing by
two.
</P>
<P>
It was a bad stretch for the Kings, starting with a bad decision by Ken
Baumgartner.
</P>
<P>
At 9:29, Baumgartner decided to pull up near center ice to check MacTavish into
the boards. He took MacTavish out of the play, but he also took himself out,
leaving McSorley facing a two-on-one against Esa Tikkanen and Kurri that ended
with Tikkanen's goal.
</P>
<P>
At 9:50, Nicholls' second goal of the game, a strong shot from the right
circle, put the Kings within one.
</P>
<P>
But at 10:20, Glenn Anderson flipped the puck past Hrudey as Anderson was
falling to the ice with defenseman Larry Robinson on top of him. Both Anderson
and Robinson piled into Hrudey, and they all followed the puck into the net.
</P>
<P>
With 51 seconds left, Robitaille scored his second goal of the night on a power
play.
</P>
<P>
King Notes
</P>
<P>
After missing all exhibition games and the first two games of the regular
season with a pinched nerve in his neck, Dave Taylor plans to play tonight
against Detroit. . . . King center Hubie McDonough was not at the game Saturday
night. He had returned to New Haven, Conn., where his wife, Amy, was soon to
give birth to their first child. . . . Saturday night's game was delayed on
account of snow. Between the second and third periods malfunctioning
ice-resurfacing machines dumped three snowbanks on the ice, causing the fans to
boo and cheer as two machines appeared and disappeared, taking turns trying to
get the ice cleaned. Finally, one of the machines came to life to clean the
ice. The game was delayed about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GRETZKY'S COUNTDOWN TO 1,851 POINTS
</P>
<P>
Gordie Howe's all-time regular-season scoring record (points and assists) is
1,850. Through Saturday night's game, the Kings' Wayne Gretzky is 11 points
away from breaking that record.

GRETZKY AND COMPANY'S 'BIGGEST VICTORY' TIES PLAYOFF SERIES

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The trade of last August that took Wayne Gretzky away from the defending
Stanley Cup champion Edmonton Oilers and brought the Great One to the
struggling Kings was bound to affect the balance of power in the National
Hockey League sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
It's happening sooner. It's happening now.
</P>
<P>
Stunned Oiler fans saw some of that power slip away Thursday night at the
Northlands Coliseum as the Kings came from behind to beat the Oilers, 4-1,
snapping Edmonton's playoff-game winning streak on their home ice at 14 and
sending the series back to the Forum for the decisive seventh game.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky called it "the biggest victory" in the history of the Kings' franchise.
And owner Bruce McNall, the man who put up the millions of dollars to turn the
Kings into a winner, was quick to agree.
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely, the biggest," McNall said as he was knocked about in the crush
outside the Kings' dressing room by people wanting to shake his hand and pat
him on the back and tell him that Gretzky was worth all the millions.
</P>
<P>
But McNall has been close enough to the coaches and players this season to add
that the Oilers will "come out flying" Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
With the win, the Kings regained the home-ice advantage and took a giant step
forward in their quest for the Stanley Cup. Their climactic matchup -- the
first time the Kings and Oilers have met in a seventh game -- shapes up as a
classic.
</P>
<P>
"I think the fans who have tickets will get their money's worth," McNall said.
</P>
<P>
And all tickets have already been sold. Incredibly, the crowd at the Northlands
Coliseum Thursday night was a less-than-capacity 17,351.
</P>
<P>
Times are changing.
</P>
<P>
Game 6 started out looking like old times.
</P>
<P>
Seconds into the game, Gretzky blocked a shot by Oiler right wing Glenn
Anderson that ricocheted right back to defenseman Randy Gregg, who fired a shot
that King goalie Kelly Hrudey said bounced about 10 feet in front of him. He
couldn't stop the puck as it glanced off the ice. "I'm sure a lot of people
thought that was the series right there," Hrudey said.
</P>
<P>
The Oilers led, 1-0, with just 33 seconds gone. And there the score stayed
through almost two periods, until Mike Allison's goal tied the game at 16:22 of
the second period.
</P>
<P>
Allison fought for that goal. He got the puck in the right corner and then
scrapped and clawed and elbowed and kicked his way along the boards behind the
Edmonton net, trying to keep the puck and lose Gregg at the same time. Gregg
even pulled off one of Allison's gloves as he sought to slow him down. But when
Allison couldn't lose Gregg, he dragged him along, getting both the puck and
the defenseman around the left side of the net. As Allison was falling to the
ice, with Gregg on his back, he reached out with his stick and swept the puck
in a wide arc between the legs of Oiler goalie Grant Fuhr.
</P>
<P>
It was a goal for the highlight films. The kind of goal that turns a game
around.
</P>
<P>
Said Dave Taylor: "It was a great, great effort by Allison. Gregg was trying to
pin him on the boards and Mike just kept fighting him off and just outmuscled
him. That really gave our team a big lift."
</P>
<P>
The Kings had had a goal taken away just a few minutes earlier when referee
Bill McCreary ruled that the puck had dropped in behind Fuhr as a result of a
high stick by Taylor after Bernie Nicholls' shot was deflected into the air.
But television replays clearly showed that the puck went in off Oiler Esa
Tikkanen. It should have counted.
</P>
<P>
In that second period, the Kings outshot the Oilers, 10-4.
</P>
<P>
Jim Weimer scored the tie-breaker at 4:15 of the third period, teamming up with
Dave Taylor on a break toward the Oiler goal. Taylor took the puck up the right
side, passed it to Weimer on the left and kept driving toward the right side of
the net. Fuhr tried to keep an eye on both of them. But he wasn't quite quick
enough when Weimer decided to take the shot on the sharp angle from the bottom
of the left circle instead of making the pass to Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Weimer, too, is a former Oiler. He had played with Edmonton's Cape Breton team
all season before being traded to the Kings in a deal for some other minor
leaguers at the trading deadline, March 7.
</P>
<P>
When Weimer was recalled from New Haven just in time to score the game-winner
against the Oilers here March 21, Oiler Coach Glen Sather expressed no regret
at letting him go. In fact, Sather said at the time that Weimer was "old," that
he was "slow" and that he was, in fact, "a minor leaguer."
</P>
<P>
But that slow, old minor leaguer came home and scored another game-winner when
it counted most.
</P>
<P>
And then Chris Kontos, another player written off by the rest of the league but
signed by the Kings on March 7, scored the insurance goal. Gretzky had pulled
up at the top of the right circle, made one of his little swirls and then fired
the puck across the slot to Kontos, who was waiting at the left post to shovel
the puck over Fuhr's right skate.
</P>
<P>
For Kontos, it was playoff goal No. 7, setting a club record for goals in a
seven-game series.
</P>
<P>
But the Kings were not finished. Defenseman Dale DeGray tipped away a pass from
Oiler wing Jari Kurri, putting it right on Nicholls' stick. Nicholls made the
quick pass to Luc Robitaille, who fired the 15-foot scoring shot off the pass.
</P>
<P>
The Kings won with a solid defensive effort and a diversified offense.
</P>
<P>
"We can't rely on Wayne Gretzky to get all of our goals," Taylor said. "We had
some guys come through for us. Jim Weimer had a big goal. Chris Kontos, another
guy who wasn't even with us all season, came through with another big goal. The
Oilers like to key on Gretzky and Nicholls and Robitaille, but we have others
who can score."
</P>
<P>
Allison isn't one of the Kings' big guns, either, but even couldn't believe the
goal he scored. Allison said he was merely trying to stay in control of the
puck and get it out in front of the net, where other Kings were in scoring
position.
</P>
<P>
"As I came around, and I think I was already going down, I heard somebody,
maybe Stevie (Kasper) yelling that he was going to the net," Allison said. "I
reached out with one hand and pushed the puck around there.
</P>
<P>
"Did I think it had a chance of going in? Well, they say any time you shoot at
the net it has a chance of going in. But I was thinking that at least there
would be a rebound and a loose puck."
</P>
<P>
When the red light came on, the Kings on the bench erupted.
</P>
<P>
But it was still a 1-1 game when Kurri took a shot at the Kings' net that might
have changed the course of the game. Hrudey made one of his best stops.
</P>
<P>
Said Gretzky: "From our point of view, that goal by Allison was the kind of
goal that turns a game around. From (the Oilers') point of view, the turning
point might have been the stop on Kurri."
</P>
<P>
Both of those plays turned the tide in favor of the Kings, who are on a
two-game roll going into Saturday night's game.
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting," Gretzky said. "They're buzzing about hockey in Southern
California."
</P>
<P>
Asked if there might be a little magic taking place at the Forum Saturday,
Gretzky, the ultimate sports fan, responded: "Magic (Johnson, of the Lakers) is
playing the Clippers that night (at the Sports Arena). Hopefully, we'll make
some magic of our own."

KINGS CAN'T GO ANOTHER ROUND;
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: COMEBACK FROM 4-1 DEFICIT IS FOR NAUGHT. OILERS WIN, 6-5, WHEN JOE
MURPHY SCORES AT 4:42 OF EXTRA PERIOD, ENDING L.A. SEASON.
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The season began with the Edmonton Oilers watching as Wayne Gretzky soared past
Gordie Howe.
</P>
<P>
But it ended with Gretzky watching from the stands as the Oilers soared past
his Kings, winning, 6-5, in overtime Tuesday night at the Forum on Joe Murphy's
shot at the 4:42 mark of the extra period to sweep the best-of-seven Smythe
Division finals.
</P>
<P>
It began with the hopes that this would be the season for the Kings.
</P>
<P>
It ended, however, as so many others have for the Kings, the high hopes of an
opening-round triumph dashed by a second-round collapse.
</P>
<P>
But no one could accuse the Kings, or what was left of them at the end, of
going meekly.
</P>
<P>
Despite nine major injuries, it looked as if the Kings were going to pull off
another Miracle on Manchester after trailing, 4-1, midway through the second
period.
</P>
<P>
They came up with four goals to lead, 5-4, with 2:55 to play in regulation
time.
</P>
<P>
But then Esa Tikkanen took a shot from the left corner that bounced off one of
Marty McSorley's skates, ricocheted off the left pad of goaltender Kelly Hrudey
and dribbled into the net.
</P>
<P>
Then came Murphy's game-winner on a rebound.
</P>
<P>
"The puck just kicked out," Hrudey said, "Murphy walked into the middle and
beat me to the glove side.
</P>
<P>
"A week ago, it looked like we had so much more hockey to play. Our pride is
bruised, but time heals all."
</P>
<P>
Even Hrudey's bruised ribs, an injury that made it difficult for him to even
breathe, much less to play.
</P>
<P>
It wasn't much easier for Tomas Sandstrom and Bob Kudelski, who were playing
with broken fingers that made it difficult for them to even control their
sticks.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's back was hurting so bad, he never even made it to the ice.
</P>
<P>
The Kings were also missing Tom Laidlaw, Tim Watters, Dave Taylor, Rob Blake
and Scott Bjugstad.
</P>
<P>
But the Oilers still couldn't put them away.
</P>
<P>
Edmonton scored first when Craig Simpson, with Steve Duchesne on his back,
managed to shovel the puck over to Mark Messier as he went down.
</P>
<P>
Messier slammed it past Hrudey just inside the right post to give his club a
1-0 lead 4:57 into the game.
</P>
<P>
It was Messier's fifth goal and 13th point of the postseason.
</P>
<P>
The Oilers added to their lead at 12:02, Glenn Anderson scoring on a 20-foot
shot to Hrudey's stick side that appeared to hit the cross-bar and ricochet in,
just inside the right post.
</P>
<P>
The Kings might have folded then, their thoughts drifting from high-pressure
stick shots to low-key golf shots.
</P>
<P>
Instead, they got back into the game 4:57 into the second period, using a
combination that had yet to score in this series.
</P>
<P>
Luc Robitaille had seemed to disappear since getting two goals in each of the
first two games of the opening series against the Calgary Flames and collecting
a total of seven points over the six games.
</P>
<P>
But Robitaille got his team on the scoreboard 2:44 into the second period
Tuesday, passing to Keith Crowder, who had broken free of Jari Kurri on the
right side.
</P>
<P>
Charging the net, Crowder took Robitaille's pass, but lost his balance. As he
fell, however, Crowder still had enough control to shove the puck under
Ranford's glove before sliding into the end boards.
</P>
<P>
That seemed to spark the sellout crowd of 16,005.
</P>
<P>
The Oilers did their best to quiet the crowd, scoring twice more to move into a
4-1 advantage.
</P>
<P>
Mark Lamb shoved a rebound past Hrudey at 8:28.
</P>
<P>
And Simpson added his team-high eighth goal of the playoffs, bouncing one in
off one of Duchesne's skates at 10:38.
</P>
<P>
But the Kings came right back at 13:39 when Robitaille went behind the net to
dig out the puck and threw it out in front where Kudelski, bad finger and all,
scored his first goal of the playoffs from the right side.
</P>
<P>
Was Ranford a mere mortal after all?
</P>
<P>
He looked that way late in the period when the Kings tied the score on a pair
of goals over a span of 46 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Robitaille got the first off a pass from Todd Elik on a two-on-one rush at
17:52.
</P>
<P>
John Tonelli got the second off a pass from Mike Krushelnyski. As Tonelli
skated in left to right, Ranford swung around the crease to meet him. But
Tonelli waited until the Edmonton goalie had made his move and was spread out
on the ice before backhanding in his first goal of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
The Kings opened the final period at a disadvantage with Tony Granato finishing
up his time in the penalty box for high-sticking.
</P>
<P>
But the Kings quickly turned it to their advantage, scoring a short-handed goal
1:15 into the period.
</P>
<P>
Larry Robinson brought the puck down the right side and tossed it in front,
where first Krushelnyski, then Mike Allison took pokes at it.
</P>
<P>
Allison had the better luck of the two, ramming it past Ranford.
</P>
<P>
"I'm quite proud of my team," Coach Tom Webster said, "but it just wasn't in
the cards."
</P>
<P>
King Notes
</P>
<P>
Tom Laidlaw has not played since injuring his lower back on March 17. Tim
Watters has not returned since bruising an ankle in Game 4 of the Calgary
Flames series. Dave Taylor's final game was the title-clincher against Calgary,
the night he bruised a shoulder. Rob Blake and Scott Bjugstad were both
sidelined in the second game of this series, each with a sprained knee. . . .
In attempting to come back and win the series from a 3-0 deficit, the Kings
were trying to equal a feat accomplished twice previously in NHL history, by
the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs and the 1975 New York Islanders. . . . The year he
coached Salt Lake City, King Coach Tom Webster found himself down 3-0 in a
playoff series. His club came back to tie it, only to lose in the seventh game.

POCKLINGTON'S MOTTO IS NEVER SAY NEVER
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN RAPPOPORT, Associated Press
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edmonton Oilers owner Peter Pocklington has received a lot of abuse from fans
at home for trading Wayne Gretzky. But he says he doesn't blame them for being
bitter.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I'd ever forgive me (if he was a fan)," Pocklington said
recently. "If I was a fan I don't think I'd forgive me. If I weren't me, I
don't know if I'd trust me or not."
</P>
<P>
All this came up in the midst of a rumor that Pocklington was considering
selling goaltender Grant Fuhr. Pocklington denied the rumor, adding he would
never sell another player again like he sold Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
"I never say never about anything, but Wayne Gretzky was once in a lifetime,"
Pocklington said.
</P>
<P>
Edmonton Coach Glen Sather, responding to a recent report that the Oilers were
having difficulty filling the stands since trading Gretzky:
</P>
<P>
"We've had 97 and 98 per cent capacity. I'd have used 99, but we're not using
that number any more."
</P>
<P>
Bobby Hull, the legendary left wing, will become the second player in history
to have his number retired by two teams.
</P>
<P>
Hull, whose number has been retired by the Chicago Blackhawks, will be honored
by the Winnipeg Jets in March.
</P>
<P>
Gordie Howe's number has been retired by Detroit and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, Hull and Howe both wore No. 9.
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg center Dale Hawerchuk is trying be positive, even though the Jets have
been struggling of late.
</P>
<P>
After a recent 9-4 loss to Edmonton that was one of the low points of the
season, Hawerchuk said things could be worse.
</P>
<P>
How so?
</P>
<P>
"The low point of the season is when there are a couple of games left and you
haven't got enough games to catch up for the playoffs."
</P>
<P>
Who can Mario Lemieux thank for taking over Wayne Gretzky's spot as the NHL
scoring leader?
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
According to Chicago Blackhawks coach Mike Keenan, the main reason for
Lemieux's improvement in Pittsburgh the last two seasons is Gretzky. Keenan was
their coach on the Canadian team in the 1987 Canada Cup.
</P>
<P>
"I hope Mario has sent Wayne a thank-you note," Keenan says. "There's no
question he wouldn't be the player today if not for playing with Wayne in the
Canada Cup. "Wayne taught Mario everything he knew about hockey, then he went
out and met all the challenges from Mario on the ice. Your top players learn
from and desire challenges like that."
</P>
<P>
When the Soviet Red Army hockey team was in Hartford for a recent tour, the
players went to see the movie "Naked Gun." A scene in the film shows a
lookalike of Mikhail Gorbachev being grabbed by a guy, who rubs off the
distinctive birthmark on the Soviet leader's head.
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid they wouldn't like it," said Mike Hume, who was the NHL liaison
to the Soviet team. "But they were laughing so hard, they were holding their
sides."
</P>
<P>
The Red Army squad was unable to practice at Hartford's Civic Center, and the
players had to skate in an old, cold arena in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
"It was as close to Siberia as we could get for them," Hartford coach Larry
Pleau said.
</P>
<P>
The NHL is taking a tougher stance on criticism of officials.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the league sent a memo to the 21 teams advising non-playing personnel
they could be fined for criticizing referees. The memo, from NHL lawyer Gil
Stein, says even the "spirit and implication" of a coach's comments will be
considered a breach of the rules.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, for example, if a coach says to a reporter: 'I will say nothing about
tonight's officiating because I don't want to be fined by the league,' he'll be
fined."
</P>
<P>
The writing may be on the wall for New York Islanders veteran center Bryan
Trottier. The New York Islanders have told Trottier that his ice time will be
reduced in favor of younger players.
</P>
<P>
Trottier and his agent, Bob Thornton, talked to general manager Bill Torrey
about the issue.
</P>
<P>
"He does not want to be a part-time player," Thornton says. "If his ice time is
cut considerably, he doesn't want too be here anymore."
</P>
<P>
A stumbing block to dealing Trottier is his $700,000 salary.

<LEADPARA>  WHEN THE NHL last had a franchise with a Bay Area address, Gerald Ford was

<HEADLINE>  CATCHING UP ON THE LEAGUE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  HOCKEY '91. NHL BASICS  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Times have changed, and so has the NHL.;   Sharks have replaced Seals as
the sea animal of choice for Bay Area hockey fans, Wayne Gretzky is the game's
most dominant player and the Pittsburgh Penguins own the Stanley Cup.;   Even
in a league bound by tradition, there is room for change.;   When the Seals
played their final season in Oakland, the NHL was made up of 18 teams. But the
Sharks are team No. 22, and the league is scheduled to grow to 24 teams next
season, when the Tampa Bay Lightning and Ottawa Senators begin competition.;
The teams; The 22 teams in the NHL this season are divided into two
conferences and four divisions:; CLARENCE CAMPBELL CONFERENCE; Smythe Division
      Norris Division; San Jose Sharks       Chicago Blackhawks; Calgary
Flames         Detroit Red Wings; Edmonton Oilers        Minnesota North
Stars; Los Angeles Kings     St. Louis Blues; Vancouver Canucks     Toronto
Maple Leafs; Winnipeg Jets; Prince of Wales Conference; Patrick Division
Adams Division; New Jersey Devils     Boston Bruins; New York Islanders
Buffalo Sabres; New York Rangers      Hartford Whalers; Philadelphia Flyers
Montreal Canadiens; Pittsburgh Penguins   Quebec Nordiques; Washington
Capitals; THE BUILDINGS; The Forum in Montreal is regarded as the sport's holy
land. It's the home of the Canadiens, who have won the Stanley Cup
championship 23 times. It also has been home to such great players as Lafleur,
Jean Beliveau, Henri Richard and Ken Dryden.;      Other famous buildings in
the league include Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, Madison Square Garden in New
York, Chicago Stadium and the Boston Garden.;      The Sharks will call the
Cow Palace in Daly City home for two seasons while a downtown arena is
constructed in San Jose.; THE WINNERS AND LOSERS; The teams with the longest
and richest traditions in the NHL are Montreal, Toronto, Chicago, Detroit,
Boston and the Rangers -- the six teams that made up the league before six
expansion teams were added for the 1967-68 season.;      Of the newer teams,
the Islanders, Flyers and Oilers have been the most successful, winning at
least two Stanley Cup championships apiece.;      Hard times have hit the
Maple Leafs, Islanders and Flyers; none qualified for the playoffs last
season. But those teams haven't suffered as much in recent years as the
Nordiques, who have owned the league's worst record for three consecutive
seasons.; THE TOUGH GUYS; Not all players in the NHL are there because they
can score. Some are there because they can intimidate opponents and
occasionally beat them up.;      Dave "Tiger" Williams, who played in 962
games during 14 seasons with five NHL teams, is the leader in career penalty
minutes with 3,966. Other all-time penalty leaders include Chris Nilan (2,883
minutes in 12 seasons with three teams), Willi Plett (2,572 minutes in 12
seasons with four teams), Dale Hunter (2,471 minutes in 10 seasons with two
teams) and Dave Schultz (2,294 minutes in nine seasons with four teams).;
Nilan and Hunter still are active, with Boston and Washington, respectively.
Other heavyweights in the league today include Detroit's Bob Probert and Troy
Crowder, Buffalo's Rob Ray, Chicago's Mike Peluso and Stu Grimson and Los
Angeles' Marty McSorley and Jay Miller.; TODAY'S GREATS; Gretzky, the
superstar center of the Kings, is the NHL's all-time leader in scoring, with
2,142 points. But he isn't the only player in the league worth watching.;
Pittsburgh center Mario Lemieux was the league's most valuable player during
the 1987-88 season, center Mark Messier of Edmonton was the MVP during the
1989-90 season and right wing Brett Hull of St. Louis won the award last
season, when he scored 86 goals.;      Lemieux, Messier and Hull are the only
players besides Gretzky to be MVP since the 1979-80 season. The top 10 scorers
in the league last season were Gretzky, Hull, Adam Oates of St. Louis,
Pittsburgh's Mark Recchi, Hartford's John Cullen, Quebec's Joe Sakic,
Detroit's Steve Yzerman, Calgary's Theo Fleury and Al MacInnis and Chicago's
Steve Larmer. Each had at least 100 points last season.;   The list of players
to watch also includes Boston defenseman Ray Bourque (voted the league's best
defenseman four times in the past five seasons), L.A. left wing Luc Robitaille
(a 40-goal scorer in each of his five NHL seasons) and Chicago goalie Ed
Belfour (last season's Vezina Trophy winner as the No. 1 goalie in the league
and Calder Trophy winner as the rookie of the year).;      A dream-team lineup
of active NHL players might have Gretzky at center, Hull at right wing,
Robitaille at left wing, Bourque and MacInnis on defense and Belfour or
Patrick Roy of Montreal (a two-time Vezina Trophy winner) in goal.;
YESTERDAY'S HEROES; When Gretzky became the league's all-time leading scorer,
he broke a long-standing record held by Gordie Howe, who scored 1,850 points
in 26 seasons in the NHL, mostly with Detroit.;      A dream-team lineup of
former players might have Howe at right wing with Beliveau (507 goals in 20
seasons with Montreal) at center and Bobby Hull (1,170 points in 16 NHL
seasons, mostly with Chicago) at left wing. The defensemen might be Bobby Orr
(generally regarded as the best defenseman in NHL history after a brilliant
12-season career that he spent mostly with Boston) and Doug Harvey (a
seven-time winner of the Norris trophy during a 20-season career with
Montreal, the New York Rangers, Detroit and St. Louis). The goalie could be
Jacques Plante, a seven-time Vezina Trophy winner during an 18-season career.;
     Behind Gretzky and Howe in the top five on the league's all-time scoring
list are Marcel Dionne (1,771 points in 18 seasons with Detroit, L.A. and the
Rangers), Phil Esposito (1,590 points in 18 seasons, mostly with Boston) and
Stan Mikita (1,467 points in 22 seasons with Chicago).  </TEXT>

48TH GAME  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  NHL Roundup  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Craig Janney, Dave Christian, Jeff Lazaro and Wes Walz scored for Boston.;
NORTH STARS 7, BLUES 3: Brett Hull scored twice to return to a goal-a-game
pace, but Brian Bellows' two goals helped Minnesota beat St. Louis in
Bloomington, Minn.;    Hull has 48 goals in 48 games as he tries to become the
fifth NHL player to score 50 in 50 games.;  OILERS 4, KINGS 2: Mark Messier
and Esa Tikkanen each had a goal and two assists as Edmonton beat Los Angeles
in Edmonton, Alberta.;    A capacity crowd of 17,503 did not get to watch
ex-Oiler Wayne Gretzky. He was scratched, apparently because of a cold.;
FLYERS 4, FLAMES 3: Murray Craven and Scott Mellanby scored two goals apiece
as host Philadelphia defeated Calgary, snapping a six-game Spectrum losing
streak against the Flames.;    The last time Philadelphia defeated Calgary at
home was Dec. 11, 1986.;  CAPITALS 2, RED WINGS 1: Mike Ridley's goal at 3
minutes, 8 seconds of overtime gave Washington a victory in Detroit.;
Sheldon Kennedy scored in his first game of the season after missing Detroit's
first 48 games because of shoulder and elbow injuries.;  ISLANDERS 3, RANGERS
2: Ray Ferraro's fifth goal in his past six games helped the Islanders beat
the Rangers in Uniondale, N.Y.;    Rangers center Bernie Nicholls suffered a
dislocated left shoulder when he was going off the ice on a line change and
ran into the Islanders' Randy Wood. Nicholls landed on his shoulder.;    A
Rangers spokesman said Nicholls would undergo X-rays today to determine the
extent of the injury.;  PENGUINS 5, DEVILS 3: Mark Recchi scored two goals 17
seconds apart in the first period and host Pittsburgh beat New Jersey,
extending the Devils' winless streak to 11 games;  NORDIQUES 4, MAPLE LEAFS 4:
Mats Sundin scored his second goal on a power play with 1:43 left in the third
period, as host Quebec tied Toronto.;  ETC.: Chicago Blackhawks Coach and
General Manager Mike Keenan is expected to be named head coach and general
manager of Team Canada for this year's Canada Cup, according to the
tournament's chief decision-maker, Alan Eagleson. . . . Mario Lemieux,
sidelined all season by back pain, is still struggling with his endurance and
isn't ready to return to the Penguins' lineup, Coach Bob Johnson said. He
probably won't play until next week at the earliest.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  PROFESSIONAL; HOCKEY; PLAYOFF; SERIES; GAME; RESULT  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Petr Klima scored three times in a 5-minute, 13-second span of the first
period, the fastest playoff hat trick in Edmonton history, as the defending
champion Oilers defeated the visiting Minnesota North Stars 7-2 Saturday night
for a 1-1 tie in the Stanley Cup semifinals.;    The Oilers said before the
game that they would use their trademark speed to race past Minnesota, and
they did so in scoring four straight goals after Minnesota went ahead on Dave
Gagner's power-play goal 1:55 into the game.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  OILERS' FAST GUN SCORES 3
KLIMA RIDDLES STARS; EDMONTON TIES SERIES  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  NHL Roundup  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Klima personally made it 3-1 and broke the record of three goals in 10:41
set by Wayne Gretzky against Calgary on April 17, 1983. It was the fourth hat
trick of the season for Klima, who led the Oilers with a career-high 40
goals.;    Edmonton's victory was important because only six teams in NHL
history have rebounded after opening a series with two home losses. The Oilers
are now in much better position to contend for their sixth Stanley Cup in
eight years.;    Games 3 and 4 are Monday and Wednesday at the Met Center,
where the North Stars are 17-2-2 since Jan. 17, 5-1 in the playoffs and 2-0
vs. the Oilers this season.;  PENGUINS REELING: Crunch the numbers any way you
like, but the Pittsburgh Penguins' bottom line leaves little room for
interpretation.;    They trail the Boston Bruins 2-0 going into Game 3 of the
Wales Conference final tonight at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena.;    Winning
Games 3 and 4 would enable the Penguins to turn this into a best-of-three
series, but if Boston wins one, the Penguins' chances of getting to the
Stanley Cup final will be a long shot.  </TEXT>
