CALL-BOX DISPATCHERS FACE TANGLE OF TONGUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Orange County's year-old system of freeway telephones has a problem -- the 
dispatchers at California Highway Patrol headquarters in Santa Ana can't 
understand many of the callers. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,134 call boxes spaced every quarter of a mile along all the county's 
freeways received a record 13,500 calls last month. About 10% of the callers, 
as many as 100 on some days, spoke only foreign languages, mostly Spanish and 
Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
The dispatchers, however, speak only English. 
</P>
<P>
"From the start, the number of people calling in foreign languages has 
surprised us," said Todd Murphy, chairman of California SAFE (Service Authority 
for Freeway Emergencies), which handles wireless call boxes in California. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said that when the telephone service was launched last September, 
officials expected to receive some calls in Spanish but never anticipated the 
volume and diversity of foreign language calls. 
</P>
<P>
A translation center was retained to deal with non-English-speaking callers. 
When foreign language calls come into Santa Ana, the caller is patched into the 
translation facility -- Communications and Language Line, based in Monterey, 
Calif. -- and a three-way conversation takes place. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials say they receive more demands for translation from Orange 
County than anywhere else freeway phones are used. 
</P>
<P>
"From the very start we found that Orange County runs 30 to 40 different 
languages every month, about the same as in New York City," said Mike McFerrin, 
information manager for Communications and Language Line, which can translate 
in 143 languages. "We get more calls from call boxes in Orange County than we 
do from anywhere in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Although the center has had to deal with Orange County callers who speak only 
such languages as Romanian and Farsi, about half the foreign language calls are 
in Spanish. While they can still hook up by telephone with the translation 
service, Highway Patrol officials say they need Spanish speakers on staff to 
handle the 
</P>
<P>
heavy volume. 
</P>
<P>
"The translation service is great, but it's costly and slower than having 
somebody on hand," said Lt. Rick Criner, manager of the Santa Ana 
communications center. "We need somebody on staff. 
</P>
<P>
"It's much better to have bilingual people on hand rather than to try and sort 
things out over three telephone lines. They are faster and they can save lives 
if they know CHP policies and procedures." 
</P>
<P>
Criner said the telephone center has had difficulty attracting Spanish-speaking 
applicants and that CHP regulations have hampered the hiring of Spanish 
speakers. Under department rules, bilingual dispatchers can be paid more after 
they are hired but can only be given preference in hiring if they are among the 
top three candidates, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last January, the CHP allocated extra money to be paid to two Spanish-speaking 
dispatchers in the Santa Ana office, but so far none has been hired. In June, 
the department held its first ever bilingual test for dispatchers. Of 20 
applicants, four qualified and have been listed for hire, said CHP spokesman 
Keith Thornhill. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County began to install the call-box system in 1987 after the area's 26 
municipalities approved a $1 surcharge on motor vehicle registration to pay for 
it. About $5.4 million was spent just to install the telephones that went on 
line in June, 1988, and were completed last September. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other counties in California will be watching to see how Orange 
County deals with the problem. Although only Orange, San Diego and Los Angeles 
counties now have call boxes, more than a dozen other counties, including 
Riverside, expect to start the service in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
By 1991, though, there should be 15,000 call boxes in the state, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
"This system is the best we can do for now," said Murphy. "It helps drivers 
help themselves." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COUNTY CALL BOXES 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County call box system was the first in the state to begin operation 
under the California SAFE (Service Authority for Freeway Emergencies) program 
last June. Since then, California Highway Patrol authorities in Santa Ana have 
found that about 10% of the 8,000 to 13,000 calls each month are in languages 
operators can't understand without a translator. 
</P>
<P>
Total call boxes in O.C.: 1,124 
</P>
<P>
Calls per week: about 2,000 
</P>
<P>
Cost to build: $5.2 million 
</P>
<P>
Total calls requiring a translator in June: 828 
</P>
<P>
Average number of languages other than English each month: 30-40 
</P>
<P>
Full-time positions for answering call-box calls: 6

'NOT KNOWING' WEARS DOWN CALLERS TRYING TO GET THROUGH

The Brock family in San Clemente kept trying to get through. After 2 1/2 days, 
nerves were frazzled and worn thin. Then, late Thursday afternoon from Santa 
Cruz came the telephone call from Bob Brock's sister, who said: "We're safe. 
No, we didn't get hurt, and Mom's OK." 
</P>
<P>
Brock's sister, Betty Rucker, and his 90-year-old mother, Freda Brock, were 
emotionally shaken but safe after Tuesday's 6.9 temblor, which left much of 
downtown Santa Cruz in rubble. And Rucker herself had escaped injury because 
she left her work at a department store in the Santa Cruz mall about about an 
hour before the earthquake hit at 5:04 p.m. One woman died in the store, and 
another was critically injured when the roof collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Magdalena Ortega's vigil also ended Thursday when the Huntington Beach woman 
finally got word that both her nieces -- Maria Prado of Hollister and Lupe 
Palomares of San Jose, and their families -- were safe. "It was the fear of not 
knowing," a much-relieved Ortega said. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of other Orange County residents unable to reach relatives in 
quake-devastated Northern California jammed telephone lines to the local 
offices of the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army in hopes of getting 
news. 
</P>
<P>
But Red Cross officials in Santa Ana said Thursday that they have been 
powerless to try to reach loved ones in the San Francisco Bay Area on behalf of 
thousands of people who called them. 
</P>
<P>
"Our volunteers have just been overwhelmed with the flood of people calling in 
here. With no way to communicate to Northern California, we are, essentially, 
helping people wait," Red Cross spokeswoman Sylvia Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
And so the thousands of requests -- called "disaster welfare inquiries" -- from 
local residents to contact loved ones sat untouched in a bin at the Santa Ana 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"What we do is try and reassure family members down here. We're giving them 
options," Stewart said. "Like advising them to contact relatives in other 
states on the chance that they may have received word from relatives in San 
Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said contributions for quake relief reached $41,835 Thursday, up 300% 
from Wednesday. And more than 900 pints of blood had been collected in the 
first 24 hours after the quake, prompting the Red Cross to reduce its 
blood-donating hours on Friday and during the weekend, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we have no indication that we will be needing more blood," Stewart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Pacific Bell spokeswoman in Orange County said telephone service 
to the Bay Area had improved Thursday, but many people continued to experience 
difficulty calling the Santa Cruz and San Francisco areas. Pacific Bell 
officials continued to advise customers to call only if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"The network was clogged," said Linda Bonnicksen of Pacific Bell. "But the 
network came through OK. It's just that customers began picking up their 
telephones all at the same time and it almost collapsed our system. (But) more 
calls are going through more freely throughout the state." 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, where 80 bilingual Pacific Bell operators handled calls from 
throughout the state from Spanish-speaking customers, volume jumped 25% 
Wednesday, up from an average of 14,000 calls a day, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our operators talked to one man who had tried to reach his son in San Jose. 
The minute he heard the voice of one of our Spanish-speaking operators, he 
started crying. Apparently it had been a very frustrating time for him," 
Bonnicksen said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Brocks' days of frantic calls to Santa Cruz, it was Betty Rucker 
who finally reached them in San Clemente, said Rose-Marie Brock, adding: "She 
said that Tuesday's quake was a close call." 
</P>
<P>
"At least we know they're safe," Bob Brock said. 
</P>
<P>
Rucker, a saleswoman at Ford's Department Store in the downtown mall, told them 
she usually works until 5 p.m. But on Tuesday, she went in an hour earlier than 
usual and left about 4 p.m. When the earthquake struck little more than a hour 
later, the front of the building collapsed, killing one woman inside and 
critically injuring another on the sidewalk, the Brocks said. 
</P>
<P>
"My sister was upset because she couldn't get hold of me," he said. "Is she 
frightened? She doesn't even want to go back downtown to look at the rubble." 
</P>
<P>
Maria Prado told Magdalena Ortega and other relatives in Orange County that to 
call them, she had to drive to Gilroy from Hollister, where telephone service 
had been interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
Damage was extensive in Hollister, an older rural community with many 
wood-frame homes, she said.

PACIFIC BELL STARTS VIETNAMESE SERVICE

Vietnamese community leaders have been invited by Pacific Bell to help 
celebrate on Wednesday the opening of the telephone company's Vietnamese 
Service Center in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
The new center, which is part of the telephone company's Asian marketing plan, 
will have eight Vietnamese-speaking employees taking orders for residential 
telephone service and answering billing inquires in Orange, Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties, company spokeswoman Linda Bonniksen said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell will hold an open house at the center, which is in the Pacific 
Bell office complex in Tustin at 1472 Edinger Ave., in Room 2150 of Building 2. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese Service Center is expected to expand its services to include San 
Diego County in February and Los Angeles County in June. By 1990, the center 
expects to serve the estimated 278,000 Vietnamese living in California, said 
Reed L. Royalty, Pacific Bell area vice president.

ROLLING REMEDY FOR BIG ONE IS CHRISTENED BY PACIFIC BELL 
</P>

<P>
Pacific Bell on Monday christened a part of a $4-million "insurance policy" 
that company executives are gambling will keep phone lines open even if the Big 
One shakes Orange County to its foundation. 
</P>
<P>
A 48-foot-long tractor-trailer rig filled with banks of computers and digital 
phone equipment was officially rolled out by Pacific Bell officials, who touted 
the unit as a "potential lifesaver" in the event of a disaster such as a major 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The gleaming rig, nicknamed the Restoration Express, is the first 
self-contained phone center on wheels in the nation. American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph Co., for which it was made, says it can handle calls from up to 8,000 
phone lines at once without relying on a centralized office. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a complete central office that can be moved within a matter of hours 
to almost any location and start operating. It is unique," said Jim Jevicky, 
Southern California account executive for AT&amp;T. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell, which serves about 800,000 county customers, has ordered a second 
mobile phone center, as well as a smaller unit that can be airlifted to remote 
locations. One of the large rigs will be based somewhere in Orange County, the 
other 18-wheeler in Los Angeles County. The three mobile units -- which cost 
$1.7 million each for the two large ones and $600,000 for the smaller one -- 
are viewed by company officials as one of the cornerstones of its evolving 
disaster preparations. 
</P>
<P>
During last month's devastating Northern California earthquake, Pacific Bell's 
telephone network escaped widespread problems. Although several of the 
company's Bay Area offices were damaged in the 7.1-intensity temblor, none of 
the key computer components or switching equipment was wrecked. 
</P>
<P>
Service to the company's 2.5 million Bay Area customers was never down -- only 
interrupted by the crush of calls from friends and relatives outside the 
region, Pacific Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
But Pacific Bell officials are quick to note that the Oct. 17 quake was not the 
long-predicted, much-feared Big One. 
</P>
<P>
Should a more powerful temblor strike in Southern California, particularly on 
the Newport-Inglewood Fault running along coastal Orange County, phone company 
officials think that some of their three dozen local phone centers could be 
closed by damage to structures or switching equipment. 
</P>
<P>
That could sever phone service to some communities for hours, even days. 
</P>
<P>
But with the new mobile phone centers, service could be restored within an hour 
or two, said R.A. (Bob) Kohn, district manager of customer services for Pacific 
Bell's southern division. The units could be transported to the scene of a 
disaster or could operate from several miles away. If the local power is out, 
the mobile units can run on batteries or a diesel generator. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our insurance policy that during an emergency we can still provide some 
basic level of service," said Kohn at Pacific Bell's Tustin office, where 
executives christened the tractor-trailer rig by breaking two champagne bottles 
filled with confetti across its front. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't guarantee we will restore phone service to everyone -- that's not 
possible," Kohn said. "But we can provide access to a phone for many people in 
an affected area, by maintaining public phone lines through Red Cross shelters 
and other disaster centers." 
</P>
<P>
A crew of four can operate the highly sophisticated hardware and computer 
software that makes up the guts of this rolling nerve center. It is equipped 
with 13,000 feet of copper and fiber-optic cable that can tap into existing 
phone lines at a Pacific Bell facility or splice into underground lines. 
</P>
<P>
The rigs are outfitted to service up to 5,000 phone lines but can be modified 
to handle 3,000 more lines, Kohn said. Service priority would be given to 
emergency providers: police, fire, civil defense, hospitals and the military. 
</P>
<P>
Advances in computers and digital hardware have allowed designers to fit all 
the switching equipment into one such rig. In the past, the ability to set up 
remote phone-switching operations has existed, but two or three tractor-trailer 
rigs were often needed and a linkup with an existing phone center to relay 
calls outside the area was always needed. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike its forerunners, the Restoration Express can make long-distance and 
overseas calls directly without routing calls through another office. 
</P>
<P>
The existence of the mobile center should help Pacific Bell avoid what happened 
to an Illinois phone company in May, 1988. About 35,000 Illinois Bell customers 
were without phone service for nearly a month after a fire in a switching 
station, which housed computerized equipment that connected local and 
long-distance calls. 
</P>
<P>
"With this unit, we could roll into place and get service back to some of those 
customers in the same day," Kohn said. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Pacific Bell services about 88% of the residential and 
business phone customers that General Telephone Co. serves in Fountain Valley, 
Huntington Beach, Laguna Beach, Huntington Beach, Seal Beach and Westminster. A 
spokeswoman for Pacific Bell said an arrangement is being worked out that would 
allow General Telephone to use the Pacific Bell mobile center in a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Kohn said the mobile units will be used as training centers until needed in a 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"At $1.7 million a piece," Kohn said dryly, "they are a little expensive just 
to park and lock up."

GROUP REACHES OUT TO DISABLED CALLERS

A nonprofit organization in Anaheim has begun a publicity campaign to make 
handicapped people in Orange County aware of special telephone services that 
may be available to them free. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of good services for disabled people available in the state," 
said Brenda Premo, executive director of the Dayle McIntosh Center for the 
Disabled. "Unfortunately, the people who design these services don't think 
about the importance of marketing these services to the people who need them 
the most." 
</P>
<P>
Premo said Pacific Bell, General Telephone and other companies in the state are 
legally required to offer telephone services to the handicapped but that 
efforts to publicize the services have been poor. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of a $45,000 grant, the Dayle McIntosh Center has taken the 
matter into its own hands by starting a publicity campaign called "Dialog," 
which sends telephone company representatives to the community to give 
presentations on equipment and services. The center has also designed 
information posters for speech and hearing centers and rehabilitation hospitals 
throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
"Our grant money is helping us to reach out to people with disabilities, their 
families and the people they work with to let them know the kinds of services 
that are available to them," Premo said. 
</P>
<P>
Such services include a speaker phone, which allows a caller to talk into a 
microphone and hear the person on the other end without having to hold a 
receiver. For the visually impaired, large number overlays can be installed. 
Amplifiers are available for the hearing impaired, and for those who are deaf, 
a typewriter device connected to the telephone allows callers to type their 
messages to an operator, who relays it and types back a reply. Those who are 
both deaf and blind may be able to receive a Braille version of this device. 
</P>

"We have everything from an amplifier for Grandma to a special telephone that a 
person with only head movement can activate by puffing on a switch," said Joy 
Tyo, manager of disabled services at Pacific Bell. "I think this is an exciting 
time. Equipment is now very small and compact because of rapid advances in 
computer technology. I think it's only going to get easier and easier for the 
disabled population to use the telephone and experience that independence that 
we all depend on." 
</P>
<P>
To apply for disabled telephone services, call Pacific Bell, Deaf and Disabled 
Services, 1-800-772-3140 or the General Telephone Special Needs Center, 
1-800-821-2585.

VIETNAMESE BILLED FOR UNNEEDED PHONE SERVICES GET HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baffled that their telephone bills seemed astronomical in past months, many 
Vietnamese students enrolled in a job-training program for Southeast Asians in 
San Diego have been showing their bills to their English-speaking instructors 
in hopes of getting an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew they shouldn't have such huge phone bills," said Beverley Yip, 
director of the Union of Pan Asian Communities, a San Diego-based support group 
that provides job training. "The students were being billed for things like 
call waiting and call forwarding -- a whole package that they didn't need or 
want. Some had special rates for calling Imperial County, even though they 
didn't know anyone there." 
</P>
<P>
Since Feb. 14, however, eight Pacific Bell service representatives who speak 
English and Vietnamese have been helping Vietnamese customers decipher their 
phone bills and, in some cases, obtain refunds for those who paid for services 
they didn't need and didn't realize they had ordered. Pacific Bell's Vietnamese 
Service Center opened in Tustin in December and began serving San Diego County 
on Feb. 14. Officials plan to begin serving Los Angeles County later this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charged for Unneeded Services 
</P>
<P>
Many of San Diego County's 25,000 to 30,000 Vietnamese residents have been 
charged for the unnecessary services because of poor communication with 
English-speaking service representatives, said Yip, who sits on a Pacific Bell 
special advisory committee for the Asian market. Yip said about half of all 
Vietnamese in the county can speak English fluently. 
</P>
<P>
Many Vietnamese customers who speak English still prefer to speak Vietnamese 
"when it comes to ordering something as complicated and technological as 
telephone service," a Pacific Bell spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The representatives take orders for new service, add or change existing 
features, answer bill-related questions and help customers choose which phone 
package best meets their needs. Vietnamese customers' calls are transferred to 
the Vietnamese Service Center when they call Pacific Bell's general business 
number and indicate they speak Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
The weekday service, which Pacific Bell officials say might begin statewide 
later this year, is part of the Pacific Bell Asian Market Plan, which was 
adopted in 1987 after the company analyzed the demographics, language needs and 
life styles of Asians in California. The company also provides services for 
Spanish, Korean and Chinese-speaking customers. 
</P>
<P>
"This service makes good business sense to Pacific Bell," Yip said.

AT PACIFIC BELL, THE LATINO LINE'S BUSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY ENG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The phones ring 14,000 times a day in a nondescript office building in downtown 
Santa Ana. And every caller is someone speaking Spanish, in need of a 
translator. 
</P>
<P>
This is Pacific Bell's Language Assistance Bureau, a hubbub of computerized 
switchboards and 90 bilingual operators who field calls en espanol from all 
over the state. If a woman in San Jose calls 611 for repairs but can't 
communicate, she is patched through to Santa Ana within seconds. If a man in 
Santa Barbara needs a phone number but can't ask in English, his call is routed 
south. 
</P>
<P>
The Language Assistance Bureau, the only one of its kind in the state, is open 
seven days a week, 24 hours a day. Inside, the modern-looking bureau is busy 
but hushed. There are no buzzers or bells; each incoming call is signaled by a 
flashing light. Conversations are peppered with the word gracias. 
</P>
<P>
The calls transferred to the bureau vary from simple requests to reports of 
emergencies that require split-second decisions by the operators. 
</P>
<P>
One operator, Lando Silva, remembers a call that left him shaking afterward. A 
woman from Los Angeles dialed 0, screaming for help because her husband 
threatened to beat her up. The Los Angeles operator, who could not speak 
Spanish, patched the call to Silva, who kept the woman on the line to get more 
information. The two operators managed to find out where the woman lived and 
sent the police to her home. 
</P>
<P>
"That was so stressful, I almost couldn't talk afterwards," said Silva, who has 
worked in the bureau for nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
Another time, operator Marty Nelson received a call from a frightened 
3-year-old girl who was left alone in the house with her younger sibling. The 
girl dialed 0 for an operator because she thought she heard a noise in the 
house. The operator, who couldn't speak Spanish, established a three-way 
conversation with Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to calm her down and keep her on the line so the police could trace her 
call. She was so scared," said Nelson. The police found the girl, who was 
unhurt but shaken. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said she went home that day and gave her own 10-year-old extra hugs. 
</P>
<P>
The operators, who range in age from 17 to 65, take an average of 250 calls a 
day. Some of them specialize in particular Spanish dialects -- Cuban or Costa 
Rican Spanish, for example. Callers who need help in other languages, such as 
Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese, are referred to other centers for ordering 
telephones or requesting repairs, but the telephone company does not provide 
translators for directory assistance and other operator services. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the calls forwarded to the bureau are less dramatic than the memorable 
pleas for help. They tend to deal with simple requests, such as finding phone 
numbers for residents or businesses. 
</P>
<P>
But some requests are more difficult for the bilingual operators. For example, 
many of their calls involve taking part in a three-way conversation with 
another operator or a repair worker to help a Spanish speaker who cannot 
understand English instructions. And there are times when the operators have to 
be sources of news and reassurance to their callers. 
</P>
<P>
When the San Francisco Bay Area was jolted by a 7.1 temblor on Oct. 17, many of 
the operators had to break the news of the earthquake to callers, who could not 
reach their families because the lines were busy or out of order. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to tell the callers not to dial their relatives and friends, no matter 
how much they wanted to. We had to convince them not to tie up the lines," 
Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
The operators, almost half of whom live outside Orange County, must pass 
Pacific Bell's regular test for employment as well as qualify in language 
fluency. 
</P>
<P>
Working at the Language Assistance Bureau gives the bilingual operators a 
chance to work for the Latino community, said Rosemary F. Padilla, who 
co-manages the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a job where many of the operators can help out people who really need 
their bilingual skills," Padilla said. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of area codes cannot be patched to the Language Assistance Bureau 
because Pacific Bell does not have the technology to provide the translation 
services to some cities, said Linda Bonniksen, a Pacific Bell spokeswoman. For 
example, Spanish speakers in the 818 and parts of the 415 areas can be helped 
with repair service, but cannot be transferred for directory assistance 
translation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
For the operators, the busiest day of the year traditionally is May 10, Dia de 
las Madres, which is the Mexican Mother's Day. On that day, operators take one 
call after another. 
</P>
<P>
But the job can often be amusing. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, the man who needed help in making a long-distance call. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson told the man to dial "00," for the long-distance operator. The caller 
told Nelson to hold on. She then heard several seconds of fumbling. 
</P>
<P>
The caller then told Nelson that he couldn't make a long distance call because 
he didn't have a "00" button on his phone. 
</P>
<P>
And there are always requests for the home phone numbers of internationally 
known Latino movie stars and musicians.

including the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia --
were unable to complete calls unless they were dialing nearby phones or long

D.C.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Bell Atlantic Corp., the parent company of the C&amp;P companies, reported that
by 8 p.m. the system was back up and running, with a few scattered outages.;  
 Initial reports suggested the problem involved computer software, part of a
technology known as Signaling System 7, that is being installed to complete
calls more quickly and to allow new functions, such as Caller ID, to be added
to telephones.;    C&amp;P officials ruled out sabotage, computer hackers or
software viruses.;    By a strange coincidence, a similar problem was
occurring on the West Coast. From about 10:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. PDT, 3 million
telephone lines served by Pacific Bell broke down, leaving callers unable to
dial across town or long distance.;    A spokesman for Pacific Bell said there
was a buildup of calls in its Signaling System 7 computer, the same type of
system used by C&amp;P. Service was disrupted in much of the 213, 818, 714 and 805
area codes.;    "It seems like our software just decided to take the day off,"
said Pacific Bell spokeswoman Linda Bonniksen in Orange County.;    Pacific
Bell officials said most service was restored by midafternoon.;    The
failures ranked among the largest ever to hit the U.S. telephone industry.;   
The Washington region's paralysis, which extended south to Richmond, north to
Baltimore and west to West Virginia, created an eerie interval of isolation
for people accustomed to instant communications.;    Federal government
agencies operating on their own network were able to place calls, but some had
difficulty receiving calls. The White House, the Pentagon, the FBI and the
Capitol appeared to function normally.  </TEXT>

OC DISASTER PREPAREDNESS, MILITARY UNITS EXTEND HELP 
</P>

<P>
In the wake of the catastrophic earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay Area 
Tuesday, Orange County's disaster preparedness agencies and the military 
mobilized today to provide relief to the shattered Northern California 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
Among the first to go was the California Army National Guard's 143rd Combat 
Support Hospital based in Los Alamitos. At least 11 doctors, nurses and medics, 
along with tents, tables and beds, were loaded onto a C-130 transport Tuesday 
night bound for Travis Air Force Base near Sacramento, where the unit will 
await further assignment. This morning, helicopters and crews from the 140th 
Aviation Battalion at Los Alamitos also was sent to provide medical evacuation 
services for the hospital unit set up at Travis Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 10,000 callers swamped 38 telephone lines at the Orange 
County Chapter of the American Red Cross in Santa Ana, which is seeking 
donations, and local utilities and fire departments have volunteered repair and 
emergency crews. Red Cross spokeswoman Sylvia Stewart said 25 lines are being 
installed to accommodate callers from throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
This morning, at least 100 volunteers also arrived at Red Cross offices 
offering to give blood or help in the relief effort. Stewart said 290 pints of 
blood were sent by the Orange County chapter to the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart said the Red Cross is suggesting that local residents wanting to help 
in the relief effort donate money to the national organization's disaster fund, 
which was depleted by Hurricane Hugo in September. 
</P>
<P>
Donations can be sent to the American Red Cross, Orange County Chapter, 601 N. 
Golden Circle Dr., Santa Ana, Calif., 92711. Contributors should mark 
"earthquake" on donation checks. Food and blankets also will be accepted, 
Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
Also on standby is Orange County Fire Department's heavy rescue team, a group 
of trained rescue workers and fire engines. It is awaiting word from the state 
Office of Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Fire Chief Ken MacLeod said the department's four-man rescue squad was 
dispatched to Mexico City several years ago during that city's major earthquake 
to aid in finding survivors amid the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Southern California Edison Co. in Orange County contacted 
communities in the Bay Area and offered to provide materials, repair crews and 
engineering assistance to help restore power.

COUNTY TO FEEL THE FULL IMPACT OF PACIFIC BELL STRIKE TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A statewide strike against Pacific Bell delayed directory assistance calls and 
idled nearly 5,000 Orange County telephone workers Sunday as some managers 
spent the day learning how to be operators and pay-phone collectors. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Communications Workers of America, Local 9510, posted 
pickets at phone company offices from Anaheim to Tustin on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But both union leaders and telephone company managers said the strike's real 
test would come this morning from 6 to 10 a.m. when most employees are supposed 
to report to work. 
</P>
<P>
Monday "is the critical day and there'll be 4,000 to 5,000 members out there 
picketing," vowed Del McBryde president of CWA's Local 9510. 
</P>
<P>
McBryde warned that telephone customers will probably feel the widening impact 
of the strike today with delays in reaching operators, difficulty in placing 
operator-assisted calls and continuing problems with directory assistance. 
</P>
<P>
But Pacific Bell officials promised business would be close to normal because 
so much of their system is fully automated. 
</P>
<P>
"You can still call the world -- if you know how to dial," said Gary Cuccio, 
general manager of customer services in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell serves 640,000 residential and 903,000 business customers in 
Orange County, covering every community except Seal Beach, Fountain Valley, 
Huntington Beach, Laguna Beach, Seal Beach and Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
During the strike, telephone repairs should occur within a day, just as they 
did before the job action, Cuccio said, but telephone installations may now 
take five or six days instead of the usual two or three. 
</P>
<P>
Added John H. Adair, director of customer access services for Pacific Bell's 
Southern California region, "if you want an installation in your residence, 
you'll probably be in pretty good shape. But it's not going to be quick." 
</P>
<P>
Though operators, repairmen and other crafts are on strike, Pacific Bell's 955 
managers in Orange County are trained to replace them and another 350 managers 
from the company's Oakland office have flown in to help, company officials 
said. All are going to be working 12-hour shifts. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 of them went to school Sunday in Tustin, Buena Park and Garden Grove, 
learning to work as telephone operators or collect coins from pay phones. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's picketing was peaceful, both management and union representatives 
said, but the two parties differed sharply on how many locations were picketed. 
Cuccio cited pickets at eight spots, while union leader McBryde said his 
members went to 28. 
</P>
<P>
The day's only incident occured before dawn when Gary Fleer, a Pacific Bell 
manager at the company's Garden Grove office on Euclid Street, said someone had 
tossed an egg at his car. 
</P>
<P>
Cuccio said site managers early Sunday morning changed the locks at all 53 work 
sites in Orange County as a precaution to protect valuable switching equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Cuccio said that the longer the strike continues "there'll be a slight 
deterioration" in service. Instead of repairing a phone in one day, that job 
may take two days, he said. Also, he said, "if we get some major damage -- a 
tropical storm or a large cable cut -- it won't go as fast. . . . No doubt 
about it, that's a substantial work force we've lost." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday morning, callers who tried directory assistance lines repeatedly had 
difficulty getting through. Calls were answered with a recorded message that 
said, "We're sorry. Because of a work stoppage the operator will be delayed in 
helping you." Several callers reported that it took at least five minutes for 
an information operator to come on the line. But by late Sunday afternoon, some 
directory assistance calls got through in just under three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides in the strike seemed to consider Sunday a practice run for today, a 
full-fledged work day, when customers would demand more operator assistance, 
more repairs, new installations, and help with bills. 
</P>
<P>
Preparing for that event, a dozen Pacific Bell executives, some wearing shorts 
and sneakers, went to coin-collecting school. 
</P>
<P>
They huddled around a partly disassembled pay telephone as instructor Bill 
Spencer advised them on the "rhythm" of opening up a phone, removing the coin 
box, emptying the money and closing the phone again. 
</P>
<P>
But if they occasionally joked with Spencer about their new jobs, they turned 
serious when they talked of the strike. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate," said Cecelia Annas, 43, the account executive. "I don't 
think either side will win it." 
</P>
<P>
Added director of customer access services John Adair, who was supervising the 
class: "We'd rather not have a work stoppage. It's really very unpleasant. 
We're prepared to step up and try and maintain service as best we can -- but 
we'd rather be doing other things on a Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
Out on the picket lines in Garden Grove, telephone operator Luann Nelson, 29, 
agreed, saying she was "not real thrilled" with the strike either. 
</P>
<P>
A single mother with a 3-year-old daughter, Nelson said she was worried about 
paying bills during the strike, even though she supports her union's 
objectives. 
</P>
<P>
"This job is high stress," she said. "The one good thing is the benefits, and 
now they're trying to take them away."

PACIFIC TELESIS WILL CUT 11,000 JOBS OVER FIVE YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: THE COMPANY SAYS THE COMPETITION-CAUSED REDUCTIONS WILL COME MAINLY FROM 
ITS PACIFIC BELL LOCAL TELEPHONE SUBSIDIARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pacific Telesis Group said Thursday that it will pare 11,000 of its 69,000 jobs 
-- 16% of the work force -- over the next five years to cut costs amid 
increased competition and new labor-saving technology. 
</P>
<P>
The company, the state's largest private employer, said the job cuts will come 
almost entirely from its Pacific Bell local telephone subsidiary. It said the 
reductions will be achieved through early-retirement incentives, retraining and 
attrition, but a job-seeking service will also be set up for employees 
accepting severance pay and leaving the company. 
</P>
<P>
Which jobs will be axed -- and how heavily the cuts will fall on Pacific Bell's 
28,000 Southern California employees -- remains to be determined, a spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts are among the largest in a series of reductions that have pared 17,000 
jobs from Pacific Telesis since it was created in 1984 as one of seven regional 
holding companies spun off from giant American Telephone &amp; Telegraph as 
part of an antitrust settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Telesis attributed the latest cuts to increased competition from 
upstart telephone firms that are chipping away at its monopoly and taking away 
some of its largest customers. In addition, new labor-saving telecommunications 
technology is making many jobs unneeded. 
</P>
<P>
"One person can do the job of three or four," observed Stuart Crane, an analyst 
with Gruntal &amp; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts also stem from a new California regulatory system that provides 
Pacific Bell incentives to reduce costs to increase profits. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying out the job-reduction program, including costs of early-retirement 
incentives, will not have a significant impact on profits, Pacific Telesis 
said. Analysts also noted that the cutback is not a sign of financial 
difficulty at the San Francisco-based firm, which is among the strongest of the 
so-called Baby Bells spun off from AT&amp;T. 
</P>
<P>
All but 50 of the jobs to be cut will come from giant Pacific Bell. The other 
50 jobs are to be cut during 1990 from Pacific Telesis' present headquarters 
staff of about 400. 
</P>
<P>
"Staffing requirements change over time in this dynamic industry," said Pacific 
Bell President Phil Quigley. "What was appropriate in 1989 clearly will not be 
in 1994." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell will lose about 7,600 non-salaried jobs and 3,400 management 
positions, he said. The job cuts do not affect Pacific Telesis' unregulated 
ventures, which are grouped under PacTel Corp. These include PacTel Cellular in 
Costa Mesa, PacTel Paging, Pacific Telesis International, PacTel Business 
Systems and PacTel Properties. 
</P>
<P>
Some layoffs will probably prove inevitable, the company acknowledged, but 
Pacific Telesis will try to minimize that by offering incentives for veteran 
employees to retire early by adding three years to both their service and their 
age in calculating pension benefits. That incentive trimmed a third of the 
management staff of Nevada Bell, a Pacific Telesis subsidiary that serves the 
Reno area. Other employees in jobs identified as surplus will be offered 
training for other posts or assignment to lower-ranking slots, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to operate even more efficiently in the 1990s, so we can deliver 
the maximum benefits to our customers and share-owners," said Sam Ginn, Pacific 
Telesis' chairman and chief executive. "Looking ahead, we remain keenly focused 
on our customers and the need to streamline operations so we can meet the 
challenges of increasing competition." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts generally welcomed the announcement but said it was no surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"The driving force of the telecommunications industry is technology," said 
analyst Crane of Gruntal &amp; Co. "Switches today are gigantic computers that 
are highly automated. They do almost anything. So all you need is people to 
supervise these massive machines and keep an eye on them." 
</P>
<P>
Another incentive to cut costs stems from a new regulatory system in California 
that requires Pacific Bell to lower costs by 4.5% a year to reflect anticipated 
labor-saving improvements from new technology. But the new system also allows 
the company to earn more, if it can, than was possible under the old system, 
which set a tight limit on profits. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, despite their present monopoly in providing local telephone service, 
Pacific Bell and the other Baby Bells already are losing some business from 
major customers, mainly financial services firms. These companies are either 
erecting microwave towers to create their own private phone system, or 
contracting with Pacific Bell or a growing number of newcomers that provide 
private links for them. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, this traffic bypasses the "public network" that most businesses and 
residential customers depend on. 
</P>
<P>
This bypassing was encouraged in California and some other states, including 
New York, when regulators opened one area of the monopoly to competition -- the 
lucrative high-speed transmission of data. Moreover, the California Public 
Utilities Commission this year will consider prying open other areas of the 
local monopoly. And the Federal Communications Commission and Congress are 
re-examining national cable television law, which presently forbids local phone 
companies to carry cable television in their service areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We may see in the next decade, more than one (local) phone company serving an 
area," suggested Steve Sazebari of the Dataquest research firm in San Jose. "In 
any case, they have to be more competitive in price and quality, so basically 
they have to cut costs." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell serve nearly 22 million people in California and 
the Reno area.

<TEXT>     Bell Atlantic Corp., the parent company of the C&amp;P companies, reported that
by 8 p.m. the system was back up and running, with a few scattered outages.;  
 Initial reports suggested the problem involved computer software, part of a
system that is being installed to complete calls more quickly and to allow new
functions, such as Caller ID, to be added to telephones.;    By a strange
coincidence, a similar problem was occurring on the West Coast. From about
10:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. PDT, 3 million telephone lines served by Pacific Bell
broke down, leaving callers unable to dial across town or long distance.;    A
spokesman for Pacific Bell said there was a buildup of calls in its Signaling
System 7 computer, the same type of system used by C&amp;P. Service was disrupted
in the 213, 818, 714 and 805 area codes.;    "It seems like our software just
decided to take the day off," said Pacific Bell spokeswoman Linda Bonniksen in
Orange County.;    Officials said most service was restored by midafternoon.  </TEXT>

PACIFIC BELL USERS WILL GET $5-MILLION REFUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of Pacific Bell's rural customers are expected to share about $5 
million in refunds this summer under a quietly negotiated tentative settlement 
of a complaint accusing the company of charging customers for push-button 
telephone service that it never provided. 
</P>
<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission approved the proposed settlement in 
secret session on Friday but issued no press release, apparently at Pacific 
Bell's request. The action comes less than three years after the PUC ordered 
the phone company to refund millions of dollars to customers pressured into 
buying services that they neither needed nor wanted. 
</P>
<P>
For the $5-million settlement, Pacific Bell customers can thank George Sawaya, 
a retired senior auditor in the Downey office of the State Board of 
Equalization. A resident of the Sierra foothill hamlet of Pollock Pines since 
1981, Sawaya has led the three-year battle for compensation for the wrongly 
charged phone customers. 
</P>
<P>
As Sawaya explained Tuesday, he decided to sign up for Pacific Bell's "Touch 
Tone" service in 1985 after the company sent him, along with his monthly phone 
bill, a list of available extra services and their prices. The mailing said 
Touch Tone service "places your calls faster than a rotary-dial phone can," a 
feature that Sawaya wanted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Marketing Abuse' Charged 
</P>
<P>
But after Sawaya paid a $5 sign-up charge for the service and agreed to pay an 
extra $1.20 a month for it, he found no improvement. After calling Pacific 
Bell's local office, he learned that the older, non-digital switch serving much 
of El Dorado County could not provide full Touch Tone service. He cancelled the 
service and Pacific Bell refunded his payments. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Sawaya said, he thought about his neighbors served by the same 
electromechanical switch, along with the 30% of Pacific Bell customers then 
served by similar equipment. So in January, 1986, he filed a class-action 
complaint with the PUC. 
</P>
<P>
At the subsequent hearing, Sawaya described the literature describing Touch 
Tone as "deceptive or misleading." He called it "a form of marketing abuse not 
unlike others which have recently been under consideration by the Public 
Utilities Commission." 
</P>
<P>
Sawaya was referring to a PUC finding in August, 1986, that Pacific Bell had 
intentionally engaged in abusive sales techniques. Among other things, its 
agents, working under a quota system, improperly sold basic telephone service 
with such extras as call-forwarding and call-waiting. Some customers claimed 
that the Pacific Bell sales pitches misled them into believing that such 
services were not available individually or that they could not get basic 
telephone service without them. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC made Pacific Bell offer refunds, at a cost to the company of more than 
$40 million, to affected customers. It also was required to contribute to a 
consumer-education fund. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sawaya Persevered 
</P>
<P>
A major difference between the marketing-abuse case and the recent one, Sawaya 
pointed out, was that in the first case the company was at least providing the 
services for which it was billing customers. 
</P>
<P>
At Sawaya's 1986 hearing, a senior Pacific Bell engineer, Loren Wedel, 
testified that there was no physical change in Sawaya's service as a result of 
his having signed up for Touch Tone service. Only billing records were changed, 
the engineer confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the PUC dismissed the case on the technical grounds that because 
Sawaya had obtained a refund, he could not intervene on behalf of other 
customers in a class-action complaint. Undeterred, Sawaya asked for a 
rehearing. 
</P>
<P>
That rehearing petition was dismissed behind closed doors on Friday. But in 
exchange, Pacific Bell assured the commissioners that it would submit a plan to 
refund "about $5 million" to customers in Sawaya's circumstances -- a 
settlement Sawaya viewed "positively." It also agreed not to charge them in the 
future for Touch Tone service, which is now available to Pollock Pines 
customers.

<P>
Striking phone workers set up picket lines outside many of Pacific Bell's 53 
Orange County facilities Monday as a strike by the Communication Workers of 
America union on both coasts entered its first business day with no sign of 
progress toward settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as it takes, we're ready to stay out here," said Mary Balis, an 
operator who had gathered with fellow workers outside a Pacific Bell building 
on Euclid Street in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Cross Picket Lines 
</P>
<P>
A union official said that up to 2,000 striking operators, technicians and 
other workers showed up to picket and that fewer than 100 people crossed picket 
lines. A spokeswoman for Pacific Bell, which serves 731,000 customers in Orange 
County, said that only a handful of union operators showed up for work. 
</P>
<P>
Sign-waving strikers in Orange County reported peaceful protests Monday. 
Company and union officials monitoring the picket lines said there was 
scattered heckling between pickets and people crossing their lines. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the country, there were reports of minor picket-line violence 
among the 157,000 phone workers who walked out over the weekend. A dozen 
striking workers were arrested in Boston Monday and some scuffling was reported 
at a Pacific Bell billing office and switching center in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
The strike is against three so-called "Baby Bell" companies that supply local 
phone service along much of the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. The automated 
networks continued working as usual at Pacific Bell, at NYNEX's phone companies 
in New York and New England and at Bell Atlantic, whose subsidiaries serve the 
Mid-Atlantic states and the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delays of Up to 5 Minutes 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the strike, which has idled nearly 5,000 workers, slowed 
directory assistance, operator help and other telephone services. Delays of up 
to five minutes were reported on 411 calls. 
</P>
<P>
"Service is not what customers would expect on a day-to-day basis," said Linda 
Bonniksen, a Pacific Bell spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
As the strike goes on, Orange County customers can expect little or no effect 
on direct-dial calls but delays in operator service, directory assistance and 
repair requests, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Customers are postponing calling in for new service," Bonniksen said. "They're 
pretty much realizing our limitations." 
</P>
<P>
The company's 955 managers in Orange County have been trained to replace 
striking workers, Bonniksen said, and 350 other managers from the company's 
Oakland headquarters arrived Monday to pitch in as operators, maintenance 
personnel and coin collectors. All are scheduled to work 12-hour shifts, six 
days a week. 
</P>
<P>
At issue are wages and health care. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials said they would like to see the company pay a larger share of 
recent increases in health insurance costs and reduce the compensation gap 
between the highest-paying jobs, dominated by men, and the lowest-paying jobs 
-- such as operators -- most of which are held by women. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte Durbin, executive vice president of Local 9510, said that worker 
productivity has gone up but that the company's "retrogressive" offer of a 
10.93% pay raise over the next three years won't match cost-of-living 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not a lot of real money," Durbin said. 
</P>
<P>
Bell spokeswoman Bonniksen said Monday that the strike could have been avoided 
if the union had weighed more carefully what the company described as a 
"generous" contract offer that includes increased medical benefits. 
</P>
<P>
At the company's offices in Tustin Monday, an emergency operations center 
normally reserved for disasters such as earthquakes handled calls from other 
offices needing help to keep up with demand. 
</P>
<P>
In an emergency, the room has enough food for three months and comes complete 
with cots and ham radios. But on Monday, it took on a quieter pace, as 
supervisors calmly made sure operations wouldn't crumble as just 20% of all 
positions were filled by managers, said Gary Cuccio, Orange County's customer 
services general manager for Pacific Bell. (With managers working 72-hour 
weeks, 40% of total manpower needs are being covered, Cuccio said.) 
</P>
<P>
Cuccio, who traded his desk for a climb on Newport Beach telephone polls 
Monday, said customers can expect repairs to take a day and installation from 
three to five days. They were advised to save time by looking up numbers and 
avoid making collect calls, if possible. 
</P>
<P>
Upstairs, some newly christened operators wore name tags to get acquainted with 
fellow workers. 
</P>
<P>
Managers who learned the job in one day rather than the usual seven said their 
new jobs give them an opportunity to learn more about the business. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been interesting -- a side of the business I haven't worked on," said 
operator Arlene Steinert. "We're all very cautious, though." 
</P>
<P>
Out on the street in front of Pacific Bell's Garden Grove facility, things were 
a little noisier. 
</P>
<P>
During the morning rush hour, many motorists honked and raised their fists in 
support of the striking workers who paraded in front of the building waving 
their signs. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be out here; we'd just as soon be in there," striker Balis 
said. "We'd just like to get a piece of the pie we helped create." 
</P>
<P>
Operator Larry Cain, a single father with two children, said he cannot afford 
to carry on without an additional increase this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I at least want to stay even with the cost of living," he said, taking a break 
from picketing. 
</P>
<P>
Cain, a three-year employee, said pickets are dedicated and intend to stay out 
on strike as long as possible. Referring to his children, Cain said: "Whatever 
I give here is going to help them." 
</P>
<P>
Wesley Wyscarver, who doesn't work for the phone company but is a friend of a 
striking worker, joined her in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm supporting a local cause," said Wyscarver, lounging on a beach chair next 
to a clump of empty soda cans and signs that read, "Their profits are off the 
chart. Now, it's our turn." 
</P>
<P>
"If they lose, we all lose."

<LEADPARA>  Regarding "So go phone subsidies" (Editorials, Oct. 28), competition is not
the enemy here.;   California today is partitioned into 10 regions called
LATAs (Local Access Transport Areas). Calling within these LATAs -- say from
Mendocino to Morgan Hill -- you cannot choose who carries your telephone
calls. Your calls are monopolized by the local carriers like Pacific Bell and
you pay their going rate.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  COMPETITION ISN'T THE CULPRIT IN RATE HIKES  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Letters to the editor  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Allowing competition for intraLATA calling would bring about lower prices,
increased consumer choice, and a wealth of new services and technology to the
public.;   Recently, Pacific Bell and GTE-California requested California
Public Utilities Commission approval to increase the rates they charge for
basic local telephone service (the flat charge to provide service to your home
or business), coupled with reductions in their intraLATA toll rates. PacBell
and GTE say these changes are necessary because of the anticipated pricing
pressure that will be brought about by competition in the LATAs.;   That's
simply not true.;   History shows that rates for basic local telephone service
need not increase as a result of intraLATA competition. In the 29 states that
have authorized competition for intraLATA calls, there is no evidence that
competition has caused rates for basic local telephone service to increase.
Meanwhile, in those same states, long distance rates have fallen.;   I am also
concerned about the indictment that long distance carriers are "swiping"
toll-call business from the local carriers. When Pac Bell recently complained
of this; the CPUC said Pac Bell had not proven its case and denied its request
for an injunction against certain long distance carriers.;   The benefits of
true competition are clear. Don't let your freedom of choice for in-state
calling be held hostage in exchange for higher local telephone charges.;   --

TEMBLOR SPURS REVIEWS OF ORANGE COUNTY'S PLANNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM and ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Top Orange County officials vowed Tuesday night to immediately begin reviewing 
the county's earthquake preparedness plan, acknowledging that the county is not 
ready for a disaster such as the one that hit the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
"If that quake had struck Orange County, we'd have similar problems," said 
Christine Boyd, manager of the county's disaster planning agency. "We've taken 
some steps to get ready, but we've got a ways to go. This serves as a good 
lesson, and hopefully it will push to get us going." 
</P>
<P>
County Administrative Officer Larry A. Parrish said he told key members of his 
staff by telephone late Tuesday to review the county's preparedness plans. But 
Parrish would not predict whether the 6.9-magnitude quake in the Bay Area will 
mean more local money for countywide emergency preparedness. He would say only 
that the disaster may have a "very sobering effect on our financial 
priorities." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, a sweeping plan designed specifically to help the county prepare for 
such a calamity was created. Known as the Southern California Emergency 
Preparedness Project, the plan covers everything from educating the public on 
how to prepare for a major quake to deployment of equipment, medical supplies 
and volunteers during such a catastrophe. But so far, the county has spent less 
than $300,000 on the plan, which Parrish said would cost about $12 million to 
implement fully. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point," Parrish said, "it's not within our capacity. . . . The 
temptation there is to say whatever it takes, we'll spend it. But perspective 
is critical. I just think we need a little time to assess what's worked and 
what hasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, while supporting Parrish's 
review of the county's response plans, said that paying for such preparations 
is difficult in light of the county's fiscal condition and pressing needs. 
</P>
<P>
"The amounts of money you're talking about make it very difficult to finance," 
Riley said. "You got jails. You've also got the homeless. You've got 
innumerable projects that are crying out (for county money). These have greater 
appeal to all of us. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess most of us think it can't happen to us. You just hope it doesn't 
happen here," he added. 
</P>
<P>
But Boyd, manager of the county's Emergency Management Division, said the Bay 
Area quake serves as a graphic lesson that she hopes will stir commitment to 
local preparedness efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that if anything constructive can come out of this tragedy, it's that 
people must prepare," Boyd said. "The San Andreas Fault is not exclusive to the 
Bay Area. It can happen here, and we've got to redouble our efforts to get 
ready." 
</P>
<P>
The San Andreas passes about 30 miles northeast of the Los Angeles Basin. But 
many earthquake experts say Orange County residents face an even greater threat 
from the Newport-Inglewood Fault, which travels along the county coast from 
Newport Beach to Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
A cadre of county emergency officials, from utility managers to physicians, 
were preparing Tuesday night to lend assistance to the quake-relief effort in 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
The National Guard's 40th Division, based in Los Alamitos, has been placed on 
alert, but no troops or equipment have yet been dispatched to aid in quake 
relief, a National Guard spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd's agency sent one of its senior coordinators to the Bay Area to observe 
recovery operations. County fire officials were on alert, prepared to send 
medical and fire equipment as well as volunteers to quake-stricken areas. 
</P>
<P>
The local Red Cross chapter opened its emergency disaster center in Santa Ana 
to answer calls from county residents concerned about friends and relatives in 
the Bay Area. Red Cross Director George Brown said about a dozen volunteers 
answered calls from anxious county residents, many of them wondering how to 
safeguard their homes in event of a similar quake. The Red Cross information 
line is (714) 835-5381. 
</P>
<P>
"It always happens, but it takes pictures of a major disaster on TV to get them 
concerned about their preparedness," Brown said. "In a way, maybe that's good, 
but I just hope people get the message." 
</P>
<P>
County residents were also urged Tuesday night not to phone the Bay Area. 
Pacific Bell spokeswoman Linda Bonnekson said the few phone lines still working 
in the Bay Area are overloaded with calls, complicating and slowing relief 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Because phone service is so critical, Bonnekson said that Pacific Bell conducts 
quarterly drills with dozens of employees at its large Tustin operational 
center. The facility employs more than 1,000 workers, including several shifts 
of operators. 
</P>
<P>
"With roads knocked out, the phone becomes a key tool in coping with an 
emergency of this type," Bonnekson said. "We try to train our people how to 
deal with the disaster and keep working at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
For Robert Bade, a county emergency medical physician, the Bay Area quake 
underscored the need to develop a network of private doctors ready to roll 
should a quake strike. Bade has been pushing for six years to establish a team 
of "quake-ready" doctors, a program that has received nearly $25,000 in seed 
money from county officials. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, Bade spoke Tuesday to two civic groups in Tustin and Dana Point 
on this very subject. 
</P>

<TEXT>     Pacific Telesis, Pac Bell's San Francisco-based parent company, recently
produced an eight-minute video called "First Born" to accompany a lobbying
effort aimed at politicians and regulators.;   Set in the year 2003, "First
Born" is the story of a middle-aged Hispanic couple in Fresno whose daughter
in San Diego is about to give birth prematurely to their first grandchild. As
the wife frantically packs her bag, the husband sits at his small two-way
videophone making plane reservations and choosing a crib from a catalog
display. Meanwhile, a doctor studies a sonogram of the daughter's baby from
home by videophone and gives his diagnosis to the nurse.;   At the
tear-jerking conclusion, the wife -- now in San Diego -- introduces the
family's new grandson to her husband in Fresno through a window-sized two-way
video screen.;   Pac Bell is willing to offer us this wonderful future -- but
there is a catch. The phone company wants to be freed from a long list of
regulatory restraints so it can build the expensive infrastructure required to
support advanced telecommunications services.;   Fiber optics is the key to
this vision -- specifically, putting high-capacity fiber-optic cables at or
near individual homes. Manufacturers of telephone equipment, telephone
companies and regulators are now in the middle of deciding how to engineer
this transformation and how much it will cost.;   These tough issues aren't
getting much public attention, but they are crucial to the future of Silicon
Valley. Dozens of companies in the hardware, software and information services
industries are preparing to make multimillion-dollar gambles on the future of
telecommunications in the home. Products or services that require the larger
capacity of fiber could flop if that capacity is not there soon enough.;   A
bundle of fiber cables no thicker than an adult's finger can carry 96,000
telephone conversations simultaneously -- a feat that would require 27
conventional copper-wire telephone cables, each measuring two to three inches
in diameter. The huge capacity of fiber optics could make possible new
interactive services such as video conferencing and sophisticated home
shopping.;   The biggest hurdle remaining is what telephone companies call the
"last mile" or the "local loop," the huge network of copper wires that
connects individual homes and small businesses to central switching offices.; 
 There is a consensus that copper wire will eventually disappear from the last
mile, but little agreement on when or at what cost.;   Fiber, which carries
brief bursts of laser light, has already taken over the top of the telephone
pyramid. Because fiber is most efficient at carrying heavy volumes of data or
voice traffic, long-distance networks began converting to fiber optics a
decade ago, and they are now almost totally converted. Fiber optics has also
become cheaper than copper wire for connections between local telephone
switching centers and for big companies that need to move large amounts of
computer data.;   But fiber is still more expensive than copper for the local
loop, because the relatively low volume of traffic doesn't cover the high cost
of stringing fiber cable through neighborhoods and installing equipment at
individual homes or curbside units, serving several homes, that convert light
into electronic signals.;   More efficient designs could wipe out that cost
difference within a few years. But copper wire wears out slowly. If fiber is
put into the loop only when copper needs to be replaced, the conversion
process could take 30 or 40 years.;   That leaves telephone companies with a
"chicken and egg" dilemma. The types of advanced services portrayed in "First
Born" would generate extra revenue to cover the cost of installing fiber. But
there isn't any demand yet because there isn't any way to provide these
services today at a reasonable price.;   "To be honest with you, I think if
one looks at this very realistically, there is no mass market 'want' out
there," said Dale Harris, a former Pacific Bell executive who now directs the
Center for Telecommunications at Stanford University. "There is a wish list,
but when you talk about (customers) paying more, it's a different question."; 
 Telephone companies face several other roadblocks.;   A maze of federal laws
and state regulations prevents phone companies that provide local service --
Pacific Bell and GTE in Northern California -- from branching into other types
of telecommunications such as cable television, "electronic Yellow Pages" home
shopping, two-way video and home information services.;   Numerous opponents,
led by newspaper publishers and cable television operators, oppose relaxing
those barriers because they fear the possibility of a monopoly supported by
the phone companies' vastly greater financial resources. In California, the
state Public Utilities Commission is concerned enough about the risks to ban
Pac Bell and GTE -- at least for now -- from putting fiber in the local loop.;
  "If they make a huge investment and it doesn't pay off, it could affect
rate-payers because rates would have to go up to cover the cost," said David
Gamson, a senior analyst at the PUC's San Francisco office.;   The Federal
Communications Commission took the first step toward allowing telephone
companies into the video business with a surprise ruling on Oct. 24 that could
ultimately allow Pacific Bell and other local phone companies to provide
"video dial tone" service.;   Video dial tone would be similar to telephone
dial tone -- the customer would decide whom to call. A smart TV, connected to
video dial tone, would scan available programming from many different sources
and offer a selection to the viewer.;   Rapid changes in telecommunications
technology are also confusing the picture. New ways to compress electronic
signals and increase the capacity of copper wire are raising the possibility
that many advanced services could be offered without replacing copper in the
local loop.;   Cable companies, too, are considering whether to put fiber in
their loop -- a network almost as comprehensive as the local telephone system.
About 90 percent of households in the United States are already passed by a
cable network and about 60 percent of those households subscribe.;   This
network is built on coaxial cable, which has a much higher capacity than
copper wire. Cable television today is dedicated to a single purpose:
providing television signals. But cable operators are studying enhancements,
including increased use of fiber optics, to support new services that could
put them in direct competition with telephone companies.;   John J. Sie, head
of the Encore movie channel in Denver, said cable systems will build fiber
"nodes" within five years that will serve from 100 to 1,000 homes with up to
400 television channels and offer interactive services.;   Sie claims the
cable industry can make this switch for $100 per household, compared with
estimates of $1,200 per household for curbside fiber telephone service.
Telephone companies won't be able to make money with fiber in the loop,
according to Sie, unless they enter the video market -- unfairly competing
with cable companies, which don't have the cushion of regulated rates to
guarantee a profit.;   "We don't see any economic justification for retrofit"
of the local telephone loop with fiber, Sie said. "So we want to see a
business plan (from the telephone companies) that shows how they will get a
return" without unreasonable rate increases.  </TEXT>

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Callers who aren't happy with the
baseball scores, stock tips and a host of other California
900-number telephone services can get their money back.
   Pacific Bell made the policy public yesterday; the local
telephone unit of Pacific Telesis Group already had been
arranging refunds on disputed 900 calls on a case-by-case
basis, a spokesman said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The move comes amid increasing public concern about
900-number services, which charge high rates that callers
often dispute. It also is part of a recent trend by phone
companies to take a lower profile on the 900 services, many
of which offer pornographic or lewd messages. Many have
recently decided not to provide billing for pornographic 900
services, forcing the providers to arrange their own
elaborate payment systems. Pacific Bell stopped billing last
month after a California court lifted an injunction
prohibiting it from denying billing based on message content.
   Pacific Bell said that it will give customers a full
refund of charges they incur on California 900 or 976
information numbers if they aren't happy with the "quality"
or "value" of the service. Pacific Bell said the terms of
service agreements it has with 900 providers allows for such
customer refunds in cases of disputed calls.
   Jim Coffee, vice president and general manager of Audio
Communications Inc., a Las Vegas-based provider of
general-information and sports-news lines, said he thought
the policy was reasonable. "Our own policy is that if a
caller is not satisfied, we just refund the money," he said,
adding that "reputable" providers such as his have relatively
few refund requests.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Telephone companies to fight Senate bill: Baby Bells to
press for more favourable rules on their access to cable television markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<TEXT>
US local telephone companies still plan a fight over some portions of the
telecommunications bill now making its way towards the Senate floor, even
though they accepted a compromise on some of the conditions it would place
on their entry into the long distance telephone market.
The seven leading local telephone companies known as the Baby Bells, which
were set up by the court-ordered break-up of the AT&amp;T monopoly in 1984,
agreed to a compromise on the long distance market that allowed the
telecommunications bill to be approved by the Senate commerce committee last
week.
But Bell executives are still promising a battle over the bill's rules for
allowing them into the cable television market while cable companies are
allowed into the local telephone market.
'The key problem for us in the Senate bill right now is the sequencing and
timing on cable entry,' said Mr Robert Stewart of Pacific Telesis, the Baby
Bell that provides local telephone service in California and parts of
Nevada.
'The cable companies are basically allowed into our market after a year. The
regulatory barriers in place would probably keep us out of cable for three
or four or five years,' he added.
A similar telecommunications bill passed the full House of Representatives
with relatively little rancour in June. When the full Senate passes its
version, the two bills must still be reconciled before the measure can
become law. Some supporters of reform fear that Congress is running out of
time to complete this before it breaks up for November's elections.
The cable companies represent probably the most serious threat to the Bells'
monopoly over local telephone service.
While some long distance companies have used the argument that the Bells
face no competition in their core market during the debate over the bill, it
is not thought that many of them will want to go to the expense of running
wires into consumers' homes. Cable companies, however, already have a
network on which they might be able to carry telecommunications besides
their current television programming.
The Senate bill agreed by the commerce committee last week would allow the
cable companies to provide telephone service without restriction one year
after enactment. But Bell officials complain that they would have to wait
for the Federal Communications Commission to lay out new regulations for
universal service before they could enter the cable market, which could
delay them for years.
The commerce committee agreed, however, to an amendment that would prevent
the new telecommunications bill from overriding court decisions or state
laws that have already opened the door for Bell companies wishing to provide
video services.
This could have implications for Nynex, the New York and New England Bell,
which is already affected by New York state laws opening up competition, and
for Bell Atlantic and US West, two other regional Bells, which have won
court decisions in favour of their right to own cable companies.
Many senators feel, however, that they promised the cable industry a degree
of protection from the Bells when in earlier legislation they required cable
companies to carry certain types of programming.
'In the Cable Act we did assure the cable companies that because of the
extraordinary regulations imposed on them, we would protect them from the
intrusions of the telephone companies,' said Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii
during arguments over the telecommunications bill last week.

CENSUS CAN BE A PUZZLE; 
</P>
<P>
LANGUAGE BARRIER: THE COUNTY'S SOUTHEAST ASIANS ARE HAVING PROBLEMS 
UNDERSTANDING JUST WHAT THE HEAD COUNT IS, EVEN WITH SOME HELP.

Even for one who commands English with the aplomb of a Laurence Olivier, 
filling out a census form can be tough. 
</P>
<P>
But imagine trying to complete the questionnaire armed only with knowledge of 
the Vietnamese, Thai or Tagalog languages. 
</P>
<P>
That's where people like Chi Duy Do come in. A volunteer for the U.S. Census 
Bureau, Do is one of scores of people in Orange County and across the country 
working to ensure that those who speak foreign tongues will be tallied in the 
nationwide head count. 
</P>
<P>
They are stationed at toll-free telephone lines or ensconced at temporary 
assistance centers in community agencies, churches and other locations. Do has 
the Vietnamese of Orange County as his customers, and his task has not been 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
"They call me and ask me, 'What is census?' " Do said Thursday as he sat in the 
offices of the Santa Ana-based Vietnamese Community of Orange County Inc., a 
social service agency where he usually works as a counselor. "They don't know 
the meaning. After explaining it to them, I ask them to spread the word . . . 
but I fear that many, many Vietnamese people will not be counted." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, problems have already started to crop up. 
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that some newcomers from Southeast Asia have thrown 
their census forms away, figuring that the government documents were junk mail. 
</P>
<P>
"In my neighborhood, I have seen in the trash maybe two or three 
questionnaires," said Do, who has also received phone calls from half a dozen 
other Vietnamese immigrants who mistakenly threw out the census form. "They 
don't understand. They think it is advertising." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the centers have yet to start doing a breakneck business. At the 
Vietnamese community center, for instance, only about a dozen people have 
called or visited since the forms were mailed March 23. Do was able, however, 
to explain the census to about 40 elderly Vietnamese during a meeting of senior 
citizens on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Many non-English-speaking residents may have resorted to ringing up the Census 
Bureau's toll-free telephone network. Nationwide, about 9,000 people have 
called the phone lines serving Asian languages, according to Ken Riccini, the 
bureau's assistant chief of processing centers. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish-language lines have been another matter entirely. Calls have jammed 
the system for days. The bureau has added more lines, but reports persisted 
Thursday of callers getting only a busy signal despite repeated dialings. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Census Bureau are well aware of all the problems. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with large printing costs and various computer-programming difficulties, 
the Census Bureau mails out questionnaires only in English. Each form also has 
a phone number for ordering a copy in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
But those who speak other languages must fend for themselves, seek help from 
census employees on the bureau's toll-free telephone lines, or head to one of 
the more than 75 volunteer assistance centers in Orange County and thousands 
more throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
Chi Duy Do and other volunteers use their bilingual skills to translate the 
census for often-befuddled newcomers, many of them from lands that never held 
such a nationwide canvass. 
</P>
<P>
If someone shows up speaking an unfamiliar language, the volunteers employ 
booklets that translate the census into 32 languages. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such efforts, leaders of minority groups throughout the United States 
worry that the language barrier and inherent fears of government intrusion will 
combine to cause an undercount among many of the people who could benefit most 
from the census. 
</P>
<P>
The once-a-decade head count is used to figure political apportionment and 
distribution of more than $70 billion in federal assistance for programs 
ranging from highway construction to social service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"The census is something that is very unfamiliar to the Southeast Asian 
community in general and the Vietnamese in particular," said Tuong Duy Nguyen, 
executive director of the Vietnamese community center, which serves the 130,000 
to 150,000 immigrants in Orange County. "They don't know how good the census is 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
Some newcomers fear that information gleaned by the census might be used 
against them, he said. In particular, they worry that revelations such as 
several families crammed into one tiny apartment might bring them to the 
attention of housing authorities, Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
And many Vietnamese don't trust the Census Bureau's promises of 
confidentiality, he continued, because of their experience with the government 
in their homeland -- a "distrust in the system" that has been carried to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes time to change the philosophy, the way of thinking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen said the effort to count the Southeast Asian community has been 
undermined in part by a lack of census employees to spread the word in the 
months before the count and to promote the effort among the Vietnamese and 
other immigrants. The bureau has only a single employee, Vong Ngo, serving as 
liaison to the Southeast Asian community all across Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Ngo expects that only about half the Vietnamese in Orange County 
will end up returning their census forms. Many of the rest will be counted 
during a post-census effort involving phone calls to non-respondents and visits 
to homes, Ngo said. Even then, he expects only 70% to 80% of the community to 
be counted. 
</P>
<P>
But the short, bespectacled father of two has not given up. Ngo said he plans 
to hold a press conference on Monday with reporters from immigrant newspapers 
in Orange County to spark more articles about the census and its importance.

   Pacific Telesis Group said it decided to end plans to test a videotex gateway because market research turned up insufficient numbers of potential customers and information providers. 

   In addition, the trial would have required a substantial investment with no indication it would ever earn a profit, telephone company officials said. 
A videotex gateway links customers via personal computers equipped with modems to a wide range of information providers. 
Pacific Bell had planned to start the videotex gateway trial early next year in San Francisco. 

   In a letter to information providers who had hoped to offer their services through the California Online gateway, Pac Tel's Pacific Bell telephone unit said it would concentrate instead on audiotex services, information customers can get by pushing buttons on a touch-tone phone. 

   The letter from Pac Bell's Roger Conrad, director of voice information and gateway services, said the company "concluded that we are not able to offer users and information providers the features, support and value necessary to make California Online a successful service." 
He said the company doesn't believe it would serve either customers or information providers to "conduct a trial for a service that does not have a high probability of becoming a successful commercial offering." 

   Keith Epstein, who heads external affairs for Pacific Bell's Information Services Group, said the trial was canceled "mostly because we were caught in a market development dilemma." 
A number of "critical factors need to come together, and they hadn't," he said. 
For a successful gateway trial, the company needs a sizable number of customers with personal computers and information providers to draw those customers to the gateway. 
Neither turned up, he said. 

   Pac Tel is the first of the seven Baby Bells to cancel a gateway trial, though Chicago-based Ameritech had decided months ago to skip the exercise and concentrate instead on providing information services over push-button telephones. 

   Analysts said the decision apparently reflects some technological problems and perhaps an expected change in California's regulatory climate. 
State regulators are preparing to adopt so-called incentive regulation that spurs the telephone company to cut costs and become more efficient. 
"The only thing I can read into it is that technologically the company isn't ready to trial it," said Robert B. Morris III, a telecommunications analyst with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. 

   Compared with other Baby Bell gateways, Pacific Bell planned to offer the most technically advanced service. 
Analysts said, however, that the company can now watch the development of other Baby Bell gateways and the Prodigy service being offered by Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. and International Business Machines Corp. to gauge the mass market for information delivered via personal computers. 

   In part, Mr. Epstein blamed the consent decree that broke up the Bell System and barred the Baby Bells from providing information services themselves. 
But he said that was only one of a number of factors. 
"People need to grow accustomed to using information services, and they are more likely to feel comfortable with audiotex," he said. 
Eventually, the telephone company is counting on push-button phone services to lead the way to computer gateway services.

CREW RAZING GAS STATION SEVERS TELEPHONE CABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A backhoe operator demolishing a gas station Wednesday morning accidentally cut 
two telephone cables, leaving more than 500 Pacific Bell customers without 
service until evening. 
</P>
<P>
The backhoe was being used by a work crew to unearth the station's three large 
gasoline storage tanks at Del Obispo Street and Camino Capistrano, according to 
telephone company officials. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the cables got really chewed up," said George Travieso, a member of the 
the repair team that worked throughout the day to splice an estimated 1,000 
pairs of broken wires that stuck out of the 4-foot-deep hole left by the 
backhoe. 
</P>
<P>
Service to customers along Del Obispo, between Camino Capistrano and Ortega 
Highway, was restored at about 7 p.m., Pacific Bell spokeswoman Linda Bonniksen 
said late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Carnes, another Pacific Bell representative, said the accident occurred 
because the contractor for the Southland Corp., which was supervising the 
demolition, had failed to notify utilities 48 hours ahead of time of its plan 
to unearth the tanks. Carnes said the fine for failing to report digging 
operations can be up to $5,000.

marked.

<HEAD>FCC Allows Phone Company to Test Cable TV System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission on
Wednesday gave General Telephone Co. of California permission to
build a coaxial cable TV system and permission to test a
state-of-the-art fiber-optic system that will allow customers to
order movies every 15 minutes by phone.
   The ruling, which was watched closely by cable TV operators who
fear entry of huge telephone companies into their turf, affirmed a
preliminary decision last year to let General Telephone build and
operate the coaxial (bundled copper wire) cable system in the Los
Angeles suburb of Cerritos. GTE of California also provides phone
service to Cerritos.
   The FCC said there had been no adequate bids submitted to the
city of Cerritos for cable service except from General Telephone.
GTE is leasing the system to Apollo CableVision to provide
programming.
   A GTE affiliate, GTE Services Corp., will install a fiber-optic
cable network to experiment with services such as near-video on
demand, which will allow customers to phone in orders for movies
that will be running on 30 channels. Some movies will begin every
15 minutes.
   Wednesday's decision was challenged immediately by the National
Cable Television Association, which said it appears to violate
federal rules generally barring telephone companies from the cable
TV business.
   Current rules bar phone companies from generating cable
programming in the same areas where they provide telephone service.
Federal rules also bar the seven regional Bell operating companies
from owning cable services anywhere in the country, but allow
companies like GTE to do so outside their service areas.
   The FCC in July 1988 preliminarily voted to consider
recommending to Congress that telephone companies be allowed into
cable TV in the regions they serve. The FCC also suggested it would
try to encourge telephone companies to enter cable TV, even if
Congress fails to act, by broadly defining ``good cause'' for
waivers.
   The FCC said it probably would grant waivers if telephone
companies wire homes with fiber and allow competitors to use those
wires to sell video programs too.
   FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick said Wednesday's ruling did not
presage any final FCC judgment on the cable-telephone company issue.
   ``This grant of this very limited waiver may produce very
valuable information that will be useful to the commssion and the
Congress in evaluating that more generic question,'' he said. ``The
precedent that results is narrow.''

<HEAD>NEW YORK: phone numbers.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bigger operators use television. Evening television movies are
interrupted with all kinds of invitations, sometimes attractive
young women, purring, ``There's a party on your line whenever you
want. Call as often as you want.''
   Businesses that deal in sex have never been known for truth in
advertising, but the expansion and invasion of the information
telephone services, sanctioned by state and local authorities, is
becoming troublesome to many.
   In California, the state legislature and the Public Service
Commission made it mandatory for the telephone company to block
lines to such calls at the customer's request. Pacific Bell has a
suit pending against a dozen dial-a-porn operators to force them to
cease and desist on the basis that they are damaging Pacific Bell's
reputation.
   New York Telephone says it makes an effort to survey the talk
lines and operators are required to provide monitors who can cut off
disruptive or obscene callers. While this works on some lines, it
doesn't seem to work on others.
   New York Telephone will now block dial-it calls from residences
for free. Until this January, there was a $5 charge. Businesses must
pay $10 and up, depending on the number of lines.
   The company will also cancel the charges the first time, if the
customer complains that a child or teen-ager made the calls without
parental permission. After that, the customer is urged to have the
line blocked, or keep their youngsters off the phone.
   The phone company loses nothing. It gets half the charge whether
the dial-it service collects or not. One West Coast company says
uncollected calls cost it $400,000 a year.
   Southern Bell shut down dial-a-porn services in Miami and Atlanta
in 1984 and so far has been upheld by the courts.
   The option of blocking calls apparently did not reach Vilma
Lantiqua, a 49-year-old mother of a 17-year-old high school dropout
in New York City. Her son, Sergio, had run up a $1,400 phone bill,
calling various party lines. In desperation she put the phone in her
daughter's padlocked bedroom. So one night in January, Sergio broke
into his mother's bedroom, stuffed a sock in her mouth and strangled
her, police said.
   The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case this spring in
which a California dial-a-porn operator, Sable Communications in the
Los Angeles area, is challenging bans on dial-a-porn as abridgements
of freedom of speech.
   The law under contest is a 1988 federal statute that bans
sexually explicit telephone message services. The law prohibits any
obscene or indecent communications for commercial purposes over
interstate lines. It provides for fines up to $500,000 and prison
terms up to two years.
   Whatever course the Supreme Court decides, there are a number of
area phone companies which, fearing adverse reaction will affect the
telephone information business in general, are planning to curtail
or segregate the pornographic and gab lines.
   The revenues are important. One New York state official said the
information services help subsidize the general telephone services.
   Those services which cater to homosexuals are more serious than
other gab lines. They permit callers to talk with a group or
``barhop'' by pressing a designated key on push-button phones. One
operator of such lines says they perform a real service, all the
more critical in the gay community since the AIDs epidemic.
   ``Talking to someone before jumping into bed with him is a good
thing to do,'' he says. ``Gays take this more seriously than do the
straights who tend to goof off and hambone on the gab lines.''
   Most often dial-it profits are illusory, a gamble at best.
Quality equipment is expensive, some devices running $2,000 a line
or more. They force a telephone line, capable of carrying two
voices, to carry six to eight.
   Most operations start with bright ideas, some never come to
fruition, some fail for lack of continuing innovation. It is a
copycat business. Some reserved lines are still vacant. There are
thousands more available.
   The reason, one said, is that the field is littered with dead
bodies, lost fortunes. Yet there are 200 million telephones out
there, each a potential market.
   Like many new ideas these days, this one started in the Western
states. Ominously, that is where some of the harshest controls are
showing up.
   But gab lines are not likely to go away. As one frequent caller
says, ``It's cheaper than going out.''
   Or was.

PACBEL FINE TO FUND PROGRAM FOR CONSUMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission granted 32 nonprofit groups nearly 
$5 million Wednesday under a special consumer program financed by a fine levied 
against Pacific Bell for abusive marketing practices in 1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
Created at the suggestion of Public Advocates, a San Francisco public-interest 
law firm, the program is intended to help, among others, people with low 
incomes and those who speak little or no English. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell was fined after the commission determined that the company was 
guilty in many cases of persuading low-income and non-English-speaking 
customers to sign up for special services without making it clear that these 
features were optional and cost extra. The services included speed-dialing and 
call-forwarding. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the case, Pacific Bell was forced to make $63 million in refunds 
to 495,000 of its 8.5 million residential customers. In addition, Pacific Bell 
was fined $16.5 million by the PUC. Public Advocates persuaded the PUC to set 
aside that money for consumer education for the groups most hurt by the 
high-pressure marketing practices. 
</P>
<P>
The money is to be spent over six years, under the administration of the 
California Community Foundation in Los Angeles. The $5 million granted 
Wednesday was the first allocation of the $16.5-million fine. 
</P>
<P>
"This trust fund will create the best-educated low-income, minority, 
non-English-speaking consumers in the country," predicted Robert Gnaizda, 
founding partner of Public Advocates. The largest single grant went to San 
Francisco-based Consumer Advocates to develop educational materials and work 
with other grantees. California/Nevada Community Action Assn. will get 
$669,000, which will develop training programs for the other participating 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Other groups include the Union of Pan Asian Communities and the Chicano 
Federation of San Diego County, which jointly received $535,000 for programs to 
reach speakers of Spanish, Vietnamese, Hmong, Lao and Khmer. A consortium 
headed by Los Angeles' Korean Youth Center will receive $20,000 to develop a 
telephone referral and information network for Korean, Chinese, Japanese and 
Filipino consumers.

MOST UNLISTED PHONES; 
</P>
<P>
EASTERNERS FINALLY GET LINE ON L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, Americans have ridiculed Southern California's fabled rootlessness, 
that sense of disconnected ennui, New Age cocooning and traffic-jam isolation 
chronicled by unfriendly East Coast writers. 
</P>
<P>
Californians themselves often have been impatient with such analysis and quick 
to discount it as envy and sour grapes from people bitter about lack of 
sunshine and orange blossoms in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, marketing researchers from the frosty environs of Fairfield, 
Conn., have produced a troubling survey that seems to back up with real numbers 
some longstanding impressions about the self-absorbed West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Survey Sampling Inc. reports that residents of Los Angeles have become so 
disdainful of uninvited contact with the outside world that more than half have 
unlisted telephone numbers, far more than in any major city in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The Connecticut company, which sells telephone numbers to market research 
firms, said the 56% figure for unlisted numbers in Los Angeles is exceeded only 
in Las Vegas, whose residents' rootlessness and nighttime schedules have 
produced an unlisted phone rate of 60.3%. 
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 8 of the top 10 U.S. metropolitan areas for unlisted 
numbers are in California. 
</P>
<P>
John Lamb, the firm's client-service specialist, said he is not certain what 
produced this phenomenon but gives some credence to the notion that "a lot of 
people who live in California screwed up something in the East and are trying 
to get as far away from that and from other people as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Another factor may be a high percentage of young adults in the West. The survey 
shows that, throughout the country, two-thirds of those with unlisted numbers 
are under 40. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike older Americans, many of whom apparently consider unlisted numbers 
faintly unneighborly, the younger generation appears to see great advantage in 
keeping its phone numbers secret from salesmen, fund-raisers and rejected 
suitors, even if it costs an extra 30 cents a month. 
</P>
<P>
The average percentage of unlisted numbers for all metropolitan areas in the 
country climbed from 21.8% in 1984 to 27.6% last year, and Lamb said the steady 
growth will continue. 
</P>
<P>
Charlene Baldwin, spokeswoman for Pacific Bell, said her records show a 
somewhat smaller percentage of unlisted numbers. About 45% of the company's 1.9 
million customers in Los Angeles County are unlisted, as are about 40% of all 
Bell customers in the state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Once a Sign of Fame 
</P>
<P>
This goes much higher in areas such as Beverly Hills, "where you don't see a 
very large phone book," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlisted numbers once were considered signs of fame and fortune, of people too 
important to be bothered. But the survey indicates a similar reluctance on the 
lower end of the income scale to list telephone numbers, particularly as 
computerized campaigns to sell everything from toothpaste to travel packages 
flood telephone lines around dinner time. 
</P>
<P>
Many people take their numbers out of the book in the hope of preventing such 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
This often does not work, because many firms use random-dialing systems that 
catch unlisted numbers anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting customer distress plants potentially profitable seeds of interest 
in a new device that will let the discriminating resident screen all calls 
while the phone is ringing. 
</P>
<P>
Known as "Caller ID" or "Custom Local Area Signaling Service (CLASS)," the 
system uses a small, $80 box that attaches to the telephone and provides a 
digital display of the number from which the call is placed. If the number is 
unfamiliar or that of an annoying friend or angry boss, the call can be 
ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin said the system is to be introduced in California over the next year 
and will include such refinements as a special ring for calls from special 
friends whose numbers have been programmed into the device. 
</P>
<P>
In New Jersey, where the system is available, initial response was "three times 
what we expected," said New Jersey Bell spokesman James W. Carrigan. 
</P>
<P>
Washington ranks only eighth among major metropolitan areas and 47th overall in 
unlisted numbers, but its 26.2% -- very close to C&amp;P Telephone Co. 
estimates -- is enough to suggest a healthy market for Caller ID. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone surprises, unpleasant or otherwise, then would diminish. Life would 
proceed more quietly in self-sufficient cocoons of automatic telephone 
monitoring, videocassette recorders and shopping by cable, letting 
introspection continue without further interruption.

In vacating a 1985 Federal Communications Commission rule Wednesday, a federal 
appeals court handed back to states authority to regulate newer telephone 
services such as voice mail and computer access. 
</P>
<P>
The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals opinion, which affected seven lawsuits, means 
some telephone companies might have to set up separate corporations for their 
regulated normal telephone services and their unregulated extra options. The 
FCC would have allowed the companies to merge their regulated and unregulated 
services, but now that decision would rest with each state. 
</P>
<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission, which filed three of the lawsuits 
against the FCC, heralded the appeals court decision, but a spokesman for 
Pacific Bell said it could cost customers more in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
"It properly gives the states greater freedom to promote the development of 
enhanced services and the terms and conditions upon which those services are 
provided," PUC President G. Mitchell Wilk said. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Harris, director of planning and policy for Pacific Bell, said the 
company supports state regulation. But he said Pacific Bell fears state control 
could lead to a costly corporate division of its regulated and unregulated 
services -- something the FCC required in mid-1984 before it changed its mind 
14 months later, bringing on the 1987 legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not clear that we are going to have to split off," Harris said. "It's up 
to the states. But we strongly believe that independent subsidiaries are not 
necessary and would make it more difficult to provide the services to the 
public." 
</P>
<P>
Harris said innovative communications systems, which have developed rapidly in 
the past 10 years, are a multibillion-dollar industry that ranges from voice 
and electronic mail to automatic teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
An FCC spokeswoman said the opinion is a setback for the communications 
industry, which under federal rules had been required to merely keep finances 
separate for unregulated and regulated services but not create detached 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
"We adopted the rules because we believed they would be in the public 
interest," she said. "So, of course, we're disappointed in the outcome. We have 
to start from scratch." 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court ordered the FCC to develop new rules to help regulate new 
telecommunications services offered by the Baby Bell companies. Until the 
disputed FCC rule, those smaller firms had been prevented from providing 
information services under a court decree that stripped AT&amp;T of its local 
operating companies in January, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The court said the FCC arbitrarily and capriciously reversed itself without 
showing that cost-shifting between unregulated and regulated services wouldn't 
occur and raise the bills of "captive telephone customers." 
</P>
<P>
"The record yields no evidence that the (Bell Operating Companies) power to 
extract monopoly rents from local telephone customers has diminished," the 
court said. 
</P>
<P>
The complicated set of lawsuits attracted interveners from most 
telecommunications firms that compete with the telephone companies.

   Centex Telemanagement Seen as Vulnerable
   To Phone Rate Restructuring in California

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- A moment of truth is nearing for Centex
Telemanagement.
   The highflying, San Francisco-based telephone service
company has captured the heart of Wall Street ever since
going public in 1987. Earnings and revenue have risen
sharply. Cash on hand has risen to $27 million. Long-term
debt is naught.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But developments in California's regulatory environment
are casting a shadow over Centex's bread-and-butter business.
   Centex is like few other companies. It is part middleman,
part consultant, part telephone service manager. In return
for a fee, Centex links small businesses to the local
telephone company and routes customer calls over any of the
various lines and services offered by the local company as
well as AT&amp;T, MCI and others.
   Until now, Centex has benefited from an anomaly in
California's rates. Pacific Bell has a lock on the toll calls
within each local telephone area, such as from San Jose to
San Francisco. For California's small users, such local toll
calls are far more expensive than in other states. In fact,
Los Angelenos can talk to New Yorkers more cheaply than to
many of their in-state neighbors.
   Centex has prospered by buying telephone service at the
bulk rates available to large users and offering savings to
small businesses. But California is restructuring rates. The
state's Public Utilities Commission is expected to open up
local toll calls to competition and to cut rates by as much
as 30% to 40%.
   What's more, Pacific Bell asserts that Centex, among
others, rents a type of dial tone service at a price below
Pacific Bell's cost. Though Centex disputes this, some of
Centex's costs could well be raised. A PUC draft decision on
rate restructuring is expected this summer.
   David Shantz, a program manager in the PUC's Division of
Ratepayer Advocates, which represents telephone users, says,
"Centex is what I call a price arbitrager. As toll rates come
down, the ability of Centex to compete will diminish."
   Amy Newmark, an analyst with Homans McGraw Trull Valeo &amp;
Co., sees "a major negative impact." Centex "won't be the
only game in town" for customers seeking an alternative to
Pacific Bell, and there will be less reason to seek such an
alternative, she says.
   Peter Howley, an MCI and AT&amp;T veteran who is chairman of
Centex, concedes that the changes in California might
adversely affect some of Centex's business, but he says that
in the long run Centex will benefit from increased
competition. Moreover, he asserts that the savings Centex
offers on California toll calls are a small part of its
appeal.
   Although 80% of its billings are in California, Centex is
expanding on the East Coast. And Mr. Howley, in general,
plays down Centex's appeal as a discounter. "Five years ago,
it was easy to show a big saving," he says. Today, as long
distance competition heats up, analysts say the saving has
probably diminished.
   Mr. Howley doesn't dispute this. He says Centex's basic
appeal is that it relieves small companies of the burden of
picking a carrier and of managing its phones. In a favored
phrase, Centex provides a "single point of contact" for a
customer's telephonic needs. That is intended to ring
nostalgic with those yearning for the simplicity of the Ma
Bell era.
   Centex also offers various teleservices, such as reports
allocating a customer's calls to the customer's various
clients. James Hickey, an analyst with William Blair, says,
"They are that friendly voice you used to hear when you
called AT&amp;T."
   Jerry Oliver, a specialist on regulatory matters for Pac
Bell, agrees that Centex has carved out a niche as a
"telemanager."
   But analysts say it costs Centex more time and money to
market to clients on the basis of service, rather than on
price. And while the company is upbeat about its expansion in
the East, analysts say Centex has yet to achieve the
economies of scale -- or the profit margins -- that it has in
California. Certainly, Centex's profit would seem to be
highly vulnerable to regulatory changes in its home state.
   Ms. Newmark asserts that "telemanaging" requires no hard
assets and little technology or capital. Thus, she wonders
why, if the business is so good, Centex has yet to attract
much competition. Since the barrier to entry would seem to be
low, Ms. Newmark says Centex's stock should trade at a modest
multiple of earnings.
   Tom Barton, a partner of Feshbach Brothers, which has sold
short some Centex stock, betting that it will drop, says,
"Centex's real game is rate arbitrage, and this game is
over." Mr. Barton could be wrong. But with Centex's stock
selling at 23 times estimates for 1990 earnings, investors
have a great deal to lose if he is right.

GLITCH TIES HUGE AT&amp;T NETWORK IN KNOTS; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNICATIONS: ABOUT HALF OF ALL LONG-DISTANCE CALLS THAT CUSTOMERS TRIED TO 
PLACE WERE BLOCKED. THE SOFTWARE PROBLEM TOOK HOURS TO CORRECT.

<P>
If you tried to reach out on Monday, chances were about even that you did not 
touch anyone. 
</P>
<P>
A mysterious problem gripped AT&amp;T's giant long-distance network, making it 
impossible for many calls to get through. Instead, for hours on end, unlucky 
callers heard only a series of musical tones and the following tape recording: 
"All circuits are busy now. Please try your call later." 
</P>
<P>
The company said the problem was fixed by 8:30 p.m. PST, but spokeswoman Sally 
Sherwood said she could not provide any more details immediately on how the 
network was returned to normal. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously through a very long, laborious process they were able to detect the 
problem and fix it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The difficulties were traced to software that runs computerized call-switching 
gear that AT&amp;T began installing in 1987, Sherwood said. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T's diagnostic testing system first alerted the company to the problem 
around 11:30 a.m. PST. 
</P>
<P>
Several hours later, engineers at the firm's Network Operations Center in 
Bedminster, N.J., figured they had isolated the problem in the utility's 
Signaling System Seven, a data network overlaying the talking path of telephone 
conversations. But it took several more hours to fix the system. 
</P>
<P>
Linda McDougall, a spokeswoman in AT&amp;T's Los Angeles office, explained that 
the SS7 network carries the calling number, the number called and the route of 
the call, but not the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
She estimated that the problem affected about half the calls that AT&amp;T 
customers were trying to make on public lines. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly hard-hit were companies that rely on 800 numbers to generate much 
of their business. At Avis car rental, for example, operators accustomed to 
juggling several calls per minute were staring at silent phones for as long as 
five minutes at a time. "We're not getting any calls," said one, who identified 
herself as Candy. 
</P>
<P>
Increasing computerization has given the phone system far more versatility, 
enabling it to handle a growing load of calls, faxes and computer hookups. Call 
forwarding, call waiting and other custom services are all products of this 
computerization. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T and the regional operating companies insist that these additional 
services have not come at the cost of less reliability, but some experts have 
warned that the more complex the software systems, the more likely they are to 
have bugs that may pop up without warning. 
</P>
<P>
On a normal business day, AT&amp;T's long-distance network, the nation's 
largest, handles between 80 million and 90 million calls. However, company 
officials said they believed the volume was significantly lower on Monday 
because of the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. birthday holiday. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Hyundai Motor America was among those bedeviled by the 
AT&amp;T glitch. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had major problems; we can't call out," said telecommunication manager 
Susie Nakao earlier in the day. "We just get all circuits busy." 
</P>
<P>
The company's high-speed data lines were still transmitting despite the 
failure, however, so employees increased use of an electronic messaging system 
to reach out from the Fountain Valley national headquarters to other Hyundai 
offices across the United States, Nakao said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell also suffered from the AT&amp;T failure because Pacific Bell's 
local operators were "bombarded" with phone calls from puzzled customers, 
according to Linda Bonniksen, a company spokeswoman in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"Old habits die hard," Bonniksen said. The flood of calls came from AT&amp;T 
customers who punched zero once and connected with a local Pacific Bell 
operator instead of punching zero twice to reach an AT&amp;T operator. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Southern California, Al Harmon, owner of Aljo Fabric Protection 
Inc. of Van Nuys, said he was frustrated in a daylong effort to reach his 
distributor in Vacaville to tell him about an emergency that threatens a 
$16,000 to $18,000 fabric-protection contract with a Sacramento hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"My manufacturer has shorted me on some product, and I'm afraid we're going to 
lose the job, unless my distributor tells the customer that we're going to be a 
week or 10 days going in," Harmon said. 
</P>
<P>
He started telephoning his Vacaville distributor at 6:30 a.m. Monday and 
continued throughout the day without success, Harmon said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not outraged, but, Lord, this is my business. All of it is done on the 
telephone . . . I'm going to stay on it until I'm beat or I succeed." 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press reported that a number of heavy users of toll-free lines 
experienced problems. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Sheffield, phone systems manager for the Marriott hotels reservation 
office in Omaha, said the problem was "devastating" for her office because it 
wasn't receiving calls from prospective customers. 
</P>
<P>
The office received only 10% of its normal call volume after the problem began, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Fidelity Investments said callers had trouble getting through to the 
Boston-based mutual fund operator. "It did have quite extensive impact," said 
spokeswoman Tracy Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
American Airlines spokeswoman Mary O'Neill in Ft. Worth said that after 11:30 
a.m. PST, the carrier experienced about two-thirds fewer calls than normal on 
its reservation lines. 
</P>
<P>
Trans Mid-America, a marketing company in Omaha, specializing in temporary 
motor vehicle license sales, could not make any long distance or 800-number 
calls, said Florence Waymire, a vice president of the company. 
</P>
<P>
"We're dead in the water here today," she said. The company has inbound and 
outbound telemarketing services, which "totally shuts us down." 
</P>
<P>
The problem did not affect the nation's other major long distance carriers, MCI 
Communications Corp. and US Sprint.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Hands States Regulation of Enhanced Phone Services</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Wednesday gave
states the authority to regulate new telephone services such as
voice mail and computer access, a move one Baby Bell company said
could raise costs to consumers.
   The decision could force the seven regional Bell telephone
companies to set up separate corporate entities to handle their
regulated telephone services and their newer, unregulated services,
officials said.
   The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals opinion vacated a 1985 Federal
Communications Commission rule that had required the Baby Bells to
keep finances separate for regulated and unregulated services but
not create separate corporations. Seven lawsuits had been filed to
overturn the rule.
   The court's ruling allows each state to decide whether to require
separate corporations.
   The California Public Utilities Commission, which filed three of
the lawsuits against the FCC, heralded the decision. The plaintiffs
had contended that the Baby Bells could have subsidized unregulated
services by charging higher prices on regulated phone service.
   ``It properly gives the states greater freedom to promote the
development of enhanced services and the terms and conditions upon
which those services are provided,'' Commission President G.
Mitchell Wilk said.
   Steven Harris, director of planning and policy for Pacific Bell,
said the company supports state regulation but fears state control
could lead to a costly corporate division of regulated and
unregulated services.
   ``It's not clear that we are going to have to split off,'' Harris
said. ``It's up to the states. But we strongly believe that
independent subsidiaries are not necessary and would make it more
difficult to provide the services to the public.''
   An FCC spokeswoman said the opinion is a setback for the
communications industry.
   ``We adopted the rules because we believed they would be in the
public interest,'' said spokeswoman Jane Mago. ``So, of course,
we're disappointed in the outcome. We have to start from scratch.''
   Unregulated communications services have developed rapidly in the
past 10 years into a multi-billion-dollar industry that ranges from
voice and electronic mail to automatic teller machines, Harris said.
   The appeals court ordered the FCC to develop new rules to help
regulate new telecommunications services offered by the Baby Bell
companies.
   Those companies had been prevented from providing information
services under a court decree that stripped AT&amp;T of its local
operating companies in January 1984.
   Later that year, the FCC allowed the Baby Bells to offer
unregulated services through separate subsidiaries. But in 1985, the
federal agency dropped the requirement for separate subsidiares.
   The court said the FCC arbitrarily and capriciously reversed
itself without showing that cost-shifting between unregulated and
regulated services wouldn't occur and raise the bills of ``captive
telephone customers.''
   ``The record yields no evidence that the (Bell Operating
Companies) power to extract monopoly rents from local telephone
customers has diminished,'' the court said.

PHONE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM UNVEILED

A 24-hour telephone message system intended to assist county residents with 
personal and health-care needs and provide up-to-date information about 
countywide educational, recreational, cultural and volunteer opportunities 
began operation Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Recorded in Spanish and English by local and national celebrities, InfoPartner 
features more than 110 audio messages dealing with such topics as health, 
physical and sexual abuse, employment and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"InfoPartner is a very special gift because it will reach so many people with a 
wide spectrum of information over a long period of time," Gary Johnson, United 
Way chairman of the board, told about 200 guests assembled in the Fluor Corp. 
Flag Courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
The system is accessible from any touch tone telephone. Callers need only dial 
(714) 253-7766 then enter a three-digit code corresponding to the message they 
wish to hear. Callers are then given information about other agencies or phone 
numbers to call about their specific area of interest. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, in a message entitled "Living With Stress," K-Ocean radio 
announcer Holly Adams spells out the major causes and symptoms of stress and 
tells callers that failure to address problems associated with stress may lead 
to serious physical and mental problems. Another voice then instructs callers 
to contact the Family Service Assn. at (714) 838-7377 to speak with a counselor 
if further assistance is needed. 
</P>
<P>
Funded primarily by a $180,000 grant from the Pacific Mutual Foundation, the 
program has enlisted the support of several businesses and community service 
organizations. It is funded for the first three years but will require 
community support in order to continue, said Tom Sutton, chairman and chief 
executive officer of Pacific Mutual. 
</P>
<P>
"InfoPartner is an important community resource for our English- as well as our 
Spanish-speaking community," Sutton said. "We're really fortunate to live in 
Orange County. Many of us were attracted here from somewhere else. It is for 
that reason that many of us are motivated to do things to make sure that those 
attractive features continue and that our problems are addressed and 
minimized." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Watson, board chairwoman of the Volunteer Center of Santa Ana, said the 
message system should have a great impact on her program, which provides 
volunteers for various community organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only are there messages from Barbara Bush, Gloria Deukmejian and Whoopi 
Goldberg about the benefits of volunteering, but there are specific messages 
for young people, for seniors, for corporate volunteers," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
To meet the changing needs of the community, the program will be monitored by 
United Way on a monthly basis and updated twice yearly, said George Phillips, a 
United Way worker who helped to develop the system. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to see between 100,000 and 150,000 calls the first year." 
</P>
<P>
The technical nucleus of the message system was developed by the marketing 
communications firm of Palmer, Sharritt &amp; Company Inc., which has set up 
similar programs in other parts of the country. The firm provided examples from 
users about how those programs have affected their lives. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, a message on teen-age suicide recorded by actor Mike Farrell 
prevented a young boy from committing suicide, Johnson said. In a letter to the 
actor, the boy wrote: "Many things you say seem to be true. I also happen to 
believe that it does not indicate I am insane just because I feel my life is 
not worth living any longer. I will hang in there a little longer." ROBERT E.

   Unions representing 157,000 workers went on
strike against three regional telephone companies Sunday, slowing
local phone service in 15 states and the District of Columbia.
   Nine Southeastern states were spared telephone strikes as the
Communications Workers of America and BellSouth reached a tentative
agreement on a new, three-year contract late Saturday.
   But technicians, operators , clerical personnel, sales and
factory workers at NYNEX Corp., Bell Atlantic Corp. and Pacific
Telesis began strikes Sunday after talks failed.
   No talks were scheduled with NYNEX or Bell Atlantic, which
together provide telephone service to the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic regions.
   Informal talks were held Sunday in California between Pacific
Telesis, CWA and the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers, but no progress was reported.
   ``We are talking but we seem to be making very slow progress,''
said CWA spokeswoman Vira Milirides.
   No formal talks in any of the strikes were scheduled for Monday
but informal bargaining was expected to continue, with resumption
of fomal negotiations hinging on those discussions.
   People who dial direct should find little interruption in
service in the strike areas, company and union officials said.
   But consumers needing operator or directory assistance often
were greeted Sunday with recordings saying heavy call volume had
slowed service _ and that situation would worsen with the start of
the workweek Monday.
   Installations and repairs also would be slowed if the strikes
drag on and the companies try to operate with management personnel
in place of strikers.
   In all three strike situations, the unions and companies
remained well apart on the issues of wages and health insurance,
and a number of local issues remained unresolved in each set of
negotiations as well. The debate over health insurance has been the
major obstacle, with the unions resisting companies' efforts to
shift some costs to workers.
   The greatest differences appear to be between the unions and
NYNEX. That strike was called well before the midnight Saturday
deadline because the differences were so great no formal talks were
held Saturday.
   CWA represents 40,000 NYNEX workers and IBEW an additional
20,000. The company, based in New York, provides local phone
service in New York and the six New England states and went through
a nine-day strike three years ago.
   ``We were prepared for this and got our management teams out
there at midnight,''' said NYNEX spokesman John Bonomo. ``But
things may start to back up as we get the crunch on Monday.''
   At Pacific Telesis, the strike was called at midnight California
time _ 3 a.m. EDT _ but negotiations continued through much of the
night. The talks recessed Sunday morning but were expected to
resume although company officials said nothing was scheduled
officially. The company serves parts of California and all of
Nevada and employs 44,500 union workers, all but 2,500 of them CWA
members.
   The strike deadline at Bell Atlantic was extended as
negotiations continued past midnight Saturday but a walkout was
called just before 7 a.m. Sunday because of a lack of progress.
   Edward G. Grogan, Bell Atlantic's vice president of labor
relations, expressed disappointment the union had rejected a
``progressive settlement with a significant compensation package,
improved health care services and a long list of family care and
employment security provisions.''
   But the CWA's Bill Bickers said the company's offer of
``retrogressive wages and benefits is a slap in the face to all of
our members.''
   Bell Atlantic serves Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the nations capital. CWA
represents 41,000 Bell Atlantic workers, IBEW 11,500.
   The BellSouth agreement provides an immediate 4 percent pay
increase and cost of living adjustments in 1990 and 1991, BellSouth
officials said Sunday. The pact also provides for employees to
receive up to 12 months of child care leave and receive six months
of medical coverage while on leave.
   Three more of the so-called ``Baby Bells'' spawned by the 1984
breakup of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph face strike deadlines at
the end of the week.
   Contracts expire Saturday at Ameritech, US West and Southwestern
Bell. Together, those companies employ 131,000 union workers in 24
states.

FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: Bell Atlantic wins court ruling
on cable TV service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELL ATLANTIC, the large east-coast telecommunications company, yesterday
won an important legal victory which could make it the first US local
telephone company offering cable television in its telephone service area.
It said a US district court in Alexandria, Virginia, had declared
unconstitutional a provision in the 1984 Cable Act blocking telephone
companies from providing cable programming in areas where they also provide
a telephone service.
US local telephone companies, which are keen to enter the potentially
lucrative cable business, have lobbied Congress for years to have the ban
removed. The cable industry, meanwhile, has insisted the provision was
necessary to protect it from the monopolistic local telephone companies.
The case, which seems likely to go to appeal, sets a significant legal
precedent and may prompt other local telephone companies to mount cases in
their parts of the country.
Bell Atlantic, one of the seven regional 'Baby Bell' telephone companies
spun off in the mid-1980s from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, filed suit
last December in Alexandria against the US government agencies responsible
for overseeing the 1984 Act.
It wants initially to offer a cable television service to 60,000 customers
in Alexandria, just across the Potomac River from Washington DC, using
modern fibre optic technology. It would be in competition with existing
cable operator, Jones Intercable.
Bell Atlantic said the Alexandria court ruled the 1984 Act violated its
rights to free speech under the First Amendment to the US constitution. The
court had removed the ban in all seven states where the company provides a
telephone service.
The cable industry seems certain to appeal the ruling. The federal
government could also object, although the executive branch has, in recent
years, generally favoured breaking down the regulatory barriers separating
various parts of the communications industry.
Bell Atlantic also needs the approval of the Federal Communications
Commission, the government agency overseeing the industry, for its specific
plans to upgrade its network in Alexandria. It said it could be serving its
first customers in the town some six to 12 months after FCC approval.
Bell Atlantic has been one of the most aggressive local telephone companies
in seeking to enter the cable television field.

CAVE-IN CUTS PHONE SERVICE TO 25,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Things went from bad to worse this week at Prime Financial Securities, a 
four-broker securities firm on Ocean Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
First, the stock market on Monday began its 93-point dive to its lowest level 
in nearly 10 months. Then, about 10 a.m., all the phones in Laguna Beach went 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"Things came to a screeching halt around here," said broker George Abrahamsen. 
"It was almost as bad as '87, but in '87 we had phones and no buyers." 
</P>
<P>
Abrahamsen was experiencing the same problem that 25,000 General Telephone 
customers in Laguna Beach had to contend with Monday and Tuesday. Because a 
phone cable was damaged during a cave-in on Coast Highway, they could call 
within the three Laguna Beach prefixes but nowhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Even the mayor of Irvine was put out. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is mad at me," said Mayor Sally Anne Sheridan, who Monday evening 
tried to return her calls from her beach home, a trailer in Laguna Beach's El 
Morro Trailer Park. "All I could get was a busy signal." 
</P>
<P>
The cave-in injured two workers installing a sewer pipe and sheared a cable 
carrying 400 phone lines, said Linda Bonniksen, a spokesman for Pacific Bell. 
It was a Pacific Bell cable, but it cut out service to General Telephone 
customers in Laguna Beach, Bonniksen said. 
</P>
<P>
The outage also cut all emergency 911 calls to the Laguna Beach Police and Fire 
departments, according to Fire Chief Rich Dewberry. But he said all 911 calls 
were quickly rerouted through the San Clemente Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was an emergency we missed, we don't know about it yet," Dewberry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Seven truckloads of Pacific Bell employees worked until 4 a.m. Tuesday to 
repair the cable. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very, very difficult task," she said. "They had to take 400 pieces of 
copper wire and match them to their mates, all in the dark." 
</P>
<P>
All service was restored by Tuesday noon. 
</P>
<P>
Bonniksen said an investigation will determine who is liable for the damage. 
Preliminary reports indicate the cable was cut when workers were forced to 
shore up a ditch to help the trapped men. 
</P>
<P>
She could not put a monetary value on damages, nor could Abrahamsen estimate 
what it cost his company. 
</P>
<P>
Bonniksen said Pacific Bell would reimburse its customers only for 
one-thirtieth of the monthly service -- and only if they ask for it. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't reimburse for any perceived lost business," she said. "The Public 
Utilities Commission protects us in accidents like this." LEN HALL

RIVAL CLAIMS PACBELL GAVE IT A 'VIRUS'; 
</P>
<P>
OWNER OF TALKING YELLOW PAGES SAYS PHONES OFTEN GO DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
To Michael Amin, it seemed a natural: a "talking" phone book for people who 
would rather deal with an operator than finger through the yellow pages. 
</P>
<P>
So, Amin set up a Los Angeles-based firm, Primex Talking Yellow Pages, to 
provide callers a choice of whatever category of company or service they 
request -- for example, a selection of physicians of a given specialty and 
working in a particular area. Then the Primex operator can connect the caller 
with the doctor he or she wants. 
</P>
<P>
But the hang-up for Amin has been Pacific Bell. 
</P>
<P>
The phone company says it has been unable to find the electronic "virus" that, 
for 18 months, Amin claims, has bedeviled Primex. The result for Primex has 
been to have many of its 36 telephone lines go dead at crucial moments -- such 
as right after broadcast of television and radio commercials inviting the 
audience to call for a trial. 
</P>
<P>
At other times, Amin said, conversations are cut off in mid-sentence. And 
sometimes callers hear ringing while Primex operators hear nothing or, 
answering a ring, find no one on the line. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Know the Cause 
</P>
<P>
Despite extensive testing by Pacific Bell technicians, who say they don't know 
the cause of Primex's problems, the company's phone troubles have persisted for 
18 months. Amin said they now threaten Primex's pioneering venture, which 
competes with Pacific Bell's yellow pages directories. He also noted that 
Pacific Bell and other former Bell phone companies have repeatedly -- and 
vainly -- sought court permission to enter the talking phone book business. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Amin lodged a formal complaint with the California Public Utilities 
Commission, whose consumer division expects to complete its evaluation shortly. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PUC's five members held a final hearing in San Francisco on 
Monday to hear from businesses such as Primex before deciding later this year 
whether to accept proposals, submitted separately by Pacific Bell and GTE 
California, to change telecommunications regulation in the state. 
</P>
<P>
While different in many particulars, the two proposals aim to give the phone 
companies some flexibility in setting prices, speed commission decisions and 
strengthen the incentive to cut costs by lifting the present limit on utility 
profits. Instead, a share of the profits beyond a certain point would be 
returned to customers in the form of rebates. 
</P>
<P>
Amin and other telephone industry entrepreneurs have complained that giving the 
big phone companies more flexibility might clear the way for Pacific Bell and 
GTE to use dirty tricks and other unfair practices to drive competitors out of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Dennis Love has testified before the Assembly Committee on 
Utilities and Commerce that his Marin County telephone-equipment repair service 
failed after advertisements bought in Pacific Bell's local phone books were 
botched in two of the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
In Amin's case, the business is still running, although the number of employees 
has plunged to 30 from a high of 70 when the company moved to larger quarters 
near Los Angeles International Airport. That same day, Feb. 1, 1988, the young 
company's local telephone service unaccountably went haywire, Amin said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Deliberate Tampering' 
</P>
<P>
In its complaint, Primex accuses Pacific Bell of indulging in "illegal 
harassment" and "deliberate tampering" with the company's phone lines, most of 
which are attached to a Pacific Bell Centrex control unit. The goal, the 
complaint charges, is to destroy the company's business. Amin attached several 
pages of single-spaced entries chronicling scores of service irregularities and 
said he has many more on file. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell spokeswoman Kathleen Flynn confirmed the existence of repeated 
complaints by Primex but said 2,400 tests have so far turned up no glitch in 
the phone company's equipment. Flynn said 99.8% of Pacific Bell's test calls 
went through without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason for us at any time and at any case to disrupt a customer's 
business," she said. "That's just not the way we do business." 
</P>
<P>
But Amin disputed the validity of that finding. When he asked Pacific Bell last 
month to monitor one day's phone traffic for his firm, he said, the utility 
found that 41% of the calls lasted less than 15 seconds -- too brief, he said, 
to be completed business calls.

PACIFIC BELL PLANS REFUND FOR ITS UNPUSHED BUTTONS 
</P>

Pacific Bell said Wednesday that 112,000 rural customers who were charged extra 
for push-button telephone service that the company never provided will receive 
credits averaging $42 on their phone bills this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The credits stem from a $5-million settlement the California Public Utilities 
Commission approved last week in a closed-door "executive session." 
</P>
<P>
The settlement culminated a three-year effort by George Sawaya of rural Pollock 
Pines in the Sierra foothills east of Sacramento, who said he was induced by a 
Pacific Bell mailing to sign up, at extra cost, for "Touch Tone" service so his 
calls would be completed faster. He noticed no difference in service, however, 
and later learned that Pacific Bell's local telephone switch was not equipped 
to provide the service. Although he obtained an immediate refund, Sawaya filed 
a class-action complaint on behalf of other customers who paid extra for 
service that was never provided. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell spokeswoman Kathleen Flynn said the company expects to submit 
details of the refund plan this month. She called the billing problems "an 
oversight." 
</P>
<P>
PUC Deputy Counsel Michael Day said the commission considered Pacific Bell's 
action an unintended mistake stemming from commission-approved rate changes 
intended to compensate the company for upgrading its switching equipment 
throughout much of the state.

PUC WARNS OF LONG-DISTANCE SERVICE FRAUD 
</P>

<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission warned consumers Tuesday that up to 
25 unauthorized companies may be trying to sell long-distance telephone 
services illegally in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Marco Valenti, manager of the PUC's consumer affairs branch, said the 
unauthorized companies seem to concentrate on residential customers and small 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, he said, the companies offer some form of flat fee for unlimited 
long-distance calling or discounts for signing up friends and relatives. In 
many cases, Valenti said, the firms lease only a few telephone lines from major 
long-distance carriers, and these lines soon become so crowded that customers 
find them constantly busy. 
</P>
<P>
Valenti also cited a case in which a consumer responded to a sales pitch by 
mailing $500 to an office address in Dallas -- only to find later, after 
contacting the PUC, that there was no record of any such company. The money has 
not been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Valenti urged consumers approached by representatives of long-distance 
companies with which they are unfamiliar to check with the PUC in Los Angeles 
((213) 620-2570) or in San Francisco ((415) 557-1048) to make sure that the 
firms are certified by the state. The state Department of Consumer Affairs also 
offers a booklet, "Choosing a Long-Distance Telephone Company," that can be 
ordered by calling (916) 445-1254. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of long-distance telephone companies have started selling service 
since the breakup of the Bell System 5 years ago, Valenti noted. The PUC 
certifies more than 120 firms to provide service in California. These companies 
are required to file their prices with the commission and to submit to state 
regulatory procedures.

LOCAL PHONE COMPANIES FEELING HEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pacific Bell, GTE California and the state's 20-odd other local phone companies 
still enjoy virtual monopolies in their respective service areas. But that is 
changing -- in ways that promise to revolutionize the way consumers and 
businesses buy and receive phone service. 
</P>
<P>
In the same way that giant American Telephone &amp; Telegraph has lost market 
share to smaller upstarts in the long-distance business, a handful of 
entrepreneurial competitors are asking regulators to open local phone markets 
further to competition. That will enable them to cash in on a growing business 
and chip away at the market shares enjoyed by Pacific Bell and other local 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
So far, such increased competition is minimal. But the prospect of its growth 
was a major factor cited by Pacific Telesis on Thursday in announcing that it 
will cut 16% of its work force in the next five years, mostly in its Pacific 
Bell unit. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking at the next five years, it's etched very keenly in everybody's minds 
that we have to do this to remain competitive," said Pacific Telesis 
spokeswoman Amy Damianakes. 
</P>
<P>
An example of the new breed of competitor is Metropolitan Fiber Service, a 
2-year-old private venture that offers local connections to big business in a 
dozen U.S. cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"Our competition today is in what is designated as special access only, a very 
small part of the total access (provided by) the Bell operating companies," 
said George Tronsrue, a vice president of Metropolitan Fiber Systems. 
</P>
<P>
Its local links connect major telecommunications users, such as brokerages and 
other financial institutions, to the long-distance carriers of their choice, 
bypassing local public networks run by Pacific Bell and other local phone 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan Fiber Systems, based in the Chicago suburb of Oakbrook, Ill., 
installs its switching system in the heart of a major metropolitan area -- 800 
W. 6th St. in Los Angeles. Then it extends high-capacity, high-fidelity optical 
fiber strands to connect surrounding buildings to one another, creating its own 
local network. This in turn is hooked to the nearby switching machines of such 
long-distance carriers as AT&amp;T, MCI, US Sprint and the more than 100 other 
more specialized long-haul companies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a small niche, but a viable business for us," Tronsrue said. "But when 
you look at what else is there, there is a significant portion of local-access 
service that we are precluded from developing." 
</P>
<P>
Building a tiny niche into a big business mirrors the genesis two decades ago 
of MCI, which began by handling private traffic by microwave between St. Louis 
and Chicago and parlayed that into opening the entire long-distance 
telecommunications market to competition. 
</P>
<P>
Now federal and state regulators are begining to lighten their control over 
AT&amp;T, which has watched its former long-distance monopoly shrink to a 
two-thirds share of the market. At the same time, MCI and US Sprint have grown 
into billion-dollar concerns themselves, and both now are also profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Metropolitan Fiber Systems has asked federal authorities to let it broaden 
its entry into local telecommunications. It seeks the right to plug its private 
customers into the Baby Bells' local networks, paying just for the part of 
local service that it needs to complete its own system. 
</P>
<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission also has called hearings this year 
on opening the local monopoly. Tronsrue said MFS intends to make its same 
appeal to the state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Doing so would require and the local giants to break down service into "basic 
service elements" and offer these for sale separately. But today, Tronsrue 
said, would-be competitors like MFS must pay for a connection to the local 
switching machine, which they don't need, in addition to the transportation to 
their customer's local phone lines, which they do. 
</P>
<P>
But competition is not a one way street. Pacific Bell and other Baby Bells want 
to get into other markets themselves. They are pressing Congress and the 
Federal Communications Commission to amend the nation's cable television laws 
to let them carry video signals, which they currently are prohibited to do 
within their service areas. An unregulated PacTel subsidiary already has 
entered cable TV in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about 10 years overdue," said Stuart Crane, telecommunications analyst 
with Gruntal &amp; Co. "They should have competition from the Bell companies. 
There is no reason (today) for the (1984) Cable Act." 
</P>
<P>
GTE California, under special FCC authorization, carries cable television for 
ApolloVision in Cerritos, testing the capabilities and qualities of three forms 
of transmission: traditional copper wire, coaxial (or two-way) cable and 
optical-fiber cable. As a part of that test, a handful of Cerritos households 
-- actually only five -- this year will enjoy optical-fiber links to their 
homes that will enable them to sample such services as home banking and 
shopping andcalling up movies to be viewed on demand -- services already 
available to telephone customers in France.

FT  15 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Multi-media superhighways
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AVERAGE telephone line in the US is used for only 20 minutes a day. For
the remaining 23 hours and 40 minutes, it is dead. This basic fact underlies
the current convergence between the telecommunications and cable television
industries, which was epitomised by this week's Dollars 22bn bid for
Tele-Communications, the largest US cable television group, by Bell
Atlantic, a large regional telecommunications carrier.
Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications believe that by combining forces they
will be able to sell customers a rich diet of services over a single
network: ordinary entertainment and telephone services to start with, but
eventually home shopping, access to databases, picture telephones and much
else. The same desire to fill the unused hours on the telephone lines with
extra services underlies recent multi-billion dollar investments in cable
television by US West and Nynex, two other US regional telecommunications
carriers.
There are those who are sceptical about the current enthusiasm for
'multi-media' convergence. They point out that attempts to merge
telecommunications and computing companies in the early 1980s failed because
it was impossible to devise products which appealed sufficiently to
customers. Similarly, it has yet to be proved that customers want to buy new
multi-media services.
Cost advantages
But the industrial logic driving the convergence of cable TV and
telecommunications does not rely on consumers showing interest in new and as
yet unproved multi-media services. There are cost advantages in combining
ordinary entertainment and telephone services over a single infrastructure.
This has already been shown in the UK, which has become a telecommunications
laboratory since deregulation in the mid-1980s. British cable TV companies
are successfully offering combined telephone and entertainment services at
lower prices than either service could be provided on its own.
If anything stops the convergence of the two industries, it will be
regulation rather than industrial logic. There are already signs that the
Bell Atlantic/TCI takeover will face tough scrutiny from the authorities.
The reason is concern among politicians and consumer groups that instead of
competing head-on, cable TV and telecommunications operators will join
forces and push up prices for both telephone and TV services.
This argument misses the point that cable TV and telecommunications
companies have in the past not competed at all. Regulations have kept them
out of each others' businesses, so creating local telephone and cable
monopolies. Now these regulations are crumbling. In August, for example,
Bell Atlantic won a legal case allowing it to provide video services over
its main telephone network.
Hasten competition
But barriers still largely remain on cable companies providing telephone
services over their networks. Rather than seeking to use regulations to slow
down convergence, the authorities should press ahead with deregulation as a
means of hastening competition in both industries.
There is one important caveat. Telecommunications operators should continue
to be prevented from linking up with cable companies operating in the areas
where they run telephone services. Such integration would be seriously
anti-competitive, as it would eliminate major potential competitors.
But allowing link-ups with cable companies outside the areas where they
provide telephone services is a different matter - particularly if combined
with a policy of freeing both cable and telecommunications groups to offer a
full range of services over their networks. Such an approach would
eventually mean that customers would have a choice between two integrated
fixed-link operators, instead of facing monopoly suppliers for two separate
services. Further competition will be provided by operators offering
television and telephone services via satellite and radio links.
Restructuring the industry in this way will have considerable benefits for
customers. Far from increasing prices, competition would drive them down.
Meanwhile, the industry would be able to bring the dead hours of the
telephone network to life.

<TEXT>
   John D. Goeken filed a lawsuit Wednesday
against GTE Corp., one day after he resigned as chief executive of
the Airfone subsidiary he founded.
   Goeken's lawsuit, filed in DuPage County court, contends GTE
breached his employment contract at Airfone, which provides
air-to-ground telephone service to airline passengers.
   Goeken said in a statement he plans to file a competing
application for air-to-ground telephone service with the Federal
Communications Commission once the Airfone case is resolved.
   In the lawsuit, Goeken seeks release from his employment
agreement and his agreement not to compete with GTE. He has an
unpublished number and could not be reached for comment.
   Stamford, Conn.-based GTE would not comment on Goeken's
allegations because of the pending litigation, said spokesman Harvey
Greisman, reached in New York.
   ``But I can tell you we will vigorously contest the lawsuit he
has filed,'' he said.
   When GTE bought Oak Brook-based Airfone in 1986, it contracted
with Goeken to run the company through 1990, his lawsuit says.
   GTE then ``stripped Goeken of his authority'' and ``unjustifiably
removed his right to control the business and affairs of GTE
Airfone,'' the lawsuit alleges.
   ``I am deeply disappointed in GTE's failure to perform as
promised,'' said Goeken, who also helped start the company that
became MCI Communications Corp., now the nation's second-largest
long-distance telephone service.
   Some agency officials have speculated there is not room on the
airwaves for another service, though satellite relay could expand
the available range.
   Goeken said it is technologically and economically possible to
share the limited frequencies available, citing the benefits of
competition.
   Goeken invented the patented technology used by Airfone to
provide telephone service from airliners moving at speeds exceeding
500 mph.
   Airfone began providing telephone service aboard airliners in
1984, when the system was installed in an American Airlines DC-10.
By the beginning of this year, nearly 1,000 aircraft had been
equipped with the phones.
   Since 1987, the company also has offered Railfone, for use in
commuter and interstate train travel.
   Goeken's lawsuit says that since GTE took over, complaints about
Airfone service have increased, equipment repair is slower and the
number of calls per aircraft has dropped.
   Greisman declined to characterize Airfone's performance and said
GTE does not break out earnings figures for its subsidiaries.
   ``We always believed and continue to believe that it is an
important acquisition,'' he said.
   Goeken will be replaced as Airfone chairman and chief executive
by Terry Parker, president of GTE's mobile communications group,
Greisman said, while Sumter Logan was to continue as president and
chief operating officer.

<LEADPARA>  Moving to protect individual privacy in the face of new telephone technology,
the Federal Communications Commission proposed Thursday that telephone
customers have limited ability to block Caller ID, a service that displays the
phone number of incoming calls before a person answers the telephone.;   But
the move is likely to pit the federal government against some state
regulators, who advocate stricter protections for callers who want to conceal
their identities when using the phone.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Business  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  FCC SEEKS LIMITED CALLER ID BLOCKING  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Thursday's action came amid a nationwide debate over Caller ID, which is
already available in many cities and will eventually be available everywhere.;
  Telephone companies are heavily promoting the service as a way for people to
identify unwanted callers, but critics have argued that callers are entitled
to privacy and should be allowed to conceal their identity if they choose.;  
Protection from 900 numbers; In a separate action, the FCC adopted rules
intended to protect consumers from unscrupulous providers of pay-per-call
"900-number" telephone services.;   The new rules would force companies that
provide information over "900" numbers to fully disclose the cost of each call
and give customers a chance to hang up without incurring charges.;   On Caller
ID, the principal concern of a number of politicians and consumer advocates is
that telemarketing companies can learn a person's identity, match it with
other information and then sell it to other businesses without the customer's
knowledge or consent.;   FCC backs limited blocking; In trying to balance the
privacy interests with its desire to promote useful applications of Caller ID,
the FCC proposed that callers be allowed to block the information on
individual calls but rejected the idea that they should be able to have the
identification blocked automatically for every call they make.;   In taking
that stand, the FCC appeared to be moving to pre-empt efforts by some state
regulators to impose heavier protection.;   The New York State Public Service
Commission, for instance, recently rejected plans offering per-call blocking
on local telephone service by New York Telephone and Rochester Telephone. The
commission is insisting on per-line blocking.;   "The FCC wants to get in
there before we act," said Gail Garfield Schwartz, deputy chairman of the New
York State Public Service Commission. "They want to forestall any state,
especially us, from having a higher level of privacy protection.";  
California studying the issue; California's Public Utility Commission is
studying a proposal by Pacific Bell to offer Caller ID in the Bay Area and Los
Angeles; a ruling is expected by the end of the year. Under state law, the
phone company would be required to offer per-call blocking at no charge to
customers. Two bills in the Legislature that would require per-line blocking
are on hold until the PUC makes a decision.;   Commission officials argued
that allowing widespread blocking of Caller ID would make the service less
marketable and could stunt the development of creative new services that most
consumers would welcome.  </TEXT>

FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Pacific Bell to invest Dollars
16bn in 'super-highway'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PACIFIC Bell, the telephone company serving California, yesterday announced
plans to spend Dollars 16bn over seven years to create a multi-media
communications super-highway across its territory. It also awarded American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph a contract estimated at some Dollars 5bn to supply key
parts for the system.
The project is among the largest network modernisations announced by a local
US telecommunications group as both these companies and cable television
operators start to pour capital into the creation of inter-active,
multi-media communications networks.
It is also a coup for AT&amp;T, which will act as systems integrator for the
network and supply much of its hardware. Its contract is said by Pacific
Bell to be the 'single largest network equipment purchase in
telecommunications history'.
Pacific Bell, a subsidiary of the Pacific Telesis telecommunications group,
said the modernisation programme would begin next year and initially
concentrate on the heavily populated centres of San Francisco, Los Angeles,
Orange County and San Diego.
More than 1.5m homes would be hooked up to the super-highway by the end of
1996 and more than 5m homes - or 60 per cent of those it now serves  - would
be connected by the end of the decade.
In addition to advanced telecommunications, Pacific Bell intends to offer
video services, bringing it into direct competition with local cable
television operators.
However, before it can get into the video market it must first overcome a
ban on telecommunications companies entering this area, imposed under the
1984 cable act. Another local telecommunications group, Bell Atlantic, has
already won this right through court action.
The investment is a bold step for Pacific Telesis, which has held back from
the US rush into multi-media services and alliances between programme
providers and communications distributors. It said yesterday it believed it
could obtain programming without taking an equity position in a content
provider.
The company said it could fund the upgrade by cutting Dollars 500m to
Dollars 1bn from its cost structure, with no additional expense to
rate-payers and no additional debt for now.

SHAKES UP RESIDENTS AND TOURISTS. THE EPICENTER WAS NEAR THE ORANGE COUNTY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A moderate earthquake gave Orange County a sharp kick Thursday, driving 
students and teachers from their classrooms, shattering windows, tossing 
ceramic artworks from shelves at a crafts festival, and generally spooking 
residents and tourists. 
</P>
<P>
The 10:21 a.m. quake, which measured a magnitude of 4.0, caused no injuries and 
only minor damage. The quake's epicenter was in the vicinity of the Orange 
County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa, according to seismologists at Caltech. Costa 
Mesa, Newport Beach and Santa Ana bore the brunt of the temblor's impact, 
though residents from South County to Long Beach reported feeling the jolt. 
</P>
<P>
"It hit like a solid punch," said John Farmer, chief of campus security at 
Orange Coast College, near the quake's epicenter. "The ground started to roll a 
little so you knew it was coming, then it was a big jolt and the building shook 
for a while." 
</P>
<P>
About 150 students and staff were evacuated from the four-story library at the 
college but were allowed to re-enter the building shortly after inspectors 
determined that the structure was not damaged. Two cracks, however, were 
discovered in other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals said they had no reports of injuries, and police and fire officials 
said they received only a few calls from residents inquiring about the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials in Orange County said work crews were dispatched to check 
overpasses for cracks or other damage, but no problems were detected. Pacific 
Bell said telephone service was not interrupted by the quake, but a spokeswoman 
said there was a slight surge in usage, presumably as people rushed to call 
friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
The quake occurred on the Newport-Inglewood fault, Orange County's only major 
fault system. The last significant temblor to occur there was on April 7, 1989, 
when a 4.6 quake centered in Newport Beach caused widespread but minor damage. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Given, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Pasadena, said 
there are many faults within the Newport-Inglewood system. It is difficult to 
determine exactly which fault produces a temblor when it is of such a low 
magnitude, Givens said, calling this quake "a window rattler." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Thursday's quake rattled nerves of those who felt it, and set off 
car alarms in the parking lot of the County Courthouse in Santa Ana and 
elsewhere. Office workers and students in dozens of schools "ducked and 
covered" as the earth began to move. Out-of-town tourists were understandably 
upset. 
</P>
<P>
Dawn Holst of New York City was attending a computer-software conference at the 
Marriott Hotel in Fashion Island when she felt the earth move. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I thought it was a subway going underneath me, and then I realized I 
wasn't in New York," she said. "I thought, 'Oh, my God, it's an earthquake.' " 
</P>
<P>
Roy Marquez was washing windows at the Jeep-Eagle dealership in Costa Mesa when 
the quake shattered three large windows and cracked a fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just starting on the third one when it hit," said Marquez, 26. "I 
thought I had broke it. I thought maybe it was the soap I was using. I just 
ran." 
</P>
<P>
During the rocking and rolling, some storekeepers and shoppers at South Coast 
Plaza kept their eyes on a Rolls-Royce convertible precariously balanced on 
four china teacups -- part of an exhibit for a British cultural festival at the 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
The car did not budge. 
</P>
<P>
But artisans at a British crafts exhibit at the mall weren't so lucky. 
Expensive glassware, delicate ceramic works and pottery were knocked to the 
floor. Damage will probably go over several thousands of dollars, although an 
immediate estimate is not known, said Morris Latham, a spokesman for the crafts 
fair. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit is housed in a tent structure in the parking lot of the mall's 
Crystal Court annex. "It shook quite badly," Latham said of the tent. "Piles of 
things came down. There were ceramics and glass broken; some were quite 
valuable pieces." 
</P>
<P>
While not all schools in Orange County were evacuated, students at those 
closest to the epicenter initiated emergency procedures, many without prompting 
from teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"Today was very interesting because I had several teachers tell me that when 
the earthquake hit, the kids hit the floor like a shot," said Assistant 
Principal Carla Rush at Marina High School in Huntington Beach. "They knew 
exactly what to do. There was no fooling around." 
</P>
<P>
At the 13-story Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, employees said they felt a 
"bump," but the cathedral's massive glass panes withstood the shaking. 
</P>
<P>
"We just flew out of our chairs," said one employee. "Other than that, we're 
just fine. It's interesting when you are in a tower." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's quake occurred a day after the one-year anniversary of the 7.1 quake 
that caused 67 deaths and massive damage in the Bay Area. The grisly images 
from that disaster -- played repeatedly on television in recent days -- were 
fresh in the minds of some of those running for cover. 
</P>
<P>
"I just looked around and waited to see whether we should get under the table," 
said Huntington Beach resident Inez Cinocco, who was eating in a restaurant. 
"It was frightening, especially because on TV they kept showing the moments of 
silence from last year's (Bay Area) earthquake."

SHAKING UP THE COUNTY 
</P>
<P>
Here are some of the recent, notable earthquakes felt in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
July 8, 1986: A quake measuring 6.0 and centered near Palm Springs shakes 
people awake at 2:21 a.m. No major damage or injuries are reported in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 1, 1987: An earthquake registering 5.9, centered in Whittier, creates 
havoc throughout Southern California. In Orange County about $8 million in 
damage is caused. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 3, 1987: Orange County residents are awakened at 3:59 a.m. by an 
aftershock from the Oct. 1 earthquake. The aftershock registers 5.5 and causes 
extensive damage in the La Habra area. 
</P>
<P>
April 7, 1989: A sharp, jolting earthquake centered under Newport Beach shakes 
most of Orange and its surrounding counties, cracking buildings and closing 
schools. Five area residents suffer minor injuries during the quake, which 
measures 4.6. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 19, 1988: A moderate earthquake in the Pacific Ocean off Huntington Beach 
rumbles through Orange and Los Angeles counties. No damage or injuries are 
reported here. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 28, 1990: A moderate earthquake measuring 5.5, centered in the 
Upland-Pomona area, knocks bottles and cans from shelves locally and causes 
some minor damage to streets and sidewalks.

PACIFIC TELESIS TO CUT 11,000 JOBS IN 5 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pacific Telesis Group said Thursday that it will pare 11,000 of its 69,000 jobs 
-- 16% of the work force -- over the next five years to cut costs amid 
increased competition and new labor-saving technology. 
</P>
<P>
The company, the state's largest private employer, said the job cuts will come 
almost entirely from its Pacific Bell local telephone subsidiary. It said the 
reductions will be achieved through early-retirement incentives, retraining and 
attrition, but a job-seeking service will also be set up for employees 
accepting severance pay and leaving the company. 
</P>
<P>
Which jobs will be axed -- and how heavily the cuts will fall on Pacific Bell's 
28,000 Southern California employees -- remains to be determined, a spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts are among the largest in a series of reductions that have pared 17,000 
jobs from Pacific Telesis since it was created in 1984 as one of seven regional 
holding companies spun off from giant American Telephone &amp; Telegraph as 
part of an antitrust settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Telesis attributed the latest cuts to increased competition from 
upstart telephone firms that are chipping away at its monopoly and taking away 
some of its largest customers. In addition, new labor-saving telecommunications 
technology is making many jobs unneeded. 
</P>
<P>
"One person can do the job of three or four," observed Stuart Crane, an analyst 
with Gruntal &amp; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts also stem from a new California regulatory system that provides 
Pacific Bell incentives to reduce costs to increase profits. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying out the job-reduction program, including costs of early-retirement 
incentives, will not have a significant impact on profits, Pacific Telesis 
said. Analysts also noted that the cutback is not a sign of financial 
difficulty at the San Francisco-based firm, which is among the strongest of the 
so-called Baby Bells spun off from AT&amp;T. 
</P>
<P>
All but 50 of the jobs to be cut will come from giant Pacific Bell. The other 
50 jobs are to be cut during 1990 from Pacific Telesis' present headquarters 
staff of about 400. 
</P>
<P>
"Staffing requirements change over time in this dynamic industry," said Pacific 
Bell President Phil Quigley. "What was appropriate in 1989 clearly will not be 
in 1994." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell will lose about 7,600 non-salaried jobs and 3,400 management 
positions, he said. The job cuts do not affect Pacific Telesis' unregulated 
ventures, which are grouped under PacTel Corp. These include PacTel Cellular in 
Costa Mesa, PacTel Paging, Pacific Telesis International, PacTel Business 
Systems and PacTel Properties. 
</P>
<P>
Some layoffs will probably prove inevitable, the company acknowledged, but 
Pacific Telesis will try to minimize that by offering incentives for veteran 
employees to retire early by adding three years to both their service and their 
age in calculating pension benefits. That incentive trimmed a third of the 
management staff of Nevada Bell, a Pacific Telesis subsidiary that serves the 
Reno area. Other employees in jobs identified as surplus will be offered 
training for other posts or assignment to lower-ranking slots, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to operate even more efficiently in the 1990s, so we can deliver 
the maximum benefits to our customers and share-owners," said Sam Ginn, Pacific 
Telesis' chairman and chief executive. "Looking ahead, we remain keenly focused 
on our customers and the need to streamline operations so we can meet the 
challenges of increasing competition." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts generally welcomed the announcement but said it was no surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"The driving force of the telecommunications industry is technology," said 
analyst Crane of Gruntal &amp; Co. "Switches today are gigantic computers that 
are highly automated. They do almost anything. So all you need is people to 
supervise these massive machines and keep an eye on them." 
</P>
<P>
Another incentive to cut costs stems from a new regulatory system in California 
that requires Pacific Bell to lower costs by 4.5% a year to reflect anticipated 
labor-saving improvements from new technology. But the new system also allows 
the company to earn more, if it can, than was possible under the old system, 
which set a tight limit on profits. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, despite their present monopoly in providing local telephone service, 
Pacific Bell and the other Baby Bells already are losing some business from 
major customers, mainly financial services firms. These companies are either 
erecting microwave towers to create their own private phone system, or 
contracting with Pacific Bell or a growing number of newcomers that provide 
private links for them. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, this traffic bypasses the "public network" that most businesses and 
residential customers depend on. 
</P>
<P>
This bypassing was encouraged in California and some other states, including 
New York, when regulators opened one area of the monopoly to competition -- the 
lucrative high-speed transmission of data. Moreover, the California Public 
Utilities Commission this year will consider prying open other areas of the 
local monopoly. And the Federal Communications Commission and Congress are 
re-examining national cable television law, which presently forbids local phone 
companies to carry cable television in their service areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We may see in the next decade, more than one (local) phone company serving an 
area," suggested Steve Sazebari of the Dataquest research firm in San Jose. "In 
any case, they have to be more competitive in price and quality, so basically 
they have to cut costs." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell serve nearly 22 million people in California and 
the Reno area. 
</P>
<P>
NEW RIVALS -- Pacific Bell, like former parent AT&amp;T, is facing increasing 
competition from upstart phone firms. D1.

MAJOR ISSUES BEFORE THE PUC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission, supported by 1,070 employees and a 
budget of $70 million, is charged by the state constitution with regulating 
investor-owned utilities and truckers, companies that generate $40 billion a 
year in products and services. 
</P>
<P>
The governor appoints the five commissioners, who must be approved by the 
California Senate before serving staggered six-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
"The commission gets an incredible array of issues," says Terry L. Moore, 
director of the PUC division of ratepayer advocates. For example, commissioners 
recently deciided to allow a "wine train" to haul tourists through Napa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the major issues pending: 
</P>
<P>
Telephone Service 
</P>
<P>
Adopt an "incentive-based" regulatory system governing Pacific Bell and GTE 
California. Approval expected this month with system to take effect Jan. 1, 
1990, but some delay in implementation may be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
A final phase in the phone companies' regulatory overhaul will be completed 
next year as the PUC sets new prices for each telephone service covered by the 
new regulatory framework. It will also consider enlarging the size of the local 
calling area, currently 8 miles, and eliminating the 20-year-old monthly charge 
of $1.20 for "Touch Tone" telephones. It also will consider rules to improve 
and simplify service on privately owned pay phones and to resolve complaints of 
uncompetitive practices by local phone companies. 
</P>
<P>
Gas and Electricity 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Gas rates to be adjusted, probably upward, effective Jan. 
1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Major rate case, first in three years, to be decided for Pacific Gas &amp; 
Electric. Most contentious issue: Allocation of construction costs for Diablo 
Canyon nuclear power plant near San Luis Obispo based on a formula approved 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Approval of one or more new pipelines to bring more natural gas into the state. 
</P>
<P>
Revision of gas-pricing formula that seeks to keep major gas customers from 
switching fuels. 
</P>
<P>
First of what will be a biennial assessment of California's electrical needs. 
</P>
<P>
Decision due by end of 1990 on controversial proposed merger of Southern 
California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric. Federal approval is also 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
Trucking 
</P>
<P>
Revision of freight-hauling rules and price setting, seeking to improve 
competition and stability in trucking while avoiding both minimum rates and 
predatory pricing. 
</P>
<P>
Miscellaneous 
</P>
<P>
The PUC sets rates for investor-owned water districts, which deliver nearly a 
quarter of residential supplies. 
</P>
<P>
It also sets prices for ferry travel, and has before it a controversial 
proposal to merge two presently competing San Francisco companies, Red &amp; 
White Fleet and Blue &amp; Gold, which provide commuter service as well as 
tourist excursions on San Francisco Bay. BRUCE KEPPEL

CELLULAR PHONE DEALERS SUE FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten Orange County cellular telephone dealers have filed a $6-million lawsuit 
charging Leo's Stereo and Pak-Cell Inc. with predatory pricing and other 
illegal practices in the sale of mobile phones. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed last week in Orange County Superior Court, alleges that Leo's 
and Pak-Cell are selling the phones at a loss but making the money back by 
requiring buyers to sign up for cellular service. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers get hefty commissions from the cellular service providers for signing 
up new customers, but the "bundling" of phone sales with service orders has 
been ruled illegal by the California Public Utilities Commission.

1ST SOLAR PHONE BOX FOR HIGHWAY HELP TO BE INSTALLED FRIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first of 329 solar-powered call boxes designed to help stranded motorists 
will be installed in Ventura County on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
County officials expect to have the entire system in place by January, with 
yellow boxes set at half-mile intervals on both sides of sections of highways 
1, 101, 126, 118, 23 and 33. 
</P>
<P>
The boxes will be placed to ensure that motorists in the most heavily traveled 
stretches of state road are never farther than one-quarter mile away from 
direct communication with the California Highway Patrol, officials said this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Each call box will be placed in the middle of a 12-foot-high pole, on top of 
which will perch a black, shingle-like solar panel and an antenna that 
transmits telephone radio signals. 
</P>
<P>
The panel will collect solar energy and store it in a battery. Costs to dig 
trenches around the highway system and lay traditional telephone cables would 
be exorbitant, said Lynne Roberts, program manager for call-box operators for 
the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists using the phones will not have to dial. One push of a button will 
show CHP dispatchers where the call is coming from. Callers then will talk to 
the dispatchers and ask for assistance from patrolmen, ambulances, tow trucks 
and other emergency help. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, drivers will be able to alert authorities when they see drunken 
drivers, highway accidents or toxic spills. 
</P>
<P>
About 90% of the calls received in other counties that have such systems are 
reports of disabled vehicles, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
"Help will be at their fingertips, literally," said Assemblyman Jack O'Connell 
(D-Carpinteria). "It is one of the most significant accomplishments in my 
legislative career." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell authored legislation in 1985 that provided $1 million for 
installation of the system. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation guaranteed that Ventura County would receive more funds than 
other counties from an agreement requiring the federal government to give a 
share of proceeds from offshore oil drilling leases to the state of California. 
O'Connell argued that Ventura County deserves the extra funds because it bears 
the brunt of ill effects from offshore oil drilling. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, drivers in Ventura County will have to help finance the system by 
paying an extra dollar to register their cars each year. 
</P>
<P>
The fee will be in place until officials have a chance to work with the system 
and find out how much it costs, said Al Knuth, county deputy director of public 
works. 
</P>
<P>
Upkeep costs may be higher than originally expected, Knuth said. 
</P>
<P>
Accidents in Orange County, which has a similar system, knock down call boxes 
at the rate of two per month, Knuth said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County is one of the few counties in the state to obtain call boxes. 
Los Angeles has had a call box system since 1963. Orange County's solar call 
box system has been in place a little more than a year, and San Diego completed 
installation of call boxes last year. 
</P>
<P>
The system will cover all of Highway 101 from the Santa Barbara County line to 
the Los Angeles County line, said Bob Randall, project engineer for the county. 
</P>
<P>
However, on Highway 1, the system will begin at Five Points in Oxnard and end 
near Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
On Highway 118, call boxes will begin at the Los Angeles County line and end 
near Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
On Highway 126, the system will begin at the intersection of Highway 101 and 
end just east of Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
On Highway 23, it will run from the intersection of Highway 101 to just east of 
Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
On Highway 33, it will extend from the intersection of Highway 101 to a point 
just south of Casitas Springs. 
</P>
<P>
The ground-breaking ceremony for the first box is scheduled for Friday at 10 
a.m. at the La Conchita exit off U.S. 101 north of Ventura.

Create 'Brands'
Of Local Calls

   New Yorkers these days are more apt to place "what's up" calls and "check-in" calls to nearby friends and family. 
Chicagoans are more likely to make "phone first" calls before running errands. 

   The reason isn't merely a sudden collective urge to stay in touch. 
Rather, the rise in such phone use is the fruit of efforts by New York Telephone Co. and Illinois Bell Telephone Co., which along with California's Pacific Bell Telephone Co. are using specially targeted advertising to pep up local calling. 

   The companies are creating "brands" of calls and pitching them like soap. 
New York Telephone's ads include one designed to stimulate local business calling. 

   "We can't create people for them to call, but we can create reasons for them to call the people they already know," says Louis Kruh, New York Telephone's director of sales advertising. 

   While a common practice in the long-distance market, advertising to boost usage is fairly new to local calling, and an outgrowth of telecommunications deregulation. 
Since the breakup of the Bell System in 1984, long-distance rates have shrunk and, with them, the subsidy they provided for keeping down the price of local service. 
The result: "We need to pump up some of the people's bills to help subsidize the loss leader of local telephone service," says Harriet Norris, New York Telephone's director of corporate advertising. 

   The efforts are centered in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and seven other California cities, places where so-called local measured service is pervasive. 
Unlike flat-rate service -- which provides unlimited calling for a set monthly fee -- measured service requires customers to pay for local calls on a usage basis. 
"Every time they pick up the phone they pay for it, much like when you turn on the light in the house," Ms. Norris says. 

   So far, the campaigns appear to be working. 
Illinois Bell, for example, says that its test marketing indicates a 5% to 10% increase in calling volume as a result of its year-old advertising campaign. 
And telephone-company marketers says that for each dollar spent on such advertising by the companies, $3 to $7 is being generated from increased local calling. 

   In the ads, the phone companies and their ad agencies treat local calls much like any consumable product. 
"I believe that this is no different than if we are marketing some other product -- shampoo is an example," says Kenneth Yednock, a vice president of N.W. Ayer Inc., Illinois Bell's ad agency. 
"The purpose of advertising is to stimulate excess usage of anything." 

   New York Telephone and its ad agency, Young &amp; Rubicam Inc., have gone the furthest in pitching "brands" of calls. 
The phone company says that the ads' creators even borrowed ideas from greeting cards to compile its extensive brand line. 

   Among these are the "thank you" call, the "don't be lonely" call, the "don't feel guilty" call and the "good wishes" call. 
One TV commercial begins with a voice announcing "New York Telephone presents the 'feel better' call" as the phrase is superimposed on the screen. 
A tight shot appears of a man who phones his girlfriend to smooth over an earlier spat. 
In the midst of the ad, the voice interjects, "With New York Telephone's low rates, peace talks don't cost much at all." 

   With another commercial, New York Telephone is encouraging local calling among businesses. 
The ad shows a salesman who freezes over in the presence of a client who gives him the cold shoulder. 
The client's aloof mien shows he feels neglected because the salesman hasn't been attentive to his needs. 
An announcer says: "Next time, stay in touch with New York Telephone. . . . 
You can make your regular sales calls and that extra call." 

   Such ads are aimed at "callers" rather than "callees," says Young &amp; Rubicam's Katherine Schneider, who supervises the New York Telephone account. 
In contrast to the more passive callees, she explains, "the caller-type personality is a person who takes the initiative, is expressive and values his personal relationships." 

   One of Illinois Bell's "phone first" ads features a harried shopper rushing from one hardware store to the next in an unsuccessful search for plumbing materials. 
"To avoid a hassle," the accompanying jingles advises, "phone first." 

   Illinois Bell also has a series of "just call" ads, which recommend local calling as way to minimize worry. 
In one, anxious parents await their son's return home at night. 
When he finally arrives, the stern-faced father meets him at the door with the admonition "just call the next time."
