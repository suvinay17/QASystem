   Kermit, Miss Piggy and many of the
other Muppets will be joining ranks with Mickey Mouse and his
friends in an agreement announced today by Walt Disney World and
Muppet creator Jim Henson.
   Henson and Michael D. Eisner, chairman and chief executive of the
Walt Disney Co., said they have signed an agreement-in-principle for
Disney to acquire Henson Associates Inc., including its film and
television library.
   Both Henson and Eisner, announcing the agreement at a morning
news conference, would not disclose the price of the transaction.
   The proposal includes long-term consulting and exclusive
production agreements, with Henson producing motion pictures,
network and off-network television shows, Disney Channel specials
and series and made-for-home video programming, the release said.
   Also included are special Muppet attractions and rides for Disney
theme parks.
   ``I've loved Disney for many years,'' Henson told reporters. ``I
grew up on its movies... and I love the Disney parks, so we're happy
to have our characters at the parks now.''
   Work is already under way for the first project, a Muppet film
attraction using 3-D technology. The attraction, to open next spring
at the Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park here, will be a collaboration
between Henson and Walt Disney Imagineering.
   Disney will also have the merchandising, publishing and other
rights to Kermit, Miss Piggy, Animal, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo and other
Muppets.
   Although Eisner refused to discuss the cost of the agreement, he
said ``we will have a good return on our investment with just the
material that is there already. This is not to mention what's
coming, what is yet to be created.''
   In a news release earlier, he hailed the proposal as ``a business
association made in family entertainment heaven.''
   Henson, winner of several Emmy awards, introduced Kermit the Frog
and other Muppets to television in the 1950s. His library includes
the television shows ``The Muppet Show,'' ``Fraggle Rock,'' and
``Muppet Babies'' and the films ``The Muppet Movie,'' ``The Great
Muppet Caper'' and ``The Dark Crystal.''
   Henson's puppet segments and characters created for the
children's show ``Sesame Street,'' including ``Big Bird'' and
``Oscar the Grouch,'' aren't included in the agreement.
   Eisner said the ``non-profit continuing involvement'' between
Henson and the children's show would continue unchanged.
   Although Kermit appears on Sesame Street, the character is not
considered exclusive to that show.

   Miss Piggy, Kermit the Frog and other
Muppets have been given the keys to the Disney castle, and will soon
join Mickey Mouse, Dumbo and the other regulars at Disney theme
parks.
   Later, Muppets will star in Disney movies and television shows.
   ``There is virtually no area in which there isn't an opportunity
for Jim Henson to make an enormous contribution,'' said Jeffrey
Katzenberg, chairman of the Walt Disney Studios.
   Henson, the creator of the Muppets, and the Walt Disney Co.
announced an agreement Monday to put at Disney's disposal all of the
existing Muppet characters and their library of film and television
shows.
   That's not mentioning ``what is to come, what will be created,''
Disney Chairman Michael Eisner said.
   The merger of the two kiddie entertainment giants will blend the
colorful characters from ``The Muppet Show'' _ the most widely seen
TV program in the world with an estimated 235 million viewers in
some 100 countries _ into Disney's theme parks, movies, TV shows and
retail merchandising products.
   Katzenberg said the Muppets will be presented at the Disney-MGM
Studios theme park in a state-of-the-art ``interactive 3-D
experience. We will use many technologies in doing some things that
have never been done before.'' The Muppet theater will open next
Memorial Day.
   Henson and Eisner refused to disclose the purchase price of
Henson Associates Inc. It has been reported as ranging from $100
million to $150 million.
   ``I've loved Disney. I grew up on its movies. . . and I'm happy
to have the Muppets at the parks,'' said the bearded Henson, who
created Kermit in 1955 and followed that up with Miss Piggy, Animal,
Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, Scooter and others.
   Henson, who also created most of the stars of the ``Sesame
Street'' television series, will retain his association with that
show separately from the Disney agreement, he and Eisner told
reporters.
   Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch, the Cookie Monster and other Henson
creations for ``Sesame Street'' are not part of the Disney deal.
   Analysts have said the studios' park needed something such as the
Muppets to better compete with rival Universal Studios Florida,
which will have two attractions geared to children when it opens
next May 1.
   Eisner and Henson publicist Susan Berry said the Muppets would
retain their family-oriented humor and not become strictly
children's characters. The Muppets' attraction to small children is
primarily visual, Ms. Berry said.
   ``Miss Piggy, for instance _ whose humor is adult humor _ is not
going to change,'' she said.
   Henson said he it was ``always fun creating new characters. . . I
look forward to that.''

<LEADPARA>  A bitter custody fight over Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy and other creative
offspring of the late Jim Henson has erupted between the Muppet creator's
natural heirs and Walt Disney Co.;    Claiming that they are trying to prevent
the "outright theft of Jim Henson's legacy," a pair of companies controlled by
Henson's heirs filed suit Wednesday to stop Burbank-based Disney from using
the Muppets at theme parks without a license.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  DISNEY HAS GOTTEN DOWNRIGHT PIGGY WITH MUPPETS,
HENSON HEIRS CHARGE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The U.S. District Court suit followed the breakdown of merger negotiations
between Henson's heirs and Disney in December and the collapse of licensing
talks between them Tuesday night.;    Disney had signed a letter of intent
with Jim Henson to acquire Henson Associates and rights to such characters as
Kermit and Miss Piggy in August 1989. But the $150 million deal foundered
after Henson died last May.;    "Even though Disney walked away from its offer
to buy our company, it is acting as if it owns the Muppets," said Brian
Henson, president of Henson Associates and one of Jim Henson's five children.;
   In its suit, Henson Associates said that Disney had used the Muppets in
promotional materials and a live stage show, and it claimed that Disney
planned to open an attraction called "Kermit the Frog Presents Muppetvision
3-D" at Walt Disney World on May 4.;    "It's ironic that Disney, of all
people, should be named in a suit like this," said Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
entertainment industry analyst Christopher P. Dixon, noting that Disney is
famous for going to great lengths to protect its own stable of characters. "It
looks like Disney is being hoist on its own petard.";    Disney files about
200 lawsuits and regulatory actions a year against alleged violators of its
own copyrights and trademarks. The company once threatened to sue a day-care
center with paintings of Disney characters on its walls.;    Disney, in a
statement, called the Henson charges "outrageous" and "an enormous
distortion.";    Erwin Okun, Disney's senior vice president, argued that the
close working relationship between Henson Associates and Disney, which
continued after Henson's death, had created "an implied license" to use the
characters.;    Okun acknowledged that Disney has used the Muppets in a stage
show and on some merchandise but said the opening date for the 3-D attraction
"is yet to be determined." He said Disney had invested $90 million to build
Muppet-related attractions and facilities.;    The suit alleges that Disney
sought to interfere with the relationship between Henson interests and
Children's Television Workshop, the non-profit corporation that produces
"Sesame Street" and has exclusive rights to such Henson-created characters as
Big Bird and Cookie Monster.;    Okun, denouncing the lawsuit's charges as
"scurrilous" and "fantasy," said: "There are tears in Mickey's eyes today."  </TEXT>

THE MAN WHO GAVE SOUL TO THE MUPPETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Catapulted to fame by "Sesame Street," Muppet creator Jim Henson, who died 
Wednesday at age 53 in New York of a massive bacterial infection, left behind a 
dynasty of remarkable foam-and-wire creations -- Kermit the Frog, Fozzie Bear, 
Miss Piggy and Big Bird among them -- that live on with a beguiling independent 
reality of their own. 
</P>
<P>
The flamboyant vanity of Miss Piggy ("Moi?"), the endearing greed of Cookie 
Monster, the shy sweetness of Big Bird and Kermit's bemused voice of reason are 
familiar to audiences worldwide through television, films, records, books, 
toys, computer software, clothing and other Muppet merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
More significant than the marketing bonanza it became, was the fact that the 
special world of the Muppets offered a haven to children growing up in an 
increasingly troubled era, a haven where reading and numbers were fun, a haven 
without peer pressure or violence or drug dealers. Parents encouraged their 
children to walk down "Sesame Street" or soar with "Pigs in Space," secure in 
the knowledge that no harm would befall them. 
</P>
<P>
Although the characters will survive, the sorrow is that their future will lack 
the guiding hand of their gentle creator. 
</P>
<P>
Henson's genius flowered in his original exploitation of television as a visual 
medium. Earlier television shows with human and puppet characters, such as 
"Kukla, Fran and Ollie," were set up like little theater performances, with a 
human host and puppeteers behind a curtain. 
</P>
<P>
Henson created interaction between humans and Muppets -- his term for a cross 
between puppets and marionettes -- with complex, three-dimensional settings and 
crew members concealed in trenches or behind walls. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of seeing a human simply talking to a puppet, viewers were offered a 
new dimension, one where Muppets were firmly in control and human visitors had 
to cope with the eccentric surroundings as best they could. 
</P>
<P>
Muppets could appear above, below, behind or in front of their human guests. 
The effects wouldn't have worked for a live audience -- the scaffolding would 
have been visible and the cameras would have gotten in the way -- but the 
results were spectacular to home viewers. 
</P>
<P>
Without their endearing, humorous, all-too-human characteristics, however, the 
Muppets would have been just another technological surprise, to be exclaimed 
over and then dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Henson gave them more than technical life; he gave them soul. Sweet, petty, 
crusty, jealous, greedy, grumpy, wise and funny, each possessed an 
individuality with which their human counterparts could identify. 
</P>
<P>
And identify they did. Henson's Muppets became a merchandising and media 
phenomena, second only to Disney characters in their instant visual identity. 
Last year, Kermit and Mickey Mouse became a mega-team, when Henson's production 
company and the rights to his Muppet characters were purchased by the Walt 
Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
Henson's stunning artistic and commercial success were light years away from 
his high school puppet club days and a career that began in the '50s with "Sam 
and Friends," a local puppet show on a television station in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
That show, the first major outing for Kermit the Frog, won an Emmy in 1958. 
Quirky guest appearances on "The Ed Sullivan Show," "The Tonight Show" and "The 
Jimmy Dean Show" followed. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1969, came "Sesame Street," and Henson's Muppet dynasty proliferated 
with instantly appealing blue and green monsters, shaggy dogs and round-headed, 
goggly-eyed creations, helping millions of children learn letters, numbers and 
social skills. 
</P>
<P>
The first generation of "Sesame Street" viewers are now watching Oscar the 
Grouch and Bert and Ernie with their own toddlers. (This is the second major 
creative loss for "Sesame Street." Joe Raposo, its remarkable composer and 
musical director, died last year.) 
</P>
<P>
But Henson wanted to reach a wider audience, and "The Muppet Show," a 
star-studded variety program, premiered in London in 1976, before moving to the 
United States. Feature-length movies came later, and still more television 
series -- "Fraggle Rock"; "The Jim Henson Hour," an innovative mix of live 
action, computer graphics and puppetry; the Saturday morning cartoon "Muppet 
Babies"; and the HBO music appreciation series, "The Ghost of Faffner Hall." 
</P>
<P>
Not all brought commercial success -- the movies "Labyrinth" and "The Dark 
Crystal" didn't do well -- but Henson's fantastic creations continued to earn 
wide-eyed raves. 
</P>
<P>
Kermit the Frog, the reasonable mediator, frequently perplexed by an 
unreasonable world, was often referred to as the soft-spoken Henson's alter-ego 
(he was one of Henson's earliest creations and Henson supplied his voice). 
Henson, who preferred staying out of the limelight, denied that his 
award-winning creations spoke for him. In a 1984 Times interview, he said, 
"They don't do or say things I wouldn't otherwise do or say. I don't see myself 
as a repressed person hiding behind the characters." 
</P>
<P>
Yet during that interview, Henson only became voluble when he spoke as Kermit. 
To a little green frog, the spotlight was a warm and wonderful place to be.

   Jim Henson, the creator of Kermit the Frog, Miss
Piggy and the other Muppet characters, died today at a hospital. He
was 53.
   Henson died at 1:30 a.m. from a massive bacterial infection,
Kathleen Robinson, a spokeswoman at New York Hospital, said. Henson
was admitted to the hospital Tuesday, she said. Hospital officials
would say nothing else this morning.
   Friends praised Henson's humanity and his abilities to educate
and entertain children.
   ``He could make you laugh while you're crying,'' said Peggy
Charren, founder of Action for Children's Television in Cambridge,
Mass.
   ``I never met a kindler, gentler wonderful soul in the
entertainment industry or anywhere,'' said Erwin Okun, a spokesman
for Walt Disney Co. Henson's puppets grew into an industry, much of
which was purchased by Disney for a reported price of $100 million
to $150 million.
   ``We are deeply saddened, profoundly shocked at a great loss for
the world. He was a giant in the entertainment industry,'' Okun
said.
   Henson created the Muppets in 1954 and they debuted on a local
Washington, D.C., television program ``Sam and Friends,'' which won
a local Emmy in 1959.
   During the 1960s, Henson and his troupe appeared regularly on
``The Jimmy Dean Show'' and ``The Ed Sullivan Show.'' But Henson's
biggest break came when his characters appeared on the public
television hit ``Sesame Street'' in 1969.
   Henson was the voice of Kermit, one of the most popular of his
creations. His work with the Muppets earned him a variety of
awards, from a Peabody award for excellence in television
programming to a Grammy for a Muppet album.
   Henson's other creations included The Cookie Monster, Oscar the
Grouch and Miss Piggy. Henson's shop brought the Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles to the screen, where they became the nation's
top-grossing movie.
   Bob McGrath, a ``Sesame Street'' regular, said, ``Not only was
Jim a good friend for 20 years, he was the person who taught me
more than anyone else.''
   Henson's sudden death was the third to strike ``Sesame Street''
in the last year. Joe Raposo, who wrote many of the songs for the
popular children's series, died last year at age 52. A tribute to
Raposo was scheduled to air tonight. Former cast member Northern
Calloway also died recently.
   Millions of children have grown up with ``Sesame Street,'' which
is seen in more than 80 countries. It has 15 international
co-productions.
   The show is aimed at children 1 to 5, teaching basic math and
English. The program initially was intended to assist inner-city
children, but its popularity far transcended that.
   Henson produced ``The Muppet Show,'' which was broadcast from
1975 through 1981. It became the most widely seen television
program in the world, with an estimated 235 million viewers in 100
countries.
   A Saturday morning cartoon, ``The Muppet Babies,'' is currently
airing.
   Henson was born in Greenville, Miss., on Sept. 24, 1936. He
married his wife, Jane, in 1959, and they had five children.
   The family said plans for a memorial service would be announced
later.

   Puppeteer extraordinaire Jim Henson, who gave
his voice to Kermit the Frog and his elfin spirit to a multitude of
Muppets as they taught and delighted millions worldwide, died
unexpectedly Wednesday. He was 53.
   Henson, who lived in Manhattan, died at 1:30 a.m. of
complications from pneumonia, said a statement issued by New York
Hospital. Henson had been admitted to the hospital early Tuesday
with ``galloping pneumonia'' untreated for at least three days, the
hospital said.
   ``There's a lot less sunshine in the world today,'' opera diva
Beverly Sills said.
   Henson's creatures first appeared in 1954, and he watched them
explode from a local television favorite to a worldwide phenomenon
and multimillion-dollar industry.
   His ``Sesame Street'' characters, from Kermit to Oscar the
Grouch to Big Bird, were welcomed into homes around the United
States each morning for the past 21 years. It was too soon to
assess how his death would affect the show, said spokeswoman Mary
Sue Holland.
   ``The Muppet Show,'' which starred Kermit and Miss Piggy and
debuted in 1976, became the most widely seen television program in
the world, attracting an estimated 235 million viewers in 100
countries. His magic touch was evident again this year with his
work on the box office smash ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.''
   ``He was our generation's Charlie Chaplin, Mae West, W.C. Fields
and Marx Brothers, and he drew from all of them to create a new art
form,'' said Joan Ganz Cooney, chairman of Children's Television
Workshop, which produces ``Sesame Street.''
   An emotional Lena Horne, who appeared frequently with Henson's
characters over the past 20 years, said she had missed the
puppeteer Tuesday night at a gathering of the ``Sesame Street''
cast and friends. But she had no idea Henson was near death.
   ``This has just overwhelmed me,'' she said. ``We just can't
afford to keep losing our great people.''
   ``I never met a kinder, gentler, wonderful soul in the
entertainment industry or anywhere,'' said Erwin Okun, a friend and
spokesman for the Walt Disney Co.
   ``We are deeply saddened, profoundly shocked at a great loss for
the world,'' Okun said. ``He was a giant in the entertainment
industry. We are also grieving for his wonderful family.''
   Henson married his wife, Jane, in 1959, and they had five
children.
   Under an agreement signed last summer, the Walt Disney
entertainment empire purchased the rights to blend Kermit the Frog,
Miss Piggy and other animal characters created by Henson into its
theme parks, movies, TV shows and retail merchandising products.
   Henson created the Muppets 36 years ago, but they became
immensely popular after their debut in 1969 on ``Sesame Street.''
Kermit, Cookie Monster, Bert, Ernie and Grover delighted parents
while instructing their children.
   While Miss Piggy was modeled after Mae West, his characters had
star appeal that attracted diverse performers, such as opera singer
Placido Domingo and actor Danny DeVito. Characters such as ``Meryl
Sheep'' were named after celebrities.
   ``Puppets have the same sort of graceful aging that cartoon
characters have,'' Henson said in a 1986 interview. ``I'm sure
Kermit will stay younger a lot longer than I will.''
   Henson's work with the Muppets earned him many awards, including
a Peabody for excellence in television programming and a Grammy for
a Muppet album. His Saturday morning cartoon show, ``The Muppet
Babies,'' won four consecutive Emmys for outstanding animated
program.
   Henson admitted the word ``muppet'' was something he just made
up, although to appease interviewers he would say it was a
combination of ``marionette'' and ``puppet.'' In addition to
Kermit, he did the voices of Ernie and game show host Guy Smiley.
   Millions of children grew up on ``Sesame Street,'' which is seen
in more than 80 countries and has 15 international co-productions.
   The show is aimed at children 1 to 5, teaching basic math and
English to children around the world. Although the program was
initially intended to assist inner-city children, its popularity
far transcended that.
   Henson educated adults as well. ``Not only was Jim a good friend
for 20 years, he was the person who taught me more than anyone
else,'' said Bob McGrath, a ``Sesame Street'' regular for two
decades.
   Bob Keeshan, television's ``Captain Kangaroo,'' said Henson
``never talked down to children, he never degraded children, and
that's why his work was universally accepted.''
   ``His contribution was not just to children's TV,'' Keeshan
added. ``Jim's work really was universal and appreciated by adults
as much as children.''
   Fred Rogers, host of another children's program, Mister Rogers'
Neighborhood, noted Henson's enormous contributions to public
television.
   ``You could feel those puppets come alive when he put his hands
and himself into them,'' Rogers said.
   Peggy Charren, founder of Action for Children's Television, a
lobbying group, said, ``I can hardly believe it. He was so young
and there was so much ahead for him to do.''
   Henson's death was the third to strike Sesame Street in the last
year. Joe Raposo, who wrote many of the songs for the popular
children's series, died last year at age 52. A televised tribute to
Raposo was scheduled for Wednesday night. Former cast member
Northern Calloway, who played David, also died recently.
   First lady Barbara Bush, who recently appeared on ``Sesame
Street'' to promote her literacy campaign, released a statement
saying:
   ``Mr. Henson's pioneering contribution through the educational
and entertaining Sesame Street and Muppets characters was unique in
the history of television.
   ``His dedication to wholesome children's programming has
enlivened the minds of young and old alike. Mr. Henson's
originality and creativity will influence entertainers, educators
and, most important of all, children for generations to come.''
   Dr. David M. Gelmont, who treated Henson at the hospital, said
Henson apparently came down with the flu on Friday in North
Carolina, and was examined by a doctor there who did not find the
pneumonia.
   His condition worsened and Henson returned to New York on
Monday, but the pneumonia ultimately resulted in multi-organ
failure, Gelmont said. In response to a reporter's question,
Gelmont said the pneumonia was ``categorically'' not AIDS-related.
   Asked why Henson might have allowed his health to deteriorate
for several days without seeking further help, Susan Berry, a
publicist for Jim Henson Productions, replied:
   ``My guess is he was totally absorbed, he couldn't be bothered.
He was very cavalier with his health. I've known him for five
years, and I think he was sick twice during that time.''
   Henson was born in Greenville, Miss., on Sept. 24, 1936.
   The Muppets first appeared on a local Washington, D.C.,
television program ``Sam and Friends.'' Kermit made his debut on
the show, which won a local Emmy in 1959.
   During the 1960s, Henson and his troupe appeared regularly on
``The Jimmy Dean Show'' and ``The Ed Sullivan Show.'' Rowlf, a
talking dog, frequently carried on conversations with Dean.
   Things broke wide open for Henson when his characters appeared
on ``Sesame Street'' in 1969. He introduced ``The Muppet Show'' in
1976, and it captured three Emmys during its five-year syndicated
run.
   The Muppets also appeared in the first year of ``Saturday Night
Live'' in 1975. The creations for that show included the idol-like
Mighty Fuvog.
   His recent television work included ``The Ghost of Faffner
Hall'' on HBO and ``Fraggle Rock'' for cable TV. He won another
Emmy for ``The Jim Henson Hour,'' a special on NBC.
   Henson's puppets moved to the big screen in 1979 with ``The
Muppet Movie,'' followed by ``The Great Muppet Caper'' in 1981 and
the 1984, ``The Muppets Take Manhattan,'' which ended with the
marriage of Kermit and Miss Piggy.
   Henson also directed the fantasy films ``The Dark Crystal'' in
1982 and ``Labyrinth'' in 1986. He co-directed the former with
Frank Oz, the voice of Miss Piggy.
   His family said plans for a memorial service will be announced
later.

   Walt Disney Co. and Jim Henson Productions
broke off talks Thursday after failing to reach an agreement on
Disney's plans to acquire rights to Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy and
the other Muppet characters.
   The proposed deal to acquire Henson Associates Inc. was valued
at $100 million to $150 million. Disney also had sought an
exclusive production agreement with Jim Henson Productions in the
talks, which began in August 1989.
   ``We truly regret we could not come to terms,'' Disney Chairman
and Chief Executive Michael D. Eisner said in a statement.
   Erwin Okun, a senior Disney vice president, said it was too
early to tell whether the failed acquisition would preclude Disney
and Henson Productions from launching future joint productions.
However, he noted that statements issued by both companies were
cordial.
   ``We have great admiration for Jim and respect for the Henson
people, the family, who we've gotten to know pretty well,'' Okun
said.
   The Henson family, which has owned Henson Productions since the
puppeteer's death in May, said current projects with Disney would
not be affected.
   Those projects include a Disney Channel television series ``Jim
Henson's Mother Goose,'' a situation comedy series involving
dinosaurs, which is scheduled to air in January on ABC, and a 3-D
film that will be shown to visitors to Walt Disney World in
Florida.
   ``We would have liked to see this deal succeed,'' the Henson
family said in a news release. ``Unfortunately, after 18 months of
negotiating, the companies could ot reach a mutually satisfactory
agreement.''
   Henson, who died May 18, founded his production company in 1958
as Muppets Inc. to produce all his properties.
   Recent negotiations had centered around the lower price Disney
offered after Henson death.
   Analysts had speculated that his passing would lessen the value
of the acquisition. Henson's personal talents formed part of
Eisner's original strategy to cross-market Muppet characters such
as Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy with Disney creations.
   Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst with Crowell Weedon &amp; Co., said it
was more likely that Disney was scared off by hefty estate taxes
owed on Henson properties.
   ``There were enormous estate tax problems. From what I have
heard that was a major area that was problematic,'' Logsdon said.
``It gets down to them asking, `What are we really getting as a
return, what kind of money will we be making?.'''
   In losing the deal, Disney lost the opportunity to combine two
sets of highly loved and highly marketable characters, Logsdon
said.
   ``It gave Disney a whole new range of characters to utilize in
their theme parks and entertainment projects,'' Logsdon said.
   Disney reached an agreement in principle with Henson only weeks
after negotiations began last year. The deal called for Henson to
operate a Los Angeles production company under the Disney umbrella.
   Except for Kermit the Frog, Disney was not to receive rights to
Muppet characters that appear regularly on Sesame Street. Those
characters are owned in part by the show's producer, Children's
Television Workshop.

   Walt Disney Co. said it acquired Henson Associates Inc., owner of the Muppet characters. 
Terms weren't disclosed, but sources placed the transaction, which had been expected, at $150 million to $200 million. 

   Disney thus gathers up a whole host of new characters to use in its various businesses all over the world. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Disney closed at $116.75, up 25 cents. 

   Disney management has vastly increased the value of its regular characters like Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, but needs to expand the company's character base and guard against any of these characters going out of fashion or being overexposed. 
Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy and the rest of the Muppets are known by children all over the world because their TV shows have been widely syndicated. 
And Disney, more than perhaps any company, will know what to do with them. 
"I don't know if it's a marriage made in heaven," says analyst Lee S. Isgur of PaineWebber Inc., "but both sides are going to benefit." 

   Henson founder Jim Henson couldn't be reached to comment, but sources said it was he who started the process, contacting Disney's chairman, Michael Eisner, with the idea four months ago. 
Mr. Henson had deflected approaches from other companies in the past, including Disney rival MCA Inc., which tried again to get back into the bidding recently, but too late. 
Mr. Henson wanted to free himself from administrative pressures, and was eager to gain access to Disney's technological know-how in computer animation and theme park engineering. 
Most of all, say those close to Mr. Henson, the transaction was an opportunity for him to ensure that his characters would live forever. 

   The Henson film library includes five feature films, a total of nearly 300 episodes of three television series, "The Muppets," "Fraggle Rock," and "Muppet Babies," as well as a hodgepodge of other programs. 
"And they're all evergreen -- you're dealing with material that does not age," says Walt Disney Studios President Jeffrey Katzenberg. 
Disney needs programming to feed its cable service, the Disney Channel, and would take over the world-wide syndication of the properties as soon as existing agreements expire. 

   Another Henson asset is merchandising potential. 
Disney's consumer-products division operates more than 100 retail stores and licenses rights for products like diapers and toys. 
Mr. Katzenberg said music and publishing were areas Disney would further explore with the Muppets. 

   Disney won't own Henson's production company, but will have exclusive rights for its work: Disney says Mr. Henson will create motion pictures and television for the three U.S. networks, for syndication and for the Disney Channel, as well as made-for-home-video. 

   Mr. Henson also can create new characters, Mr. Katzenberg says. 
Mr. Henson will retain the royalty he collects from the Sesame Street characters he helped create but that are owned by the nonprofit Children's Television Workshop. 
In other words, Disney has no claim on Big Bird. 

   The Muppet characters also will populate Disney's theme parks. 
Work has already started on a Muppet-based attraction to open in May at Disney/MGM Studios at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., which is seeking more activities for young children.

   Walt Disney Co., which treasures its gentle image,
supposedly backed away from certain demands in its failed
negotiations to buy the late Jim Henson's company because it
feared "a public relations nightmare."
   Yesterday, it got one anyway.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Henson Associates Inc. filed a 93-page lawsuit against the
Burbank, Calif., entertainment concern in federal court in
New York. The suit, rich with anti-Disney invective, is the
first public display of a marriage made in heaven that turned
into a divorce from hell.
   The complaint charges Disney with "an ongoing pattern" of
copyright and trademark infringement in connection with
Henson's Muppet characters. It seeks to block the coming
opening in Florida's Walt Disney World of a new "Kermit the
Frog Presents Muppetvision 3-D" attraction, and the promotion
of it, saying Disney doesn't have a license to use the
characters. The suit seeks unspecified damages.
   It further charges Disney with fraud in an alleged scheme
to drain Henson's "creative juices" by conducting spurious
negotiations to buy the company until Henson employees put
finishing touches on the Muppetvision attraction. Then Disney
calculatedly broke off negotiations, the suit claims. Henson
also accuses Disney of "extreme arrogance," "corporate greed"
and of "exploiting {Jim Henson's} legacy."
   The suit even complains that Disney sold T-shirts
depicting Kermit in a "lurid neon green," which Jim Henson
never would have authorized, and objects to the use of the
Muppets in Disney's annual report. It plays on the apparent
irony of Disney's obsession with protecting its own
copyrights, and paints a picture of tiny, creative Henson up
against a corporate Goliath.
   Disney, summoning up some invective itself, called the
lawsuit "outrageous" and an "enormous distortion of the
facts."
   The bad blood between the keepers of Mickey Mouse and Miss
Piggy stems from the August 1989 Disney agreement to acquire
Henson for $150 million in cash and stock. Disney executives
gushed that it was "a perfect marriage . . . made in family
entertainment heaven."
   But nine months later, with no final deal in place after
long (and Disney says, disappointing) due diligence by
Disney, Jim Henson died of a massive bacterial infection at
age 53. Henson says Disney Chairman Michael Eisner personally
assured the family that the price wouldn't change, and
negotiations resumed. A major issue was easing the estate tax
burdens of the five Henson children.
   Finally, a deal including Disney preferred stock -- which
would better back a loan to pay the Hensons' taxes -- was
worked out, with the price remaining the same, a Henson
source says. But the talks became intense: The suit says two
Henson negotiators were offered jobs with Disney when the
deal was closed, and a lawyer from the law firm of Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, which had worked for Disney, was
threatened with the loss of Disney business.
   Disney also broached the supposedly taboo subject of
Henson's Sesame Street characters such as Big Bird and Cookie
Monster, which are controlled by the nonprofit Children's
Television Workshop and weren't included in the original
Disney talks by Mr. Henson's decree. The suit says Disney
asked Henson to restrict further licensing of the Sesame
Street characters, particularly in theme parks. But Disney
backed off, fearing a "public relations nightmare," the suit
says.
   Last December, just as the Muppetvision attraction was
being finished, Disney President Frank Wells unexpectedly
asked the Hensons to slash $25 million from the purchase
price, the suit says. Disney now says, however, that it
offered $50 million in additional payments and the assumption
of new costs and risks but that Henson sought $75 million.
   After acquisition talks broke off, the two companies began
negotiating over a license fee for the Muppetvision
attraction. Henson says it asked Disney to stop using the
Muppets in ads, without success. Disney began demanding that
Henson give it exclusive right to Muppet characters in theme
parks, the suit says.
   Despite the recent hiring by Henson of powerhouse Creative
Artists Agency to try to bring the two sides together,
negotiations broke off Tuesday and the Henson camp decided to
file the suit.
   Henson sees the litigation as a public relations shot
across Disney's bow, but Henson executives also fear Disney
is prepared "to litigate them to death," the complaint
states.
   Disney said in its statement that Henson had tried
everything to "scuttle the arrangement" with Disney since Mr.
Henson's death. Disney says it has $90 million invested in
various Henson-related activities "with the family's
knowledge and consent." On March 22, the company noted,
Henson officials visited Muppetvision and didn't recommend
any substantive changes. And Disney insisted it will "make
every effort to have Jim Henson's dream of having these
attractions at Walt Disney World still come true."
   Lisa Henson, Mr. Henson's oldest daughter, says she finds
the invoking of her late father's name by Disney "offensive."
She adds: "This idea that the Henson kids beat up on Disney
is so absurd. I'm appalled that people believe that. They
played total hardball with us every second."

   Mickey Mouse may be getting ready to step out with Miss Piggy. 

   Walt Disney Co. is negotiating to acquire closely held Henson Associates Inc., the New York-based company that controls rights to the Muppets and a host of other characters, according to individuals close to the talks. 

   A value for the transaction wasn't available, and Disney and Henson declined to comment. 
It couldn't be determined whether there were any other suitors for the Henson concern. 

   The merger would be an obvious fit, say entertainment-industry watchers, because Disney is always looking to expand its character base: Its characters can cavort in a multitude of businesses. 
In addition to making filmed entertainment and operating theme parks, Disney has a consumer-products division that distributes merchandising rights and operates a chain of retail stores that sell dolls, toys and T-shirts. 

   The Muppets have appeared in several motion pictures and a myriad of television shows for network and cable; Disney produces television shows and owns a pay cable service, The Disney Channel. 
And Disney's theme parks always have room for characters. 

   "They're really buying the licensing rights to the characters," says analyst Alan Kassan of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 
"The main thing would be the consumer products and merchandising, but there's always the possibility they could have something like a Muppet playground at a theme park." 

   One individual familiar with the talks says the economies of scale make sense in this era of consolidation in the entertainment business. 
Henson now has to pay syndication salesmen to distribute its shows; after joining Disney it could simply use the entertainment giant's existing network. 
"You can save overhead," the individual says. 

   To clear up a possible misconception: This deal wouldn't affect Big Bird, who is owned by Children's Television Workshop, a nonprofit corporation. 
Jim Henson helped create the characters on its television show "Sesame Street," but only one of those Muppets, Kermit the Frog, is a wholly owned Henson character. 
Henson Associates apparently owns a percentage of the rights to the Sesame Street characters, but a spokesperson for CTW says the details of the copyright are "proprietary." 
Mr. Henson still serves as a Sesame Street collaborator -- providing the puppeteers, and even playing the characters of Kermit and Ernie himself. 

   "Disney needs new characters because there's always a risk with Disney of overexposing the characters they do have," says one analyst, adding that the Roger Rabbit characters aren't enough to supply fresh characters to projects like the new Euro Disneyland under construction near Paris. 

   Henson Associates controls a growing library including several feature films and hours of "The Muppet Show," "Fraggle Rock" and other TV shows. 
Most are syndicated and widely seen overseas. 
CBS's cartoon hit "Muppet Babies" is produced with a partner. 
And more is coming: a feature film, "The Witches," tentatively set for October release by Warner Brothers, an HBO series and an NBC mini-series. 

   A question Disney will have to grapple with, say observers, is to what extent they integrate Henson's well-known characters with their own. 
One insider says the danger of confusing people is minimal, that Disney has taken outside characters before and made them their own. 
"Is Winnie the Pooh -- or Peter Pan," the person says, "really a Disney character?"

   The death of Jim Henson, whose warm and fuzzy
Muppets like Kermit the Frog taught and delighted millions
worldwide, shocked those who appreciated his art, but they said
they're glad his work will live on.
   ``There's a lot less sunshine in the world today,'' opera singer
Beverly Sills said after Henson's death at age 53 Wednesday of
complications from pneumonia.
   Henson created the Muppets in 1954. Kermit and some of his pals
made their debut on a Washington TV program, ``Sam and Friends,''
which won an Emmy in 1959. During the 1960s, Henson and his troupe
appeared regularly on ``The Jimmy Dean Show'' and ``The Ed Sullivan
Show.''
   But the Muppets' popularity exploded into a worldwide phenomenon
after they began appearing on ``Sesame Street'' in 1969.
   Millions of children in 80 countries grew up watching Kermit,
Cookie Monster, Oscar the Grouch, Big Bird, Bert and Ernie
cavorting on the show, which teaches basic English and math to
preschoolers.
   ``He was our generation's Charlie Chaplin, Mae West, W.C. Fields
and Marx Brothers, and he drew from all of them to create a new art
form,'' said Joan Ganz Cooney, chairman and chief executive officer
of Children's Television Workshop, which produces ``Sesame Street.''
   ``He took our breath away as a talent and provided laughter and
love as a friend. Fortunately for the children of the world, Jim
Henson's work will live on.''
   Opera singer Placido Domingo, actor Danny DeVito and singer Lena
Horne were among the real-life stars who performed with the Muppets.
   Miss Horne said Henson was absent Tuesday from a gathering of
the ``Sesame Street'' cast and friends. But she had no idea he was
near death.
   ``This has just overwhelmed me,'' said Miss Horne.
   In 1976, Henson introduced ``The Muppet Show,'' which starred
the Mae West-style femme fatale Miss Piggy. The show won three
Emmys during its five-year run and became the most widely seen TV
program in the world. Some 235 million viewers in 100 countries
watched it.
   The Muppets, in dark and macabre form, also appeared in the
first year of ``Saturday Night Live'' in 1975.
   Henson's puppets moved to the big screen in 1979 with ``The
Muppet Movie'' followed by ``The Great Muppet Caper'' in 1981 and
``The Muppets Take Manhattan'' in 1984.
   His magic touch was evident again this year with his work on the
box-office smash ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.''
   Henson, a rumpled figure with shaggy hair and a beard, said the
word ``muppet'' was something he just made up, although to appease
interviewers he would say it was a combination of ``marionette''
and ``puppet.'' Besides Kermit, he did the voices of Ernie and
game-show host Guy Smiley.
   ``Puppets have the same sort of graceful aging that cartoon
characters have,'' Henson said in 1986. ``I'm sure Kermit will stay
younger a lot longer than I will.''
   Henson's death was the third to strike ``Sesame Street'' in the
past year. Joe Raposo, who wrote many of the songs for the popular
children's series, died last year at age 52. Former cast member
Northern Calloway also died recently.
   A ``Sesame Street'' spokeswoman said it was too soon to say how
Henson's passing would affect the show.
   Dr. David M. Gelmont, who treated Henson at New York Hospital,
was asked by a reporter if Henson had AIDS. He said: ``He had
pneumonia, definitely, absolutely, no AIDS.''
   Henson had been admitted to the hospital early Tuesday with
``galloping pneumonia'' untreated for at least three days, Gelmont
said.
   Asked why Henson failed to seek more aggressive treatment for
his illness, Jim Henson Productions spokeswoman Susan Berry said:
``My guess is he's totally absorbed. He couldn't be bothered. He
was very cavalier with his health.''
   Henson was born in Greenville, Miss., in 1936. He married in
1959 and with his wife, Jane, had five children. They range in age
from 19 to 30.
   He directed the fantasy films ``The Dark Crystal'' in 1982 and
``Labyrinth'' in 1986.
   Henson won a Peabody award for excellence in TV programming, a
Grammy for a Muppet album, and four consecutive Emmys for
outstanding animation for his Saturday morning cartoon, ``The
Muppet Babies.''

   With the death of puppeteer Jim Henson, creator
and alter ego of Kermit the Frog and scores of other Muppet
characters, it is like a room crowded with old friends has fallen
suddenly silent.
   Kermit cut a heroic figure for this age, a bemused voice of
reason in an absurd world. ``It's not easy being green,'' Kermit
sang on the preschoolers' ``Sesame Street,'' but concluded that
many nice things are green.
   Henson was tall, lean, bearded, with an unruly mane of graying
brown hair and a scholar's slouch. The loudest thing about him were
his sports coats.
   He always seemed a bit uncomfortable in front of the cameras.
Exposed to this world, he would patiently explain the logic of his,
where fluffy, furry, feathered critters had quirks and qualms like
our own.
   On ``Sesame Street,'' Kermit would interview three little pigs
about construction techniques; he'd cover the cow that jumped over
the moon as if it were a NASA space shot.
   As emcee of the syndicated ``Muppet Show,'' Kermit brought
dignity (and intense frustration) to the impossible task of
mounting a variety show with dozens of Muppets and one live human,
like Liza Minnelli or Paul Simon.
   There was no joke too ancient, no sight gag too skewed, no pun
too awful that Henson and his collaborators could not dust it off
and trot it out, usually with an elegant variation, for ``The
Muppet Show.''
   In one inspired bit, singer Della Reese sits in her dressing
room surrounded by clattering shellfish. Don't ask why. ``Oh, clam
up!'' she snaps. In another scene, Muppets horrifically collide on
a ski slope to the ambling strains of ``Tumbling Tumbleweeds.''
   Through it all, Kermit would cope, or try to, where others would
give up. And Henson, even while presiding over a multimillion
dollar Muppet empire, stayed with the frog.
   Like others of his generation, Henson's first exposure to
puppets was Burr Tillstrom's TV show ``Kukla, Fran and Ollie,''
featuring hand puppets Kukla the clown and Oliver J. Dragon with
their human friend Fran Allison.
   Henson saw that television and Muppets were made for each other.
The little screen might turn humans into one-dimensional talking
heads, but Muppets literally could fill the screen with action _
top, bottom and sides.
   Henson also took his puppets out of the traditional Punch and
Judy proscenium, using sophisticated materials and technology to
create them and put them through their paces. And what wonderful
characters:
   _ Big Bird, a whopping, yellow bird on ``Sesame Street'' with
the same cares and questions about the world as any 5-year-old. If
a bird that big can have questions about things, maybe it's OK for
a small person to wonder as well.
   _ Cookie Monster, blue and shaggy with quivering, crazy eyes,
could devour non-food substances with impunity, but would lapse
into hoarsely bellowing ``Cookie? Cookie? Cookie!'' at the prospect
of eating one.
   _ Miss Piggy, a prima donna whose blond tresses, blue eyes and
snout have graced pinup calendars, famed for her shrill battle cry
and karate blows and her not-so-secret passion for Kermit _ who, of
course, wanted nothing to do with her. Frog meets pig, frog loses
pig ...
   _ Fozzie Bear, a perennially flop-sweated comedian who can't get
a chuckle from a crowd with a tankful of laughing gas.
   _ Gonzo, a beakey creature whose passion is ... chickens.
   _ Rowlf, the gravel-voiced dog whose barrelhouse piano stylings
showed off a strong left paw.
   And so on.
   Henson went into a class by himself when he moved his creations
beyond television, putting the Muppets into three feature films,
beginning with ``The Muppet Movie'' in 1979.
   In 1982, Henson directed ``The Dark Crystal,'' a fantasy
adventure set in a never-world with no human characters. He
followed its success with ``Labyrinth,'' another fantasy feature,
in 1985.
   Henson's Creature Workshop also designed the figures of the
``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' movie. Ultimately, Henson used
computers, hydraulics, radio controls and other electronic hardware
to make his puppets more lifelike.
   Henson lived his adult life doing exactly what he loved, and his
work showed it. As the theme song of ``The Muppet Movie'' concluded
about pursuing one's dreams, ``everyone needs a rainbow connection,
the lover, the dreamer and me.''

   Miss Piggy, glamorously attired in swimwear
and a broad-brimmed hat, is lounging around the hotel pool soaking
up the sun and the attention.
   The sun, high in the cloudless sky, is hot and Miss Piggy
retreats to a cabana. The hotel, like a pink fantasy surrounded by
palm trees, is reflected in the sparkling blue pool.
   Behind her, the crew rigs up a sun screen for her scenes by the
pool. Her makeup woman and wardrobe mistress await her summons.
   She pulls down her sunglasses, peers over them at a reporter and
says breathlessly, ``Please, no interviews.''
   Jim Henson, however, is willing to talk. After all, the NBC
series Miss Piggy is working on is called ``The Jim Henson Hour.''
   More than 30 years ago, Henson created ``The Muppets,'' which
has grown to include Miss Piggy, Henson's green alter ego Kermit
the Frog, Big Bird and Cookie Monster on ``Sesame Street'' and a
wide assortment of mostly lovable but sometimes gruesome creatures.
   ``The Jim Henson Hour'' is a magazine-style show that mixes
half-hour ``The Storyteller'' dramatic pieces, ``Miss Piggy's
Hollywood'' and Muppet creatures in various pieces, some of which
are enhanced by computer graphics.
   ``We had been doing `The Storyteller' and were working on a
high-tech version of a variety show and some specials when the idea
struck us of putting it all together,'' said Henson. ``We presented
it to NBC and they said OK. What it is, is two half-hour shows back
to back, but about every fourth episode we'll do an hour show.''
   One piece, called ``The Song of the Cloud Forest,'' is about an
endangered species of tree toad. The design is in the style of
South American primitive art with bright, intense colors. The
Muppet creatures are filmed against a blue ultimatte screen and the
animation-like background is generated electronically by a system
called Paintbox.
   ``Basically, everything we do involves creatures of some kind,''
said Henson. ``One show is called `Living With Dinosaurs,' which
was written by Anthony Minghella, who writes `The Storyteller.'
It's a contemporary story about a boy with a toy dinosaur that
comes to life. It's live action, but the dinosaur is a Muppet. My
son, Brian, manipulates the dinosaur. He also does the dog in `The
Storyteller.'
   ``We produce all of the shows. I have a whole separate unit in
England. They do `The Storyteller' and they're doing two of the
hour shows. They also made the creatures for `Lighthouse Island,' a
half-hour live-action show about an island with some very strange
people.''
   Henson said he wanted to do things that have never been done on
television before. ``I think we've always pushed puppetry to the
limits and now we're pushing new technologies to the limit,'' he
said. ``We're using the most sophisticated state-of-the-art
technology available. It's very exciting to mix puppets and
technology.''
   The Muppets made their first network appearance on ``The Jimmy
Dean Show'' in the early 1960s. Rowlf the talking dog carried on
frequent conversations with Dean. The first wide exposure of
various Muppet characters came on ``Sesame Street,'' whose 20th
anniversary was celebrated on ``The Jim Henson Hour'' in early May.
   ``The Muppet Show'' from 1976 to '81 ran in more than 100
countries and was seen by more than 235 million people. Kermit,
Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Animal and all the other creatures became
as famous as real celebrities. The show won three Emmys, a Peabody
and numerous other awards and honors. ``The Muppet Babies'' is an
animated Saturday morning series on CBS that has won four Emmys in
a row as best children's program and is also seen in 50 countries.
   Henson's creations inspired a series of movies, beginning with
``The Muppet Movie'' in 1979. ``The Witches,'' based on a Raold
Dahl children's story about a little boy who's turned into a mouse,
is due out later this year. His creature shop in London made the
characters for ``Dream Child'' and ``Teen-age Mutant Ninja
Turtles.''
   His production of ``Fraggle Rock,'' which ran for five years on
Home Box Office, will begin running in the Soviet Union in October.
   ``Puppetry is very advanced and very popular in Russia,'' Henson
said. ``Soviet television has a puppet pig called Krushe on every
afternoon.''
   Another series, ``Jim Henson's The Ghost of Faffner Hall,'' will
make its debut on HBO in the fall. It will feature a new set of
Muppets, including Fughetta Faffner, a ghost with a love of music
who haunts the Gothic mansion she built in the last century.

THE planned marriage between the creators of Miss Piggy and Mickey Mouse
ended in the law courts yesterday when Henson Associates, a family-run
company founded by the late Jim Henson, filed a suit against Walt Disney,
accusing Disney of knowingly violating copyrights and trademarks of the
Muppets.
The relationship between Disney and Henson dates to 1989, when the Hollywood
studio tentatively agreed to acquire the Henson film library and the rights
to some of Henson's most popular characters, including Miss Piggy and Kermit
the Frog, in a deal valued at Dollars 150m. But the arrangement started to
fall apart after Jim Henson's untimely death last year, thoughnegotiations
for a licensing agreement covering a Muppet movie due to open on May 4 and a
Muppet stage show continued until this month.
According to Henson, the negotiations failed because Disney insisted on
exclusive control of all Muppet characters in the two productions in order
to further its domination of the theme park market.
Disney, said yesterday the suit represented 'an enormous distortion of the
facts.' It said 'each Disney concession was met by another Henson demand
until finally it became impossible and the negotiations to acquire the
Henson company ended.'.

<HEAD>Henson's Death Leaves Muppet Voice Void</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KILEY ARMSTRONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death of Jim Henson left a chasm on Sesame
Street and beyond. It also left questions about who would do the
voices of Kermit the Frog and other beloved Muppet characters.
   Henson, 53, died Wednesday of multi-organ failure brought on by
complications from galloping pneumonia, said Dr. David M. Gelmont,
who treated Henson at New York Hospital.
   A memorial service was scheduled for Monday at the Cathedral of
St. John the Divine, said Susan Berry, a spokeswoman for Jim Henson
Productions.
   It was unclear what affect Henson's death would have on the
program, which is produced by the Children's Television Workshop.
   After Mel Blanc died on July 10, 1989, his son, Noel, took over
the voices of Daffy Duck, Bugs Bunny and other Warner Bros.
characters.
   Henson and with his wife, Jane, had five children who range from
age 19 to 30.
   Lisa Simon, who produces Sesame Street, said it wasn't
immediately known what would become of the voices of Kermit; Ernie,
the smiling humanoid devoted to his rubber duckie; and Guy Smiley,
``America's favorite game show host.''
   Henson always did those voices and had no substitute.
   It also wasn't known whether Henson's death _ or any new voices
for the characters _ would be explained to the children who watch
the show.
   ``We're just dealing with shock of Jim's death,'' said Simon.
   In 1982, Will Lee, the actor who played the kindly shopkeeper
Mr. Hooper, died at age 74. The next season, young viewers were
told about Mr. Hooper's death.
   Viewers got the news on the Thanksgiving program, chosen because
parents were likely to be with their children then to answer
questions.
   In a four-minute segment, players on the program explained the
death to Big Bird, who bought birdseed milkshakes from Mr. Hooper's
store.
   ``Just because,'' he was told.
   Another human character, David, said he had taken over the store
and would be providing Big Bird's beverages.
   At the end of the segment, Big Bird hung a drawing of Mr. Hooper
over his nest _ and viewers were told that a baby had been born to
a human couple on the program.
   ``That's the amazing thing about babies,'' said Big Bird. ``One
minute they're not here, the next minute they are.''
   ``Sesame Street'' reaches 11 million American households and is
broadcast in 80 countries. It has been estimated that about half of
all American children between ages 3 and 5 watch the show.
   The show is shot from September through January, and the 22nd
season begins airing next January.
   ``That gives us the opportunity to catch our breath and see
where we're going to go from here,'' said Simon. ``There are a lot
of characters on the show other than Jim's characters.''
   A Walt Disney Co. spokesman said despite Henson's death, Ponce
D. Lion and other Muppets will still get a series on the Disney
Television Channel, and a 3-D Muppet movie will be produced as
planned.
   Under an agreement signed last summer, the company purchased
rights to use Muppet characters in its theme parks, movies, TV
shows and retail products.

<HEAD>Reports: Disney Negotiating Purchase of `Muppets' Companies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Walt Disney Co. and Henson Associates
Inc. declined comment Wednesday on reports that Disney is
negotiating to buy the group of companies controlled by Jim Henson,
who created ``The Muppet Show.''
   The proposed deal for Henson Associates Inc. calls for Henson to
operate a production company in Los Angeles under the Disney
umbrella, The Hollywood Reporter said.
   The entertainment trade daily quoted an unidentified source
Monday as saying the value of the deal could exceed $100 million.
The Wall Street Journal carried a similar story Wednesday but said
it had been unable to determine a price.
   Disney spokesman Erwin Okun and Henson spokeswoman Susan Berry
declined to comment, but analysts said the Henson characters Miss
Piggy, Kermit the Frog and the other Muppets, stars of several
movies as well as TV, would fit in perfectly with Disney's Mickey
Mouse and his cohorts.
   The Muppets are probably second only to Disney's characters in
worldwide recognition, said Jeff Logsdon of the Crowell Weedon &amp; Co.
brokerage in Los Angeles.
   ``Obviously it's a franchise that extends Disney's already deep
penetration into the children's market, if it turns out to be
true,'' Logsdon said.
   ``It makes a lot of sense in terms of both companies,'' said
Harold Vogel, an analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York.
   ``Disney could use the extra characters and could merchandise
them more effectively than anyone else, and Henson has a lot of
overhead,'' Vogel said. ``Disney's distribution network would be
especially helpful for them.''
   Henson Associates, based in New York, includes Henson
International Television, which controls rights to ``The Muppet
Show,'' a videocassette label, and merchandising, licensing and
publishing divisions.
   Besides ``The Muppet Show,'' the company has produced and
distributed such programs as ``Fraggle Rock,'' ``The Storyteller''
and ``Muppet Babies,'' all successful internationally.
   Henson has distributed such shows as ``The Adventures of Teddy
Ruxpin'' on behalf of others, and last year, ``The Jim Henson Hour''
was broadcast briefly on NBC-TV, but was pulled before the end of
its run.
   The Muppets would join quite a menagerie of characters Disney has
introduced over the past two years: Roger Rabbit and the fall
release ``The Little Mermaid'' in animated movies; the top-rated
``Duck Tales'' and coming out this fall, ``Chip &amp; Dale Rescue
Rangers'' on afternoon TV.
   There's all kinds of combinations you could extend,'' Logsdon
mused. ``The Little Mermaid dates Kermit the Frog. ... They get
saved by Chip and Dale's Rescue Rangers ...''

   Despite the death of Jim Henson, Ponce D.
Lion and the other Muppets he created will still get a series on
the Disney Television Channel, and a 3-D Muppet movie will be
produced as planned, a Disney spokesman said.
   Henson, who sold rights to the immensely popular Muppets to Walt
Disney Co. last year for a reported $150 million, died Wednesday at
age 53.
   The long-term deal that brought Kermit and Miss Piggy to the
Disney menagerie included Henson's creative services as well as the
use of the Muppet characters, which are seen on TV in 100
countries. It was announced last August, but is still not final.
   Henson's office in New York declined comment on how the death
would affect the agreement with Disney. But Disney spokesman Erwin
Okun said, ``I've talked with the key people involved in the deal,
and they expect everything will proceed as usual.''
   ``He will be sorely missed, no question. But the Henson
organization is great,'' Okun said. ``Even with a giant, as he was,
it's not just a one-man organization.''
   ``Jim would be the first to say, `The show must go on,''' said
Dick Nunis, a Disney executive in Lake Buena Vista, Fla.
   Still, Henson's death added a note of uncertainty to future
Disney projects, if not the ones under way.
   Henson's creations and talent were a key part of Disney Co.
Chairman Michael Eisner's plans to cross-market characters
worldwide through films, cable and network TV, retail stores,
restaurants, home video, character licensing, theme parks and
resorts.
   Analyst Jeff Logsdon at the Crowell Weedon &amp; Co. brokerage in
Los Angeles noted that the Muppets are probably second only to
Disney in worldwide recognition. Eisner called the alliance a
``marriage made in family entertainment heaven.''
   In an interview this year with The Associated Press, Henson said
he was happy to see his characters frolicking in the Disney
environments.
   ``I love the parks,'' Henson said. ``They have been among my
favorite places for years. Now that I'm actually designing things
for the parks, I'm having a lot of fun.''
   ``Obviously he was a great creative spark and a genius, and his
loss will be felt,'' said Harold Vogel, a Merrill Lynch
entertainment analyst. ``He would have come up with lots of others
things if he'd lived another 10 or 15 years.

<HEAD>Disney Acquisition of Henson Productions Falls Through</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walt Disney Co. and the family of the late
Jim Henson, creator of the Muppets, broke off talks after failing
to reach agreement in Disney's 18-month bid to acquire Henson
Associates Inc.
   Disney also had sought an exclusive production agreement in the
deal valued at $100 million to $150 million.
   ``We truly regret we could not come to terms,'' Disney chairman
Michael D. Eisner said Thursday.
   Erwin Okun, a Disney Co. vice president, said it was too early
to tell whether the failed acquisition would preclude the two
companies from attempting future joint productions. He noted that
statements issued by both companies were cordial.
   The Henson family, which has owned Henson Associates since the
puppeteer's death in May, said current projects with Disney would
not be affected by the termination of talks.
   Those projects include a Disney Channel television series, ``Jim
Henson's Mother Goose''; a television sitcom involving dinosaurs,
to be aired in January on ABC; and a 3-D film visitors would see at
Walt Disney World in Florida.
   ``We would have liked to see this deal succeed,'' the Henson
family said in a statement. ``Unfortunately, after 18 months of
negotiating, the companies could not reach a mutually satisfactory
agreement.''
   Henson, the genius behind such characters as Kermit the Frog and
Miss Piggy, founded his production company in 1958 as Muppets Inc.
to produce all his properties.
   Recent negotiations had centered around the lower price Disney
offered after Henson died of pneumonia May 18.
   Industry analysts at first speculated that Henson's death
lessened the value of the acquisition. Henson's personal talents
formed part of Eisner's original strategy to cross-market Muppet
characters with Disney creations.
   Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst with Crowell Weedon &amp; Co., said it
was more likely that Disney was scared off by hefty estate taxes
owed on Henson properties.

   Jim Henson's admirers gave him the whimsical,
colorful send-off he wanted, complete with songs, dance and, of
course, the Muppets.
   ``We had such great silly fun together,'' said Frank Oz, who
played Bert to Henson's Ernie, and Miss Piggy to his Kermit the
Frog. ``The best thing is when you watched Jim laugh until he
cried.''
   Thousands took part in the tribute to the master puppeteer
Monday at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. Henson died
Wednesday of pneumonia at 53.
   The happy songs, happy words and a Dixieland band were in
accordance with wishes Henson expressed in letters to his family,
written four years ago and opened after his death. Henson had asked
that mourners not wear black.
   The funeral service program contained a quote from Henson:
``Please watch out for each other and love and forgive everybody.
It's a good life, enjoy it.'
   An organist opened with a mournful rendition of the theme from
``Sesame Street,'' which used the Muppets to entertain and educate
children worldwide.
   Then a band strolled in playing ``Please Release Me,'' followed
by ministers, a red-and-white robed church choir and family members.
   ``There is no question about Jim Henson's great artistry and the
extent to which we have all been touched by it,'' Harry Belafonte
said. ``Greater than his artistry was his humanity.''
   Mourners fluttered colorful butterflies atop metal stems as
Belafonte and three back-up singers sang ``Turn the World Around,''
a song he wrote and Henson used.
   The mourners again fluttered their butterflies while listening
to a recording of Henson as Kermit singing ``Rainbow Connection''
from ``The Muppet Movie.''
   Big Bird, a character played by Caroll Spinney, sang, ``It's Not
Easy Being Green,'' a number usually done by Kermit. Afterward, Big
Bird looked heavenward, said, ``Thank you, Kermit,'' then slowly
walked away, head hung low.
   The 5,000-seat cathedral was nearly full and lined with colorful
floral arrangements, some with animal figures in them. At the
entrance was a gallery of photos with Henson, his family and
``Sesame Street'' characters.
   ``He's stayed with us long enough to give us certainly all we
need, if we're strong enough to carry on,'' said Henson's widow,
Jane, who stood with their five children to address the
congregation.
   Her advice to the mourners was, ``Enjoy life to the fullest. He
always did, but always with a little pain, a little sorrow that
gave it richness.''
   Henson's son Brian read excerpts from his father's letters.
   ``Don't feel bad that I'm gone,'' Henson wrote to his children.
``It will be an interesting time for me. ... I look forward to
seeing all of you when you come over.''

   LOS ANGELES -- Walt Disney Co. and Henson Associates Inc.
settled their bitter dispute over the licensing of the Muppet
characters, allowing Disney to operate the Muppet attraction
it built at Walt Disney World in Florida, but under severely
restricted terms.
   Henson, for its part, received an apology and a licensing
agreement with both a shorter term and more limited
exclusivity than Disney had sought. This has the effect of
giving Henson more freedom to sell the company or license the
Muppet characters to one of Disney's rivals. Henson agreed to
drop the trademark-infringement suit it filed in federal
court in New York after licensing talks collapsed April 16,
and Disney agreed to withdraw its counterclaim. A trial had
been set for May 13.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The agreement, valued at more than $10 million by people
close to the settlement, calls for Henson to grant Disney an
18-month license for its new attraction, "Kermit the Frog
Presents: MuppetVision 3-D" and for a live stage show, "Here
Come the Muppets," which has been at the park since last
June. During this period, the characters within the
attractions -- Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear and others --
will be exclusive to Disney in theme parks east of the
Mississippi.
   Disney also received a 3 1/2-year option to extend these
rights, for a total of five years. The term is notably short.
Disney had sought 10 to 12 years; the exclusivity is for only
the first three years.
   The exclusivity issue was critical, because Henson has
been for sale. Disney agreed to acquire it for $150 million
in cash and stock in August 1989, conducted difficult
negotiations until company founder Jim Henson's death last
May, then negotiated with Mr. Henson's five children until
talks fell apart last December.
   Henson has explored acquisition by other companies,
including entertainment giants with theme-park interests,
notably MCA Inc., a unit of Matsushita Electric Industrial
Co., and Time Warner Inc., which owns a large stake in Six
Flags.
   Individuals close to the agreement say Henson has creative
control over all advertising and welcomes the Disney exposure
as long as it doesn't talk about "Disney's Muppets." Disney
will be able to sell Muppet merchandise at the park, and
create park-specific merchandise.
   Henson had demanded an apology from Disney and news
releases issued by each company included the phraseology,
"with deep regret for what a Disney spokesman described as a
serious misunderstanding, and apologies to the Henson family
and their company for any harm that may have been caused. . .

   The entertainment world lost two major figures on Wednesday,
Sammy Davis Jr., who danced and sang in the spotlight, and Jim
Henson, whose creative genius gave center stage to Kermit the Frog,
Miss Piggy and Big Bird.
   Henson, who created Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy and Big Bird,
died unexpectedly of complications from pneumonia. He was 53.
   Davis, who became an entertainment institution as the gilded
song-and-dance man who ``could do it all,'' died after an
eight-month battle with throat cancer. He was 64.
   ``There's a lot less sunshine in the world today,'' opera diva
Beverly Sills commented on hearing of Henson's death.
   And Joey Bishop, who with Davis, Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin
formed the core of Hollywood's fun-loving, high-living but
hard-working ``Rat Pack'' in the 1960s, said of Davis: ``I guess
they need a good show up in heaven, that's all I can say. He was a
wonderful person.''

<HEAD>Henson Dies At New York Hospital</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Henson had been admitted to New York Hospital early Tuesday with
``galloping pneumonia'' that had gone untreated for at least three
days, the hospital said. He was 53.
   Dr. David M. Gelmont, who treated Henson at the hospital, said
Henson apparently came down with the flu on Friday in North
Carolina, and was examined by a doctor there who did not find the
pneumonia.
   His condition worsened and Henson returned to New York on
Monday, but the pneumonia ultimately resulted in multi-organ
failure, Gelmont said. In response to a reporter's question,
Gelmont said the pneumonia was not AIDS-related.
   Henson's creatures first appeared in 1954, and he watched them
explode from a local television favorite to a worldwide phenomenon
and multimillion-dollar industry.
   His ``Sesame Street'' characters, from Kermit to Oscar the
Grouch to Big Bird, were welcomed into homes around the United
States each morning for the past 21 years. It was too soon to
assess how his death would affect the show, said spokeswoman Mary
Sue Holland.
   ``The Muppet Show,'' which starred Kermit and Miss Piggy and
debuted in 1976, became the most widely seen television program in
the world, attracting an estimated 235 million viewers in 100
countries. His magic touch was evident again this year with his
work on the box office smash ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.''
   ``He was our generation's Charlie Chaplin, Mae West, W.C. Fields
and Marx Brothers, and he drew from all of them to create a new art
form,'' said Joan Ganz Cooney, chairman of Children's Television
Workshop, which produces ``Sesame Street.''
   An emotional Lena Horne, who appeared frequently with Henson's
characters over the past 20 years, said she had missed the
puppeteer Tuesday night at a gathering of the ``Sesame Street''
cast and friends. But she had no idea Henson was near death.
   ``This has just overwhelmed me,'' she said.
   Fred Rogers, host of another children's program, Mister Rogers'
Neighborhood, noted Henson's enormous contributions to public
television.
   ``You could feel those puppets come alive when he put his hands
and himself into them,'' Rogers said.
   ``I never met a kinder, gentler, wonderful soul in the
entertainment industry or anywhere,'' said Erwin Okun, a friend and
spokesman for the Walt Disney Co.
   ``We are deeply saddened, profoundly shocked at a great loss for
the world,'' Okun said. ``He was a giant in the entertainment
industry. We are also grieving for his wonderful family.''
   Henson married his wife, Jane, in 1959, and they had five
children.
   Under an agreement signed last summer, the Walt Disney
entertainment empire purchased the rights to blend Kermit the Frog,
Miss Piggy and other animal characters created by Henson into its
theme parks, movies, TV shows and retail merchandising products.
   Millions of children grew up on ``Sesame Street,'' which is seen
in more than 80 countries and has 15 international co-productions.
   The show is aimed at children 1 to 5, teaching basic math and
English to children around the world.
   Henson was born in Greenville, Miss., on Sept. 24, 1936.

<HEAD>Davis Dies At Home in Beverly Hills</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Davis's business manager Shirley Rhodes told reporters outside
his house in Beverly Hills that he died there ``peacefully in his
sleep'' with his wife, Altovise, and three of his four children
present.
   Frank Sinatra said of Davis:
   ``I wish the world could have known Sam as I did. It was a
generous God who gave him to us for all these years, and a heaven
with his magic gives me warmth.''
   ``Sammy was a little prince who loved everything life had to
offer,'' said Shirley MacLaine, another ``rat-packer.''
   ``I am numb with pain. He was my inspiration. He's the performer
we all strived to live up to. I never saw anyone give so much,''
said Liza Minnelli, who toured with Davis and Sinatra last year.
   ``He gave his heart and soul to every performance and he was a
true American institution. There will never be another one like
Sammy,'' said former President Reagan.
   ``He'll never be replaced and my sympathies go to his wife and
children,'' said Milton Berle, who had known Davis for more than 60
years.
   ``People just couldn't get enough of Sammy. He could do it all _
sing, dance, comedy,'' Bob Hope said.
   Davis, whose hit songs included ``The Candy Man'' and ``I've
Gotta Be Me,'' was born in New York's Harlem on Dec. 8, 1925, and
began dancing at age 1{.
   Over the years, Davis joked that he was the nation's only
``black, one-eyed, Jewish entertainer.'' He converted to Judaism
while recovering from an automobile accident that cost him his left
eye and nearly took his life.
   An actor, singer, dancer and impressionist, the exuberant Davis
lived life hard and fast. His gold chains, heavy rings and gaudy
bracelets were as much a part of his personality as the chain of
cigarettes he smoked.
   His work on stage, screen and television displayed a versatility
matched by few. Though scorned by some as merely a gilded Las Vegas
drone, and criticized by others as being a token of the ``Rat
Pack,'' Davis was greatly admired and respected as an entertainer's
entertainer.
   Davis appeared in more than 20 movies and starred in two
Broadway productions _ ``Mr. Wonderful'' and ``Golden Boy.'' He
received a Tony nomination for best actor in a musical for ``Golden
Boy'' in 1965 but lost to Zero Mostel, who won for ``Fiddler on the
Roof.''
   His lively, upbeat manner belied a very difficult life. His
career was scarred by vicious racial bigotry. There were endless
taunts, and at one time, he couldn't gamble or rent a room in some
of the Las Vegas hotels at which he played.
   His second marriage, to Swedish actress Mai Britt, was scorned
by some.
   He also faced drug and alcohol abuse and crippling tax problems.
   His last movie was 1989's ``Tap,'' in which he co-starred with
Gregory Hines as an old-time hoofer, Little Mo. The movie captures
Davis' last dance performance on film, a brief tap routine made
poignant because he had undergone painful hip surgery in 1985 and
received an artificial hip in 1988.

   There has been much argument over the past two
decades about the exact merits of ``Sesame Street,'' but none over
the crucial role Jim Henson's Muppets played in the television
program's phenomenal popularity.
   It was unclear Wednesday what affect Henson's death would have
on the program, which is produced by the Children's Television
Workshop.
   ``There's no way of telling,'' said Mary Sue Holland, a
spokeswoman for CTW. ``We honestly don't know.''
   ``Sesame Street'' reaches 11 million American households and is
broadcast in 80 foreign nations. It has been estimated that about
half of all American children between 3 and 5 watch the show.
   Bob McGrath, an actor on the program, returned a telephone call
to The Associated Press but said he and other cast members had been
asked by Henson's family not to speak with the news media. He
referred questions to CTW.
   ``In the beginning (Henson) certainly was the key figure in
developing characters and their style, but over 20 years they've
grown and matured, so there's a team there now,'' said Dr. Milton
Chin, director of instructional television for KQED in San
Francisco and a former researcher for CTW.
   ``There's a lot of talent all around (at Henson Productions),
but they'll be missing the creator,'' he added.
   The Muppets first regular, widespread exposure came when
``Sesame Street'' went on the air in 1969. The characters indulge
in slapstick, introduce video clips and live performances and
participate in skits. They have sung with Ray Charles and played
tennis with Martina Navratilova. Kathleen Turner has read them
bedtime stories, and Tracy Ullman has told them jokes.
   The show's Muppets have been created, assembled and dressed in
Henson's office-factory in Manhattan. He once denied that they were
created with any human personality in mind: ``With Big Bird we knew
we wanted to do a large, a great big character. He should represent
a child, so he can make the kinds of mistakes that kids make, and
talk about it and be out front about that. So we wanted this large,
kooky creature.''
   Henson's contributions to the show twice won him Emmys and made
stars of these characters:
   _Big Bird, the yellow 6-footer who still manages to see and
enjoy life like a small fry.
   _Oscar the Grouch, a beast of indeterminate species who lives in
a garbage can and complains about the (high) quality of life on
Sesame Street.
   _Bert and Ernie, humanoid companions who are attached,
respectively, to a paper clip collection and a yellow rubber duckie.
   _The Cookie Monster, a shaggy blue beast who was named for his
chief weakness.
   _Kermit the Frog, who appears as a live, if bumbling, television
correspondent at the scene of the such fairy tales as The Princess
and the Pea and Cinderella.
   _Guy Smiley, ``America's favorite game show host.''
   _The Count, an Eastern European of noble birth who is obsessed
with numbers.
   Henson was the voice and puppeteer for Kermit, Ernie and Guy
Smiley, and it was hard to see how, at least in this capacity, he
could be replaced.

   BURBANK, Calif. -- Walt Disney Co. and Jim Henson
Productions Inc., as expected, announced a home-video
alliance in which Disney will distribute Henson
videocassettes world-wide for five to six years.
   Videocassettes of movies and TV shows from the Henson
video library will be distributed by Disney's Buena Vista
Home Video division under a new video label, Jim Henson Home
Video. The deal also includes international TV rights for the
Henson library.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The agreement could translate into tens of millions of
dollars in revenue, but neither company would disclose profit
estimates. The companies only described the deal as a
"multimillion-dollar" arrangement.
   Brian Henson, president and chief executive officer of Jim
Henson Productions, said releases will include movies never
before released on video as well as TV shows and new
made-for-video productions. Executives involved in the new
venture said the releases probably will begin next fall and
be priced for retail sales.
   Jim Henson created well-loved and recognizable characters
including Muppet characters such as Miss Piggy and Kermit the
Frog. The Henson library contains feature films, some of
which have been released on video previously, including "The
Muppet Movie," "The Great Muppet Caper" and "Dark Crystal."
The TV series in the library include "The Muppet Show,"
"Muppet Babies" and "Fraggle Rock."

THE MUPPET MAN JOINS HIS CUDDLY CREW; 
</P>
<P>
HENSON VARIETY SHOW WILL DEBUT TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After more than 20 years as the man behind the Muppets, Jim Henson is 
understandably reluctant to come out from behind the curtain. 
</P>
<P>
But Henson, 52, has decided to brave the cameras as host of a series for NBC, 
"The Jim Henson Hour," a comedy-variety program that blends old Muppets, some 
new Muppets, live action and computer animation and debuts at 8 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
NBC had originally planned to introduce the series in January, but it was 
postponed due to production delays and lack of an appropriate time slot. Henson 
had hoped the show would land in the 7 p.m. Sunday time slot now occupied by 
"The Magical World of Disney." 
</P>
<P>
But in any time slot, Henson said in an interview, he was not terribly pleased 
to find himself thrust into the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
"I always prefer to be slightly behind camera," said Henson, a professorially 
absent-minded sort with longish gray hair and a neat beard of the same hue. 
"But (appearing on camera) seemed like the logical thing for this type of a 
show." 
</P>
<P>
The type of show Henson meant is the family variety hour, a genre that has had 
few successful incarnations in recent years. By coming out for a fireside chat 
with the audience, Henson hopes to re-create the magic of Walt Disney's family 
series, which has survived in various incarnations since 1958 -- most of which 
featured the grandfatherly Walt in conversation with his audience, as well as 
his animated friends. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Frons, the NBC programming vice president overseeing the show, thinks the 
Henson hour has a chance to resuscitate variety shows. 
</P>
<P>
Today's audience has grown too sophisticated for the traditional song-and-dance 
variety shows, he said, but they remain eager to sample new varieties of 
variety. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Real People' in 1979 and 1983's 'Bloopers and Practical Jokes' were variety 
shows," he said. "And I know this is going to sound strange, but 'Unsolved 
Mysteries' (NBC's real-life crime series), while it is not a variety show in 
the traditional or any other sense of the word, is a new form, it's reinventing 
the form. I think Henson would fall into the same category." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Henson show has been in development for two years, Frons said the 
series also fits nicely into the network's plan to provide more wholesome 
family shows -- partly in response to the recent deluge of complaints about 
"trash TV" programming on the networks. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that, in an attempt to respond to the viewers and the 
advertisers, whom we have heard loud and clear, we are trying to show that we 
are a full-service network, and that we have things we can point to with 
pride," Frons said. 
</P>
<P>
Unconcerned with network politics, Henson only hopes he can fall into the same 
category as Kermit the Frog. Henson, who performs the voice of Kermit, believes 
his presence can be the amiable glue that holds the format-less show together 
-- much as Kermit provides the voice of sanity among the motley Muppets. Kermit 
will co-host the variety show, 12 episodes of which have been ordered. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to think that Kermit was a normal person in the middle of a bunch of 
crazies," Henson mused. "And I guess I sort of see myself in that role." 
</P>
<P>
The show's collection of oddball characters is even broader and more colorful 
than Henson's usual. "The Jim Henson Hour" rockets Muppetry into the Space Age 
by creating Muppet Central, a computer-generated control room from which Kermit 
and other regulars program the show. Among those regulars is Waldo C. Graphic, 
a colorful, hummingbird-sized, computer-generated entity who travels at high 
speed among the Muppets and human guest stars. Also new to the Muppet clan is 
Digit, an off-kilter half-human-half-robot, who helps Kermit run Muppet 
Central. 
</P>
<P>
Other new Muppets include characters of the more traditionally cuddly sort, 
including the relentlessly adorable Bean Bunny -- hired by Kermit to be cute, 
as Henson said, "so the rest of us don't have to be." Bean's aggressive side, 
however, will be revealed in a future sequence titled "Bambo." 
</P>
<P>
Henson at first did not want to get involved in the NBC project, having plenty 
of other projects to keep him busy. His New York-based company, Henson 
Associates, produces Saturday morning cartoon series, cable TV series, live 
arena shows and feature films and runs a healthy licensing business for Muppet 
products. Henson dreams of doing a Broadway show based on his characters. 
</P>
<P>
But NBC managed to land him, he said, by offering him the opportunity to do a 
show whose format can vary from week to week. The series also provides a new 
forum for Henson's "The Storyteller," an Emmy Award-winning collection of 
live-action fables hosted by John Hurt, which formerly ran on NBC as occasional 
specials. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are nice," Henson said modestly. "They won a couple of Emmys. They're 
some of the prettiest television we've ever done." 
</P>
<P>
Along with "The Storyteller," the second half-hour each week will feature 
dramatic pieces, including the animated "Snake Samba" -- which Henson says 
creates a "whole new look," with bright paint-box colors culled from African 
art -- and "Dog City," a parody of several old movie classics with a cast of 
animated canines. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, the entire Henson hour will be devoted to one subject; some 
upcoming specials include "Living With Dinosaurs," the story of a 9-year-old 
boy and his stuffed prehistoric pet, and "Monster Maker," about a teen-ager who 
gets a job building the creatures for fantasy films. 
</P>
<P>
Henson said the show will blend child-pleasing Muppet antics with sophisticated 
adult satire in hopes of appealing to both age groups. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a chance to do something outside of 'Sesame Street,' which is 
specifically aimed at children," he said. "We do this show at a level we 
enjoy."

   Walt Disney Co. filed a counterclaim against Henson
Associates Inc. and agreed not to open a new theme-park
attraction in Florida until at least May 24, allowing time
for a federal judge in New York to rule on a
copyright-infringement lawsuit filed against Disney by
Henson.
   Henson, in turn, won't seek an injunction to block the
opening of "Kermit the Frog Presents Muppetvision 3-D" at
Walt Disney World. Instead, U.S. District Court Judge Pierre
Leval will hear arguments from both sides beginning May 13,
then rule on the merits.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Disney also filed a counterclaim yesterday, denying the
allegations, seeking its own unspecified damages and giving
some hints of its defense. Disney argues that it had an oral
contract and an implied license to use the Muppet characters.
   Disney began planning to build the attraction after it
said it intended to acquire Henson in 1989. But terms
couldn't be reached, relations deteriorated, acquisition
talks fell apart last December, and, finally, negotiations
over the licensing of the Muppet characters at Walt Disney
World broke down last week. Henson filed the lawsuit the next
day saying Disney didn't have permission to use the Muppets.
   The language in Disney's counterclaim is only slightly
less withering than that in Henson's lawsuit. Henson didn't
file its suit "to protect the `beloved Muppets' or {founder}
Jim Henson's `legacy', but, rather, because the heirs of Jim
Henson wanted different terms and more money for their
father's company than Disney and their father ever
contemplated."
   After Mr. Henson died in May 1990, Disney says, Henson
asked for an increase in price to account for estate taxes.
Henson has denied this. Disney accuses Henson of dragging its
feet in negotiations because it was "positioning itself for
litigation" last fall. Disney also said it spent $90 million
for the Muppetvision attraction and other Muppet-related
matters. It asks for the return of $2 million it says it
already paid Henson for work performed on the attraction.
   The Disney counterclaim also accuses Henson of circulating
its news release announcing the suit last week to securities
analysts as well as reporters, and says Henson contacted
Disney as early as 1984 about the possibility of Disney
acquiring Henson.
   A Henson spokesman said of Disney's basic argument, "Why
would Disney negotiate for months over a license if it
already had one?"

   Colleagues and friends around the world
remembered Muppet master Jim Henson as a creative genius who
possessed the carefree spirit of a child.
   ``There's a lot less sunshine in the world today,'' opera diva
Beverly Sills said after Henson's death was announced.
   ``He was our era's Charlie Chaplin, Mae West, W.C. Fields and
Marx Brothers,'' said Joan Ganz Cooney, chairman of Children's
Television Workshop, a non-profit educational company that produces
``Sesame Street.''
   ``He took our breath away as a talent and provided laughter and
love as a friend,'' she said. ``Fortunately for the children of the
world, Jim Henson's work will live on.''
   ``I never met a kinder, gentler, wonderful soul in the
entertainment industry or anywhere,'' said Erwin Okun, a spokesman
for the Walt Disney Co., which last summer purchased the rights to
use Henson's characters.
   Henson died early Wednesday at New York Hospital of what the
hospital said was ``galloping pneumonia'' that had gone untreated
for at least three days and resulted in multi-organ failure. He was
53.
   ``I'm absolutely gobsmacked,'' said Mark Shivas, who produced
Henson's television series ``The Storyteller,'' and served as
producer to executive producer Henson on the upcoming Anjelica
Huston movie ``The Witches.''
   Shivas, speaking by telephone from the Cannes Film Festival in
France, said Henson was extraordinarily generous.
   ``Even when one had not worked with him for a year, a Christmas
hamper from Harrods would always arrive.''
   ``The medium of television and the world of entertainment will
miss his vision and his gift,'' Brandon Tartikoff, president of
NBC, for which Henson did ``The Storyteller,'' said in a statement.
   NBC said Henson had been developing a four-hour ``Gulliver's
Travels'' special.
   Lena Horne, who crooned ``It's Not Easy Being Green'' with
Henson's alter ego, Kermit the Frog, said she was overwhelmed by
the news.
   She said she was at a party Tuesday night in tribute to ``Sesame
Street's'' late composer, Joe Raposo, and ``the Cookie Monster gave
me a hello from Jim Henson, who said he was so sorry he couldn't be
there.'' Miss Horne said she had no idea he was sick.
   Bob McGrath, a ``Sesame Street'' cast member, said, ``Not only
was Jim a good friend for 20 years, he was the person who taught me
more than anyone else.''
   McGrath made his comments following an unrelated interview
Wednesday morning at CBS radio. He later said the cast was asked
not to speak about Henson's death.
   ``He was so young and there was so much ahead for him to do for
children's media and children's entertainment,'' said Peggy
Charren, founder of the Massachusetts-based Action for Children's
Television.
   She said she considered Henson to be a friend and said ``from
the beginning, Jim couldn't do enough for us.''
   ``Ours was the first network exposure he had,'' said country
singer turned sausage maker Jimmy Dean. Henson's irreverent,
piano-playing puppet, Rowlf the dog, was a favorite on Dean's
television show from 1961 to 1963.
   ``Jim always told me the reason he thought Rowlf was so well
accepted was because I treated him like he was real. Jim made him
real. I sometimes wondered whose head was stuffed with sponge
rubber.''
   Fred Rogers, host of ``Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,'' said,
``You could feel those puppets come alive when he put his hands and
himself into them. ... His own playful spirit can't help but come
through.''
   Bob Keeshan, television's ``Captain Kangaroo,'' said Henson
``never talked down to children, he never degraded children, and
that's why his work was universally accepted.''
   Larry Harmon, better known as Bozo the Clown, said, ``His
passing is a tremendous blow to children of all ages around the
world.''
   Harmon's statement said Henson made his first TV appearance on a
Washington, D.C., production of Harmon's ``Bozo Show,'' whose host
was Willard Scott.
   ``We all knew from the very beginning that he was a true genius
and that God had given him a very special talent,'' said Scott, the
``Today'' show's weatherman.
   ``Jim was not simply the voice of Kermit,'' he added. ``Kermit
was the soul of Jim.''

There were happy songs, upbeat words, an overflow crowd of 5,000 and a gaggle 
of Muppet pals at a memorial service Monday for Jim Henson. 
</P>
<P>
Henson, who used the Muppets he created to entertain and educate children on 
"Sesame Street" and elsewhere, died Wednesday of pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
He was 53. 
</P>
<P>
Henson had written instructions for his funeral four years ago that were opened 
after his death. He said he wanted the occasion to be a happy one and that 
mourners should not wear black. 
</P>
<P>
An old green coat emblazoned with a frog-shaped piece of scarlet cloth greeted 
mourners as they entered the church. The coat symbolized one belonging to 
Henson's mother, from which he was said to have cut material to make the 
original Kermit the Frog. 
</P>
<P>
With Big Bird and Harry Belafonte on hand, an organist began the service with a 
rendition of the "Sesame Street" theme song, "Sunny Day." 
</P>
<P>
Then the Dirty Dozen Dixieland band strolled in playing, "Please Release Me," 
followed by ministers, a red-and-white robed church choir and family members. 
</P>
<P>
Mourners fluttered colorful butterflies atop metal stems as Belafonte and three 
backup singers sang, "Turn the World Around," a song Belafonte wrote and Henson 
used. 
</P>
<P>
Big Bird, a character played by Carroll Spinney, sang, "It's Not Easy Being 
Green," a number usually done by Kermit. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Big Bird looked heavenward, said, "Thank you, Kermit," then slowly 
walked away, head hung low.

WALT DISNEY has filed a counter-claim against Henson Associates, a
family-run company founded by the late Jim Henson, denying allegations that
it knowingly violated copyrights and trademarks of the Muppets puppet
characters and seeking unspecified damages, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
Henson Associates filed its copyright-infringement suit to prevent Disney
from using the Muppets without a licence on April 17. A trial on the merits
of the suit will begin on May 13.
Disney has agreed not to open 'Kermit the Frog Presents Muppetvision 3-D'
before May 24.
Disney had conditionally agreed to acquire the Henson film library and the
right to some of Henson's most popular characters in 1989, in a deal valued
at about Dollars 150m. However the relationship between Disney and Henson
started to disintegrate after Mr Jim Henson's death last year.

   Jim Henson, who died yesterday at age 53 of a massive
bacterial infection, had already begun numerous projects at
Walt Disney Co. since Disney agreed to acquire his company
last year. And these projects will go forward as planned,
executives said.
   "We vow to do all that we can to see that the
extraordinary legacy of this great friend and colleague will

   Mr. Henson created the Muppets and a host of other
characters known world-wide. Last August, Disney agreed to
acquire New York-based Henson Associates Inc. (which excludes
Mr. Henson's participation in the television characters on
"Sesame Street") for about $100 million to $150 million. Mr.
Henson has been active in every phase of Disney's operation
since then, although the transaction has not been formally
completed.
   At Disney's theme parks, a Muppet show and daily parades
are scheduled to begin at Walt Disney World's Disney-MGM
Studios in Orlando, Fla., on June 15. Mr. Henson was
finishing up a filmed attraction set to open at Disney-MGM
next year and at Disneyland in California in 1993. A "Muppet
Movie Ride" is scheduled to open at Disney-MGM in 1993.
Disney officials say they don't expect any delays in the
projects.

   Will Disneyland's Abe Lincoln be deposed
by Kermit the Frog and the Muppet gang?
   ``Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln,'' which features a robot
replica of the 16th U.S. president, will close at least temporarily
Aug. 26, Disneyland spokesman Bob Roth said Friday.
   Roth would not comment on employee reports that a 3-D movie
featuring the late Jim Henson's Muppet characters will replace
Lincoln. But he did say no reopening date for the 25-year-old
Lincoln attraction had been set.
   ``It's a refurbishing of that whole facility,'' said Roth.
``We'll be announcing our plans.''
   The Lincoln attraction is housed in the Disneyland Opera House,
which also holds exhibits on the park and its founder, Walt Disney.
   Disney himself developed the ``audio-animatronic'' Lincoln,
which premiered at the 1964 New York World's Fair and moved to
Disneyland in 1965. Lincoln stands up from a chair, gestures and
recites excerpts from his speeches.
   Disney ``was extremely proud of creating that figure,'' Roth
said. The Lincoln attraction underwent a $200,000 renovation about
five years ago.
   According to park employees who spoke on condition of anonymity,
the Muppet movie is replacing Lincoln as part of Disneyland's
effort to give a higher profile to Henson's characters.
   Disney officials announced earlier this year that a Muppet stage
show and parade were planned for the park in 1991, while a 3-D
``Muppetvision'' movie and theater was set for 1993.
   Disney last year purchased rights to use the Muppet characters
in its theme parks, movies, teleivison shops and retail products.
   Asked about the chance the Muppet image could swamp the older
Disney characters such as Mickey Mouse, Roth noted that when
changes have been made in the past _ such as teaming with filmmaker
George Lucas to create ``Star Tours'' and ``Captain Eo'' _ there
was criticism.
   ``Every time you do something like that there will be people who
are unhappy, saying that's not how Walt Disney would have done
it,'' he said.

   Sammy Davis Jr., the exuberant
song-and-dance man who started as a goggle-eyed child vaudevillian
and battled to the glittery top of the entertainment world, died
Wednesday of throat cancer at age 64.
   Davis performed on stage, on television and in the movies as an
actor, singer, dancer and impressionist _ a powerhouse packed into
a bantam, 5-foot-6 frame.
   His hit songs included ``Something's Gotta Give'' (1955), ``I've
Gotta Be Me'' (1969) and ``The Candy Man'' (1972). His films
included ``Porgy and Bess,'' ``Oceans 11'' ``Robin and the Seven
Hoods'' and ``Sweet Charity.''
   Davis began as a tap-dancing toddler in Harlem.
   His energetic performances and upbeat manner were therapy for a
life scarred by bigotry, failed marriages, drug and alcohol abuse
and crippling tax problems.
   His last movie was 1989's ``Tap,'' in which he co-starred with
Gregory Hines as an old-time hoofer.

   Jim Henson, who gave his voice to Kermit the
Frog and his creative spirit to a multitude of Muppets, died
Wednesday of pneumonia at age 53.
   Henson created the Muppets in 1954. They made their debut on a
Washington TV program and appeared regularly on ``The Ed Sullivan
Show.'' But their popularity exploded after they began appearing on
``Sesame Street'' in 1969.
   Millions of children in 80 countries grew up watching Kermit,
Cookie Monster, Oscar the Grouch, Big Bird, Bert and Ernie
cavorting on the show, which teaches basic English and math to
preschoolers.
   Later, Henson's ``The Muppet Show'' won three Emmys during its
five-year run and became the most widely seen TV program in the
world.
   Henson's puppets moved to the big screen in 1979 with ``The
Muppet Movie,'' followed by ``The Great Muppet Caper'' and ``The
Muppets Take Manhattan.''
   He also won another Emmy for ``The Jim Henson Hour,'' a special
on NBC.
   Henson also won a Peabody for excellence in TV programming and a
Grammy for a Muppet album. His Saturday morning cartoon, ``The
Muppet Babies,'' won four consecutive Emmys for outstanding
animated program.

   A Purdue University professor says
it ain't easy being Kermit. But when you're the namesake of a
famous frog, life isn't all bad.
   Kermit Scott was the grade-school friend of Muppets creator Jim
Henson, who died Wednesday in New York of complications from
bacterial pneumonia at age 53.
   Scott had not heard from his friend since he was 14. That's when
the Henson family left Leland, Miss., where the two grew up
together. But Scott learned from a newspaper article years ago that
the most famous of the Muppets was named for him.
   ``I guess I made an impression on him,'' said Scott.
   ``We had gone our ways, and I have very fond memories of our
time toegether,'' Scott said Wednesday.
   Named Theodore Kermit Scott Jr., he grew up being called Kermit
because his father used the name Theodore.
   ``It was a bit of a burden. No one else was ever named that,''
he said, but added, ``Now it's a name everybody knows.''
   Scott, a philosophy professor, says he often uses Muppets in his
lectures.
   The Kermit character, he said, has ``that kind of ability to
remain open to all of the possibilities, while at the same time
dealing with all the hassles.''
   He said he always has been flattered Henson used his name for
the puppet known for singing, ``It ain't easy being green.''
   ``I certainly felt there are a lot worse things my name could be
associated with. I'm very happy and proud of what he
accomplished,'' Scott said.

The Saddest Muppet Show: Fozzie Bear, Gonzo and Oscar the Grouch went to St. 
Paul's Cathedral in London on Monday for a memorial service for Muppet creator 
Jim Henson, who died in May in New York. But Kermit the Frog, whose voice was 
that of the puppet master, was not there. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Big Bird, Henson's 7-foot-tall creation from "Sesame Street," walked 
past the choir in the 17th-Century cathedral and sang Kermit's theme song, 
"Bein' Green." He was followed by a recording of Henson singing Kermit's 
"Rainbow Connection." 
</P>
<P>
Well-wishers were asked not to wear black to the service. Henson's family said 
the event would be as much a celebration and thanksgiving for the puppeteer's 
life as a traditional memorial service. A death-bed message from Henson, read 
by his son Brian, urged people to be good to each other and enjoy life: "It 
feels strange writing this while I am alive, but it sure would be hard after I 
go." GREG BRAXTON

JIM HENSON IS GONE BUT SOME OF HIS PUPPETS LIVE ON WITH 'MOTHER GOOSE'

Before Muppet master Jim Henson died on May 16, he saw footage of "Jim Henson's 
Mother Goose Stories," which premieres Saturday at 8:30 a.m. on the Disney 
Channel. The 13-part series, produced by Henson's production company, marks the 
directorial debut of Henson's 26-year-old son, Brian. 
</P>
<P>
"He got to see most of them," Henson said softly. "He loved them. They're real 
sweet. I think they are wonderful for the preschool audience for whom they are 
for." 
</P>
<P>
Growing up in a household populated by Kermit and the other Muppets, Henson 
said, "I thought puppetry was a much bigger thing that everybody knew about." 
His father's forte was glove puppets but Brian Henson was drawn to marionettes. 
"I loved the work of Bill Baird's Marionettes," he said. "We used to go to see 
his shows in New York City." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Henson was only peripherally involved with "Jim Henson's Mother Goose 
Stories," even though it bares his name (the series features Jim Henson 
Productions' puppets). 
</P>
<P>
The series is based on "Mother Goose in Prose," written by "The Wizard of Oz" 
creator L. Frank Baum. It's a fanciful look at the stories behind the beloved 
rhymes, with Mother Goose introducing the tales to her three goslings. The 
puppets, which interact with human performers, are designed after Maxfield 
Parrish's illustrations in the Baum book. 
</P>
<P>
The half-hour episodes consist of three stories featuring such characters as 
Peter Pumpkin Eater, Queen of Hearts, Miss Muffet, Humpty Dumpty and Bo Peep. 
Miss Muffet, for example, is a city girl who wants to go to the country, so she 
runs away. "While out in the country," Henson said, "she meets a farmer and he 
gives her curds and whey. She ends up on the tuffet and then the spider comes 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Each story was produced in one day. "We were shooting quite quickly," Henson 
said. "We were trying to get through three sets for every show. The show is a 
mixture of illustrations and real sets." 
</P>
<P>
Henson first began working with his father on the film "The Great Muppet 
Caper." His marionette expertise is on view in the scene where Kermit and Miss 
Piggy bike around a London park.

"That was quite a complicated marionette effect," he said. "It was a marionette 
from a crane. We had a rig hanging from a crane and the crane was rolling along 
the road." 
</P>
<P>
A few years later, Henson did the marionette work in "The Muppets Take 
Manhattan" in the scene where rats cook food in a diner. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I started being the puppeteer who worked out complicated effects, which 
brought me to more complicated characters," Henson said. 
</P>
<P>
He performed the puppetry for the role of Jack Pumpkinhead in "The Return to 
Oz" and for the reindeer Donner in "Santa Claus: The Movie." 
</P>
<P>
Henson was one of 30 people who animated the plant Audrey II in "The Little 
Shop of Horrors." Four four months, he and his fellow puppeteers rehearsed 
every scene in the musical. 
</P>
<P>
"We would work on a scene for three weeks," he said. "When you have all of 
those people and a really dexterous puppet like Audrey, it's great fun. The 
character can do so much." 
</P>
<P>
In charge of the performance department at the Henson Creature Shop in London, 
Henson has worked with designers to create puppets that require fewer 
puppeteers. "Now we use a lot of computers with a control device so a puppeteer 
can control a lot more," he said. The dog in Jim Henson's short-lived NBC 
series "The Storyteller" was the prototype. "The dog is a hand puppet, but on 
my left hand is a complicated hand control," said Henson. 
</P>
<P>
Before "Mother Goose," Henson had done second-unit directing on several 
projects including "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles." "It takes a lot of 
preproduction (directing) puppets," he said. "You have to work out the blocking 
and where the characters are going to be. The idea is to imagine the best 
action you would want, how you would want it to play, and then you design the 
sets." 
</P>
<P>
Henson has put his puppet and directing duties on the back burner since his 
father's death. "I have been very involved in the company a long time," he said 
somberly. "I am taking on an executive position; my job has changed. But it's 
too difficult to define it right now."

   The family of the late Muppet
master Jim Henson expects to expand the use of his characters in
Walt Disney Co. theme parks and films.
   ``I'm sure this is just a beginning,'' Henson's widow Jane said
Friday at the opening of a new live-character Muppets musical show
at the Disney-MGM Studios theme park.
   ``We all want so much for the characters to live and live and
live,'' she added. ``And this is the right place to do it.''
   Henson and the company were negotiating an agreement to broaden
use of the Muppets by Disney when he died, Disney chairman Michael
Eisner said at a news conference Friday.
   Henson's oldest son, Brian, said his father ``really felt that
this is the ideal place for his work to end up. ... We just hope
that our association flourishes.''
   ``None of us have any reason to believe we won't proceed as
planned,'' Eisner told reporters.
   Henson died May 16 after a bout with pneumonia. He was 53.

<LEADPARA>  Walt Disney Co., responding to accusations it illegally used Muppet
characters, has filed a counterclaim against Henson Associates seeking
unspecified damages. Disney's counterclaim, filed Monday in federal court in
Manhattan, denies allegations made in a lawsuit by Henson and accuses the
plaintiff of being less interested in protecting Jim Henson's legacy than in
making money. The Muppet inventor and company founder died last May of
pneumonia. The Henson lawsuit filed last week seeks to block the entertainment
giant's allegedly unauthorized use of Muppet characters in its television
commercials, movies, T-shirts and other Disney products. Disney has agreed not
to open a Disney World film featuring the famous characters until after the
trial, scheduled to begin May 13. "Kermit the Frog Presents: Muppet Vision
3-D" will not debut until May 24 the earliest, Disney said.  </LEADPARA>

Abraham Lincoln has apparently been emancipated from a future on a storage 
shelf by tourists at Disneyland who rebelled over the prospect of Kermit the 
Frog replacing him at a park exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
Park officials have shelved their plans to close the 25-year-old "Great Moments 
With Mr. Lincoln" show on Disneyland's Main Street this weekend, they said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland operators said visitors and park employees alike reacted angrily to 
reports that the robot replica of the nation's 16th President was being removed 
to make room for a new Muppets attraction. 
</P>
<P>
"Put the Muppets in there? No! No!" said Leona Banks of Kankakee, Ill., 
standing outside the Main Street opera hall where a mechanical Lincoln robot 
rises from an antique chair to deliver a five-minute speech 51 times a day. 
</P>
<P>
"This exhibit carries a message to the people of the United States. It's 
something very emotional -- and I'm not just saying this because I'm from the 
'Land of Lincoln,' " she added. 
</P>
<P>
Grumbled 12-year-old Abby Hangsleben of East Grand Forks, Minn.: "Lincoln was 
President. Kermit is a frog." 
</P>
<P>
Disney purchased rights to several of the Muppets characters last year. The 
company disclosed in January that it would begin staging parades and live shows 
in 1991 featuring the puppets developed by the late Jim Henson. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Dick Tracy-themed attractions and new Hollywood-oriented shows 
scheduled to open through 1999, the Muppets are part of an expansion program 
that park officials have dubbed "The Disney Decade." 
</P>
<P>
Reports have circulated for the last three months among Disneyland's 8,000 
employees that the Main Street opera hall, which also houses exhibits honoring 
park founder Walt Disney, would be turned over to Kermit, Miss Piggy and Big 
Bird. 
</P>
<P>
Officials announced a week ago that the Lincoln exhibit would be closed Sunday 
for "refurbishing" the opera house. They said plans for the plush-seated 
auditorium near the park's entrance would be disclosed later. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, park operators said Lincoln will live -- at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland spokesman Paul Goldman said that park planners are looking at 
several other sites for the Muppets, including an area near the "It's a Small 
World" attraction. "It's a matter of shoehorning things in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman said officials were surprised by the outcry over Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
"If you'd asked a few days ago, I'd have said that being a 25-year-old 
attraction, its popularity has passed. But there seems to be a lot of sentiment 
for Lincoln." 
</P>
<P>
Although Disney officials refuse to disclose attendance figures, they 
acknowledge that park visitors haven't shown a lot of interest in the Lincoln 
show. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, only a handful of park visitors filed into the 500-seat theater 
to watch the 13-minute production. The show starts with photographic slides and 
ends with a full-sized replica of Lincoln standing at the U.S. Capitol and 
gesturing as it speaks of liberty and patriotism. 
</P>
<P>
The electronically animated figure blinks its eyes, wiggles its fingers and 
nods and turns. The robot was rewired about five years ago to add sophisticated 
new movements as part of a $200,000 renovation, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln's short speech actually consists of excerpts from five addresses 
delivered by the Great Emancipator between 1838 and 1864. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly hope they aren't going to do away with this," said tourist John 
Folliard of Oregon City, Ore. "The rides are nice, but I'm real patriotic." 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim teacher Nola Vroom escorted 60 children from a summer church camp to 
"Great Moments With Mr. Lincoln" after hearing that the display was slated for 
closure this weekend. She said she wanted to make sure they had a chance to see 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"I like Kermit because I'm a first-grade teacher. But I like Lincoln, too," she 
said, glancing around the nearly deserted entrance to the theater. "If more 
people knew this was going to close, they'd be lined up to get in." 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland employee Sandy Spurgeon, who has seen the Lincoln show "thousands of 
times" during the 10 years she has worked as a show hostess, said the Muppets 
should go somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they fit in on Main Street," Spurgeon said. "I've had people 
come here in tears about this." 
</P>
<P>
Across the park, Monorail ride operator Julio Escobedo agreed that the 
Disneyland entrance should keep its nostalgic, turn-of-the-century Americana 
look. "Take out the submarine ride and put the Muppets there," he said.

   Kermit the Frog, the fuzzy green alter ego of
the late muppeteer Jim Henson, will live on with someone new
supplying his voice.
   Kermit will be among the characters appearing in ``The Muppets
Celebrate Jim Henson'' on CBS Nov. 21.
   The amiable amphibian has been a mainstay of the Muppets for 35
years. Henson, who directed his motions and supplied his voice,
died of pneumonia in May.
   ``When Jim was alive, he said if anything happened to him,
Kermit must go on right away,'' Henson's widow, Jane, told TV
Guide, the magazine reports in its Nov. 17 issue. ``Because of
Kermit's significant place, Jim had essentially chosen who he
thought could do it. But we don't want to say who it is before the
show.
   ``The performer needs time. Kermit won't come back so strong at
first. Then little by little, he will get his whole personality
back.''
   Young viewers ensured Kermit's return.
   ``We found the kids really wanted to keep Kermit going,'' said
Henson's daughter, Cheryl. ``It was a touchy thing. They were sorry
Jim had died and wanted to know if the Muppets could die.
   ``We thought that the Muppets were characters, not people, and
that it was much better to say that they don't die.''

THE LEGAL squabbling between Walt Disney and the makers of the Muppets ended
yesterday when both sides 'amicably resolved' their differences and reached
an out-of-court settlement which will allow Disney to exhibit two Muppet
attractions at its Orlando, Florida theme park.
The altercation started nearly two weeks ago when Henson Associates, a
family-run company founded by the late Jim Henson, filed a suit accusing
Disney of violating copyrights and trademarks of the Muppets.
A Disney spokesman expressed deep regret for what was described as a serious
misunderstanding, and apologised to the Henson family and their company for
any harm that may have been caused.
Mr Brian Henson, son of the late Jim Henson and president of Henson
Associates, said that they had granted Walt Disney a licence for the Walt
Disney World resort in Florida.
The licence is for an initial term of 18 months, and contains an option for
an extension by another 3 1/2 years. Disney will have exclusive rights to
the attractions and to the Muppets appearing in them.

   Abe Lincoln, the robot, beat Kermit the
frog in a quiet civil war at Disneyland.
   Disneyland will keep the ``Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln''
show, which park officials had planned to close this weekend. No
longer would the nation's 16th president rise from his chair, 51
times a day, to deliver excerpts from his speeches.
   Park operators reportedly planned to replace the show with a new
Muppets attraction.
   But tourists and park employees were irked by the idea and
Disneyland officials apparently backed off from their plans _ for
now.
   ``If you'd asked a few days ago, I'd have said that being a
25-year-old attraction, its popularity has passed,'' said park
spokesman Paul Goldman. ``But there seems to be a lot of sentiment
for Lincoln.''
   For one park visitor, 12-year-old Abby Hangsleben of East Grand
Forks, Minn., Kermit just can't compare to Honest Abe.
   ``Lincoln was president. Kermit is a frog,'' she said.
   Disney officials refuse to disclose attendance figures but
acknowledge that park visitors recently haven't shown a lot of
interest in the Lincoln show.
   Reports had circulated for months among Disneyland's 8,000
employees that the Main Street opera hall, which houses the Lincoln
show and exhibits honoring park founder Walt Disney, would be
turned over to Kermit, Miss Piggy and Big Bird.
   Last week, officials said the Lincoln exhibit would be closed on
Sunday for the ``refurbishing'' of the opera house.
   But Goldman said Thursday park planners were looking at several
other sites for the Muppets, including an area near the ``It's a
Small World'' attraction.
   ``It's a matter of shoe-horning things in,'' he said.
   Disney purchased rights to several of the Muppets characters
last year and plans to use Kermit, Miss Piggy, Big Bird and the
gang in shows and parades at the park.

   BURBANK, Calif. -- It isn't exactly Sonny and Cher getting
back together, but in an entertainment industry
reconciliation almost as hard to believe, Walt Disney Co. and
Jim Henson Productions Inc. are expected to announce a major
home-video alliance today, individuals close to the companies
say.
   Under the agreement, Disney's powerful home-video division
will distribute Henson videocassettes for five to six years,
which could translate into tens of millions of dollars in
revenue. Neither company would comment on the transaction,
but Disney has scheduled a news conference for today.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At first glance, the reunion seems bizarre, because the
breakup of Disney's planned purchase of Henson last year was
so ugly and so public. An angry exchange of lawsuits and
press interviews saw each side accusing the other of greed
and bad faith, and the episode quickly turned into a
public-relations fiasco for both companies.
   Though some joint projects between the two companies
continued -- such as the TV show "Dinosaurs" and a Muppets
3-D film at Walt Disney World -- many industry executives and
analysts believed it would be impossible for the two to
overcome their acrimony.
   But individuals close to the companies said Los
Angeles-based Henson was upset with some of Disney's
corporate executives, not with its operational people in
theme parks, television and home video. "The marriage between
Henson and Disney made a lot of sense in the first place,"
says one executive familiar with the situation. "That
fundamental fact didn't change when things broke apart."
   Home video was a big reason the two companies wanted to
get together initially. As a somewhat sleepy family company
built by the gifted puppeteer who founded it, Henson
Productions first began seeking a Hollywood home-video deal
in 1989, and had been close to signing up with Paramount
Communications Inc. Henson's film and television programming
library, with well-loved, recognizable characters such as the
Muppets, was underexploited, while the market for
videocassettes geared to children was exploding.
   Then, Jim Henson and Disney Chairman Michael Eisner hit it
off personally, and talks began about an outright acquisition
by Disney. Disney agreed to buy the company in 1989 for about
$150 million. But final negotiations dragged on for months,
and Mr. Henson died unexpectedly, with ownership of his
company reverting to his five children.
   Talks began to deteriorate, then broke off over tax and
compensation issues. In April, Henson Productions filed a
lawsuit against Disney, charging it with copyright and
trademark infringement and fraud. Disney countersued, but the
sides settled soon after. The agreement gave Disney only
limited theme-park use of the Henson characters, keeping the
valuable franchise unencumbered in case Henson seeks another
buyer.
   The video agreement preserves the same independence. When
the pact expires, all rights will revert to Henson. At
Henson's request, the videocassettes will be released with a
Jim Henson logo; the cassette packaging won't bear the Disney
name, mentioning only Disney's Buena Vista distribution unit
in small letters, according to people with knowledge of the
agreement.
   Disney took a similar low-profile approach in its recent
successful release of old "Rocky and Bullwinkle" television
episodes from the Jay Ward Productions library, using its
marketing prowess to score an unexpectedly large home-video
hit.
   Disney also is expected to bankroll as many as three new
Henson productions a year for direct video release, as well
as distribute "Fraggle Rock," "The Storyteller," "Muppet
Babies," "The Muppet Show," "Mother Goose" and other Henson
productions.
   Though Disney isn't the largest video distributor, it is
the leader in videos for children and in the often-related
business of selling videos directly to consumers rather than
to video stores for the rental market.
   "Disney is perfect for Henson," says a person who knows
both companies. "This shows the way things might have been."

<LEADPARA>  EARL Sinclair, the leading character in ABC's newest sitcom, couldn't be in a
better mood. Today is "Hurling Day," the day he legally can throw his
mother-in-law off a cliff to her death.;    Wait a minute! How low can a

Children." Can this be the disgusting new direction for TV comedy in the 1990s?  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  PRIME-TIME PREHISTORY
'DINOSAURS' IS A HARD-EDGED SITCOM FOR ADULTS
-- AND THE REALIZATION OF JIM HENSON'S LAST
DREAM  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  (box) 'Dinosaurs' reviewed, Page 4G  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Maybe so. But it's not quite what it seems. You see, Earl and his
mother-in-law aren't humans. They're dinosaurs. And everybody knows it's
traditional in dinosaur families to toss the old folks off a cliff into a tar
pit as soon as they reach age 72. It makes sense, too. Those old dinosaurs
slow down the pack and attract predators. So don't judge them by our
standards.;    Earl and his family are the principal characters of ABC's
"Dinosaurs," which premieres Friday night at 8:30 (Chs. 7, 11, 13) after the
greatest network ballyhoo campaign since "Batman" made its debut in 1966.;   
In a word, it's radical. Stranger yet, it originally sprang from the fertile
mind of the late Jim Henson, the gentle creator of Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy
and all the other Muppets.;    Just before he died last May, Henson had begun
to flesh out details of a wacky concept he'd been carrying around in his head
for several years: a live-action TV situation comedy starring a family of
dinosaurs whose wasteful, contemporary lifestyle obviously was going to lead
to their eventual extinction as a species.;    It was a daring idea for
Henson, whose career had been built upon wholesome, genial programs for
children. This one would be hard-edged and hip, primarily aimed at adults.;   
And because the dinosaurs would be "played" by life-size, "animatronic"
puppets, it would be awesomely expensive.;    At first, Henson's death from
pneumonia at age 53 seemed to doom this boldest of ideas. Yet, despite heavy
odds, Henson's last great dream has survived to fool the doomsayers, rising up
out of the primordial ooze of failed partnerships, lawsuits, creative
roadblocks and budget overruns.;    "We've been very faithful to his original
idea," said Brian Henson, 27-year-old heir to the Henson legacy, in a
telephone interview this week from the "Dinosaurs" set. "We've all felt
pressure because we wanted to do a project Jim would be proud of if he were
with us today.";    It hasn't been easy. Still grieving over his father's
death, young Henson suddenly found himself in the middle of a chaotic
situation last summer.;    First, the nearly complete multimillion-dollar
merger of Jim Henson Productions with the Walt Disney Co. suddenly fell apart.
Yet the two companies still had a commitment from ABC for "Dinosaurs," a
co-production that Disney would finance.;    But there was skepticism that
young Henson would be able to supply the creative leadership for his father's
company and fulfill its commitments. Amid hard feelings over the failed
merger, legal squabbling began over Disney's use of Henson characters at
Disney theme parks. Tension heightened.;    But Jim Henson's colleagues
rallied around Brian, who had worked with them since he was 17, learning his
dad's business from the ground up. He was elected company president and vowed
to go on with "Dinosaurs.";    "It was a scary task at first," said Henson. "I
was pretty fresh to the business end of it. But we all sat down together and
figured out what to do." Though the Henson Co. finally filed suit against
Disney earlier this month, Henson and his creative partners on "Dinosaurs,"
including Disney's own hand-picked executives, have proceeded without rancor,
even when costs on the first episode alone soared to a rumored $5 million.;   
At stake is a show almost everyone involved believes will be an enormous
runaway hit, maybe even bigger than "The Simpsons" -- with the promise of tens
of millions of dollars in merchandising and other ancillary profits to come.; 
  A couple of young pros;    Most observers believe "Dinosaurs" survived all
the initial roadblocks because of the strict professionalism of young Henson,
who is executive producer, and Michael Jacobs, his chief creative partner and
co-executive producer, whom Disney put in place.;    "Brian is about the most
gentle soul I've ever met," said Jacobs in his office at CBS/MTM studios,
where "Dinosaurs" occupies an entire soundstage. "That's infuriating, because
I'm a more obnoxious type. I can't seem to make him lose his temper, though
God knows I'm trying.";    Henson holds Jacobs in equally high regard. Jacobs,
the still-youthful producer of such network shows as "My Two Dads" and
"Charles in Charge," runs the "idea team," while Henson heads the group that
has to turn those ideas into filmable reality. Their worlds occasionally
collide, but Henson says the input they get from each other is what makes it
"such a unique, fun project.";    Once the decision was firm to go on, both
men sat down with their lieutenants and producer Kirk Thatcher, who had
sketched out some of Jim Henson's original ideas about a month before Henson's
death. Jacobs developed Henson's ideas into the fully realized "Dinosaurs"
concept; Thatcher put them on paper; and Brian Henson's team built them in
their London "creature lab.";    Jacobs' notion was to rewrite prehistory by
adding a new geologic era to the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. In this
brief era, Jacobs reasoned, the dinosaurs developed domestic family life,
started tearing down forests to build condos and generally despoiled their
environment like Boobus Americanus, circa 1991.;    "This period also
coincided with the arrival of the caveman," Jacobs explained. "We're probably
only inaccurate by 150 million or so years.";    That little twist on dinosaur
lore is fully in keeping with Jim Henson's original premise, which suggested
dinosaurs made themselves extinct by behaving too much like humans do today.; 
  "It's a very subtle, underlying message," said Brian, "but it makes such a
wonderful parallel to our own lifestyle.";    Jacobs, who still rises early
each day to watch Henson's Muppets on "Sesame Street" with his two youngsters,
has run rampant with the concept, delighting in the chance to see our world
through the eyes of another species.;    In one episode, for instance, the
show will make fun of the teen "coming of age" formula by having 12-year-old
Charlene Sinclair fretting over the fact her tail isn't developing like those
of the other girls in class.;    "Naturally, she feels inadequate because the
males all gravitate to the girls with bigger, rounder tails," said Jacobs.;   
They'll also have fun with "species" prejudice among dinosaurs. Earl and his
family are carnivorous; so they don't get along so well with the herbivores.
If "Dinosaurs" gets picked up for next season, Jacobs is toying with having a
brontosaur family move in next door.;    "It'll be sort of like the Jeffersons
moving in next to Archie Bunker," he said.;    While such ideas flowed, Henson
and his experts were battling budgets and racing the clock to make them
happen. Each character is 7 to 9 feet tall and must be meticulously engineered
to look lifelike while being operated off camera by various mechanical and
electronic means.;    "What's important is to keep coming up with something
new and innovative that looks like nothing you've seen before," said Henson.; 
  A film veteran;  The 27-year-old is experienced well beyond his years. He
supervised the team that operated Audrey, the carnivorous plant in "Little
Shop of Horrors," and was both chief puppeteer and second unit director on
last year's movie megahit "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.";    Still, he
realizes he's now the chief standard-bearer of a monumental legacy and will be
severely judged, fairly or not, for the quality of "Dinosaurs." He concedes he
has placed himself under a great deal of emotional pressure on that score.;   
"Protecting my father's legacy is of the utmost importance to me now," he
said.;    ABC is giving "Dinosaurs" 13 episodes to become a hit and earn a
spot on the fall lineup. With such overwhelming expense involved, nobody
expects ABC to be satisfied with piddling ratings success.;    "We're either
going to hit it out of the park or swing so hard that we wind up face-first in
the dirt," said Jacobs. "Sometimes I sit down on the set, hold my head in my
hands and ask what I've gotten myself into." With its high cliffs and tar pits
handy, the "Dinosaurs" set might even be the ideal place for a TV producer to
read the weekly ratings reports and contemplate his future.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   In the beginning there was Joan Ganz Cooney and
a secretary. Then came Big Bird, Bert and Ernie, the Cookie Monster
and more. They still ask if you can tell them, please, how to get
to ``Sesame Street.''
   Millions of kids _ many of whom now are adults _ know the way
well. The series starts its 21st year today on public TV, having
grown to a staff of 92, including 10 actors and 13 Muppet players.
   For some time now, its audience has been more than American. Its
English-language version is seen in more than 80 countries, and it
has 15 international co-productions, its makers say.
   But it's still aimed at kids aged 1 through 5, particularly
those of poor, inner-city families. And the goal of the one-hour
series is the same now as in 1969: To teach as well as entertain.
   Now costing $12 million annually to make, 80 per cent of that
from commercial licensing of its characters and 20 per cent from
PBS stations, according to its makers, it began with definite
marching orders.
   ``I said, `Let's do a kind of ``Laugh-In'' for kids,' '' recalls
Cooney, the founder and since 1988 chairwoman of the Children's
Television Workshop, maker of ``Sesame Street'' and subsequent
teach-the-tykes shows.
   Her walk to ``Sesame Street'' began when she was a TV consultant
for the Carnegie Corporation, a foundation she joined after writing
a study called ``The Potential Uses of Television in Preschool
Education.''
   When she left to start the show, she told its producers it
should have animation, puppets, a studio, ``and let's not have a
single host. Let's have at least four hosts who will be men, women,
black, white, Hispanic, and so on.''
   Having decreed a pre-Jesse Jackson Rainbow Coalition, she also
wanted each show periodically ``interrupted by `non-commercials' to
teach letters and numbers,'' the basic-education snippets that
still air on the show.
   And the installation of Jim Henson's Muppets, ``was a very
critical decision'' in the show's success, says Cooney, a former
reporter from Phoenix, Ariz., who also has been an NBC publicist
and public TV documentary maker.
   (Interestingly, Henson's Kermit the Frog, never was a regular.
He only was a guest visitor, a CTW spokeswoman says, and he still
hops in now and then.)
   There have been some additions and changes, the biggest of the
latter the expanded range of what Cooney calls ``curriculum aims.''
   Among other things, today's ``Street'' watchers get a taste of
math and science.
   And, Cooney says, they also see teen-agers, a student from
Japan, and people with various disabilities, from Down's syndrome
to hearing and vision problems. There also are segments on emotions.
   ``We've dealt with death, with love and marriage, with pregnancy
and childbirth, with adoption, with anger,'' she says. ``We also
have a goal of teaching children to cooperate ... we consciously
model the acceptance of all people, of treating people kindly.''
   Like Oscar the Grouch, Cooney can get a tad testy, but mainly at
those who say the fast pace of ``Sesame Street'' has led to the MTV
Generation of short attention spans. A bum rap, she submits.
   ``Street'' has longer pieces now, she says, with virtually every
show given a ``plotted story line all the way through'' that is
interrupted only for the educational ``non-commercials.''
   ``We didn't make MTV possible,'' she says. She thought she had
made it clear in many speeches, she adds, that ``we followed
`Laugh-In.' We followed the revolution of TV. We did not create the
revolution in television.''
   A recent development _ the Cable Monster _ and such
child-getting cable channels as Nickelodeon and its ``Bugs Bunny''
and ``Road Runner'' reruns have had an impact on the ``Street''
audience, but only in the afternoon, she says.
   ``Our `Sesame Street' morning audience is not affected, and
that's always been our biggest audience,'' she says. Not so in the
afternoon, when the pre-schoolers' older brothers and sisters come
home from school.
   They tend to take over the set. With cable added to their
viewing choices, the competition is strong, not only against
``Street'' but also CTW's older-kids math show, ``Square One TV''
and its science show, ``3-2-1 Contact.''
   As it starts this season,``Street'' will portray more
teen-agers, and have two new topics _ the environment and
geography. The latter, she says, is because ``we know our children
are not learning geography.''
   The former, already a semiregular story on network newscasts, is
joining the ``Street,'' Cooney says, because ``we feel that for
their survival, the children had better learn about the
environment.''

   Elsewhere in television...
   THE FUTURE BE WITH YOU _ NBC's ``Today'' last week began a new
Friday segment called ``Countdown to the '90s.'' Today, both the
``CBS Morning News'' and ABC's ``Good Morning America'' join the
futures movement.
   CBS' show offers a week's worth called ``The 90s: Into the
Future.'' ABC's show has ``Ninetysomething: The Next 10 Years,''
but only will go futuring through Wednesday.

their owner's blessing this summer under an agreement between the producers of
some of the world's most recognized animated characters. The amicable
settlement ends a dispute between Muppet owner Henson Associates Inc. and Walt

KID BEAT: 'BIG BIRD': LESS SHOW, MORE BIZ

"Big Bird's Sesame Street Story" looks like a little bit of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
A ramp, bordered by glittering lights, juts into the floor of the arenas where 
the touring extravaganza is staged (at the Sports Arena through Sunday, then on 
to Long Beach and Anaheim Convention Centers). The proscenium of the stage 
proper is ablaze with light. Before the acts begin, colored lights swoop around 
the hall, heralding the arrival of the Sesame Street denizens. 
</P>
<P>
It's exciting, as Las Vegas is, but it's awfully grandiose for these unassuming 
characters. And the story line is even more narcissistic: a look at how "Sesame 
Street" got to be a TV show. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't a factual story; no one mentions Muppets creator Jim Henson. But its 
explanation of how everyone had to be convinced that kids would want to learn 
something from TV, as well as be entertained, is ridiculously self-promotional. 
Have writers Jon Stone and Joseph A. Bailey run out of story ideas that would 
more directly relate to the real concerns of preschoolers? 
</P>
<P>
Many of the kids pay no attention to the story. But they do respond with shouts 
and stares to the sight of life-sized Muppets (notably excepting Kermit the 
Frog, who is nowhere to be seen) dancing, skating, singing, even bathing. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, there are so many souvenirs to buy and play with. The most 
distracting of these are annoying $4 flashlights. A couple of children near me 
waved these at each other throughout the second act, oblivious to the show. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Sports Arena today at noon and 3:30 p.m., Sunday at 1:30 and 5 p.m. At 
Long Beach Convention Center Wednesday through May 28. At Anaheim Convention 
Center May 31-June 4. Tickets: $8-$10.50; (213) 480-3232 or (714) 740-2000.
