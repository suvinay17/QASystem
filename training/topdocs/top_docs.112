   A judge Tuesday ordered Penthouse magazine and
its publisher Robert Guccione to pay $4.06 million to a former Pet
of the Year who charged that he used her as a virtual sex slave.
   State Judge Elliott Wilk ruled that Guccione made sexual demands
on Marjorie Thoreson as a condition of employment at Penthouse,
where she worked from 1973 to 1980.
   ``Sexual slavery was not part of her job description,'' Wilk
said.
   Guccione's ``cold and calculating ... use of sexual coercion
forced her to safeguard her employment by sacrificing her body,''
which is a violation of state law, Wilk said.
   Thoreson, now 37, sued Guccione for $10 million, alleging breach
of contract, sexual harassment and fraud.
   She testified during the March 1989 trial that Guccione forced
her to perform hard-core sex acts in a pornographic movie and used
her sexual favors as partial payment to furnish a hotel-casino he
owned in Atlantic City.
   She said Guccione also ordered her to carry on a sex affair with
his financial adviser so he would move from England to the United
States. She said she severed the relationship because it appeared
the adviser was going to leave his wife and four children.
   Her attorney, Murray Schwartz, said the ruling is ``for all the
women like her who may have suffered at the hands of Guccione. He
has finally been held accountable.''
   Penthouse lawyer Jeffrey Daichman labeled Thoreson a liar and
said an appeal was expected. The ruling ``read more like a
political manifesto about the women's movement than an objective
analysis of the evidence,'' he said.
   Guccione said in a statement that Penthouse presented evidence
to the judge showing that Thoreson ``was a former prostitute,
drug-abuser and three-time felon who had violated her probation.''
   He said Thoresen allegedly began an affair with the financial
adviser ``at a time when she was not even employed by Penthouse.''
   At the trial, Guccione testified that Thoreson was a potential
Marilyn Monroe whom he had rescued from a life of crime.
   The judge, who heard the case with no jury, said Guccione's only
evidence to contradict Thoreson was his word, and added, ``I do not
believe him.''
   Wilk awarded Thoreson $4 million in punitive damages and $60,000
in compensatory damages. The amounts were based on Guccione's $150
million personal worth and Penthouse's market value of about $200
million, he said.
   Thoreson, a native of St. Paul, Minn., was working as a topless
dancer and a cocktail waitress in California in 1973 when she sent
Guccione nude photos and asked if he could help her become an
actress.
   Guccione began by signing her to a personal management contract
and changing her name to Anika di Lorenzo. He made her Penthouse
Pet of the Year in 1975 and invited her to move into his New York
townhouse, which she did.
   In 1976, Guccione cast her in his sexually explicit movie
``Caligula,'' which Thoreson now says was a pornographic film that
ruined her career. For her role, Guccione paid for surgery to have
her breasts enlarged.
   Guccione testified during the trial that he cast her in Caligula
because she was sexually ``and perfect for the part.''
   ``I thought it was a leg-up on prostitution in Las Vegas,
stealing cars, writing bum checks, and building up a life of
crime,'' he said, referring to her checkered past.
   Thoreson sued Guccione after he fired her in 1980 because she
refused to accompany him on a trip to the Far East. She said she
feared he would pass her around to the businessmen he was meeting.

   Bob Guccione and Penthouse magazine have been
ordered to pay more than $4 million to a former Pet of the Year who
said she was forced to perform hard-core sex acts and sleep with
two Guccione associates.
   ``Sexual slavery was not part of her job description,'' Supreme
Court Justice Elliott Wilk said in finding that the magazine
publisher made sexual demands on Marjorie Thoreson as a condition
of employment at Penthouse, where she worked from 1973 to 1980.
   His ``cold and calculating ... use of sexual coercion forced her
to safeguard her employment by sacrificing her body,'' the judge
said Tuesday.
   Thoreson, 37, testified during the 1989 trial that Guccione
forced her to perform hard-core sex acts in a pornographic movie
and used her sexual favors as partial payment to furnish a
hotel-casino he owned in Atlantic City.
   She said Guccione also ordered her to carry on an affair with
his financial adviser so he would move from England to the United
States. She said she severed the relationship because it appeared
the adviser was going to leave his wife and children.
   Thoreson's lawyer, Murray Schwartz, said she cried when he
called her in California with the news.
   This decision is ``for all the women like her who may have
suffered at the hands of Guccione,'' Schwartz said. ``He has
finally been held accountable.''
   Penthouse's lawyer, Jeffrey Daichman, called the award an
outrage and said he will appeal.
   He said that Thoreson had a relationship with Guccione before
she was employed by Penthouse. But ``during the time of her
employment, there was no sexual relationship between her and
anybody associated with Penthouse.''
   At the trial, Guccione testified that Thoreson was a potential
Marilyn Monroe whom he had rescued from a life of crime.
   Guccione's only evidence to contradict Thoreson was his word,
Wilk noted. The judge, who heard the case with no jury, added, ``I
do not believe him.''
   Wilk awarded Thoreson $60,000 in compensatory damages and $4
million in punitive damages. The judge said the amounts were based
on Guccione's $150 million personal worth and Penthouse's market
value of about $200 million.
   Thoreson, originally from St. Paul, Minn., approached Guccione
in 1973 at age 20. She sent him nude photos of herself and a
letter.
   At the time, she was living in California, where she was working
as a cocktail waitress and topless dancer, did some modeling and
took acting lessons. She also had several minor brushes with the
law, the judge said.
   Guccione said in a statement Tuesday that Penthouse presented
evidence that Thoreson was a former prostitute, drug abuser and
``three-time felon who had violated her probation.''
   Thoreson said she told Guccione she wanted to be an actress. He
signed her to a personal management contract, changed her name to
Anika di Lorenzo, made her Penthouse Pet of the Year in 1975 and
took her into his New York townhouse.
   In 1976, Guccione cast Thoreson in ``Caligula,'' a movie based
loosely on the life of the mad Roman emperor. The film features
bloody tortures, nudity and hard-core sex.
   At Guccione's urging, Thoreson said, she had her breasts
enlarged for the role. In the movie, shown at the trial, Thoreson
engages in sex acts with a man and a woman.
   Thoreson sued Guccione for fraud and sexual harassment after he
fired her in 1980 because she refused to accompany him on a trip to
the Far East. She said she feared he would pass her around to the
businessmen he was meeting.

   A 36-year-old woman who claims Penthouse
publisher Bob Guccione ruined her acting career by putting her in a
pornographic film is asking a court to award her $10 million in
damages.
   The former model, Anneka DiLorenzo, says Guccione reneged on a
verbal contract to help her career.
   But Guccione defended himself in state Supreme Court Thursday by
arguing that Ms. DiLorenzo got the exposure she needed but ruined
her own career by rejecting three movie offers and disappearing with
a boyfriend.
   ``She simply turned her back on us and went off to Florida in a
drunken spree'' in 1978, Guccione said. He testified he urged Ms.
DiLorenzo to sign a management contract with Penthouse in 1973 and
to let him guide her career.
   Ms. DiLorenzo said in court papers that Guccione was a ``sadistic
evil person'' who ruined her career by putting her in ``Caligula,''
a film loosely based on the life of the mad Roman emperor.
   The two-hour, 23-minute movie, which features bloody tortures and
hard-core sex of almost every variety, includes an explicit sex
scene involving Ms. DiLorenzo and another woman.
   The movie was shown to Justice Elliott Wilk, who is hearing the
trial without a jury. ``Does this movie ever end?'' he asked at one
point.
   ``It kind of makes you appreciate Pee Wee Herman, doesn't it?''
Wilk said.
   When the sex scene featuring Ms. DiLorenzo appeared on the
screen, she fled the courtroom in tears and remained in the women's
restroom for more than 30 minutes.
   Ms. DiLorenzo said Guccione fired her in 1980 when she refused to
accompany him to Japan on a promotional tour for the movie. She said
he had promised her that in return for her years of cooperation with
the magazine, she would always be ``part of his Penthouse family.''
   Penthouse's lawyer, Jeffrey Daichman, said Ms. Lorenzo admits she
has no proof that Guccione ever made such a promise.
   In her deposition, Ms. DiLorenzo said: ``I don't have any written
contracts with Guccione. He and I had verbal agreements. We were
partners in life.''

FT  20 MAR 92 / Arts: Caligula - Comedie Francaise, Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Le theatre n'est pas un jeu, c'est la conviction', Camus once said. It has
taken the conservative Comedie Francaise over 50 years to risk Camus' drama
of existentialist conviction, but now amends have been made. The theatre's
first Caligula (to June 24) is a stunning production.
Camus' drama follows the facts of Suetonius' history, but his hero is an
existentialist philosophe housed in the body of a Roman dictator: the mad
logic of nihilism drives this Caligula to tyranny. The play was written in
1938 but war delayed performance until 1945, when it was seized on as a
prophetic wonder which had anticipated Hitler. 'Our century is the century
of fear', wrote Camus, but he always denied the precise political analogy,
and time has proved 'Caligula' a broader statement of the themes of fear,
despair, nihilism.
Youssef Chahine revives it as a vision of contemporary horror: urban
violence, terrorism, mass media as both a creator of dangerous orthodoxies
and a force for banalising our responses to them. Inserts of films and other
non-conventional staging - Chahine is a film-maker - underline the
interpretation. The result is chic, radical and, to foreign eyes at least,
typically Parisian in its mix of philosophy, politics and stylish
aesthetics.
Sandwiched between crumbling classical columns and stone walls, a huge steel
and glass office block rises to the roof of the Comedie Francaise stage.
Sometimes, it reflects a cityscape painted on panels in the wings; sometimes
it is a screen projecting rabble-rousing crowd scenes or Caligula's face,
many times enlarged, as it booms out to the audience while the dictator
stands dwarfed beneath it. A forum at the front also merges old and new:
ruined arches and pillars, flights of stone steps, a yellow moped, flashing
roadwork lights, cordons, signposts.
The ancient/modern mix suggests Rome, but Chahine widens the image to any
city. Drills whirr, workmen in helmets alternate with wailing veiled women
at an Islamic funeral, an old pinstriped banker shuffles round the rubble;
kids lounge on the steps, cameramen from 'Satellite TV' pop up from each
corner. As on television, the exotic cuts into the everyday: Chahine shares
Camus' North African background and recalls it through an Arab bazaar, and
in the drums and tambourines of Mohamed Nouh's specially composed music.
By contrast the Roman patricians are the western, chattering classes: puffed
up in gold togas, they sample grapes, prattle, giggle and massage one
another - a smoke-filled box in the auditorium is converted to a Roman bath
for the evening. This sort of decadence needs a Caligula, suggests Chahine:
Jean-Ives Dubois, lean and long in black tracksuit, swivels round in an
office chair, cool, efficient, deliberate in movement, calm in his
dissection of their false values: 'Les hommes meurent, et ils ne sont pas
heureux'.
The drama is that he loses his sanity as the patrician-puppets, and
especially Cherea (Michel Favory), grow through fear and bereavement into
warm, vulnerable characters. Backed by screen and microphone, Dubois becomes
an automaton of terror, only human - and comic - in his crazy obsession that
his slave will fetch him the moon, symbol of impossible attainment
(according to history, Caligula had a moon fetish.)
Black humour hints at rather than wallows in violence: the menace of
Caligula got up like Botticelli's Venus, emerging from below the stage and
demanding obeisance; corpses wheeled across Caligula's diner party and
ignored; a speeded-up poetry competition where each poet is allowed a few
seconds to speak, and the last one only to part his lips, before black hoods
are thrust over them and they are lead off to execution. Fights are stylised
into acrobatics. Caligula and the poet Scipio (Lilah Dadi, a touching blend
of worldliness and naivety) joust while turning somersaults on a trampoline;
there are jugglers, knife-throwers, a danse macabre of punks and soldiers
slicing into one another.
To reveal the dynamics of the climax would be to play spoilsport; but in a
mix of old-fashioned theatrical chill and clever cinematic tricks Chahine
pulls his themes together and has Caligula, tragic hero in spite of all,
literally reaching for the moon. But every scene is dramatically inventive,
different, and acted and choreographed with consummate skill and apparent
ease. Cumulatively they question everyday assumptions, moral tabs, political
involvement (Favory's Cherea, reluctantly bloodstained, points a dripping
hand at the audience), our own distancing of terror as it is 'stylised' by
repetition on the small screen. This is the most exciting theatre in Paris
since Peter Brook's multi-cultural Tempest here two years ago.

   Actor Don Johnson, recently reunited with
ex-wife, Melanie Griffith, says there are no hard feelings between
his girlfriends past and present _ in fact, they're as close as kin.
   ``We all consider each other family,'' Johnson said in April's
Fame magazine. ``Patti (D'Arbanville)'s part of the family. Miss
Pamela (Des Barres) is part of the family. Barbra (Streisand) is
part of the family.''
   Johnson and D'Arbanville have a son, Jesse, and he had highly
publicized romances with Des Barres and Streisand.
   Griffith and Johnson are expecting a child and have announced
plans to remarry.
   The actor shares similar familial feelings toward the cast and
staff of ``Miami Vice,'' the show that propelled him to stardom.
   ``We've all grown together. And I'm going to miss them,'' said
Johnson. ``I'm gonna miss the whole experience, whenever it does
end. These guys have stood by me in some very rough times.''

   Penthouse magazine publisher Bob Guccione
testified that a former ``Pet of the Year'' who is suing him for $10
million was a potential Marilyn Monroe whom he had rescued from a
life of crime.
   Guccione said Tuesday that Anneka DiLorenzo, who alleges breach
of contract, sexual harassment and fraud, approached him at age 20,
eager to pose nude for Penthouse after seeing the publisher on a
talk show.
   Ms. DiLorenzo, whose real name is Marjorie Thoreson, was signed
to his company's first management contract in 1974, Guccione said.
She became the magazine's 1975-76 ``Pet of the Year.''
   Guccione cast her in his sexually explicit movie ``Caligula,''
which Ms. DiLorenzo now says was a pornographic film that ruined her
career. For Ms. DiLorenzo's role, Guccione paid for surgery to have
her breasts enlarged.
   ``I thought it was a leg up on prostitution in Las Vegas,
stealing cars, writing bum checks and building up a life of crime,''
Guccione testified. He said he cast her in the movie because
sexually she was ``extremely adroit'' and ``perfect for the part.''
   Guccione cited three actresses who appeared nude early in their
careers and became cinema sex symbols _ Marilyn Monroe, Brigitte
Bardot and Hedy Lamarr.
   ``I felt Anneka could emerge as the sex symbol of her time,'' he
said.
   Ms. DiLorenzo's lawyer, Murray Schwartz, told state Judge Elliott
Wilk that Guccione ``is probably one of the leading pornographers in
the United States.''

   Pope John Paul II, an outdoor enthusiast, went skiing
in the Apennine mountains in central Italy, state television
reported.
   The RAI network reported that the pontiff, who hiked and went
skiing frequently in his youth in Poland, took to the slopes Tuesday
at Campo Felice, a popular ski area 1{-hours from Rome.
   Two years ago, the pope took a few runs in the Apennines at the
winter resort of Ovindoli. In July 1984, he went skiing with
then-President Sandro Pertini near Trento in the northern Dolomite
mountains.

   Sentencing for Cher's boyfriend was postponed
because of a dispute over where he should perform community service
for smashing a photographer's camera.
   Municipal Court Judge Ronald Schoenberg indicated he will order
Rob Camilletti, 24, to pay $1,050 in fines, make restitution, do 300
hours of community service and serve 24 months probation, said City
Attorney's Office spokesman Mike Qualls.
   Schoenberg reset sentencing for April 4 after meeting Tuesday
with Deputy City Attorney Renee Laurents and defense lawyer John
Forbes. Ms. Laurents said the defense wants Camilletti to perform
community service in New York, where he lives.
   Camilletti pleaded no contest Feb. 28 to two counts of vandalism.
He was accused of trying to run down free-lance photographer Peter
Brandt with his Ferrari and smashing his camera outside Cher's home
Benedict Canyon home last July.
   Cher, 42, and Camilletti, a former bagel maker, pizza chef and
bartender, have been companions since meeting at a New York
nightclub on her 40th birthday.

   Longtime James Bond star Roger Moore said it wasn't
just fears about his baritone voice that led him to give up a
leading role in the latest Andrew Lloyd Webber musical.
   ``Actually, I think the voice would have stood up,'' Moore said
Tuesday in a BBC radio interview. ``It's just the whole technical
thing that would not have. It was a question of counting time and
when to come in and go out and finding those notes out of the air.''
   Moore had been rehearsing six weeks for the part of suave and
dashing George Dillingham in ``Aspects of Love,'' which opens next
month.
   ``I have had awful nightmares, really terrible,'' the 61-year-old
actor said.
   His replacement has not been announced, but Albert Finney and
Denis Quilley had been mentioned for the part.

or 'grosses legumes', as the French say - on the Paris stage are a Briton
rewriting a French opera, an Egyptian making a film show on the sacred
boards of the Comedie Francaise, and an American directing German actors in
a language they have never spoken before.
Peter Brook's Impressions of Pelleas, Yossif Chahine's Caligula and Bob
Wilson's Dr Faustus are stamped with the vision of three of Europe's
greatest directors. In all, multi-cultural strangeness and splendour
intoxicates, hints at shifting perspectives, changing realities. In Faustus,
three actors simultaneously play the hero; Pelleas has different actresses -
Chinese, Japanese, Korean - as the heroine on consecutive nights. It is
drama as haphazardly personal, fluid, unfixed. It is also highly stylised,
presenting a deliberately unreal imaginative world.
Here is the director as star: after 30 seconds you see at once Wilson's
hallmark - cold artifice - or Brook's mix of the exotic and intimately
simple. Drama, with its demand that the director realise his own view of a
play, has always been a deconstructionist's paradise. But among Europe's
theatre pioneers, we now see a late 20th century trend which parallels
post-modern developments in other arts.
One feature is a move away from the straight play to a collage of devices -
mime, acrobatics, dance, rock, film. Mostly these imposed stylisations - the
pleasure lies in the aesthetic pattern, unity of music, movement, design,
not in story or naturalistic character. A director such as Chahine makes
political points this way; others, such as Wilson, are aesthetes offering no
meaning beyond the stage. All are part of a post-modern trend in which
language is no longer the main route to meaning; dramatic impetus is not
verbal but visual, physical, spiritual.
Multi-culturalism is at the core of this phenomenon in Europe. It embodies
relativity of meaning, and it liberates directors from traditional texts and
conventional staging. It is no chance that the explorers are multi-lingual:
Brook, Wilson, Chahine, Ruth Berghaus, Peter Zadek, Luc Bondy may work in
French, German, English. The most exciting shows in Europe are translations,
radical revisions - Brook chops Debussy's opera in half and plays it with
just a piano - or works which barely have a text. All reflects a sense of
fragmentation throughout politics and culture.
Brook's Paris Tempest, with magic, acrobatics, an Indian Prospero, a black
Ariel, showed how translation turned Shakespeare 'into something rich and
strange'. For Pelleas the cavernous Bouffes du Nord venue is a fin-de-siecle
bourgeois interior with Persian carpets, Chinese vases and Japanese screens.
Fixing the oppressive mood of Maeterlinck's play the oriental actresses
playing Melisande are women from another milieu; the acting, trembling,
precise, understated, recalls the Tempest; gestures, eyes looking away
suggest souls - Prospero, Pelleas - lost in themselves. The essential is
unexpressed but subtly evoked - perfect for Maeterlinck's symbolist theatre
of silence, and for Brook's vision of intimacy and foreboding.
Where Brook has exoticism, Wilson has an abstract finesse at once
sophisticated and naive. His surrealism owes a debt to Tadeusz Kantor, whose
apocalyptic view of history as a cacophony of mass terror is enacted by
black and white ghost-figures miming or jerking into action as in early
movies to the jangle of guns, machines or folk music; there is no text.
Kantor's great Krakow show, Today's My Birthday, still tours Europe. It
echoes in Wilson's masterpiece, The Black Rider and in the weaker Dr
Faustus.
Wilson's figures, chalky faced, eyes blackened, move in irregular jumps. The
motif is cold angularity - crooked chairs six feet high, trees as scissor
cut-outs, costumes with jagged edges, a red stiletto heel jutting from a
slit in a box. Music, mime, dance, starts and stops abruptly. But it is also
an enticing nursery rhyme world: pink neon, a big pulpy moon; the devil in
Faustus, the lovers in The Black Rider, float upstage on swings.
The limit of language is Wilson's obsession. In the 'spoken opera' Faustus,
a German cast who first had to learn English, chant monosyllabic verse as
parrot grammar, maddeningly meaningless. In Wilson's new show, a musical
Alice in Wonderland, 'a word means just what I choose it to mean'. For The
Black Rider William Burroughs' banal German-English ballads match the
fairground kitsch of Tom Waits' tunes. It is art for art's sake, but
Wilson's brittle-cruel-romantic collages work because they dramatise love,
death, in a brilliantly realised, unified imagery.
Only Ruth Berghaus equals Wilson's intense abstraction. Her Hamburg Jungle
of Cities is a Brecht collectors item, a mechanised choreographic nightmare
where words hardly matter. A criss-cross of railway lines is backed by a
silhouette of skyscrapers; people enter via windows, fall into pits, as a
huge tent moves menacingly across the stage to devour all: a surreal
updating of Brecht's alienation effect.
The cityscape is the theatrical image of our time. Most influential has been
Peter Zadek's in his Vienna Merchant of Venice, relocated to Wall Street as
a satire on yuppies and a parable of survival in a brash society. The set
parodies post-modern architecture - a Richard Rodgers dream bank of steel
tubes, glass frames, mirrored panels rises to the loft of the stage - and
has sent deconstructionist echoes through many productions. The giant
lift-mirror in Bondy's Berlin Final Chorus, for example, reflects both the
mad looking glass world of bourgeois society and the audiences reaction to
it.
Chahine's Caligula is the pinnacle of this style. A huge tower block is also
a screen projecting a modern city, moving crowds, Caligula magnified as a
crazed dictator. At the end, this terrific structure disintegrates in
flames, casting out changing images, different in each part of the
auditorium. It suggests how random is our vision - sideshows range from Arab
tambourinists to punk acrobats - and how we distance terror as it is
stylised by televisual repetition.
Caligula wittily and vibrantly uses non-traditional theatre forms to
deconstruct our culture; the set is an emblem of the theme. It pinpoints a
new visual, physical drama which should spread further this decade. Since
European theatre thrives on cultural exchange, and language is of secondary
importance, it is to be hoped that more such pieces - only Pelleas is
planned for Glasgow - will visit Britain.

   A Crucial 100 Years in History

   Between the covers of William K. Klingaman's "The First
Century: Emperors, Gods, and Everyman" (Harper-Collins, 402
pages, $24.95) is a better book than he has written. This
isn't because Mr. Klingaman's richly detailed panorama of 100
years of Roman, Jewish and Chinese history fails to bring to
life a period of tremendous political, religious and economic
ferment. It is merely because in tackling so vast a canvas,
he brings the reader to the threshold of some very
fundamental questions about civilization and its discontents,
without ever clearly posing those questions. The book, in
this respect, is history without a shepherd; the precise
opposite, in fact, of say, Paul Kennedy's "The Rise and Fall
of the Great Powers," where the unfolding of events is guided
by a controlling idea.
   What Mr. Klingaman does achieve in this crisply written
book, however, is a wonderful rendering of an extraordinary
period in the march of Eastern and Western civilization.
Written largely for nonspecialists, it consists of 32 sharply
focused chapters that move briskly from assassinations in
Rome to insurrections in China and Judea, capturing all the
while the enduring sense that the individual conduct of great
men and women, for better or worse, can cast shadows over
continents.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Klingaman builds his narrative of the first century
around the lives of some 20 people, including Roman and
Chinese emperors, Jewish princes, imperial generals and
provincial rebels, Stoic philosophers, men of letters,
visionaries and prophets. His chapters on Augustus are
particularly colorful, offering a vivid portrait of this
prudish emperor, who appalled Rome with his sweeping list of
puritanical laws and banished that poet of unbridled
pleasure, Ovid, to the Black Sea.
   Who would inherit the empire after his death? That was the
great worry consuming the aging, heirless Augustus as the
century began. Mr. Klingaman shows considerable skill
describing the persistent threat to the empire from marauding
German tribes, rebellious Roman generals, as well as the
perilous challenges at home from ambitious rivals. Betrayal
was never far from the surface of Roman political life, nor
its stepchild, paranoia. And in this interplay of substance
and shadow, assassinations and executions became a periodic
means of calming the imperial mind along with other flagrant
exercises of power. Caligula, for one, understood this well.
"This beautiful throat will be cut whenever I please," he
liked to whisper, nuzzling the necks of his lovers -- often
the wives of his dinner guests. Alas for him, what went
around came around: Conspirators finally "fell upon him with
their swords, stabbing him repeatedly, taking extra care that
some of their blows pierced his genitals."
   Mr. Klingaman's tales of China are less intensely focused
on key historical players, an exception being the rise and
fall of Wang Mang. Born into the poorer branch of a noble
family during the Han dynasty, he worked his way to the top
of the imperial bureaucracy, serving as minister of war and
gaining a reputation for austere discipline. Wang Mang
probably would have enjoyed a frugal dinner with Augustus.
But once enthroned, Wang Mang's idealism gave way to personal
ambition and delusion. As rival armies gathered outside his
palace at Chang-An just before slicing him to pieces, Wang
Mang reorganized his harem and dyed his hair and beard (the
first recorded instance of hair coloration in Chinese
history, notes Mr. Klingaman).
   He brings the same eye for detail to the chapters on
Judea, which include the life and death of Jesus, the reigns
of Herod, Herod Antipas and Herod Agrippa, the destruction of
the Temple in Jerusalem, and the rise of Christianity, while
rarely losing sight of the region's volatile mix of political
and religious conflict. Nowhere is that impact more ironic,
Mr. Klingaman shows, than in the rise of Herod Agrippa, who
used his friendship with Caligula to oust his uncle Herod
Antipas as political leader of the Jewish world, only to find
himself struggling afterward to curb Caligula's own hatred of
Jews.
   The chapters on the life of Jesus, however, are awkward,
as though Mr. Klingaman weren't quite comfortable treating as
history what he knows many of his readers will view as
sacred. Mr. Klingaman's gift as a writer is for describing
events, not convictions. Viewed strictly as an event in the
first century, after all, the death of Jesus is merely one of
many crucifixions. Its full importance to history becomes
manifest only much later.
   Although largely well-written, "The First Century" does
suffer from occasional eruptions of awful phrasing.
Describing, for instance, the trial of Jesus, he comes up
with this clunker: "Still Jesus, who was clearly in a no-win
situation, refused to say anything." Or, in a passage on a
Vietnamese revolt against the Chinese empire: "It took nearly
two years for the empire to strike back."
   Still, as an overview of a turning point in history, Mr.
Klingaman's book makes for entertaining and often-instructive
reading.

   Controversy has trailed the Mapplethorpe exhibit in its tour
around the country. Last month an Ohio judge ruled that an art
gallery and its director must stand trial for displaying two
Mapplethorpe photographs that included nude or semi-nude children.
   A county grand jury indicted the Contemporary Arts Center in
Cincinnati and director Dennis Barrie on April 7, the day the
exhibit opened.
   Ross called the Cincinnati indictment a ``very sad event. It's
not a good day for museum directors when they're hauled off to
court for doing what museum directors have been doing for years.''
   The Boston show concludes an 18-month tour that included stops
in Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Hartford, Conn.,
Berkeley, Calif., and Cincinnati.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Arts: Bell-ringing and madness - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the tendency for the slightest change on BBC Radio to prompt howls of
outrage, the quiet revolution that has transformed Going Places (Radio 4,
Friday) into a pendant of Breakaway has passed comparatively bloodlessly.
Perhaps others felt as I did that the old format, with its emphasis on
adenoidal hearties of both sexes devoted to four wheels, reeked of
rusticised suburbia and saloon-bar squire-speak. They never seemed
interested in places, merely the mechanics of getting there.
The programme is now an idiosyncratic travel piece, not a holiday mag like
Breakaway but a smaller-scale exploration of the off-beat - Scotland's
secret nuclear bunker, for instance, recently opened as a tourist attraction
near Anstruther in Fife. Though it was equipped with a broadcasting studio,
the locals had no idea it was there. Chillingly, if disaster struck no
family, relatives or friends surplus to personnel were to be admitted. As
somebody remarked, many of the elite would have preferred to stay outside.
The same programme took composer Gavin Bryars to Whitby with its ruined
abbey, kipper-houses and Dracula connection. And memories of a west-country
childhood stirred within me at the news that a recalcitrant RSPCA official
had hijacked the bell-ringing swan of Wells, releasing it where there are no
bell-pulls to tug at teatime and where it presumably has to find its own
food. The swan-keeper was strangely dry-eyed. 'My wife was more affected
than I was,' he confessed, adding that she was 'a cantankerous old thing but
wonderful.' (I assume he meant the swan.)
The Madness of Kings (Radio 4) was disappointingly lightweight. It was
introduced by Christopher Cooke whose exquisite sensibilities, he once
confided to The Heritage Quiz, are jarred by such oafishness as the Last
Night of the Proms and Gilbert and Sullivan (notably, I imagine, at the Lord
High Executioner's strictures against 'the idiot who praises with
enthusiastic tone/All centuries but this and every country but his own').
The mini-series on the addling of crowned heads was inconclusive. Caligula
perhaps had encephalitis, Hitler Parkinson's. Nero was not so bad, possibly
schizophrenic. The Plantagenets had terrible tempers. Ludwig of Bavaria
probably didn't do anything with his young men, though his scheme to rob the
Rothschild bank in Frankfurt seems a trifle extreme even by today's free and
easy royal standards. The programme acknowledged the danger of describing
any boo-worthy behaviour by the all-purpose 'mad'; and then proceeded to do
so. Its brief necessarily ignored the hysterical repression that led to
middle and lower-class 'madness', breakdowns and suicide in Victorian times.
There are records of the mass demise in Bristol of an entire below-stairs
staff on the death of their mistress. Those were the days.
The nostalgia factor still operates in favour of middle-aged DJs. On Radio
John Peel drones on after a quarter-century, his vocal dreariness the aural
equivalent of fallen arches. The self-consciously quirky choice of music
recalls the modishness that had John Mortimer, no less, singing his praises.
But then the distinguished QC once referred to Boy George's 'sweet Irish
tenor'. He should be on the new matey Radio 3, along with John Peel,
Caligula and bell-ringing swans. They will be, reader, they will be.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Arts: Dances of death - Jackie Wullschlager surveys new
theatre in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW Paris theatre season has had an early, surprise star in Mortadela,
which suggests a slice of charcuterie but is about death, desire,
fleshiness. It is the most irresistibly sexy show in town, a home-spun
musical of one man's memories whose character and warmth not only thrill the
soul but throw into relief the refined heartlessness of Paris national
theatre. Mortadela, at La Cigale in Montmartre, and another powerful music
drama, Zarzuela, nearby at the Bouffes du Nord, suggests that the pulse of
Paris theatre is beating not in the premiere arrondissement but in the
raffish outer districts.
At La Cigale, an old cafe chantant or musical, Alfredo Arias' review of his
Argentinian youth celebrates the tango in its heyday and is a bittersweet
evocation of the women from his past. Some dance their way into his memory
by erotic display, like Cecilia Rosetto in 'Banana' who seduces astonished
men in the audience with peeled bananas plucked from her thighs or
head-dress; the male emcee responds with drag pastiche in bikini and
tropical fruit. Others move to the rhythm of sexual domination and
submission; one woman beats a rope on the floor as she dances to the pace of
a low-toned conga drum while another just out of reach writhes in coils of
fear and invitation.
Whirlwind tangos, jaunty cha-chas, offset sadder boleros and chansons while
an accordion wails notes of sorrow and displacement. Never far off is the
dance of death: trompe l'oeil exchange of a doll for acrobatic dwarf actress
Pilar Rebollar, apparently dashed to the ground in a family row; a butcher,
murdering his unfaithful wife with a meat knife, elaborates the macabre
title.
Most of Arias' numbers, as well as his performers, come from the music halls
of Buenos Aires and they sing and dance with a passion and romance of exiles
recreating a lost world: throaty, tender, lustful, desperate. The show's
life-is-a-cabaret mood is raw yet slick - in songs, satiric monologues,
legwork, the pattern of pumps and stilettos on the ground. Few musicals
exhilarate with the kitsch glitz of purple roses and torso-hugging velvet
while wearing a vulnerable heart so openly on their sleeves.
The French term for play or performance, spectacle, hints at the spirit not
only of French music hall and its Montmartre traditions but also of straight
French drama, which is far more likely to include song and dance routines
than its English or German counterparts. Caligula, which opened at the
Comedie Francaise earlier this year, is a brilliant example of dance
illuminating themes in a complex work through sensual power and provocative
display. But too often a play degenerates into a mindless spectacle of
formal kicks and tuneless squeaks, which is the catastrophe of the Comedie
Francaise's newest production, Lermontov's Bal Masque.
Like Mortadela, this is a dance of death, but the contrast could not be
greater. Lermontov's tale of revenge via Russian aristocratic traditions -
gambling, masked balls, wife-poisoning, duels (Lermontov, aged 27, was
killed in one) - is enacted by puppet figures in black and white, masked,
some encased in porcelain heads like 19th century dolls, who progress by
candlelight to their doom. Solemn music recalls a funeral march; passionless
dialogue is spat out in the kind of sharp glacial French, only heard on this
stage, which could cut crystal. Director Anatoli Vassiliev has achieved a
sculptural beauty which awes for perhaps 10 minutes; he leaves his ghostly
tableau on stage for three-and-a-half slow motion hours. There is no
interval.
Here is the Comedie Francaise at its most degenerate. For decades it has
lived on inflated reputation and mystique bolstered by the French press. The
classical virtues it cultivated have been pushed to such extremes that they
have turned decadent. Productions are lumbering, absolutely unemotional.
Actors move with an authoritarian chic which is stuffy and posey, and speak
in a cut glass monotone which renders all reactions the same. In particular
productions by Vassiliev, the Comedie Francaise's celebrated director
Antoine Vitez, and actor-director Jean-Luc Boutte, who here plays the
vengeful hero Arbenine as a deadly robot, are marked by a cold intelligence
which assures unity of tone, set, costumes but innoculates against force,
tenderness, passion. Unless original shows of the calibre of Chahine's
Caligula - disliked by critics, but playing to packed houses - continue to
join the repertory, the Comedie Francaise risks decline into self parody.
Across the river, Paris's second serious national theatre, the Theatre
L'Europe, could attract the brightest and best of European directors but has
wasted the last year in an almost exclusive 'cycle hispanique' of obscure
plays in Spanish and Catalan made intelligible to French audiences by
surtitles. Its home productions have been mixed - most successful was
Patrice Chereau doing Botho Strauss; most dismal Peter Zadek's Measure for
Measure spoken by a cast which barely seems to understand its lines. And for
all the Spanish enthusiasm, the most exciting French/Spanish work now
touring Europe is Alain Maratrat's feisty, moving spectacle Zarzuela, which
I reviewed at its Vienna premiere, and which has come to Peter Brook's
cavernous Bouffes du Nord theatre.
Highlights to come in the Autumn Arts Festival emphasise the growing
importance and daring of the suburban theatres which form a classy outer
ring round Paris, and it is here, and in venues like the unfashionable
Cigale that the future of Paris theatre looks most promising.

   Video mania is gripping Eastern Europe,
brought on by a booming black market in VCRs and a desire of
millions to see movies banned in state-controlled theaters.
   Clearly worried, the communist governments are going on the
attack against them, but at the same time they are trying to corner
some of the lucrative market.
   In Poland, some Roman Catholic parishes organize video showings
of religious and dissident films, and they draw large audiences.
   Any Hungarian can get a fill of gut-wrenching violence, group
sex, anti-Soviet sentiment and other East bloc taboos.
   A newspaper in Romania shocked readers recently with the account
of a rapist who lured a victim to his home by offering to show her
Sylvester Stallone in ``Rambo.''
   ``Video is a powerful weapon,'' the Czechoslovak Communist Party
daily Rude Pravo said recently.
   ``Video must no longer pass unnoticed,'' complained the Polish
weekly Politika. ``Its scale has become far too big. The video
market has managed to escape any control by the state and perhaps
this is the reason why it is flourishing.''
   According to semiofficial estimates, at least 2 million video
recorders have made their way into the six Soviet bloc countries,
which have a total population of about 110 million.
   The scarcity of video recorders and the lure of the independent
entertainment they offer means millions of East Europeans are
hunting for VCRS.
   East Europeans who travel to the West often buy VCRs for
themselves or to sell on the black market back home where they
fetch many times their Western price.
   In Romania and Bulgaria, for example, an inexpensive Western VCR
can cost the equivalent on the black market of $4,500 _ 15 times
the average monthly salary.
   In East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, VCRs are
available in special hard-currency stores, with prices ranging from
$400 in Poland to $1,200 in East Germany.
   ``It's a lot of money, but it's the best entertainment we've got
and a kind of escape from the daily fare of state-owned culture,''
said a doctor in Romania, where the state television is on the air
just two hours a day on weekdays.
   Like other East Europeans with friends or relatives in the West,
the doctor paid a hefty customs duty _ $700 _ to get a Japanese VCR
sent by his sister in West Germany.
   The demand matches the high prices.
   In Bucharest, the classified-ad pages of the government
newspaper Romania Libera are devoted almost exclusively to offers
to buy or sell videos.
   In Poland, public video showings have moved from X-rated films
like ``Emmanuelle,'' ''Caligula'' and ``120 Days of Sodom'' to
regular shows in cultural centers in housing projects or villages
that have no movie theaters.
   The Polish underground publishing house Nowa has released at
least 12 video cassettes, including the American movies ``Moscow on
the Hudson'' and ``Sophie's Choice.''
   It also has distributed banned Polish films, such as Ryszard
Bugajski's ``Przesluchania'' (The Interrogation), which is about a
woman imprisoned in the Stalinist era.
   Some Catholic parishes in Poland have VCRs, which they use for
public showings of religious and other films. A church in Bialystok
had an Easter showing of ``Yentl,'' the Barbra Streisand movie
about Jews in Poland.
   The Polish underground publication Video Narcomania estimated
last year that more than 70 percent of video cassettes in Poland
are pure escapism: pornography, science fiction, horror movies,
other thrillers and comedies.
   That pattern holds across the bloc, where the most popular
movies are Western box-office hits like ``Top Gun'' or ``Platoon.''
Recordings of American television series like ``Dallas'' and
``Dynasty'' are also well-liked, as is soft porn and anti-communist
films such as ``Rambo II'' and ``Rocky IV.''
   Apparently trying to channel popular interest toward ``less
noxious'' themes, Czechoslovakia's Rude Pravo assailed the popular
taste in videos.
   ``Video programs on the black market are creations exploiting
the lowest instincts of sexuality and inhuman violence,'' it said.
``VCR owners admire low quality movies full of blood until late at
night in copies that are hard to watch.''
   Throughout the bloc, people can watch up to four badly copied
movies a night at private video parties.
   In Romania, a Western, a porno movie and a cup of coffee costs
$16, almost 20 times more than a ticket to a state movie theater.
   Official efforts seem unlikely to stop the video craze anytime
soon, and communist governments have taken some steps to get in on
the profits.
   In Czechoslovakia, a joint venture has been established using
components and know-how from the Dutch company Philips to produce
100,000 VCRs a year.
   Throughout Eastern Europe, authorities have produced
ideologically acceptable movies for the VCR, set up rental services
and levied steep fees on imported material.
   Repression is also used. More than 100 semiofficial rental shops
in Poland are now being liquidated under a 1987 law tightening
control on the video market.
   In Lodz, some private Polish video-library owners face trial on
charges of piracy, and one case has been reported of a VCR owner
having his machine confiscated for screening porno.

<TEXT>  FROM: National Affairs Desk; TO: Jann S. Wenner; DATE: April 15, 1991;
SUBJECT: Nancy Reagan/Kitty Kelley Book Review; COMMENTS: Cancel; THERE ARE
some things, Jann, that we know in our hearts are Ugly, and this book is one
of them. It is old swill in a new bottle, a squalid tale from a squalid time
that unfortunately seems to be ours. There is something weird about any
calendar that has the Year of the Weasel happening 13 times in a row.;   
Anyway, thanks for the review copy of Kelley's book on Nancy. It was good for
a few laughs, but not many. And there is meaning in it, for sure, but not
much. It is an ugly, mean little package that made me feel cheap for just
reading it or even holding the thing in my hands.;    This book is a monument
to everything low and mean in the human spirit. It is a marketing triumph for
that dingbat from Simon and Schuster, but it is far too wrong and repugnant to
keep around the house, and last night I had to get rid of it. My friend Semmes
Luckett took it away and jammed it into a garbage compactor, along with a case
of old beer bottles. He was shocked and deeply embarrassed when he opened the
book to page 14 and saw that both he and Nancy are descended from the same
family of Lucketts that left Maryland and fled westward around the turn of the
century, when the family name came under a cloud of scandal. "My mama never
talked about it," he said, "but she left the room whenever that woman appeared
on our TV set. . . . Good Lord, I hope she never sees this book." He seized it
off the table and stood up to leave.;    The master politician;  Let's give
Nancy all the credit she deserves. The Democrats have lost five out of the
last six presidential elections, so maybe they can learn something from this
book instead of just giggling about it. Kitty Dukakis, among others, might
have put this evil handbook to good use if it had been available back in 1988.
But alas . . .;    If politics is the art of controlling your environment,
Nancy is a master politician and probably a lot more fun to live and work and
travel with than I ever suspected. She has been the Best That She Can Be, and
she has come a Very Long Way for a Size 2 Anorexic Dwarf.;    All that time
she was talking about remodeling the White House in the style of Dolley
Madison, she was acting like Linda Lovelace and Christine Keeler and Madame
Defarge all at once.;    Weirder than Caligula;  They turned the whole East
Wing of the White House into a Cave of Orgies and a dope den worse than
anything in Singapore. It was horrible. The press called him John Wayne, but
he was weirder than Caligula, and the weirder he got the more the voters loved
him and the more respect he got from Ted Koppel.;    Lyndon LaRouche was
atomized and the Deviate Rev. Jim Bakker was sent to prison for 45 years for
just dabbling in the kind of brazen, low-rent crimes that were apparently
taken for granted and pursued with relentless zeal -- day and night, 366 days
of the year, in full view of the servants and the Secret Service -- by the
folks who lived in the White House.;    Just folks. No different from you or
me or the Mitchell Brothers. And they never claimed to be anything else,
really. Just Good Ol' Dutch and What's Her Name, the maniac little sex doll
who squawked openly (allegedly) with Frank Sinatra on dim-lit couches in TV
studios, where she went constantly to tape public-service announcements about
Just Say No.;    It was a very wild act in a very fast lane, and I have to
admire it for its Heaviness. It is no small thing in some circles to make
headlines lewd and and shocking enough to bump a new KENNEDY/PALM BEACH RAPE
case off the front page of the tabloids. . . . That is Strong. . . . That is
Charles Manson country.;    Remember they laughed at Thomas Edison. And don't
forget that "Deep Throat" was a box-office hit in the same years that Nancy
spent grooming her mongrel stud for the Real Derby, the biggest race of them
all . . . and They Won!!! Twice!!!;    So never mind that review we were
talking about. The book is old gossip and sleazy little stories that we read a
long time ago and never quite believed . . . for good or ill.;    So what if
the former First Lady had the soul of a Pod and the style of a chicken in
heat? She was, in her time, perhaps the highest and finest expression of the
American dream in action . . . and that is worth noting. Some people are born
to win and others are spewed out like tadpoles. This is all ye know and all ye
need to know -- except that weasels speak English and God is a King Snake, and
if Kitty Kelley and Nancy Reagan are what America is all about these days,
there is light at the end of the tunnel.;    But not here. I am glad to be rid
of this book. It is like a bracing dose of ether on Monday Night in a Crack
House. The very sight of it fills me with queasiness and shame. To read it and
believe that it might be true is to wallow in the depths of personal and
professional degradation.;    OK. That's about it for now. Never send me a
book like this again.;    Thanks,;    Hunter;    Res Ipsa Loquitur (box)  </TEXT>

<HEAD>John Hurt: What's All the Fuss About?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The scandal about ``Scandal'' is much
overblown, declares John Hurt, star of the movie about naughty
goings-on among the high and mighty in 1960s England.
   The British actor was recently in Los Angeles for the opening of
the film, and he termed the fuss over its X rating ``a storm in a
teapot.''
   ``The scene that was allegedly the demon was what we call `the
orgy scene,'' he said. ``It was certainly not a sexy scene. It was
really a rather tawdry, nasty scene behind closed doors with a
particular tired old (upper) class.
   ``It was directly opposite to what the protagonists, Christine
Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davis represent, the `Swinging '60s.' It was
a different kind of permissiveness.''
   ``Scandal,'' which concerns the sex revelations that helped
topple Harold Macmillan's Tory government, was handed an X rating
by the Motion Picture Association of America's rating's board.
After making a few snips from the orgy scene, the film was rated R.
An X would have meant box-office death _ few bookings, fewer ads.
   Hurt viewed the film before and after the cuts and concluded:
``It says the same thing. Apparently somebody took exception to
what is known as `rocking motion.' The `rocking motion' went, and
something else was put in its place.''
   The reaction in England to ``Scandal'' was something else. ``We
had quite a lot of flak for making the film. The Establishment
somewhat closed ranks, really. What I call `the poor old Jack
syndrome' came up. `Why drag him through it again?'
   ``Which is understandable, I suppose, but most of the criticisms
were made by people who hadn't read the script or certainly seen
the film. That's not surprising, I suppose, because they may have
thought that we were making some kind of specious movie. Which is
not the outcome at all.''
   ``Poor Old Jack'' is John Profumo, Britain's former minister of
war, a married man who was bedding Keeler at the same time she was
having an affair with a Soviet naval attache and suspected spy.
   ``I can't say that we did (Profumo) a favor, but I think the
film has put him in a different light,'' Hurt said. ``Our
perception is different from the public's perception at the time,
largely gleaned from the sensationalist press.''
   Hurt portrays the late Stephen Ward, an osteopath who was
charged with pimping for his celebrity clients.
   ``I think it's pretty clear from the evidence that he was a
scapegoat,'' the actor said.
   With his gaunt face and intense manner, John Hurt has made a
specialty of difficult portrayals. The most notable was the title
role in ``Elephant Man,'' which drew an Academy nomination as best
actor.
   ``Robert DeNiro would do something like `Raging Bull' the same
year,'' Hurt said about the actor who won the prizethat year.
   He was the mad emperor Caligula in ``I, Claudius,'' and the
eccentric homosexual Quentin Crisp in ``The Naked Civil Servant.''
   In ``Champions,'' he was a famed jockey who conquered cancer,
the inmate of a Turkish prison in ``Midnight Express'' _ for which
he received an Oscar nomination as supporting actor, and the
homosexual cop in ``Partners'' with Ryan O'Neal.
   Hurt moves smoothly between the London and New York stage,
television and films. Surprisingly for a stage-trained actor, he
prefers movies.
   ``If I were told that I could only do one medium and had to cut
the rest out, I think I would choose film,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Saint Paul Pioneer Press will end
afternoon publication Nov. 9. The move is expected to eliminate
about 30 jobs.
   Mary Junck, publisher and president, said circulation of the
evening paper had dropped to 29,000 from a high of 121,000 in 1972.
Morning circulation of the paper has soared, she said.
   ``Like newspaper readers in other parts of the country, most of
ours want their newspaper in the morning,'' Junck said Oct. 23.
   A poor economic outlook for 1991 also led to the decision.
   ``The conversion to AM enables the Pioneer Press to focus all
its resources on the morning and Sunday editions. We're positioned
very well to be even more competitive and increase our circulation
at an even faster pace,'' Junck said.
   The Twin Cities' other evening newspaper, the Minneapolis Star,
was discontinued in 1982.
   Newsroom reductions will be through attrition and a voluntary
early retirement program, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Boehm Says He Made a Mistake by Staking Out Newspaper Building</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State Tax Commissioner John Boehm said he
erred in staking out a newspaper building to see who among his
employees had gone there to complain that he was stifling their
free speech at work.
   ``In retrospect, I made a mistake,'' Boehm said Oct. 25. ``It
was an error in judgment.''
   Earlier this month, a dozen Department of Revenue employees went
to the Journal-Star Printing Co. building to talk to a reporter.
Boehm acknowledged that he and his deputy commissioner drove around
the building, which houses the Lincoln Journal, The Lincoln Star
and Lincoln office of The Associated Press.
   A day later, Boehm distributed a memo to department
administrators. It dealt with whether employees could be
disciplined for insubordinate remarks during staff meetings about
the governor, a department head or other supervisors.
   Three of the employees who went to the newspaper building said
Oct. 25 that they felt department employees put their careers in
jeopardy if they disagreed with Boehm or criticized the
administration of Gov. Kay Orr.
   They said Boehm's surveillance increased their worries.
   ``Their fears are unfounded,'' Boehm said. ``I went there
because I had been told that maybe 40 or 50 department people were
going to be there and I was curious. I wasn't taking names.''
   Boehm said none of the employees who talked to reporters would
be subject to disciplinary action for speaking out.

<HEAD>Paper Carrier Allegedly Burglarized Out-of-Town Customers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper carrier has been accused of
burglarizing the homes of subscribers after they notified him to
suspend delivery while they were out of town.
   Dwayne L. Young, 32, who delivered the Austin American-Statesman
in an area west of the University of Texas campus, was charged with
burglary of a habitation, burglary of a motor vehicle and criminal
mischief.
   Police said he is suspected in about 30 residential break-ins
and 20 burglaries of vehicles, the newspaper reported Sept. 26.
   Police have recovered about $11,600 worth of stolen property
from the burglaries, which date to last December.
   Young was not an employee of the newspaper but was one of about
650 independent contractors who deliver the American-Statesman, the
paper said. He has delivered newspapers since August 1989.

   A photographer said he billed Gov. Tommy

in a television advertisement without permission.
   Michael Kienitz, a freelancer and former University of Wisconsin

<HEAD>Defense in Reporter-Slaying Trial Says Jury Pool Too White</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for Joseph Lomax, who is charged
in the slaying of newspaper reporter Kara Laczynski three years
ago, urged a Superior Court judge to make sure blacks and
minorities are well represented on the jury in Lomax's third trial.
   Race has evolved into a central issue in the case. Lomax is
black and Laczynski was white.
   During Lomax's second trial, defense lawyer Joseph Moniz
compared the Laczynski slaying to the well-known Stuart case in
Boston, where police were criticized for seeking a black suspect in
the killing of a white woman. Numerous blacks were questioned in
that case and one black man became a suspect before the woman's
husband was implicated.
   Supporters of Lomax characterize him as a black victim of white
justice.
   In a motion filed in Hartford Superior Court on Oct. 22, Moniz
urged Judge Maxwell Heiman ``to take appropriate steps to assure a
sufficient number of blacks and minorities to reflect a fair
cross-section of the community.''
   The names of potential jurors are culled only from voter
registration lists and Motor Vehicles Department records, Moniz
wrote.
   The jury pool thus fails to include city residents who don't
need or can't afford a car and who have been ``alienated from
participation in the political process,'' Moniz said.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Guccione, Penthouse To Pay Former Model $4 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bob Guccione and Penthouse magazine have been
ordered to pay more than $4 million to a former Pet of the Year who
said she was forced to perform hard-core sex acts and sleep with
two Guccione associates.
   ``Sexual slavery was not part of her job description,'' Supreme
Court Justice Elliott Wilk said in finding that the magazine
publisher made sexual demands on Marjorie Thoreson as a condition
of employment at Penthouse, where she worked from 1973 to 1980.
   His ``cold and calculating . . . use of sexual coercion forced
her to safeguard her employment by sacrificing her body,'' the
judge said Oct. 23.
   Penthouse's lawyer, Jeffrey Daichman, called the award an
outrage and said he would appeal.

   Fifty-eight members of Congress have joined in
a protest to Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko over his banishment
of a prominent opposition leader to internal exile.
   A letter circulated by Rep. Ronald Dellums, D-Calif., urged
Mobutu to rescind his banishment of Tshisekedi wa Mulumba, who was
sent last month to a remote town in northeastern Zaire.
   ``This internal exile is a clear violation of internationally
recognized civil and political rights,'' the letter said. It was
dated May 3 and made available Friday by the Rainbow Lobby, which
has been pushing to reverse the U.S. policy of support for Mobutu.
   Tshisekedi, a former interior minister who now leads the
opposition Union for Democracy and Social Progress, was seized
April 8 after writing a letter calling Mobutu the ``Zairian
Caligula,'' a reference to the Roman despot.
   The letter criticized Mobutu for failing to implement promises
of greater democracy.

FT  15 APR 94 / Italian allies agree choice of speakers: Northern League
insists on 31-year-old former student activist 'to breathe new life into
parliament'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The three main parties of Italy's Freedom Alliance yesterday buried their
differences over the choice of speakers for the two houses of parliament and
agreed on compromise candidates.
The agreement paves the way for a smooth opening of Italy's 12th postwar
legislature today and early election of the speakers of the senate and
chamber of deputies. This is the first constitutional step towards forming a
new government, which is likely to be headed by media magnate Mr Silvio
Berlusconi.
The Alliance parties - Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia, the populist Northern
League and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance - have been squabbling for
four days over who should fill these two key institutional posts. The most
difficult has been that of the senate, where the Alliance is six seats short
of a majority and whose speaker deputises for the president of the republic.
Yesterday, the three parties agreed to propose Mr Carlo Scognamiglio, an
economist and former rector of the private Rome university, Luiss. Mr
Scognamiglio was a Liberal senator who transferred to Forza Italia.
His good contacts with the Rome establishment are considered likely to
attract some cross-party support to help the Alliance majority. He is also
well connected to the business world through his second wife, the daughter
of Susanna Agnelli (sister of Fiat boss Giovanni) and his current companion,
Cecilia Pirelli, daughter of Leopoldo Pirelli, the former head of the family
tyre and cables group.
The agreement on Mr Scognamiglio, 49, who studied at the London School of
Economics, was made possible by the withdrawal of the League candidate, Mr
Francesco Speroni. The League, as the party with the most parliamentarians
in the Alliance, had insisted on one of its own being the senate speaker. By
persuading him to stand down, Mr Berlusconi has been able to demonstrate he
is not going to be dictated to by the League with its strong federalist
aims.
But as a sop, the Alliance agreed to accept a League deputy to act as
speaker of the chamber. They chose to propose Ms Irene Pivetti, 31, a former
Catholic student activist and League deputy for Monza in the previous
legislature.
Never before has such a young and inexperienced person been proposed for
this key moderating post in the chamber; but the Alliance wanted to signal
their desire to breathe new life into a discredited parliament.
Commenting on the proposal to nominate Ms Pivetti, Mr Massimo Scalia, a
Green spokesman, said: 'We Romans are long used to being tolerant. Since
Caligula proposed a horse to be senator we are not surprised by anything.'
Today, as the new parliament convenes, the immunity of the members of the
11th legislature is finally removed. This means that 26 members risk
immediate arrest, the most prominent being Mr Giulio De Donato, the former
Socialist minister, whom Naples magistrates have been seeking to arrest on a
string of corruption charges for several months.

   MEXICO CITY -- Saddam Hussein is getting awfully good
press in this Latin American oil capital.
   Iraq's claim to be fighting to save the Palestinians
rather than to subjugate the Kuwaitis is accepted
unskeptically by much of Mexico's editorial-writing
intelligentsia. One columnist alleges that the U.S. tricked
Iraq into invading Kuwait so that the gringo army would have
a pretext to take over both Arab countries. Another writer
likens President Bush to the sadistic Roman emperor Caligula.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The benign attitude toward Saddam Hussein isn't confined
to inveterately anti-"yanqui" pundits. Radio call-in shows
reflect surprising pro-Saddam Hussein sentiment. There have
been sizable demonstrations at the U.S. Embassy, but none of
note outside the Iraqi Embassy.
   Why do so many traditionally pacific Mexicans manifest
sympathy for the "Butcher of Baghdad?" To many Mexicans, the
U.S. motive for going to war isn't so much creating "a new
world order" as defending an old one: First World
interventionism to secure Third World oil. And that touches a
raw nerve in Mexico, which has a lot of oil and a lot of
experience with U.S. intervention.
   The anti-American outpouring, one of the most vitriolic
public discourses in recent memory here, is likely to make it
harder for President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to liberalize
Mexico's nationalistic oil policy. Mr. Salinas took a
significant step last November by agreeing to allow U.S.
oil-service companies to operate openly here. That concession
came in return for a U.S. government pledge of loans to boost
flagging production at the state-owned oil monopoly,
Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex.
   But the widespread resentment of U.S. policy toward
another poor, oil-producing country, Iraq, will probably make
Mr. Salinas think twice before ceding further ground to the
gringos. "It makes it more likely that Salinas will take a
closed posture on oil, at least for now," says George Baker,
an oil analyst in Berkeley, Calif.
   Mexico has already wavered from its initial hard-line
stance against Iraq. Last autumn, Mr. Salinas said he was
willing to send Mexican troops to the Persian Gulf if the
U.N. backed the use of force. But Mr. Salinas later reversed
himself, evidently because his offer was widely criticized
here as going too far to please the Americans. Ultimately,
Mexico's response to the invasion of Kuwait was limited to a
condemnation of Iraq and a modest increase in oil exports to
the U.S.
   Mexican nationalism has been fueled by oil since the
country expropriated foreign oil holdings in 1938. That
accounts for the high-octane debate over the Gulf war.
   "If a producing country doesn't respond to the interests
of Washington, then the U.S. will do whatever it takes to
guarantee its energy security," wrote a columnist in the
business newspaper El Financiero. "That is the lesson of the
Persian Gulf war for all of the oil-producing countries,
among them Mexico."
   The populist Party of the Democratic Revolution, the
leading opposition to Mr. Salinas's ruling party, has called
on the government to suspend oil sales to the U.S. and other
combatants. It said the war was of a piece with previous U.S.
interventions in Latin America. "We cannot leave the fate of
humanity in the hands and the morals of the murderers of
Grenada and Panama," said leftist leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas,
whose father was the Mexican president who nationalized
foreign oil holdings in 1938.
   The left's anti-war stance has put pressure on Mr.
Salinas's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. The party
issued a statement that raised questions about the motives
for the war and the lengths Mexico should go to support it.
The party called on Mr. Salinas to "keep us on the sidelines
of the . . . dispute for control over oil."

FT  21 MAR 92 / Books: The FO mandarins decoded - Robert Mauthner enjoys
some diplomatic inside knowledge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER

<TEXT>
INSIDE THE FOREIGN OFFICE by John Dickie Chapmans Pounds 20, 338 pages
MORE THAN any department of state, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has
succeeded in shrouding itself in an aura of mystique and elitism which has
elicited both the admiration and irritation of the public and Parliament. In
the words of the latest work attempting to break down its hallowed portals:
'Those on the inside are bound by a code of confidentiality which inhibits
the disclosure of affairs of state in any detail that might be damaging to
the best interests of the country. Those on the outside . . . are not
normally trusted to have access to anything or anyone in the Foreign Office
which could result in the outside world getting to know what is really going
on inside.'
Things are not quite as bad as they are sometimes painted, however. Foreign
Office mandarins, though often imbued with a sense of their own superiority
 -just like those of the Treasury or the grands corps in France - have
proved to be more accessible during the last decade or two. Nowadays, some
are even prepared to talk to journalists they know well, ('off the record,'
of course), though the knowledge imparted in these conversations is only
rarely of the kind to produce banner headlines.
John Dickie, the immensely experienced, if sometimes endearingly irascible,
Diplomatic Correspondent of the Daily Mail from 1960 until his retirement
last year, has been more successful than most of his fellow mortals in
penetrating the veils of secrecy which envelop Sir Giles Gilbert Scott's
impressive Victorian palace in King Charles Street. One of the last of the
dying breed of Fleet Street prima donnas, Dickie, habitually sporting a
carnation even in the desert, can claim to have covered most of the major
international events and conferences of the last 30 years. He has liberally
drawn on his long experience, complemented by as many as 150 interviews with
senior diplomats, international civil servants and politicians, in his book,
Inside the Foreign Office.
This is a painstaking and thoroughly researched study of both the way the FO
works, the personalities and policies of the Foreign Secretaries who have
led it, from Lord Home to Mr Douglas Hurd, and some of the most dramatic
events in which they and their officials were the leading actors, the work
highlights both the department's strengths and weaknesses.
In particular, Dickie tempers his admiration for the intellectual brilliance
of some of the most outstanding mandarins of the period covered - Sir
Nicholas Fenn, Sir Michael Palliser, Sir David Hannay, Sir John Kerr, to
name but a few of those earning a place in the author's hall of fame - with
telling statistics underlining the restrictive nature of the FO's
recruitment system. In spite of recent efforts to broaden the selection
process, the great majority of candidates recommended for appointments in
the Diplomatic Service - about 70 per cent over the last few years - still
come from Oxford or Cambridge, while women continue to obtain no more than
30 per cent of the places , at the very most. Without professing to be a
political history of the 30-year period during which the author had a
grandstand view of the conduct of British foreign policy, the book affords
some illuminating insights into what happened behind the scenes of major
events. The patience and dedication shown by Lord Carrington and his
officials, including the present Ambassador to the US, Sir Robin Renwick, in
negotiating against tremendous odds the Lancaster House agreement leading to
the independence of Zimbabwe, is analysed in some detail, as is the same
Foreign Secretary's failure to read the writing on the wall before the
Argentine invasion of the Falklands.
As one would expect from a journalist, amusing anecdotes are not lacking
about 'the helmsmen' at the Foreign Office, but he never descends into
caricature. Thus Lord Home, whose nomination as Foreign Secretary in 1960 by
Harold Macmillan was described by the Daily Mirror as 'the most reckless
political appointment since the Roman Emperor Caligula made his favourite
horse a consul,' is shown to be a particularly tough and effective
negotiator with the Russians, as demonstrated by his expulsion of 105
suspected Soviet agents. Neither is George Brown's often intemperate
behaviour allowed to distort the picture of a Foreign Secretary
wholeheartedly dedicated to getting Britain into the European Community.
The much-publicised conflicts between the Foreign Office and 10 Downing
Street during Margaret Thatcher's last years of office are put in their
proper historical perspective. The author stresses that this phenomenon is
nothing new. Churchill dominated Eden at the Foreign Office, while he, in
turn, did the same to Selwyn Lloyd. Wilson did not hesitate to take over
foreign policy in spite of the resentment of his Foreign Secretaries Michael
Stewart and George Brown. But at the end of the day, even Mrs Thatcher
surrounded herself with Foreign Office mandarins as her close advisers,
including, notably, her all-powerful private secretary, Charles Powell. She
may not have liked the institution, but she certainly respected and liked
its top of the range products.

   In the 1970s, Bob Guccione was the prototypical swinging
magazine publisher. Like his counterpart and rival, Playboy
publisher Hugh Hefner, Mr. Guccione lived fast and made
millions selling sexual fantasy through the pages of
Penthouse.
   Hef has largely retired to the mansion. But Mr. Guccione,
60 years old and loaded down with gold chains and medallions,
is still swinging. Though many pin-striped publishers are
closing magazines or auctioning large properties, Mr.
Guccione has become, largely by default, the most acquisitive
publisher in the business.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As chairman of closely held General Media International
Inc., Mr. Guccione is moving beyond the skin magazines on
which he's built his fortune, snapping up special-interest
magazines for car lovers and personal-computer users --
magazines that other publishers had passed on as being too
small or in fields too competitive. In June, he acquired
Stock Car Racing and two other car magazines. In April, he
acquired Compute] from Capital Cities/ABC Inc. He has doubled
the circulation of Four Wheeler magazine since acquiring it
in 1986. And he may revive the defunct literary magazine
Saturday Review, to which he owns the rights, as a Sunday
magazine supplement to metropolitan newspapers.
   Profits from Four Wheeler, 12-year-old Omni magazine,
digest-sized Forum and a slew of Penthouse spinoffs financed
his $5 million launch in 1988 of Longevity, a health magazine
that has grown quickly in advertising and circulation.
General Media International, once known as Penthouse
International, stayed away from junk bond financing in the
1980s. It has manageable debt, Mr. Guccione says, and thus
can spend on start-ups and acquisitions with relative
freedom.
   "Guccione is in good shape," says Charles Elbaum,
president of Publishing Economics Inc., a consulting company.
"It's a smart and quiet company. They don't make a lot of
noise, but they make a lot of money."
   Indeed, Penthouse has long supported Mr. Guccione's
luxurious life style. His Manhattan town house includes a
ballroom, indoor pool, and paintings by Chagall, Degas and
Picasso. Mr. Guccione, dressed in a sweater, no shirt, and
the usual array of gold chains and rings, says: "I can't ever
forget what Penthouse has done for us. It spoiled us." Mr.
Guccione runs the company with his wife, Kathy Keeton, who is
vice chairman of General Media and heads Omni and Longevity.
   "Other publishers, they respect me," Mr. Guccione adds.
"They may not say it, but they would die to have Penthouse.
It's a cash cow. People look down their noses at the National
Enquirer, but when it was up for sale, all the major
publishers stood in line, and it sold for $412 million."
   But Mr. Guccione is also regarded as part of the seamy
underbelly of the magazine world. Several national drug and
convenience store chains continue to boycott Penthouse and
other men's magazines. There's also lingering fallout from
former Attorney General Edwin Meese's Commission on
Pornography, which scared retailers and stirred community
activists who object to Penthouse and Playboy.
   These challenges may have helped to depress Penthouse's
circulation, though the magazine, which generates about 60%
of General Media's $200 million in annual revenue, remains a
huge seller. According to Capell's Circulation Report, an
industry newsletter, Penthouse last year was the No. 7
magazine and No. 3 monthly in newsstand sales at 1.9 million
copies a month.
   The Audit Bureau of Circulations, which lists numbers
based on a six-month reporting period, puts Penthouse's total
circulation for this year's first half at 1.7 million.
Playboy expects to report circulation for the same period of
about 3.4 million, three-quarters of that from subscriptions.
With a $5 cover price, Penthouse's newsstand sales make it
the most profitable monthly magazine in the country for the
retailers who sell it.
   Penthouse sells about 63% of the total copies it puts on
newsstands and at checkouts, making it one of only 20
magazines in the country to sell over 60%. That may augur
well for the future: Publishers are expected to be hit with a
postal-rate increase of as much as 23% early next year. "If
you are a publisher heavily into subscriptions, you will get
slammed by the rate increase," says Mr. Elbaum.
   But even with that advantage, Mr. Guccione knows the glory
days of Penthouse are past. Selling 1.9 million copies a
month is "terrific by industry standards, considering
Penthouse is usually sold behind the counter" or in a rack
that obscures most of the magazine's cover, says Dan Capell,
the consultant who tracks magazine circulation. But in the
days before the Meese commission, Penthouse newsstand sales
reached 3.8 million copies in 1982.
   Many major retailers still refuse to sell the magazine.
Southland Corp., the nation's largest convenience-store
owner, stripped Penthouse and Playboy from the shelves of its
4,500 company-owned 7-Eleven stores in 1986 and recommended
that its 4,000 franchised stores do the same. "The vast
majority of franchises do comply with our recommendation,"
says Cecilia Norwood, a Southland spokeswoman. Peoples Drug
Stores Inc., operator of 500 stores in the mid-Atlantic
states, also banned Penthouse in 1986, then allowed it back
on a trial basis last year until customer complaints and slow
sales prompted the chain to pull it again.
   "Its sales have never recovered, either because of lack of
exposure at the counters or because tastes have changed,"
says John Harrington, president of the Council for Periodical
Distributors Associations.
   Mr. Guccione concedes that newsstand sales are likely to
fall further in coming years. "Penthouse will continue to be
our flagship, but there will never be another magazine that
can sell four million copies a month at newsstands," he says.
   Mr. Guccione's attempts to create other men's and sexually
explicit magazines haven't worked. Viva, a sex magazine for
women, bombed because retailers displayed it next to Hustler
instead of Cosmopolitan. New Look, a general-interest
magazine that used striking, often shocking photos, including
some nudity that wasn't sexually suggestive, was launched in
1985, near the height of publicity stirred by the Meese
commission. Many stores were afraid to carry it, and it
folded after a year.
   Mr. Guccione made his first stab at special-interest
magazines in 1986 with the acquisition of Four Wheeler, a
magazine based in Canoga Park, Calif. Mr. Guccione says he
"didn't mess with the editorial product," kept the offices in
California, and improved the paper stock and design. In four
years, Four Wheeler's circulation has nearly doubled to
355,466. The three automotive titles bought in June will be
added to the Four Wheeler division and sold to advertisers as
a group.
   Compute] will be more of a gamble. The computer magazine
field is thoroughly saturated. Under Capital Cities/ABC,
circulation for Compute] was falling. Under the control of
Ms. Keeton, Compute] will be reintroduced with a new design
in October and aimed mainly at home and office
personal-computer users. Compute] will be offered to
advertisers in a package with Omni, Mr. Guccione's science
magazine.
   Mr. Guccione's longest leap from his Penthouse past is
probably his introduction of a Russian edition of Omni, which
involved speaking recently before the Soviet Academy of
Sciences. "In the U.S., they say, `How could Bob Guccione
create a science magazine? It must be a fluke,'" Mr. Guccione
says. "But the Soviets have a hunger for Western ideas. I was
treated as if I were Funk and Wagnall."
   But there was another dimension to his visit. Some
Russians took him aside and suggested that he launch a
Russian version of Penthouse, he adds. "They told me it would
be good for the Soviet man."

FT  11 JUN 94 / Arts: A gory tale retold - A look at a new version of
'Thyestes'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attack me with whips and snakes. The zodiac's falling. My hair's standing on
end with horror. The stars have all run away.
No, these melodramatic flights come not from some Elizabethan, Jacobean or
Romantic melodrama, but from the Roman playwright Seneca. And they come from
him by way of, of all people, Caryl Churchill, whose translation of his
Thyestes has just arrived at the Royal Court's Theatre Upstairs after its
debut last week in Manchester.
Seneca's plays are an odd mix: overblown rhetoric, lurid descriptions of
gore, and - so surprising - some remarkably acute psychological strokes. The
average Senecan speech builds one massive blockbuster effect on another,
piling Pelion on Ossa, and so it is astonishing when one character suddenly
says 'I know not what, but it is something'. Yes, it sounds like Lear. And
the gore recalls Titus Andronicus. To Seneca, however, it probably closer to
home - he had lived through the reigns of Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius.
Thyestes re-tells the most appalling crime in all Greek mythology. Atreus
(papa to Agamemnon) kills the children of his brother Thyestes and, in a
banquet, has him (unwitting) feed on their flesh and drink their blood. The
killing and eating occur offstage, the blood-drinking onstage. Why has
Churchill turned to this gruesome tale? Partly, I guess, because it
continues the macabre studies she entered in Lives of the Great Poisoners.
Partly because Seneca had such an influence on English drama. And partly
because Seneca probably did not write for the stage and because (again, I'm
guessing) Churchill is interested in subjects that elude conventional drama.
It would help, mind you, if she did more in the play's early stages to show
who is who. Which brother are we hearing talking about the other brother? It
takes too long to discover. But Churchill's translation skilfully points up
all the play's influence on Elizabethan drama, while investing it with some
welcome modernity of utterance. Listening to her text has its rewards for
the student of Seneca, of Churchill, and Eng. lit. Most of it, however, is
dull for the theatregoer.
It might be more gripping if James Macdonald had directed the play with more
variety of inflection. The style of acting is low-key. The intention may be
to put a layer of ice over the fire in these people's guts, but the effect
is mere tepidity. Accents come from all over the British Isles. (Thyestes
and Atreus - Ewan Stewart and Kevin McMonagle  - both sound Glaswegian.)
Videos show images of events offstage; we don't see Thyestes scoffing his
kids but we do see him in post-prandial plenitude. The tone is flat,
avoiding suspense.
The result only underlines how poor Seneca was at sustaining psychological
or dramatic interest on a moment-by-moment basis. It is amazing how he kept
all the feeblest features of Greek drama while ditching or muddling all the
best. Worst, I think, are the numerous crummy fortune-cookie utterances. 'No
luck lasts. Pain and delight take it in turns.' And - my nomination for
naffest sentiment - 'You'd have to be really greedy for life if you didn't
want to die when the whole world's dying with you.' Which may be true to
think, but, in mid-drama, is mighty silly to say.

Premier of Queensland Mixes
Bold Views, Weak Syntax;
Giant Peanut at Kingaroy

<TEXT>
   Sir Johannes Bjelke-Petersen, the 76-year-old peanut farmer who wants to be Australia's next prime minister, offends bunches of voters at the drop of a hat. 

   He calls homosexuals "evil animals," mocks the "heathen beliefs" of aborigines and says the best thing that could happen to Australia is to "get rid of all the media" so that "no one will know anything." 

   During his 19 years as premier of the state of Queensland, he has kept sex education out of schools and backed oil drilling on the Great Barrier Reef. 
Aborigines once tried to sing him to death in an ancient ritual. 
Prime Minister Bob Hawke calls him "demented." 

   Yet since announcing his national campaign in late January, Sir Joh, as he likes to be called, has gathered considerable backing. 
The latest polls put his support as high as 27%. 
Political analysts say his simple messages -- low taxes, smaller government, law and order -- strike the same deep chords that President Reagan has so successfully touched in American voters. 

   In a predominantly secular and leisure-loving country, Sir Joh, the son of a Danish-born Lutheran pastor, is a fundamentalist Christian who adheres to the strictest of work ethics. 
"I don't take holidays," he says. 
"I don't believe in them." 

   The contrast with the present prime minister is striking: Mr. Hawke, also a minister's son, is an agnostic who doesn't make any secret of his hard-drinking and womanizing past. 
He is an Oxford-educated Rhodes Scholar who once headed the country's trade-union movement and now heads the Labor Party. 
Sir Joh, a member of the conservative National Party, is a teetotaler who left school at 13, shunned even such wholesome entertainments as country dances and became a millionaire by scratching farms out of scrub. 
His stated goal is to smash the unions. 

   "If a dog frightens you and bites people, you tie it up," he says. 
"The unions hurt and frighten people, and I'm going to tie them up." 
In 1985 he sacked about 1,000 striking Queensland electricity workers in one of the toughest stands ever taken against a union in Australia. 

   Sir Joh's strong views have made him plenty of enemies. 
Although political violence is almost unknown in Australia, he wore a bulletproof vest in one election campaign because of death threats. 
In 1975, a letter bomb injured two members of his staff. 

   Some of the animosity springs from frustration with the state's distorted electoral system. 
In Queensland, the value of rural votes far outweighs that of city votes. 
This enabled Sir Joh to win last November's state election with less than 40% of the vote. 
In the past, he has governed on as little as 19%. 

   His political adventures have at times brought more ridicule than abuse: 

   --In 1978, he defied a federal ban to bring to Queensland a therapist who claimed he could cure cancer. 
The therapist was jailed five years later in the U.S. for defrauding patients. 

   --Sir Joh gave government backing to an inventor who said he could build a hydrogen-powered car. 
A demonstration of the car ended in farce when nobody could produce the ignition keys. 
The inventor has since slipped from the public eye. 

   --When New Zealand banned nuclear ships from its ports, Sir Joh retaliated on behalf of the excluded U.S. Navy by refusing Queensland port facilities to a cargo of New Zealand chocolates. 

   Political opponents have called the Queensland premier mentally incompetent. 
Last year, the opposition presented the state Parliament with a report by a British psychologist and a linguistics expert. 
It found that Sir Joh's stumbling syntax put him "close to the bottom of the range for brain-damaged speakers." 

   It is, in fact, sometimes difficult to decipher the premier's meaning. 
Verbatim quotes occasionally are as garbled and hard to punctuate as the following: "The only ones who wish me to retire really, truly, honestly -- people -- in our party they're rock-solid, they have got no options in lots of ways, you know very well, but that's not necessary, the people who want me to retire are the socialists." 

   Sentences like that caused one political opponent to quip, "Joh is the only politician in Australia who doesn't need a scrambler on his phone." 

   There have been jokes, too, about Sir Joh's family's ambitions. 
In 1980 his wife, Florence, until then best known for her baking prowess, was elected to a federal senate seat, giving rise to what headline writers like to call the "Flo and Joh Show." 
Their son, John, a cattle farmer, also may step onto the federal stage. 
Sir Joh has been mulling the possibility of finding a parliamentary seat for him. 

   All this has caused Bill Hayden, Australia's foreign minister, to remark that Sir Joh should emulate the Roman emperor Caligula and "put his horse in the senate, too." 
But some analysts aren't laughing at Sir Joh. 
"He has to be taken extremely seriously," says Queensland historian Ross Fitzgerald. 
"He has tremendous financial backing." 

   A federal election isn't due until early next year, and it isn't clear exactly what strategy Sir Joh will pursue. 
If a National Party member of Parliament stands aside for him, he could win a federal seat in a by-election before the next national election and hope to be given the party leadership. 
If that doesn't work out, he hasn't ruled out starting his own party. 

   Mr. Fitzgerald argues that Australia's bleak economic outlook makes people receptive to Sir Joh's style of rhetoric. 
"Political debate may get pushed so far to the right," he says, "that previously bizarre notions suddenly become credible, as they did in Hitler's Germany." 

   Sir Joh's financial backers include real-estate developers such as Michael Gore, whose Sanctuary Cove tourist and residential complex is permitted, by a special act of the state Parliament, to disregard certain zoning and planning regulations, and Edward Kornhauser, whose Paradise Center high-rise development also benefited from a special state parliamentary act. 

   "As an investor it's very nice that the premier himself will speak with you," Mr. Kornhauser says. 
"In other states you get tied up in red tape." 

   Sir Joh and his ministers have been embroiled in controversies over their own business interests, but Sir Joh says "there's nothing in" allegations of corruption that have been leveled at him or his government. 
He has taken to using Australia's tough defamation laws to silence allegations; he says he filed 16 suits over stories that appeared before the last state election. 

   So far, Sir Joh has disclosed few details of the policies he will pursue if he wins a seat in the federal Parliament. 
He typically brushes aside questions on specifics. 
For example, at a campaign rally last month, Sir Joh said he supported Bruce Ruxton, the veterans' association leader who has criticized black and Asian immigration to Australia. 
Asked to elaborate on his policy regarding Asian immigration, Sir Joh responsed to this reporter: "You mind your own business. 
I'm not going to tell you everything I intend to do. 
Next thing you'll be asking me what color socks I'm wearing." 

   But the lack of detail doesn't trouble Sir Joh's supporters, many of whom come from the small towns and big farms that dot the vast outback of a state 2 1/2 times the size of Texas. 

   The premier's hometown is typical. 
The first hint that you are entering "Joh Country" is a roadside billboard demanding, "Are You a Christian?" 
The next is the giant peanut atop the sign proclaiming the town of Kingaroy. 
Sir Joh says he tries to get home to Kingaroy every Sunday. 
As a lay pastor, he sometimes delivers the sermon in the little Lutheran church nearby, while Lady Flo plays hymns on the organ. 

   "You'd never ever dream that quiet, nicely spoken young chap would have become the politician he is today," says Arnold Tessmann, taking a break from the evening milking to discuss the prospect of his neighbor's becoming prime minister. 
"I think he'd make a good prime minister, but I couldn't say for sure he'll get there. 
Australia might be different from Queensland."

<HEAD>Federal Ethics Czar Appeals To Presidential Commission</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ethics czar whose rulings would have the
force of law is needed to stiffen and standardize a welter of
federal rules, regulations and policies against conflict of
interest, according to members of a presidential commission.
   ``The ethics laws in government now are about like the Roman
Empire when Caligula was ... (using) small print in high places to
confuse the public. I'm confused,'' former Attorney General Griffin
Bell told President Bush's ethics commission at its first meeting
Tuesday.
   Bell, who is vice chairman of the eight-member panel, was among
the members who embraced the idea of establishing the ethics czar.
   ``We need a Judge Landis,'' said panel member Lloyd N. Cutler,
who was White House counsel to President Jimmy Carter. ``And one in
Congress as well.''
   Cutler referred to U.S. District Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis of
Chicago, who was named the first commissioner of major league
baseball in 1920 after members of the Chicago White Sox threw the
1919 World Series. Landis quickly assumed wide powers, including
banning some players from the game for life. His firm action was
credited with cleaning up what had become known as the Black Sox
scandal.
   No final recommendations were made at the first meeting of the
commission which has just one month to propose to Bush legislative
and administrative changes needed to improve federal ethics
enforcement.
   As the group debated which issues to address, Bell complained
that ``like the sumptuary laws in the 12th Century,'' federal ethics
rules apply differently to different people, depending on whether
they serve in Congress, the executive branch, the judiciary or the
military.
   ``Some people can do things and other people can't do the same
things,'' Bell said. ``But no one knows how to act. We should get
everyone the same rules if we can.''
   ``We need a czar,'' said the panel's chairman, former federal
appellate judge Malcolm R. Wilkey, adding that some congressmen he
has consulted with made the same suggestion.
   Wilkey said the czar ``should have the authority to enforce the
rules and to give advice that's legally binding. On the
congressional side, there ought to be a similar institution, an
independent authority outside.''
   Other members compared an ethics czar's advisory function to an
Internal Revenue Service program which issues advisory letters to
businesses and individuals who request guidance on specific tax
questions that arise in situations not clearly addressed in any tax
statute.
   Bell wondered whether the military would want its own czar and
whether the House and Senate would accept the same czar.
   But later he said, ``A czar's the only way it'll ever be solved.
We need someone like Landis, with real power and prestige. It
wouldn't work if there were too many, because it wouldn't be
prestigious enough.
   ``But if there was one, you could go and get advice that would
stand up. You could get a judge to take the post; a lot of judges
would like that job.''
   Outlining the wide review to be undertaken, Wilkey said the
commission staff is preparing a chart comparing how the executive
branch, Congress and the judiciary handle the same ethical
questions. No such document now exists in the government, he said.
   ``We're not likely to come up with any brilliant new ideas,''
Wilkey said. ``This is a well-plowed field. The problem is some of
the furrows run in different directions. Maybe we can straighten
them out.''
   During an initial discussion of restrictions on government
employees who return to private enterprise, the commissioners agreed
that some version of restrictions which now apply only in the
executive branch should be extended to Congress and the judiciary.
   They agreed to study whether a one-year ban ought to be placed on
dealings by former judges with their old court, and on dealings by
former members of Congress with the chamber in which they served.
   Morton Halperin of the American Civil Liberties Union, however,
pointed out after the meeting that the federal Office of Government
Ethics has said that existing post-employment restrictions do not
apply to the president and vice president because only the
Constitution can set the qualifications for election to federal
office.
   So, Halperin said, there might be objections to applying them to
members of Congress without amending the Constitution. One panel
member, former New Mexico Sen. Harrison H. Schmitt, agreed that was
an issue the group would have to discuss further before proceeding
with this recommendation.
   The members also expressed support for allowing scientific and
technical people more latitude to give advice in their areas of
expertise than is allowed lawyers, whose work involves cases which
are usually narrower and shorter than large military procurement
efforts.
   ``The United States will build only one new class of submarine
between now and the end of the century,'' said former Undersecretary
of the Navy R. James Woolsey. He said a sonar or submarine expert in
the government could not get a job in private enterprise without
having something to do with that.
   ``If they don't know what they can discuss in the lunch room for
two years after they leave the government, they just won't come into
the government in the first place,'' Woolsey said.

<F P=106> [Report by Alessandra Longo: "That League Member is an </F>
Anti-Semite'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- As soon as the news spread, she herself 
said: "Me, speaker of the chamber of deputies? We are in the 
Lord's hands...." This was yesterday afternoon, at Montecitorio 
[Chamber of Deputies]. A somewhat flustered Irene Pivetti, 
Giorgio Napolitano's [outgoing lower house Speaker] purported 
successor, was giving the first interviews -- surely a great day 
for her, the day when the development of new events was granting 
the soap opera a place in history: 31 years old, a Catholic 
fundamentalist, first-time deputy in 1992. Here was League 
member Pivetti suddenly being raised to the highest seat, that 
of the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies. A meteoric, 
irresistible career in the second legislature. 
  Yet, some people were spoiling the party, not with the usual 
behind-the-scenes teasing and vulgarity, but with a sensitive, 
specific, extremely serious accusation: "Pivetti is an 
anti-Semite." It was being said by [Radical leader] Marco 
Pannella (who identified "anti-Semitic accents" in the newly 
nominated speaker); it was being said by [Forza Italia Deputy] 
Marco Taradash, "documents at hand"; it was being denounced by 
Democratic Alliance [AD] Republican member Luciana Sbarbati 
("among Pivetti's virtues, there is also anti-Semitism"); it was 
being asserted, indirectly, by progressive list deputies Sandra 
Bonsanti, Miriam Mafai, Luigi Manconi, and Giovanna Melandri, 
who were accusing her of fostering "a fundamentalist and 
intolerant idea of the relationship bewteen different religious 
denominations." 
  A rather unpleasant matter, on the eve of such an important 
appointment. The Jewish Youth Federation also voiced its 
protest. Suddenly, the smile on the face of Irene Pivetti, the 
"evil nun," as she is called by Michele Serra, turned into a 
grimace of annoyance and concern. The journalists pressed her, 
she had to give an answer: "Me, an anti-Semite? Political 
maneuvering, nonsense. Religion pervades my life, but it will 
not interfere in the least with my role as lower house speaker, 
which I intend to fulfill with the utmost sense of 
responsibility, giving assurances to all those involved." 
  In the meantime, her accusers did not let up, making 
remarks, 
statements, taking up positions. What did Irene Pivetti write 
in November 1992, following a raid in Rome against a number of 
Jewish-owned shops, which were branded with the star of David? 
That the events had been exaggerated for political reasons: "A 
roll of adhesive tape, a few sheets of paper with the Star of 
David printed on them, stuck on the shopwindows of a few Jewish 
shopkeepers...." Why "blow the racist hot air balloon out of all 
proportion?" In CORRIERE DELLA SERA, a concerned [journalist] 
Arrigo Levi cited the soon-to-be house speaker's analysis: "In 
our country, since the postwar period, Pivetti writes, Jews have 
always been able to preserve that racial, religious, and 
cultural minority's identity which they so treasure: marrying 
only among themselves (if practicing), considering themselves a 
people chosen by God, extending their considerable economic, 
intellectual, and political influence within the community...." 
  Among the spoilsports, Marco Taradash brought up an old 
question: Did his deputy colleague remember referring to a 
"Jewish Freemasonry" in relation to a list of Italian citizens 
who were considered anti-Semites, a list in which she was 
herself included, "in black and white?" No, in response to this 
specific question, the deputy said she did not remember: "Did I 
speak of a Jewish Freemasonry? One should look at the 
context...." 
  That would be enough to make anyone's nerves crack, but not 
those of Napolitano's successor -- icy stare, Vandee 
[18th-century Catholic monarchist opposition to French 
revolutionary forces] cross round her neck. Speaker of the 
house at 31, with Forza Italia's and National Alliance's [AN] 
blessing; she, Algo Bagrielli's granddaughter, curator of her 
grandfather's dictionary; she, CEI [Italian Bishops' Conference] 
and Ruini's passionate enemy; she, the bandwagon's [League 
nickname] runaway horse, that only [League secretary] Bossi can 
rein in ("I owe him everything, I owe him the fact that I 
engaged in politics, I would never criticize his decisions....") 
-- she is just one step away from a miracle; we will see what 
happens today. 
  What can she do if journalists insist on this anti-Semitism 
story. The deputy goes her way and, " knife in mouth" (one of 
her expressions), upholds her ideas. She tore to bits Law 194 
on abortion ("but it is a state law and must be implemented, 
particularly the part fostering contraception"); had something 
conceited to say about [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi 9 
[outgoing lower house Speaker] ("a lucky man, who is also 
showing he is a good politician"); drew a distinction when it 
came to the latter's TV networks ("He cannot get rid of them in 
15 days. The essential thing is that he serve the country's 
interests"); made a noncommital remark about Mussolini, in line 
with an irrepressible instinct for appeasement ("whether for 
better or worse, he made part of this country's history"). 
<H5>  Ironical Colleagues Consider Her a "Doll" </H5>
  Here are some reactions to League Catholic member Irene 
Pivetti's nomination as speaker of the lower house: Alfredo 
Biondi (Center Union): "Me, deputy speaker? With a speaker who 
is not absolutely below standard, in fact with a high-quality 
one, I might agree. I am thinking of Iotti, Napolitano, or 
Rodota, but I have no intention of being an employee, a civil 
servant, giving lessons to kids or...dolls." Later Biondi 
explained that he was joking with some friends when a journalist 
overheard these comments and published them. 
  Massimo Scalia (Greens): "For thousands of years we Romans 
have been used to tolerance and to history's vicissitudes. Ever 
since Caligula nominated a horse as senator, nothing surprises 
us any more." 
  Rocco Buttiglione (Italian Popular Party): "I am very much 
in favor. It will raise the institutions' esthetic standards. 
It will help us bear the incredible boring sessions in store 
for us. This, however, is not enough to become the speaker of 
the house. I am very much afraid I cannot give her my vote." 
  Vittorio Sgarbi (Forza Italia): "Pivetti for speaker of the 
house? I would also have nominated her. I cannot imagine a 
more representative and appropriate personality: We move from 
the contemplation of the Madonna [reference to President 
Scalfaro's frequent references to the Virgin Mary] to the 
Madonna herself."

FT  20 APR 94 / Arts: Star turns and preposterous poses - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In times of national decline and international horror it is tempting to
brood on what we still excel at. The performing arts have been Britain's
great success story since the war, and the past week has provided nicely
contrasting reminders of recent glories in the field.
Omnibus (BBC1) celebrated Sir John Gielgud's 90th birthday with fascinating
archive film, professional and personal testimonials, and presentation by
Kenneth Branagh who modestly spoke of 'sharing the stage with a living
legend' in tones that suggested it takes one to know one. A virtual history
of modern British theatre emerged - West End, Coward, Old Vic, Stratford,
modernity at the Royal Court, not to mention increasing film work from the
1960s and TV commercials for Paul Masson wine. No mention of the
preposterous Caligula, though a glimpse of fashionable intellectual kitsch
from Peter Greenaway, with its splashy nudity, oddly resembled what one had
heard of the Playboy dip into high culture. Throughout, Sir John was urbane
and mischievously self-deprecating, charmingly illustrating Irene Worth's
verdict that 'he takes us as we are'. Our good fortune is that he gives as
well.
How different, how very different, from Omnibus's tribute to Joan Littlewood
a week later. Miriam Karlin's 'You love the woman but you can't bloody well
trust her' was a not untypical judgment. Littlewood, a pug-faced gnome in a
peaked cap, was equally affectionate towards old colleagues, 'that bugger'
Richard Harris and 'silly bitch' Barbara Windsor. And that was just the
people she liked.
Littlewood contributed more than mere direction to the triumphs of the East
End-based Theatre Workshop. A Taste of Honey, The Quare Fellow, The Hostage:
'If anyone wrote them, it was Joan,' declared an actor still bemused after
30 years. Her contempt for writers could be fruitful. Lionel Bart cackled
his way through the unexpurgated 'Fings ain't wot they used t' be',
originally the complaint of out-of-work tarts. Nemesis struck when
Littlewood 'tore up the script' in rehearsals of Twang], the sumptuously
financed West End musical on Robin Hood, longing to return to 'a dozen
actors and a few old props'. Disaster resulted.
Devised and produced by John Hough, directed by Alan Lewens, the totally
gripping programme evoked the bumpy exhilaration of working with this
maddening woman, unpredictable even in her non-conformism (decrying Peter
Brook's 'old art stuff', disowning the class struggle: 'I didn't like any
bloody class; just people with talent'). 'You have to be ruthless,' she
claimed; but rehearsed in pink light that caressed her actors. 'I loved
them, the bastards. I never told them so.' Ruthless, my eye. There's a softy
underneath. We were mad to exile her to France.
The Frost Programme (ITV) trotted out Sir Anthony Hopkins, preceded by
dreadful jokes delivered on glazed-eyed autopilot by Frost, sagging and
crumpled like an empty glove puppet. Hopkins was genuinely nice and nicely
genuine, faintly embarrassed at his host's remorseless prompting to
anecdotal luvviness. 'An audition with Olivier?' Frost nudged knowingly as
the thesp took on a hunted look. 'You're on the most - fantastic - roll,'
groped the international wordsmith, even venturing an artistic opinion on
Hopkins' latest film: 'It's doing fantastic business.' Of such aesthetic
values are media moguls made.
The craft was seen in practice in BBC 2's Screen Two 'by the award-winning
writer David Livingstone', according to a more than usually vacuous-sounding
continuity announcer who presumed wrongly. Had Return to Blood River been
written by the sage of Blantyre instead of mere Douglas Livingstone it might
have generated an atmosphere more redolent of Africa than North Peckham. The
timely story of a white liberal Afrikaner returning home after years in
England to take up his murdered father's business ultimately wasted a
promising situation. A case of double-bluff - the honourable black was in
fact guilty - copped out with a melodramatic ending and sketchy
characterisation. Lavishly cast, it also wasted some fine actors, notably
Barbara Jefford, reduced to a baleful presence; Frances Barber, alternately
radiant and blazingly angry; and Warren Clarke's leeringly genial, racist
Boer.
We may be good at acting but in recent years British architecture and
life-style leave something to be desired. Such is the message of the
three-part Heaven, Hell and Suburbia (C4) which kicked off with an ominously
heavy-handed fantasy for the opening credits. Presenter Jonathan Glancey has
the boyish, whimsical look of a young Tom Stoppard, but his loonier flights
are intended seriously.
Suburbia can mean many things: villages swallowed up by the city (Hampstead,
Chelsea), self-contained areas retaining their identity in a metropolitan
context (Kew, Richmond), or such great developments away from the city
centre as Edinburgh's New Town or Bristol's Clifton and Hotwells. The
director Bob Bee should have asked hard questions about definition. But it
transpires that Glancey has it in for Metroland and its descendants.
Stunningly commonplace observations on mock-Tudor alternated with strange
obiter dicta like 'stained glass speaks of cosiness and crumpets for tea' (I
shall look at Chartres Cathedral with new eyes).
Glancey commented on sundry English characteristics like suburban DIY while
forgetting that most English of all characteristics, sneering at things
English. He seemed amazed that people chose to move from the city and
outraged that they should 'want to be with their own kind,' adding 'and
that's what they get' in tones that implied bubonic plague. As one who has
been robbed once at knifepoint and once at gunpoint in front of my South
London front door, I could enlighten him.
The pleasant, aesthetically unremarkable inhabitants of pleasant,
aesthetically unremarkable homes in both England and America spoke of
escaping vandalism, crime, violence and fear, but Glancey steamrolled on
regardless.
A colleague was recently ejected from a press gathering for the South Bank
Show starring Dawn French for representing a magazine that had been less
than positive about Ms French's Murder Most Horrid. Fearful of offending
television's PR boys and girls, I shall consider my words carefully before
pronouncing last Sunday's SBS (ITV) interminably witless, repetitive,
cliche-ridden and self-indulgent. An alleged blow for the bigger woman (Ms
French is generously built), it wheeled out all the old observations on the
disadvantages of being a big girl today when the ideal is anorexic
willowiness, though a woman who, like La French, aligns herself with Marilyn
Monroe and Olympic athletes among others does not seem to have any problems
with self-confidence. Rubens was mentioned, Camille Paglia theorised, Jo
Brand told jokes, a war artist fresh from Bosnia conceded that painting Ms
French was 'a total change', and a fashion photographer waxed historical on
fleshy ladies with 'they wore tents in those days . . . In modern words,
there was a lot of celluloid there.'
There was a lot of celluloid here too; I had to pinch my cellulose to keep
awake. Dawn French posed for photographs in the style of old masters, was
reduced to a flurry of glottal stops at her (imagined) nude portrait while
Britten's Midsummer Night's Dream played in the background, whether
identifying the reclining actress with Titania or Bottom I am unsure.
It is surely time the South Bank Show gave up pretensions to being an arts
programme. These are few enough, and likely to get fewer; their precious
space must not be squandered on woolly-minded superficiality calculated to
show merely that even if opera singers are no longer fat, prima donnas still
are.

<HEAD>Swaggart Calls Penthouse Story `Diabolical'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN SAYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart has
accused Penthouse magazine of trying to destroy his ministry through
a ``diabolical and slanderous'' story in which a stripper says she
performed sexual acts for him.
   The stripper's employer labeled the woman's allegations, detailed
in the magazine's current issue, ``a pornographic fairy tale.'' As
Swaggart threatened to file a libel suit Monday, the magazine said
it was standing by its article.
   The allegations by the woman, Catherine Mary Kampen, are similar
to those levied last year by a prostitute, Debra Murphree. Those
allegations led to Swaggart's ouster from the Assemblies of God, a
Pentecostal denomination, and a major downturn in the fortunes of
Jimmy Swaggart World Ministries.
   ``There is not one shred of truth to these allegations. I have
never met or seen the woman,'' Swaggart said at a news conference at
his ministry headquarters.
   ``Our attorneys learned of this fraudulent story in December and
had clearly shown Penthouse and its porno writer, Art Harris (the
author), that the story was untrue,'' Swaggart said. ``We now know
that they already knew and did not care that it was a lie.''
   Penthouse spokesman Sy Presten issued a statement for publisher
Bob Guccione saying the magazine stood behind the story.
   ``The fact that she was with Swaggart has been corroborated by
her husband and others in Louisiana,'' the statement said. ``The
things she reports Swaggart made her do are very similar to the
story of Debra Murphree ... which have never been contradicted.''
   Kampen, 38, was quoted in Penthouse as saying Swaggart gained her
trust with his counseling, then emotionally manipulated her into
acting out sexual fantasies.
   She was reported to be in New York for promotional appearances
about the article and could not be reached for additional comment.
   Rhonda Shear, co-owner of ``Hot Lines,'' a strip-tease telegram
service that employs Kampen in New Orleans, said her sister, Nona,
told her that Kampen made up the story after seeing the Penthouse
account of Murphree's relations with Swaggart.
   ``She told my sister it was all concocted,'' Shear said in a
telephone interview from Los Angeles. ``She saw the issue with Debra
Murphree (and said) ... `It's only a matter of time before someone
jumps on that band wagon. Why not me?' ... She said it was foolproof
if she said it happened at her house.''
   Shear's sister, contacted in New Orleans, said a lawyer had
advised her not to comment. She refused to confirm her sister's
story.
   At the news conference, Swaggart accused Penthouse of conspiring
to destroy his ministry and asked for public support.
   ``I am appealing to the American people, and especially the
Christians, to help us by letting the pornographers know they have
filled this land with their filth far too long. There seems to be no
end to their diabolical slander.''
   Attorney Dennis Brewer, a member of the ministries' board of
directors, said Monday that a lawsuit would be filed within the next
few days in Texas, where punitive damages are permitted in libel
actions.
   Last February, Swaggart confessed to an undisclosed sin, and
Murphree said she had been paid by the evangelist to perform sex
acts while he watched. Swaggart later was defrocked by the
Assemblies of God after refusing to step down from the pulpit for at
least a year.
   The furor resulted in the cancellation of Swaggart's programs
from three major cable television networks, an exodus of students
and faculty from his Bible college and layoffs from the ministry, a
major Baton Rouge employer.

   Fawn Hall and Donna Rice didn't. Paula Parkinson,
Jessica Hahn, Rita Jenrette and Debra Murphree did.
   Getting scandal-entangled women to bare all is a major coup for
men's magazines, which pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to
titillate.
   Besides dangling six-figure fees, such magazines as Playboy and
Penthouse wine and dine these formerly obscure women and offer the
promise of nationwide publicity. The reason is simple: scandal
sells.
   ``Women, or even men who are at the center of a storm, of any
kind, are always best-sellers,'' said Penthouse publisher Bob
Guccione.
   When Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle was chosen as the Republican vice
presidential candidate, Penthouse and Playboy rushed to resurrect
features on Paula Parkinson, the comely blond lobbyist who
accompanied Quayle and two other politicians on a golf outing eight
years ago.
   Playboy's November issue includes new coments from Parkinson,
claiming Quayle propositioned her on the Florida weekend, and a
nude photograph of Parkinson taken in 1980.
   Penthouse's story, also for November, includes fresh remarks
from a 1981 interview about an alleged dalliance with Rep. Jack
Kemp, R-N.Y., as well as statements about Quayle.
   ``The idea behind this is to get somebody who's in the public
eye ... and show something about that person that you can't find
any place else,'' said Nat Lehrman, a former Playboy publishing
executive and now chairman of Columbia College's journalism school
here.
   Jessica Hahn, the former church secretary whose sexual encounter
with Jim Bakker led to the PTL evangelist's downfall last year, got
her second Playboy feature in the September issue.
   Her first spread appeared in Playboy's November 1987 issue,
featuring several nude photographs and Hahn's version of what
happened with Bakker. The issue sold more than 5 million copies at
newsstands, about 1.5 million more than usual.
   Hahn contends Penthouse offered her $12 million to appear. She
chose instead to tell her story to Playboy for a rumored $1 million.
   ``Playboy approached me and Penthouse (too) pretty much when the
story broke,'' Hahn, 29, said in a telephone interview from
Phoenix, where she's working in radio.
   Penthouse, she said, ``was making a lot of promises that they
could not keep. The money was endless. I mean it was ridiculous.''
   Playboy contends Hahn and an agent first approached the
magazine, which Hahn denies. Regardless of who made the first move,
Playboy acknowledges she was a big catch.
   ``If there is another magazine out there that we feel
competitive with ... we try to get our offer on the table first,
and I think there was probably some of that that went on with
Jessica Hahn,'' said Jeff Cohen, managing photo editor for Playboy.
   Penthouse struck it rich with its July issue, featuring the
woman at the center of the scandal involving televangelist Jimmy
Swaggart. The magazine includes explicit photos of Debra Murphree
showing the things she contends Swaggart asked her to do in a motel
room.
   The Murphree issue sold out in five days, selling more than 4
million copies, double the normal newsstand sales, according to
Penthouse officials.
   Guccione and an attorney for Murphree declined to reveal how
much she was paid, but it was rumored to be $75,000 to $100,000.
   Murphree, jailed in Louisiana on an unrelated prostitution
charge, was not available for comment. Her attorney Tom Weymann,
explained her motivation.
   ``Primarily, she was trying to get out of the life that she had
found herself in. There was the motivation of not only the money,
but also to set the record straight of exactly what happened,'' he
said.
   Scandals, especially those involving sex, are guaranteed hits
for magazines because the public wants ``to see the naked woman who
played Delilah to whatever Samson of the moment,'' said Barry
Blackman, a New York photographer. Blackman's photographs of
Elizabeth Ray, the non-typing secretary and ex-mistress of former
Ohio Rep. Wayne Hayes, wound up in Hustler magazine.
   Nude photos of Ray also appeared in Penthouse and Playboy.
   But capitalizing on scandals can be tricky, said Nancie S.
Martin, editor in chief of Playgirl magazine. ``You have to get to
people at the right time. You have to pay them a lot of money. You
have to hope it's still a scandal when the magazine comes out.
   ``There's always the concern that it might be exploitive, that
you might be taking somebody involved in a sex scandal and giving
them more limelight than they deserve,'' she said.
   Often, posing nude is a way for women linked to scandal to
create or advance careers, said Martin. But why would someone like
Rita Jenrette, ex-wife of former South Carolina Congressman John
Jenrette, want to bare her body to millions?
   ``I thought it would be a hoot, a funny thing to do,'' said
Jenrette, 38, who appreared in Playboy in April 1981 after her
husband's bribery and conspiracy conviction in the FBI Abscam
investigation.
   ``People caught in the midst of turmoil, you do a lot of
uncharacteristic things,'' said Jenrette, now living in New York
and pursuing an acting career. ``I never anticipated the
criticism.''
   She said a Washington reporter and his wife persuaded her to
pose, and Playboy says it willingly agreed.
   ``There is a curiosity about these people that the other news
media pick up. Rita Jenrette was everywhere,'' Cohen said. ``(But)
we had her story, and we had glamorous nude photographs of her.''
   The issue featuring Jenrette sold a little more than 6.2 million
copies, more than a million over normal sales of the time.
   ``It was one of our biggest sellers,'' Cohen said.
   Jenrette says she doesn't think Playboy exploited her troubles
to make a buck.
   As far as men's magazines making money off the scandal, she
said, ``What else is there? It sells. ... The sensational grabs
people.''
   That's why Playboy and Penthouse, offering six-figure payoffs,
hotly pursued Donna Rice, whose relationship with former Colorado
Sen. Gary Hart doomed his presidential hopes, and Fawn Hall, the
blond National Security Council secretary who helped Oliver North
shred and alter documents about arms deals in the Iran-Contra
scandal.
   ``Donna Rice I think we were close to making a deal with at one
point,'' said Playboy's Cohen. ``Nudity was discussed. She just
walked away from it. There were several conversations with her,
lunches ... but no deal was made. Why she turned us down, I don't
know. ...
   ``Fawn Hall ... would have certainly been a cover (story), would
have sold well,'' Cohen said.
   Playboy would not disclose their offers, but Guccione said
Penthouse offered Rice about $350,000 and Hall $250,000 ``because
anybody in the country would want to read'' about them.
   Hall's attorney, Plato Cacheris, said he understood the interest
in his client.
   But ``the money did not tempt her,'' he said. ``She's too much
of a lady ... and she's not going to try to capitalize in any
unseemly way.''
   Rice could not be reached and her Miami attorney, Thomas
McAliley was vacationing and unavailable to explain why she
rejected the offers.
   Should she or Hall have second thoughts, it may be too late.
   ``The timing is all-important,'' said Cohen. ``Right now, I
don't think either of them have much value.''

   The devil is alive and well, hustling suckers in
a cheap bar on Nashville's Music Row. But he meets his match in
Billy Markham, something of a hustler himself, willing to risk
everything on the throw of the dice.
   Their contest for Billy's body and soul is recounted with
rip-snorting, raunchy delight in ``The Devil and Billy Markham,''
one half of a hilarious double bill entitled ``Oh, Hell,'' which
opened Sunday at the Mitzi Newhouse Theater in Lincoln Center.
   Shel Silverstein wrote the Billy Markham saga, and David Mamet
contributed the second part of the evening, called ``Bobby Gould in
Hell,'' which also features a highly unusual and comic Lucifer.
   Silverstein's play is a monologue, a tall tale told in verse by
actor Dennis Locorriere, a one-time member of the rock group Dr.
Hook. Looking like a refugee from the California Gold Rush,
Locorriere _ all shaggy hair and wild beard _ acts, sings and
dances his way through Billy's various bouts with the devil and God
Himself. It's a pheonomenal performance, not to mention a feat of
prodigious memorization.
   Silverstein, poet, cartoonist and author of the country hit ``A
Boy Named Sue,'' tweaks just about everybody in his short play. Its
highlight is a song about the marriage of the devil to Billy's one
true love. The celebrity list runs from Gertrude Stein to Grandma
Moses, from Caligula to Eva Braun. For Silverstein, the devil
appears to be a part of just about everybody.
   In Mamet's equally brief one-acter, the devil _ called the
interrogator _ harasses a new arrivee named Bobby Gould in an
anteroom to hell that looks like a well-appointed study. It's
complete with a spiffy leather couch and walls of books. Only when
he opens a backdoor can you hear the screams and see the smoke of
Hades.
   Bobby, played with credible anxiety by Treat Williams, keeps
insisting he was a good man. Not so, says the devil. ``You were
cruel without being interesting,'' says Satan, portrayed here by an
exasperated, almost frenzied W.H. Macy. The actor is dressed like a
walking advertising for the L.L. Bean catalog. You see, Lucifer has
been called back from a fishing trip to deal with Bobby and is
mighty upset about the interruption.
   Bobby's spurned girlfriend (Felicity Huffman) also shows up to
condemn him, and the devil has a drudge assistant, played with a
wonderful prissy rectitude by Steven Goldstein, to further browbeat
the man.
   The pingpong banter is sharp, often quite biting, and the
production is tauntly directed by Gregory Mosher who uses several
startling theatrical effects.
   ``The Devil and Billy Markham'' and ``Bobby Gould in Hell''
don't exactly celebrate Beelzebub but they recognize his effect on
what people say and do. And what they say and do, according to
Silverstein and Mamet, is very, very funny.

<HEAD>Stripper Who Made Allegations Against Swaggart Has History of Minor
Arrests</HEAD>

   Officials confirmed Tuesday that the woman who
claims in Penthouse magazine that she performed sexual acts for
television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart has a string of arrests in the
New Orleans area.
   Swaggart's attorneys distributed documents showing that Catherine
Mary Kampen had been arrested in Orleans, Jefferson and St. Bernard
parishes on various charges, including theft and issuing bad checks.
   The documents were distributed at a news conference Monday during
which Swaggart vehemently denied knowing Kampen and threatened to
sue the magazine.
   Kampen, a 38-year-old stripper, claims in the March issue of
Penthouse that she was Swaggart's ``sex slave'' for six months. The
magazine quotes Kampen as saying Swaggart demanded that she perform
sadomasochistic and degrading acts.
   Swaggart was defrocked by the Assemblies of God last year and saw
his international ministries rocked by allegations that he paid a
New Orleans prostitute to perform sex acts for him. He confessed at
that time to an unspecified sin but never discussed the accusations
made by the prostitute, Debra Murphree.
   On Monday, Swaggart accused Penthouse of trying to destroy his
ministry through a ``diabolical and slanderous'' story.
   ``Feel free to publish anything you like,'' Swaggart warned the
magazine at a news conference Monday, ``but be prepared to back it
up in court.''
   Penthouse Publisher Bob Guccione said in a statement Monday that
he stood behind the story.
   Penthouse spokesman Sy Presten said the terms of Kampen's
contract with the magazine prevented her from talking to the press,
but ``we're working on setting up a press conference next week.''
   Kampen's arrest record is mentioned in passing in the Penthouse
article. Art Harris, who wrote the piece, said the arrests were
minor.
   ``You wouldn't expect someone who got into this situation to have
the background of a nun,'' he said Tuesday.
   Harris refused to comment on charges by Ronda Shear, co-owner of
the strip-tease telegram service that employs Kampen, that the woman
had concocted the story after seeing a Penthouse story on Murphree.
   According to records distributed by Swaggart's lawyers, Kampen
was arrested in Jefferson Parish on Dec. 30, 1986, and charged with
criminal damage to property and theft of under $100. Kampen was
convicted and paid a $200 fine and court costs, said Linda Simpson
of the district attorney's office.
   On Aug. 17, 1973, Kampen was arrested and charged with issuing
worthless checks in St. Bernard Parish. She was given one year's
probation and fined $40.
   Kampen was arrested in New Orleans on Jan. 10, 1972, under the
name of Cathy M. Smith, and charged with using a stolen driver's
license and forged receipt to get $53 from a department store. Court
records confirm she was fined $100 and received a suspended
six-month jail sentence.

The Importance of Being O'Toole

By Robert Goldberg</HL>
<DD> 04/21/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After just three minutes in Peter O'Toole's midtown hotel suite, I was sure I had wandered into a scene from "My Favorite Year." 
I hadn't even gotten off a single question when the Irish actor decided we must have lunch, and swept us off to the dining room downstairs. 
En route, he paused to gallantly kiss the hands of women, sing calypso ditties with the elevator man, and pound actor Denholm Elliott mightily on the arm. 
"Good man, good man," he exclaimed, then threw back his head to give a mighty laugh. 

   Here was the great O'Toole, a lion of an actor, looking a little wobbly in the best John Barrymore tradition, and just as impossibly charming as his screen presence. 
"I would kill for coffee," he proclaimed as we sat down. 
Gazing regally around the room, he planted a Gauloise in a long black cigarette holder and puffed away. 

   At 54, Peter O'Toole is a man so outsized, so larger-than-life, that for all his mannerisms, for all his affectations, you have to like him. 
And though he looks a good decade older -- in fact, he looks like death warmed over -- still, he has style. 

   Polished, witty, well-read, Mr. O'Toole is a great, rambling conversationalist, a raconteur who touches on Confucius and cricket, van Gogh and early Anglo-Saxon poetry. 
Then too, his voice is a wonderful instrument -- cultured and resonant, with just a hint of irony. 
Even when he orders his roast-beef sandwich, it sounds thrilling; Mr. O'Toole doesn't just talk, he offers his words like presents, gift-wrapped. 
"Superb," he says through clenched teeth, exploding the second syllable. 
"Ab-so-lute-ly su-perb." 

   With Peter O'Toole, everything is a story, including why he happens to be in New York, rehearsing for Sunday night's opening of George Bernard Shaw's "Pygmalion" at the Plymouth Theatre. 
"Well, actually," he says, "It was a complete shock. 
I was in China, acting in Bertolucci's new film {"The Last Emperor in China"}. 
I walked into a telex room in Peking to send off a message and my eye fell on a telex addressed to me. 
It was obviously the last of a series of messages addressed to me. 
I had never gotten any of them. 'Only two days left to make up your mind on the rights to "Pygmalion,"' it said. 
Two days? 
So I sent back 'Get it.' 
If I hadn't gone into that telex room . . ." . . . 
He wouldn't be about to open on Broadway. 

   For Mr. O'Toole, the chance to play in "Pygmalion" -- Shaw's 1913 play about a professor who tries to transform a flower girl into a duchess -- is a special treat: "I love Shaw. 
I love the musicality of the speech -- the disarming naturalness in the middle of dense argued rhetoric, the tomfooleries amongst the deathly chilling seriousnesses." 

   This stage appearance (as Professor Henry Higgins to Amanda Plummer's Eliza Doolittle) follows several recent screen roles ("Creator," "Club Paradise"). 
"I'm seldom away from the stage for very long," Mr. O'Toole says. 
"I love all of it, screen and stage, but you do need the audience. 
They tell you how you're doing -- how to go quicker, how to go slower, how to make them laugh, how to affect them. 
You need an audience to nourish you." 

   Strangely enough, this "Pygmalion" is Mr. O'Toole's Broadway debut. 
It's a new beginning of sorts for an actor whose credits number more than 30 screen roles and 60 stage appearances, whose career is a relief map of pinnacles and valleys. 

   Born in Connemara in the northwest of Ireland, Mr. O'Toole grew up an immigrant in England in the seedy industrial streets of Leeds, where his father was a race-track bookie. 
Young Peter was terrible at school, obsessed by sports -- swimming, running and especially rugby ("It was my dream to wear the green for Ireland"). 
He tried various odd jobs -- journalism, photography and a two-year stint in the navy -- before settling on acting. 
Legend has it that it was a performance by Sir Michael Redgrave as King Lear that made up his mind. 

   "This much is sure," says Mr. O'Toole with a smile. 
"I was bumming around with a friend and we blew our last shillings to see Michael -- and he was mighty. 
We had to spend that night in a haystack. 
At least, we though it was a haystack," he chuckles. 
"It turned out to be a dung heap." 

   At the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, he undertook the rigorous training in speech and movement alongside Alan Bates, Albert Finney and many other great actors of his generation. 
Upon graduation, he was one of 400 to try out for the classical repertory company at the Bristol Old Vic (the farm team for the Old Vic), and the only one to get a contract. 

   "To this day, I still don't believe it happened," he says. 
"There are many, many highs in a life, but there's nothing I cherish more than walking down the cobbled lane at the Theatre Royal Bristol for the first time, and entering the stage door, shaking like an aspen leaf." 

   Of course, there followed a series of stage and screen roles that are now well known: the first triumph in David Lean's sage "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962), the string of '60s and '70s successes in "Becket," "Lord Jim," "The Lion in Winter," "Goodbye Mr. Chips," "The Ruling Class," and "Man of La Mancha." 
Each year produced a new, improved O'Toole, more emotionally powerful, more wickedly funny. 

   But in the mid-1970s, as he turned 40, everything began to crumble around the actor -- he had to cope with a severe drinking problem, physical illnesses and operations, not to mention a divorce. 
In short, like Kean and Barrymore, he imploded. 
"The age of 40 comes along and says, 'Hello sweetheart, how much more of this can you take?'" 
Mr. O'Toole shrugs ruefully. 
"The 40s are a tough time for anybody. 
It's a time of great change. 
You either come to terms with your age or you don't. 
I just turned it inwards." 

   Scraping bottom, he decided to begin again: "I went back to Ireland, to Connemara. 
I built a house, I planted lots of trees, I laid sewer pipes. 
I did absolutely nothing for a year. 
Then I said, 'Right. 
What'll you do next?' 
And everything in me screamed, 'Go home.' 
So I went back to the Bristol Old Vic and signed on again in rep. 
It was important to touch home again. 
Surely you understand?" 

   The past 10 to 15 years have not been overly kind to Peter O'Toole. 
On the stage, the "Macbeth" he mounted in London was termed, by one English critic, "the worst Shakespearean disaster since the burning of the Globe." 
On the screen, he acted in his share of (as he puts it) "rubbish": "Rosebud," "Caligula" and "Creator." 
"Look," he says. 
"There's rent to be paid and food to be bought, so don't ask me any silly questions. 
It's very nice to be able to pick and choose . . . but there are fewer and fewer good scripts going around today." 

   And yet, just when Mr. O'Toole was being consigned to the oblivion of faded thespians, he bounced back. 
In two impressive films in the early 1980s -- "The Stunt Man" and "My Favorite Year" -- he reminded his critics just how skilled he is. 
The blend of comedy and raw irony was especially moving in "My Favorite Year," in which Mr. O'Toole played an actor battling the bottle and a self-destructive urge. 

   "After I build something," the actor once said, back in the 1960s, "I knock it down -- just for the hell of it." 
Most actors get one good career if they're lucky. 
Mr. O'Toole has built and knocked down several. 
And yet, he seems to be building again, reconstructing the great O'Toole. 

   Unlike Sir Laurence Olivier or Sir John Gielgud, master craftsmen, flawless and precise, Mr. O'Toole is an epic actor, an actor who, from "Lawrence of Arabia" on, has always succeeded with outrageous panache and failed with huge, sloppy gestures. 

   Just look at him now, sitting in the corner booth with his green corduroy suit and his pink-and-green tie. 
Just look at the long black cigarette holder. 
Just listen to the way he talks about van Gogh (and his "great silly sunflower"), or sunrise on the Gobi Desert, or theater history ("Sir John" this and "Sir Kenneth" that). 
You simply have to like the guy. 
I'd like to see him do Lear. 
The mad king -- immensely powerful yet so self-destructive, so self-indulgent you want to shake him by the shoulders and say "Look, you've got this whole great kingdom here, don't be a fool, don't throw it away."

FT  13 NOV 93 / Fashion: The designer muzzle, it's a must - Critics face
unfair pressure from peevish couture houses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STARS and the press pushed through the foyer of the Ritz and converged
on the ballroom, converted by Versace into a polystyrene and cardboard
mock-up of Caligula's palace for his 'couture' show. Push, shove, yell:
'Look, Madonna]' Scratch, elbow: 'Polanski]' Barge, plead: 'Elton]'
The uninvited were sequestered outside, along with Suzy Menkes of the
International Herald Tribune. She was banned by Versace and Ferre at Dior
for criticising their previous collections. Like peevish children, designers
will not admit unmuzzled writers for fear of . . . what? The truth? Banning
is nothing new - Chanel loved to oust trouble-makers - but it is now
commonplace as designers try to control what is written about them. Come in
if you will write a eulogy, stay out if you really intend to exercise your
professional rights as a critic. One minute, they are chasing journalists to
boost scent, hosiery and boutique sales, the next they cold-shoulder a
dissenting voice.
In the days when the publicity-shy Cristobal Balenciaga failed to issue an
invitation, journalists might be furious - but they could not accuse him of
fawning over them one moment and rejecting them the next. His manner was
consistently distanced and, therefore, professional.
Now, press / designer relations have reached comic extremes. Any semblance
of propriety or subtlety has been jettisoned. Its quid pro quo: write a good
feature and your office or home turns into a funeral parlour; you cannot see
the desk for the blooms. Write a criticism and you are persona non grata.
Change your mind next season and everything is blooming marvellous again.
One pre-requisite in this industry is a short memory.
Shamefully, the press does, with some exceptions, buckle under the pressure
of fashion empires, especially when the Italians start ganging up. The next
season, the designer's handwriting might not have changed but the
journalist's reading of it certainly has.
The problem is that fashion and beauty writers are offered sweeteners:
discounted clothes, a momentary glance into the high life, and so on.
Judgment is clouded, opinions become bias. Guffaws could be heard from New
York to Tokyo when a television expose of the industry, The Look, filmed
interviews with editors denying they were ever given gifts.
Some opinion-formers stand their ground. Consider the case of Women's Wear
Daily and designer Geoffrey Beene. When WWD sent an assistant rather than
John Fairchild, the chairman, to view a show, Beene took umbrage. The
magazine retaliated; as far as it was concerned, Beene no longer existed. He
was ignored and even air-brushed out of photographs.
Beene can get terribly peevish. When Kennedy Fraser criticised not only his
collection but his design direction in the New Yorker in the 1970s, she was
banned for several seasons. But Fraser, no pedestrian critic, not only
pointed out the faults but also constructively offered an alternative
course. Beene later re-considered his impetuous snub and now acknowledges
publicly his debt to Fraser for changing the path of his design - for the
better.
In many ways, the press is to blame for the antics of designers, having
built them into gods who are invited to pontificate not only on what we
should wear next season but also on how we should lead our lives. Endless
profiles have accorded dress-makers the role of pop-philosophers. Should we
really be so amazed that Benetton has the hubris to 'educate' us about Aids
while advertising its jerseys?
London is the bottom of the rung as far as the Milan / Paris / New York
collections' status is concerned, for none of its designers has a big
advertising budget. Perhaps it is a cynical view but one wonders why British
fashion writers flex their critical muscles so energetically when reviewing
British designers. Could it be that advertising revenue will not be affected
while, having felt frustratingly muzzled in the other capitals, they let rip
in London? It is little wonder that the British designers complain that the
British press do not support them.
Non-fashion journalists have viewed the fashion press askance for some time.
This attitude hardened late in the 1960s when the counter-culture
journalists were trying to taking on the Establishment and ask difficult
questions.
The more judicious news journalists were suspicious of the fashion editor /
designer symbiosis in the glossy 1960s colour supplements. But the rot
really set in in the 1980s when the glossies and newspapers became
style-obsessed and filled their pages with designer profiles. Now, their
Frankenstein has come home to bully them.
But informed critics - not, of course, to be confused with tabloid
sensationalists - should stand firm. A ban should be read as a badge of
integrity, proof that the journalist has spoken his or her mind (correctly
or incorrectly). Besides, designers can hardly ban everyone.
Maddening though it is, we can be thankful that fashion reporting is not as
venomous as some theatre reviewing. There is a Broadway legend of an
impresario who responded to a bad review of his play by sending the critic a
tarantula in a box. It was alive.
Perhaps we should watch out for what might lurk in those blooms.

   Latin America's Drug Barons

<LP>
   Few criminal enterprises compare with the scope and
brutality of Latin America's drug barons. They compete for
billions of dollars of profit; their death squads are
responsible for thousands of murders; and they can compromise
and thus destroy the legitimacy of entire governments.
   The most notorious drug cartels can be found in Colombia
and Mexico. Detailed accounts of each are presented in two
new books that transport us right into the belly of the
beast.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The most difficult part of any such account is separating
fact from fiction. Cunning and exaggeration are important
tools of the drug trade, and it's not hard for investigators
to get bamboozled by these hustlers. "Drug Lord: The Life of
a Mexican Kingpin" (Pharos Books, 268 pages, $18.95), by El
Paso Herald reporter Terrence E. Poppa, avoids this hazard
and is the more reliable of the two. Mr. Poppa is a
first-rate journalist who has painstakingly cross-checked the
testimony of convicted dealers, drug agents and police to
document the rise and fall one of the most notorious drug
lords, Pablo Acosta.
   Actually a Mexican-born U.S. citizen, Acosta transshipped
Colombian cocaine through his fiefdom in northern Mexico
before his 1987 death in an old-fashioned
"You'll-never-take-me-alive]" shootout with "federales." His
Mexican-U.S. smuggling ring brought 60 tons of Colombian
cocaine a year into the U.S. across the border from Mexico,
where many army garrison commanders provide dealers like
Acosta with logistical support.
   Acosta's rise from cheap crook to head of a significant
criminal empire is reminiscent of the film he loved to watch
over and over, "Scarface" in the Al Pacino version. Like
Scarface, Acosta succumbed to the product he peddled --
spending his last days freebasing cocaine 12 to 14 hours a
day, with his drug-induced paranoia finally driving
associates to betray him.
   However, though responsible for as many as 20 murders,
Acosta emerges like a gregarious figure from "The Godfather.
He was not without charm and a sense of honor. These
attributes are completely missing from the Colombian drug
lords. There, the stakes are much higher, and so is the
treachery. Acosta bitterly chastized any operatives who hurt
innocent family members, even those of his enemies. But in
the Colombian drug world, the murder of innocents has become
a preferred method of enforcement.
   In "The Man Who Made It Snow" (Simon &amp; Schuster, 304
pages, $19.95), drug dealer turned government witness Max
Mermelstein puts a fine point on these horrors: "Colombian
criminals look at a man's family as his weakness," recalls
the author. "They threaten the family first. They warn you
once, maybe twice, then they kill your family, one by one, or
all at the same time, and they do it as easily as snuffing
out a candle."
   According to the book jacket, Mr. Mermelstein was "the
American mastermind inside the Colombian cartel." In fact,
his was but one of several major smuggling pipelines from
Colombia into the U.S. But what a pipeline]
   From 1981 to the time Mermelstein was arrested in June
1985, he was personally responsible for bringing 56 tons of
cocaine into the U.S. and smuggling $300 million out. He
dealt directly with Medellin cartel leaders Fabio Ochoa,
Pablo Escobar and Rafael "Rafa" Cardona (Mermelstein's mentor
in the drug business). His testimony helped convict half a
dozen drug dons.
   Peering into the snake pit that Mr. Mermelstein once
called home is like reading an updated description of
Caligula's court in ancient Rome. The brutality of the
Colombian drug cartel went hand in hand with a life of cheap
materialism: hundred-thousand acre farms with roaming lions,
elephants and giraffes; mansions modeled on Versailles;
Porsches and Mercedes by the dozen; and an adolescent frenzy
for prostitutes and drugs. Unlike most billionaires, the
leaders of the Colombian cartel have made their megamoney in
such a short time that all things -- material and human --
have very little value.
   The problem with the book is that Mermelstein is a master
charmer and hustler who also tries to work his hustle on the
reader. This drug dealer, money launderer and accessory to
murder wants us to "understand" his position. There are the
obligatory "I was a bad, bad boy" lines. But the excuses flow
out and we are expected to take on the role of confessor for
a slick crook. Worst are his repeated claims that his
Colombian wife was responsible for getting him in the drug
business. She was, he writes, "in a strange way, the source
of all my problems. When you are married to a Colombian, you
will meet other Colombians, and the other Colombians I met
were all in the dope business."
   Still, much of Mermelstein's story is chilling -- and
grippingly told with the assistance of Robin Moore and
Richard Smitten, both seasoned writers on the drug trade.
Mermelstein offers new evidence concerning John DeLorean,
acquitted on drug trafficking charges in 1984. He claims that
his now-dead drug buddy arranged a 20-kilogram cocaine deal
for Mr. DeLorean. He also testifies about Colombian officials
on the cartel payroll, including a senator and a former
commander of the air force.
   Until drug exporting countries are able to root out
officials who offer protection to drug dealers like Acosta
and Mermelstein, the drug war is a lost cause.

Italy's Challenges in Wake of the Elections

By Antonio Martino</HL>
<DD> 07/01/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>

<DATELINE> ROME  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy's latest general elections suggest a few comments. 
More than any of the previous 10 in the past 41 years, these results pose a formidable challenge to believers in proportional representation. 
Given the multitude of parties represented, the elections do not answer the question of who should rule the country. 
The choice of the ruling coalition is made by party leaders, not the electorate. 

   More than a dozen "parties" have succeeded in getting their representatives elected. 
It's true that the three major political parties polled more than 75% of the popular vote, so that the disintegration of the Parliament concerns only a minority of the seats. 
But it is equally true that several government coalitions are theoretically possible, so that the choice of the ruling coalition will be made by the usual interparty negotiations. 
And, as for the results in terms of stability, it is doubtful the current Parliament will prove to be much more stable than the previous ones. 

   In a sense the electorate seems to have understood the problem. 
Having realized that the choice of the government is not for it to make, some people have decided to use their vote for other purposes -- voice their protest or express their wishes in general, without specific reference to the problem of who should rule the country. 

   This helps explain the election of a substantial number of "greens," several representatives of local movements advocating "autonomy" for their regions, a couple of folk singers, a comedian and a known porno star. 
Well-known and widely respected parliamentarians have not been reelected, making room for newcomers -- some of whom are rather eccentric, to say the least. 
The problem is obviously not new, witness Emperor Caligula's unsuccessful attempt to improve the quality of the Senate by nominating his horse. 

   An important political message of the election was the defeat of the Italian Communist Party, known as the PCI. 
By the standards of its electoral systems and of other political parties, it was not a gigantic loss. 
But it is something close to a catastrophe in a country where electoral outcomes are slow to change and for a party that's not used to losing votes. 
PCI lost 21 deputies and seven senators. 
Contradicting its traditional claim to be a party of the young, of the future, it lost more votes in the Chamber of Deputies, where 18 is the minimum voting age, than in the Senate, where electors have to be 21. 

   PCI received fewer votes than at any time since 1963, and the myth of its invincibility received another, possibly decisive, blow. 
Even worse was the fact that electoral results proved that PCI has no strategy whatsoever. 
Its only hopes are the mistakes of other parties. 
The possibility of a "united left" coalition, which PCI had presented as an alternative to the government, is less credible after the elections than it was before. 
The left is substantially weaker and more divided, and former Socialist Premier Bettino Craxi's goal of claiming leadership of the entire left for the Socialists seems much less utopian. 
The fate of PCI seems similar to that of declining communist parties elsewhere. 

   Another message is the increase in total votes jointly received by the five parties constituting the previous government coalition, which now can count on a larger majority in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. 
Within the coalition, the two major parties -- the Christian Democrats and the Socialists -- gained. 
This should strengthen their current leaderships. 
It is to be hoped the two leaders will abandon their personal rivalries, so the coalition can be put together again, and a new period of political stability guaranteed. 

   Political stability may be desirable or undesirable, depending on what the existing government is in fact doing. 
In totalitarian countries, for example, most of us would regard stability as a liability rather than an asset. 
So the question becomes, assuming that a stable coalition government is formed, what can Italians hope for in terms of actual policy? 
The tentative answer to such a question is unfortunately not encouraging. 
The single most important issue in Italy is the excessive size of government -- the high ratio of public spending, taxation and borrowing to national income. 
From this point of view, despite a substantial body of promises to the contrary, it is highly unlikely that the country will obtain the kind of radical reform it needs from the democratic political process alone. 

   Such pessimism is motivated by the reactions that have followed the recent revision of the national income statistics. 
The upward revision of gross domestic product (GDP) figures has made many people jump to the conclusion that public spending and taxation are not excessive, since their ratio to GDP has been reduced by the manipulation of national income statistics. 
If you can't reduce spending, but you still want to reduce the ratio of spending to GDP, all you have to do is increase the GDP figure. 
Very simple, really. 
Had this bizarre view been voiced by the usual uninformed journalists or by interested politicians, there would be no reason to worry. 
The trouble is that no less an authority than Carlo A. Ciampi, the governor of Banca d'Italia, has deemed it wise to lend credibility to such a notion. 
Mr. Ciampi's point of view is that the revision of income figures "shows" the extent of tax evasion and avoidance, and that, therefore, the reduction of the deficit must be achieved by increasing taxation. 

   Mr. Ciampi's point of view is, of course, unacceptable. 
First, it's not clear why the statistical manipulations should "prove" anything about the size of tax avoidance and evasion. 
Second, even if they did, the solution to the problem of tax evasion should be that of improving the enforcement of tax laws, not that of making everybody pay more taxes. 
Third, Mr. Ciampi should know very well that an increase in revenue does not guarantee a reduction in the deficit. 

   In fact, in the past 12 years revenue has always increased, and, with only two exceptions, spending has increased more than revenue, so that the increase in taxation has resulted in an increase, rather than a decrease, in the deficit. 
As for the two years in which spending has increased less than revenue (1976 and 1986), only 2% to 3% of the increased revenue was in fact used to reduce the deficit. 
Clearly, increasing taxation by $1 million in order to achieve a $20,000 reduction in the deficit does not seem a very efficient way to tackle the problem. 
Finally, it seems contradictory, to say the least, to worry about the size of unemployment -- and simultaneously advocate an increase in taxation. 

   No matter how unfounded Mr. Ciampi's view, however, it will provide the next government with a welcome excuse for not doing what it should do: cut spending, reduce taxation and seriously tackle the problem of the deficit. 
It is not entirely irrational to suppose that, encouraged by the peculiar logic of Mr. Ciampi and by the nationalistic euphoria over the new GDP figures, the next government will attempt to pursue the course of increasing taxation, of making revenue chase spending in the vain attempt to reduce the deficit. 
Should this happen, it is probable that further episodes of tax rebellion will have to remind the political world that even the patience of Italian taxpayers is limited.

FT  09 APR 94 / Arts: Voice of an age - Richard McClure assesses the
standing and reputation of the career of Sir John Gielgud as he approaches
his 90th birthday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MCCLURE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tributes to mark Sir John Gielgud's 90th birthday on April 14 were
frustrated last month when a campaign to have London's Apollo Theatre
renamed in his honour was rejected by its owner, Stoll Moss.
It was a rare display of dissent about the actor regarded by his many
admirers as keeper of the theatrical flame; last in that distinguished
lineage which, through his great-aunt Ellen Terry, connects him to Irving,
Kean and beyond even to Shakespeare.
The Stoll Moss controversy is a contrast to the general adulation. Only the
Queen Mother's birthday, according to one recent eulogy, prompts comparable
'gratitude and rejoicing'. Perhaps, but just as the role of the monarchy is
being questioned, Gielgud's artistic legacy surely demands more critical
appraisal.
'Times have changed,' argues Nica Burns, production director at Stoll Moss.
'I was recently negotiating for a light variety production to come to the
Apollo and was somewhat perturbed when its two young producers, one of them
under 30, told me they would take the show elsewhere if the theatre was
renamed.'
Such disrespect is uncommon among the profession's younger generation, even
though most are only familiar with Gielgud through his sometimes unwise
choice of screen appearances. While Olivier received an Oscar for Hamlet,
Gielgud won his for playing Dudley Moore's foul-mouthed valet in the
lamentable Arthur.
Too often, he has squandered his talents on a succession of dons, dukes and
other patrician bit parts, most notoriously as a senator in Penthouse Films'
soft porn Caligula. On television he has fared better. The 'doorknob face'
that Kenneth Tynan described has lately been seen assisting both Inspectors
Morse and Alleyn in the course of their inquiries, though this year
threatens the US mini-series, Scarlett, an unpromising sequel to Gone With
the Wind.
Bills must be paid, insists Gielgud, and, Lear aside, good roles for
nonagenarians are few. Tomorrow night he plays the 'foolish, fond old man'
one last time in a Radio 3 broadcast co-produced by Kenneth Branagh's now
disbanded Renaissance Theatre Company. Radio provides the perfect medium for
Gielgud's famous vocal agility. As Peter Greenaway, who directed him in
Prospero's Books in 1991, observed: 'His qualities are not physical - he has
a magnificent voice and a thinking mind.'
Tim Supple, artistic director of the Young Vic, witnessed Gielgud's
recording of the Ghost in Branagh's 1992 radio production of Hamlet. 'When
he read, a sound came from him that one just doesn't hear,' he recalls.
'It was remarkable and immediately put you in touch with the sensation in
the words, something that is not available when any modern actor speaks
text. It was an awesome feeling. One sensed there was something impenetrably
old about what was being done by him.
'It still had a magic spell but also not quite life.'
Gielgud claims to dislike what Branagh calls his 'miraculous' tones, though
he has confessed that as a youth he could make himself weep simply by
listening to his own voice. His plummy declamation and unfettered tear ducts
offer rich pickings for satirists, who also point to the taste for cravats,
the oft-repeated anecdotes and the peacocks at his Buckinghamshire home as
evidence of actorly affectation. Indeed, an earlier attempt to have the
Queen's Theatre renamed after Gielgud was dropped when a producer pointed
out it would invariably be dubbed the Old Queen's.
But if Gielgud is guilty of the self-obsession customary in actors, it
springs from commitment to his craft. Certainly, he is immersed in acting to
the exclusion of all else.
Beverley Nichols recalled a visit from Gielgud in the 1930s. 'We were
sitting around wondering whether we were all going to be swept up in the
approaching holocaust. 'Why don't you turn on the radio,' said John. 'There
isn't one,' I replied. 'Excellent news,' said John, 'because I shall be able
to listen to myself talking.' And talk, he did, brilliantly, till the small
hours - not about Hitler or Mussolini or any of the ogres haunting us, but
about the theatre, which was all he knew about or thought important in this
distracted world.'
But the mood of post war society and its theatre was out of tune with
Gielgud's often mannered style of acting. While he was collecting a
knighthood in the Coronation honours, Ionesco was dispensing with language -
the tool of Gielgud's trade - as an adequate form of communication. At the
same time, Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop was launching a working-class
assault on the genteel complacency of post-war drama, based on a physicality
which Gielgud, with his self-conscious gait, has never possessed.
'Gielgud is an Edwardian; he must still hear the echoes of Ellen Terry,'
says Littlewood. 'In that horizon which he sees and which is in his
background, I think he is superb - an opinion I don't extend to the rest of
his generation. But because old Olivier, whom I couldn't stand, did that
appalling Osborne play The Entertainer, Gielgud wanted to move into that
dubious world too.
'He asked to work with me and, although I would have loved him to play
Edward II, he didn't want to. He wanted to do something new to match Look
Back in Anger. Later, I was given free tickets to go and see him in a modern
play. I thought, 'Oh my God, he's not dressed. And where's the poetry?' I
couldn't get over it.'
However anxious to move with the times (his performances in Storey and
Pinter were much praised), Gielgud has seldom been comfortable with the
avant-garde, preferring the old school reassurance of Coward or Rattigan. He
dissuaded Alec Guinness and Ralph Richardson from acting in Waiting for
Godot and, in 1958, declined to appear in the British premiere of Endgame
('It nauseates me. I hate it and I won't play it'). He opted instead to take
his tried and tested Shakespeare readings, The Ages of Man, on a tour of
North America, a caution that has persisted into later life.
He remained rooted in the decorous conventions of half a century ago.
'What has happened in the theatre from Beckett onwards has happened without
Gielgud,' says Tim Supple. 'He has not left a legacy of breakthrough as have
directors like Peter Brook and actors like Olivier, who was dangerous and
kept on being so. One looks at Gielgud as a package of things that were
about England and about English acting. And yet when you watch him as
Clarence in Olivier's Richard III you realise he was a master. To be fair,
he delights in the radical things happening around him.'
This deference is shared by Supple's contemporary, Dominic Dromgoole,
artistic director of the Bush Theatre, who believes Gielgud should be
'cherished and revered as a sublime monument to a certain sort of theatre'.
If that sort of theatre is now ebbing away, the affection for Gielgud
endures vicissitudes of fashion. As Edgar says of Lear: 'The oldest hath
borne most; we that are young shall never see so much, nor live so long.'

   Larry Flynt offered a self-styled soldier of
fortune $1 million to kill rival sex magazine publishers Hugh Hefner
and Bob Guccione, and Frank Sinatra and Walter Annenberg,
authorities said.
   The purported hitman, Mitchell WerBell, died of a heart attack in
December 1983 about a month after Flynt gave him the check,
sheriff's Capt. Robert Grimm said Wednesday night. WerBell was in
his 60s when he died of natural causes, authorities said.
   Flynt's alleged motive was not disclosed and no charges have been
filed against him.
   Grimm told a news conference that information about the plot
turned up recently in an investigation of the 1983 murder-for-hire
slaying of New York theater producer Roy Radin, whom authorities
said was embroiled in a soured finance deal for the movie ``The
Cotton Club.''
   A former Flynt bodyguard, William Mentzer, is one of four
defendants charged in Radin's killing.
   Investigators have not interviewed the Hustler magazine publisher
and have not presented a case to the prosecutor, Grimm said. He
declined to elaborate and said Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman
Block spoke about the purported plot earlier in the day because he
had been approached by the news media.
   ``Our investigation is continuing,'' Grimm said.
   Grimm identified targets of the alleged plot as Hefner, Sinatra
and Guccione. He declined to name a fourth person targeted, but
authorities told KNBC-TV that person was Annenberg, the publishing
magnate and former ambassador.
   ``Larry Flynt one evening called an individual by the name of
WerBell to his home and allegedly offered him $1 million if he would
arrange for the death of these four individuals,'' said Block,
adding he took the matter seriously.
   ``I've been led to believe that Larry Flynt has a propensity to
try to harm people he sees as his enemies, whether (over) business
arrangements or whatever.''
   A woman at Flynt's office told The Associated Press Flynt ``just
said he doesn't make comments on trash like that.''
   WerBell was an international arms dealer who developed the MAC-10
submachine gun. He called himself a retired general of the Royal
Free Afghan Army, according to promotional material from his
Georgia-based counterterrorism firm, Sionics Inc., released by the
sheriff's department.
   Grimm displayed a photocopy of a $1 million check allegedly
signed by Flynt and made out to WerBell.
   Block said a Flynt associate immediately stopped payment on the
check so it never was negotiated.
   The year of the alleged plot, Flynt claimed to have knowledge of
videotapes purportedly showing Vicki Morgan, mistress of the late
Diners Club founder Alfred Bloomingdale, engaged in sexual antics
with Reagan administration officials.
   The tapes were never proven to exist.
   At the time, Flynt was heavily sedated with drugs to assuage pain
from wounds that left him paralyzed after a 1978 assassination
attempt during an obscenity trial in Georgia.
   Hefner, publisher of Playboy magazine, said his place on the list
was the price of celebrity. ``It's part of being famous in the later
part of the 20th century,'' he said in a statement. ``I have no
association with those who made up the list or those whose names
appear on it.''
   Guccione, publisher of Penthouse magazine, said he had been
informed about the alleged plot by a Flynt bodyguard some time ago.
   Susan Reynolds, publicist for Sinatra, said the entertainer had
no comment.
   A telephone call to Annenberg's Palm Springs home was answered by
a woman who said he was on the East Coast and wouldn't be
immediately available for comment.

LETHAL WEAPON 3 (15)MGMs West End, Odeon Marble Arch
WAITING (15) Electric, National Film Theatre
WITHOUT YOU I'M NOTHING (18) ICA
THE NEWS BOYS (PG) Odeon West End
FREDDIE AS FRO7. (U) Odeon Mezzanine
Lehal Weapon 3 is a variety show masquerading as a movie. Let us define our
terms. A movie is something that moves, both in its individual images and
its governing plot momentum. A variety show is a menu of entertainment items
composed of colourful but unrelated turns.
So here for their latest encore is that popular police double-act Riggs and
Murtaugh (Mel Gibson and Danny Glover), their comic rapport built as ever on
the tension between psychotic unpredictability (Riggs) and sciatic
middle-aged alarmism (Murtaugh).
Here, in an I-say-I-say cameo role, is Joe Pesci's Leo Getz, the comical
accountant from Lethal Weapon 2. Here, bounding in from the wings, is the
latest version of that silver-screen crowd-pleaser, the villain played by an
English actor (Stuart Wilson, following on the cloven heels of Rickman and
Hopkins).
And here is the plethora of stunt set-pieces - the freeway chase against the
traffic flow, the blown-up office block - that have no more strict narrative
relevance than 'Bring on the acrobats' at the Palladium.
This is not a criticism, it is a genial, realistic acceptance. What, after
all, does one do with a collection of familiar multicoloured balls except
find different ways to juggle with them? Mozart did this in The Marriage Of
Figaro, taking over from Rossini to give us The Barber Of Seville 2.
Shakespeare did it with Falstaff in The Merry Wives Of Windsor, alias Fatman
Returns.
What matters is the wit deployed, and Lethal Weapon 3 should send the
charabancs away happy. The plot about a homicidal drug-dealer (Wilson) and
his attention-catching outrages is no more than an excuse for another
action-and-comedy gala. And top of the bill are back-chat stars Gibson and
Glover.
Glover is the one gasping in disbelief or groaning in dismay while Gibson -
show him a blue touch-paper and he will light it - is the one going his
berserk way to demotion and back.
Wild of mane, jittery of smile and baby-blue of eyes, Gibson is the triumph
of the whole Lethal Weapon show. He is to law enforcement what Caligula was
to civil administration. Show him an unexploded bomb (scene one) and he will
tease it lovingly until it explodes. Serve him up a nice juicy suspect
(scene 22) and he will clatter him about the head first and ask questions,
if at all, later. This is the vigilante cop taken to its supra-mythic
extreme: beyond iconisation to the finer stratospheres of camp.
The film is in large part nonsense - have we tried to hide that from you?
But as a recent series of beer advertisements unlidding the dustbins of the
stars suggests, we are all fascinated by rubbish, especially when it comes
with a VIP stamp of ownership. This rubbish was directed by Richard Donner,
of The Omen, Superman and the earlier Lethal Weapons, and it was written by
Jeffrey Boam of LW 2 and Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade. Enjoy]
* * * 'Let your body rest on the clouds, let your breasts fly off into the
cosmos. . .' Thus the holistic birth adviser to her ante-natal class in
Jackie McKimmie's Waiting.
This comedy of pricked pretensions from Australia is a delight. With its
hang-loose script, home-made camerawork and cast of endearing losers - a
pregnant painter (Noni Hazlehurst) and the four women friends, plus dazed
menfolk, who crowd her battered farmhouse to await the birth - it could be a
Robert Altman film re-planted in the Antipodes.
Yet McKimmie's solidarity with her characters makes the movie more than a
multitarget satire. The bullseyes may be regularly struck: the mystic
deliriums of natural birth advisers; the hypocrisy of agitprop hobbyists
like the baby's father (Frank Whitten), fasting for freedom until his first
sight of a McDonalds; the fanaticism of career feminists, incarnated in
Fiona Press as a plump frump hoping to film the birth for a documentary
attacking the patriarchal medical profession.
But the central dilemma of surrogate motherhood - Hazlehurst is carrying the
baby for a friend who cannot have one - is explored in all its sacrificial
agony. As each character in turn is toppled from his or her high moral
perch, shaken by the tremors of the cunningly chaotic plot, our heroine is
the last to choose between dogmatic posture and truth to self.
At this point, the film swaps its raggedy colours and camera movements for a
brief spell of Australian School gilded lens-work. Is it mocking its own
cinematic ancestry? Probably. For we are soon back to chaos, visual and
comedic, as the baby is delivered into a world where l'age d'or idealism has
been finally scuppered by the human frailties we know, love and could hardly
live without.
If Waiting is a feminist's satire on Feminism - a lower-case idealist's
onslaught on Upper-case Ideologues - Without You I'm Nothing is a shot from
the same locker. Sandra Bernhard, rubber-faced US comedienne, stands and
delivers her one-woman show for the camera much as she did for six
successful months (we are told) in an off-Broadway theatre.
Targets: pretension, pop culture, white-Anglo-Saxon-protestant America and,
yes, Feminism. Method of attack: lateral lampoonery. Bernhard favours
impersonations of the famous (Cher, Streisand, Diana Ross, even Prince) to
deliver her airy, idiotic, precision-timed monologues followed by songs.
With her voice like a mosquito-whine and her face like a rubber duck pressed
against a window, this performer is an acquired taste. I did not acquire it
in her only previous major film, The King Of Comedy, where she played the
demented groupie who helps kidnap Jerry Lewis. I acquired it in five minutes
here. Bernhard's main trick is to look straight at the camera with a
withering Michigan-Jewish girl's honesty and then lie or tease like hell.
Cultural groupies are her favourite spoof victims - 'Andy (Warhol) really
understood the concept of potlatch' - closely followed by philosophising pop
singers. Musing on the decline of Western civilisation, she says 'Perhaps
Cher said it best ..': then she launches into a Cher-wigged ballad of cosmic
melancholy. Catch this dry, funny treat on screen; and then catch Miss
Bernhard live, if you will, on her late-August British tour.
* * * Finally, your choice for the kiddywinks. Would you prefer a Disney
musical about New York newsboys or a cartoon about a frog working for MI5?
Since both plumb depths of inconsequentiality unsurpassed even this summer,
you may prefer to take the children to Alton Towers or a day with Auntie
Madge.
The News Boys is like some nightmare interbreeding of Oliver] with Annie.
The screen fills with running, jumping and singing street urchins as a plot
unfolds about the Brooklyn newsboys' strike of the 1890s. 'It's a fine fine
life]' they yodel (even the lyrics are borrowed from Lionel Bart) as they
cartwheel through back-lot streets, led by Britain's Christian Bale (Empire
Of The Sun) flexing a dese-dem-dose accent as the young strike-leader.
Robert Duvall (Joseph Pulitzer) and Ann-Margret (cabaret singer) raise their
heads briefly above the parapet before retiring in shock. And Teddy
Roosevelt, or an actor-lookalike, rolls in at the close to fold up the plot.
It is as tuneless and witless an experience as I have had since the school
production I appeared in of Fings Ain't Wot The Used To Be. ('A disaster':
school magazine). Kenny Ortega directed.
As for Jon Acevski's Freddie As FRO7., a cartoon feature in which a
secret-service frog saves Britain from a wicked Snake Queen who is stealing
the national monuments (Big Ben, the Tower of London, Buckingham Palace), we
quail at thoughts of your children's revenge if you subject them to it. They
will probably arrange a return treat by taking you to the Tower of London
and leaving you there. Dotty plot, drab characterisations, tuneless tunes:
back, British animation, to the drawing board.

<TEXT>
   TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, who has
threatened a libel suit for a stripper's story of an alleged sexual
liaison with him, said Wednesday that he knows of another effort
being planned to discredit him.
   Speaking to about 600 people at his Family Worship Center,
Swaggart again accused Penthouse magazine of scheming to destroy his
ministry with a story in which Catherine Mary Kampen said she
performed sex acts for him while he watched.
   Without revealing any details, Swaggart said his ministry had
uncovered another move against him. Swaggart said the plan involved
different people.
   ``There's another effort afoot, as preposterous as this one ...
If you have enough money you can get anyone to say anything,''
Swaggart said.
   Kampen's allegations are similar to those raised last year by a
prostitute, Debra Murphree, which led to Swaggart's ouster from the
Assemblies of God, a Pentecostal denomination, and reversed the
fortunes of Jimmy Swaggart World Ministries.
   Kampen's employer labeled the stripper's allegations, detailed in
Penthouse's current issue, ``a pornographic fairy tale.'' The
magazine said Monday that it was standing by its article.
   On Monday, Swaggart said there was ``not one shred of truth to
these allegations. I have never met or seen the woman.'' Swaggart's
attorneys said they had evidence the story was a hoax, but refused
to discuss specifics.
   Wednesday night, Swaggart said the ministry was approached by a
man in December who knew of Kampen's allegations ``and spilled his
insides ... he said he believed it was a hoax.''
   Swaggart also said a woman he identified as Kampen's employer
also called the ministry and said she knew the story was false.
Swaggart did not reveal the caller's name.
   Rhonda Shear, co-owner of a ``strip-o-gram'' service that employs
Kampen in New Orleans, said Monday that her sister, Nona, told her
Kampen made up the story after seeing the Penthouse story on
Murphree's relations with Swaggart.
   Shear's sister, contacted in New Orleans, said a lawyer had
advised her not to comment. Efforts to reach Kampen for comment have
been unsuccessful.
   Swaggart said the man who revealed Kampen's story to the ministry
had told him Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione was angry because of
Swaggart's work in pressuring convenience stores to discontinue
carrying the men's magazine.
   A telephone call after business hours Wednesday, seeking comment
from Penthouse's spokesmen at their New York City offices was not
answered.
   Swaggart said that during the past year, he had ``learned not to
judge people. I've learned that I'm not God.'' He also advised his
congregation not to ``get to the point where it's `us' and `them.'''
   His ministry would continue with expanded television programming
to China, Brazil and the Netherlands, Swaggart said. ``We are going
to go forward to tell the story of Jesus Christ as we have never
gone forth before,'' he said.

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Business Bookshelf:
A Corporate Raider's Rx for Big Business
---
By Tim Metz</HL>
<DD> 03/16/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Is T. Boone Pickens Jr. getting ready for another mega-deal? 

   Some of his closest observers on Wall Street think so, and Mr. Pickens's new autobiography, "Boone" (Houghton Mifflin, 293 pages, $18.95), does nothing to dissuade anyone from that view. 
In the epilogue of the book, Mr. Pickens quotes a Wall Street analyst answering a Journal reporter's question about what Mr. Pickens might do with the cash and borrowing power (currently about $1.25 billion) of Mesa Limited Partnership, which Mr. Pickens runs: "What do you think Boone will do with that much money?" the analyst counters, rhetorically. 

   "He {implied} we were going to do something," Mr. Pickens writes. 
"But that something might be different. 
I have always believed that it's important to show a new look periodically. 
Predictability can lead to failure." 
Especially in book publishing. 

   Predictability is exactly what's wrong with this otherwise craftsmanlike little book, in which Mr. Pickens collaborated with writer Jim Conaway. 
Too often, "Boone" is an annotated amalgam of Mr. Pickens's press clippings, rather than an insightful self-portrait of the capricious crusader of the oil patch, whom corporate managements have come to fear and loathe. 

   But at least there is no truth-in-packaging problem here. 
"Boone" is what the cover offers, and Boone, Boone, Boone is what the reader gets. 
Thus: 

   Boone grows up in Holdenville, Okla., and Amarillo, Texas. 

   Boone goes to work for Phillips Petroleum Co. but gets frustrated by the waste and bureaucracy there and so leaves to establish what was to grow into Mesa Petroleum Co. 

   Boone realizes in the late 1970s that it's too costly and uncertain to replace Mesa's oil and gas reserves by exploration and so starts hunting for oil on Wall Street. 

   Boone terrorizes and topples Cities Service Co. and Gulf Corp., settles with Phillips, backs away from a confrontation with Superior Oil Corp. and is stopped cold by Unocal Corp. (but the Mesa group uses a tax loophole to reap a $90 million profit in defeat). 

   Boone drops $15,000 on a Super Bowl bet and $3 million in the commodities market while he's off playing in a three-day Canadian golf tournament. (Weep not, Boone fans. 
He's got $105 million left.) 

   Occasionally -- all too rarely in fact -- Mr. Pickens pauses for a little reflection. 
His message is that there are a few things seriously wrong with big business, but they can be put right fairly easily. 

   What's wrong, in Mr. Pickens's view, is that most of the people who manage America's major public companies don't hold enough stock in them to think like shareholders. 
Instead, he contends, they build elaborate, wasteful bureaucracies; eschew, rather than manage, risk; treat themselves to Caligulan life styles at shareholders' expense; and try to hold on to their perks and power by naysaying and using brute economic force against right thinkers such as Mr. Pickens. 

   Mr. Pickens backs his critique with some truly delicious examples of management hubris, cowardice and waste. 
They include oil-exploration kickbacks, $30,000 hunting trips to Spain in a corporate jet, and costly completions of oil wells known to be faulty just so a discovery can be logged. 

   To this reporter, after a couple of decades of observing corporate managements, the book's diagnosis of the disease infecting a good part of industrial America rings true. 
But Mr. Pickens's prescription for the ailment doesn't. 

   His solution, dramatically underscored in his past takeover moves, is to end waste of assets by wresting them away from incompetent or unresponsive managements and turning them back to the shareholders -- through royalty trusts, share repurchases or takeovers. 

   In the end, no matter which way Mr. Pickens slices it, that's liquidation. 
And liquidation is both shortsighted and doubly unjust. 
It's shortsighted because it summarily eliminates the potential long-term shareholder, and, by dismembering corporations, it reduces corporate philanthropy, which is one of the social benefits of large corporations. 
It's unjust because it may reward rather than punish the bad manager, who may simply unfurl his golden parachute and go his merry way; and because it often snatches jobs away from those rank-and-file employees who already are among the principal victims of mismanagement. 

   One wonders why a somewhat-less-radical solution than corporate dismemberment mightn't be a wise alternative to Mr. Pickens's proposals. 
If shareholders can band together to force a sale or restructuring, why couldn't they band together to force managers to take most of their compensation in stock, rather than salary and perks? 

   Ah, but there's no fast money for shareholders in that; no chance for Mr. Pickens to do well while he does good.

<HL> Guccione Suit Against U.S.
In Abscam Probe Dismissed</HL>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge dismissed on technical grounds a $400 million lawsuit brought by publisher Robert C. Guccione challenging the government's conduct in the Abscam investigation. 

   Mr. Guccione, publisher of Penthouse magazine, claimed the widely publicized Abscam corruption probe had unfairly harmed his reputation and prevented him from obtaining financing for a proposed Penthouse hotel and casino in Atlantic City, N.J. Mr. Guccione alleged in the 1984 lawsuit that the Federal Bureau of Investigation's lead Abscam informant had unsuccessfully tried to get Mr. Guccione to bribe a state casino-licensing official, and then made "false and unfounded" remarks about Mr. Guccione to prospective lenders. 

   In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Constance Baker Motley said the U.S. can't be sued for deciding to investigate Mr. Guccione or for alleged wrongdoing by the informant. 
She also said Mr. Guccione should have known by March 1982 that he had been investigated and that his suit was therefore barred by a two-year statute of limitations. 
Mr. Guccione has appealed the ruling. 

   In July, Penthouse won a $129.9 million judgment against a savings and loan that a judge found had breached an agreement to provide financing for the proposed casino.

   Penthouse magazine Publisher Bob Guccione has agreed to buy the troubled Saturday Review, a publication built on catering to good taste. 

   The price wasn't disclosed, but a few years ago when the Review's owner, Saturday Review Limited Partners, Washington, D.C., was looking for a buyer, the asking price was reported as $3.5 million, according to the Associated Press. 
A Penthouse spokeswoman declined to discuss the price. 

   Mr. Guccione also publishes Omni, a monthly science magazine, and Forum, a pocket-sized magazine featuring articles on sexual matters. 

   Mr. Guccione said of his new acquisition, "I believe it (the Saturday Review) can be updated without harming its editorial integrity and it can continue to play an important role in contemporary American letters." 

   Paul Dietrich, the Review's publisher, declined comment. 

   The Review was founded in 1924. 
Its former, longtime editor, Norman Cousins, once said its mission was "to serve and strengthen the cultural marketplace of good taste. . . ." While magazines like Penthouse were succeeding, the Review was failing, and in the past five years it has had three owners and suspended publication three times. 
It is now a bimonthly, publishing half as often as it used to. 

   According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, the Review's circulation slipped under 150,000 last year.

<LEADPARA>  FOR $64,000, what dish (other than green salad and soup du jour) graces more
restaurant menus than any other? Why, Caesar salad, of course. I have no
statistics to verify this, just a lot of observation.;   Twenty years ago,
Caesar salad and steak seemed like the most common order in restaurants.
Today, the steak -- and the martinis and cigarettes that went with it -- is as
rare as a spotted owl. But Caesar salad is as popular as ever, maybe more so.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  HAIL CAESAR
YOU CAN HOLD THE ANCHOVIES, OR THE EGGS, BUT DON'T
HOLD OUT AGAINST THIS MOST ELEGANT OF DINNER
SALADS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  This is the first in an occasional series on classic dishes; See also related
story on page 5E of this section.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     However, while Caesar salad may be the most used restaurant dish, it may
also be the most abused. This relatively simple amalgam of romaine lettuce,
garlic, anchovies, olive oil, lemon juice, croutons and Parmesan cheese has
often been transmogrified into something that looks more like Caligula (well,
Tiberius, anyway) than Caesar.;   Sometimes the variations are subtle. Bradley
Ogden, chef of the Lark Creek Inn in Larkspur, adds a half teaspoon of minced
capers to his Caesar. Jacques Pepin tosses in some crumbled blue cheese.;  
But there are much worse transgressions. At Frankie, Johnnie and Luigi, Too in
Mountain View, the Caesar Fantasy comes with kalamata olives, toasted walnuts
and Gorgonzola. At Eulipia in San Jose, deep-fried scallops top the Caesar. At
Cafe Kati in San Francisco, fried catfish embellishes the Caesar. I've eaten
Caesar salad with sweetbreads and fried oysters plopped on top (not at the
same time).;   All this mystifies Julia Child.;   "That's just not Caesar
salad," she says emphatically.;   Child says her Caesar salad recipe is "as
close to the original as you can get." It should be. She got it after
consulting with Rosa Cardini, daughter of Caesar's originator, Caesar
Cardini.;   Child also recalls eating Caesar salad back in the mid-1920s at
Caesar's restaurant.;   In Rome? No, Tijuana.;   During Prohibition, people
came in droves to Tijuana to drink alcohol and to taste a salad that was
achieving mythic proportions. And just like the pinkie-ringed, tuxedoed
waiters that followed for the next six decades, Caesar Cardini made his salad
tableside in a large wooden bowl with great flourish.;   Why was it such a big
deal?;   "People just didn't eat salads in those days, especially not in the
East," Child says. "Salads were considered foreign and sissy food.";   Child
says that what unsissified the Caesar was probably the addition of garlic and
egg (we'll talk about the egg problem in a minute).;   The original Caesar, or
at least Child's rendition of it, is remarkably light, nothing like what most
of us have come to know as the real thing. To begin with, it has no anchovies!
(Was that a roar I just heard from anchovy haters across America?) The anchovy
thing came about because the original recipe has Worcestershire sauce, which
contains anchovies.;   Child also says that Caesar salads that reek of garlic
are way off base.;   "It should be so subtle that you don't even know it was
used," she says.;   Here are some other tips on how to make your Caesar at
home. I'll leave the fried oysters up to you.;   (check) LETTUCE -- Romaine
and only romaine, because it's sturdy enough to hold up under whatever version
of dressing you decide. And its relatively bland flavor doesn't get in the way
like stronger greens.;   The original Caesar was made with whole, medium-sized
leaves and was designed to be eaten by hand, holding each leaf by the stem
end. But Cardini recognized that most Americans weren't keen on finger food
with sauce on it. So he changed to bite-size pieces.;   Whole leaves make a
nice presentation (especially for food magazines). But unless you plan to eat
them by hand, forget it. You should, however, follow the dictum of using inner
leaves, ones that are no longer than seven or eight inches. Break them by hand
into two-inch pieces.;   (check) OIL -- Only the best olive oil you can
afford.;   (check) CROUTONS -- Homemade and only from good solid French or
Italian (not sourdough) bread. I made croutons with plain white bread. It was
like eating air. Croutons should be at least 1/2-inch square, preferably
3/4-inch. No boulders, please.;   Some recipes call for sauteing bread cubes
in a pan, but that's a real pain. Toss them in oil, then bake them on a sheet
pan in a 350-degree oven about 20 minutes or so, turning a few times for even
browning. Use a timer, too. When I worked in restaurant kitchens, it seemed
like someone burned a batch of croutons at least once a week. And here's a
neat tip: When the croutons get close to done, turn off the oven and let them
sit in there for 15 minutes or so. They'll finish off beautifully.;  
Unfortunately, good croutons require oil or butter as well as garlic. Figure
on a quarter cup oil or butter for every two cups of croutons. If you want to
go the low-calorie route (which, you realize, is an oxymoron with this dish),
don't use oil but put the croutons in the salad early on so they can soften up
a bit. Otherwise, it's Rock City.;   (check) CHEESE -- Parmigiano Reggiano,
the real Parmesan, is what you should use if you can afford it. If not, use
aged Asiago rather than ersatz Parmesan. If you can find a good granna or
generic grating cheese, that might work, too.;   Never buy cheese that is
already grated. Grate just before you need it. Real devotees think Parmigiano
Reggiano should be shaved, not grated (there's even a tool for it).;   (check)
EGG -- Used to be that "hold the anchovies" was the caveat for many who
ordered Caesar, much to the dismay of chefs and husbands (are you listening,
dear?) around the country. Now, it's, "Oh, my God, not raw eggs!?" Actually,
in the original recipe they're coddled, which means boiled about a minute.
Child says eggs aren't essential to the dish but you need some creaminess. So
she recommends a little cream or mayonnaise.;   (check) LEMON JUICE -- Only
fresh-squeezed will do. The ratio of lemon juice to oil is not the same as
most vinaigrettes. Two lemons should do it for six people.;   (check) GARLIC
-- Fresh garlic, no powders or salt. In the original recipe, garlic-flavored
olive oil coats the croutons only. Most recipes today have garlic in the
dressing as well. But it's a good idea not to overdo it. Try this method:
Smash, but leave whole, a few cloves of garlic and put them in the dressing
several hours before you need it. Taste a few times and remove garlic when the
garlic flavor is just where you want it.;   For the croutons, it's better to
steep the garlic in oil, then discard the garlic before baking the croutons.
Garlic left with the croutons during baking will burn and leave a bitter
taste.;   (check) ANCHOVIES -- There are two ways to go: 1) Chop the little
fish fillets into recognizable bits so people like my wife can pick them out;
2) Mash them into a paste so they're unrecognizable, then lie to people like
my wife. Whichever you choose, don't overdo it.;   (check) ETC. -- Mustard:
Some call for dry mustard, others Dijon style. The original had neither.;  
Worcestershire: In lieu of, or in conjunction with, anchovies.;   Tabasco:
When I was a student at the Restaurant School in Philadelphia, our recipe had
a few drops.;   Vinegar: Some recipes call for a small amount in addition to
lemon juice;   Salt: Kosher, if possible.;   Pepper: Freshly ground.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Penthouse magazine has broken weeks of silence
by announcing publication of an ``intimate'' interview with Stephen
Gobie, the prostitute who had a relationship with Rep. Barney Frank.
   The March 1990 issue will hit the newsstands the first week of
February, according to magazine spokeswoman Leslie Jay.
   Frank, D-Mass., who is under investigation by the House ethics
committee for his involvement with Gobie, promptly dubbed the
Penthouse announcement Thursday ``a non-story.''
   ``My guess is the only problem (Penthouse) is going to have is
whether to classify it as fiction or non-fiction,'' Frank said.
   Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, in a one-paragraph
announcement, said the interview would detail ``the subterranean
gay scene in the nation's capital, and its hottest players.''
   ``This is the most intimate interview ever published concerning
a sitting member of Congress,'' Guccione said.
   Gobie was paid a reported $50,000 to tell his story to Penthouse.
   In a news conference earlier this week, Frank dismissed the
potential explosiveness of the Penthouse article. He said it was
``nonsense'' to believe recent reports that the ethics committee
was delaying its investigation until it can review the Penthouse
article.
   Ethics committee Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., also rejected
such claims, noting that any information Penthouse could obtain the
committee also could get simply by issuing a subpoena.
   Gobie already has testified before the ethics committee. Frank
has not yet appeared before the committee _ which holds all its
hearings behind closed doors _ and has not said whether he has been
invited to testify.
   Frank said he is anxious for the opportunity to show the
committee that Gobie's charges are untrue.
   Gobie has an unlisted phone number in the Washington area and
could not be reached Thursday for comment.
   The ethics committee investigation began with Frank publicly
acknowledging late last summer that he had paid Gobie $80 for sex
in 1985, hired him with personal funds to serve as a housekeeper
and driver from July 1985 through August 1987 and intervened with
Virginia probation authorities on Gobie's behalf.
   But Frank has denied other allegations by Gobie, including
charges that Frank knew Gobie was running a prostitution ring from
Frank's apartment on Capitol Hill and that the two had engaged in
sex in the House gymnasium.

<LEADPARA>  IN Restaurantspeak, "Middle Eastern" is the cuisine of a mythical kingdom
stretching from the Nile to Samarkand, where the native bread is flat, the
native meats skewered and the national vegetable the garbanzo.;    There's
some truth in that stereotype, of course. Any cuisine works with the local
materials and within a historical tradition of common borders, language or
conquest.  </LEADPARA>

ARMENIAN GOURMET STILL SATISFIES; NEW PERSEPOLIS
IS SURPRISING  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Restaurants  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     But what variations are possible within that tradition! There may be a
family resemblance between San Jose's new Persepolis restaurant and
Sunnyvale's 17-year-old Armenian Gourmet, but the differences are more
striking than the similarities, and more interesting.;    Armenian Gourmet
serves good, hearty food, decently prepared, with no surprises; mildly spiced,
it's geared to the American taste -- similar to and no more exotic than the
flavors and foodstuffs one would expect to find in, say, a decent Greek
restaurant.;    Redecorated pizzeria;  But Persepolis served up a number of
surprises, at least two of which -- a soup and a dessert -- were truly
memorable.;    Darius I made Persepolis (the Greek name means nothing more
than "Persian City") the capital of his empire more than five centuries before
Caligula.;    Persepolis the restaurant opened two months ago on Blossom Hill
Road, where Tehran native Mohammed Yousefzadeh put up white columns and
replaced his New York and Chicago Style Pizza with a quietly tasteful,
white-tablecloth restaurant. (The pizza place moved around the corner, same
building.);    The restaurant was nearly empty on a Saturday night (late
entertainment deters the crowds) when we spread our flatbread with
cucumber-yogurt mix with mint and torshi (both $3.45). The yogurt seemed more
like a condiment than an appetizer in itself -- I put some on my salad later
-- but it was a fine, fresh foil to the sour torshi, a potent mix of
cauliflower, carrots and eggplant, pickled and spiced up with a bit of chili.
(A somewhat more garlicky version also is available.);    What happened next
left me a trifle confused -- but I think the entrees at Persepolis come with a
salad, although the menu doesn't say so. Because I had ordered a Persepolis
salad ($4.45 for a big Greek-style salad of lettuce, cucumber, tomato,
cabbage, olives and feta cheese in an astringent vinaigrette), the waitress
brought me a cup of soup -- barley soup, made from what tasted like a
thickened chicken stock: mild, rich, soothing.;    Meanwhile, my companion had
ordered what the menu simply calls Persian Soup ($3.95). It turned out to be a
stunning melange of what Yousefzadeh says are imported Persian vegetables --
parsley, spinach, leeks, garbanzos and what I would have guessed were pinto
beans -- in its own stock, with noodles, dried mint and a drizzle of yogurt.
Extraordinary.;    Chicken with exuberant rice; My entree was another unusual
dish, and not at all what I expected. Called Shirin Polo ($8.45) on a list of
specials, it was not the chicken-and-rice dish I inferred from the description
but rather a rice dish with a couple of pieces of chicken on the side. The
chicken had simply been boiled with onions and spices, and removed well short
of the desiccated state achieved by soup chicken.;    The rice was something
else again. Deep yellow from saffron and suffused with sweet tang of candied
citrus, it was filled with bits of orange and tangerine peel, carrots, almonds
and pistachios. The chicken, tasting only of itself, was a useful counterpoint
to this exuberant rice.;    My companion, having disposed of her dinner salad
(a smaller version of the Persepolis salad), was served a plate of rice with a
light saffron dusting and a thin strip of charcoal-broiled filet mignon
($10.95), mildly marinated. It was good, but the surprise was that it wasn't
more interesting.;    Elderly aunts;  Our desserts were another story. One was
an excellent homemade ice cream made with pistachios ($2.75), sweet and very
creamy. The rosewater in the ice cream, elusive in the nose, exploded on the
palate. It was as though a gaggle of elderly aunts had surrounded us.;   
There was rosewater in my companion's dessert, too, but it was applied much
more judiciously. Faloudeh Shirazi ($2.25) is a marvelously refreshing
concoction of honey, lemon, sugar, water and rosewater, frozen, mixed with
bits of small, thin noodle and frozen again, and served with a squeeze of
lemon.;    Steakhouse was unsatisfying; Yousefzadeh is the son of an Iranian
restaurateur. Not a chef himself, he says he spends a lot of time in the
kitchen anyway. "I have a chef, but all the time I am working" is how he puts
it.;    Lebanese-born Armenian Gourmet owner Aram Janjigian became a chef when
he opened his restaurant. Before that, he had spent 10 years as a
front-of-the-house guy at Mr. Kelly's, a celebrated jazz, blues and steak
place on Chicago's Rush Street. He found it unsatisfying.;    Leaving Chicago
for his wife's native California, he broiled kebabs in a storefront on Duane
Avenue -- Dahlak, the East African restaurant, is there now -- before building
his own small, pink restaurant on the corner. His customers, drawn from
neighboring electronics firms, spill out onto the sidewalk at lunchtime. One
of them, a former AMD employee named John Michel, is immortalized on the menu;
he's a combination plate.;    Janjigian's desire to keep the customers
satisfied is not without its aesthetic drawbacks. "I have to be careful with
my garlic and my onions and my spices," he said when I complained that the
"Armenian steak tartar" ($8 as an appetizer, $12.50 as an entree) was kind of
bland. "It's geared more to the business community . . . to the American
taste." He adds bulgur to his tartar, omits the egg and serves the chopped
onions on the side.;    Armenian fajitas and pizza;  He had an interesting
suggestion: You take his dinner salad -- lettuce, feta, black olives -- and
roll it up in a round of pita bread, and put some steak tartar on top of it.
Sounds good to me.;    I had the John Michel special -- salty marinated lamb
kebabs, ground beef kebabs and some strips of lamb and beef sauteed with
onion, the whole thing served over rice -- and liked the saute best. It
reminded me of fajitas.;    There was an excellent appetizer of onions,
mushrooms, the garbanzo dip called hummos, tomatoes and green pepper, all
rolled in a pita round like a burrito. He calls it Lahmajun ($4), "stuffed
Armenian pizza." His baba ghanouj or roasted eggplant dip ($4) was a little
austere, but I liked the tabbuli, the bulgur salad with vegetables.;    One of
my companions ordered a meatless plate ($11.50), which consisted of tabuli,
baba ghanouj and a "cheese turnover" in phyllo dough. The other had a
combination plate ($13) of stuffed eggplant, nicely flavored stuffed grape
leaves and a turnover.;    Desserts? The cheesecake ($2.50) is store-bought
but pretty good. The baklava is homemade, crisp and not too stickily sweet. I
liked it, and I'm not a baklava fan.;  Armenian Gourmet; (star)(star) 1/2 To

'HOW TO READ A DIRTY MOVIE' AT THE NUART; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: CRITIC SUSIE BRIGHT'S COMMENTARY WITH FILM CLIPS IS DESIGNED TO COMBAT 
'SEXUAL ILLITERACY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Susie Bright, like many feminists, has a strong point of view about 
pornographic films, but it's not what you think. She is in favor of them. In a 
big way. And she loves to talk about them, which she will do tonight and 
Thursday at the Nuart, in a presentation titled "How to Read a Dirty Movie." 
</P>
<P>
The program is a combination of hard-core film clips and commentary designed to 
help curb what Bright sees as the "sexual illiteracy" or "erotophobia" plaguing 
the moral left as well as the right. It's educational, all right -- you'll see 
oddities in her clips they'd never show you in anatomy class -- but her 
"literacy" lesson is not for Barbara Bush, or the faint of heart, or really for 
anyone at all besides the terminally curious or already-converted sexual 
libertarians. 
</P>
<P>
As "erotic movie critic" for Penthouse Forum magazine (as well as editor of On 
Our Backs, a lesbian sex journal), Bright often finds herself, as she proudly 
explains, "the lone woman in the Pussycat Theatre." She is unlikely to lure too 
many more converts there from the feminist mainstream with this dissertation. 
Her lecturing has a vaguely political veneer, but basically, she considers 
pornography to be successful art if it's successfully arousing. 
</P>
<P>
For all the rigmarole, it seemingly comes back to this: You either enjoy 
watching people do the wild thing for the wild thing's sake or you don't. 
</P>
<P>
Bright clearly does, and her banter -- sometimes funny and perceptive, 
sometimes unintentionally disturbing -- runs the gamut from professorial to 
unabashedly voyeuristic. One minute our narrator is offering erudite commentary 
on how societal gender differences are reflected (or subverted) in porn, an 
honestly interesting subject; the next she is fannishly wowing over actress 
Georgina Spelvin's ability to simultaneously service a horde of demons in "The 
Devil in Miss Jones, Part 3." 
</P>
<P>
Bright is hardly your typical apologist for the porn industry; she barely 
mentions production values or the quality of the stories. Sex scenes are what 
she is most interested in, whether from 35mm films or zero-budget underground 
videos. ("There've been so many times I've seen an R-rated movie and wanted 
them to go one step further," she says.) 
</P>
<P>
Her big gripe as a "sexually radical feminist" isn't that porn degrades women, 
but that it doesn't portray nearly as many women's orgasms on screen as men's. 
But in spite of this sexism, Bright still cheerfully accentuates the positive, 
surveying a wide scope of modern sexploitation -- sadomasochism and all -- and 
showing "outstanding" clips from her private collection that have "a spark of 
originality, creativity or rebelliousness." 
</P>
<P>
But these "positive" examples she puts up on screen may be what is most 
damaging to her case with an audience: Many of the clips involve what most 
viewers of any sexual persuasion would consider unconscionable cruelty. These 
range from the usual spankings and such to severe verbal abuse, to an 
unbearably protracted sex-and-murder scene (with Jamie Gillis doing the 
strangling). Don't expect any moralizing from Bright; she likes porn films that 
raise "ambiguous feelings." 
</P>
<P>
"Ed Meese and Jesse Helms are the only ones who get to talk about pornography 
on a public scale," Bright says. Her screenside chats are her way of balancing 
the ledger. And though she is too ingenuous to be really pushy in her 
radicalism, you're still made to feel that if you have a hang-up about, say, 
the intermingling of sex and violence, you're more a Meese than a man. Even 
viewers well to the left of her Republican nemeses may still come away feeling 
they learned how to read Susie Bright better than they learned how to look 
between the frames of her dirty movies.

<HL> U.S. Court Ruling Will Help Shield Lenders From Suits </HL>

   A federal appeals court, in a sweeping ruling that will help shield lenders from borrower lawsuits, overturned a record $129 million judgment against a McLean, Va., thrift and its Washington law firm. 

   The judgment, in favor of Penthouse magazine publisher Robert Guccione, had threatened the solvency of Dominion Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association and the law firm Melrod, Redman &amp; Gartlan. 

   Banks and other lenders in recent years have been hit with a wave of so-called lender liability suits, resulting in a series of huge awards. 
In many of the cases, juries or judges have disregarded the lengthy loan agreements that banks write to protect themselves and instead have focused on apparent bad-faith dealing by lenders, such as a derisive remark about good-faith dealing allegedly made by Dominion's chairman, William L. Walde, to a Penthouse adviser: "We're going to do it our way." 
Mr. Walde denied making the remark. 

   But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York gave great weight to the written terms of loan agreements, disparaged a theory of damages that borrowers' lawyers have used to win big judgments, and agreed with federal banking regulators that lender liability suits are a potential threat to the safety and soundness of the banking system. 

   Because there have been few appellate decisions to guide trial courts in this relatively new area of law, and because Second Circuit rulings are influential in business matters, the ruling is expected to have broad impact. 
Banking lawyers said the decision, issued late Friday, would help lenders defend themselves against lawsuits, and will make them less inclined to pay money to settle such suits. 

   "Bank counsel can take a lot of strength from this decision," said Richard F. Levy, a banking lawyer at Kirkland &amp; Ellis in Chicago. 
"It should not only discourage the filing of suits without merit, but should be read by judges throughout the country as requiring people to adhere to contracts they enter into." 

   Dominion Federal, not related to Dominion Bancshares Corp. in Roanoke, Va., has a net worth of just $72 million and couldn't have survived if the judgment were upheld. 

   The May 1987 trial verdict did serious damage to the thrift's reputation. 
In the following month, depositors withdrew about $125 million, said Richard S. Lawton, the S&amp;L's president, in an interview. 

   Officials of the Melrod law firm, which also had been held liable for the judgment, couldn't be reached for comment. 
Neither could Penthouse officials or lawyers. 

   The case grew out of Penthouse's efforts to build an Atlantic City casino. 
Dominion agreed to loan $35 million on the project. 
Penthouse charged that when Dominion had trouble finding other lenders to take part of its commitment, the S&amp;L schemed to delay the loan closing to get out of the commitment, acting in bad faith. 
Dominion denied this, and asserted it was merely taking precautions to protect itself from loss. 

   The Second Circuit panel ruled that much of Dominion's behavior that the trial court found shoddy occurred after the term of the loan agreement, and thus wasn't relevant. 

   The panel questioned the use of so-called lost profits to calculate damages. 
That theory, estimating how much Mr. Guccione would have made over ten years had the casino been built, accounted for about $112 million of the Penthouse verdict. 
The theory "may not be good law," the panel said. 

   The panel also said that "sound national banking policies support the conclusions we reach here." 
The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates S&amp;Ls, filed a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of Dominion.

<HEAD>Trump, Guccione Sued By Pratt Hotel Corp.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE A. VENEZIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pratt Hotel Corp. filed a civil
racketeering suit Monday against developer Donald Trump and
Penthouse magazine publisher Robert C. Guccione in a continuing
dispute over an unfinished casino project.
   Trump, Guccione and their corporate entities also were accused
of civil conspiracy, antitrust and fraud in the Superior Court
lawsuit filed by Pratt, which alleged Trump wanted the Penthouse
property to avoid increased competition for his rival Trump Plaza
Hotel and Casino.
   Pratt had a contract to purchase the incomplete Penthouse
project and convert it into the Sands Hollywood casino, but on
March 19 Trump made a surprise announcement that he purchased the
Penthouse site for $56 million and planned to convert it into a
non-casino hotel.
   Trump ``consistently and vehemently opposed the development of
the Sands Hollywood Casino Hotel project _ a competitor immediately
next door to Trump's major profitable asset in Atlantic City,''
Pratt said in a prepared statement.
   Pratt seeks to void Trump's contract with Guccione and force
Penthouse International Inc. to honor the Pratt contract. It also
asks for compensatory and punitive damages and asks that Trump's
casino license be revoked.
   Attorneys for the Pratt, Trump and Penthouse are scheduled to
appear at a conference before Superior Court Judge L. Anthony
Gibson on April 11.
   Pratt Hotel officials said Trump deliberately delayed the Sands
Hollywood project with legal challenges and attempts to purchase
parcels of land needed for the casino's parking facility.
   Pratt President William P. Weidner said Monday that Penthouse
violated the terms of its contract with Pratt by signing the deal
with Trump.
   ``Trump did everything he could _ both legally and illegally _
to ensure he did not have a competitor next door,'' said Roberto
Rivera-Soto, attorney for Pratt. ``And Guccione, through his
corporate entities, did everything he could to either have us
finance him or increase the value of his property at our expense.
   Trump on Monday referred calls to his Atlantic City attorney,
Patrick T. McGahn Jr., who said the Penthouse property was an open
target after Pratt's extended option to buy expired Feb. 1.
   ``It appears that the Sands and Pratt organizations may be
merely trying to cover up their own negligence and that of their
corporate officers and directors in failing to exercise the
option,'' McGahn said said.
   Penthouse International spokeswoman Leslie Jay said Monday the
company would have no comment until officials reviewed the lawsuit.
   In 1978, Penthouse bought the 392-room Holiday Inn on the
Boardwalk and the Four Seasons Motel on Pacific Avenue and
announced plans to link the two to create a casino hotel.
   A steel superstructure was put in place to link the two
buildings together, but construction stopped when Guccione ran out
of money.
   Trump has said he intends to demolish the rusting framework, but
refurbish the Holiday Inn facility into a non-casino hotel
connected to Trump Plaza. The back section of the Boardwalk
property at first would become parking space but a luxury hotel
would eventually be built on the site.

<HL> Women Allege Sexist Atmosphere In Offices Constitutes Harassment </HL>

<TEXT>
   A group of men in Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.'s Boston office pastes nude photographs from Playboy magazine onto biographies of new women employees that the company includes in newsletters. 

   A ChemLawn Corp. executive allegedly spices up a company slide show with a photo of a naked woman and suggestive comments. 

   Administrators at St. Louis University Medical Center show the X-rated movie "Deep Throat" at a meeting after telling a businesswoman that they would show an "educational film." 

   Blatant, good-old-boy sexism still thrives in the corporate workplace. 
In some offices, it's sophomoric risque jokes or pornographic slides in video presentations; at others it's pinup posters or lewd pranks. 
But whatever form it takes, many women feel that the office atmosphere created by such behavior constitutes sexual harassment -- and some of them are going to court to stop it. 

   "Instead of a single individual (being charged with harassment), I'm seeing more cases in which the whole environment is a source of sexual harassment," says K. C. Wagner, a pyschological counselor who is scheduled to testify as an expert witness in three cases that involve sexist environments. 

   Adds Beville May, a lawyer representing a Securities and Exchange Commission worker who charged that a sexist atmosphere in her office amounted to harassment: "It's psychological warfare with an old-boy network. 
Where does a person turn for relief?" 

   Corporate officials, meanwhile, condemn such practices, but often argue that they don't amount to harassment. 

   So far, the courts have been murky on the issue. 
"Decisions often have depended on the quirks of one court or judge vs. another," says Kathleen Neville, vice president of Women's Action for Good Employment Standards, a national women's rights organization that tracks cases. 
"But as more of these cases get into court and employers start discussing them, a clearer picture will emerge." 

   Among the pending suits is one filed in December by Kristine Utley, a sales associate for Goldman Sachs, in state Superior Court in Boston. 
Ms. Utley was fired in November after refusing a transfer to New York; her suit claims the transfer was discriminatory because a man in a similar job wasn't asked to move to New York. 

   Separately, her complaint charges Goldman Sachs with sexual harassment over the behavior of some employees in the Boston office. 
The suit alleges that some male employees cut out photographs of bare-breasted women from magazines and put them on copies of company newsletters, next to brief biographies of new women employees, as if they were photos of the new workers; the newsletters were then passed around the office. 
The suit also says the men circulated sexist literature, like "The Smart Man's Creed, or Why Beer is Better than Women." 
One line: "After you've had a beer, the bottle is still worth a dime." 
Ms. Utley wants her job back, unspecified damages and an end to the alleged harassment. 

   A Goldman Sachs spokesman says an inquiry by the firm found that four men in the office were responsible. 
"They were severely disciplined, and one has since left the firm," he says. 
But in a brief, the firm denies that the pictures and disparaging literature created a hostile, intimidating and sexist work environment. 
The firm also contends that it didn't discriminate against Ms. Utley in firing her. 

   In a suit awaiting trial in federal district court in Rochester, N.Y., Joanne Barbetta alleges that male co-workers at ChemLawn reveled in a climate of pornography and vulgarities. 
Ms. Barbetta says the atmosphere forced her to quit her job as a clerk. 
Her suit, filed in May 1986, seeks unspecified damages. 

   In her complaint, she says men in the office circulated pinup calendars and pornographic magazines. 
She also says a ChemLawn executive included suggestive slides in a presentation. 
One showed a nude model, the complaint says, and about another slide, of a woman in a tight-fitting dress, the executive commented: "She's a real asset to the company." 
Management explained the slides as a way to "keep the guys awake," the complaint says. 

   Ms. Barbetta also claims that a male co-worker habitually grabbed her breasts. 
"The whole atmosphere was poisoning my system," she says. 
"I would go home and cry every night." 

   But Eugene Ulterino, a lawyer representing the company, says, "Whether or not she quit as a result of stress on the job will have to be argued in court." 

   In a filing, ChemLawn, now a unit of EcoLab Inc. of St. Paul, Minn., says, "When viewed in their totality, these isolated remarks and events over the course of two years fall far short" of the legal standard for sexual harassment. 
The filing adds that the law "does not create a claim of sexual harassment for each and every crude joke or sexually explicit remark, even when uttered by a supervisor." 

   Also awaiting trial, in federal district court in Washington, D.C., is the harassment and discrimination suit of Marie Regab against Air France, a case that has prompted some women's groups to picket several Air France terminals in the U.S. 
The suit, seeking reinstatement, $1.5 million in damages and an end to harassment, was filed in October 1986, shortly after Ms. Regab was fired from her job as a saleswoman for the airline in Washington. 

   The reason she was given for her dismissal: "recalcitrance and intransigence," according to the complaint. 
Ms. Regab, an Air France employee for 18 years, contends she was fired "only after she started asking for equal pay," says James Forrest King, her attorney. 

   In her complaint, Ms. Regab alleges that her office was a sex-oriented environment in which one of her superiors asked her to sleep with another while the other repeatedly took her to lunch and dinner to discuss his sex life. 
Mr. King says he intends to portray the office as having the atmosphere of a men's "locker room, with men carrying around Penthouse and Playboy magazines and openly talking about their sexual exploits." 
Ms. Regab says the workplace atmosphere constituted harassment because "it was sickening and an insult to the women in the office." 
She says she put up with "the sexual nonsense for the sake of keeping my job." 
Air France denies the suit's charges. 

   The few similar previous cases have produced mixed results. 
Last year a jury in state court in St. Louis rejected a $4 million suit by Olivia Young, a medical-services saleswoman, over being shown the movie "Deep Throat" in the presence of business associates. 

   Ms. Young was shown the movie at St. Louis University Hospital, with which her firm did business, by a group of male hospital administrators at the end of a meeting. 
She claimed that watching the film caused acute emotional distress that led to a divorce and the loss of her job, says Frank Susman, her trial attorney. 

   Last May, a federal district court in Michigan dismissed a claim by Vivienne Rabidue, a secretary for Osceola Refining Co., that foul language and sexual posters poisoned her work environment. 
The court said the claim didn't stand up "when considered in the context of a society that condones and publicly features and commercially exploits open displays of written and pictorial erotica." 

   But in one pending case, a preliminary ruling has gone in favor of the plaintiff. 
Michael A. Telesca, the judge hearing Ms. Barbetta's complaint against ChemLawn, last year rejected a company motion to dismiss the suit and ordered the case to trial. 
He ruled that the sexual material "may be found to create an atmosphere in which women are viewed as men's sexual playthings rather than as their equal co-workers." 
That atmosphere, he added, can affect the "psychological well-being of the reasonable woman and interfere with her ability to perform her job." 

   Women's groups say companies should do a better job of policing themselves. 
But employers say it isn't always easy to define what does and doesn't constitute an environment of sexual harassment. 
"It's such an individualized thing," says George Palmer, a spokesman for Du Pont Co. "Harassment can be different things to different people." 
He adds that to be safe, "we tell people: It's harassment when something starts bothering somebody."

   Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt offered
a hitman $1 million to kill Playboy magazine founder Hugh Hefner,
Frank Sinatra, publisher Walter Annenberg and Penthouse publisher
Bob Guccione, authorities said Wednesday.
   The $1 million never was paid, however, and the purported hitman,
Mitchel L. WerBell, died of a heart attack in December 1983 about a
month after he allegedly accepted the check from Flynt, sheriff's
Capt. Robert Grimm said at a news conference.
   Grimm identified targets of the alleged plot as Hefner, Sinatra
and Guccione. He declined to name a fourth person targeted, but
KNBC-TV news reported that person was Annenberg.
   ``Larry Flynt one evening called an individual by the name of
WerBell to his home and allegedly offered him $1 million if he would
arrange for the death of these four individuals,'' Sheriff Sherman
Block told KNBC.
   WerBell called himself an advisor to the Green Berets in Vietnam
and a retired general of the Royal Free Afghan Army, according to
promotional material from his counterterrorism firm, Sionics Inc.,
released by the Sheriff's Department.
   ``He did in fact give WerBell a $1 million check which,
immediately upon leaving, we were told, that Flynt's business
manager stopped payment on that check so it never was negotiated,''
the sheriff of Los Angeles County said in the broadcast interview.
   The station displayed a photocopy of a $1 million check allegedly
signed by Flynt, made out to WerBell.
   Grimm said information about the alleged plot turned up recently
in the investigation the 1983 murder-for-hire slaying of New York
theater producer Roy Radin, whom authorities said was embroiled in a
soured finance deal for the movie ``The Cotton Club.''
   Grimm said sheriff's investigators have not interviewed Flynt and
have not presented a case to the district attorney's office. He
declined to elaborate and said the sheriff spoke about the purported
plot because he was approached by the news media and decided to
answer questions about it.
   In 1983, Flynt claimed to have knowledge of videotapes
purportedly showing Vicki Morgan, mistress of the late Diners Club
founder Alfred Bloomingdales engaged in sexual antics with Reagan
administration officials.
   The tapes were never produced or proven to exist.
   Another time that year, Flynt threatened to parachute over the
Pacific Ocean at the site where Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was shot
down by a Soviet interceptor.
   At the time, Flynt was heavily sedated with powerful drugs to
assuage pain from wounds that left him paralyzed after an
assassination attempt in 1978 during an obscenity trial in Georgia.
   Block told KNBC that Flynt could possibly be prosecuted for
soliciting a murder. However, no charges have been filed.
   Bill Farley, director of communications for Playboy, said the
plot occurred in November 1983 and came to light in the course of an
investigation into another matter.
   Farley said his information came from the Sheriff's Department,
but he did not know what the other matter was.
   Susan Reynolds, publicist for Frank Sinatra, said the entertainer
was en route to Reno, Nev., for performances and she wasn't able to
contact him. She said she would leave a message at the hotel, asking
him to call.
   A telephone call placed to Penthouse magazine headquarters in New
York was answered by a security guard who said no one representing
the magazine was available for comment.
   A telephone call placed to Annenberg's Palm Springs home was
answered by a woman who said he was in residence on the East Coast
and wouldn't be immediately available for comment.
   She declined to disclose her relationship to Annenberg or what
city he was living in. She took a message and said she would forward
it to Annenberg. After hours calls made to Annenberg's Triangle
Publications, in Radnor, Pa., went unanswered.
   Block said he considered the matter serious. ``I've been led to
believe that Larry Flynt has a propensity to try to harm people he
sees as his enemies, whether business arrangements or whatever,''
Block said.
   A receptionist at Flynt's office didn't know where the publisher
and said she was unaware of the report on the alleged murder plot.
   Although the broadcast report suggested a publishing rivalry
between the men's magazine publishers, Farley said the other names
suggested that was not the case and that the motivation is unknown.
   ``Why the authorities chose to release Hugh Hefner's name and not
anybody else's is a mystery to me,'' Farley said.

<TEXT>
   A stripper performed explicit sexual acts for
Jimmy Swaggart while he was involved with a prostitute, Penthouse
magazine says, but the television evangelist's attorney called the
story a fabrication.
   Catherine Mary Kampen said Swaggart gained her trust as a
spiritual adviser, then emotionally manipulated her into acting out
his sexual fantasies, the magazine said in its March issue.
   ``The whole thing's made up,'' Swaggart attorney's Phillip A.
Wittman said Sunday.
   Wittman said Swaggart would file a libel lawsuit, probably this
week, against the men's magazine.
   ``Jimmy Swaggart doesn't even know Miss Kampen,'' said Wittman.
``He's never met her, never seen her.''
   Wittman said Swaggart was returning home to Baton Rouge from a
weekend crusade in Atlanta.
   According to Penthouse, Swaggart approached Kampen, a homemaker
and performer of striptease telegrams, at a roadside telephone in
July 1987.
   Kampen said Swaggart told her he could help her with her marriage
and personal life, and promised to help her financially while
demanding she perform sexual acts for him.
   Like Debra Murphree, the prostitute whose account Penthouse
published in July, Kampen claimed that Swaggart asked her to perform
explicit sex acts while he watched.
   Murphree said Swaggart wanted her 9-year-old daughter to watch
them have sex; Kampen said the evangelist asked to have sex with her
13-year-old daughter.
   Like Murphree, who said she was involved with Swaggart from
October 1986 until October 1987, Kampen claimed she posed for
Swaggart but kept her daughter away from him.
   Unlike Murphree, who said she and Swaggart attempted to have sex
one time, Kampen told the magazine she and Swaggart never had sex
during their six-month relationship.
   She said she asked him if he wanted to.
   ``And he said, `Oh sure, but that would be cheating. What we're
doing here is just playing _ it's fun and games, it's not cheating.
You understand that, don't you,''' Kampen quoted Swaggart as saying.
   Wittmann said his law firm conducted its own investigation of the
allegations after Penthouse asked about them more than a month ago.
   ``We advised Penthouse that in our view the story was a
fabrication, and we were under the impression that they were not
going to release the story,'' he said.
   ``They in fact had asked us for further information which we were
in the process of assembing for them,'' said Wittmann, adding that
he was shocked the story had been published.
   Last February, Swaggart confessed that he had sinned against his
church and his wife, but never gave specifics.
   Murphree has said Swaggart was talking about her, but Kampen said
she thought Swaggart was talking about her.
   Swaggart was defrocked by the Assemblies of God in April because
he disobeyed the Pentecostal denomination's order that he not preach
for a year and returned to the pulpit three months later.

<HEAD>Penthouse Publisher's N.J. Casino Suit Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today killed Penthouse
magazine publisher Robert Guccione's $400 million lawsuit against
the federal government in connection with the FBI's Abscam
investigation.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that dismissed
Guccione's suit.
   In Abscam, a highly publicized ``sting'' operation in the late
1970s, FBI agents posed as representatives of phony Arab sheiks
looking for investment opportunities.
   A key figure in the operation was Melvin Weinberg, a con man
turned FBI informant and middleman.
   Guccione said Weinberg promised him that the bogus sheiks would
finance an Atlantic City, N.J., casino if Guccione would take part
in bribing New Jersey officials to obtain a casino license.
   The magazine publisher said he refused to go along, and Weinberg
then spread rumors that Guccione had financial problems and was
connected to organized crime figures.
   As a result, the suit said, Guccione was unable to secure
legitimate financing for a casino from 1979 to 1983.
   A 1983 Senate report criticized the FBI for its handling of
Weinberg. The report said the Guccione episode is ``a chilling
reminder of the risks imposed by lax procedures and inadequate
supervision of an informant like Weinberg.''
   Guccione's suit accused federal officials of negligently
supervising Weinberg.
   The government enjoys broad immunity from being sued, but under
the Federal Tort Claim Act has surrendered some of that protection.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last May upheld a judge's
ruling that threw out the suit, ruling that the federal law does
not permit Guccione to sue.
   ``The United States is not liable for the intentional (injuries
caused by) those carrying out its business, even though (Guccione)
alleges a claim of primary negligence on the part of the United
States in failing to supervise or otherwise avoid foreseeable
risks,'' the appeals court said.
   The case is Guccione vs. U.S., 89-553.
