<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Netherlands and Suriname Agree </F>
On Control of Economy"]
  [Text] Last weekend, the Netherlands and Suriname agreed on
an "honorable" way in which the Netherlands will assess the
developments of the Surinamese economy in the next few months.
Depending on that assessment, the Netherlands will decide
whether it will resume its support to the Surinamese balance of
payments and whether it will provide funds for the creation of
an industry fund.
  This was stated by Surinamese President R. Venetiaan last
Sunday [22 May] at a news conference in Amsterdam, during a
short stay in the Netherlands. The disagreement between both
countries concerned the question whether the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) would be granted permission to "report" to
the Netherlands about the reorganisation plans for the
Surinamese economy. Cooperation Development Minister Pronk had
requested the IMF to express such an independent opinion.
  The disagreement on the meaning of the IMF report was not
due
to "childish stubborness on the part of Suriname," Venetiaan
stated, but was a matter of "honor and national sovereignty."
The compromise, which was reached after almost half a year of
negotiations, holds that Suriname will admit observers from the
IMF, but that it will not officially submit the reports and
recommendations to the Netherlands. The Netherlands will,
however, get the reports from the IMF later on, informally.
  Last March, Minister Pronk had already agreed with his
Surinamese colleague on the way in which the IMF would supervise
the changes to the Surinamese economy. It had been agreed that
the organization would draw up quarterly reports, with
suggestions to gear the economy to the existing recovery plans.
  Later on, there was political disagreement on this issue in
Suriname. The country objects to the IMF's formal role, because
it refuses to comply with the organization's recommendations,
which are expected to be strict. According to Venetiaan,
Minister Pronk hinted last Saturday that "compromises" about the
IMF approach could lead to the recovery of Dutch support to the
balance of payments.
  The Surinamese president was in the Netherlands after visits
to Indonesia, Malaysia, and China, but he refused to elaborate
on the results of this trip. In Indonesia, there were talks
about the large-scale tree felling projects, for which
Indonesian businessmen were given a license. According to
several environmental groups, the relevant developers have a bad
reputation.
  They fear that the Surinamese rain forest might be developed
in the same way as parts of East Kalimantan in Indonesia. In
spite of the strict forest legislation, the jungle has been
irreparably damaged there in many places, because the control of
the development failed due to corruption. Venetiaan said that
he found no evidence of irresponsible lumbering in Indonesia.
  Indonesia did promise Suriname's support for the training of
forest rangers. The Netherlands has also provided money for
that purpose.

   The New York Post hired Jane Amsterdam as editor, the top news position.

   Ms. Amsterdam, an editor with book publisher Alfred A. Knopf Inc., will succeed Frank Devine, New York Post Co. officials confirmed privately.
The Post didn't comment on Mr. Devine's plans, but several reporters said it was their understanding he would stay on for a time to assist in the transition.

   The paper, which New York real estate developer Peter Kalikow purchased earlier this year from Rupert Murdoch, is expected to announce the change today.
The Post courted Ms. Amsterdam, who is expected to take over in mid-June, for several weeks.
Mr. Kalikow wants to create a new image to counter the tabloid's sensationalist image; Ms. Amsterdam's experience as an editor and reporter has been with such publications as New York magazine, the Washington Post, and Manhattan inc. magazine.

   Mr. Kalikow and Post publisher Peter O. Price have made only minor changes since they came aboard in March, but Mr. Kalikow has said he would like the paper to appeal to a more upscale audience.
In its last months under Mr. Murdoch's ownership, the Post sustained steep declines in circulation and advertising, but the paper says it has regained about 15% of the lost ad revenue.
Circulation has increased to 630,000 from 465,000 since the sale.
At the time of the ownership change, Mr. Kalikow and other Post officials had indicated Mr. Devine would remain on board for a considerable time to come.

   Neither Ms. Amsterdam nor Mr. Devine could be reached for comment.

   Ms. Amsterdam is best known as the original editor of Manhattan inc., a New York business magazine started in 1984 that has won several awards for editorial excellence.
The magazine, considered one of the more successful start-ups in recent years, attracted wide readership among the city's business elite.
Ms. Amsterdam left the magazine last year after a dispute with its owner, Herbert Lipson.

   Ms. Amsterdam "comes with credentials that will reinforce us in a variety of areas," Mr. Price said last week, confirming the Post was wooing her.
"Above all, she understands how New York City works.
That's her most impressive credential."

   Jane Amsterdam, a magazine and book editor best known for her work at Manhattan inc. magazine, is being considered for a senior position at the New York Post.

   Post Publisher Peter O. Price said he has talked with Ms. Amsterdam in recent weeks about a number of jobs, but he declined to be more specific.
A source, however, said Ms. Amsterdam would be a candidate for the editor's job, the top news position, held by Frank Devine.

   The Post's talks with Ms. Amsterdam are a further indication that Peter Kalikow, the paper's new owner, wants to change its image as one of the country's most sensationalistic daily tabloids.
Mr. Kalikow purchased the Post earlier this year from Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Ms. Amsterdam had been editor of Manhattan inc. magazine since its founding in 1984; she resigned in March 1987 after a dispute with its owner and publisher, D. Herbert Lipton.
The magazine is considered among the more successful city business publications and has won a number of editorial awards.

   Last November, Alfred A. Knopf Inc., the book publisher, named Ms. Amsterdam a senior editor.
She also has worked at New York magazine, another weekly city publication, and the Washington Post.
Ms. Amsterdam declined to comment.

   Jane Amsterdam, founding editor of

owner Peter S. Kalikow announced today.
   Ms. Amsterdam, 36, will start work June 13 and be listed
officially as executive editor until the departure of the current
editor, Frank Devine, Kalikow said in a statement. Devine is
returning to Australia by year's end.
   He stayed on after Rupert Murdoch sold the paper in March to
real-estate developer Kalikow, who made Peter O. Price publisher.
   ``We are delighted to be bringing in an editor of Jane
Amsterdam's caliber,'' Price said today in a statement. ``Her
reputation for editorial integrity and excellence is well-known.''
   Ms. Amsterdam was an editor in the Style section and the
investigative unit of The Washington Post, and executive editor at
New Times, American Lawyer and New York magazines.
   She is generally credited with making a success of
Manhattan,inc., which was founded in 1984 as an upscale city
magazine that treated top business executives as celebrities.
   She resigned in March 1987 after a disagreement over editorial
autonomy with the owner of the magazine, D. Herbert Lipson. In
January, she joined the publishing house of Alfred A. Knopf as a
senior editor.
   According to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, Ms.
Amsterdam would become the sixth woman holding the position of top
editor at a newspaper with a circulation of more than 100,000.
   The Post is the nation's oldest continually published daily
newspaper.

   Jerry Nachman, a columnist for the New York
Post, was appointed today as the newspaper's new editor.
   Nachman succeeds Jane Amsterdam, who was relieved on Tuesday of
her duties as editor by the tabloid's owner and publisher Peter
Kalikow.
   Ms. Amsterdam, former editor of the magazine Manhattan, inc.,
was the paper's editor for 50 weeks.
   Before Nachman joined the Post, he had worked as general manager
for the NBC-owned television station in Washington and news
director at WNBC-TV in New York.
   His appointment was announced in the paper's newsroom.
   Kalikow's spokesman, Howard Rubenstein, said no specific
incident precipitated the change. ``It's been under consideration
for a while, and Kalikow felt he needed someone new to take the
Post to the next level,'' he said.
   It had been reported that there was friction between the editor
and publisher over a decision to cut back the size of the tabloid's
Sunday edition, which has lost millions since it was introduced in
March.
   In a statement issued by Rubenstein, Kalikow said he was pleased
with the progress the Post had made under Ms. Amsterdam. She ``has
worked hard and intelligently and she leaves the Post with many
achievements. She will always have my respect and high regard,'' he
said.
   In the same statement, Ms. Amsterdam was quoted as saying that
she departs ``with great sadness. The paper came a long way,
achieving new energy and respectability.''
   Rubenstein said Ms. Amsterdam had not decided what she would do
next.

   Jane Amsterdam, editor of the New York Post for
11 months, has quit her $200,000-a-year job, two of its competitors
reported today.
   A source close to the paper, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press today that no formal action
had been taken but was expected early next week.
   ``She is not yet not the editor,'' the source said.
   A spokesman for the Post, Howard Rubenstein, would neither
confirm nor deny the reports. He said a statement by Post owner
Peter S. Kalikow may be issued later today or Tuesday.
   ``She's still working for the paper, there's no question about
that. She's still the editor'' today, Rubenstein said. He would not
comment on her plans.
   Amsterdam's secretary at the Post said Amsterdam was not in the
office today and was not expected. The secretary said all calls on
the subject were being forwarded to Rubenstein.
   Amsterdam, 37, became one of six women editing a U.S. newspaper
with a circulation larger than 100,000 on June 13. She had a
three-year contract.
   She previously was editor of Manhattan, inc. magazine and worked
for The Washington Post.
   ``There is a parting of the ways, but Jane has not been fired,''
a source closely connected with the Post told New York Newsday.
   The Daily News also quoted a source as saying, ``There was a
mutual parting of the ways.''
   Both reports said Amsterdam's resignation may have resulted over
the decision to scale back the newspaper's 11-week-old Sunday
edition.
   The Post announced it was reducing the paper to a single section
and cutting the price from $1 to 40 cents due to a lack of
advertising in the Sunday section.
   Amsterdam was heavily involved in creating the Sunday edition.
   She would be the second top news executive to leave the Post
recently. Publisher Peter Price, 48, left the newspaper last month
to begin a national sports newspaper.

   NEW YORK -- The New York Post just may live to see
tomorrow, but the newspaper has come to represent a dying
breed.
   Post owner Peter Kalikow gave the paper a reprieve late
Friday, allowing the Newspaper Guild to vote on a
salary-slashing proposal that calls for a four-day work week
and 20% cut in pay. The Guild, which represents reporters,
editors, and advertising staff, is expected to approve the
proposal, under pressure, if only to save the jobs of other
union members.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Kalikow, who has lost $80 million on the Post in two
and a half years, vows to close the paper immediately if the
proposal is not ratified tonight at a 6 p.m. meeting.
   The 189-year-old Post has lived by the sword and it could
die by the sword. Its trademark brand of journalism is rarely
seen anymore in American newspapers: a rough-and-tumble,
street-wise style, that mirrors both the passions and
prejudices of a polyglot New York readership. Headline
classics such as "Headless Body In Topless Bar," "Shark Eats
Man Alive," and "Best Sex I Ever Had" have played well in New
York.
   New Yorkers may yet see more of these hard-to-forget
headlines. But industry consultants, analysts, and even other
tabloid publishers, say the Post's incendiary, blood-and-guts
brand of tabloid newspaper has quickly become an anachronism.
   Even in the hands of its current editor, the
tough-talking, glib Jerry Nachman, a Brooklyn native who
virtually personifies a city tabloid editor, the Post's
circulation has sunk to desperate lows. Circulation once
soared under then-owner Rupert Murdoch in the 1980s.
Bolstered by readers sweepstakes and tantalizing crime
stories, Post circulation reached 962,000 in 1983; for the
six months ended March 31, Post circulation has dropped 6%
from a year earlier to 504,000. Circulation at New York's
"upscale market" papers, New York Newsday and the New York
Times, both moved up in the same period.
   Considered a mass-market crowd pleaser, tabloid-style
journalism has rarely been a winner in the last two decades.
Mr. Murdoch tried it in Chicago with the Sun-Times, gaining
readers but losing advertisers. The Toronto Sun Publishing
Corp. bought and transformed the Houston Post into a racy tab
in the early 1980s, after which the Post lost valuable market
share to the cross-town rival Houston Chronicle. In both
cities, new owners were faced with toning down the racy
style, usually to regain lost advertisers.
   In St. Louis, Ingersoll Publications Co. created a new
tabloid in the fall of 1989. Less sensational than most,
Ingersoll's St. Louis Sun played up crime, hired combative
columnists, and kept a conservative political stance, all a
counterpoint to Pulitzer Publishing Co.'s St. Louis
Post-Dispatch, the entrenched broadsheet. The Sun set after
only seven months due to high delivery cost, lackluster
street sales, and lack of consistent advertising from St.
Louis' most prestigious advertisers.
   "Demographic shifts are against papers like the Post,"
said James Dolan, a former Sun-Times executive and now a
media investment banker with Jordan Group. "The people most
likely to read a newspaper today are least likely to be
interested in what tabloids have to offer. The traditional
tabloid reader gets what he wants from TV."
   Even if the Post were winning over legions of new readers,
it would present a dilemma, according to John Morton,
newspaper industry analyst with Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan. While
Mr. Murdoch boosted circulation with games like Wingo, the
Post's share of the New York advertising market remains low.
"If you are losing money on every copy sold, the more you
sell the more you lose because of increased paper and
distribution costs," said Mr. Morton.
   Mr. Kalikow hired magazine editor Jane Amsterdam in 1988
to raise the paper's "journalistic standards and practices."
She played down the sensational sex stories and played up
investigative pieces. For a brief time, uptown department
stores took ads in the Post. But after run-ins with Mr.
Kalikow over editorial direction, Ms. Amsterdam left a year
later, succeeded by Mr. Nachman.
   "The problem is the ad market has targeted a whole other
group of reader," said Ms. Amsterdam.
   Tabloids are by no means dead, but they are being updated
for baby boomers.
   Times Mirror Co.'s New York Newsday straddles the line
between gritty street news and full coverage of the arts and
magazine-length feature stories. In Pawtucket, R.I., Robert
Jelenic, chief executive of Journal Register Co., which
includes the U.S. papers once belonging to Ralph Ingersoll,
plans a tabloid-style remake of the Evening Times, but with a
difference.
   "You can't get by today just on pretty girls on page 3 and
crime stories," said Mr. Jelenic. "You must have opinionated
columnists, good reporters, and you gotta break stories."
   Under Mr. Nachman, the Post has done its share of that,
breaking some of the biggest stories of the year in New York
City. In an interview Saturday, however, Mr. Nachman said "it
won't be easy" publishing the Post with reporters and editors
on four-day work weeks.
   Mr. Nachman vows not to be the last editor of the New York
Post. "The Post is like the Vietcong," he said. "You shoot
them . . . but they get back up and spray you with machine
gun fire . . . . the Post has a history of overcoming all
sorts of baroque obstacles."

   Jerry Nachman, a columnist for the New York Post
and a veteran of the city's media wars, was named the newspaper's
editor Wednesday.
   Nachman, 43, spent most of his career in broadcast journalism
before joining the Post as a columnist early last year.
   He succeeds Jane Amsterdam, who was relieved of her duties
Tuesday by Post owner and publisher Peter Kalikow after 50 weeks in
the position, Kalikow said in a statement.
   Nachman will be a vice president of the New York Post Co. and is
expected to be elected to the newspaper's board of directors, the
statement said.
   Before joining the Post, the New York native was general manager
of the NBC-owned television station in Washington, news director of
WNBC-TV, vice president for news for the NBC-owned stations and a
reporter for WCBS-TV and WCBS-AM.
   Nachman worked for newspapers in Ohio before returning to New
York and beginning his broadcast career.
   Ms. Amsterdam's departure, according to Post spokesman Howard
Rubenstein, was brought on not by any specific problem but by
Kalikow's desire to ``take the Post to the next level.''

   NEW SUNDAY TABLOID IN NAKED CITY!
   This weekend, the New York Post joins the crowd at the city's
Sunday newsstands, its Fleet Street tilt a fading memory as it
challenges the Daily News and New York Newsday for tabloid supremacy
on the week's highest-stakes advertising day.
   The Post is confident about its debut Sunday; its competitors are
ready and waiting.
   ``When you see this paper on Saturday night, it's going to look
like a Sunday paper that's been around for 30, 40 years,'' promised
Peter Kalikow, the real estate magnate who saved the Post from
extinction one year ago with a $37 million takeover.
   ``The sections are right, the comics are right, the magazine is
right. It's really there.''
   To let the public know its plans, the Post put commercials on
television and a clever full-page advertisement Friday in one of its
competitors, The New York Times.
   The Times ad, in the form of two tabloid-size pages on the back
of Times' front section, could be folded to simulate the Post's
front and back pages.
   A banner news headline in the ad said it was ``Announcing A Cure
For The Common Sunday.'' Another headline over what would be the
sports page reads, ``Post Goes To Game 7!''
   Industry analysts question if the financing and the market are
right. They predict the Post's move to Sunday _ where a successful
newspaper makes 40 percent to 50 percent of its advertising money _
could mean the demise of at least one of the tabloids.
   ``The question is whether this market is capable of supporting
three daily tabloids. Ask God and the readers,'' said Daily News
Editor F. Gilman Spencer. ``This one is in stable shape, without any
question. ... We're in good shape to take on all comers.''
   Kalikow, on the eve of running out 575,000 copies of the Sunday
Post, believes three tabloids can live happily ever after in New
York. Ad space for the first three weeks in the 128-page paper is
sold out, including space in the pull-out book and travel sections,
Kalikow said.
   He also cites changes recently made in the competition's Sunday
editions as evidence his paper is already a factor: the News'
expanded sports page, Newsday's additional color pages. Spencer and
Newsday Associate Publisher Steven Isenberg said those moves were in
works before the Post went weekend.
   None of this is expected to affect The New York Times or its
massive Sunday edition. The Times can ``stand back and wait, and
then see who's left,'' said industry analyst John Morton.
   But while Kalikow is confident, others in the industry remain
skeptical. The last time the Post had a Sunday edition was during a
newspaper strike in 1978. It was scrapped when the strike ended.
   ``So far, there does not appear to be room for three profitable
daily tabloids; that's certainly the same for Sunday,'' said
newspaper analyst Bruce Thorp of the Provident National Bank. ``I'm
not convinced there's room for two profitable daily tabloids.''
   Agreed Morton, ``The problem is you've got a town that probably
can't support that many newspapers. New York is probably the last
remaining city with the market segmentation to support two
newspapers.
   ``But three or four, in the long run, is probably not do-able.''
   The Post runs third in the city circulation race, trailing the
Daily News (1,281,706) and The New York Times (1,038,829) and
leading New York Newsday (176,043), according to the Audit Bureau of
Circulations figures from Sept 30, 1988. Kalikow anticipates a
similar Sunday showing.
   Morton and Thorp cited other problems the Post faces: lack of
home delivery (Kalikow says a major push to change that is under
way.); overcoming Sunday readership loyalty (Kalikow believes the
paper's 550,473 weekday readers will buy the Post.); tremendous
start-up costs (Kalikow, without mentioning figures, says the Sunday
paper is here to stay.).
   Here for the paper's first 12 weeks is a reader inducement _ a $1
million stock market game which also will run in weekdays.
   More likely to draw readers are the changes wrought at the Post
under editor Jane Amsterdam in the year since Kalikow's purchase of
the paper, which was founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton.
   Gone are many of the Rupert Murdoch flourishes which marked his
reign at the Post: no more ``HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR''
headlines, no unchallenged liberal-bashing, no jam-packed pages
desperate for space.
   ``Things have improved on a financial basis, the morale has
improved, the quality of the paper has improved,'' Kalikow said.
``Things have really improved far beyond what we had ever expected.''

<TEXT>
   A laughing Donald Trump accused New York Post
publisher Peter Kalikow on Thursday of beating up on him in the
newspaper, persuading Trump to buy advertising while his reporters
write unflattering stories.
   ``You son of a gun, you're killing me,'' Trump said at a
breakfast at the Republican National Convention. ``Rupert, come
back!''
   Trump was called to the microphone by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, who
was being honored by the New York GOP delegation. Kalikow, who
bought the financially ailing paper in March from publisher Rupert
Murdoch, was sitting nearby.
   When Trump launched into a comical monologue about the Post,
aiming his comments at Kalikow, he sounded half-serious. Kalikow
laughed but looked uncomfortable.
   Post editor Jane Amsterdam said Trump had not tried to
strong-arm the Post into going easier on him.
   ``I don't think the Post can be muscled,'' she said from New
York City. ``He's entitled to react to the New York Post any way he
wants to. The Post is fair and it's tough and it's generally very
good. ... And he's a big boy.''

   The editor of Manhattan, inc. magazine and two top staffers resigned yesterday after disputes with the magazine's owner and publisher, D. Herbert Lipson.

   A spokeswoman for Jane Amsterdam, editor since the monthly's launch 2 1/2 years ago, said Ms. Amsterdam resigned along with the managing editor, Duncan Stalker, and the art director, Nancy Butkus.

   None of the three could be reached for comment, and the spokeswoman declined to elaborate.
But Ron Javers, vice president of Mr. Lipson's company, Metrocorp, said, "It was really a clash of management styles between Jane Amsterdam and Herbert Lipson."
He also declined to elaborate, and he said successors would be named shortly.

   Mr. Lipson is a big player in the city magazine business.
He owns Philadelphia and Boston magazines and recently acquired Atlanta magazine.

   Manhattan, inc. is considered among the more successful new city business publications.
The magazine has won a number of editorial awards, including a 1985 National Magazine Award, and has had a steady growth in advertising revenue, according to Media Industry Newsletter's editor, Steven Cohn.
The magazine's advertising revenue is currently up 11% from last year's level.

   "It's been going great guns from the start," Mr. Cohn said, adding that the news of Ms. Amsterdam's departure "is very surprising."

   The New York Post plans to close down its Sunday edition after launching it just eight months ago with much fanfare.

   Peter Kalikow, owner and publisher of the Post, announced that he would discontinue the edition, which he initially started in the hopes of luring upscale readers and retail advertisers that shunned the more sensational tabloid in favor of the New York Times and the Daily News.

   Industry observers and analysts still are unsure whether folding the Sunday Post will guarantee that the paper will survive.
When Rupert Murdoch sold the paper to Mr. Kalikow, it was posting losses of $10 million a year by conservative estimates.
In its first 10 weeks, the Sunday edition alone was estimated to have recorded a deficit of as much as $7 million.

   Mr. Kalikow and Editor Jerry Nachman assembled employees in the paper's newsroom in lower Manhattan yesterday afternoon to break the news, which had been rumored in recent weeks.
Post executives had denied earlier reports that the Sunday edition was closing down.

   Mr. Kalikow said the death of the Sunday paper is no indication that the Post itself is in danger of closing down, as some industry observers have speculated.
By closing down the Sunday Post, he said in a statement, the Post "foresees a profitable year in 1990."
The Post's last Sunday edition will be Nov. 26.

   Mr. Kalikow blamed the demise of the Sunday Post on the soft ad market in the New York area and on low circulation.
"The economics just aren't there," he said.

   While there has been a wave of new Sunday newspapers launched in small to medium-sized cities in the last decade, the Post was by far the largest newspaper to launch a Sunday edition in years.
While Post executives had expected circulation would reach 500,000, Valerie Salembier, president of the Post, said the Sunday circulation has reached only about 250,000.

   "In any other city, 250,000 would be considered great, but it just wasn't enough in New York," said Ms. Salembier.

   Ms. Salembier said about 30 people in circulation, ad sales and other business departments would lose their jobs.
"What we don't know about is the number of layoffs on the editorial side," she said.
"The editorial side is more complicated," she added, saying that editorial layoffs will be announced later.

   The paper has been particularly hurt by declines in the level of real estate and retail advertising, and by the fact that the Sunday paper could not attract any coupons from national companies.
In late September, the paper announced its was canceling its weekly real estate section.
The section had shrunk from more than 20 pages to six pages recently as a result of declines in advertising.

   Months earlier, Mr. Kalikow had already begun to scale back the Sunday Post.
In May, the Post said it would scratch all supplements in the Sunday edition, including USA Weekend magazine, and cut the $1 price to 40 cents.

   Ms. Salembier said closing the Sunday paper was a "big disappointment" but the right move.
"We were losing a lot of money.
While Peter {Kalikow} has deep pockets, it makes sense to put our resources into our Monday through Saturday product," she said.

   John Canning, managing editor of the New York
Post since 1980 and a journalist for more than 35 years, died while
on vacation in Ixtapa, Mexico. He was 56.
   Friends said Canning died Sunday of complications from a bleeding
ulcer after suffering a heart attack in his hotel room, according to
Eric Fettmann, assistant city editor.
   Canning was on vacation with his wife and another couple.
   Canning got his start in journalism in his native New Zealand. In
1955, he moved to Australia and worked for the Sydney Sun before
joining Rupert Murdoch's Sydney Daily Mirror in the 1960s.
   Canning was named editor of the Daily Mirror in 1978 but before
the appointment took effect he was sent to New York temporarily to
work on Murdoch papers and wound up staying here. He was named
managing editor of the weekly tabloid The Star before taking the
same position at the Post in 1980.
   The Post was sold to real estate developer Peter S. Kalikow
earlier this year.
   ``John Canning was a great editor and beloved friend to all of
us,'' said New York Post Editor Jane Amsterdam. ``His contribution
to this paper was enormous. John's intelligence and wit were
displayed to our readers each day on the front page. He will be
sorely missed.''
   As managing editor, Canning's major responsibility was designing
the paper's daily front page.
   Canning, who lived in Guttenberg, N.J., is survived by his wife,
Odette, and by a son, Simon, from a previous marriage.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

   The new owner of the New York Post spent Sunday
talking with advisers about how to improve the prospects for
survival of the nation's oldest continuously published daily
newspaper, his spokesman said.
   One Post employee called it ``the $22 million question'' _
whether multimillionaire businessman Peter Kalikow, aided by
financial concessions by the Post's unions, will be able to stem
the tabloid's flow of red ink.
   Equally intriguing was whether the real estate developer would
tone down a sometimes sensationalistic style of journalism that has
titillated, outraged, amused and generally entertained readers for
more than a decade.
   Kalikow will take over the Post for $37.6 million on March 7,
pending rank-and-file ratification of the concessions and
verification by his accountants of the details.
   The sale of the paper by owner Rupert Murdoch cleared its final
hurdle early Saturday when leaders of the newspaper's 10 unions
agreed to the $22 million in concessions to keep it alive. Union
members were expected to ratify the agreements this week.
   Now Kalikow has to do is figure out how to turn around one of
the biggest money losers in the newspaper business.
   The Post lost about $17 million before taxes last year, and
about a quarter of its advertising in the last few months.
   Its circulation has dropped from 700,000 to 500,000, partly
because of a retrenchment in areas outside metropolitan New York.
   Kalikow spent the day talking to advisers about ways to improve
the Post's prospects, according to Howard J. Rubenstein, his
spokesman.
   The 45-year-old businessman, estimated to be worth about $500
million, has approved a $2 million promotional campaign for the
newspaper and is scheduling luncheon meetings with leading
advertisers and community and business leaders, Rubenstein said. He
also plans meetings with Mayor Edward I. Koch and Gov. Mario Cuomo
to discuss his plans for the Post.
   Despite Kalikow's many other business interests, ``He's going to
be a very active owner,'' Rubenstein said.
   Under his contract with Murdoch, Kalikow promised to operate the
paper for at least one year.
   Rubenstein said Kalikow was considering making the Post strictly
a morning paper, and denied that Kalikow was leaning toward an
afternoon-only paper with a smaller circulation and a higher price.
   Despite its down-scale reputation, a $1 million marketing study
commissioned by Kalikow ``shows the paper already appeals to a
fairly well-to-do audience,'' Rubenstein said.
   Kalikow is widely thought to want to back away from the paper's
emphasis on stories of sex, crime and scandal. The Post will remain
a tabloid, but ``there will be a change in format,'' Rubenstein
said. ``There'll be changes in headlines, in the front page, in the
emphasis of the paper.''
   But, Rubenstein added, the paper's new owner ``still wants it to
be feisty and provocative.''
   The specifics, he said, were being worked out by Kalikow and
Frank Devine, who is staying on as executive editor.

   The publisher of TV Guide, Valerie B. Salembier,
has been named president of the New York Post, Post owner Peter S.
Kalikow said Wednesday.
   Peter Price quit as publisher to become a partner in an
international television and radio company, Kalikow said Monday.
Kalikow, who bought the money-losing paper a year ago from Rupert
Murdoch, noted that during Price's tenure the paper added a Sunday
edition.
   Ms. Salembier, a former senior vice president of advertising at
USA Today, will assume Price's responsibilities, said Emory
Edwards, a spokesman for the Post. She will supervise business,
advertising and circulation.
   Ms. Salembier takes over Kalikow's former title of president,
while Kalikow assumes the title of publisher and retains his
position as chairman of the board, Edwards said.
   Ms. Salembier, 43, became publisher of TV Guide in October when
the magazine was acquired by the News Corporation of America.
   ``I am thrilled with the opportunity to go back into the daily
newspaper business,'' Ms. Salembier said in a statement. ``The
potential for growth at the Post is terrific, and it's the perfect
vehicle for a great many new advertisers.''

<HEAD>Kalikow, Murdoch Complete Agreement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The New York Post has officially become the
property of real estate developer Peter Kalikow, who paid $37.6
million for the tabloid that has been losing money and circulation
for years.
   ``It is my intention to stop the financial losses of the New
York Post,'' Kalikow said Monday in a statement after the papers
transferring ownership were signed. ``The paper will be a winner
financially and editorially.''
   Kalikow acquired the Post after the paper's 10 unions agreed to
a $22 million in concessions, which included a last-minute $3
million gift from then-owner Rupert Murdoch.
   ``The rescue of the Post is nothing less than an historic
moment,'' Kalikow said.
   ``There was not one person involved in negotiations that did not
go the extra mile in an effort to keep this great New York
institution from disappearing. I want to thank all of our unions
and employees for their heroic efforts.''
   Union leaders were to sign formal papers today and planned to
meet with Kalikow on Thursday to ``get to know each other,'' said
George McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades Council,
which represents eight of the unions.
   ``We're delighted, really delighted, glad it's all over.''
   Murdoch, who sold the paper to comply with federal regulations
barring ownership of two media outlets in one city, claimed he was
losing $100,000 a day on the Post and lost $150 million in the 12
years he owned it.
   Kalikow has pledged $2 million to promote the newspaper.
   ``I am committed to expanding its readership base through
millions of dollars in promotion, adding features to the paper,
greatly expanding its investigative reporting and strengthening its
advertising revenues to make the paper profitable on a long-term
basis.''
   Under Murdoch, whom Kalikow called ``one of the great
contemporary publishers,'' the tabloid had a reputation for
sensational coverage, with blaring headlines and plenty of gossip.
   New publisher Peter Price said ``my role is to make it work.
   ``I think Peter Kalikow has made an enormous financial
commitment and it's my challenge and opportunity to put the pieces
together and make a real business out of the Post and not just a
good newspaper,'' Price said.
   Spokesman Howard Rubenstein declined to say what specific
changes Kalikow and Price would make in the appearance and content
of the Post, the nation's oldest continuously published daily
newspaper, founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton.
   Price, however, noted that ``the big difference between what we
are able to do versus what others before us have tried to do is
that Peter Kalikow and I share a sense of the city.
   ``We are both single-minded about the New York Post. We are both
single-minded about making this paper a permanent fixture in the
New York City scene.''

   Publisher Peter Price has left the New York Post
just one year after joining a team that saved the morning tabloid
from the threat of closure.
   The paper's owner, real estate developer Peter Kalikow, said
Monday he accepted the resignation ``with regret'' and was taking
over the duties of publisher. A spokesman wouldn't say how long
Kalikow planned to serve as published.
   Price said he would be forming a partnership with Univisa, an
international company that produces and distributes television and
radio programming.
   Kalikow named Price as publisher last year after buying the
morning tabloid from Rupert Murdoch, saving the money-losing paper
from closing.
   Price said he was leaving the Post in good shape. The paper
started a Sunday edition last month.
   ``The financial losses have been stemmed and the paper should be
profitable by the end of 1989,'' Price said in a statement. ``Daily
circulation has increased by over 100,000 since the paper was
acquired'' and advertising linage is up.
   Kalikow said Price ``played a key role in taking a nearly
defunct afternoon newspaper with a circulation that had dropped as
low as 2 million a week and bringing it back to a strong newspaper
with a Sunday edition and a weekly circulation of over 4 million.''
   Price joined Time Inc. in 1965 and rose to assistant to the
publisher of Life magazine, circulation manager of Sports
Illustrated and director of corporate development for Time Inc. He
created the upscale Manhattan magazine Avenue in 1976.

   New York Post Publisher Peter Price said Monday
he has quit the morning tabloid to become a partner in an
international television and radio company.
   The move came one year after the Post was saved from a
threatened closing, when real estate developer Peter Kalikow bought
it from Rupert Murdoch and named Price publisher. Four weeks ago
the paper began a Sunday edition.
   Kalikow said in a statement that he accepted the resignation
``with regret'' and said he would immediately assume the duties of
publisher, but a spokesman would not say whether that move was
permanent.
   Kalikow said Price ``did a fantastic job and played a key role
in taking a nearly defunct afternoon newspaper with a circulation
that had dropped as low as 2 million a week and bringing it back to
a strong newspaper with a Sunday edition and a weekly circulation
of over 4 million.''
   Price, who created the upscale Manhattan magazine Avenue, said
he would be forming a partnership with Univisa, an international
company that produces and distributes television and radio
programming.
   ``I have been in the communications business for most of my
professional life,'' his statement said. ``This opportunity will
allow me as a partner in the enterprise to explore a range of new
media ventures.''
   Univisa is the American sister company of Televisa, a Mexico
City-based conglomerate with wide business holdings. It is
privately held and has estimated revenues of more than $600 million
annually, the statement said.
   Price said he was leaving the Post in good shape.
   ``The financial losses have been stemmed and the paper should be
profitable by the end of 1989,'' his statement said. ``Daily
circulation has increased by over 100,000 since the paper was
acquired'' and advertising linage is up.
   Price, a graduate of Princeton University and Yale University's
law school, joined Time Inc. in 1965 and rose to become assistant
to the publisher of Life magazine, circulation manager of Sports
Illustrated and director of corporate development for Time Inc.
   From 1970 to 1976, he and partners formed Media Networks, which
provided advertising services to newspapers, magazines and cable TV
companies.

<TEXT>
   The New York Post, the nation's oldest
continuously published daily newspaper, announced Tuesday it would
start a Sunday edition, just months after it narrowly averted
extinction.
   The tabloid newspaper is to begin a Sunday edition March 5. It
will sell for $1.
   Plans to launch it came after ``repeated requests and offers of
support from our major advertisers and dealers,'' said Peter S.
Kalikow, who bought the Post from Rupert Murdoch in March.
   Kalikow also predicted the Post, after years of losing money,
would begin to show a profit sometime next year. Current losses are
``in a range that are acceptable to me,'' he said, but declined to
provide specifics.
   Kalikow, a real-estate development millionaire, said he would
invest $25 million in the new Sunday edition next year and increase
the paper's staff by about 60 people, including 30 reporters and
editors. He said he expected an initial press run of 500,000 copies
per Sunday.
   The Post was on the verge of ceasing publication until Kalikow
and Murdoch, its owner since 1976, negotiated major concessions and
buyouts from the paper's unions.
   Union reaction to the Sunday edition was favorable, said Tom
Pennacchio, secretary treasurer of the Newspaper Guild, which
represents the Post's editorial staff.
   Although New Yorkers already have their choice of The New York
Times, the Daily News and New York Newsday on Sundays, Kalikow and
Post Publisher Peter Price say there is room for another. The Sunday
Times sells for $1.25 while the Daily News and Newsday sell for $1.
   Kalikow said the Post's losses were a ``minor fraction'' of the
$650,000 per week the tabloid was losing when he purchased it from
Murdoch and that advertising was expanding. Average daily
circulation was about 600,000 during October, he said.
   Eric Philo, an analyst who follows the newspaper industry for the
investment firm Goldman, Sachs, said he didn't see a place in the
city's highly competitive newspaper market for another Sunday paper
and predicted it would only increase the financial drain on the Post.

   The New York Post says it will intensify New
York's heated newspaper competition by launching a Sunday edition.
   The owner of the spirited morning tabloid that came close to
extinction earlier this year said Tuesday he wants to compete seven
days a week with The New York Times, the Daily News and Newsday.
   The Sunday edition, complete with color comics and a magazine
supplement, is scheduled to make its debut March 5 and sell for $1.
   The decision for the project came after ``repeated requests and
offers of support from our major advertisers and dealers,'' Post
owner Peter S. Kalikow said.
   The millionaire real estate developer also predicted that the
Post, after years of losses, would show a profit next year.
   Current losses are ``a minor fraction'' of the ``$650,000 a week
when we bought the paper last March'' from Rupert Murdoch, he said
at a news conference. He declined to provide specific numbers.
   Kalikow said he would invest $25 million in the Sunday edition
and increase the paper's staff by about 60, including 30 reporters
and editors.
   An initial press run of 500,000 copies was expected, he said.
   Newspaper analyst John Morton called it a ``bold move, but one I
think they had to make if they want to make the Post a viable
enterprise.''
   ``In successful newspapers _ which the Post is not _ Sunday
papers account for 40 to 50 percent of revenue,'' he said. The
danger is that advertisers won't increase their Post advertising
budgets, but spread them thinner to cover an additional day, he said.
   However, Eric Philo, an analyst for the investment firm Goldman,
Sachs, said he didn't see a place for another Sunday paper in New
York and predicted it only would increase the financial drain on the
Post.
   Union reaction was favorable.
   ``I get the impression that (Kalikow's) here to stay over the
long haul,'' said Tom Pennacchio, secretary treasurer of the
Newspaper Guild, which represents the Post's editorial staff.
   Pennacchio said he earlier joined others in believing Kalikow was
more interested in the Post's valuable lower Manhattan property than
the paper itself.
   The Post, the nation's oldest continuously published daily
newspaper, was on the verge of ceasing publication when Kalikow and
Murdoch negotiated major concessions and buyouts from the paper's
unions.
   Since then, Kalikow said, ``Both the financial as well as the
editorial aspects of the paper have improved far beyond our
expectations, and therefore we've moved up the Sunday publication
from a date some time in our original plans of 1991 to 1989.''

   The scrappy New York Post, colorful chronicler
of a troubled city, survived its own brush with extinction Monday
after its biggest union agreed to concessions to save the publisher
money.
   Members of the Newspaper Guild, representing 350 editorial,
advertising and clerical employees, voted 242-45 to approve
concessions including eliminating dozens of jobs and cutting the
workweek to four days with a 20 percent pay cut. A last-minute
sweetener offered by Publisher Peter S. Kalikow would boost
severence pay for those who agree to resign.
   Kalikow had said he would close the nation's oldest continuously
published daily and put nearly 1,000 people out of work if the
Guild rejected the offer.
   ``Let's go to press,'' Kalikow said after the vote.
   ``This is not a management victory,'' he added. ``It is not a
labor victory. It is a victory for all New Yorkers who deserve the
honesty and diversity offered in the pages of the New York Post.''
   The Guild was the last of the paper's 11 unions to reach
agreement with Kalikow on a total package of $27 million in cost
cuts.
   The vote followed a 90-minute meeting punctuated by boos,
applause, and speeches.
   ``You feel like the executioner has loosened the noose,'' said
Jill Brooke, who reports on TV and radio issues. ``But we still
have a life sentence: a 20 percent pay cut.''
   ``We accepted a package that none of us liked, we accepted a
package that made no sense to any of us and we accepted a package
that makes us less than middle class,'' said reporter Peter Moses,
who nonetheless voted for approval. ``We went from the outhouse to
the tree.''
   Editor Jerry Nachman said he was overwhelmed by gratitude.
   ``They have taken a great sacrifice in order to preserve their
careers in New York journalism, their colleagues' careers and an
important New York institution,'' Nachman said.
   Union members said sentiment swung in favor of the plan Monday
afternoon when Kalikow offered to ``buy out'' those who agreed to
resign. The publisher said employees could approve the plan, then
resign by Wednesday night and receive the same termination and
severance pay as if the paper were shut down.
   Some employees had argued earlier that they might be better off
voting against the deal and taking the severance and termination
money that would come with the newspaper folding.
   ``That takes away the principal reason for a no vote,''
metropolitan editor John Cotter said of the sweetened offer before
Monday night's meeting.
   Theodore Kheel, an adviser to the unions, also said the Post
would not stick to its requirement that 43 jobs be severed, but
would settle for whatever number of resignations were forthcoming.
   At a news conference after the vote, Guild president Barry
Lipton said he didn't know how many would resign.
   Kalikow also has promised the unions 20 percent of the company's
stock and a representative on the board of directors.
   Kalikow said he had to have the union concessions to cut back on
losses now running at about $27 million on an annual basis. He is
believed to have lost more than $100 million personally on the
paper.
   By Friday night, negotiators for the Post's 10 other unions had
reached agreement with the company. The Guild's negotiating
committee rejected Kalikow's offer 7-3, but local president Barry
Lipton endorsed it and had it put up to a vote of the members.
   The package includes about $19 million in union concessions and
$8 million in other cost reductions, including management wage
cuts.
   Monday's front page asked: ``WILL THE POST PRESSES EVER RUN
AGAIN?''
   On the street before the vote, New Yorkers thought about life
without the city's feistiest tabloid.
   ``I love the Post. I don't like to see it go,'' said Joseph
Yedid. But he sympathized with Kalikow: ``This is New York. You
always look out for your own interests.''
   The Post was founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton and a group
of merchants. The paper had money troubles from the start, but its
fortunes seemed to have dimmed for good in the 1970's as much of
its audience moved to the suburbs.
   Australian media baron Rupert Murdoch took over in 1976 and
transformed the Post from a liberal into a politically conservative
tabloid, albeit one that featured sexy pictures, racy headlines -
like the famous ``HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR'' - and lots of
crime stories.
   Murdoch said the paper lost $150 million before he sold it in
1988 for $37 million to Kalikow, a real estate developer who also
acquired the paper's valuable waterfront land on South Street in
lower Manhattan.
   Under Kalikow, the paper has never made money and suffered heavy
lossess on an ill-fated Sunday edition launched for a brief period
in 1989. Recently, the slump has deepened as an economic decline in
the New York City further cut advertising revenues.

   The New York Post will add some panache to its
blue-collar image built on sex and crime, the tabloid's new
publisher promised Friday.
   ``We don't want to emasculate the New York Post,'' Peter O.
Price told the City Club, a civic group. But he added: ``Our
challenge is to make the New York Post noticed for the right
reasons and not for the wrong reasons.''
   The improved Post, he said, will aim for depth in its writing, a
Manhattan focus, an even beefier sports section and more positive
stories about education and race relations. It might also launch a
Sunday edition, he said.
   The Post, the nation's oldest continuously published daily
newspaper, officially became the property of developer Peter
Kalikow on Monday.
   Australian-born newspaper baron Rupert Murdoch, who had owned it
since 1976, sold the money-losing tabloid to comply with federal
regulations barring ownership of a TV station and a newspaper in
the same city. Murdoch owns WNYW.
   ``Murdoch's Post was loud, lively and controversial. His British
tabloid style relied heavily upon sex, crime and violence,'' Price
said. ``Many advertisers ... refused to place ads in the newspaper,
which they considered out of step with the image they were trying
to portray.''
   Price said the emphasis on what some regard as ``terribly lurid
things'' is ``perhaps not so bad as people may think.''
   ``The pulse of journalism in the New York Post is that sense of
the city, that savvy, provocative, bold quality that's very often
talked about pejoratively because of Rupert Murdoch,'' he said.
   ``It very often gets people upset. But it certainly does not go
unnoticed. Our challenge is to make the New York Post noticed for
the right reasons and not for the wrong reasons.''
   Kalikow paid $37.6 million for the paper, which has been losing
money and circulation for years. It was founded in 1801 by
Alexander Hamilton.
   Kalikow acquired the Post only after the paper's 10 unions
agreed to a $22 million package of concessions, including a
last-minute gift of $3 million from Murdoch.

   New York Post owner Rupert Murdoch and the newspaper's labor unions agreed after tense negotiations to cost cuts, clearing the way for sale of the severely ailing tabloid to Peter S. Kalikow for $37 million.

   But the 45-year-old real estate developer, who has no publishing experience, faces a difficult task of rebuilding the Post's readership and attracting advertisers when he assumes ownership in two weeks.
On Friday, Mr. Murdoch said the tabloid was posting daily losses of $100,000.

   The accord reached by Mr. Murdoch and the unions will make Mr. Kalikow's labor costs $22 million lower over the next three years compared with what Mr. Murdoch is paying now.
The plan will remove 130 workers from the Post's work force of 1,200.
In addition, the unions agreed to a pay cut for the remaining workers in the first year followed by raises in the second and third years.
But Mr. Murdoch, to win union approval, agreed to reimburse them for their pay cuts at a cost to him of $3 million.

   Under the sales agreement, Mr. Kalikow could abandon his efforts in a year and shut down the 187-year-old daily.
But Peter O. Price, whom Mr. Kalikow has named as publisher, predicted yesterday, "It can be turned around and made profitable within a few years."
The new owner plans to "redefine" the tabloid's look with bolder graphics and pay big-name magazine sports, entertainment and news reporters to contribute articles, said Mr. Price, chairman of Avenue magazine, a tony magazine distributed for free in New York's affluent upper East Side.
"We're going to provide more depth to the news" and retain the Post's "feisty, street smart kind of image," he said.

   Mr. Price said Mr. Kalikow will spend $5 million annually to upgrade and promote the paper.
It will be marketed largely as an afternoon paper for yuppies: middle-class to upper-middle-class younger men and women who, said Mr. Price, "are looking for information that is alive, immediate, bold and provocative."

   Mr. Murdoch had to sell the Post to comply with a federal rule barring single ownership of a paper and broadcasting outlet in the same city.
He owns WNEW-TV in New York.

   Mr. Kalikow agreed to buy the Post only if Mr. Murdoch extracted the concessions.
The Australian-born publisher had vowed to close the paper at 2 p.m. Friday if the unions hadn't agreed to concessions by then.
He backed down, however, when the deadline came and the unions had agreed to only $19 million and were insisting on a wage increase.
Talks continued into the wee hours of Saturday before the two sides reached the settlement.

   "The agreement isn't perfect, but it assures that the paper will exist for at least another year," said Barry Lipton, president of the New York branch of the Newspaper Guild.

   Mr. Kalikow is already preparing to spend $2 million to promote the Post on TV and perhaps on the exterior of New York transit buses, said Mr. Price.
The new owner and Mr. Price also plan to draw on their extensive contacts in the business community, particularly the real estate industry and retailers.
"Real estate advertising can be very significant," said a spokesman.
"And the brokers earmark a great deal of money on each project for advertising."

   British press baron Robert Maxwell, publisher-developer Leonard Stern, two New York real estate tycoons and the owner of a newspaper aimed at blacks submitted formal offers for the New York Post last Friday.

   But owner Rupert Murdoch, who faces a March 6 deadline to dispose of the tabloid, said the bidders were interested in the paper's real estate and not in continuing its operations.
He has vowed to close it if he doesn't get an acceptable price.

   The real estate is the property and building where the paper is published.
The site is on the East River in lower Manhattan and has been valued in the area of $38 million.

   Separately, Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan (D., N.Y.) is expected today to introduce legislation to give Mr. Murdoch more time to sell the Post.
Also, a Washington federal appeals court set a schedule to consider Mr. Murdoch's appeal of a rejection by the Federal Communications Commission of his request to extend the deadline.

   The bids apparently ranged from $30 million to $35 million, significantly below the $45 million to $50 million Mr. Murdoch wants.
In a statement, Mr. Murdoch said they were all "highly conditional and include requests for unspecified further reductions in labor costs."
The prospective buyers "have so far expressed an interest in the real estate value . . . where the newspaper is published," he said.
"If the value of the real estate were removed, there would be no offer of significance for the newspaper alone.
We are still hoping to receive such an offer."

   Mr. Maxwell made an offer through his financial adviser, Rothschild Inc.

   Peter Kalikow, a real estate developer, submitted a bid, said his spokesman Martin McLaughlin.
Real estate developer Arthur Cohen said he and real estate developer Philip Pilevsky jointly bid.
And Wilbert A. Tatum, chairman of the New York Amsterdam News, which circulates primarily among blacks, also made an offer, said his adviser, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.

   "We made a very serious offer," said Mr. McLaughlin, the spokesman for Mr. Kalikow.
"We intend to run the Post as a New York daily for a long time to come."

   Leonard Stern, president of Hartz Mountain Corp. and owner of the Village Voice, said yesterday that he plans to contact union officials today for discussions.
Mr. Stern said yesterday, "We have absolutely no interest in the real estate."

   The FCC's cross-ownership rule prohibits a person or company from owning a newspaper and broadcast outlet in the same city.
Mr. Murdoch also owns a TV station in New York.
Under an existing waiver, he has until March 6 to sell the Post, which had a deficit last year of $17 million.
In Boston, he owns the Boston Herald and a television station.
He must shed one of the properties by June 30.

   The New York Post will launch its Sunday edition on March 5 with a budget of $30 million and an additional 60 employees.

   At a news conference, Post owner Peter Kalikow also said the Post, which he acquired in March from Rupert Murdoch, should move into the black at some point next year.
But Mr. Kalikow, a New York real estate developer, said he didn't know if the paper would post earnings for the full year.
The Post's publisher, Peter O. Price, said he expects the Sunday edition to increase total revenue by 20% to 30% in 1989.

   Mr. Kalikow said he had originally planned to introduce a Sunday edition in 1991 but moved up the launch date because of the tabloid's performance since he acquired it last March.
Total advertising linage climbed to 16,000 inches in September from 10,000 last March, Mr. Kalikow said.
He added that weekly losses have shrunk substantially from the $650,000 weekly deficits the paper was posting in March, but Mr. Kalikow didn't provide details.

   The Post said its Sunday edition will include expanded news, sports and arts coverage; a TV and entertainment guide; and USA Today Weekend, a Sunday supplement magazine.

   Currently, the Post has about 1,000 employees.

   Manhattan, inc. and M Plan to Unite
   As New Capital Cities-Owned Magazine

   NEW YORK -- Manhattan, inc. and M magazine, battered by
losses and an industrywide advertising slump, are banding
together in an unusual merger to form a new magazine dubbed M
inc.
   Financial terms of the merger weren't disclosed, but the
new magazine will be owned by M publisher Fairchild
Publications, a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.; it will
target affluent male readers, something both magazines have
done with only limited success.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   D. Herbert Lipson, chairman of Metrocorp, publisher of
Manhattan, inc., will be president of M inc, and will retain
what he called a "significant" interest. Clay Felker, a
veteran magazine editor who is editor of Manhattan, inc., has
been given the title of editor-at-large. He will work on
developing the new magazine under Jane F. Lane, who will be
the new editor of M inc. Ms. Lane had been editor in chief of
M.
   Magazine mergers are rare, and this one was greeted with
skepticism by advertising agency executives. "It sounds weird
to me," said Valerie Muller, media director of Pedone &amp;
Partners agency. "Neither has had tremendous success. Just
how many readers from each magazine will follow the new one?"
   Advertising executives also noted that M inc is just the
latest entry in a rush of new men's general interest
magazines. "There is a lot of attention now on the male
reader, but there is no research yet to show that real reader
support is there," said Paul DuCharme, media director at Grey
Advertising. "This is not a marriage made in heaven."
   Mr. Lipson said the new magazine will combine both "the
life-style features of M and the business orientation of
Manhattan, inc." Both companies claim the new magazine will
deliver the "best upscale male demographics in publishing
today." The average income of the M magazine reader is
$138,000; of Manhattan, inc., $226,000.
   "If we do this thing right, maybe we can kickstart the new
magazine," added Phillip J. Meek, president of Fairchild
Publications.
   But M inc represents a marriage of publishing also-rans.
Neither magazine is profitable, and both have suffered steady
declines in advertising pages for more than a year. M,
launched by Fairchild in 1983, is largely a fashion and
life-style magazine that has been a perennial third behind
Hearst Corp.'s Esquire, and Conde Nast Publications Inc.'s
GQ. M's circulation is currently about 152,000.
   Manhattan, inc. was launched by the Philadelphia-based
Metrocorp in 1984; it was considered a promising, savvy new
magazine under its founding editor Jane Amsterdam. But after
her departure, which followed disputes with Mr. Lipson,
Manhattan, inc. has steadily lost advertising since 1987. Its
circulation has risen to more than 110,000, due largely to
direct mail campaigns offering the magazine at cut-rate
subscription prices.
   Manhattan, inc. won't publish an August issue. Fairchild
will introduce the first combined issue in September with a
guaranteed circulation base to advertisers of 200,000.
   The merger follows rumors that Mr. Lipson would be faced
with closing down the money-losing Manhattan, inc. "I have
lost a lot of money on Manhattan, inc.," Mr. Lipson
acknowledged, adding that he had been seeking an investor.
   Industry experts estimate Mr. Lipson has lost as much as
$10 million on the magazine in recent years. The merger
doesn't affect Mr. Lipson's other Metrocorp properties, the
profitable Boston and Philadelphia city magazines.
   While M inc was portrayed by executives from both
companies as an equal merging of the magazines' staff and
editorial content, it appears to be weighted heavily toward
Fairchild's M. Michael F. Coady, Fairchild senior vice
president, said details of merging the sales and editorial
staffs are still being worked out, but sources close to the
magazines said the Manhattan, inc. editorial staff of about
27 would be cut in half.
   One of M inc's competitors is being started by a
Manhattan, inc. editor. Peter W. Kaplan, editorial director
of Manhattan, inc. will be the editor of Men, a new magazine
from Norris Publishing scheduled to debut by the end of this
year.

<HEAD>Tabloid Newspaper Workers Resign, Take Sweetened Severance Package</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The publisher who threatened to close the New
York Post unless unions accepted $19 million in job and wage cuts
predicted Tuesday that profits will soon begin rolling in.
   More than 30 employees resigned and took sweetened severage
packages the day after the union holding up the concession deal
voted to take the cuts. Those leaving will get standard severance
pay, along with two months pay they would have received if the
189-year-old paper had shut down.
   Publisher Peter S. Kalikow, surrounded by union leaders and Post
managers, said he expected the tabloid known for racy headlines and
focus on urban crime to turn a profit by Oct. 1. If his prediction
is correct, it would be the first time since the 1970s the paper
became profitable.
   Kalikow said the Post has been losing about $27 million a year.
To secure $19 million in union concessions, he promised the unions
20 percent of company stock and a representative on the board of
directors.
   The remaining $8 million will be saved by other operating cost
reductions, including management wage cuts.
   At a news conference in his office, he thanked those assembled
for helping him save the nation's oldest continuously published
daily paper.
   ``We sat in meetings with these guys, we sat in halls, we sat in
bathrooms with them. They did a fabulous job,'' Kalikow said, also
thanking more than 100 departing employees and the hundreds who
will make less money.
   ``It's in no small part that we owe these people some thanks for
the sacrifices they made,'' Kalikow said. ``The mortgage rate
didn't go down. The price of food didn't go down. The price of gas
didn't go down.''
   The Newspaper Guild, which represents 350 news, advertising and
clerical staff, voted Monday to accept job reductions and a 20
percent pay cut by switching to a four-day workweek. Top pay for
reporters had been $853 a week.
   Ten other unions accepted concessions Friday.
   Kalikow said all the unions had to agree to concessions or he
would shut down the paper. Two years ago, Kalikow won $24 million
in concessions from the unions as a condition of his purchase of
the Post.
   Some Guild holdouts had said they would rather see the paper
close because they would get severance money and 60 days shut-down
pay. Kalikow countered by offering severance and shut-down pay to
anyone who resigns before 5 p.m. Wednesday.
   Daniel F. Cremins, Post executive vice president, said that in
addition to the Guild offer, four other unions will receive a
similar enhanced departure package.
   More than 30 Guild members had resigned by Tuesday afternoon,
Kalikow spokesman Howard Rubenstein said, adding that an
undisclosed number of executives would be let go and others face
pay cuts.
   ``I can't see going through this again,'' said Henry Scott, 61,
a publications clerk at the Post for 18 years who said he resigned
although his wife is fighting cancer. ``I think it's my best bet to
get out now. I can't take it anymore.''
   He expects to get more than $30,000 plus the 60 days pay.
   Some Post reporters were in tears Tuesday and refused comment.
Colleagues said they were upset because they were resigning.
   ``I have a morale problem right now. They're angry and they have
a right to be,'' said editor Jerry Nachman. In the news business
these days, he said, ``You learn sadly that the operational word is
'business.'''

<HEAD>Post Faces Uncertain Future Under New Owner</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Now that the New York Post has been saved,
readers and employees wonder what the nation's oldest continuously
published newspaper will look like under the new owner, and whether
he'll stop its money-losing ways.
   Peter Kalikow, who is buying the tabloid from Rupert Murdoch for
$37.6 million, spent Sunday talking with advisers about what
direction to take the Post.
   The paper's 10 unions agreed Saturday to $22 million in
concessions that Murdoch and Kalikow said were necessary to keep
the paper alive. That includes eliminating 130 of the Post's 1,200
jobs.
   Kalikow is widely thought to want to back away from the paper's
emphasis on stories of sex, crime and scandal.
   It will remain a tabloid, but ``there will be a change in
format,'' said his spokesman, Howard Rubenstein. ``There'll be
changes in headlines, in the front page, in the emphasis of the
paper.''
   But, Rubenstein added, Kalikow ``still wants it to be feisty and
provocative.''
   Murdoch bought the paper in 1976 and fashioned it after the
British tabloids. Soon readers were seeing such headlines as
``HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR,'' which ran above a story about a
homicide in a tavern.
   They saw a photo of Prince Rainier of Monaco looking into, and
making an obscene hand gesture at, a Post photographer's lens. The
caption read: ``THE PRINCE GIVES US THE FINGER.''
   And then there was the story about Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi's reported psychological problems, featuring a photograph
doctored to show readers what he would look like dressed as a
woman, complete with lipstick and earrings.
   Kalikow, a real estate developer and businessman worth an
estimated $500 million, has approved a $2 million promotional
campaign for the newspaper, said Rubenstein.
   According to his agreement with Murdoch, Kalikow promised to
keep the Post in operation for at least one year after he takes
over March 7.
   The Post lost about $17 million before taxes last year, and
about a quarter of its advertising in the last few months. Its
circulation has dropped from 700,000 to 500,000, partly because of
a retrenchment in areas outside metropolitan New York.
   A $1 million marketing study commissioned by Kalikow ``shows the
paper already appeals to a fairly well-to-do audience,'' Rubenstein
said.

   Daily News Strike Helps Other Tabloids

   Circulation, Ad Rates Jump
   For New York Post, Newsday

   NEW YORK -- The life-threatening strike at the Daily News
is boosting the prospects of tabloid rivals New York Post and
New York Newsday, but the nation's largest newspaper market
appears to be facing permanent shrinkage.
   Both unprofitable and stagnant a few months ago, the Post
and Newsday are now swiftly heading toward profitability as
their circulation and advertising climb. At the same time,
some 200,000 former readers of the Daily News aren't picking
up another newspaper, presumably getting their news from
television.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Newspaper strikes break people's reading habits, and they
find it easy to go without a paper," said John Polich, a
media consultant and Fordham University professor who has
studied the strike. "Even if the News settles the strike, it
can never recover those lost readers."
   Until the start of the strike Oct. 25, the Daily News was
the country's second-largest metropolitan newspaper with 1.1
million readers. Publisher James Hoge said circulation has
dropped to 600,000, though union leaders and publishing
executives say the Daily News is lucky if it sells more than
400,000 copies daily.
   The New York Times, published by New York Times Co., isn't
considered a direct competitor in the tabloid market. It says
it has seen little change in its circulation attributable to
the strike. But Post circulation has jumped to 750,000 from a
stagnant 510,000. And circulation at Times Mirror Co.'s New
York Newsday, which had been sluggish since its 1985 launch,
jumped to 345,000 from 225,000.
   Mr. Hoge said two weeks ago that parent Tribune Co. would
close the 71-year-old Daily News unless a buyer is found or
settlements reached with nine striking unions. The paper is
estimated to be losing nearly $1 million a day, has already
closed its 64-year-old Daily News Sunday Magazine, and has
considered layoffs even among the ranks of replacement
workers. Media bankers and analysts say any new owner would
have to be willing to absorb continuing losses while taking
on the union problem, and spend heavily to restore the
paper's vigor and woo back editorial talent.
   The Daily News's near demise has been most beneficial for
the Post, which has literally risen from the dead. Last
September, the tabloid needed major union wage concessions
just to stay in business. Now Publisher Peter Kalikow fairly
beams at his prospects. Ad pages have grown 2.5 times since
the Daily News strike began, and demand is so high that the
Post has dropped some editorial features to make room for
ads. Mr. Kalikow said the Post had its most profitable months
in years in the fourth quarter. He describes the profit for
the period only as "something less than a million."
   A Sunday New York Post failed in 1989, but Mr. Kalikow
says the Post will come out with a Sunday edition if the
News, which had a 1.4 million Sunday circulation, closes.
Until then, Mr. Kalikow simply watches. "We do nothing until
we know what happens to the Daily News on a permanent basis,"
he says.
   At New York Newsday, meanwhile, ad lineage was declining
prior to the strike, and media analysts pegged the paper's
losses at about $10 million a year. The picture changed
sharply after Oct. 25. Besides daily gains, New York
Newsday's Sunday circulation has jumped a whopping 225,000 to
more than 400,000. Advertising has increased by an average of
140 pages a week from the pre-strike average. Mr. Johnson now
says "prospects look good" for New York Newsday's first
profitable year in 1991.
   According to a study by Mr. Polich at the Fordham
University Graduate School of Business that will be released
this week, the Daily News strike has cost the Daily News 40%
of its readers in the borough of Queens, its traditional
stronghold. In Queens, the Daily News is now second to New
York Newsday, which has added about 30% more weekday readers
and 50% more on Sundays.
   So confident is Newsday that it will keep the circulation
it has won, the ad rate increase guarantees a minimum
circulation for advertisers for one year, a practice used in
magazines but rarely in newspapers.
   The windfall has its drawbacks. New York Newsday is
pulling in more revenue, but costs, including staff overtime,
have risen too. Yet, the longer the strike continues, Times
Mirror executives say that with a higher newsstand price and
new ad rates, they can recover those costs.
   The News has lost some of its best editorial talent to its
two rivals. Robert Johnson, president of New York Newsday and
its Long Island-based parent publication Newsday, has picked
off Daily News columnists Gail Collins and Bill Reel. A Daily
News veteran, Mr. Reel is starting a column focusing on
Brooklyn and Queens, the same turf where Newsday and the
Daily News have waged a fierce circulation battle.
   "The Daily News looks thin," says James Dolan, managing
director of the Jordan Group, a New York media consultant.
"One of Jim {Hoge's} strengths was nurturing a stable of high
profile talent.
   Now he's being robbed of that."
   The biggest catch remains at large: veteran Daily News
gossip columnist Liz Smith, whose column is syndicated to 70
papers. Ms. Smith's contract is up Feb. 14, and Newsday's Mr.
Johnson says he would love to hire her. In 1988, New York
Newsday paid at least $400,000 to lure columnist Jimmy
Breslin from the Daily News.
   At a recent charity gala, Newsday's Mr. Johnson chatted up
Ms. Smith, and in the words of Ms. Smith "he tendered the
idea that they would talk to me if I wanted to talk to them."
Ms. Smith says she will likely not sign another contract, but
that she will stay at the Daily News. "I won't leave this
paper until Jim Hoge leaves it," she says.

   The New York Post screamed the good news.
``AIN'T OVER YET'' read the front page in what could have been the
final edition of the nation's oldest continuously published daily.
   The Post got a temporary reprieve Friday night when all but one
union agreed to $19 million in concessions after more than 12 hours
of negotiations.
   The ultimate fate of the 189-year-old newspaper depends on a
vote Monday by members of The Newspaper Guild. Its negotiating
committee voted 7-3 against the settlement agreed to by bargainers
for 10 other unions.
   ``If the choice is death or three days to live, I'll take three
days,'' said Jerry Nachman, the newspaper's editor.
   Publisher Peter Kalikow is demanding massive concessions to make
the tabloid break even. The newspaper is losing about $27 million a
year.
   The more than 850 Post workers represented by the 10 unions must
ratify the the agreement. The Guild represents 352 reporters and
members of the advertising staff.
   A cheer went up in the newsroom when Kalikow announced in a
televised news conference that the newspaper had at least another
three days.
   Eric Breindel, editorial page editor, said Kalikow had written
two columns for today's newspaper: one celebrating its survival,
one lamenting its demise. On Friday, some Post reporters worked on
``Live Post'' issues while others worked on ``Dead Post'' issues.
   ``We've been through a wringer all day long for a few days and
we're going to have to go through it again,'' said metropolitan
editor John Cotter.
   Cotter said a prepared farewell edition that included
reminiscences from past Post columnists was ``terrific ... but
hopefully it'll never be read by the public.''
   Money troubles are not new to the Post, founded in 1801 by
Alexander Hamilton.
   In 1939, heiress Dorothy Schiff bought the Post and made it one
of the nation's most liberal newspapers. But the Post also became
known for making do with a small staff and old equipment.
   In 1976, Schiff sold the newspaper to Australian media baron
Rupert Murdoch for $31 million. At the time, the newspaper was
losing $500,000 annually.
   Under Murdoch, the Post went conservative editorially and began
running sexy pictures, racy headlines - including the famous
``HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR'' - and a steady diet of crime
stories.
   Murdoch said the newspaper lost $150 million before he sold it
in 1988 for $37 million to Kalikow, a real estate developer who
also acquired the newspaper's valuable waterfront land in Lower
Manhattan.
   The Post said today that Kalikow is demanding that the drivers
union give up 100 of 263 jobs; the 70 printers cut their work week
to four days and the 17 paper handlers give up five jobs.
   The Guild was asked to give up 43 jobs and to agree to a
four-day work week for four days' pay.
   ``I feel optimistic that when the members see it they will
approve it,'' said Kalikow. ``If they turn it down, the paper will
stop publishing immediately.''
   The Daily News, which also is losing money and is in the midst
of a labor conflict, has demanded that any concessions the unions
give the Post must be extended to the News under ``me-too''
contract clauses.
   The New York Times said it would seek union concessions related
to the same economic conditions that have affected the Post and
News and led to declines in ad revenues.

   Manhattan inc. publisher D. Herbert Lipson named Clay Felker editor of the monthly magazine that focuses on business life in the city.

   Mr. Felker, 58 years old, succeeds Jane Amsterdam, who resigned in March along with two top staffers after a dispute with Mr. Lipson over editorial independence.

   Mr. Lipson, who also owns city magazines in Philadelphia, Boston and Atlanta, said he wouldn't expect Mr. Felker to make "massive radical changes" in the magazine.
But he said Mr. Felker, who started work yesterday, may "want to broaden the focus, but always through the lens of Manhattan."

   Manhattan inc., with a circulation of 85,000, is considered among the more successful new city business publications.
The magazine, nearly two years old, has won a number of editorial awards and has had steady growth in advertising revenue.

   Mr. Felker created the prototype city magazine, New York, but has had mixed results with publishing projects since selling that magazine to Rupert Murdoch in 1976.
Among other ventures, he bought Esquire magazine, which he sold after heavy losses.

   He was editor of the short-lived Tonight edition of New York's Daily News.
Recently, he was consulting editor to U.S. News &amp; World Report magazine.

   Mr. Felker said he wouldn't have any problems working with Mr. Lipson.
Mr. Lipson concurred.
"My relationship with Clay will be same as with Jane.
The editor will have total control."

   NEW YORK -- The Newspaper Guild voted overwhelmingly to
accept New York Post owner Peter S. Kalikow's proposal of
wage-and-benefit cuts to keep the 189-year-old tabloid in
business.
   After a loud and emotional meeting that lasted for two
hours, Guild members, made up largely of editors, reporters
and advertising staff, voted 242-45 to approve concessions,
which call for a four-day workweek, a 20% cut in salary and
the elimination of dozens of jobs. Ten other newspaper unions
are expected to approve similar cuts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If the proposal had been rejected, Mr. Kalikow vowed to
shut down the paper with a final edition for today. Folding
the paper would have put 960 people out of work. Mr. Kalikow
has sought $27 million in cost cuts so the paper can break
even in 1990.
   Later this week, Mr. Kalikow and the unions are expected
to sign a new three-year contract. "Three years, for the Post
that's a long time," said Paul Tharp, a Post reporter after
emerging from the union hall in Manhattan.
   Though many union members said they were against cutting
their own pay and workweek, they were swayed by a last-minute
sweetener by Mr. Kalikow to boost severance pay for those who
agree to resign. At the Guild meeting, several members spoke
out saying they would approve the contract but they would
take the buyout. Mr. Kalikow has also promised the unions 20%
of the company's stock and a representative on the board.
   The settlement at the Post is expected to put pressure on
Tribune Co.'s Daily News, which is in the midst of stalled
and bitter negotiations with its unions. The Daily News,
however, is asking its unions for extensive changes in hiring
and operations, whereas Mr. Kalikow was looking only to cut
costs.

   The New York Post trumpeted ``YES!'' one day
after its front page had asked: ``Will the presses ever run
again?''
   The affirmation in today's editions of the saucy tabloid came
after Newspaper Guild members voted 242-45 Monday night to accept a
four-day work week, which will mean a 20 percent pay cut.
   Publisher Peter S. Kalikow had threatened to close the nation's
oldest continuously running daily immediately if the 350 Guild
members - news, advertising and clerical workers - rejected the
concessions. The paper is losing $27 million a year.
   Today, speaking in his office, Kalikow praised the unions for
accepting his conditions and predicted a bright future for the
paper. The Post should begin turning a profit next month, he said.
   ``Of the three tabloids in New York, you're now standing in the
only profitable one,'' Kalikow told reporters at a news conference.
   ``You feel like the executioner has loosened the noose,'' said
Jill Brooke, a Post TV and radio reporter who voted for approval.
``But we still have a life sentence: a 20 percent pay cut.''
   Nearly 1,000 people would have lost their jobs had the
505,000-circulation paper known for dishing up stories of sex,
murder and mayhem under screaming headlines had gone under.
   ``Let's go to press,'' Kalikow said after the vote. ``This is
not a management victory. It is not a labor victory. It is a
victory for all New Yorkers who deserve the honesty and diversity
offered in the pages of the New York Post.''
   The Guild was the last of 11 unions to approve concessions
designed to help Kalikow break even. He is said to have lost more
than $100 million personally since buying the paper from media
baron Rupert Murdoch in 1988. Two years ago, Kalikow won $24
million in concessions as a condition of the purchase.
   Monday's vote was taken by hand after a 90-minute meeting
punctuated by boos, applause and speeches for and against the
proposal. ``There was some blood on the floor,'' said reporter
Kieran Crowley.
   Reporter Peter Moses voted for the pay cut despite reservations.
``We accepted a package that none of us liked, we accepted a
package that made no sense to any of us and we accepted a package
that makes us less than middle class,'' he said.
   Before the pay cut, top salary for reporters was $853 a week.
   Kalikow promised the unions 20 percent of company stock and a
representative on the board of directors. In exchange he got $19
million in union concessions and $8 million in other cost
reductions, including management wage cuts.
   Sentiment swung in favor of the concessions when Kalikow also
said employees could approve the plan, then resign by Wednesday and
receive the same severance and termination pay as if the paper had
shut down.
   Theodore Kheel, an adviser to the unions, said Kalikow also
dropped his demand that 43 jobs be eliminated. Instead he will
settle for how ever many resignations he gets, Kheel said.
   ``A diversity of editorial voices is important in a democratic
society,'' Daily News publisher James Hoge said in a statement
congratulating the Post.
   That diversity may be diminished yet, however. A regional
economic slump has hurt advertising revenue at all the city's
papers. Newspaper analysts say that in the long haul there aren't
enough ads to keep all four major dailies alive.
   The New York Times is in the black but turning less of a profit
than a year ago. Times spokesman William Adler said the newspaper
would seek some of the concessions the Post got.
   The Daily News, a tabloid like the Post, said it has a ``me,
too'' clause in contracts with its unions that entitles it to the
concessions the Post got. Talks at the money-losing News have
stalemated and unions are urging advertisers to boycott it.
   New York Newsday, the city's third tabloid, is losing money
also, but its profitable parent, Times Mirror Co., is keeping the
paper alive.
   The Post has a long history of money woes - and owners with the
deep pockets and the patience to take heavy losses. Its founder,
Alexander Hamilton, was in debt in 1801 when he persuaded a group
of merchants to finance the paper.
   Banking heiress Dorothy Schiff bought the Post in 1939, turned
it into one of the nation's most liberal newspapers and brightened
it up with a tabloid format. It was losing money when she sold it
to Murdoch in 1976.
   The Post's fortunes seemed to have dimmed for good in the 1970s
as much of its audience moved to the suburbs. Recently, the slump
has deepened as an economic decline in the New York City further
cut advertising revenues.
   Murdoch transformed the Post into a politically conservative
paper, albeit one that featured sexy pictures, racy headlines -
like the famous ``HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR'' - and lots of
crime stories.
   In the past year, the Post ran such headlines like ``BASTARDS''
over a photo of a hanged hostage and ``BEST SEX I EVER HAD''
accompanying a picture of a smirking Donald Trump.
   Murdoch said the paper lost $150 million before he sold it for
$37 million to Kalikow, a real estate developer.
   Post Editor Jerry Nachman on Monday likened the Post to a
bumblebee.
   ``Aerodynamically, bumblebees ought not fly; the ratio of their
body weight to wingspan would make it physically impossible,'' he
said. ``But they absolutely refuse to understand that. So they fly.
That's the Post.''
   ``And like the bumblebee,'' he added, ``we keep stinging
people.''

   The New York Post fired the latest salvo in the
Big Apple's four-way newspaper war, trying to lure both the brainy
and the brawny in a new Sunday edition combining savvy with sports.
   The tabloid, which has a third-place circulation of about
600,000, pushed its eclectic new image with a front-page article on
George Steinbrenner by literary journalist Nora Ephron.
   If sophistication was not a draw, there was Dennis the Menace and
Uncle Art's Funland, in color. The cartoons formerly ran in black
and white on Saturdays.
   For those hooked on the weekday Post's fare of politics and
crime, the front page headlined an exclusive in three-inch letters:
``Koch `Hit Men' Booted,'' on the secret deportation of two
Colombians believed to have been sent to kill Mayor Edward I. Koch.
   And there were sports, sports and more sports.
   Post President Peter Kalikow pushed the button that started the
presses for the Sunday edition of the nation's oldest continuously
published daily at 7:55 p.m. Saturday.
   The Tuxedo-clad Kalikow uncorked a bottle of New York champagne
and poured glasses for cheering pressmen in ink-stained coveralls
and paper hats. Later, Kalikow led them into the area where 575,000
Sunday papers were bundled and packed off for delivery.
   Publisher Peter Price handed out free copies of the paper Sunday
to travelers arriving at La Guardia airport.
   A year ago, Kalikow, a developer, saved the 188-year-old
newspaper from extinction by buying it from media mogul Rupert
Murdoch for $37 million. Murdoch threatened to close the
money-losing paper if he couldn't find a buyer.
   The Post now competes seven days a week for readers and
advertisers with the Daily News, The New York Times and the New York
edition of Newsday, the Long Island daily.
   The Post is third in the city circulation race, trailing the News
(1,281,706) and the Times (1,038,829) and leading New York Newsday
(176,043 in the city, and 706,440 overall), according to the Audit
Bureau of Circulations.
   Kalikow is trying to lure the more than 300,000 people who read
both the daily Post and The New York Times, but who may not want to
carry home the slicker Sunday version of his paper, said George
Lois, who created an advertising campaign for the Post.
   The Post, which like many newspapers expects to obtain most of
its advertising revenue from its Sunday edition, ``is fully booked
with ads for the next four weeks,'' said Kalikow.
   Kalikow said he expects to spend $22 million to $25 million on
the Sunday Post in the first year. He said it would be months before
he knows if the move has paid off.
   Many media analysts have said they are skeptical that the New
York market can support a fourth Sunday newspaper.

   Edward I. Koch, soon to be New York City's ex-mayor, will be named a columnist for the New York Post, the city's racy daily tabloid newspaper, according to people close to the paper.

   Mr. Koch, who was defeated in the city's recent Democratic mayoral primary, is expected to accept an offer from Publisher Peter Kalikow and Editor Jerry Nachman to write a weekly column based on any topic he chooses.
Mr. Koch's salary couldn't be learned.

   Mr. Kalikow's office wouldn't comment but sources close to Mr. Kalikow said Mr. Koch has accepted the offer.
A spokesman for the mayor had no comment.

   The Post, as well as the New York Times, endorsed Mr. Koch over the eventual winner of the Democratic primary, Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins.
Mr. Koch already has accepted a position as visiting lecturer at the New York University Graduate School of Public Administration.

THE New York Post seemed as good as dead on Sunday, but the smallest and
most sensational of the Big Apple's three leading tabloids received a
last-minute reprieve after a weekend of intrigue and frantic negotiations.
Last weekend Mr Peter Kalikow, the Post's owner, found himself facing a
crisis when Bankers Trust, his chief backer, threatened to pull the plug on
a Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.9m) credit line that had jumped to Dollars 6m in
recent weeks.
The newspaper ran a deficit last year estimated at about Dollars 5m.
Mr Kalikow thought he had resolved his problems by arranging for Mr Leon
Black, the former Drexel Burnham Lambert executive, to invest in the Post.
But advisers close to the deal say Mr Black lost interest, which led Mr
Kalikow to warn last Friday that the Post faced closure by the end of the
weekend if no one else could be found.
A 20 per cent wage cut for the newspaper's 719 employees plus a cover price
rise from 40 to 50 cents were rushed through on Sunday afternoon as a
supposed alternative solution, but proved inadequate for Bankers Trust. That
is when New York's big guns stepped into the fray.
It was Ms Cindy Adams, the Post's gossip columnist, who got most heavily
involved in the search for a buyer. She worked the telephones throughout the
weekend, ringing 'my rich friends or my smart ones who know rich ones'.
By late afternoon on Sunday Mr Kalikow was telling staff he feared the paper
would have to shut down. But behind the scenes Ms Adams and Mr Howard
Rubenstein, king of the New York public relations world, were in touch with
Mr Bill Fugazy, the limousine mogul, searching for an angel. Mr Fugazy, in
turn, contacted Mr Steve Hoffenberg, a little-known 48-year-old financier
who owns Towers Financial, a factoring and accounts receivable business.
'Everybody who was anybody was calling everybody else on Sunday to try to
save the Post,' said one investment banker whose client turned down the
deal. And that included Mr Mario Cuomo, governor of New York.
When Messrs Rubenstein and Fugazy could not find Mr Hoffenberg it fell to
Governor Cuomo to send out a state trooper to track down the financier. The
police could not find him, but Mr Vincent Tese, the state director of
economic development, talked to Mr Hoffenberg.
Mr Hoffenberg eventually surfaced and a series of conference calls resulted
in a last-minute agreement on Sunday night.
The deal called for Mr Hoffenberg to provide an immediate Dollars 300,000
and to guarantee the Post's Dollars 6m line of credit. In exchange he is now
in pole position to spend the next four weeks deciding whether to go ahead
and become the newspaper's new owner.
The reprieve could still fall apart, but that did not stop the tabloid from
plastering yesterday's front page with the words 'NEVER SAY DIE]'

<HEAD>New York Post Could Fold Saturday If Unions Don't Make Concessions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saturday's edition of the New York Post, the
nation's oldest continuously published daily, could be its last if
its unions do not come up with millions in concessions demanded by
the publisher.
   Publisher Peter S. Kalikow told the unions Sept. 4 that he is
losing $27 million annually on the tabloid and that he wants the
unions to relinquish $17.4 million in payroll and $1.9 million in
benefits by Saturday.
   But because he wants to write an editorial either saying goodbye
to New Yorkers or telling them of the Post's survival, Kalikow
changed the deadline on Tuesday to 8 p.m. Friday.
   ``Whatever the decision, he wanted it clearly explained to the
public,'' said Kalikow spokesman Howard Rubenstein.
   The Allied Printing Trades Council, a group of newspaper unions,
says that Kalikow has always been honest with the unions and
therefore they are willing to renegotiate the contract that ends
next March.
   Formal talks began Tuesday night with a 90-minute session
covering ground rules, following confirmation by the unions'
auditors that the Post was fighting for its financial life.
   The Allied also is negotiating over contracts that expired in
March at the Daily News, the nation's second largest metropolitan
daily. Talks there have been intense but fruitless since January in
what both sides say is a fight for the newspaper's life.
   The News management demands rights to eliminate rules it says
force it to pay for excess production workers. The unions claim the
News is seeking to eliminate the unions and either sell or shut
down the paper.
   The unions are asking retail advertisers to boycott the News
until a settlement is reached.
   The News has been losing money also and has been hit by an
industrywide advertising decline.
   News management told the Newspaper Guild on Tuesday that it
demands the same concessions the Guild makes to the Post.
   Guild President Barry Lipton said the News' demand was ``a naked
attempt to collapse these negotiations.''
   John T. Sloan, News vice president for human resources, said a
provision in the expired contract guaranteed that concessions made
to one publisher be made to others contracting with the same union.

   Rupert Murdoch agreed to sell his deficit-ridden New York Post to real estate developer Peter S. Kalikow for $37 million -- if labor unions grant millions of dollars in cost savings.

   But the unions representing 1,200 Post employees may propose seeking another buyer on their own if they deem the cost-cutting proposals too harsh, said a union official.

   In addition to the sale price, Mr. Kalikow agreed to assume the costs of closing the paper -- such as severance and pension liabilities -- if that becomes necessary after he becomes owner.
Those costs could exceed $40 million, said people close to the talks.
In return, Mr. Kalikow would get the Post and its assets, largely waterfront property on New York's lower East Side.

   The property was valued at about $37 million in documents circulated among prospective buyers.
But Mr. Kalikow, who owns about a dozen buildings in New York, reiterated he isn't acquiring the Post for the property.
"I firmly believe we cannot allow yet another newspaper to shut down its presses. . . ," he said.
Mr. Kalikow, who has no publishing experience, has said he plans to name as publisher Peter O. Price, chairman of Avenue magazine.

   The sale depends on eight unions "accepting a sweeping cost-reduction plan," said Mr. Murdoch, who plans to present a detailed cost-cutting proposal to union leaders today.
The tabloid had a loss of $17 million last year.
Advertisers have fled, and circulation has shrunk to about 500,000 from close to one million several years ago.
Aides to Mr. Murdoch said the Post's financial decline worsened recently in the wake of uncertainty over its ownership.
Mr. Murdoch, who owns WNYW-TV in New York, must sell the Post by March 6 to comply with government regulations forbidding single ownership of both a newspaper and broadcast outlet in the same city.

   Mr. Kalikow said he is willing to take "a very considerable financial risk . . . only if we have the cooperation of all the unions."
The Post "is close to the edge," added the 44-year-old conservative Republican, whose fortune is estimated at $500 million.
If granted the concessions, Mr. Kalikow would spend "millions of dollars on promotions in an effort to attract more advertisers," said a spokesman.
Without them, the spokesman added, prospects of the Post's continued publication are "almost nil."

   Mr. Kalikow, however, refused to agree to continue publishing the tabloid for at least three years, a commitment that Mr. Murdoch sought from all prospective buyers, the spokesman said.

   Under the agreement, people close to the talk said, Mr. Kalikow could close the paper in less than two years.

   Mr. Murdoch didn't disclose details of the plan that he will present to union officials today.
The Associated Press quoted a source as saying the concessions would include eliminating the newspaper deliverers for the Post, which then would be distributed by independent wholesalers for an estimated savings of $6 million a year.
Unions representing reporters and press operators also are likely to be targeted, union sources said.

   If Mr. Kalikow "is out of line" in the concessions he wants, "maybe the unions can ask Mr. Murdoch to give us 30 days to shop the paper around," said George McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades Council, a union umbrella group.
In addition, union officials said they will want to determine whether Mr. Kalikow intends to seek a "joint operating agreement" with the Daily News, a competitor, to publish both papers more economically.

   Separately, Lawrence Kessler, general counsel of Mr. Murdoch's U.S. media holding company, said the media owner intends to press his suit challenging the media cross-ownership ban.
Sens.
Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.) and Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) backed a law banning the Federal Communications Commission from extending waivers or from reconsidering the ban.
In Boston, Mr. Murdoch owns the Boston Herald and WFXT-TV.

   "She has successfully structured a business operation
which has effectively positioned the New York Post for sales

   Last November, the Post discontinued its eight-month-old
Sunday edition, which failed to attract sufficient
advertisers or readers and lost millions of dollars.

<HEAD>79 New York Post Employees Take Buyout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   NEW YORK - Seveny-nine New York Post workers decided to resign
and take a buyout offered as part of a labor settlement to save the
tabloid, union and newspaper officials said Wednesday.
   The paper had sought only 43 resignations from the 350-member
Newspaper Guild as part of $19 million in union concessions owner
Peter S. Kalikow said he needed to make the paper profitable. The
505,000-circulation paper has been losing $27 million a year.
   The Guild resignations mean the Post will lose close to 200 of
its 960 workers. Agreements reached last week call for 100 forced
resignations from the 263-member drivers union and five from the
Post's 17 paper handlers.
   Guild members resigning include employees from editorial,
advertising, circulation, and accounting. Post Editor Jerry Nachman
said about 40 of the 79 resignations were from the editorial
department.
   ``It's not a number I like, or I'm happy with,'' said Nachman.
   Members of the union had until 5 p.m. Wednesday to resign and
collect full severance plus eight weeks shut down pay.
   Kalikow had improved the buyout offer before guild members voted
Monday on concessions slashing their pay 20 percent as part of a
four-day work week.
   The Guild had been the holdout among 11 unions that gave job and
wage cuts sought by Kalikow. Kalikow had said he would shut down
the 189-year-old paper if any one union refused the grant
concessions.
   Kalikow said Tuesday that the concessions from unions and cuts
in overhead and among the managerial staff will allow the paper to
be profitable by Oct. 1. That would be the first profit since the
1970s.
   Among the 79 staffers to resign was sports columnist Peter
Vecsey, who had previously told the newspaper he was leaving when
his contract expired in November. He will write a twice-weekly
sports column for USA Today. He also recently signed to be a
reporter on NBC's NBA pre-game show, ``The Insiders.''
   Peter Faris, Post vice president for editorial and
administration, said Vecsey's resignation was ``divorced from the
buyout scenario although as a Guild member he is availing himself
of the opportunity.''

Dorothy Schiff, the heiress who molded the historic New York Post into one of
the nation's most liberal dailies during her 37 years at its helm, died of
cancer today. She was 86.
</P>
<P>
Peter Faris, a vice president at the Post, said Schiff died at her Manhattan
home. She had been sick since May.
</P>
<P>
The Post, Schiff once said, advocated "honest unionism, social reform and
humane government programs." Her paper was a middle-class tabloid, packed with
columns and features, restrained only by Schiff's legendary tight fist.
</P>
<P>
The Post is the oldest continuously published newspaper in America, first
published by Alexander Hamilton in 1801, and was one of the few metropolitan
newspapers owned by a woman.
</P>
<P>
She was credited with saving the Post when she broke with other publishers
during a long newspaper strike in 1963 and resumed publishing under the old
contract. The paper gained circulation during that period, and within a few
years became the city's only afternoon paper.
</P>
<P>
"Often voted least likely to succeed in New York's competitive journalistic
climate, she outmaneuvered such moneyed rivals as Hearst's Journal-American,
Scripps-Howard's World Telegram and Sun, and John Hay Whitney's Herald Tribune,
and in the end outlasted them," noted Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 19, 1976, after years of turning down potential buyers, she sold the
Post to media magnate Rupert Murdoch, reportedly for $31 million. Murdoch
transformed the Post into a racier and more politically conservative tabloid
before selling it to real estate developer Peter S. Kalikow last year.
</P>
<P>
Schiff's grandfather was financier Jacob Schiff, a founder of the Kuhn, Loeb
banking house and a prominent philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
Her four marriages ended in divorce. Her first husband was Richard B. W. Hall,
followed by politician and editor George Backer, editor Theodor Olin Thackrey
and Rudolf Sonneborn.

   The New York Post got a temporary reprieve
Friday night when all but one of its unions agreed to concessions
designed to save the feisty but unprofitable tabloid.
   ``Ain't Over Yet'' declared Saturday's front page headline when
it rolled off the presses early Saturday, hours behind schedule.
Post Owner Peter Kalikow had threatened to close the paper after
Saturday's editions without the cuts.
   Ten unions at the paper agreed to concessions during marathon
negotiating sessions. Kalikow said he needed $19 million in
concessions to keep publishing the newspaper, the nation's oldest
continuously published daily. The paper is losing about $27 million
a year.
   The last union, The Newspaper Guild, will vote on his offer
Monday night, Kalikow said. The Guild represents 350 editorial and
advertising employees. The union's negotiating team voted 7-3
against the offer.
   ``I feel optimistic that when the members see it they will
approve it,'' Kalikow said of his offer.
   If the Guild members reject the offer, the Post will cease
publishing immediately, he said. The newspaper has a circulation of
505,000.
   ``It was the best offer we could make under the circumstances,''
he said.
   Barry Lipton, president of Local 3 of the Newspaper Guild, said
he recommended his members accept the package. Details were not
disclosed.
   ``It's up to the members. It's the very best we could do. ... I
hope that the sense of the membership is to swallow what may be a
bitter pill,'' he said.
   Members of each union must ratify the agreements, but it
appeared the Guild vote was the key because its negotiators didn't
support the pact.
   The reprieve was announced after talks stretched for more than
12 hours and passed two deadlines. The paper had planned to print
its history, including reminiscences of former employees, if
Saturday's edition was its last.
   ``It's a terrific farewell edition we prepared but hopefully
it'll never be read by the public,'' metropolitan editor John
Cotter said.
   Talks had resumed Friday morning between the paper and the Guild
and other unions representing more than 850 of the Post's 960
employees. The newspaper's contracts with the unions expire in
March 1991.
   Kalikow said the concessions included pay cuts and layoffs. He
said workers would be given stock in the newspaper under the
agreements.
   ``It was a bitter pill for these people to swallow but they
realized it was important to save the Post,'' he said.
   A source involved in the Guild negotiations, who requested
anonymity, said that the Post had roposed a cut of 43
Guild-covered jobs. Previously, the newspaper had favored pay cuts
rather than job cuts, while the union has called for attrition
through resignations and buyouts.
   The situation was complicated by the plight of the Daily News,
which also is losing money, and which also is in the midst of a
labor conflict. News executives say any concessions the unions give
the Post must also be given the News under ``me-too'' contract
clauses.
   And The New York Times said it would seek union concessions to
the extent that they were related to the same economic conditions
that have affected the Post and News and led to declines in the
papers' ad revenue.
   Money troubles are not new to the Post - even its founder had
them. Alexander Hamilton was heavily in debt in 1801 when he
persuaded a group of merchants to finance the paper.
   His was merely the first of many famous names to be associated
with the paper.
   In the 1820s, New England poet William Cullen Bryant began a
50-year tenure as editor. Poet Walt Whitman covered the Civil War
for the Post. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was briefly a co-owner in
the 1920s.
   Heiress Dorothy Schiff bought the Post in 1939 and tried to
attract more readers with comics, features, a tabloid format,
strong sports stories and nearly 50 columnists.
   Schiff also made the paper one of the nation's most liberal. Her
self-described formula: ``honest unionism, social reform and humane
government programs.''
   But the humane reformer also was a bit tightfisted. The Post
became known for making do with a small staff and old equipment.
   By the mid-1970s, much of the Post's liberal, middle-class
readership had moved to the suburbs. In 1976, Schiff sold the paper
to Australian media baron Rupert Murdoch for $31 million. At the
time the paper was losing $500,000 annually.
   Under Murdoch, the Post took on a conservative voice and began
dishing out sexy pictures, racy headlines - including the famous
``HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR'' - and a steady diet of crime
stories.
   Murdoch said the paper lost $150 million before he sold it in
1988 for $37 million to Kalikow, a real estate developer who also
acquired the paper's valuable waterfront land on South Street in
Lower Manhattan.

   Kalikow Runs Into Real Estate Woes;
   New York Post Operations May Be Hurt

   New York Post owner Peter Kalikow's real estate empire is
running into financial trouble, which could cripple his
ability to fight New York City's tabloid wars, according to
real estate executives.
   Within the past month, European American Bank sued Mr.
Kalikow for failure to pay the principal portion of a $25
million loan. Many of Mr. Kalikow's real estate holdings,
which include prime Manhattan office towers and a square
block of Upper East Side residential buildings, are believed
to be not earning enough money to pay their debt service. Mr.
Kalikow is also developing a hotel in downtown Manhattan in
the midst of a serious economic slump.

   As a result, Mr. Kalikow's creditors, which include
Bankers Trust, Manufacturers Hanover, Chase Manhattan Corp.,
and Citibank, are expected to meet sometime soon to devise a
plan to give Mr. Kalikow time to work out his problems,
persons close to the banks say. Real estate executives say
Bankers Trust has lent Mr. Kalikow tens of millions of
personally guaranteed money to help the developer fund the
Post's operations.
   Some of Mr. Kalikow's more aggressive creditors, such as
European American, are believed to want to be bought out of
their positions by Mr. Kalikow's larger creditors, but so far
the other banks have not agreed to such a deal.
   Phone calls to Mr. Kalikow's publicist were not returned.
A spokesman for European American confirmed a lawsuit had
been filed in Nassau County (N.Y.) Supreme Court against Mr.
Kalikow, but declined to elaborate. Spokesmen for the other
banks wouldn't comment.
   Mr. Kalikow, whose net worth has been estimated by Forbes
magazine to be more than $500 million, owns about a dozen New
York City buildings. Some of the banks with relationships
dating back to when Mr. Kalikow's father, who was also a
developer, hold the younger Mr. Kalikow in high esteem, and
consider him an innocent victim of the city's economic slide
and the national credit crunch.
   Mr. Kalikow's troubles, while not as serious as those
afflicting developers such as Donald Trump or William
Zeckendorf, are somewhat ironic because he was one of the
more conservative players on the New York real estate scene
in the 1980s. By and large, he shunned speculative office
buildings. His plan to evict hundreds of middle-income
tenants to make way for an 81-story luxury high-rise
embroiled him in lengthy controversy that was settled long
after the red-hot Manhattan real estate market cooled. Mr.
Kalikow paid $43 million for that site in 1984, and is
believed to be losing money carrying the mortgage.
   Mr. Kalikow departed his conservative business style,
however, in 1988 when he purchased the unprofitable New York
Post from Rupert Murdoch for $37 million. Since then, Mr.
Kalikow has reportedly invested as much as $100 million more
in the newspaper. Last fall, the Post came close to closing,
but was saved when its unions agreed to $19 million in
concessions.
   When it appeared the Daily News, the Post's chief
competitor, might go out of business as a result of a strike,
it looked as if Mr. Kalikow's gamble might pay off. During
the strike, the Post was said to be making about $2.5 million
a month.
   But with the settlement of the strike and the sale of the
News to British press baron Robert Maxwell last week, the
Post could once again become unprofitable, if the News
recaptures the advertisers and readers it lost during the
strike. Already advertisers such as A&amp;S, Stern's, and other
major companies have said they would resume advertising in
the News.
   The Post has historically been New York City's raciest and
least-profitable tabloid. The city's third tabloid, New York
Newsday, has yet to turn a profit but has been consistently
building market share since entering the competition in
earnest in 1985. People familiar with Mr. Kalikow's agreement
with the Post unions said he is expected to demand the same
concessions Mr. Maxwell received from the Daily News unions.

<HEAD>Salembier Resigns as Post President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Valerie Salembier has resigned as president of
the New York Post after 17 months at the newspaper's helm, the
Post's owner announced Thursday.
   No replacement was announced. Post owner and publisher Peter
Kalikow said he would reassume the title of president.
   Salembier, a former publisher of TV Guide, was named to the post
in April 1989.
   Kalikow spokesman Howard Rubenstein said Kalikow had not asked
Salembier to resign. He added that she was not leaving for a
specific position elsewhere. ``They parted very amicably,'' he said,
   Salembier, who supervised business, advertising and circulation,
said in a written statement that she felt it was time ``to move
forward to new challenges and opportunities.''
   Kalikow praised her performance.
   ``She has successfully structured a business operation which has
effectively positioned the New York Post for sales and profit
growth in the 90s,'' he said in the statement.
   Kalikow in 1988 bought the newspaper, which was losing money,
from Rupert Murdoch.
   Under her tenure, the Post discontinued in November its
8-month-old Sunday edition, which failed to attract sufficient
advertisers or readers and lost millions of dollars.
