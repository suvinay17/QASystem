   Merck &amp; Co., the nation's leading drug
company, and E.I Du Pont de Nemours and Co. are joining forces to
develop a new class of heart disease medicine under a research and
marketing pact, the companies said today.
   As part of the collaboration, Merck will turn over to
Wilmington, Del.-based Du Pont the rights to sell two of its drugs
in exchange for a percentage of the proceeds.
   In an unusual arrangement, Merck said it was allowing Du Pont to
market Sinemet, a major treatment for Parkinson's disease, and
Vaseretic, a hyper-tension drug, so it could focus on marketing
other products.
   Sinemet accounted for $100 million of Merck's $5.94 billion in
sales last year. Spokesman John Doorley said Vaseretic's revenues
were less, but he didn't know the precise figure.
   The other half of the collaboration gives Du Pont, a chemical,
energy and specialty products giant, access to Merck's highly
proficient research staff and expertise at bringing products to
market in developing a new class of heart disease medicine.
   The class, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, was developed by
Du Pont, a leader in the area. Angiotensin II, or AII, is a major
hormone and factor in high blood pressure.
   The companies said the treatment is particularly safe because it
acts on a very specific part of a person's body chemistry.
   Merck's researchers will work on the AII compounds, which are
now in human trials. The companies hope to bring it to market in
the mid-1990s, Doorley said.
   Medical products accounted for $1.3 billion of Du Pont's $32.9
billion in revenues last year. Pharmaceutical sales totaled $350
million.

   Drugmaker Merck &amp; Co. will let Du Pont Co.
market two of its drugs in exchange for a chance to help Du Pont
develop and sell a new class of potential high blood pressure
medicines.
   The unusual arrangement announced by both companies on Thursday
grants Merck access to Du Pont's new development, while giving Du
Pont the expertise Merck has in research and shepherding drugs to
market. The pact also fills a void in E.I. Du Pont de Nemours and
Co.'s drug pipeline.
   ``It's trading current products for future products,'' said
David Bartash, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The pairing off comes during a time of increasing global
consolidation in the pharmaceutical world as drug makers merge or
join forces to sell products.
   Du Pont is seeking to expand in pharmaceuticals, and Bartash
said it may have entered into the pact to speed up the process.
   ``They've been spending money for a long time (on drug
development) and they haven't got a whole lot to show for it,'' he
said.
   Pharmaceutical revenue last year accounted for about 1 percent
of the revenue of Wilmington, Del.-based Du Pont, or $350 million
out of its $32.9 billion in sales.
   The agreement calls for Merck to take the lead in developing one
of Du Pont's most promising drug discoveries, blockers that
interfere with a hormone that induces high blood pressure.
   The companies will share revenues from such a drug, which Merck
spokesman John Doorley said could be introduced in the mid-1990s.
   In the deal's other aspect, Merck said it would turn over
exclusive North American marketing rights to Du Pont for Sinemet, a
major treatment for Parkinson's disease. Sales of the drug,
introduced last year, exceeded $100 million.
   Rahway-based Merck's total revenues for the year were $5.94
billion, leading to earnings of $1.2 billion.
   Du Pont will also assume marketing of Vaseretic, called
Co-Renitec in some European countries, a high-blood pressure
medicine that Merck introduced in 1987. Vaseretic is a combination
of Merck's popular Vasotec and its diuretic HydroDiuril.
   Merck said the arrangement will allow it to focus marketing
energies on other products.
   Marketing collaborations between drug makers are frequent, but
more usually involve one company helping sell another's drug,
rather than turning over the entire marketing task, said Du Pont
spokesman Roger Morris.
   ``You're trying to leverage new projects with as many sales
people as you can,'' said Louis C. Webb, an analyst with Advest
Inc. of Hartford, Conn.
   The exchange of existing drugs for access to research is also
unusual, analysts said.
   Merck will receive an undisclosed percentage of the proceeds
from Vaseretic and Sinemet.
   Morris said Du Pont wanted Sinemet because it already had
experience selling a Parkinson's drug, and liked Vaseretic because
the company was interested in expanding its cardiology line. Both
are generating rising sales, falling between a number of ``mature''
Du Pont drugs with expired patents and others far from hitting the
market, said Morris.
   Together, the companies will work on a new class of high blood
pressure drugs called angiotensin II receptor antagonists.
   Angiotensin II, or AII, is a blood pressure hormone that binds
to ``receptor sites'' on blood cells and tissue. The antagonists
reach the sites first, blocking the hormone and keeping blood
pressure down.
   The companies said the treatment is particularly safe because it
acts on a very specific part of body chemistry. The compounds are
in human test trials, said the companies.
   Morris said that with Merck's participation, a drug could be on
the market about two years sooner.
   Merck, known for its strong research department, also gains.
   ``They're smart enough to know they can't discover everything,''
said Bartash. But he said a previous similar arrangement with the
British Imperial Chemical Industries has yet to produce fruit.
   Merck in 1986 allowed ICI to share marketing of a high blood
pressure drug in exchange for co-development of a compound to treat
diabetes side effects. Merck spokesman Don Burkat said the drug was
still in development.

@  Du Pont Signs Agreement With Merck
@  In Effort to Speed Up Drug Marketing

   Du Pont Co., seeking to speed to market some of its more promising drug candidates, entered a research and marketing pact with Merck &amp; Co. 

   Du Pont and Merck will collaborate in developing a class of compounds for treating high blood pressure and heart disease, called angiotensin II receptor antagonists. 
The two companies also will market the compounds together, if regulators grant marketing approval. 
In addition, Du Pont gains marketing rights to two of Merck's established prescription drugs. 

   For Du Pont, the agreement represents an attempt to accelerate the payoff from its ambitious but expensive push into pharmaceuticals. 
Merck, based in Rahway, N.J., is the world's largest prescription drug company, with a veteran sales force and a strong record in taking drugs through clinical trials. 
Du Pont, based in Wilmington, Del., is a major chemicals and energy company. 

   Joseph A. Mollica, Du Pont's vice president for pharmaceuticals, noted that Merck's involvement also "represents a recognition of the strength of our research effort." 
Although several companies including Merck have research interests in angiotensin II receptor antagonists, a spokesman for Merck said it considers Du Pont to be leading the pack. 

   A Du Pont compound has just passed human safety trials and is in early efficacy trials. 
Du Pont, which hopes to get marketing clearance by the mid-1990s, estimates that the alliance with Merck could cut development time for the compounds by two years. 
The compounds block the action of a hormone, angiotensin II, which has a role in many cases of high blood pressure. 

   Merck will lead the effort to take the compounds through clinical trials and regulatory reviews. 
In exchange, the company gets to share with Du Pont world-wide marketing responsibilities and sales revenue. 

   The other marketing accords comprise two Merck products with relatively small sales: Sinemet, for Parkinson's disease, and Vaseretic, for high blood pressure. 
That arrangement will enable Merck, whose research pipeline has been paying big dividends in recent years, to free up more of its sales force to concentrate on other Merck products. 
For Du Pont's part, it gets more drugs to sell while its own products are in earlier stages of development. 

   Du Pont will have exclusive marketing rights to Sinemet in North America starting in 1990. 
In 1988, North American sales of the drug were about $100 million. 

   Du Pont will obtain exclusive North American marketing rights to Vaseretic starting in 1992 and will jointly promote the drug with Merck in certain European countries starting in 1990. 
In Europe the drug is marketed under the name Co-Renitec. 
An industry source estimated 1988 sales of the drug in Europe and North America at $45 million.

   Du Pont Merck Pharmaceutical Co. was cleared by the Food
and Drug Administration to market a drug that simulates the
effect of exercise in heart-stress testing.
   Joseph A. Mollica, president and chief executive officer
of Du Pont Merck, estimated that sales of the drug, called
I.V. Persantine, could reach between $20 million and $30
million a year. The drug will be available in early February.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The drug is the first pharmaceutical alternative to
exercise in stress testing, the company said. Elderly and
disabled patients may be injected with I.V. Persantine as an
alternative to running on a treadmill during a diagnostic
test. The drug simulates the effect of exercise. Doctors
inject thallium as an imaging agent to observe the flow of
blood for a variety of diagnostic tests. As many as a half
million patients can't be tested effectively with current
methods, Du Pont Merck said. More than 1.5 million thallium
studies are performed a year.
   Du Pont Merck, a Wilmington, Del., 50-50 joint venture of
Du Pont Co. and Merck &amp; Co., began operating Jan. 1. The
company has an exclusive license to make and market the
intravenous form of Persantine in the U.S. under an agreement
with a unit of Boehringer Ingelheim International G.m.b.H. of
Germany.
   The announcement follows one late last month by Du Pont
Merck that it received clearance for another product used in
diagnosing heart disease. The product, Cardiolite, is an
injectable chemical tracing agent that can help doctors
diagnose and treat the damage caused by heart attacks without
using invasive procedures. Cardiolite can produce images of
blood flow in the heart when viewed under certain medical
imaging cameras.
   The two products, along with Ethmozine, a treatment for
abnormal heart rhythms, and Coumadin, an anti-coagulant, form
the basis of the company's cardiovascular segment. Du Pont
Pharmaceuticals, the former Du Pont unit that constituted the
Wilmington chemicals giant's contribution to the joint
venture and formed its nucleus, received FDA clearance to
market Ethmozine last June. Merck, Rahway, N.J., contributed
capital, some products and funding for research and
development to the joint venture.
   Another heart product the company is developing has a
mechanism called an angiotensin receptor blocker, which
treats hypertension and congestive heart failure. Mr. Mollica
expects that product to be on the market in the mid-1990s.
The company anticipates approval of a controlled-release form
of Sinemet, which Merck developed to treat Parkinson's
disease.
   Mr. Mollica expects sales for the venture's first year of
operation to be about $700 million, but he wouldn't comment
on whether the venture would be profitable. Du Pont
Pharmaceuticals had estimated 1990 sales of about $550
million. About 70% to 75% of the partnership's sales will
come from Du Pont products and the rest from Merck. He said
the major impact of the venture on its parents' earnings
wouldn't be felt before the mid- to late-1990s.
   "The goal is by the end of the decade . . . to be a
multibillion-dollar multinational company," Mr. Mollica said.
Du Pont Merck will spend about $230 million, or about
one-third of sales, on research and development this year, he
said. The company probably will be doubling its spending on
research and development in the next five years, he added.
   The venture's sales now are about 80% in the U.S. and the
rest international; the goal over the next decade is for
sales to be derived at least 50% overseas, he said.

   Du Pont Merck Pharmaceutical Co. said sales reached $780
million in its first year of operation, exceeding original
projections of $700 million.
   The pharmaceutical company began operations on Jan. 1,
1991, as an independent drug company owned equally by Du Pont
Co. and Merck &amp; Co. Most of the personnel and assets of Du
Pont Merck had previously operated as a unit of Du Pont.
Merck added research and development funding, some products
-- especially in Europe -- and expertise in the new company.

   The company reported that it had "respectable profits"
despite costs associated with expanding European operations.
More than 100 sales representatives were added in Europe
during the year, and this expansion will continue, the
company said.
   During 1991, Du Pont Merck introduced three new products:
Sinemet CR to treat Parkinson's Disease, Cardiolite for heart
imaging and IV Persantine to simulate exercise in stress
testing.
   Du Pont Merck had world-wide pharmaceutical sales of $634
million, while the company's radiopharmaceuticals division,
headquartered in Billerica, Mass., had world-wide sales of
$146 million.
   The Wilmington, Del., firm focuses on cardiovascular and
central nervous system diseases, oncology, inflammatory
diseases and radiopharmaceuticals.

Merck &amp; Co. and Du Pont said Wednesday that they agreed to form a joint 
venture to create an independent, research-driven pharmaceuticals company that 
would operate worldwide with sales of about $700 million in its first year. 
</P>
<P>
Du Pont, the giant Wilmington, Del.-based industrial company with interest in 
chemicals, plastics and fibers, will contribute its entire pharmaceutical and 
imaging agents business to the joint venture. Rahway, N.J.-based Merck, the 
world's largest pharmaceuticals company, said it will provide its research and 
development and international marketing expertise to the venture. It will also 
provide cash and marketing rights to several prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The joint venture -- to be called Du Pont o Merck Pharmaceuticals Co. -- will 
be a substantial new player in the pharmaceuticals business with a research 
staff of about 1,500 people and a first-year research budget of about $230 
million, increasing to about $400 million in 1995. Analysts said the joint 
venture is a creative solution to the pharmaceutical industry's voracious 
appetite for research and development dollars and the needs of individual 
companies to fill gaps in marketing and research expertise. 
</P>
<P>
For Du Pont, the joint venture also gets it out of the day-to-day management of 
a business it has "invested heavily in with limited success," said Viren Mehta 
of the New York-based pharmaceuticals research firm of Mehta &amp; Isaly. 
</P>
<P>
Merck Senior Vice President Francis Spiegel said the company, a unit of 
Swiss-based Merck AG, has deliberately avoided the "megamergers" that have 
occurred with frequency in the industry in recent years as companies sought 
more marketing and research dollars to keep up with the rising cost and 
difficulties of bringing new drugs to market. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of our competitors went for mergers and what we found is that when they 
did, they had to go at a premium over the market price. . . . We didn't want to 
go that route," Spiegel said in an interview. Merck preferred to pick "good 
partners" in joint ventures to fill its needs, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Merck's size, it still has only about 5% of the world market, he said. 
It is the industry leader in research spending, with more than $850 million 
budgeted in 1990, but that is still less than 5% of the world's research 
dollars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided if we want to be a premium growth company, we needed more research 
effort. We need alliances," Spiegel said. 
</P>
<P>
Merck Chairman and Chief Executive P. Roy Vagelos said the company's research 
budget and research staff of 4,500 are substantial. "But we believe even more 
is needed for us to do the important research that needs to be done. The way to 
success in this high-risk business is to invest more in research and to invest 
it wisely," he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Du Pont Chairman and Chief Executive Edgar S. Woolard Jr. said the joint 
venture gives Du Pont "the opportunity to realize more quickly its vision of 
being a major player in the pharmaceuticals industry by bringing together two 
well respected health-care companies." 
</P>
<P>
The companies said the joint venture's first priority will be to build its 
European business base by adding some current Merck drugs and by increasing its 
European sales force to at least 650 people in the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Merck will contribute to the joint venture certain marketing rights in five 
European countries to the anti-Parkinson disease medicine Sinemet and to the 
cardiovascular medicine Moduretic. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Mehta pointed out that those products are a small part of Merck and are 
primarily older drugs whose patents will soon expire. Putting the marketing of 
these older products in the joint venture "frees up the sales force to do more 
important things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The joint venture will also market -- upon receipt of regulatory approval -- in 
those countries a brand of a compound Merck is currently testing to reduce 
enlarged prostate glands. Merck will retain marketing rights to Proscar, 
another brand of the prostate medicine. All of Du Pont's prescription drugs on 
the market will be part of the joint venture, including the anti-clotting agent 
Coumadin and the analgesics Percodan and Percocet. 
</P>
<P>
The companies said they don't expect the research efforts of the joint venture 
to produce significant commercial results until the late 1990s. "This is a 
long-term deal," Spiegel said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the joint venture grew out of a separate cross-marketing and 
research and development deal the companies entered into last October, Spiegel 
said.

   Merck-Du Pont Venture Certain to Stir Drug Industry

   Merck &amp; Co., responding to mergers that have reshaped the
pharmaceutical industry over the past two years, is teaming
up with chemical giant Du Pont Co. to form a new company.
   Under terms of the agreement, the two companies will own,
in a 50-50 partnership, Du Pont's entire pharmaceutical
operation, which is expected to post sales of $550 million
this year. Merck will provide the new company with foreign
marketing rights to some prescription medicines plus an
undisclosed amount of cash.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The deal is certain to shake up the world-wide drug
industry, which is undergoing cataclysmic changes as
companies merge and forge alliances with one another in
unprecedented numbers. "The rules are changing very fast,"
said Edgar S. Woolard Jr., Du Pont's chairman and chief
executive officer. "Because of all the recent consolidations
taking place, the risk of going it alone is much, much higher
than five years ago."
   By joining forces with Du Pont, Merck sends a sharp signal
that it is willing to take unusually aggressive steps to keep
its place atop the U.S. drug industry. The move is certain to
raise concern at Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., whose recent
merger was an effort to take aim at Merck.
   As importantly, the agreement shows that the high cost of
developing new drugs is daunting even for a company as
successful as Merck. In order to keep profits robust, drug
makers must discover breakthrough medicines that can garner
premium prices. But the expensive cost of biomedical
technology these days means that even Merck can't make those
kinds of discoveries alone.
   Under the new venture, called Du Pont Merck
Pharmaceuticals Co., Merck, already acclaimed as the premier
drug research company in the U.S., will get access to all of
Du Pont's experimental drugs and its small but productive
research operation. Merck's top officials said they broached
the idea of a partnership last year in an effort to obtain
new drugs needed to maintain Merck's rapid profit growth.
   "We're convinced that we have to increase our access to
R&amp;D if we want to increase our world-wide market share" of
the pharmaceutical business, said Roy Vagelos, chairman and
chief executive of Merck. Outright acquisitions of other drug
makers would be too costly, he said. Instead, "we looked to a
company with a top-notch research operation, but that needed
the marketing and development skills we could offer."
   Although Merck's list of drugs and its research pipeline
is the envy of many drug makers, company officials conceded
that they needed outside help to sustain Merck as a "premium
growth company," said Francis Spiegel, the company's senior
vice president.
   Merck officials have smarted from some analysts' criticism
that the company couldn't maintain its past performance.
Merck profit growth has slowed this year as the company
pumped up R&amp;D funding to $750 million and spent heavily to
increase the size of its sales force. Earnings for the first
six months of 1990 rose 18.6% to $874 million, or $2.23 a
share, ending four years of quarterly profit increases of 25%
or more.
   Company officials also say that the merger that formed
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. galvanized their belief that they
needed to increase the company's product line faster than
Merck's R&amp;D operation could manage on its own. Other recent
mergers have produced SmithKline Beecham Corp. and Marion
Merrell Dow Inc. Meanwhile, American Home Products Corp.
acquired A.H. Robins Co., Hoffmann-La Roche acquired 60% of
Genentech Inc., and Eastman Kodak Co. acquired Sterling Drug
Co.
   "This is our answer to all that," Mr. Spiegel said. "It
gets us more aggressive, gives us more access to product and
helps us strengthen our global business. We accomplish all
those objectives without paying the huge premiums that can
dilute current earnings and without the problems associated
with melding two corporations." Both companies said the
agreement won't dilute their earnings.
   Dr. Vagelos said he expects products from Du Pont's
research to help Merck "have medicines to treat every major
type of illness." The company believes that in coming years
it will need a broad product line to negotiate with health
insurance plans and hospitals joining forces to buy medicines
at discounted prices.
   For Du Pont, the venture will mean a much-needed presence
abroad as well as the chance to share in the revenue of
certain Merck products. Under the agreement, the new venture
will sell several Merck products in West Germany, France,
Italy, Great Britain and Spain. In particular, it will
eventually have the right to co-market, along with Merck,
Merck's experimental drug Proscar, a drug for treating
enlarged prostates that is expected to generate huge sales
when approved for use.
   "We realized that if we ever were going to make it as a
drug company we needed to be able to sell our new products in
foreign markets," said Joseph Mollica, a Du Pont vice
president who will head the new venture. Mr. Mollica said the
foreign operation, which he expects to expand to Japan, will
generate revenue one to two years earlier than if Du Pont
waited for the drugs to gain approval in the U.S., where drug
approvals come slower than abroad.
   Most importantly, Merck will help Du Pont push new drugs
through its pipeline, the companies' officials said. Du
Pont's researchers get high marks in the industry for several
novel drugs, including treatments for Alzheimer's disease,
arthritis, pain relief, and others to lower cholesterol and
prevent heart attacks.
   Merck was first attracted to Du Pont last year, after its
researchers beat out several companies, including Merck, in
developing a new drug for high blood pressure called an A2
inhibitor. In October, Merck acquired the rights to
co-develop the drug, and soon afterward proposed the broader
agreement. "Discovering the A2 drug was an outstanding
accomplishment," Dr. Vagelos says. "It showed us a lot about
the quality of their research."
   The venture was announced after the close of trading
yesterday. Merck stock closed at $89 a share, up 50 cents in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Also on the Big
Board, Du Pont shares rose 50 cents to close at $39.375.

@  New Drug May Slow Parkinson's Disease

   Preliminary tests in Parkinson's disease patients suggest that a new medicine born of research on illicit street drugs may slow the progress of the degenerative brain disorder. 

   Two California researchers reported that the medicine, called deprenyl, postponed the onset of severe symptoms of Parkinson's disease in a small group of patients with very early signs of the disorder. 
In the study, 27 patients given deprenyl went for an average 18 months before developing the severe symptoms, while another 27 patients given a placebo, or inactive drug, developed the symptoms after about 10 months. 

   The drug also slowed the rate of progress of the disease, as measured by several tests, by 40% to 80%, compared with those who took the placebo. 

   "It is a very encouraging result," said Ira Shoulson, a neurologist at the University of Rochester, N.Y. Dr. Shoulson helped set up a separate $10 million, federally sponsored test of deprenyl in 800 Parkinson's patients. 
That study, being conducted in 26 medical centers, will be completed by late 1990. 

   Parkinson's affects about a half million Americans, mostly over age 50, causing paralysis and uncontrollable tremors. 
L-dopa, the drug most commonly used against the disease, has side effects and loses its effectiveness over time. 
The authors of the new study said deprenyl might replace L-dopa or delay the need to use L-dopa. 

   Publication of the California study today in the journal Science is expected to stir interest in several companies. 
Somerset Pharmaceuticals Inc., in Denville, N.J., owns the U.S. rights to the drug under the brand name Selegiline. 
Somerset is owned in a 50-50 venture by Bolar Pharmaceutical Co., Copiague, N.Y., and Mylan Laboratories Inc., Pittsburgh, two small publicly-traded generic drug makers. 
The companies acquired Somerset for $33.5 million last year, because of growing interest in deprenyl. 

   Somerset began selling deprenyl in June after the Food and Drug Administration approved the drug for use in treating advanced stages of Parkinson's disease in combination with L-dopa. 
Prior studies had shown that deprenyl prolongs the effectiveness of L-dopa in relieving the disease's symptoms. 
L-dopa is sold under the brand name Sinemet by Merck &amp; Co. Deprenyl Research Ltd., a publicly-traded Toronto company, sells the drug, its only product, in Canada. 

   The new study's authors, James W. Tetrud and J. William Langston, of the Institute for Medical Research in San Jose, Calif., began their research after treating young drug abusers who developed severe Parkinson's-like symptoms. 
The symptoms, the researchers found, were caused by synthetic, heroin-like street drugs contaminated in their production with a chemical, called MPTP. 
The researchers found that MPTP caused the distinctive symptoms by killing the same brain cells destroyed by Parkinson's. 

   Further studies by the researchers found that MPTP was actually converted by a brain enzyme into another chemical, which carried out the cell destruction. 
By searching through the literature of medical research, the Californians found that the brain enzyme could be blocked by deprenyl, which had been developed in Hungary as an anti-depressant. 

   After studies showed that deprenyl could block Parkinson's-like symptoms in test animals administered MPTP, several research teams rushed to show the drug would be similarly effective in blocking the enzyme in humans. 
In an interview, Dr. Langston said his results need to be confirmed; he said he hoped the large federal study organized by Dr. Shoulson will do that. 
But, he said, his findings provide the first evidence that the progression of a degenerative nerve disease can be slowed. 
Several researchers are now testing deprenyl against Alzheimer's disease and amytrophic lateral sclerosis, known as Lou Gehrig's disease. 
Both are degenerative brain disorders similar to Parkinson's. 

   Dr. Langston said research into MPTP also is seeking clues to the cause of Parkinson's. 
He and his colleague have speculated that some toxic chemical in the environment kicks off the disease, mimicking MPTP in the brain. 
He and others are attempting to identify the environmental substance.

   Trials of Du Pont,
   Merck Heart Drug

   U.S. health officials halted a trial of a new drug to
treat mild heart rhythm irregularities after results showed a
higher incidence of death among people taking the drug
compared to a dummy pill.
   The decision, by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood
Institute, is a disappointment for Du Pont Merck
Pharmaceutical Co., which markets the drug, moricizine, as a
treatment for life-threatening arrhythmia. The study, known
as the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial, or CAST II, was
designed to find out whether the medicine improved long-term
survival of patients with less severe irregularities.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "In the sense that we didn't come up with a cure, it's a
disappointment," says Lawrence Friedman, chief of clinical
trials at the NHLBI, part of the National Institutes of
Health.
   But he says the estimated 5,000 to 10,000 people taking
the drug for severe arrhythmia should continue using it
unless advised against it by a doctor.
   The drug, marketed under the brand name Ethmozine, was
licensed from the Soviet Union by Du Pont Co.'s Du Pont
Pharmaceuticals unit more than a decade ago and developed for
marketing in the U.S. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
approved the drug for severe arrythmias in June 1990. In
January, the unit became part of Du Pont Merck, a joint
venture between Du Pont, the Wilmington, Del., chemical
concern, and Merck &amp; Co., the drug company based in Rahway,
N.J. Ethmozine's annual sales are about $5 million, says
Ronald Nordman, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc., less than 1%
of the venture's revenue.
   The CAST study began in 1987 and originally involved two
other drugs, but trials of those others were suspended in
April 1989 when initial results showed increased deaths among
patients taking them. But those results, based on 908
patients, were promising for Ethmozine and the study of that
drug continued. However, on July 30, two research monitoring
boards found that among equal numbers of 1,346 patients
treated over 18 months, 97 of those taking Ethmozine had
died, compared with 74 who had taken a placebo.
   The difference wasn't as severe as in the previous two
drugs, Dr. Friedman says, "but there was an adverse trend and
there was almost no chance that we would show benefit."
   About three million Americans suffer from abnormal heart
beats and about 300,000 die each year from so-called
ventricular arrhythmias that develop in the ventricles, the
heart's lower chambers, the focus of this drug's activity. A
class of drugs known as beta blockers, used to treat high
blood pressure, is also prescribed for arrhythmia.

   The new joint venture in pharmaceuticals between Du Pont
Co. and Merck &amp; Co. has recruited the former chief of
research and development at Genentech Inc. to lead its own
drug discovery efforts.
   David W. Martin Jr., formerly senior vice president,
research and development, at Genentech, is expected to be
named to the new position this month, if Du Pont and Merck
can iron out final details of their agreement by then.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Martin, 49 years old, confirmed in an interview that
he has been named to head research and development at the
venture, called Du Pont Merck Pharmaceuticals Co. He remarked
that he was "within two days" of taking a position at a West
Coast biotech concern when the Du Pont-Merck offer beckoned.
He has been a consultant to Genentech since resigning from
his executive post at the South San Francisco, Calif.,
company last November.
   Dr. Martin said the Du Pont-Merck venture attracted him
with the breadth of its technology and what he called the
commitment of the venture partners to long-term goals.
"They're careful in picking what they want to do, but they
don't change direction," he said.
   The joint venture, announced in July, is a recent example
of the spate of cooperative ventures and mergers to crop up
among drug companies as they cope with growing research and
development costs and global competition. Du Pont, the
diversified chemicals concern based in Wilmington, Del., is
putting all its drug business into the venture. Merck, of
Rahway, N.J., is contributing rights to market some of its
drugs and an undisclosed amount of cash.
   Merck, often called the premier drug research company in
its industry, is using the venture to tap the new-drug
pipeline at Du Pont. For Du Pont, the venture offers a quick
way to expand its presence abroad, through rights to certain
Merck products in Europe.
   A Du Pont spokesman confirmed Dr. Martin's appointment but
declined to say whether the new company is looking outside to
fill other top positions.
   A final agreement on the joint venture hasn't yet been
reached, but Joseph A. Mollica, currently a Du Pont vice
president, already has been named chief executive officer of
the new company. Dr. Martin will report to Mr. Mollica and
assume some of the research management tasks that Mr.
Mollica, a scientist by training, has had within Du Pont.
   At Genentech, Dr. Martin presided over a research program
that has produced some of the early fruits of biotechnology,
such as genetically engineered human growth hormone, sold
under the trade name Protropin, and the heart drug known as
TPA or Activase. But at the Du Pont-Merck venture, he will be
managing a far larger staff, about 1,500 instead of the 700
at Genentech.
   A spokeswoman for Merck said that officials who would be
familiar with appointments at the new company weren't
available for comment.

   PINE BROOK, N.J. -- Du Pont Co. and Du Pont Merck
Pharmaceutical Co., a joint venture between Du Pont and Merck
&amp; Co., scaled back their interest in the experimental
anti-cancer substance interleukin-1.
   The joint venture of the giant chemical concern and Merck
said it returned all rights over sales of therapeutic
products from interleukin-1 to Pine Brook-based Cistron
Biotechnology Inc.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The action is part of a contract among the three concerns
in which Du Pont will continue to purchase interleukin-1 from
Cistron for sale to research facilities at universities,
pharmaceutical concerns and government installations.
   The new agreement will allow Cistron, a small firm with
about $1.5 million in annual revenue, to seek other partners
among pharmaceutical or other companies to help it develop
products from interleukin-1. Previously, Du Pont Merck
actively pursued such products through an agreement with
Cistron.
   An industry executive speculated that the agreement could
signal a lessened interest on the part of some major drug
concerns in interleukin-1. Neither Du Pont nor Merck
commented, nor would any of the parties discuss financial
terms of the agreement.
   Interleukin, a product of gene-splicing technology, causes
cells of the immune system to grow and has been thought to
bolster the body's immunity. In addition to interleukin-1, a
related substance, interleukin-2, has undergone testing at
the National Cancer Institute. It is a possible anti-cancer
drug that also strengthens the immune system. Cistron said it
believes the material has potential uses in the treatment of
cancer and such autoimmune diseases as arthritis and systemic
lupus.
   A spokesman for Cistron said Du Pont Merck will have a
"more limited" role in marketing any possible interleukin
products than they held under a 1985 agreement with Cistron.

   FDA Approves Du Pont Imaging Agent
   That Can Detect Heart-Attack Damage

<LP>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a new
imaging agent that can help doctors diagnose and treat the
damage caused by heart attacks without using invasive
procedures.
   The product, called Cardiolite, is an injectable chemical
tracing agent that can produce images of blood flow in the
heart when viewed under certain medical imaging cameras. It
was developed by Du Pont Co., Wilmington, Del., and will be
sold by Du Pont Merck Pharmaceutical Co., a joint venture put
together earlier this year by Du Pont and Merck &amp; Co.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Officials at Du Pont Merck said Cardiolite may be
especially useful in helping to diagnose the exact nature of
a heart attack within hours after it occurs. Unlike other
imaging products, Cardiolite can be injected during the
attack and the blood flow can be recorded immediately, giving
a doctor an instant picture of the attack. Other techniques
can't be used until a patient's condition has been
stabilized.
   "The availability of {Cardiolite} is an important step
forward in cardiac imaging and the treatment and prevention
of heart disease," said Daniel Berman, director of nuclear
cardiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles. "I'm
certain it will allow many medical centers to significantly
upgrade their ability to diagnose heart problems."
   Cardiolite is composed of a chemical called sestamibi that
migrates quickly to undamaged heart muscle cells after it's
injected into the bloodstream. The product also includes a
radioisotope called technetium 99 that allows an imaging
camera to pick up the sestamibi. Thus doctors can trace the
flow of blood as it moves through undamaged portions of the
heart. They also can use the product to illuminate the
heart's pumping action, blood flow through the heart's
arteries and areas in the heart where blood can't flow
because of damage from the attack.
   Currently, such images are most often produced by cardiac
catheterization, a technique in which a thin optical wire is
threaded into the groin or arm and snaked through blood
vessels to the heart. Some doctors believe that advances in
cardiac imaging eventually may reduce the need for some
invasive catheterizations.
   Doctors also can view such damage by injecting a chemical
called thallium and tracing it with medical cameras. But
thallium doesn't produce as strong a signal as technetium 99.
"Only a handful of very specialized medical centers can
produce truly useful pictures with thallium," Dr. Berman
said. "{Cardiolite} will be much easier for most hospitals to
use."
   Thallium is used most often in a stress test that's
designed to detect if arteries carrying blood to the heart
are blocked. Du Pont is one of several companies that makes
thallium for cardiac testing. Du Pont officials said
Cardiolite is an advance over its thallium products because
thallium's radioactivity is more difficult to handle. Also,
Cardiolite is longer acting than thallium and can produce
images for four hours after being injected, while thallium
images last only 15 minutes.
   Cardiolite is one of two new cardiac imaging products
developed in recent years by scientists. Last week, the FDA
also approved a product called Cardiotec that will be
marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Cardiotec also uses
technetium 99 to light up an image, but involves a different
agent, called teboroxime, for getting to the heart muscle
cells.
   Some doctors think Cardiolite may be the more widely used
of the two products, because it lasts longer in the body,
producing images for a longer period of study.
   Cardiolite is the first new product to be marketed by the
Du Pont Merck venture. The company will market other products
developed by Du Pont's drug and diagnostics research
programs.

   Your description of the drug deprenyl (page-one, Nov. 27)
and its role in slowing the progression of Parkinson's
disease doesn't console the many thousands of PD victims in
either the earliest diagnosed stages or in the initial years
or months of Sinemet treatment whose physicians would have
prescribed deprenyl for them if the Food and Drug
Administration had not made its importation or use in the
U.S. illegal by denying approval of the drug.
   For years victims in England were taking the drug with
beneficial results and with no hint of dangerous side
effects, while desperate Americans, like this writer, were
forced to go without or to travel to London to get a year's
supply and then smuggle it back into the U.S.

   And all because the FDA was not convinced of its efficacy.
Its safety was never in doubt. No matter how large a
proportion of our gross national product we devote to health
care, we will have inferior standards until the "thalidomide
law" is modified to provide that the FDA's role is to monitor
the safety only, not the alleged efficacy, of drugs dispensed
in this country.

   Your article about the Hungarian drug deprenyl states that
the Hungarian crown jewels were spirited out of Hungary by
U.S. soldiers and that, subsequently, the U.S. government was
persuaded to return them to Hungary.
   There were no U.S. troops in Hungary during World War II.
The crown jewels were removed from Hungary by the then-prime
minister (Szollosi) and were taken with him by soldiers of
the U.S. 86th Infantry Division in Southern Bavaria (Germany)
shortly before the end of the war.
   The jewels were later returned to Hungary, not as a result
of gentle persuasion but as ransom for a newspaper reporter
who had been accused of spying.

   While you stated that deprenyl increased the life span of
Joseph Knoll's experimental rats by several months, human
equivalency helps to put the work in perspective.
   Mr. Knoll's rats were the equivalent of 65 years old in
humans when he started them on deprenyl. All of the controls
died before any of the deprenyl rats, which lived the human
equivalent of 120 to 150 years. Furthermore, the deprenyl
rats regained a youthful appearance and activity, which they
kept throughout their remaining life span. These results were
largely replicated by other experiments at the University of
Toronto. This is not to say that what happens in experimental
rats necessarily happens in humans. However, rats are used as
experimental animals precisely because what happens in them
is so remarkably close to what happens in humans.
   Deprenyl was available for use in Europe as a Parkinson's
treatment for 10 years before it finally was approved here.
How many people were condemned to premature death by this
delay of the FDA? The FDA regulations and restrictions also
are responsible for the much-higher price of deprenyl here
than in other parts of the world.

cows remove a significant amount of carbon dioxide, another greenhouse gas,
their contribution of these gases may be only 5 percent, said Duane Chapman.  </TEXT>

   HDL Cholesterol Finding
   Helps Predict Heart Risk

<TEXT>
   SCIENTISTS say a new cholesterol finding will help doctors
predict who will have heart attacks.
   For some time, most doctors have been convinced that
levels of total cholesterol above 200 milligrams per
deciliter of blood increase the risk of heart disease. More
recent research has shown that a "good" form of cholesterol,
high-density lipoproteins (HDL), can reduce that risk when it
is between 40 and 60 milligrams.
   Yet doctors often are baffled by how to interpret the
total cholesterol and HDL readings together. "We've thought
the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL is what matters most,"
says Charles Hennekens of Harvard University and Boston's
Brigham and Women's Hospital. "But we needed proof of what
that ratio is."
   Dr. Hennekens and his colleagues searched for the perfect
ratio by comparing cholesterol and HDL levels of 246 men who
had heart attacks with a similar group of men without heart
disease. The subjects came from 15,000 doctors recruited in
the Physicians Health Study, which in 1988 found that daily
aspirin use could prevent heart attacks. When they entered
the study in 1982, the physicians provided blood samples that
the researchers stored.
   In today's New England Journal of Medicine, the
researchers say doctors with a ratio of overall cholesterol
to HDL cholesterol of three-to-one had the lowest risk of an
attack. The risk rose 53% for each ratio number above three.
Thus, someone with a cholesterol level above 200 isn't at
risk if the HDL is above 66.6. "This offers very strong
evidence of the protective value of HDL," Dr. Hennekens says,
noting that HDL can be boosted by exercise and drinking
modest amounts of alcohol.
                                                                                                       

   Sniffing Heliotrope Helps
   MRI Patients Sit Still
                                                                                                       

   HOSPITALS may smell like flowers someday.
   Researchers long have believed that aromas can affect
mood. Odors that remind people of pleasant experiences, such
as the smell of apple pie baking, can help them relax, while
a sour stink makes people tense. In recent years, scientists
at fragrance companies have intensified the search for
"psychological smells" to enhance perfumes and cosmetics, but
proof that specific scents sway emotion is limited.
   Now there are strong hints that heliotropin, a synthetic
version of the heliotrope flower's fragrance, is an effective
sedative.
   Doctors at New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center have been seeking ways to calm worried patients
undergoing cancer-detection tests. Agitated patients who move
about can distort images of internal organs produced in
magnetic-resonanceimaging machines.
   Two staff psychologists, William Redd and Sharon Manne,
looked into sedating scents, settling on heliotropin after
having hospital staffers sniff a bunch of smells. In a study,
the psychologists compared stress levels of 40 patients
undergoing MRI who were exposed to the scent through a nasal
respirator with 45 others getting only fresh air.
   In an unpublished report, the researchers say two-thirds
of the perfumed patients found the scent especially pleasant
and reported much less anxiety than those who weren't exposed
to it. The researchers say that they were "surprised" by how
well the fragrance relieved distress, but that further
studies are needed.
                                                                                                       

   Search in Du Pont's Attic
   Yields Alzheimer's Drug
                                                                                                       

   SCIENTISTS discovered a new Alzheimer's drug by rummaging
in Du Pont's attic of old chemicals.
   Du Pont Merck Pharmaceutical Co., a year-old joint venture
between the Wilmington, Del., chemical maker and Merck, the
Rahway, N.J., drug maker, is beginning a 750-patient test of
a medicine called linopirine. The drug spurs brain cells to
pump out extra acetylcholine, a chemical messenger that
carries nerve impulses involved in memory. A hallmark of
Alzheimer's is a shortage of acetylcholine caused by the
death of brain cells.
   "Our strategy was to stimulate what cells are still alive
to produce more acetylcholine than usual," says Robert Taber,
vice president for research at Du Pont Merck, which had kept
mum about the drug until recently.
   Four years ago, Du Pont scientists began scanning the
company's library of tens of thousands of unused chemicals
for ones with a structure similar to several medicines used
in Europe that trigger a small discharge of acetylcholine.
After screening only 100 chemicals, a brief hunt by such
standards, the team found an especially potent stimulator of
acetylcholine.
   Subsequent tinkering produced linopirine. In several
experiments, the drug improved the ability of laboratory mice
with artificially impaired memories to avoid electrical
shocks. In one test, rodents given linopirine remembered the
shocks more often than those given THA, a Warner-Lambert drug
that was unfavorably reviewed by regulators recently. Du Pont
Merck officials say a preliminary, 500-patient test of
linopirine was "encouraging," but add that a new study
comparing it with a placebo is needed.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   AN ANALYSIS in the Journal of the American Medical
Association of several studies provides strong evidence that
a daily tablet of aspirin can reduce a pregnant woman's risk
of developing high blood pressure, which can be dangerous to
her and the fetus. . . . A report in the Lancet in June found
that a daily aspirin reduced the risk of giving birth to
low-weight babies among women who previously had such a
problem. Both studies emphasize that aspirin shouldn't be
used without a doctor's supervision.

<HL> Du Pont Co. Stops Backing Ampligen, Test Drug for AIDS </HL>
<AUTHOR> Michael Waldholz (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<CO> DD </CO>
<IN> PHA </IN>
<TEXT>
   Du Pont Co. said it terminated support for research into a promising experimental AIDS drug called Ampligen, but declined to give its reasons. 

   Du Pont was backing several studies of Ampligen under an agreement with HEM Research Inc., a closely held concern that developed the drug. 
Du Pont said it dissolved that pact. 

   Ampligen received considerable attention last year as a potential treatment for acquired immune deficiency syndrome following initial reports that its use boosted the immune system of patients with AIDS-related complex, or ARC, an early stage of the disease. 

   A spokesman for Wilmington, Del.-based Du Pont said the company couldn't elaborate on its decision, but in a brief joint statement by Du Pont and Philadelphia-based HEM, the companies said HEM would continue conducting clinical trials of the drug and that Du Pont would continue supplying the drug for the studies. 

   A source familiar with Du Pont's decision said it stemmed from some disappointing "interim" results that the company has seen in studies of the drug. 
The source said that the data that Du Pont has seen indicates that "at current formulations and doses, Ampligen doesn't seem to have any effect." 

   But an HEM official and a researcher involved in Ampligen studies said they knew of no evidence indicating the drug wasn't useful. 
Roy Urdanoff, HEM vice president and treasurer, said he believed Du Pont's action was a "business decision." 
He added: "We're still very enthusiastic about Ampligen." 

   David R. Strayer, a professor at Hahnemann University, Philadelphia, who is overseeing a 300-patient, multicenter trial of Ampligen, said, "I know of no interim data to indicate why Du Pont would back out of their agreement with HEM." 
Dr. Strayer said his trial is continuing. 

   Last December, Dr. Strayer presented the results of a 25-patient study of Ampligen indicating the drug might be useful in delaying the onset of AIDS. 
In June 1986, a 10-patient test of the drug by researchers at Vanderbilt University indicated the drug improved immune system responses and reduced the amount of the AIDS virus in the blood of AIDS patients.

FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: BOC in Pounds 48m drug deal with Du Pont
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOC, the healthcare and industrial gases group, yesterday announced it had
purchased the Brevibloc European and North American operations of Du Pont
Merck Pharmaceutical for Dollars 72.5m (Pounds 48m).
Brevibloc is a drug used in operating theatres to control heart rate and
blood pressure.
The product will be marketed by Anaquest, BOC's pharmaceuticals division
which specialises in products aimed at anaesthetists.
The business, which last year generated sales of Dollars 15m, has been
growing at more than 20 per cent a year, according to BOC.
The group said it hoped to be able to use its specialist marketing force to
boost Brevibloc's sales. Mr Roger Stoll, president of BOC Health Care, said
the drug complemented its current portfolio of anaesthetic and acute care
drugs.
Du Pont Merck is retaining the product rights in markets outside North
America and Europe.
Mr Joseph Mollica, president of Du Pont Merck Pharmaceutical, said:
'Brevibloc no longer fits in our core business strategy that focuses on the
office-based physician market-place.'
The move is part of BOC's efforts to boost its healthcare operations which
increased sales by 4.2 per cent to Pounds 512m last year.
BOC needs to lift its US revenues following the expiry at the end of last
month of the American patents for Forane, its anaesthetic.
Anaesthetics represent about 60 per cent of the group's health-related
profits, according to Kleinwort Benson.

   Stressed out by success, leading companies of the nation's
most profitable industry will keep marrying to survive.
   So say top pharmaceutical industry executives who
overwhelmingly agree that Upjohn Co., Warner-Lambert Co.,
Schering-Plough Inc., and Syntex Corp. will soon either be
acquired, make a sizable purchase themselves, or forge major
joint ventures.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In fact, the executives say, every other major drug
company in the U.S., Europe and even Japan is actively
prowling for deals. "We're constantly looking for new
opportunities; much more aggressively than even just a few
years ago," says Francis H. Spiegel Jr., a senior vice
president at Merck &amp; Co.
   The companies named above either deny or decline comment
on merger plans, and none of the executives will breach
industry etiquette by publicly naming names. But most agree
that cross-currents, which have sent 15 major drug makers
into one another's embrace since 1988, are turning a formerly
placid lot of companies into makers of deals, crossborder
megamergers, marketing alliances, and product swaps.
   The drug industry boasts a return on sales over 20%.
Still, "Few {drug} companies on their own can afford truly
innovative research these days," says Jan Leshly, head of the
pharmaceutical operations at SmithKline Beecham PLC, which
was formed by a merger in 1989. "More consolidation is
inevitable."
   Driving all this is a financial imperative to uncover
novel medicines. Until recently, many companies stoked
profits by developing "me-too" versions of competitors'
drugs, such as the dozen similar-acting arthritis drugs to
flood the market in recent years.
   But "only distinctly different medicines whose benefits
can justify premium prices can generate the profits to
underwrite big-time research," says Ralph Larsen, chairman
and chief executive officer at Johnson &amp; Johnson.
   For consumers this news is both good and bad. Companies
are racing each other for drugs that provide significant
benefits over existing medicines for Alzheimer's disease,
cancer, AIDS, arthritis, heart disease, asthma, multiple
sclerosis, and a raft of other scourges.
   But the competition costs. Unlike five, 10 or 20 years
ago, pursuit of groundbreaking medicines requires "truly
innovative research" that probes disease mechanisms at their
most basic levels, says Mr. Leshly. Because many countries
outside the U.S. regulate drug prices and U.S. federal law
now allows for quicker release of inexpensive generic copies
when patents lapse, drug companies are charging sky-high
prices for original medicines.
   Glaxo Holding PLC's new drug, Zofran, for example, combats
nausea caused by cancer chemotherapy, allowing doctors to
boost dosages of toxic anti-cancer drugs. But Glaxo is
charging hospitals an average of about $125 for a day's
treatment, adding hundreds of thousands of dollars to a
hospital's annual drug bill.
   Glaxo's experimental drug against migraine headaches also
offers better therapy. But the company's price in Holland,
where the drug is already available, suggests it may cost $30
to $80 a treatment. Analysts predict each of the new Glaxo
drugs could pull in annual sales of $200 million to $500
million, the kind of cash the large company will need to grow
at the premium rate demanded by Wall Street.
   For most drug companies, keeping research humming until
they hit a similar winner means they must weather fallow
periods, something few companies can now afford on their own.
And while they set prices freely in the U.S., there are
rumblings that Congress may someday exert cost controls.
   "There is a lot of opportunity, but you need a lot of
money" to seize it, says Richard Gelb, chairman and chief
executive of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., which resulted from a
merger also in 1989. "I don't know that {Bristol-Myers} or
Squibb would have been able to do it going alone."
   Says Charles A. Sanders, chief executive of the U.S.
operations of Glaxo, widely rumored to be acquisition
hunting: "To be a big player a company must spend somewhere
north of $500 million a year and grow it by more than 10% or
15% a year. Those who can't spend that will be left behind;
they'll be good candidates for a merger."
   And even though research spending is way up -- drug makers
spending the highest percent of sales on
research-productivity are in decline, says John Wilkerson, an
industry consultant. Research and development spending by the
world's main drug companies quadrupled during the 1980s to $8
billion. But the applications to the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration to market new drugs has declined about 60% to
about 110 in 1989.
   Moreover, Mr. Wilkerson says the bill for developing a
truly different drug that will be approved for doctor use in
the year 2000 will come to $400 million, up from $150 million
that it cost for a drug approved in 1990.
   That explains why even mighty Merck, the biggest medicine
maker, also has collaboration fever. To keep profits zooming
by 20% or more a year that it has achieved since 1985, "we
need access to more R&amp;D," than even Merck's $1 billion
research budget this year can generate, says Mr. Spiegel, the
senior vice president.
   Thus, last August Merck acquired development rights to six
experimental compounds of Du Pont Co. In an unusual joint
venture that may serve as a model for others, both companies
will market whatever Du Pont can produce with Merck's help.
   Despite Du Pont's deep pockets and several important
experimental-drug discoveries, its 10-year old drug research
operation could no longer go it alone. "The rules of the game
have changed, the ante is much higher," says Joseph Mollica,
a Du Pont vice president in charge of the Merck joint
venture. "We lacked a marketing presence in Europe and Japan"
and buying companies that had them would have been enormously
expensive, says Edgar S. Woolard, Du Pont's chairman and
chief executive.
   Indeed, companies without extensive foreign marketing
operations, cutting edge research, and one or more potential
blockbuster products are the ones cited as merger or
acquisition candidates.
   A persistent rumor on Wall Street and within the industry
says Glaxo will acquire Upjohn of Kalamazoo, Mich. Glaxo's
research pipeline is bursting with new products, but its U.S.
marketing operation is small and could benefit from Upjohn's
large U.S. sales force. Upjohn, meanwhile, hasn't any new
drugs on the near horizon; its best-selling medicines, the
tranquilizers Halcion and Xanax, are about to lose their
patents, and the company's presence overseas is weak.
   Glaxo and Upjohn say they don't comment on such rumors.
Upjohn's current stock-market value is about $7.4 billion,
based on its price of $41.75 a share in New York Stock
Exchange trading yesterday.
   Warner-Lambert is similarly vulnerable. Profit rose 14%
last year to $105 million on strong sales of its popular
consumer brands and several of its prescription drugs. But
Ronnie Cresswell, manager of the company's Parke-Davis drug
business, concedes that "we've got to get the drug discovery
program producing."
   Warner-Lambert, with a current stock-market value of about
$9.4 billion, has recently revitalized the drug research it
allowed to languish in the 1970s. Research spending this year
will be $420 million, one-quarter higher than two years ago.
As a result, Parke-Davis scientists are racing against Merck
and others to develop new drugs against asthma, arthritis,
allergies, diabetes, stroke, heart disease and mental health
problems.
   But none of these potential breakthrough medicines is
expected to be approved soon. Meanwhile, Warner-Lambert's
best-selling anti-cholesterol medicine Lopid will lose its
patent in 1993. To sustain revenue pending emergence of these
products, the company agreed several years ago to test a drug
against Alzheimer's disease called THA.
   But two studies presented to the FDA earlier this year
found the drug's benefit to Alzheimer's patients to be
equivocal. The company says even without sales from THA the
company can afford to stay independent. But some analysts say
the company's ability to fund research adequately may be
jeopardized
   Says Mr. Cresswell, "So far {Warner-Lambert's} board
realizes the heavy investment we need to make to R&amp;D. We can
only hope it stays patient."

FT  26 JUN 92 / Technology: New era looks to mind drugs - In the second
article of a series on drug research, Clive Cookson outlines treatments for
mental conditions from anxiety to memory loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pharmaceutical industry has an abysmal record in treating disorders of
the brain and nervous system. While new drugs have transformed the outlook
for people suffering from infectious illnesses, heart disease, and
gastro-intestinal problems, most psychiatric patients depend on medicines
discovered several decades ago.
Current treatments for mental conditions, from mild anxiety to severe
psychosis, emerged during the 'black box' era of drug discovery. Doctors
observed that they relieved symptoms - often poorly and unpredictably - but
pharmacologists had no idea how they worked. For the most serious problems -
degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's - there is still nothing
that really works.
The outlook, however, is much brighter, as scientific discoveries about the
chemistry and biology of the brain find their way into new drugs. The ones
being introduced during the 1990s are based on an understanding of
neurotransmitters (chemical messengers which send signals between cells) and
receptors (protein molecules on the cell which receive the signals and
initiate specific biological responses). After the year 2000, there is the
prospect of far superior treatments based on the genetic processes involved
in mental disorders.
The best known neurotransmitter is 5-HT, also called 5-hyroxytryptamine or
serotonin, which is active not only in the brain but also in other parts of
the body. It is associated with several types of receptor, each giving a
different biological response. The pharmaceutical industry is developing
drugs to interact with each specific type, as an agonist to stimulate the
receptor or as an antagonist to block it. Glaxo of the UK has been
investigating 5-HT systems for almost 20 years and expects a spectacular
payback from two drugs: sumatriptan and ondansetron.
Sumatriptan (trade name Imigran) is the first effective treatment for
migraine, the intense recurrent headache suffered by at least one adult in
12. It was launched last year as an injection and is being introduced in the
UK this month in more convenient form as pills. With sumatriptan ahead of
competition, its potential sales are huge - more than Pounds 1bn a year - if
it can overcome doctors' fear of side effects.
Sumatriptan is an agonist for the 5-HT1 category of receptor, stimulating
the uptake of 5-HT in the cranial blood vessels. That reverses the swelling
which triggers a migraine attack. Glaxo had hoped sumatriptan would have no
effect elsewhere in the body but experience shows that some patients feel
tightness in the chest after injections. That is presumably because blood
vessels elsewhere in the body contain a few of the same 5-HT1 receptors.
Glaxo says sumatriptan's side effects are insignificant for healthy people
but they show how difficult it is to make a selective receptor-based drug.
Ondansetron (Zofran) is an antagonist for a different receptor type, the
5-HT3. It was launched two years ago as an anti-emetic to prevent nausea and
vomiting induced by cancer therapy, but Glaxo is now carrying out clinical
trials with ondansetron for a range of psychiatric conditions including
anxiety, schizophrenia, addiction and age-associated memory impairment.
Glaxo researchers are understandably cautious about proclaiming ondansetron
to be a psychiatric wonder-drug. They blanch when outsiders talk of it as a
potential 'smart drug' which could improve everyone's memory.
Mike Tyers, pharmacology director for Glaxo Group Research, says the 5-HT3
receptors on neurones (nerve cells in the brain) 'seem to be there to
control things when they go wrong.' When everything is working properly,
'they are fairly silent.' If so, a 5-HT3 antagonist such as ondansetron may
help to restore the balance in several disorders, without side-effects.
Another group of new drugs based on the 5-HT system is leading to improved
treatments for depression. The specific serotonin re-uptake inhibitors
(SSRIs), as they are known, increase the low 5-HT levels in the brain which
are associated with many forms of depression.
Eli Lilley of the US is already selling more than Dollars 1bn a year of its
pioneering SSRI, fluoxetine (Prozac) launched in 1988. In hot pursuit is a
second generation of SSRIs led by paroxetine (Seroxat), which was developed
jointly by Novo Nordisk of Denmark and SmithKline Beecham, the
Anglo-American group.
SSRIs have fewer side effects than the 'tricyclic' drugs which have
dominated antidepressant treatment for 30 years. Yet SSRIs still leave much
to be desired: they take at least two weeks to relieve depression and they
fail to work in about one third of patients. That may reflect partly the
poor quality of clinical diagnosis in depression and other non-acute mental
disorders.
Some scientists believe that all forms of depression ultimately work through
a common biochemical pathway. If they are right - and not everyone agrees
with the theory - it may eventually be possible to find a fast-acting drug
that will help anyone who is clinically depressed.
The greatest neurological challenge for pharmaceutical research is to find a
cure for the degenerative brain diseases which lead inexorably to dementia
and death. The most prevalent is Alzheimer's, which affects as many as 20
per cent of people over 70.
The search for an Alzheimer's treatment has led to a new class of drugs, the
nootropics, developed to enhance memory and other cognitive functions. The
first generation of nootropics aims to increase the amount of acetylcholine
in the brain. Alzheimer's patients have a marked deficit of this
neurotransmitter.
Most of the Alzheimer's drugs developed recently work indirectly by
inhibiting an enzyme called cholinesterase which breaks down acetylcholine.
They include piracetam from UCB of Belgium; oxiracetam from SmithKline
Beecham; tacrine from Warner-Lambert of the US; and physostigmine from
Forest Laboratories of the US. Although they have shown promise in clinical
trials, the manufacturers have not yet produced evidence strong enough to
convince the US Food and Administration to licence any of the drugs.
Du Pont Merck, the pharmaceutical joint venture between Du Pont and Merck of
the US, has a promising anti-dementia drug now in late clinical trials which
works in a different way. It acts directly to stimulate the release of
acetylcholine and other neurotransmitters in the brain. The drug (chemical
name linopirdine) is noteworthy too for its unusually vivid and appealing
trade name - Aviva.
However none of these memory enhancing drugs, even Aviva, can do more than
temporarily reverse or slow down the mental degeneration that is
characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. None prevents the build-up of tangled
plaques of amyloid protein, which progressively destroy patients' brains.
The best long-term hope for curing progressive dementias is to identify the
genetic mechanism responsible and then develop drugs to block its effect. In
the case of Alzheimer's, a fault in a gene coding for amyloid precursor
protein (APP) seems to be responsible. In a few families, this is inherited
but it is more often caused by environmental factors.
Many pharmaceutical researchers are now working on long-range projects to
block APP, though they are hampered by the fact that there is not yet a good
animal model for Alzheimer's. Athena Neurosciences of California is one of
the biotechnology companies furthest advanced in this area.
More futuristic still are ideas for repairing brain damage by growing new
nerve cells. That does not normally occur in an adult brain but scientists
are accumulating evidence that selective regeneration could be achieved by
removing some of the genetic factors that inhibit the process.
The series will continue next month by looking at asthma drugs.

<HL> Technology and Medicine: Du Pont, Hem End Study of Ampligen As AIDS Remedy </HL>

<SO> </SO>

<IN> PHA </IN>
<TEXT>
   A large study of the experimental AIDS drug Ampligen was terminated this week after its sponsors decided there was insufficient evidence that the drug is effective. 

   Du Pont Co. and Hem Research Inc., a small Philadelphia company, ended their jointly sponsored study of Ampligen following an "interim" analysis last week of data from the study. 
In a letter to doctors conducting the 330-patient study at 11 medical centers, officials of Du Pont and Hem said that a review of data "failed to show any difference between Ampligen and placebo that would justify continuation of the study." 

   The study's termination casts a widening shadow over a drug which had received considerable attention last year as a potential treatment for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
The interest followed the release of some initial reports that Ampligen boosted the immune system of patients with AIDS-related complex, or ARC, an early stage of the disease. 
There was some evidence that use of the drug blocked or slowed progress from ARC to AIDS. 

   Following the early reports, Du Pont, a Wilmington, Del., chemical and pharmaceuticals company, formed a joint agreement with Hem, which developed Ampligen, to produce the drug and conduct further studies. 
But in late August, the Wall Street Journal reported that Du Pont suddenly ended its involvement in the joint venture when a review by its officials of several studies indicated that the drug wasn't showing a significant effect. 

   But officials at Hem, a closely held company whose only product is Ampligen, argued that there was no evidence that the drug was ineffective. 
Hem said it would continue the 330-patient study. 
Du Pont agreed to continue supplying the drug for the study. 

   Now, in the letter this week to doctors conducting the study, officials from Hem and Du Pont said that about the same number of ARC patients taking a placebo and those taking Ampligen had progressed to AIDS. 
In telephone interviews, officials at Hem and Du Pont said that in test tube and animal studies Ampligen continued to show biological activity against the virus that causes AIDS. Ian Brick, chairman of Hem, said the company recently had doubled the dose of Ampligen to 400 milligrams in some patients in a separate study, and he expected to have results of an analysis of whether the drug worked better at the larger dose. 

   "I think Ampligen has an effect," Mr. Brick said. 
"Perhaps we have yet to find the proper dose." 
Mr. Brick said that patients in the terminated study would be given the option of continuing to receive Ampligen. 

   James Wells, a Du Pont official involved in the Ampligen project, said Du Pont had decided that the chances of getting Ampligen approved by the government didn't justify the kind of investment required, and that the company felt its resources could be better used to pursue other AIDS projects.

   Du Pont Co. and HEM Research Inc. agreed to settle
litigation stemming from the collapse of their joint venture
with an experimental AIDS drug.
   Under the agreement, Du Pont will pay HEM $2.8 million,
give up the 5% stake in HEM that it acquired in 1987 and
relinquish certain marketing and royalty rights to the drug,
called Ampligen.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The agreement, announced yesterday by HEM, brings to an
end the lawsuits that ensued after the close of a big
clinical trial meant to determine whether Ampligen slowed the
progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome in
patients infected with the AIDS virus.
   Du Pont, the Wilmington, Del., chemicals giant, had
quickly allied itself with HEM after HEM researchers reported
in the British medical journal Lancet encouraging but
inconclusive results from a small trial of Ampligen. Du Pont
has since said in court papers that it invested more than $30
million in HEM and its work with Ampligen, including the
large trial, which involved more than 300 patients.
   But after Ampligen failed to show efficacy in the large
trial, Du Pont alleged that it had been provided misleading
information by HEM, a closely held company based in
Philadelphia. Du Pont said the damages sought in its suit,
filed in a Delaware state court, far exceeded HEM's net worth
of $8.5 million at the end of 1988.
   HEM, for its part, has contended that the plastic bags Du
Pont used to package Ampligen, which is given intravenously,
impaired the drug's potency. During the initial trial
reported in the Lancet, the drug was packaged in glass
bottles.
   HEM countersued Du Pont, seeking $7.4 million it said it
was owed by Du Pont, plus other damages under
breach-of-contract claims. Those claims, as well as Du
Pont's, were dropped under the pact.
   E. Paul Charlap, HEM's chairman and chief executive
officer, called the settlement a "favorable outcome" for HEM.
A Du Pont spokesman replied that "both sides had claims and
counterclaims, and we came to this agreement."
   Even as the settlement was reached, though, another point
of contention between HEM and Du Pont arose. Although Du Pont
is to give its unused vials of Ampligen to HEM under the
accord, Du Pont destroyed raw material used to make the drug,
an anti-viral agent fashioned from double-stranded
ribonucleic acid.
   HEM officials estimated that the raw material could have
been used to make enough Ampligen to treat some 3,000
patients for a year. "Obviously, this is going to cause this
little company a lot of trouble" in expanding future trials,
said William M. Mitchell, a consultant to HEM and a pathology
professor at Vanderbilt University, adding that HEM had
thought it might gain possession of the material.
   The Du Pont spokesman said, "We had asked" HEM about the
raw material during settlement talks, "and they had no
interest. We had no use for it, so we destroyed it."
   About 30 people infected with the AIDS virus continue to
be treated with Ampligen from glass bottles under HEM's
auspices. In addition, HEM said, it recently expanded its
U.S. clinical trials in the use of Ampligen against a
virus-caused blindness related to AIDS and is seeking
clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to broaden
its trials in AIDS-related disorders.

   Charles J. Pedersen, co-winner of the 1987
Nobel Prize in chemistry for his discovery of molecules that enable
scientists to create complex organic compounds, died Thursday
following a lengthy illness. He was 85.
   Pedersen, who lived alone, died around 9:30 a.m. in his Salem
home, said Justin Carisio, a spokesman for Pedersen's former
employer, E.I. Du Pont Nemours and Co. He had suffered from a form
of blood cancer and Parkinson's disease, Carisio said.
   His body was discovered by his housekeeper, Carisio said.
   Pedersen was awarded the Nobel prize in October 1987, sharing
the $360,000 award with California researcher Donald J. Cram and
French scientist Jean-Marie Lehn for their work in the syntheses of
crown ether molecules.
   Pedersen was cited for his pioneering work nearly 25 years
previously in discovering crown ethers, molecules that make it
possible to synthesize numerous complex organic compounds that
imitate the behavior of natural proteins.
   Scientists have said crown ethers could lead to the development
of radioactivity antidotes, new pharmaceutical delivery systems and
extractors of gold and uranium from the sea.
   ``He was a brilliant chemist and an extraordinary gentleman,''
Du Pont Chairman Edgar S. Woolard Jr. said in a statment. ``After
winning the prize, he inspired everyone else with his dignity, his
humility and his personal charm.''
   In an interview after receiving the prize, Pedersen said, ``I
was very excited. That's all I can remember about how I felt.''
   Pedersen was one of the few Nobel winners in the sciences who
had never earned a doctorate or a professorship. His highest
academic degree was a masters from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
   A self-described ``hands-on'' industrial chemist, Pedersen spent
his 42-year career at Du Pont in New Jersey and Delaware, where his
research yielded 65 patents, mostly in petrochemicals.
   Early in his career, he contributed to the development of
Neoprene, the first commercially successful synthetic rubber.
   ``He was a real example of a complete professional, a
well-rounded man who had a wide variety of interests,'' said
Raymond Fitz, president of the University of Dayton. Pedersen was a
1926 graduate of the University of Dayton.
   ``Not only was he a great scientist, but he also loved poetry
and the outdoors,'' Fitz said. ``We're deeply saddened by his
death.''
   Pedersen was born in Korea of a Norwegian father and a Japanese
mother. He moved to the United States when he was 17.
   He began working in the Du Pont laboratories in Deepwater in
1927 and transferred to the company's laboratory in Wilmington,
Del., where he remained until his retirement in 1969.
   Pedersen is survived by two daughters, Shirley Evans of Salem,
N.J., and Barbara Cleaveland of Alexandria, Va.; four
grandchildren; and three great grandchildren.

   NEW YORK -- Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. said it will withdraw
its languishing Enkaid cardiac arrhythmia drug from the
market, citing a growing number of alternative therapies
available and continuing uncertainty about its effects on
heart-attack patients.
   The company's action follows last month's suspension of a
government study of the effects of three drugs for milder
forms of arrhythmia, or irregular heart beat. Enkaid, the
brand name for encainide hydrochloride, and the other two
drugs have been marketed for people with life-threatening
arrhythmias of the ventricle, or lower chamber of the heart.
The study was to test if the drug also could help heart
attack patients who had arrhythmias that weren't
life-threatening.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The National Institutes of Health stopped the study after
results of the last of the three drugs, one made by a joint
venture of Du Pont Co. and Merck &amp; Co., showed patients who
took the drug had a higher death rate from heart attacks than
those who took a placebo. Similar results were obtained in
studies of Enkaid and a second drug, made by a joint venture
of Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co. and Ryker Corp., in
1989.
   The Bristol Laboratories division, based in Evansville,
Ind., said yesterday that the higher death rates among the
tested patients continue to confound medical authorities.
   Bristol Labs said the market withdrawal is effective Dec.
16. It said it would continue to provide the drug free of
charge to eligible patients who were being treated for
life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias as of yesterday.
Patients whose doctors discontinue Enkaid will be offered
reimbursement for the unused part of their medications,
Bristol-Myers said.
   A spokeswoman for Bristol Labs said about 16,000 people
are currently using the medication. She couldn't specify how
many of them are ventricular arrhythmias patients. She said a
clearer number should be available after Dec. 16.
   Enkaid was approved for marketing by the Food and Drug
Administration in late 1986. The spokeswoman said the
withdrawal isn't expected to have a material effect on
Bristol-Myers's earnings.
   A spokesman for Minnesota Mining in Minneapolis said the
company had no plans to withdraw its arrhythmia drug,
Tambocor. Officials of Du Pont Merck Pharmaceutical Co.,
Wilmington, Del., the joint venture, couldn't immediately be
reached for comment on plans for their drug, Ethmozine.

FT  21 APR 93 / Drug groups will work together to find Aids cure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIFTEEN OF the world's largest drugs companies have pledged to work together
in an effort to find a cure for Aids in an unprecedented collaboration.
The effort, which took more than a year to negotiate, involves nearly every
large pharmaceuticals company searching for a treatment against HIV, the
virus that causes Aids, in the US and Europe. The companies' annual sales
total Dollars 55bn (Pounds 36.4bn).
The group includes Wellcome, makers of AZT or Retrovir, the leading drug for
HIV-positive individuals and Aids patients. Earlier this month an important
Anglo-French study claimed that the drug failed to delay the onset of Aids
in asymptomatic HIV-positive patients.
The surprise announcement yesterday said the companies would swap
information, provide their drugs for competitors' clinical trials and
exchange development techniques in an effort to speed up the flow of drugs
to treat HIV-infection.
The groups will only swap information on drugs that are in development being
tested for safety and efficacy. Data about drugs in research, before being
tested on humans, will not be exchanged. No group has a commercial interest
in the collaboration and each group will continue its own clinical trials.
The world pharmaceuticals industry is spending about Dollars 2bn (Pounds
1.3bn) a year to find a treatment for Aids.
'This is an extremely important collaboration,' said Dr Charles Leighton,
senior vice-president for administrative planning at Merck, the US group
that took a leading role in setting up the collaboration.
'The most optimistic route to an Aids therapy in the near term is through a
combination of drugs because the virus is likely to become resistant to
single agents.
'Many of the companies in this collaboration have single agents, but do not
know which combinations to use them in. The hope is that through
collaboration we will achieve more effective treatments more quickly for
this terrible disease,' he said.
He warned that failure rates for drugs in development remained high, but
argued the collaboration was a step in the right direction.
Dr Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo, Europe's largest drugs group,
said: 'I don't see any cut-throat competition in drug development in the
Aids area. No one is going to make much money from Aids but we need to show
that the pharmaceutical industry can produce the goods when it needs to.'
Dr Leighton said it would not have been appropriate to set up collaboration
before, because the drugs did not exist and it was not known how the virus
built up resistance to drugs used on their own. He stressed the initiative
had come from both US and European companies.
The US companies include Merck &amp; Co, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly,
Pfizer, Du Pont Merck and Syntex, as well as Miles and Burroughs Wellcome,
Bayer and Wellcome's respective US subsidiaries. European companies include
Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham of the UK, Roche of Switzerland, Hoechst and
Boehringer Ingelheim of Germany, Astra of Sweden and Sigma-Tau of Italy.

<HL> End of Du Pont Venture Spurs Questions --- Move Clouds Trials Of AIDS Drug Ampligen </HL>

<SO> </SO>
<CO> DD </CO>
<IN> PHA </IN>
<TEXT>
   A controversy is flaring over Du Pont Co.'s mysterious announcement that it is dropping its support of an experimental drug for AIDS. 

   Without explanation, Du Pont announced Aug. 18 that it would pull out of a joint venture with HEM Research Inc. to develop the drug, Ampligen, as a treatment for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
The big chemical maker said that it would continue to supply the drug, which is extremely expensive to make, and that it would financially support studies already in progress, but that it wouldn't back any further studies after the venture is officially dissolved in mid-November. 

   Since then, officials of Du Pont, based in Wilmington, Del., have steadfastly refused to elaborate on the announcement. 
They also have refused to comment on reports that Ampligen is failing to show any significant effect against AIDS or that trials of the drug have been compromised because patients secretly began taking other AIDS therapies. 

   Du Pont's partners at HEM Research -- a small, Philadelphia biotechnology concern that developed Ampligen -- were flabbergasted by Du Pont's decision. 

   "I know of no scientific or business reason for Du Pont to end the joint venture," says Ian Brick, president and chief executive officer of closely held HEM. Mr. Brick says Du Pont's abrupt move prior to the completion of a major clinical study "is bizarre." 
He and several academic researchers studying Ampligen say it continues to show promise as an AIDS drug. 

   "I have got to believe that it was purely a business decision made by Du Pont," says Mathilde Krim, a biologist and founding chairwoman of American Foundation for AIDS Research, a nonprofit group that has pressed for rapid testing of experimental AIDS drugs. 
Ms. Krim, a longtime campaigner for research into Ampligen, complains that Du Pont's failure to explain its action "puts a shadow over the drug it does not deserve. 
I am worried that Du Pont's action will make it very hard for HEM to keep and recruit test subjects or attract future financial backers." 

   Du Pont's tie with HEM wasn't unusual for the drug industry. 
In the race to find an AIDS cure, for example, a number of large companies are establishing presences by bankrolling small outfits in the costly procedure of clinically testing a drug. 

   A look at some of the reasons for Du Pont's pullout, based on a number of interviews, offers a glimpse into the particular complexities involved in developing AIDS treatments. 
Indeed, while AIDS activists and others attack the federal bureaucracy for dragging its feet on AIDS research, the Ampligen affair illustrates that other factors also have hindered the effort. 

   When researchers at Hahnemann University in Philadelphia presented the preliminary results of a pilot study of 25 patients last December, Ampligen had already aroused intense interest. 
The results suggested that the drug stabilized the immune system of patients with AIDS-related complex, or ARC, a condition that often precedes AIDS. 
The patients had an increase in the number of their T-4 cells, key agents in the immune system; a decrease in the amount of AIDS virus in their blood; and no serious side effects from the drug. 

   While Ampligen didn't seem effective in patients who already had developed AIDS, and some AIDS researchers cautioned that even its positive effects in ARC patients involved too small a sample of patients to allow for a proper analysis, the report spurred great excitement. 
Some AIDS activists called on the Food and Drug Administration to allow widespread use of Ampligen, especially because it seemed safe. 

   "I'm not exaggerating when I say that around then, about every other patient I was treating for AIDS asked about Ampligen," says Susan Krown, an AIDS researcher and physician at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. 

   Within weeks of the report's release, Du Pont announced it had formed a joint venture with HEM to fund and oversee clinical trials of the drug, including an important 300-patient test comparing the drug with a placebo in patients with pre-AIDS conditions. 
Earlier in 1987, Du Pont had agreed to acquire a small stake in HEM in exchange for rights to manufacture and market Ampligen. 

   While financial details of the joint venture agreement haven't been released, it was undertsood that Du Pont would produce the Ampligen for the study and provide cash needed to keep the trial going. 

   Weeks before the Aug. 18 announcement, top Du Pont officials are believed to have begun questioning the investment. 
According to several sources, Du Pont had conducted its own analysis of the pilot study at Hahnemann -- which had grown to 40 patients -- and its review produced a less positive picture of the drug's ability to boost the immune system. 
Also, the sources say, Du Pont officials were concerned when they took an interim look at progress of the 300-patient study and saw that many patients had developed AIDS. 

   Moreover, the 300-patient study was being complicated by two factors that haunt all AIDS drug trials. 
In order to get into the study, some patients hid the fact that they had suffered from certain illnesses. 
Those maladies would have tipped off researchers to the fact that the patients were too sick to be in the study. 
Thus, many test subjects were progressing to AIDS much more quickly than expected. 
Also, some patients, worried about their declining health, began taking the AIDS drug AZT. 

   Both situations meant that the study would need to enroll perhaps four times the original number of patients and that it would take much longer to complete than planned, sharply increasing the study's costs. 

   Du Pont's decision to dissolve its Ampligen venture may well have been sealed following a meeting it called in early August in which the test results were presented to a group of AIDS research experts. 
One of the AIDS researchers at the meeting says the data presented was "equivocal." 

   "I didn't see that there was evidence yet that the drug in humans was better than any number of other unproven agents," says Daniel Hoth, head of the National Allergy and Infectious Disease's AIDS drug program. 
He says that he thinks "more research should have been done before they undertook such a large {300-patient} comparative study," but that he was "very surprised by Du Pont's action" to end the venture. 

   Some industry executives believe Du Pont's unwillingness to state its opinion of Ampligen is an effort to avert a lawsuit from HEM. 
But the company's silence is upsetting patients in the drug trials. 
"There is enough uncertainty with AIDS without this going on, too," says one ARC patient who has been in the pilot study for more than a year. 
"If they'd tell me what's going on, I could decide whether I ought to drop out of the Ampligen study and pursue other experimental treatments."

   WILMINGTON, Del. -- Du Pont Co.'s huge fibers division
showed "some improvement in April" sales, but the U.S.
recession is still depressing results in other units, said
Edgar Woolard, chairman and chief executive officer.
   Mr. Woolard said the fibers division, which accounted for
$6 billion of the company's $40 billion in sales last year,
is "sometimes a leading indicator" for the rest of Du Pont.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As for a sales recovery at other divisions, "we don't see
it anywhere else" yet within the company, he said. While he
and other Du Pont executives said they believe the recession
in the U.S. has bottomed out, Mr. Woolard added, "there are
no multiple signs that the recession is over," based on sales
results from Du Pont's different units.
   Theodore Semegran, a securities analyst with Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York, said he recommended Du Pont
stock for purchase earlier this month, partly on the strength
in the fibers division. He said that Du Pont's April
shipments, including exports, of nylon and polyester yarn and
staple to industrial users were 15% to 20% higher than in
March in many cases, although most segments still lagged
year-ago levels.
   Mr. Woolard said it is still too early to project how Du
Pont will fare financially in the current quarter, adding
that it is company policy not to comment on specific earnings
projections. Noting that in the first quarter the company
nearly matched year-earlier earnings per share, reporting 88
cents a share compared with 90 cents a share in 1990's first
quarter, he added, "we don't see a major short fall" this
year compared with last year.
   He said the company's mix of businesses, including
chemicals, fibers, plastics, petroleum, coal and a grab bag
of diversified businesses, plus its strong presence in
Europe, where most economies are stronger than in the U.S.,
"will allow us to have a decent year."
   In March, Du Pont agreed to sell a 50% stake in its
Consolidation Coal Co. subsidiary to the German coal company
Rheinbraun A.G., a unit of RWE A.G. Terms weren't disclosed,
but analysts have estimated the sale price at $1 billion to
$1.25 billion. The sale is expected to be completed by year
end.
   Some Wall Street analysts estimate the company will earn
roughly 80 cents to 90 cents a share for the current quarter,
compared with $1.02 a year ago. Of 18 securities analysts
following the company, the mean earnings estimate for 1991 is
$3.06 a share, and $3.55 a share for 1992, compared with
$3.40 a share last year, according to Zacks Investment
Research. The estimates don't include any anticipated gain
from the sale of the coal interest.
   Mr. Woolard said the company expects the economy to begin
rebounding sometime this year, "but we don't expect a robust
recovery."
   Du Pont's fibers unit incorporates mature, high volume
businesses such as nylon and Dacron polyester, which are
closely linked to the U.S. economy with heavy sales to the
textile and housing markets. Faster growing specialty
products range from Lycra spandex to flame retardant Nomex
and Kevlar, a high strength fiber used in tires, bullet-proof
vests and U.S. Army infantry helmets.
   Another bright spot, albeit a relatively small one in Du
Pont's constellation of multibillion businesses, is its joint
venture in pharmaceuticals with Merck &amp; Co. The joint venture
posts about $700 million in annual sales and will be
"modestly" profitable in its first full year of business, Mr.
Woolard said. Pharmaceuticals had been losing about $50
million a year in recent years when operating as a Du Pont
unit, he said.
   The company decided it needed to link up with drug giant
Merck in pharmaceuticals in order to have the resources and
expertise to be a global player in what is expected to be a
rapidly growing market, he said.
   Mr. Woolard noted that while Du Pont's chemical and
plastics businesses were benefiting from declining raw
material prices during the recession, the prices Du Pont has
been able to charge for its finished products also are coming
down.
   Du Pont's petroleum business, acquired 10 years ago when
the company bought Conoco, is benefiting from continued
strength in refining margins, despite the slowdown in the
U.S. economy, Mr. Woolard said. The petroleum business,
buoyed by the jump in oil prices last year following Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait, accounted for $16 billion out of the
company's $40 billion in 1990 sales, and $1.1 billion out of
$2.3 billion in net income.

   A newly approved drug appears to be the first to
slow Parkinson's disease, seeming to cut the destructive
progression of the incurable brain illness in half, a major study
confirms.
   The research, conducted on 800 people, found that the drug
deprenyl helped people who were not yet sick enough to require
levodopa, the standard medicine for Parkinson's.
   The results are similar to a smaller study, conducted on 54
patients, that was published in August.
   ``It does not stop the disease,'' said Dr. Ira Shoulson. ``But
it may well slow the disease. This may be the first treatment for a
neurodegenerative disorder that actually slows the disease.''
   Until now, levodopa has been the mainstay of Parkinson's
treatment, easing symptoms but not slowing the underlying disease.
Doctors usually reserve this drug until relatively severe symptoms
develop.
   The incurable disease attacks a region of the brain, causing
shuffling gait, difficulty talking and other symptoms. It typically
strikes people in their 50s and 60s and affects about 500,000
Americans.
   The latest study began in 1987 and was scheduled to continue
until late next year. However, researchers stopped the study in
February because of indications of a dramatic effect from the
medicine.
   When the results were analyzed, doctors found the treatment had
reduced the need for levodopa by 57 percent.
   ``Over 12 years, this might buy 50 percent more time of less
impaired disability,'' said Shoulson, who directed the study at the
University of Rochester Medical Center.
   In their report, the researchers wrote that ``the results
translate into a delay in the development of disability of nearly
one year (over the two-year study period) and an extended capacity
for full-time employment.''
   The study was conducted by members of the Parkinson Study Group
at 28 medical centers in the United States and Canada. It was
published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
   In the study, 399 people with early, untreated Parkinson's
disease were given deprenyl, while 401 others received another
experimental medicine or dummy pills. During the followup, 97 of
those who got deprenyl worsened enough to need levodopa, compared
with 176 in the comparison group.
   At the start of the study, people's symptoms included mild
tremors, stiffness and slow movement. By the time they needed
levodopa, they often had to stop working or had trouble caring for
themselves.
   The doctors are not sure how deprenyl works, but they speculated
that it somehow slows the underlying disease process rather than
simply easing symptoms.
   The drug, sold under the brand name Eldepryl, was approved by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for routine use in September.
   The latest study will continue to test the effect of the
medicine when combined with levodopa in people with advanced
Parkinson's disease.
   The earlier study with the drug was conducted by Dr. J. William
Langston of the California Parkinson's Foundation in San Jose and
published in the journal Science.
   In another report Wednesday on Parkinson's disease, University
of California researchers said they have found that implanting
genetically altered skin cells in the brains of rats can reduce
symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The skin cells were genetically
altered to make them produce L-dopa, a chemical that is lacking in
the brains of Parkinson's disease patients.
   The research does not portend a cure for Parkinson's and is not
ready for human testing, but it may offer a possible alternative to
fetal cell implants, which have proved effective against the
disease but which have become mired in political and ethical
controversy, scientists said.
   The results of the study, conducted by Gage and colleagues at
the University of California at San Diego, including Dr. Theodore
Friedmann, a pioneer in the development of genetically modified
cells, were to be published in the latest issue of Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences.

   A new study indicates a drug called deprenyl
delays serious symptoms of Parkinson's disease and allows patients
to work and function twice as long as people not taking it.
   In a study to be published Friday in the journal Science, Dr. J.
William Langston of the California Parkinson's Foundation reported
that patients with early symptoms of Parkinson's who were treated
with deprenyl postponed progression of the neurological disease for
an average of almost eight months.
   ``It seemed to slow the rate (of symptom progression) by about
half and doubled the time before they needed treatment,'' Langston
said in a telephone interview. If the findings are verified by
later studies, he said, ``it suggests that we are tapping into the
basic mechanism'' that causes Parkinson's.
   Parkinson's is a brain disease marked by a progressive loss of
brain cells. The symptoms include palsy, a shuffling gait, a fixed
expression with unblinking eyes and, sometimes, emotional
instability. It affects about one person in 50, and strikes
patients most frequently in their 50s and 60s.
   The cause of the disease, which affects about 500,000 Americans,
is unknown and it is not curable.
   Progression of Parkinson's can be slowed with a drug called
levodopa, or L-dopa, but this drug can have serious side effects
and it loses its effectiveness over time.
   Langston said his study was conducted to determine if deprenyl
could slow the progress of the disease and thus give patients more
time before they were forced to start taking L-dopa.
   The study involved 54 patients, all of whom were evaluated by
tests to be at approximately the same early stage of Parkinson's.
Half of the patients were treated with deprenyl and half with a
placebo, or sugar pill.
   On average, those patients receiving the placebo required L-dopa
therapy within 312 days. But those taking deprenyl did not require
L-dopa for an average of 548 days.
   This means, said Langston, that serious symptoms of the disease
_ as evaluated by five different assessment methods _ were delayed
for more than 33 weeks on average.
   ``Overall, there was about a 50 percent decline in the rate of
progression,'' said the researcher. He said this translates into
maintaining a quality of life that could allow patients to work and
function longer.
   Dr. Erwin Montgomery, a professor of neurology at Washington
University in St. Louis who treats Parkinson's patients, said the
study is ``of very major significance.''
   ``Reducing the onset of symptoms has a tremendous effect,'' he
said. ``This translates into people being employed longer. This can
have a great importance in their lives.''
   The precise effect of deprenyl on brain tissue cannot be
determined without an autopsy, Langston said, but if later studies
show that the drug can actually protect brain cells that usually
die in Parkinson's then the findings may be a step toward finding a
cure.
   ``If we have altered the course of cell death in Parkinson's and
slowed it down, it suggests that we are tapping into the basic
mechanism that is causing those cells to die,'' said Langston.
``That's a very exciting clue of the possible cause.''
   Deprenyl, manufactured by Bolar Pharmaceuticals Co. of Copiague,
N.Y., is approved for use with L-dopa, but Langston said he used
the drug alone as a clinical trail approved by the Food and Drug
Administration. The drug will be sold starting in September under
the brand name Eldepryl.
   Langston's co-author in the study was Dr. James W. Tetrud, also
of the California Parkinson's Foundation. Science, which published
the study, is the journal of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.

   NEW YORK -- Bio-Technology General Corp. said a European
Community regulatory panel recommended approval of its
version of human growth hormone to treat short stature.
   The company expects sales of the product, which is
licensed to SmithKline Beecham PLC in Europe, to begin by the
end of the year, after each of the 12 EC countries decides
whether to grant approval and pricing is negotiated.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bio-Technology will receive 30% of SmithKline's sales of
the genetically engineered product, which will be sold under
the brand name Eskatrope. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Genentech Inc. and
Serono of Italy currently sell their versions of human growth
hormone in some European countries.
   Sim Fass, Bio-Technology president and chief executive
officer, said he expects that in 1993 or 1994, revenue from
sales of the hormone "will be sufficient to make us
profitable." In 1990, the development-stage company had a
loss of $6.2 million, or 40 cents a share, on revenue of $4.3
million.
   In addition, Mr. Fass said, the company, as expected,
completed its reacquisition from Du Pont-Merck
Pharmaceuticals of all rights for Bio-Technology's human
growth hormone in the U.S. Bio-Technology issued 275,000
shares of common valued at about $1 million, or a 1.3% stake
in the company, to the Du Pont-Merck venture and agreed to
pay royalties of as much as $5 million on future product
sales of human growth hormone.
   Bio-Technology General doesn't expect to be able to market
the drug in the U.S. before the end of 1994, when the
protected status held by Eli Lilly expires. Lilly's product
is specifically protected for use in treating short stature.

   SmithKline Beckman Corp. said it signed a preliminary agreement with Du Pont Co. for the chemical and energy concern to help market Tagamet in the U.S. Terms weren't disclosed. 

   SmithKline said the agreement calls for Du Pont's 420-member pharmaceutical sales division to join forces with the pharmaceutical concern's 1,100-member unit to market the highly successful prescription anti-ulcer drug. 

   The joint effort with Du Pont is expected to begin in early 1988. 

   Tagamet contributes substantially to SmithKline's sales and profit. 
In 1986, SmithKline had net income of $521.1 million, or $6.78 a share, on sales of $3.74 billion. 

   Once called the world's best-selling prescription drug, Tagamet recently has been losing market share to Glaxo Holdings PLC's Zantac and Merck &amp; Co.'s Pepcid. 
Furthermore, Tagamet will lose its patent protection in 1994 and could face even more competition. 

   SmithKline, like other pharmaceutical manufacturers, also has been hurt by dwindling drug sales to hospitals since 1984 when the government revamped the Medicare payment system. 

   Recently, SmithKline launched a marketing campaign aimed at chain hospitals that purchase huge volumes of prescription drugs. 
Du Pont has several large supply agreements with hospital chains.

   A drug recently approved for Parkinson's disease
appears to be the first to slow down the crippling disorder and may
be the first effective treatment for a degenerative brain ailment,
a major study today confirms.
   The study conducted on 800 people began in 1987 and was
scheduled to continue until late next year. But because of the
drug's dramatic effect, the researchers ended the study in February
in order to provide the medicine to the patients in the control
group, which received placebos.
   The drug, deprenyl, helped prevent people from becoming sick
enough to require levodopa, the standard medicine for symptoms of
the incurable disease that afflicts about 500,000 Americans.
   ``It does not stop the disease,'' said Dr. Ira Shoulson. ``But
it may well slow the disease. This may be the first treatment for a
neurodegenerative disorder that actually slows the disease.''
   Until now, levodopa had been the main treatment, easing symptoms
but not slowing the disease. Doctors usually refrain from
prescribing levodopa until relatively severe symptoms develop
because it loses its effectiveness after about a year.
   The study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, was
conducted by members of the Parkinson Study Group at 28 medical
centers in the United States and Canada.
   The researchers wrote that ``the results translate into a delay
in the development of disability of nearly one year and an extended
capacity for full-time employment.''
   ``Over 12 years, this might buy 50 percent more time of less
impaired disability,'' said Shoulson, who directed the study at the

   In the research, 399 people with early, untreated Parkinson's
were given deprenyl, while 401 others received another experimental
medicine or dummy pills. During the followup, 97 of those who got
deprenyl worsened enough to need levodopa, compared with 176 in the
comparison group.
   The doctors are not sure how the deprenyl prevented the patients
from reaching their need for levodopa.
   The disease attacks the brain and results in symptoms such as
shuffling gait, shaking and difficulty talking. It typically
strikes people in their 50s and 60s.
   At the start of the study, people's symptoms included mild
tremors, stiffness and slow movement. By the time they needed
levodopa, they often had to stop working or had trouble caring for
themselves.
   Deprenyl, sold under the brand name Eldepryl, was approved by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for routine use in September.
   In a separate study, scientists at the University of California,
San Diego said that genetically modified cells grafted into the
brains of rats had reduced the animal's symptoms of Parkinson's
disease.
   The researchers, whose results were published Wednesday in
Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, said the implanted
cells were genetically altered to produce a chemical lacking in the
brains of Parkinson's patients.
   The research may help provide an alternative to fetal cell
implants, which have proven effective but is embroiled in the
abortion controversy. The Bush administration this month extended a
ban on federal financing of research in which human fetal tissue
from induced abortions is transplanted into human patients.
   The scientists genetically altered the rats' skin cells to make
them produce L-dopa, a chemical that is lacking in the brain of
Parkinson's patients. Levodopa is the synthetic drug used as a
substitute for L-dopa to treat the disease.
   When the genetically altered cells were transplanted into the
rats' brains, an average 40 percent reduction in abnormal behavior
was seen, said UCSD neuroscientist Fred Gage.

FUJI Photo Film of Japan suffered a 10.4 per cent fall in consolidated
pre-tax profits to Y87bn (Dollars 681m) for the half-year to April due to
higher costs and increased competition.
Overall, sales rose 2.7 per cent to Y563.3bn. Operating profits, however,
declined 4.9 per cent to Y84.2bn due to a 6.3 per cent rise in sales costs
and a 19 per cent increase in research and development costs. After-tax
profits fell 16.9 per cent to Y40.2bn.
Fuji's non-operating profits plunged 67.6 per cent to Y2.7bn as a result of
a decline in interest and dividends received.
For the full year to October, Fuji forecast a 13.5 per cent fall in
after-tax profits to Y82bn on a 2 per cent rise in sales to Y1,140bn.
Du Pont Merck Pharmaceutical of the US and Banyu Pharmaceutical of Japan are
to form a new company in Japan to develop and market Du Pont Merck products
there, AP-DJ reports from Wilmington.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Du Pont Merck said: 'Japan represents more than 20 per cent of the world
market for pharmaceuticals. In order to achieve our vision of being a
worldwide, research-based pharmaceutical company, we must participate in the
Japanese market.'

<TEXT>
   J.M. Schneider Inc. of Ontario, Canada, is
voluntarily expanding its recall last week of 22,000 pounds of
frankfurters to include grocery stores nationwide, the Agriculture
Department says.
   Officials said Tuesday the recalled franks are suspected to
being contaminated by Listeria monocytogenes, which can cause
listeriosis, a potentially serious disease.
   In an initial recall on June 22, the company and USDA said the
franks were distributed to stores in unspecified states in the
Northeast.
   ``However, further investigation revealed the franks were
distributed in California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York,
Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, Maryland and Texas,'' the department
said.
   The product, labeled ``Schneider's Franks,'' is sold in
one-pound plastic packages. The words ``Canada 35'' appear inside
the inspection seal on the label. All bearing the ``Best before''
date of ``Jul 03'' are being recalled.
   ``Although no illnesses have been associated with listeria,
several consumer complains are being investigated,'' said Ronald J.
Prucha, associate administrator of the department's Food Safety and
Inspection Service.
   Prucha said consumers should return the suspected franks to the
place of purchase. None of the company's other products are
involved in the recall.
   The problem was said to have been discovered May 31 in a routine
USDA import reinspection in Buffalo, N.Y. Laboratory tests
confirmed the bacterial contamination on June 20.

<HEAD>Unexpected Price Rises Forcing Cuts in WIC Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sharp food price increases and rebate
reductions will force nearly a quarter of a million low-income
pregnant women and children from a federal supplemental nutrition
program, according to a survey.
   ``Between March 1990 and September 1990, the end of the current
fiscal year, our survey found that at least 240,000 participants
would no longer be served by the WIC program,'' Dennis Bach,
president of the National Association of WIC directors, said
Tuesday.
   Bach said at least 25 states already have begun reducing their
monthly participation in the Special Supplemental Food Program for
Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC.
   The program provides needy women and children with vouchers
redeemable at grocery stores for food, including milk, cheese,
juices and cereals.
   Since May 1989 the Consumer Price Index shows that milk prices
have risen 10.7 percent, cheese costs have climbed 12.7 percent and
fruit juices and frozen fruit prices have risen 13.8 percent.
   Congress has appropriated $2.1 billion for the current fiscal
year. Bach said an additional $72 million was needed to prevent the
reductions.
   The House approved a fiscal 1991 increase of $235 million,
including $85 million to maintain current services and $150 million
for program expansion.
   But Bach said the $150 million ``could be eaten up to maintain
current levels.''

<HEAD>Soviet Heart Drug is Licensed by Du Pont</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new treatment for life-threatening heartbeat
irregularities is believed to be the first Soviet drug licensed by
a U.S. pharmaceutical company and approved by the Food and Drug
Administration.
   Officials of Du Pont Co. said the drug, which will be marketed
under the brand name Ethmozine, is the most widely used in the
Soviet Union to treat the heart condition known as ventricular
arrhythmia.
   The drug appears to be safer than the eight others in its class
for patients who have had congestive heart failure, company
officials said.
   Side effects, which include nausea and dizziness, occurred in 10
percent to 15 percent of patients, said Wilmington, Del.-based Du
Pont.
   Ethmozine, also known generically as moricizine, was one of
three drugs studied by the National Institutes of Health in a
clinical trial aimed at assessing the increased risk of sudden
death in people who have an abnormal heart rhythm following a heart
attack.
   The two other drugs, Tambocor and Enkaid, were removed from the
trial and new restrictions on them were ordered by the FDA when
researchers found that patients on the treatments were dying
unexpectedly.
   The trial is continuing with Ethmozine along with placebos.
   About 800,000 to 1.2 million Americans are being treated for
life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia, said Kurt Landgraf,
worldwide director of Du Pont Pharmaceuticals. Arrhythmias are
related to more than 300,000 deaths each year.
   The drug, developed in the Soviet Union in 1964, will be
marketed by Du Pont under an agreement in which the Soviets will
receive royalties of 4 percent on worldwide sales, Landgraf said.
   The drug will be available in the United States in September.

   A drug used to treat heroin overdose may help loosen
alcohol's grip on addicted drinkers, according to preliminary
studies.
   Though tentative, the finding is considered one of the
most promising developments in years in research on alcohol
abuse. The drug, naltrexone, may be the first medicine that
can effectively help recovering alcoholics avoid relapse into
heavy drinking.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If it proves effective in larger studies, the drug could
yield big benefits. Abuse of alcohol in the U.S. dwarfs that
of illegal drugs in terms of deaths, lost productivity and
other costs. One in seven people abuses or becomes dependent
on alcohol at some point in life; the rate among men is much
higher. Some 100,000 deaths annually in the U.S. are
associated with alcohol.
   Naltrexone, sold by Du Pont Merck Pharmaceutical Co., a
50-50 venture formed earlier this year by Du Pont Co. and
Merck &amp; Co., has few side effects and isn't addictive. It
apparently helps drinkers quit by lessening the pleasurable
effects of alcohol, says Joseph Volpicelli, a University of
Pennsylvania researcher and co-author of the first clinical
study of naltrexone and alcoholism.
   Used in conjunction with psychotherapy, the drug seems to
help recovering alcoholics make it over the hump of the first
three to six months after they quit. On average, more than
half of recovering alcoholics relapse during that critical
time. The preliminary studies "indicate naltrexone can cut
relapse rates pretty much in half," he adds.
   Impressed by the studies, the federal National Institute
on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism recently made the drug a top
research priority. "We're cautiously optimistic," says Raye
Litten, who monitors alcoholism treatment studies sponsored
by the federal agency. "If it pans out, it could be put into
use quickly" in treating alcoholism because it's already on
the market. "No other drug has panned out yet in terms of
affecting drinking behavior."
   A spokesman for Du Pont Merck says the company hasn't made
a decision on whether to pursue FDA approval to sell
naltrexone for alcoholism. The only medicine now marketed in
the U.S. specifically for alcoholism, disulfiram, sold under
the name Antabuse, discourages drinking by causing severe
nausea and other unpleasant effects when alcohol is consumed
after a dose of the drug. It's generally considered
ineffective, for studies indicate few alcoholics are willing
to take it regularly. That may not be true of naltrexone,
which works much more gently.
   The optimism about naltrexone stems from two studies,
reported at recent scientific meetings, that showed similar
reductions in relapse rates among recovering alcoholics who
took the drug for 12 weeks. But researchers counsel caution
because the studies involved only a few dozen subjects,
weren't long term and haven't yet been published in
peer-reviewed journals.
   In the University of Pennsylvania study, only one of 14
recovering alcoholics taking naltrexone had a serious
relapse, while 10 of 16 taking a placebo did. Subjects in
both groups occasionally drank during the study. But those on
naltrexone usually stopped after one or two drinks, while
those on the placebo generally lost control and fell back
into heavy drinking, says Dr. Volpicelli.
   The drug didn't prevent those who slipped from losing
motor control and having hangovers when they drank. But it
did seem to lessen the pleasurable high. Typically, "they had
all the bad effects of drinking and none of the good ones,"
he says. "The best advertisement for the drug," Dr.
Volpicelli adds, is that after the study ended, spouses of
some participating alcoholics "called and asked if the
patients could be put back on the drug." They were.
   The second study, at Yale University, involved 33
alcoholics and showed "comparable" reductions in relapse
rates, says Stephanie O'Malley, who led the study. Some
participants said their preferred alcoholic beverage tasted
less pleasant when they were taking naltrexone.
   Both research teams are now conducting larger, longer
studies. The results so far suggest the drug may be an
especially useful aid to alcoholics suffering from mental
disorders such as depression, Dr. Volpicelli says. "It seems
to work synergistically with the right psychotherapy" and
probably wouldn't do much good without the support of
therapy.
   About 8% of patients in the studies dropped out because of
side effects, including nausea and anxiety, associated with
naltrexone. But Dr. Volpicelli says such side effects may
have been due to alcohol withdrawal rather than the drug.
Tailoring naltrexone dosage to individuals, which wasn't
allowed by the study's strict protocol, may lessen side
effects, he adds.
   The studies' results are surprising, for alcohol has
complex, little-understood brain effects that seem to defy
counteracting by another drug. Its molecules move into brain
cells and interfere with their biochemistry at a more basic
level than most psychoactive drugs, which affect signaling
molecules outside the cells. Heroin, for example, is known to
act by sticking to certain signal-receiving molecules on the
surfaces of brain cells; naltrexone sticks to the same
receptors and blocks heroin molecules from activating them.
   During the 1970s, animal studies with "opiate blockers"
like naltrexone gave hints that the drug might help fight
alcoholism. One study, for example, indicated the blockers
lessen alcohol withdrawal in mice. Such studies suggest that
people prone to alcoholism have a slight defect in the brain
signaling system that heroin affects, Dr. Volpicelli says.
   He theorizes that these people have a deficiency of
endorphins, naturally occurring neurochemicals akin to
morphine, and that alcohol somehow alleviates this
deficiency, making such people especially vulnerable to
alcohol craving. Dr. Volpicelli says naltrexone may diminish
the craving by neutralizing alcohol's impact. But he adds
that alcohol probably addicts people with several different
biochemical hooks, so fighting the addiction may require
different medicines for the various "subgroups" of
alcoholics, as defined by what their main chemical hooks are.
   In any case, naltrexone studies support the notion that
alcoholism is a sickness that can be mitigated biochemically,
Dr. Volpicelli says. That helps lessen feelings of guilt and
helplessness that can make it harder to stop drinking.

DRUG IS FOUND TO DELAY PROGRESSION OF PARKINSON'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists have demonstrated for the first time that a drug treatment can delay 
the brain-destroying progression of Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
In a California trial involving 54 patients, the drug, called deprenyl, nearly 
doubled the time that elapsed between the onset of Parkinson's and the need for 
therapy with the most commonly used drug, L-dopa, researchers from the 
California Parkinson's Foundation in San Jose report in today's issue of the 
journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
L-dopa does not slow the normally fatal disease, which usually strikes people 
over the age of 50, but it does alleviate its symptoms, which include disabling 
tremors and rigidity of the limbs and, in at least 30% of the cases, mental 
impairment. 
</P>
<P>
Combined with earlier anecdotal reports suggesting that deprenyl prolongs the 
lives of Parkinson's victims, the research suggests that powerful relief will 
soon be available for Parkinson's victims, who number over 1 million in the 
United States alone. Deprenyl is scheduled to be marketed as a prescription 
drug next month. 
</P>
<P>
But the discovery has implications even beyond that. Two other conditions 
associated with aging, Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(Lou Gehrig's disease), also involve inexorable degeneration of brain cells, 
and physicians have not been able to slow their progression either. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that disease progression has been slowed in Parkinson's "raises the 
hope that you can do it with the others as well," said neurologist J. William 
Langston, the principal investigator of the new study. 
</P>
<P>
The new results are "very important," said neurologist Stanley Fahn of the 
Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, co-chairman of a larger 
study of deprenyl -- called DATATOP -- that is now under way at 28 clinical 
centers throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
Langston's study served as a pilot program for DATATOP. Results from the larger 
study are not expected until late 1990 at the earliest, and Fahn refused to 
comment on them. But rumors circulating in the neurological community suggest 
that those results will support Langston's findings. 
</P>
<P>
And Langston's results could have an immediate impact on treatment of 
Parkinson's in this country. Six weeks ago, the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration approved marketing of deprenyl for use in combination with 
L-dopa for treating patients late in the course of Parkinson's. Somerset 
Pharmaceuticals of Denville, N.J., will begin marketing the drug as Eldepryl in 
mid-September, and once they do, physicians -- as they may with any drug -- 
will be free to prescribe it for any use they see fit. 
</P>
<P>
Fahn noted that it is "inevitable" that large numbers of neurologists will 
"jump on it (deprenyl)" for their patients in the early stages of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Parkinson's disease results from the death of cells in the substantia nigra 
portion of the brain that secrete the neural transmitter dopamine, which plays 
a key role in the control of muscle movement. The disease's cause is unknown, 
but growing numbers of neurologists believe that it is produced by chemicals in 
the environment that poison the dopamine-secreting cells. 
</P>
<P>
As production of dopamine is slowed, the victims lose control of their limbs 
until they eventually become completely disabled. L-dopa is used in therapy 
because it is converted into dopamine in the brain, increasing the brain's 
dopamine supply. But it is effective, on average, for only about six years, 
after which symptoms worsen. 
</P>
<P>
Some researchers have attempted to cure Parkinson's by transplanting 
dopamine-secreting cells from the adrenal glands or from fetuses into the 
brains of victims. But those procedures have been attempted on only about 300 
patients and there is still no consensus on their value. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, deprenyl could be used with virtually every Parkinson's patient. 
</P>
<P>
For their study, Langston and neurologist James W. Tetrud recruited 54 patients 
who had recently been found to have Parkinson's disease. Half were given 
twice-daily doses of deprenyl and half were given a placebo -- a sugar pill 
with no effect. The patients were monitored until either they had been in the 
study for three years or their condition became severe enough to require 
L-dopa. 
</P>
<P>
They found that the average time before L-dopa was required was 312 days in the 
placebo group and 549 days in the deprenyl group. 
</P>
<P>
Langston and Tetrud also rated the patients' neurological condition on five 
separate scales. They found that, based on these scales, disease progression 
was slowed by 40% to 83% per year. 
</P>
<P>
"The clinical observations suggest that the disease is progressing more slowly 
. . . and that's compelling evidence, but it is not proof," Langston said in an 
interview. "To prove it, we would have to demonstrate that nerve cells are 
surviving over time, (a procedure) that is not currently possible in living 
humans." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the study, the patients were taken off deprenyl for a month to 
ensure that the apparent slowdown in disease progression was due to the 
preservation of nerve cells and not simply to relief of symptoms. The drug 
therapy was then restarted and the researchers will continue to monitor the 
patients to determine whether the drug continues its effects for longer 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, deprenyl has been used in Europe for about 15 years to treat 
patients who have begun to develop tolerance for the effects of L-dopa. In one 
key study, pharmacologist Moussa B.H. Youdim of the Technion-Israel Institute 
of Technology found that combined use of L-dopa and deprenyl substantially 
increased the survival of Parkinson's victims. 
</P>
<P>
But that study was viewed with "a great deal of skepticism," according to UCLA 
neurologist Charles H. Markham, because it was an uncontrolled study on an 
unusual group of Parkinson's patients. Langston's results, however, would seem 
to provide strong support for Youdim's conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
The $10-million DATATOP study has a design similar to Langston and Tetrud's but 
involves 800 patients. Some of those patients are also receiving Vitamin E as 
well as deprenyl, however, to determine whether Vitamin E can also slow the 
disease, as animal experiments have suggested. 
</P>
<P>
If the DATATOP results confirm Langston and Tetrud's, Fahn said, researchers 
will almost certainly begin studying the long-term combined effects of L-dopa 
and deprenyl to determine if people will in fact live longer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PARKINSON'S DRUG 
</P>
<P>
Parkinson's disease is caused by the death of cells in the substantia nigra at 
the base of the brain that release a hormone necessary for controlling muscle 
movements. Mounting evidence indicates that metabolites of environmental 
chemicals, such as pesticides, can kill the cells, causing the disease. The 
drug deprenyl delays the progression of Parkinson's by blocking conversion of 
the chemicals into their toxic form.

   Cetus Patents
   Upheld in Fight

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Cetus Corp. won a victory against Du Pont
Co. yesterday when a federal court jury upheld two Cetus
patents covering a process used to amplify and analyze the
genetic code.
   The decision, if upheld, ends more than two years of
David-and-Goliath struggle in favor of the smaller
biotechnology concern, while holding off a giant contender
for the potential profits from the many applications for the
polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, process.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   PCR currently is used in a widening array of applications
from disease diagnostic tests to forensic analyses of
criminal suspects. Scientists employ PCR to probe genes of
organisms as diverse as ancient wooly mammoths and the AIDS
virus.
   "PCR has always belonged to Cetus. It was invented here
and patented here," said Ronald Cape, Cetus's chairman. Cetus
has predicted that PCR-based diagnostic tests for disease
could become a $1 billion business by the end of this decade.
   Du Pont issued a terse statement saying that it is
"disappointed" by the ruling, and that it is reviewing its
legal options.
   Still to be decided by the U.S. District Court in San
Francisco are patent infringement issues as well as
assessment of damages against Du Pont. In addition, the court
soon will schedule a hearing in a separate but related
lawsuit filed by Cetus in December, asking the court to
enjoin Du Pont from sale of PCR-related products.
   Du Pont, Wilmington, Del., sued Emeryville, Calif.-based
Cetus in 1989, alleging that Cetus's 1985 polymerase chain
reaction was anticipated more than a decade earlier by the
work of a scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   The U.S. Office of Patents and Trademarks granted Cetus
the disputed patents in 1987, and re-examined and confirmed
them last year.
   The jury's decision may prove more a scientific
vindication than a financial bonanza for Cetus.
   "Our scientists felt that Du Pont was trying to rewrite
scientific history," said Peter Staple, vice president and
associate general counsel of Cetus. "This has vindicated us."
   Cetus's case turned on its assertion that despite the MIT
scientist's publications in the 1970s, no one was able to
reduce PCR to a practical invention until Cetus's scientists
published their findings in 1985, triggering a tidal wave of
scientific interest.
   "Since then, almost 3,000 publications have cited
{Cetus's} work and scores of applications have been reported
from diagnosis to forensics to archaeology," Mr. Staple
asserted. Most recently, he noted, scientists have debated
using PCR to probe DNA in a hair sample of Abraham Lincoln to
determine whether the former president suffered a genetic
disorder.
   Despite vast potential, the revenue stream flowing from
PCR to Cetus has been relatively modest, and not enough to
reverse the tide of red ink flowing from Cetus's so-far
unsuccessful efforts to launch its cancer drug IL-2.
   Cetus has licensed PCR-based diagnostic tests to
Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., the U.S. unit of Basel-based Roche
Holding Ltd. Thus, Cetus can expect only royalties from such
sales. In the forensics field, Cetus has retained sales
rights, but Bill Gerber, senior vice president and general
manager of Cetus's PCR division, described this as a "nascent
market . . still in its infancy."
   In the field of PCR machines and reagents, Cetus splits
revenue in a joint venture with Perkin-Elmer Co.
   In the six months ended Dec. 31, Cetus posted a loss of
$39.4 million, or $1.25 a share, compared with a year-earlier
loss of $29.1 million, or $1.06 a share.

   WILMINGTON, Del. -- Du Pont Co. said it got approval from
the Food and Drug Administration to sell Ethmozine, a drug to
treat life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms.
   The diversified chemicals company has been developing
Ethmozine since the mid-1970s, when it licensed the drug from
a medical licensing agency of the Soviet Union. Du Pont
expects the drug to be commercially available in the U.S. in
September.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ethmozine, generically called moricizine, was approved for
use in patients with ventricular arrhythmias, a condition in
which the abnormal rhythm occurs in the main pumping sections
of the heart. An estimated 300,000 deaths in the U.S. are
caused by such arrhythmias every year.
   John O'Rourke, the product manager, said that although
Ethmozine has been shown to reduce the incidence of these
arrhythmias, studies are still being done to determine
whether that reduction is directly related to longer
survival. Other factors, such as the pumping capacity of the
heart, make it difficult to trace this cause-and-effect
relationship, he said.
   Some doctors who have worked with Ethmozine say it appears
safer than some other anti-arrhythmia drugs, which themselves
can induce heart problems in certain patients. Last year, for
example, U.S. health officials cautioned doctors against
using two other drugs for mild arrhythmias after more
patients taking them in a government-sponsored study died of
heart attacks than did patients taking a placebo. The
officials said the drugs -- Enkaid, made by Bristol-Myers
Co., and Tambocor, made by the Riker Laboratories Inc. unit
of Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co. -- should be reserved
for patients suffering from life-threatening arrhythmias.
   Mr. O'Rourke estimated U.S. sales of drugs in Ethmozine's
category at $280 million a year.

Longer range, Du Pont said it sees a "significant" market for the mice in sales to pharmaceutical and chemical concerns that want to screen potentially carcinogenic products. 

   Du Pont, based in Wilmington, Del., is a major sponsor of the research that led to the development of the so-called transgenic mouse. 
The company owns exclusive rights to the technology. 
According to the U.S. Patent Office, the mouse is the first genetically altered animal to be sold commercially. 
The only patent for such animals issued by the office is for the Harvard-Du Pont invention, though 30 other applications are currently pending, said a spokesman for the office. 

   Du Pont declined to predict the size of the eventual market for the mice. 
Each animal will sell for less than $50, about the same price as other specially bred mice, a spokesman said. 
Du Pont will take orders for the mice, but they will be produced by a commercial breeder, he said. 

   The advantage of the mice is that they are predisposed to get cancer as a result of the implantation of cancer genes during the embryonic stage of development. 
The mice can be used to test whether small amounts of substances are carcinogenic or whether new cancer treatments are effective. 
Scientists believe they will be helpful in leading to better cancer diagnosis, therapy and prevention. 

   The mice generated considerable controversy earlier this year when they were patented. 
Critics fear broad consequences stemming from abuses of such genetic engineering. 
They are particularly concerned, for example, about current research to develop mice that carry the AIDS virus. 
The fear is that such mice could escape from the laboratories and spread the virus. 

   Du Pont and others, however, have defended the technology as providing an important tool for research. 
Until now, such mice have been available only to researchers who could develop them in their own laboratories. 
The Du Pont mice will be offered first to academic researchers because they have the greatest need for the animals, Du Pont said.

<HEAD>Children's Hospital Revises AIDS Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A foundation that rescinded mandatory
AIDS tests at a children's hospital after they stirred controversy
has decided to leave testing to the discretion of doctors, an
administrator said Wednesday.
   Under a new policy issued by the Jacksonville, Fla.-based
Nemours Foundation, patients at the Alfred I. du Pont Institute
will be tested for the AIDS virus only at the discretion of their
physician and employees will be tested only if they request it.
Testing will be confidential.
   ``As far as the foundation is concerned, I'm glad we've been
able to explain our position a little bit better with this new
policy as opposed to the former one,'' said W. Jeff Wadsworth,
foundation general manager.
   In addition to the Wilmington-based du Pont Institute, the new
policy will affect the Nemours Health Clinic for the elderly in
Wilmington and the Nemours Children's Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla.
   The foundation drew national attention this summer by requiring
AIDS tests before a patient could be admitted to the du Pont
Institute. It would have denied admission to any patient who tested
positive for the human immunodeficiency virus which causes acquired
immune deficiency syndrome.
   The foundation also had called for mandatory annual AIDS tests
for employees and would have required those testing positive to
transfer to non-patient work areas.
   The mandatory testing policy was rescinded in July after
virulent protests from state officials and the medical community.
   The American Hospital Association recommends against screening
patients for AIDS. Institutions that accept federal money are
precluded from such action, according to the association.
   The Nemours Foundation facilities don't accept federal money. It
administers its facilities according to the will of Alfred I. du
Pont, a member of the family that built the giant chemical company.
He died in the 1930s and specified that his fortune be used to help
the elderly and crippled children but not incurables.
   In the past year, one patient at the institute was found to have
been exposed to the AIDS virus and was transferred to another
hospital, the institution said.
   A positive test for the AIDS virus does not mean the person has
the disease.
   Under the new policy, Wadsworth said a physician would have to
comply with a recent Delaware law requiring patients to be notified
before administering an AIDS test.
   The physician also will ``determine the best course of
treatment'' if a patient tests positive for the HIV virus, he added.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SENATE committee claimed yesterday the drug industry had broken its
promise to restrain price increases voluntarily. The Senate ageing committee
cited a report suggesting that eight of the top 31 drug groups had increased
prices at more than three times the inflation rate last year.
The study, whose methodology was challenged by the US Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association, also claimed 19 groups had increased prices at
double the rate of inflation.
Senator David Pryor of Arkansas, a Democrat and the committee's chairman,
said the report showed drug price inflation had been consistently higher
than the general rate of inflation.
He claimed it showed drug companies had failed to fulfil promises that they
would limit price increases. Voluntary price restraints were clearly not
working, he added.
The eight companies mentioned were Merck, Pfizer, Marion Merrell Dow, Du
Pont Merck and Sterling-Winthrop of the US, as well as the American arms of
Glaxo and ICI of the UK and Hoffman-La Roche of Switzerland.
Mr Pryor said a drug costing Dollars 1 in the US would cost 67 cents in
Canada and 60 cents in Europe.
The report claimed Glaxo's US arm had increased prices by 4.4 per cent
during 1992. This was contested by the company which said its overall
increase for the year to June 30 had been 1.8 per cent, well below the 3 per
cent general inflation rate.
Glaxo said the study had failed to consider the issues of volume and
discounts. It was important to look at the units sold of each drug as well
as list prices.
Du Pont Merck claimed its increases had been less than 2.9 per cent on a
weighted average basis. Merck said it had increased prices by 3.1 per cent
and by 2.9 per cent if rebates and discounts were included. That compared
with the report's alleged increase of 5.5 per cent.
Pfizer claimed its increases last year were less than 2 per cent, while ICI
said its drugs price inflation had been 3.6 per cent on a volume-weighted
basis and 2.1 per cent after deducting rebates.
Price gouging by pharmaceutical companies has been a favourite theme of Mr
Pryor's since he took over as chairman of the Senate special committee on
ageing in 1988.
President Bill Clinton's campaign manifesto promises to eliminate tax breaks
for pharmaceutical companies that raise prices more quickly than personal
incomes, and to discourage them from spending more on marketing than on
research and development.
It is unclear, however, how these pledges will be integrated in the overall
reform of the US health-care system.

<HL> Patent for Genetically Altered Mouse Opens Era for Research, Spurs Protests </HL>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Patent Office granted a patent for a genetically engineered mouse, ushering in an era in which private concerns can profit from and control such artificially developed animals. 

   The patent was issued yesterday to Harvard University, but the exclusive rights to the technology belong to Wilmington, Del.-based Du Pont Co., which was a major sponsor of the research. 

   Patent Commissioner Donald Quigg said the agency now is considering granting 21 other patents on genetically altered animals. 

   The Harvard scientists developed a technique to add cancer genes to mice embryo, creating mice that are especially susceptible to cancer. 
These mice then can be used more readily to test whether small amounts of substances are carcinogenic and whether new cancer treatments are effective. 
In current testing, laboratory animals must be given massive doses of potential carcinogens to replicate the effect of such substances over years. 
"This may well be the first step toward genetic engineering that will let the medical community fight against disease," said Mr. Quigg. 

   The decision brought a wave of protest from groups who fear the broader consequences of such developments. 
"The whole biological kingdom is being turned on its head," said Jack Doyle, an official at the Environmental Policy Institute, a Washington-based environmental group. 

   Biotechnology proponents, however, assert that the new techniques merely speed up what animal breeders have been doing for centuries. 
"Think of the Chihuahua as descended from the wolf, which shows we have been doing the best we can" to create new animals, said Robert Benson, a Chicago lawyer specializing in biotechnology patents. 
"Now we just have better technology than before." 

   The mice covered by the Harvard patent were developed by geneticist Philip Leder and by a former colleague, Timothy A. Stewart, now at Genentech Inc., to help investigate cancer. 
The mice contain certain genetic material that induces breast cancer. 
"The mice can serve as a good model for testing (anti-cancer) therapies and diagnostic procedures," Mr. Leder said. 

   In Wilmington, Del., a spokesman for Du Pont said the company "is making the mice available to researchers in other laboratories for a nominal fee." 
He added that the company has no immediate plans "to build a business around the mice," but will "make arrangements on a case-by-case basis with commercial laboratories planning to use the mice." 

   The Harvard patent "is a logical extension of patent law rather than a legal breakthrough," said Lisa Raines, director of government relations for the Industrial Biotechnology Association, a trade group. 
In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that micro-organisms could be patented, and in 1985, the patent office ruled that plants could be patented. 

   Last year, the patent office ruled that animals, excluding humans, could be patented. 
Mr. Quigg reiterated yesterday that the agency will not patent human beings. 

   However, two bills have been introduced in Congress to place a moratorium on the granting of animal patents. 
Debate about the patenting of animals has intensified in the past few years as scientists have improved ways of creating so-called transgenic animals, in which genes from other animals or species have been inserted. 
Last year, researchers with the National Institutes of Health and Integrated Genetics Inc., a Framingham, Mass.-based concern, announced that they had genetically altered mice to make the animals secrete in their milk a human drug used in treating heart attacks. 
Other researchers are investigating ways to genetically engineer better farm animals, such as leaner, disease-resistant cattle.

   GENEVA -- A common thread runs through European designer
Karl Lagerfeld's fall fashions: Lycra. He uses the elastic
fiber in everything from flowing formals to body-hugging
sportswear. "Europeans are mad about Lycra," says U.S.
designer Norma Kamali.
   That's great news for Du Pont Co., the fiber's inventor.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Lycra symbolizes what Du Pont is striving to become in
Europe in the 1990s: flexible, high-tech -- and very
profitable. With Lycra leading the way, the Wilmington, Del.,
chemical producer is applying its technological savvy --
gained by spending $1.4 billion a year on research -- to
European markets where it can command top dollar for its
products.
   The strategy means emphasizing products with a clear
technological edge while scaling back on commodity-type
chemicals, even when it means closing whole operations.
   So far, the approach has helped the company succeed in a
market where some major rivals and other big U.S. companies
are floundering. Du Pont's European division, including the
Conoco petroleum operations, is expected to contribute more
than 40%, or about $1.1 billion, of Du Pont's estimated $2.55
billion in operating profit this year. That's nearly twice
the European operation's contribution to operating profit
just four years ago. Du Pont's European sales during the same
period have surged more than 50%, even though a stronger
dollar recently and weak European economies have slowed
growth somewhat.
   Europe holds a growing allure for multinational companies.
When most European Community trade barriers fall by the end
of next year, the largest single market in the industrialized
world will be up for grabs. Without a significant European
operation, corporations risk being global also-rans by the
turn of the century.
   "We've done well so far, but we have to have a much
stronger presence in Europe to be a great global company,"
says David Williamson, Du Pont Europe president.
   The company operates a network of 45 European plants and
has begun an ambitious expansion program. In northern Spain,
a $200 million factory to make flame-retardant Nomex fibers
is under construction, part of a planned $1 billion expansion
project in that country. Near Dunkirk, France, an
agricultural chemicals plant is being built.
   Besides Lycra and Nomex, other products Du Pont is pushing
include extra-strong Kevlar synthetic fibers used for
bullet-proofing, Arylon polymers for auto interiors, and
chemicals used to purify water and make paint pigments. In
addition, fewer of Du Pont's low-margin commodity chemicals
that have been a recent drag on U.S. earnings are being made
in Europe. During the past decade, Dupont has closed or
trimmed production of such basic products as Orlon synthetic
fiber and certain commodity chemicals in Europe.
   The economies of scale that Du Pont wrings from its
factory network helps it keep costs low and profit margins
high. Its facilities and marketing strategies also serve all
of Europe, not just France, Germany or Britain. Many other
U.S. corporate giants, including leading auto and computer
companies, are still revamping country-by-country production
and distribution channels in preparation for a unified
European market.
   What Du Pont has done with Lycra offers a glimpse of its
European strategy. The elastic fiber has grown from a modest
start 30 years ago as a rubber substitute in women's girdles
to become the company's largest product world-wide. While Du
Pont doesn't break out financial results by product, industry
analysts estimate that worldwide operating income from Lycra
this year will reach $250 million, or 10% of the company's
total estimated operating income, on sales of $900 million.
   Indeed, Du Pont's fibers division, where Lycra sales
account for most of the profits, was the sole bright spot in
the company's third-quarter earnings. While Du Pont's net
income and sales were each down 5% for the quarter, after-tax
operating profit from fibers more than doubled to $150
million from $72 million a year earlier.
   To capitalize on Europe's fashion trendsetting position,
all Lycra production and sales are managed from Du Pont's
European headquarters here. Du Pont has successfully promoted
the fiber for a variety of applications beyond the lucrative
activewear market that boomed during the fitness craze of the
1980s.
   Ms. Kamali, the New York designer, lately has been
incorporating the fiber into a host of materials, including
cotton T-shirts and what she calls "stretch velvet." Designer
Donna Karan mixes Lycra with wool in men's jackets.
   The fiber also is used extensively in women's hosiery. And
Du Pont scientists hit the jackpot a few years ago when they
developed a version of Lycra used instead of rubber along the
edges of disposable diapers. One-in-four disposable diapers
now use Lycra.
   Since the original Lycra patent lapsed long ago,
look-alike spandex fibers are being marketed by several
European and Asian competitors, such as Imperial Chemical
Industries PLC of Britain. But they aren't making much of a
dent in sales of Lycra, which command a 60%-plus share of the
world market.
   Another product giving Du Pont an edge in Europe is a
hollow polyester fiber called Quallofil, used in mattresses
and bedding material. A fire-retardant version gained
popularity after a number of fatal hotel fires in Britain a
few years ago forced Parliament to adopt legislation
mandating fire-resistant mattresses.
   Du Pont's European researchers also have developed a
firmer version of polyester fiberballs, called Comforel, that
mimic the feel of goose down. French furniture maker Pierre
Roset is using the material to stuff cushions in his fall
line of furniture.
   Du Pont's European operations haven't been error-free. Two
years ago the company paid more than $600 million for two
British photo printing companies and so far has little to
show for its investment. Analysts claim the company erred in
purchasing businesses not tied closely to its core operations
and in underestimating the time and money required to turn
the operations around. In the third quarter, the imaging
companies cost Du Pont an additional $16 million in
restructuring charges.
   Du Pont also has had trouble converting promising research
in drugs into commercial products in the U.S. and Europe. To
compensate for a lack of marketing muscle in drugs, the
company in January formed a joint venture with giant Merck &amp;
Co. to produce and market drugs. The venture is expected to
be only modestly profitable this year.
   Du Pont's success with Lycra, though, should help it buy
time to remedy its strategic shortcomings. "Lycra," asserts
designer Calvin Klein, "isn't in or out of fashion, it's a
way of life."

<HEAD>FDA OKs Blood Test Kits for Virus Linked With Rare Leukemia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday
approved three tests for a blood-borne virus linked to a rare form
of leukemia and recommended that blood banks begin screening for it.
   The development has been expected for some time and blood banks
have started preliminary planning to test for HTLV-I, short for
human T-lymphotropic virus type I.
   The disease, called adult T-cell lymphoma, may appear in a small
number of people 20 years to 40 years after they become infected
with the virus, the FDA said.
   A Red Cross study has suggested that about two of every 10,000
blood donors carry the virus. However, scientists believe only about
1 percent of those infected develop the disease.
   By contrast, HIV _ the virus that causes AIDS _ acts much more
quickly, sometimes leading to full-stage disease in two or three
years. Moreover, researchers increasingly are concerned that a very
high percentage of those infected with the virus, perhaps nearly
all, eventually will devlop AIDS.
   All donated blood is already tested for AIDS and several other
diseases, including two types of hepatitis.
   In addition to the rare leukemia, HTLV-I also is associated with
an even more rare degenerative neurologic disease called tropical
spastic paraparesis.
   ``Based on current data we know that HTLV-I is rare in the United
States, but to be on the safe side, FDA has recommended blood
screening,'' FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young said. ``If blood tests
positive, it will not be entered into the blood supply.''
   Although the FDA technically is only recommending screening for
HTLV-I for the time being, that recommendation has great weight
since the agency has the regulatory authority to require such
testing if blood banks do not act on their own.
   The Red Cross already has announced it will begin screening blood
donations for HTLV-I when the test kits became available for
widespread use.
   John Horrell, a spokesman for the 8,000-member American
Association of Blood Banks, said Tuesday his group is awaiting
expected guidelines from the FDA on recommended testing procedures.
   While the association has not taken a formal position, it already
has distributed tentative guidelines to its members, and, Horrell
said, ``My sense is there will be testing.''
   He said it was difficult to predict how soon testing will be
instituted nationwide.
   Three groups licensed to produce test kits are E.I. du Pont de
Nemours &amp; Co. of Wilmington, Del., in collaboration with Biotech
Research Laboratories of Rockville, Md.; Abbott Laboratories of
North Chicago, Ill.; and Cellular Products of Buffalo, N.Y.
   Ken Koziak, a spokesman for Du Pont, said the company ``will be
shipping product tomorrow'' and that the three companies licensed to
market the test can easily meet demand.
   However, it is likely to be a month or so before test kids will
reach every blood bank in the nation.
   The new test is expected to be a little more expensive than the
main AIDS screening test, which averages about $1.50 per kit.

   Upjohn Co. and Du Pont Co. researchers
will join forces to try to develop a better soybean and improved
soybean products, the companies said.
   Increased food value, higher yields and disease resistance are
goals of the arrangement involving Upjohn's Asgrow Seed Co.
subsidiary and Du Pont Agricultural Products.
   ``This strong partnership provides exciting potential for the use
of biotechnology skills to bring benefits to consumers ...,'' said
John Krol, group vice president of Du Pont Agricultural Products.
``We at Du Pont are committed to developing biotechnology-based
businesses.''
   The agreement announced Tuesday could bring improvements in a
range of items from soybean seeds to soybean food products and
animal feed, the companies said.
   Soybeans are used in cooking oils and other foods as well as
high-protein livestock feed.
   The agreement won't result in formation of a new venture by
Upjohn and Du Pont, but the two will work together on soybean
research and development, Upjohn spokesman Joe Heywood said.
   ``Both companies have strong biotechnology staffs. We also have a
long history in the soybean business,'' Heywood said.
   Financial arrangements involved in the agreement weren't being
disclosed, Heywood said.
   Du Pont, based in Wilmington, Del., is a diversified chemical,
energy and special products company. Du Pont had sales of $32
billion in 1988. It is a leading supplier of crop protection
chemicals worldwide.
   Kalamazoo-based Upjohn, engaging in worldwide research,
manufacturing and marketing of human and animal health products, had
sales of $2.75 billion last year. Its Asgrow Seed Co. is a leading
supplier of high quality seed.
