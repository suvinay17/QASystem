   ``Finished this day and I hope it's good,'' John
Steinbeck wrote in his journal in 1938.
   The book he had just completed was ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' a
novel that would awaken the social conscience of Americans in a way
that ``Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' ``The Jungle'' and few other works f
fiction have.
   Viking Press, which published ``The Grapes of Wrath'' on April
14, 1939, is marking the 50th anniversary of the book with a
commemorative edition containing an introduction by Studs Terkel.
It is also publishing ``Working Days,'' journals Steinbeck kept
during the research and writing of what critics consider his
greatest work.
   When he sat down to write his saga of the Joads, a Dust Bowl
family migrating to California for a new life, Steinbeck, 36, had
already attained celebrity with ``Tortilla Flat,'' ``Of Mice and
Men'' (which had been made into a long-running Broadway play) and
four other novels.
   He wrote what he called his ``big book'' in a five-month
marathon, scribbling a prodigious 2,000 words a day. Steinbeck
scholar Robert DeMott, who edited the journals for publication,
notes that the manuscripts strikingly show little revision.
   But the author had already laid much groundwork, having studied
the migrant farmers from Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and Arkansas _
derisively dubbed ``Okies'' _ for a series of articles that
appeared in The San Francisco News. He had bought an old bakery
truck and equipped it with blankets, food and camping equipment and
spent time in a migrant resettling camp. (Contrary to popular myth,
he never made the trek from Oklahoma to California, as did his
fictional Joads.)
   Steinbeck had also written a 70,000-word precursor to ``The
Grapes of Wrath'' that he destroyed, saying the novel was too
vicious and ``smart-alec,'' too much of a political tract. But it
rid him of some of the venom he felt against the Associated Farmers
Inc. and others he felt responsible for the workers' plight, and
allowed him to write what he thought was a more rounded novel.
   Indeed, the question most frequently debated about ``The Grapes
of Wrath,'' which won a Pulitzer Prize, is whether it is art or
firebrand propaganda.

   ``Sure, cried the tenant farmers, but it's our land. We were
born on it, and got killed on it, and we died on it. Even if it's
no good, it's still ours. That's what makes it ours. ... That makes
ownership, not a paper with numbers on it.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Immediately after its release, newspaper editorials, legislators
and farmers decried the novel as a distorted portrait of migrant
life. The book was burned in several cities, including Salinas,
Calif., Steinbeck's hometown, and was banned in many libraries and
schools.
   Eleanor Roosevelt defended the book in her weekly column, and in
1940 a congressional committee held hearings in Oklahoma to find
out whether the squalid conditions and brutal treatment of the
workers recounted in the novel were accurate. The committee's
findings vindicated the author.
   Upon Steinbeck's death in 1968, The New York Times wrote the
following about the book: ``The timorous and savagely reactionary
among us were fretfully afraid that Steinbeck had gone too far in
his novel's portrayal of the desperately distressed in America.
Bless their hearts, they were dead right. He was out to rouse, not
to soothe us into asking human beings to starve quietly and
inconspiculously during those years of Depression and despair.''
   Terkel said he finds modern-day critics who call ``The Grapes of
Wrath'' propaganda ``pretty tiresome.''
   ``You can can say `Moby Dick' is propaganda,'' the author and
radio raconteur said in a telephone interview from his Chicago
office.
   Terkel, who toured the Midwest in 1987 when family farms were
foreclosing one after another, and who witnessed the drought of
1988 played out on the six o'clock news, finds Steinbeck's words
startlingly relevant today.
   ``It's as though we never experienced the Depression and hadn't
learned anything from it,'' said Terkel, who planned to mark the
anniversary by reading from the novel on his radio show,
interspersed with selections from ``Dustbowl Ballads'' by Woody
Guthrie.
   It should be noted that while critics hashed out the literary
merits of the book, the public snapped it up in droves. It was the
best-selling book of 1939 and one of the top 10 best-sellers in
1940. It also prduced a successful movie adaptation starring Henry
Fonda that won director John Ford an Academy Award.
   ``The Grapes of Wrath'' remains one of Viking's all-time
best-sellers today and has sold some 14 million copies worldwide,
said Viking spokesman Paul Slovak.

   In awarding Steinbeck the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962,
the Swedish Academy cited the ``towering standard'' the author set
in ``The Grapes of Wrath'' more than two decades earlier, although
he had produced more than a dozen novels and plays since that work.
   DeMott, founder of The Steinbeck Quarterly and an English
professor at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, says in the preface
of ``Working Days'' that Steinbeck's legacy was ``his willingness
to risk everything to write the best he could with what what gifts
he had, and in doing so to reveal, unblinking, the enduring human
spirit among the ruthless shapes of paradise.''

<LEADPARA>  OF ALL the familiar American novels that might be turned into Broadway plays,
perhaps "The Grapes of Wrath," John Steinbeck's classic saga of the Dust Bowl
migrants, was the least likely.;    How would they convey the stark emptiness
of the wind-swept Oklahoma landscape, the grim squalor of the California
migrant camps, the endless rows of lettuce in the farmlands of Salinas?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Moreover, how could they match the dark magnificence of director John
Ford's 1940 film version, still playing in repertory cinemas, on local TV
stations and available for rental in video stores all over the United States?;
   Yet, in 1990, the Steppenwolf Theater Company not only brought "The Grapes
of Wrath" to the Broadway stage for 199 performances, but also won the acclaim
of critics and the Tony award as the year's best play.;    This week PBS's
"American Playhouse" brings that much-honored stage production, featuring the
original Broadway cast, to television for us to compare against our memories
of the Pulitzer prize-winning book and Oscar-laden movie.;    It can be seen
Friday night at 9 on Ch. 9 and March 27 at 11 p.m.;    The 2 1/2-hour TV
presentation was videotaped during a performance at the Cort Theatre. The TV
audience will have the advantage of close-ups and transitional techniques
possible on tape.;    Those familiar with the 1940 film, for which Ford
received an Academy Award, will notice certain differences right away. Most
profound among them: a different ending.;    True to the novel;  The Ford film
veered away from Steinbeck's novel at the finale and eliminated the symbolic
scene in which Rose-of-Sharon delivers a stillborn child in a barn, then
suckles a starving black man. This was not something movie censors were
anxious to depict at a time when breasts always remained covered on the screen
and any contact between a black man and white woman would have cost the studio
all its Southern bookings.;    Instead, screenwriter Nunnally Johnson ended
the film with Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) speaking lines from earlier in the book,
her famous "We're the people -- we go on" speech.;    For his 1990 adaptation,
though, playwright Frank Galati went back to Steinbeck's 1939 novel, ending
the play with the birth sequence, which he felt made the symbolic link with
Steinbeck's theme about all of us being part of a whole, sharing
responsibility for the survival of the deprived.;    Viewers also will notice
the play only suggests the vistas cinematographer Gregg Toland gave moviegoers
in the film, relying instead on the power of Steinbeck's characters and their
words to transport us to the Depression era and recreate the plight of the
"Okies" who came west in search of prosperity.;    Characters rearranged; 
Though the film more clearly emphasized the character of young Tom Joad,
played by a lean Henry Fonda in an Oscar-nominated performance, Galati's play
restores the original balance between Steinbeck's people, bringing some into
the foreground, moving others back a step or two.;    Gary Sinise, a
co-founder of the Steppenwolf drama group, plays Tom Joad. Sinise has appeared
in a number of other TV productions, including "True West" on "American
Playhouse" and ABC's "My Name Is Bill W." with James Woods.;    Ma Joad is
played by Lois Smith, whose film credits include the current "Green Card" as
well as "Black Widow," "Five Easy Pieces" and another Steinbeck story, "East
of Eden." Like Jane Darwell, who won the supporting-actress Oscar for the
movie, Smith was widely acclaimed for her performance, earning a Tony
nomination.;    Terry Kinney, another co-founder of Steppenwolf, plays Jim
Casy, the part played by John Carradine in the film. He also earned a Tony
nomination for the play. (box)  </TEXT>

   John Steinbeck always turned down requests to
adapt for the stage ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' his epic novel about
Dust Bowl Okies and their migration to the Promised Land of
California.
   He loved the film version, starring Henry Fonda, which was
written by Nunnally Johnson and directed by John Ford, all three of
them his good friends. But he didn't want to see the story as a
play.
   ``I think John wondered if it would be visual in a theater,''
says Elaine Steinbeck, the writer's third wife and most ardent fan.
After he died in 1968, she continued to reject proposals for a
play, except for a local production at Actors Theater of Louisville
in the early 1980s.
   ``But the minute Steppenwolf asked me, I said `yes,''' adds
Steinbeck's widow, referring to the Chicago theater company that
has made a name for itself all over the world with its highly
kinetic, freewheeling productions.
   ``I knew their reputation and had seen `Orphans' in London and
`Balm in Gilead' in New York. They were professional, imaginative,
exciting and had sent their actors, directors and plays out into
the theatrical mainstream.
   ``I also knew that the 50th anniversary of the publication of
`The Grapes of Wrath' was going to come up last April _ the book
was first published in April 1939 _ and I felt, `Wouldn't that be a
wonderful time for somebody to do the play?'''
   The Steppenwolf version, adapted and directed by Frank Galati,
opened in Chicago in September 1988 and was done later in La Jolla,
Calif., and at the Royal National Theater in London. Now, it has
made the trek to Broadway, where it has found a house at the Cort
Theater.
   The book, the story of the Joad family and their journey
westward during the Great Depression, is known everywhere. In the
United States alone, in every one of those 50 years from 1939 to
1989, it has never sold fewer than 100,000 copies. It has been
published in 40 languages.
   ``Whenever anybody would say, `What's your favorite novel?' John
would say: `The one I've just finished.' But I think he had taste
enough to know that `The Grapes of Wrath' was his big book,'' says
Mrs. Steinbeck in a soft, Texas twang not erased by her more than
50 years in New York.
   Mrs. Steinbeck, one of Broadway's first female stage managers,
worked on such shows as the original ``Oklahoma!'' and ``Othello''
with Paul Robeson. She first met her future husband in 1949 when he
was collaborating with Elia Kazan on the movie ``Viva Zapata!'' and
doing research for a novel that eventually became ``East of Eden.''
   ``He was recently divorced, and told me, `I'm very disillusioned
and very unhappy.' He had two young boys and his wife divorced him.
And he said, `I don't want to ever love another woman or ever write
another book.' Well, look what happened.''
   The couple was married in 1950. They kept homes in New York and
in Sag Harbor on Long Island but traveled a lot _ particularly to
London and Italy. They made up for the time he was too poor to
travel.
   ``I once asked him, `When F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest
Hemingway and all those other writers were going to Paris, why
didn't you go?' He said: `I didn't have the price of a ticket. But
I'm glad I didn't because I stayed home and wrote about my own
people.'''
   Fans of the film version of ``The Grapes of Wrath'' will find a
different emphasis in the play, one that is much truer to the book,
Mrs. Steinbeck says.
   ``The movie was a star vehicle for Henry Fonda, who played Tom
Joad. It really ends when Tom leaves,'' she says.
   ``In the book, the central figure all the way through is Ma
Joad. They all leave her for one reason or another. Even Tom. And
she says: `We are the people. We must prevail. We must go on.' I
feel that's what Frank Galati was going for in the play.
   ``John didn't write many women's parts. As a matter of fact,
critics used to say, `Steinbeck writes better men than women.' He
would always look at me and say, `How about Ma Joad?'''
   During their years together, Steinbeck would write every day in
longhand, usually after sharpening three-dozen pencils, his widow
recalls. ``That was stalling,'' she says. If he was working on a
long book, Steinbeck would keep regular hours. But he would start
the morning writing letters.
   ``John always said writing letters was like a pitcher warming
up. He would write letters before he would write his work. Or when
we traveled, he wrote travel pieces. Just things that interested
him, not things that would live forever. He kept a journal for
every book.''
   When she first met him, one of the first things they did was to
drive to Salinas, Calif., where he was born, to see the little room
on the top floor of the house where he first started writing. ``I
can't remember a time when I didn't write,'' he told her as he
showed her the building.
   Steinbeck did a lot of research on ``The Grapes of Wrath.'' He
wrote a series of pieces called ``The Harvest Gypsies'' for a
now-defunct San Francisco newspaper and then realized it was a
book, not newspaper articles.
   ``He loved to think of himself as a journalist,'' Mrs. Steinbeck
says. ``I don't think he was accurate enough to be a journalist. He
always embroidered a bit. He'd always throw a little bit extra in.''
   ``When John won the Nobel Prize, he said, `I don't know whether
I deserve it or not, but I certainly am glad I got it,''' she
recalls.
   ``I don't think that John ever got fancy. When he became
successful, he didn't start writing a different kind of story. He
still wrote about the people he knew. John cared about the people.
He talked the same way to great French writers at the Academy
Francaise as he did to the fishermen at Sag Harbor. He never talked
down to anybody.''

<TEXT>
   Nearly 50 years after the Joad family made that
memorable trek from dry and dusty Oklahoma to the fertile farmlands
of California, ``The Grapes of Wrath'' has made a new journey from
page to stage.
   It's not the first theater adaptation of the Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel by John Steinbeck, but the Steppenwolf Theater
Company production at the Royal-George Theater, which closes Oct.
30, is certainly the most expensive. The $500,000 project also has
the enthusiastic support of Elaine Steinbeck, the author's widow.
   The play stars two of the Steppenwolf troupe's biggest names,
Gary Sinise and Terry Kinney, as well as guest artist Lois Smith as
the indomitable Ma Joad.
   AT&amp;T picked up part of the tab for the three-hour production
which has a cast of 41, including four musicians who play an
original score by Michael Smith. They perform on a spare,
wooden-plank setting designed by Kevin Rigdon, who also did the
costumes and lighting. The rough-hewn set covers the floor and back
wall of the large stage.
   But the man most responsible for the play, as well as its
direction, is Frank Galati, a Chicago jack of all-theatrical trades
who acts, writes, directs and teaches. The 44-year-old Galati first
read ``The Grapes of Wrath'' in high school.
   ``It affected me in a number of ways that I've only begun to
understand in the last couple of years,'' he said. ``It turned me
in the direction of literature, and my whole academic life as a
student and as a teacher has been involved in the study of
fiction.''
   Galati began adapting novels for the stage as a teacher at
Northwestern University, where he directed a summer program that
took students through the process.
   One novel he wanted to adapt was ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' but he
couldn't get the rights. The idea lay dormant until Sinise, at the
time Steppenwolf's artistic director, invited Galati to submit
suggestions for possible productions.
   ``I thought `The Grapes of Wrath' would offer wonderful
opportunities for an ensemble of exceptional actors,'' Galati said.
Sinise, who had had some success with a production of Steinbeck's
``Of Mice and Men'' a few years earlier, agreed.
   The Steinbeck estate, after extended negotiations, granted
permission. By January of this year, Galati had done two drafts and
began a third version after Randall Arney, Steppenwolf's artistic
director and Stephen Eich, its managing director, decided to open
the company's fall season with the work.
   How does one boil down a sprawling novel of 30 chapters and
nearly 600 pages? Galati started with a careful rereading.
   ``I needed to see the flow of the book,'' he said,
``particularly, those incidents and episodes and characters that
come to the surface as tent poles, a kind of spine on which the
rest of the action hangs.''
   The novel, Galati says, is kind of an American ballad, and poses
particular problems for a dramatist.
   ``On stage you're stuck with having to get a truck full of 13
people from Oklahoma to California by moving it a few feet,'' he
said. ``That compression, and telescoping and distortion of time
and space is a very significant problem.
   ``The book has an A-B, A-B form of alternating chapters that go
from the general to the specific. Steinbeck does a kind of
landscape painting. Voice by voice, you get the sense of the great
numbers of characters who are part of the epoch he was reflecting _
the migrant workers, the land bosses, the contractors, the labor
organizers, the businessmen. You also get a panorama of the Dust
Bowl _ Highway 66 from Oklahoma to California.''
   These broad scenes alternate with the stories of the Joad
family, their immediate concerns and the characters they meet.
   ``Steinbeck had a remarkable way, and very experimental for its
time, of letting scenes take their own natural time,'' Galati said.
``People in the novel don't come to conclusions quickly. There are
some cataclysmic scenes and events, of course, but very often
dialogue and rhetoric move at a leisurely pace which I was
interested in retaining without sacrificing the need for urgency in
the drama.''
   Galati needed to find a framework to dramatize the more general
chapters. He found his answer in music.
   ``I contacted Smith, a wonderful Chicago composer and folk
singer, and gave him sections of the novel that I had condensed
into lyrics and asked him to set those lyrics to music which he did
over the course of the summer,'' Galati says.
   Have their efforts paid off?
   The major Chicago reviews were divided about the show's merits.
In the Chicago Sun-Times, Hedy Weiss called the production
``breathtaking and emotionally wrenching ... it would be an
unpardonable sin if it did not receive an extended life, both in
this country and abroad.'' Although the Chicago Tribune's Richard
Christiansen described the play as ``reverent'' and ``ambitious,''
he said ``admiration for its effort must give way to disappointment
in its results.''
   Galati feels ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' both as a novel and a
stage play, holds a particular relevance for people in 1988.
   ``There is this uncanny coincidence of the summer drought
devastating American agriculture,'' he says. ``And there's the
theme of literally sacrificing the land, abusing and destroying the
environment for the sake of capital gains. And we've still got
migrant workers as the lowest rung of the social and economic
ladder. Those themes remain as resonant today as they were in
1939.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Many of the stories of the late John Steinbeck
have become the plot lines for movies, but sometimes the author's
artistry has been lost in the translation. Now his sons and some of
their friends have formed a movie company to try to faithfully
adapt their father's works to feature films.

   A realist in the video age, writer Thom
Steinbeck believes that film offers him the best opportunity to
carry on in his famous father's footsteps.
   The son of the late John Steinbeck, one of America's best-known
writers, is one of the founders of a new movie company dedicated to
faithfully adapating the works of famous authors, starting with
Steinbeck.
   Sitting in the secluded Catskill Mountain studio of artist
Eugene Gregan, his film company partner, Thom Steinbeck explains
his plans for Steinbeck Films Inc.
   ``Our concern is with craftsmanship. Steinbeck spent a lot of
time on his work,'' says Thom, who frequently refers to his father
by the family name. ``We're going to spend as much time on his work
as he did.''
   With dark, combed-back hair, ruddy complexion and piercing blue
eyes, the 43-year-old Thom resembles the prize-winning author who
wrote ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' ``East of Eden'' and other classics
of American literature.
   Following years of struggle to make a living as an author, John
Steinbeck gained national attention in the early 1930s as a writer
who could masterfully depict the plight of the disenfranchised and
downtrodden. He produced 19 works of fiction, eight of non-fiction
and also plays, a documentary and a screenplay.
   His 1939 book ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' about the hopeless
migration of Dust Bowl farmers, won a Pulitzer Prize. It also was
one of the many Steinbeck stories adapted for film.
   In 1962, six years before his death at age 66, Steinbeck was
awarded the Nobel Prize for literature.
   Steinbeck's two sons, Thom and John IV, are writers themselves
and now partners in the film venture.
   ``We chose Steinbeck to work with first because there've been
very few accurate interpretations of his work that have been
translated into film,'' Thom says. ``In many cases, companies have
chosen pieces that are far too long for a 125-page script, which is
usually standard.''
   The results, Thom says, have been films which cut the writing of
his father and others to fit the filmmaking ``formula.''
   ``On Broadway, the author owns the stage. In Hollywood, he's
lucky if he can get invited to a couple of parties,'' says Thom,
who recently completed the screenplay of his father's novel, ``In
Dubious Battle'' for a Los Angeles film company, Zupnick
Enterprises Inc.
   It's not that the senior Steinbeck minded seeing his writing
adapted for film.
   ``Steinbeck is not like a lot of authors,'' Gregan says,
``because he thought visually and wrote visually. Some writers are
totally verbal. Steinbeck is easy to intepret to film because he
saw it that way. He loved movies. All his best friends were
involved in movies.''
   Thom says his father knew and influenced the writers who adapted
his stories for film while he was alive. ``It's the films that have
taken place since his death that I think he would roll over in his
grave about,'' he says.
   The company plans to make full-length feature films based on
``Travels With Charley in Search of America,'' Steinbeck's last
book, and ``The Moon Is Down,'' a story about Nazi occupation of a
Norwegian town in World War II.
   Short stories from ``The Long Valley'' and ``The Pastures of
Heaven'' are also slated for production, with ``The Long Valley''
scheduled for release in about a year.
   ``We want to stay very close to the novel,'' Gregan says, ``so
that eventually what people can have is a videotape library of John
Steinbeck's work.''
   If translating books to film is so difficult, then why not leave
Steinbeck's efforts in their purest form?
   ``Because people don't read any more,'' Thom says with a laugh.
``And the only way I can start them to read is by doing accurate
interpretations of Steinbeck's work so that they might be enticed
to read it.''
   Some of Steinbeck's work that is already on film shouldn't be
duplicated, Thom says.
   ``Who could play Tom Joad better than Fonda?'' Thom said of
actor Henry Fonda who starred in ``The Grapes of Wrath.''
   For the last 2{ years, the Steinbeck brothers and Gregan have
talked of starting a film company. Thom spent last summer and fall
in a cabin near Gregan's mountain home and the wheels began to turn.
   Three other partners, whom Thom didn't want to identify, are
also involved.
   The firm will have offices in New York City and Monterey,
Calif., where Thom makes his home and where his father lived off
and on.
   Viking Penquin Inc. has continued to print Steinbeck books in
hardbound and paperback editions. The largest printings since 1986
have been 280,000 paperback copies of ``The Grapes of Wrath'' and
119,500 of ``East of Eden.''
   Professor Ted Hayashi, president of the International Steinbeck
Society at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., believes there is
an ample market worldwide for the films.
   ``Whenever somebody makes a film out of Steinbeck literature, I
want to see it,'' Hayashi says, though he concedes that some people
have been disappointed in the past when Steinbeck stories were
adapted for film.
   ```Cannery Row'' independently was a very enjoyable movie, but
if you're serious about comparing movies and literary work, a lot
of scholars were disappointed,'' Hayashi says. ``Film is a very
independent art after all.''
   The logo of the film company is a haunting sketch of the elder
Steinbeck, done by Gregan. But what would Thom say in response to
critics who might accuse him of trying to profit off of his
father's name?
   ``I make money off my father's name right now,'' he said in a
blunt, matter-of-fact tone. ``My name is Steinbeck. I also share in
the literary estate with my brother and stepmother.
   ``It's a little bit like inheriting a grocery store. You've got
one of two choices: letting the fruit rot on the shelves and not
pay attention to it or you can see it as an ongoing business.
Certainly a literary estate is an ongoing business.''

FT  30 APR 94 / Arts: Drama from bestsellers - Andrew St George has mixed
feelings about two current adaptations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First Dickens and George Eliot, now John Steinbeck and Fyodor Dostoyevsky
are rushing to the stage. All are strong writers with a definite view and a
fixed viewpoint; this makes them easy to film but hard to stage. Now in
London there are two examples of adaptation: The Grapes of Wrath at the Shaw
Theatre and Crime &amp; Punishment at the Battersea Arts Centre.
John Steinbeck (1902-68) was not above a little punishment. He once dangled
a recalcitrant girlfriend by her ankles out of a top floor window. The
writing, like the life, was direct and uncompromising. His best, The Grapes
of Wrath (1939) scooped the Pulitzer Prize and the John Ford film treatment.
Given that Steinbeck's American epic splashes the primary colours of
American literature over a canvas 2,000 miles long, the 7:84 Theatre
Company's production at the Shaw Theatre does well to render the story
without losing its sprawling quality. This is the ultimate road book,
following the Joad family west on Route 66 from the prairies of Oklahoma to
the fruit valleys of California. En route, the family faces death, hunger,
unemployment and humiliation. Some travellers break off, others stick with
it; there are funerals, floods and famine. The large Shaw stage is
throughout filled with the hopeful family, but clears for the closing scene
of a childless woman breast-feeding a starving man.
The adaptation scores with the set, like the inside of an orange crate, the
light seeping through from the back, and an understage stream (for the
excellent flood scene); the Joads' car is a sensible trolley with headlights
and a radiator, and all the other scenery is light and shadow. The acting -
particularly Paul R. Meade as Tom Joad and Tom McGovern as the ex-Reverend
Casy - keeps the action tense; there is a fine performance from Anne Kidd as
the matriarch of the Joad family, the strong reliant woman found everywhere
in Steinbeck's fiction.
For all its qualities, this staged Grapes of Wrath has little of the book's
power or the film's scope. The production misses Steinbeck's unremitting
outrage at the careless economic forces pushing the Joad family further from
itself; and it misses the beauties of Steinbeck's visceral prose. There is a
narrator and a group of musicians who speed the action along, but they
rarely step over the divide between literature and theatre.
Iain Reekie's direction finds Steinbeck's strengths: the moral shoot-out,
the loss of self-belief, the search for friendship; but they are too loudly
treated. The play lacks quiet, powerful moments. 'Most people', wrote
Steinbeck in his unpublished 1933 Journal, 'do not like themselves at all,
do not even know themselves well enough to form a true liking.'
Enter Dostoyevsky (1821-81) and his self-tormenting hero Raskolnikov at the
Battersea Arts Centre. This production, by Red Shift, amounts to the
hi-volume cartoon version of the 1856 Russian classic. It works by selecting
rather than including, so swathes of the novel are rightly unrepresented,
but at the expense of Dostoyevsky's impact. This is the play of the
detective novel inside Crime &amp; Punishment.
Jonathan Holloway's adaptation is subtitled The Killer's Story; it lasts 135
minutes and keeps the action to four characters: Raskolnikov, Razumikhin his
friend, Sonya his lover and Porfiry his nemesis. Gone are the Marmeladovs,
but purists will be happy to know the scene where Marmeladov is crushed to
death finds a place. Other parts are played in latex masks, and the action
concentrates on the duel between Porfiry and Raskolnikov: 'a murder is
incomplete without detection, a murderer incomplete without punishment.'
The finest scene is a dream sequence of Raskolnikov murdering the old woman
and her sister, darting into the flat, stealing her pearls, avoiding
detection. The scene plays backwards and then forwards to nervy and nagging
music. The cast (particularly Tristan Sharps as Porfiry and Philip Brook as
Raskolnikov) deliver with point and verve, and Holloway's direction keeps
the action scooting around with walls and doors on plinths.
But this touring show has none of the quiet, daily horror of Crime &amp;
Punishment; it lacks the calm concentration essential to the story. Red
Shift has produced a good introduction to its fine brand of innovative
theatre, but not to Dostoyevsky.
The Grapes of Wrath: Shaw Theatre (071 388 1394) until 30 April; Crime &amp;
Punishment: Battersea Arts Centre (071 223 2223) until 14 May. Both then go
on tour.

   Driving in from O'Hare for the world premiere of the Steppenwolf Theatre Company's dramatization of "The Grapes of Wrath," I passed a wall-sized graffito advising Chicago's wretched that "IT IS RIGHT TO REBEL." 
The sign struck me as an apt summary of John Steinbeck's ardent chronicle of the Okie migration to California during the Dust Bowl years, and I arrived at the Royal-George Theatre ready for a rousing polemic on behalf of the dispossessed, an American-style "Les Miserables." 

   The parallels are hard to miss: two huge novels, based in historical fact, about the social cost of institutionalized callousness, turned into sprawling stage shows. 
"Les Miz," of course, is a musical, and "The Grapes of Wrath" is not (although it does have frequent musical interruptions). 
And "Les Miz" is by no means a flawless piece of work. 
But by the end of it, you are genuinely stirred by the suffering and courage of the poor people of Paris, and, by extension, of the poor people the world over fighting for a better life. 
At the end of "The Grapes of Wrath," you feel cheated. 
You sense that you're meant to be moved by the tribulations of the Joad family, and also by the thought of today's Okies, today's Hoovervilles, inescapable in any American city. 

   You know there's been a barrage of words and stage pictures intended to jolt you into emotion -- 11 scenes, 68 speaking parts, a square dance, a fit, a shooting, a birth, and more deaths than you can shake a stick at. 
You can see the designers and technicians have gone to tremendous trouble to give you a moving truck, several live campfires burning in trap doors, an honest-to-God "river" flowing in a downstage pit, and even a California rainstorm. 
The only thing you haven't had is the one thing theater can't do without: drama. 

   In a sense, Steppenwolf was asking for trouble simply by deciding to adapt this work. 
The fact that it had already been successfully turned into a movie (by John Ford in 1940) says nothing about its suitability for the stage. 
Moreover, the film was made in Hollywood, with Hollywood's usual disdain for its source material. 
Looking at Frank Galati's adaptation, you can almost hear him and his fellow Steppenwolves vowing to correct Hollywood's corny misrepresentation of the book, to be true to Steinbeck's harsh vision. 
But, as it happens, Steinbeck's novel is almost a textbook case of the kind of book that shouldn't be put on stage as is. 
There may well be a play, or several plays, in it somewhere. 
But trying to stage the whole novel seems almost perverse. 

   To begin with, "The Grapes of Wrath" is a story almost from first to last about nature in the raw, outdoors: about the dust storms that destroy the Joad family farm; about the sun beating down on their rickety home-made truck as they set out for Golden California; about the swelling fruit in the green orchards; about the downpours that signal the end of the harvest and the onset of pneumonia and starvation for the pickers. 

   Although Kevin Rigdon's set occasionally lets in the outdoors in the form of a starry sky, it is essentially an arrangement of planks, and the fires and rainfall do nothing to mitigate the feeling you get of the great indoors. 
Oklahoma looks just like Arizona looks just like California. 
The farm looks like the highway looks like the campsite looks like the orchard. 

   If the geography of "The Grapes of Wrath" challenges the resources of the theater, the book's characters are equally recalcitrant. 
In the pages of Steinbeck, the Joads are flat archetypes whose most notable characteristic is their ability to endure and endure and endure. 
Endurance is not theatrical. 
Neither is the kind of generic family that Steinbeck favors in so many of his books: Pa's in charge, Ma cooks and drops pearls of wisdom now and again, Tom and Al drive, Rose or Sharon waits for her baby to arrive. 
Even worse in terms of theatricality, they all are victims -- of the bank that threw them off the land, of the deceptive handbills that lured them west, of the exploitative locals along the route, of the slave wages and company stores in the fields. 

   When it becomes clear even to the stoical Ma and Pa that everything's been botched beyond repair, Pa asks, "Couldn't we of did nothin'?" 
And Ma replies, "No. 
There was only one thing to do ever, and we done it." 
She's quite right, but people who have no choices don't make good stage heroes. 
We can't pull for them, we can't cry for them, we can only watch as they glumly go about doing what a man has to do. 

   In the film, the Joads and their companions were turned into a warm, earthy bunch by some of Hollywood's most appealing character actors. 
The Steppenwolf adaptation, by contrast, works hard to keep Steinbeck's laconic tone intact. 
As Tom Joad, Gary Sinise is stiff and pokerfaced. 
Lois Smith (Ma Joad) veers between the same tight-lipped toughness and something a little softer, a little, well, maternal. 
She positively beams when Mr. Sinise takes her for a turn on the dance floor at one of the camps, although she barely manages a smile when he comes home from jail. 
She injects real feeling into a few of her speeches, and you can't help wondering if those aren't the ones that Mr. Galati, who also directed the piece, isn't happy with. 

   As Jim Casy, the preacher who converts to collectivism, Terry Kinney is only slightly more animated than his colleagues. 
It's hard to picture him ever getting up the energy to bring down the Holy Spirit, much less organize a strike. 
And if he has trouble conveying a dynamic character, pity the poor actors who must make do with roles like "Man," "Scowling Man," "Old Man," "Young Man," "Ragged Man" and "Man in Overalls," in the brief exchanges with strangers that mark the Joads' westward progress. 

   Sensing, perhaps, that these picaresque events needed some tying together, Mr. Galati has interwoven some of Steinbeck's meditations and descriptions into a kind of running narration spoken by Tom Irwin and Cheryl Lynn Bruce. 
It's sad that these turn out to be the liveliest moments in this truly lugubrious piece of theater. 
It's especially distressing to see Messrs. 
Kinney and Sinise so wan. 
As two of the original Steppenwolves, they helped create the energetic style for which the company is best known. 
And they have given some vibrant performances in previous Steppenwolf productions. 

   Here, they are simply swamped. 
You'd almost think that the impetus for this piece was the urge to mount something epic rather than to say something epic. 
In sticking so closely to Steinbeck, Steppenwolf has transformed the book's passion into doggedness, its mythic style into vapid blandness. 
No one walking out of this production of "The Grapes of Wrath" will be inspired to scribble radical exhortations on a wall, or to give a second thought to the migrants who stooped over the lettuce fields picking their evening salad. 
So, despite its slavish fidelity to the book, this play is in fact the ultimate betrayal of Steinbeck.

   It would seem an impossible task: to adapt for
the stage ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' John Steinbeck's monumental
story of 1930s Dust Bowl farmers and their journey from Oklahoma to
the Promised Land of California.
   Not only does the play have to compete with the powerful prose
of Steinbeck's best novel but with the images of the John Ford film
version that starred Henry Fonda as Tom Joad.
   Yet the play, which opened Thursday at Broadway's Cort Theater,
can stand tall beside the book and the movie. It's an extraordinary
piece of theater, a stirring ensemble production by Chicago's
Steppenwolf Theater Company that rises to and meets the challenge
of Steinbeck's epic tale.
   The hero of the evening is director and adapter Frank Galati who
has fashioned a remarkably coherent version of the Steinbeck story.
True, some of the narrative has disappeared in order to keep the
audience from sitting in the theater all night, but Galati has
remained faithful to the mythic spirit of the novel.
   The essentials are there. The Joad family anchors the play,
particularly the stoic Ma Joad, played by Lois Smith as sort of a
Midwest Mother Courage. She gives a beautiful, heartbreaking
performance. Watch her as she sees Tom for the first time since he
got out of prison or near the end of the play, when he must flee
for his life.
   There are other wonderful portraits in the large, 35-member cast
including Gary Sinise's shrewd, hot-headed Tom; Robert Breuler as
the fatalistic Pa; Jim True as Tom's lusty brother Al; and Sally
Murphy as the life-giving Rose of Sharon. In the play's other major
role, Terry Kinney is fine as the grizzled, cynical preacher turned
labor organizer, a man who may have deserted his church but not his
flock.
   Steinbeck's novel has a relentless rhythm as the Okies push
their way West. Galati and crew have captured that drive perfectly.
What gives the play so much atmosphere is the physical production
the director receives from his design team, especially Kevin Rigdon
who did the evocative sets and lighting.
   The story is played out on a set of weathered wooden planks. But
the setting is not as simple as it initially seems. Various trap
doors are used for campfires. At one point, a trough near the rim
of the stage becomes the Colorado River and during the memorable
scene in a railroad boxcar when Rose of Sharon gives birth to her
stillborn baby, rain pours from near the proscenium arch.
   Then there is the Joad jalopy, loaded down with passengers and
possessions. The old pickup maneuvers around the stage as easily as
if it really were driving along Route 66, the road the Joads took
to California. Their journey westward is accompanied by music
composed and played by Michael Smith and a small band of musicians.
   There is a wondrous moment at the end of Act 1 when the Joads
reach California. A golden glow floods the stage, and the migrants
stand there, transfixed. But unlike the movie, which sinks into a
gooey sentimentality about the nobility of the downtrodden, the
stage version quickly shows the reality of what the Joads found in
their new home. They have traded one form of servitude for another.
   Galati is unstinting in his depiction of the desperation of
these Depression-era homeless. The parallels to the present day are
striking. It's almost uncomfortable to watch their hardships. But
more importantly, it's impossible to forget.

   What other critics said:
   Frank Rich, The New York Times: The production at the Cort, an
epic achievement for the director, Frank Galati, and the Chicago
theater ensemble at his disposal, makes Steinbeck live for a new
generation not by updating his book but by digging into its
timeless heart.
   Howard Kissel, the Daily News: There is something heartening
about seeing such a large, deeply committed company engaged in
serious work, but what they achieve is something far below
Steinbeck's galvanizing vision.
   Clive Barnes, the New York Post: This is, overall, a thrilling
theatrical achievement that gets its power from the still sharp
relevance of its human message ... and its entertainment quality
from the performance by an ensemble you should walk miles to see.

JOHN STEINBECK: A BIOGRAPHY
by Jay Parini
Heinemann, Pounds 20, 614 pages
Is it still true, as I suppose, that most people love reading John Steinbeck
in their teens, yet only rarely return to him in their maturity? Was his
friend John Hersey right when, explaining Steinbeck's astronomical sales, he
said, 'Readers loved him. Even people who really did read books read
Steinbeck'? Has persistent denigration by academic critics denied him his
proper reputation notwithstanding his Nobel Prize?
The virtue of this long but readable book is that Jay Parini, by achieving
an excellent balance between biography and literary appreciation - always a
difficult task - makes a strong case for the quality of Steinbeck's work in
the course of a well-told life story.
He establishes the structure with confident authority: the family homes in
Salinas and Monterey; the unsatisfactory parents who nevertheless supported
their son while he mastered his trade; the failure at Stanford; the early
experience on the road, as labourer, rancher, sailor, solitary; the three
wives, the alcohol and the depressions; the unfailing conviction of his
vocation as writer; and then the breakthrough to worldwide success with
Tortilla Flat, followed by Of Mice and Men and, in 1939,The Grapes of Wrath.
Parini then moves deeper. He understands that the fame of The Grapes of
Wrath - one of the great 'angry books', the instant classic which describes
so unforgettably the plight of the Okies fleeing from the Dust Bowl - can
mislead us about Steinbeck's true gifts. The 1930s may have been the period
when the American novel went political but Steinbeck, an instinctive New
Deal Democrat rather than a radical sophisticate, always knew that realism
was, in his words, 'a dead end for the novel'.
His own ambitions lay more in the myth-making function of the artist. He had
a life-long obsession with the Arthurian legend (which is clear in Tortilla
Flat and Cannery Row) and, arising out of his scientific bent, he held
well-developed theories about the relationship between the individual and
the larger social unit which he called the 'phalanx'.
'Man is a double thing,' he once wrote, 'a group animal and at the same time
an individual. And it occurs to me that he cannot successfully be the second
until he has fulfilled the first.' That is rather a good way of
understanding The Grapes of Wrath.
As Parini points out, this philosophy is not so far from Jung's Collective
Unconscious, and it is particularly interesting to find that one of
Steinbeck's close friends in pre-war Monterey was Joseph Campbell, later to
become America's most influential mythologist. (This California group of
'whores, scientists, bums, winos and local artists' included Steinbeck's
best friend, the marine biologist Ed Ricketts, George Albee and John Cage,
as well as Campbell, who had an affair with Carol Steinbeck which may have
contributed to the eventual divorce.)
Out of all this detail, Parini focuses on his argument: 'Like Joyce and
Eliot and any number of other writers, Steinbeck used myth to organise his
ideas and ground his work in archetypal patterns. The important point is
that Steinbeck summoned a reality that was fresh and highly particularised,
always trying to examine 'the group' and its effects on the individual.'
There is a lovely line from Steinbeck's diary as he was writing Grapes -
'Carol says, stay with the detail'.
After earning a mere Dollars 870 in his first seven years, Steinbeck took
off. The critics soon decided that he had peaked already, but the public
disagreed. There were to be films and plays and travel books and journalism,
as well as more novels.
Parini takes us smoothly through the fame and the fortune, the years as war
correspondent, the move to New York, the bad second marriage and failure as
a father, divorce and more drink and crisis, a happy third marriage, East of
Eden and the screenplay of Viva Zapata].
Steinbeck wrote a book a year between 1931 and 1950 and was only defeated by
his attempt on his beloved Malory, for which he moved to Glastonbury.
These later years are told at a fast lick, but it would be churlish to
complain. The argument of the book is not simply that Steinbeck is unfairly
under-esteemed but that it is wrong of the critics to declare that his work
declined after the famous bestsellers.
Does Parini make his case?
I suspect that he protests too much. But in order to be sure, I'll have to
go back to the books - which is a good test of a good biography.

<P>
For theaters in the 1980s, making poverty look real is a pricey proposition. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Steppenwolf Theatre Company unveils its newly revised version of 
"The Grapes of Wrath" at La Jolla Playhouse on Sunday, nearly $1 million will 
have been spent translating John Steinbeck's 50-year-old Pulitzer-Prize winning 
novel about migrant farm workers to the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Half of that was spent by Steppenwolf in its original 41-character Chicago 
production; the Playhouse ponied up $450,000 for Steppenwolf's revised (read 
"pared-down") version, making the now 35-character show the most expensive in 
the life of both companies. 
</P>
<P>
And more will be spent when "The Grapes of Wrath" leaves La Jolla on June 17 to 
open at the National Theatre in London a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes have certainly risen since Steppenwolf founders Gary Sinise, Jeff 
Perry and Terry Kinney, and their fellow high school and college students, 
jump-started the company 13 years ago in the basement of a Catholic elementary 
school in Highland Park, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Still, while much has changed for the troupe in the years since the trio had to 
scramble to find $300 to put on a show, much abides. 
</P>
<P>
What Sinise, Perry and Kinney wanted to create in that 88-seat basement was a 
family of actors who made group decisions about their choice of work and 
directors. Never mind that the acting ensemble in the early years often 
outnumbered the audience and that one of the main contentions backstage was 
whether they thought it was worth it to go on. ("We always did," Kinney said. 
"What else were we going to do?") 
</P>
<P>
The company's goal was to build a safe haven for performers in a world that 
provides no shortage of discouragement for unknowns. 
</P>
<P>
Their loyalty to each other in darker days continues to pay off with a variety 
of rewards, including a Tony Award in 1985. And some members of Steppenwolf 
have gone on to greater fame: John Malkovich ("Dangerous Liaisons"), John 
Mahoney ("Say Anything") and Joan Allen (now starring on Broadway in "The Heidi 
Chronicles"). 
</P>
<P>
It was the reputation of Sinise and Malkovich's work in the Steppenwolf 
production of Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men" that won the company the permission 
of Steinbeck's widow, Elaine, to adapt the book for the stage. 
</P>
<P>
During a rehearsal break, Sinise, Perry and Kinney, who act in the play as Tom 
Joad, Noah Joad and Jim Casy, marveled at their artistic journey, which, in its 
way, resembles the remarkable journey of the Joads themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The choice of a play about farmers who look for work in California after losing 
their Oklahoma land was in tune with the spirit of the company, they all agree. 
</P>
<P>
"The theme of the book is about 'I' becoming 'we,' " Kinney said. "It's 
something that moved us because it's about people who are disenfranchised. 
We've always felt communion with the underdog because we were that in what we 
did. 
</P>
<P>
"No one can relate to people who live in the street like actors. We are 
gypsies, itinerants, on the move. We really felt we could shed light on the 
project because of that." 
</P>
<P>
For the adapter, Frank Galati, who received an Academy Award nomination last 
year for the adaptation of "The Accidental Tourist" that he wrote with director 
Lawrence Kasdan, it is also a dream project, the first that came to mind when 
Sinise asked him what work he would most like to do with the ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than being intimidated by the 1940 movie, "Grapes of Wrath," which he 
said he admires, Galati was inspired to bring to the play what Hollywood could 
not more than 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the Joad daughter, Rose of Sharon, giving birth to a healthy baby as 
she does in the movie, Rose of Sharon's baby will be stillborn, as in the book. 
And, as in the book, playgoers will see Rose using her mother's milk to feed a 
starving man -- a scene not included in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
That scene lies at the heart of Steinbeck's message, that a man may not have a 
soul of his own, but instead may be part of one big soul. 
</P>
<P>
This message is reflected in Steppenwolf's commitment to elevate the work of 
the whole over that of the individuals. It's a commitment that gets 
increasingly tested since the early days when necessity was part of the glue 
that kept them together. 
</P>
<P>
"In the early days we would say half-jokingly that we stayed together because 
we were scared to audition," Perry said. "It was rare, it is rare, it shall 
always be rare for people to agree that what they can create together is 
greater than what they can create alone." 
</P>
<P>
Now that Perry, Sinise and Kinney are popping up as actors and directors on 
shows like "thirtysomething" and "Columbo," they have distanced themselves from 
the group's day-to-day decisions. In the last few years, they have moved from 
Chicago, home of Steppenwolf's 211-seat house. Perry and Sinise keep in contact 
by phone from Los Angeles and Kinney from New York, as plans are being made for 
a new 525-seat proscenium house that is scheduled to open in the fall of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
They all say they will remain part of the ensemble, even if the Hollywood doors 
open wider. 
</P>
<P>
"From a certain perspective they don't really need the company; from another 
perspective they desperately need it," said Galati, who keeps busy as a 
screenwriter, a professor at Northwestern University and associate artistic 
director of Chicago's Goodman Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"It meets an emotional and a spiritual need to work with this group of actors," 
he added. "There isn't a single person who isn't blessed by being in the 
company. Including myself. 
</P>
<P>
"The theater is such a torment. It's full of so many losses. Failure is such a 
part of the integral process; it is always just around the corner. In the face 
of that, this company offers the kind of bonding that settles in after many 
years of work and play. It's the kind of tensile strength that flows in the 
Joad family. It keeps us together even while we are flying apart."

<HEAD>Chicago Theater Company Well-Received In London</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater Company received
mostly warm reviews from London critics Friday following the
European debut of its stage version of John Steinbeck's ``The Grapes
of Wrath.''
   Jack Tinker in The Daily Mail called the play, adapted from
Steinbeck's Depression-era, Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, ``as
shatteringly a perfect piece of American theater as you are likely
to experience in a lifetime of trans-Atlantic travel.''
   Claire Armitstead in The Financial Times found the show ``a
magnificent ensemble piece ... richly and simply evocative.''
   London is the third stop for the play, which bowed in Chicago
last September, before moving last month to the La Jolla Playhouse
in California. The hope is for it to go to Broadway in the upcoming
season if financing can be found for a New York production with a
cast of 35.
   The 12-performance London engagement at the National's midsized
Lyttelton Auditorium was 70 percent sold before it opened. It is
expected to sell out the remainder of the run, through July 1, on
the strength of the reviews.
   It is the second Steppenwolf show to be seen in London, following
the 1986 run of Lyle Kessler's ``Orphans,'' with British actor
Albert Finney.
   The three-hour play is more faithful to the book than was John
Ford's 1940 movie starring Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell as Tom and
Ma Joad, who lead a community of itinerants westward across the dust
bowl to California.
   Adapted and directed by Frank Galati, an Oscar nominee this year
for co-writing ``The Accidental Tourist,'' the play stars Gary
Sinise as Tom and Lois Smith as his mother.
   Jeremy Kingston in The Times of London praised Sinise as
``intense and sinewy.'' While he pointed to ``a faltering in the
second half,'' he said ``for the most part Galati's dramatization is
convincingly theatrical.''
   Milton Shulman in The Standard said: ``The cast, in spite of
characters that are often too sentimental and too one-dimensional
for credibility, provide ensemble acting of almost balletic
precision.''
   Maureen Paton in The Daily Express sounded a notable note of
dissent, writing: ``The cast are about as moving as Mount Rushmore.''
   ``It is no wonder Dustin Hoffman was desperate to join a British
theater company if this is typical of what the American stage has to
offer,'' she said, referring to the Oscar-winning actor's local
appearance, amid a British cast, in Shakespeare's ``The Merchant of
Venice.''
   The actors coped well with complex technical demands and the
occasional hitch, which included a fire alarm that rang for five
minutes during the performance.
   Americans arrived in force to cheer on Steppenwolf at the
opening, filling about 160 of the Lyttelton's 900 seats.
   ``The Grapes of Wrath'' is the second production in the
National's International '89 series, which continues in September
with the Moscow Art Theater performing Anton Chekhov's ``Uncle
Vanya.''

<HEAD>Son of Prize-Winning Author Files for Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Steinbeck IV, son of the late
prize-winning author John Steinbeck, filed a petition in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court for liquidation of his debts.
   The hand-written petition filed Monday by Steinbeck, acting as
his own attorney, lists debts of $19,659 and property assets of
$936.
   Steinbeck, who identified himself in the petition as a
self-employed writer, listed income of less than $24,000 annually
in royalties from his father's estate.
   Efforts to telephone Steinbeck at his La Jolla residence were
unsuccessful.
   One phone call was answered by a youth who identified himself as
Steinbeck IV's 17-year-old son. The youth said his father is the
late author's son.
   The boy also said he and his father have lived in La Jolla for
about 18 months since moving from Colorado.
   John Steinbeck, who died in New York in 1968 at age 66, won the
Nobel Prize in literature in 1962 and the Pulitzer Prize in 1940.
He such such works as ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' ``Of Mice and Men,''
``East of Eden'' and ``Cannery Row.''
   Steinbeck married Carol Henning in 1930. They divorced in March
1943 and later that year he married Gwyn Conger. They had two sons,
Tom and John. Steinbeck married a third time, in December 1950, to
Elaine Scott.

   ``City of Angels,'' a satire of gumshoe fiction
and Hollywood, was named best musical of the Broadway season, and
the Tony Award for best play went to an adaptation of John
Steinbeck's ``The Grapes of Wrath.''
   ``City of Angels'' won six Tonys overall, more than any other
production, in a ceremony Sunday at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater.
``Grand Hotel'' won five. The event was televised by CBS.
   The big loser was August Wilson's ``The Piano Lesson,'' which won
no Tonys even though it had five nominations, including best play,
and had won both the Pulitzer Prize and New York Drama Critics
Circle award.
   Tyne Daly, formerly of television's ``Cagney and Lacey,'' was
named best actress in a musical as the brassy stage mother Mama Rose
in ``Gypsy,'' a role originated by Ethel Merman 30 years ago. The
show also won as best revival.
   Robert Morse won as best actor in a play for his portrayal of
writer Truman Capote in ``Tru.'' Morse's competition included
Charles S. Dutton in ``The Piano Lesson'' and Dustin Hoffman as
Shylock in ``The Merchant of Venice.''
   ``I'm just so grateful to be back here,'' said Morse, who last
won a Tony in 1962 for ``How to Succeed in Business Without Really
Trying.''
   Maggie Smith won as best actress for ``Lettice &amp; Lovage.''
Margaret Tyzack, in the same play, won for best featured, or
supporting, actress. Charles Durning, Big Daddy in the revival of
``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' won the best featured actor Tony.
   ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' an adaptation by Frank Galati of the
novel about Dust Bowl Okies, also won a directing Tony for Galati.
In accepting his award, Galati paid tribute to Steinbeck's widow,
Elaine, and his ``enduring genius.''
   ``City of Angels'' a jazzy production set in 1940s Hollywood,
picked up the best actor prize for James Naughton, the show's
hardboiled detective.
   ``How sweet it is,'' he cracked.
   The musical also won awards for featured actress, Randy Graff as
a love-starved secretary; best book, Larry Gelbart; score, composer
Cy Coleman and lyricist David Zippel; and set design, Robin Wagner.
   Among the five awards for ``Grand Hotel,'' set in Berlin in the
years before Hitler, were two for Tommy Tune for direction and
choreography.
   ``When we were out of town, I didn't quite have the choreography
right,'' Tune said. ``I would like to thank the director for not
firing me.''
   ``Grand Hotel'' also won Michael Jeter a Tony as best featured
actor in a musical for his role as a dying bookkeeper dancing wildly
on a last fling.
   ``If you have got a problem with alcohol and you can't stop and
think life can't change and dreams can't come true, I stand here as
living proof that you can stop,'' he said in accepting the award.
``It changes a day at a time and dreams come true.''
   Costume designer Santo Loquasto and lighting designer Jules
Fisher both won Tonys for ``Grand Hotel.''
   Ron Silver, a presenter, made a speech supporting the National
Endowment for the Arts, which is under attack for funding art some
consider indecent. Silver also mentioned the anniversary of the
crackdown at Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   During a commercial break, executive producer Joe Cates asked for
no more references to those subjects. ``To take advantage of a live
television show that way does incredible harm,'' he said.
   But a winner after that, Galati, mentioned the endowment. ``Were
he alive, there would be no louder voice in support for the National
Endowment for the Arts than John Steinbeck,'' Galati said.
   Alfred Drake, who starred on Broadway in ``Oklahoma!'' ``Kismet''
and ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' received a special Tony.
   The Seattle Repertory Theater won a special Tony and $25,000 for
outstanding regional theater.
   The Tony Awards were begun in 1947 by the American Theater Wing
and are named for actress Antoinette Perry. They are voted on by
people working in Broadway theater and by theater journalists.

LA JOLLA'S RICH HARVEST OF 'GRAPES'

<TEXT>
<P>
Actor Terry Kinney, playing Jim Casy, stands alone on a stage without color or 
landscape and only a suggestion of barbed-wire fencing. 
</P>
<P>
"The dawn came, but no day," he intones in a voice drained of emotion. "In the 
air the dust hung like a fog. The men came out of their houses, and looked at 
the land. And the women came out of their houses and watched the men, waiting 
for them to break. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
So begins the Chicago Steppenwolf Company's presentation of "The Grapes of 
Wrath," which launched the La Jolla Playhouse's seventh season in the Mandell 
Weiss Theatre on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Adapted and directed by Frank Galati, a four-year company member (brief tenure 
by Steppenwolf standards), it's a tough and richly poetic dramatization of the 
John Steinbeck novel. Emotionally stark, visually bleak and aurally sustaining 
(composer and musical director Michael Smith has created a mood-setting musical 
frame performed on harmonica, a musical harp, banjo, fiddle and guitar), this 
lament for the destitute farmers who left Oklahoma's Dust Bowl in the '30s in 
search of work and survival in California has profound resonances in the 
present. The Okies were the first homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The echoes, however, run even deeper -- backward as well as forward. If the 
itinerant Joads are the quintessence of displaced America, they're only an 
extension of others: the displaced Native Americans and African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the desperation of the Joads, trying to stick together and survive in a 
country that (failing other ideas) can think only of exploiting them, informs 
the larger story of a nation set on a socially tragic course, in which the 
distance between the haves and have-nots relentlessly, endlessly widens. 
</P>
<P>
Those are the general communications. But as the particular informs the general 
best, this family's trials, their losses, their strength and their persistence 
against horrendous odds is the beating heart of the play (and the novel). The 
old truck that transports them becomes all the land they know. The fierce 
matriarchal grip that binds them (Lois Smith as a valiant if perhaps too 
calculated Ma Joad) becomes all the love they know. And the stillbirth of Rose 
of Sharon's baby, symbolically the death of hope, is wiped away by the 
regenerating final image: Rose (Sally Murphy, who knows how to be simple) 
baring her milk-choked breast to feed a starving stranger. 
</P>
<P>
Galati's text is, though not the first, probably the most effective 
dramatization of the novel to date. (Terence Shank had created an only slightly 
more sentimental one for L.A.'s Colony at the Studio Theatre Playhouse in 1980; 
it was later featured at Louisville's annual Humana Festival of new plays.) It 
understands something vitally important: that the only requirement for any play 
is that it be true to its intent. In the case of an adaptation, that means the 
original author's intent. On that level, the Steppenwolf "Grapes of Wrath" 
succeeds better than its predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
That is mainly because it doesn't compromise its bleakness and knows how to 
convey the poetry within it -- exactly as Steinbeck has done. The acting of 
this ensemble company ranges from excellent to good, hampered only when a 
clumsier technology gets in the way. Gary Sinise as Tom and Kinney as Jim Casy 
are the most individually memorable in the 35-member cast, which is to be 
commended for being less rather than more distinguishable. This "Grapes" is a 
testament to the rarely seen virtues of ensemble performance. 
</P>
<P>
Also ensemble production. 
</P>
<P>
The torn and faded costumes by Erin Quigley and Kevin Rigdon have the drab 
authenticity of economic condition all over them. The spare lighting and set 
designs by Rigdon create a deft, depressing mood, at once lyrical and stern, 
with clotheslines replacing the barbed wire in the second half, isolating pools 
of light, recessed bonfires, a waist-deep water channel representing the river, 
white lightning and sheets of rain crashing down to the sound of apocalyptic 
thunder during the rainstorm (Rob Milburn designed the sound) -- and of course 
the truck. 
</P>
<P>
This key player in the story has to be moved around on a special 
radio-controlled frame. That's the only time that technology hinders rather 
than helps. But theater is not about realism. It is about poetic illusion. And, 
in this case, it is also very much about words. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbeck's, distilled by Galati (who also did the film adaptation of "The 
Accidental Tourist"), are as potent and invigorating as ever. At almost 3 1/2 
hours, the impact of this transposed "Grapes of Wrath" remains undiluted. 
</P>
<P>
At the Mandell Weiss Theatre on the campus of UC San Diego, Tuesdays through 
Sundays, 8 p.m.; matinees Saturdays and Sundays, 2 p.m. Until June 17. Tickets:

BEST BETS: PHOTOS RECAPTURE 'GRAPES OF WRATH'

<TEXT>
<P>
Horace Bristol's photographs of poor itinerant farmers during the California 
Dust Bowl years are as poignant as "The Grapes of Wrath," the John Steinbeck 
novel inspired by the same scenes Bristol recorded on film. 
</P>
<P>
They can be seen with other Bristol photos at the Ojai Arts Center Gallery, 
where black and white works of the 82-year-old Ojai resident are on display 
through the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
Bristol's photo essays include ones taken during World War II in Japan, Korea 
and North Africa. 
</P>
<P>
But some of his most important work was shot here in California, capturing the 
plight of the people who lost everything during the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
Bristol traveled through Northern California with author John Steinbeck and 
made a photo record of families fighting for survival during the dust bowl 
days. 
</P>
<P>
The story is a fictionalized account of "the actual people that we came in 
contact with," Bristol said. "Steinbeck grew fond of my prints and he wrote 
about the real people in them." 
</P>
<P>
" 'The Grapes of Wrath' is something that every generation must be reminded 
of," he said, "and I hope this helps." 
</P>
<P>
The gallery is located at 113 S. Montgomery St., Ojai. For information, call

<HEAD>Hotel Where Steinbeck Lounged To Be Demolished</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALINAS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city is planning to demolish the
Hotel Cominos, where a young John Steinbeck caroused. He later
wrote about the hotel in ``The Long Valley,'' ``Dubious Battle''
and ``East of Eden.''
   The gray cast-stone and stucco hotel _ with its grand ballroom,
marble fireplace, hardwood floors and frosted glass chandeliers
with gold leaf trim _ was a center of activity when Steinbeck's
hometown had a population of 4,000.
   Today, the hotel stands abandoned and rubble-filled and
officials in this city of 100,000 residents say they have more
important thing to spend money on.
   They decided earlier this month to tear it down soon.
   ``Steinbeck used to go down to the hotel,'' recalled Betty
Brusa, who briefly met him when she was a girl in the 1920s. ``He
belonged to what was called the `rat pack.' They broke up the lobby
one night throwing things at one another.''
   Steinbeck, born in Salinas in 1902, moved away to college and
went on to win a Nobel Prize for literature in 1962, six years
before his death. He was in town long enough to see what opened as
the Abbott House in 1874 transformed into the Cominos.
   The hotel declined in the 1950s and began a steep slide in the
1960s. It closed in the early 1980s and now belongs to the city.
   ``This is the most significant landmark in town,'' said Gary
Breschini, an archaeologist. He said preservationists are willing
to allow most of the hotel to be razed if the original part, the
Abbott, is restored. They estimate the cost at $500,000.
   Officials, however, said it would cost about $3.5 million, money
that should go to projects more vital to the growing city.
   A redevelopment plan calls for replacing the hotel with a
parking lot, an office building and a Steinbeck museum behind a
facade depicting the original hotel.
   The city's decision stirred memories of a brillant writer who
became hated by his own neighbors because of his defense of migrant
farm workers.
   ``Steinbeck was not liked in this town,'' said Brusa, president
of the Monterey County Historical Society. ``They did not
understand him. They burned `The Grapes of Wrath' here.''
   This year is the 50th anniversary of the ``The Grapes of
Wrath,'' the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel that was once banned in
the Salinas library.

   Drinking glasses were the first items
snapped up as author John Steinbeck's personal effects went on sale
at auction here.
   Most of the glasses sold separately to Steinbeck admirers happy
to have any item owned by the late author, who won the Pulitzer
Prize in 1940 for ``Grapes of Wrath'' and the Nobel Prize for
Literature in 1962.
   The highest-priced item, at $6,000, was a painting of Gwyn
Steinbeck, second of the author's three wives and mother of his
sons. The lowest-priced, at $1, was a plastic measuring cup owned
by his son, John Steinbeck IV.
   Many of the buyers Friday were writers.
   ``He was a great American author, and so am I,'' said Jim
Hermanson of Denver, who bought a plain water glass for $16. He
described himself as ``an unemployed writer of short stories and
autobiographical pieces.''
   KCNC-TV editor Jim Syring of Denver found the sale a good
opportunity, ``especially in this area of the country, to get
something that was Steinbeck's without having to go to either coast
_ and just to have something that was his.'' He bought a wineglass
for $24.
   ``This will sit on my desk,'' he said, ``and I'll sit back
occasionally and have a glass of sherry in it ... and remind myself
that that was partly his downfall.''
   Evergreen building contractor Dean Snyder bought a hand-blown
blue martini glass with a twisty stem for $40.
   ``I've read Steinbeck all my life,'' he said. ``And my
father-in-law has read Steinbeck all his life. My father-in-law
also drinks martinis, so he's going to have a Steinbeck martini
glass.''
   Snyder also bought a slightly tattered photograph of Steinbeck,
signed by the author. ``I think it's a real bargain'' at $40,
Snyder said.
   The sale was to continue today.

   ``City of Angels,'' a jazzy, satire of 1940s
Hollywood and hardboiled detective fiction, won the Tony Award
Sunday night as best musical of the 1989-90 Broadway season.
   ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' an adaptation by Frank Galati of the
John Steinbeck novel about Dust Bowl Okies, beat out August Wilson's
``The Piano Lesson'' for best play. The production by Chicago's
Steppenwolf Theater Company also won a directing Tony for Galati.
   In accepting his award, Galati paid tribute to Steinbeck's widow,
Elaine, ``and the enduring genius of her husband, John.''
   ``City of Angels'' picked up a total of six awards, more than any
other production. James Naughton, the musical's macho detective
hero, was named best actor, and cracked, ``How sweet it is,'' when
he claimed his award.
   The show also won a featured actress prize for Randy Graff, who
plays a love-starved secretary in the show. ``City of Angels'' also
collected prizes for best book of a musical _ Larry Gelbart _ and
best score for composer Cy Coleman and lyricist David Zippel as well
as the set design award for Robin Wagner.
   Tommy Tune scored twice for ``Grand Hotel,'' picking up awards
for direction of a musical and choreography. ``I am very proud to be
part of such a sparkling season on Broadway,'' he said.
   Robert Morse withstood some stiff competition, including Dustin
Hoffman and Charles S. Dutton, to win the actor prize for his
performance in ``Tru,'' based on the life of writer Truman Capote.
   ``I'm just so grateful to be back here,'' Morse said. Morse last
won a Tony in 1962 for ``How to Succeed in Business Without Really
Trying.''
   As expected, Maggie Smith won the best actress prize for her
portrayal of an eccentric tour guide in ``Lettice &amp; Lovage.''
   Also no surprise was the best actress-musical award to Tyne Daly
for her portrayal of Mama Rose in a revival of ``Gypsy.'' ``I've got
30 seconds for a 36-year-old fantasy,'' exulted Miss Daly who was
making her first appearance on Broadway. ``Gypsy'' also took the
best revival prize.
   Michael Jeter, who plays a timid bookkeeper in ``Grand Hotel,''
won for featured actor in a musical. In an emotional speech, Jeter,
a popular choice, told the audience, ``You are my heart,'' as the
crowd cheered.
   Charles Durning, who plays Big Daddy in a revival of Tennessee
Williams' ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' won for featured actor in a
play, while Margaret Tyzack, the prim employer of Maggie Smith in
``Lettice &amp; Lovage'' was named best featured actress.
   The other technical awards were taken by ``Grand Hotel,'' for the
costumes of Santo Loquasto and the lighting of Jules Fisher.
   Alfred Drake, the robust baritone of such Broadway hits as
``Oklahoma!'', ``Kiss Me, Kate'' and ``Kismet,'' was awarded a
special Tony honor for excellence. The Seattle Repertory Theater was
given the Tony for outstanding regional theater.
   The 1989-90 season was one of the best in recent years. Compared
with the previous season, which produced only one big musical _
``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' _ and one big play _ ``The Heidi
Chronicles,'' this year brought more than enough candidates for most
Tony categories.
   In fact, several likely candidates for nominations were ignored,
including Vanessa Redgrave for ``Orpheus Descending'' and the trio
of stars from the revival of W. Somerset Maugham's ``The Circle'' _
Glynis Johns, Stewart Granger, and the late Rex Harrison, who died
of cancer Saturday, less than a month after his last performance in
the play.

   The Antoinette Perry Awards, known as the Tonys, were founded in
1947 by the American Theater Wing. The awards show, held this year
at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater and televised on CBS, was presented by
the wing and the League of American Theaters and Producers.
   The nominees were chosen by a 12-person committee ranging from
lyricist Sheldon Harnick to producer Jean Dalrymple to Rosetta
LeNoire, artistic director of the AMAS Repertory Theater. The
winners were chosen by more than 700 voters, mostly theater
professionals, critics and journalists.

<TEXT>
   An eastern Oklahoma town that once
reviled writer John Steinbeck for his portrayal of the region in
``The Grapes of Wrath'' has named a festival after the classic.
   ``We needed some kind of celebration,'' said Don Elwick, manager
of the the Chamber of Commerce in this community of 6,400 people.
   The Grapes of Wrath festival this weekend will feature souvenir
bags of dust and a costume contest for the best-dressed Depression
victim. There will also be showings of the movie of the book
everyone once hated, though some locals were cast in it.
   ``We weren't the Dust Bowl,'' insists 84-year-old Pauline
Plunkett, who was an extra when ``The Grapes of Wrath'' was filmed
in 1939.
   ``They left the impression that all this area of the country was
just poor, non-working, ornery people,'' Ms. Plunkett said. ``That
wasn't the way it was.''
   When the novel ``The Grapes of Wrath'' was published, Oklahomans
of the era generally objected. It was banned in some places.
   But when the book was made into a movie, Hollywood came to
Sallisaw for background shots, including one 23-second scene of
cars and trucks loaded down with Oklahomans and their belongings in
the exodus to California.
   Ms. Plunkett said she was on her front porch one day when her
husband, Olen, drove up in his pickup and yelled, ``Y'all get your
clothes ready.''
   ``We just hopped in the pickup like we was,'' she said. The next
thing they knew, they were in the movies.
   As the procession of vehicles reached the end of the road for
the shot, the film crew paid passengers through the windows in
silver dollars. Some recall getting $2, some $5, some $7 for
drivers.
   It was a lot of money then. ``We had people here working for 50
cents a day and supporting a family,'' said Bill Lovern, who played
hooky from high school that day.

   Furniture, paintings and other items that belonged
to the late John Steinbeck will be sold at auction next weekend,
says an estate broker hired by the author's sons.
   The furniture is nicked and scratched, knobs are missing from a
china cabinet and the frame is pulling away from an oil painting.
Some pieces seem vintage garage sale.
   ``We're not talking a great deal of monetary value on these
pieces,'' said Sylvia Link, a Denver estate broker and antiques
dealer who will conduct the sale at Estate Brokerage House on
Friday through Sunday.
   Steinbeck, author of ``The Grapes of Wrath'' and the 1962 Nobel
Prize winner, died in 1968.
   The sale has been commissioned by his sons, John, 41, and
Thomas, 43, who live in California. John lived in Boulder from 1979
to 1987, and his father's belongings remain stored there.
   The collection accounts for much of the author's estate, with
the exception of some silver sold earlier and items kept by the
family, according to John's wife, Nancy Steinbeck.
   The furniture and art is an eclectic mix, much of it American
and Oriental. Acquired by the man whose works, such as ``Cannery
Row'' and ``Of Mice and Men,'' were sympathetic to the common man,
the items reflect Steinbeck's apparent casual attitude toward
material possessions.
   A Chippendale corner cupboard normally would sell for about
$3,000. Because it belonged to Steinbeck, it probably will sell for
about $5,500, Link said.

   Preservationists and admirers of author
John Steinbeck have won a temporary victory in their battle to save
a hotel he once frequented.
   Monterey County Superior Court Judge John Phillips ruled
Wednesday the city failed to obtain an adequate environmental impact
report before ordering the Cominos Hotel torn down.
   The building, built in 1874 and remodeled in 1919, was visited
often and mentioned in several works by Steinbeck, famous for such
books as ``The Grapes of Wrath'', ``East of Eden'' and ``Of Mice and
Men.''
   The city decided in April to raze the hotel for a parking lot,
office building and museum.
   But the Monterey County Historical Society sued, saying the
environmental analysis was deficient. The group actively promotes
Steinbeck's connections to the agricultural region.
   Preliminary studies indicate it would cost $4.5 million to
refurbish the hotel.
   Steinbeck, who won the Nobel and Pulitzer prizes, died in 1968.

   Movie stars Dustin Hoffman, Kathleen Turner,
Maggie Smith and Tom Hulce won recognition for their work on stage
in the 1990 Tony nominations for the best of Broadway.
   Two lavish musicals, ``Grand Hotel'' and ``City of Angels,''
dominated the nominations announced Monday.
   ``Grand Hotel,'' a Tommy Tune musical set in 1920s Berlin, led
the field in the musical category with 12 nominations. ``City of
Angels,'' a 1940s Los Angeles detective musical, garnered 11.
   Both shows were nominated for best musical along with Andrew
Lloyd Webber's ``Aspects of Love'' and ``Meet Me in St. Louis,'' a
stage version of the MGM musical.
   The winners will be announced June 3 on CBS. They will be chosen
by 661 theatrical professionals and journalists who vote by secret
ballot.
   ``The Piano Lesson'' by August Wilson, the winner of this year's
Pulitzer Prize for drama, is the top contender for best play. It
will face ``Prelude to a Kiss,'' a comic fantasy by Craig Lucas,
``Lettice &amp; Lovage,'' by Peter Shaffer, and ``The Grapes of
Wrath,'' an adaptation by Frank Galati of John Steinbeck's novel.
   Smith was the favorite to win the best actress-play award for
her performance as an eccentric British tour guide in ``Lettice &amp;
Lovage.''
   Her competition will be newcomer Mary-Louise Parker of ``Prelude
to a Kiss,'' Geraldine James, who played Portia in a revival of
``The Merchant of Venice,'' and Turner, who is Maggie in a new
production of Tennessee Williams' ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.''
   ``I was hopin' that would happen,'' Turner said as she announced
the nominees at Sardi's, the restaurant of the theater crowd.
   Hoffman, snubbed by Tony nominators six years ago for his role
in a revival of ``Death of a Salesman,'' was nominated as best
actor for his portrayal of Shylock in ``The Merchant of Venice.''
   His competition in what could be a hotly contested category:
Charles S. Dutton, ``The Piano Lesson''; Hulce, the eager young
attorney in the courtroom drama ``A Few Good Men,'' and Robert
Morse, for his portrait of Truman Capote in ``Tru.''
   Tyne Daly, who plays Mama Rose in ``Gypsy,'' is the favorite to
win an award for best actress in a musical. Her competition
includes Georgia Brown, ``3 Penny Opera''; Beth Fowler, ``Sweeney
Todd,'' and Liliane Montevecchi, ``Grand Hotel.''
   Best actor-musical nominations went to David Carroll, Miss
Montevecchi's co-star in ``Grand Hotel''; Bob Gunton, who played
the title role in ``Sweeney Todd,'' and the stars of ``City of
Angels,'' James Naughton and Gregg Edelman.
   ``Gypsy'' and ``Sweeney Todd'' received best revival
nominations, as did ``The Merchant of Venice'' and ``The Circle,''
by W. Somerset Maugham.
   Michael Blakemore received two directing nominations, for
``Lettice &amp; Lovage'' and ``City of Angels.'' His competition in the
musical category are Tune, ``Grand Hotel''; Trevor Nunn, ``Aspects
of Love,'' and Susan H. Schulman, ``Sweeney Todd.''
   Blakemore goes against Galati, ``The Grapes of Wrath''; Peter
Hall, ``The Merchant of Venice,'' and Lloyd Richards, ``The Piano
Lesson,'' for best direction of a play.
   Tune also received a nomination for his choreography of ``Grand
Hotel.'' In a meager year for dance on Broadway, there were only
two other nominees, Joan Brickhill for ``Meet Me in St. Louis'' and
Graciela Daniele for ``Dangerous Games.''
   Terry Kinney and Gary Sinise, both from ``The Grapes of Wrath,''
received featured or supporting actor nominations. They will go
against Rocky Carroll in ``The Piano Lesson'' and Charles Durning,
who plays Big Daddy in ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.''
   Polly Holliday, who plays Big Mama in the production, was
nominated for best featured actress in a play. Also nominated were
S. Epatha Merkerson in ``The Piano Lesson,'' Lois Smith in ``The
Grapes of Wrath'' and Margaret Tyzack in ``Lettice &amp; Lovage.''

LIZ SMITH: CHAPLIN ON FILM, PEPPERY PECCADILLOES AND ALL

CHARLIE CHAPLIN's widow, Oona O'Neill, has resisted, for the 12 years since her 
husband's death, all attempts to bring the great comic's life to the screen. 
Now she has finally given Sir Richard Attenborough the go-ahead. 
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Lady Chaplin was afraid her husband's biography would be 
unnecessarily sensationalized, given his well-publicized sexual peccadilloes 
with very young ladies. Some he married. His first two wives were 16 when they 
became his brides. Some he did not. (Joan Barry, who brought a successful 
paternity suit against him in the 1940s.) 
</P>
<P>
Chaplin, who was born in London and never acquired U.S. citizenship, also fell 
victim to the McCarthy communist witch hunt of the early '50s. He was virtually 
hounded out of the United States, much to the delight of gossip columnists 
Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons, who had never approved of his romantic 
escapades anyway. Chaplin did not set foot on American soil for 20 years, and 
only then to accept a special Academy Award in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
However, Attenborough says, "Lady Chaplin has given me access to all his 
private papers and letters and has given me carte blanche to make the film the 
way I want." Filming starts in London in November. It is to be directed by 
Bryan Forbes. The role of Chaplin has yet to be cast, but Attenborough 
cautions: "He can't be more than 5-foot-something and he will have to age from 
18 to 76." 
</P>
<P>
ELAINE STRITCH is just zipping along. Miz Stritch, so good in the recent PBS 
American Playhouse production "Sense and Sensibility," and who has popped up in 
such diverse entries as the sitcom "Head of the Class" and the TV movie 
"Sparks" with Victoria Principal, may be on the tube regularly. Elaine has been 
signed to play the Shirley MacLaine role in the projected "Steel Magnolias" 
series for CBS. Elaine says she hopes it's a "go" because she wants to buy a 
house. "Anything I get from this is 'house money.' " Before shooting starts on 
the "Magnolias" pilot, Elaine performs A. R. Gurney's "Love Letters" with Jason 
Robards in Boston, later this month.

CHICAGO'S RED HOT Steppenwolf Theater Company arrives in previews at Broadway's 
Cort in New York today with their adaptation of John Steinbeck's "The Grapes of 
Wrath." Director Frank Galati also did the work transforming Steinbeck's famous 
novel of the Great Depression into a stage production. This "Wrath" stars Gary 
Sinise, Terry Kinney, Jeff Perry and Lois Smith. Steinbeck's widow, Elaine, has 
traveled extensively with the show through its acclaimed engagements in 
Chicago, California and London. 
</P>
<P>
DON'T MISS attorney Raoul Lionel Felder's editorial in Newsweek titled "Look 
Out, Donald!" Felder has done a witty and considered take on why he thinks 
"L'Affaire Trump" is not necessarily good for business, as Donald says it is. 
</P>
<P>
Felder also notes the new fly in the ointment -- Ivana's "handhold on a 
slippery ledge which may not be enough to win her case, but enough perhaps to 
cause Donald, for all practical purposes, to lose his." This revolves around 
the last contract between the couple in which Trump's lawyers failed to 
distinguish between "marital property" and "separate property." Felder notes 
that, in any event, even if Ivana loses on this point, her case cannot be 
thrown out of court before extensive financial disclosure. That is just what 
Trump doesn't want.

<HEAD>`The Grapes of Wrath,' Tony Winner Best Play, Closing Labor Day
Weekend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' winner of the 1990 Tony
Award as best play, will close Labor Day weekend after a Broadway
run of less than six months, a show spokeswoman said Tuesday.
   The play, based on the classic John Steinbeck novel, will have
played 188 performances and 11 previews when it ends its run Sept.
2, said Ellen Levene.
   The production from Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater Company opened
March 22 to favorable reviews, but never became a hot ticket.
Business improved a bit in June after the show won two Tony awards
_ for best play and for Frank Galati as best director of a play.
   The show, which has a large cast of 35 performers, needs to
gross around $180,000 a week to break even and has been doing that
or a little better in recent weeks. But grosses slipped last week
to about $177,900.
   Galati adapted the sprawling novel, set during the Depression,
for the stage. It had its premiere in Chicago in September 1988 and
traveled to La Jolla, Calif., and London before opening on Broadway
in March.
   Three other Broadway shows will close the same weekend. Slated
to end their runs on Sept. 1 are ``Tru,'' Robert Morse's portrait
of author Truman Capote; the musical ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'';
and Wendy Wasserstein's ``The Heidi Chronicles,'' the 1989 best
play Tony winner.

   There was more drama off-camera than on at the
1990 Tony Awards, although ``The Grapes of Wrath'' was the upset
winner for best play over ``The Piano Lesson.''
   The flap occurred during a commercial break at the televised
award show when producer Joseph Cates blasted presenter Ron Silver
for his lengthy defense of the embattled National Endowment for the
Arts and for his remembrance of the massacre in Beijing one year ago.
   ``I support the NEA,'' Cates explained to the black tie audience
at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater, but added: ``To take advantage of a
live TV show like that does us all incredible harm. This is not the
show on which to make those comments.''
   Cates' comments were met with scattered boos and some applause by
theatergoers.
   If ``The Piano Lesson,'' which had won the Pulitzer Prize and the
New York Drama Critics Circle Award, was Sunday evening's biggest
loser, ``City of Angels'' was the biggest winner. It took home six
awards including best musical. The show also won for actor-musical,
James Naughton; score, Cy Coleman and David Zippel; book, Larry
Gelbart; featured actress-musical, Randy Graff, set design, Robin
Wagner.
   ``The Grapes of Wrath'' only won two honors, including a
directing award for Frank Galati, but they were important prizes.
What counts in terms of box office is the best play award, and the
honor should help business at the stage adaptation of John
Steinbeck's epic novel about Depression-era Okies. Until now, the
play has been doing respectable but not sell-out business.
   Other highlights:
   _Best speech: Tommy Tune's second Tony of the night, a prize for
his direction of ``Grand Hotel.'' The lanky Tune strode to the
stage, smiled, waved at the audience and walked off. He also picked
up a Tony for the show's choreography. Tune has won seven Tonys
during a Broadway career that has brought him prizes in four
different categories, actor-musical, featured actor-musical,
director-musical and choreography, a Tony record.
   _Worst speech: Tyne Daly's rambling thank you in which she kept
reminding the audience that she only had 30 seconds in which to
speak and then proceeded to ignore her own time limit for several
minutes. Daly won the actress-musical award for her portrayal of
Mama Rose in a revival of ``Gypsy.''
   _Most emotional speech _ Michael Jeter's tearful plea, ``If you
have got a problem with alcohol and drugs and you can't stop and
think life can't change and dreams can't come true, I stand here as
living proof that you can stop,'' he said in accepting the featured
actor award-musical for ``Grand Hotel.'' ``It changes a day at a
time and dreams come true.''
   _Wittiest speech: Charles Durning, who picked up the supporting
actor prize for his portrayal of Big Daddy in a revival of ``Cat on
a Hot Tin Roof.'' Saying he didn't deserve the award, he added,
``but I don't deserve arthritis either.''
   _The evening's strangest omissions: No mention during the
telecast of Rex Harrison, the debonair star of ``My Fair Lady,'' who
died at age 82 Saturday, one day before the Tonys show. And the
closing of ``A Chorus Line'' didn't rate a footnote even though the
final performance of Broadway's longest running show on April 28 was
one of the highlights of the season.

<DESCRIPT>  ARTS; LETTER  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  WITH the politics and commercialism, Hollywood goes to extremes to take the
glory out of its Academy Awards. We have ignored the nominations and the
ceremonies for decades because of it. However, this year we paid close
attention to the nominations and even watched the televised -- and thoroughly
abysmal -- awards program, because of "Dances With Wolves.";    We write both
to applaud Scott Willis' great cartoon (March 27), and to deplore the attempts
to marginalize and deny the artistic and thematic accomplishment of this film.
The TV show and the Mercury News critics Ron Miller and Glenn Lovell's
post-awards articles reveal profound racism ("Two Cheers for a Strangely
Subdued Oscar Night" and "Red Carpets, Big Smiles, Tight Security," March 26).
This racism is probably subconscious and, thus, all the more profound.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  STANDING UP FOR 'DANCES WITH WOLVES'  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Letters  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The author and makers of "Dances With Wolves" had a serious purpose -- to
show that Native Americans had a culture at least as valid as our own.;    The
TV show's producers nearly avoided any recognition of the film's real theme,
although they couldn't keep the award winners from mentioning it. A clip shown
to demonstrate the nomination for best film was the buffalo hunt -- notable
mostly for spectacle and special effects. Clips shown along with recounting of
the other nominations de-emphasized Native Americans, except where this was
completely unavoidable. Not one contained a subtitle.;    If Michael Blake had
not provided the Lakota translation of his remarks, there would have been no
acknowledgment that the film had large non-English segments. The only Native
American actor nominated did not win.;    Miller and Lovell have added to this
denial. In his Tuesday review of the ceremonies Miller called Doris Leader
Charge "a shy interpreter named Doris," and made a crack about Marlon Brando
and an interpreter -- these Indians are all interchangeable, apparently.
Leader Charge appeared in the film and was one of the native-language
consultants for it. Her role was further trivialized by Lovell in his
Wednesday column.;    Miller was correct that Costner did not project like a
TV entertainer. He sounded to us like a real person. Thank goodness. Must
everything on TV be artificial?;    Lovell thinks that the seven awards
resulted from the "proud-to-be-American" jingoism that accompanied the gulf
war. Perhaps he is right. But if so, he forgot to mention that the impulse is
abysmally misplaced. "Dances" is not about waving the flag.;    Lovell says
(now, but not in earlier reviews) that the impact of the film is due only to
its visual tableaux. This assertion was meant to deny credit to Costner, who
apparently did not direct some or all of the scenic vista and hunt scenes. But
it also fundamentally denies the dramatic content and trivializes the real
theme.;    Lovell's unconscious (?) racism shows up again in his repetition of
the TV announcer's mistaken identification of Rodney Grant (long hair and
feathers) as Graham Greene. Do these people all look alike to him?; Jane E.
Nielson; Owen Pike; Howard Wilshire; Mountain View;  I was outraged to read
what film critic Glenn Lovell wrote about the success of "Dances With Wolves"
at the Academy Awards:;    "Echoing America's recent return to old-fashioned,
flag-waving patriotism, Oscar embraced a film that celebrates the American
frontier and calls for a rekindling of the American spirit," and "This was
clearly the year for lump-in-the-throat escapism . . .";    Escapism? "Dances"
left me with the impression it had more historical accuracy in any 10-minute
segment than all the John Wayne films put together.;    It's beyond me as to
how "Dances" could have made anyone feel patriotic and filled with the
frontier American spirit. The film shows "Americans" as short-sighted and
cruel, and the Native Americans as wise and kind. "Dances" left me feeling
ashamed that my ancestors may have had anything to do with destroying such a
wonderful civilization, even if only through their silence.;    The film does
not call for a rekindling of the American spirit; it calls for us to
re-examine our values, and to have some humility and appreciation for this
wonderful land we inhabit.;    Douglas Hooper; San Jose;  'WASP' unacceptable;
   In behalf of European-Americans in San Jose, this is to protest your use of
the impenetrable term "WASP" in Glenn Lovell's review of March 21 ("Japanese
Cartoon Tales: Loud, Violent, Schmaltzy," Living).;    I have to say that I
enjoyed his writing style very much. He got more clever insights and dark
hints into 44 lines of type than I have ever seen in the Mercury News before.;
   However, the use of WASP is just not acceptable to us European-Americans.
First of all, you use WASP as the opposite (or equivalent term) of Asian or
Japanese. The correct opposite/equivalent term to Asian is European, and it
would have worked very well. If I understand what you mean by WASPs, then the
words "British" or "English" would have worked very well.;    Second, I doubt
that non-European-Americans understand even remotely what WASP really means;
so that reduces the impact of good writing, and should be avoided.;    Third,
using WASP does a serious disservice to us European-Americans by reducing us
to a bland, pasty background. Many of us are not really "white," and most of
us are neither Anglo-Saxon nor Protestant.; Dale Warner; San Jose;  'Grapes'
picked over;    I was struck by something Ron Miller mentioned in his review
of the PBS "Grapes of Wrath" presentation ("PBS Picks 'Grapes of Wrath,' " TV,
March 17). He said that, among other reasons, the makers of the 1940 film
version changed the ending of Steinbeck's story because "any contact between
black man and white woman would have cost the studio all its Southern
bookings.";    This sent me scrambling for my copy of the novel. I can find no
reference to the race of the man Rose of Sharon suckles. He is simply
described as "about fifty, his whiskery face gaunt, and his open eyes wee
vague and staring.";    It seems obvious to me that the Steppenwolf Theater
Company chose Lex Monson, an Afro-American, to play the dying man in the barn
for the same reason that they chose an Afro-American actress to play the
preachy woman in "Weed Patch" -- there was simply no reason not to.;    You
also mention that John Ford left this scene out because the showing of women's
breasts on screen in 1940 was taboo. One could argue, however, that the scene
could be filmed as Steinbeck wrote it without showing Rose of Sharon's breasts
(by filming from behind her, for example).;    More likely, the last 60 pages
of the book were ignored because they did not "fit" with the story Ford and
screenwriter Nunnally Johnson created when they swapped two of Steinbeck's
major plot developments. By putting the peach orchard strike and Jim Casey's
death before the government camp episode, Ford was able to give the movie an
uplifting message -- that the sorrows of migrant farmworkers could be
alleviated by toilets and running water. It's a watering down of the novel's
impact and makes irrelevant the late chapters of the book.;    Still, the 1940
movie is a great film, and I have never been able to read the novel without
thinking of Henry Fonda, John Carradine, Jane Darwell and the other actors.
Steinbeck himself was very pleased with it, just as he would have enjoyed the
Steppenwolf production (as Elaine Steinbeck assures us in the play's
introduction).;    I write because I feel this was a pretty important
oversight in an otherwise well-written review.; Tony Ortega; Santa Cruz  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Brothers Convicted In Drug Case Ordered To Read Five Books Each</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When two brothers pleaded guilty to drug
charges, the judge didn't throw the book at them _ he just told
them to read 10 books.
   Circuit Judge John E. Rochester ordered Henry McQueen, 31, and
Isaac McQueen, 30, of Montgomery to read five novels each, write
reports on them and keep a weekly diary on what each is doing with
his life and what he's learned from his experience in the judicial
system.
   Henry McQueen was ordered to read ``The Grapes of Wrath'' by
John Steinbeck, ``Lie Down in Darkness'' by William Styron,
``Animal Farm'' by George Orwell, ``Bonfire of the Vanities'' by
Tom Wolfe and ``The Reivers'' by William Faulkner.
   Isaac McQueen was ordered to read ``Lord of the Flies'' by
William Golding, ``Crime and Punishment'' by Feodor Dostoevski,
``The Trial'' by Franz Kafka, ``Confessions of Nat Turner'' by
Styron, and ``East of Eden'' by Steinbeck.
   The McQueens, who pleaded guilty Wednesday to cocaine possession
charges, were given a suspended sentence of one year and a day, in
addition to five years supervised probation, which the judge said
could be revoked if they failed to do their book reports or keep
their diaries.
   He also said the sentences would remain suspended so long as
they hold jobs and obey the law.
   Rochester, a Clay County jurist serving in the Montgomery
circuit as a visiting judge, said he has been imposing book-reading
sentences for about nine months to a year in his rural circuit.
   He said generally he sentences defendants to read books or keep
diaries ``for the educational value. I don't think corrections is
doing enough.''
   The judge startled the courtroom when he imposed the novel
sentence.
   ``As the sentence was being read, I looked around the courtroom
and people's eyes were getting big,'' said David Belser, the
assistant district attorney who handled the case. ``People were
nodding in the affirmative, `That's great.'''
   Given the normal course of criminal justice system proceedings,
he said, the sentence was ``a breath of fresh air.''
   But Elna Reese, defense attorney for Henry McQueen, said
Thursday the judge would be asked to reconsider the sentence. She
said five years probation for first offenders was too harsh.

<TEXT>  For alternatives, see below:; THERE must be thousands of otherwise normal
people out there who, like yours truly, would rather watch the Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles polish their shells than tune in tonight's "major" television
event: the NBA Basketball Finals.;    I do not begrudge hoops fans the chance
to watch Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan compete for next year's
commercial-endorsement title belt. I even acknowledge basketball as the really
hot TV sport these days. But I've never been able to work up much interest in
watching a bunch of glandular phenomenons rush up and down a basketball
court.;    This is not my elitism showing. After all, I spent half my life
writing about professional boxing and hanging out with guys who make Mike
Tyson sound like William F. Buckley; so I'm in no position to sneer.;   
Anyway, I feel it's my duty as a TV critic to offer some alternative to
basketball for those viewers who think the Bulls are what they call cops in
the Windy City and that Michael Jordan is a famous shoe salesman.;    Thanks
to cable and a handful of independent stations, there is something else to
watch between 6 and at least 8:30 p.m., when everybody else presumably is
watching basketball. In fact, there's a lot to watch. Here are my
recommendations:;    (check)"The Trials of Life," 5-7 p.m. on cable's TNT
network. This is the fourth installment of David Attenborough's brilliant
series on the animal kingdom, from birth to death. This evening's subject:
animal socialization. If you loved naturalist Attenborough's earlier "Life on
Earth" and "Living Planet" series, this new one will captivate you. Also shown
at 8 p.m.;    (check)"The Strange Love of Martha Ivers," 6-8 p.m., on the
American Movie Classics (AMC) cable network. This 1946 film noir from director
Lewis Milestone ("All Quiet on the Western Front," "Of Mice and Men") is now
remembered most as the film that introduced Kirk Douglas -- for good reason:
He gets in some great scenery chewing as a small-town lawyer who's running for
district attorney.;    His major problem, besides his alcoholism: He's the
"strange love" of wife Martha (Barbara Stanwyck), a teen-age murderer who grew
up to be rich and manipulative, using her ill-gotten gains to drop-kick him
right to the top. Their world comes unglued when the childhood pal who knows
Martha's nasty secret returns to town in the form of Van Heflin. Also starring
husky-voiced Lizabeth Scott and, of all people, Dame Judith Anderson.;    By
the way, can you guess the first line of dialogue Kirk Douglas spoke on
screen? Answer: (To Stanwyck, who has just wakened him from a dead drunk)
"Hello!";    (check)"Touch of Evil," 6-8 p.m., on the Showtime pay-cable
network. After "Citizen Kane," this 1958 classic is Orson Welles' most
enjoyable film as actor/director. He's a hideously fat, perniciously corrupt
border cop who's butting his ridiculous putty nose into a murder investigation
with crusading Mexican lawman Charlton Heston, whose wife (Janet Leigh) is a
hostage of the bad guys.;    Perfectly entertaining as a thriller, it's also a
stylistic triumph. The long, masterful traveling shot that opens the movie may
be the best in film history. And Welles' self-parody is a hoot. As the
whorehouse madam played by Marlene Dietrich observes upon seeing Welles for
the first time in years: "You're a mess, honey. You've been eating too much
candy." You got that right, Marlene.;    (check)"Raising Arizona," 6:30-8, on
the HBO pay-cable network. This brisk comedy from 1987 just looks like it was
made by the Roadrunner and the Coyote. Actually it's the work of the quirky
Coen Brothers (Ethan &amp; Joel), who may be the most unpredictable auteurs
working in film.;    Nicolas Cage is a compulsive petty holdup man, who's
married to ex-cop Holly Hunter. They can't have children; so they decide to
snatch a quintuplet from a rich couple on the theory they'd never miss just
one kid. Wrong, wrong, wrong!;    From that point on, the whole movie is a
live-action cartoon, as everybody tries to catch them and get baby "Arizona"
back. Watch for hilarious bits from John Goodman as one of Cage's worthless
escaped convict pals and Randall "Tex" Cobb as a hell-bound biker hired to
track them down.;    (check)"The Grapes of Wrath," 7:30-10 p.m. on Ch. 20.
Henry Fonda is unforgettable as haunted migrant farmworker Tom Joad, symbol
for a generation of Dust Bowl "Okies," in director John Ford's 1940 film
version of John Steinbeck's angry novel about social injustice in America.
Ford won the directing Oscar and Jane Darwell the supporting-actress Oscar as
"Ma" Joad. But Gregg Toland's powerful black-and-white cinematography somehow
wasn't even nominated. Overlook the heavy-handed politics and the
self-consciously poetic dialogue here and there. What remains is a work of
indelible genius.;    (check)"Back Street," 8-9:30 p.m., on cable's American
Movie Classics (AMC) channel. Accept no substitutes: This 1932 tearjerker is
the definitive version of Fannie Hurst's much-filmed novel. Irene Dunne is
luminous as the young woman who becomes a rich man's mistress and suffers and
suffers and suffers. Ideal for feminists who want to see how bad things were
for grandma.;    (check)"Tanamera, Lion of Singapore," 8-10 p.m., Ch. 44. This
is the concluding two hours of the new Australian miniseries about the rich
English dude who wants to marry the rich Chinese girl, despite barriers of all
types up the wazoo. Fairly gripping, especially when the bad guy holds a knife
to the good girl's throat in the final reel.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   The grass is green in Liberal, Kan. In Amarillo, Texas, a
meteorologist says, ``We're in good shape.'' Folks in Beaver,
Okla., were inundated last week by six inches of rain from a single
storm.
   As much of the nation is parched by drought, much of the Dust
Bowl _ the 97 million-acre confluence of New Mexico, Texas,
Oklahoma, Colorado and Kansas that turned to desert a half century
ago _ has been spared.
   ``We're above seasonal rainfall. We're in good shape, very good
shape,'' said Gary Hartley of the National Weather Service in
Amarillo.
   But blue skies and healthy crops give little comfort to Gilbert
Steinkuehler, 73. He was a teen-ager in the 1930s, working on the
family farm in Goodwell, Okla., when the region suffered an
extended drought.
   Fertile soil dried to fine dust that was picked up by scouring
winds, creating black blizzards that rolled across the plains.
Millions of tons of topsoil were simply lifted off the land.
   And Steinkuehler is certain that the same conditions could bring
those days back again. ``There's not much you can do when there's
no water,'' he said.
   In 1932 and 1933, the annual rainfall in Goodwell was nine
inches below average. ``For seven or eight years, we had no
crops,'' Steinkuehler said.
   For much of the 1930s, street lights illuminated the
thoroughfares of the Dust Bowl at midday. Trains collided in dust
clouds. Chickens roosted at noon.
   ``The dawn came, but no day,'' wrote John Steinbeck in ``The
Grapes of Wrath,'' the classic novel of the Dust Bowl.
   Homemakers in the Dust Bowl turned plates and cups upside down
on the table until meals were served, to keep them clean. In 1935,
an enterprising carpet sweeper used his vacuum to clean attics; he
removed an average of two tons of dust from each of 227 attics in
southwestern Kansas.
   ``All we could do was just sit in our dusty chairs and gaze at
each other through the fog that filled the room and watch the fog
settle slowly and silently, covering everything,'' said one woman
from Garden City, Kan.
   Shutting doors and windows tightly didn't help. After the storm,
``Our faces were as dirty as if we had rolled in the dirt; our hair
was gray and stiff and we ground dirt between our teeth,'' she said.
   Texas state senators wore surgical masks while debating
legislation. Respiratory infections claimed scores of lives,
especially among the very old and very young. Others died: a young
boy walking home from school near Hays, Kan., lost his way. He was
found smothered by dust the next day.
   ``We long for the garden and little chickens, the trees and
birds and wildflowers of the years gone by. Perhaps if we do our
part these good things may return someday, for others if not
ourselves,'' wrote Caroline A. Henderson, a 28-year-old resident of
Alva, Okla., in 1936.
   Some, like Steinbeck's Joad family, couldn't wait. In 1936, a
survey found that one in four dwellings in 45 Dust Bowl counties
had been vacated in the previous three years. In six townships of
Oklahoma's Cimarron County, all but three of the 40 farm families
left for wetter parts.
   The dust bowl lost people, but it also lost soil at a rate of
850,000,000 tons a year. On April 12, 1934, a storm removed 300
million tons of soil; within days, that dust left a film on the
president's desk in Washington, on store shelves in New York City
and on ships 500 miles out in the Atlantic Ocean.
   R. Douglas Hurt, associate director of the Missouri State
Historical Society and author of ``The Dust Bowl: An Agricultural
and Social History,'' says droughts in that area are cyclical, and
the local soil is of a type that tends to break down into tiny
particles in the absence of moisture.
   The big dust storms of the 1930s, Hurt says, can be traced to
World War I, when wheat prices soared. Prices dropped during the
early 1920s, and farmers tried to recoup by planting more fields,
aided by new power machinery.
   In so doing, Hurt says, the farmers also were planting the seeds
of their own destruction. Once the sod was broken and the soil was
plowed repeatedly, it was exposed to the wind; the drought came,
the crops died, and without roots to hold the soil, it blew away.
   In the best of times, relatively few farmers practiced soil
conservation measures such as terracing and strip cropping, Hurt
says. But then a bumper wheat crop in 1931 caused prices to drop,
and even good farmers put aside conservation measures to try to
grow more wheat.
   Could it happen again?
   ``I think it's possible but I also think it's unlikely if
farmers have learned anything from the past, and I think they have.
Farmers today have the technical capabilities to handle their
fields properly,'' said Hurt.
   Soil conservation has become a fact of life; irrigation is more
prevalent, and land-grant universities have brought forth a
different kind of farmer. ``I think our farmers are too well
educated to let it happen again,'' said Emma Love, 89, a Oklahoma
Panhandle resident since 1905.
   Mrs. Love remembers ``days as black as night.'' Her father was
in real estate, and ``our real estate sure was blowing around.''
   She remembers the time her mother went to a jackrabbit roundup _
the creatures proliferated during the dirty '30s _ and was caught
in a duster: ``She told God that if she got out of it, she'd never
go to another.''
   She looks around today, and sees Dust Bowl survivors who stuck
it out. They and their children, she says, know enough to protect
the land.
   Still, she said, ``If there's someone who isn't taking care of
his land, that place blows.''

   ``City of Angels'' was named best musical of the
1989-90 theater season Wednesday by the Drama Desk, while ``The
Piano Lesson'' by August Wilson was chosen as best play.
   ``City of Angels,'' a satire of Hollywood and 1940s detective
novels, received eight awards, more than any other show. It was
followed by ``Grand Hotel,'' another big musical, which received
five awards, including two for Tommy Tune as oustanding
director-musical and choreographer.
   Nathan Lane won the best actor award for his portrait of an
obsessive fan of Maria Callas in ``The Lisbon Traviata.'' Named
best actress was Geraldine James, who played Portia in the Dustin
Hoffmann revival of ``The Merchant of Venice.''
   Tyne Daly, who plays Mama Rose in the revival of ``Gypsy,'' was
named best actress in a musical while James Naughton won the
actor-musical category as a hard-boiled Los Angeles private eye.
   Frank Galati was named best director of a play for his work on
``The Grapes of Wrath,'' an adaptation of the John Steinbeck novel.
   The Drama Desk, an association of New York drama critics and
reporters, will present the awards on May 20.

<HEAD>A Banner Season on Broadway Makes for Strong Tony Competition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A banner season on Broadway means Sunday's
annual Tony Awards celebration will have something it hasn't had in
a long time _ respectable and, in some cases, strong competition in
several categories.
   But ``City of Angels,'' a Hollywood detective musical, and ``The
Piano Lesson,'' August Wilson's drama about a black family coming
to terms with its past, are favorites for the top awards of best
musical and best play.
   The two-hour festivities, to be broadcast by CBS starting at 9
p.m. EDT, will be presided over by Kathleen Turner, a best-actress
nominee for her sultry performance in the box-office smash revival
of ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.''
   Among the stars scheduled to perform or present awards are
Matthew Broderick, Len Cariou, Dixie Carter, Michael Crawford,
Morgan Freeman, Timothy Hutton, James Earl Jones, Kevin Kline,
Bernadette Peters, Joan Rivers, Jessica Tandy and Lily Tomlin.
   This year's theme will be ``the year of the actor,'' with actors
doing solo turns. Kline will do a soliloquy from ``Hamlet,'' a role
he currently is playing off-Broadway.
   As usual, the program will feature scenes from best play and
best musical nominees. ``City of Angels'' will compete against
``Grand Hotel,'' Tommy Tune's stylish recreation of Vicki Baum's
novel set in the 1920s. The musical received 12 nominations, more
than any other show, including two for Tune for best
director-musical and best choreography.
   The other best-musical nominees are ``Aspects of Love,'' Andrew
Lloyd Webber's tale of passion in post-World War II France, and
``Meet Me in St. Louis,'' a lavish stage version of the famous Judy
Garland movie.
   ``The Piano Lesson,'' which already has won this year's Pulitzer
Prize for drama, faces its stiffest competition from ``The Grapes
of Wrath,'' an adaptation of John Steinbeck's novel by Frank Galati
and Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater Company.
   Also nominated are ``Prelude to a Kiss,'' a Manhattan fairy tale
by Craig Lucas, and ``Lettice &amp; Lovage,'' Peter Shaffer's look at
an eccentric British tour guide played by Maggie Smith.
   Miss Smith and Miss Turner are top contenders for best actress
honors. They will compete against Geraldine James, who played
Portia in a revival of ``The Merchant of Venice,'' and newcomer
Mary-Louise Parker, the bewildering bride in ``Prelude to a Kiss.''
The prize probably will go to Miss Smith.
   Dustin Hoffman, snubbed by Tony nominators six years ago for his
performance in Arthur Miller's ``Death of a Salesman,'' received a
best-actor nomination this year for playing Shylock in ``The
Merchant of Venice.''
   He is the biggest name, but the strongest competition comes from
Robert Morse, who portrays writer Truman Capote in the one-man play
``Tru.'' Also nominated are Tom Hulce as a brash lawyer in the
military courtroom drama ``A Few Good Men'' and Charles S. Dutton
of ``The Piano Lesson.''
   Unlike the 1989 awards when two categories _ best book of a
musical and best score _ were eliminated, this year's competition
will have a full complement of 19 categories. One category,
choreography, was whittled down to three nominees instead of the
usual four because of a scarcity of competition.
   Last year, Tony suspense was minimal with only three shows in
the best musical competition _ ``Starmites,'' which quickly folded,
and two revues, ``Black and Blue'' and ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway.''
   Even the 1989 best play, ``The Heidi Chronicles'' by Wendy
Wasserstein, was a predictable winner.
   One sure winner Sunday is Tyne Daly, who plays the formidable
Mama Rose in the revival of ``Gypsy.'' Her competition for best
actress in a musical includes Beth Fowler of ``Sweeney Todd,''
Georgia Brown of ``3 Penny Opera'' and Liliane Montevecchi of
``Grand Hotel.''
   The two stars of ``City of Angels,'' James Naughton and Gregg
Edelman, are nominated for best actor in a musical and compete
against David Carroll, the debonair jewel thief of ``Grand Hotel''
and Bob Gunton, who played the title role in the revival of
``Sweeney Todd.'' Naughton is the likely winner.
   The 1989-90 season was one of the best in terms of quantity and
quality.
   There were the inevitable flops, musical duds like ``3 Penny
Opera'' starring Sting and ``The Prince of Central Park.'' But
there also were a variety of plays and revivals, many with big
names. In fact, a lot of them weren't nominated for a Tony.
   Among the also-rans were Vanessa Redgrave, who starred in a
controversial revival of Tennessee Williams' ``Orpheus Descending''
and Rex Harrison, Glynis Johns and Stewart Granger, the three stars
of Somerset Maugham's ``The Circle.''

<DESCRIPT>  MOVIE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  IN 1945, film director Elia Kazan told writer John Steinbeck that the life of
Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata might make an interesting movie.;  
Steinbeck, the story goes, immediately began research on the enigmatic hero of
the revolution of 1910.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  STEINBECK NARRATIVE FOR 'ZAPATA' UNCOVERED  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Movies  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     But it was seven years before Kazan's "Viva Zapata!" starring Marlon Brando
and Anthony Quinn and with a screenplay by Steinbeck, was released to
theaters.;   And it would be nearly 40 years more before Steinbeck's
manuscript of the narrative from which the screenplay was taken would be
found.;   The narrative, "Zapata," was discovered by Carolyn and James
Robertson, publishers at Yolla Bolly Press, a small publishing house in
Covelo, near Willits.;   On Tuesday, the Robertsons will speak at San Jose
State University's Steinbeck Research Center about their search for the
missing manuscript.;   The Robertsons' talk, followed by a screening of "Viva
Zapata!" is the first in a series of three films sponsored by the Steinbeck
Research Center in celebration of its 20th anniversary.;   Steinbeck had long
been interested in Mexico when he was approached about the Zapata screenplay,
says Susan Shillinglaw, director of the Steinbeck Research Center. He set both
"The Pearl," and "Log From the Sea of Cortez" in Mexico, and wrote about the
Mexican-American community in Monterey in "Tortilla Flat.";   Before working
on the screenplay, he produced a 337-page dramatic narrative of the leader's
life, a narrative much richer in detail than the final screenplay. Although
the screenplay was eventually published, the original narrative wasn't,
possibly because no one knew where it was.;   The Robertsons suspected it
existed, says Shillinglaw, and they found it recently in the files of the UCLA
film archive.;   Yolla Bolly's 187-page book, which includes woodcuts by San
Francisco artist Karin Wikstrom, will be published Wednesday.; IFYOU'RE
INTERESTED; The Steinbeck Film Festival begins at 4 p.m. Tuesday, with Carolyn
and James Robertson and "Viva Zapata!" in room 285 of the Engineering Building
on the San Jose State campus. Other films in the series are "East of Eden" on
Feb. 26, and "Of Mice and Men" on April 8. The talks and screenings are free.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Theater:
   Housewife on the Run
   ----
   By Joel Henning
</HL>
<DATE>

<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A5
</SO>
<LP>
   Chicago -- Anne Tyler has created several memorably weird
families in a series of funny novels. Frank Galati knows how
to lift her characters off the page and make them perform for
an audience. His screenplay of "The Accidental Tourist" was
nominated for an Academy Award. He also did well by another
set of fringe characters, those inhabiting John Steinbeck's
"The Grapes of Wrath." Mr. Galati won Tony Awards for his
adaptation and direction of the classic Depression novel for
the Steppenwolf Theatre Company here.
   The same director/adaptor and the same ambitious Chicago
company have now combined forces in a lively adaptation of
Ms. Tyler's 1977 novel "Earthly Possessions," in its world
premiere at Steppenwolf's new theater. The story follows the
picaresque journey of Charlotte Emory, a 35-year-old
housewife and mother who decides to abandon her quiet
middle-class life. She goes to the bank to withdraw money for
the journey but is taken hostage by Jake, a bank robber
making his getaway.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It transpires that Charlotte is not at all a stable
middle-class lady, nor is Jake much of a bank robber.
Charlotte's husband is a preacher, whose connection to his
God and the assorted wanderers he shelters in their home is
far more intimate than his connection to her. But Charlotte's
whole life has been disconnected. Although she is only now
getting around to running away, she has wanted to flee ever
since she was a kid, and thought about it even as she
accepted her husband's proposal of marriage. She believes
that she is not the real daughter of her mother. All kids
suspect as much, but Charlotte's suspicion was deeply
reinforced by her grotesquely fat and self-obsessed mother,
who constantly insisted that the hospital switched babies on
her.
   Charlotte's is the narrative voice of the novel. Mr.
Galati had to stage her hostage-taking and cross-country
kidnapping, along with lots of disturbing flashbacks to the
bad old days with Charlotte's mother, father and husband,
while simultaneously presenting her calm and reflective
commentary. His inspired answer was to split the character
between two actresses. It works, largely due to the
convincing and complementary performances of Joan Allen as
Mrs. Emory, the kidnap victim, and Molly Regan as Charlotte,
the sardonic observer.
   The two actresses are both somewhat lanky and angular, but
their power to convince us that they are aspects of the same
character goes beyond physical similarities. They project
similar qualities of fond abstraction. They share an ability
to remain cautious and frightened of life while cerebrally
savoring its memorable moments. Ms. Allen is especially good
and funny as she finds herself caught in a series of bizarre
triangles with her mother and father, then with her mother
and husband, and finally with Jake the bank robber and his
gritty little girlfriend. Mr. Galati's inspiration as adaptor
and director is especially evident during the play's final
scenes, when Ms. Allen walks away from her kidnapper and
helps Ms. Regan on with her robe and into the action. At this
moment, the two women switch. Ms. Regan steps out of her
narrative role and returns to Charlotte's husband. No longer
detached, Charlotte appears to be home for good.
   Jake is only an amateur bank robber. His usual line of
work is driving in demolition derbies, where he is an
indifferent competitor. He has turned to bank robbery as a
more reliable way to raise money for the rescue of his
jailbait girlfriend, Mindy, from a home for wayward girls,
where she has been banished by her mother because she is
pregnant with Jake's child.
   Kevin Anderson plays Jake, a role miles apart from his
portrayal of Julia Roberts's nice guy boyfriend in "Sleeping
With the Enemy." Mr. Anderson is suitably threatening here.
We fear that he may at any time use his gun on Mrs. Emory or
some store clerk who refuses to surrender the Doritos. But we
also like him. Mr. Anderson's Jake is less (and more) than
pure evil. Like Charlotte, Jake is struggling with
relationships. He desperately fights getting tied down by
middle-class life, but feels compelled to help his pregnant
girlfriend get out from under. Jake's punishment is to be
mothered by his hostage and henpecked by his girlfriend.
Anderson's performance gets all of this just about right.
   There is some slight danger that Sally Murphy will be
typed as a pregnant waif, having played the pregnant Rose of
Sharon in Steppenwolf's "Grapes of Wrath," and now Mindy in
"Earthly Possessions." Ms. Murphy gives us the sweet
simplicity of the Southern country girl, but also the
relentless determination of the earth mother entirely free of
the doubts about life that plague Jake and Mrs. Emory. Both
are under her thumb once they liberate her from the home for
pregnant girls.
   Although she is also splendid in her role, let's hope that
Rondi Reed is not typecast as a result. As Charlotte's
gargantuan mother, Ms. Reed has been costumed and made-up to
look like a 300-pounder. Awesome as her physical presence is,
Ms. Reed sensitively conveys how nobody could emotionally
embrace her even if she were slender as a nymph.
   The theme is that you can't escape your earthly
possessions -- not your parentage, not your boring and
distracted husband, not even your ugly and oppressive
belongings. Kevin Rigdon's set symbolizes this with a hideous
pile of furniture, pictures and the other props of
middle-class life. Anybody with sense would want to escape
from it.
   The road is another important physical feature of this
story. Jake and his hostage travel in a series of stolen
cars, munching on Doritos and drinking in roadside taverns.
Mr. Rigdon can't actually take us on the road, but he expands
the envelope of the stage with hundreds of photos of the
actors in realistic settings projected on screens designed by
John Boesche. The photos come and go so fast that they
achieve a movie-like effect. At first it's disconcerting to
look above the actors to another level of action. But as the
play unfolds, the audience settles in and finds the
projections no more distracting than supertitles at the
opera. They are especially apt here because Charlotte is a
second-generation photographer, who took over her father's
studio after his death.
   What's best about Anne Tyler's work is that it
relentlessly focuses on what's most troubling and yet
inevitable in relationships among family members -- their
physical closeness, their emotional isolationbut does so with
a tone of wry fun and ultimate acceptance. Mr. Galati and the
Steppenwolf company have captured much of Ms. Tyler's best in
this production. The production continues through Sept. 8.

   Today is Saturday, April 14, the 104th day of 1990. There are
261 days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On April 14, 1865, President Lincoln was shot and mortally
wounded by John Wilkes Booth while attending the comedy ``Our
American Cousin'' at Ford's Theater in Washington. The president
died the following morning.
   On this date:
   In 1759, George Frideric Handel died in London.
   In 1775, the first American society for the abolition of slavery
was organized by Benjamin Franklin and Benjamin Rush.
   In 1828, the first edition of Noah Webster's ``American
Dictionary of the English Language'' was published.
   In 1902, J.C. Penney opened his first store, in Kemmerer, Wyo.
   In 1912, the supposedly unsinkable RMS Titanic ran into an
iceberg in the North Atlantic and began sinking.
   In 1931, King Alfonso XIII of Spain went into exile, and the
Spanish Republic was proclaimed.
   In 1939, the motion picture ``Wuthering Heights,'' starring
Merle Oberon and Laurence Olivier, premiered in New York.
   In 1939, Viking Press first published the novel ``The Grapes of
Wrath'' by John Steinbeck.
   In 1945, American planes firebombed Tokyo and damaged the
Japanese imperial palace.
   In 1956, Ampex Corporation demonstrated its first commercial
videotape recorder.
   In 1981, the first test flight of America's first operational
space shuttle, the Columbia, ended successfully as the orbiter
landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
   In 1986, Americans got first word of a U.S. air raid on Libya.
Because of the time difference, it was the early morning of April
15th where the attack occurred.
   Ten years ago: ``Kramer vs. Kramer'' won best picture at the
52nd annual Academy Awards. The Pulitzer Prizes were also awarded,
with the Gannett News Service named recipient of the public service
gold medal and ``Talley's Folly,'' a play by Lanford Wilson, chosen
the winner of the drama award.
   Five years ago: Jack C. Burcham became the fifth person to
receive the ``Jarvik Seven'' permanent artificial heart. However,
he died ten days later at Humana Hospital Audubon in Louisville, Ky.
   One year ago: Testimony concluded in the Iran-Contra trial of
former National Security Council staff member Oliver L. North.
   Today's birthdays: Actor Sir John Gielgud is 86. Former network
news executive Richard Salant is 76. Actor Rod Steiger is 65. Actor
Anthony Perkins is 58. Country singer Loretta Lynn is 55. Actress
Julie Christie is 49. Former baseball manager Pete Rose is 49.
   Thought for today: ``Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history.
We of this Congress and this administration will be remembered in
spite of ourselves.'' _ Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865).

DUST BOWL REUNION BRINGS SURVIVORS A FLOOD OF MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES HILLINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LAMONT, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The terrible drought that forced a half-million desperate farmers and their 
families to migrate to California from Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas and Missouri 
in the 1930s was vividly recalled at a Dust Bowl Days reunion here recently. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred people -- including many who lived through the wrenching 
experience, and their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren -- spent 
the day in Lamont Park renewing acquaintances, looking at old photographs, 
exchanging stories. 
</P>
<P>
Atwood Risner, 75, and his wife Vergie, 66, who live in this small farm center 
15 miles southeast of Bakersfield, brought memorabilia of years spent living in 
the Sunset Migrant Labor Camp here. The camp was the scene of John Steinbeck's 
classic 1939 novel "Grapes of Wrath." 
</P>
<P>
Risner came to California with his parents, 17 brothers and sisters from 
Durant, Okla. His wife, one of nine children -- one was born on the way -- came 
from Ada, Okla. The year was 1931. 
</P>
<P>
As a young girl Vergie Risner weighed cotton to help feed her large family. She 
brought to the reunion her old hand-fashioned cotton weigher, the family 
washtub, a quilt her mother made in camp in 1935, a washboard with homemade lye 
soap. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you we had hard times," she recalled. "My father lost his farm in 
Oklahoma when the drought and Depression hit at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"When we arrived in Lamont, Daddy went to work picking cotton for five cents an 
hour. So did my brothers and sisters. Somehow we got by. We didn't starve. We 
made our clothes out of chicken feed sacks." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Smith, 54, a retired California Highway patrolman who lives in 
Bakersfield, came west in 1936 in a dilapidated old car with his mother and 
grandparents from Porum, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
"As a little kid, I didn't know what poor meant. I thought everyone lived in a 
camp and picked cotton," he mused. 
</P>
<P>
All the old tin shacks, tents and other structures erected at the Sunset Camp 
during the 1930s and '40s have long since disappeared. But the site continues 
to this day as a migrant labor camp, with its residents mostly Latino farm 
workers and their families. 
</P>
<P>
The Dust Bowl descendants sat around in the park on lawn chairs. They feasted 
on barbecued tri-tip roast, listened to down-home tunes played by musicians who 
lived in the camps. Mostly, they talked -- for hours. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Judd brought a poem his father, Dick Judd, wrote in Sunset Camp in 1938 
after following the crops that year throughout the Southwest. The last stanza 
read: 
</P>
<P>
 And after the cotton was over, to California we must go 
</P>
<P>
 Where Uncle Sam would feed us, of course, he does you know 
</P>
<P>
 We found the people friendly and ready to lend a hand 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the states we had worked in, by this one we will stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Doris Weddell, 56, Lamont librarian, has been collecting every book, magazine 
and newspaper clipping she can lay her hands on for the Dust Bowl Room in the 
library. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping for a new library with a wing devoted to our Dust Bowl collection 
that will be both library and museum filled with 1930s artifacts," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the reunion was that of Sharon Garrison, 44, a cotton gin 
bookkeeper, and Jim Phillips, 48, a barber, both of Lamont, and both products 
of the Sunset Camp. 
</P>
<P>
Stella White, 72, who came from Oklahoma in 1936, told Claudis Conley, 73, who 
arrived from Auroa, Mo., a year later: "We lived under a walnut tree that first 
summer drawing water from a standpipe." 
</P>
<P>
Then Conley recalled: 
</P>
<P>
"We camped under a tree our first summer, too. We drove out in our Model T. It 
had a big hole in a tire all the way but we still made it." 
</P>
<P>
Sue White, 50, who came to the reunion from Willows in Northern California, 
recalled how other people "considered us dirt, because we lived in tin shacks 
and tents, wore tattered clothes and chopped cotton and picked grapes and sugar 
beets. 
</P>
<P>
"But out of that experience has come judges, doctors, business leaders, land 
owners, the civic and political leaders of the San Joaquin Valley."
