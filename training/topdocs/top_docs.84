<LEADPARA>  PREPARE yourself for what could become the battle of the superstar thrillers.;
   About to go at it hammer-and-tongs -- or rather straight razor to straight
razor -- are 20th Century Fox's "Sleeping With the Enemy" and Orion Pictures'
"The Silence of the Lambs." Both are based on grim suspense novels. Both
concern resourceful heroines (Julia Roberts in "Sleeping," Oscar-winner Jodie
Foster in "Silence"). Both are the handiwork of respected, if offbeat,
Hollywood directors. And both have the makings of cold-sweat classics in the
"Psycho"/"Wait Until Dark" mold.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  MOVIEGOERS WILL BE GIVEN A DOUBLE DOSE OF
SUSPENSE
TWO BIG-NAME THRILLERS GO TOE-TO-TOE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Film  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     More to the point, both are set to open the first half of February.
"Sleeping With the Enemy," based on the Nancy Price book and featuring the
very hot Roberts as a viciously pursued wife, is scheduled for Feb. 8;
"Silence," based on the best-seller by Thomas Harris, arrives six days later
-- on Valentine's Day. The unusual Thursday opening is meant as an advertising
ploy: Instead of the traditional pink bouquet, Orion will be sending us
something in a darker shade -- crimson red, to be exact.;    Predictably,
representatives at both studios are shrugging off the imminent box-office
battle. They say either they're not concerned or that when it comes to
well-tooled thrillers the public can't get its fill. If "Sleeping" is good,
the argument goes, it will make us eager for more clammy suspense and smooth
the way for "Silence.";    Sounds right, but you can still bet that the
respective studios are nervous. Already, they're sending out invitations to
media junkets. 20th Century Fox will unveil the $18-million "Sleeping" in Los
Angeles on Jan. 18; Orion has set its first critics' screenings for Jan. 24 in
Washington, D.C. Why D.C.? Because Foster's character is an intern for the
FBI. (Not above a little subliminal advertising, Fox Television slipped a
reference to a "Sleeping With the Enemy" screening into last Thursday's
episode of "L.A. Law.");    The films appear pretty evenly matched at this
point, though I'd give the edge to "Silence" because it's based on a big
best-seller and has a strong built-in following. From here, you have to weigh
the strengths of the individual talents involved. Foster may have the
best-actress Oscar (for "The Accused"), but she hasn't done much lately, and
"Pretty Woman" Roberts may be the most popular actress on the scene right
now.;    As for the filmmakers, they're both 40ish, have apprenticed on
low-budget action pictures, and are known for their ability to work quirky
spins on familiar material.;    Joseph Ruben was in the director's chair on
"Sleeping." He toiled for years as an exploitation filmmaker ("The Pom-Pom
Girls") before turning heads with "The Stepfather" and the excellent James
Woods vehicle, "True Believer." Jonathan Demme directed "Silence," a sequel to
Harris' "Red Dragon" (filmed in 1986 as "Manhunter"). His credits include
"Stop Making Sense," "Swimming to Cambodia," "Melvin and Howard," "Married to
the Mob" and, most important, "Something Wild." Of the two, Demme is more
seasoned. However, Ruben has, in the last few years, become one of our best
action directors. His prison-cafeteria rub-out at the beginning of "True
Believer" ranks as one of the best action sequences of the '80s.;    As for
the directors themselves, they're predictably high on their respective
movies.;    Demme is excited about going more mainstream, fashioning the kind
of nuts-and-bolts thriller in which Brian ("Dressed to Kill") DePalma once
excelled. "We nailed it!" he almost shouts. "It's a good one. We remained true
to the spirit of the book (about an FBI intern who uses an imprisoned serial
killer to track another killer) but came up with a lot of new twists. . . . It
took a tremendous amount of mental reprogramming for me to go from social
satire to an all-out thriller. That it represents something different is
delightful to me. I was ready for the challenge . . . to be freed from the
discipline of comedy.";    Ruben refers to "Sleeping," which co-stars Patrick
("Mountains of the Moon") Bergin as the deranged husband, as "a simple primal
idea about a woman who has been psychologically and physically kept down by a
very bad man. She tries to escape and he hunts her down.";    When told
"Sleeping" sounded like a number of recent TV movies about systematically
abused wives, Ruben replies, "We don't do naturalistic, kitchen-sink drama.
This is more of a stylized thriller. I'd say 'Hitchcockian,' but that's
pretentious.";    Ruben says he's not worried about the competition from
Orion. "I read half of 'Silence,' just to see what it was about. I'm not
concerned. They're both thrillers, but they're so different. Theirs sounds a
lot more violent. We don't have a lot of physical violence. That was the
challenge for me: To make a scary movie with a scary character who commits
very little physical violence. In 'Stepfather,' I had the villain beat someone
to death with a two-by-four. There's nothing like that here.";    Demme's
trump card? "A very different and realistic villain." Ruben's? His star,
naturally. "All I can say is, we're glad we have Julia Roberts."  </TEXT>

CHANGES: Warren Beatty was supposed to do Rob Reiner's new movie, "Misery," but 
the star and director of the coming "Dick Tracy" has now backed out. He will be 
replaced by James Caan . . . and Kim Basinger was supposed to follow "Batman" 
with a movie for 20th Century Fox, a first independent project there by Leonard 
Goldberg, with screenplay by "Rainman" Oscar winner Ron Bass, to be directed by 
Joe Ruben. However, "Sleeping With The Enemy" is not to be for Kim it now 
seems, and Fox is negotiating with Julia ("Steel Magnolias") Roberts to take 
over the leading role.

THE UNITED NATIONS has often been criticized since its founding in 1945 as not 
being progressive enough, not taking enough stands on issues and, in general, 
being a fairly useless body of delegates. However, something exciting and long 
overdue may be happening soon at the United Nations. Rumor has it that Kenya's 
U.N. ambassador, Michael George Okeyo, is being groomed to take the top spot of 
secretary-general. If this happens, Okeyo would become the first ever black 
head of the world body.

JODIE FOSTER is bringing considerable excitement to the office of Secretary of 
Labor Elizabeth Hanford Dole these days. Not that Dole's office isn't always a 
hotbed of important doings, but having an Oscar-winning actress on the premises 
does goose things up. Jodie is in Washington filming Orion's thriller, "Silence 
of the Lambs," wherein she plays an FBI recruit, tracking down a serial killer. 
Dole's inner sanctum was selected as the set for the office of the director of 
the FBI because of its dramatic, cinematic view overlooking the U.S. Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
This Jonathan Demme film also stars Anthony Hopkins as a psychopath aiding 
Jodie in her search for the killer. And Roger Corman, the veteran film director 
and producer of all those great Vincent Price horror films, will appear in 
"Silence of the Lambs" as the head of the FBI. (A scary thought for sure, 
though not nearly as scary as the director we actually had at the FBI for 
years.)

"LBJ: The White House Years" by Harry Middleton, director of the LBJ Library, 
will be published this spring by Abrams to coincide with a series of gala 
"homecomings" and forums for LBJ intimates to take place in Washington, D.C., 
and Austin, Tex., in April, May and June. The book is a true insider's 
perspective of the LBJ Presidency. The cumulative effect of Middleton's 
incisive text and the hundreds of photographs, by chief presidential 
photographer Yoichi Okamoto, show how the White House functioned during LBJ's 
tumultuous era of war and radical social change. 
</P>
<P>
Middleton's positive approach is in contrast to Robert Caro's coming second 
volume on Johnson also due this spring. Caro takes a far more jaundiced view of 
the controversial President. Lady Bird Johnson's former press secretary, Liz 
Carpenter, says of Middleton, "He knew LBJ intimately, so it's an honest 
portrayal -- on all sides. His book is an insider's view."

which has since been published in a dozen editions around the world.

<TEXT>     The film's success has propelled Thomas Harris' popular 1988 novel to the
No. 1 spot on the paperback best-seller lists. It has whipped up heavy demand
in bookstores for "Red Dragon," the 1981 novel in which Harris first
introduced the brilliant Lecter. And it has sent people to video outlets in
search of "Manhunter," the film adaptation of "Red Dragon.";    "Lecter is one
of the great unique and intriguing villains," says George Witte, a St.
Martin's Press editor who helped edit "The Silence of the Lambs." "I think the
fact that he is a psychiatrist is part of the fascination.";    Lecter's
insights into character make "The Silence of the Lambs" a psychological as
well as a suspense thriller. In agreeing to help FBI trainee Clarice Starling
(Jodie Foster) track down another serial killer, the imprisoned Lecter exacts
his own psychological toll from the young agent.;    Don't look to Harris for
any clues about Lecter's appeal. A former Associated Press reporter who
covered crime in New York City, Harris declines to give interviews.;    It is
common for a new movie to increase book sales ("Lambs" displaced Michael
Blake's "Dances With Wolves" as the top paperback on Publisher's Weekly's
March 1 list). But what is more unusual is for readers and movie-lovers to be
so intrigued by a character that they seek out earlier appearances.;   
"People come in and ask, 'What's that movie with Dr. Hannibal Lecter?' " says
Joel Jacobson, owner of Cinema Concepts, a video store in Newington, Conn.;   
It's "Manhunter," the critically admired but little-seen 1986 film directed by
Michael Mann, best known for the visual style he brought to "Miami Vice." Like
the hit TV series, "Manhunter" is awash in vibrant blues and whites. Lecter
(his name is spelled Dr. Lektor in "Manhunter") is imprisoned in a blindingly
white cell, a stark contrast to the dungeon he inhabits in Jonathan Demme's
dark "The Silence of the Lambs.";    While important, Lecter's role is less
pivotal in "Manhunter." As portrayed by Brian Cox (who looks eerily like
Hopkins, with his severely slicked-back hair), Lecter is clever and witty but
neither as menacing nor mesmerizing as Hopkins.;    We know Cox's Lecter has
committed unspeakable murders, because Will Graham, the FBI agent who caught
him, was rewarded with a nervous breakdown. Now Graham (William L. Petersen)
has agreed to take on one more case and catch one more sicko. Graham visits
Lecter in his cell to recapture the serial-killer "mind-set," and it almost
catapults him over the edge again.;    The plot of "Manhunter" resembles that
of "The Silence of the Lambs," but it is a more terrifying film. The serial
killer (played by Tom Noonan) is a monstrous-looking creep who butchers entire
families. In one scene, director Mann soaks the victims' white bedroom in
sweeping splashes of blood. And Petersen's intense FBI agent always seems on
the precipice of disintegration.;    Will we see Lecter again?;    Harris is
at work on a new novel for Delacorte Press, which is silent on the question of
whether the wily psychiatrist will return. (box)  </TEXT>

<MEMO>  Additional information attached to the end of this article.
Cover Story  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The source for "Silence," of course, is the 1988 Thomas Harrisbest seller.
Harris' "Red Dragon," filmed as "Manhunter," introduced us to the monstrous
genius of psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter, a.k.a. Hannibal the Cannibal.
"Silence," published seven years later, tells of the further misdeeds of Dr.
Lecter, who from his dungeon-like cell works -- or rather, pretends to work --
in tandem with FBI student Clarice Starling.;    Harris' thrillers are like
three-ring circuses. There's plenty to hold your attention, but it's sometimes
hard to figure out who's stalking whom.;    Michael Mann, in adapting "Red
Dragon," realized this; he streamlined the complicated narrative. Jonathan
Demme, best known for "Melvin and Howard" and "Something Wild," has taken a
different tack in filming "Silence." He has shoehorned all the characters and
plot twists of the book into two hours of screen time.;    The results are at
once laudable and maddening. Fans of the book, looking for an added jolt or
two as Demme and screenwriter Ted Tally stray from -- or, indeed, improve upon
-- Harris' sinister narrative, are in for a letdown. "Silence" the movie is
slavishly faithful, and this means anyone familiar with the book will always
be several giant steps ahead of heroine Starling.;    Those unfamiliar with
the novel will face other problems, the worst being a narrative that's far too
densely plotted.;    As in the book, FBI intern Starling is pressed into
service by the top man in Behavioral Science, special agent Jack Crawford
(Scott Glenn). Starling is sent to use her charm on Dr. Lecter, still the star
attraction at Baltimore's Hospital for the Criminally Insane. It's while
sparring with the wily Lecter that Starling learns of a connection between
Lecter and the currently at large "Buffalo Bill," who kidnaps young women and
then partially flays them.;    But there's little time for such cat-and-mouse
stuff. Bill has hit again, kidnapping the daughter of a Tennessee senator.
Suddenly the authorities are more than happy to placate Lecter, whom they
truss up like the Man in the Iron Mask and transport to Memphis to meet with
the girl's frantic mother (Diane Baker of "Marnie" in a rare screen
appearance).;    It's during this Memphis sojourn that Starling and her
superiors discover that Lecter, even under lock and key, is more dangerous
than the maniac he's supposedly helping track.;    Demme, who began his career
cranking out exploitation quickies like "Caged Heat," is no stranger to the
junk-thriller racket. Which is probably why we expected "Silence" to be more
of a sheer ride. As these things go, this one is almost polite in manner.
Obviously after a more mainstream audience, Demme leaves a lot to the
imagination. No quibble here. But apart from Lecter's ghastly Memphis
masquerade, the fright factor isn't nearly what it should be, considering the
source material. (The loudest audience reaction at a preview? A dry laugh --
in response to Starling's stammered "FBI -- you're safe now.");    Also, Demme
has favored the antagonistic student-teacher relationship between Starling and
Lecter at the expense of the Jame Gumb/Buffalo Bill character, a classic
mama's boy-gone-bad in the book. In the hands of actor Ted Levine, Gumb is
reduced to the kind of crazed transvestite Hollywood once blamed for all
unspeakable acts. Worse, Gumb/Bill is as much a cipher at the end as when we
first meet him.;    Foster, who won an Oscar as the rape victim in "The
Accused," gives a game and anything-but-glamorous performance. Her Starling is
a woman determined to succeed in a male-dominated profession, and Foster goes
considerably beyond Jamie Lee Curtis' rookie in "Blue Steel" to give us a
tough, terse portrayal of the eager-beaver student who jettisoned, long ago,
all extraneous feminine baggage.;    Though none of his character's dark
history remains, Scott Glenn turns FBI boss Crawford into a fascinating mix of
bureaucrat and proud father figure. Anthony Heald, as the taunting hospital
director anxious to cash in on his prize psycho, is even better. In fact,
Heald's jailer is the real villain of the piece. Hopkins capitulates that role
with a performance that's too showy to be terrifying. All glowering smiles and
bug-eyed retorts, he appears to be trying out for a silent version of "Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.";    The best thing about "Silence" is the production
design by Kristi Zea ("GoodFellas"). Zea -- with a major assist from
cinematographer Tak Fujimoto -- has done a brilliant job of realizing Harris'
grimmer-than-grim charnel houses and dungeons. Take your choice -- Lecter's
subterranean lair, the Memphis court-house cage or Bill's basement pit. Each
is creepy beyond words.;    If only we could say as much for the entire
production. "Silence" cried out to be a nuts-and-bolts chiller, the kind of
grisly handiwork in which Tobe ("Texas Chainsaw Massacre") Hooper once
specialized. Demme and company might also have learned from Mann, who, for
"Manhunter," shrewdly went with a no-name cast and tawdry TV look. As a costly
star vehicle, "Silence" was muzzled from the start. It could only be so
outrageous, so shocking. Too bad. We were in the mood for a bona fide
throat-clutcher.;     The Silence of the Lambs; (star)(star) 1/2; Rated: R

<TEXT>     "The Silence of the Lambs," featuring Jodie Foster as an FBI trainee
pursuing a psychotic killer, claimed the top spot for the fourth straight week
on ticket sales of $8.9 million, according to Entertainment Data Inc.;    The
opening of "New Jack City," a gritty look at a drug lord and the police
officers laboring to bring him down, was marred by a variety of altercations,
disturbances and a fatal shooting in Brooklyn. The film stars Wesley Snipes,
Judd Nelson, rap star Ice-T and Mario Van Peebles, who also directed.;    In
third place was another new movie, "The Hard Way." Starring Michael J. Fox as
an obnoxious actor who wants to pattern a new role after a hard-as-nails cop
(James Woods), "The Hard Way" grossed $6.3 million in its premiere weekend.;  
 "Sleeping With the Enemy," a drama with Julia Roberts as a battered wife,
took fourth with a gate of $6.1 million.;    After just one week, movie-goers
appeared to be extinguishing the fire of the rock movie "The Doors." The $40
million movie plunged 34 percent despite appearing on 364 more screens than a
week ago. It took fifth place with $6 million.;    In sixth was Kevin
Costner's "Dances With Wolves," which grossed $3.4 million. It was followed in
seventh by "Home Alone." The comedy made $3.3 million and is now the sixth
biggest-grossing film ever, with receipts of $245.9 million to date.;    The
family drama "Shipwrecked" was eighth, on proceeds of $3.04 million, and "King
Ralph," starring John Goodman, was ninth, with sales of $2.97 million. In 10th
was Steve Martin's "L.A. Story," which made $1.6 million.;    In limited
release, the new French thriller "La Femme Nikita" played very well in two
theaters in New York, while "Closetland," a movie focusing on torture, was a

<LEADPARA>  WHEN Jodie Foster was a little girl, appearing in films such as "Napoleon and
Samantha" and on sitcoms such as "The Courtship of Eddie's Father," she would
tell people that she wanted to be "a talker" when she grew up.;   "When I was
a kid, I really enjoyed journalists and I was an incessant talker," she
recalls. "It was always like this big high for me to get to actually talk to
people about what I did."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  THE FOSTER CHILD
THE GROWN-UP CHILD ACTRESS TURNS DIRECTOR  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Film; See also related article on page 16 of this section.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Foster, now a poised and self-assured adult, still enjoys speaking publicly
about her work, and even admits to fantasizing on occasion about becoming a TV
talk-show host. She seemed well-suited to that calling as she deftly fielded
questions from reporters at the 16th annual Festival of Festivals recently.;  
The 28-year-old actress was in Toronto to attend the film festival, where her
latest movie made its Canadian debut. With "Little Man Tate" (which opened
locally Friday), Foster has achieved another childhood ambition: to direct a
movie. It's something she has wanted to do since she was about 10 and first
"knew that the power on the movie was the director.";   The boy genius; A
contemporary comedy-drama about growing up, "Little Man Tate" is the story of
a 7-year-old prodigy named Fred Tate (played by newcomer Adam Hann-Byrd), his
down-to-earth mother (Foster) and a brilliant psychologist (Dianne Wiest).
Foster, who was something of a precocious child herself, admitted that the
film contains "autobiographical references" but quickly added that it is "not
autobiographical" in the strict sense.;   For Foster, one of the perks of
making "Little Man Tate" was working with Adam and the other children in the
film, which she loved because of the "purity" of their motives as actors.;  
"You can't bribe them with more money or something," she said. "If they don't
want to throw the spaghetti, they just don't throw it. There's something
absolutely beautiful about that.";   In her unmistakable, subtly husky voice,
Foster explained that she picked Adam (a bright New Yorker, but not an
official genius) because of the steely concentration he displayed in an
audition.;   "There were, like, ambulances, and people making noises in
another room, and somebody dropped something, and somebody walked in, and not
once did he ever waver at all," she said. "He just continued to read his page.
There's something about that kind of concentration span which is, I think,
ultimately what acting is about.";   Foster said the primary draw of the
script (by Scott Frank, who wrote the first draft while a college student),
however, was its broader message about the struggle of growing up different
from others.;   "It takes time to be an unconventional person in a
terrifically conventional world," she reflected, looking deceptively
conformist in her gray slacks and chic purple blazer. "It takes a lot of work
to figure out how to put yourself apart and say, 'I will be different, but I
will be healthy.' ";   Although Foster fiercely guards her private life now,
her uniquely different and presumably healthy early years are an open book
that most moviegoers have read at least part of.;   Youngest of four children,
the Los Angeles-born Foster was raised by her divorced mother, Evelyn "Brandy"
Foster, and has seen her father only a few times. In the early days, Brandy
often jokingly referred to her daughter as an "immaculate conception" -- words
Fred's mother uses about him in "Little Man Tate.";   The baby star;   At age
3, Foster got her start in show business by appearing in television
commercials as the pigtailed Coppertone Girl. Commercials led to sitcoms,
which in turn led to roles in such films as "Bugsy Malone," "Alice Doesn't
Live Here Anymore" and "The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane.";   Hollywood
began to take her seriously after her unforgettable performance as a
12-year-old hooker in "Taxi Driver," for which she snagged an Oscar
nomination.;   As she headed for college in 1980, Foster seemed, for the first
time, to be on the threshold of leading a relatively "normal" life. But after
John Hinckley shot President Reagan in a twisted attempt to impress her,
normalcy was no longer possible.;   "It's funny to be someone everyone has an
opinion about," Foster once told the New York Times. And for a while, her
dubious renown as Hinckley's "inspiration" overshadowed her hard-won fame as
an actress.;   "The Accused" changed that. After graduating from Yale -- where
she studied African-American culture and appeared in a play for the first and
only time ("a mixed experience") -- she won an Oscar for portraying a rape
victim in the 1988 movie. She followed up that triumph with this year's "The
Silence of the Lambs," a certifiable hit in which she starred as intrepid FBI
trainee Clarice Starling.;   The way "Silence" director Jonathan Demme tells
it, Foster practically directed herself in that picture. "At first, it sort of
surprised me how much I liked what she came up with," Demme told a reporter
for Premiere magazine during filming.;   It was, you might say, only a matter
of time before Foster would realize her directorial ambitions.;   "I've always
tried to do exactly what I've wanted to do in terms of my career," she said.
"What's great about film making is that if you are an arrogant person like
myself -- or an ego-driven person like myself, and I don't say that in a
pejorative way -- you just forge ahead. So much of it is about confidence.";  
Foster does sound sure of herself as she speaks about her plans to take on
future acting, directing and producing projects.;   She has already filmed --
and soon will be seen briefly in -- Woody Allen's upcoming "Shadows and Fog."
She also sounds charged up about a sequel to "The Silence of the Lambs," when
and if it is made. As for "Little Man Tate," it went into general release on
Oct. 9.;   Perhaps the most unusual thing about the unusual production is that
the director -- rather than an executive of the studio, Orion Pictures -- was
the one to insist it end on an upbeat note.;   "I'll tell you one thing, I'm
probably the only director in the world that actually had to fight for a happy
ending," she said wryly. "Nobody else was as convinced that Fred could have a
happy life as I (was). . . . I didn't want the movie to end, 'Well, if you're
smart you'll have a rotten life, but at least you'll have your mom.' ";  
Foster sees more than one path to happiness -- which she thinks of as an
elusive state, in any case.;   "I don't think happiness is something you just
kind of deserve," she says authoritatively. "I think you have to work for it."

HOLLYWOOD'S OSCAR GOLD RUSH  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Movies  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Charity begins;   Why have Robin Williams, Jodie Foster and Kevin Costner
suddenly decided to attend a charity lunch next week sponsored by the
Hollywood Women's Press Club?;   The answer is Academy Award fever, which is
rapidly enveloping Hollywood.;   Fully aware that awards for best picture gave
an extraordinary box-office lift to "Driving Miss Daisy," "Rain Man" and "The
Last Emperor," studios are throwing parties to introduce potential nominees,
holding screenings all over town and spending hundreds of thousands of dollars
for advertisements in Daily Variety and the Hollywood Reporter.;   Spotting
the trends;   The 64th annual Academy Awards ceremony will take place on March
30. Nominations will be announced on Feb. 19. But early trends will be obvious
in a couple of weeks. The Los Angeles Film Critics awards will be announced on
Dec. 14, followed by the New York Film Critics awards three days later.;  
Several factors make this year's awards especially unpredictable. The first is
that the number of quality films released in 1991 has been minimal.;   Another
is that a few potential contenders are opening late. Among them are Barbra
Streisand's "Prince of Tides," based on the Pat Conroy novel; the Kasdan drama
"Grand Canyon"; "J.F.K.," about the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy; Steven Spielberg's "Hook" and Barry Levinson's "Bugsy." (One dark
horse, Steven Soderbergh's "Kafka," starring Jeremy Irons, will open in New
York and Los Angeles for one week starting today to qualify for the Academy
Awards, then re-open around the country in January.);   Yet another factor is
the possibility that the Walt Disney Co.'s highly praised "Beauty and the
Beast" may be the first animated film ever nominated.;   "With the exception
of 'The Silence of the Lambs,' Academy-type movies have only begun appearing
now, late in the year, so the most interesting development is the groundswell
already starting for 'Beauty and the Beast,' " said Laurence Mark, the
executive producer of "Working Girl" and a former executive vice president for
production at 20th Century Fox.;   Film executives have already begun drawing
up confidential lists of contenders in numerous categories, replete with long
shots. Several films dominate the lists, including "The Fisher King," "Boyz N
the Hood," "Little Man Tate" and "Thelma &amp; Louise.";   By all accounts, the
most un-predictable elements of the Academy Awards are both the critical and
the box-office responses to various movies.;   "For the Boys," for example,
stars Bette Midler, a favorite in the film colony who was initially seen as a
strong candidate for best actress for her portrayal of a USO entertainer. But
the movie has proven to be a box-office disappointment so far, which could
diminish Midler's prospects.;   East Coast reviews for Martin Scorsese's "Cape
Fear," a melodrama starring Robert De Niro as a psychotic ex-convict, were
dazzling, enhancing the film's prospects for an Oscar nomination.;   But the
Los Angeles Times deplored the film's violence and "unapologetic bludgeoning
of our sensibilities." At a screening for members of the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences, a smattering of applause and then hisses greeted
the movie's end.;   And a recent review in the New Yorker, which called the
film "a disgrace," may further damage its chances.;   But one prominent film
executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity and said he was appalled by the
film's violence, said Scorsese would probably be nominated for best director.;
  "It was a director's show," he said of "Cape Fear," "with all kinds of
pyrotechnics. And Marty will get nominated because he could direct the yellow

   Film: Weirdo Killer Shrink Meets the G-Girl

<LP>
   Dr. Hannibal Lector, the villain-hero of "The Silence of
the Lambs," is most monstrous -- most terrifying -- when he's
most civil. He is kept in a glass cage because he has dined
on human tongues and livers. Clearly this is a gruesome guy.
But he is most shocking when his behavior doesn't conform to
whatever suits your worst fantasy of depravity. He is most
horrifying when he's polite.
   Hannibal Lector, this bloody killer, can be dismissed when
he's a monster. He's not so easy to dismiss when he's someone
not very different from you. Coming from his mouth, a casual
compliment -- "Love your suit" -- becomes something vile.
You'd want to burn the suit just because he liked it, because
he used your clothes, your taste to link you with him, a
psychopath. But even after you'd burned the suit you wouldn't
forget. From then on, anyone who told you your hair was nice,
your scarf was lovely, that person would be suspect.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Jonathan Demme's film version of the Thomas Harris novel
leaves you with that thought -- anyone has killer potential
-- and that is its brilliance. If Lector personifies one's
worst fear, then Mr. Demme has found the ultimate Lector in
the person of Anthony Hopkins. Sly and urbane, Mr. Hopkins is
utterly credible as this psychiatrist genius and informed
snob, who is also a cannibalistic murderer. Lector knows the
difference between good wine and swill, and can spot cheap
shoes in an instant. Mr. Hopkins has a way of making his own
intelligence seem nasty as he creates this nightmare: The
shrink who sees into your soul and uses what he finds to lure
you.
   Lector isn't an ordinary murderer and he isn't used in an
ordinary way in this mesmerizing story about an FBI agent's
hunt for a serial killer. Lector becomes an FBI adviser in
more ways than one. The FBI, which is trying to track down
another serial killer, sends a young agent -- a smart,
attractive woman -- to Lector's cell to see if she can elicit
some clues from him. Lector immediately tries to turn the
meeting into a different kind of session. He tries to
psychoanalyze her.
   The movie is propelled by the G-girl's efforts to stop the
killer before he kills again -- he's kidnapped his next
victim. Working with his usual collaborators, including
cinematographer Tak Fujimoto and editor Craig McKay, Mr.
Demme uses the story as an excuse for yet another of his
odysseys into bizarre corners of America. Though "Silence of
the Lambs" is a crisp, taut thriller, it also is the story of
people looking for something in very strange places.
   Jodie Foster plays Clarice Starling, the sturdy FBI
trainee with the name of a romance-novel heroine. She's
chosen for the assignment because she's smart and tough --
and because she's pretty and might appeal to Lector, who has
been holed up in the sub-basement of a hospital for the
criminally insane for eight years.
   Mr. Demme uses Ms. Foster's femaleness in an interesting
way. The film opens, to suitably scary music, with her
jogging through the woods. She could be a victim. Then you
see her climbing and swinging across an obstacle course. She
seems to be in some sort of training. Soon it's made clear
that she's training to become an FBI agent. Just when you
might start thinking of her as some kind of superwoman, she
steps into an elevator and some large men follow. She's a
small figure in gray; they're behemoths in red.
   All of this happens very quickly but to make a point.
Starling is an attractive woman of unexceptional size doing
what used to be thought of as a man's job and that's an
inescapable fact. Sometimes it's explicit -- as when the
nerdiest researcher immediately asks her for a date -- and
sometimes it isn't. But there's an extra layer of implied
sexuality in every move she makes -- even taking her
assignment from her blandly spooky boss, played by Scott
Glenn.
   Ms. Foster makes Starling seem wonderfully clear. She's
aware of the affect she has on men and uses it to her
advantage without flirting, or deviating from her purpose.
There are implications that she's motivated by the early
death of her policeman father. But she's allowed to be
steady. If her bravery and single-mindedness are
manifestations of neurosis, she's permitted not to appear
neurotic. She is a rare heroine, a woman who goes about her
work the way men do in movies, without seeming less a woman.
   Mr. Demme never cheapens Starling by making her cute or
weird. He understands that as our guide into this sinister
world, she has to be steady. That doesn't mean that Mr. Demme
has abandoned his affection for eccentrics and oddballs. The
director learned his trade from B-movie master Roger Corman
-- who plays a bit part in "Lambs." Mr. Demme skillfully uses
what he learned from Mr. Corman about horror grotesques
without injecting a campy feel into this film. Starling meets
Lector in the lower depths of a creepy brick asylum. But
there's a twist in this descent into hell. She walks through
a dark corridor, trying not to stare at the psycho-killers
huddled in their conventional cells. Lector, however, seems
like a space-age killer. His cell is brightly lit and
separated from the rest by thick glass. He's like a lab
specimen.
   Mr. Demme has populated this journey into the heart's
darkness with the kind of eccentrics who have attracted him
before, in "Something Wild," in "Melvin and Howard," in
"Married to the Mob." Anthony Heald is particularly creepy as
the asylum chief who's locked in a weird struggle with
Lector; one senses the prison psychiatrist hates his
celebrated patient not so much because he's a murderer but
because he's so much smarter. Brooke Smith is refreshingly
spunky as the chubby young woman the serial killer on the
loose has picked to hit next. And the entomologists are
perfect.
   ---
   VIDEO TIP: Mr. Demme's films are so inventive that one of
his earlier films, "Last Embrace," is interesting primarily
because it's so perfectly derivative of Hitchcock. In that
film, which starred Roy Scheider as a hunted man, Mr. Demme
solemnly "paid homage to" "Vertigo," "The Birds," "North by
Northwest," "Psycho," and possibly others.

office spot with weekend sales of $10.5 million, nearly double the take of
second place "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II.";    It was the best opening

<LEADPARA>  'Bugsy," the story of the flamboyant mobster Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel, who
dazzled Hollywood in the '40s and was instrumental in creating the Las Vegas
Strip, was voted best picture of the year by the Los Angeles Film Critics
Association Saturday.;   In the first of the major awards by film critics to
be presented for the year's movies, the Los Angeles group also honored "Bugsy"
with two other awards, Barry Levinson for his direction and James Toback for
his screenplay. The movie, distributed by TriStar Pictures, co-stars Warren
Beatty in the title role and Annette Bening.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Movies  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     A slight surprise;   The choice for best picture was seen by some as a
minor surprise. According to one member of the Los Angeles critics'
association, who did not wish to be identified, "Bugsy" was "the one major
studio well-crafted entertainment that most critics could agree upon as being
good. A lot of the other films that would be contenders have something in them
that are objectionable to some of the critics.";   Among the other films
discussed for best picture were "The Fisher King," "Beauty and the Beast"
(which was cited as best animated film) and "Grand Canyon," a new film by
Lawrence Kasdan that opens Dec. 25.;   Nick Nolte, as the deeply troubled
central character in "The Prince of Tides," was selected as best actor. The
film, with Barbra Streisand co-producing, co-starring and directing, opens
Dec. 25. Runner-up in the category was Beatty for "Bugsy.";   Ruehl named best
actress;   Mercedes Ruehl was named best actress for her performance in "The
Fisher King," as the lover to Jeff Bridges, who comforts him when he is down
and then is cast aside when he rebounds. (She won the Tony award earlier this
year for her Broadway performance in Neil Simon's "Lost in Yonkers.")
Runner-up in the category was Geena Davis, who has a larger role in terms of
on-screen time, as one of the two renegades in "Thelma &amp; Louise.";   The win
by "Bugsy" was shadowed in several categories by "The Fisher King," another
movie released by TriStar. "Fisher King" was runner-up in the best film
category, as well as for direction (Terry Gilliam), screenplay (Richard
LaGravenese) and supporting actress (Amanda Plummer).;   The critics' awards
often give mixed signals as to how the voting may go for the industry's
Academy Awards, to be presented March 30. (The nominations will be announced
Feb. 19) On Tuesday, the New York film critics will vote, and on Jan. 5, the
National Society of Film Critics will make its choices.;   Last year, Martin
Scorcese's "GoodFellas" was the choice of the three critics' groups and, while
"GoodFellas" eventually received six Oscar nominations, it was "Dances With
Wolves" that took home the top Oscars.;   The choice of Ruehl for best
actress, which many observers had considered a supporting actress role because
of its size, was considered another surprise. Another eye-opener was the
shutout of Anthony Hopkins, who is widely regarded as a contender for best
actor for his role in "The Silence of the Lambs.";   The list of winners and
runners-up:;   Picture: "Bugsy." Runner-up: "The Fisher King.";   Animated

   Orion Pictures has scheduled the release of
Jonathan Demme's new thriller, ``The Silence of the Lambs,'' for
Feb. 14, 1991.
   Though debuting on Valentine's Day, the film is by no means a
romance. Based on the shocking best-selling novel by Thomas Harris,
``The Silence of the Lambs'' stars Academy Award-winner Jodie
Foster as Clarice Starling, a gutsy FBI trainee haunted by her
past, who risks her life in an attempt to save a missing woman from
death.
   ``The Silence of the Lambs'' co-stars Anthony Hopkins, Scott
Glenn, Jack Crawford and Dianne Baker.

  ENGLAND (AP) - Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio will portray Maid
Marian, and Alan Rickman will play the Sheriff of Nottingham in
Morgan Creek's ``Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,'' which stars Kevin
Costner in the title role.
   The Warner Bros. release, currently shooting for 13 weeks in
England and France, is set for release next year.
   The production is currently shooting deep in the ancient forests
of Central England, where Robin Hood's legendary Sherwood Forest
has been re-created.
   In December, the production will travel to the ancient walled
city of Carcassone, France, to authentically depict the medieval
city of Nottingham.
   This adaptation of the classic tale of the swashbuckling hero of
Nottingham Forest also stars Morgan Freeman and Christian Slater.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Cameron Mackintosh's hit London musical ``Miss
Saigon,'' will open on Broadway in March 1991 at the Broadway
Theater, where another Mackintosh hit, ``Les Miserables,'' is
currently in its fourth year.
   ``Les Miserables'' will move to another Shubert theater late in
1990 to make way for the arrival of ``Miss Saigon.''
   ``Miss Saigon'' tells a tragic story of love and self-sacrifice
involving a young Vietnamese girl and an American soldier at the
time of the fall of Saigon in 1975.
   ``Miss Saigon'' had its world premiere in September 1989 at the
Theater Royal, Drury Lane, opening with the largest advance sale in
the history of the West End.

<LEADPARA>  REPORTS that Jessica Tandy is undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer are
drawing denials from the 81-year-old actress' reps (who say "she's perfectly
fine") -- and from NBC and producers Jordan Kerner and Jon Avnet. Tandy is set
to start production of the network's "The Story Lady" next month. In June, the
esteemed performer is scheduled to begin work on the Avnet-Kerner film of
"Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe." "We've done readings with her
already and she's glorious," Kerner says. "That (her illness) happened a long

<TEXT>  From Liz Smith in New York; COMEBACK CLUE: Director Billy Wilder made his last
movie, "Buddy, Buddy," in 1981. But he reveals that one of his favorites, "The
Private Life of Sherlock Holmes," will be revived in the current "Spartacus"
and "Lawrence of Arabia" fashion.;    In 1970, Wilder directed Robert
Stephens, Colin Blakely, Genevieve Page, Christopher Lee and Stanley Holloway
in this movie made in England. Though little seen, it became a classic. Some
critics called it "Great!" saying it was "the least embittered and by far
Wilder's most moving film.";    "Sherlock Holmes," made for
UA/Phalanx-Mirisch, was meant to run three delicious hours. Naturally, it was
cut to something more "manageable" for its 1970 release. Now Wilder, a
multi-Oscar winner, promises it will be restored, re-edited and rereleased in
all its original glory.;    BOX-OFFICE NOISE: Orion execs, who have had their
headaches of late, are ecstatic over the grosses that have made "The Silence
of the Lambs" the first 1991 release to hit the $100 million mark. Now they
are jumping up and down over Jodie Foster's new one, "Little Man Tate," in
which she stars and directs -- it has already been touted as an Academy Award
contender.;    That could prove to be an embarrassment of riches for Orion and
Foster come next March. Oscar in 1992 will definitely consider both Foster and
her "Lambs" co-star, Anthony Hopkins, as nominees. His portrayal of Hannibal
Lecter is bound to be in the running.;    AUDREY'S AURA: Lincoln Center and
its denizens seemed absolutely transformed by the mere presence of Audrey
Hepburn as the Film Society honored her the other night in New York. No one --
not even Elizabeth Taylor or Bette Davis -- managed to pack them in the way
Hepburn did.;    It was SRO from the word go. Wilder, Stanley Donen, Harry
Belafonte, Tony Perkins, Alan Arkin, Gregory Peck and Ralph Lauren saluted
Hepburn from the stage. Arkin said to the audience: "Even my own family has
never forgiven me for tormenting Audrey in 'Wait Until Dark.' "; HERE TODAY:
The "Today" show wanted its West Coast medical expert, Dr. Art Ulene, to move
to New York. He didn't want to, and the show is now seeking a woman to replace
him.; From Marilyn Beck and Stacy Jenel Smith in Hollywood;    UNSETTLING
ISSUE: After nearly seven years, there is still no end in sight to the legal
war between James Mason's widow, Clarissa Kaye, and Mason offspring Morgan and
Portland. Not only does the estate remain unsettled, but the children of the
actor (who died in July 1984 in Switzerland) have reportedly yet to convince
their stepmother to disclose the whereabouts and disposition of their father's
remains.;    "It's a nightmare," says the 35-year-old Morgan, a Hollywood film
producer ("sex, lies and videotapes").  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  MOVIE; PSYCHOLOGY  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  THE perversely twisted mind has always been a favorite subject of
storytellers. From Iago to Norman Bates, Vladimir Nabokov's Humbert Humbert to
David Lynch's Leland Palmer/Bob, the logic of villainy has been fictionally
explored, on the page, the stage and the screen, over and over.;    Even when
failed by their powers of sheer imagining, writers and actors have drawn
inspiration from grim reality: Jack the Ripper, Lizzie Borden, Gary Gilmore,
Charles Manson -- not to mention Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Richard III.
By now, Saddam Hussein is undoubtedly a twinkle in some wordsmith's eye.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BAD DEEDS SHINE ON SCREEN
POWER OF THE PERVERSE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Film  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Clearly, evil is alluring, and not just to those who would dramatize it.
From mild naughtiness to vicious criminality, the performance of bad deeds is
something the rest of the population evidently wants to know about.;    This
is one way to explain why the psychopath, that personification of remorseless
evildoing, has such an established place in the public consciousness.;    The
most current example of the psychopath in popular narrative art is the one
portrayed by Anthony Hopkins in the new film "The Silence of the Lambs," a
character Hopkins describes, with thoroughly pleasant detachment, as
"horrifyingly insane.";    At dinner recently in a Manhattan bistro, Hopkins,
53, is a regular Joe, more or less, albeit with a British accent, eager enough
to converse but not entirely comfortable dining with a stranger. It might be a
little less comfortable for a stranger who has just seen "The Silence of the
Lambs," because in it, Hopkins' character, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, is a man who
makes his favorite meals of human flesh and blood.;    The film, which opened
on Valentine's Day, is an adaptation of the page-turning chiller by Thomas
Harris about the psychopathic Lecter -- "Hannibal the Cannibal," as he's known
in the tabloid press -- a brilliant psychiatrist who has long been imprisoned
for a series of grisly murders and whose insight is solicited by the FBI to
help in apprehending a depraved serial killer still on the loose.;    Directed
by Jonathan Demme, the film stars Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, the young
FBI agent sent to question Lecter in his maximum security cell and who, in the
course of tracking down the new killer, ends up forming an unsettling,
mind-bending bond with the old one.;    Though Lecter is a supporting role and
the story unfolds from Starling's point of view, his personality is the source
of the film's terror. Intellectually powerful, culturally refined, innately
curious and possessed of exquisite manners, Lecter is an evil genius, the
embodiment of mysterious, inexplicable and unmitigated perversity.;    "We
managed to save one of her eyes," Starling is told about a nurse who got too
close to an untrussed Lecter during a medical exam and had her face literally
eaten.;    Seeing death's messenger;    It is not the sort of role, in other
words, for which an actor can plumb his own life experience. Indeed, Hopkins,
who is not a Method actor, says that as he was reading the script, "the part
came off the page into my brain. I knew the voice. I knew what he looked like.
I don't know why, but the impression was left in me of a kind of dark angel of
death. The most peculiar thing was the name.;    "Lecter. Hannibal Lecter. The
Lecter sound. It started like a kind of clock in my brain. Lecter. And I saw a
black box, like a black clock, something black and shiny, something veneered,
a lacquered black killing machine. He was mechanical. All the onomatopoeic
associations of the name. I put the image together, and when I came over from
London to do it, I'd already decided on the physical nature of it.";    Still,
preparing is not performing, and the Lecter role is precisely the sort that
makes a viewer wonder about the experience of inhabiting such a character. It
seems reasonable to expect that one wouldn't want to live inside such a man
for long, that it might give an actor the creeps -- or worse.;    Dancing with
devils;    Hopkins' visceral response to the suggestion is just the opposite:;
   "It was great fun," he says. "What it is for an actor is a great chance to
play a game, to flirt with something that's so diabolical, knowing it's only a
fiction. During that scene where I was tearing the guy's face off" -- he does
this with his teeth -- "we had a rubber bone, and I had one end and he had the
other. And Jonathan would say, 'Cut,' and I'd say, 'This is a hell of a way to
make a living, isn't it?' ";    If one considers the roll call of murderous
madmen presented in the culture lately -- a slew of recent theatrical films,
for instance, most notably "Misery," the Rob Reiner adaptation of Stephen
King's novel, and the television movies that filled up sweeps week -- it seems
clear that people are more curious than ever about that which most truly
repels them. It's as if the culture is asking collectively, "Just what will
those wackos be up to next?";    "It's unfortunate that, in our society,
killers can become celebrities," wrote Ronald Markman, a forensic psychiatrist
in Los Angeles, in his 1989 book "Alone With the Devil," which recounts his
experiences interviewing murderers. "Our morbid fascination with them is
simple human nature.";    Markman contends that the appeal of the psychopath
is actually a form of identification. "There is something inside them that is
also inside us," he wrote, "and we are attracted to them so we can find out
what that something is.";    The accepted clinical definition of a psychopath,
or sociopath (the terms are interchangeable), has to do with an absence of
superego, that part of the mind that governs self-criticism and enforces moral
standards.;    A psychopath, in other words, is someone without a conscience.
In a recent telephone interview, Markman explained further:;    "The
psychopathic individual is psychologically an infant in an adult body. An
infant does what he wants to do when he wants to do it. The internal policeman
develops ordinarily between 2 and 7. In some people it never develops. In
some, it is deficient.;    "The psychopath, basically, is an individual who
functions at the level of providing pleasure for himself at the expense of
others around him. He doesn't care about the consequence of treating people as
objects.";    And why would other people identify with someone like this? "We
were born that way, without any superego." And what about acting? Is it
possible to pretend convincingly? "Anyone can play the part," Markman said.
"We're all psychopaths under the skin." (box)  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  A SERIES of new films starring prestigious artists has been placed in virtual
cold storage because Orion Pictures, which made them, faces severe financial
difficulties.;   Film executives close to Orion, a small studio with a record
of critically acclaimed movies, said that the decision to keep the movies on
the shelf was especially painful because several of them, and their stars, are
believed to have Academy Award potential. The films must be released in the
next two months to be considered for Oscar nominations.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  ORION'S MONEY TROUBLES MAY TAKE BIG NAMES OUT OF
OSCAR RACE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Movies  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Luminous names;   Among the stars are Michelle Pfeiffer, Beau Bridges,
Cybill Shepherd, Woody Allen, Jodie Foster and Madonna. Orion executives say
that several of the films are especially strong, including "Love Field," with
Pfeiffer and Dennis Haysbert, about a white woman and black man who meet
unexpectedly in Dallas on the day JFK is assassinated. The drama's director,
Jonathan Kaplan, also directed "The Accused," which won an Academy Award for
Foster.;   Another film, "Article 99," about the bureaucratic chaos at a
Veterans Administration hospital, has also stirred heavy interest at the
studio and among film makers who have seen it. Its stars include Ray Liotta,
Kiefer Sutherland, John Mahoney and Kathy Baker.;   Woody Allen, who made
"Annie Hall" and most of his other films at Orion, has completed what is
described by one Orion executive as a "philosophical comedy" set in the 1920s.
"Shadows and Fog" has a typically Allenesque cast, including Kathy Bates, Mia
Farrow, Foster, Madonna and Lily Tomlin.;   Because of Orion's inability to
finance Allen's next movie, he signed a deal with Tristar Pictures. At Orion,
Allen had almost total control over the production and editing of his films,
an unusual measure of creative freedom in Hollywood but not especially unusual
at Orion, which has been extraordinarily popular among film makers because --
unlike the major studios -- it has given them substantial independence.;  
Midge Sanford, producer of "Love Field" with partner Sarah Pillsbury, said:
"They're a wonderful company to work with. When they decide to do a movie,
they basically say, yes, let the film maker do it. They watch the budget but
aren't intrusive, and . . . that's welcome.";   The Sanford-Pillsbury team,
which now works out of the 20th Century Fox studios, made two other films at
Orion, "Desperately Seeking Susan" and "Eight Men Out." Sanford said other
studios would not have made those movies. "We have material that's often
offbeat or not obviously commercial," she said. "Orion takes risks.;   "It is
frustrating when a movie like 'Love Field' is ready to be released and it's
not released for reasons out of your control." Several months ago, Sanford
said, she was told the film might be released in February 1992.;   A
'welcoming place';   "It is Oscar caliber," she added. "A wonderful script. If
Orion is able to get its finances together, we would definitely work with them
again. It's a very welcoming place.";   Two of the most critically acclaimed
and financially successful movies in the last year were made for Orion.
"Dances With Wolves," the Kevin Costner movie about American Indians, cost
less than $20 million and has grossed more than $130 million domestically.
"The Silence of the Lambs," the Jonathan Demme terror film, also cost less
than $20 million, and has grossed more than $130 million; it is also expected
to win a number of Academy Awards.;   But the company, founded in 1982 by New
York lawyer Arthur B. Krim as an offshoot of United Artists, has also had its
major duds, including "She Devil," "State of Grace" and "The Hot Spots.";  
Film executives say that the company was highly vulnerable at the outset
because it had no major outside sources of income, as other studios did. "This
business has its ups and down," said one former Orion executive. "Orion did
not have deep enough pockets to survive the bad times.";   Because of
financial pressures, Orion sold off potentially lucrative foreign theatrical
rights and failed to expand into money-making fields like videos, records or
television. Two weeks ago Daily Variety published an internal Orion plan that
called for sharp reductions in overhead, the consolidation of Orion offices in
Los Angeles and an overhaul of film production and marketing and distribution
strategies.;   Orion is currently negotiating with banks to extend payment
terms on three past-due loans totaling $52 million. John Kluge, the
billionaire whose other interests include the Metromedia Co., owns about 70
percent of Orion.;   About a half-dozen completed films remain unreleased,
largely because of high publicity costs. Studio executives say it costs at
least $10 million, often more, for advertising and prints.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  SOME random observations, digs and predictions for the new year:;   (check)
Movies used to be the most inexpensive of diversions. Now, at almost $7 a peek
($8 in New York and Los Angeles), they've become a major family expenditure.
Little wonder Americans, strapped at Christmastime, opted for something more
tangible, such as paying the electric bill.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  A QUICK REWIND
AND A FEW FAST CUTS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     (check) The holiday movies took us down the Amazon ("At Play in the Fields
of the Lord"), to a back-lot Neverland ("Hook"), to post-war Hollywoodland
("Bugsy") and to Dallas on that fateful fall day in '63 ("JFK"). The terrain
most of them failed to explore: the human heart. "The Prince of Tides" was the
notable exception.;   (check) Think of it as a marriage forged in hell:
Legendary paranoiac Jim Garrison has found a champion in film maker Oliver
Stone, whose "JFK" must rank as the most skillful and eloquent piece of
propaganda since Leni Riefenstahl's Nazi masterpiece, "Triumph of the Will."; 
 (check) Someone should tap Kenneth Branagh to play William Kennedy Smith.
He's just thin-lipped and blank-faced enough to be effective. The accent
should be a snap. (We'll check in later for your pick for Waldo, inconspicuous
hero of the inevitable "Where's Waldo? -- The Movie.");   (check) There was a
noticeable dearth in foreign product this year as exhibitors made room for
such dime-store gems as "Highlander 2" and "Late for Dinner." Has the movie
industry pulled off the kind of "Buy American" boycott Detroit still dreams of
mounting?;   (check) Hollywood keeps churning out high-tech thrillers, but it
longs to lose its heart. Half of the directors interviewed this year,
including Paul Schrader and John Frankenheimer, said they want to turn to
adult romance.;   (check) What kind of movie year will '92 be? In a word:
Noisy. In the wings are serial rapists ("Love Crimes"), psychotic men-haters
("Basic Instinct"), Mutt-and-Jeff cop comedies ("Lethal Weapon 3") and
future-world bounty hunters (Mick Jagger in "Freejack").;   (check) If anybody
out there knows what Bill ("Local Hero") Forsyth and Stanley ("Full Metal
Jacket") Kubrick are up to, please call. Hollywood needs an emergency
transfusion of their trends-be-damned approach.;   (check) Warren Beatty as
Bugsy and Bette Midler as a USO trouper in "For the Boys" appear to have a
lock on the best actor and actress Oscars. How about the supporting
categories? No contest. They should go to Rip Torn for his amiably preoccupied
lawyer in "Defending Your Life" and Diane Ladd for her plain-speaking mother
in "Rambling Rose.";   (check) And, in the "Which Movie Did He See?" category,
top honors to "Last Boy Scout" director Tony Scott for describing Bruce
Willis' foulmouthed P.I. as "sensitive" and "complex.";   (check) File this
under Nesting with a Vengeance. Newlyweds Brian DePalma and producer Gale Anne
Hurd, juggling caring for their first-born with their first film collaboration
("Raising Cain"), told Bay Area location scouts: "All locations must be within
a 20-minute drive of our new home in Woodside.";   (check) If there's still
doubt that nudity and hot-house sex are passe, check out "Bugsy," "Grand
Canyon" (arriving Jan. 10) and "The Prince of Tides." All three leave that
first night of pure bliss to the imagination. The new trend may be toward male
nudity: see Tom Berenger in "At Play in the Fields of the Lord," Kevin Costner
in "Robin Hood" and "Dances with Wolves" and De Niro in "Cape Fear.";  
(check) Most overrated film of '91: "Silence of the Lambs." Most underrated:
Paul Schrader's "The Comfort of Strangers" and Abel Ferrara's "King of New

<LEADPARA>  THERE'S a lot of talk about the rising profile of women directors this season,
with Jodie Foster's "Little Man Tate," Mary Agnes Donoghue's "Paradise" and
Martha Coolidge's "Rambling Rose" in theaters now, and Barbra Streisand's "The
Prince of Tides" due in December.;   But what about leading roles for women?
The outlook isn't particularly plentiful, judging from the more than 75 movies
due to open before the end of the year.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Some people are wondering how the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and

roles between now and Dec. 31 command automatic attention:;   (box) The New
York psychiatrist in "The Prince of Tides" played by Streisand (a previous
best actress Oscar winner for "Funny Girl").;   (box) The USO entertainer
played by Bette Midler in "For the Boys," a dramatic movie with songs in which
Midler sings, dances and jokes.;   Some possible contenders:;   (box) Annette

even her closest associates say they haven't yet seen the film, due in late
December.;   (box) This year's women's ensemble film is "Fried Green
Tomatoes," due out in time for Oscar consideration. But two of its stars are
recent best-actress Oscar winners: 1990's Kathy Bates and 1989's Jessica

Touchstone Pictures' "Billy Bathgate," starring Dustin Hoffman.;   (box) The
oft-nominated Glenn Close in "Meeting Venus" and Isabelle Huppert in the
French-produced "Madame Bovary.";   In summing up the year, it will be
difficult to overlook the splashy roles played by Susan Sarandon and Geena
Davis in the critically acclaimed "Thelma &amp; Louise." And, of course, there's
Foster's performance in the current "Little Man Tate," but that competes with
her "Silence of the Lambs" role earlier this year.;   Lastly, this year's
reigning box-office star Julia Roberts gets major billing as Tinkerbell in
Steven Spielberg's "Hook" -- but everyone's saying it's a tiny role.  </TEXT>

   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Sony Pictures Entertainment
emerged the big winner at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences yesterday, as its TriStar Pictures and Columbia
Pictures units walked away with 36 Oscar nominations, nearly
half the feature-film total, including 10 for "Bugsy" and
seven for "The Prince of Tides."
   Sony Pictures is a unit of Sony Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   TriStar was quick to capitalize on the strong showing of
"Bugsy," which stars Warren Beatty as mobster-turned-Las
Vegas-architect Bugsy Siegel. TriStar chairman Mike Medavoy
said the studio will double the number of screens for the
film to 1,200 this weekend. "We're going to consider this
like a brand new picture," he said. "The 10 nominations,
which are more than any other picture, should tell people
this is a movie worth seeing." He also expects the
nominations to help the film's foreign release, which begins
this week in Japan.
   A best-picture Oscar can add $30 million or more to a
film's box office take, and that's particularly good news for
"Bugsy," which has grossed $40 million so far. Though the
movie has been a critical smash, many people sidestepped it
in favor of such holiday fare as TriStar's "Hook" and
Paramount Pictures' "The Addams Family," each of which has
passed the $100 million blockbuster mark. "Hook" received
five nominations and "The Addams Family" one, but none were
in major categories.
   The biggest surprise yesterday was the animated feature
"Beauty and the Beast" capturing a best-picture nomination.
Disney made cartoons an Oscar category in 1932 with its
award-winning "Flowers and Trees," and five years later
produced the first full-length animated feature, "Snow
White," which garnered a special award: one big Oscar and
seven little ones. But no Walt Disney Co. film has been
nominated for best picture since "Mary Poppins" in 1964, and
the studio has never taken home the top statuette.
   Disney has lobbied hard to change that, screening the
unfinished "Beauty and the Beast" for Academy members last
fall, giving them free soundtracks and slick programs. The
film also took three of the five nominations for best song,
and nominations for original score and sound.
   Though "Beauty and the Beast" has grossed $110 million so
far, the film is a long-shot on Oscar night March 30. Las
Vegas Hilton oddsmaker Art Manteris yesterday put even money
on Warner Bros.' "JFK," which took eight nominations. The
other nominees for best picture are "Bugsy," "The Prince of
Tides," and Orion Pictures Corp.'s "The Silence of the
Lambs." Warner Bros. is a unit of Time Warner Inc.
   First-time filmmaker John Singleton, 23 years old, became
the youngest person and the first black man ever nominated
for best director, for Columbia's "Boyz N the Hood." He was
also nominated for original screenplay. Other director
nominees were three-time Oscar winner Oliver Stone, "JFK";
Barry Levinson, "Bugsy"; Jonathan Demme, "The Silence of the
Lambs"; and Ridley Scott, "Thelma &amp; Louise."
   Barbra Streisand, who directed and starred in "The Prince
of Tides," had been expected to be tapped, which would have
made her the first woman director nominated since 1976.
Columbia chairman Mark Canton said he was "genuinely
disappointed and a bit incredulous that she wasn't nominated
for best director."

   Oscar Nominees
   Can Count On
   Box Office Gains

   After grossing about $41 million following its release
last September, the Warner Brothers mob movie "Goodfellas" is
eking out business in just 22 theaters, down from a peak of
more than 1,300 screens.
   This morning, though, comes the Big Announcement: Academy
Award nominations. With some other awards and critics' 10
best lists for "Goodfellas" under its belt, Warner felt
confident enough by last Monday to book the movie into about
550 more theaters, starting Friday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This is our shot," says Rob Friedman, head of advertising
and publicity for the Time Warner Inc. unit. "We feel there's
an opportunity with all the recognition we've received, and
we hope the Academy has recognized us too."
   As the leftover 1990 movies slug it out with 1991
releases, studios are counting on critical kudos to give last
year's films one last shot at the box office. History shows
that Oscar nominations do help increase ticket sales. And
actually winning one of the coveted awards from the Academy
of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences on March 25 is worth even
more. The Oscar for best picture can increase a film's total
box office revenue by $30 million to $40 million, according
to Philip Garfinkle, president of the box office data concern
Entertainment Data Inc.
   This year, though, the 1990 films that may get a nod from
the Oscar nominations face tough competition in the
marketplace. Some, like "Goodfellas," have been out of the
public eye for a while. Others, like "Godfather Part III,"
are still in hundreds of theaters but never made a big splash
to begin with, and are slowly losing steam to such hot
newcomers as Twentieth Century Fox Film Inc.'s "Sleeping with
the Enemy." Last weekend, the romantic thriller starring
Julia Roberts opened to an impressive $13.8 million, managing
to knock Fox's own blockbuster, "Home Alone," out of first
place.
   At the same time, for a movie that is already a big hit,
award nominations may not increase business much further. One
movie considered a shoo-in for Oscar nominations -- Orion
Pictures Corp.'s "Dances with Wolves" -- has taken in more
than $103 million since Nov. 9. After initially releasing the
movie on 13 screens, Orion raised the number of screens to
1,300, then added another 200 screens recently in
anticipation of the Academy Award nominations.
   David Forbes, president of distribution for Orion, notes
that the movie has played "very consistently" since its
release, registering its only major drop last weekend, when
ticket sales fell off about 18%. "Obviously there's a
substantial amount of business already in the picture," says
Mr. Forbes. "My anticipation is that the nominations will
give us a good boost, though not an enormous one, and it will
last 10 days to two weeks."
   "Dances with Wolves" made an impressive sweep of the
Golden Globe awards. Though not as prestigious as the Academy
Awards, Golden Globes are often an indicator of how the Oscar
nominations will go. The movie was named best dramatic motion
picture, its star and director Kevin Costner got best
director, and its screenplay by Michael Blake won as well.
Orion has done some advance campaigning for the Oscars,
sending script excerpts and copies of a book of photographs
from the movie to Academy members.
   "Dances with Wolves" is a rarity; it has won both critical
acclaim and big box office success. The Academy often ignores
commercial blockbusters, nominating small arty films such as
last year's "Henry V" and "My Left Foot," or epic movies such
as "Gandhi," "Chariots of Fire" and "The LastEmperor." If
past trends are any indication, the big movies of 1990 --
"Home Alone," "Ghost," "Pretty Woman" and "Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles" -- aren't likely to garner any of the
important Oscar nomination categories.
   Hollywood pundits say the 1990 crop of best picture
candidates include "Awakenings," which stars Robert DeNiro
and Robin Williams and was released by Sony Corp.'s Columbia
Pictures unit; Warner's "Goodfellas," "Hamlet" and "Reversal
of Fortune"; Paramount Pictures Corp.'s "Godfather Part III";
and MGM-Pathe Communications Co.'s "Russia House." Some
longshots include "Avalon," a movie released by Sony's
Tri-Star unit, Columbia's "Postcards From the Edge" and two
more recent films that independent producer Miramax Films has
in limited release, "The Grifters" and "Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bridge."
   But some executives say this year is a tough call. "The
high quality movies and sure-fire winners aren't there like
they were in the past," says John Krier, president of
Exhibitor Relations Co., which analyzes box office data.
   Even with Oscar nominations to lure audiences, the films
will face tough competition over the next few weeks from an
unusally high number of new releases such as "Sleeping with
the Enemy." Tri-Star just released "L.A. Story," a Steve
Martin comedy produced by Carolco Pictures Inc. that grabbed
the No. 2 spot at the box office last weekend with $6.7
billion in ticket sales.
   Tomorrow, Orion opens psychological thriller "The Silence
of the Lambs," which stars Jodie Foster, and Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co.'s Universal Studios unit opens a John
Goodman comedy, "King Ralph." On Feb. 22, Paramount is
opening a romantic comedy, "He Said, She Said," and on March
1, Tri-Star opens another Carolco movie, "The Doors," about
the late rock star Jim Morrison.
   Mark Manson, an analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette,
says Oscar nominations will do more to help movies that
haven't had "such broad visibility," like "Awakenings." He
also believes "Goodfellas" could get a boost by being put
back in theaters because at $41 million in ticket sales it
hasn't saturated the potential audience yet.
   Among the most closely watched films in the nominations
race is "Godfather Part III." As the sequel to two movies
that both won best picture, it has a tough act to follow, and
its critical reception has been mixed. Although it had seven
Golden Globe nominations, it came away without any awards.
   For Paramount, a unit of Paramount Communications Inc.,
"Godfather Part III" has been a disappointment so far; it
cost about $55 million to produce and has sold only about
$62.5 million of tickets. The movie is losing momentum fast,
dropping off about 40% last weekend. Paramount executives say
they have higher hopes for overseas markets, which often
account for a larger share of some films' box office. The
movie will be released overseas starting Feb. 22.
   Hopeful of nominations for "Godfather III," Paramount
plans to increase the number of theaters, now at about 602,
to 750 as of Friday. But Mr. Manson questions whether Oscar
nominations will help. "Much stronger than the pull of any
Oscar nominations was the historical following that the
Godfather movies had, and most of that audience has already
seen the movie," he says. "After a strong opening it didn't
seem to have what the film industry calls legs, so it will
have to be more popular internationally for them to make
money."

-- as a nominee for best director -- it has been a significant turning point
in his career. The film maker says he has had some offers since the film came

<TEXT>     Scripted by Don Roos, the "Hitchcockian" project differs notably from the
usual thriller.;    "There is no male lead -- this does not have a romance,"
Schroeder says. "This will be a challenge, there is no question.";    The
title comes from a newspaper ad that one woman runs and another woman
answers.;    "She is looking for a roommate, and she gets the roommate from
hell," Schroeder says. The plot ultimately has one woman attempting a
make-over in order to imitate the other -- "and then the complications
begin.";    Drawn to the light;  As befits movie co-stars, they were flown
first class to the set, had special living quarters and carefully designed
costumes. But their stardom was short-lived: After two weeks, it is curtains
for the Tobacco Horn Worm Moth.;    Also known as the Tomato Horn Worm Moth --
formerly giant green caterpillars, the kind found munching garden tomatoes --
the creatures play an integral part in Orion Pictures' "The Silence of the
Lambs.";    The thriller -- starring Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins --
revolves around the search for a vicious serial killer. Pivotal clue: a rare
moth, the Death Head Moth from Asia, named for the markings on its body that
resemble a skull and crossbones.;    For one scene, biologist and insect
wrangler Raymond A. Mendez rounded up more than 300 of the worm moths. A
handful were fitted with tiny body shields bearing painted skull and
crossbones; some wore unseen "harnesses" as they flew toward the camera.;   
Because of the brief moth phase in their one-year life spans, backups were
constantly shipped in -- flying first class, in a special carrier -- from
genetic research duties at the University of North Carolina. Once on location,
they were housed in a room with controlled humidity and heat. Off-camera, they
mated; the resulting eggs were shipped back to the university.;    Mendez --
who once wrangled over 27,000 cockroaches for "Creepshow" -- insists that no
moths were harmed during "Silence" filming. Once they had wrapped work on the
Pittsburgh set, he says, survivors "lived out their natural lives in my (New
York) apartment.";    Cinefile; (box) Denzel Washington and John Lithgow play

made up of kids and single parents. So we are going to have to start figuring
out how to deal with all these people who are in society and yet do not lead
what we call 'conventional' lives.";   Liz: "How did you get that incredible

talked a lot about her character, Jane, before we did the film, and I gave her
some research on child prodigies and the adults they grow up to be -- she has

Liz: "Do you generally do a lot of research for a movie, or do you just throw
yourself into it unprepared?";   Jodie: "Usually one throws oneself in
unprepared. Like in 'The Accused,' I simply started and that was that. Which

violent rape -- I might have gone crazy."  </TEXT>

FT  22 OCT 94 / Books: The serial killer as a symbol of success - The cult
of the anti-hero has come a long way since Chaucer's 'smyler with the knyf'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOAN SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What do the following authors have in common: Paul Theroux, William Trevor,
Brett Easton Ellis, Michael Dibdin, Peter Ackroyd, PD James, Thomas Harris,
Patricia D. Cornwell? The answer is that each of them has written one or
more novels featuring a serial killer.
It is a crowded but potentially lucrative field. Since the huge success of
The Silence of the Lambs, publishers and studio executives are on the
look-out for the next Thomas Harris. The American author Patricia Cornwell,
who has made serial killers her speciality, has set up her own film company
and is looking for an actress to play her pathologist heroine Dr Kay
Scarpetta.
Cornwell's novel Cruel and Unusual won last year's Gold Dagger, the top
award for crime fiction in Britain. Her first novel, Post-Mortem, won just
about every crime writing award in Britain and the US. Another Gold Dagger
winner, the English author Michael Dibdin, is writing a serial killer novel,
Dark Spectre, which is due to be published in Britain next spring.
The American writer Brett Easton Ellis received a critical drubbing in 1991
for American Psycho, in which a disaffected Wall Street whizz-kid fantasised
about a gruesome series of murders in New York. Unabashed, Ellis's new
novel, The Informers, rises to a crescendo of violence with a series of
vampiric killings in Los Angeles.
The American feminist historian Jane Caputi has called the 20th century 'the
age of sex crime'. It might seem that these authors are reflecting a natural
preoccupation with a brutal crime which was virtually unknown until the
closing decades of the Victorian era. Brett Easton Ellis would argue, I
suspect, that the crimes committed or contemplated by his characters
symbolise the moral bankruptcy of contemporary American society.
Patricia Cornwell identifies herself and her character, Dr Scarpetta, with
the forces of law and order, characterising serial killers as 'black holes
who (have) sucked light from the planet Earth'. Her new novel, The Body
Farm, is dedicated to the right-wing US senator Orrin Hatch 'for his
tireless fight against crime'.
The body farm is a real place, a research institute where corpses are
exposed to immersion in water or extreme temperatures to establish rates of
decay. Thomas Harris's novels are partly set at Quantico, the FBI academy in
West Virginia which almost no-one had heard of before it appeared in Red
Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs.
Harris's novels are scary, melodramatic, brilliantly-written, and in at
least one important respect deviate drastically from reality. His convicted
killer Hannibal Lecter has become a cult figure whose devious mind easily
outdistances anyone who tangles with him. Anthony Hopkins played him in
Jonathan Demme's film as a still, menacing presence who could see right into
the soul of Clarice Starling, the rookie FBI agent played by Jodie Foster.
Hopkins as Lecter has nothing in common with the grim police mugshots of
real-life serial killers: Albert DeSalvo, John Wayne Gacy, Peter Sutcliffe,
Colin Ireland, Sirhan Sirhan, Bobby Joe Long, Henry Lee Lucas. What tends to
characterise serial killers is a haunting and intolerable sense of their own
inadequacy - often, in the case of men who kill women, a fear of
vulnerability which they project onto the female body.
Killing strangers is, for this group, a survival mechanism. If they were as
glamorous and charismatic as Hannibal Lecter, they would not be serial
killers. By contrast, the serial killer in contemporary fiction is an
anti-hero for our times, incarnating powerful but seldom acknowledged
communal fantasies. At the simplest level, he fulfils a longing for
contemporary legends, for supernatural beings in an age in which magic and
religion have been debunked by science.
Patricia Cornwell's most recent novels have featured a serial killer called
Temple Brooks Gault. In Cruel and Unusual, Gault hacks into the FBI computer
and switches his own fingerprints with those of a murderer who has just gone
to the electric chair. A brilliant fictional device, it sets up Gault, like
Lecter, as an epic anti-hero, a master of disguise who escapes detection in
spite of the fact that 'his face smiled from the Ten Most Wanted lists
posted across the land'.
Gault and Lecter are dramatic representations of stranger-danger, the idea
of the unknown as simultaneously beguiling and threatening.
This notion can be traced all the way back to 'the smyler with the knyf' in
Chaucer's Knight's Tale; in the serial killer novel, the reader is allowed
vicarious contact with this thrilling, terrifying stranger in the knowledge
that he or she will come out of it alive. In this sense the novels offer a
frisson, cheap thrills, but there is more to them than that. Where violence
is concerned, Cornwell's books outdo everything except perhaps American
Psycho, offering graphic descriptions of crime scenes, wounds and
dissections. They offer a challenge to readers, a how-much-more-can-you-take
contest in which the answer, judging by Cornwell's huge sales, is anything
she chooses to present to them.
It might be assumed that nothing could portray the harsh reality of death
more vividly than these incarnadine novels, yet the cumulative effect is
precisely the opposite. The reader becomes habituated to the whirring of
cranial saws, to stomachs plopping onto dissection tables, to the tragedy
that lies behind each cadaver. This is a species of narrative in which the
corpse functions chiefly as clue: the plot, and the solution, are written on
the body.
In a telling exchange in Cruel and Unusual, Dr Scarpetta's female assistant
admits her fear that there is no afterlife. Scarpetta reassures her,
explaining that she draws her wisdom on the subject from dealing with
corpses: 'Something's gone. You look at their faces and you can tell. Their
energy has departed. The spirit didn't die. Just the body did'.
This unfamiliar vagueness from a character who is usually as sharp as a
scalpel is suggestive, a hint that in order to carry out her ghastly job Dr
Scarpetta (and perhaps her creator) has to indulge in an act of denial. It
also summarises the moral impact of the serial killer novel, which is to rob
death of its sting; no longer the end, it becomes merely the essential
opening gambit in an exhilarating fictional process.
The Body Farm is published by Little Brown (Pounds 14.99, 324 pages); Cruel
and Unusual by Warner Books, (Pounds 4.99, 437 pages). Dark Spectre will be
published by Faber &amp; Faber in April. 1995 The Informers is published by
Picador, (Pounds 9.99, 226 pages).

<HEADLINE>  ORION'S PICTURE DIMS: WOODY ALLEN TO LEAVE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Few Allen films have been financial blockbusters, but the
actor-writer-director is among the most prestigious contemporary filmmakers.
His "Annie Hall," a United Artists release in 1977, won the Oscar for best
picture.;   According to sources familiar with Orion who refused to be named,
Allen was forced to leave Orion when it became obvious the small New
York-based studio lacked funding for his next, still-untitled project.;  
Despite such recent hits as "The Silence of the Lambs" and "Dances With
Wolves," Orion missed a $50 million interest payment last Friday. It has been
negotiating with creditors and has raised the possibility of bankruptcy.;  
"Every dedicated filmmaker I know is rooting for Orion to return to its old
form and rightly so, because as studios go, they don't come any finer," Allen
said in a statement.;   In a statement, Orion said it expects Allen to return
to the studio to complete three more films.;   An Orion spokesman didn't
return a telephone call.;   Debt-strapped Orion still intends to release
Allen's recently completed movie, "Shadows and Fog," next year. It stars Jodie
Foster, Madonna and Allen's companion, Mia Farrow.;   Filming for Allen's new
film at Tri-Star is expected to begin in November, the studio said.  </TEXT>

   A cartoon for best picture?
   Walt Disney Co. is lobbying hard to get "Beauty and the
Beast" nominated by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences for the most coveted award in Hollywood. Founder
Walt Disney regularly swept the best cartoon awards, and
animated films regularly get best music and visual effects
awards. But the academy has always shunned animated films for
the top prize.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   To try to change that, Disney is bombarding academy
members with screening invitations and papering trade
magazines with ads. The ads draw heavily on critics'
assessments of the film as one of the year's best and
describe the movie as "the most beautiful love story ever
told."
   But "Beauty" is still a long shot. A Las Vegas oddsmaker
has already put even odds on "Bugsy" and "JFK" for the award,
and more than a half-dozen other films are in the running,
including "Silence of the Lambs," which was released earlier
in the year, "Prince of Tides," and "Grand Canyon." The
academy will announce its nominations Feb. 19, and make its
awards March 30.
   The value of the critical kudos aside, an Oscar is money
in the bank for a movie. In the past, many films nominated
for best picture made the largest share of their ticket sales
after the nomination, and analysts calculate that best
picture can add more than $30 million to a movie's domestic
gross. Moreover, Oscars carry their cachet to foreign
theaters and subsequent markets like videocassette and cable.
   This year, that extra cash is more critical than ever to
some of the big contenders. Studios overspent on production
and marketing for many of the 1991 film crop, and a number of
the candidates are films that have won considerable acclaim
but aren't big commercial successes yet. Last weekend, for
example, box-office sales for "Bugsy" and "Prince of Tides"
fell 32%, while "JFK" dropped 31% and "Grand Canyon" fell
25%.
   Baseline Inc., which compiles weekend box-office
estimates, attributes the decline partly to the loss of male
audiences to the Super Bowl; another potential Oscar
contender, "Fried Green Tomatoes," which appeals largely to
women, went from a handful of theaters to 673 screens and
came in second in the market with a $5 million gross.
   "Beauty and the Beast " is a notable exception; on top of
its rave reviews, the movie is breaking all records for an
animated film. Though its business is tapering off on a
week-to-week basis, the movie is expected to pass the $100
million mark at the box office next weekend.
   Disney is also seeking best director and best screenplay
awards for "Beauty," and hyping the fact that the movie won
the award for best picture in the musical or comedy category
at the Golden Globes, the foreign press awards.
   "Bugsy," from Sony Corp.'s Tri-Star Pictures, won the
Golden Globe award for best picture in the drama category;
Mike Medavoy, chairman of Tri-Star Pictures, notes that 11
films that won in that category in the Globes went on to win
best picture from the academy. Tri-Star is pulling out all
the stops to promote "Bugsy" for a number of categories,
including the best picture, actor, actress and director
awards. In addition to the usual ads, screenings and tapes,
the company produced a glossy "Bugsy" brochure for academy
members.
   The movie could use a boost; "Bugsy," starring Warren
Beatty and Annette Bening, has won many rave reviews but
taken in only about $37 million since its release last month.
Mr. Medavoy insists the movie cost $32 million to produce and
not $40 million as widely reported. Still, since the studio
gets an average of half of the box-office take, the movie
needs to do better. Mr. Medavoy is confident that Bugsy "is
the front-runner to win best picture," and he contends that
rival "JFK" is too controversial to win the award.
   Warner Bros., the Time Warner unit that produced "JFK,"
obviously doesn't agree. The controversy is certainly selling
tickets; the movie passed the $50 million mark over the
weekend. But the studio is concerned that director Oliver
Stone's challenge to the official version of the
assassination of President Kennedy has gotten far more
publicity for its content than for its performances,
direction or technical quality as a film.
   Warner is holding many special screenings for academy
members on both coasts, pitching for every award from best
screenplay and best cinematography to best makeup. In an
unusual move, it is asking for best supporting actor
nominations for 11 of the actors, including Ed Asner, Kevin
Bacon, John Candy, Tommy Lee Jones, Jack Lemmon and Walter
Matthau.
   Mr. Friedman, however, says Warner is not "overspending"
to promote "JFK" to academy members. Indeed, overall spending
on direct advertising is down, according to Variety, which
reported last week that studio ad spending in trade
publications to promote Oscar nominations has dropped by as
much as 33% from commitments made in December. The big ad
dollars, Variety said, are being concentrated on a smaller
number of films.
   Studios are also putting their efforts into more direct
pitches to the academy. Disney, for example, held special
screenings of a work-in-progress film on the making of
"Beauty and the Beast." On behalf of Barbra Streisand's
"Prince of Tides," Mark Canton, the new president of Sony's
Columbia Pictures unit, sent letters to academy members
asking them to recognize Ms. Streisand's achievements as a
filmmaker. "We made a major point of the fact that the
academy has rarely recognized women directors," he says.
   Mr. Canton also made efforts on behalf of a more
controversial Columbia film, "Boyz N' the Hood," one of the
more critically acclaimed recent films about young urban
blacks. Though it had finished its theatrical run, Columbia
re-released it recently in about 400 theaters, and Mr. Canton
sent videocassettes -- not yet available to the public -- to
academy members.
   Studios are pitching a number of other films for the best
picture nomination. Columbia is pushing the little-known "The
Inner Circle," Disney has made its pitch for "Billy Bathgate"
and "The Doctor," and troubled MGM-Pathe Communications Co.
has scraped together enough ad dollars to lobby for "Thelma &amp;
Louise" and "Rush." The Academy often nominates surprise dark
horses and smaller, artier films; independent producers of
such movies are pitching their wares as well, including
Samuel Goldwyn Co.'s "Black Robe" and Miramax Films' "Hear My
Song."
   The Academy has often nominated extremely violent films,
such as last year's "Goodfellas," for best picture but far
less frequently handed them the actual award. Extreme
violence may work against "Silence of the Lambs" from Orion
Pictures Corp., for example.
   But most agree the real surprise would be a nomination for
"Beauty." If ever there were a film to break the unspoken
taboo against animated films, some reason, this is it. On the
other hand, notes John Krier, president of Exhibitor
Relations Inc., a box-office analysis concern, "I don't think
the Academy is going to go for itthey are too in the mold and
too welltrained."

<TEXT>  "Little Man Tate" marks Foster's directing debut. Directing has been fruitful
for Warren Beatty, Robert Redford and Kevin Costner, who all won Oscars for
their directing but never for their acting. But Foster already has an Oscar,
so why branch out? "I love the stress of directing," she told Premiere. "I
really do. What's great is I can answer all the questions, but I don't have to
perform all the tasks. I'm finding that acting is a thousand times more
debilitating, because you're constantly trying to please someone. I find that
kind of stress factor more difficult than the one of being asked a million
questions and being the head banana." Of course, the roles Foster has chosen
-- the FBI trainee in "The Silence of the Lambs," the rape victim in "The
Accused" -- may account for some of the stress in acting. But she's not about
to give that up: "I always identify with the underdog, not the overlord. So I
either want to play them or play in films that support them and have something
to say about them."; AL PACINO; (box) Never look back; After an absence from
films of almost five years, Pacino made a big comeback in 1989 with "Sea of
Love," and he hasn't stopped working since. His latest film is "Frankie and
Johnny," with Michelle Pfeiffer. "I do sense a change in me and it could be a
turning point," Pacino told Garth Pearce. "I have never really wanted to make
a total commitment to films until now. If you say it's a lesson, then I've
learned it. I think I have finally realized what is possible on film. For
someone like me who was reared only on theater, and still loves it, then the
chance to really examine your character in a movie only comes up rarely. So
when film parts used to come my way I turned them down. There are a couple I
might do now, if only I had the chance, but it does not help anyone to look
back on what might have been." Nor does he look back on what was: "I do not
watch my own films and my opinion is always questionable. Even with 'The
Godfather' I did not watch 'Part I' or 'Part II.' I did the third -- which I
haven't seen -- without looking over my shoulder at what went down in those
days."; TWIGGY LAWSON; (box) Half of the name's the same; The gaunt British
model who epitomized '60s London, the era of Carnaby Street and mods and
rockers, is now 42, starring in an American sitcom, "Princesses," and sporting
a last name. "I can't drop Twiggy," she told Ivor Davis. "It's a nickname and
I'm stuck with it for life. But now I'm calling myself Twiggy Lawson. I just
want to make myself sound more like a human being as opposed to a kind of pet
animal." The Lawson comes from her husband, actor Leigh Lawson. Viewers
looking for the cockney sparrow she once was will be disappointed. "Sure
there's a preconceived image of what I am and what I look like," she says,
"but all actresses you speak to have problems of some sort."; STEVE MARTIN;
(box) A mid-life crisis for comedians?; Martin will be seen this fall in the
remake of "Father of the Bride," in the Spencer Tracy role. Some actors might
shy from the comparison, but Martin may just be testing his limits as an
actor. "When I was in college studying philosophy, I had this chart of when
people do their best work," he told Movieline. "With poets it was generally 20
to 25; philosophers started at 75 to 90. Comedy comes in the mid-30s to
mid-40s. Like Jerry Lewis. (Bob Hope) proves the case, because he was
brilliant and then became a card-reader." Could it be that Martin, who is in
his mid-40s, is seeing what's in the cards?  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  WHO'S the biggest draw on the lecture circuit right now? Not, as you might
expect, either Generals Colin Powell or Norman Schwarzkopf. It's said that
Great Britain's former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher commands an all-time
high fee of $50,000! (Of course, Powell and Schwarzkopf haven't had much time
recently to sit and chit and chat. When they do, they may put Maggie in the
shade.);    HEARTS THROB: Matt Dillon is not only the talk of Universal, which
is releasing his latest movie, "A Kiss Before Dying," he is the subject of
excited comment throughout filmland circles. The advance buzz is that this is
the one that will finally put Dillon over the top and into the first class,
big money, big star, leading man status enjoyed by the likes of Tom Cruise and
Kevin Costner.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     -- Liz Smith;    MORE HORROR: If you're a fan of "Silence of the Lambs" --
with its graphically gruesome details -- you should be pleased to know that
Orion Pictures is already moving to put together a sequel. Word is that story
and script are in discussion for a new chapter in the twisted study of serial
killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter, with the hopes of Anthony Hopkins reprising that
role -- and his relationship with FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie
Foster).;    -- Stacy Jenel Smith; DRAMA CONTINUES: Producer Julia Phillips
reports that movie/music mogul David Geffen "is trying to fire me" from the
film adaptations of Anne Rice's vampire novels.;    Though Geffen has not been
available for comment about the matter, such an action would come as no
surprise, considering the poison darts she aims at him -- and scores of others
in the industry -- in her scathing new Random House "You'll Never Eat Lunch in
This Town Again" autobiography.;    Phillips (a super success as a producer of
such blockbusters as "The Sting," "Taxi Driver" and "Close Encounters of the
Third Kind" before drugs and drink took their toll) secured film rights to the
Rice works seven years ago and made a deal for their adaptations with Warners.
She says Geffen acquired the projects from her last year, but she expected to
stay aboard as producer when any (or all) of them were adapted to screen.
Until now.;    -- Marilyn Beck;    BUY THE BOOK: In Washington these days, the
book that everybody wants to get his hands on is Ronald Kessler's upcoming
expose with the jaw-breaking title, "Escape From the CIA: How the CIA Won and
Lost the Most Important KGB Spy to Ever Defect to The U.S." This comes from
Pocket Books in May. NASTY RESPONSE: The woman whose experience was the basis
for Germany's Oscar-nominated "The Nasty Girl" has not become a heroine to her
townsfolk. Anja Rosmus is being chilled out because she blew the whistle on
all the people back in Passau, Germany, who were die-hard Nazi sympathizers.
And now comes word that Passau will be the locale for an extremist neo-Nazi
convention, celebrating Hitler's birthday. Local bakers are said to be vying
with each other making swastika-shaped breads! As disgusting and unbelievable
as this sounds, it's for real.;    -- Liz Smith; :  </TEXT>

   Mimi Rogers sees a gleam of hope that women
may one day achieve equal status in today's macho movie world.
   ``It's an unfortunate fact that there are many more roles for
men than there are for women. A favorable sign is the success of
films like `Pretty Woman' and `Ghosts' - much more successful than
big, male-dominated action films,'' she said.
   ``With these two films, in which women are on more of an equal
level, being so successful, maybe the trend will start to shift in
the direction of having men and women really co-starring.''
   Upcoming movies seem promising: Cher and Winona Ryder co-star in
Orion's ``Mermaids,'' a sweet relationship movie; Michelle Pfeifer
co-stars with Sean Connery in ``The Russia House,'' based on the
John le Carre thriller; Julia Roberts stars in next spring's
``Sleeping With the Enemy''; and Academy Award-winner Jody Foster
is eagerly awaited as the star of ``Silence of the Lambs,'' a taut
thriller based on the best seller by Thomas Harris.
   If not equal, Rogers has a vital role in ``Desperate Hours,''
with Mickey Rourke and Anthony Hopkins. It's Dino De Laurentiis'
update of the 1955 movie, with Rogers in the part originated by
Martha Scott. Rourke plays the Humphrey Bogart role of a criminal
psycho who takes a suburban family hostage. Hopkins has the part of
the husband, originally played by Fredric March.
   The director of the MGM release is Michael Cimino. Yes, the same
Michael Cimino who won an Academy Award for ``The Deer Hunter'' in
1978, and made the financial bomb ``Heaven's Gate'' in 1980.
   Rogers remarked that during the ``Desperate Hours'' filming
Cimino ``was very relaxed, very much at ease and enjoying the whole
process. There was an awareness on his part that he wanted to bring
it in on time and on budget. I think we actually finished a week
early and under budget.
   ``He knows that he knows how to make movies. There's no question
the guy has made some brilliant movies. It's more a matter of
reaffirming that he can do it, that he can follow a schedule and a
budget, that it's no problem and boom - there's the movie. That's
what he did.''
   Rogers has three new films: ``Desperate Hours''; ``The Doors,''
Oliver Stone's biography of rocker Jim Morrison; and ``The
Rapture,'' an apocalyptic drama. Last January, she and Tom Cruise
ended their three-year marriage, during which she seemed to be
subordinating her own career as his zoomed skyward.
   She corrected that impression: ``I actually worked quite a bit.
Unfortunately, two of the films that I did haven't been released in
this country.
   ``I did a picture for Vestron called `Hider in the House' (with
Gary Busey) that got caught up in the company's bankruptcy. Then I
did a film with James Belushi called `To Forget Palermo.' We spent
14 weeks shooting that. It was an Italian-financed film - an
English (language) film with an Italian director. That's always a
bit of an experiment,'' she said.
   ``I don't know what happened to it. Maybe American distributors
looked at it and thought it wasn't going to make money. Both of
those films, I think, have been released internationally but not
here. So there's an apparent void that didn't really exist.''
   Like her former husband, Mimi (short for Miriam) Rogers had a
traveling childhood. Both their fathers were engineers who took
jobs all over. Rogers was born in Coral Gables, Fla., but she moved
to Virginia, Arizona, Michigan, England and finally Los Angeles. A
good student, she graduated from high school at 14, and started
acting in her 20s. Her first film was ``Blue Skies Again'' with
Harry Hamlin.
   Her other co-stars include Michael Keaton (``Gung Ho''),
Christopher Reeve (``Street Smart''), Tom Berenger (``Some to Watch
Over Me'') and Denzel Washington (``The Mighty Quinn'').
   She usually plays ``the love interest.'' But she hopes that will
change as movies take a feminine tilt.

<DESCRIPT>  CELEBRITY; BRIEF  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  IT'S tension time for the troops on Disney's "The Marrying Man." The film
returns to the cameras today for reshooting of its elaborate wedding sequence
-- in the wake of public airing of the on-set friction between the team of
Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger and most everyone else in the company, it would
seem.;    The February issue of Premiere Magazine describes principal
production of the film last summer as a nightmare of continuous tantrums and
uncooperative behavior by Basinger and Baldwin -- who late last week issued a
statement calling the allegations "either distorted or outright lies." Baldwin
and Basinger also said, "We chose not to do publicity for 'The Marrying Man'
because the movie Disney made is not the movie we agreed to do."  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  The Grapevine  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Whether it is or not, "They're going to show up for the (new) shooting,"
says producer David Permut.;    Disney is putting heavy new funding into the
movie -- not only to bring Basinger and Baldwin back to the cameras, but
co-stars Robert Loggia and Elizabeth Shue as well.;    Permut confirms the
shoot has necessitated "building new sets and hiring several hundred extras.
The wedding is really a totally new scene -- the cost is considerable.";   
According to Permut, "Marrying Man" has done well in test screenings. "We're
elated with it -- but we felt we could strengthen it by reshooting some
scenes, primarily the wedding. Frankly, (Disney's) extra investment speaks
very well of their commitment to the film and their confidence about its
potential." Asked about his two stars, Permut replies, "I'll only say this:
'Marrying Man' was the greatest experience of my life. I learned a lot.";   
VERY INTERESTING: The announcement that Warner Bros.'s "Batman II" will start
production this year -- likely in the summer -- with Tim Burton directing, is
gaining much attention. But we'll believe the picture's rolling when we see
it. Burton said just last month that there was no way of telling when a script
for the film would be ready -- and that he couldn't imagine it going into
production this year or next.;    MIXED MEDIA: With his "Silence of the Lambs"
thriller starring Jodie Foster due to open for Orion next month, filmmaker
Jonathan Demme has made a deal to direct three more features for the firm. The
first will likely be "Fatal Voyage," based on Dan Kurzman's best seller about
World War II's ill-fated U.S.S. Indianapolis, which, with the Stacy Keach
"Mission of the Shark" telepic upcoming for CBS, means two projects about the
ship are on the boards.;    Sally Field's "Conundrum," which was slated for
shooting last year, is still a long way from being ready for screen. Field
says the psychological thriller in which she's supposed to play a police
investigator "is still in development (at Pathe). We have no idea when it will
go into production." She's been attached to the project for more than two
years.;    Ted Turner has signed screenwriter Edward Anhalt to write his
"Alexander the Great" movie script.;    CASTING CORNER: Martin Mull does a
guest turn on Fox's "Get a Life" as talk-show host Sandy Connors. In the
"Chris Wins a Celebrity" segment shooting this week, Chris Peterson (Chris
Elliott) enters a contest 3,000 times to win a weekend with Connors, his
favorite talk-show host. A weekend turns into a month when Mull's character
decides to quit his TV show to live a carefree life with the Petersons.;   
WHEN IN JAPAN: Debbie Shapiro, the Tony Award-winning star of "Jerome Robbins'
Broadway" is taking a crash course in Japanese -- to prepare for the show's
run in Japan that commences in March. The "Broadway" songs will be performed
in English, but the cast will perform the speaking parts in Japanese.  </TEXT>

<CAPTION>  Photo; PHOTO: Peter and Captain Hook have at it in the Disney classic. Now
Spielberg's readying his version.  </CAPTION>
<DESCRIPT>  MOVIE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  ABOUT six years ago, as the rights to the James M. Barrie story were about to
revert to public domain, Steven Spielberg began talking about a live-action
version of "Peter Pan," co-starring Michael Jackson as Peter and perhaps
veteran meanie Christopher Lee as Captain Hook.;    It sounded like a union
made in Neverland -- the classic fairy tale about the boy who refused to grow
up by the filmmaker who refused to grow up.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  A YOUNG-AT-HEART DIRECTOR PREPARES A RETURN
TO THE LOST BOYS OF NEVERLAND
SPIELBERG'S 'PETER PAN' COMPLEX  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Film  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     For a number of reasons -- the unavailability of Jackson and the success of
Spielberg's Indiana Jones series among them -- Spielberg never got around to
his ultimate celluloid fantasy.;    It was probably for the best. At the time,
the director of "E.T." and "Jaws" was being criticized for not tackling
grown-up problems on screen. Spielberg's counterpunch: the achingly relevant
"The Color Purple" and "Empire of the Sun." Spielberg was clearly out of his
league. Even his detractors conceded that the juvenile Spielberg was
preferable to the socially conscious Spielberg who clunked about in David
Lean's vastly over-sized boots.;    Spielberg, now obviously more at peace
with himself, has returned to the Peter Pan project. But it won't be the story
we all remember from the Disney cartoon feature and the Mary Martin musical.; 
  Spielberg's spin, titled simply "Hook" and taken from a story by Jim V. Hart
and Nick ("The Boy Who Could Fly") Castle, sounds like the perfect balm for
age-obsessed baby boomers.;    It will feature Robin Williams as an adult Pan,
Dustin Hoffman as an Actors Studio version of Captain Hook (Capt. Mumbles?),
Bob Hoskins as first-mate Smee and Maggie Smith as the ninetysomething "Gran"
Wendy, who, unlike Peter, has had to deal with the ravages of real time.
(Peter ages during his short sojourn from Neverland.);    And who has
Spielberg nabbed for that mischievous faerie Tinkerbell? Would you believe
Julia Roberts? Tink has always been accused of being something of a vixen and
sex symbol. This may be even more the case with the sensuous Roberts in the
role. At the very least, we can expect a strong undercurrent of sexual
tension. Wendy's now too old for Peter, and Tinkerbell, who has always had a
thing for Peter, is much too small.;    Look for this Peter to tarry longer
than usual with the voluptuous inhabitants of Mermaids Lagoon.;    It's either
that, or the screenwriters will have to introduce a youth potion for Wendy and
a growth vitamin for Tink.;    Apart from the obvious thematic problems posed
by an 80-years-later return to Neverland, there also is that lingering
industry admonition -- Thou Shalt Not Go Home Again (particularly when it
comes to raiding family perennials).;    Think back. When was the last time
you saw a satisfying sequel or modernization of a family classic?;    "The
Wiz," a Motown spin on "The Wizard of Oz," offered a much-too-old Diana Ross
scampering through an inner-city version of Oz. Disney's "Return to Oz"
boomeranged by traumatizing its target audience with a heavily Freudian
continuation of Dorothy's travels. And don't forget what one enterprising
playwright did to Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer. He had them return 60 years later
as a drunkard and a child-molester, played by Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas
in a work-in-progress called "The Boys of Autumn" that mercifully never made
it to Broadway.;    So, you see, Spielberg and company have their work cut out
for them. This tinkering (no pun intended) with childhood favorites can be as
hazardous to your health as a swim around Pirates Cove with that tick-tocking
crocodile in hot pursuit.;    "Hook" begins production at Columbia Studios on
Feb. 19. It will be designed by Norman Garwood ("Brazil"), photographed by
Dean Cundey ("Who Framed Roger Rabbit") and scored by Spielberg's favorite
composer, five-time Oscar winner John Williams ("Jaws," "Raiders of the Lost
Ark"). It's scheduled to open around Christmastime.; (hbox);    'LAMBS' TO THE
SLAUGHTER -- Menlo Park audiences were treated to a most unusual double bill
Saturday night -- Woody Allen's "Alice" and a special sneak preview of
Jonathan Demme's "The Silence of the Lambs" (opening Feb. 14). The first deals
in sophisticated screwball comedy; the second, based on the Thomas Harris
best-seller about a pair of psychos and a rookie FBI agent, pushes cold-sweat
suspense. So did the capacity "Alice" crowd stick around for the year's most
eagerly awaited thriller, co-starring Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins? Are
you kidding? Allen may draw in the tony university town, but gruesome
cut-'em-ups don't. The theater practically cleared out, leaving plenty of
seats for the Demme contingent, obviously from out of town.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     Backdraft.  Kurt Russell, William Baldwin star as warring brothers in this
rigorously old-fashioned paean to Chicago firefighters. Effects are quite
spectacular (especially for the climactic chemical-plant blaze), but story is
strictly "As the World Burns" caliber, schmaltzy and formulaic. With Scott
Glenn, Robert De Niro and, as the Dr. Lecter of pyromaniacs, Donald
Sutherland. Directed by Ron ("Cocoon") Howard. (star)(star);    The Comfort of
Strangers.  Paul Schrader and Harold Pinter collaborated on this sinuous,
sensuous adaptation of Ian McEdwan's novel about foreigners in Venice who fall
under the spell of a couple into voyeurism, S&amp;M, etc. Rupert Everett, Natasha
Richardson play the perpetually lost tourists; Christopher Walken, Helen
Mirren have fun with the purposely over-the-top host and hostess. Dark,
unsettling, often rudely funny. R (for nudity, violence). (star)(star)(star)
1/2;    Cyrano de Bergerac.  Edmond Rostand's oft-told tale of bravery,
balcony deceit and the nose "that launched a thousand ships" gets glorious,
cast-of-thousands treatment in this robust French adaptation. Gerard Depardieu
stars as famed swordsman, poet and braggart. PG (violent swordplay).
(star)(star)(star)(star);    Dances with Wolves.  Kevin Costner's sprawling
tribute to the vanishing frontier is old-fashioned epic movie-making at its
best. Borrowing from William Wyler and Akira Kurosawa, Costner has created a
rich tapestry of adventures among the Sioux Indians, circa 1865. Costner plays
a by-the-book military man reborn as a Sioux warrior. Adapted by Michael Blake
from his own novel; music by John Barry. PG-13 (for violence).
(star)(star)(star)(star);    Defending Your Life.  Albert Brooks wrote,
directed and stars in this droll stroll through the hereafter, which now
resembles an antiseptic industrial park. Rip Torn is hilarious as lawyer
charged with making Brooks' case in heaven; Meryl Streep wings it on a smile
and chuckle as our hero's celestial love interest. PG (slight profanity).
(star)(star)(star);    Hamlet.  Franco Zeffirelli, who popularized the Bard's
"Romeo and Juliet" in the '60s, returns with a robust, albeit severely pared
down, version of Shakespeare's most famous tragedy. Mel Gibson shows new range
and depth as a now mostly seething Prince of Denmark, determined to trap his
father's assassins. Glenn Close, Alan Bates co-star. PG (violent swordplay).
(star)(star) 1/2;    Hudson Hawk.  Bruce Willis plays world-class cat burglar
in this ferociously loony caper comedy that combines elements from "Dr.
Strangelove," James Bond cliff-hangers and "Singin' in the Rain." Andie
MacDowell is spy in nun's habit; Richard E. Grant, Sandra Bernhard are
perverse rich couple bent on cornering gold market; Danny Aiello flits in and
out of action as Willis' sidekick. Dumb, dumb, dumb -- but also quite funny in
spots. R. (star)(star);    Impromptu  Judy Davis plays author George Sand in
this amusing, though surprisingly tame, chronicle of the life and loves of a
19th-century freethinker who refused to abide by conventions of her day. A
handsome production, but not insightful or scandalous enough by half. Directed
by James Lapine. PG. (star)(star);    Journey of Hope.  Swiss Oscar-winner
inspired by news account of Turkish family that finds deceit, friendship,
finally tragedy on the road to Switzerland and "new beginning." Hardly the
best of this year's foreign-language nominees, it's still a work of quiet
intensity and undeniable integrity. Directed Xavier Koller. No MPAA rating
(could be PG) (star)(star)(star);    The Killer  Typically bloody,
over-the-top crime melodrama from Hong Kong. Chinese superstar Chow Yun-Fat
plays professional hit man who allows emotions to cloud judgment during "one
last job"; Danny Lee is the renegade cop who becomes his ally in final fire
fight inspired by "Butch Cassidy &amp; the Sundance Kid." Subtitled. No Rating
(would be R for violence). (star)(star) 1/2;    Kindergarten Cop.  "Twins"
collaborators Ivan Reitman and Arnie Schwarzenegger reteam for a clever
amalgam of cop thriller and kiddie comedy. Arnie plays obsessed cop who goes
undercover as substitute teacher to ferret out (quite literally) the son and
estranged wife of a killer. PG-13 (may be too intense for children under 6).
(star)(star) 1/2;    A Kiss Before Dying.  "Fatal Attraction" author James
Dearden's attempt at Hitchcockian thriller misfires badly. Matt Dillon, Sean
Young co-star as psychotic social climber and rich twins high on killer's hit
list (Young is doubly forgettable in dual roles). Inserts from "Vertigo" only
serve to remind how far from the mark this ludicrous concoction is. Taken from
Ira Levin novel, filmed in '56 with Joanne Woodward, Robert Wagner. R
(violence, slight nudity). (star);    La Femme Nikita.  Luc Besson, of the
stylish and empty "Subway" and "Big Blue," returns with a sweet-to-savage
policier that rates a "Wow!" for its visual pyrotechnics and a "Huh?" for its
idiotic story line, which mixes "My Fair Lady" and "Dirty Harry." Anne
Parillaud is the title character, a punkette sociopath made over as government
assassin. R (violence). (star)(star)(star);    L.A. Story.  Steve Martin
shares his love/hate feelings for La La Land in this loony, romantic fable
that owes more of a debt than Martin cares to acknowledge to Fellini and Woody
Allen. Such obvious targets as health spas, freeway gridlock, happy-talk news
come under assault. PG-13 (profanity, comic lovemaking). (star)(star);   
Madonna: Truth or Dare  Material Girl's Blond Ambition tour seen mostly from
the wings, where Madonna, befitting her status as pop diva, holds court and
insults fans, lovers and sycophants alike. How much of the real Madonna is
revealed? Who cares. Thanks to rock-vid director Alek Keshishian, Madonna's
latest "memorial to me" is bitchy, sexy, patronizing -- but never ever boring.
With Kevin Costner, Warren Beatty and Madonna's sleazy older brother among
backstage visitor-victims. R (nudity, profanity). (star)(star)(star) 1/2;   
Mortal Thoughts.  Art-house darling Alan ("Choose Me") Rudolph returns with
his most commercial venture yet, a bleakly funny, blue-collar spin on French
classic "Diabolique." Demi Moore, Glenne Headly play Jersey wives involved in
mysterious (and mutually beneficial) homicides; Bruce Willis is the deserving
victim, an obnoxious wife-beater. With Harvey Keitel as cagey cop sorting out
the facts. R (profanity, violence). (star)(star)(star)(star);    New Jack
City.  Mario Van Peebles makes solid directorial debut with this
blaxploitation spin on "Little Caesar." Wesley Snipes, Ice-T co-star as Harlem
drug czar and the undercover cop who vows to infiltrate his cocaine factory. R
(violence, profanity, nudity) (star)(star) 1/2;    Open Doors  Oscar-nominee
from Italy chronicles triple murder in pre-World War II Palermo and resultant
investigation and trial. Gian Maria Volonte brings quiet dignity to judge who
refuses to go along with killer's or mob's cries for swift justice. Directed
by Gianni Amelio. No Rating (could be R for violence). Italian with English
subtitles. (star)(star)(star) 1/2;    One Good Cop.  Or: Mr. Mom Joins the
Force. Michael Keaton plays New York cop who becomes guardian of three
youngsters when his partner is gunned down. Keaton attempts to skate by on
charm and one-liners, but mix of "Father Knows Best" schmaltz and street
sadism takes it toll. Directed, written by Heywood Gould. R (violence,
profanity). (star);    Only the Lonely.  "Home Alone" team -- producer John
Hughes, writer-director Chris Columbus -- returns with intermittently charming
fable about mama's-boy cop (John Candy) who falls for mortician's assistant
(Ally Sheedy), thereby earning wrath of his Irish mother (Maureen O'Hara in
her first movie in 20 years). Sheedy's morbid profession is good for a few
laughs and scenes between Candy and very salty O'Hara are spirited and funny,
but overall this latter-day "Marty" is as uneven as it is preposterous. PG-13
(profanity). (star)(star);    Oscar.  Sly Stallone attempts a Damon Runyon
fable with mixed results. Stallone himself is humorously discombobulated as
mobster attempting to go straight as daughter plots to elope with chauffeur,
accountant, linguistic coach -- whoever! But comic-opera approach (goosed by
Rossini score) will either leave you slapping your knee or pulling at your
hair. Directed by John Landis. PG (OK for entire family). (star)(star);    Out
for Justice.  Aikido champ Steven Seagal returns in his best cop thriller
since "Above the Law." Ultra-violent, single-minded script pits Seagal's
Brooklyn narc against wigged-out psycho from the old neighborhood (the
baby-faced William Forsythe). Credit the fluid, lightning-charged direction to
grade-B ace John ("Best Seller") Flynn. R (non-stop violence, profanity).
(star)(star)(star);    A Rage in Harlem.  Like the '50s Chester Himes novel on
which it's based, this gangland melodrama plies the sentimental and the
sadistic, the comic and depraved. Results are wildly uneven, but debuting
director Bill Dukes coaxes wonderfully quirky performances from blue-ribbon
cast, which includes Danny Glover, Zakes Mokae, Badja Djola and a deliciously
sultry Robin Givens. R (violence, profanity). (star)(star)(star);    The
Silence of the Lambs.  What could have been ride of the season becomes, under
Jonathan Demme's almost polite direction, a slavish, too-densely plotted
adaptation of Thomas Harris novel about a pair of dangerous sociopaths and the
FBI trainee who uses one to track the other. Jodie Foster is fine as novice
agent who must suppress all traces of femininity to earn her stripes; Anthony
Hopkins, typically, overdoes it. R (violence, gruesome makeup effects).
(star)(star) 1/2;    Shipwrecked.  Crude but entertaining return to "Treasure
Island" territory, compliments of Disney. Norway's Stian Smestad plays gung-ho
youth who becomes more of a Rambo than Robinson Crusoe when washed ashore on
South Seas island; Gabriel Byrne fumes a lot as pirate stand-in for Long John
Silver. Shot in Fiji and Spain. PG. (star)(star) 1/2;    Sleeping with the
Enemy.  Julia ("Pretty Woman") Roberts plays abused wife who stages her own
death, then takes a new identity in idyllic Iowa burg. Patrick Bergin, Kevin
Anderson co-star as stalking husband and new beau, respectively. Source novel
took a stab at dealing with issue of abused wife reassembling her life; movie
reduces premise to slasher cliches. R (violence, profanity). (star)(star);   
Switch.  Another gender-change comedy a la "Tootsie," "All of Me," this time
starring Ellen Barkin as sexist pig named Steve who's reincarnated as
foulmouthed, two-fisted cookie named Amanda. Barkin is mostly hilarious in the
lead, but director-writer Blake Edwards doesn't know where to go with the
premise. R (for gratuitous profanity, nudity). (star)(star);    Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze.  Heroes in Half-Shells return in
broader, funnier sequel to their 1990 hit. Parents will applaud decision to
downplay the violence while lamenting the non-existent plot. PG (may be too
intense for some children). (star)(star);    Thelma &amp; Louise  Susan Sarandon
and Geena Davis are perfectly matched as Arkansas buddies who take a little
R&amp;R from loutish menfolk and end up on FBI's Most Wanted list. Think of it as
a feminist variation on "Easy Rider" and "Butch Cassidy &amp; the Sundance Kid."
With Harvey Keitel, Christopher McDonald and Brad Pitt as suspiciously likable
hitchhiker. Directed by Ridley ("Alien") Scott. Davis is a gas as initially
timid fugitive. R (violence, profanity). (star)(star)(star);    Toy Soldiers. 
Odd, unsettling blend of prep-school shenanigans and Rambo-esque mayhem fro
Mr. High Concept, Daniel ("Beverly Hills Cop") Petrie Jr., here making
directorial debut. Sean Astin, Wil Wheaton, Keith Coogan are among rebellious
rich kids who save Virginia academy from Columbian terrorists; Lou Gossett
Jr., Denholm Elliott are pushover dean and headmaster. R (extreme violence,
profanity). (star) 1/2;    Truly, Madly, Deeply  British comedy with a very
serious message about saying goodbye to the recently departed. Juliet
Stevenson is wonderful as grieving translator; Alan Rickman plays her dead
lover, who returns to console and rearrange the furniture. Opening moments
with Stevenson at her most distraught are moving, but later mix of fantasy and
droll romance doesn't always work. Directed, written by Anthony Minghella. No
Rating (could be PG). (star)(star) 1/2;    What About Bob?  Bill Murray as a
multi-phobic guy who, nearing a breakdown, invades his psychiatrist's New
England vacation. Murray fears everything, but it's shrink Richard Dreyfuss
who ultimately comes unglued. A funny, gradually escalating farce that somehow
makes light of control-freak doctors and therapy junkies without seeming cruel
or exploitive. Directed by Frank Oz from Tom ("Dead Poets Society") Schulman
script. PG. (star)(star)(star);    Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken  Gabrielle
Anwar plays plucky, Depression-era Pollyanna in Disney pick-up about a teen
who runs away and joins carnival act featuring high-diving stallions. Cliff
Robertson, in Buffalo Bill get-up, adds some much-needed tension as Anwar's
initially skeptical boss. Directed by Steve Miner, who does OK by idyllic
opening but allows final scenes to go all mushy and melodramatic. G (OK for
entire family). (star)(star)  </TEXT>

FT  02 JAN 92 / Arts: Same old message, but Politically Correct - Cinema in
1991
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Time for the round-up of the year. This is the occasion on which a critic
breaks open his memory bank only to discover that he has been robbed,
probably sometime during the festive, low-security hours of Christmas Day.
'What films really stood out during 1991?,' someone asked me this Christmas
over the dangerous third Martini. I was flummoxed. I scratched my coloured
paper hat and caught a fleeting mental glimpse of all the movies I had seen
during the year. Then it was gone. I had to return to my notes on sober
Boxing Day to remember it all.
Now they leap forth. All those multiple murderer films like The Silence Of
The Lambs and Henry, Portrait Of A Serial Killer. All those new black films
like Boyz N The Hood and Young Soul Rebels. All those feminist-agenda
thrillers like Thelma and Louise and Misery, where women adopt the
hunter-harrier roles usually played by men.
But as one would expect from a palindromic year - '1991' reads the same
backwards or forwards - a cinema trying to reverse itself ideologically kept
finding that it was saying the same old things. Dances With Wolves essayed a
reconstruction of the Western for the age of Indian Rights and ended by
sending much the same sexist, racist messages as before under a 'politically
correct' banner. (The gone-native hero is allowed to fall in love, but only
with the tribe's one adopted white woman). And Thelma and Louise, Ridley
Scott's brilliant trans-American action thriller, put two females at the
wheel of the plot and was then accused of making them do the same
thick-eared, screechy things that men would have done.
That, of course, was part of Scott and writer Calli Khouri's point. Plus ca
change in the age of political correctness, plus c'est la meme chose with a
new dash of colour or cross-dressing.
If Thelma and Louise was saved by self-awareness, that commodity was in
short supply elsewhere. Nowhere did the radical resemble the dressed-up
reactionary, with no irony in sight, than in the new black cinema. In New
Jack City and Boyz N The Hood sexual and racial stereotyping stomped across
our screens; and only Spike Lee's Jungle Fever wittily acknowledged that the
same bigotries that flourish in the white community are alive in America's
black community.
Amid so much New Age tub-thumping accompanied by Old Age prejudices, many
filmgoers warmed to the serial killers on view. Few of these even pretended
to be 'brothers' or 'sisters' or paragons of political correctness. All they
wanted to do was to kill you: or in the case of Anthony Hopkins's
mesmerising Hannibal Lecter in Silence Of The Lambs, to eat you.
How refreshing to have a group of characters who laid it on the line. So
refreshing that Hollywood cannily attempted, on at least two occasions, to
cross serial killing with political correctness. There was a box-office
jackpot for Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves, whose hero knocked off more
Normans in his time than Hannibal Lecter had non-vegetarian dinners. And in
Terminator 2 Arnold Schwarzenegger walked about America serially clobbering
every baddie in sight and earning Dollars 200m at the US turnstiles.
But to these comic-strip hero-killers I preferred the higher complexities of
the psychopath films: especially the terrifying human riddles posed by a
movie like John McNaughton's Henry, Portrait Of A Serial Killer. This is the
story of a plain affectless chap who goes around murdering people for -
well, for what? Hardly, to judge by his joyless expression, even for the
hell of it.
If 'causeless' actions are the modern world's greatest moral challenge, then
the most bracing feature of the cinema in 1991 was the demolition work done
on the very idea of cause-and-effect: not just in the moral presentation of
character but in screen storytelling as a whole. Which of us is the same
after Twin Peaks? Even if we never saw David Lynch's TV serial, we read
about its cult status and cuckoo stylistics. And we see its influence, or
that of the aesthetic climate that produced it, in American films like Todd
Haynes's Poison (bizarre interweaving of three movie-pastiche thriller
tales) and Hal Hartley's Trust (young love, family strife and non-stop
non-sequiturs); and also in European films like Patrice Leconte's The
Hairdresser's Husband, a tale of l'amour fou with the stress on fou, and
Jaco Van Dormael's gleaming Toto The Hero, a sort of revenge opera done as a
comic strip.
Today's audiences are learning how to meet multiple-choice aesthetic
challenges that would have been unthinkable ten years ago. The success of a
multi-style fantasy like The Fisher King - not so much a shaggy dog, more
like several mongrels fighting in a sack - proves that. Meanwhile films of
single-track moral momentum, even when done on an epic scale, begin to seem
like yesterday's steam engines. Huffing and puffing towards their climactic
messages, movies like The Bonfire Of The Vanities and Havana try to carry
audiences to a destination they have been to a hundred times before and do
not want to re-visit, thank you, even in a luxury dining car with all-star
passengers.
This suits Britain perfectly. We have no stars: they have all retired or
gone into Labour politics. And we have no money with which to make British
epics: it has gone into making other people's epics like The Last Emperor
and Dances With Wolves. Instead we have a cottage industry that makes
picturesque fixer-uppers: films like Anthony Minghella's Truly Madly Deeply,
Derek Jarman's Edward II, Stephen Poliakoff's Close My Eyes, Peter
Greenaway's Prospero's Books and Ken Loach's European Film Award winner Riff
Raff.
Much talent and variety. Should we mind that the results belong more on the
small screen than the large? Or that the most beautiful and arresting film
of the year, Derek Jarman's The Garden, was not even shot on conventional
film: rather on a mish-mash of video and Super-8 and anything else Jarman
could find in his odds-and-ends bin? The rules of film-making as we prepare
to leave the second millennium AD are as follows: There are no rules. There
are only brave artists trying, with any means at their disposal, to wean
audiences from the old orthodoxies and the old expectations.
My Top Ten for 1991. The Garden, Toto The Hero, Avalon, Riff Raff, The
Fisher King, Thelma And Louise, Miller's Crossing, Jungle Fever, Mr And Mrs
Bridge, Proof.
*****
The first film of the New Year, as so often, seems like a summation of the
previous year. Delicatessen (15, Metro, Gate, Screen on the Hill), a first
feature by two French animators Jeunet and Caro, boasts a serial killer, a
pixillated plot and a blithe disregard for anyone who likes to deal with one
genre at a time. Old-dark-house horror jostles with sight-gag slapstick and
with a gentle love story involving the evil butcher's pining daughter
(Marie-Laure Dougnac) and the new male tenant (Dominique Pinon) who might or
might not end up feeling the sharp edge of Papa's cleaver.
Set in a fog-girt tenement house that could have been designed by Roland
Emmett with help from Gustave Dore, the film's black humour has a manic
charm. A virtuoso opening sequence - tracking shot through streets, close-up
of cleaver being sharpened, tunnelling shot through house's intestines to
face of a terrified man - renders us supple for the gymnastics of style and
story that follow.
We meet an old codger who lives in a waterlogged room teeming with snails
and frogs. We see a boomerang clasp-knife bring horrible justice to its
user. We watch two underwater lovers kiss in a flooded bathroom. And we
experience a cacophony that turns to filmic poetry as the house's percussive
sounds - a metronome, a creaking bed, a carpet being beaten - are swept up
into a musical montage.
If Delicatessen blueprints a new European surrealism, Bill And Ted's Bogus
Journey (PG, Odeon West End) dusts off yesterday's American version. Last
time around, our bubble-headed heroes (Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter)
time-tripped through the universe meeting Socrates, Napoleon and Genghis
Khan and wowing them with the wonders of Valleyspeak. This time they are
just as appealing: visiting Heaven and Hell, defeating a cosmic conspiracy
and meeting Death, who wields a Swedish accent and plays a mean game of
Cluedo. As I was saying, simple down-the-line plots are beginning to look
like yesterday's cinema . . .

<LEADPARA>  Glenn Lovell reviews films on a scale of no stars to 4.; Alice.  Woody Allen's
droll-to-silly blending of "Alice in Wonderland" and "The Invisible Man" has
moments of genuine charm -- compliments of Mia Farrow and Joe Mantegna's
uptown lovers -- but this is definitely lesser Allen, a haphazard splicing of
ideas retrieved from "Manhattan," "Hannah and Her Sisters," etc. Look for Alec
Baldwin as a fast-lane ghost, Cybill Shepherd as a can't-be-bothered friend,
William Hurt as Alice's huffy husband. PG-13 (adult situations). (star)(star)

<TEXT>     Awakenings.  What constitutes sleep, of a physical or spiritual nature?
That's question director Penny Marshall ponders in this downbeat, rigorously
clinical re-telling of Rip Van Winkle fable. Robin Williams, at his most
mannered, plays nerd neurologist who happens upon similarities in "sleeping"
patients at Brooklyn hospital; Robert De Niro is patient who undergoes
miraculous "Charly" cure. Scrupulously understated but still manipulative,
predictable. PG-13. (star)(star) 1/2;    Cyrano de Bergerac.  Edmond Rostand's
oft-told tale of bravery, balcony deceit and the nose "that launched a
thousand ships" gets glorious, cast-of-thousands treatment in this robust
French adaptation. Gerard Depardieu stars as famed swordsman, poet and
braggart; Anne Brochet, Vincent Perez play Roxane and Christian, the young
lovers. Beautifully designed, choreographed and directed.PG (violent
swordplay). (star)(star)(star)(star);    Dances With Wolves.  Kevin Costner's
sprawling tribute to the vanishing frontier is old-fashioned epic movie-making
at its best. Borrowing from William Wyler and Akira Kurosawa, Costner has
created a rich tapestry of adventures among the Sioux Indians, circa 1865.
Costner heads an excellent ensemble as titular character, a by-the-book
military man reborn as a Sioux warrior. Adapted by Michael Blake from his own
novel; music by John Barry. PG-13 (for violence). (star)(star)(star)(star);   
Edward Scissorhands.  Or: Hans Christian Andersen Meets Frankenstein.
"Batman"/"Beetlejuice" creator Tim Burton here delivers a quirky,
sweet-natured little fable about a man-made boy who wasn't quite finished by
his inventor. Johnny Depp brings Chaplinesque poignancy to the title role;
Diane Wiest, Winona Ryder, Alan Arkin are deadpan and dead-on as the suburban
family that adopts Edward. Vincent Price is glimpsed in flashbacks as Edward's
creator. PG-13 (for violence; may be too intense for some children).
(star)(star)(star) 1/2;    The Field.  Craggy Irish setting and robust lead by
a white-bearded Richard Harris can't save this heavy-handed adaptation of John
B. Keane play about a blustery farmer's battle for a bit of pasture. Harris
gives a good accounting of himself as appropriately named "Bull" McCabe, but
Brenda Fricker, Sean Bean and John Hurt as village idiot appear to have
wandered in from an overwrought D.H. Lawrence saga about family guilt and
smoldering passion. Directed, scripted by Jim Sheridan of "My Left Foot."
PG-13 (slight violence). (star)(star);    Flight of the Intruder.  Gung-ho,
boldly mounted adaptation of Stephen Coonts' best-seller about a rogue mission
to bomb Hanoi. Brad Johnson brings charisma and a certain Duke Wayne swagger
to the vigilante carrier pilot; Willem Dafoe, Danny Glover co-star,
respectively, as Johnson's war-crazy bombardier and mock-tough squadron
leader. PG-13 (combat violence, profanity). (star)(star)(star)The Godfather
III.  Francis Coppola picks up story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) in late
'70s, as family seeks respectability through Vatican business ventures.
Standing in the way are Sonny Corleone's hot-headed son (Andy Garcia) and
old-style Mafioso rivals who still live by the gun. Beautifully mounted with
moody, Oscar-worthy cinematography, but overall final installment is downbeat,
derivative. With Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Sophia Coppola. R (violence,
profanity). (star)(star) 1/2;    Green Card.  Sparkling interplay between
France's Gerard Depardieu and Andie MacDowell turn what could have been fluff
piece into a very spirited and surprising comedy-romance. Depardieu plays
ne'er-do-well composer who weds MacDowell to confound immigrations and stay in
New York. Directed, scripted by Australia's Peter Weir. PG-13.
(star)(star)(star);    The Grifters.  Gritty, downbeat Jim Thompson's novel
about trio of con artists who out-con themselves becomes buoyant, sexy film
noir caper in British director Stephen ("Dangerous Liaisons") Frears' hands.
Anjelica Huston (now a platinum blonde), John Cusack, Annette Bening star as
catty mother, unlucky son and conspiring girlfriend. Pat Hingle, Henry Jones,
J.T. Walsh are among colorful supporting players. R (nudity, profanity,
violence). (star)(star)(star) 1/2;    Hamlet.  Franco Zeffirelli, who
popularized the Bard's "Romeo and Juliet" in the '60s, returns with a robust,
albeit severely pared down, version of Shakespeare's most famous tragedy. Mel
Gibson shows new range and depth as a now mostly seething Prince of Denmark,
determined to trap his father's assassins. Glenn Close, Alan Bates, Paul
Scofield, Ian Holm and Helena Bonham-Carter co-star. Handsome production that
stirs the senses without taxing the gray matter. PG (violent swordplay).
(star)(star) 1/2;    Home Alone.  Macaulay Culkin, the cherubic wiseacre of
"Uncle Buck," plays an accidentally abandoned 8-year-old who protects hearth
and home from a pair of bungling burglars on Christmas eve. Joe Pesci, Daniel
Stern are the Mutt and Jeff second-story men. Directed by Chris Columbus from
a script by John ("Breakfast Club") Hughes. PG (slight profanity).
(star)(star) 1/2;    Kindergarten Cop.  "Twins" collaborators Ivan Reitman and
Arnie Schwarzenegger reteam for a clever amalgam of cop thriller and kiddie
comedy. Arnie plays obsessed cop who goes undercover as substitute teacher to
ferret out (quite literally) the son and estranged wife of a killer. Pamela
Reed, Carroll Baker co-star. PG-13 (may be too intense for children under 6).
(star)(star) 1/2;    L.A. Story.  Steve Martin shares his love/hate feelings
for La La Land in this loony, surprisingly mushy fable that owes more of a
debt than Martin cares to acknowledge to Fellini and Woody Allen. Such obvious
targets as health fads, freeway gridlock, happy-talk news teams come under
assault. Martin, who also scripted, co-stars with real-life wife Victoria
Tennant and an all-knowing electronic freeway sign. PG-13 (profanity, comic
lovemaking). (star)(star);    Misery.  Stephen King's darkest yarn becomes
sunnier -- and funnier -- thriller in the hands of director Rob Reiner and
screenwriter William Goldman, collaborators on "The Princess Bride." James
Caan is severely injured romance novelist who's saved, then enslaved, by his
"No. 1 fan," a Rocky Mountains nut case played by Kathy Bates. R (violence,
profanity). (star)(star) 1/2;    Mr. and Mrs. Bridge.  Paul Newman, Joanne
Woodward co-star as members of Kansas City's upper crust who, in their
inimitable way, either skate around or ignore brewing crises, which range from
uppity kids to world war. Adapted from the Evan S. Connell novels by Ruth
Prawer Jhabvala and directed by James Ivory, team behind "Maurice" and "A Room
with a View." Yes, it's episodic and deliberately paced, but the cumulative
impact can be compared to that of a good Ingmar Bergman movie. With Blythe
Danner, Diane Kagan in key supporting roles. Whimsical, melodrama-deflating
score by Richard Robbins. PG-13 (adult themes). (star)(star)(star)(star);   
The Nasty Girl.  Every German's complicity in Nazi war crimes is again
scrutinized in this Oscar nominee from Germany. Michael Verhoeven combines
whimsy, romance, dark comedy to show how his homeland's so-called "Economic
Miracle" is built on hypocrisy and lies. Lena Stolze plays an exuberant
Pollyanna whose research for a national essay contest unearths embarrassing
secrets about neighbors and Catholic Church officials. No MPAA rating (could
be PG-13). (star)(star)(star)(star);    The Never Ending Story II: The Next
Chapter.  More action-packed sequel to 1984 kiddie favorite inspired by
Michael Ende book. Bookworm Bastian (now played by Jonathan Brandis) returns
to parallel world of Fantasia to battle evil enchantress and adult empathy.
Falkor the luckdragon and Rock Biter return with a whole new menagerie of
characters. Less pretentious and better designed than its predecessor. Billed
with hilarious new Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoon, "Box Office Bunny." PG (OK
for family). (star)(star)(star);    Nothing But Trouble.  Dan Aykroyd's
delayed (and retitled) horror spoof co-stars Chevy Chase, Demi Moore as
wayfarers who run a stop sign in a grim burg called Valkenvania and, like
umpteen couples in the old-dark-house classics, find themselves the "guests"
of a monstrous host (Aykroyd under tons of peeling latex). Aspires to be
"National Lampoon's New Jersey Chainsaw Massacre" but is neither very funny
nor ghastly. PG-13 (profanity). (star);    Not Without My Daughter.  Sally
Field in compelling, if brazenly manipulative, adaptation of Betty Mahmoody
book about how, in mid-'80s, she and daughter were held hostage in Tehran by
her Iranian husband. Film is perfectly poised to feed on anti-Middle East
paranoia and predictably depicts Iran as world's most oppressive society.
PG-13 (too intense for children). (star)(star)(star);    Once Around.  Quirky,
beguiling little comedy about a Boston family, the gosling daughter and the
incredibly pushy salesman-suitor who disrupts their lives. "Always" co-stars
Richard Dreyfuss and Holly Hunter are re-teamed as the jerk-who-came-to-dinner
and the desperate-to-wed daughter. Danny Aiello, Gena Rowland are wonderful as
the amazed, then exasperated, parents. Nicely directed by Sweden's Lasse
Hallstrom ("My Life as a Dog") from a first script by Malia Scotch Marmo. R
(for profanity). (star)(star)(star);    The Rescuers Down Under.  Lightning
paced cliffhanger cartoon from Disney will put you in mind of Aussie-set
"Pinocchio" goosed up for the Indiana Jones generation. Sequel to '76 hit
reteams Bianca and Bernard, mice do-gooders who operate out of a United
Nations for rodents. Eva Gabor, Bob Newhart, John Candy, George C. Scott
supplied the voices. G. (star)(star)(star);    Run.  Old stranger-in-town idea
dusted off as extremely athletic workout for Patrick ("Loverboy") Dempsey,
who, delivering on the title, spends most of the picture dodging bullets and
bad guys. Nothing exceptional, but worthwhile for Dempsey's cocky performance
and well-handled action scenes. R (violence, profanity). (star)(star);    The
Russia House.  First-rate adaptation of John le Carre best-seller about boozy
publisher (Sean Connery) who's enlisted by British intelligence to win over
Russian who's telling all about his country's military shortcomings. Michelle
Pfeiffer is terrific as Connery's Moscow contact/love interest; Klaus Maria
Brandauer, Roy Scheider, James Fox co-star. Jerry Goldsmith's jazz score, like
everything else here, goes down like high-grade vodka. R (but could be PG-13)
for profanity. (star)(star)(star) 1/2;    The Sheltering Sky.  Seductive,
eye-filling adaptation of Paul Bowles' novel about bored Americans drifting
through post-war North Africa. Debra Winger, John Malkovich co-star as married
couple who debate our place in cosmos while bed-hopping from oasis to oasis.
Slow going but worthwhile for Vittorio Storaro's desert photography and
Ryuichi Sakamoto's brilliant score. Directed by Bernardo ("The Last Emperor")
Bertolucci. R (for nudity). (star)(star)(star);    The Silence of the Lambs. 
What could have been ride of the season becomes, under Jonathan Demme's almost
polite direction, a slavish, too-densely plotted adaptation of Thomas Harris
novel about a pair of dangerous sociopaths and the FBI trainee who uses one to
track the other. Jodie Foster is fine as novice agent who must suppress all
traces of femininity to earn respect in a man's profession; Anthony Hopkins,
typically, overdoes it, turning the caged Dr. Lecter into a hissing,
reptilian-slippery wacko. R (violence, gruesome makeup effects). (star)(star)
1/2;    Sleeping with the Enemy.  Julia ("Pretty Woman") Roberts returns as
abused wife who stages her own death, then takes a new identity in idyllic
Midwestern burg. Patrick Bergin, Kevin Anderson co-star as stalking husband
and new beau, respectively. Source novel took a stab at dealing with issue of
abused wife reassembling her life; movie reduces premise to slasher cliches.
Directed by Joseph ("True Believer") Ruben. R (violence, profanity).
(star)(star);    Three Men and a Little Lady.  Sequel to 1987 comedy hit about
all-thumbs bachelors and their infant ward trades on charm of original while
substituting clunky farcical situations. Tom Selleck, Steve Guttenberg, Ted
Danson reprise roles as shy architect, dopey cartoonish, womanizing actor. PG.

<TEXT>     Book of Love.  Another "Porky's"-type teen comedy, this one boasts
negligible distinction of being set in Scranton, Pa., during the '50s. Chris
Young, Keith Coogan play new kid in school and nerd sidekick. Director Robert
Shaye has fun bringing hero's daydreams to life, but overall this flashback
isn't hip enough by half. PG-13. (star) 1/2;    Bride of Re-Animator.  More
"morbid doodling" by Dr. Herbert West, whose iridescent-green serum brought
army of cadavers back to twitching life in 1985's "Re-Animator." Broader,
campier than original, but still lots of fun gross-outs, such as when
five-fingered what's-it escapes from basement lab. Jeffrey Combs, Bruce Abbott
reprise their roles as the Ivy League Frankenstein and reluctant, love-smitten
assistant. R (nudity, gruesome makeup effects.) (star)(star)(star);    Class
Action.  Gene Hackman, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio team up as father-daughter
San Francisco lawyers arguing opposite sides of corporate-negligence case.
Melodramatic generation-conflict script comes to thudding halt with
preposterous courtroom showdown. Save yourself the cash: Check out "L.A. Law"
on an off night. R (profanity). (star) 1/2;    Cyrano de Bergerac.  Edmond
Rostand's oft-told tale of bravery, balcony deceit and the nose "that launched
a thousand ships" gets glorious, cast-of-thousands treatment in this robust
French adaptation. Gerard Depardieu stars as famed swordsman, poet and
braggart; Anne Brochet, Vincent Perez play Roxane and Christian, the young
lovers. Beautifully designed, choreographed and directed. PG (violent
swordplay). (star)(star)(star)(star);    Dances with Wolves.  Kevin Costner's
sprawling tribute to the vanishing frontier is old-fashioned epic movie-making
at its best. Borrowing from William Wyler and Akira Kurosawa, Costner has
created a rich tapestry of adventures among the Sioux Indians, circa 1865.
PG-13 (for violence). (star)(star)(star)(star);    The Doors.  Oliver Stone's
frenzied, if simplistic, portrait of rocker Jim Morrison and the band that
defined moody sensuality of the '60s with "Light My Fire," "Riders on the
Storm," etc. Val Kilmer electrifies in later concert re-enactments. An
ambitious undertaking that comes closer than most rock biopix to capturing
spirit of times. R (profanity, nudity). (star)(star)(star);    Edward
Scissorhands.  Or: Hans Christian Andersen Meets Frankenstein.
"Batman"/"Beetlejuice" creator Tim Burton here delivers a quirky,
sweet-natured fable about a man-made boy who wasn't quite finished by his
inventor. Johnny Depp brings Chaplinesque poignancy to title role. PG-13
(violence; may be too intense for some children). (star)(star)(star) 1/2;   
Ghost.  An undisciplined mix of sappy romance and supernatural comedy, this
movie about a murdered lover (Patrick Swayze) trying to contact his girlfriend
(Demi Moore) with the help of an outrageous medium (Whoopi Goldberg) has some
very good moments. Rated PG-13 (brief profanity, violence). Reviewed by Tom
Sabulis. (star)(star) 1/2;    The Godfather III.  Francis Coppola picks up
story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) in late '70s, as family seeks
respectability through Vatican business ventures. Standing in the way are
Sonny Corleone's hot-headed son (Andy Garcia) and old-style Mafioso rivals who
still live by the gun. Beautifully mounted with Oscar-worthy cinematography,
but overall it's downbeat, derivative. R (violence, profanity). (star)(star)
1/2;    Green Card.  Sparkling interplay between France's Gerard Depardieu and
Andie MacDowell turn what could have been fluff piece into a very spirited and
surprising comedy-romance. Depardieu plays ne'er-do-well composer who weds
MacDowell to confound immigrations and stay in New York. Directed, scripted by
Australia's Peter Weir. PG-13. (star)(star)(star);    The Grifters.  Gritty,
downbeat Jim Thompson's novel about trio of con artists who out-con themselves
becomes buoyant, sexy film-noir caper in British director Stephen ("Dangerous
Liaisons") Frears' hands. Anjelica Huston (now a peroxide blonde), John
Cusack, Annette Bening star as catty mother, unlucky son and conspiring
girlfriend. R (nudity, profanity, violence). (star)(star)(star) 1/2;    Guilty
by Suspicion.  Clunky, old-fashioned melodrama about hot-shot director (Robert
De Niro) who's blacklisted for refusing to "name names" at the McCarthy
witch-hunt hearings. Surprisingly tame, given the incendiary material. Annette
Bening, George ("Cheers") Wendt co-star as De Niro's ex-wife and turncoat
friend. Directed, written by Irwin Winkler. PG-13 (slight profanity). (star)
1/2;    Hamlet.  Franco Zeffirelli, who popularized the Bard's "Romeo and
Juliet" in the '60s, returns with a robust, albeit severely pared down,
version of Shakespeare's most famous tragedy. Mel Gibson shows new range and
depth as a now mostly seething Prince of Denmark, determined to trap his
father's assassins. Glenn Close, Alan Bates, Paul Scofield, Ian Holm and
Helena Bonham-Carter co-star. Handsome production that stirs the senses
without taxing the gray matter. PG (violent swordplay). (star)(star) 1/2;   
The Hard Way.  Neat idea (obnoxious Hollywood star tails New York cop for
"research") is turned into proficient, occasionally laugh-out-loud-funny
comedy thanks to energetic, self-parodic performances by James Woods and
Michael J. Fox and typical whiz-bang direction by John ("Stakeout") Badham.
Alas, central antagonism goes soft and mushy. R (violence, profanity).
(star)(star) 1/2;    He Said, She Said.  Kevin Bacon, Elizabeth Perkins are
rival Baltimore journalists who become popular point/counterpoint TV
commentators -- until their romantic involvement takes its toll. A
sparkling-to-morose roundelay. The paranoid fantasies are fairly hilarious,
but instead of upending sexual stereotypes, they are reinforced. PG-13 (slight
profanity, nudity). (star)(star) 1/2;    Home Alone.  Macaulay Culkin, the
cherubic wiseacre of "Uncle Buck," plays an accidentally abandoned 8-year-old
who protects hearth and home from a pair of bungling burglars on Christmas
eve. PG (slight profanity). (star)(star) 1/2;    If Looks Could Kill.  Nifty
espionage comedy starring likable Richard Grieco as high-school ne'er-do-well
who, during summer in Paris, is mistaken for a CIA operative. Linda Hunt,
Roger Rees have fun with the delightfully churlish archenemies intent on (you
got it!) world domination. Surprisingly fun, good-natured OO7 spoof. PG-13
(slight profanity). (star)(star) 1/2;    Ju Dou.  Controversial Oscar nominee
from China charts downfall of star-crossed lovers. Li Bao-Tian, Gong Li
co-star as laborer and "aunt" who bear a child every bit as autocratic and
unfeeling as the master/boss they attempt to con. Breathtakingly beautiful in
design, conception, but re-cycled film-noir plot bogs down all too quickly.
Directed by Zhang Yi-Mou. Exclusively San Francisco's Gateway. No MPAA rating
(could be PG-13 for adultery plot). (star)(star)(star);    Kindergarten Cop. 
"Twins" collaborators Ivan Reitman and Arnie Schwarzenegger reteam for a
clever amalgam of cop thriller and kiddie comedy. Arnie plays obsessed cop who
goes undercover as substitute teacher to ferret out (quite literally) the son
and estranged wife of a killer. PG-13 (may be too intense for children under
6). (star)(star) 1/2;    King Ralph.  John Goodman stars in a slap-sticky
comedy that never deviates from the obvious but is occasionally funny in spite
of itself. Ralph is a lounge singer who finds himself the next in line for the
British throne. Peter O'Toole walks through his role as the royal adviser. No
surprises here, but harmless and hilarious. PG (for profanity). Reviewed by
Knight-Ridder News Service. (star)(star)(star);    L.A. Story.  Steve Martin
shares his love/hate feelings for La La Land in this loony, romantic fable
that owes more of a debt than Martin cares to acknowledge to Fellini and Woody
Allen. Such obvious targets as health spas, freeway gridlock, happy-talk news
come under assault. Martin, who also scripted, co-stars with wife Victoria
Tennant and an all-knowing electronic freeway sign. PG-13 (profanity, comic
lovemaking). (star)(star);    The Nasty Girl.  Every German's complicity in
Nazi war crimes is again scrutinized in this Oscar nominee from Germany.
Michael Verhoeven combines romance, dark comedy to show how his homeland's
so-called "Economic Miracle" is built on hypocrisy and lies. Lena Stolze plays
an exuberant Pollyanna whose research for a national essay contest unearths
embarrassing secrets. No MPAA rating (could be PG-13).
(star)(star)(star)(star);    New Jack City.  Mario van Peebles directs the
story of a solitary cop who devotes his life to squashing drug dealers, and a
dealer so powerful he seems unsquashable. The two square off. R (for violence,
profanity, brief nudity, sex). Reviewed by Knight-Ridder Newspapers.
(star)(star)(star);    The Neverending Story II: The Next Chapter.  More
action-packed sequel to 1984 kiddie favorite inspired by Michael Ende book.
Bookworm Bastian (now played by Jonathan Brandis) returns to parallel world of
Fantasia to battle evil enchantress and adult empathy. Less pretentious and
better designed than its predecessor. PG (OK for family). (star)(star)(star); 
  Not Without My Daughter.  Sally Field in compelling, if brazenly
manipulative, adaptation of Betty Mahmoody book about how, in mid-'80s, she

parents. R (for profanity). (star)(star)(star);    The Rescuers Down Under. 
Lightning-paced cliffhanger cartoon from Disney will put you in mind of
Aussie-set "Pinocchio" goosed up for the Indiana Jones generation. Sequel to
'76 hit reteams Bianca and Bernard, mice do-gooders who operate out of a
United Nations for rodents. G. (star)(star)(star);    Robot Carnival. 
Animated anthology from Japan that has moments of inspiration (the wrap-around
sequence, Takashi Nakamura's "Nightmare") but, overall, is on a par with
trashy Saturday-morning superhero cartoons. "Starlight Angel" short, crammed
with Ken and Barbi facsimiles, is particularly hard to take. San Jose's Towne
Theater. No MPAA rating (could be PG-13 for scenes of apocalypse).
(star)(star);    Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.  Tom Stoppard's
note-perfect, surprisingly visual adaptation of his own award-winning play,
which proffers worm's-eye view of doings at Elsinore castle as Hamlet plots
death of his father's killers. Gary Oldman, Tim Roth couldn't be better as the
title players who muddle on despite suspicion that they don't exist beyond
confines of Shakespeare's narrative. Richard Dreyfuss co-stars as lead Player
(aka Fate). PG. (star)(star)(star)(star);    Scenes From a Mall.  Woody Allen,
Bette Midler as husband and wife who learn of one another's infidelities on an
anniversary shopping trip. Allen appears distracted, and Midler seems muzzled
in this so-what satire by Paul Mazursky ("Down and Out in Beverly Hills"), who
has nothing new to say so rehashes all the old car-phone, beeper and sushi
jokes in yet another lame attempt at trashing La La Land. R (for profanity).
(star) 1/2;    The Silence of the Lambs.  What could have been ride of the
season becomes, under Jonathan Demme's almost polite direction, a slavish,
too-densely plotted adaptation of Thomas Harris novel about a pair of

gruesome makeup effects). (star)(star) 1/2;    Shipwrecked.  Crude but
entertaining return to "Treasure Island" territory, compliments of Disney.
Norway's Stian Smestad plays gung-ho youth who becomes more of a Rambo than
Robinson Crusoe when washed ashore on South Seas island; Gabriel Byrne fumes a
lot as pirate stand-in for Long John Silver. Shot in Fiji and Spain. PG.
(star)(star) 1/2;    Sleeping with the Enemy.  Julia ("Pretty Woman") Roberts

got it!) world domination. Surprisingly fun, good-natured OO7 spoof. PG-13
(slight profanity). (star)(star) 1/2;    Iron &amp; Silk.  Mark Salzman plays
himself, a gee-whiz American abroad, in this romanticized flashback to
mainland China on the eve of Tiananmen Square. Pan Quingfu also appears as
himself, a bulldog of a martial-arts teacher. With Jeanette Lin Tsui as
Salzman's guide to the customs and etiquette of China. Corny, picturesque and
quite entertaining. No MPAA rating (OK for family viewing).
(star)(star)(star);    Ju Dou.  Controversial Oscar nominee from China charts
downfall of star-crossed lovers. Li Bao-Tian, Gong Li co-star as laborer and
"aunt" who bear a child every bit as autocratic and unfeeling as the
master/boss they attempt to con. Breathtakingly beautiful in design,
conception, but re-cycled film-noir plot bogs down all too quickly. Directed
by Zhang Yi-Mou. Exclusively San Francisco's Gateway. No MPAA rating (could be
PG-13 for adultery plot). (star)(star)(star);    Kindergarten Cop.  "Twins"
collaborators Ivan Reitman and Arnie Schwarzenegger reteam for a clever
amalgam of cop thriller and kiddie comedy. Arnie plays obsessed cop who goes
undercover as substitute teacher to ferret out (quite literally) the son and
estranged wife of a killer. PG-13 (may be too intense for children under 6).
(star)(star) 1/2;    L.A. Story.  Steve Martin shares his love/hate feelings
for La La Land in this loony, romantic fable that owes more of a debt than
Martin cares to acknowledge to Fellini and Woody Allen. Such obvious targets
as health spas, freeway gridlock, happy-talk news come under assault. Martin,
who also scripted, co-stars with real-life wife Victoria Tennant and an
all-knowing electronic freeway sign. PG-13 (profanity, comic lovemaking).
(star)(star);    The Long Walk Home.  The 1955 bus boycott in Montgomery,
Ala., is dramatized in this excellent character study co-starring Sissy Spacek
and a never-better Whoopi Goldberg as a suburban do-gooder and her quietly
resentful black maid. Both are forced to re-think their priorities when their
families are threatened in different ways. Credit Richard ("Heartland") Pearce
with the strong, understated direction. One of the year's best! PG (for slight
violence). (star)(star)(star) 1/2;    The Nasty Girl.  Every German's
complicity in Nazi war crimes is again scrutinized in this Oscar nominee from
Germany. Michael Verhoeven combines whimsy, romance, dark comedy to show how
his homeland's so-called "Economic Miracle" is built on hypocrisy and lies.
Lena Stolze plays an exuberant Pollyanna whose research for a national essay
contest unearths embarrassing secrets. No MPAA rating (could be PG-13).
(star)(star)(star)(star);    New Jack City.  Mario van Peebles directs the
story of a solitary cop who devotes his life to squashing drug dealers, and a
dealer so powerful he seems unsquashable. The two square off in a ghetto
battle for the hearts, minds and crack-wracked bodies of New Jack City. The
film moves forward with single-minded determination. Van Peebles should have
found more proficient actors for supporting parts (himself included), but
Ice-T has rough grace and Judd Nelson sheds all mannerisms to play a
dead-eyed, dead-ended cop. R (for violence, profanity, brief nudity, sex).
Reviewed by Knight-Ridder Newspapers. (star)(star)(star);    The Neverending
Story II: The Next Chapter.  More action-packed sequel to 1984 kiddie favorite
inspired by Michael Ende book. Bookworm Bastian (now played by Jonathan
Brandis) returns to parallel world of Fantasia to battle evil enchantress and
adult empathy. Falkor the luckdragon and Rock Biter return with a whole new
menagerie of characters. Less pretentious and better designed than its
predecessor. Billed with hilarious new Bugs Bunny-Daffy Duck cartoon, "Box
Office Bunny." PG (OK for family). (star)(star)(star);    The Rescuers Down
Under.  Lightning-paced cliffhanger cartoon from Disney will put you in mind
of Aussie-set "Pinocchio" goosed up for the Indiana Jones generation. Sequel
to '76 hit reteams Bianca and Bernard, mice do-gooders who operate out of a
United Nations for rodents. Eva Gabor, Bob Newhart, John Candy, George C.
Scott supplied the voices. G. (star)(star)(star);    Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead.  Tom Stoppard's note-perfect, surprisingly visual
adaptation of his own award-winning play, which proffers worm's-eye view of
doings at Elsinore castle as Hamlet plots death of his father's killers. Gary
Oldman, Tim Roth couldn't be better as the courtier/chumps of title who muddle
on despite suspicion that they don't exist beyond confines of Shakespeare's
narrative. Richard Dreyfuss co-stars as lead Player (aka Fate). Beautifully
designed, photographed. Much superior to Zeffirelli's recent "Hamlet." PG.
(star)(star)(star)(star);    The Silence of the Lambs.  What could have been
ride of the season becomes, under Jonathan Demme's almost polite direction, a
slavish, too-densely plotted adaptation of Thomas Harris novel about a pair of
dangerous sociopaths and the FBI trainee who uses one to track the other.
Jodie Foster is fine as novice agent who must suppress all traces of
femininity to earn respect in a man's profession; Anthony Hopkins, typically,
overdoes it, turning the caged Dr. Lecter into a reptilian wacko. R (violence,
gruesome makeup effects). (star)(star) 1/2;    Shipwrecked.  Crude but
entertaining return to "Treasure Island" territory, compliments of Disney.
Norway's Stian Smestad plays gung-ho youth who becomes more of a Rambo than
Robinson Crusoe when washed ashore on South Seas island; Gabriel Byrne fumes a
lot as pirate stand-in for Long John Silver. Shot in Fiji and Spain. PG.
(star)(star) 1/2;    Sleeping with the Enemy.  Julia ("Pretty Woman") Roberts
returns as abused wife who stages her own death, then takes a new identity in
idyllic Midwestern burg. Patrick Bergin, Kevin Anderson co-star as stalking
husband and new beau, respectively. Source novel took a stab at dealing with
issue of abused wife reassembling her life; movie reduces premise to slasher
cliches. Directed by Joseph ("True Believer") Ruben. R (violence, profanity).
(star)(star);    Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze. 
Those Heroes in the Half-Shells return in broader, funnier sequel to the 1990
hit. Parents will applaud decision to downplay the violence while lamenting
the non-existent plot. With San Jose's Ernie Reyes Jr. as Turtles' new human
ally, David Warner as the all-thumbs professor who deals in toxic waste, and
some fun surprises from Jim Henson's Creature Shop. PG (may be too intense for
some children). (star)(star)  </TEXT>

   NEW YORK -- Orion Pictures Corp., still seeking cash to
ease a liquidity crunch, reported the biggest box office
weekend in its history, grabbing about 25% of the market.
   Orion said its four films -- "Dances With Wolves,"
"Silence of the Lambs," "Mermaids" and "Alice" -- grossed an
estimated $20.9 million. Although final figures aren't in
until today, entertainment data concern Baseline Inc. said
Orion may have inched past Fox Film, a unit of News Corp.,
which has been the industry box office leader for several
weekends.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Most of Orion's revenue came from "Dances With Wolves,"
which was nominated for twelve Academy Awards including Best
Picture last week; it grossed about $6.2 million last weekend
for an estimated total of about $111.7 million. Orion appears
to have another big hit with "Silence of the Lambs," which
has grossed an impressive $13.7 million since its opening
last Thursday.
   But despite its current success, the company still needs
operating funds to carry it through the year. Orion is
attempting to raise $75 million to $100 million by selling
rights to five films that are in production or finished.
   Longer-term, Orion is also seeking to raise funds from a
new equity investor. Billionaire John Kluge, who controls 70%
of Orion, recently provided $23 million in cash in return for
a big cut of profits from "Mermaids," and possibly "Silence
of the Lambs."

<LEADPARA>  BROADWAY lights up this fall, thanks to producers Jimmy Nederlander and Stan

This all new state-of-the-art burlesque will star Jerry Lewis, Chita Rivera
and Rip Taylor. Ralph Allen, who co-conceived the original, will direct. Scott
Salmon will choreograph.;    The show is to tour L.A. and San Francisco before
finally settling in at the Minskoff in New York. You may recall that "Sugar
Babies" starred Mickey Rooney and Ann Miller. Opening in October 1979, it
played 1,036 performances at the Mark Hellinger, successfully toured the U.S.
and England and totally revitalized the careers of Rooney and Miller. (Lest we
forget, the last time Lewis was Broadway bound, in "Hellzapoppin," all that
came out of it was a collector's-item poster of a show that didn't happen.)  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>      WEDDING SHEDDING: Now that 600 people who were planning to be on the Fox
lot Friday for the wedding of Julia Roberts and Kiefer Sutherland have nothing
whatsoever to do, let's think on this interesting cancellation.;    Believe it
or not, there are many who have sighed great big sighs of relief that the
marriage has been "postponed by mutual consent." Roberts is under incredible
pressure at the moment -- both from her burgeoning fame and from her enormous
workload. (She now commands $7 million per film, and she's expected to
deliver.) This has to mean that Sutherland is also under incredible pressure.
Roberts needs to take that planned year's hiatus from work before she makes a
major marital decision; after all, she is only 23 years old.;    HARD-WORKING
HANNIBAL: Anthony Hopkins' hypnotic and terrifying performance in the smash
hit "The Silence of the Lambs" is a shoo-in for Oscar consideration next year.
But Hopkins has many projects on his plate before he can even think about that
much-hoped-for sequel to "Lambs" and a reprise of the sinister Hannibal
Lecter.;    The actor is in England now, filming "Howard's End" with Vanessa
Redgrave. (This is the Merchant-Ivory production from yet another novel by
E.M. Forster. Their movie based on the same author's "A Room With a View" was
a great success.) And Hopkins is currently in negotiation to star as the
vampire-hunting scholar, Prof. Van Helsing, in Francis Ford Coppola's new
version of "Dracula," for which Winona Ryder has already been signed.; From
Marilyn Beck and Stacy Jenel Smith in Hollywood;    REVOLVING DOOR: Looks like
Julia Duffy, who's bowed out of ABC's "Baby Talk," will be joining the
"Designing Women" cast. Meanwhile, practically everything about "Baby Talk" is
being changed -- with the exception of the twin infants who play the baby, and
Tony Danza, who narrates their voices. Auditions are taking place week for a
replacement Duffy. And Saul Turtletaub, one of the new executive producers,
says new writers have been hired and a fresh batch of supporting players will
be cast. "We'll be moving the action from the loft to an apartment building
and adding neighbors, a building supervisor, and possibly a boss."  </TEXT>

   Paul Newman turns 65 today, and workers
at his food company, Newman's Own, plan to make sure he doesn't
ignore it.
   They were busy making a huge popcorn cake to present to the
actor today.
   ``I think he's just going to avoid his birthday,'' said author
A.E. Hotchner, executive vice president of Newman's Own and a good
friend of Newman's.
   The recipe for the cake comes straight from Newman's Own Gourmet
Popcorn Recipe Book, a book put out by Newman's food company. The
company also has recipes for salad dressing, lemonade and spaghetti
sauce.
   The cake was baked, or rather popped, Thursday at the company's
Westport headquarters.
   ``It's growing by leaps and bounds,'' Hotchner said late
Thursday.
   Hotchner said the goal is to make a cake as tall as Newman.
   ``We'll submit the measurements to the Guinness Book of World
Records to ensure Mr. Newman's immortality,'' he said.

   Instead of staying up to watch the
American Music Awards, Bill Pettaway set the timer on his
videocassette recorder and dropped off to sleep. His slumber didn't
last long.
   Toward the end of this week's three-hour program, a caller woke
him up to say that ``Girl, You Know It's True,'' which he co-wrote
for Milli Vanilli, had been named the pop-rock single of 1989.
   A few hours later, after congratulatory calls from all over the
world, the 29-year-old was back at his ``day job,'' pumping gas at
a service station.
   ``The excitement's over for me,'' he said Wednesday, less than
48 hours after winning the award.
   It was a typical reaction from Pettaway, who said the secret of
his success is not to let success change him.
   ``I've been successful and happy my entire life, and even if I
didn't have a hit record, I'd still be happy,'' he said.
   Pettaway co-wrote ``Girl, You Know It's True'' with Ky Adeyemo.
Milli Vanilli's version has sold 2.5 million copies worldwide.

   The Rev. Billy Graham says the political
upheaval in Eastern Europe is overshadowing another revolution
there _ a surge in Christian faith.
   ``This is something new,'' said the 71-year-old evangelist.
``They have a freedom to talk and preach and have Bible classes.
   ``They are beginning to print thousands of Bibles in the Soviet
Union, and in many places I understand that Sunday schools are
being opened, which have been forbidden through all these years.
They've had 70 years in which none of these things happened.''
   Graham said the growing religious fervor in Eastern Europe was
evident in July when 100,000 packed a stadium in Budapest, Hungary,
to hear him.
   ``Our largest crowds were in Romania, where we went from city to
city,'' he said. ``Some people feel this is a demonstration not
only of the spiritual hunger but also the desire of the people for
more freedom.''
   Graham preached in cathedrals throughout the Soviet Union in
1988 during a celebration of 1,000 years of Christianity in that
country.

   Filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola and one
of his film companies sought bankruptcy protection from creditors,
but his filming of the third ``Godfather'' movie continued in Rome.
   Coppola and Zoetrope Productions filed separately Thursday in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Rosa under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Act. That allows them freedom from creditors' lawsuits
while they try to work out a repayment plan.
   Zoetrope issued a statement saying the filings were intended to
provide protection from continued legal wrangling that began during
production of Coppola's 1981 film ``One From the Heart,'' a $26
million picture that drew just $1 million at the box office.
   The filings were made while Coppola was in Rome, directing ``The
Godfather Part III'' for Paramount Pictures. The $40 million movie
was on budget and unaffected by the bankruptcy filings, Paramount
senior vice president Deborah Rosen said.
   Coppola did not total his assets or liabilities in his filing.

   For actor Anthony Hopkins, the chance to
direct a one-man play about poet Dylan Thomas is an opportunity to
reconnect with his heritage.
   Hopkins will direct ``Dylan Thomas: Return Journey,'' featuring
Bob Kingdom based upon the Welsh poet's work, anecdotes and
letters. The show makes its U.S. debut Feb. 16 in Pittsburgh.
   ``I'd always wanted to play Dylan Thomas myself, being Welsh,''
Hopkins said. ``When I heard Bob Kingdom was doing it, I didn't
have any resentment. I thought, `Well, I'm a bit too old to do it
now.'''
   The show will first play to British audiences, then come to
Pittsburgh and New York.
   Hopkins was in Pittsburgh on Thursday, where he is filming ``The
Silence of the Lambs.'' He stars in the psychological thriller with
Jodie Foster.
   Hopkins, 52, has performed in numerous Shakespeare plays and
starred in the films ``War and Peace,'' ``The Bunker'' and ``The
Elephant Man.''

   Actress Martha Raye was in fair condition
while undergoing therapy at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center following
treatment for a stroke she suffered earlier this month, a spokesman
said.
   Miss Raye, 74, was admitted to the hospital on Jan. 5 after she
suffered the stroke at her home, fell, and broke four ribs,
hospital spokesman Ron Wise said Thursday.
   ``She is expected to be released sometime next week,'' he said.
``She has shown considerable improvement.''
   Miss Raye is best known to the younger viewers as a television
commercial spokeswoman, but her career includes several comic
movies including ``Four Jills in a Jeep'' ``Big Broadcast of
1938,'' ``Hellzapoppin'' and a role as a would-be murder victim in
Charlie Chaplin's ``Monsieur Verdoux.''
