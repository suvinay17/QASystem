   Police searched with tracker dogs and
helicopters but found no clues today to the theft of one of Vincent
van Gogh's ``The Potato Eaters'' and two other works by the Dutch
impressionist master.
   Monday night's burglary at the Kroeller-Mueller National Museum
appears to be Holland's biggest art theft. Also taken were the
19th-century Dutch master's ``Dried Sunflowers'' and ``Weaver's
Interior.''
   Police spokesman Karel van Seventer said the 30-strong task force
this morning abandoned its search of the national park that
surrounds the museum. They have no leads to the thieves' identities
or whereabouts of the oil paintings, he said.
   The burglars smashed an 8-foot square window to get into the
sprawling one-story museum, Seventer said. Two guards on duty in the
museum were not alerted. But the burglars triggered an alarm at Ede
police station, 10 miles away and police surrounded the park near
the West German border within minutes, he said. Nearby border posts
were alerted.
   There was no official estimate of Kroeller-Mueller's ``The Potato
Eaters,'' the second of three versions Van Gogh painted in 1885, and
the other two works, which were finished in 1887. All belong to the
state.
   Experts from Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses in Amsterdam
said the final and most important version of ``The Potato Eaters''
is on display in Amsterdam's Vincent van Gogh National Museum.
   The series marks one of Van Gogh's harshest expressions of
poverty and famine in the southern Netherlands where he was born.
Done in dark pigments, all three paintings show a peasant family
seated around a table and eating potatoes under a hanging lamp, with
suffering evident on their rough faces.
   Van Gogh is the world's best-selling artist. Five of his
paintings were on the list this month of the top 10 prices paid for
paintings at Christie's and Sotheby's. His painting ``Irises''
attracted the highest recorded price paid for a painting _ $53.9
million in 1987.
   ``What on earth can be the reason why to steal these paintings?''
asked Christie's Amsterdam director, Harts Nijstad. ``The answer can
only be, if you ask me, ransom money. Whether the ransom will be ...
moneywise or political is something the future will tell us.''
   Seventer said he believes the theft was committed by more than
one thief because of the size of the paintings.
   ``Wilted Sunflowers'' measures 40 inches by 24 inches, ``The
Potato Eaters'' is 37 by 29 inches and ``Weaver's Interior'' is 34
by 28 inches, according to the Culture Ministry.
   This morning, police began interviewing the museum management and
guards as well as five game keepers living inside the park grounds,
Seventer said.
   The Kroeller-Mueller museum is named for industrialist and art
lover Mrs. H.E.L.J. Kroeller-Mueller, who bequeathed it to the
nation in 1938. It contains 278 Van Gogh paintings, sketches and
etchings.
   Seventer said the Van Goghs, the centerpiece of the collection,
are housed in a separate wing 60 feet from the smashed window.

<HEAD>Portrait Painted One Month Before Artist's Suicide Goes On Sale</HEAD>

   A month before he killed himself, Vincent van
Gogh painted a portrait in blue of his innkeeper's young daughter.
   The girl, Adeline Ravoux, 13, was on the terrace of the cafe in
Auvers, a village outside Paris, when the artist returned from the
fields, his hands pressed to the bullet wound in his stomach. Two
days later, July 29, 1890, van Gogh died. He was 37 years old.
   On Wednesday, ``Portrait of Adeline Ravoux'' will offered for
sale at an auction of impressionist and modern paintings.
Christie's, the auction house, estimates that it will fetch more
than $15 million.
   Experts say interest in the portrait is keen in part because of
the story behind it.
   The adolescent girl who posed for the painting said in an essay
published in 1956 that she considered it ``somewhat of a
disappointment'' at first. But in her later years, Adeline Ravoux
Carrie said she finally came to appreciate its insight into her
character.
   Mrs. Carrie described van Gogh, who lived at her father's inn
during the last 2{ months of his life, as a disciplined artist and
``a soft and calm'' man who always smoked a pipe and enjoyed
playing with her little sister.
   She also recalled the last two days of the artist's life during
which he slowly succumbed to the fatal bullet.
   A doctor came to dress the wound, police officers arrived to
investigate the suicide and the artist's brother Theo arrived
running from the train station, his face ``distorted by grief,''
she wrote.
   The portrait being auctioned Wednesday is one of three versions
van Gogh painted. When last offered for sale, in 1980 at Sotheby's,
it brought $1.98 million from an anonymous buyer.
   Last year, three of van Gogh's paintings fetched record
multimillion- dollar prices that shocked the art world. The artist
sold almost nothing during his lifetime.
   In March 1987, van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' sold for $39.9 million
at Christie's in London to a Japanese firm, Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine
Insurance Co. Three months later, ``The Trinquetaille Bridge'' went
for $20.2 million, also at Christie's in London. It was bought by
an unidentified collector living in Switzerland.
   Then in November, history was made when van Gogh's ``Irises'' _
a richly-colored composition of purple flowers and green leaves set
off by a single white iris _ sold at Sotheby's in New York for
$53.9 million to an anonymous buyer. It was the highest price paid
at auction for any painting.
   John Rewald, the author of ``Post-Impressionism: From van Gogh
to Gauguin,'' has said of ``Irises'': ``If a museum could have one
painting by van Gogh, that's what it should get.''
   Michael Findlay, Christie's senior vice president, said he
didn't think ``Portrait of Adeline Ravoux'' would bring anywhere
near the price paid for ``Irises.''
   The special appeal of the portrait, aside from the painting
itself, is its link to van Gogh's last days, said Findlay.
   In the painting, Adeline, dressed in blue, sits in profile on a
chair. Her blond hair is tied with a blue ribbon, her gaze is
serene, her posture correct and her hands folded demurely in front
of her.
   ``He observed her very deeply, and when he came to paint her, he
painted both the grace and stiff awkwardness of an adolescent
girl,'' Findlay said. He used ``brief flashing strokes'' and
``astonishing'' color; the background is ``almost an electric blue,
a night blue,'' he said.
   Mrs. Carrie, who died in 1965 at age 88, had written: ``I admit
that I was only moderately satisfied with my portrait; it was
somewhat of a disappointment, for I did not find it was true to
life.'' But she also told an interviewer, ``Monsieur Vincent
divined not the young girl I was, but the woman I was to become.''
   Van Gogh gave the first of his three versions of the portrait to
the Ravoux family. More lifelike and detailed than the version up
for auction, it is now in a private collection in Switzerland. A
third version that shows only the face and whose colors are less
brilliant is owned by the Cleveland Museum of Art.

   Vincent van Gogh's portrait of his innkeeper's
teen-age daughter, who wrote a vivid account of the artist's death
decades after his suicide, was set to be auctioned Wednesday and
was expected to bring more than $15 million.
   ``Portrait of Adeline Ravoux,'' one of van Gogh's last
paintings, is included in a slate of impressionist and modern
paintings scheduled for sale at Christie's auction house.
   The picture of the 13-year-old girl was made a month before van
Gogh committed suicide in July 1890 in the village of Auvers
outside Paris. In an essay written when she in her 70s, Adeline
Ravoux Carrie described the artist's final hours as he lay in his
room at her father's inn, dying of a gunshot wound.
   Interest in the painting is keen, experts say, in part because
it serves as a link to the artist's last days. Christie's, the
auction house where the sale will take place, estimates the work
may fetch more than $15 million.
   The portrait last changed hands in 1980 when an anonymous buyer
purchased it at a Sotheby's auction for $1.98 million.
   Over the past 14 months, three of paintings by van Gogh _ who
sold almost nothing during his lifetime _ have fetched previously
unheard-of multimillion-dollar prices that shocked the art world.
   In March 1987, van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' sold for $39.9 million
at Christie's in London to a Japanese insurance company. Three
months later, ``The Trinquetaille Bridge'' went for $20.2 million,
also at Christie's in London. It was bought by an unidentified
collector in Switzerland.
   Then, in November, history was made when van Gogh's ``Irises,''
a composition of purple flowers and green leaves set off by a
single white iris, sold at Sotheby's in New York for $53.9 million
to an anonymous buyer, the highest price paid at auction for a
painting.
   In the painting auctioned Wednesday, Adeline, dressed in blue,
sits in profile on a chair. Her blond hair is tied with a blue
ribbon, her gaze is serene, her posture correct and her hands are
folded demurely in front of her. ``He observed her very deeply, and
when he came to paint her, he painted both the grace and stiff
awkwardness of an adolescent girl,'' said Michael Findlay, senior
vice president of Christie's and an expert on impressionist and
modern painting.
   But Mrs. Carrie, who died in 1965 at the age of 88, said in a
1956 essay that she didn't immediately appreciate the painting.
   ``I admit that I was only moderately satisfied with my portrait;
it was somewhat of a disappointment, for I did not find it was true
to life,'' Mrs. Carrie wrote.
   However, she was quoted in a 1953 interview as saying,
``Monsieur Vincent divined not the young girl I was, but the woman
I was to become.''
   Mrs. Carrie described van Gogh, who lived at her father's inn
during the last 2{ months of his life, as a disciplined artist and
``a soft and calm'' man who enjoyed playing with her baby sister.
   She described how a doctor and police were summoned after he
returned to the inn after shooting himself, and how his brother,
Theo, who was the artist's chief backer, came running from the
train station, his face ``distorted by grief.''
   Among the other artworks set to be auctioned Wednesday night are
works by Pierre Auguste Renoir, Mary Cassatt, Henri de
Toulouse-Lautrec, Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque.

VAN GOGH PAINTING SELLS AT RECORD $82.5 MILLION;

<P>
Vincent van Gogh's "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" stunned the art market Tuesday when 
it was auctioned for $82.5 million, shattering the world record price for a 
painting by more than $28 million. 
</P>
<P>
The price was double the estimate by Christie's, a spokeswoman for the auction 
house said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is by far the world's most expensive painting," surpassing the previous 
auction record of $53.9 million bid by Australian businessman Alan Bond for Van 
Gogh's "Irises" in November, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The money for Bond's bid was largely borrowed from Sotheby's, the house that 
handled the auction. The debt-ridden Bond was eventually forced to sell the 
painting for an undisclosed price to the J. Paul Getty Museum of Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified Japanese bidder was in the room during the about 10 minutes of 
bidding that opened at $20 million, Britman said. Toward the end of bidding, 
just two people were vying for the painting, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Portrait of Dr. Gachet" was painted six weeks before Van Gogh committed 
suicide in 1890. Dr. Paul-Ferdinand Gachet tended Van Gogh in the weeks before 
his death. 
</P>
<P>
The record price quashed all reports of an art market in recession after last 
week's disappointing contemporary sales. More than 35% of the works had gone 
unsold last week. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd gasped when the bidding reached $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
It had been expected to fetch between $40 million and $50 million at a sale of 
major works by Impressionist and Modern artists. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great painting," said Manhattan art dealer Richard Feigen. "It's by a 
rare artist. It's in fine condition. There are practically no paintings like it 
in private hands." 
</P>
<P>
After the bidding, which was tensely conducted between the Japanese dealer and 
a telephone bidder, the jam-packed gallery broke into a standing ovation, 
prompting auctioneer Christopher Burge to pound his gavel to control the house. 
</P>
<P>
The painting was lent to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1984. It is from the 
collection of Siegfried Kramarsky, a German-born New York banker who died in 
1961. It was put on the block by a trust created under his will. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to artist Paul Gauguin, Van Gogh wrote on June 16 that he had 
painted Gachet "with the heart-broken expression of our time" and that it was 
"not destined to be understood." 
</P>
<P>
Gachet, a practitioner of homeopathic medicine, was Van Gogh's friend and 
physician. He was also close to other Impressionist painters of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh painted a second, slightly larger version of the portrait, which hangs 
in the Musee d'Orsay in Paris. It lacks the details of the Kramarsky painting 
and its colors are flatter. 
</P>
<P>
Another Van Gogh from the Kramarsky collection was auctioned in 1987 for $20.24 
million. It too had been lent to the Metropolitan. 
</P>
<P>
The next-highest prices paid for paintings at the world's major auction houses 
are:

<TEXT>
   Vincent van Gogh's creative compulsions brought
little financial or emotional solace to the troubled Dutch
impressionist during his lifetime. But 100 years later, he is
unarguably the world's most popular painter.
   He enjoyed considerable acclaim among his fellow artists during
the late-1800s, and his influence was felt long after his death in
1890. However, experts disagree whether he sold only one work or
three or more during his life. Today, though, his works fetch
astronomical and record prices at art auctions around the world.
   A four-month extravaganza earlier this year in The Netherlands
commemorated the centennial of the painter's death with about 380
paintings and drawings on show at the Vincent van Gogh Museum in
Amsterdam and the Kroeller-Mueller Museum in Otterlo, and a film
festival and opera.
   Now comes Robert Altman's passionate portrait of the artist in
Hemdale Film's ``Vincent and Theo.'' It is a thoughtful, inspired
explosion of the emotions, fears and genius of the man who once
said that ``work distracts me infinitely better than anything
else.''
   Tim Roth (``A World Apart,'' ``The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and
Her Lover'') gives an intensely intelligent portrayal of the
artist. He rides the emotions well without slipping into
caricature. Paul Rhys (``Litte Dorrit,'' ``Lion Heart'') co-stars
Theo.
   It is the not the first time the film world has tackled the
complex life and personality of van Gogh.
   Altman's is a psychological vignette, rather than a full-fleshed
cinemagraphic biography, focusing on the special relationship the
artist had with his brother, Theo, an art dealer who nurtured
Vincent all his life. It is quite unlike Vincente Minnelli's
sprawling but inaccurate 1956 vision, ``Lust for Life,'' with Kirk
Douglas as van Gogh and Anthony Quinn as his one-time lover,
colleague and friend, Paul Gauguin.
   Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa also captures van Gogh in the
``Crows'' segment of his movie ``Akira Kurosawa's Dreams.'' It is a
tribute to the artist, who is portrayed by American director Martin
Scorsese.
   ``Dreams'' has eight segments and the central character
throughout is called ``I.'' In ``Crows,'' I is a grown man, a young
photographer looking at some of van Gogh's work. He eventually
finds himself in an open field with the artist, who proclaims,
``all of nature has its own beauty'' as he furiously fills page
after page.
   Van Gogh's most prolific period was 1888-89 when he painted
about 200 oils and did 100 drawings. From this passionate frenzy
emerged some of the most popular art works ever, van Gogh's
vibrantly colored sunflowers, fishing boats and pastoral scenes.
   During that same period in Provence, he wrote about 200 letters
to his brother, his sister, Gauguin and other artists.
   In a letter to Theo on April 9, 1888, he talks about one of his
favorite orchards on the outskirts of Arles, one he ultimately used
for a painting:
   ``I have another orchard, as good as the pink peach trees,
apricot trees of a very pale pink. At the moment I am working on
some plum trees; yellowish-white, with thousands of black branches.
I am using a tremendous lot of colours and canvases, but all the
same I hope it isn't a waste of money. ...''
   Van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853, in the southern Netherlands
village of Zundert. Life was a continual nightmare of poverty,
loneliness and periodic bouts of madness until he ended it after
firing a rifle into his chest on July 29, 1890.
   He rode an emotional rollercoaster between and during his
prolific outpouring of art. After he mutilated himself by cutting
off his right ear, he turned evangelical, saying the Bible had
ordered him to remove the ``ofending organ.''
   On May 8, 1889, van Gogh went to the asylum of
Saint-Paul-de-Mausole in Saint-Remy-de-Provence, a few miles north
of Arles. The doctor there wrote in the medical register that van
Gogh was suffering from ``acute mania with hallucinations of sight
and hearing. ...''
   The first canvas van Gogh did at Saint-Remy was ``Irises,'' a
dancing field of brilliant, violet flowers and a single white one.
``Irises'' set a record when Sotheby's sold it for $53.90 million
on Nov. 11, 1987. The painting subsequently was sold to the Getty
Museum in Malibu, Calif., after Australian tycoon Alan Bond could
not repay a loan Sotheby's had posted for the sale.
   The most expensive painting ever was van Gogh's ``Portrait of
Dr. Gachet,'' which sold this year for $82.5 million. The painting
in vivid blues and intense orange, was of the artist's friend, a
doctor who practiced homeopathic medicine.
   But it was ``The Starry Night'' that emerged as a cult favorite,
inspiring a song from pop artist Don McLean.
   ``The sky is blue-green, the water is royal blue, the soil is
mauve,'' van Gogh said in a letter to Theo describing the painting.
``On the blue-green field of the sky the Great Bear, sparkling
green and pink, a reflection whose modest shine contrasts with the
powerful gold of the gas light.''

THE BATTLE OF THE AUCTION HOUSES HEATS UP; 
</P>
<P>
ART: CHRISTIE'S HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL GUARANTEE A PRICE FOR A COLLECTION, 
MATCHING THE PRACTICE OF SOTHEBY'S.

The latest multimillion-dollar artworks to join the parade in New York's spring 
auctions are five modern and Impressionist paintings from the collection of the 
late Robert Lehman. A Vincent van Gogh self-portrait valued at $20 million to 
$30 million will go on the block at Christie's on May 15, along with paintings 
by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Amedeo Modigliani and Kees 
van Dongen. Sales of the five works are expected to total between $40 million 
and $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
In a move designed to sharpen its competitive edge against Sotheby's and 
reassure shareholders, Christie's has announced that it will guarantee the 
Lehman sale for an undisclosed price. In the past, Sotheby's has guaranteed a 
minimum price to some consignors -- setting off a storm of controversy in the 
art world -- but Christie's has resisted this practice. 
</P>
<P>
A press release announcing the Lehman sale says that the firm has had a 
"long-standing concern about the possible negative impact of guaranteed sales 
on the art market." However, "in certain cases" Christie's has "found it 
difficult to compete without offering guarantees," the prepared statement says. 
"The firm recognizes the need to maintain its prime position in the 
international art market, and to maintain a flexible and competitive attitude 
to market pressures created by the use of the guarantee by other auction 
houses." 
</P>
<P>
The two London-based houses are arch competitors, but lately Sotheby's 
aggressive tactics have pushed it ahead of Christie's. Sotheby's 1989 sales 
worldwide totalled $2.9 billion, while Christie's racked up about $2.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The Lehman auction features works from the collection of a New York financier 
who was a major donor to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Van Gogh 
self-portrait was painted in Arles, France, in early December, 1888, a year and 
a half before the Dutch master's death. The 18x15-inch painting, executed in 
Van Gogh's vigorous, mature style, is among the few works that the artist 
signed, according to the Park Avenue auction house. 
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh painted himself in a yellow jacket against a bright green background 
and dedicated the work to Charles Laval, an artist friend who had given him a 
self-portrait. Van Gogh's self-portrait was shown in "Van Gogh in Arles," a 
1984 blockbuster exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and it will be 
reproduced on the cover of a book on Van Gogh's self-portraits to be published 
by the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh in Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
Other paintings from the Lehman collection to be offered on May 15 are "Girl 
With Fur," an 1891 oil by Toulouse-Lautrec ($10 million to $15 million); 
Renoir's 1885 "Nude Seated" ($6 million to $8 million); Modigliani's 1917 
portrait of his mistress, Jeanne Hebuterne ($4 million to $6 million); and Van 
Dongen's "Young Lady Rider" ($700,000 to $1 million). 
</P>
<P>
While the Van Gogh self-portrait is likely to be the star of the Lehman sale, 
it is expected to be upstaged by another Van Gogh, "Portrait of Dr. Gachet," 
also offered on May 15 at Christie's. The 1890 portrait of Paul-Ferdinand 
Gachet, who treated Van Gogh in Auvers, is valued at $40 million to $50 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The auction record for a Van Gogh is $53.9 million, paid in 1987 for "Irises" 
by Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond. In that controversial and highly 
publicized sale, Bond borrowed half the purchase price from Sotheby's. His 
business fortunes subsequently took a plunge, forcing Bond to sell other works 
from his collection and consider unloading "Irises," the world's most expensive 
artwork.

   Police hunting burglars who stole
three Vincent van Gogh paintings said Tuesday they are hampered by
the size of the scene of the crime: a museum surrounded by the
country's biggest national park.
   Karel van Seventer said, however, the police's rapid response
apparently stopped the thieves taking a fourth painting by the 19th
century Dutch impressionist master.
   ``Weaver's Interior,'' which Seventer earlier identified as one
of the stolen works, was found lying on the floor of the room from
which the other three had disappeared, he said.
   In probably the biggest art theft in the Netherlands, thieves
Monday night broke into the Kroeller-Mueller museum and stole the
oil paintings ``The Potato Eaters,'' ``Wilted Sunflowers'' and ``The
Loom,'' Seventer said. Earlier, he wrongly identified the flower
painting as ``Dried Sunflowers.''
   Alerted by an alarm when burglars smashed a ground-floor window,
police rushed to the museum within minutes and sealed off the
12,350-acre expanse of forests, shrubs and heath of Hoge Veluwe
park, he said. Guards posted in the sprawling single-story museum
said they did not hear the thieves, he said.
   ``It all happened very fast ... We were acting on the assumption
that they were possibly still on the grounds right after the
alarm,'' Seventer told a news conference.
   ``The trouble was the grounds are 5,000 hectares large and made
up of difficult terrain,'' he said. The park has only three roads
accessible by motor vehicle.
   Two helicopter sweeps of the area, which normally is inhabited
only by five gamekeepers and their families, produced no clues.
Police used tracker dogs, also to no avail.
   No official valuation has been disclosed for the works, which
were not insured by the state because of the astronomical premiums
they would command. However, a Dutch art expert speculated ``The
Potato Eaters'' alone could be worth more than the $39.9 million
paid for van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' at a London auction last year.
   But it would be virtually impossible to sell it on the open
market.
   The spectacular theft was the second in seven months' involving
works by van Gogh and underscored relatively lax security at museums.
   In May, thieves broke into Amsterdam's Municipal Museum and stole
van Gogh's ``Carnations'' and two other impressionist paintings. All
three were recovered undamaged a few weeks later.
   Most officials declined to speculate on why the paintings were
stolen, since it would be virtually impossible to sell them on the
open market.
   However, Dutch Association of Museums spokesman R. Zijp said in a
Dutch TV interview that ``what's most likely is that they'll be held
to ransom, (in) a kind of kidnapping.''
   Van Seventer said no ransom demand had so far been made.
   In another TV interview, Culture Minister Elco Brinkman said
security at the country's national museums was being increased.
   But, ``You can't just go on pouring tens of millions of guilders
into it,'' Brinkman said. ``Some time you'll have to face the
question whether there aren't any better ways of spending that money
on culture.''
   The Kroeller-Mueller museum is named for Mrs. H.E.L.J.
Kroeller-Mueller, the art-loving wife of a prominent industrialist
who bequeathed it to the nation in 1938 with the surrounding park.
   The museum contains 278 van Gogh paintings, sketches and etchings.
   Kroeller-Mueller's ``The Potato Eaters'' is the second in a
series of three, with the final and most important painting on
display at Amsterdam's Vincent van Gogh National Museum.
   The 1885 works were painted in van Gogh's native village of
Nuenen and are among his most poignant expressions of famine and
hardship. Done in dark, harsh tones, they show a peasant family
eating potatoes, their faces lined by suffering and deprivation.

NETHERLANDS PLANS ELABORATE TRIBUTE FOR VAN GOGH ANNIVERSARY

Arranging the biggest-ever exhibition of Vincent van Gogh's paintings is taking 
on the complexity of a military operation. The plans include special 
precautions for transporting paintings from abroad, new security systems and 
huge sums of insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition next year to mark the 100th anniversary of the death of the 
tormented Dutch genius who committed suicide in France in 1890 will fill two 
museums and bring together, perhaps for the last time, some of Van Gogh's most 
famous paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the exhibition, operas, films and theater productions will be staged 
to celebrate the painter, who blossomed from youthful artistic somberness into 
an unrivaled master of color and light. 
</P>
<P>
The Dutch are budgeting $12.5 million for the anniversary celebrations and plan 
to bring in some 40 oil paintings and 120 sketches from abroad to supplement 
their own vast collections. 
</P>
<P>
Each painting from abroad will be wrapped in temperature-controlled packaging 
and each will be accompanied by an expert who must give written reports on the 
condition of the work before and after it travels. 
</P>
<P>
New electronic security systems have been put into the museums and more guards 
hired. Three Van Gogh's were stolen from the Kroeller-Mueller Museum in the 
Netherlands in December of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The works from abroad, coming from as far afield as Moscow's Pushkin Museum and 
New York's Museum of Modern Art, have been insured for a total of $3 billion -- 
believed to be the highest ever coverage to be taken out for an art exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Although he sold only one painting in his lifetime, Van Gogh's works today are 
among the most valuable in the world, fetching many millions of dollars at 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands already houses the world's two largest collection of his works 
-- at Amsterdam's Vincent Van Gogh Museum and at the smaller Kroeller-Mueller 
Museum in the eastern Hoge Veluwe National Park. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of the exhibit is to show works Van Gogh himself considered his 
best," said Frits Becht, managing director of the Van Gogh 1990 Foundation, 
which has been busy for two years organizing events. 
</P>
<P>
The Van Gogh Museum will be filled with some 120 oil paintings while the 
Kroeller-Mueller Museum will house 250 drawings in a joint exhibition from 
March 30 -- Van Gogh's birthday -- to July 29, the anniversary of his death. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not only the largest exhibit ever of his work, but it is probably the 
last time these works will be brought together, because it is complicated to 
bring them together and traveling is not good for paintings," said Becht. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit will include such famous works as "The Weaver," "The Potato 
Eaters," "The Sower," "Sunflowers," "The Night Cafe" and "The Yellow House." 
</P>
<P>
No more than 1,000 people will be allowed into each museum at a time to prevent 
too much humidity -- from humans and their clothing -- from harming the 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Becht expects some 1.4 million people, many of them from abroad, will 
see the exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
The high insurance is because Van Gogh's works have sold for record prices in 
recent years. His "Irises" fetched $53.9 million in November 1987, the highest 
price ever paid for a work of art. 
</P>
<P>
The centenary will also offer a chance to explore the artist through dramatic 
arts. 
</P>
<P>
Two operas -- one by Finnish composer Einojuhani Routavaara and another by 
Dutchman Jan van Vlijmen -- will focus on the painter, whose private life seems 
to have captured unparalleled public interest.

   One of Vincent van Gogh's last paintings before
his suicide, an 1890 portrait of his innkeeper's teen-age daughter,
sold at auction Wednesday for a disappointing $13.7 million.
   ``Portrait of Adeline Ravoux,'' sold at Christie's auction
house, was expected by art expects to bring $15 million.
   The anonymous buyer bid by telephone, paying the fourth highest
price at auction for a painting. The three highest prices were all
for Van Goghs.
   The picture of the 13-year-old girl was made a month before van
Gogh committed suicide at age 37 in 1890 in the village of Auvers
outside Paris. In an essay written when she was in her 70s, Adeline
Ravoux Carrie described the artist's final hours as he lay in his
room at her father's inn, dying of a gunshot wound.
   Interest in the painting was keen, experts had said before the
auction, in part because it serves as a link to the artist's last
days.
   But the standing-room-only crowd was still after the final bid;
there was no applause as is customary when a high price is paid for
an artwork in which interest has been expressed prior to the sale.
   ``Bidding wasn't too spirited. The price was disappointing,''
said Ellis Abraham, a New York attorney who was interested in
bidding for a client or himself.
   Auctioneer Christopher Burge, president of Christie's in
America, called the sale ``a wonderful price for a beautiful
picture.''
   The bidding started at $6 million. The $13.75 million included
the 10 percent commission paid to the auction house.
   The portrait last changed hands in 1980 when an anonymous buyer
purchased it at a Sotheby's auction for $1.98 million.
   Over the past 14 months, three of paintings by van Gogh _ who
sold almost nothing during his lifetime _ have fetched previously
unheard-of multimillion-dollar prices that shocked the art world.
   In March 1987, van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' sold for $39.9 million
at Christie's in London to a Japanese insurance company. Three
months later, ``The Trinquetaille Bridge'' went for $20.2 million,
also at Christie's in London. It was bought by an unidentified
collector in Switzerland.
   Then, in November, history was made when van Gogh's ``Irises,''
a composition of purple flowers and green leaves set off by a
single white iris, sold at Sotheby's in New York for $53.9 million
to an anonymous buyer, the highest price paid at auction for a
painting.
   In the painting auctioned Wednesday, Adeline, dressed in blue,
sits in profile on a chair. Her blond hair is tied with a blue
ribbon, her gaze is serene, her posture correct and her hands are
folded demurely in front of her. ``He observed her very deeply, and
when he came to paint her, he painted both the grace and stiff
awkwardness of an adolescent girl,'' said Michael Findlay, senior
vice president of Christie's and an expert on impressionist and
modern painting.
   But Mrs. Carrie, who died in 1965 at the age of 88, said in a
1956 essay that she didn't immediately appreciate the painting.
   ``I admit that I was only moderately satisfied with my portrait;
it was somewhat of a disappointment, for I did not find it was true
to life,'' Mrs. Carrie wrote.
   However, she was quoted in a 1953 interview as saying,
``Monsieur Vincent divined not the young girl I was, but the woman
I was to become.''
   Mrs. Carrie described van Gogh, who lived at her father's inn
during the last 2{ months of his life, as a disciplined artist and
``a soft and calm'' man who enjoyed playing with her baby sister.
   She described how a doctor and police were summoned after he
returned to the inn after shooting himself, and how his brother,
Theo, who was the artist's chief backer, came running from the
train station, his face ``distorted by grief.''
   At the same auction Wednesday, Alberto Giacometti's sculpture of
three walking men, ``Trois Hommes Qui Marchent,'' sold for $3.8
million, the most ever paid at auction for a 20th century sculpture.
   Pierre Renoir's painting ``L'Ombrelle'' of a woman sitting in a
garden with an umbrella in her hand brought $6.6 million.
   Mary Cassatt's painting ``The Conversation,'' of two women
talking to each other, sold for $4.51 million, a record for the
artist.

WHO'S AFRAID OF ART MARKET?; 
</P>
<P>
AUCTION: NOT ELIZABETH TAYLOR, WHO WILL SELL HER PRIZED VAN GOGH IN LONDON 
DESPITE AN UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC CLIMATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The economy looks so gloomy and the art market has flattened out so much that 
many prospective sellers of valuable artworks are waiting for a more propitious 
time to liquidate their treasures. 
</P>
<P>
Not actress Elizabeth Taylor. She has consigned her prized Vincent van Gogh 
painting, "View of the Asylum and the Chapel at Saint-Remy," to the auction 
block. The 1889 landscape is expected to bring between $16 million and $22 
million on Dec. 3 at Christie's London. The actress bought the painting for 
$257,600 at a London auction in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
If the selling price falls within the auction house's estimate, Taylor's 
painting will be among the most expensive Van Goghs to be sold at auction, but 
it won't approach a record. The highest auction price for a Van Gogh -- and for 
any artwork -- is $82.5 million, paid last May by Japanese paper manufacturer 
Ryoei Saito for "Portrait of Dr. Gachet." 
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh painted "View of the Asylum and the Chapel at Saint-Remy" a few months 
after he had committed himself to an asylum in Southern France. In a letter to 
his brother, Theo, the Dutch artist said that the painting celebrates nature 
with "autumn effects glorious in color, green skies contrasting with foliage in 
yellows, oranges, greens." 
</P>
<P>
Executed the year before Van Gogh committed suicide, the painting comes from 
the most vigorous and highly valued period of the artist's short career. The 
fact that "View of the Asylum and the Chapel at Saint-Remy" has been shown in 
prestigious museums around the world indicates that it is considered a notable 
example of his work. The Metropolitan Museum of Art included the landscape in 
the 1986-87 landmark exhibition, "Van Gogh in Saint-Remy and Auvers." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor bought the painting while she was married to actor Richard Burton. She 
had begun collecting art in the mid-'50s and had been looking for a Van Gogh 
for 12 years, according to the auction house. Her father, London art dealer 
Francis Taylor, reportedly advised the Burtons to go to Paris during the 
auction and to bid in secrecy to keep the price down. 
</P>
<P>
The Burtons hung the painting in their home in Gstaad, Switzerland, for several 
years. Later they remodeled their yacht Kalizma (named for Taylor's and 
Burton's children, Kate Burton, Liza Todd and Maria Burton) to accommodate the 
painting. The yacht, which was docked on the Thames River, was home to the 
Burtons on their frequent visits to London. They lived on board to circumvent 
British laws that prevented them from importing their pets. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor kept the painting after her divorce from Burton. In recent years she has 
displayed it in her home in Bel-Air. The actress declined to explain why she is 
selling the Van Gogh. An auction house official would only say that the 
consignment was "a personal decision." 
</P>
<P>
Although the auction forecast is bleak for the fall season, this is the second 
multimillion-dollar Van Gogh to be offered. Christie's New York will test the 
Van Gogh market on Nov. 14 when a 1890 still life, "Vase With Cornflowers and 
Poppies," goes on the block at an estimated price of $12 million to $16 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The Van Gogh market has gone wild in the past four years, starting with the 
sale of "Sunflowers" for $39.9 million to a Japanese insurance company on March 
31, 1987. Five and a half months later, on Nov. 11, 1987, "Irises" sold for 
$53.9 million to Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond. When Bond's financial 
empire subsequently tumbled, "Irises" was quietly put up for sale. The J. Paul 
Getty Museum in Malibu bought it earlier this year for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
The "Irises" record held until last May, when it was shattered by the 
astonishing sum of $82.5 million paid for "Portrait of Dr. Gachet." Among other 
Van Gogh paintings that have commanded more than $10 million at auction are 
"Bridge at Trinquetaille" ($20.24 million),"Portrait of Adeline Ravoux" ($13.75 
million) and "Romans Parisiens (Les Livres Jaune)" ($12.2 million).

   For a little over a year in
1888-89, Vincent van Gogh painted with a passionate frenzy,
producing about 200 oils and 100 drawings.
   From this creative compulsion emerged some of the most popular
works of art ever, van Gogh's vibrantly colored sunflowers, fishing
boats and country scenes.
   A blockbuster exhibit of his most famous artworks is the
centerpiece of a four-month extravaganza commemorating the 100th
anniversary of the Dutch impressionist's death. More than 380 van
Gogh paintings and drawings, insured for a record $3.1 billion, are
on display in two Dutch museums.
   They include ``Self Portrait With Bandaged Ear,'' ``Starry
Night'' and ``Night Cafe,'' as well as dozens of drawings so
vulnerable to light that they have never been shown in public,
according to the event's organizers.
   Along with the exhibit in Amsterdam's Vincent van Gogh Museum
and the Kroeller-Mueller Museum in the central Netherlands town of
Otterlo, the commemorative program includes a dozen other art
exhibitions, an opera and a film festival.
   Commemorative posters by 20 contemporary artists, including
Czechoslovak Jiri Kolar, Dutchman Willem de Kooning and American
Roy Lichtenstein have been run off to help offset the $11.5 million
exhibition cost.
   ``Lots of people can relate to van Gogh's artworks because
they're so full of color. But his life fascinates people, too,''
said Madeleine Wardenaar of the Van Gogh 1990 Foundation, which is
organizing the program. ``He's really the romantic artist, with
drama playing a part in every period of his life.''
   Born on March 30, 1853, in the southern Netherlands village of
Zundert, van Gogh struggled with poverty, loneliness and periodic
bouts of madness until he died after firing a rifle into his chest
on July 29, 1890.
   During his troubled life, van Gogh rode an emotional
rollercoaster. After he mutilated himself by removing his ear, he
said the Bible had instructed him to cut off the ``offending
organ.''
   One of his closest relationships was with the French painter
Paul Gauguin, with whom he had an affair. They spent endless hours
arguing.
   Van Gogh also was a voluminous letter writer. During that
444-day period in 1888-89, he wrote about 200 letters.
   In a Sept. 19, 1888, letter to his brother, Theo, van Gogh
describes ``Starry Night'':
   ``The sky is blue-green, the water is royal blue, the soil is
mauve. The city is blue and violet, the gas light yellow. ... On
the blue-green field of the sky the Great Bear, sparkling green and
pink, a reflection whose modest shine contrasts with the powerful
gold of the gas light. Two colorful figures of a lovers' couple on
the foreground.''
   The painting, in which the artist departed from his usual method
of applying small dots of contrasting colors on the cloth to form a
pattern, has bold, linear brush strokes.
   Van Gogh enjoyed considerable acclaim among his fellow artists
during his lifetime, but experts disagree whether he sold three
paintings or just one, according to Wardenaar.
   Today, his works fetch record prices at art auctions around the
globe. His ``Irises'' became the most expensive work ever auctioned
when Sotheby's sold it for $53.90 million on Nov. 11, 1987. The
painting subsequently was sold to the Getty Museum in Malibu,
Calif., after Australian tycoon Alan Bond could not repay a loan
Sotheby's had posted for the sale.
   ``Sunflowers'' went for $39.92 million in March 1987. ``The
Trinquetalle Bridge'' brought $20.24 million in a June 1987 auction.
   The van Gogh exhibit is expected to attract 1.5 million visitors.
   The Amsterdam museum, home of the world's largest van Gogh
collection, will display 135 paintings, including 80 borrowed from
museums and private collections in Paris, London, New York, Boston,
Moscow and Zurich. A total of 248 van Gogh drawings and watercolors
are going on display in the museum in Otterlo, 62 miles from the
Dutch capital.
   Despite the theft in Otterlo of three van Gogh paintings in
1988, the exhibit's organizers had little trouble getting the works
they wanted from foreign lenders, Wardenaar said.
   The stolen paintings, recovered unharmed several months later,
included an early version of van Gogh's famous ``The Potato
Eaters.'' Their total worth was estimated at more than $10.5
million.
   Security during transport and the exhibit itself is expected to
be extremely tight, although no details are being disclosed.
   Wardenaar said the huge insurance package is costing organizers
$2.1 million and will cover only the borrowed artworks. Those owned
by the Dutch museums are uninsured, in line with Culture Ministry
policy.
   The centenary exhibit is organized along the thematic lines that
van Gogh himself described in the hundreds of letters he wrote to
his brother from France, where he lived most of his life.
   ``He said quite explicitly in the letters how he wanted his
paintings displayed,'' Wardenaar said, adding the exhibit will
include some works in several versions in order to illustrate their
development.
   In an April 21, 1888, letter to the painter Emile Bernard, van
Gogh wrote from the southern French city of Arles:
   ``Here's a new `Orchard,' fairly simple in composition: a white
tree, a small green tree, a square bit of green, a purple patch of
soil, an orange roof, a large blue sky. I have nine more `Orchards'
coming: a white, a pink, an almost red, a blue-white, and pink and
gray, a green and a pink one. Yesterday, I botched a cloth: a
`Cherry Tree' against a blue sky, the sprouting leaves were orange
and gold, the flower clusters white: all that against the
blue-green of the sky. It was simply wonderful.''
   Also part of the centenary extravaganza is an opera by the Dutch
composer Jan van Vlijmen, ``Unhappy Man Dressed in Black,'' which
focuses on the final years of the artist's life.
   In the western city of Haarlem, there will be an exhibit of 75
works by the 17th century Dutch master Frans Hals, whom van Gogh
strongly admired, including works on loan from the National Gallery
in Washington and the Royal Academy in London. Several exhibitions
in Amsterdam and elsewhere will illustrate van Gogh's effect on
contemporary artists.
   The van Gogh anniversary also has attracted mass merchandising.
American Express is offering a van Gogh bust by Dutch artist Theo
Melchior. It sells for $490. There also are van Gogh wines,
after-shave lotion, T-shirts, watches and gold-framed prints of his
paintings for $630 each.
   Dutch companies sponsoring the van Gogh centenary are setting up
a ``Van Gogh Village'' to promote their products on Amsterdam's
Museum Square, although Wardenaar said everything was being done to
make the display as dignified as possible.
   The centenary exhibit runs through July 29. Tickets, on sale by
Ticketron in the United States, and available in some European
countries, sell for $12.50 each and must be ordered in advance.
They will give access to one of the museums at a specific time and
date, although visitors can then stay as long as they want.

<HEAD>Elizabeth Taylor's Van Gogh Painting Fails to Sell</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Vincent van Gogh painting owned by Elizabeth
Taylor failed to sell at auction when bidding did not reach the
minimum acceptable price.
   Bidding on ``View of the Asylum and Chapel at St. Remy'' started
at $9.6 million and reached $11.14 million, Christie's said, but
did not achieve the undisclosed reserve price. The auction house
had expected the painting to fetch between $15 million and $19
million.
   Painted in 1889, the work depicts the asylum where Vincent van
Gogh committed himself toward the end of his troubled life. The
actress bought it in 1963 for about $165,000.
   The demand for van Gogh's work has grown since 1987, when
``Sunflowers'' sold for about $40 million. The record price for a
van Gogh was about $57 million, paid for a ``Portrait of Dr.
Gachet'' in May.
   A Christie's spokesman said he believed the current world
economic climate was partly responsible for the failure of Miss
Taylor's painting to reach the minimum price, but added: ``There is
still a strong art market.''
   The painting was shown at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New
York, as part of a van Gogh exhibition in 1986-87.
   Miss Taylor did not attend the sale.

<HEAD>Van Gogh Painting Sells For $13.75 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE CROCKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Vincent van Gogh painting sold for $13.75
million, the fourth highest price paid at an auction, but the sale
disappointed a standing-room-only crowd after a string of record
prices for the artist's paintings.
   ``Portrait of Adeline Ravoux,'' which van Gogh finished shortly
before his suicide, sold at Christie's auction house Wednesday
night to an anonymous buyer who bid by telephone.
   Christie's had estimated van Gogh's 1890 portrait of his
innkeeper's 13-year-old daughter would bring $15 million, and the
reaction of the audience was subdued in contrast to the applause
that usually greets a record price.
   However, auctioneer Christopher Burge insisted afterward that
Christie's was not disappointed. ``It's a wonderful price for a
beautiful picture,'' he said.
   Daniel Varenne, an art dealer from Geneva, Switzerland, said he
was ``a little surprised'' that the painting fetched only $13.75
million. But he added the portrait was ``not an easy one to live
with'' and that may have affected the price.
   ``It's of a girl who's attractive but not that attractive. And
there's the possibility that the blue background is not that
appealing to a lot of people,'' he said.
   In the painting, Adeline, dressed in blue, sits in profile on a
chair. Her blond hair is tied with a blue ribbon, her gaze is
serene, her posture correct and her hands are folded demurely in
front of her. The background is a deep, midnight blue.
   The painting is the latest in a string of paintings by van Gogh,
who had trouble selling his art during his lifetime, to fetch a
record price.
   ``Irises'' last year brought $53.9 million, the highest price
ever paid at auction for a painting. The second and third highest
prices bid at an auction were also for van Gogh paintings.
   The portrait was one of 70 lots offered for sale at an auction
of impressionist and modern art that fetched $63,173,000. Eleven
works of art did not find buyers despite a packed house.
   The second highest bid Wednesday was $6.6 million paid by an
anonymous private collector for Pierre Renoir's ``L'Ombrelle,'' a
painting of a woman in a garden holding a parasol and bouquet of
violets.
   Mary Cassatt's, ``The Conversation,'' a pastel on paper of two
women talking to each other, sold for $4.51 million, a record for
the artist. Burge called it ``a beautiful picture'' and ``an
extreme leap forward by the artist.'' It was bought by an anonymous
private collector.
   The fourth highest bid was $4.4 million paid by an anonymous
private collector for Maurice de Vlaminck's ``Le Pont de Chatou,''
an oil on canvas in brilliant colors of a bridge across the Seine
River in France.
   Alberto Giacometti's 1940s sculpture of three skinny, walking
men, ``Trois Hommes Qui Marchent,'' sold for $3.85 million to an
anonymous buyer, the most ever paid at auction for a 20th century
sculpture.
   ``Portrait of Adeline Ravoux'' was one of three van Gogh did of
his innkeeper's daughter. The most lifelike and detailed of the
trio is in a private collection in Switzerland. The other, which
shows only the girl's face, is owned by the Cleveland Museum of Art.
   The picture was made a month before van Gogh committed suicide
at age 37 in 1890 in the village of Auvers outside Paris. In a 1956
essay, Adeline Ravoux Carrie wrote that she didn't immediately
appreciate her portrait.
   ``It was somewhat of a disappointment, for I did not find it was
true to life,'' wrote Mrs. Carrie, who died in 1965 at the age of
88.
   However, she was quoted in a 1953 interview as saying,
``Monsieur Vincent divined not the young girl I was, but the woman
I was to become.''

<DATELINE>OTTERLO, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three paintings by Vincent van Gogh,
including his early masterpiece ``The Potato Eaters,'' were stolen
from a national museum on Monday night, police said.
   The art theft appeared to be the biggest in Dutch history.
   The van Goghs were taken from the Kroeller-Mueller National
Museum near the West German border by thieves who apparently gained
entry through a broken window after closing hours, said police
spokeswoman Bep Lijftogt.
   The two other paintings by the 19th-century Dutch impressionist
were ``Dried Sunflowers'' and ``Weaver's Interior,'' she reported.
   Two guards were in the sprawling, single-story museum at the
time, but they noticed nothing amiss, said police spokesman Dirk
Talsma.
   Police immediately sealed off the 25-acre park in which the
museum sits. A helicopter equipped with floodlights and police with
dogs hunted for suspects on the heavily forested grounds.
   They suspended the search at 1 a.m. Tuesday and planned to resume
at daybreak.
   No official valuation of the paintings was available from the
museum, but the director of Christie's auction gallery in Amsterdam
said that if sold on the open market _ not possible for a stolen
work _ ``The Potato Eaters'' could bring as much as van Gogh's
``Sunflowers.''
   That painting brought $39.9 million when auctioned off in London
in March 1987.
   ``The sky's the limit,'' Christie's director Harts Nijstad told
The Associated Press in a telephone interview. ```The Potato Eaters'
is an enormously important painting.''
   ``The Potato Eaters'' in the Kroeller-Mueller museum was the most
complete of several versions of the same subject, according to
Nijstad, who said a less important version sits in the van Gogh
National Museum in Amsterdam.
   No estimate on the value of the other two paintings was
immediately available, but Nijstad said all three were ``frightfully
important.''
   He speculated that the paintings were stolen for ransom, adding,
``Whether the ransom will be money-wise or political is something
the future will tell us.''
   The museum's silent alarm triggered a warning in the local police
station at about 8:45 p.m. (2:45 p.m. EST), and police rushed to the
museum.
   Completed in 1885, ``The Potato Eaters'' is one of van Gogh's
most poignant depictions of poverty and hunger in the Netherlands.
It shows a farm family seated around a table eating potatoes by
lamplight, the hunger evident on their angular faces.
   Five van Gogh works were included in a list published two weeks
ago of the top 10 prices paid for paintings at the world's two major
auction houses, Christie's and Sotheby's. Van Gogh's ``Irises'' was
sold last month for $53.9 million, the highest price paid for any
painting in the world.
   The Kroeller-Mueller has dozens of van Goghs exhibited in a
special wing. The museum and surrounding estate were bequeathed to
the nation in 1938 by art collector Mrs. H.E.L.G. Kroeller-Mueller.
   The theft was the latest in a series of recent burglaries at
Dutch museums.
   In May, thieves broke a window and stole impressionist paintings
by van Gogh, French painter Paul Cezanne and Dutch painter Johan
Jongkind from Amsterdam's Municipal Museum.
   Those paintings were initially valued at up to $50 million, but
art authorities later scaled down the estimated value.
   The paintings were later recovered in a raid on an Amsterdam
hotel spearheaded by an undercover policeman posing as a buyer of
stolen art.
   That theft, mounted through a broken ground-floor window at a
time when no guards were in the Amsterdam museum, prompted calls for
stronger security in the nation's museums.
   The Kroeller-Mueller museum never before had a major theft,
police spokesman Talsma said.
   ``The Potato Eaters'' was painted when van Gogh was living in a
village in southern Holland.
   It is considered his most ambitious work from his Dutch period,
before he moved to France in 1886 and came under the influence of
Impressionism. The painting is done in dark colors in a rough style,
which van Gogh said in a letter to his brother was meant to
illustrate the rough life that the peasants lived.
   Van Gogh's artistic career lasted only 10 years, but during that
time he produced about 850 paintings. About 50 of the paintings are
still in private hands, according to James Roundell, who supervised
the ``Sunflowers'' sale.
   A highly placed source at the Van Gogh Museum said on condition
of anonymity last month that one great fear his museum had was that
the record prices being paid for works by van Gogh would bring ideas
of theft into people's heads.
   Van Gogh sold only one painting during his lifetime.

   Thieves smashed a museum window
Thursday and made off with three van Gogh paintings after the
museum's alarm system, described as fail-safe, did not go off.
   The Noordbrabants Museum lost the prize paintings of its
collection to thieves who jumped several fences and broke the
ground-floor window of the gallery where the paintings were
hanging, officials said.
   Stolen were ``The Sitting Farmer's Wife,'' ``The Digging
Farmer's Wife'' and ``Wheels of the Water Mill in Gennep.'' The
museum's deputy director, Peter Veenland, said their total value
was $2.7 million to $5.4 million.
   He said the paintings were insured but refused to say for how
much.
   Vincent van Gogh painted them while living in what is now the
town of Nuenen, 18 miles from the museum.
   It was the third time in two years that paintings by the Dutch
impressionist had been stolen from museums in the Netherlands.
   The Noordbrabants Museum has what Veenland called a
``state-of-the-art updated alarm system.'' It has two elements
designed to detect intruders _ seismic sensors measure movement and
infrared sensors to measure body heat.
   The security system was turned on and being monitored by a
security firm, but both sets of sensors in the van Gogh gallery
were found to be inoperative, Veenland told The Associated Press in
an interview.
   ``The system should have showed up that the sensors were not
working,'' Veenland said. ``But it didn't happen, and it is a
mystery to us why.''
   Veenland refused to speculate on whether the alarms were
intentionally disabled, or on the possible involvement of museum
staff. Police were questioning staff members.
   Neighbors heard the sound of breaking glass at about 12:30 a.m.
and called police.
   Veenland said the thieves, who police believe numbered three,
had to tear the framed paintings off anchors in the wall.
   It was the first theft from the museum, which moved about two
years ago to its current home, a converted granite mansion in this
provincial capital 53 miles south of Amsterdam.
   The museum has about 300 works.
   The 25-by-32.7 inch ``Water Mill'' was painted in 1884. The
15-by-11.25 inch ``Sitting Farmer's Wife'' and the
15.6-by-10.7-inch ``Digging Farmer's Wife'' were done in 1885.
   Van Gogh painted them during his so-called Brabant period, when
he used as his models the poor peasantry of the Brabant, which
encompasses a large part of the southern Netherlands.
   Guy Jennings, an impressionism expert at Christie's auction
house in London, called the stolen paintings ``minor works''
compared to van Gogh's later output, but both he and Veenland said
it would be impossible to sell them on the open market.
   Van Gogh's Brabant period works are generally dark in tone and
employ none of the bright impressionist colors, such as those used
in ``Irises,'' which have brought record auction prices.
   The most significant of the Dutch impressionist's works are in
Amsterdam's van Gogh Museum and the Kroeller-Mueller Museum near
the eastern Dutch town of Otterloo.
   In December 1988, three van Goghs, including one version of his
famous depiction of rural poverty, ``The Potato Eaters,'' were
stolen from the Kroeller-Mueller.
   In May of 1988, three other works by modern masters, including
van Gogh's ``Carnations,'' were taken from Amsterdam's Municipal
Museum.
   All were recovered.

Flowers' is, indeed, an authentic painting by Vincent van Gogh.";    Van
Crimpen said the painting appears similar to others van Gogh painted in Paris
in 1886 and 1887. The artist committed suicide in 1890.;    "It's not a
masterpiece," van Crimpen wrote. "It's one of a series of color paintings he
did. But it's not very often that a van Gogh painting is discovered, and in
that sense this is extraordinary."  </TEXT>

   A Japanese gallery bought Vincent van Gogh's
``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' for $82.5 million Tuesday, a record
auction price for any art work and double the price estimated by
Christie's, a spokeswoman for the auction house said.
   ``This is by far the world's most expensive painting,''
surpassing the $53.9 million price bid for Van Gogh's ``Irises'' in
November 1987 at Sotheby's auction house, Christie's spokeswoman
Susan Britman said.
   The buyer, a representative for the Kobayashi Gallery in Tokyo,
was in the room during the approximately 10 minutes of bidding that
opened at $20 million, Britman said. Toward the end of bidding,
only the Kobayshi representative and a telephone bidder whose
identity wasn't disclosed were vying for the painting, she said.
   ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet,'' an image of the physician who tended
Van Gogh during the last weeks before his suicide, was painted 100
years ago.
   It had been expected to fetch between $40 million and $50
million at a sale of major works by impressionist and modern
artists.
   The auction has been anticipated as a key test of the strength
of the art market. Prices boomed in the mid- to late 1980s but the
1987 stock market crash and unusual circumstances surrounding the
sale of ``Irises'' had cast doubt on whether prices would continue
to rise.
   Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond bought ``Irises'' largely with
money borrowed from Sotheby's, the house that handled the auction.
Bond's business empire became swamped in debt after the stock
market crash, and he was forced to sell the painting for an
undisclosed price to the J. Paul Getty Museum in March.
   ``Dr. Gachet'' was lent to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
1984. It is from the collection of Siegfried Kramarsky, a
German-born New York banker who died in 1961. It was put on the
block by a trust created under his will.
   The portrait of Dr. Paul-Ferdinand Gachet was painted six weeks
before van Gogh committed suicide in 1890.
   In a letter to artist Paul Gauguin, van Gogh wrote that he had
painted Gachet ``with the heart-broken expression of our time'' and
that it was ``not destined to be understood.''
   Gachet, a practitioner of homeopathic medicine, was van Gogh's
friend and physician. He was also close to other impressionist
painters of the time.
   In the painting, Gachet is shown seated at a table, head in hand.
   Van Gogh painted a second, slightly larger version of the
portrait, which hangs in the Musee d'Orsay in Paris. It lacks the
details of the Kramarsky painting and its colors are flatter.
   Another van Gogh from the Kramarsky collection was auctioned in
1987 for $20.24 million. It too had been lent to the Metropolitan.

for Hindman. He said he spotted the painting last July on the wall of the

"It's unbelievable," said Leslie Hindman, owner of the 8-year-old auction
house, which learned last week that the painting had been judged genuine.
"That you could find something like this that's so rare, it's amazing.";   
Hindman identified the owners as a retired, middle-class couple who do not
want their names or address made public. The couple inherited the work from a
relative of the husband who had emigrated from Switzerland after the start of
World War II, Hindman said.;    Hindman says she has set the preliminary price
estimate for the painting in what she called a "very conservative" range of
$500,000 to $800,000.  </TEXT>

   A painting by Vincent van Gogh, loaned to the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1984, will leave the museum to be
auctioned for an expected price of up to $50 million, Christie's
auction house says.
   The painting, ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet,'' is from the collection
of Siegfried Kramarsky, a German-born New York banker who died in
1961. It is being sold by a trust created under his will.
   Museum director Philippe de Montebello said he was not surprised
that such a painting was headed for the auction block. ``The
reduced tax advantages to collectors and the increased sale
potential are a combination that is irresistible to collectors and
fatal to museums,'' he said.
   The portrait of Dr. Paul-Ferdinand Gachet was painted six weeks
before van Gogh committed suicide in 1890.
   It will be auctioned May 15, almost precisely 100 years after it
was finished.
   Gachet, a practitioner of homeopathic medicine, was van Gogh's
physician and a friend of Impressionist painters. The doctor, an
artist himself, is shown seated at a table, head in hand, with what
van Gogh called ``the broken-hearted expression of our time.''
   Van Gogh painted a slightly larger version with less detail and
flatter colors. It hangs in the Musee d'Orsay in Paris.
   Another van Gogh, ``Irises,'' was sold at auction in 1987 for
$53.9 million, making it the world's most expensive painting. That
sale, however, was made with a loan from Sotheby's auction house;
when the buyer failed to pay what was owed, the deal fell through.

   Attention all van Gogh-craving millionaires! 
Now is the time to empty your Swiss bank accounts, for there may be a bargain coming up. 

   Christie's International PLC said it will auction off a Vincent van Gogh portrait of a 13-year-old girl painted just a month before the artist's suicide. 
The 1890 painting will be sold here May 11. 

   Christie's won't divulge the seller's name. 
The portrait, one of three van Gogh made of his innkeeper's daughter, last sold at auction in 1980, for $1,980,000. 
Art experts say the painting should sell for many times that price. 

   After all, the three most expensive paintings ever sold at auction have been van Goghs, culminating in the $53.9 million "Irises," sold in November by Sotheby's Holdings Inc. Christie's isn't expecting the portrait to top "Irises" or the $39.9 million paid in March for van Gogh's "Sunflowers," but estimates it will sell for "in excess of $15 million." 
Some art experts are skeptical. 

   "It doesn't have the power and frenzy of (other works from) his last years," says dealer Richard Feigen. 
"It's a severe, angular profile and maybe the Japanese won't like it." 

   Japanese collectors have been big buyers of impressionist works, including the sunflower painting. 

   Dealer Stephen Hahn disagrees, estimating the painting could bring more than $20 million, but he adds: "This isn't as desirable as the flower paintings. 
She is a bit homely."

   Three early oil paintings by 19th
century Dutch master Vincent van Gogh have been stolen from a small
provincial museum in this southern town, the third theft in two
years of Van Gogh works.
   The paintings taken Wednesday night from the Noordbrabants
Museum were identified by the museum as ``The Sitting Farmer's
Wife'', ``The Digging Farmer's Wife'' and ``Wheels of the Water
Mill in Gennep''.
   Guy Jennings, an Impressionism expert at Christie's auction
house in London, said by telephone that such minor works by Van
Gogh are worth about $1 million each but would be virtually
impossible to sell on the open market.
   Peter Veenland, a member of the museum's board of directors,
confirmed the theft of the paintings, the museum's only three works
by the painter.
   Dutch radio quoted police as saying the paintings were stolen
from the museum 55 miles south of Amsterdam after entry was
apparently gained through a broken window.
   The alarm system at the museum was not functioning and police
were called by a neighbor who heard the sound of breaking glass,
the radio said.
   It did not say whether the alarm was disabled during the theft
or was out of order before the break-in.
   A police spokesman reached by phone would only confirm that the
paintings were missing.
   The paintings date from about 1884, known as the artist's
Brabant period, when he worked among the farmers and rural artisans
of the Brabant, which encompasses a large part of the southern
Netherlands.
   Paintings from Van Gogh's Brabant period are generally dark in
tone and employ none of the bright colors of his later French
period, which have brought record auction prices.
   ``They really are Flemish School pictures before he really
discovered Impressionism,'' said Jennings, the Christie's expert.
   ``The Sitting Farmer's Wife'' and `The Wheels of the Water Mill
in Gennep'' were on loan from the National Fine Arts Service, said
Service spokeswoman Marry de Zwaan. ``The Digging Farmer's Wife''
was owned by the museum.
   The vast treasure trove of art owned by the Dutch nation is not
insured.
   There was speculation in the Dutch art world that the paintings
were stolen for ransom rather than resale, since underground sales
of stolen art usually realize only 10-15 percent of a painting's
open market value, Jennings said.
   The most significant of the Dutch impressionist's works are held
by Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum and the Kroeller-Mueller Museum near
the eastern Dutch town of Otterlo.
   In December 1988, three Van Goghs, including one version of his
famous depiction of rural poverty, ``The Potato Eaters,'' were
stolen from the Kroeller-Mueller.
   In May of that year, three other works by modern masters,
including Van Gogh's ``Carnations,'' were taken from Amsterdam's
Municipal Museum.
   All the stolen works were subsequently recovered.
   Wednesday's theft came during the final weeks of a major
exhibition of hundreds of Van Gogh's paintings and drawings at the
Van Gogh Museum and the Kroeller-Mueller.
   No thefts or vandalism have been reported at the show, which
marks the centenary of the artist's death.

   The last two of three Van Gogh paintings
stolen from a museum last year were recovered Thursday, Dutch
television and other news reports said.
   Vincent van Gogh's 1887 work ``Wilted Sunflowers'' and an early
version of his famous ``Potato Eaters'' painted in 1885 were
recovered, slightly damaged, the national news agency reported.
   Recovery of the paintings, whose total value has been estimated
at $72 million to $90 million, followed the arrests in recent weeks
of four people suspected in the Dec. 12, 1988, theft from the
Kroeller-Mueller Museum, 13 miles from Ede.
   In April, the thieves returned the third stolen painting, the
Dutch impressionist's 1884 work ``The Loom,'' in an attempt to
enforce a ransom demand of $2.2 million for the others.
   According to the agency report, the paintings were delivered to
police Thursday afternoon by the lawyer for one suspect. The lawyer
was not identified and police refused to confirm the report.
   The news agency said the four arrests followed another ransom
demand made early last month, but did not give a figure or say
whether any money had been paid.
   None of the four suspects, aged 22-37, has been identified, in
keeping with Dutch police practice. Two have been released pending
charges, the agency report said.
   The thieves smashed a 6-foot-wide hole in a window of the
Kroeller-Mueller Museum, in a remote location in the middle of a
large national park near the village of Otterlo.
   Police, stymied by an almost total lack of clues, put the case on
the back burner. In March, after several months of silence, the
thieves contacted museum director R.W.D. Oxenaar to demand the
ransom.
   On April 6, Oxenaar received a telephone call at his home from a
man who said ``The Loom,'' valued at $18 million to $22 million,
could be found in the trunk of a car parked nearby.
   The painting, wrapped in a blanket, was found with only a few
scratches so minute that officials first thought it had not been
damaged at all.
   A few days later, a caller told Oxenaar to have a driver standing
by with the money, but the ransom exchange fell through.
   Art experts had speculated the paintings would be held for ramsom
because they are so well-known that they would be virtually
unsellable on the open market.
   The final and most famous version of ``Potato Eaters,'' also
dated 1885, is on display at the Vincent van Gogh National Museum in
Amsterdam. The museum has the largest collection of works by the
impressionist, who lived from 1853 to 1890.

   Dutch police on Tuesday recovered
three paintings, including works by Vincent van Gogh and Paul
Cezanne, less than two weeks after they were stolen from this
city's Municipal Museum, police said.
   Three Dutchmen were arrested when they tried to sell the
19th-century paintings in an Amsterdam hotel, said police spokesman
Klaas Wilting.
   The works, whose combined worth has been estimated at up to $52
million, were recovered undamaged, he told The Associated Press.
   The art theft was the nation's biggest ever.
   Wilting refused to disclose any further details of the hotel
transaction.
   He would also not say whether the three suspects were thought to
include the burglars who smashed a museum window and stole the
three works on May 20.
   Stolen were ``Carnations,'' a 1888 work by the Dutch painter Van
Gogh, ``Bottle with Apples,'' a still life painted in 1894 by the
French master Cezanne; and ``The House of Maitre Billaud in
Nevers,'' an 1874 painting by Dutch artist Johan Jongkind.
   Museum director Wim Beeren said at the time that the theft was
thought to have been commissioned by a private art lover, since the
paintings are virtually unsellable on the open market.
   Beeren said the record loss figure was in part due to the
astronomical prices fetched recently by Van Gogh paintings at
auctions.
   Last November, an unidentified collector paid $53 million for
Van Gogh's ``Irises'' at a New York auction.
   Eight months earlier, the impressionist master's ``Sunflowers''
was auctioned in London for $29.8 million.
   However, experts of the Christie's auction firm in London said
soon after the Amsterdam burglary that the three paintings were
worth only $11 million.
   The theft also sparked a public debate on the security of the
Dutch artistic collections. Critics said too little was being done
to protect the nation's art treasures from often highly
professional thieves.
   The pre-dawn burglary on May 20 triggered only an electronic
alarm at the museum, which has 3,200 artworks, mostly modern, but
no night guard.
   It took 20 minutes for police to arrive on the scene of the
burglary reportedly because the museum's private security company
failed to immediately alert authorities.

   A painting of vivid yellow and orange flowers
in a dark vase, hanging on a faded wall of a little-known museum on
the Nile, is an original work by Vincent van Gogh, French experts
say.
   ``It is real, absolutely real, without doubt,'' Francoise Cachin,
director of Paris' Musee d'Orsay, told a news conference Saturday.
   The one-foot-square canvas is among 350 paintings and other art
works at the Mohammed Mahmoud Khalil Museum, which houses the
private collection of an Egyptian senator donated to the state by
his widow in 1960.
   The painting attributed to van Gogh, titled ``Poppies'' by the
museum, is being called ``Flowers'' by the French experts until ``we
can determine exactly what kind of flowers are in the vase,'' said
Cachin.
   In 1967, Egyptian authorities estimated its value at $500,000,
but Cachin didn't give any estimate of how much it might be worth
today.
   A van Gogh painting has commanded the single highest price ever
paid for a painting _ his ``Irises'' sold for almost $53.9 million
in New York in November 1987. Van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' was sold at
Christie's in London in March 1987 for $39.85 million.
   The authenticity of the Cairo painting has been questioned since
it was stolen in 1978 from the domed, arabesque building on an
island on the Nile opposite downtown Cairo. The painting was
recovered at an undisclosed location in Kuwait in 1980.
   ``It is an authenic van Gogh,'' said the curator of the museum's
paintings, Genevieve Lacambre.
   Lacambre, who was curator of 19th-century painting at the Louvre
in Paris for 20 years, studied the canvas attributed to the Dutch
master for three weeks before the results were announced.
   Cachin said the painting resembles a flower scene painted by the
French artist Adolphe Monticelli, whose work deeply affected the
young van Gogh. The Monticelli painting also is part of the Khalil
collection.
   ``It is absolutely correct for the technique of early Van Gogh,''
Cachin said.
   She said the back of the painting has a small, numbered pink
label, ``the kind used by French art dealers.
   ``It would be impossible to imagine someone could copy such a
number,'' said Cachin, who also studied a photograph from the Paris
dealer who sold the painting to Khalil.
   Most of the canvases for which the Dutch-born postimpressionist
is remembered were painted in 29 months of frenzied activity before
his suicide in 1890 at age 37.
   The experts said they believed the Cairo canvas was painted
around 1887.
   Cachin said the painting is in ``a normal condition for a
painting that has been stolen.'' Bernard Malauzat, French Embassy
cultural officer, said the oil had ``small flakes of paint missing.''
   The painting has been ``in some small accident which seems to be
recent, maybe when it was traveling,'' Cachin said. ``It can easily
be restored.''
   The painting has been taken off display and put in storage at the
nearby el-Gezira Museum.
   Authorities have never fully revealed the details of the theft of
the painting. When it was recovered in March 1980, Egypt's
then-interior minister, Nabawi Ismail, said three Egyptians involved
in the theft had been arrested and informed police where the canvas
was left. Authorities never reported whether the thieves were
charged or tried.
   Other works in he Khalil collection, all from the 19th-century
French school, are by Paul Gauguin, Gustave Courbet, Francois
Millet, Claude Monet, Edouard Manet, Auguste Renoir and Auguste
Rodin.
   Malauzat said 90 percent of the the museum's 745 art works _
including 270 sculptures and more than 100 other works _ have been
authenticated.
   ``The majority of paintings are not in bad condition. With proper
expertise and cleaning, they will be back to very bright colors,''
Malauzat said.

   Art thieves smashed a window in
the Municipal Museum early Friday and stole three masterpieces
worth up to $52 million, including works by Vincent Van Gogh and
Paul Cezanne. It was the biggest art theft in Dutch history.
   The burglars broke a ground-floor window before dawn in the
museum's north wing, which is relatively sheltered from public
view, said museum spokesman Maarten Bertheux. The thieves then
walked through five galleries to reach the room where the works
were hanging, he said.
   Stolen were ``Carnations,'' an 1888 work by the Dutch painter
Van Gogh; ``Bottle with Apples,'' a still life painted in 1894 by
the French master Cezanne; and ``The House of Maitre Billaud in
Nevers,'' an 1874 painting by Dutch artist Johan Jongkind.
   Two other valuable Van Gogh paintings, ``The Diggers'' and ``The
Rocking Chair,'' were hanging in the same gallery but were not
taken.
   Rini Dippel, the museum's deputy director, said they may have
been left because they are substantially larger than the others.
   Museum director Wim Beeren said the stolen paintings are worth
an estimated $52 million, although experts from Christie's auction
house in London estimated their worth at $11 million.
   The Municipal Museum houses a collection of about 3,000 works
from the 19th and 20th centuries and is next door to the Van Gogh
Museum, which has 220 paintings by the Dutch master, the world's
largest collection.
   Beeren and other art experts speculated that the theft was
commissioned by a private art collector, since the Van Gogh and the
Cezanne are too famous to be sold publicly and since the other Van
Gogh works weren't taken.
   ``I've got the impression that they chose the paintings with a
clear purpose in mind,'' Beeren said. ``This'll go straight to
somebody's room or home.''
   ``There's a very good reporting system (on art thefts) these
days ... If they're offered for sale at a bona fide art dealer or
auction house, that'll be known right away,'' said Fred Leeman of
the Van Gogh Museum.
   Bertheux told The Associated Press that there was no one in the
museum at the time of the burglary. Around-the-clock surveillance
by security personnel was abolished in 1975 to save money.
   Authorities were alerted when an alarm went off about 5 a.m.,
but there were conflicting accounts on when the theft was
discovered.
   Police spokesman Joost van Wijngaarden said police arrived at
5:10 a.m., entered the museum through the broken window and ``found
nothing missing.''
   He said officers then left the museum and that private security
guards discovered the theft about 90 minutes later.
   But Bertheux said museum officials discovered the theft almost
immediately when they entered the building's main lobby and ran
past the targeted gallery on their way to investigate the broken
window.
   ``This is a terrible loss of prestige for (museum) security,''
Beeren told reporters at an impromptu news conference. He appeared
shaken and pale.
   The paintings were not insured against theft.
   Beeren said he based his loss estimate on the fact that ``there
is a Van Gogh involved, and recent price developments (for Van
Goghs) have been dramatic.''
   In March 1987, Van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' fetched $39.8 million
at a London auction. In November, an unidentified collector paid
$53 million for Van Gogh's ``Irises'' in New York.
   Ms. Dippel said experts from Christie's based their estimate on
black and white photographs of the paintings in a museum catalog.
According to Christie's, the Van Gogh is worth $1.6 million to $2.1
million; the Cezanne is worth $7.9 million; and the Jongkind is
worth $147,000.
   The nation's last major art theft was in February 1987, when
nine pieces, including works by French painter Jean-Auguste Renoir
and Dutch master Pieter Bruegel, vanished from an art gallery in
the southern city of Maastricht.
   The loss was estimated at $2.65 million. The paintings were
never recovered.

   Ken Wilkie believes his 18 years of digging for
facts about Vincent van Gogh lights up hitherto dark places in the
life and loves of the world's most popular artist.
   ``I looked in the places no one had bothered with before, like
the telephone book,'' said Wilkie, whose new book about his quest,
``The Van Gogh File,'' was recently published.
   In the Netherlands, museums are busy preparing exhibitions of
paintings and drawings by van Gogh to mark the centennial of the
Dutch artist whose works have become the most expensive in art
history.
   Van Gogh was poor all his life and could not sell his work. But
in eight months in 1987, three paintings by him of irises,
sunflowers and a bridge sold for $114 million.
   At one time, van Gogh's paintings were used for target practice.
Wilkie said he discovered that at St. Remy mental hospital, where
Van Gogh was a voluntary patient in 1889, the son of the doctor in
charge and a friend used the artist's canvasses that he had left
behind as targets for their bows and arrows.
   ``Only much later, when van Gogh became so famous, did they
realize what they had destroyed,'' Wilkie said. He said he was told
of the archery targets by the grandson of van Gogh's guard at the
hospital.
   Wilkie tracked down the man and others connected with van Gogh
through telephone calls in the Netherlands, Belgium, England and
France where the artist lived during his 37 years.
   ``I called people of the same name in the telephone book,'' said
Wilkie, 47, a Scottish journalist from Dundee who lives in
Amsterdam.
   The book revises and updates his first book on the artist in
1978, ``The Van Gogh Assignment,'' which evolved from an article he
was asked to write in 1972.
   His first break in 1972 was a chance meeting with Vincent Willem
van Gogh, then 83, son of the artist's brother, Theo.
   ``Willem was a year old when he was held in the arms of Vincent,
who shot himself two months later,'' Wilkie said. ``All the old
people I spoke to in the first few years are now dead.''
   He listed his most important discoveries as a drawing by van
Gogh of the house in London where he lodged in 1873; a photograph
of Eugenie Loyer, the landlady's daughter who rejected van Gogh's
offer of marriage; and the information out that Vincent and Theo
were both treated for syphilis.
   ``Eugenie's rejection had a profound effect on the course of van
Gogh's immediate life, and the disease explains many curious
actions of the brothers,'' said Wilkie.
   ``Vincent was fired from his job in a London art dealer's after
he began telling the customers what he really thought of the
rubbish on the walls. He then became obsessed with religion and
feelings of compassion for the poor,'' Wilkie said. ``I think the
syphilis was responsible for his schizophrenia and fits, and for
Theo dying paralyzed and insane six months after Vincent.''
   Wilkie said that by going to places where van Gogh had been, he
uncovered things that aren't in art history books.
   ``There are scores of art history books about Van Gogh but they
tend to rely on what other art historians have written,'' he said.
   In south London, at 87 Hackford Road, a blue plaque on a
three-story row house records that Van Gogh lived there in 1873-74.
   Arthur Smith, a retired sanitary inspector who is the current
occupant, said nothing remains of the artist except an old outdoor
toilet that he probably used.
   ``We get film crews and lots of Japanese tourists and we get
nothing for it,'' he said. ``We can't even park the car.''
   ``Do you think I could auction the blue plaque?''

<HL> Van Gogh Work,
'Irises,' Brings
Record Sale Price

   Sotheby's auctioned off Vincent van Gogh's painting "Irises" for $53.9 million, a world record at auction. 

   The price far exceeds the previous record of $39.9 million paid for van Gogh's "Sunflowers" last March in London, proving again that art and stock have little in common. 

   The crowd in the packed sale room cheered and applauded wildly as the final price was reached. 
The buyer's name wasn't disclosed and bidding for at least the last $20 million was a contest between two people on the telephone. 

   Sotheby's would say only that the van Gogh was bought by a European agent for an anonymous collector "somewhere in the world." 
The price includes a 10% sales commission. 

   The seller of the painting, John Whitney Payson, said at a news conference after the sale that he was "euphoric." 
Mr. Payson, who said his mother had paid $84,000 for the painting in 1947, said that he is giving most of the proceeds to various charities. 

   Mr. Payson's mother, Maine philanthropist Joan Whitney Payson, owned the New York Mets baseball team until her death in 1975. 
After she died, the painting was displayed at Westbrook College in suburban Portland, Maine, in a gallery that Mr. Payson built in her memory. 

   "Irises," a 28-by-36 5/8-inch oil, depicts a patch of purple irises and one white bloom in a garden. 
The work was painted in 1889 while van Gogh was a voluntary patient at an asylum for the insane in Saint-Remy de Provence, France, where he lived until his suicide in 1890 at 37 years old. 

   Journalists from around the world, including two television crews from Japan, attended the auction. 
Celebrities present included Andy Williams, Bianca Jagger and Jack Nicholson. 

   John L. Marion, chairman of Sotheby's North America, a unit of Sotheby's Holdings Inc. of London, said after the sale: "I was telling everybody that this painting ("Irises") would transcend the stock market. 
There is no other opportunity to purchase something like this." 

   After selling the van Gogh, Lot 25 of 100 artworks sold, Mr. Marion, who was the auctioneer, had trouble quieting the crowd. 
"Well, back to earth folks," he said, and indeed it was. 
While the evening's total sale of $110.2 million was an auction record, there were 25 works that didn't sell, including some by Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso. 

   Before the sale, New York art dealer Stephen Hahn said whatever the price it "won't have an effect on the art market, it is one single picture and a far better painting than `Sunflowers.' " Mr Hahn added: "We still had a rather shocking period for the stock market and that has to show up sometime." 

   On his way out, Mr. Nicholson said to a woman seated next to him: "Just say I wouldn't pay a penny over $32 million and let it go at that."

   An exhibit of works by van Gogh
drew a record 1.2 million visitors over a four-month period,
organizers said Monday. People camped out through the weekend in
hopes of seeing the show before it closed.
   The ``Vincent van Gogh Retrospective'' offered an unprecedented
collection of masterpieces from museums and private collections
around the world. It closed Sunday, the 100th anniversary of the
Dutch artist's death.
   Nearly 140 paintings were on show in Amsterdam's Vincent van
Gogh Museum, which houses the world's largest van Gogh collection.
Simultaneously, 248 drawings were on display at the Kroeller
Mueller Museum in Otterlo, about 55 miles east of Amsterdam.
   ``They are the ones he would have shown if he ever had given an
exhibition,'' said Lisbeth Heenk, a spokeswoman for the Kroeller
Mueller museum.
   She said the number of visitors broke records for Dutch museum
exhibits as well as van Gogh exhibits in other countries.
   No security problems or incidents were reported. Security was a
serious concern in light of a series of major thefts and vandalism
in recent years.
   The works borrowed for the retrospective were reportedly insured
for a total of $3.3 billion. Dutch museums do not insure their own
works.
   Among the most famous paintings on display were ``Starry
Night,'' ``The Bedroom,'' and ``The Potato Eaters.'' Not on display
were ``Irisis'' and ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet,'' which have been
bought at auction for record prices.

   Sotheby's will auction off a vivid painting of irises by Vincent van Gogh that art experts think will sell for at least $30 million. 

   A sunflower painting by the same artist was sold for a record $39.9 million in March by Christie's International PLC in London. 
Another van Gogh painting, of a bridge, was sold in June at Christie's for $20.2 million. 
Both prices far exceeded the previous auction record of $11 million for any painting. 

   The New York auction unit of Sotheby's Holdings Inc. of London said it will auction off "Irises" here Nov. 11. 
The painting, from the artist's stay in a mental hospital in 1889, is owned by John Whitney Payson, son of celebrated art collector and onetime New York Mets owner, Joan Whitney Payson. 

   Mr. Payson said he is selling the work because the "recent and unprecedented spiral in art prices" has made it prohibitively expensive to insure the work, which is part of his mother's collection at Westbrook College in Portland, Maine. 
He said the proceeds will be divided between a family trust, the college and a new family foundation. 

   Sotheby's would only estimate that the painting will fetch "well over $20 million," but experts say it's the finest van Gogh to come to market in decades. 
"This picture has got to bring in the $30 million range, and it could go higher," said New York dealer Richard Feigen.

   If Vincent van Gogh had the
marketing pizazz of the entrepreneurs cashing in on his centennial,
he probably wouldn't have died a penniless suicide.
   As the Van Gogh 1990 Foundation prepares a multi-media
extravaganza here marking the 100th anniversary of the artist's
death, merchandisers are capitalizing on the event with everything
from wine to ties bearing his name or image.
   The commercialization has not pleased either the foundation or
Van Gogh's family.
   ``It is not to our taste,'' grandnephew Johan van Gogh told The
Associated Press.
   The government-backed foundation is preparing the biggest-ever
van Gogh show, with almost 200 works loaned from more than 50
countries for an exhibition opening on his birthday, March 30.
   The official commemoration has the support of the van Gogh
family.
   ``We are going to give Vincent van Gogh a high quality
commemoration,'' said foundation spokeswoman Madeleine A.
Wardenaar. ``We want him to be respected as a Dutch artist.''
   ``We're not doing this as a business,'' added foundation
financial advisor J. Rooyackers.
   But many others are.
   Chief among them is Amsterdam dentist Jacob G. Dekker, whose Van
Gogh International has registered the name Vincent van Gogh as a
trademark ``in just about every country you can think of except
Timbuktu'' for a variety of products.
   His flagship line of ``Vincent van Gogh'' perfumes and colognes
has a floral fragrance to remind buyers of works like the
``Sunflowers'' series and ``Irises,'' which holds the art auction
record of $53 million.
   Other commemmorative products Dekker has licensed include pen
sets, watches, compact discs of music composed by van Gogh
contemporaries Debussy, Ravel and Chausson, and T-shirts, scarves
and ties decorated with van Gogh scenes.
   Dekker projects total centennial year sales of about $75 million
worldwide. He says he registered the trademark five years ago,
without a thought to the centennial.
   ``The idea was to find a (product) name that everyone knows
worldwide, so you don't have to spend millions establishing a
name,'' Dekker told the AP.
   For those who take van Gogh slightly more seriously than to dab
him behind their ears or tie him around their necks, the U.S.-based
Franklin Mint is issuing a ``limited edition'' bronze commemorative
medallion for $150.
   American Express Netherlands is offering an 8-inch bronze bust
of van Gogh for $488. Its manufacturer, Barcelona-based Vincent
Fine Art, is also hawking van Gogh reproductions and commemorative
bottles of Spanish champagn.
   The commercial hoopla has created frictions between the
entrepreneurs and organizations like the centennial foundation,
which see themselves as trying in vain to shield an artistic giant
from crass commercialism.
   ``When I offered my products to the gift shop of the Van Gogh
Museum, they treated me like a stray dog,'' said Dekker.
   The foundation has, for example, refused endorsements such as
one for a line of curtains embossed with van Gogh sunflowers.
   ``We try to discourage people. We don't like the publicity it
gets, but we cannot control it,'' said Ms. Wardenaar, since both
the artist's name and his works are in the public domain.
   ``They can do what they like. We have not much to say about
it,'' said Johan van Gogh, grandson of the artist's brother Theo.
   Johan chairs the family-run Vincent van Gogh Foundation, which
owns more than one hundred works on permanent loan to the Van Gogh
museum here, the world's largest single collection.
   At issue is one of this nation's greatest cultural icons, a
minister's son whose early works reflected the grinding poverty of
19th century rural Dutch life. Foremost among them is ``The Potato
Eaters,'' depicting a farming family with grotesquely pinched
features gathered around their meager supper.
   It was only during his later French period that Van Gogh bloomed
with the vibrant colors that have gilded the auction gavel.
   The irony is that the world's best-selling artist sold only one
single painting himself.
   After his descent into mental illness, Van Gogh fatally shot
himself in July 1890 at the age of 37.
   The centennial foundation is pushing ahead with events it claims
will nurture interest in the artist without exploiting him.
   A van Gogh opera will premiere in Amsterdam, a commemorative
medal will be issued, a film festival screened, and a poetry book
published with the poems of 20 Dutch and Belgian poets commissioned
in his honor.
   Commemorative posters by 20 contemporary artists, including
Czechoslovak Jiri Kolar, Dutchman Willem de Kooning and American
Roy Lichtenstein have been run off to help offset the $11.5 million
exhibition cost.

   Vincent van Gogh's melancholy portrait of the
doctor who treated him in the weeks before his suicide sold at
auction for $82.5 million, making it by far the most expensive
painting in the world.
   The sale Tuesday of ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' came after a
10-minute bidding war at Christie's auction house between two
buyers who jacked up the price in increments of $1 million.
   The 26-by-22.5-inch oil was worth $141,000 per square inch to
Kobayashi Gallery of Tokyo, which has emerged in recent years as a
major buyer of Impressionist art.
   The total surpassed the $53.9 million paid for van Gogh's
``Irises'' in 1987 at Sotheby's, said Susan Britman, a Christie's
spokeswoman.
   Explaining the astronomical price, Christie's President
Christopher Burge cited the painting's good condition, its
high-profile exhibitions in New York and the opinion among many
that it is one of van Gogh's five best paintings.
   ``We may have to wait another 10 years, another 20 years for a
picture of that importance,'' Burge said.
   Dealer Hideto Kobayashi told Japan's Kyodo News Service he
bought the painting on behalf of an unidentified Japanese company
that wanted the work at any price. ``They are extremely pleased,''
Kyodo quoted Kobayashi as saying.
   Owned by the trust of German-born banker Siegfried Kramarsky,
who died in 1961, ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' had hung since 1984 at
the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Christie's had expected it to fetch
between $40 million and $50 million.
   The painting was completed in Auvers-sur-Oise, France, six weeks
before the artist's suicide in 1890. Dr. Paul-Ferdinand Gachet, a
practitioner of homeopathic medicine and a friend and physician to
other Impressionist painters, had tended to van Gogh in the final
weeks of his life.
   Gachet is shown slouched at a table, head resting on his hand.
In a letter to Paul Gauguin, van Gogh said he had painted Gachet
``with the heartbroken expression of our time'' and that it was
``not destined to be understood.''
   A slightly larger version with less detail and flatter colors
hangs in the Musee d'Orsay in Paris.
   The auction had been anticipated as a test of the strength of
the art market. Prices boomed in the mid- to late 1980s, but the
1987 stock market crash and unusual circumstances surrounding the
sale of ``Irises'' had cast doubt on whether prices would continue
to rise.
   Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond bought ``Irises'' largely with
money borrowed from Sotheby's. Bond's business empire became
swamped in debt after the stock market crash, and he was forced to
sell the painting for an undisclosed price to the J. Paul Getty
Museum of Malibu, Calif., in March.
   On Tuesday, once the price on the van Gogh reached about $36
million, two bidders dropped out. The Kobayashi representative and
an anonymous private collector bidding by telephone began raising
the price quickly, Burge said.
   ``Two people were determined to have a great picture,'' Burge
said. ``A tremendous battle ensued between the bidders all the way
to the end.''
   The final price included a $7.5 million, or 10 percent, buyer's
fee that goes to Christie's.
   The losing bidder bought another van Gogh, a self-portrait
painted in Arles, France, in 1888, for $26.4 million, Burge said.
   The auction included other major works by Impressionist and
modern artists.
   Record prices were set for seven other artists, including $12.98
million for Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's ``Girl with Fur'' and $9.9
million for Marc Chagall's ``Above the City.''
   The auction sold 57 of 81 works offered for a total of $269.4
million.

Put in Play in Wake
Of $39.9 Million Sale

Christie's Predicts 'Le Pont'
Will Bring No. 2 Price
For Painting at Auction

   The eye-popping sale of a Vincent van Gogh sunflower painting this month for $39.9 million has coaxed another major work by the Dutch artist onto the auction block. 

   The London-based auction house Christie's International PLC said it will auction off "Le Pont de Trinquetaille," an important painting of a bridge by van Gogh, on June 29 in London. 
A Christie's spokesman predicted that Le Pont will become "the second most expensive painting ever sold at auction." 
Christie's said the painting has been owned by the Kramarsky family of New York for more than 50 years. 

   Le Pont, once owned by van Gogh's sister-in-law, was shown at a major exhibition in Amsterdam in 1905 and eventually was bought by Siegfried Kramarsky in 1932 at a Paris sale. 

   Art specialists said the Kramarsky family's art collection is considered valuable but isn't well publicized. 
The collection was brought to the U.S. from Holland before World War II. 
Some of the works have been lent to museums. 
Le Pont has been on loan for the past three years to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. 

   Christopher Burge, who runs Christie's in New York, is wary of predicting that this van Gogh work will engender the frenzied bidding of his sunflower painting, which is a more dazzling, brightly colored and better-known image. 
The sunflower painting was acquired by Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co. of Tokyo. 

   The bridge painting, in muted grays and blues, "is an extremely subtle and quiet painting that requires contemplation," Mr. Burge said. 

   Nonetheless, Christie's expects this work easily to exceed the second-highest price ever paid for a work of art, $11 million, in December for a painting by Edouard Manet. 
And many art dealers believe that the price that this second van Gogh masterwork will fetch at auction will have a major influence on the art market in the near future. 

   "This will be a test of the previous price," New York art dealer Richard Feigen said. 
"If the price that this realizes reinforces the market level of the sunflowers, then you'll have a verification the other wasn't just a battle between two bidders." 
This, other dealers say, could unleash a lot of art onto the market. 

   Mr. Burge of Christie's said: "I think we made it clear to people that the van Gogh (sunflowers) was an isolated instance, and it doesn't make every other good impressionist painting worth $30 million to $40 million. 
But we've all been saying for some time that the art market will slow down, and you may see an element (in the near future) of profit-taking in the market, to use a horrid word."

<HEAD>Museum Refuses to Comment on Interest in van Gogh's `Irises'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MALIBU, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>

   ``Irises,'' the Vincent van Gogh painting
that sold for a record $53.9 million in 1987, reportedly has been
brought to the J. Paul Getty Museum, which is considering buying it.
   ``The museum isn't commenting,'' Getty spokeswoman Lori Starr
said in response to Wednesday's Los Angeles Times report. Museum
officials would say only that no agreement or purchase had taken
place.
   The owner of the masterpiece, financially troubled Australian
entrepreneur Alan Bond, reportedly has turned down offers of $50
million to $60 million.
   The painting was delivered to the museum, 30 miles west of Los
Angeles, last week, the newspaper said, citing an unidentified
source who saw the painting at the Getty. The pating was last
reported to be at Bond's office in Sydney.
   The New York Times on Thursday quoted museum staff members who
declined to be identified as saying the painting remains at the
museum while negotiations take place involving the Getty, Bond and
Sotheby's auction house.
   Museums often receive artworks before a purchase so curators can
verify the work's authenticity and examine it for possible damage.
   Major acquisitions must be approved by the museum's board of
trustees, several of whom have viewed the painting, the Los Angeles
Times said.
   With a $2.1 billion endowment from the late oil baron J. Paul
Getty, the museum is the world's richest financial institution.
   The 1889 painting, characteristic of van Gogh's bold
postimpressionist style, depicts a field of midnight-blue irises,
except for a single white iris. The landscape is from a corner of
the garden at the asylum of St. Paul de Mausole in St. Remy de
Provence, where the artist committed himself in 1889-90.
   Bond acquired the painting Nov. 11, 1987, at Sotheby's,
reportedly financing the record auction price with a $27 million
loan from the auction house, which accepted the painting as
collateral in an unusual transaction.
   The highly leveraged acquisition, similar to Wall Street
takeover deals of whole corporations during the 1980s, was widely
criticized for inflating prices in the international art market.
   The extraordinary prices paid for art in recent years also have
placed many works beyond the acquisition budgets of art museums.
   Since Bond's financial empire began crumbling under the weight
of more than $5 billion in debt, there has been widespread
speculation among art curators, dealers and collectors about the
fate of ``Irises.''
   The painting was in private European collections until 1947,
when it was purchased for $80,000 by New York philanthropist Joan
Whitney Payson. After a version of van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' sold
for $39.9 million in 1987, Payson decided to sell ``Irises'' and
use the proceeds to endow a charitable foundation.

   The hottest ticket in town tonight is a seat to watch one of history's greatest battles over a work of art. 
But there probably won't be much to see. 

   After intensive promotions and a round-the-world tour with armed guards, Sotheby's Holdings Inc. will auction a brilliantly colored painting of irises by Vincent van Gogh that could well become the most expensive work of art ever sold, surpassing the $39.9 million for which Christie's International PLC of London auctioned a van Gogh sunflower painting in March. 
That was more than triple the highest price ever paid at auction. 
In June, Christie's sold a van Gogh painting of a bridge for $20.2 million. 

   Sotheby's says the standing-room-only crowd of 2,200 (tickets are free but required for attendance) will be its biggest audience ever, including reporters from Japan, Germany, France and England, and a dozen television crews. 

   But the visible excitement may be limited to a few Sotheby's employees waving their arms at the auctioneer. 
Much of the bidding for the irises, lot 25 in tonight's impressionist sale, is expected to come from a handful of Japanese and European collectors, many of whom will likely bid over the telephone. 
Another possible contender is Australian beer mogul Alan Bond, but he generally doesn't bid in person either. 

   The drama also is likely to be short-lived: The historic auctioning of the sunflowers took less than four minutes. 

   Many art specialists consider the iris painting more beautiful and important than the sunflower and bridge paintings, and in better condition than the sunflower work. 
A Japanese insurance company, Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine, bought the sunflowers in London, and for Japanese buyers the dollar is an even bigger bargain today than the British pound was then. 

   The auction is of more than academic interest, because it is likely to offer further evidence that the world art market has become as integrated as the financial markets. 
And some art experts say the instability in world stock markets may make an acknowledged masterpiece even more valuable as a place to park money. 

   "If I was sitting in Tokyo with a billion-dollar piece of real estate, I'd sell it and buy this (painting)," says New York art dealer Richard Feigen, who expects the irises to sell for $45 million to $50 million. 
"You can't move a hunk of land quickly to Switzerland like you can a van Gogh."

<HEAD>Art Thieves Steal Three Masterpieces From Dutch Museum</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf, `Stolen were...' to CORRECT date of

<BYLINE>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Thieves smashed a window at the
Municipal Museum today and made off with three 19th-century
paintings worth up to $52 million, including works by Vincent Van
Gogh and Paul Cezanne.
   Museum officials said it was the largest art theft in modern
Dutch history.
   Stolen were ``Carnations,'' an 1888 work by Van Gogh; ``The
House of Maitre Billaud in Nevers,'' by Dutch painter Johan
Jongkind, from 1874; and ``Bottle with Apples,'' an 1894 still life
by Cezanne, the French impressionist.
   Museum director Wim Beeren estimated their combined value at $52
million, but the Christie's auction firm in London set their worth
at $11 million.
   The theft at the downtown museum, also known as the Stedelijk
Museum, was discovered after 5 a.m. when someone broke a window in
the building and triggered an alarm.
   Museum spokesman Maarten Bertheux said no one was inside at the
time. He said the museum's estimated 3,000 works are protected only
by an electronic alarm system when the museum is closed.
   Round-the-clock surveillance by security personnel was abolished
as an economy measure in 1975, Beeren said. ``This is a terrible
loss of prestige for (museum) security,'' he told reporters. The
stolen paintings were not insured.
   The museum, famed for its collection of works by 19th- and
20th-century masters, is a three-story building with large windows
on the street level. The thieves entered through one of those
windows that faces a secluded, tree-shrouded area, officials said.
   They walked through five galleries before reaching the room
where the stolen paintings were on display with two other Van Gogh
works, according to deputy director Rini Dippel.
   Ms. Dippel speculated that the thieves left the other two Van
Gogh paintings, ``The Rocking Chair'' and ``The Diggers,'' because
they were substantially larger than ``Carnations,'' which measures
18.4 by 15 inches.
   There were conflicting accounts on how the theft was discovered.
   Police spokeswoman Heleen van der Weijden police arrived on the
scene after the alarm sounded and entered the museum but failed to
notice the theft. She said the theft was discovered an hour later
by a private security guard.
   Bertheux said museum staffers and police discovered the theft
about 20 minutes after the alarm sounded.
   Recent tests of the alarm system showed it took only three
minutes for police and guards to get there, Beeren said. He could
give no explanation for the delay.
   Mrs. van der Weijden said Interpol and customs services around
the world were alerted.
   The Municipal Museum is next to the Van Gogh Museum, which has
the world's largest collection by the Dutch master. About 200 yards
from the two museums is the Rijksmuseum, the nation's largest
repository of works by Rembrandt.
   According to Christie's, the stolen Van Gogh is worth $1.6
million to $2.1 million; the Cezanne, $7.9 million; and the
Jongkind, $147,000. Ms. Dippel said those estimates were based on
black and white photographs in a museum catalog.
   Beeren said he based his higher estimate on the fact that
``there is a Van Gogh involved, and recent price developments (for
Van Goghs) have been dramatic.''
   In March 1987, Van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' drew $39.8 million at a
London auction. In November, an unidentified collector paid $53
million for the Dutch painter's ``Irises'' in New York.
   Beeren speculated that the theft may have been commissioned by a
private art collector, since the paintings are too famous to be
sold on the public market.
   ``I've got the impression that they chose the paintings with a
clear purpose in mind,'' he said. ``This'll go straight to
somebody's room or home, I guess.''

   Pamela Harriman, wife of the late Ambassador W.
Averell Harriman, will give Vincent van Gogh's ``Roses'' to the
National Gallery of Art, the gallery director said Tuesday.
   The painting, which Mrs. Harriman valued at $50 million to $60
million, will be the first van Gogh still life to join the National
Gallery's permanent collection.
   Gallery director J. Carter Brown also announced at a National
Press Club luncheon that the gallery had received gifts of three
major 20th century works from the late Rita Schreiber of Los Angeles
in memory of her husband, Taft B. Schreiber, a Republican activist
and MCA Inc. executive who died in 1976.
   The Schreiber gifts include a 1924 painting titled ``Harlequin
Musician'' by Pablo Picasso, ``Woman Seated in an Armchair'' painted
by Henri Matisse in 1940 and a 1927 bronze sculpture by Constantin
Brancusi titled ``Bird in Space.''
   Brown said ``Roses'' would be displayed as part of a three-month
exhibit devoted to anniversary gifts of art beginning March 17,
1991, the 50th anniversary of the opening of the gallery's West
Building.
   ``Our hope is that it will set an example for other patriotic
donors,'' he said.
   The gallery will receive complete title to the painting when Mrs.
Harriman dies.
   Mrs. Harriman said her husband, a former Democratic governor of
New York and heir to a railroad fortune, bought the van Gogh in
Paris in 1930 with his mother.
   A similar van Gogh still life, ``Irises,'' was sold at auction
for a record-breaking $53.9 million in November 1987.
   Another van Gogh, ``Sunflowers,'' sold in London in March 1987
for $39.9 million, making it the third costliest painting on record
after a Picasso self-portrait, ``Yo Picasso,'' which Sotheby's
auctioned May 9 for $47.8 million.
   ``Roses,'' measuring 28 inches by 35.5 inches, was one of four
still lifes van Gogh completed shortly before he left Saint-Remy,
France, in 1890, the year he died.
   Charles S. Moffett, senior curator of paintings at the National
Gallery and a van Gogh authority, said ``Roses'' was
``unquestionably one of van Gogh's most important and most beautiful
paintings.''
   Harriman, a former industrialist, banker, roving U.S. ambassador
and presidential adviser, died in 1986 at age 94. Ambassador to
London and Moscow during World War II, Harriman negotiated the 1963
nuclear test ban treaty with the Soviet Union and was a leader of
the American delegation at the Paris peace talks that ended the
Vietnam War.
   In 1972, the W. Averell Harriman Foundation gave the National
Gallery 22 paintings by such artists as Cezanne, Degas, Gaugin,
Matisse, Picasso and Seurat.

   "Sunflowers," a painting by Vincent Van Gogh, brought a world record $39.9 million yesterday at Christie's auction house. 

   The price was more than three times the previous world auction record, which was $11.9 million, paid in 1983 for a 12th century illuminated manuscript of "The Gospels of Henry the Lion." 

   The painting of 15 sunflowers in a yellow vase -- one of seven paintings of sunflowers done by Van Gogh in 1888 and early 1889 -- was acquired by an anonymous foreign collector bidding by telephone. 

   Until last January, the painting, which was owned by the Beatty family, was on loan to the National Gallery in London. 
It was consigned to Christie's from the estate of the late Helen Beatty, whose late husband's parents had bought the painting in Paris in 1934.

   Christie's International PLC said that it will auction off a sunflower painting by Vincent van Gogh in March, and that the work probably will fetch more than $11 million. 

   The current record for a Van Gogh painting is $9.9 million. 
The highest price ever paid for a painting at auction is $11.1 million, paid in December for a work called "La Rue Mosnier aux Paveurs" by Edouard Manet. 
"This is an absolutely fantastic picture, one of the most famous images by the most desirable 19th-century painter," said Christopher Burge, president of Christie's in the U.S. 
"There is every chance that it will bring an absolutely colossal price." 

   Christie's said that it will sell the work at an auction here March 30, and that the work will be on view at Christie's in New York from March 6 through March 8. 
Currently on loan to the National Gallery here, the painting of 14 sunflowers in a vase is being sold by the estate of a British family, which has owned the work for decades. 

   The artist, who once wrote to his brother Theo, "the sunflower is mine in a way," painted seven sunflower pictures. 
Christie's said the one for sale is the largest and contains the most flowers. 
Of the other six, four paintings are in major museums around the world, one was destroyed by bombings in Japan during World War II, and the last is in a private European collection.

The Netherlands is trying to organize the largest exhibition ever of Vincent 
van Gogh's paintings next year to mark the 100th anniversary of his death. The 
Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, with approximately 200 Van Goghs in its own 
storerooms, is planning to borrow at least 120 others from abroad worth an 
estimated $3 billion. The Kroeller-Mueller Museum in Otterlo, 55 miles east of 
Amsterdam, and from which two Van Goghs were stolen last December, will exhibit 
at least 230 drawings flown in from all over the world. Organizer Frits Becht 
said security would be massive during the four-month exhibition that is to end 
July 30, 1990, the centenary anniversary of the Dutch painter's death. ALEENE

   A painting of a bridge by Vincent van Gogh sold for $20,240,000. 
The price ranked second in auction history, after the astonishing $39.9 million paid for a van Gogh sunflower painting in late March. 

   Christie's International PLC, which sold the painting at auction yesterday, would say only that the successful bidder was "a private, anonymous collector bidding on the telephone." 
The second-highest bidder was Neville Keating, a London art dealer, Christie's said. 

   Richard Feigen, a New York dealer who attended the auction, said the price was somewhat higher than his own estimate. 
"I thought it would bring #10.9 million (the price was #12.7 million)," Mr. Feigen said. 
"I think this shows that you have to discount the sunflowers, because it became a bidding war between two people. 
If this had gone into that same realm, it would have meant an enormous change in the art market. 
As it is, it shows the art market is still very, very strong." 

   Mr. Feigen said he believes the bridge painting, "Le Pont de Trinquetaille," is a "better, more important painting in better condition" than the sunflower painting, which a Japanese insurance company bought. 
Japanese buyers also were evident at yesterday's sale here, where a painting by Japanese impressionist Seiki Kuroda sold to a Japanese collector for $2.8 million. 

   The $20.2 million van Gogh beats the $11,088,000 paid at Christie's last December for a painting by impressionist Edouard Manet.

   Sotheby's auction house pulled a painting
attributed to Vincent van Gogh out of a sale Tuesday after the
Amsterdam museum devoted to the artist warned it could be a fake.
   The small picture of a house with a red roof between trees and
two figures on a path, titled ``The Steps at Auvers'' (``L'Escalier
a Auvers''), had been estimated at $3.5 to $5.2 million in the
Tuesday night sale of impressionist and modern art.
   The unidentified seller bought it in 1984 at Sotheby's for
430,000 pounds, then worth about $602,000. If it is proved to be a
fake, its value would be no more than 5,000 pounds, or about
$8,500, as a curiosity.
   As the five-year period needed for a claim has expired, the
seller has no right to seek compensation from the auction house but
a Sotheby's statement said: ``We do consider our moral
obligations.''
   There is a larger version of the disputed picture in the St.
Louis Art Museum.
   The withdrawn work had been sold in Copenhagen in 1925 as a
genuine work of the artist and scholars dated it to July 1890,
shortly before van Gogh shot himself. It was exhibited as his work
in Tokyo in 1985.
   But experts at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam recently cast
doubt on its authenticity.
   As a result, Sotheby's said, they were withdrawing it from sale
pending further research.
   This year is the centenary of van Gogh's death and all his work
is being subjected to close scrutiny. Fakes of his art first
appeared in Paris soon after the turn of the century.
   Van Gogh never sold a picture in his lifetime but he has become
the most popular artist ever known.
   In 1987, his paintings of sunflowers and irises set world art
auction records and on May 15, his portrait of a doctor who had
treated him for mental illness received a new record price of $82.5
million in New York.
   The buyer was a Japanese industrialist Ryoei Saito.
   When the two-day Sotheby's sale of impressionist and modern art
started Tuesday, Seibu, the Japanese store chain, paid $3.14
million for a set of 42 colored lithographs by Marc Chagall. The
company said the price was an auction record for a set of prints.
   The works illustrated the pastoral romance of a goatherd and a
shepherdess, ``Daphnis and Chloe,'' attributed to the third century
Greek writer, Longus.
   The set of 42 lithographs was published in Paris in 1961.

Van Gogh's Last, Turbulent Work at Met Museum

   Artists, unlike cowards, die many times after their deaths. 
And the world record for posthumous dying is doubtless held by Vincent van Gogh. 
His suicide in July 1890 has not only been reenacted by Irving Stone and Kirk Douglas, it has also been celebrated in verse and in song, been described and analyzed by historians, physicians, psychologists and philosophers, and been invoked in countless museum galleries and lecture halls. 
Van Gogh's madness and death also provide the point of departure for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's exhibition "Van Gogh at Saint-Remy and Auvers" (on view until March 22). 
This blockbuster chronicles the last 15 months of the Dutch artist's life. 

   Since it is just two years since the opening of the Met's impressive "Van Gogh in Arles" exhibition, the very idea of this kind of sequel poses a question: Can we really bear witness so soon again to poor Vincent's saga, glorious as it may have been? 
The answer, happily, is a resounding yes. 
For what has now become something of a minor industry at the Met has produced yet another major show. 

   Early in May 1890, Vincent van Gogh left Arles for nearby Saint-Remy, where he sought treatment at the local asylum for what was described as "acute mania with hallucinations of sight and hearing which have caused him to mutilate himself by cutting off his right ear." 
During the time that he struggled with himself there, he produced some of his greatest paintings, including some of his most impressive self-portraits and an astonishing series of landscapes. 

   The exhibition, which consists of almost 90 works, opens with paintings and drawings done soon after the artist's arrival at Saint-Remy: studies of the grounds and interior of the asylum. 
The forthright portrayals of the asylum's vestibule and corridors are particularly affecting. 
The detailed renderings of the monastic setting, with its repetitive arches and complex perspective vistas, convey a strong, almost claustrophobic, sense of confinement. 

   The following month, when Vincent was allowed outside the asylum walls and began to work in the surrounding countryside, his paintings achieved an astonishing sense of openness and energy. 
The large gallery dedicated to the landscapes done that summer is one of the high points of the exhibition. 
These paintings not only convey a vivid sense of the violent Provencal countryside, they are also charged with powerful human emotion. 
If impressionist landscapes can be characterized as depictions of nature seen through a temperament, van Gogh's landscapes are images of a temperament imposed upon nature. 
Yet at the same time that they give a powerful sense of the artist's highly emotional response to the world around him, they are also some of the most intelligently rendered landscapes in the history of art. 

   This quality of painterly intelligence is something that is often overlooked in discussions of van Gogh's work. 
Because of the mythology that has sprung up around his life -- the halting speech, the amputated ear, the fits of insanity leading to suicide -- poor Vincent is often considered a kind of awkward madman who flailed wildly at his canvases, maniacally brushing on thick gobs of brightly colored pigment. 
In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. 

   What is so impressive about his mature paintings, and especially about these landscapes, is how careful and restrained their intricate system of paint application is, and how sharply focused the powerful emotional feeling that it expresses. 

   Van Gogh disciplined his powerful emotions, in his paintings and in his drawings, with carefully thought out systems of rhythmic marks. 
The variations in the rhythm and direction of these marks, inflected by color and the thick paint surface, express the inner rhythms of the subject itself. 
In "Green Wheat Field," for example, the varying rhythms of the brush strokes evoke the wind in the wheat, the rolling hills, the roiling sky. 
In the numerous paintings of olive trees, the violently graphic forms of the twisted branches are echoed by the rolling hills behind them, which suggests natural struggle and growth, and even a supernatural vision. 

   This larger sense of things is nowhere better seen than in the famous "Starry Night." 
Here the blazing stars and spiraling sky are a truly cosmic vision, in relation to which the works and aspirations of man (represented by the village and church steeple) appear puny indeed. 
A similar exhilaration and transcendence is also evident in the Metropolitan Museum's sonorous "Cypresses," in which field, trees, mountain and sky all share the same stupendous rolling motion, and in the eerily romantic night scene, "Road With Cypress and Star," done shortly before van Gogh left for the north, in May 1890. 

   The paintings done in Auvers-sur-Oise, some 20 miles north of Paris, are filled with the more silvery, less violently colored light of the northern spring. 
Ever sensitive to his surroundings, van Gogh again painted the surrounding countryside as spring gave way to summer, and did some very impressive portraits. 

   Perhaps the most striking of these is the expressively distorted portrait of Dr. Gachet, whom Vincent's brother Theo had asked to look after the painter at Auvers. 
Van Gogh wrote Theo that he thought the man was "as ill and distraught as you or me." 
The picture conveys an extraordinary sense of anguished melancholy and of what van Gogh once called "the heartbroken expression of our time." 

   Among the most impressive pictures in the exhibition are the unusually elongated "double-square" landscapes that van Gogh did during his last days. 
The imagery of these paintings runs from near-abstraction to high drama. 
In "Roots and Tree Trunks," the fiercely angular forms that twist and push against each other are set ambiguously against a pulsing background that verges on pure abstraction. 
In the famous "Crows Over the Wheatfield," thought by some to be the artist's last painting, the dramatic flight of the crows over the wind-swept wheat conveys an urgent sense of threat that verges on allegory. 

   In these, as in so many other of van Gogh's paintings, our experience of the familiar is transformed into something quite unfamiliar, but nonetheless vividly recognizable. 
Perhaps it is this combination of the familiar and the strange that makes his paintings so popular with general audiences. 
They speak in a language simple enough to be understood by all but at the same time subtle and complex enough to give even the most sophisticated viewer much to ponder and marvel at. 

   Ronald Pickvance's catalog offers a wealth of fascinating biographical information as well as detailed discussion of the individual pictures, all of which are reproduced in color. 
The exhibition is sponsored by E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., the Florence J. Gould Foundation and the Robert Wood Johnson Jr. Charitable Trust.

People camped out through the weekend in hopes of seeing the show before it 
closed. The "Vincent van Gogh Retrospective" offered an unprecedented 
collection of masterpieces from museums and private collections around the 
world. It closed Sunday, the 100th anniversary of the Dutch artist's death. 
Nearly 140 paintings were on display in Amsterdam's Vincent van Gogh Museum, 
which houses the world's largest Van Gogh collection. Simultaneously, 248 
drawings were on display at the Kroeller Mueller Museum in Otterlo, about 55 
miles east of Amsterdam. GREG BRAXTON

<HEAD>Museum Announces Acquisition of Van Gogh's `Irises'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MALIBU, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The J. Paul Getty Museum announced today
it has purchased its greatest 19th century painting, the
masterpiece ``Irises'' by Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh, for an
undisclosed sum.
   Painted in 1889, ``Irises'' was sold to the museum by Alan Bond,
the financially troubled Australian entrepreneur who paid a record
$53.9 million for the work at a 1987 auction.
   In keeping with its policy of not discussing details of private
acquisitions, the museum will not be disclosing the price of the
work, the Getty said in a statement.
   The painting already is on display in the museum's second-floor
galleries, where other 19th century paintings are displayed,
including works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Edouard Manet and Edvard
Munch.
   ``The chance to acquire the painting was a great moment in the
history of the museum and the trust,'' said Harold M. Williams,
president and chief executive officer of the J. Paul Getty Trust.
   Getty, the late oil baron endowed the museum with $2.1 billion,
making it the world's richest art institution.
   The painting, characteristic of van Gogh's bold style,
represents a patch of garden in a French asylum at Saint-Remy de
Provence, where the troubled artist committed himself following a
mental breakdown in Arles.
   ``This is among the most original and dynamic of all van Gogh's
compositions, in which the spearlike, slashing representation of
the flowers is echoed by the vibrancy of color,'' said George
Goldner, the Getty's curator of paintings and drawings. ``At the
same time it is a picture of great poetry, as expressed in the one
white iris on the left side which, in its isolation, has a special
poignancy.''
   The private transaction was arranged by Sotheby's New York
auction house, which had loaned Bond $27 million to buy ``Irises,''
using the painting itself as collateral.
   The unusual deal was widely criticized for inflating prices in
the international art market.
   Since Bond's financial empire began crumbling under the weight
of more than $5 billion in debt, there has been considerable
curiosity about the fate of ``Irises'' among art curators, dealers
and collectors.
   In a statement released by Sotheby's, Bond was quoted as saying,
``I am very pleased with this sale, particularly because this great
masterpiece will be on exhibition at such a pre-eminent museum.''

   Police used an undercover agent
posing as a prospective buyer today to recover three 19th-century
masterpieces, including works by Vincent van Gogh and Paul Cezanne.
   All three paintings taken from Amsterdam's Municipal Museum last
month were recovered undamaged, according to police spokesman Klaas
Wilting.
   The paintings, valued at up to $52 million, were seized when
police raided a hotel and arrested a 36-year-old man who was
selling them for $1.14 million, Wilting said. The money was
confiscated during the raid at the Pullman Hotel, he said.
   The paintings are Van Gogh's 1888 ``Carnations,'' the 1894 still
life ``Bottle with Apples'' by Cezanne, and a work by Dutch painter
Johan Jongkind, ``The House of Maitre Billaud in Nevers,'' done in
1874.
   In their pre-dawn raid, police found the Van Gogh inside the
hotel and the two other paintings in a car parked outside, Wilting
said. The artworks were wrapped in blankets, Wilting said.
   Another police spokesman, Joost van Wijngaarden, said an
undercover police officer had posed as a buyer in the deal, but he
refused to give details.
   Two other people, thought to be genuine prospective buyers, also
were arrested, police said earlier. All suspects were being held
pending charges. None were identified, in line with Dutch police
practice.
   Police refused to say whether the undercover police officer was
posing as a partner of the other two prospective buyers, or whether
police had a role in raising the substantial amount of cash.
   There was no immediate word whether the alleged seller, who has
a police burglary record, was involved in the May 20 break-in and
theft at the Municipal Museum. In that incident, a ground-floor
window was smashed to gain access to the museum.
   Last week, police received anonymous tips that buyers for the
paintings were being solicited abroad, Wilting said.
   ``We got hard evidence of that early this week and that's when
we decided to act,'' said Wilting.
   Museum director Wim Beeren said when the paintings were stolen
that they are so famous it would be almost impossible to sell them
on the open market. He speculated they were stolen on commission by
a private collector.
   The three works were only insured for fire damage, but Beeren
said at the time the huge loss estimate was due in part to the
record prices paid for recently auctioned van Goghs.
   Last November, a collector paid $53 million for van Gogh's
``Irises'' at a New York auction and eight months earlier, the
artist's ``Sunflowers'' was auctioned in London for $29.8 million.
   However, experts at the Christie's auction firm in London said
soon after the Amsterdam burglary that the three paintings together
were worth just $11 million, with van Gogh's estimated at about $2
million. Experts at the Amsterdam museum put the value of the three
at up to $52 million.
   The smashed window in the May burglary at the Municipal Museum
triggered an electronic alarm at the museum's private security
firm, which reportedly took 20 minutes to warn police and
investigate the burglary.
   The museum holds about 3,200 mainly 19th and 20th-century
artworks, but has had no night guard since 1975, when
round-the-clock surveillance was abolished as an economy measure.
