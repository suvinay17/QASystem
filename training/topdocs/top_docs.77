FT  17 SEP 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Why grown men dream
of a future with Barbie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The history of the US Mattel Toys company is the tale of everyday business
folk and a highly successful piece of plastic called Barbie. Last year the
company sold 54m fashion dolls.
This year it is likely to be 65m. 'When you do the arithmetic, that means
somewhere around the world we sell two Barbie dolls every second of every
day of every year,' says John Amerman, Mattel's silver-haired chairman and
chief executive. 'We think we are pretty good at meeting the desires and
dreams of little girls.'
Although Barbie's appeals have waned little throughout its 33-year history,
Mattel's shareholders have not always seen the rewards of it. Five years
ago, the company slumped to a net loss of Dollars 113m (Pounds 57.3m) as it
struggled with high overheads and an unresponsive management structure. But
since then, the company has staged a strong turnaround and last year
recorded operating income of Dollars 113m with analysts expecting further
improvement this year.
The main architect of the revival has been Amerman who has pragmatically
followed some classic marketing prescriptions to return the company to
profitability.
'I like to view Mattel as a consumer packaged goods company that just
happens to sell toys,' he says.
One of the most striking characteristics of the process has been the
constant product innovation which has been essential to increase sales. 'In
the US, about 95 per cent of girls between the ages of three to eight have a
Barbie doll and these girls have an average of seven dolls each. It is
important with a product like Barbie to have clear market segmentation,'
says Amerman.
Mattel boasts a standard My First Barbie doll which retails in the US for
less than Dollars 5.
But in her time, Barbie has also been a beach babe, a Mod, an airline pilot
and a Unicef ambassador. Mattel expects that one of her latest incarnations
as the Ultra Hair Barbie - complete with curlers and styling gels - will
sell 10m items in more than 100 countries.
At any one time there are about 50 models on sale, including limited-line
collectors' items. Mattel has recently discovered it can push the price of
special dolls far higher than previously imagined, breaking through the
Dollars 10 barrier.
Ideas for new dolls stem from several sources. The company conducts 'focus'
group work with girls in different countries to see how they respond to
concepts and has built up an extensive library of girls' magazines to keep
track of changing trends. The company employs 500 designers, development
engineers and model makers who constantly review and revise the Barbie line.
But Mattel has also learnt that it continually has to stimulate the consumer
market by means of heavy advertising and in-store promotions. Analysts
estimate the company spends up to 17 per cent of turnover promoting its
brands.
Mattel has also been able to generate greater consumer interest by winning
additional display space from retailers. To this end, Mattel began a
customer service programme three years ago visiting the biggest toy retail
chains and devising ways of improving operational relationships. Lower
prices have also led to increased sales volumes.
But there are signs that Barbie in the US is reaching the limits of growth
and Mattel is now rapidly expanding into other toy markets and pushing
Barbie harder overseas, where it already accounts for half of all sales.
'The future of our company is in international markets. The wants and
desires of little girls are the same around the world, whether it is combing
a doll's hair, changing their clothes, playing with Ken or thinking about
being an astronaut,' says Amerman.

   A shimmering pink carpet was rolled out in front
of the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center on Monday night for
1,200 guests attending an unusual gala.
   Inside, women received wristlets of pink roses as they entered a
hall adorned with pink festoons. Waiters served pink champagne, or
rosy-hued Perrier if guests preferred, to accompany canapes served
on platters bedecked with pink orchids.
   Lights flashed as cameras recorded several stage and television
celebrities taking part in the festivities.
   But the star of the event didn't blink an eye. That's not
surprising _ she was Barbie, the doyen of fashion dolls who was
being honored for 30 years as a phenomenally successful toy.
   Mattel Inc. billed the black-tie affair as Barbie's ``Pink
Jubilee'' anniversary party. Company executives said the lavish
party was a fitting tribute to a toy that has shown such remarkable
longevity _ and profitability.
   ``Whatever the cost is, I think it's worth it,'' said John W.
Amerman, Mattel's chairman and chief executive officer.
   ``We don't spare the expense in presenting Barbie in a
first-class way,'' added Robert Sansone, Mattel's president.
   Although her popularity has waned now and then, Barbie has never
fallen completely out of favor. She has been one of the most
consistent toys in an industry notorious for quickly fading fads.
Barbie was the nation's second biggest selling toy last year, after
Nintendo video games, according to Toy &amp; Hobby World magazine.
   Each year, Barbie dolls pull in $450 million to $500 million in
revenue for Mattel.
   Part of the doll's success is credited to her adaptability. As
lifestyles and fashions changed over the years, Barbie's clothes and
accessories kept pace.
   Guests at Barbie's party were entertained by teen-aged girls
performing the ``Barbie Rap'' and doing the ``Barbie'' dance. The
rap number was interspersed with spoken tributes from several female
celebrities, including singer Melba Moore and actresses Allison
Smith, of the television show ``Kate &amp; Allie,'' and Nancy Dussault,
who has performed in the Broadway play ``Into The Woods.''
   New York Mayor Edward Koch marked the occasion by sending fan
mail. Mattel's Sansone read the mayor's letter before introducing
the entertainment.
   ``She has always reflected the times, and today stimulates the
imagination and delight of another generation,'' Koch wrote.
``Barbie's appearance in a wide variety of ethnic guises makes her a
great toy for New York, a city which draws unique energy from its
unparalleled ethnic diversity.''
   An audio-visual retrospective of the doll's 30 years set to tunes
on the pop charts during the different periods catalogued Barbie's
numerous wardrobe changes.
   In the early 1960s, a conservatively dressed Barbie was depicted
as a wholesome 21-year-old with a fun-loving streak who turned up,
bikini-clad, at beach parties every so often.
   Later on, Barbie donned ``mod'' clothing and her normally
clean-cut boyfriend Ken grew his hair almost shoulder length.
   More recently, Barbie has become a briefcase-toting career woman.
   This year finds Barbie characterized as a super star, decked out
in a star-encrusted tulle gown as the reigning queen of the fashion
doll world.

   LOS ANGELES -- Mattel Inc. said it signed an exclusive
licensing agreement with Price Stern Sloan Inc. to produce a
series of books, including a cookbook, based on its Barbie
doll toy.
   The books will add to a plethora of products Mattel is
introducing around the image of Barbie, the world's
best-selling plastic playmate. Already, the toy maker has
unvieled several new Barbie Style products, including a line
of girl-sized costumes, bed sheets and accessories.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Over time, Mattel has said it plans to take Barbie beyond
the toy category and into children's clothing, beauty
products and other consumer goods -- hoping that by doing so,
the company will bolster sales of the doll.
   Mattel said it is considering several proposals from movie
producers to take Barbie to the silver screen. A Mattel
spokesman said a decision on whether to make a movie hasn't
been made. One consideration the company has always had is
that a Barbie movie, which would show how the doll supposedly
sounds and acts, would impinge on each individual girl's
fantasies about the doll, the Mattel spokesman said.
   Barbie accounted for $600 million of Mattel's $1.2 billion
in total revenue for 1989.
   Los Angeles-based Price Stern Sloan, a publisher and
distributor of children's books, said it plans to introduce
the first of several lines of Barbie books in the spring of
1991.
   In addition, Price Stern said that in July, it entered
into a licensing agreement with Walt Disney Co. to produce an
electronic wand with a Mickey Mouse head and to publish six
books featuring Disney characters.

<TEXT>     Black Perkins, who is principal designer for Mattel Toys' fashion dolls,
works out of a studio in a top-secret design center in El Segundo. Each year
she creates 100 fashions for Barbie, the company's billion-dollar baby.;   
Picking up a blond Barbie swathed in pink, Black Perkins with a gentle rip of
Velcro removes a petal overskirt from Barbie's costume-ball gown. Holding it
to her face, she demonstrates how the overskirt doubles as a costume mask for
Barbie's owners.;    "Barbie's clothes are designed to have a lot of play
value," she explains.;    She holds up another Barbie. This one is wearing a
ruffled pink overskirt that, detached and reattached as a hem flounce,
converts a short gown to long. Or, Barbie can toss aside the ruffles on her
pretty white apron and "she's ready to cook.";    Fantasy wardrobe;  If most
of those little girls who own a Barbie -- and most are little girls -- have
never seen their mothers in either pink flounces or a frilly apron, never
mind. Barbie doesn't concern herself with criticisms from feminists that she
is a bimbo, a shop-till-you-drop airhead, a Barbie doll, if you will.;   
"This is not the way adults dress, and it's not the way they're going to dress
as adults," acknowledges Mattel spokeswoman Donna Gibbs. But, she adds, "They
live reality. They want to play fantasy.";    "If it's pretty," Black Perkins
says, "little girls want it." (If it's orange, or green, they probably won't,
she has found.);    Black Perkins did not set out to become designer to the
superstar of toyland. Growing up in South Carolina, she says, "I never had a
Barbie doll." She was 28 before she ever saw a Barbie. That was one fateful
day in the summer of 1976 when she answered a newspaper ad placed by Mattel.; 
  During that job interview -- to which she brought six years' experience
designing clothes for real people -- she was asked to take a Barbie home and
to bring her back in a week wearing a Black Perkins creation.;    What she
created was a floral print voile jumpsuit with full, tiered legs and puff
sleeves and matching wide-brimmed hat. "Really stylish," she recalled, "almost
like a garden party outfit.";    That jumpsuit never went into production, but
it got her the job. Black Perkins was incredulous -- "I couldn't believe they
actually paid people to do that.";    Right off, there were a few adjustments
to be made. As a student at Los Angeles Trade Technical College and later as a
designer for both junior and couture houses in Los Angeles, Black Perkins had
never created for a mannequin only 11 1/2 inches tall. (For the record, Barbie
has a 3 1/2-inch waist, a 5 1/2-inch bust and 5-inch hips.);    Although there
are seven other Barbie costume designers, and eight more who create her
accessories, Black Perkins designs about a fifth of what goes into Barbie's
bulging closets. She scours magazines, snoops through stores, goes to couture
shows in Europe.;    Although Black Perkins does buy on the open market,
increasingly fabrics are custom-spun at Mattel facilities in the Far East,
Europe and Mexico, where the doll and clothes are made.;    Although
seamstresses can fashion two bouffant skirts and 20 bodices for Barbie gowns
out of a mere eighth of a yard of fabric, 75 million yards of fabric have gone
into Barbie fashions over the years.;    The clothes for Barbie and Ken are
unisize, to fit all 11 male and female dolls in the Mattel fashion group.;   
On the conference table in front of Black Perkins stands Christie, Barbie's
black friend who was introduced in 1968. She wears a white lace bridal gown
with a tiny waist, big sleeves and detachable bridal bouquet.;    Christie is
a beautiful "bride," but, in designing for Barbie and boyfriend Ken and
assorted kith and kin, Black Perkins never loses sight of the fact that Barbie
is the star, "always.";    Annual wedding gown;  Barbie gets a new bridal gown
each year, and each year it's her top-selling fashion, with more than 5
million gowns sold. Of course, Black Perkins says, "It doesn't mean Barbie is
getting married. It just means she's dreaming about it." Barbie will never get
married. That would spoil the fantasy.;    Barbie is big business. In 1959 --
the year the doll was introduced -- Mattel sold 351,000 Barbies at $3 retail.
The company estimates sales of 600 million Barbies in 1990.;    A very basic
Barbie, with only undergarments, sells today for $6 or less. But Mattel
selling Barbie dolls is like Eveready selling flashlights. Flashlights require
batteries. Barbie requires clothes. Lots of clothes. To date, Barbie owners
have bought 250 million units of Barbie clothes and accessories. A lame gown
from Barbie's haute couture "private collection" may carry an $8 price tag,
but most are in the $3 to $4 range.;    The Barbie phenomenon has fascinated
psychologists and other observers of the popular culture. Black Perkins has
her own theory. When her 6-year-old daughter, Erika Nicole Perkins, plays with
Barbie, she explains, "She's in control. I'm still in control of what she's
wearing, but Barbie is hers."  </TEXT>

   (During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 

   BARBIE, A WELL-GROOMED PLATINUM BLONDE standing less than a foot tall, arrived in 1959 as toylands first "fashion doll." 
Her debut was greeted with skepticism. 
No child (or, more importantly, no parent) would buy a full-fashioned doll, the experts said. 
Last Year, Barbie and her well-dressed playmates produced more than $450 million for Mattel Inc. of California. 
In 30 years, children have bought and dressed more than 500 million of them. 
Mattel figures that 90% of girls aged 3 to 11 own at least one Barbie. 

   Ruth Handler, whose husband, Elliott, had started Mattel, created Barbie, naming her after their daughter Barbara. 
When Barbie caught on (351,000 were sold the first year at $3 a copy) Mrs. Handler produced Barbie's friend Ken, named for their son, a gallery of companions and a stable of pets and favorite cars (the latest, a Ferrari). 

   Barbie, who began as a teen-age fashion model, has appeared as a ballerina, a nurse, a flight attendant, an astronaut, a candy striper, a TV newscaster and a rock star. 
Each role, of course, meant a fresh wardrobe. 
Mattel sells some 20 million new outfits a year at $1 to $8 apiece. 

   The Handlers themselves did not fare quite as well. 
In 1974, the Securities and Exchange Commission descended on the company, charging that it had been reporting false earnings to keep the stock price high. 
The Handlers were forced out as directors and co-chairmen (but not as stockholders) and left saying they "deeply regretted" any damage. 

   But Ruth Handler hadn't lost her creative touch. 
After undergoing a mastectomy in 1970, she found that no one was producing suitable prostheses. 
So she designed her own, called "Nearly Me," and thus began another successful business. 

   And doll makers didn't forget the Handlers. 
This year they were inducted into the toy industry's Hall of Fame at a New York gala.

   On Anika Polzin's first trip outside her native
East Germany in November her parents bought her a Barbie doll.
   Now on her second excursion to the western world the
six-year-old is getting wined and dined _ make that milkshaked and
hamburgered _ by Barbie's corporate parents.
   Mattel Inc., manufacturer of the famous fashion doll, brought
Miss Polzin and her family over for a five-day holiday in New York.
They will be guests at a black-tie affair Mattel is hosting tonight
to mark the beginning of the annual American International Toy Fair
and to announce what the company is calling the ``Barbie Summit.''
   Patricia Wyatt, director of marketing for girls toys at Mattel,
said the company thought it was fitting to have Miss Polzin on hand
when they revealed plans for the event that is to be held each year
starting with the first three-day conference in New York during the
week of Nov. 19. Essay contests will be held for girls of varying
ages to compete to become ``delegates.''
   ``Through Barbie we want to bring children from around the world
together,'' Ms. Wyatt said, speaking in the almost reverential
tones Mattel people use in referring to a toy that has been a
must-have for many little girls since being introduced 31 years ago.
   Mattel reckons that enough Barbies have been sold in the doll's
lifetime that if placed head to toe they would circle the earth 3{
times. Sales of the dolls plus her entourage and their
accouterments exceeded $450 million in 1988 and accounted for 40
percent of Hawthorne, Calif.-based Mattel's total revenue.
   The summit will ``give children a forum to express their
viewpoints'' ... and ``help them share their different cultures
with one another,'' Ms. Wyatt said in an interview.
   A new Barbie Summit doll _ appropriately available in four
ethnic distinctions _ outfitted in a shimmering white ensemble will
debut at Toy Fair, an annual trade show. Proceeds from sales of the
doll will be placed in a Barbie Fund, which Mattel will donate to
children's charities.
   The towheaded Miss Polzin was tuckered out Friday afternoon from
a busy day of sightseeing, shopping and a visit to Rumpelmayer's
Restaurant, a favorite Manhattan watering hole with the young,
ice-cream eating set. But she handled an interview at her Waldorf
Astoria suite with admirable aplomb and smiled sweetly for
photographs.
   It was a picture of a beaming Anika clutching a new Barbie that
first attracted Mattel's attention.
   ``We were very moved by the photo,'' Ms. Wyatt said. ``It was
nice to know that Barbie transcended cultures.''
   The caption on the photo, which appeared in newspapers around
the world, gave her name and hometown, Schwanefeld, East Germany.
It said she was photographed after a day of western-style shopping
in Helmstedt, West Germany.
   Mattel's German affiliates easily tracked down Miss Polzin. Only
a few inquiries were needed to trace her in Schwanefeld, a tiny
village, population 270, a few miles from the border with West
Germany.
   Miss Polzin, wearing a new dress and complementing hot-pink
tights, said through an interpreter that she was enjoying her trip
to the United States.
   But signs of jet lag were still evident as she sat on a sofa
beside Minnie Mouse. She and her 10-year-old brother, Maik, and
parents, Eva and Inglof, who works for the East German railroad,
arrived late Thursday night from Frankfurt on a flight courtesy of
Lufthansa airlines.
   They already had been to the Statue of Liberty, and outings to
the Empire State Building, museums and, of course, FAO Schwarz were
planned.

   If it weren't for kids, there wouldn't be so many excuses for
adults to visit toy departments at holiday time. There are
thousands of toys marketed, so parents have plenty of fun ahead of
them before letting the youngsters take over. Here is the barest
sampling of what's in the stores:
   DOLLS. Classic baby dolls and what might be called role model
dolls prevail.
   - The Magic Nursery Baby has to arrive before its new owner can
determine its sex, just like a real baby. Each doll comes with a
homecoming garment that dissolves in water, revealing a packet with
a card that tells whether it's a boy or girl. Every 36th doll sold
will have a card that says it's a twin, and a second doll will be
on the way when the card is redeemed with Mattel, the maker.
   - If twins aren't enough, how about Quints? Five little dolls,
complete with accessories that are color coded (to tell them apart,
of course), come from Tyco Toys.
   - Then there's a new batch from the patch. Cabbage Patch Kids
with different facial features, eye colors, hair styles and skin
tones in as many variations as the owners themselves come in
Birthday Kids, Babyland Kids, Kids' Kids that pose, and Babies
reeking of baby powder. Now marketed by Hasbro, Cabbage Patchers
still come with their individual adoption certificates and
thousands of outfits to choose from.
   - Dolls heading out in the world include the Mommy Doll from
Tootsietoy, depicting the working mothers of real life. Briefcases,
jogging sweats, granny gowns, car keys, laundry baskets and babies
of their own accessorize these model moms. According to Cindy
Stern, who created the doll (with toy clothing designer Sue Ogden),
most mothers choose versions of the doll that most resemble
themselves.
   - Artistic aspirations are captured by My Pretty Ballerina by
Tyco Toys. This doll, dressed in tights and leg warmers, can dance
on point and execute arabesques or pirouettes. She comes with her
own practice barre. Separate accessories are performance ensembles
with costume pieces and cassette tapes with music from ``The
Nutcracker Suite'' and ``Swan Lake.''
   - What's a model of a model? It could be a doll from the Real
Model Collection by Matchbook Toys, fashion plates depicting
Christie Brinkley, Cheryl Tiegs or Beverly Johnson. Each doll comes
with portfolio, fashion changes, autographed pictures and beauty
booklet. The real Brinkley, Tiegs and Johnson are donating part of
their doll sales royalties to The Make-A-Wish Foundation.
   - Barbie probably is the Grande Dame of all fashion dolls, and
new versions from Mattel include the Ice Capades Barbie, Barbie and
The Beat, My First Princess, Wedding Fantasy, Air Force Barbie,
Barbie's All-Stars, Nigerian Barbie and Brazilian Barbie. Barbie
also has her first Bob Mackie gown, which the designer created for
the first in a series of collector Barbies.
   - Fashion consciousness has hit paper dolls, too. Lookin' Pretty
Dolls from Ohio Art come with press-on, peel-off vinyl fashions
that can be stored in their own carry-cases.
   - Old-world charm characterizes the Canneto Dolls from Hasbro,
made by a family in Italy. The dolls recall those grandmother had,
with country-print dresses trimmed in lace and flowers, straw or
lacy bonnets and floral bouquets. The dolls come with brushable
hair and soft bodies in baby dolls, toddlers, and little girls.
   CUDDLIES. Plenty of plush, but personalities are emerging.
   - A little fellow called F.R.O.Y.D. is sort of odd looking. He's
yellow, has a Cyrano-type nose and wears a button that says ``I
believe in you!'' He was discovered on a drawing pad one day by
former jewelry designer Carolyne Greene, who got him ready for his
debut in the toy world. F.R.O.Y.D. (for ``I'm for the reality of
your dreams'') says he was there to encourage Columbus, helping him
believe there really was something on the other side of the ocean.
He says he helped Thomas Edison see light bulbs, and Gorbachev find
a new way for Russia. ``Encouraging people to have the confidence
to make their dreams come true is my favorite thing to do. And I
don't need batteries. You can say the only accessory I come with is
your imagination.''
   - Another comforting character is Snobell, a reindeer in plush
from Applause. This pure white reindeer gets his name from the six
bells on his antlers that keep him from disappearing in the snow.
He has gray gloves and a green scarf with red tassels.
   - Also from Applause are Tiny Toons plush toys based on
characters in the Stephen Spielberg animated feature of that name.
These are teen-aged Bugs and Daffy offshoots, including Buster and
Babs Bunny, Plucky Duck, Hamton, Dizzy Devil and Montana Max.
   - Now five years old and still going strong is Teddy Ruxpin, the
talking bear from Worlds of Wonder. Said to be the world's first
animated talking toy, Teddy communicates to kids with moving eyes,
mouth and voice from casettes. This year he comes up with some new
Adventure Series tapes and storybooks, including the Do-Along
Songbook and Fire Safety with Teddy Ruxpin.

courts. But beneath the arid prose of the warring briefs pulses a desperate

<HEADLINE>  THE SAD CASE OF BARBIE VS. MISS AMERICA  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Stories  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Not the real Miss America, but a new doll based on Miss America, introduced
in February as a joint venture between the Miss America Pageant and Kenner
Products.;    "Miss America" is Kenner's attempt to crack Barbie's 32-year
stranglehold on the toy category known as "fashion dolls." But in March
Barbie's parent, Mattel Inc., complained to Customs that two of the five "Miss
America" models look too much like Barbie.;    Back in 1977, Mattel
copyrighted Barbie's head, making her eternal look of compliant joy a
protected expression -- literally. In April, Customs made a preliminary
finding that Mattel might have a point, and seized a shipment of the "Miss
America" dolls from China, pending a full review. Kenner is now has taken its
case to the 2nd Circuit.;    Miss America's attorney, Carol F. Simkin, says in
papers filed in court that Mattel is trying to assert copyright ownership of
the ineffable.;    "There can be no infringement because the only
similarities, if any, between the doll heads lie not in protectable
expression," said Simkin, "but in those generic features necessary to depict a
fashion doll head and in the common elements inherent in the human face.";   
Arthur J. Levine, Barbie's lawyer, says, "We have absolutely no problem with
anyone creating an 11 1/2-inch doll that Barbie's clothes fit on. But when you
come too close to an American icon, we don't like it.";    Only the face and
head are at issue in the case, which was publicized earlier this month by
Legal Times. While the bodies of the dolls seem astonishingly similar -- the
same impossibly elongated thighs, the same bullet-like breasts, the same
hinged shoulders and convenient pelvic vagueness -- Mattel alleges that two of
the Miss Americas, made from the same mold and named "Devon" and "Tonya,"
stole the design for the head. They also reserved the right to take action
against "Blair," telling customs that only "Racquel" and "Justine" pass
muster.;    To read the briefs is to be swept into a confusing debate over how
American womanhood is idealized in toys.;    Barbie ends up arguing that she
is an act of creative expression as legally "protectable" as a cartoon or a
poem; that she looks nothing like a human being.;    Miss America says that,
if you're going to manufacture stereotypes of feminine beauty, then of course
they're all going to look alike.;    "The faces of fashion dolls must have the
pretty features expected of most fashion models," says Miss America's brief.
"They also must have the stock features commonly used in the toy industry to
make a fashion doll head look attractive, including pert noses, eyes that are
made-up and exaggerated in terms of both size and distance from each other . .
. smiling, full lips, painted-on eyebrows and similarly sized heads.";   
Barbie argues that Kenner's designers might have unconsciously imitated
Barbie: If you're trying to generate an ideal of feminine beauty, this
argument goes, your thoughts are just naturally going to turn to Barbie.;   
Lawyers on both sides of the case -- expected to be decided in the next few
months -- express the belief that there is a somber legal matter at issue
here. Kenner is arguing that a federal court should be able to quickly decide
whether Miss America infringes Barbie's copyright. Barbie -- joined by a
heavyweight coalition of American business interests who have a stake in
preventing imports of cheap foreign knock-offs of their products -- argue that
Kenner's motion would undercut Customs' power to seize infringing imports.;   
Miss America, on the other hand, charges "that Mattel was more concerned with
damaging a competitor's business than protecting its own alleged copyright."; 
  But it's over the specific looks of the dolls that the real biting and
scratching takes place.;    "Devon's eyes are larger and differently shaped
than Barbie's and are positioned near the vertical middle of the head," says
the Kenner brief, "whereas Barbie's eyes are smaller, flatter and lower on the
head; the bridge of Devon's nose is much fuller and her nostrils are less
defined than Barbie's; Devon's lips are thicker and form an open smile, while
Barbie's smile is closed and shows less teeth.";    Unasked in all this legal
activity is the question of which busty, plasticene young lady is the better
role model for America's little girls.;    On the one hand, Barbie has an
impressive resume these days: She is in the Army and the Navy; she has tried
stints as an astronaut, a scuba diver, a doctor, an executive, a rock star and
a veterinarian.;    On the other hand: Can Barbie play the ocarina?  </TEXT>

<HL> Go Ahead, Make My Day: Or How
Barbie Left a New Doll in the Dust

   Things are tough all over. 
The stock market is crashing. 
The Democrats are running out of candidates. 
And Jem is losing her one-year-old fight with Barbie. 

   Let us explain. 

   Jem is actually a doll, introduced by Hasbro Inc. last year to challenge Mattel Inc.'s Barbie. 
And for a while, the 27-year-old champion was showing her age. 

   If Barbie was the All-American teenager, Jem -- according to the "story line" that Hasbro gave her -- was a woman of the '80s. 
By day she was an executive, running a music store. 
At night, however, she became the gyrating leader of a rock band. 
Moreover, she had what every young toy dreams of: her own TV cartoon show. 

   But Barbie, who has been through a few changes herself, wasn't about to give way to the competition. 
The veteran quickly acquired an after-hours wardrobe of miniskirts and spandex tights, a spiked hair-do, a rock band of her own and a new boyfriend: her drummer Derek. (Faithful Ken was temporarily dumped.) 

   Mattel's counterattack worked. 
"Suddenly the customers had the option of choosing between a rock star and a rock star and they got a little confused," says Stephen Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing for Hasbro. 
As a result, the lesser-known Jem suffered. 
Hasbro admits it made a few mistakes with the doll. 
For one, Jem was on the homely side, a problem that plastic surgery has since corrected. 

   This year Barbie's sales will top $200 million, vs. only a few million dollars for Jem, estimates Rick Anguilla, editor of Toy and Hobby World, a trade magazine. 
Barbie ranks as the nation's second best-selling toy (behind Hasbro's G.I. Joe), while Jem -- who never got higher than No. 16 -- has fallen off the Top 20 list. 

   Her future "depends on how well she does this Christmas season," says Mr. Schwartz. 
"The truth is we underestimated Barbie a little bit." 

   But it may be too late. 
Harry E. Wells III, an analyst for Adams Harkness &amp; Hill Inc. in Boston, often judges the success of a toy by its reception among the friends of his daughters, all of whom are of doll-buying age. 
Mr. Wells says he never hears the girls mention Jem's name, a sure sign that "Jem's in deep trouble." 

   Meanwhile, Mattel's new "story line" has Barbie back with Ken. 
Retailers report that Ken now has a thicker neck and a bigger Adam's apple. 
Probably from working out.

RECORD SALES SEND MATTEL'S PROFIT UP 26% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing help from Barbie and a strong performance in foreign markets, Mattel 
Inc. reported Thursday that record sales drove its third-quarter earnings up 
26% to $47.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawthorne-based company said sales for the three months ending Sept. 29 
totaled $490 million, compared to $410 million for the same period in 1989. The 
third period is crucial to toy and game manufacturers because it marks the 
first half of retailers' Christmas buying season. 
</P>
<P>
The surge for Mattel, the No. 2 U.S. toy maker in terms of sales, came during a 
period of economic uncertainty for the industry. Wall Street analysts said 
industrywide sales this year have been relatively flat. With a 38% increase in 
foreign sales during the third quarter and a traditionally strong presence 
abroad, Mattel would be buoyed during a further slowdown in the U.S. economy, 
said Gary Jacobson, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Domestically, the toy industry is facing very sluggish demand," Jacobson said. 
"On the international front, business is booming, and Mattel is being helped by 
the weaker (value) of the U.S. dollar in world markets." 
</P>
<P>
The weaker dollar makes Mattel products less expensive and more competitive 
abroad, but many buyers in the United States and Europe are also lured by some 
of the toy maker's newer products, said John W. Amerman, Mattel's chairman and 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Among the sales leaders are Magic Nursery dolls. The large toy is packaged in a 
hospital gown that dissolves in water, leaving underlying clothing and a card 
bearing information on the doll's sex. The Disney Preschool line of toys, 
introduced in 1988, also is enjoying strong sales, Amerman said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Barbie -- introduced 31 years ago -- is still the biggest financial 
boon to Mattel. A 30% increase in foreign sales of Barbie dolls helped boost 
the foreign portion of sales to 55%, Amerman said. Typically, about 50% of 
Mattel's business stems from foreign sales. 
</P>
<P>
"This shows that we're gaining market share around the world," Amerman said. 
"Our competitors are having more difficulty. . . .Our products are well-suited 
for international consumers." 
</P>
<P>
Barbie sales, which account for about 45% of all of Mattel's annual business, 
are surging because other toy makers are concentrating more of their resources 
on toys and games for boys, said Carol Palmer, an analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps 
in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been less competition in girls' lines," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer said Mattel has outperformed industry expectations. She said it is now 
gaining on Hasbro, the No. 1 U.S. toy maker. Hasbro reported an earnings 
increase of 6% in the third quarter, but its sales have not been rising as 
rapidly as Mattel's.

<LEADPARA>  At age 32, Barbie is doing better than ever, and so is the doll's
manufacturer, Mattel Inc.;   More than three decades after she was introduced,
Barbie is expected to post sales for Mattel this year of more than $800
million, up 10 percent from last year and almost double the level of four
years ago. She is far and away Mattel's most important product, accounting for
half the company's revenues.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  AT AGE 32, BARBIE GIVES MATTEL NEW LIFE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Mattel's success in increasing Barbie's appeal after all these years says a
lot about why its stock price has nearly doubled in the last year and
quadrupled since 1988. It closed Friday on the New York Stock Exchange at
$28.75, down 13 cents but near its 52-week high of $29.50.;   After years of
weakening finances and misguided marketing strategies, analysts said, Mattel
has pulled itself together by giving new life to Barbie and its other
established toys and by cautiously investing in new toy lines that have the
potential to be steady sellers.;   Mattel's recent flair for reading the
tastes of children and their parents is not limited to Barbie. It has built
its large-doll business to more than $200 million in sales this year from $50
million four years ago with new products like Li'l Miss Singing Mermaid, one
of the hits of the current Christmas season. Sales of its Hot Wheels toy cars
have doubled, to more than $100 million, in the same period.;   Mattel has
also cautiously stepped up its licensing deals. It just signed an agreement to
sell dolls based on the Flintstones and other animated characters from
Hanna-Barbera Productions Inc.;   Last month, Mattel solidified and expanded
its relationship with Walt Disney Co. The companies extended their existing
deal, under which Mattel sells a line of Disney preschool and infant toys, for
10 years.;   The arrangement also allows Mattel to develop and sell toys based
on Disney characters not covered by the previous agreement, including
Pinocchio, Bambi and Dumbo.;   Analysts give the credit for Mattel's
turnaround to a management team led by John W. Amerman, who took over as
Mattel's chief executive in 1987 and set out to shore up the company's
finances while refocusing its marketing and product-development efforts on
Barbie and a few other core products.;   "The numbers the management team . .
. put on the board are most impressive," said David Leibowitz, an analyst at
the American Securities Corp. in New York.;   While Mattel has shored up its
product line and its marketing, it has also greatly strengthened its balance
sheet. Four years ago, said James A. Eskridge, Mattel's chief financial
officer, the company was saddled with $400 million in debt, much of it
demanding interest payments as high as 15 percent.;   "In those four years,
we've taken sales from $1 billion to $1.5 billion, thrown off cash in excess
of $100 million in each of those years, repaid all of the high-cost debt and
quadrupled our equity," Eskridge said.  </TEXT>

FT  29 OCT 94 / Barbie - the virgin queen of a plastic paradise - The
world's most famous doll is 35 but never ages / A look back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been quite a year for Barbie, the most popular doll in history. Born
on March 9 1959, her 35th birthday has been celebrated all over the world;
Columbia Studios is bidding for the rights to make her a film star; and
Sheik Khaled Al Madkour, president of a committee in Kuwait City which
advises the government on religious issues, has declared that to buy her is
forbidden by Islam.
There is no such veto in Monte Carlo where the National Museum is hosting an
exhibition in her honour. It is drawn from the collection of one person:
Jean-Pierre Icardo, an office worker from Nice who has 'between 700 and 800'
Barbie dolls. Now 40, he first saw Barbie in 1964, the year she was
introduced to France. He has been her faithful admirer ever since.
As a child, Icardo was enchanted by all forms of decoration and wanted to
work in the theatre or cinema. As he grew up, he made his own theatrical
tableaux at home and put on entertainments for his friends, using dolls as
actors. But traditional dolls were stiff and it was not possible to dress or
pose them satisfactorily. Barbie, with her long legs, slim body and
beautiful outfits, was the perfect solution. 'I fell in love,' he says,
simply.
After attending Nice University, he took an office job and continued to
weave his theatrical dreams at home, always with Barbie as his star. His
collection grew slowly: the dolls were expensive and his mother saved up to
buy them for him as birthday and Christmas gifts. 'I believed I was unique,'
he says. 'I had no idea there were other grown-ups who were collecting.'
In March 1984, though, a convention of doll and automata collectors was held
in Monaco. Icardo and his mother went along and were astonished to find all
the paraphernalia of an established Barbie collectors' market, including
books with descriptions of the dolls and how to recognise their ages and
dates. In fact, adult collecting of Barbie began in the US in the 1970s and
the first Barbie encyclopaedia was written in 1975. Now, there are Barbie
conventions every year.
Collectors often specialise, some buying only Barbie and shunning her family
and friends, some buying only Barbies from the 1960s, now the most expensive
period. Icardo tries to collect everything from 1964 onwards, conceding that
his collection grows 'only very slowly - the world of Barbie is so huge'.
Mattel, the company that created Barbie, makes limited editions especially
for the collectors' market. Unique examples of older or special dolls, such
as the very early versions made in ivory white plastic, now change hands for
up to Dollars 4,000.
Icardo's devotion extends to Barbie's friends and relations. This year, he
told me, is also the 30th anniversary of her sister Skipper. Her best
friend, Midge, will have her 30th anniversary next year. Ken, Barbie's
faithful consort, was born in 1961. 'But she will never marry Ken,' Icardo
insists. 'She must stay the young teenager for ever.'
When first launched, Barbie was not popular with parents who, rather like
Sheikh Khaled, thought her 'too sexy'. Her popularity with young girls was
instant, however, and there are thought to be 700m of her worldwide. Today,
Barbie and Ken lead a hectic life as their clothes, make-up and hair styles
change constantly with the times: last year alone, Barbie had 100 outfits
from which to choose.
While Barbie's unique proportions have never changed, Ken has been altered
several times. His earliest skinny body has been made bigger and his fragile
flock velvet hair (now much prized if found in pristine condition) replaced
with more practical paint or, for special occasions, wigs.
Their world, too, has expanded from homely junior proms and fraternity
meetings to a frantic round of globe-trotting and activities that include
every kind of sport, making television programmes and even ballet dancing.
Barbie's circle of friends reflects a changing America. Her first black
friend, a girl doll dating from the mid-1960s, was followed by the grown-up
Brad in 1970 and Cara and Curtis in 1975. The first Hispanic and Asiatic
friends appeared in the 1980s and an American Indian was added to the circle
recently.
The all-American girl has only recently been made at home, though.
Originally manufactured in Japan from 1959, Barbie's production cycle has
followed the global trail of multi-national investment and new sources of
cheap labour. She is now made at 15 locations in seven countries: Mexico,
China, Malaysia, Indonesia, UK and Italy, as well as the US.
Some Barbies were produced briefly under licence in various countries, so
allowing regional differences to creep in; this resulted in her being more
sun-tanned in Spain and smaller, with huge cartoon-style eyes, in Japan. But
this has been stopped and uniformity reigns. Icardo considers this 'very
sad'.
Barbie, of course, is not just a pretty face. When I expressed a certain
envy of her lifestyle, and pointed out that she never had to work for a
living, Icardo was quick to disagree. 'She always works,' he said. 'She has
been a model and a singer. This year, she was a doctor. She and Ken have
been in the army, taking part in Desert Storm; and in the 1960s, the great
days of Nasa, she was an astronaut.'
This year's Christmas model will talk and answer questions; one released
earlier swims and dives. Truly, she is a superwoman 'at the centre of her
world', as Icardo puts it. Perhaps, though, it takes another woman to spot a
few snags.
To me, it seems obvious that, as she approaches 40, Barbie faces the same
problems as the women who have tried to emulate her - success, fame, and
glamour do not necessarily bring fulfilment. And few of them have made her
supreme sacrifice. For Barbie - astronaut, soldier, fashion icon - has never
had sex. Forever dreaming of romantic weddings - dresses for which feature
among her sister's outfits, if not her own - her relationship remains
unconsummated.
Despite the sexual message of her appearance - huge breasts, heavy make-up,
ever more sophisticated clothes - Barbie must remain untouched. She is an
Eve who cannot fall, in a paradise filled not with flowers and fruit but
with products. The message she brings is to look, to dream - and then, to
buy.
La Poupee Barbie, Anniversaire a Monaco, continues at the Musee National de
Monaco, 17, Avenue Princesse Grace, Monte Carlo, until September 30. Barbie

FT  23 DEC 92 / Sindy to undergo facelift after angry legal spat with Barbie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINDY, once Britain's favourite doll, is to undergo plastic surgery to
settle a long-running international legal dispute with Barbie, her older and
more successful American rival.
Hasbro, manufacturer of Sindy, agreed yesterday to re-model her head to
distinguish her from Barbie, made by Mattel. The settlement was reached
shortly before a copyright battle between the two US companies was due to go
to the UK High Court next month.
The dispute began after Hasbro acquired the licence to Sindy from Pedigree,
the UK toy company, in 1986 and set about altering her appearance.
The previously demure tweed-clad Sindy suddenly acquired a more glamorous
face, while her body acquired shapely curves.
Mattel responded with a barrage of lawsuits, charging that Sindy had become
an imitation of Barbie.
Earlier this year, stocks of Sindy were seized after a French court ruled
that the doll violated Barbie's copyright. Mattel has also won cases against
Hasbro in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.
Barbie, who is sold in a variety of models and costumes, is believed to be
the most successful toy range of all time. Since she was launched 33 years
ago, more than 700m Barbie dolls have been sold in almost 70 countries, and
Mattel expects sales this year to be worth a record Dollars 1bn (Pounds
600m).
According to Mattel, a Barbie doll is sold every two seconds, and 98 per
cent of American girls between the ages of 3 and 11 own one at some point.
Sindy, born in 1961, has always sold mostly in Britain, where she had the
market to herself until the late 1970s. Today, her sales in Britain are
estimated to be three times greater than the roughly Pounds 8m achieved by
her rival.
Mattel said yesterday that it had agreed to drop all outstanding lawsuits
relating to Sindy and Barbie around the world and that the two companies
would pay their own legal costs.
Just how much difference Sindy's planned facelift will have on sales is
uncertain. According to Mr Barry Walker, deputy chairman of the British
Association of Toy Retailers: 'It's only crusty old blokes in toy showrooms
who care about these things. The kids don't notice.'

   LOS ANGELES -- Petra is no friend of Barbie's, says Barbie
doll maker Mattel Inc.
   Mattel charged Lundby of Sweden AB and its U.S. unit with
false advertising and unfair competition in connection with
Lundby's alleged promotion of its Petra doll in the U.S. as
"Barbie's friend."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Lundby "has shown the Petra advertisements to actual and
potential toy store purchasers for purposes of advertising
and inducing such purchasers to buy . . . {Lundby's} Petra
doll," Mattel stated in its suit filed Friday in U.S.
District Court here.
   Perry Melton, acting operations manager for Lundby of
Sweden USA Inc., the Tucson, Ariz., U.S. unit, said "it would
be premature to comment {on the Mattel suit} until I've seen
it."
   Los Angeles-based Mattel said the alleged promotion would
confuse potential consumers because Mattel itself has
marketed its Ken, Kira, Christie and other fashion dolls as
friends of the hugely popular Barbie. Mattel estimated its
U.S. sales of Barbie and related dolls and accessories at
more than $2.8 billion from 1972 through 1990.

In Barbie's Corner
As She Fights Jem

They Adore 27-Year-Old Doll
And Her Many Costumes;
The Barbie Hall of Fame

   Barbie fetishism among adults is on the rise. 

   Each year, more women and men attend a Barbie convention, where they sell and swap Barbie hatboxes, Barbie barbecue sets and Barbie McDonald's uniforms. 
A Barbie newsletter has nearly 3,000 subscribers. 
And in Palo Alto, Calif., Evelyn Burkhalter regularly conducts tours of her Barbie Hall of Fame. 

   "People are seeing that this is no longer a doll but a representation of our history," Ms. Burkhalter says. 
Adds Peggy Bowling, an Oklahoma City fan, "A lot of women see in Barbie what they would like to be." 

   All this moral support comes at a crucial period for 27-year-old Barbie. 
The Mattel Inc. star is facing serious competition from Jem and the Holograms, a flashy doll rock band made by Hasbro Inc. Jem's creators say she has the social conscience and executive abilities that Barbie lacks. 

   To battle this upstart, Barbie, a woman of many identities and even more costumes, has formed her own rock band, the Rockers. 
In the persona of Rocker Barbie, she is belting out new-wave music and wearing metallic clothes. 
Ken, her longtime beau, isn't a member of the band, touching off speculation that Barbie has dumped him for Derek, the band's hip guitar player. 

   Jem made her debut in February and now ranks No. 16 on the Toy Hit Parade, a monthly list of the industry's top sellers. 
Barbie, who didn't even make the Top 10 last December, rebounded this year to No. 2, trailing Hasbro's long-marching G.I. Joe and edging out Tonka Corp.'s Pound Puppies. 

   Still, Jem is an increasing threat. 
"This is the first time I can ever remember a doll who's climbed up so quickly on the charts," says Thomas X. Murn, the executive editor of Toy &amp; Hobby World magazine, which publishes them. 

   Stephen Schwartz, Hasbro's senior vice president of marketing, offers an explanation for Jem's appeal. 
"Jem is a woman with a purpose. 
She's an executive," he says. 
"Barbie likes to shop. 
Barbie has no personality." 

   Hasbro is full of details about Jem's life: By day, she runs a music company, donating profits to a home for runaway girls. 
By night, with the help of battery-powered magic earrings, she turns into a rock star, dressed in a "shimmering pink lame ensemble" and backed up by the hot female trio of Shana, Kimber and Aja. 
Her boyfriend, Rio, who works as the stage manager, "provides the casual/chic image of TV's 'Miami Vice.'" 

   Jem -- and this is fact now, not fantasy -- has a cartoon show, with her own animated rock videos. 
"Kids are a lot more sophisticated today," a Hasbro spokeswoman says. 
Market research, she says, has found that children five years old and up closely follow rock videos on cable TV and are "absolutely fashion-conscious." 

   In retaliation, Mattel had planned to announce tomorrow the winner of a nationwide search for its first flesh-and-blood Barbie, a real live Rocker Barbie. 
About 500 aspiring rockers, including a seven-year-old tap dancer and a 70-year-old from Illinois, responded to ads seeking "beautiful Barbie look-alikes." 
An album, a concert tour and speaking engagements were planned. 
Alas, the company said yesterday that while the search will continue, none of the contestants so far had the true "Barbie essence." 

   Nevertheless, Rocker Barbie sales are expected to total about $75 million this holiday season, making Barbie Mattel's biggest seller. 
Mattel says Rocker Barbie was the perfect persona to bring the doll to life. 
Last year, she was a computer-literate businesswoman. 
"It was good for Barbie but pretty unexciting," says Candace Irving, a Mattel spokeswoman. 

   Ms. Irving says Barbie is "less flamboyant than Jem," and while it isn't "in her makeup to be tied to any particular cause," Barbie "would be socially responsible, if pressed." 
Ms. Irving, incidentally, denies rumors of romantic friction since Barbie's rock career took off. 
"People acted like it was as big as the Chernobyl meltdown when they thought Barbie dumped Ken," she says, but she insists that "Barbie and Derek are just good friends." 

   Hard-core Barbie fans dismiss Jem as a fad. 
"She's ugly," says Ruth Cronk of New York, the president of the International Barbie Doll Collectors Club. 
"No matter what they come out with, it won't beat Barbie. 
Even Brooke Shields couldn't make a dent." 
Mrs. Cronk's club has grown from 29 members to 3,000 in the past decade. 

   Members get a newsletter, which features patterns for Barbie clothes ("you can make Barbie look like everything from Bo-Peep to pregnant," Mrs. Cronk says), a study of Barbie's family tree and an article about Barbie's pets. 

   Fans enjoy the camaraderie. 
"I thought I was the only person past the age of 13 who appreciated Barbie," says Sibyl DeWein, of Clarksville, Tenn. 
After hooking up with other Barbie fanatics, she says, "I found out I wasn't as smart as I thought I was. 
Until 1972 I didn't even know there was a Spanish-speaking Ken." 

   Mrs. DeWein, who co-wrote a 305-page Barbie encyclopedia, says, "There's no real way to explain the Barbie mystique." 
But Prof. Robin Lakoff, a board member of the women's-studies department at the University of California at Berkeley, ventures an explanation. 

   "You have to look at the reasons why people consider Barbie a desirable feminine image," Prof. Lakoff says, "and that's a rather dangerous thing." 
Barbie, she says, implies that "the role of an ideal woman is essentially to look pretty; she encourages the superficial, the idea that clothing is all." 
The Barbie image, says the professor, is "the airhead who consumes." 

   Prof. Lakoff, who never had a Barbie, suggests a reason for adult women's attraction to the doll. 
"People like to hang on to the security of childhood," she says. 
"As a child, {Barbie} gave them an image of what it was to be a woman. 
When they grow up, they realize it's a lot harder." 

   The next Barbie convention, in June, has the theme "In Oklahoma, Every Day is Christmas with Barbie." 
Mrs. Bowling of Oklahoma City, who is the coordinator, is keeping plans secret, but past conventions included workshops on how to wash Barbie's hair and how to care for Barbie's clothes (ironing isn't recommended). 

   Mrs. Bowling says an increasing number of men attend Barbie conventions. 
One male hairdresser recently wrote of his "all-consuming passion" for Barbie in the Barbie newsletter. 
Michael McDonnell, who has concentrated on Ken collecting since 1971, also says more men are becoming interested in the dolls. 
Mr. McDonnell, an Internal Revenue Service worker from California, has searched for a particular Ken briefcase for 16 years. 
"I can't express how difficult it is to find these things," he says. 
"But I love the thrill of the hunt." 

   Good will usually flourishes among groupies, but Mrs. Bowling admits, "There are power struggles. 
A few people like to think they are the Barbie authority." 

   Mrs. Bowling, who once made herself five exact woman-sized copies of Barbie outfits (it took four months to hand-paint the fabric of one of them), says attention to detail is crucial in collecting Barbie memorabilia. 
"There are some real elusive accessories," she says. 
"There's a thermos with a lid that comes off, and Ken's pants even had a real zipper an inch long." 

   The search for such treasures evidently requires concentration. 
"You have to keep your mind functioning on it daily," Mrs. Bowling says. 
"If you don't study on a regular basis, you forget what you need." 

   The Barbie Hall of Fame, in the back of Mrs. Burkhalter's doll shop in Palo Alto, is the perfect place to study. 
Over 14,000 items sit in glass cases. 
There are black Barbies, Hispanic Barbies, Ken-A-Go-Go, who comes with wigs, and Growing Up Skipper, who races through puberty when her arms are raised. (Skipper is Barbie's younger sister.) 

   Mrs. Burkhalter dismisses a large-lipped Kissing Barbie, calling it as "homely as sin" (which is just as well, since no puckering partner was ever made). 
Also on display are a Barbie-sized Vic Damone album, a pink Barbie commode, and Barbies dressed as Marilyn Monroe, Phyllis Diller and Pat Nixon. 

   A highlight is an original 1959 Barbie, wearing a zebra bathing suit, cat-eye sunglasses and hoop earrings. 
The Hall of Fame doesn't sell its treasures, but there is a market for such items. 
First-run 1959 brunettes, in "mint, in-the-box" condition, go for up to $1,750. 

   Blondes, they say, are slightly cheaper.

   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Mattel Inc. wants Barbie, the
ultimate material girl, to strike it rich in Japan.
   After earlier, limited flings that were specifically
tailored for the Japanese market, the company has decided to
sell its toys there much as it sells them in the rest of the
world -- and to sell the same ones rather than specially
designed versions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mattel will unveil today a multimillion-dollar marketing
campaign to capture a chunk of one of the most promising but
formidable of all toy markets. Japan's toy manufacturer
shipments totaled about $3.6 billion last year, second only
to the U.S.'s $11.9 billion.
   Mattel, along with other U.S. toy makers, has had little
impact in Japan so far because of trade restrictions and
other barriers. Now, with change sweeping the Japanese retail
scene, it hopes to cash in on the affluence of Japanese
consumers.
   Japan has 16 million children in the company's target
group of boys and girls up to 10 years old, says Lindsey
Williams, Mattel International's president. By the end of the
decade, he says, Japan should be one of Mattel's top three
markets overseas.
   In today's announcement, Mattel will disclose the
formation of Mattel KK, a marketing subsidiary for Japan, and
the appointment of Dodwell as its marketing partner. Dodwell,
a subsidiary of Inchcape PLC, based in Britain, specializes
in packaged goods and has made extensive inroads in the
Japanese distribution system. The company will also appoint
McCann-Erickson Hakuhodo as its advertising agency.
   Nonetheless, Mattel will face some big hurdles.
Mom-and-pop stores still dominate Japan's tradition-bound
retail system, and retail outlets are linked to a cumbersome
wholesaler distribution network. In addition, while Japanese
consumers can be quite receptive to brand-name American
products, U.S. companies often stumble because of peripheral
issues.
   "Packaging is particularly important in Japan," says Ira
Bachrach, president of NameLab Inc., which has helped
position products there. "You can't depend on advertising
alone; it doesn't have the same direct, immediate impact that
it does here."
   Besides Barbie, the toy maker has high hopes that it will
eventually find a market in Japan for its other basic lines,
such as Hot Wheels die-cast cars and large dolls. Licensing
rights in Japan for Mattel's Walt Disney Co. infant and
preschool toys are being negotiated.
   But a sexier Barbie is leading the charge. Barbie's ties
to Japan date to 1958, when Mattel began manufacturing the
dolls there. And more than a decade ago, Mattel introduced
Barbie to Japanese consumers through a limited joint venture
with Bandai Co.
   But Mattel changed the look of its doll after Japanese
advisers insisted that a bosomy clotheshorse wouldn't appeal
to Japanese girls. As a result, she has sported the dark,
doe-eyed look of an ingenue and a decidedly flatter chest
than the voluptuous blue-eyed model sold everywhere else. Her
limbs also don't bend enough to allow her to hop casually
into a Barbie-sized Ferrari or climb the steps to a
Barbie-sized mansion, lucrative accessories that haven't been
widely available in Japan anyway.
   While market research did indicate that Japanese girls
preferred what they had been conditioned to accept, Mr.
Williams says that in hindsight, Mattel would have profited
from sticking to what works everywhere else. "This enormous
`World of Barbie' that we sell is one of fantasy and
aspiration," Mr. Williams says. "In Japan, we were never able
to develop the concept, because there were never any props."
   There was another problem that Mattel was slow to catch.
Girls in most countries lug shoeboxes stuffed with Barbie
regalia to friends' houses to play. But many Japanese girls
thought the doll belonged on display, like traditional
decorative Japanese dolls. That meant few additional dress
sales.
   Mattel is adopting another American-style twist: Pitch
directly to Junior, not Mom and Dad. United Nations
statistics show that the total discretionary income of
Japanese households now tops that of U.S. households. But
Mattel was operating "under the assumption that the Japanese
mother was a very stern gatekeeper," Mr. Williams says. "Our
recent research shows that the Japanese mother says she'll
buy whatever her girl asks for."
   Mattel will start selling directly to retail outlets,
essentially bypassing the wholesalers who have traditionally
had a lock on toy distribution. Mr. Williams says Dodwell can
help Mattel link up with a network of 1,400 mass merchandise
"superstores." The company also wants to tap into
increasingly popular Western-style shopping malls and into
department stores that attract shoppers interested in such
baubles as limited edition porcelain Barbies.
   Toys "R" Us, the giant U.S. toy discounter with strong
ties to Mattel, is also playing a useful role. Its
preparations to enter the Japanese market are shaking up the
retail end of the business, forcing wholesalers and retailers
to rethink their approaches, Mr. Williams says.
   Mattel thinks it can increase total annual fashion-doll
sales in Japan to between $125 million and $150 million in
three to five years. For the last few years, the fashion-doll
market has been relatively flat at less than $80 million. The
market for all Mattel products in Japan could hit $200
million in gross sales in seven to 10 years, Mr. Williams
says.
   The company is counting on overseas markets for much of
its growth over the next several years. International sales
jumped 36% last year to $750 million, compared with an
overall sales increase of 19%. Total sales were $1.47
billion.
   "We're not betting the company on this, but we're willing
to make a significant investment," Mr. Williams says of
Japan. And after three decades on the periphery, he adds with
a slight smile, "we've learned patience."

STRONG SALES SEND MATTEL PROFIT SOARING 73%

Mattel Inc., the maker of Barbie dolls and other toys, said Thursday that 
strong sales in its three major product lines drove its third-quarter earnings 
up 73% to $38 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawthorne-based company said sales for the three months ending Sept. 30 
totaled $410 million, a 34% increase from the same quarter a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Mattel said its long-established Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels racing cars led 
its sales and earnings growth. Mattel was also bolstered by the sale of its 
Disney character line of toys for infants and preschoolers, said John Amerman, 
chairman and chief executive. Amerman said Mattel has focused much of its 
marketing efforts on those three toy lines. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes the volatility out of business when the top sellers do well," Amerman 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
The Disney line, introduced by Mattel in 1988, has been a boon for the company, 
said Barry Rothberg, an analyst at New York-based Mabon, Nugent &amp; Co. 
Disney sales totaled about $55 million in 1988 and should climb to $125 million 
this year, Rothberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"Before introducing Disney, they did not have a real presence in the preschool 
market," Rothberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Rothberg said Mattel is also benefiting from an industrywide resurgence in the 
toy market. For example, Hasbro Inc. -- another leading toy maker -- on 
Thursday reported a 73.1% increase in third-quarter earnings, Rothberg noted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fairly healthy industry now," Rothberg said. "Until recently, the 
industry was losing ground to Nintendo and other video games." 
</P>
<P>
However, Rothberg said much of Mattel's third-quarter earnings stems from sales 
to retailers that are stocking up for the upcoming holiday shopping period. 
</P>
<P>
"The third quarter bodes well for the company," he said. "But the real test 
comes in the fourth quarter; that's when we find out how well consumers like 
the products."

NEWCOMER TAKES AIM AT BARBIE'S MEASUREMENTS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     For the past two years, Cathy Meredig has worked to fashion a politically
correct doll whose measurements aren't worthy of the Guinness Book of World
Records. And "Happy To Be Me" was finally unveiled this week.;    "If you look
at Barbie you'll see that her waist is half her chest. And that chest!" said
Brian Leininger, Meredig's husband and partner in their Minnesota company,
High Self-Esteem Toys. "Her eyes take up half her face. She looks like she's
going through life in a daze.";    Leininger said the "Happy To Be Me" doll
has much more realistic proportions. If Barbie had a 36-inch bust she would be
36-18-33, but Happy's less optimistic measurements would be 36-27-38.;   
"Cathy got upset by the message Barbie was sending to kids. Many girls are
very unhappy with their body image," Leininger said. "The fashion industry has
been sending girls a fairy tale but an unhealthy fairy tale. We're saying
you're terrific the way you are.";    Barbie loyalists are dismissing Happy as
just another flash in the pan without the right stuff to knock the Mattel
queen off her throne.;    "Barbie is like a dress model. Everyone knows that
when you have a dress form you adjust it," said Evelyn Burkhalter, founder of
the Barbie Hall of Fame in Palo Alto. "If you talk to any little girl, I bet
there isn't one who would complain about how Barbie's bust measurements relate
to her feet.;    "Barbie has followed fashion; this doll is trying to propose
it," Burkhalter said. "It won't work."  </TEXT>

   A Ken doll dressed in Barbie's clothing
wasn't a manufacturing mistake after all. It was a stock clerk's
prank.
   A clerk at a Toys R Us store acknowledged Tuesday he redressed
the doll one night while goofing off. The store fired him when he
confessed.
   ``We always did crazy things like that,'' Ron Zero said of the
antics of the store's late-night stockers. ``We'd hang dolls in the
aisle or put Ken and Barbie in the Barbie house with Barbie
spanking Ken.''
   Carina Guillot bought the Ken doll in the Tampa store last month
while visiting from New Jersey. It was dressed in a purple tank top
and a lace-covered purple and turquoise skirt.
   The doll quickly became a national spectacle _ spoofed by
Arsenio Hall, featured on ``The Joan Rivers Show'' and in Newsweek
and Fortune magazines.
   ``Oh well, it generated a lot of excitement for a while,'' Mrs.
Guillot said.
   The director of the store said he was embarrassed and Mattel,
the doll's maker, said it was vindicated.
   The store clerk said he dressed not one but three Ken dolls in
women's clothes. He resealed the boxes with clear glue.
   He said he doesn't know what happened to the first one, and
store managers have the third one. Store managers say that's not
true.
   Zero said he laughed when he saw news stories about the doll.
   ``It was a kid clowning around,'' said store director Greg
Warren. ``We had one fellow with quite a sense of humor.''
   Warren said Zero was fired for tampering with the Ken dolls and
several other toys.

<LEADPARA>  JACK RYAN, credited with the creation of the Barbie doll, died last week at
age 65. Mr. Ryan was a rather fascinating man. In addition to the doll, he
designed around 35 of the country's best-selling toys, including the Chatty
Cathy talking doll, Hot Wheels and many electronic toys. While working for
Raytheon, Ryan developed the Sparrow and Hawk missiles. On top of all that, he
was married to Zsa Zsa Gabor.;   Still, Ryan was best known for his Barbie
doll, a model of babefection. And so we called Evelyn Burkhalter, founder and
curator of the Barbie Hall of Fame in Palo Alto, to see if there was any kind
of special event planned to commemorate the death of Barbie's "father."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Burkhalter said she had no such plans. For one thing, the name Ryan didn't
come up in her Barbie research. Burkhalter said Barbie was a copycat of the
Lilli doll from Germany, Americanized by Ruth and Elliott Handler, two of the
three original owners of Mattel. The Handlers had a daughter named Barbie, and
a son named . . . Ken.;   Ryan may have worked for the Handlers on the Barbie
design team, Burkhalter conceded.;   Ryan may have had a hand in the Barbie
Fashion Queen, introduced around 1963. The doll had a molded head and had
three wigs. Burkhalter noted that Ryan was wedded to Zsa Zsa, who along with
sister Eva are known as wig aficionados. "I guess that's why he came up with
the idea," she said.;   Meanwhile, the Barbie museum is now 16,000 strong, or
"99.8 percent complete," as Burkhalter put it. It's at 460 Waverley St. if
you'd like to check it out.; COLLEGE-BOUND: Some community activists in East
Palo Alto are holding a celebration to send some of the city's youth off to

Alto go on to college, only 30 percent to 40 percent of the youths in East
Palo Alto graduate from high school. The percentage of those who go on to
college is even smaller.;   The United Mothers Against Drugs, an East Palo
Alto activist group, is trying to encourage more students to continue their
education. So on Friday, members of the group and other residents and
politicos will gather in the council chamber to present scholarships to 10
seniors. The prizes are not much -- about $100 each in books and pens and such
-- but they represent a big achievement for the kids in this mostly poor
community.  </TEXT>

MATTEL EXPECTS BARBIE TO BOOST '89 PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Barbie, Mattel Inc.'s 30-year-old teen-ager, is expected to lead the Hawthorne 
toy maker to improved profits this year, the company said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
John W. Amerman, chairman and chief executive, said at the company's annual 
meeting in Manhattan Beach that he expects sales of the best-selling doll to 
increase by $45 million to about $500 million this year. Each year, Barbie 
accounts for one-third to one-half of Mattel's $1 billion of sales. 
</P>
<P>
Amerman said he expected significant sales gains from the company's line of 
Disney preschool toys, which brought in about $55 million in 1988, its 
introductory year. Amerman predicted a double-digit sales gain for the line. He 
said the company had "barely tapped" the international market, which accounted 
for $10 million to $20 million in Disney preschool toy sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
The company's second-quarter sales should "substantially exceed" the $207 
million reported for the same quarter in 1988, Amerman said. He said Mattel's 
earnings would exceed last year's results, but he declined to make predictions. 
</P>
<P>
Amerman said Mattel was unable to fill demand for some of its products during 
late 1988 and the first quarter of 1989 but that it was closing the gap. An 
inability to meet demand could result in Mattel losing potential sales. 
</P>
<P>
The company expects great things from its new "Power Glove," an electronic 
glove that allows children to play Nintendo video games just by waving their 
hands, Amerman said. The popular video game system is normally operated with a 
"joy stick" that is attached to the game console by a wire. 
</P>
<P>
The Power Glove, which is expected to retail for more than $60, is Mattel's 
only electronic toy offering this year. The company discontinued its highly 
touted electronic "Wheel of Fortune," which allowed at-home viewers to play 
along with the television game show, due to disappointing sales. 
</P>
<P>
Mattel -- which has also discontinued Baby Heather, its electronic baby doll -- 
hasn't changed its philosophy toward electronic toys, Amerman said. The success 
of electronic toys, he observed, depends on the "right timing." 
</P>
<P>
Amerman said Mattel is continuing a two-year project to develop an interactive 
compact disc player that would project movies and allow viewers to change the 
action. Competing toy companies, notably Hasbro Inc., have dropped their 
interactive video projects, declaring such toys too expensive to develop and to 
buy.

<HEAD>Hasbro Earnings Down; Mattel Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Hasbro Inc. on Thursday reported a 52 percent drop in
second-quarter earnings because of costs from a dicontinued toy
while Mattel Inc. said its profits rose 22 percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Hasbro</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Hasbro, based in Pawtucket, R.I., said it earned $8.7 million,
or 15 cents per share, from April to June. That compared with $18.2
million, or 31 cents per share, during the same 1989 period.
   Revenue fell 7.8 percent to $277.3 million from $301.4 million.
   Hasrbo chief financial officer John T. O'Neill said costs
associated with the dropped racing car toy Record Breakers hurt
earnings. The company also blamed the poor performance on slow
domestic sales.
   For the first six months of 1990, earnings fell 23.6 percent to
$28.2 million, or 48 cents per share, from $36.9 million, or 63
cents per share.
   Half-year revenue was $578.4 million, down from $589.7 million
last year.
   Hasbro is counting on a third-quarter rebound from the
introduction of dolls based on the pop music group New Kids on the
Block and on performers affiliated with the World Wrestling
Federation.

<HEAD>Mattel</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Hawthorne, Calif.-based Mattel profits rose on strong
international sales of such products as Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels
toys.
   Mattel said it earned $20.3 million, or 40 cents per share, in
the second quarter, up from $16.6 million, or 33 cents a share,
last year. Sales rose 17 percent to $318 million from $272 million.
   In the first half of 1990, earnings gained 37 percent to $28.7
million, or 57 cents per share, on sales of $552 million. That
compared with 1989 first-half earnings of $20.9 million, or 42
cents per share, on $468 million in sales.
   The company benefited from increased sales of such core products
as Barbie, Hot Wheels, Disney Preschool and Infant Toys, He-Man,
large dolls and See'N Say, said John W. Amerman, chairman and chief
executive.

Go West -- to Michigan? 
</P>
<P>
There goes our plastics industry. 
</P>
<P>
Action West, a coalition of 15 counties in southwestern Michigan, has launched 
business development ads that debase the stereotyped California lifestyle in 
favor of another west coast lifestyle -- the west coast of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
The ads, running in trade publications such as Modern Plastics and Food 
Engineering, tout southwestern Michigan as "America's Other West Coast."They 
are aimed at luring businesses to their corner of the Great Lakes State. 
</P>
<P>
One ad is headlined "Imagine a West Coast without all those condos, kooks and 
quakes." Another says, "Imagine a West Coast where plastic is more than just an 
attitude." It is aimed at attracting plastics manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
John Sebestyen, executive vice president of Johnson &amp; Dean, the Grand 
Rapids agency behind the ads, says it's "all done in good fun." 
</P>
<P>
"We're not even selling against California," Sebestyen contends. Still, he 
admits, he got a call from a Detroit woman who wanted to know "why we're 
picking on California. I told her, 'I really don't think they're losing a lot 
of sleep over this.' "

2 Barbies for a Mickey Mantle? 
</P>
<P>
Trading cards, once the domain of baseball-crazy boys, are now available to 
girls who love Barbie dolls. Mattel is jumping into the $350-million-a-year 
trading card market in a big way, offering packs of 10 oversized Barbie trading 
cards for $1 and a coordinating poster for $3. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 300 different cards, each with Barbie in a fashionable 
outfit, beginning with her shapely debut in a 1959 striped, one-piece swimsuit. 
"We elected not to add the pink bubble gum, although it would be a natural," 
said Meryl Friedman, vice president of marketing and product development for 
Barbie's lifestyle group. 
</P>
<P>
Mattel predicts that the cards will appeal to mothers and daughters who, for 
three decades, have picked up fashion tips by dressing their Barbie dolls for 
dates with Ken. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latest Dirt on Rodeo Drive 
</P>
<P>
Rodeo Drive has new gardeners, but the change has nothing to do with how well 
the landscaping has looked on the glitzy street. 
</P>
<P>
The switch stemmed from a turn in an ongoing legal battle launched in 1984 by 
the Rodeo Drive Committee, a group of 80 merchants and property owners. To 
protect the Rodeo image, the committee sued an apparel firm that unveiled a 
Rodeo Drive line, accusing it of trademark infringement. 
</P>
<P>
California Guys N Gals, the apparel firm, countersued and won $180,000 in legal 
fees. The firm then tried to recover some of the money by filing a claim 
against a $40,000 contract under which Beverly Hills was paying the Rodeo 
committee to maintain the street's median. The committee responded by canceling 
the contract and asking the city to do the gardening itself. 
</P>
<P>
So how does Rodeo's landscaping look? 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a dirt strip, with dead weeds in it," said Richard Weaver of 
California Guys N Gals. Joan Luther of the Rodeo Drive Committee retorted: "The 
median strip is as bright and beautiful as ever."

MATTEL'S 1989 PROFIT ALMOST DOUBLES; 4TH QUARTER SLIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Barbie, He-Man and Hot Wheels racing cars led giant toy maker Mattel Inc. to 
income of almost $70 million in 1989, although a one-time charge of $11 million 
cut into the fourth quarter, Mattel's chairman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawthorne-based company reported 1989 earnings of $68.7 million, almost 
double the $35.9 million reported in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
However, the $9.7 million in earnings during the fourth quarter dropped from 
$10.5 million reported in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Mattel called for redemption of a subordinated debt, which 
resulted in a one-time charge of $11 million to 1989 earnings. The redemption 
will result in annual interest savings in 1990 of $8.8 million, said Johm W. 
Amerman, Mattel's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Amerman said the company's long-established products, its presence in the 
international market and its manufacturing networks contributed to increased 
sales for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Amerman said its 30-year-old legend, Barbie doll, and He-Man, Hot Wheels racing 
cars, Disney toys and Li'l Miss Dolls "are our core business products that 
endure over the years."

   Peek into Santa's workshop today, and you glimpse the
ghosts of Christmas past.
   "Barbie dolls, Monopoly games and Lego blocks will be
piled high under the Christmas tree this year," predicts Paul
Valentine, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.'s toy analyst. "They were
big a generation ago. They are selling well today."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   They are also relatively cheap, which explains why they
are holding their own in these tough economic times. But how
many newer toys and games, including video-game
introductions, will join them under the tree is a matter of
debate. Many toy retailers report store traffic in recent
weeks is down. "The question is, will it pick up and by how
much?" wonders Stephen Sandberg, co-owner of Sanco Toys Inc.,
a toy wholesaler in Foxboro, Mass., whose orders from
retailers haven't been as heavy as in past years. He adds:
"People are saying let's see how can we just get through this
holiday season, keeping damage to a minimum."
   Consider the shopping list of Anita Eichmann, a Boston
school teacher, browsing in a suburban Child World store one
recent weekend. Ms. Eichmann, who two years ago bought a
Nintendo video-game system, this year has picked up a packet
of Roger Clemens baseball cards, a Red Baron model-biplane
kit and a Young Readers Dictionary for her nine-year-old boy.
Her six-year-old girl will get a coloring book, a Barbie doll
and a doll house.
   "Times are tough," says Ms. Eichmann. "Nobody knows which
way the economy is going. As for buying myself a present,
maybe next year."
   Judging by what's selling so far this year, other parents
have similarly modest lists that harken back to the times
when they were growing up. The Erector set, that bygone play
set made by the French firm Meccano S.A., is making a
comeback. This year, the company estimates it will sell
nearly 200,000 units in the U.S., up from "only a few
thousand" last year, reports Stephane Treppoz, vice president
of Meccano Inc., the company's U.S. unit.
   "I don't think all of a sudden in America parents want
their children to become engineers," he explains. "I think
they are looking for basic things. They want something that
will keep their child occupied for a long period of time."
   Topps Co., which claims more than one-third of the $1
billion trading-card business, projects that its
baseball-card business will grow 12% this year and 25% next
year. Another booming business is that of Lego. U.S. sales of
the Danish-made plastic building blocks will climb 25% this
year, estimates Peter Eio, president of Lego Systems Inc.,
the U.S. unit of closely held Lego Group.
   Toys with familiar names sell well in a recession, Mr. Eio
notes. "In this economic climate, retailers prefer not to
take a lot of risks," he explains.
   A newer "old" favorite, Cabbage Patch dolls, also is
selling well. The revamped doll line, acquired by Hasbro Inc.
from now defunct Coleco Industries Inc. in 1989 is expected
to ring up sales of $100 million this year. Though well below
peak sales of $600 million in 1985 at the peak of the Cabbage
Patch craze, sales should be up slightly from last year but
nearly twice that of 1989, thanks to new versions of the doll
such as Crimp and Curl, which comes with a curling iron.
   Analysts say that another new Hasbro introduction, Yo-Yo,
a furry kitten that rolls on wheels, is also selling well and
could hit $50 million in sales this year.
   Another doll on the best-selling charts is Tyco Toys
Inc.'s new Little Mermaid, fashioned after the Disney
character. Projected sales of the toy are $50 million this
year.
   Mattel Inc. should do a tidy $50 million with its Li'l
Miss Singing Mermaid doll and another $50 million from its
Magic Nursery doll, now in its second year. Meanwhile,
Mattel's 32-year-old Barbie remains the reigning queen of the
toy industry. This year, sales of Barbie dolls, clothing,
toiletries and playhouses are expected to reach $800 million,
an 8% increase over last year.
   Other hits include: Hasbro's Nerf Bow and Arrow; Playmate
Toys Ltd.'s Water Babies, which feel like real babies when
filled with warm water; Tyco's Magic Copier, which makes a
copy of pictures drawn on an erasable screen; and Cosie Coop,
a toy car for preschoolers by Rubbermaid Inc.'s Little Tikes
unit.
   Also on the "what's hot" list of Toy Book, an industry
publication, to be published next month is Uno, the card game
by International Games Inc., and model kits by Revell Inc.
   For boys, Playmate Toys' Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,
though past their prime, will claim better than 50% of the $1
billion retail "action figure" market in the U.S. A new entry
in the action-figure category that looks promising for boys,
retailers say, is Mattel's Hook, a line based on a bunch of
Peter Pan characters from Steven Spielberg's "Hook," to be
released next month. Because of the Hook line's late
introduction, however, it is difficult to estimate holiday
sales, a Mattel spokeswoman says.
   Many of the traditional and less-expensive toys are being
helped by the fact that video games have cooled off somewhat.
   Nintendo Co.'s new Super Nintendo system, more powerful
than its original game player, hasn't taken the market by
storm, retailers say. In part that is because, at $200, the
system is pricey at a time when lots of families are pinching
pennies and because rival Sega Enterprises Ltd.'s advanced
Genesis video game, had an 18-month head start in the market.
   "I think there's broad agreement that Super Nintendo is
underperforming and Genesis is overperforming, though it
doesn't sound a death knell for Nintendo," says John Taylor,
toy analyst for L.H. Alton &amp; Co.
   Sega expects to sell 1.6 million Genesis systems this
year, below Nintendo's anticipated sales but better than
expected. Nintendo says it plans to ship 2.5 million Super
Nintendo systems this year and is confident consumers will
buy up at least 2.2 million systems by Christmas. "We're
happy with our current rates of sales," a company spokesman
says.
   Surprisingly though, as sales of Nintendo's older and
less-powerful system is losing zip, a device made by Lewis
Galoob Toys Inc. that simplifies Nintendo games is having a
sales surge. The $50 gadget, Game Genie, was kept off the
market until this fall by legal challenges from Nintendo.
Galoob expects to ship one million units into stores by
Christmas.
   Many of the toys introduced with great fanfare last
February at Toy Fair, the industry's new-product show, have
flopped. Among the disappointments: Mattel's Attack of the
Killer Tomatoes, a line of bug-eyed creatures based on the
Fox Children's Network show; Hasbro's Bucky O'Hare, an
intergalactic rabbit; and Galoob's Harry and the Hendersons
action figures, based on TV characters. While "Robin Hood,"
the movie, was a hit with some parents, Robin Hood toys based
on the movie and made by Hasbro's Tonka unit weren't. The toy
characters "just did OK," says Mr. Taylor of L.H. Alton. The
release of the Robin Hood home video may not help, either.
Rentals and video sales of "Robin Hood" haven't been brisk,
says a spokesman for Fairfield Research, which follows the
home-video business.
   Other licensed toys have done modestly at best, including
Playmate's Garfield the Cat. Playmate is also shipping
Tailspin, based on a Disney cartoon character, to stores but
isn't sure how much to produce.
   Galoob's Suzy Snapshot, a doll that moved to the flash of
a camera, was a flash in pan in the U.S., though overseas
sales aren't bad, analysts say. Sales of Playmate's Toxic
Crusaders, another TV-show-based line of action figures, have
been disappointing, despite some speculation that the toy
could be the next Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. As a result,
the line will be dumped next year.
   "With a few exceptions, I'm reading the market as soft,"
says Richard Sallis, Playmate's senior vice president. "Toys
are not as recession-proof as some people thought they were.
Retailers will be looking for ways to bring consumers into
the stores this Christmas."

FT  28 AUG 93 / International Company News: Mattel challenges for top toy
spot - Karen Zagor on benefits of the US group's merger with Fisher-Price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE merger with Fisher-Price will transform Mattel, the number two US
toy-maker, into a worthy rival to industry leader Hasbro, swelling Mattel's
market share from 11 per cent to 15 per cent, just short of Hasbro's 16 per
cent share.
The next biggest company is Tyco, accounting for 5 per cent of the market,
according to Mr Gary Jacobson, analyst at Kidder Peabody. 'I think we will
continue to see smaller acquisitions,' says Mr Jacobson, 'but there is
nothing left of this magnitude.' Tyco, which posted losses for the first
half of this year, is considered too troubled to be attractive to Mattel or
Hasbro.
Mattel, once an unstable performer in an industry noted for its volatility,
has posted steady gains in sales and earnings since 1990. The company owes
much of its strength to the success of core brands, notably the Barbie doll,
Mattel's 34-year old fashion doll which last year accounted for around 50
per cent of sales.
The company, which last posted a loss of Dollars 113.2m in 1987, has found
stability by discarding non-toy assets, cutting overheads and personnel and
focusing on core products at the expense of more faddish toys. Last year, it
earned Dollars 143.8m, up from Dollars 117.2m in 1991 and Dollars 95.5m
1990. But some analysts say Mattel is too reliant on the Barbie doll.
The Fisher-Price deal will ease some of these concerns, reducing Barbie's
share of sales to just under 39 per cent for the combined company with
Fisher-Price contributing an additional 30 per cent of sales. Mattel's other
mainstay lines - Disney-based pre-school toys and the Hot Wheels car line -
will account for 10 per cent and 5 per cent of company sales respectively.
Fisher-Price, which is the dominant player in the infant and pre-school end
of the business, will help bolster Mattel's toy lines in this area. This is
particularly important because Mattel's Disney infant/preschool line has
been one of its weaker areas.
Mattel hopes to broaden Fisher-Price's overseas sales with the help of its
own distribution channels - about half of Mattel's sales are outside the US,
compared with 25 per cent for Fisher-Price.
'We also see opportunities with regards to manufacturing facilities,' says
Mattel. 'We have looked at two Fisher-Price plants in the US and think we
can put some Mattel products, currently produced by vendors, into these
plants.'
Fisher-Price, with a product range including Chatter Telephone, Play Desk
and a wide range of playsets, has been seen as a likely takeover candidate
since 1991, when it was spun off from Quaker Oats.
It earned Dollars 41.3m last year, up from Dollars 14.6m in 1991, but some
toy analysts have long felt that Fisher-Price needed big player muscle to
remain wholly competitive. Mattel, which had approached Fisher-Price at the
time of the spin-off, was the obvious suitor.
'The deal makes sense for both parties,' says Mr Harold Vogel, of Merrill
Lynch. 'Mattel had a need for it and Fisher-Price seemed to have difficulty
competing in a long-term sense against the big toy manufacturers. This gives
Mattel a little bit more balance. Whether it actually accelerates earnings
growth is another story.'
Balance is less of a concern for Hasbro, the world's biggest toy company.
Hasbro's greatest strength is the diversity of its products: it made 1992
profits of Dollars 179.2m compared with underlying earnings of Dollars
122.7m the previous year, excluding restructuring charges related an
acquisition. Products range from a strong preschool Playskool line, GI Joe
action doll for boys and board games, including Monopoly and Trivial
Pursuit.
A bigger Mattel will put pressure on Hasbro to retain its number one spot in
the toy industry, but there is still ample room for both companies to grow.
The combined domestic market share for Mattel and Hasbro is about 30 per
cent, 'leaving a tremendous room for growth', says Mr Jacobson.
Hasbro may even benefit from a more equal rival in Mattel. Stronger Mattel
toys will draw more customers into toy stores and get more products on to
shelves. And increased profits stability will allow Mattel to take greater
risks with its products.
If Mattel and Hasbro continue to grow, they may be more threatening to the
smaller companies than to each other. 'It's going to be more difficult for
small players to survive,' warns Mr Jacobson. 'But there will be niche
categories because, as Mattel and Hasbro get bigger, they will not pay
attention to the smaller niches.'
Moody's Investors Service has placed Mattel's debt ratings under review for
possible upgrade, citing acceleration in Mattel's progress 'in diversifying
its product array from Barbie toys'. Moody's expects the merger to enhance
earnings predictability without increasing debt.

   HAWTHORNE, Calif. -- Even as the Berlin Wall crumbled,
officials of Mattel Inc. rushed in to size up the Eastern
European market. But they were faced with a problem: How to
introduce Western-quality and Western-priced toys to a market
used to playthings that were generally simple and drab, but
cheap?
   The solution: Friendship Barbie, a basic blond version of
Mattel's long-running star that will be sold at cost, about
$6, to introduce millions of consumers to the joys of
U.S.-style shopping.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And where Barbie leads, can Hot Wheels and Mickey Mouse
toys be far behind? Mattel, given up for dead six years ago,
has steadily fought its way back by eschewing volume for net
income, coming up with endless variations of its longtime
staples, and pushing internationalization almost as a
religion.
   As the toy industry consolidates and once-hot companies
vanish like spent hula hoops, Mattel has rebounded to become
one of the fastest-growing and most fashionable toy companies
on Wall Street.
   Recently, the company drove home the point by reinstating
its dividend, announcing plans to pare debt and landing
toy-licensing rights to News Corp.'s Fox Broadcasting Inc.'s
hit television cartoon show "The Simpsons."
   Moreover, Mattel's stock is riding high on the New York
Stock Exchange and investors and analysts are looking for the
company to outperform the toy industry. Yesterday, in Big
Board composite trading Mattel closed at $25.875, up 62.5
cents; the stock's 52-week high is $26.375.
   It was spindly-legged Barbie that helped haul Mattel back
to profitability, ringing up $590 million in world-wide sales
in 1989; the doll, along with other basic toy lines,
accounted for more than 75% of Mattel's consolidated sales.
Mattel posted net of $68.7 million on sales of $1.2 billion
in 1989.
   John W. Amerman, Mattel's chairman, president and chief
executive officer, and his handpicked executives hawk Barbie
and her associates as if the toys were chewing gum or
scouring powder. That comes naturally to Mr. Amerman, a
veteran of Colgate-Palmolive Co. and Warner Lambert Co. who
became Mattel's chairman in 1987 after heading its
international operations for seven years.
   "The toy business is a seat-of-the-pants business," says
Robert Sansone, who came in to head Mattel USA in 1987 after
24 years with General Foods Corp. "But most of what we're
doing here is from Marketing 101."
   Mattel crash-landed in 1983, shot down by years of
unbridled diversification, sloppy management and a disastrous
plunge into electronic toys. Under former chairman Arthur
Spear, the company bailed out of electronics and
entertainment, but not before posting a staggering $394
million loss for fiscal 1984. The company continued to drift,
even as a flood of competitors' blockbusters took the market
by storm.
   Mattel also has had its share of trendy hits. Its He-Man
and Masters of the Universe action figure and vehicle line,
built around a Saturday morning cartoon series the company
paid for, rocketed to $400 million in sales by 1985. But when
the show's costs edged upward and viewership drifted down,
Mattel didn't cut back supply, so the toys languished on
retailers' shelves and profits evaporated. "Inventory is a
killer in this business," Mr. Amerman says.
   Chastened, Mattel has trotted out new versions of its
muscle-bound heroes and villains again. But now, Mattel won't
foot the bill for a new cartoon series scheduled for the
fall, and inventory will be kept lean. Mr. Amerman says
He-Man's domestic sales this year may double to about $20
million.
   Mr. Amerman streamlined Mattel's management ranks but has
stepped up the company's spending on consumer research,
trying to balance basic marketing with the gut instincts that
toymakers traditionally used to identify promising products.
   The company, which alienated some retailers before the
management shakeout with a hunger for volume at almost any
cost, now has senior managers working directly with important
customers. Mr. Amerman oversees the team handling the K mart
Corp. account, while Mr. Sansone works with top management of
Toys `R' Us Inc.
   "They treat us as a partner, and that wasn't so much the
case years ago," says Michael Goldstein, vice chairman of
Toys `R' Us, adding: "They've made tremendous strides."
   That relationship may stand Mattel in good stead as it
expands overseas. Toys `R' Us's ambitious plan to build a
170-store international chain by the end of 1992 could give
Mattel an extra boost, particularly in cracking difficult
markets such as Japan.
   While Mattel is the largest and most profitable
international toymaker with more than $1 billion in
international sales last year, that doesn't prevent some
flops and missteps here and overseas.
   Barbie, for example, doesn't stack up to Hot Wheels in
India because of the male-dominated culture. And the Japanese
craze for superfast battery-driven cars didn't translate to
the U.S., partly because Mattel and others misread the hobby
as an at-home toy.
   Still, Mattel's overseas business is growing. Lindsey
Williams, president of Mattel International, says the Disney
line should get a boost with the 1992 opening of Euro
Disneyland, and Mattel's network of international offices is
burgeoning. New offices have opened in East Berlin and
Budapest, with another slated for Warsaw by year end.
   Mr. Williams says the overseas markets are less volatile
than the U.S., with products slower to peak and slower to
decline. With the overseas appetite for basic products such
as miniature cars, infant toys and large dolls, he says,
Mattel intends "not to waste precious resources introducing
fads."
   Mattel and other big toymakers may be better served by the
bread-and-butter approach, analysts agree. "The company may
be losing a little sex appeal by focusing on what it does
well," says John G. Taylor, an analyst with L.H. Alton &amp; Co.
"But they've traded that in for stability and profitability,
and the possibility of sleeping better at night."
   Mattel executives use the Simpsons licensing agreement to
argue that the company can retain some sizzle and yet limit
its risk. But because of Mattel's conservative bent, some
industry experts say, it seems less likely that the next
Cabbage Patch or Teddy Ruxpin will wear the Mattel logo.
   That seems to be a trade-off Mattel is willing to make.
"You really have to be careful with the mega-hits," Mr.
Amerman says. David Leibowitz, an analyst with American
Securities, agrees. "A blockbuster is such a rare phenomenon,
you just can't plan for it," he says.
   Mr. Amerman doesn't rule out acquisitions, and says the
company will consider anything from board games to ride-on
toys and other lines. The company recently bought Corgi Toys
Inc. of Swansea, Wales, a maker of miniature die cast cars,
to bolster its position in Europe and supplement its core Hot
Wheels brand.
   Mr. Amerman thinks his best seller can become
"billion-dollar Barbie" by 1995. And the Disney line may be
extended beyond infant and preschool toys. Eventually, "the
Disney brand may do in the range of what Barbie does," Mr.
Amerman says.
   If not, there's always show business. Mr. Amerman, Mr.
Sansone and Mr. Williams recently brought down the house in
the company cafeteria with a soft-shoe tribute to Mattel
employees for last year's results. The "Toy Boys," decked out
in tuxedoes, glittery top hats and bow ties, sang and danced
up a storm to "There's No Business Like Toy Business" and
other ditties. The finale? A bonus of two weeks' pay to the
unsuspecting employees; that brought a standing ovation.

   LOS ANGELES -- Mattel Inc. and Walt Disney Co. are out to
prove it really is a small world after all.
   The two companies, both of which target children as their
primary consumers, plan to forge close ties with a long-term
alliance that includes Mattel-sponsored attractions at Disney
theme parks, development of park-related toys, and expansion
of Disney's lucrative toy-licensing pacts with Mattel.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the agreement, the companies will sell Disney-Mattel
infant and preschool toys, and other Mattel toys, at special
retail locations in and around the Disney parks. The
companies also will sponsor joint promotions tied to the huge
tourist attractions.
   The announcement, pegged in part to next year's opening of
Euro Disneyland outside Paris, underscores the importance of
overseas business for both companies. Mattel-Disney toys will
be on the shelves and the Mattel name on an attraction when
Euro Disneyland's gates open in April.
   "More of Mattel's growth, like our own, will be coming
from the international market rather than the more mature
domestic market," said Frank G. Wells, Disney's president and
chief operating officer. "If you look at the projections, the
enormity of growth in Europe exceeds that of any other
geographic section of the world."
   For Mattel, the collaboration's Disney-related products
represent a powerhouse line that could someday rival its top
seller, Barbie. With projected world-wide sales of more than
$800 million this year, Barbie is expected to top $1 billion
within a few years.
   "The Disney-related products are the second cornerstone of
our company," said John W. Amerman, Mattel's chairman and
chief executive officer. "Will Disney get to the level of
Barbie in 10 years? I don't know, but Disney has tremendous
potential." The alliance is also important to Mattel's
overseas strategy; about half of the company's $1.47 billion
in 1990 sales came from abroad.
   The news pushed Mattel's stock up 37.5 cents a share to
$35.625 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Disney's stock fell 25 cents a share to $114.625.
   Disney has long been thought to be interested in
acquisitions. A Disney spokesman said the company doesn't
comment on speculation, but said there's no Mattel-related
statement planned beyond yesterday's announcement.
   Mattel first tapped into the Disney marketing magic in
1987, when it signed a five-year accord to make infant and
preschool toys. This year, Disney-Mattel toy sales will top
$200 million. That includes toys tied to movie re-releases
such as "101 Dalmatians" and "Cinderella," as well as the
infant and preschool lines. It will soon be augmented by
products drawing on Disney's new "Beauty and the Beast."
   The new agreement extends Mattel's existing toy licenses
for 10 years, and also allows for future licenses tied to new
or re-released properties.
   The deal vaults Mattel into the ranks of a select few
Disney partners -- including Coca-Cola Co., Delta Air Lines
and Eastman Kodak Co. -- that have exclusive and enormously
valuable ties with the entertainment giant. Through the
various agreements, Mattel is tying itself to a name that
connotes Americana, family and children's toys around the
world.
   At Disneyland in California and Walt Disney World in
Florida, Mattel will sponsor the popular "It's a Small World"
attractions, which use dolls to play off an international
theme and are scheduled to be refurbished. At Euro
Disneyland, Mattel will sponsor Autopia, a souped-up version
of the minicar rides popular at the domestic Disney parks.
The ride will be tied in with Mattel's Hot Wheels and Corgi
toy cars, though Mr. Amerman said that's a small aspect of
the overall sponsorship.
   Neither company would value the attraction sponsorship or
any other aspect of the alliance, but analysts estimate
sponsorship of a Disney park attraction has a value of $10
million to $15 million over several years. It's generally
considered a modest sum for the resulting high visibility
among the estimated 60 million people who visit the three
parks each year.
   Mr. Wells calls Euro Disneyland the linchpin for all
Disney products, from movies to television shows and all
types of consumer products. The Mattel alliance is part of
Disney's efforts to keep its merchandising efforts in high
gear. Analysts also say Disney is also cleaning up some
lower-quality Disney toy products that were licensed to other
companies several years ago, when the company was less
vigilant about maintaining its image as a top-quality
consumer brand.
   "This clearly puts Mattel in the pre-eminent position for
Disney-related products," said Harold Vogel, an analyst with
Merrill Lynch Research. He noted that a few valuable licenses
are still held by competitors, including Hasbro Inc.'s
license for plush dolls of Mickey Mouse and other characters.
   Of the toys to be sold at the parks, most are expected to
have some sort of Disney tie-in, Mr. Amerman said, citing as
one possible example a Barbie in Disney characters' garb. Mr.
Wells declined to give specific figures for average sales per
square foot at the parks' retail outlets, but he said the
figure is "in many cases 10 times that of traditional retail
America."
   One important geographic area not included in the
agreement is Japan, where Disney operates Tokyo Disneyland
and Mattel is attempting to crack the retail market. Disney
properties are popular in Japan, the world's No. 2 toy
market. But much of Disney's licensing there is tied up with
the Japanese theme park's landowner and a Japanese toy maker,
Tomy Ltd.
   Neither Mr. Wells nor Mr. Amerman would discuss specific
plans for future Japanese toy licenses because of the
delicate relationships with their respective Japanese
business contacts. Mattel plans to introduce Barbie products
there first, and hopes to add other lines, perhaps including
new Disney products.

exposition opened.;    Many companies appeared to be taking a more

sales rose 20.9 percent in dollars and 33.8 percent in units.;    Officials
forecast wholesale and retail toy sales would rise 5 percent for 1991, but

increases, not more sales.;    George R. Ditomassi, the trade group's

<HEAD>Mattel's Income Up 73 Percent</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Mattel Inc. Thursday reported a 73 percent gain in third-quarter
earnings and said sales grew by about a third thanks to strong
performances by Barbie dolls, Hot Wheels and other toys.
   The toy company announced after-tax income of $38 million in the
third quarter compared to $21.9 million a year earlier. Sales rose
34 percent to $410 million from $306.6 million in 1988's third
quarter.
   Quarterly earnings per share of 76 cents in the three months
ended Sept. 30 exceeded per-share earnings for all of 1988. In the
third quarter of last year, per-share earnings came to 45 cents.
   John W. Amerman, Mattel's chairman and chief executive officer,
said the company's double-digit growth occurred despite lackluster
sales industrywide.
   ``Worldwide retail trade and consumer sales for Barbie, Hot
Wheels Disney Infant and Preschool toys, and products introduced in
1989 remain very strong,'' said John W. Amerman, Mattel's chairman
and chief executive officer.
   ``The prospects for a strong fourth quarter are good,'' Amerman
said.
   Mattel earned $58.9 million, or $1.19 a share, through the first
nine months of 1989, up 32 percent from $25.4 million, or 53 cents
a share, during three quarters of last year.
   Nine-month revenue rose 25 percent to $877.6 million from $702.4
million.
   Mattel currently is based in Hawthorne, Calif. but it plans to
move to a new headquarters building in El Segundo by the end of
1990.

PEOPLE: ASPIRING STAR ISN'T TOYING WITH ROLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some days, Tanya Newbould must contemplate who she is. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, she just returned from a toy show in New York where she took on 
the role of Barbie, the doll. 
</P>
<P>
Other times she is known as Miss Hollywood USA, Miss Newport Beach and, most 
recently, as Miss Prettiest Eyes. 
</P>
<P>
And at times the Corona del Mar woman becomes a Marilyn Monroe impersonator. 
</P>
<P>
"In my career I have to be versatile with all these roles, but I'm keeping a 
close association with myself," said the aspiring actress, a Cal State Long 
Beach student in speech communications. "I'm looking for stardom." 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, said Newbould, 24: "I have to know who I am and what direction I'm 
heading. And I have to know my capabilities. I know I'm not the most beautiful 
woman out there." 
</P>
<P>
Newbould, a tall (5-foot-9) striking blonde, feels her greatest lesson was in 
last year's Miss California contest. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even make the top 15," she said. "Before the contest they told all of 
us to be ourselves, but I was trying to be more than that." 
</P>
<P>
She used that lesson to help her be named Barbie, Mattel Toy Co.'s famous doll. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really surprised when I was named Barbie over 25 others," she said. "I 
learned from past experiences not to get my hopes up." 
</P>
<P>
It was like a dream come true, said Newbould, who looks remarkably like the 
Barbie doll. 
</P>
<P>
"Barbie has always been my idol and I feel every little girl feels that way," 
she said. "This is a positive relationship." 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, Newbould feels she has been living the life style of Barbie 
through the advertisements and commercials in television and magazines. At 
times she is Dance Magic Barbie, Home Pretty Barbie and soon, Rock Star Barbie, 
the different characters of the doll. 
</P>
<P>
"Barbie is a friendly, outgoing personality that likes to dress up and go 
places and do things," she said, "and that's a lot like my own personality." 
</P>
<P>
Besides playing Barbie to market the doll, Newbould will soon visit sick 
children as Barbie in Los Angeles and Orange County hospitals. The one-time 
nursing student said: "I am my own marketing tool, which means I have to be 
very disciplined. If I'm not eating right, getting enough rest and not in good 
shape, I'm losing money. To me, this is all a business venture." 
</P>
<P>
Reaching stardom is a slow process that means a frenzied and difficult life 
style, said Newbould, who has been a model and actress for five years and has 
appeared in one television movie and several TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the most insane schedule," she said, "but I'm happy doing what I'm 
doing and I'm learning all the time. I've already experienced enough in five 
years than most people have in their entire life." 
</P>
<P>
And during that time, Newbould said, she has not had negative experiences. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very businesslike when I do my work. I don't give anyone a false 
impression." 
</P>
<P>
And someday, "I'll get married and have children. But first I want to be a 
star." 
</P>
<P>
Veteran pool shooter Robin Bell, 32, of Costa Mesa just returned from Burgheim, 
Germany, after winning the first World Women's Pocket Billiards Championship 
over 15 other women and pocketing $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, a mother of two, said she is currently ranked No. 2 by the American 
Women's Billiards Assn. 
</P>
<P>
But the left-handed shooting pool player said she scored a first. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the first time the world championship has ever been held," she said, 
"so I guess that makes me No. 1 in the world." 
</P>
<P>
She calls herself a homemaker. "I have a pool table at home where I practice," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
More unusual names have been sent to the People Column, including this one from 
Linda Moak of Cypress: "My father is a mechanic and works on the car of a 
physician in Tulsa whose name is Dr. Safety First." 
</P>
<P>
And Noel White, of Fullerton, wrote this: "My name is Noel and I have a twin 
brother (named) Leon. He's backwards because he was the second born."

   Turtles-on-Ice may sound like tempting
delicacies to adventurous food fanatics but these reptiles are
inedible.
   A band of skating, human-sized Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will
stage an ice show Sunday on a rink in New York's Central Park.
   The show featuring costumed professionals on loan from the Ice
Capades is one of the gimmicks planned for this year's Toy Fair, an
annual outpouring of hyperbole to stoke enthusiasm for new
creations and old favorites.
   Toymakers spare no expense or imagination in dreaming up
attention-grabbing stunts for the annual 10-day event in New York.
   ``This is show biz. This is a fun industry and this sets a tone
of fun, excitement and adventure,'' said Frank Reysen Jr., editor
of Playthings magazine, a trade publication.
   Publicity also is serious business for a multibillion-dollar
industry in which companies rely on the capricious tastes of
children. At the trade exhibition, manufacturers try to hook buyers
from all over the country scouting for inventory that will move off
store shelves quickly.
   Toy Fair visitors _ who must be members of the trade or media
and at least 18 years old _ typically encounter clowns, actors
dressed as cartoon characters, real movie stars, sports celebrities
and outlandish creatures.
   This year a fierce but environmentally friendly intergalactic
ninja named Zen will debut, as will a 12-foot ``BRIKasaurus Tex,''
a dinosaur replica built from BRIK Toy Co. blocks. Another company
plans to assemble the world's biggest crossword puzzle with the
help of 50 schoolchildren.
   Hasbro Inc. will have on hand the New Kids on the Block to pitch
a new doll line modeled on the singing fivesome.
   Super models Christie Brinkley, Beverly Johnson and Cheryl Tiegs
will show up to plug high-fashion dolls from Matchbox Toys (USA)
Ltd.
   Anniversaries are planned for some old-timers in toyland. Etch A
Sketch will be feted for turning 30 by Ohio Art Co. while Tonka
Corp. will pay tribute as its Mighty Tonka Truck line rumbles into
year 25.
   Barbie, who celebrated her 30th birthday last year with much
fanfare, will add a new career in 1990. At a black-tie gala Monday
night, Mattel Inc. will announce that the darling of the doll world
will become an ambassador of international goodwill.
   Mattel will outline plans to sponsor the ``Barbie Summit,''
designed to bring children together from different countries to
talk about world issues. To add drama, the company has flown to New
York a 6-year-old East German girl, Anika Polzin, who had been
photographed clutching a new Barbie on her first visit recently to
West Germany.
   The most tongue-in-cheek publicity pitch may be delivered by the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles courtesy of Playmates Toys Inc. The
figures are based on a comic about four pet turtles endowed with
human proportions after they were doused by a mutagen chemical in a
sewer. They learned Ninja ways from a martial arts master mutated
into a giant rat.
   The turtles, fighting for life, liberty and the pursuit of
pizza, their favorite food, will appear around New York. The
skating show, an Easter Seal benefit, will be followed by a Meet
the Mutants autograph session.
   Industry gimmicks concocted to beseech the press for publicity
reached new levels this year. An actor in a turtle costume peddling
free pizza was dispatched Friday to woo reporters who will be
covering Toy Fair.
   A small party of the turtles and their foes were to troop around
the streets of Manhattan on Monday. A local radio station plans to
interview Wall Street brokers for reaction to New York's first
mutant parade.
   Playmates, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based Playmates Holdings
Ltd., also is aggressively promoting its line spun off from the
upcoming Dick Tracy movie. The film, starring Warren Beatty and
Madonna, opens June 15.
   One hundred pairs of personalized handcuffs were sent to members
of the media. To get the keys, reporters must show up at the
Playmates showroom during the fair.
   About 350 reporters received ``talking'' invitations to see the
Dick Tracy stuff. Cards of walkie-talkie wrist telephones, costing
$8.50 a pop, contained sophisticated circuitry that summoned
individual reporters by name to the Playmates showroom.
   Why go to such trouble?
   ``This is really the only chance of impressing and reaching the
toy buyers about your product line,'' said Timothy Unger, a public
relations executive handling the Playmates account.
   With hundreds of exhibitors at Toy Fair, he said. ``it's very
important that you add as much pizazz as possible to your program.''

<HEAD>Michael Boskin: Showing Bush How To Keep Recovery Going</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Personal File-Summers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   When Ronald Reagan was preparing to debate
Jimmy Carter in 1980, Stanford University economist Michael J.
Boskin had a background role as a practice questioner.
   One administration later, Boskin is providing some answers for
George Bush in his drive for the presidency.
   Boskin, 42, is by all accounts ready to follow Bush to the White
House in January to collect the reward due a highly regarded,
staunchly loyal Republican economist. The influential chairmanship
of the president's Council of Economic Advisers may await if Bush
wins.
   ``Michael is right there at the top'' of the hierarchy of
campaign advisers, said Mark Goodin, Bush's deputy press secretary.
``He is very heavily involved in advising the vice president on a
wide range of economic issues.''
   Boskin's most notable contribution to the campaign is a proposal
he helped to shape for dealing with the federal budget deficit. The
so-called flexible freeze would hold federal spending, except for
Social Security benefits, to the levels of the 1989 budget plus
inflation.
   The political beauty of the plan is that it doesn't commit Bush
to any specific budget cuts. Individual programs would not have to
be frozen, but additional spending in any category would have to be
balanced by reductions in other programs.
   This summer Boskin was quoted widely as saying it could
eliminate the $150 billion deficit, which he sees as the nation's
most pressing economic problem, in four years. But he contended in
a recent interview only that it would achieve the task ``over the
next few years.''
   ``It will depend partly on how the economy does,'' he said. ``I
never said it would entirely eliminate the deficit by 1993.''
   It is that caution and sense of what is both ``eminently do-able
and sound economics,'' as he describes the conditional freeze, that
has earned Bush's trust.
   As part of his growing campaign duties, Boskin now flies around
the country briefing reporters and audiences on the vice
president's proposals. He also prepares position papers and reviews
the proposals of other economists.
   Last May, he was one of a group of experts who visited Bush at
his home in Kennebunkport, Maine, to plot economic strategy. Among
others at that meeting was Martin S. Feldstein, former chairman of
President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, who also remains a
high-profile economic adviser to Bush.
   Boskin, like his counterpart in the Democratic camp, Lawrence
Summers of Harvard University, is at ease mixing economics and
politics.
   ``What's especially good about Michael is that he's had some
practical experience and has a good idea how the world works,''
said Martin Anderson, former domestic policy adviser to Reagan and
Boskin's colleague at the Hoover Institution.
   ``He has an excellent reputation as an economist, and he also
has an idea of the reasonable political thing to do,'' he said.
   A native of New York, Boskin moved to Los Angeles with his
family when he was 6. His father was working as a construction
contractor, his mother as a bookkeeper and then an accountant.
   He studied economics at the University of California at
Berkeley, where he was named the outstanding graduate of the class
of 1967.
   Boskin wrote his dissertation on the effects of welfare and
other income-maintenance programs on the size of the labor force,
winning the National Tax Association's award for outstanding
doctoral dissertation.
   He is described by Anderson as a hard-line Republican, but at
Berkeley in the tumultuous '60s Boskin was known as quite liberal.
   ``I was sympathetic with the goals _ freedom of speech, civil
rights _ and I still am,'' he said earlier this year. ``But I was
not sympathetic with the methods,'' such as student sit-ins and
strikes.
   He went from Berkeley to Stanford, where he has been ever since
except for a year of teaching at Harvard a decade ago and brief
periodic consulting jobs for Congress. Besides his unpaid work for
Bush this year, he has been busy writing two books on economics,
teaching a graduate course in fiscal policy and an introductory
economics course, and acting as West Coast director of the National
Bureau of Economic Research, a think tank.
   Boskin minces no words in his criticism of the economic policies
of Bush's campaign foe. He says Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
would foul up ``one of the best growth episodes in the 20th
century'' that has occurred over the past five years.
   ``That includes a huge reduction in inflation and interest rates
and immense expansion of employment,'' he said.
   While he acknowledges that growth in wages has fallen behind the
pace of the 1950s and '60s, he contends that's a by-product of
rapid job growth and says overall living standards have not
declined.
   ``We have the beginning of some major transformations in the
role of government in the economy. We've had success in reducing
marginal tax rates. ... We have to build on what we have,'' Boskin
said.
   Boskin was sharply critical of Reagan's early policies in his
book entitled ``Reagan and the Economy: The Successes, Failures and
Unfinished Agenda.'' But like Bush, who eight years ago brass who
appears on the new ABC sitcom ``Just the 10 of Us.''
   Commercials begin with the Maxie doll at school or with friends,
then switch to Theiss, the ``real-life Maxie,'' in the same
situations, Charness said, calling it ``innovative advertising for
a fashion doll.''
   The company expects to spend about $7 million on Maxie
commercials and live presentations through the end of the year,
Charness said.
   Maxie comes in several variations: three different ``Making
Waves'' dolls, a ``Looking Smart'' doll with skirt, stockings and
boots; and a scented ``Perfect Prom'' doll with pink mini-gown.
Prices range from $5.50 to $13.
   She also has four friends: Ron, her boyfriend; Carly, another
blonde; Ashley, a red-head; and Kristen, who's black. She has a
myriad of accessories, from a cordless telephone to a locker with
built-in shower.
   Hasbro is betting that Barbie has outgrown some of the potential
market among young girls.
   Barbie is older, ``a yuppie if you will,'' Charness explained.
``We felt there was a real need in the market for dolls that are
younger.''
   Maxie is a high school student who does ``the type of things
girls would (imagine doing),'' Charness said.
   But Mattel, the No. 2 toy company, says Maxie, a long-haired,
perpetually smiling teen with lace stockings, white boots and
various hair do-dads, won't even put a dent in the solid success of
Barbie.
   ``This year, we're selling tremendously more dolls, fashions and
accessories,'' said Jocelyn Carter-Miller, director of marketing at
Mattel, based in Hawthorne, Calif.
   She cited ``unprecedented growth,'' but would not provide
specifics.
   ``I don't feel it's a significant threat to Barbie's No. 1
position as a fashion doll,'' Mrs. Carter-Miller said of Maxie.
``She's been in the No. 1 position for 29 years, and this year is a
record year.''
   And Barbie is not just an executive yuppie, Mrs. Carter-Miller
said, but a teen-ager as well.
   ``Barbie represents everything, from being a teen-ager up to a
doctor,'' she said.
   Barbie, introduced as a teen-age fashion doll in 1959, was an
airline stewardess in the 1960s and 1970s, a registered nurse,
fashion editor, astronaut and skin diver in the 1960s, and a doctor
in the early 1970s.
   ``She has been able to be ageless. That's something that makes
Barbie very special and makes her existence difficult to compete
with,'' Mrs. Carter-Miller said.
   Industry analyst David Liebowitz of American Securities in New
York, although noting that Maxie can wear Barbie's clothes, said
Maxie could not survive if it were merely a Barbie clone.
   ``What we are seeing now are products that aren't competing
head-to-head with Barbie but are slightly differentiated,''
Leibowitz said.
   Steven Eisenberg of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. in New York suggested
that Maxie's lower price range could bolster its competitive
position.
   Although basic-issue Barbies can be obtained for as little as
$4, the $13 top-of-the-line Maxie is slightly less expensive than
the comparable Perfume Pretty edition of Barbie, which sells for
$15.
   ``What Hasbro is attempting to do here is to capture a moderate
share of the fashion doll market at a low price range,'' Eisenberg
said.

<HEAD>Toymaker Says 1988 Profit Of $35.9 Million Demonstrates Recovery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAWTHORNE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mattel Inc. said Tuesday that two years
of belt-tightening and refocusing on such tried-and-true toys as
Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels toy cars paid off in a modest 1988
profit of $35.9 million.
   That is far less than the $80 million Mattel earned in 1985, but
a vast improvement from losses of $8.3 million in 1986 and $113.2
million in 1987.
   The $35.9 million profit reported Tuesday amounts to 75 cents a
share. Sales in 1988 were $990 million, compared with $1 billion in
1987.
   In 1988's fourth quarter, Mattel earned $10.5 million, or 22
cents a share, compared with a $100.7 million loss in the fourth
quarter of 1987. Sales in the quarter were $287.6 million, up from
$233.8 million a year earlier.
   ``Our plan to return the company to solid profitability is on
course,'' John Amerman, chairman and chief executive, said in a
statement.
   In addition to Barbie and Hot Wheels, the company said it enjoyed
retail success with the Little Miss Makeup doll and a line of
Disney-themed toys for toddlers and pre-schoolers.
   The 1987 loss was blamed on a restructuring program that included
laying off 500 employees at Mattel's headquarters, closing several
plants overseas and doing away with marginal toy lines.
   The 1986 loss was blamed in large part on slumping sales of the
once-popular Masters of the Universe toys.

<TEXT>     Frankly, they're doing plenty. They not only crawl, walk, talk and burp,
they fill their diapers with disgusting things that could set motherhood back
200 years. A doll called Madeline has a scar from her appendix operation; a
Mermaid doll, when immersed in cold water, will change color. Big deal.;  
Another doll's hair changes color when the temperature changes. One wears
glasses; another makes sucking noises when a bottle is put to her lips. There
was one with feet that grow 2 inches a month.;   In the quest to have art
imitate life, there is a new doll on the shelves this Christmas called the
"Happy To Be Me" doll. It's touted as a politically correct Barbie with a
social agenda. Her mission? To help young girls develop realistic body images
and accept themselves as they are.;   The whole concept titillated me. Would
"Happy" have cellulite that made her look like a Cadillac with fins? A stomach
implant? Veins in the back of her knees like a New England road map? No. She
had bigger feet than fashion dolls, her legs bent, and her measurements were
36-27-38 compared to Barbie's 36-18-33, but she still didn't look like anyone
I'd seen recently in Loehmann's fitting room.;   It brings up the question,
how much reality can we stand? Barbie has endured for more than 32 years.
She's been an astronaut, a UNICEF ambassador, a summit diplomat, an airline
pilot and a Canadian Mountie.;   She's dated Ken for 30 years. Considering his
jobs have been less exciting than hers (a businessman in 1965 and a flight
attendant in 1990), neither seem threatened.;   She has not had a mother
pressuring her to give her grandchildren. She's never succumbed to
commercialism by bringing out an exercise video.;   Who is to say that Dolly
Parton didn't fantasize over Barbie's 2-inch bust or that all of us haven't
wanted to tear off our head and replace it with a new hairstyle? Barbie has
kept the dream alive. That's what dolls are all about.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Mattel Inc., which has come through a year of sometimes wrenching restructuring and downsizing, has revised its marketing strategy to succeed in a toy business that wants more basic playthings and has fewer stores and more competition for shelf space. 

   Gone will be company funding for expensive kiddie cartoon shows whose characters are based on toys. 

   Gone, too, will be nearly 20% of the individual toys presented to retailers each year. 
Instead, a greater percentage of sales will come from longtime staples such as Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars. 
Advertising-promotional expenses will shrink too. 

   And also gone, or at least considerably downplayed, will be Mattel's vaunted attempt over the past half-decade to make toys an all-year-round business. 

   "Last year was a difficult one for the industry and for us," concedes John W. Amerman, who became chairman and chief executive officer of the world's second largest toy company a little more than a year ago. 
"But we're determined to run this company with greater marketing and financial discipline, and we're going to be highly successful in 1988 and beyond." 

   Mattel reported a net loss in 1987 of $113.2 million after one-time restructuring charges of $96 million. 
Little noticed at the time, the company also effected a "quasi-reorganization" that revalued assets upward by $68.7 million, thus reducing the negative effect of the loss on shareholders' equity. 

   Mattel in the early 1980s was a company driven to increase volume almost for its own sake, and in fact, sales nearly doubled between 1982 and 1985, Mr. Amerman notes. 
But the extra layers of management and vast expansion of manufacturing capacity became a burden as sales flattened and then turned south, he adds. 

   Mattel was starting to work on the problems. 
"And then came the Oct. 19 crash, and retailers in an unprecedented way pulled back on orders," Mr. Amerman says. 

   So Mattel speeded up its changes. 
By the end of June, Mr. Amerman will have shuttered 10 facilities accounting for 40% to 50% of the company's world-wide manufacturing capacity. 
Some 500 headquarters positions, or 22% of the total, were eliminated. 
Mattel is also keeping its inventories lower than at any time in the past few years by making "less aggressive volume projections," Mr. Amerman says. 

   But long-term health required basic changes in Mattel's marketing strategies. 

   "We've decided to concentrate on those areas where we've historically been strong, while slowly building in other areas," such as preschool, where the firm has signed a long-term licensing agreement to use Disney characters on its entire line, Mr. Amerman says. 
Mattel has cut the total number of individual toys it sells to around 650 from 800, and is shying away from heavily advertised "promotional" toys that tend to fade after one season. 

   "We want to take a rifle-shot, not a buckshot, approach to the business by picking our risks carefully instead of going for high volume across the board," Mr. Amerman says. 
"We're looking for items that'll last two to four years or more." 
Barbie, who will turn 30 next year, accounted for about 40% of world-wide sales last year and is back this year with a new advertising campaign and fashions. 

   Total advertising and promotion expenses are expected to continue dropping. 
In 1986, they were $198.2 million, or 19% of sales; last year they were $188.2 million, or 18%; and this year they are expected to drop to around $174 million, or 16%. 
Mattel has cut back on its mall and other live promotions. 

   But a major reason for the drop is that Mattel will no longer itself fund children's television programs, a practice that has come under fire by some parents' groups. 
In 1986 alone, Mattel figures it spent $6.4 million more than the advertising value it received to fund production of TV cartoons. 

   The company also will go along more with consumer buying patterns, rather than try to buck them, Mr. Amerman says. 
"I guess there's a philosophical change here, but we realize that we can't load the retailer with an awful lot of product early in the year that won't move until the last quarter."

   Barbie doll maker Mattel Inc. said a federal court judge
barred Lundby of Sweden AB and its U.S. unit from airing a
television commercial that promotes Lundby's Petra doll as a
friend of Barbie's.
   Judge David V. Kenyon granted Mattel's request for a
preliminary injunction to halt the commercials pending trial
of a suit brought by Mattel against Lundby earlier this
month. The suit charges Lundby with false advertising, unfair
competition and trademark violations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The order restrains Lundby from "directly or indirectly
identifying and/or suggesting" that any of its dolls are
related to Barbie, or any other dolls sold by Mattel.
   Officials at Lundby of Sweden USA Inc., based in Tucson,
Ariz., couldn't be reached for comment. A spokeswoman for
Mattel, based in El Segundo, Calif., said a trial date hasn't
been set.

<DESCRIPT>  VIDEO; GAME; TREND  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  BOYS ages 11 through 17 have long been the core market for home video games.; 
  But two small video manufacturers hope to change some of that this year with
two new games targeted for little girls ages 6 through 11.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Weekend  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  MANUFACTURERS AIM GAMES AT LITTLE GIRLS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     This summer Capcom USA will introduce "The Little Mermaid" video game, and
in the fall Hi Tech Expressions will follow that with a "Barbie" video game.; 
  Both companies say they hope to offer a video game that little girls will
like and will feel is exclusively theirs.;    "Until now, girls have had to
make do with their brothers' games," said Kathleen Watson, Capcom director of
marketing. "Now they can say, 'I have the Little Mermaid game and my brother
hates it.' ";    Both games differ from conventional video games in their
approach to violence: Hardly any.;    "The Little Mermaid" loosely follows the
plot of the movie.;    Ariel's friends have been captured by Ursula the sea
witch, and it's her job to set them free. But to do so, the Little Mermaid
must make it through a series of worlds, some on land and others under the
sea.;    By collecting things -- shells, little fish -- the Little Mermaid
builds her strength and eventually is strong enough to take on Ursula.;   
"Barbie" has an even more benign motif, but one that is in character for
Mattel's fashion-conscious classic.;    Barbie is asleep, dreaming about the
ball she is going to but worried that she has nothing to wear. She solves her
problem by succeeding through a series of worlds, at the end of which are
various accessories and clothes she'll need to be the hit of the party.;   
For example, in one underwater world, Barbie gets by a large octopus by
tossing it a compact and slipping behind it while the octopus is primping.;   
In other video games, when the lead characters fail they die, and you have to
start the game over again. But of course, Barbie can never die! In this game,
if Barbie fails she merely wakes up, and then you start the game again.;   
"Barbie is about glamour," says Joan Ziegler, vice president of product
acquisition for Hi Tech. "That's what we are trading on with this. It's very
pro-social and positive and not an aggressive, beat-'em-up game.";    Hi Tech
and Capcom have previously introduced video games targeted for a preschool
audience. Between the two companies there are Muppets, Disney and Sesame
Street games.;    But this is the first time both companies have decided to
introduce something that will immediately exclude boys.;    Ziegler says video
game demographics are the reason. Nintendo has sold about 30 million game
systems, Ziegler said, and the 6- to 11-year-old market accounts for about 7
percent of that. While it's only a small fraction, she said that's up from 3
percent in 1988.;    Capcom plans to bring out its Little Mermaid game in
June. Suggested retail will be $44.95.;    Barbie is scheduled to come out in
October. Suggested retail also will be $44.95.  </TEXT>

   After a 13-year furlough, the original G.I. Joe, is back
-- for limited duty.
   In an unusual move, Hasbro Inc., maker of the doll, has
produced an early version of the Great American Hero
exclusively for Target Stores.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Target, a division of Dayton Hudson Corp., which featured
the doll in newspaper advertisements this weekend, hopes the
doll will give the chain, in Minneapolis, a slight edge in
battling competitors.
   "This is a coup in itself for Target," declared Mark
Pritchard, a Target toy buyer who thought up the idea.
   To be sure, the exclusive arrangement has irked a few
rival toy retailers. "My buyers were aware of this and they
were pretty upset about it," said Ronald Tuchman, president
of Child World Inc., Avon, Mass. But he added, Child World
plans "to aggressively pursue similar deals with toy
manufacturers."
   Indeed, Hasbro, is talking to a couple of toy retailers
about the possibility of striking similar limited edition
agreements to manufacture G.I. Joe, though production
wouldn't be for this Christmas, a spokesman for the
Pawtucket, R.I., toy maker said.
   Such arrangements, though rare in the toy industry, could
become more frequent soon. Mattel Inc., in El Segundo,
Calif., has assigned special staff to explore one-on-one
agreements. It has arranged deals with individual retailers
for the Christmas introduction of a line of Peter Pan
characters called Hook, a company spokesman said.
   The practice is fairly common in other markets. Tony
department stores are eager to get exclusive regional rights
to launch fragrances, such as the new Spellbound, believing
the excitement it generates will give them an edge, no matter
how fleeting. They also cut deals with clothing designers to
be the only chain in their region to carry a style -- and
sometimes an entire line.
   "Retailers are always looking for ways to come up with
exclusives," says Carl Steidtmann, chief economist at the
Management Horizons unit of Price Waterhouse accountants, New
York. "In many cases, they'll put an extra feature on or
change a color and say it's an exclusive."
   Chains today get exclusive rights to everything from
telephones to appliances and mattresses, with only slight
variations from models offered by competitors. In another
twist, Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Chicago, is selling an
exclusive line of Admiral-brand televisions and videocassette
recorders under a licensing agreement with Maytag Corp.,
Newton, Iowa, which owns the trademark.
   Exclusivity can be beneficial for both manufacturer and
retailer.
   "It's a nice piece of incremental business for the toy
maker, and it gives the retailer a point of distinction,"
explained a spokesman for Mattel, which now makes customized
toys and gift sets for a number of retailers.
   Target, for instance, has "Golden Evening" Barbie, a
dress-up doll, that no other chain carries. Likewise Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., a unit of Walton Enterprises Inc., Bentonville,
Ark., has a lavender attired "Ballroom Barbie" and F A O
Schwarz, New York, has "Nights Sensation Barbie."
   For toy makers it is also a less risky approach to testing
new ideas, added a Hasbro spokesman. The company will closely
watch Target's sales to determine the viability of bringing
back the old Joe, he noted.
   Moreover exclusive toys afford retailers the luxury of
pricing items, without worrying about matching a competitor's
tag.
   G.I. Joe is a case under study, at least for a few
retailers.
   The toy -- introduced in 1964 and then pulled from the
market in 1978 -- is 12 inches tall, nearly three times the
size of the Joe found in toy stores today. A collector's
choice, particularly among those who grew up playing with the
doll, the old Joe, in mint condition, commands thousands of
dollars on the market.
   At KMart Corp. in Troy, Mich., boys toy buyer Kerry MacVay
said he was surprised when he heard about the exclusive
arrangement from his Hasbro contacts three months ago. But he
isn't pushing Hasbro to sell him any dolls -- yet.
   "I'm a little more skeptical than the Target people," he
says, explaining that he's taking a wait-and-see approach on
military toys. "My initial thoughts were it's a collectors
item," he adds. "If this works, {Hasbro is} planning on
coming out with a full assortment. They will get behind it
and that's when I will get involved."
   Mr. MacVay acknowledges that, in retailing, "it's
important to get out on the leading edge of something." If
the doll sells well at Target, he admits, "I'll kick myself
for not thinking about it first."
   A spokesman for Wal-Mart said that the discount chain's
toy buyers "haven't had time to talk to Hasbro about it.
Their plans were to talk with Hasbro, but it would be later
in the year."
   Exclusive deals, however, are a delicate matter. Mattel
sidesteps potential controversy by offering to make "private
label" toys for all retailers. The distinguishing point of a
toy could just be the color of a doll's dress or the
trimmings of a car.
   Hasbro apparently has left plenty of room for similar
maneuvering in agreeing to manufacture Target's Joe.
   The new doll, called "Duke," is fashioned after only one
of several hundred G.I. Joe characters, developed over the
years.
   Duke is 12 inches tall, and like the old Joe, comes in a
camouflage outfit made of cloth. The current crop of Joes
come in plastic clothes that are pasted on to the figure. But
not to be outdated, Duke carries a modern electronic light
and sound weapon, included separately in the box.
   The remake of old Joe isn't expected to impact the
collectors' market since the "Duke" character was created
only after the second generation of G.I. Joes was introduced
in 1982, and won't be confused with any from the old cast.
   Target officials won't disclose how many of the Duke dolls
will go on sale. Insiders put the number at 80,000, each of
which is individually numbered and comes in a package,
stamped with a gold seal. The doll retails for $22, a little
more than what the average action figure sells for.
   Duking it out with toy supermarkets, like Toys "R" Us
Inc., Rochelle Park, N.J., and Child World, which offer a
much broader selection of toys, can be a struggle for
department and discount stores. "Duke gives us a little
something extra against the super stores," Mr. Pritchard of
Target said.

<MEMO>  Inside Our Towns  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Already, requests for the doll have come in to at least one local store --
Kay-Bee Toy and Hobby Shop in Newark's NewPark Mall. But employees there were
secretive about their plans to carry Hammer.;    "The company doesn't allow us
to talk to reporters," announced one, then another, as if they had memorized
the line in training. They referred the inquiry on this weighty matter to the
company's Lee, Mass., headquarters. There the word was that only Vice
President of Advertising Ken Cunniff could discuss Hammer, and he wasn't in.
They said he'd get back. He hasn't.;    No such security problem was
encountered at Karl's Toys and Hobbies at the Fremont Hub. Clerk Sonya Van
Sickle said she had not yet heard of the doll, but that the store probably
will carry it when it is available because it sells Barbie and Ken.;    The
new doll was unveiled at last month's toy fair in New York.;    Lisa German of
the Mattel Co., creator of the Barbie and Ken line, said Hammer was chosen as
Barbie's first celebrity friend "because he's sensational and his music
presents a positive image for children, in keeping with the Mattel image.";   
German said the Hammer doll will come in two versions, one wearing a gold
costume and the other wearing maroon. "There will also be several outfits
available," she said.;    The doll will cost about $25.;    Save up for the
children.; DOLLS, DOLLS, DOLLS: A survey of local stores revealed that the
likenesses of living people such as Hammer command a wide variety of prices
and are made of diverse materials. Joe Montana and Mark McGuire command top
dollar while Ronald Reagan, George Bush and Margaret Thatcher are cheap. They
are made of different stuff. The Gift Gallery in the Hub offers ceramic
Montanas and McGuires for between $60 and $125. The politicians, about the
same size but made of vinyl, go for $5.99 at the Petco Co. pet store, also at
the Hub. Montana and McGuire do not talk or make any sound, but the Reagan,
Bush and Thatcher dolls squeal when you or your dog squeezes them.; SHOOT YOUR
PETS: Speaking of dogs, pet owners can bring their dogs or cats to a low-cost
vaccination clinic from 4 to 5:30 p.m. Saturday at the Fremont Hub. Parasite
control and major vaccination will be available for $5 to $10 each. The clinic
will be held in the parking lot in front of Petco, near Safeway. The clinic is
sponsored by Petco and Pet Prevent-A-Care, a mobile vaccination clinic. For

   Game players in Cuba can't play ``Monopoly'' legally, since
Premier Fidel Castro once ordered all known sets seized and
destroyed, saying it was ``symbolic of an imperialistic and
capitalistic system.''
   But Parker Brothers, which has sold over 100 million sets since
the game was introduced in l935, says the Soviet Union, which also
banned it, is now letting Russians mortgage little red hotels to
their hearts' content. The game, invented by a man named Charles B.
Darrow during a spell of unemployment in 1933, now is distributed
in 35 countries and in 19 languages.

   Silly Putty was invented accidentally in a General Electric
Company lab during World War II, when its scientists were trying to
develop synthetic rubber for the war effort.
   Besides providing an instant medium for fledgling sculptors,
this substance has been used to pick lint, clean typewriter keys,
level wobbly furniture, help the Apollo 8 astronauts fasten down
tools during weightless flight, and to take hand and foot prints of
the gorilla population at the Columbus, Ohio, Zoo. Its
manufacturer, Binney &amp; Smith, also says that New England Patriots
football team members squeeze Silly Putty to strengthen their hands
for catching passes.

   One of the oldest toys is the yo-yo, with origins in a primitive
weapon used by prehistoric Filipino hunters. The original version
had a sharp piece of flint attached to a long thong. If the
hunter's aim was poor, he could retrieve the weapon and try again.
   The yo-yo evolved as a court toy in 17th and 18th century France
and Spain; a painting of a nobleman holding a yo-yo hangs in the
Louvre in Paris.
   Playing with the yo-yo is a national sport in the Philippines
and is practiced around the world. Over a half a billion yo-yos
have been sold in the United States alone since they were
introduced commercially in the late 1920s, according to the
Flambeau Corporation-Duncan Toys.

   The Teddy Bear is a namesake of President Theodore Roosevelt and
originated in 1902, when the president refused to kill a bear that
his hunting party had captured and tied up for him to shoot.
Roosevelt said it would be unsportsmanlike to take advantage of the
defenseless animal.
   Publicity about the incident inspired a merchant, Morris
Michtom, to name two toy bears after the president and display them
in his shop window in Brooklyn, N.Y. According to authors Peggy and
Alan Bialosky in ``The Teddy Bear Catalog,'' Michtom received
presidential permission to market the stuffed toys under the name
``Teddy's Bears.'' The resulting success led Michtom to found the
Ideal Toy &amp; Novelty Co.

   Like a true waif, the original Raggedy Ann was a castoff found
in an attic and adopted by 8-year-old Marcella Gruelle in 1914.
   Her father, John Gruelle, a political cartoonist for the
Indianapolis News, drew a face for the stuffed, faceless doll, and
her mother, Myrtle, added a candy heart inscribed,``I love you.''
   To entertain his terminally-ill daughter, Gruelle made up
stories about Raggedy Ann. After Marcella died, he began writing
the stories as a memorial, with the first Raggedy Ann book
appearing in 1918. It later inspired the manufactured dolls, books,
TV shows, comics, movies and a Broadway musical.

   The game of tossing disks around in the air may go back before
history, but the legend of Frisbees is traceable to a story of some
Connecticut college students who made a sport of tossing empty pie
tins from Mother Frisbie's Pie Factory and yelling ``frisbie'' as
an alert to the flight of the plates.
   An entrepreneur named Fred Morrison took up the idea, selling
disks at state fairs. In the late 1940s, he sold the idea to
Wham-O, a toy company.

   That fashion plate, Barbie, reached her 30th birthday in 1989.
   Since she was introduced in 1959, the Barbie doll has had
numerous careers and lifestyles _ a model, ``flower child,'' doctor
and astronaut. Named after the daughter of the inventors, Ruth and
Elliot Handler, Barbie is the best-selling and possibly best-known
fashion doll in history.
   More than 500 million dolls representing Barbie and her clan
have been sold, and Mattel Toys, which makes Barbie, says it sells
over 20 million Barbie fashions each year.

   The Flexible Flyer, the classic snow sled for children, is 100
years old this year _ a creation growing out of a business
necessity.
   A Pennsylvania farm equipment manufacturer, Samuel Leeds Allen,
invented it to occupy his factory workers during the off-season
months to keep them from leaving for other jobs.

   According to market research by Binney &amp; Smith, the smell of
Crayola Crayons is among the scents most recognized by American
adults, along with coffee and peanut butter.
   Their research also indicates that 65 percent of children in the
United States ages 2 to 7 color or draw at least once a day, for an
average of 27 minutes.
   Alice Stead Binney coined the Crayola tradename for her husband
Edwin's crayons in 1903. It derives from the French word ``craie,''
for colored chalk, and ``oleaginous,'' or oily.

<HL> Toy Industry Faces a Lackluster Year
---
Absence of Runaway
Hits Is a Major Factor
---

<TEXT>
   For the past nine months, G.I. Joe and Barbie doll have been sitting in the one and two slots, respectively, on the bestseller chart for toys. 

   To the toy industry that isn't very good news. 

   It means that runaway hits like Cabbage Patch and Trivial Pursuit, each of which jingled the cash register at more than $500 million a year, are notably absent. 
By comparison, G.I. Joe, projected to bring in $185 million this year, is small potatoes. 

   Last year, without any new hits, the toy industry had lackluster sales. 
And analysts, taking a peek up the road, don't see any blockbuster candidates this year. 
As a result, they are scaling down their estimates of toy sales for 1987. 

   At the start of the year, analysts were projecting a 5% to 7% increases in sales from 1986. 
Thomas Kully, an analyst with William Blair &amp; Co. of Chicago, was among them. 
"Now I'm thinking zero to less than 5% would be more realistic," he said. 

   The second half of the year "is bound to pick up but I don't think it will be enough to save the year," Harold Vogel, a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets analyst, said. 

   Lately, toy makers have been posting disappointing second-quarter earnings. 
In Pawtucket, R.I., Hasbro Inc., the nation's largest toy manufacturer, last week reported a 44% drop in profit on an 11% decline in revenue. 
In Hartford, Conn., Coleco Industries Inc., which sells Cabbage Patch dolls, edged into the black after three quarters in the red, but its second-quarter profit fell 29%. 
And in Fremont, Calif., high-flying Worlds of Wonder Inc. scaled back a planned financing after watching its stock tumble and posting a sharp drop in profit for the quarter ended March 30. 

   The No. 2 toy producer, Mattel Inc. of Hawthorne, Calif., will issue its second-quarter results in mid-August. 
"Don't expect its numbers to be impressive," Mr. Kully said. 
"They'll be at about break-even point." 

   Part of the blame for the current famine is the plenty of the past. 

   Since 1982, the toy industry has been helped by blockbusters such as Pacman, Masters of the Universe and Transformers that caused industrywide sales to multiply sharply. 

   To expect the industry to keep up that pace is unrealistic, said Harry Wells, an analyst at Adams Harkness &amp; Hill in Boston. 
Between 1977 and 1984, annual spending on toys climbed from $65 per child to $168 per child, according to Find/SVP, a New York research group. 
"In those days the industry was like a baseball team with a batting average of .900," Mr. Wells said. 
"Now it's playing .600 ball," he added. 

   "I don't think it's fair to judge things by Cabbage Patch," said Norman Ricken, president of Toys "R" Us Inc. of Rochelle Park, N.J., the nation's largest toy retailer. 

   Mr. Ricken isn't writing off 1987 yet. 
"There are some good products out there. 
Some of them have been late in getting to retailers, like Captain Power (a toy activated by a television set) and Heather Doll, both by Mattel. 
They ought to do well," he added. 

   Others aren't so optimistic. 
Last February, toy manufacturers previewed some of the new products for retailers at a trade show in New York. 
"I didn't really see any excitement on the faces of people as in years past," said Rick Anguilla, editor of Toy &amp; Hobby, a trade publication. 

   In the next few months, Hasbro will introduce Visionary plastic figures portraying characters from a distant planet and Air Raiders dolls and flying objects that operate on air pressure. 

   But Robert Hubbell, Hasbro's vice president, investor relations, isn't predicting another Cabbage Patch phenomenon. 
"Comparing this to the game of baseball, I think Visionaries and Air Raiders will be singles where Cabbage Patch or Trivial Pursuit are home runs. 
But I feel we're still fielding a solid team of steady hitters," he said. 
Using the same analogy, the company's Pogo Bal, third on the Toy &amp; Hobby best-seller chart, is a double, Mr. Hubbell said. 
The company expects Pogo Bal to produce $35 million in sales this year, less than a fifth the sales of its top product, G.I. Joe. 

   Some toys were thought to have potential to become hits this year, but none captured the imagination of the consumer for any length of time. 

   Lazer Tag, Worlds of Wonder's long-nosed pistol that fires infra-red rays, triggered a national craze only for a few weeks. 
Selling for $80 to $130 each, with batteries that had to be replaced often, the game faded in popularity. 
The shooting of a Lazer Tag player in California by a police officer who mistook the youth for an armed prowler didn't help. 

   Hasbro's rock star Jem just couldn't stand up to competition from Mattel's Barbie with its 28-year tradition. 
And talking toys, put out by several companies, didn't climb very high on the charts. 
"Parents couldn't justify paying $70 for something that would hold the interest of their kids for half a week," Mr. Anguilla said. 

   Some toy makers have tried to create new toys based on characters on TV shows, such as "Masters of the Universe." 
The strategy was to use the shows as a promotion tool. 
But their efforts met with limited success. 
"People in the industry thought all you had to do was throw a toy out there with a lot of advertising and an animated show and chances are it was going to succeed. 
Now there is a glut of animated shows," he said. 

   The absence of a blockbuster isn't from lack of trying. 
The fact is no one knows the secret. 
"If I did, I wouldn't be doing what I do," said Hasbro's Mr. Hubbell, suggesting that if he knew what makes a hit toy, he would be in business for himself. 

   "I don't think you're going to get a Cabbage Patch more than once a decade. 
I don't know why, but it doesn't happen," Mr. Kully said.
