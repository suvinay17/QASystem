<HL> PepsiCo to Revamp Caffeine-Free Colas, Mimic Coke's, to Perk Up Slumping Sales </HL>

   PepsiCo Inc. is repositioning its caffeine-free colas in hopes of jolting them out of their sales slump. 

   The company will rename and repackage its brands in the style of Coca-Cola Co.'s Caffeine-Free Diet Coke, which dominates the market with about a 34% share and is the only caffeine-free cola showing any significant growth. 

   Now, the soft drinks will be called simply Caffeine-Free Pepsi and Caffeine-Free Diet Pepsi instead of Pepsi Free and Diet Pepsi Free, and the cans will have a gold background instead of the previous red. 
Caffeine-Free Coke and Diet Coke already come in gold-colored cans, which beverage industry executives say have become the "accepted consumer visual cue" for products without caffeine. 

   It's ironic that Pepsi is restaging its brands to mimic Coke because Pepsi entered the caffeine-free market in 1982, about a year before Coke did. (Royal Crown Cola Co. beat both of its larger rivals into the national soft-drink market with a caffeine-free product called RC100 in 1980.) 

   "The problem with Pepsi Free was that consumers didn't know if that meant sugar free, caffeine free or just what," says Jesse Meyers, publisher of Beverage Digest, a newsletter. 

   He estimates that Pepsi Free and Diet Pepsi Free each had about 1.5% of the soft drink market in food stores last year, a drop from 1.6% each in 1986. 
Caffeine-Free Diet Coke's share grew in 1987 to 2.2% from 1.9%, while Caffeine-Free Coke's share slipped to 0.4% from 0.5%. 
The food-store soft-drink market totals about $15.4 billion annually, Mr. Meyers says. 

   Pepsi test marketed the new names and packaging last year in Albuquerque, N.M., before starting to make the changes on a national basis. 
"We believe there's great potential still in the caffeine-free market and that it's worth pursuing," a Pepsi spokesman said. 
"We're not happy with the status quo and think we can increase sales by restaging the brands." 

   The Purchase, N.Y.-based company plans to announce its revamped brands to consumers this spring with in-store promotions and short messages tagged on to commercials for regular Pepsi and Diet Pepsi. 

   Consumers of caffeine-free colas tend to be older, potentially a positive sign as the large baby-boom generation moves into middle age. 
"There's probably good viability for sugar-free, caffeine-free products among people concerned about their health," says Emanuel Goldman, a beverage analyst at Montgomery Securities. 
"But the sugar colas without caffeine look iffy." 

   Some marketing consultants are more skeptical about the outlook for caffeine-free colas. 
The category hasn't grown much after about eight years, and they figure a new marketing push by Pepsi isn't going to attract many converts. 

   "Americans are fairly comfortable with caffeine," says Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark Inc., a beverage consulting firm in Los Angeles. 
"I just don't think caffeine is going to be the major health scare some marketers expected."

<HEAD>Coke Classic Remains Top-Selling Soft Drink, New Coke Off Top 10
List</HEAD>

   Coca-Cola Classic was tops in 1989, but the
drink known as New Coke that was introduced to replace it in 1985
fell out of the annual Top 10 soft drink rankings for the first
time, an industry newsletter says.
   The rankings released Wednesday by Beverage Digest indicated New
Coke, which had tied with RC Cola and Caffeine-Free Diet Pepsi for
10th place in 1988, failed to make the 10 top rankings this year.
   Publisher Jesse Meyers said Caffeine-Free Diet Pepsi broke the
tie this year, capturing 10th place with a 1.5 percent market share
and leaving RC Cola and New Coke in a close fight for 11th at 1.4
percent each.
   The Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. introduced New Coke in 1985,
saying that it improved on the flavor of it regular cola. But the
company said fans of the original Coca-Cola taste deluged the
company with protests, and the company put the original drink back
on the market three months later as Coca-Cola Classic.
   New Coke was kept alive, but its share of market rapidly fell to
the low single digits after capturing an estimated 15 percent of
1985 soft drink sales.
   In 1989, Coca-Cola Classic retained the top ranking for the
fourth consecutive year, although its market share fell to 20.0
percent from 20.1 percent in 1988.
   Pepsi was second at 18.3 percent, down 0.4 percentage point from
1988.
   Diet Coke placed third with 8.9 percent share of market, Diet
Pepsi was fourth at 5.7 percent and Dr Pepper was fifth at 4.6
percent, according to Beverage Digest, published from Old
Greenwich, Conn.
   Filling out the rest of the Top 10 list were Sprite in sixth
place at 3.6 percent, followed by Mountain Dew at 3.5 percent, 7Up
at 2.9 percent and Caffeine-Free Diet Coke at 2.4 percent.
   The retail value of the soft drink market is $43 billion,
according to Meyers. That is up 2 percent from 1988, when sales
rose 4.5 percent.
   Meyers said the slower growth was due to cooler weather in many
parts of the nation this past summer, a prime sales season for soft
drinks.
   He noted that the four diet soft drinks in the Top 10 this year
had combined market share growth of 1.7 percentage points, while
the six sugared products saw their combined market share fall 0.3
percent.
   ``We are watching our calories,'' he said. He said diet soft
drinks are gaining ground in part because people like the taste and
because the soft drink makers are offering diet drinks in more
forms than ever.
   Counting all soft drinks sold by individual companies, Coca-Cola
commanded the biggest corporate share of the industry in 1989 with
41.1 percent, up from 40.5 percent a year earlier, the rankings
indicated.
   Pepsi-Cola was second in corporate share of the soft drink
business with 31.1 percent, up 0.4 percentage point from 1988.
   Dr Pepper-Seven Up ranks a distant third with a 10 percent
corporate share of the market, according to the Beverage Digest
rankings. Cadbury Beverages was fourth at 3.1 percent and Royal
Crown was fifth at 2.8 percent.

   Coca-Cola Co. and Pepsi-Cola Co. increased their
shares of the U.S. soft drink business this year, outpacing the
industry's 4.5 percent growth, an industry analyst said Tuesday.
   Coca-Cola Classic, meanwhile, remained atop the list of the
best-selling soft drinks in the United States, according to Jesse
Meyers, publisher of the newsletter Beverage Digest.
   Meyers estimated industry sales reached $43.2 billion at retail
this year.
   According to Beverage Digest, Coca-Cola's entire line of products
captured 40.5 percent of the U.S. soft drink market this year, up
from 40.3 percent last year. The Pepsi-Cola line was second as its
market share increased to 30.7 percent from 30.2 percent.
   Volume increases at both companies exceeded the 4.5 percent
growth in overall U.S. soft drink sales, Meyers said.
   Atlanta-based Coca-Cola's volume rose between 5 percent and 5.1
percent, while volume at Pepsi-Cola, based in Somers, N.Y., rose
between 6.3 percent and 6.4 percent, according to preliminary
figures from Beverage Digest.
   Dr Pepper's entire line gained market share as it retained its
No. 3 position with 5.6 percent of the market, up from 5.4 percent a
year earlier.
   Fouth-ranked Seven-Up's corporate share of the market fell to 4.9
percent from 5.3 percent a year earlier, while fifth-ranked Royal
Crown Cola Co.'s share fell to 2.7 percent from 2.9 percent.
   Meyers said A&amp;W Brands demonstrated it is ``the hot, second-tier
soft drink company'' as it moved up to sixth place from seventh
among the soft drink makers.
   A&amp;W, which has expanded its line beyond its A&amp;W Root Beer base,
increased its corporate share to 2 percent from 1.6 percent share a
year ago.
   Among the individual brands, Coca-Cola Classic remains the
nation's most popular soft drink and continues to gain market share,
Meyers said.
   Coca-Cola Classic boosted its market share from 19.8 percent last
year to 20.1 percent this year, while No. 2 Pepsi's share slipped
from an 18.8 percent share in 1987 to 18.7 percent this year, Meyers
said.
   In 1985, Coca-Cola discontinued the drink in favor of a new
formulation, but quickly brought it back under the name Coca-Cola
Classic in response to what it said was consumer demand.
   ``Everybody should make such mistakes,'' Meyers said in a
telephone interview from Greenwich, Conn., where he publishes
Beverage Digest.
   Other leading brands, as tabulated by Beverage Digest, are: Diet
Coke, 8.2 percent; Diet Pepsi, 5.2 percent; Dr Pepper, 4.5 percent;
Sprite, 3.6 percent; Mountain Dew, 3.2 percent; Seven-Up, 3.1
percent; and Caffeine-free Diet Coke, 2 percent.
   There was a three-way tie for 10th place as RC Cola, reformulated
Coke and Caffeine-free Diet Pepsi each had 1.4 percent of the market.

<HEAD>Test of Coke II Adds New Name to Soft Drink `Megabrand'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the beginning, there was Coca-Cola.
   But these days, store shelves are stocked with Coca-Cola, Coke
Classic, caffeine-free Coke Classic, caffeine-free Coke, diet Coke,
caffeine-free diet Coke, Cherry Coke and diet Cherry Coke.
   And last week, officials of the Atlanta-based soft drink maker
confirmed that Coca-Cola, also known as new Coke, may be renamed
Coke II. The newly named version will be test marketed later this
year.
   If Coke II catches on, there will no longer be a drink called
simply Coca-Cola.
   As incredible as that may seem, given the enormous power and
recognition of the Coca-Cola brand name, Coke spokesman Randy
Donaldson said, ``It's not a big deal to us.''
   Donaldson rejected the notion that there would be no more
Coca-Cola if Coke II takes off.
   ``We disagree,'' he said. ``There would be eight products with
Coca-Cola in the name.''
   Ever since the 1982 introduction of diet Coke, Coca-Cola has
pursued the so-called ``megabrand'' concept of marketing its soft
drinks. That approach intensified after the 1985 introduction of
the reformulated new Coke, and the consumer firestorm that resulted
in the return of the original formula (now called Coke Classic).
   Instead of selling one flagship brand, store shelves are crammed
with a large family of Coke products. Coca-Cola's main competitor,
Purchase, N.Y.-based Pepsico Inc., has adopted a similar approach:
there currently are seven products with Pepsi Cola in the name.
   The numbers say the concept works, according to Jesse Meyers,
publisher of the industry newsletter Beverage Digest.
   In 1985, Meyers said, all Coke products held 38.8 percent of the
U.S. soft drink market; Pepsi's had 29.2 percent. Five years later,
the Coke line _ including those, such as Sprite, that do not have
``Coca-Cola'' in the name _ has increased to 41.1 percent and Pepsi
to 31.1 percent.
   ``Let me put that in perspective,'' Meyers said. ``Each
(percentage) point is worth $444 million at retail.''
   According to Donaldson, sales of products with the ``Coca-Cola''
name account for 33 percent of the soft drink market. In 1981,
original Coca-Cola, then the only product with Coke in its name,
had a 25 percent market share, he said.
   ``The segmentation in the market has taken place because the
consumers have said they wanted it,'' he said.
   Donaldson said it is less important for there to remain a single
product merely called Coke than to put the brand name to its best
use by spreading it out.
   ``The strategy is to utilize the strongest trademark in the
world and give the consumers what they want, which is to say
caffeine-free, diet and cherry versions of our drink,'' Donaldson
said. ``The trademark is so strong that it clearly supports a wide
variety of products.''
   Some analysts, including Meyers, say a successful Coke II tryout
would pave the way for Coke Classic to drop the ``Classic'' from
its name. Coke Classic is the best-selling soft drink, and most
people who purchase it just call it Coke anyway.
   But Donaldson, who said one of the aims of the Coke II
experiment was to diminish confusion between Coca-Cola and Coke
Classic, denied such a move was being considered.
   Despite all the hoopla last week over the news about Coke II,
the name switch is not necessarily a sure thing, said Emanuel
Goldman, a soft drink industry analyst with Paine Webber Inc. in
San Francisco.
   ``They're going to tread gently,'' Goldman said, recalling the
now legendary backfire when the original Coca-Cola was replaced by
new Coke. ``They don't want to add insult to injury by doing
something wrong with new Coke.''
   Goldman said that although new Coke is a relatively weak seller
_ with 1.4 percent of the market compared to No. 1 Coke Classic's
20 percent _ it still generates about $621 million a year in retail
sales for the company.

   Coca-Cola Co. may be about to intensify the cola wars. 

   Coke said it will test market a caffeine-free version of its flagship brand, Coca-Cola Classic, beginning next week in Charlotte, N.C. Other, as yet unnamed, cities will follow. 
If all goes well, the product will be rolled out for national sales sometime next year, a Coke spokesman said. 

   After the confusion surrounding the change of the Coke formula in 1985, Coca-Cola was reluctant to clutter the Classic name with a brand extension. 
But now, the soft-drink giant appears willing to take the risk. 

   "The name Classic Coke has tremendous value, and they haven't merchandised that name before," says Jesse Meyers, publisher of the trade journal Beverage Digest. 

   The Coke spokesman said a caffeine-free Classic should help increase volume of the original brand. 
Indeed, analysts have said that the absence of new products, among other factors, has limited sales growth throughout the industry. 
Coke now leads Pepsi in market share in caffeine-free diet colas but trails Pepsi in sales of caffeine-free sugared colas, according to Beverage Digest. 

   Coke introduced a caffeine-free sugared cola based on its original formula in 1983. 
It switched to a caffeine-free formula using its new Coke in 1985. 

   Coke has been studying the possibility of introducing a caffeine-free Classic for a year, a company spokesman said. 
He said large increases in sales of other non-caffeine soft drinks make the timing right now.

   Coffee, tea or Pepsi? 

   Next month, Pepsi-Cola Co. will begin test-marketing in the Midwest Pepsi A.M., an extra-caffeine version of its flagship soft drink. 

   The market test will be a change from archrival Coca-Cola Co.'s less-aggressive approach to the morning market. 
For the past three years, Coke has been running advertisements -- only on radio and only in selected cities -- in a bid to boost morning consumption. 
But it has refused to position its soda as a direct competitor to coffee. 
And Pepsi, itself, has tried similar low-key promotional tie-ins with Dunkin' Donuts Inc. and Wendy's International Inc. 

   "There's been resistance to taking things too quickly," says Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark Inc., a Los Angeles beverage consulting firm. 
"No one wants to take on the mothers of America standing united to be sure their kids drink juice and milk every morning." 

   But in the most direct assault on coffee yet, Pepsi will advertise Pepsi A.M. on television as a "cold, refreshing alternative to coffee," says a spokesman. 
And for those coffee drinkers looking for their morning dose of caffeine, Pepsi A.M. will offer more of the stimulant than in regular Pepsi. 
The amount will be about one-quarter the caffeine level of coffee, the spokesman adds. 
He declined to say where in the Midwest Pepsi A.M. would be test-marketed or to provide further details of the market test. 

   Both Coke and PepsiCo Inc.'s Pepsi are attracted to the sunny growth potential of the morning market. 
Coca-Cola soft drinks consumed in the morning, for example, now account for 13% of the company's total sales, up from 9% a dozen years ago. 
Coffee consumption, meanwhile, has steadily declined since its peak year of 1962. 

   "The coffee part of the phrase 'coffee break' is clearly heading for extinction," says Jesse Meyers, publisher of Beverage Digest, a trade newsletter. 
Although soft drinks aren't yet appearing with many plates of bacon and eggs around the country, soda companies have made some inroads into the morning market. 
That's partly because of the less-effective marketing techniques of tea and coffee makers, some in the beverage industry say. 
In addition, soda companies have taken advantage of a shift in society's tastes to cold and sweet drinks from hot and bitter beverages. 

   Moreover, if Pepsi A.M. takes off and promotes a new category for growth, it could benefit the entire soft-drink industry, whose sales growth has been a bit sluggish. 
In the past when the volume of cola sales has slowed, the industry has rejuvenated itself with new product lines, such as diet and caffeine-free sodas. 

   Coca-Cola's "Coke in the Morning" campaign was started by a bottler in Atlanta, but has since spread to bottlers whose operations represent about 40% of the soda giant's domestic market. 
"The A.M. part of the day is the least developed in terms of soft-drink consumption," says a Coca-Cola spokesman, adding: "We're keeping all our options open." 

   Pepsi isn't the first company to boost caffeine content in an effort to generate sales. 
Jolt Co. introduced a cola several years ago with double the caffeine of regular sodas -- a level, it isn't shy about noting, that is just under the maximum allowed by the Food and Drug Administration. 

   Jolt Cola made a big splash when it was launched, but it still has failed to generate a market share of even 1% of total soft-drink sales. 
Jolt also addressed its soft drink to a morning audience using the pitch, "Jolt. 
Your Wake-Up Call." 

   C.J. Rapp, founder of Jolt, says he believes the introduction of Pepsi A.M. "certainly tells us we were right all along." 
But a Pepsi spokesman responds that Pepsi A.M. "is not Jolt. 
That was a novelty." 

   "Jolt turned out to be a little trendy," says Michael Bellas, president of Beverage Marketing Corp. "Whether {higher-caffeine sodas} will hit a viable nerve is still up for debate."

   Aging, and expanding, baby boomers are turning
more often to low-calorie drinks and Coca-Cola Co. is bidding for
their taste buds by pitting its chief diet soda against rival
Pepsi-Cola's flagship sugared brand.
   The marketing move is the first time a major cola company has
aimed a diet drink directly at a leading non-diet competitor, and
has sparked an escalation of the war for dominance of the giant soft
drink market.
   Pepsi-Cola Co. today announced that it had signed a worldwide
sponsorship and advertising deal with pop star Madonna that will
include a major global ad campaign beginning next month and Pepsi
sponsorship of the singer's upcoming world tour.
   ``The diet segment is a big, growing segment, and as people get
older they tend more towards diet,'' said Emanuel Goldman, a
beverage industry analyst with the investment firm PaineWebber in
San Francisco.
   Jesse Meyers, publisher of industry newsletter Beverage Digest,
said the diet cola market grew 8.4 percent and sugared cola volume
rose 3.2 percent last year. He said diet drinks account for 25.2
percent of the $26 billion wholesale market.
   ``I believe that in the early 2010s, the diet market will be the
tail wagging the soft-drink dog,'' Meyers said.
   Goldman estimated it will take a generation before diet colas
outsell sugar colas.
   Coke and Pepsi recognized the trend last year, producing
commercials featuring prize fighters and football players that moved
away from past diet drink strategies targeting women.
   Coke's battle plan for Diet Coke was the first major marketing
excursion since Ira Herbert was named president of the company's
domestic operations last year.
   ``Diet Coke moving ahead of Pepsi is the next logical step in the
long-term trend,'' Herbert said in a statement announcing the
campaign.
   Coca-Cola _ whose Coca-Cola Classic is the nation's top-selling
brand _ announced its latest goal in the aftermath of a highly
visible advertising blitz during Sunday's Super Bowl telecast.
   The package included a ballyhooed three-dimensional spot for Diet
Coke and another new commercial featuring celebrities that included
actor and former Pepsi pitchman Don Johnson, a star of the
television show ``Miami Vice.''
   Pepsi contends Coke's claims ignore consumer propensity to buy by
price and not brand, and the No. 2 cola-maker had been expected to
mount its own counteroffensive.
   In addition to the Madonna signing, Pepsi won sponsorship of the
NFL player talent show that aired before the Super Bowl.
   The company in recent years has boosted its brands through
celebrity ads featuring Michael Jackson, David Bowie, Tina Turner
and Lionel Richie.
   Atlanta-based Coke gave no timetable for its goal of boosting
Diet Coke past Pepsi.
   ``We're not saying this is going to happen overnight or within
the next year or two. Granted, it's going to take some time,'' said
Coke USA spokesman Ron Coleman.
   Coke also claims that almost 2 million families stopped buying
regular Pepsi last year, and Coleman said more than a quarter of
them turned to Diet Coke.
   But Pepsi's McKenzie countered that half of all soft drink
consumers identify themselves as ``brand-switchers,'' meaning just
as many people switched from Coke as from Pepsi.
   Goldman backed up McKenzie, saying, ``People don't just drink one
soft drink; people do mess around.''
   Besides the new television commercials, Coke said its campaign
will include 200 million national magazine and newspaper coupons and
local sweepstakes offering airline tickets and other prizes.
   Whether Coke's plan succeeds is almost irrelevant, Meyers said.
   ``I believe that Coke believes that statistical reality is not as
important as the perception of pitting the number three brand
against the number two brand, because it finesses the number one
position for Coke Classic,'' he said.
   According to Meyers, Coca-Cola Classic topped all brands last
year with 20.1 percent of domestic sales. Pepsi was second with 18.7
percent, followed by Diet Coke at 8.2 percent and Diet Pepsi at 5.2
percent.
   Diet Coke was the fastest growing brand, gaining 0.5 percent of a
share compared with a year ago. Caffeine-free Diet Coke added 0.3
percent to reach 2 percent overall, good for ninth place.
   Together, Diet Coke and caffeine-free Diet Coke accounted for
10.2 percent of the market, Meyers said. Pepsi and caffeine-free
Pepsi had 19.5 percent, while Diet Pepsi and caffeine-free Diet
Pepsi were at 6.6 percent, he said.

   New Coke is 4 years old and an also-ran in the
cola wars, but Coca-Cola Co. says there's plenty of fizz left in
the beverage that helped revolutionize the marketing of soft drinks.
   Coca-Cola was the world's most popular soft drink and more. The
brand had become a symbol of the pervasive influence of American
power and culture around the globe.
   So it was no small decision when the company decided to
reformulate the cola it had sold for 99 years. And it triggered no
small reaction. The consumer backlash to the new drink was so
strong that the company quickly brought back the original formula
under the name Coca-Cola Classic.
   Four years later, what goes by the label of Coke is virtually
ignored by consumers while Classic Coke reigns No. 1. But company
officials say they have no plans to drop the new formula, and
industry analysts say they're right.
   ``It's regarded as the absolute biggest marketing travesty ever
hoisted on the American public. With God's help, everyone will have
similar mistakes,'' said Jesse Meyers, who publishes Beverage
Digest in Greenwich, Conn.
   ``The announcement of new Coke gave new birth to all Coca-Cola
products and the entire soft drink industry,'' he said.
   The introduction of the new Coke heated up the ``cola wars,''
and saw companies step up their efforts to introduce new variations
of their name-brand products to gain a greater share of the $45
billion soft-drink market. Now there is not only Coke and Classic
Coke, but diet Coke, caffeine-free Coke and even regular and diet
Cherry Coke.
   Arch-rival Pepsico may regard the new Coke as a ``pretty nominal
player,'' but it believes a company's full product line is more
important than any single drink, said spokesman Todd MacKenzie.
   ``The parts make up the whole,'' MacKenzie said.
   Indeed, Coca-Cola emphasizes that its entire line of soft drinks
is strong and claims to hold a dominant 33.7 percent share of the
retail market.
   The brand name with the new formula that for years was the
best-seller had dropped to 10th place at the end of 1988, tied with
RC Cola and caffeine-free Diet Pepsi. The new Coke had a mere 1.4
percent of the market, down from 1.6 percent in 1987, according to
Beverage Digest.
   By contrast, Classic Coke _ the old Coke with the new name _
held the No. 1 position with 20.1 percent of the market. Pepsi Cola
was No. 2 with 18.7 percent.
   Even with its slim market share, the new Coke makes money and
generates $675 million a year in revenue, said Randy Donaldson, a
spokesman at the company's Atlanta headquarters.
   ``If Coca-Cola had any other name on it, it would be perceived
as a huge success,'' Donaldson said. ``Because the can has
`Coca-Cola' on it, the expectations were huge.''
   Emanuel Goldman, a soft drink industry analyst with Paine Webber
Inc. in San Francisco, said the new Coke still sold 4 billion cans
last year, which makes it unlikely the company would drop it.
   ``There are people still drinking it,'' he said. ``If they take
it away, they may go somewhere else.''
   Donaldson said taste tests continue to show consumers like new
Coke better than Pepsi.
   Improving the taste was behind the decision to alter the
formula, the company said when it announced the change in April
1985.
   The new Coke hit the stores on May 8 of that year, the 99th
anniversary of the date the first Coca-Cola was sold. But
notwithstanding test results, the backlash was swift and harsh from
consumers who resented the removal of a drink they had enjoyed for
generations.
   Two months later, Coca-Cola apologized to the public and brought
back the old formula as Classic Coke.
   ``There's no question it didn't work out as planned,'' Donaldson
said.
   Still, the bungling hasn't tarnished the vaunted brand name,
Meyers asserts.
   ``In the public's mind, what they call Coke is what the company
is Atlanta calls Coca-Cola Classic,'' he said.

   Maybe somebody should send Coke and Pepsi to
their rooms until they cool off.
   In the latest volley of the cola wars, Pepsi-Cola Co. is running
a new commercial tweaking Diet Coke's recent 3-D ads and disputing
claims about how many Pepsi drinkers are switching to Diet Coke.
   Coca-Cola Co. fired back, saying its campaign to position
third-ranked Diet Coke as a challenger to regular Pepsi's spot as
the nation's No. 2 soft drink ``apparently has set off a panic at
Pepsi.''
   ``We've struck a sensitive chord,'' said Michael A. Beindorff,
vice president for Atlanta-based Coca-Cola.
   That's not the way Pepsi sees it. Spokesman Tod MacKenzie said
late Friday it appeared that Pepsi's new ads scored ``a solid right
to the corporate chin'' with its ads attacking the credibility of
Coke's claims.
   Pepsi has complained about Coke's ad claims to the three major
television networks, which are reviewing them. Coca-Cola says it
plans to complain to the networks about Pepsi's new ad, which began
running Thursday night.
   Jesse Meyers, publisher of the trade newsletter Beverage Digest,
said the attention that the two soft drink giants are paying to
their diet colas illustrates the growing importance of the diet
segment of the $43 billion retail soda market as the population ages
and becomes more weight conscious.
   Diet Coke started the latest exchange with commercials on last
month's broadcast of the Super Bowl football game that took the
unusual approach of going against regular Pepsi rather than Diet
Pepsi.
   ``Last year, nearly two million families stopped buying Pepsi and
more of them moved to Diet Coke than any other major soft drink,''
the ads say.
   The campaign theme is ``The move is on to Diet Coke'' and the ads
employ ``Miami Vice'' star Don Johnson, an ex-Pepsi pitchman, to
reinforce the point.
   The ads attracted heightened attention because they first aired
in connection with Coke's sponsorship of the Super Bowl halftime
show, the first live network broadcast in three-dimensions.
Coca-Cola bottlers distributed about 20 million pairs of special
glasses so viewers could get the 3-D effect in both the show and an
ad for Diet Coke.
   Pepsi said Coca-Cola's claim was misleading because millions of
families switch to other brands every year, and asked the networks
to pull the ads or demand modifications.
   According to the trade newsletter Beverage Digest, Pepsi's market
share fell 0.1 percentage point to 18.7 percent in 1988, while Diet
Coke and its caffeine-free version rose to 10.2 percent from 9.4
percent in 1987 and Diet Pepsi and its caffeine-free version rose to
6.6 percent from 6.1 percent.
   Pepsi also developed an ad that it began airing Thursday on
network TV.
   It shows a man making a presentation in a boardroom, his back to
the camera as he gestures at a chart that shows Diet Coke sales
rising.
   As the presentation proceeds, a narrator says, ``Last year, two
million families stopped buying Diet Coke and over a million new
families started buying Diet Pepsi. So what's giving Diet Coke such
a distorted view?''
   The answer becomes obvious, as the man turns toward the camera,
wearing 3-D glasses. ``Gentlemen, I trust we are all seeing this the
same way,'' he said as viewers see the other executives are also
wearing the 3-D glasses.
   Meyers said there are elements of truth in both campaigns. Diet
Coke's market share closed the lead on regular Pepsi last year, he
said. But by some measures, he said Diet Pepsi has grown more
rapidly than Diet Coke.
   But, he added, ``You can't have `cola wars' without skirmishes.''

<TEXT>
   The first shipments of a caffeine-free version of
Coca-Cola Classic, the drink that appeared following the ``new
Coke'' uproar five years ago, will begin hitting stores this week.
   The nationwide rollout follows a successful market tryout in 10
cities, Coca-Cola USA officials said Thursday. Spokesman Bob
Bertini said the new product should be available across the nation
by the end of the month.
   An advertising campaign with the slogan, ``It's the real thing
... only caffeine free,'' also is under way, Bertini said.
   Caffeine-free Coke Classic is the Atlanta-based soft drink
company's fourth caffeine-free version of an existing product.
There are already caffeine-free versions of Coca-Cola, diet Coke
and Tab.
   ``The caffeine-free cola segment is one of the fastest growing
in the soft drink industry,'' Bertini said. Coke's best-selling
caffeine-free product is Caffeine-free diet Coke, which currently
has a 7.8 percent market share.
   Bertini said the appearance of caffeine-free Coke Classic did
not mean the company was giving up on Caffeine-free Coca-Cola,
which is a companion to the ``new Coke,'' that was introduced in
1985 to a wave of consumer complaints over the disappearance of the
original formula Coke.
   The company subsequently brought back the original formula under
the Coke Classic label, which became the nation's No. 1 soft drink
and overwhelmingly outsold new Coke.
   Caffeine-free Coke similarly has been a relatively weak
performer. Bertini said it has a ``very small share'' of the market.

   After a year of test-marketing a high-caffeine
soft drink, Pepsi-Cola Co. evidently has woken up and smelled the
coffee.
   The No. 2 beverage maker behind Coca-Cola Co. says it has
stopped testing its extra-kick Pepsi A.M., although Pepsi will
continue to test a marketing strategy aimed at luring coffee
drinkers to its regular cola in the morning.
   Pepsi-Cola had begun testing Pepsi A.M. in August 1989 in
Waterloo, Iowa, but decided to discontinue the beverage this past
August, company spokeswoman Leigh Curtin said Monday. There are no
immediate plans to brink the drink back.
   ``What we found from the test was we didn't need to reformulate
our product for consumers to enjoy it in the morning,'' Curtin
said.
   Pepsi A.M. had about 25 percent more caffeine than regular
Pepsi. The compny wanted to see if the added jolt would attract
coffee drinkers, but sales proved slow and some Iowa consumers said
the beverage tasted flat.
   While the test has ended, Pepsi has not given up on converting
coffee drinkers to its soft drinks in the morning, said another
Pepsi spokeswoman, Rebecca Madeira.
   She said a promotional test begun in August 1989 in Fort Wayne,
Ind., is continuing using the slogan ``Pepsi in the Morning'' for
its regular cola.
   Coca-Cola also has used periodic promotions in some markets that
pitched its regular soft drinks for consumption in the morning.
   Industry experts say the percentage of soft drinks consumed in
the morning has risen to 15 percent of all soda sales from 10
percent a decade ago, an important increase because each 1 percent
share of the market represents more than $400 million in retail
sales.
   Coffee consumption, meanwhile, has shown signs of declining,
though it remains one of the prevalent wakeup beverages in the
country.
   ``We think there is a lot of potential there to expand,'' Ms.
Madeira said.

<TEXT>
   Soft drink giants Coca-Cola Co. and Pepsi-Cola
Co. each claimed Thursday they had been vindicated by the television
networks in their latest advertising spat.
   Coca-Cola said it agreed to make what it called ``two minor
alterations'' in its new ads that claim a ``move is on'' from
regular Pepsi to Diet Coke.
   The Atlanta-based company said the revised campaign would
continue to air on network television.
   ``Diet Coke wins again,'' the company said.
   But Pepsi-Cola, which had complained to the networks that the
Diet Coke spot was false and misleading, said the requested
alterations represented ``fundamental changes.''
   ``They called a foul against Coke ... We are overjoyed,'' said
Tod MacKenzie, a spokesman for Pepsi in Somers, N.Y.
   At the same time, Pepsi said it had voluntarily withdrawn its ad
that poked fun at how Coca-Cola came up with its claims, showing
executives poring over soft drink statistics while wearing
distorting 3D glasses.
   MacKenzie said its ad was aired only as an interim measure while
the networks reviewed its complaint abot the Diet Coke ads.
   In the original series of ads launched in late January, Coca-Cola
took the unusual step of positioning Diet Coke against the sugared
version of Pepsi.
   ``Last year, nearly two million families stopped buying Pepsi and
more of them moved to Diet Coke than any other major soft drink,''
the Diet Coke ads said.
   After a review by the networks, Coca-Cola said it agreed to
change the second part of its claim to say, ``... and about a half
million of them moved to Diet Coke.''
   Coca-Cola also agreed to indicate on the screen the name of the
research company that came up with the data supporting its claim and
note that it includes both Diet Coke and caffeine-free Diet Coke.

   The soft drink makers are recruiting some tough
characters for commercials designed to convince men that it's okay
to drink diet colas.
   This summer it was boxer Mike Tyson in commercials for Diet
Pepsi. This fall, it will be a few dozen pro football players for
Diet Coke.
   It's a new approach for sugarless sodas, a majority of which
have traditionally been consumed by women.
   A decade ago, the soft drink makers say, women consumed about 75
percent of the diet soft drinks purchased. Atlanta-based Coca-Cola
USA said that percentage has since fallen to about 65 percent.
   Nonetheless, Michael Beindorff, vice president of advertising
for Coca-Cola, said a big block of men remains ``averse to diet
soft drinks.''
   He hopes to change that attitude with a campaign that begins
Monday, and will eventually feature players from every National
Football League team in local print and broadcast ads for diet Coke.
   The first commercial airs during the season's first Monday Night
Football telecast on ABC matching the Washington Redskins and the
New York Giants.
   In the ad, Redskins linemen Charles Mann and Dave Butz toss a
quarterback rather than a coin to decide who gets the last Diet
Coke during practice.
   Additional ads will appear locally during the season. In some
cases, players will appear in versions of an ad adapted for local
use.
   For instance, Beindorff said one local ad will show three
players from a team with a tiger, a bear or some other team symbol.
   As the camera pans over them, the announcer will say ``three out
of four (Bengals or Bears or whatever) prefer'' Diet Coke.
   Jesse Meyers, publisher of Beverage Digest, a trade publication
based in Greenwich, Conn., said soft drink sales rose about 4
percent last year to $40 billion, but that the diet segment has
been growing four to five times faster.
   His 1987 beverage rankings listed Diet Coke as the third best
selling soft drink behind Coca-Cola Classic and Pepsi with 7.7
percent of the market, and Diet Pepsi fourth with 4.8 percent.
   Meyers gives Pepsi ``high marks for clearly identifying the male
image'' with its ads that featured Tyson, who defended his
heavyweight title and said Diet Pepsi did too in taste tests
against Diet Coke.
   Beindorff said the new diet Coke ads were in development long
before the Tyson ads ran. While he would not disclose how much they
cost, he said the fees for all the football players will come to
only a fraction of the $1.25 million he said Pepsi reportedly paid
Tyson.

   Didn't like new Coke? Try Coke II. The taste
promises to be the same.
   The Coca-Cola Co., which learned the hard way about consumer
loyalty when it changed the formula of Coke five years ago,
apparently isn't worried about tinkering with the product that
replaced it.
   The company said Tuesday it will try changing the name of new
Coke to Coke II in an attempt to bolster sales of the product that
in 1985 replaced the world's best-selling soft drink and sparked a
consumer revolt.
   Randy Donaldson, spokesman for Atlanta-based Coke, said the
formula of new Coke will not be altered and that no changes are
planned for Coca-Cola Classic, the name for the restored original
formula.
   Donaldson said Coke II will be test marketed initially in one
city, which he would not identify.
   ``After five years, new Coke is no longer new, though it's still
called new Coke,'' he said. ``We just want to make it easier to
distinguish between Coke II and Coke Classic.''
   Soft drink industry analysts speculated that if the change to
Coke II is adopted, the brand name Coca-Cola could be returned to
the best-selling Coke Classic. Coke officials denied such a name
change was being considered.
   Jesse Meyers, who publishes the Greenwich, Conn., industry
newsletter Beverage Digest, said the Coke II test meant Coca-Cola
was ``taking off the gloves'' in its cola war with rival Pepsi Cola.
   ``They've had a namby-pamby approach to new Coke vs. Pepsi,''
Meyers said. ``They're going from namby-pamby to the machine guns.''
   Recent Coke advertising has pitted diet Coke, rather than the
sugared new Coke or Coca-Cola Classic, against Pepsi. Meyers said
the Coke II test indicates a plan to match the newer product
against Pepsi Cola.
   Meyers said the proposed packaging for Coke II has a red, white
and blue design with blue lettering that closely resembles that of
Pepsi. But Donaldson said that unlike Pepsi the Coke II can has a
red background with white letters and a blue outline.
   Coca-Cola announced in April 1985 that after extensive taste
tests it was changing the formula of Coke, the world's best-selling
soft drink. Consumer reaction was so strong against the new product
that the company two months later apologized and brought back the
original formula under the name Coca-Cola Classic.
   Coke Classic regained the position as the No. 1 soft drink. The
sweeter-tasting new Coke also remained, but its market share now is
1.4 percent compared to Coke Classic's 20 percent.
   Second-ranked Pepsi had an 18.3 percent market share, according
to Beverage Digest's 1989 year-end figures.
   Emanuel Goldman, who follows the soft drink industry for
PaineWebber Inc. in San Francisco, said the Coke II label, if
chosen, would remove the perception that new Coke is a failure.
   ``You don't want something called Coca-Cola that doesn't work,
so you call it Coke II,'' Goldman said. ``I think it's not such a
bad thing to do. The name of the game is Coca-Cola.''
   Meyers said the proposed changes could lead the company to
change Coke Classic back to Coca-Cola. ``The name Coke Classic may
be on the way out,'' he said.
   Donaldson said the change to Coke II would not leave the company
without a product called simply Coca-Cola. He said the company had
several products incorporating the name.
   Pepsi spokesman Tod MacKenzie said Coke's so-called
``megabrand'' concept could backfire.
   ``It raises some questions in our minds. ... At what point does
this megabrand confuse consumers?'' MacKenzie said. ``How does the
consumer keep track?''
   Pepsi has maintained that new Coke was an attempt to make a
drink that tastes more like Pepsi Cola. ``Whether it's Coke II or
new new Coke, it's another validation of Coke's interest in the
great taste of Pepsi,'' MacKenzie said from Pepsi headquarters in
Purchase, N.Y.

   New Coke, the reformulated, sweeter version of
Coca-Cola that inspired a consumer rebellion before sinking to the
bottom tier of soft drink sales, is trying out a new name and a
different look, its maker said Tuesday.
   Coca-Cola Co. said it plans to test market new Coke under the
name Coke II. Spokesman Randy Donaldson said Coke II would be sold
initially in one city, which he would not identify, within the next
few months.
   The formula of the newly named drink will not be changed,
Donaldson said.
   Industry observers speculated that if the new name was adopted,
the company could return the Coca-Cola brand name to the original
formula, now called Coke Classic.
   Jesse Meyers, the Greenwich, Conn., publisher of the industry
newsletter Beverage Digest, said the Coke II test marks the first
big shot of the 1990s in the cola wars between Coca-Cola and
archrival Pepsi Cola.
   Meyers said he has seen the proposed packaging for Coke II, and
its red, white and blue design with blue lettering closely
resembles that of Pepsi. Coke's Donaldson said the Coke II can is
red, white and blue, but unlike Pepsi it has a red background with
white letters and a blue outline.
   The Coke II test comes as new Coke, regarded by some as one of
the great blunders in marketing history, nears its fifth
anniversary.
   Atlanta-based Coca-Cola announced in April 1985 that after
extensive taste tests it was changing the formula of Coke, the
world's best-selling soft drink. Consumer reaction against the new,
sweeter-tasting product was so strong that the company two months
later apologized and brought back the original formula under the
name Coca-Cola Classic.
   Coke Classic regained the position as the No. 1 soft drink. New
Coke also remained, but its market share now is a relatively tiny
1.4 percent compared to Coke Classic's 20 percent share.
   Coke officials always have maintained that new Coke, despite its
Coca-Cola label, essentially is a new product and that its sales
should be judged in that respect.
   Donaldson denied that the Coke II test means the company is
running up the white flag on new Coke.
   ``After five years, new Coke is no longer new, though it's still
called new Coke,'' he said. ``We just want to make it easier to
distinguish between Coke II and Coke Classic.''
   And he said there are no plans to change the name of Coca-Cola
Classic back to Coca-Cola. ``There are no plans to change anything
about Coke Classic at all,'' he said.
   But Meyers, a respected observer of the soft drink industry
said, ``The name Coke Classic may be on the way out.''
   Emanuel Goldman, who follows the soft drink industry for Paine
Webber Inc. in San Francisco, said the Coke II label, if adopted,
would remove the perception that new Coke is a failure.
   Coca-Cola is ``the premier brand name in the world,'' he said.
   ``You don't want something called Coca-Cola that doesn't work,
so you call it Coke II,'' Goldman said. ``I think it's not such a
bad thing to do. The name of the game is Coca-Cola.''
   Pepsi spokesman Tod MacKenzie called the Coke II test an
acknowledgement by Coke that Pepsi was a superior product.
   ``Whether it's Coke II or new new Coke, it's another validation
of Coke's interest in the great taste of Pepsi,'' MacKenzie said
from his office in Purchase, N.Y.
   ``This isn't the first time they've tried to imitate us, and it
likely won't be the last,'' he said.
   Coke's recent advertising has pitted diet Coke, rather than
Coca-Cola or Coke Classic, against Pepsi.
   Meyers said he expected Coca-Cola now wants to position Coke II
against its competitor.
   ``They've had a very subtle approach,'' he said. ``If this
approach works, they'll go to a gross all-out attack.''

   The opening bell has sounded in the 1988 summer cola fight, with Coca-Cola Co. trying to KO a new Diet Pepsi commercial featuring boxer Mike Tyson. 

   The ad is scheduled to premiere on television tonight just before Mr. Tyson and Michael Spinks duke it out in Atlantic City, N.J., for the heavyweight championship title. 
But Coke is furious about the commercial's claim that recently reformulated Diet Pepsi beat Diet Coke decisively in consumer taste tests. 
It has filed protests with the three major broadcast networks, challenging the Diet Pepsi claim and arguing that Coke's own research shows Diet Coke continues to wallop Diet Pepsi in taste tests. 

   The networks are still studying the complaint, but appear inclined to run the Diet Pepsi commercial, at least for now. 
"Generally, we don't entertain challenges before a commercial airs," says Rick Gitter, the East Coast vice president of broadcast standards for NBC-TV. 
"We told Coke we'd be happy to consider the challenge after the spot runs." 

   In the contested spot, Mr. Tyson, the reigning heavyweight champ, answers questions at a news conference and poses with "the other champion," a can of Diet Pepsi. 
The boxer says in the commercial that he doesn't mind sharing the champion title as long as he doesn't have to share his Diet Pepsi. 

   Pepsi-Cola Co., a unit of PepsiCo, says the commercial will reach more than 500 million people in 90 countries. 
It is slated to run on all three major broadcast networks and during the international closed-circuit telecast of the fight. 
Diet Pepsi also is the exclusive sponsor of the boxing match. 
According to soft-drink industry sources, the Tyson commercial and other marketing activities tied to the boxing sponsorship will cost Pepsi about $4 million. 

   "Pepsi is being very aggressive because diet products are the fastest growing part of the soft-drink market," says Jesse Meyers, publisher of the newsletter Beverage Digest. 
"Diet drinkers consume five to six times as many soft drinks as people who prefer sugared products." 

   Diet Coke's sales far outpace Diet Pepsi's, and Pepsi hopes its new flavor and taste-test findings will help narrow the gap. 
According to Beverage Digest, Diet Coke had a 10.1% share of supermarket sales of soft drinks in April, compared with 9.6% the year before. 
Diet Pepsi's share rose to 6.9% from 6.6% a year earlier. 

   The Tyson ad marks the first time Pepsi has bragged that Diet Pepsi outscored Diet Coke in taste tests. 
According to Pepsi, consumers preferred Diet Pepsi 55% to 45%. 

   Carlton Curtis, a Coke spokesman, declines to comment on whether Coke will run a commercial touting Diet Coke as the real taste-test victor. 
"Wait for round two," he says. 

   Whose taste tests are correct? 
Possibly both of them. 
Taste testing is notoriously inexact, and conflicting results may result simply from different research techniques. 
Consumers' responses can be influenced by such factors as what time of day the test is given, how hungry or thirsty people are, how questions are phrased and even how the test samples of the competing brands are numbered. 

   While Pepsi has Mr. Tyson in its corner, Coke has another media star waiting in the wings to plug Diet Coke: Roger Rabbit, the animated character from the new cartoon-and-live action movie "Who Framed Roger Rabbit." 
Roger Rabbit, his cartoon wife, Jessica, and actor Bob Hoskins all will appear in a Diet Coke commercial starting July 4 on NBC. 

   By then, the controversial Tyson commercial may be moot. 
If Mr. Tyson should lose to Mr. Spinks, Pepsi probably wouldn't want to run it again. 
"We have some ideas on what we might do in the unlikely event Tyson loses, but I can't disclose anything," says Pepsi spokesman Tod MacKenzie. 
"But no matter what the outcome in Atlantic City, we will still say that Diet Pepsi is the undisputed champion."

<HEAD>Burger King Switches to Coca-Cola from Pepsi-Cola</HEAD>

   Sometime this summer, a Burger King customer may
leave an opening for a quick-witted clerk by simply ordering
``Cheeseburger, Pepsi.''
   ``No Pepsi, Coke,'' the order-taker will be able to say, in a
variation on the line that the late comedian John Belushi made
famous years ago.
   Burger King Corp., the nation's second-largest hamburger chain,
said Tuesday it is switching to Coca-Cola Co. as its official
domestic soft drink supplier, ending an association that started in
1983 with Pepsi-Cola Co.
   Miami-based Burger King said Coca-Cola products such as
Coca-Cola Classic, Diet Coke, Sprite and Minute Maid orange soda
will replace Pepsi-Cola's soft drink lineup in its restaurants over
the next three months.
   Analysts said the loss of the high-profile account is a blow to
Pepsi-Cola's prestige, but it would have minimal impact on earnings
for either soft-drink company.
   Pepsi-Cola, based in Somers, N.Y., said the loss of the Burger
King account ``was not entirely unexpected'' in view of recent
management changes at Burger King. It was acquired by the British
conglomerate Grand Metropolitan PLC in January 1989 and switched
advertising agencies last year.
   ``We selected Coca-Cola because of its ability to provide a
powerful mix of global brand strength, state-of-the-art
technological capabilities and distinctive service,'' Burger King
Chief Executive Barry J. Gibbons said.
   Atlanta-based Coca-Cola controls an estimated 65 percent of the
fountain portion of the U.S. soft drink business and is the primary
supplier for most of the major fast-food chains, including leader
McDonald's Corp.
   Recently, Wendy's International Inc. said it was planning to
switch to Coca-Cola at its 1,100 company-owned restaurants when its
agreement with Pepsi-Cola expires at the end of the year.
   Pepsi-Cola still has some major restaurant accounts, including
Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken, all owned by its
parent, PepsiCo Inc. It also serves the Dunkin' Donuts, Subway,
Shakey's and Ground Round chains, according to spokesman Tod
MacKenzie.
   MacKenzie said Pepsi hopes to continue serving franchisee-owned
Burger King restaurants. But Burger King spokeswoman Cori Zywotow
said her company's franchise agreements require licensees to go
along with its choice of a soft drink supplier.
   There are about 5,400 Burger King restaurants in the United
States, including 800 owned by Burger King and 4,600 owned by
franchisees.
   Neither Burger King nor Coca-Cola would estimate the value of
the soft-drink account.
   Burger King awarded its soft drink account to Pepsi-Cola in 1983
after years with Coca-Cola, and reaffirmed its intention to stay
with Pepsi only last June.
   But Ms. Zywotow said both soft drink companies were asked for
new proposals recently and the company decided to switch. She said
Coca-Cola will work with Burger King on new drink dispensing
technology and marketing programs.
   Emanuel Goldman, who follows the soft drink business for
PaineWebber in San Francisco, estimated Pepsi-Cola sales at Burger
King amounted to about 65 million cases, or about 13.5 percent of
Pepsi's annual fountain volume. The switch would boost Coca-Cola's
fountain volume by 6.5 percent, he said.
   Goldman said the switch should cut annual earnings of PepsiCo by
no more than a penny a share, while adding 1.5 cents a share at
most for Coca-Cola.
   But in addition to lost sales volume, the switch costs Pepsi a
valuable opportunity to have people to sample its products.
   ``A lot of people go into Burger King and see the name Coke or
Pepsi. How does that spill over into supermarket sales? That is the
part of it that isn't known,'' Goldman said.
   Jesse Meyers, editor of the trade publication Beverage Digest,
estimates the switch could add a percentage point to Coca-Cola's
40.5 percent share of the overall U.S. soft drink market while
cutting Pepsi-Cola's 30.7 percent share by the same amount. The
market is valued at $27.4 billion wholesale.
   Meyers said Burger King's decision to switch may be a response
to the recent rapid growth of PepsiCo's restaurant operations.
   ``While PepsiCo is selling chicken, tacos and pizza, Burger King
is saying `That competes with the share of stomach we are trying to
fill,''' he said.
   Pepsi's MacKenzie said there is ``more myth than reality'' to
that line of reasoning.

Passions Heating Up
As the Summer Nears;
Is Headroom Passe?

   There is death. 
There are taxes. 
Then there are the Cola Wars, which are just as hard to avoid and which some people take just as seriously. 

   Passions have heated up on both sides of the battle line as the all-important summer soft-drink offensive approaches. 
Both Coke and Pepsi are launching taste tests -- at county fairs, ocean beaches and shopping malls -- to prove the superiority of their products. 
More vigorously than ever, they are sniping at each other's advertising, each trying to make the other taboo among teen-agers. 

   Yet, fundamentally, not much has changed. 
Coca-Cola Co. (with about 40% of the entire soft-drink market at the end of 1986, according to Beverage Digest) is still No. 1 by a large margin. 
Pepsi, with about 30% of the market, cultivates its image as the feisty, daring young upstart. 
Unit sales were up about 7% for each last year, says John C. Maxwell Jr., analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz &amp; Birney. 

   Still, every day is war. 
Every day, 36.8 million soft drinks (can-sized ones) are drunk. 
Every day, as many as 50% (by Pepsi's count) of those soft-drink drinkers could go either way. (That is to say, they are not loyal to either Coke or Pepsi.) 
"That 50% in the middle is voting every day," says Michael Lorelli, senior vice president, marketing, for PepsiCo Inc.'s Pepsi-Cola USA subsidiary. 
"Winning," he says, "is everything." 

   Actually, the war itself is almost everything because it keeps soft drinks in the public eye, and probably has much to do with the fact that the average person drank 42.2 gallons of the stuff last year -- 1.4 gallons more than the year before. 

   Nevertheless, a report from the various cola-war fronts seems in order. 

   THE ADVERTISING FRONT: The much-touted new Michael Jackson commercials for Pepsi are still a no-show. 
"Music is art and art can't be rushed," says Mr. Lorelli. 
Although the commercials are in the can, Mr. Jackson hasn't finished his video to accompany a new album. 
Ideally, from the company's standpoint, the album should be climbing the charts as a backdrop to Pepsi's ads. 

   But Max Headroom shouldn't get too smug either. 
While Max helped propel Coke commercials to top place in Video Storyboard Tests Inc.'s 1986 annual viewer survey, he apparently didn't do much for them in this year's first quarter. 
The Coke commercials tumbled to No. 7 on the Video Storyboard list, which David Vadehra, president of that outfit, takes as a sign Max may be out of steam. 
Pepsi maintained its No. 5 position. 

   "That was our diet emphasis period," explains a Coke spokesman, insisting that, with the major soft-drink season still ahead, any predictions are premature. 

   THE IMAGE FRONT: The silver lining in new Coke's flop was a big boost to Coke's reputation. 
Bringing back the original Coke formula as Coca-Cola Classic in 1985 made the company a consumer hero. 
It was then that Coke jumped way ahead of Pepsi in popularity polls conducted internally by both companies. 
"Since the summer of 1985, there's been a tremendous resurgence of people coming into the fold, saying Coca-Cola is my favorite brand," says John Reid, senior vice president, marketing, for Coca-Cola USA. 
He says the phenomenon caused "a tremendous rebonding with our public." 

   Even Pepsi was impressed by what it calls the "halo effect." 
Says Ronald Tidmore, president and chief executive of Pepsi-Cola USA: "All of a sudden they were the good guys." 

   THE TASTE-TEST FRONT: To counter the halo effect, Pepsi is bringing back (Coke says dusting off) the Pepsi Challenge taste test, which will now be "America's Choice." 
Says Mr. Lorelli: "We believe the time is right to remind consumers what they voted on all along -- that Pepsi tastes better." 
Pepsi vigorously denies suggestions by Coke that it was forced to resurrect the old campaign in the absence of Michael Jackson. 
Says Pepsi's Mr. Tidmore with a knowing smile, "There's nothing the people in Atlanta hate more than the Challenge." 

   In Atlanta, Mr. Reid says that Pepsi must not have learned the lessons Coca-Cola did from new Coke: Taste tests are but a tiny part of Classic Coke's draw. 
"Coca-Cola Classic has a relationship with the consumer that goes so far beyond taste tests that it isn't even funny," he says. 

   But just in case there are some Pepsi drinkers out there who still think the issue relevant, Coke will pit new Coke against Pepsi in thousands of its own taste tests this summer. 

   THE NEW-PRODUCT FRONT: The sniping is vicious. 
Coca-Cola loves to point out that Lemon Lime Slice has been losing market share lately. 
And Pepsi never misses a chance to take aim at new Coke. 
"Its market share has the half-life of uranium," says Mr. Lorelli. 
"Every time I look, it's gotten smaller." (Coke insists new Coke, with 2.3% market share last year, is still an infant, and will be a potent force against Pepsi in the future.) 

   But perhaps the fiercest fighting has been over Jake's, Pepsi's new diet cola now in test markets. 
Pepsi hopes to attract cola drinkers who like the taste of regular cola, but want fewer calories. 
In soft-drink circles, this is a revolutionary concept. 

   Coke, however, wants to make sure that consumers don't think of Jake's as a diet cola, and it greeted Jake's with full-page newspaper ads saying just that. 
The ads pointed out that each can of Jake's contains nearly two teaspoons of sugar and it invites consumers to call Coke's toll-free consumer hot line for further clarification and some free Diet Coke. (Coke officials, who say they acted in the interests of consumers it feared would be misled, say that more than 9,100 people have called.) 

   Pepsi executives say they welcomed some free Jake's advertising. 
Mr. Lorelli says he believes the vigor of Coke's response is due to "fear and the threat of somebody attacking the crown jewels." 

   THE MARKET-SHARE FRONT: There are as many ways to analyze market share as bubbles in a pop can. 
But Coke shines in a lot of departments. 
According to Beverage Digest, Coke widened its lead over Pepsi in the total soft-drink market by half a percentage point last year. 
Classic (with 18.9%) breezed by Pepsi (with 18.5%) to top the soft-drink hit parade. 
In the world of soft-drink minutiae, all this counts and bolsters Coke's claims that it has regained that magical, all-important ingredient in the cola wars: momentum. 

   But you know what they say about statistics. 
Generally, Coke likes to play up its strongest suit: its showing in the total soft-drink market. 
Pepsi likes to talk up its strongest: its place in the food-store market -- significant, it says, because there consumers have a true vote. 

   Normally, Coke -- which has trailed Pepsi in sugar colas in food stores for most of a decade -- loves to emphasize that food stores are only about 43% of the whole story. 
But when Coke inched past Pepsi in that category in December and January for the first time in a decade, it temporarily changed its tune. 
It put out a news release announcing that its momentum in the soft-drink industry had "soared to new heights." 
When February and March rolled around, Coke was quiet. 
Pepsi had once again regained a slim lead. 

   THE STRATEGIC FRONT: No fancy stuff for Coca-Cola. 
"We're focused (on) cola, that's where we will continue to focus our efforts," says Edwin Mellett, president of Coca-Cola USA. 

   Pepsi takes a "broader beverage-portfolio approach," says Mr. Tidmore. 
Long-term growth, it believes, will come from new products like Slice or Jake's. 
It's risky, admits Mr. Tidmore, but "change works for us. 
The status quo is the best thing for Coke."

It all started in May 1886 when John Pemberton, a pharmacist in Atlanta,
Georgia, cooked up an unusually exhilarating brain tonic. Its stimulative
effects came mainly from two ingredients: the coca leaf of South America, a
source of cocaine, and the seeds of the cola tree of West Africa, a source
of caffeine. He called it Coca-Cola, and a legend was born.
Part of that legend rests on the mystique that surrounds the Coca-Cola
formula. According to company folklore, only two people within the Coca-Cola
empire know how to make Coke, and the only copy of the recipe is locked away
in a vault, unavailable to anyone in any circumstances except by a formal
vote of the board of directors.
This has not stopped people trying to work out the secret for themselves.
The cynic would say the formula is simple: one part sugared water to 99
parts hype. But piecing together the available information, it is possible
to pick up some clues as to the recipe.
In most countries, the basic ingredients are written on the side of the can
or bottle. The biggest two are water and sugar. Caramel gives the drink its
characteristic dark colour, and phosphoric acid gives it a tang. The
caffeine is still there, though in much smaller quantities than a century
ago. So are the coca leaves, but they have been decocainised.
The big secret lies in the so-called 7X portion of the formula - the part
listed as 'natural flavours' on the container. This comprises seven natural
oils. Six are thought to be orange, lemon, nutmeg, cinnamon, coriander and
neroli (from a variety of orange blossom). The seventh is lavender or lime,
according to which version you believe.
Knowing the list of ingredients, of course, is not the whole of the mystery:
you still have to know how to mix them. Undaunted by the secrecy, however,
people have been trying to imitate Coca-Cola since the day it went on to the
market. Pepsi-Cola's origins go back almost as far as Coca-Cola's: to 1894,
when Caleb Bradham, a North Carolina pharmacist, started selling a
cola-based drink containing pepsin as a tonic for the relief of dyspepsia.
Of the many smaller imitators worldwide, by far the most prominent today is
Royal Crown Cola, a Texas-based company formerly owned by the US financier,
Victor Posner, but last year taken over by a newly formed New York-based
conglomerate called Triarc.
RC Cola has been making and selling cola under its own name for decades, but
since 1991 it has had another sideline: supplying cola syrups to Cott, a
Canadian soft drinks company, which in turn uses them to make own-label
colas for supermarket chains.
These Cott-supplied colas are better packaged than earlier private-label
colas were. They also taste better: in conjunction with Cott, RC Cola has
developed new formulas to meet individual retailers' specifications. But do
they really taste anything like Coke or, for that matter, Pepsi?
First, it can be surprisingly hard to tell the difference. In the absence of
any independent consumer research on the subject, the FT's New York bureau
held a highly unscientific blind tasting of Coke, Pepsi and PC Cola (a
Cott-supplied private label). Of the six people who took part, only one
succeeded in singling out the interloper.
Second, who cares? History has shown that people do not buy Coke for its
flavour. In 1985, Coca-Cola took the extraordinary decision to abolish Coke
in the US and replace it with the smoother, sweeter New Coke, which had
consistently scored higher in blind tastings. The move was a disaster: the
US public said changing the taste of Coke was like burning the American
flag. Back came the old Coke, and it has been out-selling every other soft
drink since.

   Coke. Pepsi. A&amp;P Cola. Kroger's Big K Cola.
   One cola tastes just about as good as another, according
to Consumer Reports, the influential arbiter of product
quality in America. Thus, in a cover story sure to burst some
bubbles at Coke and Pepsi, Consumer Reports tells readers in
its current issue: Just buy the cheapest cola you can.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   After conducting its own rather inexact blind taste test
on magazine staffers, Consumer Reports found that only seven
of 19 self-proclaimed Coke or Pepsi fans could pick their
preferred drink from unidentified samples. Diet sippers did
worse, with only seven of 27 correctly identifying their
preferred brand.
   But Consumer Reports also ran a more sophisticated study,
testing 28 different cola types -- including the Big Two,
Shasta, Royal Crown and store brands -- to gauge the relative
taste quality of the products. The magazine used a taste
panel, trained to identify and score 18 sensory nuances such
as "fizziness" and individual flavor "notes" such as vanilla
or citrus.
   The panel found that nearly all the colas, caffeine-free
and regular, were "very good," while the best diet colas were
merely "good." In the end, the magazine acknowledged flavor
differences between Coca-Cola Classic and Pepsi, but found
that plenty of colas taste "just as good."
   So why do people like Coke and Pepsi so much? It just
might have something to do with the $300 million that the two
companies poured into advertising in the U.S. last year. "If
people could suspend for a moment the brand loyalty that the
cola giants have spent so much to instill," the magazine's
editors write, "they might be just as happy with other, often
cheaper cola brands."
   Taste tests, of course, while important, are just one
element in determining consumer preference, along with
pricing, packaging, distribution and advertising. "The
sensory evaluation of the taste test ought to be balanced
against the psychological issue of brand loyalty and
attitudes toward a given product," said Adam Drewnowski, a
professor of human nutrition at the University of Michigan at
Ann Arbor. "Attitudes and peer pressure can actually
influence your taste preference."
   Other research backs that up. In a 1983 study at King's
College in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., 30 soda drinkers were asked if
they preferred Pepsi or Coke, and then were given a bottle of
each to confirm their choice. What the subjects didn't know
is that the psychologists conducting the study had switched
the drinks, offering Coke in a Pepsi bottle and vice versa.
As a result, 22 were tricked.
   There have been studies showing people can distinguish
between colas. In 1985, in response to such research,
Coca-Cola introduced new Coke, the ill-fated reformulation of
its flagship brand that tastes more like Pepsi. Coca-Cola
executives launched the new drink to defend against the
decadelong taste superiority claims made in the successful
Pepsi Challenge commercials.
   Coca-Cola Co. didn't think much of the Consumer Reports
findings. "Our consumers give Coca-Cola a resounding vote
every day with hundreds of millions of servings," said a
spokesman. "That's why they have made Coke the No. 1 cola and
Diet Coke the No. 1 diet brand."
   PepsiCo Inc. thought its own research was more
substantial. "We have about 30 million taste tests in our
files, from the Pepsi Challenge, that show Pepsi is preferred
as the soft drink of choice," said a company spokesman.
   Some soda pop fans also take issue with Consumer Reports.
Says Lee Robin, a member of the Coca-Cola Collectors Club
International, a group that gathers nostalgic Coke trays,
signs and bottles: "One sip and we could all tell the
difference."

   Coca-Cola Co. announced it will introduce a
caffeine-free Coca-Cola Classic in test markets starting Monday.
   The company said Wednesday that the soft drink will be
introduced first in Charlotte, N.C., and in markets yet to be named
the following week.
   ``We believe the timing is right,'' said Ira C. Herbert,
president of Coca-Cola USA. ``Not only is the caffeine-free cola
segment growing rapidly, Coca-Cola Classic continues to experience
steady sales and share gains.''
   The new product will carry a gold label, while regular Coke
Classic has a red label.
   The company said a date for national distribution will depend on
the test market results.

   Diet colas are losing their sales fizz, and beverage
makers are scrambling to find a replacement.
   It's a matter of considerable urgency: Diet drinks fueled
the soft-drink industry's rapid growth in the 1980s. Now, to
drum up sales in a slowing market, the industry is looking at
such products as canned coffees, "new age" sodas, sports
drinks and juice drinks. Yesterday, for instance, Pepsi-Cola
said it would begin to distribute Ocean Spray juices in
January.

   Companies may also reformulate diet colas with new types
of sweeteners and aim them at new audiences.
   Whatever the ultimate answer, the fact is that beverage
makers are confronting a dramatically slowing market. For
much of the 1980s, the industry grew between 4% and 5%
annually -- primarily because of the exploding popularity of
diet colas. Today, industry growth has shrunk to between 2%
and 3%. Most notably, sales of diet soft drinks, which now
constitute 30% of the market, are no longer growing at
double-digit rates. This year, in a maturing market, sales of
both diet Coke and Diet Pepsi are expected to increase just
3% to 4% overall.
   Niche products like iced coffees or mountain blackberry
soda (made by Clearly Canadian Beverage Corp. in Vancouver)
may help soft-drink sales, but beverage executives doubt such
products represent the next blockbuster needed to carry the
industry through the 1990s. Specialty drinks "are never going
to be what the cola segment will be," observes J. Bruce
Llewellyn, chairman and chief executive officer of
Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Co. "No matter what
hocus-pocus there is, it doesn't amount to a hill of beans
compared with Coca-Cola."
   Or compared with its low-calorie cousin. Diet Coke, said
Roberto C. Goizueta, head of Coca-Cola Co., at its
introduction in 1982, "may well be the most successful new
product in the history of the soft-drink industry." He was
close. By 1984, diet Coke was the third most popular soft
drink in the country. In the same year, Coke and others began
substituting NutraSweet for saccharine in their diet drinks,
markedly improving the taste. More recently, beverage makers
have also begun chasing after men (women had been the first
target) by advertising diet drinks during sporting events.
   The upshot: Increases in sales of 20% for much of the
decade, recalls Ron Wilson, president of Philadelphia
Coca-Cola Bottling. "It was a gift horse to us."
   But the party is over. One reason is that low calories
aren't enough for many consumers these days. They also want
something that's healthy -- or appears to be.
   Enter "new age" sodas: fruity, clear beverages, often sold
in glass bottles, that have a wholesome air about them.
Clearly Canadian Beverage, with flavors like orchard peach,
sold in chunky blue glass bottles, expects sales this year of
$200 million, up from $17.3 million just two years ago.
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola is considering packaging Fresca, its
diet grapefruit drink, in a green glass bottle next year.
PepsiCo Inc., based in Purchase, N.Y., says it wants to get
into the segment in a big way but has yet to see sales take
off in test markets for H2Oh, the flavored bottled water it
has been testing for two years. "We're not going to sit by
the sidelines and watch the thing called `new age' grow
without participating," promises David Novak, PepsiCo's vice
president for marketing.
   For now Pepsi is getting into the fastgrowing juice
segment. Yesterday, the company said it plans to distribute
Ocean Spray single-serve drinks in stores and vending
machines nationwide by the end of 1992. The deal will enable
Pepsi to profit from the 10% annual growth in the $12 billion
fruit-drink and juice market, says Michael Bellas, president
of Beverage Marketing Corp.
   In another area, Coke and Pepsi are testing sports drinks
to vie with Gatorade, the Quaker Oats Co. product that
controls 88% of the $1 billion retail market for sports
drinks. Pepsi, which originally tested a Mountain Dew sports
drink last year, switched the name to "All Sport" and came
out with three new flavors in May. The company expects to
roll out cans and bottles nationally in the second quarter of
next year. Coke has its sports drink, PowerAde, in 1,000
outlets, or only about 0.3% of its fountain accounts.
   But the new product expected to make the biggest splash is
iced and canned coffee, and -- to a lesser extent -- brewed
and flavored teas. This is despite the fact that U.S.
consumption of coffee has been flat for a decade and sales of
tea have fallen steadily. Beverage executives maintain that
canned coffee is convenient and that consumers increasingly
prefer cold and sweet drinks to hot ones.
   Coke and Nestle expect their Mocha Cooler and Ice Breaker,
flavored coffees now in test market, to be rolled out in cans
and fountains next spring. Beverage industry experts expect
Pepsi to team up with Thomas J. Lipton Inc. to distribute a
new line of their own brewed tea and coffee. Kraft General
Foods, a unit of Philip Morris Cos., has been testing Cappio,
an iced-cappuccino drink, in Arizona since August 1990.
   Still, whether they be coffees, power drinks or "new age"
sodas, niche markets have drawbacks. To begin with, products
-- and product loyalty -- appear transient at best. In the
mid-1980s, Original New York Seltzer Co. enjoyed phenomenal
growth, capturing half a share point in the $46 billion
domestic soft-drink market. But the company's products, a
victim of fickle tastes, have retreated as of late.
   Then there are the beverage companies' giant distribution
systems -- geared toward cranking out soft drinks on a
massive scale and unable to benefit handsomely from niche
products. Such markets account for only $1.5 billion in
sales, according to Beverage Marketing Corp.'s Mr. Bellas,
while diet colas alone bring in $11 billion.
   All of which means that soft-drink companies will also
attempt to rejuvenate their diet drinks. Pepsi is planning a
"major all-out assault" to promote diet cola next year, in
stores and through national media, according to Mr. Novak,
the vice president for marketing.
   Both Coke and Pepsi are expected to set their advertising
to appeal to as broad an audience as possible. While men now
account for 43% of sales of diet colas, according to Simmons
Market Research, women still represent the greatest
opportunity for increased sales. "We don't want to take them
for granted," says Mr. Wilson at Philadelphia Coca-Cola
Bottling. To refocus on women, for example, Coke may scale
back use of endorsers like football players.
   Older drinkers -- the over-45 set, whose tastes seem to
favor less-sweet products and whose life styles become more
sedentary -- will also be a target of new marketing efforts,
as will blacks and Hispanics. Today, according to Simmons
Market Research, minority groups consume 20% less diet soda
than whites. To reach those groups, soft-drink makers will
"have to show them that you don't drink diet colas to look
like skinny white women," says Tom Pirko, president of
Bevmark Inc., a consulting firm.
   One way to do that, suggests Mr. Pirko, may be to to make
an appeal based on taste -- particularly if beverage makers
adopt new sweeteners in their diet drinks. That may occur as
early as December 1992, when the patent on the artificial
sweetener aspartame, held by NutraSweet, expires. "It will
kick a bunch of life into the diet category," predicts Mr.
Pirko.
   Perhaps, but "The company that guesses wrong on
replacement sweeteners could make the brouhaha {in 1985} over
`new Coke' look like a minor story," says Jesse Myers,
publisher of the trade publication Beverage Digest. "It could
be a marketing bonanza or a marketing fiasco."

<HL> Marketing: Coke Unveils Compact Dispenser, Hoping To Sell More Soft Drinks in Small Offices </HL>

   Coca-Cola Co. is mounting an assault on that venerable office institution: the water cooler. 

   Coke, naturally, would rather see employees gathering and gossiping around a Coca-Cola dispenser. 
So the company is introducing a compact machine, called BreakMate, that chills water, carbonates it, mixes it with Coca-Cola syrup and dispenses it into a 6 1/2-ounce cup. 

   The soft drink giant has been test-marketing BreakMate in small offices in 30 U.S. cities and overseas. 
It is now starting a national rollout of the machine, to be completed by the middle of next year. 
Coca-Cola won't say how much it has spent on BreakMate, the result of a project that started nearly 20 years ago. 
The company says only that the machine is one of the most expensive research and development projects it has ever undertaken. 

   W. Andrew Harvill, director of packaging and distribution development for Coke's fountain-sales division, says BreakMate "takes a giant leap forward" by enabling the company to reach places that are too small or unprofitable for a regular vending machine. 
"This could do for Coke what the microprocessor did for computers." 

   That's a grand vision, but some competitors aren't overly concerned. 
"It's interesting," says an executive at another big soft drink company. 
"We're watching it. 
But it isn't something I ask my guys to report on every week." 

   Although Coca-Cola denies it, some soft drink specialists believe BreakMate is a forerunner of a dispenser that will one day provide Coke, like tap water, in the home. 
"This is a Mr. Soda unit," says Jesse Meyers, publisher of the trade publication Beverage Digest. 
Mr. Meyers says he knows of five other big-name companies currently developing similar machines. 
"This is the opening salvo in home soft drink distribution -- Cola Wars III." 

   BreakMate is part of Coca-Cola's age-old strategy of making its soft drinks available in every possible nook and cranny of the world -- "within arm's reach of desire," as the company's longtime chief executive officer, the late Robert W. Woodruff, used to say. 
The theory behind the strategy: If it's there, people will drink it. 

   "With soft drinks, there is no pucker factor, as there is with juice," says Mr. Meyers. 
"And there are no ill effects, as there are with alcohol. 
If it is available, it will be consumed." 
As evidence of this strategy's success, soft drink consumption surpassed water consumption in the U.S. two years ago and now stands at about 45 gallons a person per year, according to some industry estimates. 

   But many workplaces have been largely untapped by soft drink companies. 
A soft drink vending machine is only profitable where there are at least 45 employees, according to Coca-Cola's research. 
As a result, the more than one million offices around the country with fewer than 45 workers have no ready access to soft drinks. 
Even in many big offices, vending machines are a long walk or an elevator ride from many departments. 
But Coke says BreakMate can be profitable in offices or departments with as few as five workers. 

   Coke isn't the first soft drink company to try to reach smaller offices. 
Two years ago, PepsiCo Inc. introduced 24-can minivending machines that can be mounted on a wall or sit on a countertop. 
"It has been a healthy business for us," says a Pepsi spokeswoman. 
But it hasn't exactly run away with the market. 
The small machines have increased by 10% Pepsi's overall vending business, which itself accounts for 10% of the company's total soft drink business. 

   Pepsi says it hasn't tried to introduce an office fountain machine such as BreakMate because of "issues of sanitation, service, mixing and maintenance," the spokeswoman says. 
"How will you get over those hurdles of having volunteers operating that equipment?" 

   Attempts by several other companies to crack the market have failed either because they required office workers to mix their own syrup and water or because distribution of just a few cans to many places was too cumbersome, recalls John Farquharson, president of Araserv, a food service concern that distributes coffee and refreshment services to offices. 

   Coca-Cola believes it has solved those problems. 
BreakMate, which is about the size of a microwave oven, contains three disposable canisters of syrup, each with enough for about 31 drinks. 
The machine also holds a cartridge of carbon dioxide good for about 250 drinks. 
These containers, which snap into place, can be replaced by office workers when they run out. 

   If the machine can't be connected to an outside water supply, it can be fitted with a water tank. 
BreakMate does all the measuring, mixing and dispensing. 
Workers either put coins into the machines or have the soft drinks paid for by their employers. 

   The machines are made by a West German appliance company, a joint venture of Robert Bosch G.m.b.H. and Siemens AG, and Coca-Cola provides the soft drink syrup. 
BreakMates are being distributed by BreakTime Enterprises, a Coca-Cola spinoff, through office coffee services, bottled-water operators, vending companies and bottlers, who regularly visit offices. 

   Araserv, one of its largest customers during the test-marketing, says its customers have been pleased. 
They've even accepted what might not fit into every office decor: the bright red Coke logo.

<HEAD>Coke, Pepsi Announce Recycled Plastic Bottles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the latest corporate attempt to meet
environmental concerns, Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola plan to market
products in recycled plastic bottles.
   The rival soft drink makers said Tuesday they were seeking
government approval for separate proposals to use recycled plastic.
The Food and Drug Administration to date has approved just one case
- submitted by an egg company - in which recycled plastic can be
used in direct contact with food.
   The FDA regards recycled plastic as ``an indirect additive'' to
food, said agency spokesman Chris Lecos.
   Plastic bottles are widely recycled now, but the finished
material is used for such products as carpeting, piping and
non-food containers - not for food packaging.
   The environmental group Greenpeace said it was unimpressed with
the cola makers' plans. Greenpeace spokeswoman Julie Brenegar said
the beverage companies would do better by eliminating plastic
packaging altogether.
   ``Plastics recycling is yet another way the plastics industry is
trying to justify the use of plastics,'' she said, adding that new
``virgin'' plastic is needed even for recycled packages.
   Therefore, she said, plastic recycling makes only a small dent
in the amount of raw material introduced to the environment.
   Jackie Prince, a staff scientist at the Washington-based
Environmental Defense Fund, said the Coke and Pepsi plans mark a
step in the right direction by expanding the uses for recycled
plastic.
   ``The reality is there is a lot of plastic out there now, and
we'd like to see what's there recycled,'' she said. ``This brings
plastics recycling further along the learning curve.''
   Coke spokesman Randy Donaldson said the recycling proposal was
submitted to the FDA in June, and officials at the Atlanta-based
company hope to test market the new bottles sometime in 1991 before
launching a full-scale rollout.
   Pepsi also said it plans to have the recycled bottles in stores
next year. FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbitt said the agency has been
talking to Pepsi's partner in the project, Goodyear Tire and Rubber
Co., about their planned recycling process and plans to review the
data shortly.
   The FDA review of the bottles will include analysis of product
quality, consumer safety and environmental impact.
   ``I think recycling is one thing the cola warriors agree on
totally,'' said Andrew Giangola, a spokesman at the Pepsi Cola
Co.'s headquarters in Somers, N.Y. ``They are both working with the
mutual goal of creating the most environmentally correct
packaging.''
   ``Producing new plastic beverage bottles with a blend of
recycled plastic is a significant step ahead in plastics
recycling,'' said M. Douglas Ivester, senior vice president at The
Coca-Cola Co.
   Several companies have taken steps to reduce the amount of solid
waste disposed of in landfills. McDonald's, in a highly publicized
move, recently announced it will stop using plastic foam containers
at its fast food restaurants.
   Coke and Pepsi already use recycled steel, aluminum and glass
for packaging. Pepsi officials estimated that about one-third of
soft drinks are in plastic bottles, though cans are the most widely
used.
   Coke said its process, developed with Hoechst Celanese Corp.,
involves breaking down the bottle polymer into original molecules,
then reconstructing the purified resin for use in making new
bottles.
   Pepsi's bottles, to be made by Sewell Plastics Inc. of Atlanta,
use Repete, a recycled resin based on ground soft drink bottles and
produced by Goodyear. The material is put back together with raw
materials to make the recycled bottles.
   Jesse Meyers, publisher of the industry newsletter Beverage
Digest, said recycled bottles give the soft drink business a way to
defend continued use of plastic amid fighting between the glass and
plastics industries.
   Despite the pronouncements of concern for the environment, it's
also a way to stimulate soft drink consumption by attracting
publicity to the products, Meyers said.
   ``The cola wars, whether its rock singers, taste tests or
packaging - it creates business for the industry,'' e said. ``The
cola wars is the only war where there are no losers.''

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Celebrity consumers say ``goodbye'' to Pepsi Cola
in Diet Coke television commercials for 1990 unveiled by the
Coca-Cola Co.
   Pepsi spokesman Tod MacKenzie immediately branded the tactic of
comparing the sugared Pepsi and the sugar-free diet Coke ``a feeble
attempt to get the playing field changed.''
   The 1990 Diet Coke advertising campaign unveiled Thursday
features model Jerry Hall, tennis star Chris Evert, ``Cosby Show''
actress Phylicia Rashad and TV personality Vanna White in 30-second
commercials.
   The theme is an extension of last year's ``The Move Is On''
campaign, which was designed to draw drinkers of Pepsi, the No. 2
soft drink behind Coca-Cola, to No. 3 Diet Coke.
   According to Beverage Digest, an industry publication, Pepsi
last year had 18.3 percent market share in the nation, while Diet
Coke was third at 8.9 percent. But Diet Coke's share of the market
rose 0.7 percent _ the biggest jump by any in the Beverage Digest
Top 10 _ while Pepsi declined 0.4 percent, the biggest drop and an
apparent reflection of the overall increasing popularity of diet
drinks.
   Pepsi's diet drink, fourth-ranked Diet Pepsi, also had a healthy
gain _ 0.5 percent _ to claim 5.7 percent of the market.
   MacKenzie, from Pepsi's Purchase, N.Y., headquarters, said he
hadn't seen the new Diet Coke ads but noted that Diet Pepsi
launched a new campaign featuring comedian Billy Crystal last week.
   ``Rest assured, we've got a pool of spots we're going to bring
out to take the wood to Diet Coke,'' he said.

FT  11 OCT 94 / Virgin to launch cola drink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Virgin, Mr Richard Branson's airline and retailing group, is planning to
break into cola markets around the world with its own brand of soft drinks.
Virgin said last night: 'In partnership with a major north American group,
we will operate in a large number of markets through selected multiple
retailers.' A formal announcement is expected soon.
Cott, the controversial Canadian producer of own-label drinks and foods, is
thought to be the partner. It broke into the UK earlier this year by
producing the own-brand Classic Cola for J. Sainsbury.
Classic Cola embroiled Sainsbury and Cott in a fight with Coca-Cola over
packaging. Sainsbury changed its packaging after Coke protested it was too
similar to Coke's own distinctive style.
The Sainsbury's drink has taken varying shares of the market depending on
how heavily it was promoted at any one time. Sales of Coke, produced in the
UK by Coca-Cola and Cadbury Schweppes, have been hit to some extent. But
Pepsi-Cola has enjoyed a rising market share due to the success of its
Pepsi-Max.
Virgin Cola, plus caffeine-free and diet versions, are believed to be in
production at the Ben Shaw plant in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, of which
Cott owns 51 per cent. Some 1bn cans are due in the first year, using a
different formula from the Sainsbury drink.

   The maker of Coca-Cola has agreed to
pay $50,000 to the state and provide consumers with $50,000 in
coupons in a settlement of a price-fixing complaint, the attorney
general's office said Wednesday.
   The agreement with Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated of
Charlotte, N.C., was announced one day after the attorney general's
office filed a complaint in U.S. District Court accusing the
company of conspiring to fix soft drink prices from 1982 to 1985.
   Judge Charles Haden has tentatively approved the settlement, the
attorney general's office said.
   Under the settlement, the bottling company will affix a minimum
of 250,000 20-cent coupon stickers to 2-liter bottles of Diet Coke,
Diet Sprite and caffeine-free Diet Coke on the soft drinks it
distributes in West Virginia from Feb. 20 to March 31. The coupons
can be redeemed at the retailer where the products are purchased.
   If the full $50,000 is not issued through the coupons, the
company will pay the state the difference, the attorney general's
office said.
   The company distributes soft drinks in most of West Virginia.

   TOKYO -- PepsiCo Inc. is launching an aggressive
advertising campaign in Japan, and it isn't just challenging
Coca-Cola Co. The food and beverage company is also aiming to
overturn Japan's long-held taboo against airing comparative
ads.
   Pepsi, which plans to start airing the commercial in Japan
next week, has been showing the same spot in the U.S. since
the end of last year. The ad features M.C. Hammer, the
popular rap artist, drinking Pepsi in between energetic gigs
on stage. After switching to Coke, the rapper suddenly starts
crooning the syrupy "Feelings," shocking his audience. But
after he sips a Pepsi handed to him by an eager fan, the
singer regains his high-energy rhythm.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We want this to be a trigger to start up our campaign,"
says Toshitake Yamagishi, assistant director of marketing at
Pepsi's Japanese unit. The ad is sure to spark controversy
among consumers here, he says. Conflict-evading Japanese
companies consider it too nasty to air ads that openly
challenge a competitor. Japan's Fair Trade Committee four
years ago eased restrictions against ads comparing products,
but both companies and TV networks have been reluctant to air
them.
   In addition, the arrogance displayed in many comparative
ads may put off Japanese consumers, says Toshio Yamaki, a
professor of advertising at Tokyo Keizai University. "As a
Japanese, I wonder if it's necessary to take such hysterical
action" to promote a product, he says. "You would never see
Nissan do such a thing against Toyota, or vice versa." Still,
says Mr. Yamaki, if Pepsi's attempt is successful, other
companies may consider trying the strategy.
   Japanese companies have certainly been airing more ads
that spell out the benefits of their products. Some recent
print ads even compare product prices, naming competitors.
But on television, companies tend to waffle on the identity
of their competitors. Laundry soap makers, for example,
compare their brands only to an unidentified product.
   Pepsi itself was unsuccessful in the past in trying to
compare products on Japanese television. Seven years ago, the
company made a commercial in which Japanese consumers took up
the Pepsi Challenge and compared the taste of Coke and Pepsi.
But the TV networks made Pepsi cover up Coca-Cola's name, so
the whole point of pushing Pepsi over Coke was lost.
   But now, Pepsi officials are confident that young
Japanese, the main imbibers of soft drinks in Japan, will
support its new ad. M.C. Hammer is so popular among
teen-agers that the tickets for his Japanese concert tour
this month sold out in a couple of hours. In addition, "This
is a more sophisticated ad than simply tasting and comparing"
the drinks, says Mr. Yamagishi.
   Pepsi needs to take daring action here. The company, which
has only a 2% share of Japan's soft-drink market, compared
with Coke's 30%, has recently set a goal of increasing its
market share to 5% by 1995. Pepsi has also been selling such
new products as pear-flavored soda. And for skeptical
consumers, it will offer 200-milliliter Pepsi cans for half
the price of regular 355-milliliter soda cans.
   Until now, Pepsi's marketing activities in Japan have been
pretty meek. After entering the market about 30 years ago, it
was quickly knocked off store shelves by Coke and was never
able to regain favor with Japanese consumers. The most it did
was air U.S.-made ads featuring pop artists like Michael
Jackson and Lionel Richie. Young Japanese loved the ads, but
Pepsi's distribution network was so small that many of them
couldn't find the drink in local convenience stores.
   In Japan, Pepsi can't even advertise its cola drink as
"the choice of the new generation," as it does in the U.S.,
says Mr. Yamagishi, because "right now, Pepsi is not the
choice." Instead, the company uses the phrase "Pepsi loves
you."
   Coca-Cola, while stressing that it's not moving to fend
off Pepsi's challenge, is nonetheless launching its own big
advertising campaign, and it says it wants to quadruple sales
of Coke in the next decade.
   "The Japanese are the most adventurous of all consumers"
in trying out different products, says Robert Harland,
director and senior vice president of Coca-Cola's Japanese
unit. Suntory Ltd. plans to launch a cola-flavored drink with
an additional touch -- the aroma of acerola, a red wild
berry. Ueshima Coffee Corp. last year started marketing the
U.S.'s Jolt Cola, which includes double the amount of
caffeine of regular cola. As many as 5,500 kinds of soft
drinks are on sale at any one time, says Mr. Harland, with
more than 1,000 new entries every year.
   While analysts doubt that Pepsi's new campaign will cause
sales to surge immediately, many consumers are likely to wake
up to the company's existence. "I visited the Pepsi
headquarters last year, and I was really surprised," says Mr.
Yamaki, the advertising professor. "I didn't think it was

<HEAD>Study Links Caffeine to Premenstrual Syndrome</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women who ingest even moderate amounts of
caffeine appear to be more susceptible to premenstrual syndrome, an
Oregon State University researcher says.
   A study by Annette Rossignol, associate professor of public
health, showed that women who drink half a cup to four cups of tea
a day were twice as likely to experience PMS. When the caffeine
intake was increased to 4{ to eight cups a day, the incidence of
PMS rose nearly tenfold.
   Rossignol noted Thursday that the tea used in the study
contained less caffeine than would be found in a cup of brewed
coffee or in some soft drinks.
   PMS, which occurs in the second half of the menstrual cycle, can
cause depression, fatigue, irritability, anxiety, headaches,
swelling or tenderness of the breasts and craving for sweet or
salty foods.
   The cause of PMS is unknown, but it affects about 70 percent of
women aged 18 and older, with 10 to 15 percent of the women
experiencing severe or disabling symptoms, Rossignol said.
   Rossignol said some researchers have suggested factors affecting
PMS may include diet, hormonal imbalance, alcohol and tobacco use,
oral contraceptives and lack of exercise.
   Her research four years ago found a possible correlation between
PMS and caffeine.
   ``One problem in studying caffeine and PMS is that unhealthy
habits tend to cluster,'' she said. ``People who drink a lot of
caffeine-containing beverages may also smoke, drink alcohol, be
prone to a lack of exercise or have poor dietary habits. It was
difficult to isolate the caffeine factor in association with PMS.''
   She said she eliminated those factors in her latest research,
when she co-directed a study of women nursing students and workers
in a tea factory in rural areas of China.
   ``The women did not drink alcoholic beverages, they did not
smoke, there was no coffee or cola in the rural area of China, they
did not use oral contraceptives, and they exercised every day,
riding their bikes to work,'' Rossignol said.
   Results of Rossignol's study were published in the American
Journal of Public Health in January.
   Rossignol emphasized that caffeine may not cause PMS, but it may
contribute to the onset of its symptoms or make them more severe.
   ``PMS is very difficult to measure because it affects women
differently,'' she said. ``There is no test for PMS. You cannot
take a blood test or see it on an X-ray. Most diagnostic procedures
require keeping a daily diary and looking at the pattern of
symptoms over time.''
   Further studies are necessary to determine if PMS has a genetic
link, and whether caffeine causes it or contributes to the severity
of the symptoms, Rossignol said.
   ``I suspect that there is a constellation of causes of PMS,''
she said.

<HEAD>Coke and Pepsi Taste Tests Are All Fizz, Regulator Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While the heated advertising war between Diet Coke
and Diet Pepsi is being fought with celebrities such as Madonna,
Michael Jackson and Don Johnson, Massachusetts regulators say the
companies' claims last summer to win consumer taste tests were made
without substantiation.
   In the ads last summer, Pepsi said it was ``undisputed champion''
and ``decisively beat Diet Coke'' in taste tests, while Diet Coke
said it was ``winner and still champion'' after beating Pepsi four
times in four years.
   Paula W. Gold, state secretary of consumer affairs and business
regulation, said Wednesday that both companies' tests were skewed by
improper sampling techniques and ``did not fairly represent a random
sample of cities across the nation.''
   Coke and Pepsi have been competing intensely for the lucrative
diet soft drink market, which is growing at an annual rate of 8.4
percent, more than twice as fast as sales of soda as a whole.
   During 1988, Diet Coke had 8.2 percent of the $43 billion soft
drink market, while Diet Pepsi had 5.2 percent, according to Jesse
Meyers, publisher of Beverage Digest in Greenwich, Conn.
   Gold, an aggressive regulator who has previously ordered
investigations into auto salesmen and bank fees, said she decided to
check on Coke and Pepsi because of the obvious contradiction between
their high-profile ads. Both companies discontinued the ads at the
end of the summer.
   Although Coca-Cola is based in Atlanta, and Pepsi's headquarters
are in Purchase, N.Y., Gold said they have operations in
Massachusetts and their advertising has an effect here.
   ``I think if suspect advertising practices are allowed to go
unchecked, then advertisers come down to the lowest common
denominator,'' she said. ``You've got to look at and enforce the big
players as well as the little ones.''
   Spokesmen for both Coke and Pepsi disputed the Massachusetts
regulator's findings.
   ``This type of test has been upheld in the past by the courts,
certainly by the television networks, and also by the National
Advertisers Bureau,'' said Tod MacKenzie, a spokesman at Pepsi's
headquarters. ``This quite frankly seems to be a case in which the
state has stepped into an area that's new to it, and I think that
shows in their report.''
   Gold said she requested detailed information from the soft drink
companies in July and gave it to an independent evaluator, Frederick
Wiseman, a professor of marketing and statistics at Northeastern
University in Boston.
   Wiseman said Wednesday that Coke gave taste tests to 999 people
in 10 Eastern cities. Pepsi's test sample was 1,000 people in four
cities _ Seattle, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Indianapolis.
   ``Taste test research does not have to be as exact as a political
poll, where you're really aiming for a national projection,''
Wiseman said.
   ``But this is a case where the samples were just too far off. You
had Coke basically ignoring one half of the country, and Pepsi
picking just four cities, all within 100 miles of a processing
plant.''
   Wiseman said he found no evidence that either company
deliberately rigged its samples to achieve a certain result. Rather,
he said, ``it appears they were just trying to get it done quickly.''
   Gold said that after the ads had aired, Coke expanded its sample
to 27 cities across the country. If Coke had done the broader
testing before the ads ran, she said, it would have been adequate
substantiation.
   ``But doing it after the fact still doesn't make it right,'' she
said.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (9): The home of Coca-Cola - Soft
drinks company is at the forefront of Atlanta community projects - It all
began in Atlanta / A look at the remarkable story behind the world's
best-known trade mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS

<TEXT>
Coca-Cola may not be the biggest company in Atlanta: in terms of sheer
head-count, Delta, AT&amp;T, BellSouth and Lockheed employ more people. But it
is the company most commonly associated with the city, and without doubt the
one with the strongest historical links to it.
Indeed, the company's best-selling product, the Coca-Cola soft drink, was
born in Atlanta more than a century ago. According to legend, the first
Coca-Cola syrup was brewed up in the city on May 8, 1886 by Dr John
Pemberton, a local pharmacist, in a three-legged brass pot in his backyard.
Dr Smith carried a jug of the product down the road to Jacobs' Pharmacy
where it was tasted, pronounced good, and placed on sale as a soda fountain
drink at 5 cents a glass.
Coke has come on a bit since then: today, it is the world's most ubiquitous
consumer product, the world's best-known trade mark and by far the world's
best-selling soft drink. If you include the company's other products -
notably, Fanta and Sprite - Coca-Cola accounts for nearly half the world's
annual consumption of soft drinks.
How did Coca-Cola do it? It helped that people liked the drink (ingredients
of the early version included coca leaves and cola nuts, producing an
exhilarating cocktail of cocaine and caffeine). But there was more to it
than that.
Much of the company's early growth was attributable to the business acumen
of Asa Candler, an Atlantan who bought the business from Dr Pemberton and
greatly expanded it through innovative advertising. Then, in 1919, the
Candler family interests sold the company to a syndicate led by Ernest
Woodruff, another Atlantan, for Dollars 25m - at the time, the biggest
financial transaction the south had seen.
Before long, however, the company was in trouble. There were legal disputes
with bottlers, sugar prices were turbulent, imitators were rampant and sales
were down. There was even talk that the company could go under. But in 1923,
Ernest's son, Robert Woodruff, was elected president. This highly successful
businessman was to lead the company for the next six decades. One of Robert
Woodruff's most astute moves was to embark on a big international expansion
for Coca-Cola. To a large degree, the foundations for this expansion were
laid during the Second World War when Woodruff declared it his objective 'to
see that every man in uniform gets a bottle of Coca-Cola for 5 cents
wherever he is and whatever it costs the company.'
The result was that 64 bottling plants were shipped abroad and billions of
bottles of Coke were consumed.
The reason this proved so important was that the presence of Coca-Cola did
more than lift the morale of the troops. In many areas, it gave people their
first taste of Coca-Cola - a taste they obviously enjoyed. And when peace
returned, the Coca-Cola system was poised for the rapid international growth
that continues today.
This explains one of the big differences between Coca-Cola and its rival
PepsiCo, the US manufacturer of Pepsi-Cola. In the US, Coke struggles to
outsell Pepsi. But in the rest of the world, the only big markets which
Pepsi has been able to dominate are those from which Coke was at one time
excluded for political reasons, such as the former Soviet Union and the
Middle East.
The result is that Coke now gets about 80 per cent of its operating profits
from outside the US, while the figure for PepsiCo's beverage division is
barely 16 per cent.
Although Coca-Cola is easily the world's biggest soft drinks company, and
growing bigger by the day, it cannot afford to relax. Recently, competition
from private label colas has been an irritant in the US, Canada and the UK,
and in the US Coca-Cola is having to react to the rapid growth of
alternative beverages such as iced teas and fruit juice drinks, introducing
its own range of 'natural' drinks. But the company's strong profits growth
suggests it is doing the right things: last year, net income rose by 19 per
cent to a record Dollars 2.2bn, excluding unusual items.
For Atlanta, it is just as well. Apart from the fact that Coca-Cola and its
bottling affiliates provide employment for nearly 8,000 people in the city,
the company has a reputation for being Atlanta's leading corporate citizen,
pursuing a long-standing strategy of philanthropic involvement in the
community.
This philanthropic involvement began with Robert Woodruff, whose
contributions to Atlanta's arts, to cultural organisations and to
educational communities amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars over his
lifetime.
The tradition has been continued by the company itself - not least through
the creation in 1984 of the Coca-Cola Foundation, an organisation dedicated
to supporting excellence in education.
Examples of the foundation's work in Atlanta over the last year or so
include a Dollars 2m contribution to Clark Atlanta University to support
teacher eduction and to develop a School of Public and International
Affairs; a contribution of Dollars 1m to Morris Brown College to support
faculty chair endowments and the Presidential Scolars Program for
African-American students; and a Dollars 1m gift to Georgia State University
for the renovation of the Rialto Theatre and two nearby buildings to help
revive the historic Fairlie-Poplar district.
In the arts field, Coca-Cola makes contributions totalling more than Dollars
1m a year to about 40 organisations. It recently pledged Dollars 500,000 to
the Martin Luther King Jr Center which aims to advance the non-violent
philosophies fo Dr King in the ares of training, research and education. And
it made a Dollars 1m commitment to the Atlanta Project, an initiative
established by the former president Jimmy Carter to fight poverty and
hopelessness in the inner city.
Atlanta's business leaders are unstinting in their praise of Coca-Cola's
contribution to the city - 'if every company were as community-minded as
Coca-Cola, we would have a Utopian city here,' says Mr Gerald Bartels,
president of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. 'They are always in the
forefront of any community project with their money, with their leadership,
with whatever it might take.'

   PepsiCo Inc. has decided it's tea time.
   The No. 2 soft-drink company is teaming up with Thomas J.
Lipton Co. in a joint venture to create new tea drinks and to
pump Lipton's existing ready-to-drink teas through Pepsi's
enormous distribution system.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Neither company would say how much they plan to invest.
One person familiar with the arrangement said that hasn't yet
been decided. The two companies will share the profits and
the expenses evenly, he said. When Coca-Cola Co. struck a
similar joint-venture deal with Nestle S.A. to develop coffee
and tea drinks last year, each company invested $50 million
in the venture.
   For Pepsi, the alliance, which has been rumored for
months, furthers its strategy of broadening its beverage
portfolio amid a slowing soft-drink market. Just last month,
the company unveiled plans to distribute Ocean Spray juices.
And though Pepsi says it hasn't any current plans, industry
analysts believe Pepsi is also studying ways to enter the
ready-to-drink coffee business. In an effort to help spark
sales, Pepsi is also working to develop a new colorless cola.
   With Lipton, Pepsi joins the dominant player, with an
estimated 50% market share, in the $400 million market for
ready-to-drink teas, which is growing at doubledigit rates.
   Industry analysts predict a clash of the cola giants over
tea. "With the Coke/Nestle and Pepsi/Lipton programs, we're
going to see major promotions for ready-to-drink teas in
convenience stores and vending machines," said Jesse Meyers,
publisher of trade newsletter Beverage Digest.
   For Lipton, a unit of Netherlands-based Unilever, the deal
offers a way to guard against the Coca-Cola Nestle venture.
To market its teas, Lipton currently relies on several
Coca-Cola bottlers. Once Coca-Cola Nestle begins marketing
its teas in the U.S., Lipton believes it certainly would have
had to seek other bottling partners. In joining Pepsi, said
David St. Clair, a Lipton senior vice president, "We felt we
might as well face the music now."
   The demographics of tea drinkers should minimalize the
venture's cannibalization of Pepsi's soft-drink sales, said
Sheldon Roesch, a Pepsi vice president, who was named general
manager of the Pepsi-Lipton venture. He said tea drinkers
tend to be older than core soft-drink consumers, who are in
their teens and 20s.
   The companies said they will also explore international
affiliations on a market-by-market basis.

   Call it New Pepsi. Or See-Through Pepsi.
   In what could be the most innovative new beverage from the
big cola companies in years, PepsiCo Inc. is developing a
clear, colorless Pepsi.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new drink won't replace the regular, dark-colored
Pepsi, the nation's No. 2 soft drink, which was first whipped
up by a North Carolina pharmacist 93 years ago. Rather, the
new product, which will be introduced next spring at the
earliest, would be sold side-by-side with regular Pepsi,
according to two Pepsi marketers and an industry executive
familiar with the plans.
   In recent weeks, Pepsi marketers have been reviewing
plans, including how to position, package and advertise the
drink. The clear Pepsi, which will probably have a cola
taste, would take advantage of the little-known fact that
cola isn't inherently dark. And though the company is
committed to making a transparent Pepsi, flavors other than
cola are being considered, one Pepsi manager says.
   In Somers, N.Y., a Pepsi spokesman said he "can't confirm
that there's anything in the works" regarding a clear Pepsi.
"We are always looking for new ideas," he says, "but we have
nothing to announce right now."
   Rival Coca-Cola Co. has been studying clear colas, too.
There are no plans for a see-through Coca-Cola Classic,
Coke's flagship brand and the nation's No. 1 soft drink. But
the company in the past year has considered a clear version
of one of its diet colas, Tab, according to one former Coke
manager and an industry executive. A Coke spokesman says he
knows of no such discussions, adding: "There are no plans to
market a clear Tab."
   The new Pepsi could lure people from "new age" drinks --
clear beverages, typically fruity and sold in bottles, with a
wholesome air to them. Though a small category now, their
sales are growing at about 4% to 6% a year, double the
current rate of the traditional soft-drink market. "When
someone pours a clear, new-age drink in a glass, it looks
natural, light and refreshing," attributes more appealing to
an aging Baby Boom population, says Harold Taber, president
of Hansen Beverage Co., a maker of natural soft drinks in
Brea, Calif.
   At least, the new Pepsi could spark excitement in a
soft-drink market thirsting for new products. For much of the
1980s, the soft-drink market grew at 4% to 5% annual rates,
stimulated by new products like diet colas and juice-added
beverages. Now, amid a maturing market, diet drinks have
slipped off their double-digit growth track, and the overall
soft-drink industry is expected to grow only 2% to 3% this
year.
   Still, a clear Pepsi cola faces obstacles. Over the years,
a few small companies, like Snapple Natural Beverage Co.,
have tried clear colas, which have strong novelty appeal, but
haven't been big sellers. By 1989, after several years of
selling Snapple Crystal Cola, the brand only amounted to 3%
to 4% of Snapple's sales, and the cola was dropped.
   "It was good tasting, but unfortunately, people are
creatures of habit," says Carl Gilman, Snapple's vice
president, sales and marketing. "The eyes see cola as caramel
color."
   In fact, beverage makers have to add caramel color to make
their colas dark. Noting that the main flavor ingredients for
cola include oils from limes and lemons, Phil Capasso, a
flavor expert at Ungerer &amp; Co., a Lincoln Park, N.J., flavor
and fragrance company, says, "You can leave the color out and
still have cola."
   No matter how well marketed, though, a clear Pepsi isn't
expected to have widespread appeal. Internally at Pepsi, the
new drink is characterized as a "niche" product, meaning it
will probably appeal to limited groups of consumers. In an
industry with $46 billion in annual retail sales, even small
market shares nabbed by popular niche products can reap big
dollars. To emphasize the new Pepsi's unusual clarity, the
company may sell the product in bottles; cans would hide the
"un-cola" look.

   Pepsi-Cola Co. said Wednesday it had signed pop
star Madonna for a global ad campaign that industry watchers said
would chart virgin waters by debuting a song in a television
commercial.
   Pepsi _ firing the latest volley in the newly escalating
marketing war with Coca-Cola Co. _ also will sponsor a planned world
tour by the actress-singer later in 1989 after the release of
Madonna's first album in three years, ``Like A Prayer.''
   The Madonna announcement comes on the heels of industry leader
Coke's new ad campaign aimed at pushing sales of Diet Coke past
Pepsi, currently second in the market behind Coke Classic. That
effort marks the first time a major diet soda has squared off
directly against a leading sugared competitor, signaling a new
intensity in the years-old cola wars.
   Coke earlier this month signed pop singer George Michael for a
series of Diet Coke commercials, on top of a campaign already
featuring hockey star Wayne Gretzky, model Elle MacPherson and
``Miami Vice'' star Don Johnson, a one-time Pepsi pitchman.
   ``What's obviously shaping up is George Michael and Diet Coke
versus Madonna and sugar Pepsi,'' Coca Cola USA spokesman Anthony
Tortorici said. ``Frankly, we like those odds.''
   Terms of the Madonna contract were not disclosed, but if history
is any guide the deal with the brash singer of ``Like A Virgin'' and
star of the movie ``Desperately Seeking Susan'' should be in the
millions.
   Pepsi's award-winning ad campaigns featuring pop music began in
1984, when the number two soft-drink company signed Michael Jackson
and his brothers to a $5.5 million, one-year deal that was the
largest of its kind at the time.
   Two years later, Pepsi signed Jackson for a reported $10 million
to develop commercials over a three-year period. Rock stars Tina
Turner, David Bowie, Lionel Ritchie and the Miami Sound Machine also
have appeared in Pepsi ads.
   ``Pepsi has really pioneered the entire music marketing
phenomenon,'' Pepsi USA spokesman Tod MacKenzie said. ``People
expect us to be on top of what's new, what's hot and what's next.
Madonna is next.''
   ``I think we set the trend and others have followed,'' he said.
   Modeled as mini music videos, the Pepsi ads have taken the common
tactic of celebrity promotions a step further by using popular songs
as the center of a direct sales pitch.
   The Madonna deal adds another twist: using a commercial to debut
a song aimed at a popular audience.
   Pepsi said the title track to ``Like A Prayer'' would be heard
publicly for the first time in a commercial to be aired in prime
time early next month. The single is scheduled for release March 3
with the album to follow March 15, Warner Bros. spokesman Bob Merlis
said.
   ``I don't recall anyone orchestrating the debut of a new record
in a TV commercial,'' said Ken Barnes, editor of Radio and Records,
a music industry trade publication in Los Angeles. ``It's a new
stage in the marriage between commerce and the arts.''
   Barnes said pop songs long have emerged from commercials _
including the Carpenters' ``We've Only Just Begun,'' originally a
bank ad, and the recent British single ``The First Time'' by Robin
Beck, which was spun off a Coke commercial.
   ``But gearing an actual planned commercial release for a TV spot
I think is a new approach,'' he said.
   Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, and Pepsi-Cola, based in Somers,
N.Y., dominate the $43.2 billion U.S. soft-drink business.
   According to the industry newsletter Beverage Digest, Coke
Classic topped all brands last year with 20.1 percent of domestic
sales. Pepsi was second with 18.7 percent, followed by Diet Coke at
8.2 percent and Diet Pepsi at 5.2 percent.

   ATLANTA -- In the next round of the diet cola wars, one of
the longest-running and best-known jingles in soft-drink
advertising faces an overhaul.
   Coca-Cola Co. plans to change "Just for the taste of it,"
the nine-year-old, founding slogan for diet Coke, which is
considered a gem in the advertising business. In recent
weeks, Coca-Cola and its diet brand ad agency, Lintas: New
York, have been tinkering with alternate slogans, including
"Diet Coke: It's the one."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But according to two industry executives, the work
recently has focused on "Just for the taste, this is the
one." The new commercials are expected to make their debut
during the Super Bowl broadcast in January. Plans are to
continue with "Can't beat the real thing" as the theme for
next year's Coca-Cola Classic campaign. "Diet Coke will
continue to stay on the platform of `Just for the taste,'"
said a Coke spokesman, who wouldn't elaborate.
   Coke's risky decision to change its $65 million diet
campaign stems partly from the success of Diet Pepsi's
"You've got the right one baby, uh-huh" spots with singer Ray
Charles, which have been ranked in recent months among the
most memorable commercials for any product.
   Coke executives, some of whom try to avoid using the
phrase "uh-huh" in conversations these days, want a fresher
approach than the current diet Coke spots, which feature
Paula Abdul dancing and singing. They are also looking for a
more pointed rebuttal to Diet Pepsi's "You've got the right
one" proposition.
   For several months, pressure has intensified internally at
Coke for better advertising. M. Douglas Ivester, president of
the domestic division, and Peter Sealey, appointed late last
year to head Coke's global marketing, have been reviewing all
the campaigns and marketing plans with an eye toward change.
Last month, the Backer Spielvogel Bates ad agency was allowed
to present some ideas for Coca-Cola Classic advertising, in
an attempt to cut into McCann-Erickson's 40-year relationship
with Coke.
   The "Just for the taste of it" campaign has had a split
personality. The slogan itself has been a winner, positioning
diet Coke on taste instead of calories. It was also
instrumental in moving diet Coke ahead of its more
established rival, Diet Pepsi, and establishing a momentum
that has yet to be reversed. Based on supermarket sales, diet
Coke's soft-drink market share rose to 7.5% in April and May,
compared with 3.7% in April and May 1983. By contrast, Diet
Pepsi's supermarket share in the same periods rose to 5.8%
from 2.8%, according to figures compiled by the industry
newsletter Beverage Digest.
   But much to the frustration of Coke executives, campaign
executions have been inconsistent. Last year, certain diet
Coke commercials, for example, featured little more than a
parade of celebrities, like Vanna White and Sugar Ray
Leonard, badmouthing Pepsi. At the same time, a commercial
teaming Ms. Abdul with Elton John helped push diet Coke onto
a list of the 25 most popular ads, as compiled by Video
Storyboard Tests Inc., for the first time since the early
days of the diet Coke campaign. Aside from a short time in
1985, when the company included the phrase "one of a kind" in
its diet Coke ads, the company has religiously stuck with the
theme "Just for the taste of it."
   Although Coke apparently disagrees, some industry
executives think that the "taste" focus has run its course
with beverages and should be scrapped. Many Americans, they
reason, are already convinced that diet drinks are a tasty
enough alternative to regular ones. In the diet beer
business, Miller Brewing Co. recently dropped the "Tastes
great . . . less filling" campaign for Miller Lite in favor
of "It's it and that's that."

   SPARTANBURG, S.C. -- TW Services Inc. named Coca-Cola Co.
as the primary soft-drink supplier for its 465 Hardee's
restaurants and 1,700 Canteen cafeterias, giving Coke another
boost over archrival PepsiCo Inc.
   TW's announcement Friday came on the heels of Burger King
Corp.'s decision earlier last week to switch to Coke from
Pepsi in its 5,400 restaurants. Though Coke declined to
estimate potential sales, industry observers said the
agreement was significantly smaller than the Burger King
deal, which cost Pepsi more than an estimated $270 million in
annual sales.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The latest agreement shows that "any company that handles
a Pepsi-Cola food-service account is now being hotly
revisited by Coca-Cola executives," said Jesse Meyers,
publisher of Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter.
"Likewise, I would be amazed if Pepsi wasn't mounting a
full-scale attack on Coke's accounts."
   TW, the fourth-largest food-service concern in the U.S.,
is the largest franchisee of Hardee's Food Systems, which has
a total of about 2,700 restaurants. TW also operates its
cafeterias in places such as corporate offices and parks.
Coke is already the primary soft-drink supplier for TW's 213
Quincy's, 206 El Pollo Loco and 1,001 Denny's restaurants,
but has shared TW's Hardee's franchises with Pepsi before
now.
   A Pepsi spokesman said the company still supplies soft
drinks to about 600 Hardee's owned by other franchisees.

   Coke May Brew
   An Iced Coffee
   For the Morning

   ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Co., looking for ways to win a bigger
share of the morning beverage market, is developing an
iced-coffee product, according to beverage industry
executives.
   It wasn't clear how close Coke may be to bringing the
coffee to market. The company is studying the product in
focus groups, an industry executive said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Coke declined to comment.
   For Coke, the new coffee underscores a burgeoning interest
in beverages outside the traditional soft-drink arena. In
March, Coke started selling PowerAde, a so-called isotonic
sports drink developed to combat Gatorade. Coke's heightened
new-product activity comes as growth in the regular soda
market slowed in the past year.
   In its bid for more of the pre-lunch market, Coke for the
past three years has been running a "Coke in the Morning" ad
campaign in certain areas. According to industry estimates,
coffee accounts for 47% of the morning beverage market,
followed by juice with 21%, milk at 17%, tea, 7% and soft
drinks, only 4%.
   Iced coffees generally are ready-to-drink coffees that are
chilled. Coke's development of such a product, the industry
executives added, may have been accelerated as a result of
the recent market test of Nescafe Mocha Cooler, made by one
of Coke's biggest global beverage competitors, Nestle Foods
Corp., a unit of Nestle S.A. in Vevey, Switzerland. Being
tested in several U.S. cities, the Nestle product -- a
combination of coffee, chocolate and milk -- is based on an
iced coffee the company introduced last year in the United
Kingdom. Nestle plans soon to distribute that product,
Nescafe Frappe, in France, Spain, Switzerland, West Germany,
Greece and Canada.
   General Foods USA is expected to launch its own iced
cappuccino next year, according to a beverage industry
observer. General Foods, owned by Philip Morris Cos.,
wouldn't comment.
   Coke has been studying iced coffee for years but
previously had come to the conclusion that there wasn't
sufficient demand for such a product in the U.S. In Japan, by
contrast, where ready-to-drink coffees -- both iced and hot
-- are a $3.7 billion industry, Coke has successfully sold
its Georgia Coffee brand for years. Georgia Coffee's strong
performance there, in fact, is one reason why Japan is
Coca-Cola's biggest profit center.
   But recent market research by Bevmark Inc. suggests the
time may be ripe for iced coffee here. Across a broad section
of socioeconomic and ethnic groups, consumers show a strong
acceptance of iced coffee as a substitute for hot coffee and
even, in some instances, for soft drinks, according to
studies by the Los Angeles beverage consulting company.
People still worry about the caffeine content in iced coffee,
the research showed. But consumers tended to prefer the
flavor of creamed and sweetened iced coffees over hot
coffees.
   Although iced coffee has tended to be more of a luncheon
beverage, industry consultants said, companies are aiming to
position it as a morning drink to take advantage of
consumers' increasing defection from hot coffee in the
morning to cold and sweet beverages.
   The current U.S. market for iced coffees is tiny, less
than $15 million a year, according to Beverage Marketing
Corp., a New York beverage consultant. The chilled products
represent the newest niche coffee marketers are experimenting
with to combat declining coffee consumption.
   Iced coffee could be one of the fastest-growing new
beverages in years, some marketers say. "It looks like a
product with tremendous potential to attract younger and
older consumers," said Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark.
   What products iced coffee will replace is a matter of
debate. It may hurt iced-tea sales, some beverage experts
said. "It won't cannibalize coffee, but will feed on soft
drinks and other cold drinks," said George Boecklin,
president of the National Coffee Association. If people want
a hot drink, he noted, they won't substitute an iced coffee
for it.
   But Michael Bellas, president of Beverage Marketing,
expects older, regular coffee drinkers to be the initial
target of the iced-coffee sales effort. Eventually, he said,
the marketing will be directed more at younger people,
thereby tapping into the soft-drink industry's most important
consumer group.

<HEAD>Coca-Cola Reports 2nd Quarter Earnings Up 14 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coca-Cola Co. today reported a 14 percent increase
in its second-quarter profit, partly reflecting good returns from
investments in its soft drink operations, bottling joint ventures
and marketing.
   Coke said its after-tax income came to $345.5 million, or 98
cents a share, in 1989's second quarter, up from $303.1 million, or
82 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier.
   Revenue for the latest quarter rose 5 percent to $2.4 billion
from $2.3 billion.
   International shipments of concentrate and syrup continued to
grow at a greater rate than domestic shipments, Coke reported.
   Concentrate and syrup shipments outside the United States
advanced 15 percent for the quarter, compared to 3 percent at home.
The biggest jump was in Latin America, for which the company
credited successful marketing activities in Brazil and continued
infrastructure development combined with the increased affordability
of Coca-Cola products in Mexico.
   In the United States, the company said, growth was led by the
continued momentum of its diet Coke and caffeine-free diet Coke
brands.
   ``Our investment in bottling joint ventures, soft drink
infrastructure, and marketing continue to provide substantial
worldwide volume, market share and profit gains,'' Coke Chairman
Roberto C. Goizueta said in a news release.
   ``These investments produce consistently attractive returns and
support our expectations for strong bottom-line performance for the
remainder of the year,'' Goizueta said.
   For the first half of the year, Coke's income was $605.3 million,
or $1.70 a share, which was a 17.9 percent increase over $513.6
million, or $1.39 a share, in the first six months of 1988.
   Revenue rose 5.5 percent to $4.4 billion in the first half from
$4.2 billion a year earlier.

FT  24 AUG 94 / Tonic for fickle tastebuds: New Age soft drinks and
own-label colas are posing a challenge to market leaders Coke and Pepsi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For as long as anyone can remember, more people have quenched their thirsts
with a Coca-Cola or its closest imitator, Pepsi-Cola, than any other soft
drink money can buy. Together, they account for more than 50 per cent of all
the carbonated drinks consumed worldwide. And yet . . . is it just possible
that some of the fizz is going out of the market for two of the world's
best-selling products?
In the US, which alone accounts for a third of the world market for soft
drinks, consumers are showing signs of getting bored with Coke and Pepsi.
These days, they want wider variety. Cola-flavoured drinks are slowly losing
market share to new types of beverages such as iced teas, fruit drinks,
bottled water and energy-giving sports drinks. In the late 1980s, according
to US securities firm Salomon Brothers, colas took 63 per cent of the US
soft drinks market. Last year, the figure was down to 58 per cent.
But alternative beverages are not the only worry for Coke and Pepsi. Until
recently, the biggest threat Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, the company that makes
Pepsi, faced was each other. Now a bigger one seems to have emerged: the
possibility that private-label manufacturers are taking an increasing share
of a market that is in any case shrinking because consumers' tastes are
changing.
At first sight, this proposition seems to be supported by PepsiCo's latest
financial results. Its second-quarter profits this year were Dollars 447m -
excluding exceptional items, unchanged from the same period the previous
year.
Coca-Cola, however, increased net profits by 13 per cent to Dollars 758m in
the same period. More significantly, Coca-Cola's share price, currently
hovering around its all-time high, suggests that investors think the
company's glory days are far from over.
One reason why the companies' figures tell different stories is that, unlike
Coca-Cola, PepsiCo derives only 35 per cent of its operating profits from
soft drinks. A higher proportion, 37 per cent, comes from its fast food
chains (Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC - formerly Kentucky Fried Chicken),
which suffered badly from price competition in the second quarter, and
another 28 per cent comes from its Frito-Lay snacks business.
Another reason for the profits difference is their geographical spread. In
the US, Pepsi's market share is almost as big as Coke's, but worldwide,
Pepsi trails behind. About 80 per cent of Coca-Cola's total operating
profits come from outside the US, while PepsiCo's beverage division earns
less than 16 per cent of its operating profits from other countries. The
result is that Coca-Cola is cushioned from the effects of competition in the
US, while PepsiCo is relatively exposed.
Even so, neither Coca-Cola nor PepsiCo can afford to ignore US consumers'
changing tastes. In the past few years, an increasingly health-conscious US
public has shown signs of turning away from high-sugar soft drinks such as
Coke and Pepsi. At first, the trend was towards diet (low-calorie) versions
of the same drinks. But now the fastest area of growth is an ever-expanding
variety of 'natural' drinks and so-called New Age beverages, such as fruit
juice drinks and iced teas. A driving force behind the trend has been
Snapple Beverage, an upstart US drinks manufacturer that has rocketed to
public prominence through rapidly rising demand for its New Age drinks,
which include Raspberry Iced Tea, Amazin' Grape Juice and Mango Madness
Cocktail.
This phenomenon has prompted a revolution at Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.
Realising they cannot resist the market trend, the two companies have
decided to join it. Both are diversifying away from their core brands and
are launching new products that do not even carry the Coke or Pepsi names.
Coca-Cola, for example, sells a range of iced teas under the Nestea brand in
a joint venture with Nestle, the Swiss food group, while PepsiCo sells iced
teas under the Lipton name in a joint venture with the Thomas J. Lipton tea
company, the US subsidiary of Unilever. In March this year, Coca-Cola
launched a range of New Age fruit drinks in the US under the Fruitopia
brand, with names such as Raspberry Psychic Lemonade and Grape Beyond; and
earlier this month PepsiCo said it was forming a joint venture with
Starbucks Coffee, a fast-growing US specialty coffee company, to launch a
range of ready-to-drink iced coffees in bottle or cans under the Starbucks
name.
These days, both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo make no attempt to disguise their
willingness to spread into other kinds of soft drinks. PepsiCo acknowledges
that some of the fastest-growing product categories are outside its
traditional soft drinks business, and talks of its all-out effort to become
a 'total beverage company'. Mr Sergio Zyman, chief marketing officer of
Coca-Cola, said at the time of the Fruitopia launch in March that the
company planned to increase both the speed and frequency of its product
launches to meet changing consumer demands, 'aggressively addressing growth
opportunities wherever they exist'.
But while this approach may give Coca-Cola and PepsiCo a stake in the growth
sectors of the soft drinks market, are their cola businesses in danger of
withering under an assault from own-label brands?
Private-label colas have been around for decades, but in the last few years,
manufacturers have improved the flavour and packaging of their products.
Consumers are nowadays switching away from branded goods if they can get
acceptable quality at a lower price from own-label products.
Earlier this summer PepsiCo suffered a fall of 2 per cent in operating
profits from its soft drinks business. It turned out that Cott, the
fast-growing Canadian maker of low-cost, store-branded foods and drinks, had
quietly been signing up US store groups as customers.
This came only a few weeks after Coca-Cola, the US maker of Coke, had taken
a drubbing from Cott in the UK. When Cott started supplying J. Sainsbury,
Britain's biggest food retailer, with cans of own-label cola that looked
like Coke but sold at about half the price, Coke's share of Sainsbury's cola
sales initially slumped from 63 per cent to 33 per cent.
Yet even Royal Crown Cola, the US company that supplies cola syrup to Cott,
says the threat to Coke and Pepsi has been exaggerated. Mr John Carson, RC
Cola's chief executive, says recent inroads by own-brand colas have been
limited to grocery store chains and discount stores, and even there they
have come largely at the expense of earlier private-label products.
'Private-label is definitely a thorn in Coke and Pepsi's side. It's real and
they can feel it. But it's not a threat,' Mr Carson says.
Cott also tends to play down the implications of its recent triumphs - with
good reason. Cott is a minnow compared with Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, and it is
painfully aware that it would be unlikely to survive retaliatory action if
it came to an outright cola price war.
Industry analysts say own-label products will continue to be an irritant to
Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, but not much more. Most of them think any adverse
effects on the companies' sales from private-label competition - or, indeed,
from an increasing proliferation of alternative beverages - will be more
than outweighed by the opportunities for growth in developing countries and
recently opened markets such as eastern Europe and China.
While some of these markets may be less profitable than those in developed
countries, particularly during the costly start-up phase, their sales
potential is immense. At present, consumption of soft drinks outside the US
averages four gallons per person per year. Inside the US, the figure is 49
gallons.
PepsiCo, more heavily exposed to the US market and less focused on soft
drinks than Coca-Cola, is regarded by Wall Street as less well placed to
benefit. But own-label products and New Age beverages notwithstanding,
industry observers say it is much too soon to suggest that the growth is
about to end for either company. Jesse Meyers, publisher of US trade
magazine Beverage Digest, says their brands are strongly embedded in the
global psyche. 'I fully anticipate that when Virgin Atlantic Airways flies
to the moon, we will be able to get off the plane and drink a Coke or a
Pepsi,' he says.

   Coca-Cola Co., which stalked out of India 11 years ago, is knocking on the door again. 

   Coke applied for permission to build a $3 million wholly owned plant in an export-processing zone near Delhi. 
The facility would produce substances needed to manufacture Coke concentrate. 
As much as 25% of the product could be sold in India, while the rest would have to be exported, to meet Indian regulations. 

   The Atlanta-based cola giant's move could foreshadow a turf war on the subcontinent since it follows by just two months rival PepsiCo Inc.'s announcement that it was starting a $17 million joint venture in India -- 39.9% owned by Pepsi -- despite tough restrictions imposed by the Indian government. 
Beyond that, the drive into India, with its 800 million people, appears to be an attempt by Coke to keep Pepsi from one day owning the Indian market. 
Coke currently outsells Pepsi by about 3.6 to 1 outside the U.S. 

   "I don't think Coke would like Pepsi to have exclusivity in that large a market," said Lee Wilder, an analyst at Robinson-Humphrey Co. 
A spokesman for Pepsi, based in Purchase, N.Y., declined to comment on Coke's application. 

   The soft-drink industry is growing at a healthy 5% rate in the U.S., but it is expanding at about 16% elsewhere, said Jesse Meyers, publisher of the newsletter Beverage Digest. 
"India is high on everybody's target list," he said. 
"Soft drinks are going to be an important part of the Indian subcontinent." 

   Indians drink about 2.4 billion bottles of name-brand soft drinks a year. 
Although that's a small number on a per-capita basis, industry analysts estimate the market is growing at 20% annually. 
Neither Coke nor Pepsi products are being sold in India. 

   A Coke spokesman said the company believes its application complies with Indian regulations, but he refused to speculate about how long it might take before a decision is handed down. 
The only American cola maker selling in India said that could take time. 

   L. Edward Shanks, president and chief operating officer of closely held Double-Cola Co., said: "Take nothing for granted in India. 
This I am sure will be a big political issue, regardless of how well Coke has its ducks lined up." 
Double-Cola, which commands only about 1% of the U.S. soft-drink market from its base in Chattanooga, Tenn., set up franchises in India in 1987. 
It took the company six years to negotiate its entry. 

   Coke left India in 1977, after being there 27 years, when the government ruled that foreign companies couldn't own more than 40% of their Indian subsidiaries. 
The ruling would have required Coke to turn over the formula for its concentrate to its Indian partners. 
But, cola company officials said, the investment environment has improved recently for American companies and new rules make operating in the export-processing zone attractive. 
Coke, for example, could import key ingredients for its Indian production, thereby maintaining the secrecy of its concentrate formula. 

   Coke said that if its application is approved, production earmarked for domestic use could be sold to an Indian company that would produce finished concentrate, which could then be sold to Indian bottlers. 
Coke might want to hold a stake in any concentrate-completing company, the spokesman said. 

   While India is a huge potential market, analysts don't expect any operations there to affect Coke's earnings anytime soon. 
"India won't affect earnings estimates for the next three years, but it could be in the top 10 markets in the next 15 years," said Ms. Wilder.

<TEXT>
   Coca-Cola Co. has been stuck with 20 million
pairs of 3-D glasses ever since the last episode of ``Moonlighting''
was nixed last spring by the writers' strike. It says it just found
a super way to use them.
   The soft drink giant, the National Football League and NBC
announced Monday they would cooperate in a three-dimensional
broadcast of the 12-minute Super Bowl XXIII halftime show and a
45-second Diet Coke ad next month.
   The Atlanta-based company said its bottlers would distribute the
special glasses, which will enable fans to see the 3-D approach,
with purchases of Diet Coke in the two weeks before the Jan. 22
contest for the NFL championship.
   Coca-Cola ordered the glasses earlier this year after agreeing
with the ``Moonlighting'' producers that a commercial and a portion
of the final show of the 1987-88 season would be shot with the new
3-D technology.
   But the episode was canceled after the writers went on strike and
the Coca-Cola commercial never was made. Production of the glasses
was halted at 20 million and they were stored while Coca-Cola looked
for other TV showcases.
   Network executives said the halftime program would be the first
live 3-D broadcast on network television, and would continue NBC's
tradition of innovation in football coverage. NBC broadcast a
``silent minute'' to give viewers a break from the Super Bowl
pre-game show in 1986 and aired an entire regular season game with
no announcers a few years ago.
   Viewers will need the glasses to get the 3-D effect, but a new
technology called Nuoptix 3-D, developed by Terry Beard, founder and
head of the Los-Angeles-based Nuoptix Associates Inc., leaves the
picture normal for others.
   The patented process avoids the distortion or double-imaging of
the picture that the 3-D processes of the 1950s caused for those
without special glasses.
   Not content to let a volley sound in the cola wars without
responding, Pepsi-Cola Co. announced separately Monday that its Diet
Pepsi brand has agreed to be the official sponsor of NBC's NFL
player talent show to be broadcast before the big game. The talent
show will match NFL players in competition as singers, dancers and
comedians.
   Calling the announcement ``a surprise move,'' Pepsi's executive
vice president of marketing and sales, Michael Lorelli, said ``Diet
Pepsi's end-run on Diet Coke just signaled the start of an intense
off-the-field battle.''
   Asked about Pepsi's announcement at the news conference where he
announced the deal with Coca-Cola, NBC Sports executive producer
Michael Weisman said the network had not settled sponsorship of the
pre-game talent show.
   But a Pepsi spokesman, Tod MacKenize, insisted that Pepsi-Cola
had returned a signed contract to NBC last week and that the deal
was done.
   Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, and Pepsi-Cola, based in Somers,
N.Y., dominate the $43.2 billion U.S. soft drink business.
   Diet Coke is the best-selling diet soft drink and the third
biggest seller overall with about 8.2 percent of the overall soft
drink market. Diet Pepsi ranks second in the category and fourth
overall at 5.2 percent.
   The two soft drink giants are always on the lookout for splashy
new ways to boost anticipation of their commercials and get big
audiences for them.
   Michael Beindorff, vice president for advertising at Coca-Cola,
said he had been aproached with dozens of opportunities to showcase
a 3-D commercial, but rejected them until the Super Bowl opportunity
came along.
   ``This is not just a few minutes or a couple of special
effects,'' Beindorff said. ``It's not just pre-game fluff or a
post-game throwaway.''

   PepsiCo Plans Extensive Ad Campaign
   To Contest Coke's Overseas Dominance

   LOS ANGELES -- After toiling for decades in the shadow of
Coca-Cola Co.'s world-wide soft-drink dominance, PepsiCo Inc.
is planning its most concerted and aggressive catch-up
campaign ever.
   Gathering bottlers here from all parts of the globe for
its first ever international convention, Pepsi announced
plans to spend more than $1 billion over the next five years
to upgrade plants, improve distribution and bolster marketing
programs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company also outlined a strategy to target certain
fast-growing market segments -- including diet soft drinks,
and fountain and vending machines -- that are still in such
an infant stage abroad that even Coke has no commanding
advantage yet.
   Pepsi estimated that such moves will more than double its
overseas soft-drink volume by 1995 to five billion cases from
about two billion currently.
   "Pepsi can close the gap against Coke internationally just
as we did here in the U.S.," Christopher A. Sinclair, the
newly appointed president of Pepsi's international business,
said.
   Pepsi's optimism, however, was met with some skepticism by
industry observers. With Coke's more than 2-to-1 market-share
lead in the international arena, analysts said it's unlikely
that Pepsi can significantly close the gap abroad overnight.
   Moreover, although Pepsi said its $1 billion budget is
"substantially" more than it has invested in the past,
industry observers said Pepsi will probably have to spend
substantially more if it ever hopes to catch Coke.
   In 1989, Coke had about $4.8 billion in revenue from
overseas, while Pepsi had $1 billion. Coke estimates its
international market share is 47% while Pepsi's is less than
half that.
   "I think they're going to have a tough time catching Coke
really soon," said Gary Hemphill, editor of Beverage Industry
magazine. "At the same time, there's so much growth
internationally that there's room for both of them out
there."
   While U.S. soft-drink volume has slowed to about a 3%
annual growth rate recently from 4% to 5% in the 1980s, the
international market is expected to grow in 8% to 10% leaps
annually for years to come.
   "This meeting acknowledges where the soft-drink industry
is really headed: offshore," said Jesse Meyers, publisher of
Beverage Digest, a trade newsletter. "While Coke has a
substantial lead, there are still unplayed cards in Southeast
Asia, Russia, and now Eastern Europe."
   A Coca-Cola spokesman dismissed Pepsi's plans to match
Coke overseas as "dreaming."
   The Pepsi convention seemed like an orchestrated attempt
to rally overseas bottlers and to convince them once and for
all that Pepsi is committed to the soda business abroad.
Under the crush of Coke's global strength, some Pepsi
international bottlers have felt neglected, particularly as
PepsiCo has plunged hundreds of millions of dollars into
building its snack and restaurant businesses abroad.
   The company even flew out D. Wayne Calloway, PepsiCo's
chairman and chief executive officer, to address the troops.
Saying the bottlers' efforts were critical to PepsiCo's
success, Mr. Calloway promised to send each a share of the
company's stock to mark their relationship.
   Pepsi also gave its international partners some new signs
of hope. In May, Pepsi expects to open its first plants in
India, a giant market of 800 million consumers where Coke was
recently denied approval to sell soft drinks. And in the
Soviet Union, where Pepsi currently outsells Coke, Mr.
Sinclair said he expects to soon announce "an agreement that
will be the largest consumer products venture ever" in that
country.
   Mr. Sinclair conceded that Pepsi still needs to clean its
international house. Taste quality of its soft drinks varies
from country to country, packaging graphics are inconsistent
world-wide, and production inefficiencies have resulted in
partially filled bottles ending up on store shelves abroad.
   To help put an end to such basic problems, Pepsi will be
issuing a "Look Book," a manual on how to acquire and use the
best graphics available. The company plans to centralize
advertising-copy approval under its top creative executive in
the U.S., and it is launching the Pepsi Cola International
Management Institute to teach overseas managers the best
techniques in sales, finance and plant operations, among
other things.
   All of this comes on the heels of a corporate
reorganization late last year in which Pepsi reversed its
centralized approach, creating six geographic operations
world-wide with broad local autonomy.

<HL> Pillsbury's Burger King Unit Is Expected
To Renew Its Cola Contract With PepsiCo

   Burger King Corp. is expected to announce today that its restaurants will continue to sell Pepsi-Cola soft drinks, industry sources said. 

   The renewal of the contract with Purchase, N.Y.-based PepsiCo Inc. ends one of the year's hardest fought battles in the continuing cola wars between the soft-drink giants PepsiCo and Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. 

   A Burger King spokesman declined to comment, but the Pillsbury Co. unit has scheduled a news conference for this afternoon in Miami. 

   Coca-Cola, which last October snatched the Wendy's International Inc. fountain sales account away from Pepsi, had hoped to score another win with the nation's second-largest fast-food chain. 
Coca-Cola has made the case that chains, such as Burger King and Wendy's, shouldn't use Pepsi at their fountains because it would be in effect supporting a competitor. 
PepsiCo is the parent of Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. 

   The account represents only 2.5% of Pepsi's total domestic volume and is expected to contribute "well under" two cents a share to PepsiCo's expected 1987 earnings of $2.20 a share, according to Emanuel Goldman, an analyst with Montgomery Securities. 

   But retaining the account is an important matter of prestige for Pepsi, which trailed Coke in market-share gains recently and has had some egg on its face in the marketing arena. 
A long anticipated ad campaign featuring pop star Michael Jackson has yet to appear, and Pepsi has suffered some from an unexpected surge in the popularity of Coca-Cola Classic. 

   A Pepsi spokesman declined to confirm or deny the contract renewal, but said: "This has been an arduous process. 
We've laid it all on the line. 
Our reputation is at stake." 

   Burger King's sticking with Pepsi keeps Coca-Cola's lead in fountain sales from getting any wider. 
Coca-Cola currently has an estimated 59% share of the market, compared with Pepsi's 25%. 
It also may help blunt Coca-Cola's argument with other fast-food chains that they should abandon Pepsi. 

   Coca-Cola had the Burger King account until 1983 when Pepsi won the five-year contract that expires early next year. 
It is expected that Burger King played off the two rivals to get itself favorable terms. 
"Burger King is in the catbird seat. 
Burger King will have the best soft drink contract that they've ever had or could ever imagine having," said Mr. Goldman of Montgomery Securities. 

   Coca-Cola continues to enjoy a significant lead in total soft drink market share. 
According to Jesse Meyers' Beverage Digest, Coca-Cola currently has a 37.2% market share, up 0.4% from a year ago. 
Pepsi has total market share of 30.6%, down 0.3%. 

   PepsiCo's stock closed yesterday in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $39.50 a share, up 50 cents. 
Coca-Cola's stock closed on the Big Board at $49.625 a share, up 87.5 cents.

   ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Co. lost a major contract to
archrival PepsiCo Inc. to provide soda-fountain service to
Marriott Corp. after Coke refused to lend Marriott "$50
million to $100 million," according to an internal Coke memo.
   The March 5 memo was written by Charles S. Frenette,
senior vice president of Coca-Cola USA. It offers a rare peek
at some of the hardball negotiations involved in the fiercely
competitive quest for major soft-drink-fountain contracts. It
also offers a glimpse of just how bold some of the soft-drink
customers' demands have become.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Marriott is a hotel and food-service chain that provides
food services for its own 600 hotels and about 2,300
restaurants and kitchens at schools, businesses, hospitals
and other institutions.
   The memo said "Marriott requested that Coca-Cola USA
provide them a $50mm to $100mm loan, at below market interest
rates in return for a continued supplier relationship. In
effect they were asking us to become a `banker.'" The memo
also speculated that one of the reasons Pepsi won the account
was that it had, in effect, agreed to lend Marriott the
money.
   A Coke spokesman confirmed the memo's authenticity and
said it was distributed to numerous staff members in its
fountain operation after it learned that it had lost the
coveted account -- one of its top 10 fountain contracts -- to
Pepsi.
   PepsiCo officials were angered by the memorandum. A
PepsiCo spokeswoman, citing the confidentiality of customer
contracts, refused to confirm or deny whether a loan was part
of its own deal with Marriott. She added, however, that
Coke's speculation about Pepsi "is grossly inaccurate and
irresponsible" and based on hearsay.
   For its part, Marriott would say only that its previous
contracts with Coca-Cola had included certain "economic
considerations" as did Coca-Cola's most recent failed bid for
the contract. A Marriott spokesman said the PepsiCo contract,
too, contained "economic considerations." He wouldn't be
specific about what those considerations were. "We feel that
the Pepsi contract was economically a more advantageous deal
for our clients and for Marriott," he said.
   The flap underscores that the fountain business has become
the most competitive segment of the soft-drink industry in
recent years.
   "The entire fountain area is the trench warfare of the
so-called cola wars," said Jesse Meyers, publisher of
Beverage Digest, a trade newsletter. The battle has become
especially fierce in recent years as Coca-Cola has gone on
the offensive, luring such big-name accounts as Burger King
and Wendy's away from Pepsi.
   The soft-drink giants have increasingly bent over backward
to win accounts, at various times granting customers not only
marketing rebates, but management training, equipment, market
research and even some marketing support and promotional
payments, according to those who work in the industry. But
those people said that loans -- particularly on below-market
terms -- are unheard of. "Never in my life have I heard of
something like this," said Mr. Meyers.
   Pepsi, based in Purchase, N.Y., said its contract with
Marriott "covers a number of divisions and a number of
products." Under the multiyear agreement, Pepsi said, it will
not only become the primary supplier of fountain soft drinks
for Marriott, but also will expand sales of its Frito Lay
snack foods in the Marriott outlets. The deal also includes
plans for Pepsi to set up restaurant operations, such as
Pizza Hut kiosks, at Marriott food courts in such places as
college campuses. Pepsi did have some of the Marriott
business previously, but Coca-Cola had the vast majority of
it. The Marriott business meant about $2 million in annual
profit to Coke, according to industry estimates, but may mean
much more than that for Pepsi, which will provide a broader
range of products.
   Coca-Cola doesn't intend to give up. It said it now
intends to court Marriott's individual customers, such as
schools and hospitals, and try to urge them to stick with
Coke products. In his memo, Mr. Frenette said Coke "has
prepared a detailed attack plan designed to assist us in
keeping the majority of this business."
   Marriott, based in Bethesda, Md., has been strained by the
slump in travel and the real estate downturn, which has made
it difficult for it to sell hotels it has built. The
debt-laden company has halted construction, cut jobs and
taken other measures to improve cash flow.
   Marriott posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $54 million,
or 57 cents a share, including an $88 million charge, on
$2.54 billion in sales. It said operating profit rose 10% in
the fourth quarter, excluding divestitures, write-offs and
reserves. In February, Marriott received a $150 million line
of credit from a group of banks. A Marriott spokesman said
that that contingency fund could increase to $400 million.

<HL> Diet Coke or Pepsi? TV Cannot Decide So Both Are Picked --- Networks to Run Conflicting Ads Saying Each Cola Is Tops After Taste Tests </HL>

   It looks like a draw in the latest taste-test skirmish between PepsiCo Inc. and Coca-Cola Co. 

   The NBC and CBS television networks have studied the companies' research data and concluded this week that the archrivals can run conflicting commercials claiming taste superiority for their Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi soft drinks. 
ABC-TV is still investigating the claims, but sources say it too is likely to let both ads run. 

   Television viewers may end up confused, but network executives say they had little choice in going with the admittedly undesirable solution to the continuing cola conflict. 

   "It's generally good for the credibility of advertising for there to be just one superiority claim," says Matthew Margo, vice president for program practices at CBS. 
"In fact, there should by definition be only one superiority claim. 
But even though we invested a considerable amount of time in examining and reexamining Coke's and Pepsi's consumer research, we couldn't find any fatal flaws." 

   Says another TV executive: "We've tried like hell to poke holes in these tests, but taste is such a subjective thing." 

   The competing taste-test commercials began running in late June. 
Each company immediately challenged the other's claims in complaints filed with the three major networks. 
Pepsi's ad features boxer Mike Tyson and proclaims Diet Pepsi the undisputed champion. 
The Diet Coke commercial counters that it's "the winner and still champion." 

   The networks aren't the only watchdogs involved in this chapter of the cola wars. 
The Massachusetts consumer affairs office is beginning its own investigation of the Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi claims. 
"I saw the commercials and did a double take because they're saying completely opposite things," says Edgar Dworsky, director of consumer education. 
"We thought that maybe somebody played with the statistics and that we should look into it." 

   The networks' decision could blunt the sales impact of the taste-test ads, which would be most damaging to Pepsi. 
It had hoped its spots, touting the improved taste of its reformulated brew, would help reduce Diet Coke's commanding lead in the fast-growing market for diet cola. 

   "The networks have decided to let consumers decide the issue, and that's just fine with us," says Coke spokesman Randy Donaldson. 
"Consumers long ago decided Diet Coke was their favorite one-calorie soft drink." 

   Tod MacKenzie, a Pepsi spokesman, says the company feels "vindicated by the networks, but we're disappointed that Diet Coke's claims weren't shot down." 
Now, he adds, "we'll be telling people to go out and taste Diet Pepsi for themselves." 
This summer, the company's bottlers are setting up taste-test booths at shopping malls, county fairs and other thirsty locations. 

   Besides the taste-test claims, Pepsi is also upset about the Diet Coke commercial's disparaging statement that Diet Pepsi has been reformulated several times. 
"It makes us sound inferior," Mr. MacKenzie says, "and yet Diet Coke has been reformulated at least as many times as Diet Pepsi." 

   Coke says NBC has asked it to delete the controversial reformulation line from any future taste-test ads and that it will comply with that request. 

   The taste test fuss has also caused a little wording change in the Diet Pepsi spot on ABC. 
Although the network is still studying the two companies' research data, it asked that the phrase "undisputed champion" be dropped from the Diet Pepsi commercial, since Coke, at least, disputes that claim. 
So in the new ABC version of the ad, Diet Pepsi is merely declared "the winner and new champion."

   Burger King, in Big Blow to Pepsi, Is Switching to Coke

   In a major coup, Coca-Cola Co. swiped Pepsi-Cola Co.'s
biggest fountain customer, the No. 2 fast-food chain, Burger
King Corp.
   In an industry where executives like to characterize
market-share battles as "one drink at a time," Coke is taking
a big gulp. Burger King, with 5,400 restaurants in the U.S.,
represents at least $270 million in lost business annually
for Pepsi, according to Jesse Meyers, publisher of trade
newsletter Beverage Digest. Coke will now have a lock on the
nation's two largest fast-food chains, Burger King and
top-ranked McDonald's Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Even more important, Mr. Meyers estimates, Burger King
accounts for about 18% of Pepsi's fountain business, which
was already far overshadowed by Coke's. Pepsi's next three
biggest customers are chains owned by its parent PepsiCo
Inc.: Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
   It's that troika, the largest collection of restaurants in
the country, that industry executives believe ultimately led
Burger King to dump Pepsi. In recent years, Atlanta-based
Coke has hammered away at its central argument that fast-food
chains shouldn't use Pepsi at their fountain spigots because
that, in effect, supports a competitor. In a swipe at Pepsi,
a Coke sales brochure for restaurant managers asks: "Is your
soft-drink supplier satisfying your customers' hunger instead
of their thirst?"
   For its part, Burger King considers Pepsi's ownership of
rival chains only one factor in its decision to switch, says
a spokeswoman for the Miami-based chain, which was acquired
by London-based Grand Metropolitan PLC in January 1989. "We
looked at the whole package that Coca-Cola offered," she
says.
   The five-year deal includes a price discount -- Burger
King calls it a volume incentive program -- that "rewards
incremental volumes of syrup gallons sold over a base level."
Figures weren't disclosed. The Burger King spokeswoman
wouldn't say whether Pepsi had had a similar plan. The
agreement also includes a commitment by Coke to work on what
the chain called a state-of-the-art dispensing system to
which Burger King would eventually convert. Moreover, in what
could be a multimillion-dollar boon for Burger King, Coke
will contribute to the chain's cooperative advertising and
marketing effort.
   Burger King, which already serves Coke products overseas,
switched to Pepsi from Coke six years ago. But as part of
"vendor reviews" ordered by the chain's new management,
Burger King officials approached both soft-drink companies
earlier this year looking for a better deal. "We asked them
to submit a proposal on what they could offer us for the
1990s," the spokeswoman says.
   The loss of Burger King is a major blow to Pepsi's image
and the second such loss this year. Wendy's International
Inc., which had been involved in a lengthy legal dispute with
Pepsi over Wendy's soft-drink contract, said it plans to put
Coke in its company-owned restaurants when its Pepsi contract
expires at year end.
   With the loss of Burger King, Pepsi's share in the
soft-drink fountain market drops to about 21% from more than
26%, according to Beverage Digest. Coke's share rises to 65%
from about 60%.
   "For Pepsi, this is a big morale loss, as well as a
revenue loss," says Leenie Ruben, president of Marketing
Spectrum Inc., a market research company. "Coke will really
be controlling the fountain business with the two largest
chains."
   A Pepsi spokesman downplayed the loss. "It was not
unexpected, given the management changes that Burger King has
been going through," he said. He estimated that Burger King
accounted for about 2.4% of Pepsi's U.S. soft-drink volume
and "nominal" profit.
   Coke is getting Burger King's business at a fortuitous
time. Sales at the fast-food chain are rebounding. Moreover,
Coke's fountain business, which accounts for about one-third
of its domestic sales, has been sluggish as a result of
softness in the restaurant industry.
   The switch to Coke from Pepsi, which is based in Purchase,
N.Y., will begin in about 30 days. It may not be completed
before the summer in what Burger King said would be a
region-by-region conversion. The spokeswoman wouldn't
disclose how the chain would announce its change in soft
drinks to customers.
   Pepsi's contract with Burger King included a 60-day
cancellation clause, which Burger King said it exercised
yesterday.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Pepsi shares fell 50 cents to close at $65.75, and Coke
shares rose 50 cents to close at $76.75.

   The lemon-lime business is turning sour. Seven-Up Co.
filed a bitterly worded lawsuit against Coca-Cola Co.,
claiming that the cola company has been spreading lies about
Seven-Up's business in an unlawful quest to persuade certain
bottlers to drop Seven-Up in favor of Sprite.
   The lawsuit, filed in State District Court in Dallas
County, Texas, charges that Coke, which manufactures Sprite,
has embarked on a "Future Belongs to Sprite" campaign. That
campaign, according to the lawsuit, is disseminating "lies,
deceptions and misrepresentations" about its operations and
prospects to companies that bottle both Coke and Seven-Up
products.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Coke is doing so, the lawsuit contends, to persuade some
of the 74 independent bottlers that currently distribute both
Coke and Seven-Up products, to sever ties with Seven-Up.
Bottlers buy concentrate from Coke or Seven-Up, mix it with
carbonated water, bottle and can it, and distribute it in
retail outlets.
   The lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory damages and
punitive damages of at least $500 million.
   A spokesman at Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, said the
company hasn't seen the lawsuit and had no comment.
   The complaint underscores the interdependency of the large
soft-drink companies for brands and distribution, and how
their marketing interests can come into sharp conflict.
Independent Coca-Cola bottlers distribute about 7% of
Seven-Up's volume in the U.S.
   At the same time, Coca-Cola has been making a bigger push
into the lemon-lime market, the second-biggest soft-drink
category after cola, with its own Sprite brand. And that push
has paid off. Combining regular and diet versions, Sprite
surpassed Seven-Up in 1988, and drove its lead in the
lemon-lime market last year to nearly 39%, according to the
Maxwell Consumer Report, a trade publication, compared with
31.4% for Seven-Up. Pepsi's Slice accounted for only 11%.
   "Coca-Cola has become a major factor in the lemon-lime
marketplace," says Jesse Meyers, publisher of Beverage
Digest.
   Indeed, the lawsuit argues that once Seven-Up is dropped
by a Coke/Seven-Up bottler, it is very difficult for Seven-Up
to remain an effective competitor in that franchised
territory. The consequence of that is a weaker Seven-Up,
which is already highly leveraged, and less soft-drink
selection and higher prices for consumers, the lawsuit said.
   Seven-Up charged that last March, Coca-Cola approached the
Nacogdoches Bottling Co. in Texas, giving it material with
false and misleading information about Seven-Up. In January,
the Nacogdoches bottler said it planned to cancel its
contract with Seven-Up, ending a 20-year relationship.
Seven-Up said Coke is making similar presentations to other
independent Coke bottlers in Texas and around the country in
an attempt to interfere unlawfully with Seven-Up's contracts
and business relationships.
   Seven-Up said it is asking the court to enjoin Coke from
engaging in additional unlawful conduct.
   Bottlers said that Seven-Up filed the lawsuit because it
so depends on the reach of Coke's distribution systems to get
its products to consumers. "They're fighting to stay with
Coke," said one bottling company executive.
   Seven-Up, based in Dallas, is a unit of Dr Pepper/Seven-Up
Cos.

   ATLANTA -- After decades of bruising battles with PepsiCo
Inc., Coca-Cola Co. is being distracted by a somewhat smaller
rival: W POP.
   A store-brand soft drink, W POP hit shelves last May in 45
New York stores belonging to Wegmans Food Markets Inc.
Launched with TV spots, billboards and store signs, W POP was
soon walloping Coke and Pepsi, with a capital W.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Today, the upstart W POP outsells both Coke and Pepsi in
Wegmans stores. By how much? "Let's just say our swing in
share is the kind of stuff that catches the eye of the
national brand companies," says Marty Gardner, Wegmans brand
manager. Sure enough, W POP so unnerved Coca-Cola that the
No. 1 soft-drink company formed a private-label task force in
Atlanta several months ago to figure out how best to compete
with a growing array of store-brand drinks.
   Private-label soft drinks -- the bargain-basement-brand
knockoffs the cola giants once shrugged off -- are on a tear.
In the year-long period ended in mid-September, sales of
store-brand drinks rose nearly 10%, twice as fast as overall
soda-pop sales in supermarkets, according to Nielsen
Marketing Research. Between 1989 and 1991, private-label soft
drinks had their biggest three-year jump in market share in
at least two decades, says Beverage Digest; that share grew
nearly a full point, to 8%. Looking at total market share,
Beverage Digest shows that Pepsi has fallen 0.2% over the
past three years, while Coke has gained 0.7%.
   The emergence of the store brands, industry executives and
consultants say, is likely to affect pricing and product
strategies at Coke and Pepsi more than ever before. And
though store beverages normally thrive in recessions, they
may now be building long-term staying power through economic
recovery and beyond because of big improvements in taste and
graphics, as well as increasingly powerful retailers and more
value-conscious shoppers.
   "They are a force whose time has come," says David
Goldman, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Adds Tom Pirko,
president of consulting company Bevmark Inc., "If it ever
sets in among many people that these beverages are as good as
Coke and Pepsi, that will become a very big issue for the
cola giants."
   For their part, the cola giants insist publicly that the
future isn't nearly so ominous. They note that private-label
products are still a fairly small part of the $46 billion
soft-drink market, and they add that their tiny rivals are
simply getting a momentary boost from the recession. "We
don't see them as any huge threat," Donald R. Keough, Coke's
president, told a recent stock-analyst conference.
   "This is an image business," adds Michael Weinstein,
president of A&amp;W Brands Inc., the root-beer maker. "There's
probably a limit to the number of people who want to walk
around sipping a can of Wal-Mart cola."
   But that hasn't stopped Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and other
retailers -- who think consumers are searching for greater
value -- from introducing their own colas. Wal-Mart, the
nation's largest retailer, launched Sam's American Choice
colas nationally late last year. The red-and-white cans,
which resemble those of Coke, bear a message saying, "We
believe these products . . . offer better value than the
leading national brands." Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co.'s
big A&amp;P chain is close to introducing new store-brand
beverages. And Kmart Corp. has recently had talks with
private-label companies to explore developing its own drinks.
   Retailers believe there's gold in those cans. Even though
the average store brand sells at about a 35% discount to the
regular-priced national beverages, it can still be more
profitable. Store brands can generate gross profit margins of
as much as 30%, says David Litwak, senior editor of
Supermarket Business magazine, while a Coke or Pepsi might
fetch only about 21%. "That difference is what attracts many
stores," he says.
   A Pepsi spokesman acknowledges that retailers are
"developing their own private-label portfolios to boost
loyalty to their own stores." But he argues that products
like Pepsi and Coke are more profitable for stores when their
higher volume and turnover are taken into account.
   Still, it's stories like those out of Ontario, Canada,
that have electrified retailers. Since Loblaw Cos. grocery
chain introduced its President's Choice cola in Ontario in
June, the chain has boosted its cola market share in its 135
stores to more than 50% from around 10%. President's Choice
is "sweeping incredibly fast," says David Nichol, president
of Loblaw's product-development division. "When there is no
difference from a performance point of view, people aren't
willing to pay the premium for Coke and Pepsi."
   All this could strain the relationship between the cola
giants and retailers. Coke's private-label task force, for
instance, has wrestled with a difficult strategic issue: How
to compete with a store-brand cola, like W POP, without
upsetting a Wegmans, which doles out the shelf space and
end-of-aisle displays. Put another way, says Jesse Meyers,
publisher of Beverage Digest newsletter, "The consumer may
decide what goes off the shelf, but the supermarket first
decides what goes on it."
   With no clear rebuttal to the success of private-label
colas, Coke and Pepsi appear to be taking another tack:
pushing their lower-profile flavored drinks. One Coke
marketer says the company has contemplated plans to test
market its Fanta fruit-flavors line with lower prices to
attack private-label drinks. A Coke spokesman says the plans
for Fanta probably won't be pursued because Fanta is an
important name-brand product, particularly overseas. (The
spokesman also downplays the private-label study, saying
there are always internal groups evaluating competition.)
   As for Pepsi, it recently began selling Slice
fruit-flavored drinks at reduced prices in several cities,
although a spokesman says that was more to meet price
competition in flavored sodas than to fend off private
labels.
   Store brands' growth could hurt profit margins at the big
cola companies' bottlers, or distributors, whose profit
margins already have been squeezed by several years of price
slashing. The price wars of the 1980s helped restrain
private-label growth, even during the previous recession
early in the decade, beverage consultants say. Now both
companies would like to raise prices, they say, to boost
their struggling bottlers' financial health. But, warns one
former Coke manager, "Coke and Pepsi are taking some big
chances if they raise prices, and the {private label} brands
don't follow."
   For the cola giants, private labels have become a bigger
concern because sophisticated smaller manufacturers seem to
be closing the taste gap. In 1984, taste-test research by
Consumer Reports found that the odds of people liking a
name-brand soft drink better than a store-brand were 4 to 1.
But when the magazine revisited the issue last summer, it
found that the store brands tasted just about as good as the
Big Two and advised readers just to buy the cheapest cola
available. It used to be that private-label brands were
"really all dishwater, and not even great dishwater," says
Mr. Meyers of Beverage Digest.
   Cott Corp. of Toronto is currently the hottest supplier of
private-label drinks. Working on formulations with DWG
Corp.'s Royal Crown Cola Co., Cott supplies soft drinks to
Wal-Mart and Wegmans, among others. Cott even tailors
specific cola flavors to closely resemble, say, Coke's taste
in markets where people prefer Coke. The improved technical
quality of the drinks is erasing retailers' reluctance to
promote them. Says Wegmans' Mr. Gardner: "We felt for the
first time that we had the extracts and formulations that
surpassed Coke and Pepsi."
   Private-label companies are also betting that the cola
leaders' traditional strengths -- image and brand loyalty --
are weakening amid price cutting and consumers' focus on
value. "Promotion definitely erodes loyalty," says Mr. Litwak
of Supermarket Business. Adds Loblaw's Mr. Nichol: "People
don't fall for all that image stuff anymore -- that they'll
be `with it' depending on what they drink."

   The declining presence of coffee in American
diets has marketers scrambling for ways to attract younger drinkers
and to expand in overseas markets.
   The impact of the decades-long slide in U.S. coffee drinking was
highlighted Wednesday when Maxwell House announced plans to close a
50-year-old coffee roasting and grinding plant in Hoboken, N.J.
   The company, a division of Philip Morris Cos.' Kraft-General
Foods International, blamed declining consumption for the move.
   Americans drank an average of 1.75 cups of coffee per person
last year, down from a peak in 1962 of 3.12 cups per day, according
to the London-based International Coffee Organization. The
organization represents coffee-producing countries such as Brazil
and Colombia.
   ``People are moving from hot, acrid drinks to sweet, cold
drinks. I think they will continue to do so because of our
lifestyle. People don't want to sit around blowing on coffee or
tea,'' said Jack Maxwell, an industry analyst for Wheat First
Securities Inc.
   In 1962, nearly 75 percent of Americans drank coffee regularly,
according to the coffee producers' group. By 1988, the percentage
was 52.5 percent. And the fraction of people aged 20 to 29 who
drink coffee fell from 80 percent in 1962 to 35 percent last year.
   ``I think it really has more to do with the quality of the
coffee, which has not been as high in the last 20 years,'' said
Steven Gregg, marketing director for the organization's Coffee
Development Group. ``And it's an image problem. Coffee has not been
marketed to younger people as soft drinks have.''
   The collapse last July of an international coffee-price treaty
briefly slowed the decline in consumption, said Celeste Georgakis,
a commodities analyst for Cargill Investor Services Inc. The
futures market price fell at that point from $1.20 a pound to 68
cents, although it since has rebounded to the 86-cent range.
   ``Even that did not stimulate consumption, because the younger
generation has turned to soft drinks,'' Ms. Georgakis said.
   Soft drink makers have been working to exploit declining
interest in coffee by trying to win a place on breakfast tables.
Pepsi-Cola Co. last year began test marketing in Waterloo, Iowa,
for Pepsi A.M., which has more caffeine than regular Pepsi but less
than coffee.
   ``A.M. has been going well,'' Pepsi spokesman Tod MacKenzie
said, although he said the company hasn't decided whether to market
the product nationwide. He also said the company was testing
advertising that pitches regular Pepsi as a morning drink in Fort
Wayne, Ind.
   For several years, market leader Coca-Cola Co., has provided its
bottlers with advertising for use at their discretion that promotes
``Coca-Cola in the morning.''
   Gregg said his group is trying to attract younger drinkers by
promoting flavored coffees and unusual blends.
   ``Over the last five years, growth rates for specialty coffees
are estimated at 15 to 25 percent a year,'' Gregg said. ``We're
particularly doing a lot with iced coffee. We're seeing a lot of
success with local entrepreneurs and some of the larger companies
getting into iced coffee products.''
   Overseas, where the coffee market still is growing, Maxwell
House is introducing new instant coffees in Europe and has formed
joint ventures with Japanese and Korean food companies, Maxwell
House spokesman Richard Collins said.
   ``In China, we have a small business. A few months ago, we
introduced 100 percent Colombian coffee,'' Collins said.
   Philip Morris also has agreed to buy the Swiss company Jacobs
Suchard, the world's third-largest chocolate and coffee group, for
$3.8 billion.
   Among the largest coffee marketers, Philip Morris, whose brands
include Yuban, Master Blend and Sanka as well as Maxwell House, is
tied for leadership of the market with Procter &amp; Gamble Co.'s
Folgers brand.
   Wheat First's Maxwell estimates each held about a 32 percent
share of the $3.9 billion U.S. coffee market last year.
   Nestle held a 13.5 percent share of the market with its Hills
Brothers and Chase &amp; Sanborn brands, according to Maxwell. All
other makers, including Chock Full O' Nuts and Butternut, totalled
22.2 percent of the market.
   ``I think the big guys are going to continue to do well. There
are a lot of others who are disappearing, and they are a large
percentage of the total,'' Maxwell said.

   Coca-Cola Co., in a move to spark growth in a declining
soft-drink category, said it is launching nationally a
reformulated version of its cherry Coke and diet cherry Coke.
   Called "fountain style," the Coke drinks were revamped to
give them more cherry flavoring. Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta,
said it began testing the drinks last fall in seven cities.
Volume, measured in case sales, rose more than 50% on average
in those markets after the new cherry Cokes were introduced,
the company said.

   Cherry-flavored soft drinks, whose fruity, sweet taste
appeals to youths, were hot several years ago. Cherry 7-Up,
for example, made a smashing debut in 1987, achieving almost
a 1% share of the enormous soft-drink market overnight.
   But the cherry beverages, which tend to be faddish, have
fallen out of vogue recently. Last year, cherry Coke's case
sales fell 14%, and diet cherry Coke's dropped 20%, according
to the Maxwell Consumer Report, a trade publication. Cherry
7-Up's case sales were off 25%.
