<HEAD>3-Year-Old Can Recite Greek Alphabet, Read At Second-Grade Level</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUTCHINSON, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troy and Trina Kinast have to watch what
they say around their 3-year-old son.
   Seth Kinast, according to his parents, can already recite the
Greek alphabet, say the English alphabet forward and backward,
count in Spanish, German and English, read at a second-grade level,
identify countries on a globe, recite the books of the New
Testament and keep up with adult conversations.
   Seth began saying ``Mommy'' and ``Daddy'' at about 8 months. At
16 months, he named the letters of the alphabet. At 22 months, he
read magazine headlines at a grocery store, the Kinasts said.
   The couple read books to the unborn child because they heard it
could stimulate letter and sound recognition. After Seth was born,
they read or sang to him as they rocked him to sleep.
   ``Now we read to him before naps and bedtime,'' Kinast said.
``He has a stack of books by his bed, and he reads to himself.
Sometimes at 11:30 p.m., we have to tell him to quit, but he always
says, `Just one more.'''
   More than 800 books line the shelves in Seth's bedroom.
   Recently, Seth and his grandmother were getting ready to play
``Sorry!'' when his grandmother realized she didn't have her
glasses. Seth read her the rules from the game box, Kinast said.
   The Kinasts already have decided to teach Seth at home and
provide lessons in piano and organ. And they're beginning to teach
younger brother Nathan, 8 months old. Kinast is a math instructor
at Wichita State University; Mrs. Kinast stays home with the
children.
   He said he and his wife are not overdrilling Seth or forcing him
to learn things against his will.
   ``It's like a game,'' he said. ``He learned the ABC song, and
then we learned the letters backward by putting them to the song.
... When we doodle, we doodle shapes, letters and designs. When we
play hide and seek, we count in German.''

<HEAD>Unusual 3-Year-Old Kansas Boy's Abilities Attracting Wide Interest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It's been a whirlwind of activity for
Troy and Trina Kinast and their son Seth since people started
hearing about what the 3-year-old boy can do.
   Since last week, Seth has been in newspaper headlines and he's
been sought-after for network talk shows. Appearances are scheduled
with syndicated talk-show hosts David Letterman and Sally Jesse
Raphael.
   Seth is in demand because of his amazing ability to learn.
   He can count in three languages, recite the English alphabet
forward and backward and read at an upper second-grade level. His
parents say he has already mastered the Greek alphabet.
   ``We are just overwhelmed,'' Mrs. Kinast said of the numerous
telephone calls requesting interviews with her son.
   ``I feel like I am in a fog,'' said Kinast, just back a trip to
New York on Tuesday and Wednesday for an appearance on CBS' ``This
Morning.'' ``I don't think I have awakened yet.''
   The family was returning to New York for an appearance on the
David Letterman show on NBC on Friday.
   He said Seth stared, mouth agape, at New York's skyline and
played in the large back seat of the limousine that took them to
the airport.
   ``It was crowded,'' Seth said Wednesday after arriving home from
New York. He described the limo as the ``longest.''
   Mrs. Kinast said she and her husband never thought of their son
as a genius.
   ``We just took our time with him,'' she said. ``He is just a
normal 3-year-old kid full of orneriness.''
   Her husband said that because he and his wife are first-time
parents, they had no one to compare to Seth and were surprised by
all the attention.
   ``We have friends that have children Seth's age, and we didn't
see a whole lot of difference,'' Kinast said. ``When 3-year-olds
converse, the Greek alphabet and the names of shapes don't come
into play.''
   Seth has access to nearly 1,000 books and ``the computer is his
toy,'' his father said.
   Learning has become like playing.
   ``This is an everyday thing for him,'' said his mother. ``It is
just fun and games. We don't have a television, and Seth has to
play an active role instead of a passive role.''

   A 5-year-old died after his stepfather allegedly
beat him with a tree limb, a belt and his hands because the boy
couldn't recite the alphabet past ``G,'' authorities said.
   Dwayne Blocker, 24, was being held in the Cook County Jail today
on $150,000 bond, said a jailer who refused to give her name. He is
to be arraigned April 4.
   Blocker, who was indicted on murder charges by a county grand
jury Friday, admitted beating stepson Charles Moss because he could
only reach ``G'' when Blocked asked him to say the alphabet, said
police Lt. James Phelan.
   The boy's mother, Joyce Blocker, 21, was sick Wednesday and
Blocker picked up Charles from preschool, Phelan said.
   After the child could not complete the alphabet, Blocker
shouted, ``Do it again,'' the lieutenant said.
   ``Then he punched him several times, hit him with a belt several
times and then went outside and got a tree branch and struck him
several more times,'' Phelan said.
   After the attack, the boy ran upstairs to his mother's room,
said David Schneidman, a spokesman for the state Department of
Children and Family Services.
   Charles collapsed in the room, and the stepfather tried to
revive him, Schneidman said.
   The youngster, who died at St. Francis Cabrini Hospital, had a
broken arm, bruises on his leg and a solid bruise from the shoulder
blade to his buttocks, Schneidman said.
   ``When this guy said he became angry because the boy could not
get past the letter G, that sounds absurd, ridiculous,'' he said.
``But frankly, reasons like that are very common among child
abusers.
   ``In severe abuse cases, there are several things that can
trigger an incident,'' said Schneidman. ``The child's learning
ability is one of the common reasons. Others are eating habits and
toilet training.''
   Another child from the family, 1-year-old Jasmine Blocker, was
admitted to the hospital to check for potential abuse, Schneidman
said. The state has moved to gain temporary custody of her.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 15 (KCNA) -- A Pyongyang meeting 
was held at the Grand People's Study House Friday to mark the 
550th anniversary of the creation of Hunminjongum (Korean 
alphabet). 
  The meeting was attended by Yi Chong-ok, Politburo member of 
the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and 
vice-president, Kim Chung-nin, secretary of the Central 
Committee of the WPK, and officials concerned. 
  The Korean alphabet created on the basis of the Sinji 
letters 
which had been used by Koreans for thousands of years was 
proclaimed in 1444. 
  In his report at the meeting, Vice-premier of the 
Administration Council Chang Chol said the Korean alphabet is a 
set of national letters worthy of praise, which reflect the 
creative wisdom and resourcefulness of the Korean people, and a 
valuable asset and cultural heritage of the nation that holds a 
particular position in the development of written languages of 
the world. 
  Turning to the advantages of the Korean alphabet, Chang Chol 
said it is scientific theoretically and orderly in structure and 
system, it fully reflects the characteristics and richness of 
the sound and easy to learn and write. 
  "With the creation of the Korean alphabet, the Korean people 
came to have a means of writing suited to the national 
characteristics of the mother tongue and a powerful weapon in 
the cause of transforming nature and society," he said. 
  He recalled that during their occupation of Korea in the 
past, the Japanese imperialists forced the Koreans to change 
their names to Japanese style and speak and write in Japanese in 
everyday life in order to obliterate the Korean language and 
letters as well as the Korean nation. 
  "This was the most heinous crime never to be condoned and a 
beastly act without precedent in history," the reporter said. 
  "Under the wise guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song, darkness and illiteracy were dispelled, the 
anti-popular system of writing demolished and a new system of 
writing based on national independence established, so the 
Korean people, who were far removed from modern civilization, 
have become the true masters and users of the written and spoken 
languages," he said. "The idea and guidance of the great leader 
to develop the national language on the basis of chuche and 
improve it are being successfully carried forward by the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il today." 
  He said the treacherous acts of the Kim Yong-sam puppet 
clique to obliterate the mother tongue in league with the U.S. 
imperialists can never be pardoned because they are aimed at 
keeping the Korean nation divided into two forever. 
  "In order to smash the moves to obliterate the national 
language on the part of the U.S. imperialists and their stooges 
in South Korea, all the Koreans who love the country and the 
nation must rise as one in the struggle to prevent a permanent 
division of the nation and achieve a unified development, be 
they in the North or in the South or overseas, be they 
communists or nationalists," stressed the reporter.

<P>
The boy, Seth Kinast, will begin rehearsals Friday for a segment of "Baby 
Talk," the comedy based on the movie "Look Who's Talking," scheduled to debut 
on ABC in November. He'll play a student at a school for young geniuses. The 
3-year-old's reading skills and his abilities to recite the Greek alphabet and 
the English alphabet forward and backward landed him on David Letterman's

NEW MAYAN ALPHABET PROVOKES ANGRY LETTERS

<TEXT>
<P>
Almost 1,000 letters and telegrams from people in rural villages, mountains and 
valleys sit on Jose Sanic's desk at the Academy of Mayan Languages in Guatemala 
City. Many warn of serious consequences if a new alphabet for the country's 22 
Mayan languages changes the letters used to represent "w," "q" and "k." Sanic 
smiles wryly and says he is confident that the law will stick and that it is 
the beginning of a resolution to Guatemala's "Indian problem." 
</P>
<P>
Mayans, who prefer the term indigena (native) to Indian, are the majority of 
Guatemala's 8 million people. No more than 600,000 Mayans can read and write in 
any language at any level. In schools where teachers used Spanish, indigenous 
children were thrown into what Eliu Cifuentes, Guatemala's director of 
bilingual education, calls "a violent encounter with literacy, being taught a 
foreign language by a teacher who doesn't speak their tongue." 
</P>
<P>
With President Vinicio Cerezo's election in 1985, the government announced a 
radical change in policy. Spanish will remain the official language, but 
Guatemala will have at least 22 protected languages. As a symbol of its 
commitment to Mayan culture, the government published its new constitution in 
the languages of the four largest Mayan groups -- Mam, Kaqchikel, K'iche' and 
Q'eqchi'. 
</P>
<P>
The bilingual education program, begun as an experiment with funds from the 
United States Agency for International Development, includes 400 schools with 
bilingual classes up to the fourth grade. Cifuentes expects 260,000 students to 
be in the program this year. This would represent more than one-third of all 
rural primary school students. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of so many new readers and writers inspired activists to push for 
what they hoped would be a truly Mayan alphabet. Previous efforts to teach 
Mayan were hobbled by a variety of alphabets, most invented by Europeans and 
North Americans. Many used symbols not found on a typewriter or in a print 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the election, Mayans and their friends in Congress created the 
Academy of Mayan Languages within the Ministry of Culture and Sports. The 
academy's first project was to create a unified Mayan alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
During several meetings organized by the academy, most of the debate focused on 
the letters "w," "k" and "q." In the new alphabet, "w" represents sounds 
previously written with "cua," "gu," "qu" and "v." Sounds previously assigned 
to "q" and "k" in most alphabets were reversed, and the European "qu" has 
disappeared. The Aguacateca are now the Awakateka. The Quiche are now the 
K'iche' (the apostrophe indicates a glottal stop). 
</P>
<P>
Many find no fault with the new alphabet's method of equating one letter to one 
sound -- a generally accepted principle among linguists concerned about 
teaching. But debate over the new alphabet is only one part linguistic; it's 
also political and economic. 
</P>
<P>
At the academy, Sanic said, most of the mail on his desk comes from members of 
evangelical Protestant churches, which claim almost 20% of Guatemala's 
population as members. In many communities, evangelicals and their Mayan 
congregations have a large economic and public relations stake in materials 
published using earlier alphabets. 
</P>
<P>
Mayan activists say it is more important to seize the political opportunities 
than to worry about what they consider nit-picking. Virgilio Ajenal, director 
of the Assn. of Mayan Writers, contended: "The fight is mainly among 
intellectuals. . . . Ninety-nine and nine-tenths of all indigenous people are 
still illiterate, so they will not have to learn anything over." 
</P>
<P>
He said Mayans have listened to outsiders too long. "We don't want outsiders to 
think, to decide and to act for us." As for the value of the material already 
printed, most of it religious, he said: "The people in the countryside cannot 
eat those things." It is time to write practical, how-to-do-it things about 
agriculture and health, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Elliot, director of the Center for Mesoamerican Investigations in 
Antigua, said the need to get on with the new alphabet is exemplified by three 
proposals he received during a week in May. Each asked for help in publishing a 
dictionary of Kaqchikel, each in its own alphabet. "If the energy invested in 
opposing the alphabet were invested in promoting the transition, it would be 
over with," Elliot said. He sums up the debate saying, "It's a matter of what's 
important to us -- the past or the future." 
</P>
<P>
Cifuentes said the country is "trying to find a new national identity." The new 
alphabet is an important part of the process. "We are beginning to end the 
colonization of the language that began 400 years ago," he said.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Arts: Drawn to the alphabet - Patricia Morison admires the
letters in a very exclusive edition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has taken ten years and four more years of painstaking printing on iron
hand-presses, but the result is being hailed as a triumph. Ornamented Types
is a two-part limited edition of early 19th-century decorated alphabets
produced by Ian Mortimer of IM Primit of Hackney in London. Printed in a
limited edition of 200, copies of this masterly production of the printer's
art cost Pounds 1,650.
If that is beyond your means, for the next three weeks the alphabets can be
seen in the exhibition, Ornamented Types at St Bride Printing Library in
London.
St Bride Printing Library, owned by the Corporation of London, houses a
magnificent collection devoted to every aspect of the history and technology
of typefounding and printing. The Library has inherited the collection of 32
decorated alphabets, beautifully engraved letters on pieces of end-grain
boxwood. Apparently never used, they are extremely rare survivals.
Commercial type-foundries threw away quantities of old alphabets during the
decades when ornamented letters like these were rejected as 'Victorian'
rubbish. Only the Betjeman faction proclaimed its affection for the
fat-faced, slab-serif alphabets of the early 1800s. With their quaint
decorations, they were designed to appeal to a fairly unsophisticated public
and to stand out boldly on hand-bills, theatre-programmes, auction-notices
and stage-coaches.
The St Bride collection nearly perished when a wartime bomb destroyed the
premises of the Monotype Corporation, which bought them when the Caslon
foundry closed in 1936. However, James Mosley, librarian at St Bride,
succeeded in identifying the mysterious type as coming from the foundry of
L. J. Pouchee.
A little-known but intriguing figure, Pouchee was first a butcher and
coal-merchant. In the 1800s, he seems to have scented a killing to be made
in printing and set up a type-foundry. By paying printers more than
competitors offered, he succeeded in breaking their cartel. He also seems to
have invented the technique known as stereotype casting, in which wooden
original letters were 'dabbed' in hot metal and a cast was made.
Pouchee's ornamented alphabets show an exuberant vein of fantasy. Some are
laden with grapes, covered with swags of flowers, or made into naive
barnyard scenes with wooden-looking milkmaids and cows. Perhaps the most
splendid letters, several inches high, are covered in fashionable florists'
flowers; lilies, camellias, roses.
Most remarkable of all, however, is the Masonic Alphabet. Pouchee was a
freemason - indeed, the records of the Grand Lodge provided Mosley with much
of what he has succeeded in unearthing about Pouchee. Masonic dinners in the
1820s probably had menu-cards printed with his accurate evocation of 'the
Craft'. It is just one of the exhibition's intriguing glimpses of the
commercial and social world of Regency London, conjured up by Pouchee's
fantastical, fat, self-confident alphabets.
Exhibition until March 24 at St Bride Printing Library, Bride Lane, Fleet
Street, London; 071-353-4660.

Some consider the rapid adoption of the new alphabet a violation of human 
rights. A K'iche'-speaking senator, Diego Velasco Brito, lodged a formal 
complaint with Guatemala's attorney general for human rights. Abraham Garcia 
responded for the Assn. of Mayan Writers of Guatemala, a 10-year-old indigenous 
group that includes many teachers. He said the association had already begun to 
publish and teach the new alphabet. Its quarterly bulletin also uses the 
alphabet and, "to date, it has had a wonderful reception by readers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While a few proponents of the new alphabet worry about the evangelical 
preachers, they are disturbed by what they feel is professional opposition from 
the best-known organization of linguists, one that has translated most of the 
Christian materials used in evangelical churches as well as religious and 
secular material sold in the Mayan writers association's small bookstore. 
Linguists from the Summer Institute of Linguistics have done by far the largest 
amount of scholarly work on Mayan languages. Most of the dictionaries, school 
texts and books of Mayan stories published in indigenous languages bear the 
institute's imprint. 
</P>
<P>
Mayan activists say it is more important to seize the political opportunities

eat those things." It is time to write practical, how-to-do-it things about 
agriculture and health, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Elliot, director of the Center for Mesoamerican Investigations in 
Antigua, said the need to get on with the new alphabet is exemplified by three 
proposals he received during a week in May. Each asked for help in publishing a 
dictionary of Kaqchikel, each in its own alphabet. "If the energy invested in 
opposing the alphabet were invested in promoting the transition, it would be 
over with," Elliot said. He sums up the debate saying, "It's a matter of what's 
important to us -- the past or the future." 
</P>
<P>
Cifuentes said the country is "trying to find a new national identity." The new 
alphabet is an important part of the process. "We are beginning to end the 
colonization of the language that began 400 years ago," he said.

<HEAD>OK To Exclude W Through Z From Jury Pool, Court Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blacks, Hispanics and women can't be kept
off juries as a group, but it's OK to exclude people whose last
names begin with the letters W through Z.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 3-0 Wednesday that
jurors at the end of alphabetical order do not constitute ``a
recognizable and distinct class'' covered by court decisions
barring discrimination in jury selection. The claim was raised by a
man whose last name begins with a W _ William Jefferson Walker.
   He was convicted of aggravated assault and leaving the scene of
an accident in Pima County, Ariz., in September 1983 and sentenced
to 10 years in prison. For reasons not explained by the court, the
pool from which the jury was chosen included no one with a surname
starting with W through Z.
   Walker cited a psychologist's study, published in 1970, that
concluded people whose names started with letters from S to Z were
50 percent more likely than others to develop a condition called
``alphabetic neurosis.''
   The court noted that two other appeals courts have rejected
similar claims, one of them involving a jury made up entirely of
people whose names began with the letters T through Z.

If you are a writer -- or, for that matter, a reader -- nothing is closer to 
you than the letters of the alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
Hence the title of this charming little volume. Each and every letter of our 
alphabet is given a tidy two pages. One shows earlier versions of the letter in 
languages like Greek, Etruscan and Phoenician. The other offers fun facts to 
know and tell, such as the nugget that O has not changed since the beginning of 
the alphabet, while U is our newest letter, not coming into general use until 
the 1600s. Bet you didn't know that. Kenneth Turan

<LEADPARA>  THE ads are everywhere: Send away for Hooked on Phonics -- the "magical"
educational program set to music -- and learn to read.;   The sales pitch is a
smash hit. The cassette kits, at $179.95 a pop, are flying out of an Orange
County warehouse at the rate of 7,000 a week.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  HOOKED ON PHONICS SOUNDS GOOD, BUT DOES IT WORK?  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Education  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     With almost a half-million kits sold nationwide, Hooked on Phonics is one
of the hottest educational tools around. Its manufacturer, Gateway Educational
Products of Orange, says it is being snapped up about equally by adults with
reading problems and by parents of children having trouble learning to read at
school.;   It has clearly tapped into a huge market of people unsatisfied with
-- or unaware of -- the options available at schools and through literacy
programs.;   The debate over Hooked on Phonics, however, has become almost as
hot as its sales reports.;   Reading or rote-learning?; Supporters say that by
making learning fun, Hooked on Phonics makes reading more accessible to
everyone from young children to illiterate adults.;   Critics -- including
some of the nation's leading experts on reading -- argue that the
eight-cassette program doesn't live up to its billing. At best, they say,
Hooked on Phonics teaches only one aspect of reading -- the ability to sound
out words -- without teaching their meaning.;   What you get for your money:; 
 (check) Eight cassette tapes, with directions and drills set to a catchy and
rhythmic synthesized music background. An upbeat speaker leads users from
lessons on the alphabet, to lessons on the sounds letters make, to sounding
out words.;   (check) Nine sets of color-coded flashcards that go along with
the tapes. The first set is the letters of the alphabet. Other sets show
sounds letters make alone and when combined with other letters, and short
words.;   (check) Five workbooks, starting with simple words and ending with
full sentences.;   John Shanahan, president of Gateway and creator of the
program, said one of its greatest strengths is the music, which he said
stimulates the brain and makes the learning fun.;   Though Shanahan has little
statistical information to prove that Hooked on Phonics works, he does have
plenty of testimonials from adults and children who swear by the program.;   A
new, old-fashioned idea;   One satisfied user is Robert Pierce, 10, of Garden
Grove. Robert -- who appears in one of the product's commercials -- was far
behind his grade level in reading before he used Hooked on Phonics. Now he's
ahead.;   "When I started Hooked on Phonics, it wasn't easy," Robert said. But
eventually, he added, "I, like, started having fun.";   Robert said he liked
the music and liked using the flashcards. "I like reading now," he said.;  
Robert's father bought the program after hearing an ad on the radio. His
mother became such a fan she went to work for Gateway.;   Ironically, this new
program is being attacked because of its single-minded adherence to an old
strategy: phonics, the process of teaching the letters in the alphabet and the
sounds they make.;   Many experts now think phonics should be only one tool
used to teach reading. But Shanahan, 51, a boisterous Balboa resident and
former musician, said phonics is the only way to learn reading. He said the
greatest evidence of the success of the program is that its 30-day money-back
guarantee is used by fewer than 10 percent of his customers.;   When he
watches a 5-year-old on one of his promotional videotapes read sentences
haltingly from a book, Shanahan is delighted. And if the youngster doesn't
understand every word on the tape, Shanahan isn't bothered.;   "Is that
important at this point in his life?" he asked.;   Shanahan's critics,
however, would answer that it is. They say reading is much more than just
being able to sound out words -- it has to do with understanding the words.
The new guideline for teaching reading in California public schools, for
instance, stresses a "whole language" approach that emphasizes meaning over
sounds.;   Among the strongest critics of Hooked on Phonics is Jeanne Chall,
professor of education at Harvard University. In her report to the
International Reading Association, she criticized the kits for concentrating
solely on the sounds of letters rather than the meaning.;   Furthermore, she
said, there is no instruction given on how to blend the letter sounds once
they are learned.;   Literacy workers, too, have been critical, claiming the
free programs they offer illiterate adults are far superior to Hooked on
Phonics.;   Evelyn Renner, a field services director for Literacy Volunteers
of America in Anaheim, said the marketing raises false hopes. "The tapes are
being bought by adult readers who think they're going to learn to read in 18
minutes," she said.;   Shanahan, however, noted that literacy programs have
failed to reach millions of adults with reading problems who apparently find
their programs embarrassing or inconvenient, and want something they can use
at home.;   Julie Chan, a reading specialist with the Orange County Department
of Education, listened to the cassette program recently and came away with a
mixed review.;   Among the things Chan liked about Hooked on Phonics: the
repetition, the music, the narrator's voice and optimism and the incremental
nature of the program.;   But when Chan took the program home to be used by
her mother, who is literate in Chinese but not English, she found the
instructions frustrating.;   "If you can't get beyond the logistics, you can't
get started," Chan said.;   Chan said the program is better for some groups
than for others. Adult native-English-speaking illiterates would recognize
most of the words because they have large vocabularies. But children or
non-native speakers, who know the meanings of fewer words, could be left
clueless.;   Shanahan, however, insists the kit is great for everybody. "My
God," he said, "people need this."  </TEXT>

AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: IT'S LIKE KINDERGARTEN FOR MATURE ADULTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Sourik Avedissian met his tutor Monday afternoon in a sweltering classroom in 
south Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
In an hour and a half with her, he breezed through his ABCs, learned how to 
say, "My name is Sourik" and made her understand that he has two 
granddaughters, ages 4 and 9. 
</P>
<P>
He also managed to communicate more difficult ideas with hand signals, props 
and a few English words: He came from Iran on Dec. 17, 1988, by air. Back home, 
he worked in a shop, cutting wood on a machine. He drew a picture that looked 
like a band saw and demonstrated, adding a sawing noise with his tongue, how he 
would make seven precise cuts in whatever it was he manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
For now, that's all there is to know about Avedissian, except that he sits 
formally in a chair, dresses in an Old World way -- he wore an open brown shirt 
with a kind of key design -- has a letter tattooed on each finger of his left 
hand and seems pleased that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini is dead. He showed his 
feeling by drawing the side of his flattened hand across his throat. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, by the end of the semester, Avedissian will be able to tell wonderful 
tales to his tutor, Karen King. But first the two of them will spend many hours 
working over the plastic alphabet she bought at Pic 'N' Save. 
</P>
<P>
It's one of the primary tools of the English-as-a-second-language volunteer. 
King is one of about 60 volunteers who meet privately with recent immigrants 
enrolled in the non-credit program at Glendale Community College. It has 2,500 
students learning English at six sites around Glendale. About 100 are matched 
up with tutors. 
</P>
<P>
Like her students, she is middle-aged. She has a career, as fund-raiser and 
publicist for the St. Barnabas Senior Citizens Center near MacArthur Park. She 
tutors after work, on her way home to Eagle Rock. 
</P>
<P>
She became a volunteer on a whim. She saw a notice in the Glendale College 
bulletin and signed up for a 10-hour tutoring class. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it could be interesting," she said. "I went to the class and I was 
hooked." 
</P>
<P>
There is an offbeat appeal to what she does. It's like kindergarten for mature 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
Her class, which had two students Monday and may grow to as many as four, is 
for those who are at the bottom of Level 1. She calls it the minus Level 1 
group. 
</P>
<P>
"I get from that group the ones who need even more, more help," she said. "My 
goal is to get them into Level 2." 
</P>
<P>
King meets with the students Monday and Wednesday afternoons for 90 minutes at 
the college's Adult Learning Center, which opened this semester on Garfield 
Avenue near Chevy Chase Drive. The students also go to class three hours a day, 
four days each week. Some double up, taking six hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
King's goal is to teach speaking, reading and writing. 
</P>
<P>
"I put a little more emphasis on speaking because it is a survival skill," she 
said. "They want to know how to speak right now." 
</P>
<P>
She began the session Monday with the family tree, illustrated with stick 
figures drawn in red marker on a sheet of paper. 
</P>
<P>
King's other student, Vartoosh Alexanian, had done hers last semester and 
easily pointed out her four children and seven grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
King drew a male figure, representing Avedissian. Then she drew a female. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you have a wife?" 
</P>
<P>
"Ah, madame," he said, nodding. 
</P>
<P>
When Avedissian got tied up in the third generation, unable to explain whether 
his two sons each had a daughter or one of them had both grandchildren, 
Alexanian tried to interject a hint in Armenian. 
</P>
<P>
"Vartoosh!" King exclaimed in mock reproach. She gave her the sign to zip her 
lip. 
</P>
<P>
King then took the fluorescent-colored alphabet from a zip-lock bag. She spread 
the letters on a tiny table around which she and the two students sat. She 
asked them to organize the letters, which they did almost without help. 
</P>
<P>
Reading them was more difficult. Neither Avedissian nor Alexanian could 
differentiate entirely between the names and the sounds. 
</P>
<P>
"What is the name?" King asked, pointing to an M. 
</P>
<P>
"Ma," Avedissian answered. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the sound," she said. "Em." 
</P>
<P>
"Em," he would repeat. 
</P>
<P>
King finally stopped the exercise short of perfection when fatigue and 
confusion seemed to interfere. 
</P>
<P>
The triumph of the day was with the personal possessive pronoun, though they 
didn't call it that. 
</P>
<P>
"What is my name?" King asked Avedissian. She beckoned with her upturned palm 
to indicate she wanted him to answer. 
</P>
<P>
"My name is Kara?" he said gravely. 
</P>
<P>
King turned to Alexanian, who smoothly handled "my," "your" and "his," though 
she sometimes dropped the verb. 
</P>
<P>
Avedissian tried again and got it almost right. 
</P>
<P>
"Good, you did it," King said. 
</P>
<P>
She urged them both to practice at home. Alexanian laughed bashfully and made 
an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
"Busy," she said. "Home much busy. Children, vacuum, wash, cook. . . ." She 
struggled for another word. 
</P>
<P>
King pantomimed and had her repeat a new word, ironing.

<LEADPARA>  WHY DOES THE ALPHABET ON THE telephone start on the 2 digit rather than on the
1? And why aren't the letters Q and Z used?;   LONG AGO, THE PHONE SYSTEM WAS
REally primitive. How primitive was it? So primitive that, instead of buttons,
they had "dials." This was some kind of circular configuration with holes for
your fingers corresponding to the numbers. Hard to believe, but true.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  West  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  THAT'S WHY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Anyway, when you dialed the 1, it sent out a pulse, a single clicking sound
(a 2 was two clicks, etc.). According to Chuck Starnes of Bell Laboratories in
Indianapolis, the fussy old switching equipment at the phone company could
easily get confused, and mistakenly think that a random clicking noise on the
line was someone trying to dial a number beginning with 1. Thus a rule was
made: No phone number can start with 1. This rule is still observed, though
solely for the sake of tradition -- you now dial 1 to get access to the long
distance network, and this doesn't cause any confusion for the modernized
equipment.;   Now for the alphabet. It's there to help you remember numbers.
This was particularly necessary in the old days, when phone books weren't as
common as they are now. People incorporated letters into their numbers, with
the letters often standing for a place name. Instead of 555-5000, the number
would be labelled KL-5-5000, which would be relayed orally as "Klondike five,
five thousand.";   Since phone numbers couldn't start with 1, Ma Bell didn't
want to put the ABC there. So the alphabet started with 2. Unfortunately, the
0 was reserved for "Oper," so there was space for only 24 letters, not 26.
They bumped the rarely used Q and the Z.;   The real question is, what should
we say now instead of "dialing the number"?;   Beeping the number?;   Stabbing
the number?;   The perfect word, unfortunately, is already taken:
"Prestidigitation."  </TEXT>

'ALPHABET OF BONES' GIVES NEW MEANING TO MOVEMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
To Joyce Cutler-Shaw, the art of communication is as easy as ABC. What sets the 
San Diego-based visual artist apart from the pack is her own alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
"I developed an alphabet of bones," she said in an interview from her home last 
week. "It's an original calligraphy with 26 characters, each with an alphabetic 
equivalent in the English language. But it's really a visual dance with an 
embedded symbolic code. When I was developing the calligraphy of bone, I was 
interested in the relationship between dance and movement." 
</P>
<P>
That fascination led her to seek out kindred spirits -- San Francisco-based 
dancer/choreographer Nancy Karp and local composer Chaya Czernowin. 
</P>
<P>
Their three-way collaboration produced "From the Alphabet of Bones," a 
full-length work that translates Cutler-Shaw's original calligraphy into 
movement and voice. The interdisciplinary performance piece will premiere at 8 
p.m. Thursday through Sunday at Sushi's downtown gallery space. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're all really doing is developing parallel languages," said 
Cutler-Shaw, whose haunting representational drawings of the skeletal forms of 
birds were the catalyst for this ambitious undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
"I was interested in the possibilities of parallel languages when I developed 
my calligraphy of bone," she said. "Nancy (Karp) had done a book of graphic 
notation, and I saw certain parallels in her work. 
</P>
<P>
"I had (written) a text and translated it into bone. Then Nancy developed a 
vocabulary of 26 movements for a visual alphabet, and responded in dance terms 
to the text. Chaya interpreted vocal equivalents to the alphabet of bones." 
</P>
<P>
"I composed the music only from seeing the text in bone," Czernowin said during 
a break from rehearsals. "I was not interested in the meaning -- only the 
graphics. I gave every letter a sonic gesture that I could interpret in many 
ways." 
</P>
<P>
As Karp explained in a telephone interview from the San Francisco Bay Area last 
weekend: "I found myself fascinated with the structure. In the alphabet of 
bones calligraphy, each character is part of a configuration of figures. It's a 
wonderful device. I came up with more than 26 different movement phrases, and 
then we chose the ones that worked for the piece." 
</P>
<P>
Karp created more than 26 distinct phrases for the duet section of the dance, 
performed by longtime Karp company dancers Deirdre Carrigan and Diane McKallip. 
</P>
<P>
"If each dancer used the same phrases for every letter, they'd be doing unison 
dancing all the time," Karp said. "So we had to make sure that one dancer's A 
was not the same as the other's. Sometimes they come together, but it's a very 
elaborate system, because there are so many variations." 
</P>
<P>
The performance piece was designed to be sequential in structure, rather than a 
continuum of simultaneous stimuli, according to Cutler-Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
"It weaves through a sequence of presentations," she said. "When the dance 
portion is over, I come in and take over with the speaking part of the text. 
And when I finish, Chaya sings the text." 
</P>
<P>
Connecting all the elements -- dance, story and sonic gestures -- are 
Cutler-Shaw's graceful graphic images. 
</P>
<P>
"Joyce made beautiful characters," said Karp, "and the calligraphy will be 
projected to create the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the lighting designer (Craig Wolf of San Diego State University) 
asked us to wear light-colored costumes to heighten the effect when the dancers 
pass through the light projections," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Into Flight" -- the section Cutler-Shaw recites and Czernowin sings in "From 
the Alphabet of Bones" -- has a serious message as its subtext. 
</P>
<P>
"We're dealing with issues of survival and evolution -- from the reptile to the 
bird to human and perhaps into the humane," Cutler-Shaw said. The bird imagery 
"is a symbol and a metaphor for environmental concerns. It's about 
transformation. We have to be much more responsible. We have to change our 
habits. And artists are mediums for that kind of thing -- the conveyance of 
illumination." 
</P>
<P>
Separated as they were by distance, collaborating on this "visual dance" was a 
challenge for Cutler-Shaw, Karp and Czernowin. But with help from a California 
Arts Council grant, and plenty of stubborn determination, their vision has 
reached fruition. 
</P>
<P>
"It was difficult, with me in San Francisco and the others in San Diego," Karp 
said. "I've been down to San Diego to meet with Joyce and examine the space, 
and Joyce has taken several trips here -- and we've been on the phone a lot. 
But it's been very interesting. Joyce and I have a different way of looking at 
the aesthetics, but it's been a real pleasure juxtaposing movement in a 
different way." 
</P>
<P>
"The most exciting new works are those that break down boundaries between the 
arts," said Cutler-Shaw. "We all have individual voices, but working together 
makes our own voice that much more distinct."

<TEXT>     The notes can be in English -- that is, the Roman alphabet -- or in either
Greek or Hebrew. Pressing one key changes the alphabet. It's something of a
shock to see Greek or Hebrew characters appear on the screen.;    Of course,
the three alphabets are not identical, but the programmers have done the best
they could. In Greek, for example, the "alpha" character appears when you
press "a," "beta" for "b." However, for "theta" the "q" key has to serve.;   
You can use GreekTools as a set of electronic flashcards, or you can construct
tests from them, edit them, add more to increase the vocabulary and tag sets
of words to concentrate on or to print out to study away from the computer.
The printer, by the way, must be compatible with Epson dot-matrix or H-P
LaserJet machines to produce the Greek or Hebrew alphabets.;    There is also
a terse summary of the grammatical material covered in two years of
college-level Greek, a catalog of manuscripts, information on textual
criticism that should have been better proofread, and a stripped-down word
processor for making notes.;    The manual is clear, and an accompanying book,
"Learn New Testament Greek," by John H. Dobson, helps those for whom
GreekTools is the first exposure to the language.;    The program requires a
computer with at least 512 kilobytes of working memory and MS-DOS 2.11 or
later. It comes on either 5 1/4-inch or 3 1/2-inch disks and may be installed
on a hard disk. Its retail price is $49 and it may be ordered by calling (800)
223-6925. GreekTools is an example of the kind of software not ordinarily
treated in general-interest publications, even those that focus on computers.  </TEXT>

After 10 years on the front lines of performance art, Sushi is still ferreting 
out the new and different. 
</P>
<P>
"From the Alphabet of Bones," the first of seven dance-oriented events included 
in Sushi's multi-faceted 10th anniversary season, illustrates that search. In 
this serious study of parallel languages, which premiered at Sushi's 
second-story loft space Thursday night, even the basic alphabet is unique. 
</P>
<P>
The birth of cutting-edge artworks can be painful and there is no guarantee 
that the entire concept will work, or that individual elements will meld into a 
unified whole. "From the Alphabet of Bones" is a noble failure, a project that 
strives for brave new worlds but suffers from its own esoteric pursuits and 
diversity of spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Translating textual or visual material into movement and voice is not new. But 
visual artist Joyce Cutler-Shaw, choreographer Nancy Karp, and composer Chaya 
Czernowin definitely moved into uncharted territory when they attempted to find 
equivalents to Cutler-Shaw's calligraphy (a symbolic language based on the 
fragile skeletal structure of birds) in music and dance. 
</P>
<P>
Their common purpose apparently was to call attention to environmental 
concerns. Cutler-Shaw's bird imagery, seen as light projections on the floor 
and backdrop, was selected as the metaphor. 
</P>
<P>
However, instead of integrating the individual elements and creating some sort 
of coherent entity, the artists offered their individual voices as a string of 
disparate parts. The effect was a baffling whole that seemed to have been 
assembled with scissors and paste pot. 
</P>
<P>
The sequence began with a dance version of the bone alphabet, then evolved into 
a spoken text written and recited by Cutler-Shaw. It culminated in the 
disembodied sound structures created and sung by the composer. 
</P>
<P>
According to the program notes, "the sequence from A to Z represents a journey 
and reads as a visual dance." But that journey was long, labored, disjointed 
and often incoherent. 
</P>
<P>
The fascinating bird imagery that inspired the three-way collaboration failed 
to achieve its potential of providing strong visual support. Although the 
artist lined the back wall of the theater with an ominous assortment of caged 
birds, the stage was bare. And the projections on the floor and backdrop never 
revealed the power of some of the artist's original work. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the spoken and sung texts were too protracted and visually 
unexciting to be theatrically viable by themselves. Cutler-Shaw's poetic 
recitation of the story of evolution and her impassioned evocation of 
"unspeakable acts" (a joint reference to the Holocaust and the destruction of 
wildlife) were moving but isolated from the rest of the performance. 
</P>
<P>
Also isolated were Czernowin's primordial wails and hisses, an often 
heart-wrenching vocabulary of wordless sounds that recalled the ear-piercing 
sonic structures of post-modern pioneer Meredith Monk. 
</P>
<P>
Monk suggests that the voice is a tool for activating, remembering and 
discovering "pre-logical consciousness." Czernowin used her voice to achieve 
this effect, but the musical portion was oppressively long and visually static. 
Perhaps that was part of its message, but an active visual or kinetic thrust 
was sorely needed. 
</P>
<P>
Karp, a San Francisco-based choreographer, communicated the bone alphabet first 
as a solo dance for herself and later as a duet for Deirdre Carrigan and Diane 
McKallip. If Karp and her dancers were interpreting an alphabet, it was not 
obvious. The rhythmic flow of interesting abstractions suggested, but never 
mimicked, the movement of birds. 
</P>
<P>
The dance was lyrical -- the lightest element in a dark work -- ending with a 
painful plea for survival. The environmental sounds by Bill Fontana that 
accompanied both dance episodes were another plus. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually these three talented artists may be able to use their newly created 
alphabets to explore the theme of survival with more theatricality. For now, 
however, "From the Alphabet of Bones" is a flightless bird waiting for a chance 
to soar. 
</P>
<P>
The performance will repeat at Sushi Performance Gallery at 8 o'clock tonight 
and Sunday.

Not content with one begging letter, the Turks have just come up with five
in the hope of persuading the rest of the former Soviet Union's quintet of
Turkic states to join Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan in abandoning Cyrillic
notation in favour of Roman script.
Turkey's decision to increase the alphabet by the five new letters is a
historic gesture. It is the first such change since the western reforms of
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1928 when the Turks themselves adopted the Roman
script in place of the Arabic used under the Ottomans.
The additions, agreed after a four-day conference in Ankara, represent
sounds already voiced in the dialect of Turkish used in the republics.
Besides an additional e (written as a backwards E), the letters are a w, an
x, a q, and an n with the reverse of a French circumflex over the top.
As an added incentive to join the alphabetical alliance, Turkey is offering
the republics printing machinery and substantial technical assistance.

<HEAD>Court Rules on Miranda Issue in Pennsylvania Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled today that police in
Pennsylvania did not violate the rights of a man suspected of
drunken driving by failing to read the motorist his so-called
Miranda warnings soon enough.
   The justices, by a 7-2 vote in an unsigned opinion, agreed with
Pennsylvania law enforcement officials that a lower court wrongly
required police to warn motorists of their right against
self-incrimination.
   Relying on a 1984 ruling, the court said that ordinarily when
police stop a motorist they are not required to give the Miranda
warnings because the motorist is not in custody.
   The motorist ``was not entitled to a recitation of his
constitutional rights prior to arrest, and his roadside responses
to questioning were admissible'' as evidence, the court said.
   Justices Thurgood Marshall and John Paul Stevens dissented.
   Thomas A. Bruder Jr. was stopped in Newtown Township, Pa., the
morning of Jan. 19, 1985, by a police officer who said Bruder was
driving erratically.
   The officer said Bruder was swerving back and forth across the
highway. He said that after stopping his car and emerging, Bruder
had difficulty maintaining his balance.
   The officer asked Bruder if he had been drinking and Bruder
replied in the affirmative. The policeman also asked Bruder to
recite the alphabet, a task the officer said Bruder performed
poorly.
   After that, Bruder was arrested and warned that he had a right
to a lawyer, to remain silent and that anything he said could be
held against him.
   A judge found him guilty of driving under the influence of
alcohol and sentenced him to a term of 48 hours to six months in
jail.
   A three-judge state court overturned the conviction last year,
ruling that Bruder was entitled to the Miranda warnings earlier.
   The state court said Bruder was entitled to the warnings before
being questioned by the police officer, even though he had not been
arrested formally.
   Bruder had good reason to believe he was not free to leave and,
in effect, was in police custody when stopped, the state court said.
   ``The test of custodial interrogation is whether the individual
being interrogated reasonably believes his freedom of action is
being restricted,'' the state court said. ``Undoubtedly, (Bruder)
was not free to leave when he made the statements elicited.''
   Also, the state court said, requiring Bruder to recite the
alphabet was akin to taking testimony from him, and should not
occur before he was read his rights.
   The state court contrasted the recitation with taking a purely
physical test for sobriety _ such as walking a straight line.
   ``We view the recitation of the alphabet as essentially
communicative in nature,'' the state court said. It said Bruder
could be retried, but his pre-Miranda statements and testimony
about reciting the alphabet must be excluded.
   Pennsylvania law enforcement officials said the state court
ruling violates a 1984 Supreme Court decision that permitted police
to question motorists without giving the Miranda warnings.
   The high court said in the 1984 case that the vast majority of
roadside detentions last only a few minutes and are conducted in
public. Generally, the court said then, the motorist feels he will
be permitted to go on his way and is not completely at the mercy of
the police.
   The Pennsylvania state court said the 1984 decision does not
rule out the possibility that in some cases police, even prior to
arrest, must warn motorists of their rights before questioning them.
   The case is Pennsylvania vs. Bruder, 88-161.

<P>
If you want to call the whole thing off, language buff and activist Ted W. Culp 
probably would tell you to wait becuz victori is inevitabel in this linggwistic 
endevor. 
</P>
<P>
Culp is the president and founder of the Internasional Union for the Canadian 
Langwaje, which campaigns for reforming English into Canadian -- he says 
Canadean -- as an international language. 
</P>
<P>
"Half the battle is already won because people know that reformation needs to 
be done," he said. "There's a universal recognition that there's a problem with 
the English language." 
</P>
<P>
Culp declined to say exactly how many people belong to his admittedly small 
organization, but he insists that he has members and contacts scattered around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
And, if you're wondering why a reformed English should be called "Canadean" -- 
well, why not? 
</P>
<P>
"All the other languages of the world are linked to a nation," Culp said. "When 
they're linked to a nation, it removes any sense of fear. The world needs an 
international language, but it needs one that's rational." 
</P>
<P>
Talking over coffee at a neighborhood fast-food restaurant, Culp detailed why 
he thinks the soft "c" in English should be changed to "s" as in "sentense," 
why Czechoslovakia should have been changed long ago to Checkoslovakia, why 
"Fast as Flite" on trucking slogans reads just fine to him and why the large 
American toy-store chain should change its name to "Tois Ar We." 
</P>
<P>
He puts out regular nuzeletters and has started a small nuzepaper, The Times Ov 
Toronto, that has made it through three four-page issues. 
</P>
<P>
"We urj all owr reeders tu abandon the obsolete, anoying english langwaje, and 
tu adopt the emerjing, rasional canadean langwaje," an editorial calling for 
linggwistic chanj said. "It iz so eezi. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Culp, a gray-haired secondary-school teacher, said he always was interested in 
language and created his Canadian in 1987, the centenary of the artifical 
language Esperanto that had been touted as the way to an international 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no sense creating a language that no one speaks," he said of Esperanto 
and its late founder, the Polish philologist Ludwig Zamenhof. "That's the fatal 
weakness from which it will never recover. . . . It was just the wrong 
strategy." 
</P>
<P>
"Canadean," on the other hand, would take advantage of the prominence of 
English as an international language but make it easier for foreigners learning 
English who often are confused by its spelling and grammar. 
</P>
<P>
"Using the world's No. 1 language, you can read and understand this," he said. 
"In 'Canadean' you must say what's there." 
</P>
<P>
Culp said the rules for Canadian appeal to those who have problems spelling as 
well as those with scientifically educated minds who prefer their systems to be 
rational. The increasing use of computers and computer languages can only help 
the move to develop a more rational language, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the rules for "Canadean" are an alphabet with 25 letters, eliminating "q" 
from the current Latin-English alphabet; the addition of a verb "tu must," as 
in "yu must tu work," and the elimination of all silent and extra letters. 
</P>
<P>
Culp conceded that his language work would have to be developed over the long 
term. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a tendency to linguistic conservatism," he said of those reluctant to 
change. "People say it's the richness of the language, but it's very rich 
nonsense."

<HEAD>Party Chief In Soviet Moldavia Endorses Nationalist Demands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party chief in Soviet Moldavia has
endorsed demands by Moldavian nationalists to make their language
official and use the alphabet of neighboring Romania.
   Thousands of demonstrators rallied in recent weeks in the
republic's capital, Kishinev, to demand official status for the
Moldavian language and introduction of a Latin alphabet, used for
the otherwise identical Romanian language.
   Despite attempts by the Russian Czars and Soviet authorities to
align Moldavians with Russia, Romania has long maintained that
Moldavians are really Romanians in language and culture.
   Party leader Semyon Grossu went on the western republic's
television Friday and condemned the activists for going too far, but
he indicated support on the language issue, according to the
official news agency Tass.
   ``Working out the conception of the Moldavian state language is
envisaged, as well as studying problems in connection with the
transfer of written Moldavian to the Latin alphabet,'' Tass
paraphrased Grossu as saying.
   He said preparation is under way on a series of draft laws on the
status of the Moldavian language, Tass reported.
   Moldavians have long objected to the Soviet insistence that they
use the Cyrillic alphabet, the one used for Russian, for their
regional language. They say they prefer the Latin alphabet used for
Romanian.
   The republic of 4.2 million people has had a history of foreign
domination. Known as Bessarabia under the Turks, it was annexed by
the Russian Czars from the Ottoman Empire in 1912. Romania seized
the area in 1918 and ruled it until the Soviet Union took it over in
1940.
   The following year, Romanian troops reoccupied the region. The
Red Army reclaimed it in 1944.
   In the television broadcast, Grossu condemned the recent
nationalist demonstrations, saying they were unsanctioned and that
their organizers ``stir up fright and emotions,'' Tass said. He
called the protests an example of ``extremism, demagoguery and
irresponsibility.''
   Under Mikhail Gorbachev, nationalism has blossomed in many parts
of the Soviet Union, especially the Baltic republics of Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania.
   Gorbachev has allowed greater autonomy for the republics in
cultural, economic and linguistic affairs. Activists have used his
policy of glasnost, or openness, to vent long pent-up national
grievances.

IT'S NOT DEAD YET; 
</P>
<P>
YIDDISH IS THE COMMON LANGUAGE NOWHERE ON EARTH, BUT IT'S THE MOTHER TONGUE FOR 
SOME JEWS SEEKING THEIR ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yiddish has been dying a slow death for at least 50 years, but lovers of the 
Jewish language of Eastern European villages and East Coast immigrant slums 
still cling to the mame-loshn, their mother tongue, even in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
They go to literary lectures, informal discussion groups, classes and 
songfests. Orthodox Jews sometimes debate the Talmud in Yiddish. Old people on 
bus benches in Jewish neighborhoods gossip in the language of their youth. And 
a small but growing number of younger Jews who grew up speaking English are 
turning to Yiddish studies. 
</P>
<P>
This much activity might have surprised the pioneers of the Los Angeles Yiddish 
Culture Club, who drew up a 50-year charter when they staged their first 
evening of tea and cake in 1926. Even then, Yiddishists were worried that 
America would prove rocky ground for their transplanted tongue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Number Unknown 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-three years later, the club still stages a formal program every Saturday 
night from October through June at the Institute of Jewish Education on 3rd 
Street in the Fairfax District, but no one knows how long it will last. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, no one really knows how many Yiddish speakers there are -- either in 
Southern California, home to an estimated 700,000 Jews, or in the world at 
large. 
</P>
<P>
"While the use of the language as a primary vernacular has been declining, 
interest in it, both sentimental and seriously intellectual, has been rising," 
says the Jewish Encyclopedia. "(T)he measurement of the present knowledge of 
Yiddish . . . requires tools far subtler than those of ordinary censuses." 
</P>
<P>
But there is no doubt that the number has been shrinking. Joshua Fishman, a 
sociolinguist who teaches at Yeshiva and Stanford universities, said there may 
be 3.5 million Yiddish speakers in the world today, including about 1.25 
million in the United States, compared to an estimated 12 million worldwide and 
just under 3 million in this country on the eve of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Yiddish (the name literally means Jewish) has its roots in the Dark Ages, when 
Jews who lived in southern France and northern Italy migrated into what is now 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
They spoke their own language, similar to the Romance languages of that day, 
but exchanged it for a form of medieval German, adding words from Hebrew and 
using the Hebrew alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Distinct From Modern German 
</P>
<P>
Modern Yiddish emerged as they gradually moved to Eastern Europe. It is 
distinct from modern German, with words folded in from Hebrew and the Slavic 
and Romance languages like so many raisins in a New Year's koylitsh (egg 
bread). 
</P>
<P>
From the early 1800s on, as more worldly Jews became a part of the cultures 
around them, some looked down on Yiddish as a zhargon, the language of ignorant 
village folk. 
</P>
<P>
But that ignored a rich literary tradition that goes back at least as far as 
1272, and a secular Yiddish literature that flowered from the middle of the 
19th Century on. Novels, plays, poetry and newspapers appeared in the language, 
along with prayer books and translations from the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
In waves of emigration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, about 7 
million European Jews spread the language to the United States, Canada, South 
America and what is now Israel. 
</P>
<P>
But others stayed behind. Most of them were gassed or shot or died of cold and 
hunger in concentration camps after Nazi forces conquered the Jewish centers of 
Eastern Europe. Of the 6 million Jews put to death during World War II, about 5 
million were Yiddish speakers, Fishman said. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Hebrew had become the language of the Jewish settlers in Palestine. In 
Stalin's Soviet Union, Yiddish and all other aspects of Jewish culture were 
stifled. And in the United States, Yiddish was often discarded as worn-out 
baggage from the old country. 
</P>
<P>
"The emphasis was Americanization," recalled Irving Teitelbaum, 67, a building 
contractor who arrived in Chicago from Poland 50 years ago. "One week after I 
came to this country my brother schlepped me to night classes and said, 'Learn 
English.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Dead Yet 
</P>
<P>
Now, except for some ultra-religious enclaves in Israel and the East Coast, and 
a small circle of secularists in New York whose Yiddish-language nursery school 
is so popular that it has a waiting list, there is nowhere left where Yiddish 
is the common language. 
</P>
<P>
Which is not to say that Yiddish is quite dead yet. 
</P>
<P>
The kultur klub (pronounced "cool-toor kloob") has extended its stay 
indefinitely at the Institute of Jewish Education, and classes at the Workmen's 
Circle, Santa Monica College and the West Valley Jewish Community Center had 
147 students at last count. 
</P>
<P>
"We lose people every year, simply because of the fact that people are dying," 
said Moshe Cohen, 78, president of the Los Angeles Yiddish Culture Club. "But 
somehow we find people who've exchanged playing cards on Saturday evenings for 
something more creative. We have a half-dozen young people too." 
</P>
<P>
About 100 senior citizens gather there once a week for lectures, musical 
programs, tea, cake and a chat. 
</P>
<P>
Other groups of first- and second-generation Americans meet as far afield as 
Anaheim, Arcadia, Long Beach and Laguna Niguel for informal evenings of Yiddish 
literature and conversation. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Zionists, Socialists and disillusioned Communists speak the language at 
political meetings. Shoppers and shopkeepers use it in the bakeries and butcher 
shops of the old Jewish neighborhoods of Fairfax and Pico-Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Services Generally in Hebrew 
</P>
<P>
Orthodox Jews often speak Yiddish in their synagogues, although services are 
generally conducted in Hebrew, the ancient language of the Bible and the prayer 
book. 
</P>
<P>
Yiddish speakers can also use the language as far away as Moscow and Buenos 
Aires. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to fly to a lot of places around the world, and I found that a lot of 
people speak Yiddish," said Sy Cohen, 70, of Los Angeles, a retired pilot for 
the Flying Tiger line. "Somehow you'd look somebody in the face and something 
would make you both say, 'Vos makht a yid (How's it going)?' " 
</P>
<P>
A World War II veteran of the Air Transport Command, Cohen said Yiddish came in 
handy when he volunteered to fly supply missions during Israel's War of 
Independence. 
</P>
<P>
"There were two pilots who escaped from Russia and we put them in the cockpit 
as co-pilots," he said. Since no one spoke Hebrew, the Americans and the 
Russians communicated in Yiddish. 
</P>
<P>
"We would say aruf mitn (up with the) gear, arop mitn (down with the) gear," 
Cohen recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Marion Herbst, a Los Angeles artist and folk singer, fell in love with the 
language when a friend played a record of folk songs for her, but she said it 
can be useful too. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still more speakers of Yiddish than there are of Esperanto, if 
you're looking for a practical reason for speaking Yiddish," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Herbst, 57, goes beyond practicality in explaining its appeal. "It's my 
language," she said. "Some people are obsessed by French and French culture. 
Me, I'm obsessed with Yiddish, with Yiddish culture. It's a mystical thing." 
</P>
<P>
The pungent sounds of Yiddish have also begun to tantalize people who did not 
drink them in with their mothers' milk. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 students are learning their alef-beyz (alphabet) and other basics 
at UCLA and at Jewish institutions such as the University of Judaism and the 
Workmen's Circle, a fraternal organization on Robertson Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to learn Yiddish. It was always the language of secrets in my 
home," said Susan Page, 40, of Garden Grove, who studied Yiddish at a Jewish 
Community Center in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Starting with the alphabet, she progressed until she could write a letter in 
Yiddish to her aunt. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it," she said. "I feel a real good connection with Jewish people in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five to 100 people, many of them in the 40-to-50 age group, are 
expected to take classes in Yiddish at the University of Judaism this fall, and 
an additional 200 may attend lectures on Yiddish literature, Yiddish theater 
and the history of Yiddish folk songs. 
</P>
<P>
"These are people who are in search of their roots . . . not people who know 
the language, but people who have the feel of it or the smell of it," said 
Rabbi Jack Shechter, director of extension courses at the campus in the Santa 
Monica Mountains above Sepulveda Pass. "It's a way . . . to deal with the 
Jewish side of them." 
</P>
<P>
Even in the most strictly observant neighborhoods of Jewish Los Angeles, where 
women in long dresses and men in long beards throng the sidewalks on their way 
to shul (synagogue) on Saturday mornings, many parents speak with their 
children in English. Others make a point of using Yiddish, said Rabbi Chaim 
Schnur, 39, director of Agudath Israel, an agency that lobbies for Orthodox 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
"Yiddish is still perceived by many as having an intrinsic value, as being the 
language of the Jew, and it shouldn't be forgotten. It should be preserved," 
Schnur said. "Some of the older boys in yeshiva (high school) study in Yiddish, 
because that's a form of discussion that goes back" to the 18th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Yiddishists send money to YIVO, a research institute in New York, 
and help gather books for the National Yiddish Book Center, in Amherst, Mass., 
which has saved about 900,000 old Yiddish books and sent out tens of thousands 
to individuals and libraries around the world. 
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 of those volumes came from Southern California, said Nanci Glick, 
associate director of the center, whose founder, an energetic 34-year-old 
former graduate student named Aaron Lansky, was just awarded a $250,000 
MacArthur Foundation grant. He expects to use it to send Yiddish books to the 
Soviet Union, Glick said. 
</P>
<P>
These groups may well be the saving of Yiddish in America. By the year 2010, 
Fishman predicts, the number of speakers will stabilize at just under 1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"By that time its speakers, as distinguished from its admirers and those who 
have love affairs with it from afar, will probably be ultra-Orthodox," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years Yiddish students at universities have amused themselves by 
inventing words: shneykishele (marshmallow -- literally, "little snow pillow"), 
kurtskes (short pants -- a diminutive and plural form of kurts, which means 
short). 
</P>
<P>
The standard text, "College Yiddish," has gone through 17 printings since it 
was first published in 1949, and a simpler primer, "Learning Yiddish in Early 
Stages," was reprinted in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But Janet Hadda, 43, an associate professor of Yiddish at UCLA, said the 
success of college programs -- there are about 60 in the United States -- does 
not mean that the language is thriving. 
</P>
<P>
Her classes in Yiddish as a language attract no more than a handful of 
students, while a poetry class taught in English last spring drew 35, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I teach conversations to my students in elementary Yiddish, they and I 
know I'm not training them to spend their junior year abroad in Yiddishland," 
she said. "Although I do hear reports of former students using their Yiddish in 
diverse situations, they are unlikely to go out into the world, find a mate who 
speaks Yiddish and conduct a courtship in that language." 
</P>
<P>
Still, some have found that Yiddish can be fun -- and a way to meet people. 
</P>
<P>
A Berkeley resident, for example, recently advertised in the National Yiddish 
Book Center's monthly publication "to find and have a correspondence, in the 
warmth of Yiddish, with another gay Yiddishist." 
</P>
<P>
Others make friends in class. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feeling of Completeness 
</P>
<P>
"This gives me a feeling of emotional completeness and accomplishment -- and 
besides, everybody is so nice," said Sharon Baumgold, 36, an attorney who went 
by her Yiddish name, Shayndl, when she attended classes at the Workmen's 
Circle. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd expect Yiddish to be a moribund language and only older people to speak 
it, but that's obviously not true. It can't be dying if we speak it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The class, made up of 10 women and one man, had gone beyond the alef-beyz to 
study the future tense and plural pronouns, but Abe Friedman, who taught the 
classes last year, said most of his students are not interested in grammatical 
niceties. 
</P>
<P>
"When we get into the dative, accusative and genitive cases, I lose half my 
class. People run away," he said. "I taught it the first year and I haven't 
taught it since." 
</P>
<P>
The curriculum includes songs and folklore, including jokes about the "wise" 
men of Chelm, who thought the sea is salty because of all the herring that swim 
around in it. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great link between the past and us," said Adinah Lindner, a social 
worker at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Lindner said she uses Yiddish sometimes 
with some of her older immigrant clients. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to let Yiddish go," she said. "If we don't make an effort to 
study it, to continue speaking it, there won't be Yiddish in the next 
generation, and after all the centuries . . . it would be pretty sad." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One-Liners From Singer 
</P>
<P>
One of the best-known Yiddish writers, Isaac Bashevis Singer, had a series of 
one-liners when asked about the fate of Yiddish, a question that Yiddishists 
have been wrestling with for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish people suffer from many diseases, but amnesia is not one of them, he 
would say. 
</P>
<P>
Or, the Yiddish language is sick, but among Jews, the distance between being 
sick and dying is a long way. 
</P>
<P>
Or, why write in Yiddish? I write about ghosts. What could be more appropriate 
than a dying language? 
</P>
<P>
Or, we believe the dead will arise. The first thing they'll ask is, is there 
anything new to read in Yiddish? So I write in Yiddish. 
</P>
<P>
His quips were quoted by Marvin Zuckerman, 57, an English professor at Valley 
College who taught Yiddish there for several years before it was dropped for 
budgetary reasons. Yiddish will be restored to the curriculum next spring, 
Zuckerman said, but he is not optimistic about the future of the language. 
</P>
<P>
"Lomir zich nit narn (let's not fool ourselves)," Zuckerman said. "Does it 
exist in your children's mouths? If not, forget it." 
</P>
<P>
Zuckerman, whose parents sent him to a secular Yiddish school in New York, said 
his own children do not speak the language, but their house is full of Yiddish 
books and newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
He said parents who let children know that Yiddish was once the language of 
their people may be surprised by their eventual interest: "You never know what 
will happen." 
</P>
<P>
Edith Post, 61, a Los Angeles high school teacher, was inspired in the opposite 
way. Intrigued by a chance encounter with her daughter's college Yiddish 
textbook, she plans to take early retirement and move to New York to complete a 
doctorate in Yiddish studies. 
</P>
<P>
"The language sounds good in my mouth and in my head and the literature stands 
on its own feet," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"People are saying it's going down, but it's not," she said. "There's a 
renaissance of Yiddish studies. And people say, 'OK, it's just going to be 
elitist.' I don't know that. . . . Who would have believed Hebrew would become 
a living language?" 
</P>
<P>
A YIDDISH SAMPLER 
</P>
<P>
Yiddish-speaking immigrants have added a unique spice to the English language. 
Here is a sampling of words, often used as slang, that have come into American 
usage through Yiddish, according to Webster's New World Dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
blintz -- From Russian blinyets, diminutive of blin, pancake; a thin pancake 
rolled with a filling of cottage cheese or fruit.

</P>
<P>
gefilte fish -- From German gefullter fisch; chopped fish, usually a mixture, 
as of whitefish, pike and carp, mixed with onion, egg, seasoning, and boiled,

matter. 
</P>
<P>

Schlemihl, title character of a novel by Adelbert von Chamisso (1781-1838), 
German writer; an ineffectual, bungling person who habitually fails or is 
easily victimized. 
</P>

<LEADPARA>  With the holidays approaching, millions of parents are looking at their home
computers and feeling the pangs of BGT (the Big Guilt Trip).;   Maybe the kids
shouldn't be spending all their computer time blasting aliens or battling
monsters. When we bought the computer, didn't we say it would help the kids
with their schoolwork?  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Computing  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  KIDS CAN WIN EDUCATION GAME WITH FUN SOFTWARE THAT
TEACHES  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Gift Guide  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     So it's time to look at educational software. Last time out, I wrote about
tools designed to help kids with their schoolwork. Today we'll look at games
designed to make education fun.;   For preschoolers, Walt Disney Software has
a variety of colorful, inexpensive programs featuring Mickey, Minnie, Donald
Duck, Goofy and the rest of the gang.;   Mickey's 123's, Mickey's ABC's,
Mickey's Colors and Shapes and Donald's Alphabet Chase teach basic visual
discrimination, counting and alphabet skills by giving kids a chance to
control the characters using the keyboard. The graphics and animation are
clever, but don't overwhelm the content. For IBM-compatibles.;   Math and Me
and Reading and Me from Davidson and Associates are two old favorites
available for both IBM and Apple II series computers. They use animals and
clowns to teach youngsters shapes, pattern recognition, numbers, letters and
simple sentences.;   For sheer creativity, it's hard to beat The Playroom,
from Broderbund Software. This delightful exploration program is just what the
title suggests, a playroom full of objects that turn into magic activities
when you touch them.;   There are games to teach counting, simple addition and
subtraction, letter recognition, telling time, spelling, strategy and logic,
all under the direction of Peeper, a toy mouse who pokes his head through the
window and shows up to help things along. For IBM, Apple II and Macintosh
computers.;   Older children (ages 6 to 10) may like Broderbund's sequel to
The Playroom, called The Treehouse. It uses the same poke-around-and-explore
metaphor to teach language skills, music, science and math under the tutelage
of friendly Awesome Possums. I was particularly impressed by the music games.
For IBM compatibles only.;   For young readers (3 to 6), Reader Rabbit, from
The Learning Company, has been a longtime best seller, with an animated word
factory that teaches basic reading, spelling and vocabulary skills. For IBM
and Apple II compatibles. Slightly older kids (5 to 8) who loved the first
version can keep up with Reader Rabbit 2. For IBM compatibles only.;   The
longtime champ in math software has been Davidson's Math Blaster, and for good
reason. The latest version, called Math Blaster Plus, combines graphics,
animation and a couple of nifty arcade games to teach math skills.;   There
are six levels of difficulty, and parents and teachers can make up their own
problems for the kids to solve. For IBM and Macintosh computers.;   Older
students may like Math Blaster Mystery (pre-algebra problem solving),
Alge-Blaster, and the new What's My Angle?, which teaches geometry with the
aid of a wacky miniature golf course. Mystery and Alge-Blaster are available
for IBM, Apple II and Macintosh computers, while What's My Angle is available
for IBM-compatibles only.;   Some of the best educational software I've seen
lately puts youngsters in the middle of arcade-style adventure games that
require then to read, do math problems or solve logic puzzles.;   The Super
Solvers series from The Learning Company pits youngsters against the madcap
Master of Mischief. In Treasure Mountain (for ages 5 to 9), the Master has
stolen the magic mountain's treasures, and youngsters have to get them back as
they wind their way up the mountain's tricky paths, outwitting mischievous
elves along the way. My younger boy loved this one, available for
IBM-compatibles.;   Eco-Saurus, from Davidson, takes another tack, teaching
youngsters ages 4 to 9 about conservation and recycling while they try to
clean up an island populated by friendly dinosaurs whose home is blighted by
trash and energy waste.  </TEXT>

why not?  </CAPTION>
<DESCRIPT>  MUSIC; PROFILE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  LET'S get this out of the way first: Sun Ra is a genius. Eccentric,
definitely. But an innovator nonetheless.;   In the years to come, this
septuagenarian pianist, poet and orchestrator -- who says he hails from Saturn
-- will be spoken of and praised in the same terms now used for the late Miles
Davis. They will say he was ahead of his time and regret they couldn't catch
up to him during his lifetime.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  THE SUN GOD
SUN RA BELIEVES IN ALIENS, DIVINE DEEP-SPACE
MESSAGES, TRICKY BACKWARD ALPHABETS
AND PURE, OTHERWORLDLY JAZZ  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     In the non-linear jazz world, his piano speaks a language that makes
perfect sense. He has found a way to get a 20-person band to improvise,
something thought to be accomplished only by small combos.;   In the world
that most of us inhabit, however, the Ra falls into that group of people who
walk the border close to madness.;   Some of his recent thoughts:;   "I played
in Turkey and Russia recently and they told me they've been talking to people
from outer space in ships circling the earth. They shared a cure for cancer. .
. .;   "There is a lot of space in outer space. You hear a lot of big bangs
there. If you hear one, that is God creating a new universe. If you hear it
you end up in a dimension you hadn't prepared for.";   Sort of like trying to
have a serious interview with the Ra.;   There have been times he's started
concerts with monologues on his thoughts of Egypt, flying saucers and sun
gods.;   In an interview last week, he talked about how Jesus was crucified.
People should say he was executed, the Ra says. It represents a beginning,
like when a musician executes with his horn.;   He also says the alphabet was
tinkered with somewhere along the line -- the letter A was really meant to be
a Z. This would change the meaning of a lot of words, he says, such as the
word "create," which is really supposed to be "crezte," like crest, a shield.
The missing letters change the whole meaning of the Bible, he says.;   I know
what you're thinking. Either he reads too many National Enquirers or this is a
publicity stunt. But I don't think so. He's been at it for 20 years longer
than Alice Cooper has used a girl's name.;   The Sun Ra also rises;   Back in
the '50s, according to several music encyclopedias, a musician named Herman
"Sonny" Blount left his role as a backup to jazz innovator Fletcher Henderson.
In his place stood Sun Ra, master of the cosmos.;   The books are sketchy on
this because Sun Ra is sketchy. All he says is that he came here from space,
in part to find people to play Henderson's music.;   Nearing 80, he's achieved
the status of an Indian medicine man or shaman with many fans. But not many
outside jazz circles have taken the time to hear his music.;   "That's because
I'm dealing with space and spirits and people weren't ready," he says. "I'm
still saying the same things I was years ago about going to Saturn, Mars and
Jupiter. It's very timely now.";   So what if he says ships can be powered
with cassettes of the right kind of music instead of rocket fuel?;   He says
it all clearly, softly, straightforwardly. He sounds -- almost -- like he
could be a bureaucrat or a school teacher.;   He has established a commune of
musicians in Philadelphia, requiring some of his backups to live with him,
drug- and alcohol-free. He told an interviewer in Philadelphia last year why
he moved there in 1969:;   "To save the planet, I had to go to the worst spot
on Earth, and that was Philadelphia, which is death's headquarters.";   He
regularly travels with a band of around 25 players. This year, he has been in
Europe and on the East Coast and will do a short swing through the Northwest.;
  One of the Ra's longtime backup musicians received the highest praise from
John Coltrane, one of jazz's top innovators, who credited John Gilmore as one
of his main influences.;   The lanky saxophonist could have had a huge career
on his own, but he has been playing with the Ra since 1963. Other great
players -- Marshall Allen and singer June Tyson -- also have tagged along.;  
Last year Sun Ra said he has asked Gilmore to save some of his most visionary
notes for some species better prepared to hear it.;   Close encounters of the
Ra kind;   In concert, the Ra is a time traveler. He entertains audiences with
primitive music, starting the band with conch shells and drums and then taking
them through the seven decades of jazz he has seen. Shows often end with a Sun
Ra vision of the future.;   His last two Bay Area tours have been a little
more down-to-earth. He played music from Walt Disney movies on one tour and
another featured classics by Duke Ellington and Fats Waller.;   This time,
he'll bring the synthesizer and do more spacey stuff.;   Although a stroke set
him back a year ago, Ra says he is feeling better now. Other band members say
he appears trimmer and fitter than he has in a while.;   "I'm always changing
improvisations," he says. "The world is changing and their thoughts about
space are changing. There is more talk about the possibility of going to outer
space, more magnification about things about space."; Sun Ra and His

<TEXT>
   A Frenchman killed aboard a Greek cruise
ship during an attack by gunmen was himself a terrorist, the Greek
government said, but people who knew him denied the allegation.
   Sources also said an Arab passenger was arrested for possible
involvement in the bloody assault on stunned passengers sunbathing
on the City of Poros cruise ship.
   Nine people were killed and 98 were wounded in Monday's attack
when men fired automatic weapons and hurled hand grenades at
tourists when the ship was about 16 miles off the Greek coast in
the Aegean Sea.
   Police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Friday
that an Arab man was being interrogated at police headquarters in
central Athens about possible involvement in the attack. They
declined to give details.
   Claims of responsibility have been attributed to three groups,
but none of the claims could be authenticated.
   One claim came in a letter purportedly sent by the Jewish
Defense League to the Greek Embassy in the Netherlands, the
state-run Athens News Agency reported today.
   The letter claims the Jewish extremist group staged the massacre
to protest Greece's support of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, the agency said. Leaders of the group could not
immediately be reached for comment.
   In Lebanon on Wednesday, a previously unknown group calling
itself the Organization of the Martyrs of the Popular Revolution in
Palestine claimed responsbility.
   Earlier, the Islamic Jihad organization purportedly claimed
responsbility in a telephone call to a French radio station from
Cairo.
   The Greek government statement identified the slain Frenchman as
Roland Vigneron, 23, and said he was involved in the attack.
   The statement also said the government had not ruled out that
another man identified as a terrorist, Mohammed Zozad, was among
the dead.
   It said police confirmed that the massacre was linked to a car
bomb explosion that killed two men near the ship's home dock about
six hours before the attack. The two were in the car when the bomb
apparently went off by mistake.
   ``Both actions were carried out by the same terrorist group,''
the statement said.
   The government statement said eight witnesses identified
Vigneron as one of the terrorists. It said he died of injuries at
Tzanneion Hospital in Piraeus, a port near Athens, where the
injured were rushed after the attack.
   In Paris, French television said a Frenchman named Laurent
Vigneron died in the attack.
   Greek authorities spell foreign names phonetically in Greek
script because they are unfamiliar with the Latin alphabet. They
apparently confused Roland with Laurent.
   Laurent Vigneron's parents confirmed he died of wounds at
Tzanneion Hospital.
   Reached by telephone in Mehun-sur-Yevre in central France,
Christine Audejean, the mother of Laurent Vigneron's girlfriend,
said she could not believe he was a terrorist. She said her
daughter, Annie, accompanied Vigneron on the cruise and is now
missing.
   ``We've known Laurent for two years. He's a very sweet boy, very
calm. They were lovers leaving on a honeymoon. They were going to
get engaged the following week,'' she said.
   She said both were engineering students in France.
   Mrs. Audejean said Vigneron was probably mistaken for a
terrorist because he had dark hair and complexion.
   The French Foreign Ministry said Friday it was not aware of any
evidence of Vigneron's involvement and asked Greek authorities to
provide an explanation.
   Police speculated that guns, grenades and explosives inside the
car that exploded were intended for hijacking the ship. They said
the terrorists may have been seeking freedom for Mohammed Rashid, a
Palestinian jailed in Greece for entering the country with a forged
Syrian passport.
   Rashid is wanted in the United States on murder charges and is
accused of planting a bomb on a Pan Am jumbo jet in 1982 that
killed one person and injured 15.
   The City of Poros was on a one-day trip through the Saronic Gulf
when terrorists struck.
   Initial accounts said the attackers fled in a waiting speedboat.
Later the gunmen were said to have jumped overboard and then
rescued with other passengers.

YOU'RE ON THE ROAD  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     We bet, though, one reason you're driving and not flying is money. At $120
for a Game Boy with video cartridge and $30 for a toddler's safari bag, the
distractions can defeat the purpose. So, what to do?;    Do as Pooh would do:
Think, think, think.;    There are toys that cost little and activities that
cost nothing, which together can make miles fly by. The key is planning.;   
The Parenting Guidance Center in Fort Worth, Texas, has a volunteer advisory
board of parents who put together some fundamentals that come with
experience.;    First, pack some toys that your child uses at no other time,
so they will hold some newness and fascination.;    For crowd control, an
adult should be in charge of the toy bag to ensure even distribution and avoid
an unmanageable mess. Bring along a kitchen timer to prevent back-seat brawls
over who had which toy for how long.;    Put small surprises -- a book, a
puzzle, a small game, a knickknack -- in little brown lunch bags, and use them
to count the distance, for example: one surprise every hour, or a surprise
when we get to Tucson.;    Involve your children in the ride by letting them
chart the journey or read about the region you're passing through. Rand
McNally now publishes the "Kid's U.S. Road Atlas" for $4, and also offers
separate $3 maps for Texas, California and Florida.;    Clap to the quacking; 
Come up with new variations on old standbys -- fresh verses for "Row, Row, Row
Your Boat" or barnyard solos for Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" (as in quack, moo,
woof.);    Have a period of storytelling -- an adult can lead the way for the
very young, and older kids can make up part and then hand off the tale.;   
Consider the classic road challenges: license plate bingo (you can buy cards)
or the "I'm thinking of a . . ." riddle game, in which a designated spotter
alludes to visible clues and spotters compete to guess first what the item
is.;    Using your ABCs;  And of course, alphabet, in which you each race
through the alphabet by spotting road sign or billboard words that begin with
the letter that comes next.;    Small personal stereos are ideal. And don't
pack only music; old radio shows, talking books and, for small children,
read-along tape-and-book sets offer variety.;    Stop regularly, change the
seating arrangement, include picnic stops that allow for exercise.;    And now
is prime time to buy downsized toys.;    Aggravation; Win, Lose or Draw; Wheel
of Fortune; Battleship; Connect Four; Hangman; and Yatzee are among the dozens
that come in travel sizes for $8 or less.;    If you want to make the trip
truly educational, consider the maps or a trip to the library for books.;   
Say your child is video-dependent? Consider under-$20 handheld electronic
games of the Double Dragon and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle variety.;    And
don't forget the change of clothing and wipes for spills, crackers for
unsettled tummies, raisins and juice for snacks.  </TEXT>

Dictionaries have entered the age of specialization. 
</P>
<P>
The general dictionary, which has been a reference workhorse for many years, is 
being augmented by specialized dictionaries that provide information on fields 
as varied as literature, food, mathematics and banking. 
</P>
<P>
The "Dictionary of American Literary Characters" (Facts on File), for example, 
"concentrates exclusively on American Literature." Edited by Benjamin Franklin 
V, the hefty volume "spans nearly two centuries: from 1789, the date of the 
first American novel, 'The Power of Sympathy,' to 1980, when Norman Mailer's 
'The Executioner's Song' won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction." 
</P>
<P>
The book identifies, in alphabetical order, 1,100 characters from "significant 
American novels, in addition to those in some uncelebrated works and in a 
sampling of best sellers." 
</P>
<P>
For example, a look under "Ishmael" shows he was the narrator and sole survivor 
"of the Pequod's pursuit of Moby Dick in Herman Melville's 'Moby Dick.' " 
</P>
<P>
Other specialized dictionaries issued recently include: 
</P>
<P>
"Webster's New World Dictionary of Media and Communications," compiled by 
Richard Weiner. This volume's aim is "to attempt to define specifically the 
terms from the many diverse worlds of communications." For example, a 
"dingadinga" is a "low-power spotlight," while a "polecat" is "a small support 
for lamps used in studio photography." 
</P>
<P>
"Food Lover's Companion" (Barron's) by Sharon Tyler Herbst. The fat little book 
contains "comprehensive definitions of over 3,000 food, wine and culinary 
terms." A look at "chalazae" brings this definition: "Thick, cordlike strands 
of egg white which are attached to 2 sides of the yolk, thereby anchoring it in 
the center of the egg." 
</P>
<P>
"A Concise Dictionary of Mathematics" (Oxford University Press) by Christopher 
Clapham. The book is designed to "guide readers through the often bewildering 
maze of equations and theorems encountered within the mathematical world." An 
"algorithm," for example, is "a precisely described routine procedure that can 
be applied and systematically followed through to a conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
"Dictionary of Banking Terms" (Barron's) by Thomas P. Fitch. "Some 3,000 terms 
related to banking, finance and money management are listed alphabetically and 
defined." For instance, "footings" is the expression used "for the bottom line 
figure on a bank's balance sheet: total assets or liabilities, plus equity 
capital." 
</P>
<P>
"Melba Toast, Bowie's Knife &amp; Caesar's Wife: A Dictionary of Eponyms" 
(Avon) by Martin H. Manser. An eponym is defined as "a real or mythical person 
from whose name the name of a nation, institution, etc. is derived or is 
supposed to have been derived." Thus, "Ferris Wheel" comes from an American 
engineer named George Washington Gale Ferris (1859-96).

<LEADPARA>  Alameda County's alphabet soup attempts at redrawing supervisors' boundaries
have become as jumbled as, well, alphabet soup.;    The most recent maps
released last week -- dubbed P and Q -- were aimed at answering complaints
that an earlier plan -- named O -- split ethnically diverse East Oakland into
two districts.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  ETHNIC LEADERS GIVE SUPERVISOR MAPS MIXED
REVIEWS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Mercury News Staff Writer Dennis Akizuki contributed to this report.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     But the new-generation plans have drawn mixed reviews from leaders in the
black, Asian and Hispanic communities.;    Some like P. Some like Q. Some like
neither.;    And Fremont and Hayward are steaming over the way both maps -- as
well as many of their predecessors -- divide those two cities.;    At its
Tuesday night meeting, Fremont's city council authorized Mayor Bill Ball to
write a letter to the county expressing support for Plan K -- one that puts
Fremont, Newark and Union City into a single district.;    Facing harsh
criticism last month that said they were rushing to approve a plan,
supervisors postponed voting on the entire reapportionment issue until
Tuesday's meeting.;    Now it remains uncertain whether an agreement will be
reached by then.;    Community activists hope a vote is again delayed, noting
that, by law, the county has until November to set new boundaries.;    "We're
not wedded to an alphabet," said Sandre Swanson, a congressional aide who has
overseen the drawing of the latest maps. "We may end up with Z.";    Board
President Mary King of Oakland said last week she doubted she would be ready
to vote by Tuesday.;    "There's no unanimity on any of these plans," she
said. "I think there are some major flaws with each of the plans.";    Sandra
Soto, an aide to Supervisor Bill Aragon of Hayward, said her newly appointed
boss has just started meeting with constituents to solicit opinions.;   
"We've got maps. It's like wallpaper here," she said. "I can't say if he's got
a preference.";    Supervisor Ed Campbell of Fremont said he is waiting to see
which plans the other four supervisors select.;    "There's a good possibility
I could be a swing vote on this thing," said Campbell, adding that his goals
are to keep cities and ethnic voting blocs in the same districts.;    Last
month Supervisor Don Perata pro posed Plan O. But after lengthy discussions
with residents, Perata said he is committed to keeping East Oakland in one
district.;    But he hasn't decided which plan to support.;    "Somebody is
not going to be happy, that much I'm sure about," he said. "Some city is going
to get split.";    Supervisor Warren Widener of Berkeley couldn't be reached
for comment.;    "Since November is the deadline, I think another month
wouldn't hurt," Swanson said.;    Swanson, a former supervisorial candidate
and an aide to Rep. Ron Dellums of Oakland, led last month's attack on the
supervisors for hastily endorsing Plan O -- a map that divided several
southern Alameda County cities along with East Oakland.;    Since then,
Swanson, who is black, and other ethnic community leaders have met with
Perata, King and Widener to draw new maps to address complaints that East
Oakland's minority vote would be diluted.;    "What's healthy about this
process is that the board has been responsive," Swanson said. "They've opened
the issue back up.";    But in so doing, they've also created new divisions.; 
  Plan P, which keeps most of East Oakland in Perata's Third District, has the
support of many Asians, said Alan Yee, a director of the Organization of
Chinese Americans.;    Plan Q, which puts most of East Oakland into King's
Fourth District, has the support of many blacks, said Dezie Woods-Jones, a
member of the African American Coalition.;    And neither plan has the support
of the Latino Coalition of Alameda County, said member Teresa Limon.;    "I
don't know how (the supervisors are) going to deal with it," she said. "I wish
they would have just stayed with O.";    On Tuesday, members of the Hispanic
group plan to ask supervisors to delay a vote so the ethnic groups can try
once again to come up with a plan all can agree on, Limon said.;    "We're
still working on it," she said. "The three coalitions want to work together."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Zoo professionals and animal rights activists
consider the Bronx Zoo the best in America, Parade magazine
announced Thursday.
   The magazine said it drew that conclusion from questionnaires and
interviews of 86 people out of 400 who were asked to identify the 10
best and 10 worst zoos.
   After the Bronx Zoo, whose formal name is New York Zoological
Park, the best zoos were, alphabetically:
   Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, Tucson, Ariz.; Audubon Park and
Zoological Garden, New Orleans; Chicago Zoological Park, Brookfield,
Ill.; Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden; Los Angeles Zoo; National
Zoological Park, Washington, D.C.; St. Louis Zoological Park; San
Diego Zoo; and Woodland Park Zoological Gardens, Seattle, Wash.
   The 10 worst, also alphabetically:
   Brevard Zoological Park, Melbourne, Fla.; Franklin Park Zoo,
Boston; Glen Oak Zoo, Peoria, Ill.; Knowland Park Oakland Zoo,
Oakland, Calif.; Nay Aug Zoo, Scranton, Pa.; Prospect Park Zoo, New
York City; Saunookes Bear Land, Cherokee, N.C.; Space Farms Zoo and

<HEAD>Moldavian Declared Official Language, Latin Alphabet Restored</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Moldavian leaders today declared their native
tongue the official language of the republic but agreed to allow the
use of Russian in some circumstances, a compromise aimed at
appeasing Russian-speaking minorities.
   The Moldavian Supreme Soviet, meeting in the republic's capital,
Kishinev, approved the language law overhwhelmingly, a Moldavian
activist and a reporter for the republic's official news agency said
by telephone.
   The initial proposal to make Moldavian the official language
caused widespread strikes and protests by ethnic Russians and other
Russian-speaking ethnic groups in the southern republic bordering
Romania.
   The choice of language is an important issue for many of the
diverse Soviet ethnic groups. Many have felt they were forced to
adopt Russian even though their native tongues are vastly different
and represent a distinct cultural heritage.
   Vasily Nestase, a member of a pro-Moldavian nationalist group
known as the People's Front, called the move ``a first victory'' for
ethnic Moldavians.
   The bill was approved 321-11, said a reporter for ATEM,
Moldavia's official news agency.
   As the official language, Moldavian is to be used for government
documents and meetings and commerce.
   The same legislation also contained a provision to placate
Russian speakers: a declaration that Russian is the language ``of
interethnic relations of the peoples of the U.S.S.R,'' apparently
sanctioning the use of Russian in communications among different
ethnic groups.
   The original draft of the legislation still pending said
Moldavian must be used for everyday life within the republic,
angering the Russian speakers.
   A compromise proposed Wednesday by Moldavia's Communist Party
chief, Semen Grossu _ at the urging of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev _ said Moldavian would be the language of officials and
documents, but Russian would be the everyday tongue for contact
among all ethnic groups within the republic.
   Also today, the Moldavian Supreme Soviet approved legislation
restoring the Latin alphabet to the Moldavian language. The Cyrillic
alphabet, like that used in Russian, was imposed by dictator Josef
Stalin after he annexed Moldavia from neighboring Romania in 1940.
   Stalin imposed Cyrillic to back his claim that Romanians and
Moldavians are two distinct nationalities.
   Many ethnic minorities in the republic do not speak Russian and
have staged rallies and strikes to express their objections to the
proposed language changes. Nestase said the strikes, which have
involved as many as 200 businesses and industries, were continuing
today.
   Moldavia has had no language law. Russian traditionally has been
the tongue for government affairs and is commonly used in commerce,
which upsets native Moldavians.
   Several hundred Russian speakers took to the streets of Kishinev
today and held red flags to underscore their concerns as the Supreme
Soviet met, Nestase said.

<F P=106> [Article: "The Alphabet World of GATT"] </F>
  [Text] Geneva -- There's something in an acronym that trade 
negotiators love. 
  TRIMS and TRIPS, AMS and PSI, MFN and MFA, welcome to the 
alphabet world of the GATT. 
  Little wonder that initials are so popular in an 
organisation 
whose boss is called "the DG" -- short for the director-general 
Peter Sutherland. 
  GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, may be the 
world's best known four-letter word, and its signatories could 
not resist calling one of its eagerly anticipated offspring, 
GATS. 
  That's short for General Agreement on Trade in Services, 
which will govern trade in services like banking and insurance 
if the seven-year Uruguay round of talks ever ends. 
  Some of the acronyms were coined well before the round was 
launched in the sunny Uruguayan resort of Punta Del Este in 1986. 
  MFN, the most favoured nation, can claim a certain following 
among people who have followed trade disputes. It refers to a 
country offering the same favourable terms to all trade 
partners, and is a pillar of the GATT. 
  MRA, or the multi-fibre arrangement, has governed textile 
and 
clothing quotas for two decades. 
  But the round has spawned an entire constellation of 
abbreviations that spin off the tongues of envoys like curses 
from the lips of sailors. 
  There is DFA -- draft final act, for a two-year old rough 
copy of the treaty that might someday emerge. 
  There are TRIMS -- trade-related investment measures, or 
rules and regulations that can distort trade. 
  The GATT wants to protect (trade-related intellectual 
property rights), clean up PSI (preshipment inspection) and 
measure farm handouts with AMS (aggregate measure of support). 
  Negotiators want to set up a DSB (dispute settlement body) 
once it has a DSU (understanding on rules and procedures 
governing the settlement of disputes). 
  And when new rules on safeguards, grey areas, serious injury 
and amber and green policies have been accepted, they will all 
be supervised by a whole new trade watchdog. 
  GATT will become MTO -- multilateral trade organisation.

  [Text] Although the law on identity cards is not 
being passed, the Interior Ministry is announcing the 
introduction of new identity cards in the spring; the 
introduction of the new cards will be done on the basis of the 
old regulations, with a change in the form for the identity 
cards; a filter for uncovering individuals without Macedonian 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] 
citizenship. 
  While the adoption of the law on identity cards by the 
Macedonian Assembly is waiting for "better times," the Interior 
Ministry is preparing a "counterstrike"--it will start to issue 
the new identity cards as early as April, and possibly the 
beginning of June. Regardless of whether the new law is passed 
or not, legal form will be ensured by applying the old law, but 
with changes in the regulations. To put it more simply, the form 
of the identity card will be changed, which the ministry has the 
right to do, just as in the case of the change in passports. 
<H5>  Black Number </H5>
  The Interior Ministry decided on this step because the 
present situation with the use and issuance of identity cards, 
in which real chaos prevailed (red, blue, and plastic-coated 
ones are in use), is becoming increasingly untenable. 
Standardization of the main civil document has also become 
necessary in order to clear up definitively the question of who 
is and who is not a citizen of the Republic of Macedonia. 
According to Blagoja Toskovski, a chief at the Interior 
Ministry, the current process of determining the status of 
Macedonian citizenship is definitive enough to give an answer as 
to how many citizens Macedonia has. 
  The information simply shows that many residents, knowing 
that they did not meet the conditions for obtaining citizenship, 
did not even request it, but are continuing to reside in 
Macedonia, using the old identity cards, obtained in various 
ways. That is the so-called "black number," whose magnitude is 
unknown, and which can only be determined by issuing new 
identity cards, which, however, can only be obtained on the 
basis of having received citizenship. This step is an attempt at 
finally clearing up the dilemma of who is a citizen of 
Macedonia, and all those who will not meet the conditions for 
obtaining a new identity card will have the status of 
foreigners; they will be easily identified, and they will have 
to regulate their stay in Macedonia in accordance with the rules 
for residence by foreigners. 
<H5>  Prediction </H5>
  "Indisputably it is necessary to adopt the law on identity 
cards. That does not mean, however, that it should be postponed 
indefinitely, because the situation `in the field' is already 
intolerable. The Interior Ministry will wait for the law to be 
passed, but if that does not happen we will start issuing the 
new forms for identity cards this spring," Blagoja Toskovski 
said. 
  As the situation regarding passage of the law on identity 
cards stands now in the Assembly, the Interior Ministry will 
probably have to start without this law. The positions of the 
deputies' groups still remain unchanged: The opposition is 
stubbornly insisting that identity cards be written only in the 
Macedonian language and the Cyrillic alphabet, including the 
citizen's name, and the coalition itself, in addition to being 
divided, has not decided what it should definitely accept. 
  Specifically, the PDP-NDP [Party for Democratic 
Prosperity-People's Democratic Party] is insisting that the 
entire contents of the identity card, including the name of the 
owner, be written in the language and script of national 
minorities, as well as the Macedonian language and Cyrillic 
script. The Liberals, as usual, still have reservations; that, 
however, does not mean that they possibly might not join the 
SDSM [Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia], which accepts 
the government's proposal that the identity card should be 
written in the Macedonian language and the Cyrillic alphabet, 
and the name of the citizen in parentheses and in the language 
and alphabet of the national minorities. There are predictions 
that since we will have elections this fall the law will not 
even be supported at all, because of fear of a possible loss of 
support among some of the voters. 
<H5>  [Box, p 3] </H5>
<H5>  Identity Cards as Cards </H5>
  The new identity cards will have the form of cards made from 
a stronger material without a protective foil. The first page 
will have the photograph of the bearer, together with the 
owner's first name and surname, and his birth certificate and 
registration number. "Republic of Macedonia" will be at the top, 
but without the state seal, which is also the alternative used 
in the new Macedonian passports. 
  The data on the date and place of birth will be entered on 
the second page, and the bearer's fingerprint will be impressed 
in a special place. Otherwise, it is planned that the 
replacement of identity cards will be carried out within one 
year, but the Interior Ministry thinks that the entire operation 
can be completed in a shorter time, in view of the capabilities 
of the system, which makes it possible to issue 300,000 identity 
cards in a month.

PALSY VICTIM REACHES OUT BEYOND HIS WHEELCHAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Honicky sat in the middle of Pierce College and watched as the world 
passed him by. 
</P>
<P>
He was in a wheelchair. A sign hanging on the chair asked passers-by to stop 
and chat and not be scared off by the fact that Honicky talks by pointing with 
his nose to letters of the alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
As he has done most school days for the last 15 years, Honicky had laboriously 
maneuvered himself onto the Woodland Hills campus looking for someone to talk 
to. And as usual, most of the students hurrying along the school's central mall 
seemed to pass him by. 
</P>
<P>
Honicky, 38, has cerebral palsy, which prevents him from walking or talking 
normally. But that's all the central nervous system disorder does, Honicky 
points out. 
</P>
<P>
"I can think and reason normally, just like you," reads the wheelchair sign -- 
painted on the flip side of a worn piece of Masonite that contains the painted 
alphabet. "Please don't be afraid of me." 
</P>
<P>
Those who looked the other way when they passed Honicky seemed to be, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Some may be frightened because he looks different," said Kitty Bean, a liberal 
arts major who stopped recently for the first time to talk with Honicky. "I've 
seen him every day, but I never took the time to stop until now. I'll take time 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Anthropology student Priscilla Murillo said she stops and picks up Honicky's 
alphabet board every day. 
</P>
<P>
"I read his horoscope to him," she said. "We talk about what's going on in the 
world. He just wants to be a part of life. He's lonely. He's not stupid. A lot 
of people figure he can't communicate, but he can." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Student Senator 
</P>
<P>
Honicky has taken psychology and sociology courses during his years at Pierce. 
Officials said he was an appointed student senator two years ago, representing 
the special services department. 
</P>
<P>
A student helped him communicate when he pecked out comments during student 
government meeting debates, recalled Judy Ponsor, assistant dean of student 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say Honicky has become a campus fixture who may contribute more to 
school life than anyone expects. 
</P>
<P>
By appealing daily to students to loosen up, slow down and talk, "Chris is a 
reminder that physically handicapped people can contribute," said Art 
Hernandez, dean of students. 
</P>
<P>
But only a handful of Pierce's 18,000 students take time to talk to Honicky, 
said Leslee Cook, chief counselor for the college's 266 disabled students -- 
including 61 who attend classes in wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Trapped in His Body' 
</P>
<P>
"Those with a caring heart take the time to talk to Chris," she said. "This is 
his only opportunity not to feel like he's in jail. He's got a mind and 
intelligence. He's just trapped in his body." 
</P>
<P>
Although campus grounds administrators tried last month to persuade Honicky to 
relocate away from the center of the mall and out of the way of service 
vehicles that travel down it, Honicky was unmoved. 
</P>
<P>
It's tougher for students to ignore him when he is in the middle of things, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a fighter," he said, slowly spelling out the words with his nose. "Only a 
few people take time now." 
</P>
<P>
Honicky is driven to school and pushed to the mall by David Moss, an accounting 
major who struck up a conversation with him three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Right Thing to Do' 
</P>
<P>
"It takes me 10 minutes extra, while it would take him hours to come by bus. 
He'd have to ride to the end of the line and then turn around to avoid having 
to cross the street out here," Moss said. "It's a balance of efforts. It's the 
right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Moss will transfer next year to Cal State Northridge. But Honicky won't be 
going along. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been there," Honicky explained. "People are too busy to stop and talk" at 
Northridge. Those who talk with him learn that Honicky, who is financially 
independent from his family, collected aluminum cans and made wake-up phone 
calls to supplement his income until the state threatened to deduct his 
earnings from his $500-a-month Supplemental Security Income. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Life Concerns 
</P>
<P>
They learn that he worries about the values of youths today and about nuclear 
arms, and that he likes soft rock music, UCLA football and basketball, 
attending Christian Science church services and food without sugar in it. 
</P>
<P>
"And he likes blondes," said Mark McIntosh, a volunteer at the Crippled 
Children's Society-run Rancho del Valle in Canoga Park, where Honicky sometimes 
attends Friday night socials. 
</P>
<P>
When the Reseda apartment where he had lived nearly 15 years was recently 
burglarized twice, Honicky moved to a more secure building in Sepulveda. He has 
not yet been able to replace a stolen TV set. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of a new television, he'd prefer visitors, Honicky said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to meet people who really care," he said, slowly spelling out the 
words -- and ending with an exclamation point.

NEW INSIGHTS INTO LEARNING DISABILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By GERRI KOBREN, Gerri Kobren is a writer for the Baltimore Sun.

<P>
"I always knew I was smarter than my grades indicated. My teachers didn't tell 
me that: They said I wasn't trying, that I was sloppy. When I couldn't spell 
something, they told me to go look it up. But how can you look it up if you 
can't spell it?" 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Gold, professor of English at Community College of Baltimore and 
co-author of three texts on children with learning problems, is 
learning-disabled. It is not, she says, something you outgrow or cure. 
Learning-disabled children have normal intelligence, but are unable to learn 
the way other children do. That does not, however, mean they cannot learn at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
"There are fantastic alternative ways of teaching," says Frona Roth, associate 
professor in the department of hearing and speech sciences at the University of 
Maryland, College Park. "What the good schools do is identify the particular 
learning pattern and style of the individual child, and work toward that." 
</P>
<P>
Boys are more likely than girls to have learning disabilities; the difficulty 
sometimes seems to run in families. But why it happens is not known. Whether 
all instances of learning deficits are "learning disabilities" is also unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Alan Davick, a privately practicing pediatrician with a strong interest in 
learning disabilities, says it's useful to think of a learning disability as "a 
wiring abnormality in the brain that affects the way they process information." 
</P>
<P>
In some children, the abnormality is so subtle it is unrecognized: The child 
struggles but gets through school and goes into a career that emphasizes talent 
in an area other than the disability. 
</P>
<P>
In others, there is a constellation of deficits: The child might be slow to 
speak, might not fully understand when spoken to, might not remember what he or 
she knew just a short time ago. 
</P>
<P>
School can be a maze. Learning-disabled children might see d where others see 
b; read was instead of saw; recite a cockeyed alphabet; forget how to finish a 
word or letter they've started to write. They might not even be able to control 
the fingers that hold the pencil, might not be able to organize notebooks, 
start compositions, finish assignments. Math might defeat them; foreign 
language is Greek to them. 
</P>
<P>
Some are also unable to pay attention: They have "attention deficit disorder" 
in addition to their other problems. Some are unable to sit still: They're 
"hyperactive." 
</P>
<P>
In the bad old days, they would have been the dumb kids in class, the 
troublemakers, the failures. 
</P>
<P>
Now, learning-disabled children are often recognized very early.

EMILY'S SHOES by Dermot Bolger Viking Pounds 14.99, 266 pages
THE LAST MAGICIAN by Janette Turner Hospital Virago Pounds 14.99, 352 pages
A FOOL'S ALPHABET by Sebastian Faulks Hutchinson Pounds 13.99, 275 pages
UNLIKE more aggressive nutters, the shoe fetishist seems a harmless,
easy-going fellow. Michael, the narrator of Emily's Shoes, simply lifts the
odd high-heeled pair from shop or jumble sale, takes it home and, as it
were, broods over it. Though he sometimes wears women's shoes, he is cagey
about it, and ashamed.
This obsession goes back to the days when, as a 10-year-old, he loses his
mother and is taken in by glamorous Aunt Emily who, like everyone else he
loves, forsakes him.
Shoes, though it is never spelled out, become all he can cope with,
man-made, external, replaceable. They won't die like his parents, or go mad
like his childhood sweetheart, or vanish into sex and marriage like Aunt
Emily. Michael's adult loneliness in a socially-awkward Dublin of oddities
and fakes, supposed miracles, pubs, churches, office blocks and slums,
becomes so intense that nothing can pierce it.
The story of his botched life is gloomy but aesthetically ebullient because
the writing is so strong, so exact, so much the right colour for each moment
and episode. The refusal to mourn, to acknowledge pain, to face the past, to
release spiritual poisons, has built up a throbbing pus of such horror that
only the banal prayer ('Jesus of every pair of women's shoes') seems
possible.
Anguish, unacknowledged but retrospectively felt, has to be dealt with
before a cure of sorts seems possible through dreams and memories. In this
way, Michael at last undergoes a sort of self-analysis. The writing is
triumphantly successful - bare, passionate, almost understating the almost
unstateable.
Janette Turner Hospital's The Last Magician has a complicated story spanning
about three decades. In its early stages, it tosses names and memories about
which only later acquire the necessary weight of feeling, but at the time
leave the reader irritatingly in the dark.
Yet from the first sentence, which echoes Dante, it has enormous energy and
power, both seemingly haphazard at the start, then gradually concentrating
on the central event which shapes the lives of everyone involved in the
story. This is the accidental death of a beautiful, loveable,
mentally-retarded child. In spite of their wild grief and sense of guilt,
all the adolescents who saw it can be called in some way responsible, and
all are pursued through life by the other's 'great beating wings' of action,
despair and memory.
This enormously ambitious book invokes not just Dante in its structure (the
inferno of subterranean Brisbane, all drugs, brothels and mayhem), but
literary figures in the writing itself, Shakespeare, Coleridge, Eliot,
Hopkins and others, often half-buried or echoed in a phrase rather than
quoted.
It seems a pity that some of the main figures from the shared Australian
childhood should have become, as adults, famous globe-trotters in television
and photography. In the early unfocused parts of the novel, that sort of
fame and life-style suggests something pop and bogus. But when real
characters emerge, this spurious air vanishes and with less curlicued
techniques (you have to work hard to reach them) the novel has enormous
punch and visual richness and becomes impressive.
Incidents are made into heightened moments of everyday reality. Everyone's
appearance becomes intensely memorable. Australia shimmers in a sort of
exotic ordinariness. Love and loyalty, strained and sometimes broken, become
the measure of everything human, and the mundane, without pretentiousness,
is given a new dimension. Extreme and extraordinary, the novel more or less
carries off its imagery and justifies its metaphors.
Sebastian Faulks' A Fool's Alphabet is, by comparison, tame and bland. It is
also pleasant, literate and a good read, a conventionally-told tale in an
unconventional narrative form. Calvino (say) might have made much of the
device; but an unusual format doesn't in itself produce unusual writing.
Twenty-six chapters, labelled from A to Z, are each set in the
appropriately-initialled place across half a century: A for Anzio, where the
hero, Pietro's father, lands with the Allies from North Africa in 1943 and
meets his Italian wife; Z for Zanica, the Italian village where Pietro is
conceived; in between, 24 other places around the world. The jerky variety
of place and time makes for an unmonotonous but, alas, unmemorable series of
vignettes: snapshots from the family album rather than the cumulative
reality of a novel.

   KOPKAMTIB was abolished recently by a

   The acronym _ some would call it alphabet soup _ is alive and

Indonesian acronymania, is this:

keputusan president), which created in its place the Coordinating
Agency for Assisting the Strengthening of National Stability
(BAKORSTANAS, or Badan Koordinasi Bantuan Pemantapan Stabilitas
Nasional).
   Acronyms and abbreviations are a national craze, used to
condense unwieldy phrases but serving in many other cases to
compound confusion.
   For one thing, it is common, if not preferable, to use the first
syllable instead of the first letter of words, as with KEPPRES.
   The main political party is called GOLKAR, which is short for
Golongan Karya and comes out in English as Functional Groups.
   Headline writers delight in the convenience offered by the
thousands of short forms, but to the uninitiated the front pages of
Indonesian newspapers resemble a lexicographer's nightmare.
   Acronyms also are found in telephone books and on the doors of
government offices. Standard dictionaries offer no help.
   Many say the use of acronyms first spread during the
administration (1949-66) of President Sukarno, known familiarly as
Bung Karno, for Brother Sukarno.
   During the Sukarno years, the habit was applied to English
phrases as well as the national tongue, Bahasa Indonesia.
   The term ``neo-colonial imperialism'' was cut to ``necolim.''
   A sports tournament for Third World athletes became known as
Ganefo _ Games of the Newly Emerging Forces.
   Communist China became CINKOM.
   Blame or credit for entrenching linguistic short cuts is usually
pinned on the armed forces, or the abri.
   As early as 1976, Professor Takdir Alisjahbana warned that the
influential military was coining so many acronyms that the standard
of Bahasa Indonesia might deteriorate. He said such usage added
nothing to the stock of new ideas but only increased the burden on
the memory.
   One magazine editor cautioned his staff about shortening jaksa
agung (attorney general) to jagung, which means popcorn.
   There are acronyms for most government departments and senior
officials.
   The president's personal assistants are aspri _ short for
``asisten pribadi president.''
   The alphabet soup is sometimes flavored with numbers.
   P3 is what people sometimes call the opposition political group
Partai Persatuan Pembangunan (United Development Party).
   Then there's BP-7 _ Badan Pembinaan Pendidikan Pelaksanaan
Pedoman Penghayatan Dan Pengamalan Pancasila.
   That's the Board for Guidance on the Means of Teaching
Guidelines for the True Interpretation and Implementation of the
State Ideology.

   Iceland Pushes Back

   Ancient Language Is Given
   An Unusual Refurbishing

   REYKJAVIK, Iceland -- The Icelandic language has two Old
English letters and far too many new English words. At least
that's the view of many Icelanders, who dislike foreign
phrases cluttering up their ancient tongue. To slow the
spread of "jogurt" and "hamborgarar," Icelanders now are
purging their vocabulary by finding old words for new things.
   Icelandic has changed so little in the past 800 years that
"some parts of the sagas could have been written this
morning," says Baldar Jonsson, head of the Icelandic Language
Institute. But the Vikings didn't have computers. Modern
Icelanders do. They call them "tolva," a merger of two
medieval words, meaning "numbers prophetess." The word for
telephone, "simi," translates as "long thread." A military
tank is "skrithdreki," or "crawling dragon."

<TEXT>
   Iceland now has committees grappling with foreign phrases
in 30 fields, from aviation to physics. Amateur wordsmiths
often send in ideas of their own. It is a task for which
Icelanders are well-suited. Per capita, Iceland has more
bookstores and Trivial Pursuit games than any nation in the
world. Long, dark winters also afford ample time for
brainstorming.
   Iceland isn't alone in fighting to keep its language pure.
France has long done battle with "Franglais," but linguistic
patriotism is hard to enforce in such a big and cosmopolitan
land.
   In remote, sea-locked Iceland, the war against Icelish
appears more successful. New words are published in journals
and quickly filter out through classrooms, dictionaries and
the media. In a society of only 250,000 people, it doesn't
take long for word to travel, and to catch on.
   Mr. Jonsson helped compose two words for AIDS. One is
"alnaemi," which roughly translates as "sensitive to
everything." The other is "eythni," derived from an old verb
meaning "to squander."
   Kirstin Flygenring, an economist, is combing William
Branson's "Macroeconomic Theory," listing terms such as
"liquidity trap" for which Icelandic substitutes are needed.
Sometimes, a literal translation will do. The "gross" in
gross national product, for instance, is easily derived from
an Icelandic word meaning "polluted" or "unfiltered." But
colloquialisms don't translate so easily. Iceland doesn't
have junk bonds or greenmail (or even a stock exchange), and
"putting some of these words into Icelandic can make them
confusing and a little silly," Ms. Flygenring says.
   In a related campaign, Icelanders also are weeding out
foreign names. Traditionally, Icelanders have been known by
first names only, followed by a patronymic; hence, Jon, the
son of Thor, is Jon Thorsson, and his sister's last name is
Thorssdottir. Iceland's slim phone book is alphabetized by
first names, and Icelanders rarely use Mr. or Mrs., except
when traveling abroad.
   But over the past century, many Icelanders have taken
middle names and also adopted non-Icelandic surnames. To stem
this tide, Iceland's parliament, or Althing, is expected to
toughen an existing ban on non-Icelandic surnames and also to
establish a formal list of acceptable forenames.
   "Names are part of our language and if we lose them we
lose our history," says Guthrun Kvaran, who is drafting the
law. While aimed at preserving tradition, the law also
acknowledges modern trends. Children born out of wedlock will
be able to take their mother's name.
   Immigrants who become Icelandic citizens also must take
new names and pass them on to their children. Hence, a
Vietnamese refugee named Tran Dat Phat now is Petur Tran Dat
Phat, and his children take the name Petursson or
Petursdottir.
   One notable exception to this rule is Vladimir Ashkenazy,
the Soviet pianist and conductor who was allowed to keep his
name after becoming an Icelander. (His wife is Icelandic, but
he now spends more of his time in Switzerland.)
   The Ashkenazy case inspired a Spanish immigrant in
Reykjavik, unhappy at having to adopt an Icelandic name, to
lodge a bizarre protest. As the Russian pianist's name was
now an approved Icelandic moniker, the Spaniard announced
that he wanted to take Vladimir Ashkenazy as his name, too.
Officials were amused but unmoved.

   Erte, whose pioneering art deco designs in
graphics, fashion and theater of the 1920s returned to popularity
in recent years, died Saturday, a hospital spokesman said. He was
97.
   A spokesman at Paris' Cochin Hospital refused to disclose the
cause of death. Friends said Erte was hospitalized in poor health
three weeks ago after returning from a vacation on the Indian Ocean
island of Mauritius.
   Erte _ whose real name was Romain de Tirtoff _ was known as a
painter, sculptor, lithographer and set designer. He designed
costumes for the legendary dancer Anna Pavlova and the
performer-spy Mata Hari.
   The prolific artist designed every cover of Harper's Bazaar from
1915 to 1936.
   His most recent project was to design the sets for the Broadway
musical ``Stardust.'' Some of his other major designs for sets and
costumes included Debussy's ``Pelleas et Melisande'' and Racine's
``Phedre.''
   He was also well-known for the opulent clothes and sets he
designed for George White's ``Scandals,'' the Ziegfeld Follies and
the Folies Bergere.
   ``He was just a genius,'' said Harris Shapiro, president of the
Dyansen Corp. gallery chain in an interview in Los Angeles. ``I
think history will reflect a few years from now that he was one of
the greatest artists of the 20th century.''
   He helped pioneer art deco designs. The style, derived from
cubism, is characterized by slender forms and straight lines
expressive of modern technology during the 1920s and 1930s. It _
and Erte _ regained popularity beginning in the mid-1960s.
   Born Nov. 23, 1892 in St. Petersburg, Russia, Erte decided to be
an artist from the moment he could use colored pencils.
   ``I was interested in fashion and even sketched a dress for my
mother when I was about five,'' he said.
   The family expected him to follow in the tradition of serving in
the Russian navy, but Erte went to Paris at age 19 to study art and
changed his name from Tirtoff to Erte.
   Times were hard, but he loved Paris, and later his parents and
sister joined him during the Russian Revolution. A second-rate
French seamstress had meanwhile hired and fired him, saying he
would never succeed in art or fashion.
   But he was soon working for the great designer Paul Poiret.
Later came a major contract with William Randolph Hearst and
Harper's Bazaar, which shot Erte to fame across the Atlantic as
perhaps the leading star of art deco.
   About 1925 he began work on what became probably his best-known
works, his alphabet designs. The 26-part series took him nearly 40
years to complete.
   The alphabet features the Erte woman: festooned with jewels and
trailing feathers and furs. Often, at the end of a diamond-studded
leash, was the ultimate art deco fur _ a leopard or panther.
   Erte became a French citizen and lived in Paris most of his
life, but once said ``I am probably better known in the States.''
   The United States often honored him with big retrospective shows
_ including one at the Smithsonian Institution and at big galleries
all over the country during his 90th year.
   In the postwar period, his reputation faded and his work was
dismissed as kitsch.
   However, in the mid-1960s he was rediscovered. Diana Vreeland,
the former Vogue editor, declared that no one in the 20th century
had a greater influence on fashion.
   Erte's designs, graphics and sculptures now command respectable
prices at top galleries. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York
has more than 200 Erte drawings and paintings in its collection.
   In later years, he spent several months a year in Barbados and
Majorca, where he had many of his sculptures cast.
   In Paris, he lived comfortably but modestly in a flat near the
Bois de Boulogne with a view of the Eiffel Tower.
   Always appearing trim and elegant, even past 90, Erte kept fit
by walking long distances. But he once said he didn't start
exercising until he was 70.
   ``I drink and eat what I like, smoke a little bit,'' said the
artist, who looked fit at a birthday party at Maxim's last November
hosted by fashion designer Pierre Cardin.
   A lover of nature, Erte surrounded himself with natural forms
like seashells and living things _ including a couple of
aristocratic Burmese cats and at least eight turtle doves in a
glass cage.
   Funeral arrangements were not immediately known. Erte was never
married and had no known survivors.

   Scientists at Fuji Photo Film Co. in Japan reported that
they used a light-sensitive protein from a bacterium to build
a crude version of an artificial eye.
   The "eye" was able to mimic some functions of the retina;
when images of alphabet letters were flashed on to the
device, it generated a set of electrical signals, similar to
the way the retina converts light images to electrical
signals. The electrical signals were amplified and
transmitted to a panel of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which
then lit up to display images of the letters.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Being made of biological materials, the "eye" was far more
compact than a comparable device made of microelectronic
parts, and thus could be a forerunner of eyes for robots.
   The key component of the artificial photoreceptor, as the
scientists called it, was a light-sensitive protein called
bacteriorhodopsin. It was extracted from a bacterium that
ordinarly uses it for photosynthesis, the conversion of
sunlight to electrical energy.
   Ultra-thin films of the protein were laid down on layers
of tin oxide. Each layer was immersed in a salt-water
electrolyte and hooked to two electrodes. Whenever light
shining on the protein changed intensity, going from dark to
bright or back, each protein molecule would emit an
electrical charge.
   The researchers said they built a retina-like device
consisting of 64 "pixels," or picture elements. The panel was
2.5 millimeters square, or less than a tenth of an inch on
each side. It was this device that "sensed" and transmitted
images of alphabet letters to a panel of 64 LEDs.
   The protein doesn't react when the light intensity is
constant; hence it doesn't "sense" still images. Rather, it
emits electrical charges only when the light intensity
changes. Thus, it can sense moving images.
   The Fuji scientists, reporting their research in this
week's issue of the American journal, Science, said that
their device is important for understanding how images are
processed in living animals "as well as for constructing
intelligent image sensors in the future."

   KOPKAMTIB was abolished recently by a
KEPPRES, which created BAKORSTANAS to take its place.
   The acronym _ some would call it alphabet soup _ is alive and
kicking in Indonesia. What happened recently, in translation from
Indonesian acronymania, is this:
   The Operational Command for the Restoration of Security and
Order (KOPKAMTIB, or Komando Operasi Pemulihan Keamanan Dan
Ketertiban) was abolished by a presidential decree (KEPPRES, or
keputusan president), which created in its place the Coordinating
Agency for Assisting the Strengthening of National Stability
(BAKORSTANAS, or Badan Koordinasi Bantuan Pemantapan Stabilitas

FT  08 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Why the FT is making changes . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saturday readers turning to today's share price listings will find a curious
mixture of the strange and the familiar. The grey-on-pink columns look, at a
glance, just as they always do - or, at least, as they have done since the
typography was changed a year or so ago. All the securities listed are
exactly the same as before, and many of the sectors into which they are
divided are also identical. Some sectors have split or merged, however, some
shares have moved sectors, and the names of several sectors have been
altered subtly.
Overall, it could take some time to adjust to the changes. To make the
process easier, this issue also contains a two-page alphabetical listing of
every security carried in the London Share Service, together with the name
of the sector in which it now appears.
The FT has organised share prices by industry for years. Investors like to
be able to make a quick estimate of how a share is doing in comparison with
its industry rivals; putting them alongside each other in manageable sectors
allows the price/earnings ratio or day's price change of, say, Glaxo to be
compared easily with that of SmithKline Beecham.
None the less, arranging shares by sector does make it harder to look up a
share for the first time. You must first make a guess at the heading under
which it is likely to be found, then locate that on the page. In the worst
cases, it could be necessary to scan several sectors before finding the
right one.
This problem can be lessened by using accurate and carefully drawn sectors.
For this reason, the FT changed a year or so ago from its traditional
sectors (memorable for the number of stocks described as Industrials,
Miscellaneous) to the classification used for the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share
index.
That classification has now been through its first thorough overhaul in two
decades to yield sectors that reflect more accurately the shape of today's
market. Electricals and Electronics have been merged. Oil and Gas has been
sub-divided, as has Health and Household. And each of the traditionally
large grab-bag of Miscellaneous stocks has been given a proper home of its
own.
The normal daily table reporting the All-Share also changes, of course, to
show the new sectors. In the two-page alphabetical listing, those stocks
that are constituents of the All-Share after the normal end-year changes are
marked with an asterisk.
There is one other change to the London Share Service worth noting. Foreign
stocks which are not part of the main classification - those categorised as
Americans, Canadians, etc - have moved from the beginning of the pages to
the end. The first sector listed is now Banks.
We regret any inconvenience caused to readers by the change of sectors, and
hope it will be short-lived as the new structure becomes familiar. Users of
the FT's financial statistics have had to cope with a number of changes in
recent years. Although we believe the service to readers is improved, we are
conscious that disruption to long-established habits brings its own costs.
After these changes, we hope for a period of greater stability.
Fuller details of the changes to the All-Share classification appeared in
Tuesday's and Wednesday's editions of the FT.

<HEAD>Moldavian Lawmakers Allow Loopholes for Russian Language</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers in the southern republic of Moldavia
opted Friday for more compromises that severely weaken attempts to
require all residents of the republic to speak the Moldavian
language, activists said.
   The legislature, or Supreme Soviet, named Moldavian the state
language Thursday but said Moldavian and Russian could be used in
everyday life. That infuriated thousands of Moldavians, who
demonstrated on the street late into the night while the lawmakers
debated.
   After hours of debate Friday, it decided that local governments
could choose their own official language, said Vladimir Solonar of
Yedinstvo, a pro-Russian group.
   Moldavia previously had no official language, but Russian is
typically used in government and commerce, especially because many
cities are dominated by non-Moldavians. Nationalists are trying to
restore common use of their language, but non-Moldavians fear
discrimination and have gone on strike at 200 enterprises to protest.
   Thousands of Moldavians demonstrated Friday outside the opera
house in Kishinev, the capital of the republic, to protest the
weakening of their proposal to require everyone to speak Moldavian.
   Another compromise will permit business enterprises to choose
their own language if they can win permission from both the local
government and the republic's Council of Ministers, Solonar said.
   Many businesses will try to use the loophole to continue using
Russian, predicted Yuri Plugaru of the pro-Moldavian People's Front
said.
   Thousands of Russians in the republic are in their 12th day of
strikes over the language law, whose original form would have
required Russians, Ukrainians, Bulgarians and other nationalities to
use Moldavian to speak to each other.
   Plugaru said Moldavians are considering a general strike
themselves to protest the compromises.
   Both the Moldavian and Russian representatives, however, said
everyone would have to study the final law before deciding the
strike question.
   The language dispute reflects widespread tension among many of
the Soviet Union's more than 100 ethnic groups stemming from decades
of repression and neglect. Many of the ethnic minorities say they
have been forced to learn and use Russian even though it is vastly
different from their native tongues and is alien to their cultural
heritage.
   ``People are unsatisfied with all the compromises the deputies
agreed to,'' said Konstantin Bogdanash, a journalist with the
People's Front group that has spearheaded the campaign for
preservation of the Moldavian language.
   Bogdanash said protesters held signs reading, ``People want
Freedom,'' ``No Lies,'' and ``Respected Russians, Mother Russia
Calls you Home.''
   The legislature also restored the Latin alphabet taken away a
half-century ago by dictator Josef Stalin when he annexed Moldavia.
Stalin imposed Cyrillic _ the alphabet used in Russian _ to back his
claim that Romanians and Moldavians are two distinct nationalities
even though the languages are virtually identical.
   The legislators also ordered creation of a commission to look
into the sharpening political divisions in the republic.
   In the Baltic republics, meanwhile, grassroots political groups
lashed out at the Soviet Communist Party leadership for its recent
scathing criticism of their campaign for independence, and the
Latvian organization demanded the Kremlin recognize the region's
``special economic and political status.''
   ``Whether the authors wanted it or not, as a result in the eyes
of many people they look like the brothers of those who divided
zones of influence in 1939 and decided the fate of our sovereign
people, at that time independent republics, also behind their
backs,'' said a statement released after a meeting of leaders of the
People's Fronts of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. It referred to the
Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact that put the Baltics in the Soviet
sphere of influence.
   The document said the party's remarks were the most ``sly or
dangerous for democracy'' it has made since Stalin's rule.
   The Latvian People's Front said Friday its leaders planned to
revise their group's platform to include a call for complete
independence for the republic.
   ``Only in an independent, democratic Latvia can an economic and
political crisis be overcome,'' the statement said.
   It called for authorities to ``rehabilitate the once-independent
republic of Latvia'' and ``recognize the special economic and
political status in the territory of Latvia to guarantee the return
of independence and democracy.''
   The full platform is to be published in a week in the Latvian
press and will then be considered at an Oct. 7 meeting of all the
People's Front's members, said Sarmite Elerte, a spokeswoman for the
group.
   Leaders of the Lithuanian People's Front adopted a similar
resolution last week.

   TRAINING WHEELS. Nostalgia on the track.
   - The favorite toy of many a long-gone youth was the model
train. Lionel is featuring nostalgia in its 90th year by
reintroducing the Scale Hudson locomotive, which it first marketed
in l937. It also has introduced its 90th Anniversary train set,
which has a GP-9 diesel engine, RailSounds system, operating
headlights, illuminated cab and number plates, and five boxcars
that recall important moments in the line's history.
   - For its own piece of history, a model of the BL2 diesel, made
by Life-Like Products, pulled six passenger cars without stopping
for more than 36 days straight last summer to break the record for
continuous running by a model train and give itself berth in the
``Guinness Book of Records.'' The diesel, modeled after the l950s
Western Maryland vintage engine, is featured in the Proto 2000
Series for serious hobbyists. The company also has sets for other
levels of hobbyists, including its Burlington Bullet and Little Joe
lines.
   - Nostalgia can be combined with high tech with train sets from
Marklin that can be operated either through a personal computer or
through a central control unit of the set. Trains, signals,
switches and other accessories are run digitally.
   - If you're a really older child - say above 25 - you can take
your train on the train in an attache case. Marklin has what it
calls the world's smallest train in a briefcase with a Z-gauge
layout, track, buildings, scenery and controls. Three freight cars
and a locomotive are powered by battery or transformer.
   - Perhaps the train enthusiast will be intrigued by a 1903 model
Renard Road Train, among the antique and collectible toys from
England listed in the Mint &amp; Boxed catalog at 32,000 pounds
sterling, or about $63,000. Less pricey versions of trains, cars,
trucks, boats and other miniatures - including the Matchbox, Corgi
and Dinky lines - are available at M&amp;B's new gallery in New York.
   BRAINFOOD.
   - Tiny scholars learning their numbers and the alphabet get help
from the latest model of the See 'N Say talking toy from Mattel.
This version of the 25-year-old toy has a new pull-lever that
replaces the string mechanism of earlier toys. Jim Henson's Muppets
and Mickey Mouse characters are new features, with Kermit Counts,
to help preschoolers learn to count to ten, and Mickey's ABCs, to
help them learn the alphabet.
   - The Super Speak &amp; Math from Texas Instruments is a talking
calculator in a brightly colored case designed to appeal to
children learning numbers.
   - Children can get into things scientific with Capsela, the
motorized science discovery system from Sanyei. They can learn
principles of mechanics and physics through a series of toys that
feature moving gears housed in clear capsules. The sets have
interlocking, interchangeable parts that can be assembled to create
all kinds of geared or motorized gadgets, include a vacuum cleaner,
a submarine, a hydrojet or racing car. One set, the Capsela 2000
Computer Control System, enables the youngster to build robots
which have a range of over 200 feet. The set has a computer memory
that can store up to 94 commands and operates 17 functions, all
powered by batteries.
   - Geographic literacy is the aim of GeoSafari from Educational
Insights. This electronic quiz game can be used with a variety of
GeoPacks of maps and facts to help youngsters learn about geography
around the world. One new pack, ``Make Your Own,'' lets users make
up a map quiz of their local town, school or state.
   WHATCHITS. From the jocular or innovative giver.
   - What are those strange hairy-looking things? They're Koosh
Kins from OddzOn Products, and they're a family of rubbery
personalities with porcupine hairdos, animated faces and moveable
arms that can grab onto things - maybe even this newspaper.
Theoretically, they are for children, but an adult may not refuse a
gift of Boingo, T.K., Slats, GeeGee, Scopes or Grinby.
   - Speaking of rubbery things, what about a nice big bowl of Guk?
Another almost indescribable product, this potion is something you
get in and grub with. It's mixed with water, feels rubbery or hard
in turn, messes up your fingernails and may even be fun. It's from
Chieftain Products.
   - The Z Ball has bounced its way up from Down Under into the
U.S. market. This Aussie invention, from Fundex, defies the usual
logic of balls, having six sides and protruberances that cause it
to pop, bounce, leap and richochet in unpredictable ways. The
company says it's being used by sports enthusiasts to sharpen
eye-hand coordination; the California Angels and the Boston Red Sox
used the ball during spring training last season.

   In Japanese this country is called Nippon or
sometimes Nihon, and therein lies a seed of debate.
   ``Why is our country called Japan? Its `official' name is
Nippon,'' Kazuo Sato wrote in a letter published in September by the
Asahi Shimbun, provoking a minor flood of other readers' letters.
   The 26-year-old student from Tokyo argued that Japan should
``unanimously use Nippon'' as its own name on the international
level _ on athletes' uniforms when they compete abroad, for instance.
   One of the editors of Asahi's letters section thought the flurry
of response and comment was slightly alarming _ a possible sign of
nationalistic feelings at a time when Emperor Hirohito was gravely
ill.
   ``It is a bit scary that people are interested in such a issue
especially under the current situation, when the emperor's illness
has been affecting the country,'' he said, asking that he not be
named.
   But the editor thought it was good for the letters columns to be
used to debate the issue.
   ``I guess it would be easier if we could choose one (name), but
we cannot decide which should be legitimate,'' he said.
   Not everybody is sensitive about the country's name, or worried
that Japan is getting nationalistic.
   A foreign relations specialist and conservative writer, Hideaki
Kase, said, ``I think it's fine to have a few different names. There
seems to be no problem using either Japan or Nippon. ... It has
nothing to do with nationalism.''
   A Foreign Ministry official said there are no rules on how to
name countries in other languages, and he noted that Japan is
spelled Japon in Spanish and pronounced like ``hapon.''
   But what should Japanese athletes wear on their uniforms for
international competition? No one but the Chinese would be able to
recognize Japan's name written in the Chinese characters, which
Japan borrowed to make a writing system centuries ago, so it has to
be written in the Roman alphabet, called romaji in Japanese.
   Kayoko Yamamoto, a spokesman for the Japan Amateur Sports
Association, said the organization provides uniforms emblazoned
``Japan'' for international athletic events.
   ``For major international events, we use Japan as the country's
official name, because English is the most common language,'' she
said.
   But there's no firm rule, and some teams also go with Nippon.
   Masaaki Obana of the Japan Volleyball Association said the
national volleyball team has both Japan and Nippon uniforms but
players wear Nippon more often in international contests.
   ``Either way, they're our country's names. We don't think we
should be using only one of the two,'' Obana said.
   After Sato's letter was published, the volleyball association
received many inquiries asking which name is official, because
Japanese volleyball players wore their Nippon uniforms at the summer
Olympics games in Seoul, South Korea.
   The Asahi editor said the newspaper, Japan's second-largest
circulation daily, received about 10 letters on the issues.
   Karen Blahitka from Yamaguchi prefecture in southwestern Japan
wrote that she was against using Nippon because many languages as
well as Japanese translate foreign countries' names into their own
tongue, and English-speaking countries are no exception.
   ``For example, Bundesrepublik Deutschland is the Federal Republic
of Germany or colloquially West Germany in English, and `Nishi
Doitsu' in Japanese,'' she said.
   Teacher Tatsuya Akizuki, 36, wrote: ``It is a huge task to change
the way a country's name or person's name, which has already become
fixed in our daily lives, is pronounced.''
   ``If Japanese are told to accurately pronounce country names and
names of people in the languages of the respective countries, we
would be in trouble,'' he added.
   The origin of the name Japan is not certain, but researchers say
it probably came from the Malayan ``Japung'' or the Chinese
``Riben,'' meaning roughly land of the rising sun.
   Historians say the Japanese called their country Yamato in its
early history, and they began using Nippon around the seventh
century. Nippon and Nihon are used interchangeably as the country's
name.

   In the Dec. 4 page-one article on the 21 Club in New York, I was interested in the remarks about Humphrey Bogart. 
I attended Trinity School on 91st Street at the same time as Bogart. 
I also was a frequent customer at 21 which, by the way, was not called a club in the early '30s. 
It does not surprise me that he has a brass plate indicating where he sat, as he was one of the best-known of my generation. 

   Apparently that did not impress the editorial staff of the school paper. 
In a blocked-off section were listed the names of alumni of whom the undergraduate editors had heard nothing. 

   The names were listed alphabetically so Bogart's name was near the top. 
Readers were requested to inform the editor if they had heard anything about the people on the list. 

   To quote Charles Churchill, "Fame is but an empty name."

CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS CHEER DEFEAT OF SIGN LAW

A federal judge's recent ruling that a Pomona ordinance requiring the use of 
English characters on business signs was unconstitutional was hailed as a 
victory for the area's Asian population by leaders of civil rights groups this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, which a group of Asian business owners challenged in U.S. 
District Court in Los Angeles earlier this year, required that all business 
signs with foreign characters devote 50% of the space to English characters. It 
was passed by a unanimous vote of the City Council last year. 
</P>
<P>
Federal District Judge Robert Takasugi ruled the ordinance was unconstitutional 
because it discriminated on the basis of national origin and it limited freedom 
of speech. 
</P>
<P>
"This ordinance was clearly an attack by the city of Pomona on its growing 
Asian community," said Robin Toma, an attorney with the American Civil 
Liberties Union, which filed a brief in support of the plaintiff. "By attacking 
the use of the Asian alphabets in signs, rather than attacking the use of any 
foreign language, the city was sending out a clear signal to the Asian 
community, telling them that their culture is not welcome." 
</P>
<P>
Toma said the ACLU is considering suing other cities with similar ordinances 
requiring the use of English, including San Gabriel, Arcadia, Rosemead, and 
Temple City. Some officials in those cities are already considering the 
implications of the court's decision. 
</P>
<P>
San Gabriel Mayor John Tapp said that "in light of the court ruling I'm sure 
we'll have to review" the city's ordinance, which is virtually identical to 
Pomona's. Twenty percent of San Gabriel's population is Asian, Tapp said, and 
"a substantial number" of businesses have not complied with the ordinance, 
which was passed in March. 
</P>
<P>
In his July 14 decision, Takasugi ruled that the ordinance violates the equal 
protection clause of the 14th Amendment because it "expressly discriminates 
against sign owners who use foreign alphabetical characters in their signs. The 
use of foreign languages is clearly an expression of national origin." The 
ordinance also obstructs freedom of cultural expression, the judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant, who proposed the ordinance, denied it was 
discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
"It had nothing to do with that," he said. "It didn't single out any racial 
origin. It just said, 'Hey, in Pomona our people and our public services should 
know what businesses to locate.' I wouldn't want to live in a community where I 
need an interpreter to tell me about the country I was born in." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Nell Soto said she was surprised the ordinance was struck down 
because it "does not take away their right to print their language. It asks 
them to include English." 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer hired to represent Pomona in the case, Alan Yamada, said city 
officials have not decided whether they will appeal the ruling. The judge is 
still considering the plaintiff's claim that there was intentional bias in the 
ordinance, and the city is seeking to settle the claim out of court, Yamada 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of the ruling on Pomona businesses is unclear in a community where 
only 2.7% of the population is Asian, according to the 1980 Census. Although 
city officials say that all business signs comply with the ordinance, the 
attorney for the Asian group, Elizabeth Brancart, said there are a few signs in 
Pomona that use only foreign characters. Brancart refused to identify those 
signs and would not disclose the names of her clients, but said most of them 
are Pomona business owners. 
</P>
<P>
Hoa Binh Market, a Chinese grocery store on East Holt Avenue, is one of a 
handful of stores that cater to the Asian community in Pomona. Doreen Han, 
assistant manager, said the market was not involved in the suit but she 
believed the law was unfair "because it's my personal right to express what I 
want to. Sometimes you want to express (something) only in Chinese." But, she 
added, the business signs in front of the market contain both Chinese and 
English because "our customers are not only Chinese. We have Filipinos, 
Americans, a mixture of different nationalities." 
</P>
<P>
J Craig Fong, a lawyer with the Asian Pacific Legal Center in Los Angeles, has 
been monitoring the enforcement of the Pomona ordinance and a similar one in 
Monterey Park. Fong said the decision sends a signal to cities that "these 
communities are changing, and (city officials) need to find some other solution 
to the difficulties they seem to be having with foreign businesses." 
</P>
<P>
In Monterey Park, where Asians constitute slightly more than half of the 
population, every business sign must include an explanation, in English, of the 
name or the nature of the establishment. In some cases both the name and type 
of business must be on the sign, but the law does not prohibit the use of a 
foreign language. 
</P>
<P>
The passage of the ordinance in 1986 followed a bitter campaign by longtime 
Monterey Park residents who were concerned about a large influx of Asian 
immigrants and lobbied for laws requiring the use of English. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant said Pomona's ordinance was designed to prevent the city from being 
transformed into another Monterey Park or Alhambra, where "the whole downtown 
is plastered with Oriental signs that no one can understand. There's some 
resentment to that."
