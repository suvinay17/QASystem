   Procter &amp; Gamble lost at least $300
million because Kimberly-Clark copied the design of its
super-absorbent diapers, an attorney said Wednesday in final
arguments in a federal lawsuit over Pampers and Huggies.
   Procter &amp; Gamble forecast it would make that much money annually
from its super-absorbent Pampers, said attorney Allen Gerstein, who
was representing the soap, toiletries and disposable diaper giant.
   But sales were $150 million below projections in each of fiscal
years 1986-87 and 1987-88 after Kimberly-Clark violated the Pampers
patent and introduced super-absorbent Huggies, Gerstein told U.S.
District Judge Falcon Hawkins.
   Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble wants Hawkins to order
Kimberly-Clark to stop manufacturing super-absorbent Huggies and to
remove them from store shelves. The company also is seeking
unspecified money damages.
   About $3.3 billion worth of disposable diapers are sold each
year, according to industry officials. Procter &amp; Gamble is the
industry leader with about 47 percent of the market while
Kimberly-Clark is No. 2 with about 30 percent.
   Hawkins is expected to rule in the non-jury case sometime this
summer. If he decides Kimberly-Clark is liable, damages will be
determined in a separate proceeding.
   Twenty-three witnesses testified and about 4,100 exhibits were
introduced during 17 days of testimony in the trial that began last
month.
   Procter &amp; Gamble contends that researchers Paul Weisman and
Steve Goldman developed a way to combine wood pulp fluff and super
absorbent materials in diapers to allow them to be made thinner.
   The company has argued that Kimberly-Clark violated its patent
on the process when it later introduced its super-absorbent Huggies.
   But Kimberly-Clark says Procter &amp; Gamble never had a valid
patent because it provided misleading information to the U.S.
Patent Office.
   Patent attorney V. Bryan Medlock Jr., representing
Kimberly-Clark, testified that if the patent office's examining
officer had known about earlier work on a similar process by an
Italian inventor, the patent would never have been issued to
Procter &amp; Gamble.
   In his closing arguments, Medlock said, ``Kimberly-Clark
totally, independently developed its Huggies super-trim diapers.''
   The super absorbent material in Procter &amp; Gamble's test-marketed
diapers did not work well, Medlock said, and they leaked.
   Procter &amp; Gamble addressed the problem in later versions of its
diaper products that included concentrating areas of super
absorbers and manufacturing double-layered diapers.
   The trial is being held here because Kimberly-Clark has a a
diaper manufacturing plant at Beech Island, near the Georgia border.

   A federal judge has ruled against
Procter &amp; Gamble Co. in a patent dispute with Kimberly-Clark Corp.,
defeating the consumer products giant's bid for control of the $3
billion disposable-diaper market.
   Procter &amp; Gamble had charged that the Dallas-based manufacturer
of ``super-absorbent'' Huggies diapers with copying Procter &amp;
Gamble's design of ``super-absorbent'' Pampers.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, based in Cincinnati, was seeking removal of
Huggies from store shelves and unspecified monetary damages.
   But U.S. District Judge Falcon Hawkins ruled Thursday that a
Procter &amp; Gamble patent for its super-absorbent diaper is
unenforceable because the company intended to deceive a patent
examiner.
   Procter &amp; Gamble spokeswoman Carol Boyd said the company planned
to appeal the decision.
   Procter &amp; Gamble is the leader in the disposable diaper
industry, with 47 percent of market. Kimberly-Clark is No. 2, with
about 30 percent of the market.
   At the heart of the lawsuit was a Procter &amp; Gamble patent to
combine wood pulp fluff and super-absorbent material to produce a
thinner diaper.
   After the application was rejected several times, Procter &amp;
Gamble was awarded a patent in 1985 based on new test data that
convinced a patent examiner the development was unique, the ruling
said.
   But Hawkins said Procter &amp; Gamble did not provide the U.S.
Patent Office with results of 1983 tests challenging the 1985 data
and the attorney handling the matter was ``grossly negligent'' for
failing to do so.
   ``The finding of intent to deceive is bolstered by the highly
material nature of the false affidavit,'' the judge said in his
58-page ruling.
   Procter &amp; Gamble attorneys argued during the 17-day, non-jury
trial that the firm lost $300 million a year because of the alleged
patent infringement by Kimberly-Clark. The trial ended May 31.
   Hawkins also ruled that an antitrust complaint filed by
Kimberly-Clark against Procter &amp; Gamble in a separate lawsuit may
proceed. That case is expected to go to trial in Charleston early
next year.
   Procter &amp; Gamble filed the lawsuit in South Carolina because
Kimberly-Clark operates a diaper manufacturing plant in the state.

   Kimberly-Clark swiped at least $300
million in sales from Procter &amp; Gamble by copying its design for
super-absorbent disposable diapers, a lawyer claimed.
   Attorney Allen Gerstein gave the estimate in closing arguments
in Procter &amp; Gamble's federal lawsuit against its biggest
competitor.
   The company claims the design of its super-absorbent Pampers was
copied by Kimberly-Clark in developing its super-absorbent Huggies.
Procter &amp; Gamble wants the judge to order a halt to Huggies
producton and have them removed from stores.
   But a lawyer for Kimberly-Clark said the company had no desire
to copy Pampers because early versions of that product leaked.
   ``Kimberly-Clark totally, independently developed its Huggies
super-trim diapers,'' said the attorney, V. Bryan Medlock Jr.
   Barring an out-of-court settlement, U.S. District Judge Falcon
Hawkins is expected to rule this summer in the non-jury case.
   Procter &amp; Gamble forecast sales of $300 million a year from
super-absorbent Pampers, Gerstein said. But sales were $150 million
below projections in both fiscal 1986-87 and the following year
after Kimberly-Clark introduced its super-absorbent Huggies, he
said.
   Industry experts say about $3.3 billion worth of disposable
diapers are produced each year. Procter &amp; Gamble is the industry
leader with about 47 percent of the market and Kimberly-Clark is
No. 2 with about 30 percent.
   The complaint does not seek specific monetary damages. If
Kimberly-Clark is found liable, damages would be determined in a
second proceeding.
   The closing arguments ended 17 days of testimony in the trial.
   The complaint by Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble says
researchers Paul Weisman and Steve Goldman developed a new way for
combining wood pulp fluff and super-absorbent materials to allow
disposable diapers to be made thinner.
   Kimberly-Clark violated the patented process in making its
super-absorbent Huggies, the complaint says.
   But Kimberly-Clark contends Procter &amp; Gamble never had a valid
patent because it provided misleading information to the U.S Patent
Office.
   The examining officer never would have issued a patent to
Procter &amp; Gamble if he had known about earlier work by an Italian
inventor, Medlock said.
   Procter &amp; Gamble said it test-marketed its new super-absorbent
Pampers in Wichita, Kan., in 1984 and then Kimberly-Clark copied
the design.
   Medlock also argued that Procter &amp; Gamble had not proven a link
between the invention and the success of the new products.
   ``There is no way to tell whether the success of these other
products is due to the Weisman-Goldman invention or other
inventions,'' Medlock added.
   But Gerstein said the Weisman-Goldman development ran contrary
to the thinking at the time that fluff and super-absorbent material
could not be combined in a diaper.
   ``Not one person, not one article, not one patent'' had shown
that it could be done, he said.

   A battle between industry giants over
super-absorbent diapers _ and the millions of dollars that come
through their sale _ has opened in U.S. District Court here.
   In the case, Procter &amp; Gamble Co. charges that the design of its
highly successful super-absorbent Pampers was copied by
Kimberly-Clark Corp. in developing super-absorbent Huggies.
   The huge consumer products company wants U.S. District Judge
Falcon Hawkins to order Kimberly-Clark to stop manufacturing the
Huggies and remove them from store shelves. The company also is
seeking unspecified monetary damages.
   The stakes are high, for making disposable diapers is a $3.3
billion-a-year business, according to court records.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, based in Cincinnati, is the industry leader,
with 47 percent of the market. Dallas-based Kimberly-Clark is No. 2
with about 30 percent, industry analysts say.
   As the trial got under way Monday, attorneys crowded the
courtroom while scattered along the jury box were boxes and bags of
diapers. The case is expected to last at least three weeks.
   Allen Gerstein, representing Procter &amp; Gamble, said P&amp;G came up
with the idea that made super absorbent diapers possible and took
out a patent on the development.
   The breakthrough, he said, allowed the manufacture of diapers
that are generally thinner but more absorbent than regular, more
bulky disposables.
   ``We stayed within the system while Kimberly-Clark disregarded
and took unfair advantage of the system,'' he told Hawkins in his
opening argument.
   P&amp;G Researcher Paul Weisman developed a means for combining wood
pulp fluff and super absorbent materials in the diaper to allow it
to be made thinner, Gerstein said.
   Gerstein said Kimberly-Clark copied the idea shortly after the
Pampers were test marketed in Wichita, Kan., in 1984.
   The introduction of the new diapers ``turned the diaper world on
its ear,'' he said.
   But attorney H. Blair White, representing Kimberly-Clark, said,
``This case is about two fiercely competitive companies each trying
to improve baby diapers.''
   He charged that P&amp;G never had a valid patent because it withheld
important test information from the U.S. Patent Office.
   In addition, he said, the system Weisman developed was already
covered in a British patent for super-absorbing materials issued to
an Italian inventor in 1979.
   ``In order to have a valid patent, you can't be the second
person or the 10th person (to invent something). You have to be the
first,'' he said.
   White argued that Kimberly-Clark had widespread experience with
super-absorbent materials as early as 1977 in the manufacture of
tampons and adult diapers.
   ``Kimberly-Clark didn't need lessons from anyone about super
absorbent products,'' White said, noting that ``the only things our
scientists learned from the Wichita diapers was how not to make a
diaper.''
   White said the problem with the Pampers when they were
introduced was that the super-absorbing material would come off on
the skin of babies.
   It was a problem Kimberly-Clark was trying to address in its own
labs at the time, he said, adding the company eventually developed
a system of putting the material farther away from the babies' skin
_ a system for which the company has been awarded a patent.
   The case is being heard in a non-jury proceeding. It was brought
in South Carolina because Kimberly-Clark runs a diaper
manufacturing plant in Beech Island near Aiken.

   Bachelors David Pitassi and Wally Klemp don't
have babies. But they're covering the bottoms of infants with a
disposable diaper they say is cheaper and better than the
better-known competition.
   Move over Pampers, Luvs and Huggies, the diaper entrepreneurs
say. Here come Drypers.
   The four-size, patent-pending diaper has what their company
calls a ``double lock-away core'' that absorbs moisture and wicks
it from the baby's skin. The core is made of paper fluff and two
parallel bands of super-absorbent material that can soak up to 100
times its weight in liquid.
   Unlike the his-and-hers diapers that have a more absorbent
material in the front and bottom, the Dryper core runs down the
middle of the entire diaper, making it applicable for both girls
and boys, Klemp says.
   ``We think our product has better features,'' says Pitassi.
   He and Klemp and a third partner, Terry Tognietti, began
marketing Drypers last summer, and they debuted on Houston grocery
shelves in September.
   Sales are exceeding expectations, the company claims. It's
reporting monthly sales of about $1 million and has captured 12
percent to 20 percent of the market in cities where Drypers are
sold.
   Although that's more than Veragon hoped for, it remains well
below the dominance of Procter &amp; Gamble Co., maker of Pampers and
Luvs, and Kimberly-Clark Corp., maker of Huggies. So Veragon's
founders are happy but reserved.
   ``We don't want to grow faster than we can control,'' Klemp
says. Production at a new Houston plant already is running 24 hours
a day, seven days a week to fill orders for New Orleans and all of
Texas.
   The $3.3 billion national diaper business is not new to the
Veragon partners.
   Pitassi and Klemp, both 30, formed a diaper company, VMG
Products, in Vancouver, Wash., in 1984.
   ``I was working for Procter &amp; Gamble selling diapers and saw the
diaper business was growing. The country was going through a baby
boom. It just represented a tremendous opportunity,'' Pitassi
recalld.
   ``For us you had two big groups (Procter &amp; Gamble and
Kimberly-Clark) and here we had come along with the same quality,
if not better, diaper for a better price,'' he says.
   VMG, now the third-largest diaper maker, grossed millions months
after production began. Within a year, however, the two lost
control of the operation in a hostile takeover. They ventured out
on their own again.
   Tognietti, 31, learned the diaper business during nine years
with Procter &amp; Gamble _ which introduced disposable diapers in 1961
with Pampers _ and helped design P&amp;G's gender-specialized Luvs
diapers.
   Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble is the nation's largest
producer of disposable diapers, claiming 47 percent of market.
Dallas-based Kimberly-Clark is No. 2 with about 30 percent.
   The top two are locked in a court battle. Procter &amp; Gamble is
suing its main competitor for patent infringement, accusing
Kimberly-Clark of copying the design of its highly successful
super-absorbent Pampers for use in super-absorbent Huggies.
   Pitassi says selling Drypers close to the factory saves the
company transportation costs and enables Veragon to charge an
average of $1 less per box of diapers than the competition.
   Veragon picked Houston as its manufacturing center over six
other Southwest cities, partly because of tax abatements and ardent
wooing by the Houston Economic Development Council.
   The heart of the company's 80,500-square-foot headquarters is a
$2 million diaper-assembly machine that combines 15 raw materials.
The machine, dubbed ``Drypers One'' churns out 350 diapers a minute.
   The company eventually may diversify and produce other paper
products, but for now, Drypers is the main focus.
   ``No question _ our baby is Drypers,'' Klemp says.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department, as expected,
filed suit to block a plan by Procter &amp; Gamble Co., the maker
of Pepto-Bismol, to acquire the exclusive sales rights for
Maalox, another stomach remedy.
   The Justice Department sought a court injunction under the
Clayton AntiTrust Act to prevent Procter &amp; Gamble from
acquiring the exclusive rights to market and distribute
Maalox.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Court papers filed in federal court in Philadelphia
charged that the proposed agreement between Cincinnati-based
Procter &amp; Gamble and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc., which makes
Maalox, would lessen competition in the market of
over-the-counter stomach remedies.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, based in Cincinnati, sold $125 million
of Pepto-Bismol last year, or 14% of the domestic retail
market. Domestic sales of Maalox totaled $111 million last
year, or 12% of the market.
   Under the proposal, Procter &amp; Gamble would acquire the
exclusive rights to market and sell Maalox and an option to
purchase the manufacturing assets from Rhone-Poulenc Rorer,
which is based in Fort Washington, Pa. The deal would make
Procter &amp; Gamble the largest seller of stomach remedies in
the U.S. market, according to the complaint.

<TEXT>
   The maker of Maalox is suing the maker of
Pepto-Bismol in a battle between stomach remedies.
   Rorer Pharmaceutical Corp. of Fort Washington, Pa., contends in
the suit filed in federal court in New York that Pepto-Bismol's
labeling, advertising and promotion are ``false and misleading.''
   In its suit, Rorer contends ``sweeping,'' unsubstantiated
statements by Pepto-Bismol's maker, Procter &amp; Gamble Co., have hurt
the sales and reputation of Maalox, Rorer's 40-year-old antacid.
   Rorer officials declined to estimate how much money they have
lost in sales, but the suit calls the sum ``substantial.''
   Teri Glover, a spokeswoman at Procter &amp; Gamble's headquarters in
Cincinnati, said the company had not seen the court papers and
could not comment.
   Procter &amp; Gamble acquired 88-year-old Pepto-Bismol in 1982 when
it bought Norwich Eaton Pharmaceuticals, which also is named as a
defendant in the suit.
   Rorer's suit also alleges that a new Maximum Strength
Pepto-Bismol is being sold with a higher dosage than approved by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
   In addition, Rorer said, it is disturbed that Procter &amp; Gamble
contends Pepto-Bismol treats a host of ailments, including
heartburn, indigestion, nausea and upset stomach.
   Rorer contends Pepto-Bismol is effective against only heartburn,
fullness and nausea caused specifically by overindulgence in food
and alcohol.
   ``The FDA has specifically found that Pepto-Bismol is not
effective for most of the claims for which it is promoted,'' said
the suit, filed Thursday.
   Brad Stone, an FDA spokesman, said the agency had no comment on
the suit.
   The Maalox line of over-the-counter antacids is the best-selling
antacid in the nation and the world. It had U.S. sales exceeding
$105 million last year, giving it about 15 percent of the market
for antacids, said Richard Driansky, a vice president and chief
counsel for Rorer, a division of Rorer Group Inc.

   The Justice Department, suffering heartburn
over a plan by the maker of Pepto-Bismol to acquire the exclusive
sales rights for Maalox, filed suit Tuesday to stop the

<TEXT>     Kimberly-Clark, which filed suit two years ago, alleges that Procter &amp;
Gamble copied its invention of a leak-shield flap in violation of federal
patent laws.;    Procter &amp; Gamble contends that it not only invented the
leak-control shield, but that the flaps in Pampers are substantially different
from the Huggies version.;    The non-jury trial began Tuesday before U.S.
District Judge William Dwyer.;    Leak-control shields are a critical
component of the fiercely competitive $4.2 billion disposable diaper business.
A 1989 study found that in a 2 1/2-year period, the average baby will have 325
urine leaks and 200 bowel-movement leaks.;    Procter &amp; Gamble first
test-marketed Pampers with leak-control shields during three months in late
1988 and early 1989.;    Kimberly-Clark filed suit in April 1989, when it
began selling Huggies with leak-control shields.  </TEXT>

   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. is testing colored
diapers _ blue for boys, pink for girls _ in several states to see
if pastels catch on for baby's bottoms.
   The diapers, which bear the Luvs Deluxe brand name, also include
extra padding in the front for boys' diapers and in the middle for
the girls' version.
   The padding is part of a patented system aimed at better
absorption, P&amp;G spokeswoman Carol Boyd said Wednesday. ``The
padding is just placed a little differently,'' she said.
   The diapers are being made available in Kansas, Oklahoma,
Missouri, Arkansas, and Evansville, Ind., as part of a market test,
Ms. Boyd said. P&amp;G will see how well they're accepted before
deciding whether to market them across the country.
   ``It's too soon to know whether or not these diapers will be
available nationally,'' she said. ``Consumers ultimately will be
the ones to judge.''
   Parents' comments prompted P&amp;G to offer the colored diapers, Ms.
Boyd said, adding that it's the first time the company has
attempted such an experment. ``Parents are the ones who told us
that they liked that. It was a fashion decision,'' she said.
   Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble has been locked in a tight
competition with Kimberly-Clark for the lead in disposable diaper
sales. P&amp;G held two-thirds of the $3 billion U.S. retail market at
the start of the decade, but its Pampers brand slipped behind
Kimberly-Clark's Huggies in 1985. Good sales by the Luvs brand
helped P&amp;G maintain the overall lead.
   P&amp;G recaptured 60 percent of the market by 1986 with aggressive
marketing and product changes.
   P&amp;G lost a legal battle with Kimberly-Clark last year when a
jury in Dallas ruled that the elasticized waistband in Huggies
disposables was not a patent infringement. P&amp;G had asked for an
injunction to stop Kimberly-Clark from making elasticized Huggies,
saying the diapers violated P&amp;G's patent for heat-shrinkable
material used in the Huggies waistbands.
   Procter &amp; Gamble had overall sales of $17 billion in fiscal
1986-87. It makes and markets laundry and cleaning products,
personal care products, pharmaceuticals, food and beverage
products, and other items for business and industry.

   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. proposes to paper
posteriors with pastel Pampers.
   The consumer products company said Wednesday it plans to
market-test blue disposable diapers for boys and pink ones for
girls in several states to see if parents prefer the colored
versions on their children.
   The diapers, which actually will bear the Luvs Deluxe brand
name, include extra padding in the front for boys diapers and in
the middle for the girls version, as part of a patented system
aimed at better absorption, P&amp;G spokeswoman Carol Boyd said
Wednesday.
   The idea to add color came from parents' suggestions to the
company.
   ``It was a fashion decision,'' she said. ``Parents told us
that's what they wanted.''
   Ms. Boyd said she believed at least one other company has tried
colored diapers, but this was the first time for Procter &amp; Gamble.
   The diapers will be market tested in Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri,
Arkansas and Evansville, Ind., before the company decides whether
to sell them nationally, Ms. Boyd said.
   Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble is fighting Kimberly-Clark
Corp., of Dallas, for the lead in disposable diaper sales. P&amp;G held
two-thirds of the $3 billion U.S. retail market at the start of the

<TEXT>
   Rorer Group Inc. announced Tuesday
it will work jointly with the consumer products giant Procter &amp;
Gamble to develop and market prescription and over-the-counter
pharmaceutical products.
   The move comes one day after the suburban Philadelphia-based
company announced a $1.7 billion agreement to merge with the
pharmaceuticals operations of Rhone-Poulenc SA of Paris.
   The alliance between Rorer and Cincinatti-based Procter &amp; Gamble
gives Rorer a major worldwide distribution system for its main
product, the antacid Maalox. In addition to Maalox, Procter &amp;
Gamble obtains exclusive U.S. marketing and distribution rights to
Rorer's line of over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, which include
Ascriptin and Perdiem.
   Rorer, which will continue to manufacture the drugs, will gain
rights to develop and market De-Nol, an anti-ulcer drug, and other
prescription gastrointestinal compounds that Procter &amp; Gamble has
been developing.
   Procter &amp; Gamble is still negotiating for international rights
to market and distribute some of Rorer's over-the-counter
pharmaceuticals.
   Rorer will retain ownership of its brands, while Procter &amp;
Gamble will receive royalty payments for the prescription products.
Both companies will share in the growth of the business.
   ``P&amp;G gains entry into a core over-the-counter category with a
leading antacid brand with no major upfront capital investment,''
Procter &amp; Gamble Chairman Edwin L. Artzt said in a statement.
   Rorer Chairman Robert E. Cawthorn said the alliance ``further
promotes Rorer's strategic objective of becoming a world-class
pharmaceutical company through research, internal growth and
business alliances.''
   ``This agreement maximizes the potential of Maalox,'' he said.
``Maalox and our other over-the-counter products will gain wider
distribution by utilizing Procter &amp; Gamble's extensive distribution
system.''
   Samuel D. Isaly, of Mehta &amp; Isaly pharmaceutical specialists,
said the deal ``is a lovely transaction'' for both companies.
   ``In the hands of Rorer, Maalox had a pretty bad future,'' he
said.
   New Brunswick, N.J.-based Johnson &amp; Johnson has heavily
advertised a competing antacid, Mylanta, he said, and the
government is considering allowing a variety of prescription ulcer
drugs to be sold over the counter.
   With Procter &amp; Gamble's better distribution system, Maalox will
be more competitive, he said.
   As for Procter &amp; Gamble, ``this gives them an extra brand name
they can promote,'' said Isaly, who noted the company already
distributes Metamucil and Pepto-Bismol.
   Under Tuesday's agreement, Procter &amp; Gamble also has received
the rights to purchase Rorer's over-the-counter pharmaceutical
company if Rorer decides to sell it.
   ``That's pretty important,'' said Ron Nordmann of PaineWebber
Group Inc. ``It is perhaps an indication that the newly-formed
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer might want to focus more on prescription drugs
and research.''
   Igor Landau, president of Rhone-Poulenc's health sector, said
the agreement with Procter &amp; Gamble is consistent with the newly
combined Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc.'s strategy of developing and
strengthening its U.S. market.
   Access to U.S. markets was considered a major reason for the
merger with Rorer. Although Rhone-Poulenc is in the top 10 in the
European pharmaceutical market, it had no direct marketing in the
United States or Japan.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, with sales of $21.4 billion last year,
manufactures and markets health care products as well as a wide
range of laundry and cleaning products, personal care products,
food and beverage products.
   Rorer Group Inc. had $1.2 billion in 1989 sales.
   Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. is expected to have annual sales
exceeding $3 billion.
   That merger will progress in stages, with Rhone-Poulenc
eventually obtaining 68 percent of Rorer by June 1990. In exchange,
Rorer will take on $265 million of Rhone-Poulenc debt and acquire
the French group's existing U.S. pharmaceutical subsidiary for $20
million.

FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Kimberly-Clark, P&amp;G settle seven-year
dispute
</HEADLINE>

   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KIMBERLY-CLARK and Procter &amp; Gamble, the two major diaper manufacturers in
the US, have reached out of court settlements on patent and other disputes
after nearly seven years of litigation, Reuters reports.
Dallas-based Kimberly-Clark announced that an anti-trust action, due to be
heard in federal court in Dallas yesterday , patent lawsuits and other
disputes in the US, Canada and Britain were included in the settlement with
Ohio-based Procter &amp; Gamble.
Details of the settlement are confidential, but Kimberly-Clark's director of
corporate communications, Ms Jean Allen, said her company 'is pleased with
the terms'.
The 'diaper war' has been waged since August 1985 when Proctor &amp; Gamble
brought a patent-infringement action against Kimberly-Clark, citing use of
an elastic waistband material. Kimberly-Clark counter-sued, alleging Proctor
&amp; Gamble was attempting to monopolise the disposable diaper market.
In July 1987 a Dallas court found in favour of Kimberly-Clark's waistband,
declaring the P&amp;G patent invalid. The decision was upheld on appeal.
Over the next five years, Proctor &amp; Gamble brought various
patent-infringement charges against Kimberly-Clark, while the latter
continued to accuse P&amp;G of anti-trust violations.

<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO>
<TEXT>
   (During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 

   DISPOSABLE DIAPERS WERE BORN IN 1961, a near-record baby-boom year, and soon threatened the safety pin and triangle fold. 

   That year the product still accounted for less than 1% of the 60 to 100 weekly changes on the 4.3 million babies born in the U.S. 
The official baby-boom era was 1948-1964. 

   After World War II, a Swedish company had sold baby diapers with insertable pads, but they were inconvenient and leaked. 
The pioneer of the idea for a truly disposable diaper reportedly was Vic Mills, the Procter &amp; Gamble engineer who had made Ivory soap sudsier. 
In late 1956, Mills suggested to a P&amp;G group that a fluffy paper product applied to a baby's bottom would sell. 

   His proteges -- Robert C. Duncan and Norma L. Baker, two Procter &amp; Gamble scientists -- developed the idea and filled a patent on Pampers on July 17, 1961; it was awarded in 1965. 
Its test of Pampers (plastic over an absorbent pad) in Peoria, Ill., didn't play well because of the 10 cents-a-pad price. 
A 1966 test in Sacramento, Calif., at six cents a pad was a success. 

   New competitors jumped in to fight for the market. 
Kimberly-Clark's Kimbies came in 1968 with a more-absorbent pad and tape closures. 
This company followed in 1978 with hourglass-shaped, elastic fit Huggies. 
P&amp;G responded in 1980 with "superabsorbent" Luvs, which had elastic gathers. 
In between, Johnson &amp; Johnson from 1971 to 1981 offered Chux. 

   Currently, disposables account for about 80% to 85% of the $3 billion-plus annual diaper market, with the balance held by cloth diaper services or those still using the pin and cloth. 
There have been charges that disposables in landfills could be harmful to the public's health. 
Kimberly-Clark, claiming that less than 1% of landfill is diapers, is seeking new materials degradable under the sun's rays. 
And P&amp;G is working on recycling ideas.

FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Procter takes a gamble with
nappy changes - The group hopes to regain market share with its latest price
cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Here is a puzzle. Pulp prices are rocketing worldwide, so companies making
paper-based products are under pressure to raise their prices too. Yet
Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, announced earlier this
week that it was cutting the US price of its Luvs disposable nappies
(diapers in the US) by 11 per cent. What is Procter &amp; Gamble's game?
At first glance, the announcement sounded ominously like a repeat of
Marlboro Friday. Procter &amp; Gamble, which makes 15 per cent of its global
revenues from disposable nappies, said it was cutting the price of Luvs to
claw back market share from cheaper, store-branded and private label
nappies. Last year Philip Morris, another big US packaged goods maker,
employed much the same logic when it cut the price of Marlboro, its
top-selling cigarette brand, to reverse its loss of market share to cheaper,
generic brands.
So was this Diaper Tuesday? The comparison falters because Luvs, unlike
Marlboro, is not a premium product. Procter &amp; Gamble's top disposable nappy
brand in the US is Pampers, while Luvs is a value-for-money brand. Procter &amp;
Gamble says the Luvs price cut is intended merely to restore the product's
competitiveness with private label brands, which have recently become
cheaper.
Even so, the cut will hurt. US nappy prices have already fallen by about 20
per cent over the past two years because of tough competition between
Procter &amp; Gamble, the private label suppliers, and Kimberly-Clark, the US
paper products company that leads the US nappy market with its Huggies
brand. Furthermore, Procter &amp; Gamble is having to accompany the Luvs price
cut with a 2 per cent reduction in the US price of Pampers because Pampers
might otherwise start to look too expensive.
The puzzle is how Procter &amp; Gamble can afford it. Pulp prices, driven by
surging worldwide demand, have shot up by 80 per cent from their November
1993 low of Dollars 390 a tonne, and are rising fast. According to Mr Chip
Dillon, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, Procter &amp; Gamble gets through
700,000-800,000 tonnes of pulp a year in the US alone. So even by the most
conservative estimate, the company is facing an increase in pulp costs of
Dollars 200m a year in the US - equivalent to about 25 cents a share after
tax.
One way Procter &amp; Gamble plans to defray the cost is by increasing the price
of its other paper-based products. It said this week that it was raising the
US prices of its Charmin toilet tissue by 5 per cent, its Bounty paper
towels by 6 per cent and its Puffs facial tissues by 8 per cent. Meanwhile,
the Luvs price cut should be partially offset by increased sales.
The company is also cutting manufacturing costs. In July last year it set in
train a plan to close 30 plants and shed 13,000 jobs - about 12 per cent of
its global workforce - in response to competition from lower-priced
products. 'The efficiencies gained from those actions pay out at a time like
this,' the company says.
Procter &amp; Gamble insists that it expects to continue 'solid' sales and
earnings progress in spite of the nappy price cuts. Ms Lynne Hyman, an
analyst at CS First Boston, is less sure: she thinks the price increases on
tissue and towel products should cancel out the increased cost of pulp,
while lower production costs should balance out the price cuts for Luvs. 'I
would say it's fairly neutral, but a little bit of it is dependent on
getting some higher volumes, so there's a chance it could be slightly
negative,' she says.
If things do go wrong, one possible gainer should be Procter &amp; Gamble's
biggest US rival in paper products, Kimberly-Clark. Unlike Procter &amp; Gamble,
Kimberly-Clark is a pulp producer. Therefore if product prices rise, Procter
&amp; Gamble will be simply defraying higher raw material costs, while
Kimberly-Clark should see the full benefit at its bottom line.
Unfortunately, however, Kimberly-Clark has troubles of its own. The company
has been trying to break into the European market for disposable nappies
with its Huggies brand, but the cost of doing so has proved much higher than
expected - not least because of aggressive retaliatory action by Procter &amp;
Gamble. So the last thing Kimberly-Clark needs just now is a round of price
cuts in the US nappy market.
Mr Sherman Chao, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, remarks that all this is a far
cry from the early 1990s, when consumer product companies were enjoying a
fall in raw material costs and yet were still able to push up prices. 'Now
everything is converging against them - an inability to raise prices in
general and raw material prices moving up.' Seen in that light, it is
remarkable that Procter &amp; Gamble is doing as well as it is. But with the
nappy war moving to Europe, and the increase in pulp prices showing no signs
of slowing, no one is pretending that the diaper business is going to get
any easier.

   The diaper that made disposable a household word is about to be changed. 

   Procter &amp; Gamble Co., keenly aware that Pampers has lost a startling chunk of market share, isn't talking. 
But people close to the consumer-products company say a new, improved Pampers -- along with an expensive ad campaign -- will come before year end. 

   "They say they have to do something," says Bonita Austin, analyst with Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. "Pampers isn't No. 1 anymore," adds Hugh Zurkuhlen of Salomon Brothers, "and that disappoints them." 

   Pampers is now the underdog, and making a comeback will be tough. 
Its share of the market has eroded to about 26% -- down from 59% in 1980 and down from 75% in the mid-1970s. 
Huggies, meanwhile, the rival brand made by Kimberly-Clark Corp., has grabbed 31% of the market, up from a mere 9% in 1980. 

   Some analysts claim that P&amp;G, after making early improvements in super-absorbency, essentially ignored Pampers. 
Kimberly-Clark, meanwhile, hasn't stopped tinkering with Huggies in recent years. 
Both products are about the same price, but Huggies has been aggressive in making changes such as softer elastic and in advertising those improvements. 

   "Procter fell asleep too long with Pampers," Mr. Zurkuhlen says. 

   Yet another reason for Pampers' decline is a sibling rivalry with Luvs, also made by P&amp;G. 
Luvs' share has grown to 24% from 11% in 1980, largely at the expense of Pampers. 
Luvs Deluxe, diapers with strategic lining designed in a boys' version and a girls' version, has been particularly successful. 
But in bringing out Luvs, the company wanted to create a premium segment; it hadn't intended to rob Pampers of sales. 
And even with Pampers and Luvs together, P&amp;G's diaper market share isn't what it used to be. 

   On top of everything, the diaper market is relatively flat, with sales steady at about $3.5 billion a year. 
The new Pampers is likely to include one or more improvements. 
It may be thinner or have better-sticking tape fasteners. 
Or it may include "cuffs" that block leakage around the leg openings. 

   Cincinnati-based P&amp;G already sells cuffed diapers in Japan, but Huggies has beat them to the U.S. Earlier this year, Dallas-based Kimberly added a strip of cuff-like material inside the leg openings of its Huggies Supertrims. 
The material acts as a dam to stop leakage. 
The diaper, available in a few Western states, is expected to be launched soon nationwide. 

   The new Pampers is bound to trigger a diaper battle. 
"We'll probably get another marketing war," with both P&amp;G and Kimberly-Clark advertising heavily and offering lots of coupons, says Jack Salzman, analyst with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. Prices could also come down. 

   Kimberly-Clark won't comment, but marketing specialists say Huggies isn't going to yield ground easily. 
"Huggies has got a lot of momentum going already," and that will only increase with the new cuffed product, predicts Lynne Hyman, analyst with First Boston Corp. 

   Meanwhile, both Pampers and Huggies face the challenge of coming up with biodegradable diapers to answer growing environmental concerns. 
RMed International Inc. of Sedona, Ariz., claims its diaper is more than 90% biodegradable, compared with 60% for most disposable diapers. 

   P&amp;G disputes RMed International's claims of a superior product. 
Still, it may soon begin test marketing in Europe a diaper that has corn starch, an ingredient found to speed disintegration of plastic.

<HL> Enterprise: Believing It Has Built a Better Diaper, Firm Seeks Niche in $3 Billion Market </HL>

   Until his infant daughter developed a stubborn case of diaper rash last winter, Edward Reiss was happily semiretired, running his little Sedona, Ariz., company making shoe polish and shoehorns. 

   Through a catalog, his wife bought some little-known, chemical-free, super-dry disposable diapers. 
They seemed so effective that in April Mr. Reiss, 50 years old, bought a 30% stake in the tiny Denver company that makes the diapers, Rocky Mountain Medical Corp. 
Since then, Mr. Reiss has expanded Rocky Mountain's distribution, licensed the Uncle Wiggly storybook character to use in marketing the diapers and, last week, announced that the company will begin making the nation's first biodegradable diaper, using a special plastic that should break down within two to five years. 

   Can the man who claims to have built the nation's largest maker of shoehorns squeeze into the $3 billion disposable diaper market dominated by Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Kimberly-Clark Corp.? 
Probably not. 
"But do they have to? 
No, it's a niche market," says a broker who makes a market in Rocky Mountain's stock. 

   If all goes as planned, the new diaper, marketed under the name TenderCare, will appeal to parents who worry about the chemical processes used in popular disposable diapers, and Rocky Mountain, which had a loss of $10,000 on revenue of $387,000 in the nine months ended June 30, will be a much larger company. 

   The diaper kingpins, of course, contend their products already suit even the tenderest infant bottoms. 
And Kimberly-Clark and Procter &amp; Gamble, which together control about 80% of the disposable diaper business, say the super-absorbent material that turns wetness into gel in Huggies, Pampers and Luvs hasn't been found to cause any significant health problems. 
Kimberly-Clark also makes thicker diapers without the gelling material. 

   Both big makers are skeptical about Rocky Mountain's claim that its diaper is biodegradable. 
Both would like to have fully biodegradable diapers, to ease environmental concerns about mountains of waste plastic. 
But they have searched in vain for a truly biodegradable product so far; their diapers are 60% to 70% biodegradable, they estimate. 
"When an effective material is found, we'll certainly use it," says a Kimberly-Clark spokeswoman. 

   Mr. Reiss says the new diaper is 99.4% biodegradable. 
He won't divulge the exact process it will use, although he says the plastic covering includes an additive that makes it break down. 
A Procter &amp; Gamble spokeswoman says the company knows of a plastic using a starch additive that breaks the plastic into pieces, but says the plastic doesn't truly disintegrate. 

   To carry out his niche strategy, Mr. Reiss expects to begin marketing the biodegradable diaper in December through representatives of Medela Inc., which leases infant-care products, and through health-food stores and some specialty baby-product outlets. 
Rocky Mountain, which also makes some infant medical products, plans to stay away from the competitive grocery and mass merchandise outlets, but hopes to persuade some department stores to stock the product. 

   Meanwhile, the diapers will continue to be sold through mail-order and catalogs for $59, including delivery, for four packages. 
Four of the big competitors' packages (128 to 264 small, medium or large diapers) typically retail for about $40. 

   Mr. Reiss is unfazed by the challenge of grabbing his share of the 15.8 billion disposable diapers sold each year. 
His shoehorn company had $80,000 in sales when he bought it in 1976. 
Its revenue has quintupled and it now sells six million promotional shoehorns a year. 
"I think I can sell just as many diapers as I can shoehorns," he says.

<HEAD>Procter &amp; Gamble Says It Won Cookie Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Tuesday it had
reached a $125 million agreement with three competitors whom the
company had charged with violating its patent for crisp and chewy
cookies.
   Procter &amp; Gamble said Keebler Co., Nabisco Brands Inc. and
Frito-Lay Inc. agreed to a consent judgment signed by U.S. District
Judge Joseph Longobardi in Wilmington, Del., where Procter &amp; Gamble
filed its lawsuits.
   ``We've worked hard to prove we're right, and we won,'' said John
E. Pepper, president of Procter &amp; Gamble. ``We believe this judgment
is a complete vindication of our rights under this patent.''
   Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble markets the cookies under the
name Duncan Hines.
   The company filed lawsuits against Keebler, Nabisco and Frito-Lay
in June 1984. The settlement averted a trial that was scheduled to
begin Oct. 2.
   The agreement states that Procter &amp; Gamble's patent is valid and
enforceable and it prohibits the three companies from infringing the
patent, Procter &amp; Gamble said.
   Procter &amp; Gamble spokesman Donald Tassone refused to say how much
each of the three companies would pay Procter &amp; Gamble. He said the
settlement requires that the companies not divulge its terms
publicly.
   Frito-Lay, based in Plano, Texas, said it would pay less than $20
million as its share of the settlement. Frito-Lay described the
settlement as a ``prudent business decision that allowed the company
to avoid a complex, lengthy and costly trial.''
   Frito-Lay, which is owned by Pepsico Inc., said the settlement
would be paid by insurance and would have no effect on the company's
finances.
   Comment from Keebler, which is a subsidiary of United Biscuits
PLC of Britain, and Nabisco, part of RJR Nabisco Inc., was not
immediately available.
   Procter &amp; Gamble introduced its cookies in 1983. Keebler, Nabisco
and Frito-Lay later introduced this same type of cookie, Procter &amp;
Gamble said.
   The three companies altered the composition of their cookies
after Procter &amp; Gamble sued, Tassone said. They no longer sell
cookies that Procter &amp; Gamble regards as violating its patent, he
said.
   Procter &amp; Gamble said the gain from the settlement would be
reflected in its first-quarter earnings.

<HEAD>Procter &amp; Gamble Earnings Up; Kimberly-Clark's Also</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. Tuesday reported a 17.9 percent increase in
earnings for the January to March quarter and another big consumer
products company, Kimberly-Clark Corp., said its quarterly income
went up 10.5 percent.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, based in Cincinnati, said its after-tax
earnings rose to $310 million, or $1.85 a share, in the three
months ended March 31, up from $263 million, or $1.53 a share, a
year earlier.
   Sales rose to $5.43 billion in the January-March period, the
third quarter in the company's fiscal year, up 11.7 percent from
$4.86 billion a year earlier.
   The company credited higher selling prices, greater sales
volumes and currency translation adjustments as reasons for its
profit growth. These factors were partially offset by a higher
estimated tax rate.
   For the first nine months of Procter &amp; Gamble's fiscal year, net
income came to $1.04 billion, or $6.13 a share, on sales of $15.97
billion. In the corresponding period the year before, earnings were
$880 million, or $5.14 a share, and sales totaled $14.36 billion.
   The company manufactures and markets a wide range of laundry and
cleaning products, personal care products, foods and beverages,
plus a variety of items used by businesses and industry.
   In a release from Kimberly-Clark's Dallas office, the company
said its first quarter income increased to $103.1 million, or $1.28
share, from $93.3 million, or $1.16 a share, in 1988's first
quarter.
   Sales amounted to $1.42 billion, a 9.9 percent pickup from the
comparable 1988 quarter, in which sales totaled $1.29 billion.
   Net income improved because of increased earnings from equity
companies and lower interest expense, Darwin E. Smith, chairman and
chief executive, said in a statement.
   About 60 percent of the sales improvement in the quarter can be
attributed to increased sales volumes, which were achieved in most
major businesses, Smith said. Volume increases were led by consumer
tissue, feminine care and disposable diaper businesses in the
United States and Canada.
   Operating profit, however, dropped 4.9 percent to $171.7 million
from $180.5 million.
   Kimberly-Clark attributed the drop in operating profit to higher
marketing expenses because of intense competition. It also cited
weakening newsprint markets, higher fiber costs worldwide and
expenses associated with new products, particularly Huggies
Pull-Ups training pants.
   Kimberly-Clark is a manufacturer of household, personal care and
health care products, including Kleenex tissues, and newsprint and
business, correspondence and specialty papers.

FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Procter cuts disposable nappy
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, yesterday said it was
raising the prices of some of its tissue products in the US by up to 8 per
cent because of higher pulp prices, but simultaneously announced an 11 per
cent cut in the price of its Luvs disposable nappies.
The company also said it was turning Luvs into a unisex product instead of
having different types of nappy for each sex. It said the resulting cost
savings, combined with higher volumes flowing from the price cut, should
have a positive effect on profits.
Analysts say Luvs has about 13 per cent of the US disposable nappy market.
Pampers, another Procter &amp; Gamble product, has about 26 per cent,
Kimberly-Clark's Huggies about 30 per cent, and the rest is taken by private
label products.
While Pampers and Huggies vie for the top end of the market, Procter &amp;
Gamble has been repositioning Luvs as a direct competitor for private label
products by lowering its price. Yesterday's move was the latest in a series
of price reductions.
Procter &amp; Gamble also said it was cutting the price of Pampers by about 2
per cent. Analysts said this was to prevent the differential between Pampers
and Luvs becoming too wide. Kimberly-Clark is expected to follow suit
because Huggies and Pampers have for several years sold at virtually the
same price.

<HEAD>EC Asks Procter &amp; Gamble To Suspend Cooperation Deal With Finaf
SpA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community Commission asked
Procter &amp; Gamble Co. of the United States and Italy's Finaf SpA on
Tuesday to suspend a plan to cooperate on making diapers and other
personal hygienic products.
   The companies said in September they plan to create joint
ventures in Italy, Spain and Portugal for their paper products
businesses, notably diapers and sanitary napkins. Also, Procter
said it would buy all of Finaf's activities in Britain.
   The Commission asked the companies to hold off until it is
satisfied ``there is no breach'' of EC fair competition rules.
   A Commission official said the accord could create or strengthen
dominant positions by the two companies and received a complaint
about the planned venture from Peau Douce SA, a French diaper
maker.
   Peau Douce argued Procter's deal with Finaf would violate
competition rules and asked for interim measures to stop the
agreement from taking effect.
   The EC treaty bans undertakings that prevent, restrict or
distort fair copetition in the 12-nation trade bloc.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, which is based in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Finaf
have been in touch with the Commission since before they announced
plans for their linkup.
   David Veitch, a spokesman at Procter &amp; Gamble's European
headquarters here, said, ``It has always been our intention not to
implement this agreement until the competent authorities have been
heard.''
   The EC Commission official said discussions with the two
companies were continuing and if these ``go satisfactorily, we can
resolve the problem without going further to law.''
   Veitch said under the deal with Finaf, the two companies were
``to merge their paper product business'' in Italy, Spain and
Portugal.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, the maker of Pampers, is a leading diaper
producer. But Veitch said the company ``was a relatively small
player in Europe'' in sanitary napkins and other personal hygiene
paper goods.
   ``The purpose of the agreement (with Finaf) was to accelerate
our entry'' into those products in Europe, he said.

   A federal jury ruled that Kimberly-Clark Corp.'s Huggies brand disposable diapers didn't violate a Procter &amp; Gamble Co. patent when an elastic waist was added to the product. 

   The verdict by the six-person panel, which came after 10 hours of deliberation, wasn't a surprise. 
Analysts had considered the suit, filed in 1985, as just another salvo in the continuing "diaper wars" between the two rival companies, which dominate the $3 billion-a-year market for disposable diapers. 
P&amp;G's Pampers and Luvs brands command about half of the market, and Kimberly-Clark's Huggies hold about a third. 

   P&amp;G, a consumer products maker, alleged that Kimberly-Clark unlawfully used a method of elasticizing its diaper waists with heat shrinking material. 
P&amp;G sought to block Kimberly-Clark from further alleged infringement on the patent, and asked for unspecified damages. 
Kimberly-Clark countered that it hadn't violated rights of the patent and that the patent, granted to Raychem Corp. in 1972, wasn't valid. 
Raychem sold the patent, which expires in two years, to P&amp;G in 1983. 
In a countersuit filed last year, Kimberly-Clark, a maker of household, personal care and healthcare products, charged P&amp;G with trying to monopolize the disposable diaper market. 

   In Cincinnati, a P&amp;G spokesman said: "We are clearly disappointed with the jury's finding in Dallas. 
We are considering our options." 
He declined to elaborate.

   The Justice Department threatened to block Procter &amp;
Gamble Co.'s plans to market Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc.'s
Maalox antacid because the pact violates antitrust laws.
   The joint marketing pact would make P&amp;G, which makes Pepto
Bismol, the biggest player in the U.S. over-the-counter
stomach remedies market, which could "substantially lessen
competition," said James F. Rill, assistant attorney general
at the Justice Department's antitrust division.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The pact could result in higher prices for consumers, he
said. "This lack of market competition would generally harm
consumers nationwide," Mr. Rill said.
   Federal prosecutors said they will file a civil antitrust
suit in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia to challenge the
pact. P&amp;G and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer said they disagree with the
department's conclusion and are assessing their alternatives,
but declined to elaborate.
   In March, P&amp;G acquired the U.S. marketing and distribution
rights to a variety of Rorer Group Inc.'s over-the-counter
drugs, such as Perdiem, a laxative, and Ascriptin, a
combination analgesic-antacid.
   The Cincinnati consumer products company had tried to
acquire all of Rorer's over-the-counter drug business, but
was rebuffed. Earlier this year, Rhone-Poulenc S.A. of Paris,
a chemical company, merged most of its drug business with
Rorer, of Fort Washington, Pa., to form Rhone-Poulenc Rorer.
   The Maalox marketing alliance was considered a coup for
P&amp;G's drug business because it gave the company the leading
antacid without the high costs of developing a new brand.
Rorer, in turn, would receive payments from P&amp;G and gain
rights to develop and market certain P&amp;G prescription drugs.
   Rorer says Maalox has a U.S. antacid market share of about
15%, but the brand has faced stiff competition from rivals
Tums and Mylanta.
   Justice department officials estimate that 1989 sales of
over-the-counter stomach remedies were more than $900
million. P&amp;G and Rorer had combined sales in that market of
more than $236 million, officials said.

<P>
It was test-marketed in 1961 in -- where else? -- Peoria, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
And, oh, how well it played! 
</P>
<P>
In the years since, the disposable diaper has been improved: There are 
elasticized leg bands, gels, super absorbency, and anatomically efficient "his" 
and "hers" designs. 
</P>
<P>
It has become a $3.5-billion-a-year industry, and 85% of American mothers use 
them. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the disposable diaper has become a prime target of angry 
environmentalists who consider it the very symbol of the ills of a throwaway 
society. The problem is what to do with it once it has done its job. Throwaway 
diapers are piling up in the waste stream. 
</P>
<P>
The way a mother covers her baby's bottom has become a subject of hot debate in 
statehouses and city halls. The issue has generated piles of reports and 
pamphlets. Who would have thought the manufacturers of disposable diapers would 
have to go to such lengths to defend such a wonder product? 
</P>
<P>
Bills that would ban, restrict or tax sales of disposable diapers are before 
the legislatures of a dozen states. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the controversy has breathed new life into the diaper service 
business, and it could prove a boon to corn farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Studies show that although disposable diapers are only about 2% of the nation's 
trash, they last 500 years in a landfill. One proposed solution is a 
more-expensive biodegradable diaper, and that's where the corn farmers come in. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanne Wirka, a solid-waste-reduction expert with the Environmental Action 
Foundation, said the disposable diaper is the largest single one-use product 
for which there is a readily available alternative -- cloth diapers. 
</P>
<P>
But the convenience factor is extraordinary. Many day-care centers, for 
example, will not accept youngsters in cloth diapers. 
</P>
<P>
And, if everyone switched to cloth tomorrow, there would be chaos. There are 
not enough cloth diapers or cloth diaper services in the country to accommodate 
them. In environmentally hip Washington, D.C., 400 names are on the waiting 
list for the one diaper service in town. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Diaper Services, after years of decline, reported a 38% 
increase in business last year and a 13% rise the year before. The disposable 
diaper makers, however, say they see no blip yet on their sales screen. 
</P>
<P>
The debate has produced strange bedfellows. The six most active environmental 
groups and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Kimberly-Clark Corp., the disposable 
diaper manufacturers who control more than 75% of the market, agree that 
biodegradable diapers are not the answer. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, environmentalists called for a boycott of degradable diapers, 
saying their use merely assuages the consumer's conscience. Biodegradable 
diapers don't decompose in landfills because there is not enough moisture or 
oxygen in a dump, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Taking an opposing view is the National Assn. of Corn Growers, based in St. 
Louis. Cornstarch is used in the degradables and this could open up a market of 
150 million to 300 million bushels a year for the nation's corn farmers, 
spokesman Tim Draeger said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the only state to enact legislation has been Nebraska, which passed a 
law last session requiring the use of biodegradables by 1993. Nebraska, it 
might be noted, is the nation's third-largest corn-producing state, just behind 
Iowa and Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Draeger argues that if the biodegradable diaper technology were improved, it 
would mean America would be less dependent on foreign oil. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in the infancy of this technology," he said. "We are at the Model T 
level. We have to learn to walk before we can run." 
</P>
<P>
Wirka said that is plain silly because the amount of "foreign oil" in diapers 
is negligible and the so-called degradables also contain some oil. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble, with a $1.65-billion slice of the 
disposable pie -- compared to Kimberly-Clark's $840 million -- has taken a much 
higher profile in its fight to keep baby's bottom in Pampers and Luvs. 
</P>
<P>
Although close-mouthed about how much it is spending on the diaper wars, P 
&amp; G is sponsoring two well-publicized projects, one in Seattle 
demonstrating that plastic diapers can be recycled and another in St. Cloud, 
Minn., to show that diapers can be composted. The Seattle project is reputed to 
be a $500,000 venture. 
</P>
<P>
"If you could throw that kind of money at every segment of the trash problem in 
America, we wouldn't have a trash problem," said Jeffrey Tryens of the Council 
for Policy Alternatives, a Washington-based environmental group. "It's just 
good public relations for Procter &amp; Gamble." 
</P>
<P>
Wirka, however, thinks the St. Cloud project may have some merit, although, she 
said: "That recycling project is just bogus. 
</P>
<P>
"Procter &amp; Gamble is in a difficult position. They are always the target 
here and they are applying their corporate good guy image on something that is 
economically very dubious. I'm more willing to say that the composting project 
is a more fruitful use of their resources." 
</P>
<P>
P&amp;G, it should be noted, has been a leader in recycling plastic bottles for 
its products, selling refills for the same plastic bottle and marketing 
concentrates in smaller bottles where the consumer just needs to add water. Its 
soaps are also biodegradable. 
</P>
<P>
Since the diaper wars started making the nightly news shows, politicians have 
gotten bolder. Tryens said he called a meeting about a year ago, inviting 
legislators, lobbyists, environmentalists and others concerned about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, nobody even considered discussing a statewide ban," he said. 
"The feeling was that no respectable politician would even propose such 
legislation and that it just wouldn't fly." 
</P>
<P>
But one year later, the state of Vermont is proposing just such legislation as 
part of a much larger environmental bill. If passed, no disposable diapers 
would be sold in Vermont after 1993.

   P&amp;G Drops Plans
   To Market Maalox
   For Rhone-Poulenc

   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. dropped its plans to market Maalox
antacid and other Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. products, bowing
to an antitrust lawsuit by the Justice Department.
   Federal prosecutors had challenged the marketing pact in a
lawsuit filed this month because it would give P&amp;G, makers of
Pepto-Bismol, too big a share of the over-the-counter stomach
remedies market. Justice Department officials estimate that
P&amp;G and Rorer had combined sales of $236 million in that $900
million market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While both companies still assert that joining forces
doesn't create antitrust problems, they decided they'd rather
quit than fight the U.S. government.
   For Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the immediate impact of the
failed marriage is a $30 million reduction in its pretax
income for fiscal 1990. That was the one-time payment
expected from P&amp;G for the right to market Maalox and other
products.
   In 1989, Rorer Group Inc. reported net income of $86.5
million on sales of $1.2 billion. This year Paris-based
Rhone-Poulenc S.A., a chemical company, merged most of its
drug business with Rorer, of Fort Washington, Pa., to form
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer.
   The marketing and distribution pact included several
over-the-counter and prescription drugs, such as Perdiem, a
laxative, and Ascriptin, a combination analgesic-antacid. But
Maalox seemed to be the most appealing label to P&amp;G because
it is the leading antacid in the U.S., with about a 15%
market share. The marketing agreement also was an inexpensive
way for P&amp;G to launch new products under the Maalox name.
   Now some industry experts say P&amp;G will unveil its own
antacid brand or sell new products under the Pepto-Bismol
name. P&amp;G offered no clues, saying only that it remains
interested in antacids.
   Although Rhone-Poulenc Rorer says it will continue to
manage the Maalox business, as well as the other brands,
others expect new suitors to offer marketing proposals.
   The dilemma for Rorer in the past has been how to spend
heavily on Maalox marketing while also building its research
and development program. P&amp;G was a good partner because it
has the marketing clout to build up the brand.
   "The vast majority of the drug industry was interested the
last time, so there are plenty of places to go," said Gary
Stibel, a consultant with New England Consulting Group, which
has represented drug companies in such ventures. "The
question is, what will the feds allow?"

   Kimberly-Clark Corp., eager to build its share of the
disposable diaper market, is introducing a new line of
Huggies diapers.
   Huggies Baby Steps will replace the existing Huggies line
and offer more sizes, increased absorbency and better fit,
according to a company spokeswoman.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The move is likely to escalate promotional and advertising
spending between Dallas-based Kimberly-Clark and archrival
Procter &amp; Gamble Co., makers of Pampers and Luvs. P&amp;G is in
the process of a national launch of Pampers Phases, a diaper
that comes in seven different sizes.
   Kimberly-Clark, unlike P&amp;G, skipped the test-market stage
and will ship the new product to retailers in the Western
U.S. in October. Kimberly-Clark will take only "a period of
months" before expanding the product to the rest of the
states, the spokeswoman said.
   What remains to be seen is whether all these improvements
do anything to change the two companies' market shares.
Huggies has about 33% of the market, followed by Pampers' 26%
and Luvs 22%, according to estimates from Salomon Brothers.

   Cloth-Diaper Use

   New industry-sponsored research suggests that cloth
diapers may increase the risk of diarrhea outbreaks in
day-care centers, a finding that could imperil legislation to
encourage cloth diaper use.
   The study was funded in large part by Procter &amp; Gamble
Co., whose Luvs and Pampers hold about 50% of the $3.5
billion-a-year U.S. disposable-diaper business. It was
conducted by researchers at University of Texas Medical
School in Houston.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Environmental groups have pressed state legislatures for
over a year to lift restrictions on cloth diapers in day-care
centers, charging that throw-away products are clogging
landfills. About eight states are considering legislation to
permit cloth diapers in day-care centers where health worries
earlier had prompted cloth-diaper bans.
   The new study is the most recent action by disposable
diaper companies to fend off legislation favoring cloth
diapers. Kimberly-Clark Corp., maker of Huggies, lobbied
against a proposed law in Wisconsin that would have taxed
disposables. And Procter &amp; Gamble funded a controversial
study that concluded that cloth diapers can be as
environmentally damaging as disposables. "P&amp;G has a real
concern about these laws," said Bonita Austin, an analyst
with Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., New York.
   The new Texas study, published in this week's issue of the
Journal of the American Medical Association, found a
significant increase in the amount of diarrhea-causing germs
on a variety of surfaces -- such as toys and changing pads --
when several day-care centers used cloth diapers.
   Researchers suggested that diarrhea-causing germs, which
reside in feces, can escape from cloth diapers more readily
than from disposables. Previous research said the risk of
contracting diarrhea is about three times higher for infants
at a day-care center than at home. Those previous studies
suggested that bacteria was spread by careless hygiene
practices and that diarrhea outbreaks could be reduced if
day-care workers took greater care to wash their hands after
changing diapers.
   The new study didn't find any actual increase in diarrhea
outbreaks when cloth diapers were used. Larry Pickering, who
led the research, said the study was too small to find a
difference in outbreaks, only an increase in bacterial
contamination.
   Dr. Pickering has conducted numerous studies of diarrhea
among infants. In an interview, he acknowledged that Procter
&amp; Gamble provided about $80,000 for the study, about 80% of
its cost. The company's support for the research wasn't noted
by the researchers in the published report. "The company
helped pay for the study, but that didn't affect the way we
carried it out," Dr. Pickering said.

<HEAD>Procter and Gamble Agrees to Sell Cheboygan Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHEBOYGAN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. says it will sell
its northern Michigan paper factory and drop production of the
tissue used in disposable diapers.
   Mosinee Paper Corp. of Wisconsin has agreed in principle to buy
the Cheboygan factory, Procter &amp; Gamble plant Manager Phil Baker
said Monday.
   The plant manufactures the tissue paper that wraps around the
absorbent stuffing of disposable diapers, and also makes liners for
underwear and incontinent briefs. About a third of the plant's
production is devoted to diaper tissue, Baker said.
   The Cheboygan plant employs 305 people. It employed as many as
700 people 10 years ago, when P&amp;G manufactured Pampers diapers
there.
   The company wanted to sell the plant and transfer the
manufacture of its liners and briefs to other P&amp;G plants, said
spokeswoman Sue Hale at corporate headquarters in Cincinnati.
   ``There are some savings in distribution, overhead and such
costs,'' she said of the planned sale. ``It was purely an economic
move.''
   The company will stop making the tissue for diapers altogether,
buying it on the open market instead. ``Basically we were able to
identify a supplier that we could obtain the tissue from at a
savings,'' Hale said.
   Baker said design changes over the years have reduced the amount
of tissue needed in each diaper, reducing demand and making it
cheaper to buy than make.
   Mosinee, which produces industrial tissue and towel products and
specialty papers, uses different raw materials and sells to a
different market, Baker said.
   The sale will be final in March 1990 but P&amp;G will continue
manufacturing there until the fall of 1990, Baker said. No sale
price was disclosed.
   The sale hinges on Mosinee reaching a labor agreement with the
United Paperworkers International union, which has a contract with
P&amp;G that expires this fall. No negotiations have begun.
   Before the sale is final, Mosinee also must receive state
permits to discharge treated water into the Cheboygan River.
   The paper mill opened in 1906 and has had a long succession of
owners, including the Simplicity Pattern Co. and the Charmin Paper
Co.

   Just after New Year's day, investment bankers for Revlon
Inc. Chairman Ronald O. Perelman began quietly looking for
someone to buy the glitzy cosmetics company. Within days,
Procter &amp; Gamble Co. came calling. Just a month later, P&amp;G's
relatively new chairman, Edwin Artzt, was meeting personally
with Mr. Perelman, and P&amp;G now appears the front-runner in an
international competition for Revlon.
   This hardly seems like the stodgy soap maker of
Cincinnati. But P&amp;G's aggressive interest in Revlon is just
the latest move by Mr. Artzt to put his own stamp on the
formal, slow-moving company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In fact, Mr. Artzt has been on the warpath since he was
named to P&amp;G's top spot. He has told managers of faltering
brands, like Citrus Hill orange juice, to get results or
he'll sell the business. He has cut spending for once-sacred
projects, like the fat substitute olestra, to focus on
best-sellers like superconcentrated Tide detergent and Pert
Plus shampoo. And he is clearing out managers who don't
perform.
   "I certainly don't want to have a short trigger with
people and not give them a chance," he says. "But sure I've
cleared out deadwood. Probably some of it was still breathing
when it was cleared out."
   P&amp;G wasn't doing all that badly before Mr. Artzt took the
helm. In fact, when the low-key John G. Smale stepped down in
late 1989 after an 18% profit surge that fiscal year, Mr.
Artzt was thought by many to be only a caretaker replacement.
   But Mr. Artzt is confronting a maturing market for many of
the company's staple products, such as diapers and
detergents, while at the same time P&amp;G's competitors have
become more aggressive.
   In response, Mr. Artzt wants to turn P&amp;G into more of a
fast-moving global marketer, particularly in high-growth
areas such as cosmetics and health-care products.
   The global race explains in part Mr. Artzt's urgency in
seeking at least parts of Revlon, whose products include Max
Factor lipstick and Halston perfume, and which is known for
its international marketing and distribution operation.
   Some competitors in the broad personal-care market, such
as the Dutch Unilever Group and Kao Corp. of Japan, have been
expanding into international markets at a much faster rate
than P&amp;G. Unilever, for example, spent $3 billion to acquire
55 businesses in 1989 alone. The Dutch company, which had
1990 sales of $39.6 billion, operates in more than 75
countries, while P&amp;G is in 46. P&amp;G has been on the move,
though; a decade ago, it had operations in just 22 countries.
   Other companies -- Unilever, Kao and France's L'Oreal S.A.
-- also have expressed interest in all or parts of Revlon.
But thus far, P&amp;G has shown the most interest, sending teams
to study Revlon businesses in Germany, Brazil, Spain and
Japan.
   P&amp;G got into the cosmetics business two years ago with the
purchase of Noxell and its Cover Girl and Clarion brands,
and, according to Mr. Artzt, it likes what it has seen. "I
don't know of any place that's not a good beauty-care
market," he says.
   "Maybe not the Middle East," he adds. "I haven't peeked
under those veils."
   The eldest son of musicians, the 60-year-old Mr. Artzt won
a basketball scholarship to the University of Oregon, where
he studied journalism. After working as a sportswriter and a
theater critic in Hollywood, he answered a newspaper ad for a
P&amp;G sales job.
   At the company's Cincinnati headquarters, he soon earned
the nickname "Prince of Darkness" because he spent so many
nights at work. "We swore he slept upside down in his office
hanging by his toes," says Lee Wotherspoon, who worked as a
brand manager with Mr. Artzt.
   He recalls how Mr. Artzt would descend the corporate
elevators at 10 p.m., only to return to his office for more
files. "He has an insatiable appetite for work," says Mr.
Wotherspoon, now a career consultant in Newton, N.H.
   It was work thousands of miles from Cincinnati that
eventually won Mr. Artzt the CEO post. He is credited with
reviving P&amp;G's struggling overseas operations, from which the
company will soon be deriving more than half of its sales. In
Japan, for example, he turned a money-losing operation into a
big profit center by tailoring diapers and detergents to
local tastes.
   Still, his appointment as chief executive surprised many
associates, who'd expected the company's president, John E.
Pepper, to be chosen. Mr. Artzt took over a company whose
revenue of $24 billion last year was double that of a decade
earlier. Net income for the fiscal year ended June 30 rose
33%, to $1.6 billion.
   But that hasn't stopped Mr. Artzt from shaking things up.
One of his first targets: the food and beverage division,
where Fisher Nut, Citrus Hill and Crisco shortening have
stalled. For instance, sales of shortening have tumbled
steeply since the mid-1980s, as consumers have reduced their
fat intake, while Citrus Hill remains a lagging third behind
Minute Maid and Tropicana orange juice.
   "When he gets numbers he doesn't like, he'll be stalking
the floors to find the people who produced them," says one
manager, who notes that Mr. Artzt is a frequent visitor these
days to the food and beverage division. "If you see Ed coming
down the hall, look out."
   In a business review last year, Mr. Artzt didn't mince
words about his disdain for a faltering nut business acquired
by his predecessor. "Can I get my money back?" he asked.
   Mr. Artzt describes his management style as "helpful and
supportive." On a Harvard recruiting trip, he singled out a
P&amp;G intern, recalling in detail her summer projects.
Nevertheless, he sometimes yells and curses when he is angry.
   That hands-on approach unnerves some subordinates, but
what challenges them the most is his demand for speed. As
international chief, Mr. Artzt pushed for quick expansion of
P&amp;G's Always sanitary napkins. Within 31 months, the product
was in 31 countries. Now it's the No. 1 or No. 2 brand in
major markets, giving P&amp;G about 12% of the $8 billion global
market.
   Today, product launches that once took years may take only
months. Being quick is essential now that smaller competitors
like Kimberly-Clark Corp. are moving faster. P&amp;G's launch of
ultra-thin diapers in the mid-1980s was supposed to give it a
three- to five-year lead time, but Kimberly-Clark caught up
within months.
   "Historically, Procter was very patient and would take a
long time to make a business work," says Gary Stibel of New
England Consulting Group. It spent two decades researching
olestra before seeking government approval. "Artzt is
collapsing the P&amp;G time frame," he says.
   Lately, P&amp;G has felt recession pressures as U.S. consumers
limit purchases of its premium-priced products. While some
overseas markets are growing faster than expected, in the
U.S. "many consumer-product markets are off a percentage
point or two," Mr. Artzt acknowledges. He has been closely
reviewing the spending plans of every business segment and
trimming some budgets. "We have to sharpen our priorities"
for capital spending, he says.
   A clear priority is building what he calls "world brands."
He points to Pert Plus, a combination shampoo-conditioner
that's now the world's best-selling brand. Launched first in
the U.S., Pert Plus is being rolled out quickly around the
globe, although often under different labels. It's sold as
Vidal Sassoon in Britain, for example, and Rejoy in Japan.
"We'll definitely have more of our brands become world
brands," Mr. Artzt says.
   That's part of the reason P&amp;G is trying to expand in the
beauty-care business, where there is strong demand in Japan
and Europe and big potential elsewhere. P&amp;G also needs
cosmetics to freshen its product mix, since some of its
items, like Duncan Hines cake mixes and Crisco shortening,
are stale. "Nobody makes two-layer cakes or deep fries
chicken anymore," says a former P&amp;G staffer.
   For P&amp;G, which typically perfects products in the lab for
years before doing painstaking market research, cosmetics is
still foreign territory. This is a business where packaging
often counts more than product quality, and advertising
slogans promise "pure, raw sensuality," not "pure white"
laundry.
   But cosmetics companies increasingly are emphasizing skin
protection and other health concerns, not just appearance.
"That starts to come right down our alley," says Mr. Artzt.
   P&amp;G plans to use its enormous research and development
base to launch new products for the Noxell cosmetic business.
The company has long been famous for gaining market
leadership by introducing products that offer an innovation,
such as Tide with bleach.
   At Noxell, it's also been cutting distribution costs while
expanding markets for Cover Girl, Navy perfume and other
brands. And it has streamlined its traditionally cumbersome
marketing methods. "If they want to change five or six makeup
colors, we're not putting them through the same kind of
procedures that we go through to change Tide or Pampers," Mr.
Artzt says.
   Upscale Revlon would give P&amp;G, which already controls a
good deal of supermarket and drug-store shelf space, the kind
of greater mass essential to building profit margins and more
global markets.
   After meeting Mr. Perelman in Cincinnati, Mr. Artzt
assigned teams of dozens of marketing, financial operating
and legal staffers to review Revlon's businesses, mostly
those overseas. The thorough nature of these examinations has
surprised Revlon's top management, including Mr. Perelman,
who recently noted to investment bankers that Revlon itself
has bought companies on much less information than what P&amp;G
now possesses about his company.
   It isn't clear whether P&amp;G is interested in buying all of
Revlon or simply certain pieces. The whole company might cost
more than $3 billion.
   Depending on what P&amp;G goes after, there could be antitrust
problems. P&amp;G's Cover Girl has about 23% of the mass-market
cosmetics business in all outlets, while Revlon's Max Factor
and Almay and Revlon lines account for 21%.
   The Justice Department has already thwarted one of Mr.
Artzt's earlier attempts to market Rhone-Poulenc Rorer's
Maalox because P&amp;G already sells Pepto Bismol, a stomach
remedy. Both P&amp;G and Revlon lawyers have concluded that in
the event of a merger, they would try to convince the
government that the cosmetics market is more fragmented than
what the mass market numbers show. They don't include, for
example, the sales of door-to-door operators such as Avon
Products Inc.
   Last Thursday, Revlon officials feared their talks with
P&amp;G and others might be jeopardized when news of them
surfaced. But Mr. Artzt telephoned Mr. Perelman to tell him
that P&amp;G still intended to go full speed ahead with the
talks, people familiar with the conversation say.

<HEAD>Competitors Must Pay Procter &amp; Gamble $125 Million For Recipe Ripoff</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three major cookie manufacturers have
been ordered to pay Procter &amp; Gamble Co. $125 million to settle a
5-year-old patent infringement case.
   Chief U.S. District Judge Joseph J. Longobardi signed a consent
judgment Tuesday, saying Keebler Co. of Elmhurst, Ill., Nabisco
Brands Inc. of East Hanover, N.J., and Frito-Lay Inc. of Dallas,
infringed on Procter &amp; Gamble's patent for homestyle cookies
marketed under the Duncan Hines label.
   The case was scheduled to go to trial in October, but an
agreement among the companies was reached late Monday that says
Procter &amp; Gamble's patents are valid and enforceable, according to
Donald P. Tassone, spokesman for the Cincinnati-based company.
   Keebler is to pay $52.9 million for the Soft Batch cookie it
introduced in 1984; Nabisco will pay $52.9 million for its Almost
Home Brand; and Frito-Lay will pay $19.1 million for its Grandmas
Rich and Chewy product.
   Once the lawsuit was filed, the formulas for the three products
were changed.
   Procter &amp; Gamble said after it test-marketed its soft cookie in
January 1983, the three competitors pirated the formula and beat it
to the market.
   The company sued the three in 1984.
   The competitors countered that the patent was not valid.
   ``It was very frustrating to see our competitors, who were
already in the cookie business, beating us to market in most of the
country with the very product we had developed and patented,'' said
John E. Pepper, president of Procter &amp; Gamble.
   The cookie brand never reached its projected market share,
Tassone said.
   ``The settlement will help, but it will not make up for what we
lost,'' he said.
   Nabisco said it was ``delighted the protracted legal battle was
settled and that the settlement will not hurt parent RJR Nabisco's
earnings.
   Frito-Lay said the settlement will be paid by insurance and will
have no effect on the earnings of its parent company, PepsiCo Inc.
   Stuart L. Greenblatt, spokesman for Keebler, said homestyle
cookies have not been the market blockbuster that was originally
anticipated.
   The cookies' market share began declining ``almost as soon as
they were introduced,'' said Manfredi.
   ``The cookies didn't turn out to be the bonanza expected,'' said
James F. Burnett of Potter, Anderson &amp; Corroon, which represented
Frito-Lay.

   NEW YORK -- When a growth stock falters, investors find it
hard to forgive and forget.
   That's what happened to Procter &amp; Gamble's stock. It
tripped in the past year after a long stellar performance and
everybody started taking potshots at it.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But lately, with investors turning back to consumer stocks
again, some people have cast a kinder eye on Procter &amp;
Gamble. The Cincinnati titan's chairman, Edwin Artzt, is
fighting hard to defend the company's diapers and detergents
from competitors' assaults, analysts say.
   With help from new kinds of Pampers diapers, Crest
toothpaste pumps and Tide detergent they expect the company
to show improved profit some time next year; indeed, after a
tough fiscal 1991 they say Procter &amp; Gamble can hardly help
looking better next year. Meanwhile, they're hoping for a
nice surprise: though the company denies it, many people
think it will sell parts of its stodgy food business, a drag
on profit.
   Yesterday, Procter &amp; Gamble reported uninspiring results
for its fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30. Per-share profit
was 83 cents, up from 78 cents a year earlier.
   "People may be thinking the worst is already reflected" in
Procter &amp; Gamble's stock, says Alice Beebe Longley, a
Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette analyst. This week she reaffirmed
her enthusiasm for the stock and she declares: "I'm in favor
of buying before everybody thinks this is a stock they have
to own."
   In recent weeks, Procter &amp; Gamble has been zipping along
with more popular consumer stocks. It touched 83 1/8 this
week, before slipping to 81 1/4, down 1, yesterday. In late
June, it dipped as low as 77 1/4 after months of wretched
performance that left it trailing the broad market. As long
as investors are unsure when the economy will recover, big,
stable consumer stocks "are a good place to hide," says
Oppenheimer's market analyst Michael Metz.
   Procter &amp; Gamble may not be a stock for anyone who wants
to see a surge in profit in the next couple of quarters. But
a few long-term investors who think the stock has been
punished enough have bought it recently. ("They used to love
it, now they think it's a big ugly stock that's been hurt
enough" says one holder, a New York money manager.) And one
bear who was targeting Procter &amp; Gamble for another fall
concedes that he recently backed off.
   Today, Procter &amp; Gamble's stock is actually about 6% lower
than it was at the end of 1990; the Dow Jones equity market
index is about 19% higher. And because Procter &amp; Gamble's
double-digit growth has faltered, its stock is perhaps
deservedly cheaper than sexier consumer shares. Currently, it
sells for about 14.5 times estimated 1992 profit, using
Kidder Peabody's estimate for calendar 1992. Coca-Cola has a
price-earnings ratio of more than 20.
   A Procter &amp; Gamble spokesman says, "Did you notice our
profit was up 11%?" for fiscal 1991. He adds: "Given the
recessionary environment in the past six months to a year,
and given our strong spending on new-product initiatives, we
feel good about our current numbers."
   Analysts generally expect Procter &amp; Gamble to earn about
$5.30 a primary share in the fiscal year ending in June 1992.
Though the Street's consensus calls for about $5.75 a share
the following year, bulls expect a much bigger fiscal 1993
jump.
   The company's problems haven't gone away. In its best
businesses it is fighting a costly and unending war for a
bigger share of consumers' dollars. It has had to spend
heavily to defend its soaps against those of giants such as
Unilever and its diapers against Kimberly-Clark's. And in its
food business, where it isn't such a dominant player, the
company is plagued by competitors' price-cutting.
   New products are expensive to launch. "You're looking at a
company that spends $2 billion-plus a year on marketing,"
says Merrill Lynch analyst Deepak Raj. Procter &amp; Gamble's
latest offering, recently launched in Midwestern markets, is
seven different sized diapers for different sized babies; the
company won't say how much they cost to roll out. The
company's less-fattening fat substitute Olestra, which isn't
even on the market yet, so far has cost more than $180
million to develop, according to Prudential Securities.
   New York money manager Martin Sosnoff of Atalanta/Sosnoff
Capital foresees no end in coming years to the multinational
consumer companies' costly war for market share. He cut back
his Procter &amp; Gamble holding this year and says bluntly:
"It's a boring stock." For many big consumer companies,
including some in Atalanta/Sosnoff's portfolio, he thinks the
brightest years may be over.
   Some Procter &amp; Gamble fans say they won't get back into
the stock until they see stronger profit or hear good news
about the food business, which some people value at $2
billion or more. Product brands include Folger's coffee,
Hawaiian Punch, Pringles, Duncan Hines, Crisco and Citrus
Hill orange juice.
   At a big money management firm that unloaded about one
million Procter &amp; Gamble shares earlier this year, an analyst
says: "In six months time, I'll take another look at the
stock." The company "can sell some product lines, maybe
orange juice, and turn some around," he suggests; that way,
it can show it's "serious" about getting back onto a growth
track.
   But if the U.S. market is tough, Procter &amp; Gamble is going
gangbusters overseas. It gets almost 30% of total operating
profit abroad and is growing faster there than many U.S.
consumer companies, says Merrill's Mr. Raj. Foreign profit,
up 13% in fiscal 1991, could help the whole company to grow
faster in future years, analysts say. Back home, Procter &amp;
Gamble's profit from operations for fiscal 1991 edged up a
meager 4%.
   Says Donaldson Lufkin's Ms. Longley: "Overseas, they have
terrific momentum."

   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Monday it is merging
its paper products businesses in Italy, Spain, Portugal and the
United Kingdom with those of the Fater group of companies.
   The companies declined to reveal terms of the agreement. The
Fater companies are a privately held group based in Pescara, Italy.
   Procter &amp; Gamble and Fater said the joint effort assures their
future within the increasingly competitive European market. The
joint venture also accelerates P&amp;G's entry into the European market
for feminine sanitary napkin and adult incontinence products,
because of Fater's success in those markets, P&amp;G officials said.
   Under the agreement, a new company will be formed in Italy under
dual control. This company will include the present Fater
businesses making and selling sanitary napkins, disposable baby
diapers and adult incontinence products; the Fameccanica machinery
company; the Faricerca, Faidata and Fatecnica research companies,
and P&amp;G's Pampers baby diaper business.
   In Spain and Portugal, Ausonia and Lepori businesses will be
combined with the Arbora company, which Procter &amp; Gamble jointly
controls with the Agrolimen group. In the United Kingdom, the
Swaddlers company will be integrated within P&amp;G.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, based in Cincinnati, had $24 billion in
worldwide sales for the fiscal year ended June 30.

   The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Tuesday it is
forming a joint venture to do business in Venezuela with a
Venezuelan manufacturer of disposable diapers and other infant care
products.
   Procter &amp; Gamble said the joint venture with Industrias Mammi,
C.A., of Caracas, Venezuela, is subject to approval by the
Venezuelan government. P&amp;G, a Cincinnati-based company which makes
and sells food and personal-care products worldwide, declined to
reveal terms of the agreement.
   Mammi makes and markets disposable diapers, other baby care
items and feminine protection products. It employs about 500 people
and owns and operates a manufacturing facility near Caracas.
   Procter &amp; Gamble de Venezuela, C.A., is based in Caracas and has
operated since 1950. It has plants in Caracas and Barquisimeto that
together employ about 1,000 people. P&amp;G's Venezuelan subsidiary
makes and sells detergent, bar soap, toothpaste, dishwashing liquid
and shampoo products.
   Procter &amp; Gamble had worldwide sales of $19.3 billion in fiscal
1987-88. About one-third of that total was overseas sales. The
company sells products in more than 140 countries.

<TEXT>
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Tuesday it had
sued a southeast Kansas couple for allegedly spreading rumors _
which it has denied for years _ that the company was associated
with satanism.
   The suit filed late Monday in U.S. District Court, alleges that
James and Linda Newton of Parsons have made libelous and malicious
statements about Procter &amp; Gamble by saying it supports ``the
church of Satan.''
   The couple also allegedly urged people to boycott Procter &amp;
Gamble products.
   A company news release said the Newtons are distributors of
household items for rival Amway Home Products, ``as were several
individuals who previously admitted spreading these lies.''
   ``It appears they are trying to enhance their own business,''
said Topeka attorney Edwin Smith, representing Procter &amp; Gamble.
   The company is seeking more than $50,000 in damages, and is
asking the court to order the Newtons to stop circulating the
stories.
   Mrs. Newton, reached at her home, declined to comment.
   The suit is one of a number the Cincinnati-based company has
filed over the years in an attempt to fight persistent rumors that
its ``moon and stars'' trademark is a satanic symbol.
   The 108-year-old trademark features a man-in-the-moon figure, a
popular design of the 1800s, overlooking a field of 13 stars the
company says are to honor the original American colonies.
   ``We're very proud of our company trademark symbolizing Procter
&amp; Gamble quality and excellence,'' Edwin L. Artzt, chairman and
chief executive officer, said in a news release.
   ``These lies have persisted now for 10 years, and we will file
further suits if necessary,'' he said.
   The suit alleges that in a circular, the Newtons said the moon
and stars trademark is a satanic symbol. They said the symbol is
actually a ``tiny ram's horn with three sets of stars placed in
such a way that if the stars in each set are joined they form the
number 666, known as the devil's number.''
   ``Christians should always remember that if they buy any product
with this symbol they will be taking part in the support of the
Church of Satan,'' according to the flyer, which was included in
the suit as an exhibit.
   The suit also alleges the Newtons have falsely told people that
senior Procter &amp; Gamble officials have appeared on nationally
televised talk shows acknowledging the company's ties to satanism.
   Over the past three months, the company has received 300 to 350
calls a day asking about the allegations, primarily from
southeastern United States, company officials said.
   Procter &amp; Gamble products include Pampers disposable diapers,
Crest toothpaste, Scope mouthwash, Ivory soap, Tide laundry
detergent, Folgers coffee and Head and Shoulders shampoo.
   In 1985, the company filed lawsuits in Lynchburg, Va., Scranton,
Pa., and Wichita, Kan., against people it accused of spreading
similar rumors associated the company with Satan.
   Procter &amp; Gamble also at the time began phasing out the use of
the trademark on company products, hired private investigators to
probe the spread of the rumors and established a national toll-free
telephone line to handle inquiries.

<HEAD>Marketing Deal Cancelled After Challenge by Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer Inc., facing an antitrust challenge to a joint marketing
plan, said Thursday they cancelled the agreement to avoid a legal
dispute.
   The plan to cooperate in the over-the-counter drug market would
have given P&amp;G, which makes the Pepto-Bismol stomach remedy,
exclusive rights to sell Rorer's Maalox antacid.
   The Justice Department announced a lawsuit Aug. 7 challenging
the arrangement on grounds it would reduce competition and raise
prices in the stomach remedy market.
   Randy Thurman, group president of RPR pharmaceuticals, said the
companies were confident the arrangement would survive U.S.
Department of Justice legal challenges.
   However, ``we weighed the risks of an extended court process to
RPR's consumer business, our employees and our customers and, on
balance, chose to terminate the agreement,'' Thurman said in a
statement from Rhone-Poulenc's headquarters in Fort Washington, Pa.
   Thurman said failing to close the agreement with P&amp;G could
reduce pre-tax earnings $30 million because of lost revenue from
inventory transfers.
   ``We are convinced that this alliance would have enhanced the
level of competition in the U.S. and been of value to consumers,''
P&amp;G and Rhone-Poulenc said in a joint statement.
   The agreement, announced March 13, had not taken effect, pending
government review.
   According to the Justice Department, the $236 million in
combined sales by P&amp;G and Rhone-Poulenc in the over-the-counter
stomach remedy market make up 26 percent of the $900 million market.
   P&amp;G reported worldwide sales of $24 billion for the year ending
June 30. Rhone-Poulenc reported sales of $3 billion.

   The way a mother covers her baby's bottom has
become a matter of government concern. Legislation that would ban,
restrict or discourage the use of disposable diapers is being
considered in a dozen or so states. The environment is at stake,
proponents say. Mothers would be the big losers, corn farmers
perhaps the big winners.

   It was test marketed in 1961 in, where else,
Peoria, Ill.
   And, oh, how it played.
   The disposable diaper. In the years since, it has been improved:
elasticized legs, gels, super absorbency, the anatomically more
efficient his and hers versions.
   It has become a $3.5 billion-a-year industry, with 85 percent of
America's mothers using them.
   But the disposable diaper has become a prime target of angry
environmentalists who consider it the very symbol of the ills of a
throwaway society. The problem is what to do with it once it has
done its job. Throwaway diapers clog up the waste stream.
   The way a mother covers her baby's bottom has become a subject
of hot debate in statehouses and city halls. It has generated piles
of studies, reports and pamphlets. Who would have thought the
manufacturers of disposable diapers would have to go to such
lengths to defend such a wonder product?
   Bills either to ban, restrict or tax disposable diapers are
before the legislatures of about a dozen states.
   On the other hand, the controversy has breathed new life into
the diaper service business, and could prove a boon to corn farmers.
   The rub is, although disposable diapers account for only 2
percent of the nation's trash, they will last 500 years in a
landfill. One proposed solution is the more-expensive biodegradable
diaper, and that's where the corn farmers come in.
   Jeanne Wirka, a solid-waste reduction expert with the
Environmental Action Foundation, says the disposable diaper is the
largest single one-use product for which there is a readily
available alternative _ cloth diapers.
   But the convenience factor is extraordinary. Many day care
centers, for example, will not accept youngsters in cloth diapers.
   And if everyone switched to cloth tomorrow, there would be
chaos. There are not enough cloth diapers nor cloth diaper services
in the country to accommodate them. In environmentally hip
Washington, D.C., 400 people are on the waiting list for the one
diaper service in town.
   The National Association of Diaper Services, after years of
decline, reports a 38 percent increase in business last year and a
13 percent rise the year before. The disposable diaper giants,
however, say they see no blip yet on their sales screen.
   The debate has produced strange bedfellows. The six most active
environmental groups and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Kimberly-Clark
Corp., the disposable diaper manufacturers who control 75 percent
of the market, agree that biodegradable diapers are not the answer.
   The environmentalists called for a boycott of degradable diapers
in mid-December, saying their use only assuages the conscience of
consumers who use them. Biodegradable diapers don't decompose in
landfills because there is not enough moisture or oxygen, they say.
   Taking an opposing view is the National Association of Corn
Growers, based in St. Louis. Cornstarch is used in the degradables
and this could open up a market of 150 million to 300 million
bushels a year for the nation's corn farmers, spokesman Tim Draeger
says.
   So far, the only state to enact any legislation has been
Nebraska, which passed a law last session requiring the use of
biodegradables by 1993. Nebraska, it might be noted, is the
nation's third-largest corn producing state, just behind Iowa and
Illinois.
   Draeger argues that if the biodegradable diaper technology was
improved, it would mean America would be less dependent on foreign
oil.
   ``We are in the infancy of this technology,'' he says. ``We are
at the Model T level. We have to learn to walk before we can run.''
   Ms. Wirka says that's plain silly. The amount of ``foreign oil''
in diapers is negligible and the so-called degradables also use
some.
   Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble, with a $1.65 billion slice of
the disposable pie _ compared to Kimberly-Clark's $840 million _
has taken a much higher profile in its fight to keep baby's bottom
in Pampers and Luvs, its products.
   Although close-mouthed about the money it is spending on the
diaper wars, P&amp;G is sponsoring two well-publicized projects, one in
Seattle demonstrating that plastic diapers can be recycled and
another in St. Cloud, Minn., showing diapers can be composted. The
Seattle project is reputed to be a $500,000 venture.
   ``If you could throw that kind of money at every segment of the
trash problem in America, we wouldn't have a trash problem,'' says
Jeffrey Tryens of the Council for Policy Alternatives, a
Washington-based environmental group. ``It's just good PR for
Procter and Gamble.''
   Wirka, however, thinks the St. Cloud project may have some
merit, although she says, ``That recycling project is just bogus.
   ``Procter &amp; Gamble is in a difficult position. They are always
the target here and they are applying their corporate good guy
image on something that is economically very dubious. I'm more
willing to say that the composting project is a more fruitful use
of their resources.''
   P&amp;G, it should be noted, has been a leader in recycling plastic
bottles for its products, selling refills for the same plastic
bottle and marketing concentrates in smaller bottles where the
consumer just needs to add water. Its soaps are also biodegradable.
   Since the diaper wars started making the nightly news shows,
politicians have gotten bolder. Tryens says he called a meeting
about a year ago, inviting legislators, lobbyists,
environmentalists and others concerned about the issue.
   ``At that time, nobody even considered discussing a statewide
ban,'' he says. ``The feeling was that no respectable politician
would even propose such legislation and that it just wouldn't fly.''
   Yet, one year later, the state of Vermont is proposing just such
legislation as part of a much larger environmental bill. If passed,
no disposable diapers would be sold in Vermont after 1993.
   Nancy Alexander of New Haven, Conn., is one who's profiting by
it all. She started her own cloth diaper service in January and
says clients are flocking to her door.
   ``I've always wanted to go into my own business and this just
sort of fell into my lap,'' she says. ``What's more is that all of
my clients treat me like I'm some kind of a hero.''
   One of her clients with a newborn baby said her 4-year-old was
watching her change the baby with a disposable diaper and had a
quizzical look on her face.
   ``What is it?'' asked the mother.
   ``Why don't they invent a diaper you could just wash and use
over and over?'' asked the child.

   States Mull Rash of Diaper Regulations

   Forget about complicated tax initiatives. These days, the
hottest issue in state legislatures is easier for many
consumers to understand: disposable diapers.
   With space in municipal landfills growing scarce and no
relief in sight from the flood of trash from homes and
businesses, states are pinning their hopes on regulating
disposable diapers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Already, some 20 states have pondered proposals that range
from disposable-diaper taxes to all-out bans of disposables.
   Nebraska has approved a ban on non-degradable disposable
diapers, which is slated to take effect in 1993. Legislators
in Maine have passed a law requiring day-care centers to
accept children in cloth diapers; California may follow suit.
And New York is considering requiring all hospitals to
provide new mothers with brochures that warn of the
environmental threat posed by disposables.
   Although only a handful of the legislative proposals have
been enacted, manufacturers are taking the threat very
seriously. Kimberly-Clark Corp., maker of Huggies, mobilized
100,000 Wisconsin parents this year to help defeat a state
bill that would have taxed disposables. Procter &amp; Gamble Co.,
the largest maker of disposables, recently funded a
controversial study by Arthur D. Little, a consulting firm,
that concluded disposable diapers are less damaging to the
environment than cloth ones -- a contention strongly disputed
by environmentalists.
   Disposable diapers make an appealing environmental target.
Unlike saving the Brazilian rain forests or halting acid
rain, diaper pollution is an issue that allows individuals to
play an active role in helping the environment. And, on one
level, diaper statistics sound alarming: The average tyke
goes through 7,800 diapers in the first 130 weeks of life.
Some 18 billion disposable diapers end up in landfills each
year.
   "Diapers are a neat symbol of the crimes of our disposable
society," says Jerry Taylor, legislative director at the
American Legislative Exchange Council, a Washington-based
association of state legislatures.
   But experts on both sides of the debate agree that
disposable diapers account for less than 2% of the nation's
garbage. Newspapers and magazines, for example, together
account for as much as five times that amount. Carl
Lehrburger, an Albany, N.Y., consultant who wrote a 1988
study that helped raise public concern about the problems
with disposable diapers, says diapers are far from the
biggest waste problem. While he supports reusable
alternatives to the throwaways, he says, "the issue has
gotten more attention than it deserves."
   While disposable diapers may not be an environmental
disaster, they present their makers with a public-relations
nightmare.
   P&amp;G, whose Pampers and Luvs brands account for 50% of the
$3.5 billion U.S. disposable-diaper market, is aggressively
trying to improve its image with consumers and state
legislators. To assuage consumers, the company has sent out a
brochure touting the health benefits of disposable diapers --
they help keep babies dry and cut down on diaper rash -- as
well as pointing out that making and washing cloth diapers
also harm the environment. The company ran a full-page ad in
the Boston Globe pointing out that biodegradable diapers
don't actually break down in landfills. A company spokesman
says P&amp;G doesn't plan to run further ads.
   Most recently, P&amp;G distributed to state legislators and
environmentalists the Arthur D. Little study that it
commissioned. The study compares the environmental impact of
cloth and disposable diapers over the lifetime of the
products-from manufacture through disposal. Among the
findings: Cloth diapers consume more energy and water than
their disposable counterparts. They also result in greater
air and water pollution emissions and cost more than
disposable diapers, even before cloth diaper-service costs
are included.
   Mr. Lehrburger, however, maintains the Arthur D. Little
study is flawed because, among other things, it overestimates
the cost of laundering cloth diapers.
   Kimberly-Clark is also working to get its message out and
stave off further regulatory efforts. The company has already
sent mailers defending disposables to all of its shareholders
along with its fourth-quarter results. Now, the Dallas-based
paper maker is planning to blitz parents across the U.S. with
a pro-disposables mailing.
   Even some environmental activists say the diaper
industry's lobbying and public relations campaigns are having
an effect. In addition to Wisconsin, lobbying activities by
manufacturers helped defeat a California measure that would
have required an environmental warning label on all
disposable-diaper packages. A similar proposal was derailed
in New York.
   "They've muddied the water enough to make it questionable
about what the solution should be," says Jeffrey Tryens, an
associate director of the Center for Policy Alternatives,
which helps states develop environmental and economic
policies.
   Nonetheless, even diaper marketers concede the issue is
unlikely to disappear. Although diapers account for a
fraction of all waste, states are likely to welcome any
solution as the nation's garbage crisis worsens. And unlike
curbside recycling projects, banning or restricting diapers
doesn't require cities to build expensive facilities.
   Many of the proposals introduced during the past year are
unlikely to surface again. Several states considered bans on
all but so-called degradable diapers, a concept that has been
discredited, since nothing breaks down in airtight,
moisture-proof landfills. But given the number and variety of
legislative initiatives introduced, some of the legislation
is likely to eventually pass into law. "The heat will
definitely continue for disposables," says Roger Bognar,
manager of the tissue paper division of the American Paper
Institute.
   But so far, the environmental angst hasn't translated into
declining sales for disposable diapers. Despite environmental
concerns and little population growth, sales of disposable
diapers increased about 1.3% last year, according to Bonita
Austin, a consumer products analyst at Wertheim Schroeder &amp;
Co.
   Few consumers, it seems, are willing to sacrifice the
convenience of disposable diapers to save the planet.
   Although Terry Edwards, who lives in suburban Chicago,
sorts her garbage into five separate bins to facilitate
recycling, she says she wouldn't consider using cloth diapers
on her four-month-old son. "I don't want smelly diapers
around my house," she says. "The diaper manufacturers should
come up with a better product or a better way to handle
them."

   Forty minutes into the hit movie "Raising Arizona," protagonist Herbert McDunnough races down a grocery-store aisle, dodging a spray of bullets, in search of diapers for a baby he kidnapped. 
He tears past Pampers and Luvs and snatches a sack of Huggies-brand disposable diapers. 

   So far, some five million Americans have viewed the scene in which Kimberly-Clark Corp.'s Huggies triumph over the competing brands. 
Priceless publicity -- and it was free. 
The film's writer and producer, Ethan Cohen, says he chose Huggies because the name "sounded funnier than any other brand name." 

   Go ahead and laugh, says Kimberly-Clark -- as long as Huggies keep disappearing from the store shelves. 
Today, three out of 10 disposable diapers sold in America are Huggies. 
Kimberly-Clark's success in the highly profitable, ultracompetitive diaper business has amazed people in the consumer-product industry. 
Huggies have dealt a blow to competitor Pampers and their maker, Procter &amp; Gamble, which in fiscal 1985 reported its first operating earnings decline in 33 years; the drop was due partly to its so-called diaper wars with Kimberly-Clark. 

   And the triumph clinched Kimberly-Clark's evolution from a staid paper company to a plucky consumer-product competitor, selling such durable name brands as Kleenex and Kotex and such successful newcomers as Lightdays panty liners. 
In 1970, Kimberly-Clark was a lumbering manufacturing company with the headquarters in poky Neenah, Wis. 
Today, it has shiny offices in Neenah, Dallas and Atlanta, with squadrons of marketing executives and million-dollar research and development labs, where babies crawl about with temperature and humidity sensors trailing from their tails. 
Last year, consumer products accounted for 78% of the company's $4.3 billion in sales and 70% of its operating profit. 

   "People don't smile anymore when they hear Neenah, Wis.," says Jerry DellaFemina, the chairman of DellaFemina, Travisano &amp; Partners, a big New York ad agency, which has never handled a Kimberly-Clark account. 
"It used to be, 'God, they're behind the times. 
The big guys {in consumer products} will come in and clean their clocks.'" 

   Kimberly-Clark's goal in the 1970s and 1980s, to soften the wild swings of the commodities business by diversifying, was a common one in American industry and yet uncommonly tricky. 
Many corporations failed in similar attempts. 

   Kimberly-Clark succeeded with a slow and careful diversification into the fiercely competitive consumer-product industry. 
It focused on products linked to its core industry. 
Much of the filling inside a Huggies diaper, for example, comes from a Kimberly-Clark pulp mill in Coosa Pines, Ala. 
The linings are produced in plants in North Carolina, Mississippi and Wisconsin. 

   Added to that was the company's doggedness, even when a product faltered, and its trailblazing use of media. 
Television ads for Kimberly-Clark's Kotex sanitary napkins in the 1970s ended the taboo on advertising feminine products. 
The company hopes to duplicate its success with its advertising of Depend undergarments for incontinent adults. 
Its flops, which include a germ-killing facial tissue that consumers sneezed at, not into, have been relatively few. 

   The transformation of Kimberly-Clark is largely the work of Darwin E. Smith, the amiable, 61-year-old chairman since 1971. 
When Mr. Smith took control of the company, management was gliding along on past successes. 
Kimberly-Clark was a major supplier of newsprint to such companies as New York Times Inc. 
Its Kleenex brand controlled one-third of the market for facial tissues, and Kotex had more than half of the sanitary-napkin market, which it pioneered in 1920. 

   Mr. Smith decided that future growth could come only from new businesses, and he began a restructuring program that shook the company's very foundations. 
He closed four large mills that produced coated paper, which was not always profitable, and laid off 3,000 workers in the process. 
He sold the paper mill that Kimberly-Clark's founders had opened in the 1880s, 323,000 acres of prime timberland and two sawmills in Northern California. 
"We were striking at some very deep-running traditions," says Mr. Smith. 

   The various divestments saved the company money and earned it more than $250 million in cash, which Mr. Smith used as a diversification war chest. 

   The battle Mr. Smith envisioned was with Procter &amp; Gamble, the king of consumer-products. 
He used his war chest to raid the marketing and research staffs of his competitors, to beef up the company's research and development efforts, and to spend on extensive advertising. 
In 1980, he supplemented Neenah with a 98-acre operating headquarters north of Atlanta, increasing the company's ability to recruit white-collar staff. 

   The arena in which Mr. Smith decided to fight Procter &amp; Gamble was disposable diapers. 
The market was relatively new -- the first disposable diapers were introduced in the early 1960s -- enormous and, with a new baby boom beginning, poised to explode. (Current studies show that each child under the age of two goes through 2,300 diapers a year, which makes a market of $3 billion in the United States alone.) 

   Kimberly-Clark had already achieved some success in the diaper business, but it was short-lived. 
In 1968, the company introduced a disposable diaper designed to compete with Pampers. 
Called Kimbies, the diapers within a year snared 20% of the market in each city in which they were introduced. 
But management rested on its laurels. 
It shifted its focus away from keeping Kimbies as the market's innovation leader -- the very aspect that had enabled the brand to so quickly snag Pampers' market share -- and sales declined. 
By the mid-1970s, many of the company's executives had concluded the brand was a failure. 
They recommended the company withdraw from the business. 

   Mr. Smith rejected the idea. 
He felt disposable diapers were the embodiment of Kimberly-Clark's strengths: its expertise in paper and its growing marketing flair. 
In 1978, he brought out Huggies -- virtually the same diapers as Kimbies but with a new hourglass shape, a new, more absorbent filling, a fresh name and extensive marketing support. 
The brand took off and now accounts for 26% of the company's sales. 
Recently, it replaced Kleenex as the flagship brand of the company. 

   Turning the corner into consumer products was tricky, and a key element of Mr. Smith's strategy was blending the old operations with the new. 
Kimberly-Clark's profit margins on diapers and other paper-based products are generally higher than its competitors, thanks to the integration of the two sides of the business. 

   For this reason, Mr. Smith makes sure the paper-product managers and workers don't feel inferior to their counterparts at the more glamorous marketing divisions. 

   "It's a fine, fine line you've got to walk," says Mr. Smith, a down-to-earth executive who tours plants in blue jeans and running shoes. 
When he visits the huge Coosa Pines, Ala., pulp mill, he reminds workers there would be no diaper sales without the efficient production of fluff pulp, the diapers' absorbent. 
The theme recurs in the four "fireside chats" he has videotaped for the company's 19,000 domestic employees this year. (Kimberly-Clark spends large sums modernizing its football-field-length paper machines, having spent $150 million on the Coosa Pines mill alone in the past five years.) 

   After a few near-tumbles, the company has learned to be vigilant with its marketing successes. 
In the late 1970s, sales of Kleenex tissues stagnated, and the brand was having trouble maintaining a third of the market. 
Research showed that consumers preferred competing brands because they were softer. (In fact, the company had gradually increased the level of recycled wood pulp in the tissues to about 50%, which made them cheaper to produce but cardboard-like.) 

   "It's kind of like horsefeed. 
You can keep stretching it with sawdust and it doesn't seem like the horse cares," says James D. Bernd, the president of the company's household-products sector. 
"Then one day, you look up and the horse is dead." 
The company gave Kleenex back its soft texture, and market share quickly jumped. 
Last year, an even softer Kleenex was introduced, incorporating expensive eucalyptus pulp. 
Kleenex now commands about half the market. 

   By early 1986, Kimberly-Clark's resilience was being tested again. 
P&amp;G had beaten the company to the market with an extra-thin diaper called "Ultra Pampers." 
Kimberly-Clark possessed the necessary technology -- super-absorbent polymers which replaced some of the bulky fluff -- and was even using it in its adult incontinence products. 
But the company delayed its plans for thin baby diapers when research showed that parents didn't think diapers were absorbent unless they doubled the size of baby's bottom. 

   The research was wrong, and Huggies' market share dropped sharply. 
The company hustled to put a thin diaper on the market -- it took six months to retool its old machines -- and Huggies regained their one-third market share, which had fallen to 25% in 1986. 

   One of the most intriguing new products invented by Kimberly-Clark was a germ-killing tissue, nicknamed Killer Kleenex by company employees and marketed under the name Avert. 
The product was an impressive blend of the old and the new. 
In 1980, company scientists discovered that disposable tissues treated with citric acid actually stopped the spread of germs. 
The tissue was tested in an experiment undertaken at the University of Wisconsin, during which poker-playing students were given germ-killing tissues to wipe their hands and noses. 
They managed to avoid catching colds from the sneezing, sniffling card player planted in each game. 
Kimberly-Clark began marketing Avert tissues in 1985. 

   But the product had two serious drawbacks: Avert's selling price per tissue was roughly four times that of regular Kleenex. 
And in practice, the tissues were good at preventing the spread of colds when used by a sick person. 
But they were no protection for a consumer who bought the tissues to avoid catching a cold. 

   "Intellectually, it's a good idea," Mr. Bernd says. 
"But the consumer said, 'No way. 
I'm not going to pay that price for something I have to use so my friend doesn't get my cold.'" 

   To try to salvage the product, Kimberly-Clark is attempting to sell Avert to institutions like schools, hospitals and offices, where the higher price might pay off through reduced levels of illness and absenteeism. 
The company has also cut the price in half. 

   The next test for Kimberly-Clark is maintaining its 50% stake in the market for adult incontinence products, which some analysts say will grow to $500 million by 1991 from its present $150 million. 
Kimberly-Clark's dominance is largely the result of its aggressive television advertising campaign, which the company launched when it introduced the product in 1980. 
For the past two years, actress June Allison has appeared on television ads for Depend adult incontinence products, frankly confronting viewers with the problem. 
Competing brands have only recently begun TV advertising. 

   Getting the advertisements on network television was a feat. 
Only recently did two of the three networks allow advertisements for adult incontinence products during prime time, after heavy lobbying by Kimberly-Clark. (NBC still restricts the ads to daytime or after 9 p.m.) 

   The company's success with a sensitive product like Depend mirrors its earlier efforts to strip the brown wrapping from sanitary napkins. 
"They're almost Oriental in their attitude toward marketing," says Mr. DellaFemina, whose agency is renowned for creating tasteful advertisements for condoms. 
"They're so patient. 
They'll figure a way to prevail, and sooner or later they win." 

   Analysts of the consumer-product industry say Kimberly-Clark has embarked on some new projects that bear watching. 
In 1984, it acquired Spenco Medical Corp., a Waco, Texas, maker of sports and healthcare products, including aerobic weights and dressings for wounds. 
The move was a departure for Kimberly-Clark: For the first time, it is producing goods that don't contain any fibers produced at its own factories. 
But many of the products do feed off Kimberly-Clark's extensive research in chemically based fibers. 

   The company has a few minor problems, including labor difficulties and currency troubles in Mexico, where it has a minority-owned factory. 
And in a Dallas federal court, the company is squaring off against its nemesis, Procter &amp; Gamble, which alleges that Kimberly-Clark has unlawfully used P&amp;G's method of elasticizing its diaper waistbands. 
Kimberly-Clark has countersued, claiming P&amp;G is illegally trying to monopolize the diaper market. (Analysts dismiss the suit as another salvo in the "diaper wars" and say the company could quickly figure out a new way to elasticize its diapers if it loses.) 

   More interesting is the question of who will succeed Mr. Smith when he retires in four years. 
But while analysts and Kimberly-Clark watchers say it will be an interesting battle -- they each tick off two to four potential successors -- they don't fear a new chief will steer Kimberly-Clark off its present course. 

   "It's a very substantive company; one man doesn't run the whole thing," says Bruce Kirk, a consumer-product analyst with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. 
"I don't look for any cataclysmic, wrenching kind of changes. 
I put my money on evolution, not revolution."

   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. claimed a victory today in

   Procter &amp; Gamble said Keebler Co., Nabisco Brands Inc. and

   The three companies agreed to a consent judgment signed by U.S.
District Judge Joseph Longobardi in Wilmington, Del., where P&amp;G had
filed its lawsuits, the company announced today.
   The Cincinnati-based P&amp;G markets its crisp and chewy cookies
under the name Duncan Hines. The company filed separate lawsuits
against Keebler, Nabisco and Frito-Lay in June 1984. The lawsuits
were consolidated for court handling and had been scheduled to go to
trial Oct. 2.
   The settlement averts the need for trial and allows the companies
to avoid trial costs.
   The agreement states that P&amp;G's patent is valid and enforceable.
The agreement prevents the three companies from infringing P&amp;G's
patent in the future, P&amp;G officials said.
   P&amp;G spokesman Donald Tassone refused today to say how much each
of the three companies would be paying P&amp;G individually. He said the
settlement agreement requires that the companies not divulge its
terms publicly.
   P&amp;G introduced its ready-to-eat, crisp and chewy cookies in 1983.
Keebler, Nabisco and Frito-Lay later introduced this same type of
cookie, P&amp;G said. Keebler is a subsidiary of United Biscuits PLC of
Britain, Nabisco is part of RJR Nabisco Inc. and Frito-Lay is owned
by PepsiCo Inc.
   The three companies altered the composition of their cookies
after P&amp;G sued, Tassone said. They no longer sell cookies that P&amp;G
regards as violating its patent, he said.
   ``We've worked hard to prove we're right, and we won,'' said John
E. Pepper, president of Procter &amp; Gamble. ``We believe this judgment
is a complete vindication of our rights under this patent.''

   NEW YORK -- Rorer Group Inc. is confident its Maalox
marketing pact with Procter &amp; Gamble Co. will pass an
antitrust review by the Justice Department.
   The companies "would not enter such an agreement unless we
had looked at it carefully and unless we were confident it
would pass that review," Ralph H. Thurman, a Rorer executive
vice president, said after a company meeting with securities
analysts. He added that responses from the Justice Department
indicate the pact will be approved.

   Justice Department officials couldn't be reached for
comment.
   P&amp;G, a Cincinnati-based consumer-products concern, has
agreed to acquire U.S. marketing and distribution rights to
Rorer's Maalox antacid and other over-the-counter products.
P&amp;G has its own over-the-counter line, including Pepto
Bismol.
   The agreement would give Rorer, a pharmaceutical concern
in Fort Washington, Pa., certain cash payments, plus rights
to develop and market some P&amp;G compounds for possible
prescription use in gastrointestinal disorders.
   Rorer has agreed to a merge with the pharmaceutical
business of Rhone-Poulenc S.A., a chemical maker based in
Paris.

SMALL O.C. FIRM HOPES BIODEGRADABLE PRODUCT SUCCESSFUL IN SOUTHLAND MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If a small Orange County firm has its way, the $3-billion disposable diaper 
industry is in for a change. 
</P>
<P>
This week Vons' 350 stores in California and Nevada began carrying throwaway 
diapers that the manufacturer, American Enviro Products Inc. of Placentia, says 
are almost entirely biodegradable. 
</P>
<P>
The move marks the first big breakthrough in Southern California by American 
Enviro, which has been selling the Bunnies diapers mostly in the Southeast 
United States since July. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between American Enviro's diapers and conventional disposable 
models, according to the manufacturer, is that the regular diapers take up to 
200 years to break down. American Enviro has developed a product that can 
dissolve within 1 1/2 to 2 years, said company President Robert Chickering. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the size of the diaper, American Enviro's products are 85-92% 
biodegradable, Chickering said Tuesday. "Our goal is to make a product that's 
100% biodegradable," he added. 
</P>
<P>
American Enviro is not the first to come up a diaper using plastic that quickly 
rots. At least two other firms already market biodegradable diapers, which are 
supposed to decompose quickly through natural processes once they are 
discarded. 
</P>
<P>
If the manufacturers are right, they could be going a long way toward solving a 
big solid-waste problem. 
</P>
<P>
About 85% of babies in the United States wear disposable diapers, totaling up 
to 18 billion discarded diapers each year -- which account for as much as 2% of 
U.S. landfill use. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists contend that the plastic-and-paper diapers do not decompose 
once they are thrown away. Instead, they become a potential source of viruses 
and bacteria that cause infectious disease. 
</P>
<P>
The biodegradable diapers use plastics mixed with cornstarch that allow 
microorganisms to attack the plastic once it is in the soil, Chickering said. 
There are also enhancers in the plastic that allow the plastic to break down 
even in landfills, where the lack of air and moisture makes decomposition 
virtually impossible, according to Chickering. A biodegradable absorbency 
powder also is used, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The technology has been available for 10 years. What has happened in the past 
two years, Chickering said, is that it has become practical and cheap enough to 
use. 
</P>
<P>
That means that Bunnies diapers retail for about $9.99 for 32 to 60 diapers, 
depending on the size. (Vons, which sells all baby products at wholesale costs, 
is selling them for $9.40 per package.) Conventional disposable diapers retail 
for $9.99 to $10.25. 
</P>
<P>
Since American Enviro began shipping Bunnies in July, about 7.5 million have 
been sold at retail outlets including Longs Drugs, Target stores and Lucky 
Stores Inc.'s Northern California supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year, Chickering estimates the 9-month-old, privately held 
company will have sold 65 million to 75 million diapers. The products are 
manufactured under contract in Porterville, Calif., Eau Claire, Wis., and 
Indianopolis. The firm employs five people at its Placentia offices. 
</P>
<P>
The disposable diaper market is dominated by Proctor &amp; Gamble Co. and 
Kimberly-Clark Corp. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Cincinnati-based Proctor &amp; Gamble, the largest disposable 
diaper maker, sells $1.65 billion worth of Pampers and Luvs annually. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at both major manufacturers have said that their diapers are as 
biodegradable as any on the market. Both are skeptical about claims by the 
biodegradable makers. 
</P>
<P>
But American Enviro and some retailers are unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very concerned as a grocery company about the environment and want to 
offer an environmentally friendly product," said Mike Roberts, grocery buyer 
for El Monte-based Vons Cos. "We have documentation from (American Enviro) and 
their test results. . . . We want to be the first (supermarket) to offer a 
biodegradable product."

   NEENAH, Wis. -- Inside an old Ford dealer's garage here,
Kimberly-Clark Corp. scientists quietly worked on a top
secret project called Omega.
   They envisioned disposable training pants, a cross between
absorbable diapers and underwear, but kept running into
snags. Lumpy pulp and plastic can't be easily sewn into
garments, and the pants couldn't be churned out on high-speed
production lines. "I wasn't too excited about the project,"
says Wayne Sanders, former head of the diaper business and
now company president.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Sanders eventually scrapped Omega with a $12 million
charge in 1987 but, convinced the idea was good, told
scientists to keep trying. The result: Huggies Pull-Ups, a
fast-seller with no competition in sight. After one year on
the market, sales of Pull-Ups are expected to soon reach $500
million a year. With a retail price of 51 cents each, twice
the price of standard baby diapers but about half the
promotional costs, Pull-Ups are enormously profitable.
They're also a big reason why Mr. Sanders has been tapped as
chief executive.
   The story of Pull-Ups shows how Kimberly-Clark, a
once-sleepy newsprint and cigarette-paper maker, has used
product innovations to tweak rival Procter &amp; Gamble Co.,
which invented disposable diapers 30 years ago. "Procter was
always the big company with the big market shares," says
analyst Bonita Austin of Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. "Now
everybody is nibbling off share, but Kimberly is taking more
than others."
   Kimberly-Clark's Huggies brand is the leading diaper line
with about 31% of the $4 billion U.S. market ahead of P&amp;G's
Pampers and Luvs brands. Likewise, other Kimberly-Clark
consumer products, like Kleenex facial tissues and Kotex
feminine care products, are market leaders.
   The architect of the company's success has been Chief
Executive Darwin Smith, a farmer by birth and lawyer by
training, who still prefers plaid flannel shirts to gray
flannel suits. When he took over 20 years ago, he was
impatient to change the backward commodity paper maker into
an innovative consumer products company.
   To do that, Mr. Smith hired a cadre of ex-P&amp;G managers and
focused on innovations from the labs rather than
acquisitions. He ditched products like charcoal, toothpaste
and detergent to focus on the basic business of making
diapers and other absorbency products. He set a simple goal:
"Make life miserable for our competitors," he said.
   But just three months into his tenure, Mr. Smith was told
he wouldn't get a chance: Doctors found a cancerous tumor in
his throat. At the age of 45, he was given a year to live.
Doctors prescribed painkillers, along with radiation
treatments, so he could deliver the address at his first
annual shareholders meeting. "It gave me a sense of wanting
to accomplish things and live to see the results," he says.
   Now 65, Mr. Smith beat the odds. During his tenure,
Kimberly-Clark's net income rose an average of 15% a year to
1990 net of $432.1 million, after a charge from the sale of a
Canadian subsidiary. Return on equity has soared to 21% from
6% when he took over. About 80% of the company's $6.4 billion
in sales now comes from consumer products.
   The company faces difficult times ahead. Price and
promotion wars in several key products, including diapers and
bathroom tissue, are cutting into profits. Kimberly
increasingly is up against cheaper store brands as well as
deep discount chain stores and warehouses. Wall Street had
been predicting fiscal 1992 earnings of between $6.40 to
$7.20 a share, but Mr. Smith recently told analysts that the
lower figure would be the highest they should expect for the
year.
   Mr. Smith, meanwhile, steps down as chief executive in
December. His successor, Mr. Sanders, was tapped for the job
because of his success in the diaper business, insiders say,
as well as his decision to stick with the disposable training
pants project despite heavy losses.
   Mr. Sanders saw promise in the product because consumers
had been telling Kimberly-Clark for years about their kids'
toilet training woes. Scientists began the search for
disposable pants in the early 1980s, but early models had
problems. The Omega project lacked the stretchy sides needed
for children to pull them off and on like underwear.
   An engineer who took over the diaper business in 1987, Mr.
Sanders suggested combining a stretchy fabric developed in
Georgia research labs with the Wisconsin lab's diaper making
to make a more formfitting pair of pants. The combination
worked in lab tests, so Mr. Sanders took the risky move to go
immediately to full-scale commercial production with four new
machines at the company's Paris, Texas, diaper plant.
   Another shortcut was to skip the traditional consumer test
market and rely solely on tests done with the lab product. By
cutting time in the manufacturing and marketing steps,
Kimberly-Clark got the product to market 50% faster than past
products, officials say.
   Only one other company, Unicharm of Japan, sells
disposable training pants, called Moony Trepanman, or
Training Pants Man, loosely translated. But those pants, sold
only in Japan, are stiff and don't stretch as much as
Pull-Ups. P&amp;G has yet to follow with its own training pants.
"Somebody will copy us sooner or later," says Mr. Smith, "but
by that time, we'll be pretty far up the learning curve."
   Innovation isn't limited to Pull-Ups. Kimberly-Clark
research has especially paid off in diaper market wars with
P&amp;G.
   One key Kimberly-Clark innovation in that market has been
the blend of synthetic and natural fibers that make clothlike
features that are more versatile than plain cellulose. The
company is also attentive to aesthetics. In April, for
instance, Kimberly-Clark added nursery rhymes to the
waistbands of Huggies and received 10 times its normal
testimonial letters from consumers.
   "Huggies is number one because it puts in features that
Mom notices," says Tanya Rhone, a vice president of
Weyerhaeuser Co., the largest maker of private-label diapers.
Adds Mary Kay Binder, a Cleveland mother of two boys:
"Huggies seem to be more absorbent, and they fit better."
   But the diaper market is akin to jungle warfare. The $27
billion P&amp;G, considered the world's leading marketer of
consumer goods, aggressively promotes its Pampers and Luvs
brands. And it has expanded internationally much faster,
selling its two brands in twice as many countries as
Kimberly-Clark. Moreover, P&amp;G is spending heavily to launch
an expanded line of diapers called Pampers Phases.
Kimberly-Clark will soon offer its own line of expanded sizes
Huggies Baby Steps, but it will hit store shelves a month or
more behind Phases.
   Kimberly-Clark vows to keep up the fight: "P&amp;G has deep
pockets and they can be an awesome competitor," says Mr.
Smith. "But that doesn't make us afraid."

   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Wednesday it posted
earnings of $140 million in the fourth quarter, compared with a
loss in the same period a year earlier.
   The consumer products company said its earnings translated to 82
cents per share for the quarter ended June 30 and compared with a
loss of $324 million in the year-earlier quarter.
   The prior-year loss was attributed to an after-tax restructuring
charge of $459 million. Without the charge, Procter &amp; Gamble's
fourth-quarter earnings would have risen 3.7 percent.
   The company said its fourth-quarter sales rose to $4.97 billion
from $4.17 billion.
   Procter &amp; Gamble said it benefited from increased sales overseas
and a lower tax rate.
   The Cincinnati-based company makes and sells a variety of food,
household and personal-care products, including Pampers diapers,
Tide detergent, Folger's coffee, Vicks cough medicine and Ivory
soap.
   For the full fiscal year, Procter &amp; Gamble said it earned $1.02
billion, or $5.96 per share, up more than 200 percent from $327
million, or $4.59 per share, in the previous year.
   Without the prior year charge, the company's full-year earnings
would have risen nearly 30 percent.
   Full-year sales totaled $19.34 billion, up from $17 billion.

   Leaders in the disposable diaper industry said
Wednesday that cloth competitors and consumer misunderstandings
likely accounted for recent survey results indicating strong
support for banning their product.
   ``It's not a simple issue of environment vs. paper diapers,''
said Scott Stewart, a spokesman for Procter &amp; Gamble Co.
   The roughly 16 billion disposable diapers sold every year have
become an environmental and health issue as local governments try
to deal with mountains of used, bacteria-laden dirty diapers and
rapidly filling landfills.
   Bans or taxes on disposable diapers are being considered in at
least 20 states. Nebraska, for example, has generally banned the
sale of new nondegradable diapers effective Oct. 1, 1993.
   A national Media General-Associated Press poll on environmental
concerns found that 71 percent of respondents supported a ban on
disposable diapers.
   In a recent Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll, respondents
favored a ban on disposable diapers by a 3-1 ratio. In a Gallup
Organization poll, 43 percent of respondents supported a ban, and
38 percent favored a tax.
   But Stewart said the criticism is misleading. He said disposable
diapers account for only about 1 percent of trash in the nation's
landfills.
   Furthermore, he said, cloth diapers were not necessarily
environmentally safer because they take more energy to make and
need water for cleaning.
   ``We don't get rattled about surveys because they don't tell us
anything we don't already know,'' Stewart said. ``Our competition _
the cloth diaper industry _ has been relatively successful in
painting this as an environmental problem.
   ``There's no dispute that disposables contribute to solid waste,
but it's a relatively small part, and it's unfair to say it is a
major contributor.''
   Procter &amp; Gamble says its Pampers and Luvs have about half of
the nation's $3.5 billion-a-year disposable diaper business. The
other major manufacturer is Dallas-based Kimberly-Clark Corp.,
which makes Huggies.
   Kimberly-Clark spokeswoman Jean Allen said it was unfair to
blame disposable diapers for all landfill problems. She said
consumers who used disposables simply weighed convenience against
environmental costs.
   ``If you were to ban disposable diapers and use cloth, you would
not come up with no environmental cost,'' she said. ``An individual
has to balance that cost. Water is a limited resource; there are
chemical and detergent wastes to be considered, and air pollution.
   ``This way the consumer has the right to weigh what they
consider the best alternative against the environmental cost.''
   Jack Mogavero, president of General Health Care Corp. of
Piscataway, N.J., said his company delivers nearly 2.9 million
cloth diapers a week in 14 states.
   ``I don't know anything about any poll, but I know what the
consensus of the people is, based on the number of customers we
serve weekly,'' Mogavero said by telephone. ``We've experienced
tremendous growth, and I have to attribute that to the ecology
issue.''
   Mogavero said his company processes cloth diapers for softening
and to inhibit bacteria growth.
   ``That, along with home delivery and the ecology issue, is
turning the business around,'' he said. ``I think the public is
extremely concerned with the ecology issue, not just diapers.''
   The National Association of Diaper Services estimated in October
that 750,000 households used cloth diaper services, a 38.5 percent
increase in a year.
   Some hospitals are switching to cloth after years of using
disposables.
   ``While well-intentioned, the perception that has driven that
decision is that disposables are an environmental hazard, and they
are not,'' Stewart said. Some small companies have developed
disposables they say are degradable, but neither of the big
producers have such plans. Both said actual disposal conditions
tended to limit any breakdown of a ``degradable'' diaper over time.
   ``At this time, we don't see the so-called biodegradable diaper
as a real solution,'' Ms. Allen said. ``Nothing degrades in a
landfill; to say a diaper degrades in a landfill is a marketing
claim. You can dig up a newspaper 25 years later and read it.''

In a cramped neighborhood drugstore alongside a case of murky Oriental herb 
drinks sits a stack of large plastic packages bearing a face and logo familiar 
to millions of American parents. 
</P>
<P>
"Pam-pahs," as they are called in Japan -- Pampers diapers to U.S. consumers -- 
are one of those increasingly common species in Japan: an American product that 
not only sells, but sells well. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when polls show Americans growing restive with the onslaught of 
Japanese products and money in the United States, a trend is starting in the 
other direction. 
</P>
<P>
While IBM and McDonald's are the best-known examples of American products that 
have made it in Japan, so too have Domino's Pizza (with the same 30-minute 
delivery guarantee); Schick razor blades; Oreo cookies; Kodak film; M&amp;Ms; 
Nike shoes; Levi's blue jeans; Microsoft computer software; Haagen-Dazs ice 
cream, and McIlhenney Co. Tabasco sauce, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola makes more money selling soft drinks in Japan, including its 
made-for-Japan canned coffee and Oolong tea, than in the United States, 
according to analysts here. 
</P>
<P>
Few of the companies will say it has been easy. In fact, some recently have 
chosen to bail out, deterred by the high cost of operating here and the long 
time it takes to get established. 
</P>
<P>
But even U.S. trade negotiators acknowledge that it can be done. A composite 
study of a successful foreign firm prepared by the U.S. Embassy and used in 
recent trade talks concluded that foreigners can make it here, but "government 
regulations, lack of antitrust enforcement and traditional business practices 
combined to make this an extremely difficult and costly process." 
</P>
<P>
Pampers' experience here shows what it involves. Procter &amp; Gamble Co., 
maker of the diaper, created the Japanese market for disposable diapers in 1977 
and then nearly lost it to more creative Japanese competitors a few years 
later. Now, after a costly redesign of business practices and the product 
itself, Pampers has become the single best-selling brand again. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a totally different ballgame here," said Ronald G. Pearce, president of 
Procter &amp; Gamble Far East Inc. "It has been a rough and rocky road. But 
today, after many years of hard and expensive learning, we are a factor here." 
</P>
<P>
When Pampers arrived in Japan in 1977, it was virtually the only disposable 
diaper on the market. Japanese mothers, eager to shed the mess of washing cloth 
diapers, snapped them up. Pampers dominated the market for the next several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
But the diapers were imported without modification from the United States, and 
they were not quite suited to Japanese consumer needs. Made entirely of pulp, 
they were bulky, which made them difficult to transport and then store in tiny 
Japanese apartments, and they often leaked, making them a nuisance to use at 
night or on outings. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese companies, meanwhile, did what Japanese companies have done for years 
when shown a promising new development: They modified it and made it better. 
Working to come up with a more compact and absorbent diaper more to the liking 
of Japanese mothers, Japanese companies developed super-absorbent polymers, 
basically powders that sop up liquid and turn it into a gel. Instead of ending 
up with a wet, leaky diaper after four hours of use, they made a diaper that, 
in the box, was half the size of Pampers and, on the baby, absorbed liquids, 
leaving the child dry and less prone to diaper rash. 
</P>
<P>
"They made a better mousetrap. It just revolutionized the industry, and P&amp;G 
didn't see it coming," said Joy Walbert, an analyst with Salomon Bros. in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Within months, the Japanese diaper brands -- "Moonies" and "Merries" -- had 
swept the market. By 1983, "Pampers was virtually driven out of business," 
acknowledged Pearce. The competition combined with other problems in P&amp;G's 
Japanese operation, he said, and "we actually came very close to joining the 
ranks, along with hundreds of foreign companies, who have failed to enter the 
Japanese market successfully." 
</P>
<P>
Pearce declined to discuss the finances of Procter &amp; Gamble Far East. But 
it was clear by the mid-1980s that the company needed a major revamping, and 
not only in the diaper area.

That meant better research about what Japan's quality-conscious consumers 
wanted. It also meant closer relationships with wholesalers and retailers, to 
make them feel part of the company and more loyal to the product. P&amp;G 
earlier had made inroads into Japan's complex distribution system; now it also 
began offering costly services unheard of in the United States but expected in 
Japan, such as 24-hour delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, though, it meant making a better product. In 1985, Procter 
&amp; Gamble came out with its own version of super-absorbent Pampers.

"We were so far behind, we just had to do it step by step," said Pearce. It was 
an expensive and time-consuming process of the sort that has convinced other 
foreign firms to not bother with the Japanese market. It also has produced a 
diaper that Americans living in Japan say is much softer and more compact -- 
better -- than U.S.-made Pampers. Today, according to Pearce, Pampers is the 
best-selling disposable diaper in Japan. Salomon's Walbert and other analysts 
estimate that it has about a 25% market share. P&amp;G has several other 
best-selling products here as well, including Japan's top-selling shampoo-rinse 
combination, a compact laundry detergent and, one of the hit products of the 
last year, Whisper sanitary napkins. According to Walbert, Whisper is so 
popular because P&amp;G did several years of market research, using test 
groups, and came up with a product tailored to the needs of Japanese women, 
such as having a wrapper that makes almost no noise when opened. 
</P>
<P>
The result has been that P&amp;G's Japanese sales now exceed $1 billion, and 
Japan probably will soon replace Germany as the company's largest foreign 
market. An added benefit, according to Walbert, is that P&amp;G's huge Japanese 
competitors are now so busy defending their flanks that they have little time 
to challenge P&amp;G in the United States and other markets. 
</P>
<P>
Pearce said he believes that the Japanese market is not as closed as many 
critics have suggested. A company succeeds in Japan if it is willing to adapt, 
both its product and its way of doing business, and is willing to accept that 
it takes time and money to get established here, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"From our point of view, it's different. We accepted those differences and 
found a way to break through," said Pearce. "You just can't roll out something 
here that worked in another country and expect it to sell." 
</P>
<P>
It can be a long and tiring process, he said, but "our experience has shown 
that the market was open enough for us to get in."

itself to regain ground lost to more creative Japanese competitors. The diapers 
are once again the best-selling brand in Japan -- and they demonstrate that 
American products can be successful there if they change to meet the needs of 
the marketplace. ; Photo, (A2) Making It in Japan: U.S. firms have made inroads

Marketing Deal Scrapped: Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. 
said they are canceling a marketing agreement that the Justice Department 
challenged on antitrust grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The deal would have given Cincinnati-based P&amp;G, which makes the 
Pepto-Bismol stomach remedy, exclusive rights to sell Ft. Washington, Pa.-based 
Rorer's Maalox antacid. On Aug. 7, the department said it would challenge the 
deal on grounds that it would reduce competition and raise prices in the 
stomach remedy market.

   CINCINNATI -- A Procter &amp; Gamble Co. advertisement on
composting disposable diapers has been challenged as
deceptive under New York City's consumer protection laws.
   The charges continue the battle against disposable
diapers, which have been tagged as one of the culprits in the
nation's trash problem.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   New York City's consumer affairs department says P&amp;G's
advertisement, which appeared in TV Guide, promotes the
company's Luvs and Pampers brands as easily compostable, but
few consumers actually have access to such composting
facilities.
   The ad shows a pile of soil-like material that was once a
disposable diaper before the 90-day process began. The ad
states that nearly 80% of the diaper is compostable. The
process needed to break down the disposable diapers is called
"accelerated composting," which speeds up the natural
degrading of materials. To date, 10 communities are
composting their trash, according to the ad.
   In a letter to P&amp;G, the consumer affairs department
requested that the company meet with it March 22 to discuss
the violations and, presumably, to negotiate suspension of
the advertising. The letter didn't specify what actions the
department could take. Under, New York law, the department
could fine and seek an end to the ad campaign.
   In Cincinnati, a P&amp;G spokeswoman said the company
disagrees with the allegations and doesn't believe the ad is
misleading. The ad "is intended to help educate consumers
about the potential promise" of municipal composting and to
encourage its development, the spokeswoman said.
   P&amp;G, which controls about 50% of the U.S. disposable
diaper market, has been testing new diaper materials and
disposal methods for soiled diapers. Last year, P&amp;G said it
would spend $20 million to help develop municipal composting
projects around the world.
