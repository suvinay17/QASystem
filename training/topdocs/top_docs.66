   Prehistoric caves in France and Spain. Rome's
Coliseum or Athens' Acropolis. Egypt's mystic pyramids. It's hard to
imagine the Mediterranean world without its most famous landmarks.
   But the area's monuments face an uncertain future as they become
caught up in a push toward lucrative mass tourism that could
endanger them.
   Indicative of the dilemma facing the region's planners is the
view of Sayed Moussa, Egypt's head of tourism promotion, who
acknowledges that history and the tourist dollar can be at odds.
   ``Antiquities officials are so jealous of their rocks,'' he said.
``We have commercial interests to consider.''
   From another point of view, antiquities officials throughout the
area decry the uproar caused when saving monuments requires
difficult decisions affecting tourists.
   ``We in Egypt are constantly reminded that our monuments belong
not only to Egypt but to the world,'' said Mut'awie Balboush, head
of antiquities for Upper Egypt, where 23 restoration teams are
working to save failing structures.
   As a region, the Mediterranean Basin is the world's biggest
tourist attraction. Host to more than a third of all international
travelers, the region's 18 countries this year alone welcomed well
over 110 million visitors, 80 percent of them in Spain, Italy and
France. If experts are correct, 450 million to 700 million annual
visitors will head to the Med by 2025.
   Tourism is not new to the Mediterranean. Egypt and the rest of
the Middle East already were ancient when history buffs Alexander
the Great, Julius Caesar and Napoleon Bonaparte took time out from
conquest to go sightseeing.
   In most countries revenue from tourism is set aside at least
partly for saving antiquities.
   But transporting tourists pours exhaust fumes into the air.
Tourists stir up dust with their footsteps, touch fragile wall
paintings with sweaty hands or mar them with graffiti. Many ascend
shaky monuments like mountain goats for just the right photo.
   Even by breathing, tourists damage some monuments.
   Throughout the region, a staggering growth in tourism has
prompted self-defense decisions by antiquities officials.
   _In Spain, visited by 50 million tourists in 1988, officials a
decade ago closed the Altamira Caves with their 12,000-year-old wall
paintings of bison and horses. The images had been damaged seriously
by a sharp rise in humidity and temperature generated by 1,000
visitors a day. In 1982, the main cave was reopened but access
limited to no more than 30 tourists a day. A replica will be opened
to all comers in 1990.
   _In France, officials faced the same dilemma and closed the
Lescaux Caves near Montignac in 1963, a year after 100,000 visitors
surged into the cave network. A facsimile opened in 1983 draws
350,000 visitors annually, and officials have developed
tourist-control techniques for other caves in the Dordogne region,
trying to preserve paintings while allowing visits.
   _In Greece, tourism authorities say visitors have caused no major
damage but archaeologists counter that 30,000 feet trampling on the
Acropolis' floor each summer's day can be doing no good. In 1978,
the Parthenon, the fifth-century architectural glory of Athens'
Golden Age, was roped off to the public after years of being worn
and chipped away by visitors' heels.
   _In Italy, support scaffolding and a ban on traffic in Rome's
historic center have been tried to reduce monument deterioration
from acid rain, car exhausts and traffic vibrations. At least 10
percent of Italy's more than 50 million annual tourists go to Rome,
crowding such monuments as the Forum and Coliseum. Trevi Fountain
soon is going behind a clear plastic screen to accommodate tourists
during a year-long restoration. Restorer Giorgio Toracca said the
only way to stop deterioration of Rome's monuments would be to put
them under glass, ``but glass cages would change the entire view.''
   _In Egypt, a glass tunnel has been inserted into a 3,300-year-old
noble's tomb that tourists and time had damaged. The World Bank
financed the Swedish experiment as a possible solution to the
emergency facing many of the tombs of the West Bank cemetery of
pharaohs, queens, royal children and courtiers. The pilot project
has remained closed to tourists, however, as antiquities officials
debate its pros and cons, including whether the fragile tomb's
allure remains the same to people peering through glass.
   Of the Mediterranean countries, Egypt, said to house more than
half of the world's standing monuments, has suffered the most with
the crunch of time: burgeoning population, subterranean water,
pollution and salt attacking historic remains.

TRAVEL VIDEOS: A COUPLE OF WAYS OF VIEWING 'THE ETERNAL CITY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rome is filled with countless historic, artistic and architectural treasures 
that support its claim to the title, "The Eternal City." 
</P>
<P>
It's also a city of elegant shops, outdoor markets, museums, cappuccino bars, 
trattorias, gelaterias, sidewalk cafes and monumental traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
In two diverse Rome videos, each of which is less than an hour and reviewed 
below, the producers capture its essence very well. 
</P>
<P>
"Rome" (International Video Network, Video Visits, 55 minutes. 1989). 
</P>
<P>
Most of the historic attractions in this mosaic are at the numerous piazzas 
that dot the city. At the piazzas, Romans are usually surrounded by tourists 
attracted by the classical palazzos, churches, monuments and fountains. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the many popular places are the Piazza del Popolo, with its huge 
Egyptian obelisk; the Piazza di Spagna with the Spanish Steps and the piazzas 
Barberini, Navona and Trevi, with their wondrous fountains. 
</P>
<P>
Other stops include the Palazzo dei Conservatori (city of hall) on Capitoline 
Hill, where viewers are guests at a wedding, and the impressive Pantheon, the 
oldest and best preserved of Rome's ancient buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In the shadow of Capitoline Hill is the ancient Forum, where scenes include the 
Colosseum, the site of the Circus Maximus and the ruins of Palatine Hill, where 
Rome was founded. A side trip follows the Appian Way to the historic catacombs. 
</P>
<P>
The video also makes visits to the beautiful Borehese Gardens, lake and art 
gallery; the Mouth of Truth sculpture, which is said to bite the hand of a liar 
who puts his hand in it; the island of Tiberina, and the old Left Bank 
Trastevere district, with the lovely 3rd-Century Church of St. Cecilia. 
</P>
<P>
The segment on Vatican City includes the Ponte Vittoria Emanuele (bridge), 
Castel Sant-Angelo and St. Peter's for scenes of the Pope, the Vatican Gardens 
and museums and the Sistine Chapel dominated by Michelangelo's monumental 
ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
Other churches to see include the basilica of St. John Lateran, St. Peter in 
Chains and St. Paul's Outside the Walls. 
</P>
<P>
The video concludes with scenes of Rome at night, the Via Veneto at sunset and 
lighted views of fountains. 
</P>
<P>
Although it holds no surprises, this is a well-photographed and well-narrated 
traditional travelogue that will appeal mainly to the armchair traveler. 
</P>
<P>
It offers no tips or travel recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
A tape is available from International Video Network, Video Visits, 2242 Camino 
Ramon, San Ramon, Calif. 94583, (415) 866-1121. Price: $24.95. 
</P>
<P>
"Rome" (VPI/AC Video, produced by Robin Williams, 50 minutes, 1988). Travel 
film maker Williams' video focuses on the cultural attractions found in Rome, 
concentrating on classical art, architecture and ancient history. It should 
have a special appeal for armchair travelers, and if used in conjunction with 
the above "Rome" video, should enrich the trip of a vacationer. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' interest in the piazzas of Rome centers on the fountains created by 
such artists as Giovanni Lorenzo Bernini and on the history and architectural 
significance of the surrounding churches and palazzos. 
</P>
<P>
A few that he examines include the charming Tortoise Fountain in tiny Piazza 
Mattei; the Boat Fountain and the Spanish Steps in the Piazza di Spagna; the 
Triton Fountain in the Piazza Barberini, and the impressive Fountain of the 
Four Rivers, the Moor and the Neptune in the Piazza Navona. Others are the 
Fountain of Trevi and the elegant churches of the Piazza Quirinale. 
</P>
<P>
On an extensive tour of the Vatican, Williams describes the design of St. 
Peter's Square and basilica and singles out the famous "Pieta" by Michelangelo 
and "The Throne of St. Peter's" by Bernini, for special attention. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight is a visit to the Sistine Chapel and its ceiling for close 
studies and a history of Michelangelo's magnificent work. Also studied is 
Raphael's "School of Athens," as well as many of his other paintings in the 
Papal quarters. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican visit concludes with a history and film on the Swiss Guard and a 
tour of the Vatican Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
A segment of interest follows the journey of St. Paul from the time he landed 
in Italy through his trial, death and burial, including scenes of the Appian 
Way, the Forum (with drawings as it looked then) and the Basilica of St. Paul's 
Outside the Walls where he is buried. 
</P>
<P>
The video and narration also describe the founding of Rome, the building of the 
Colosseum and give a detailed examination of the Forum and its ruins, including 
the Arch of Septimus Severus that Napoleon used as a model for the Arc de 
Triomphe in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Other ancient sites include the Palatine Hill, the Circus Maximus and the 
Trajan Markets and column. 
</P>
<P>
Two pleasant side trips visit the tower of Tivoli with the Villa d'Este and its 
beautiful gardens and fountains and to the lakeside summer retreats of Nemi and 
Albano in the Alban Hills. 
</P>
<P>
It seems as if Williams' video was filmed by two cameras. The scenic shots are 
often fuzzy, but the artworks are good and the musical score is effective. It 
will be helpful to those interested in an aesthetic view of Rome. 
</P>
<P>
No tips or travel recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
A tape is available from VPI/AC, 381 Park Ave. South, New York 10016, (212)

FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (17): It's not as much fun as it should be -
Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMBASSIES in Rome and their consular posts throughout the country are now
gearing up for the busy season. July and August will produce a sharp
increase in the number of 'distressed citizens' whose Italian holidays have
been spoiled by the theft of passports, tickets, money and belongings.
Unwary tourists are easy prey for the pickpockets, bag snatchers, muggers
and other delinquents who plague the large cities. The notoriety of the
route 64 buses from the capital's Termini railway station to St Peter's is
such that the transport authority has posted signs to warn travellers to be
on their guard. Rome's 'A' underground line is another high risk route.
Travelling under one's own steam does not, however, guarantee a trouble-free
trip. Owners of cars with foreign plates often become neurotic in Italy, a
condition that lifts only when safely across the border and heading home.
The car break-in - often by smashing a window  - is an inconvenience that
many foreign visitors have suffered.
But the tourist is not only an easy victim for petty criminals. The
traveller in Italy is a soft target for legitimate businesses like hotels,
restaurants and taxis. Over recent years tourists have learnt that Italy has
become a high cost destination.
Figures from the Bank of Italy reveal a significant drop in the
competitiveness of tourist services. For foreign tourists, the index of
Italian competitiveness fell steadily during the 1980s, and was about 20 per
cent lower last year than in 1982. During the mid and late-1980s the
situation was even worse for Italian tourists with the competitiveness of
home destinations declining by about 30 points, though there was an
improvement between 1989 and 1990.
Higher prices and tariff increases this year seem likely to weaken Italy's
competitive position even more. The setting of hotel room-rates was freed
from official control last year, and this has led to rises of more than 10
per cent on 1991's rates.
It is argued that Italy has a unique cultural and historic heritage, thus
enjoying a monopoly position that gives the tourist business considerable
licence in pricing. Visitors to Venice, Florence and, to a lesser extent,
Rome, experience this in hotel rates and restaurant bills that are generally
high and sometimes exorbitant.
How much more can the tourist be squeezed? Probably not much. Venice and
Florence are increasingly destinations for day-trippers who stay in cheaper
accommodation away from the cities and then travel in by car, coach or
train.
But this mass movement of tourists has made the experience of visiting these
historic cities less agreeable for those who pay high prices to stay in
them. The fact that crowds are a problem has been highlighted by proposals
to limit access to both Venice and Florence.
If visitors to Italy's centres of art and culture return home with a sense
of disappointment from an experience that has not lived up to expectations,
there are several factors to blame.
It is not only the high cost. Tourists often have an overall impression that
Italy is not really organised for them. The absence of public conveniences
near major attractions is one shortcoming. Another is the inadequacy of
reliable information. Fortunately, individual Italians display considerable
warmth, hospitality and readiness to assist visitors that helps to
compensate for structural and institutional weaknesses.
But such kindnesses do not always make up for the closed doors that
frequently confront expectant visitors to museums and galleries. A recent
report by Touring Club Italiano says that nearly one half of Italy's museums
are closed.
The report also notes that more than 300,000 works of art and 18,000
archaeological pieces have been stolen from museums, churches and
collections in the past 20 years. That this sacking of Italy's artistic
fabric has not caused a furore says much about public and political
indifference to the country's heritage. Maintaining this, Italy's unique
tourist attraction, does not seem to rank high in the country's priorities.
Last month's report that Rome's Colosseum was in danger of collapsing, an
eventuality that should be kept at bay by financial help from Banca di Roma,
led to revelations of a nationwide situation that is far from encouraging.
That Venice is in peril has been widely known for years. In the surrounding
Veneto region most of the historic villas need urgent attention. Further
south the problems of Pisa's leaning tower are just a symbol of a much wider
damage and decay that also affects the walls Lucca, Urbino and Pesaro, the
towers in San Gimignano, Etruscan tombs in Tarquinia, Apulia's baroque
masterpieces, baroque and Grecian treasures in Sicily and many other items
in the heritage inventory.
Indifferent to its artistic heritage, Italy also seems to care little for
its wildlife and scenic resources. Few ornithologists would choose Italy for
a holiday. Indiscriminate hunting, ineffectually opposed by the authorities,
has radically cut the numbers of many protected species.
Legislation was approved at the end of last year for the establishment of
protected areas, but implementation programmes remain paper projects.
Unrestrained development has ruined beautiful stretches of coastline,
particularly in the south.
What about the beaches? The comments from Touring Club Italiano are not
reassuring. Last year Italian resorts won 55 European 'blue flags' for
cleanliness, safety and overall service. Only 29 beaches are flying the flag
this summer.
Nevertheless, seaside resorts may enjoy higher numbers of visitors, both
Italian and foreign. The Yugoslav civil war is diverting tourist trade to
the benefit of Italy's Adriatic coast. This ought to give a welcome boost to
the invisible trade account. Revenues turned down last year for the first
time since 1986. But an even steeper fall in Italian travellers' spending
abroad allowed the account to close with a larger surplus than in 1990,
thereby halted a declining sequence that started in 1986.
Are Italy's authorities becoming interested in tourism? A television
campaign this summer is encouraging Italians to welcome tourists by being
less noisy, less aggressive on the roads and by not littering the cities
with refuse. Perhaps a much-needed clean-up will get under way, for there is
plenty to do.

FT  30 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Italy's tourist image loses shine - This
year's summer season was one of the worst
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recent sharp fall in the value of the lira should make Italy more
attractive to foreigners after one of the worst summer seasons on record.
But the country's travel agents warn the problems go well beyond an
overvalued currency.
Tourism is Italy's third biggest source of foreign income after machinery
and textiles and clothing. This summer's disappointing tourist receipts
could hardly have come at a worse time for an economy fighting off recession
and a severe deterioration in the balance of payments.
Earnings from foreigners help to compensate for the huge imports of energy
and raw materials needed to run the Italian economy, which is relatively
poor in natural resources. So the fall in tourist numbers has worsened a
steady deterioration in the balance of payments this year as a result of
declining export earnings caused by recession in many major markets.
In August, the latest month for which figures are available, the balance of
payments registered a deficit of L4,505bn, (Pounds 2.03bn), up from L906bn a
year earlier. The deficit for the first eight months of this year surged to
L29,064bn, against a surplus of L3,779bn in the same period in 1991.
Italy's foreign exchange reserves have fallen heavily as a result of lower
receipts and a costly campaign to defend the lira before its devaluation in
September.
Early data from Emilia Romagna, Italy's leading seaside resort region,
suggest visitors in the peak May-September holiday period fell by 8 per
cent. The overall drop hides a much sharper fall of at least 15 per cent in
visits by foreigners, who in 1991 made up 18 per cent of the region's 4.2m
visitors. Hopes that Italy's tourism industry might benefit from the switch
away from Yugoslavia because of the fighting there have proved ill-founded.
The fall in visitors is as marked in Florence, Venice and Rome as on the
Riviera. The Confcrescenti tourism organisation said the numbers visiting
Rome plunged by 30 per cent in the first two weeks of August, the peak
period, against the same period last year. Early returns for Venice suggest
a drop of 15 per cent.
Relatively high inflation, combined with limited scope for depreciation when
the lira was still in the exchange rate mechanism, lay at the heart of
Italy's pricing problem. As the country became more expensive for
foreigners, so local hotels and restaurants steadily lost ground against
Germany, Austria or Switzerland. Italy's hoteliers and travel agents blame
the overvalued lira as the main cause of this year's decline, but other
factors played a part. Recession in Germany, the main source of Italy's
tourists, was partly responsible. Popular German destinations such as Lake
Garda experienced uncommonly high vacancy rates.
Foreign perceptions of widespread crime in Italy have not helped. Tales of
stolen wallets abound, while Mafia murders and disclosures of corruption in
many cities have fuelled a general impression of lawlessness. Earlier this
month, Fiavet, Italy's travel agents' association, published a report
listing poor service, ageing hotels, bad manners and high prices as top
disincentives for foreigners visiting Italy.
Tourists complain about museums which are closed, or only open for limited
hours. A recent wave of public-sector strikes has not helped. Many visitors
object to paying stiff entrance fees to find half a famous venue off limits.
The lira's devaluation, now running at around 12 per cent against the
D-Mark, will mollify such feelings, but dealing with the problems which have
damaged Italy's image as a tourist paradise will take longer.

<TEXT>
   If you want to wait in line to climb the Statue of Liberty or the Washington Monument, go ahead. 
But take a minute to consider visiting some tourist spots off the beaten track. 
Way off. 

   How about the Barbed Wire Museum in La Crosse, Kan., where you can see a 72-pound bird's nest that crows built almost exclusively of barbed wire? 
Or the Boll Weevil Monument in Enterprise, Ala., which proclaims itself, "The Only Monument in the World Glorifying a Pest!"? 
How about the Barbie Doll Hall of Fame in Palo Alto, Calif.? 

   In "Weird Wonderful America: The Nation's Most Offbeat and Off-the-Beaten-Path Tourist Attractions" (Macmillan, 265 pages, $8.95), Laura A. Bergheim provides descriptions of some 200 eccentric museums, shrines and natural wonders that most of us would never happen on without her help. 

   Ms. Bergheim's excellent guidebook is laid out as if in emulation of the tourist attractions she celebrates, with junk and gems all tossed together. 
There is a semblance of organization -- entries are grouped geographically and alphabetically -- but there is no telling what surprise lurks around the next page. 
The Voodoo Museum is followed by the Checkers Hall of Fame; the National Atomic Museum, with such grim artifacts as the "Fat Boy" and "Little Man" bombs, shares a page with the Smokey Bear Museum; the Wilhelm Reich Museum and the Babe Ruth Museum confront each other across successive pages. 

   The danger here, which Ms. Bergheim avoids, is being self-consciously cute. 
Instead, she is boundlessly curious, funny but not sarcastic, and protective of her finds. 
Her credo becomes clear in her description of North Carolina's tiny Belhaven Museum, where the exhibits range from a dress that belonged to a 700-pound-woman to eyeglasses for a horse to a 100-million-year-old walrus tusk. 
"If a thing exists, then its very existence gives credence to its worth: this is the lesson of Eva Way's museum," Ms. Bergheim writes. 
"If all of life itself were crammed into one little room, it might look a lot like this." 

   The Michelin guidebooks reserve their highest praise for tourist lures that are "worth a trip." 
Few of Ms. Bergheim's sites qualify, though many rate a detour. 
If I ever find myself near Athens, Ga., for example, I will make a point of checking out two of Ms. Bergheim's finds. 

   First, I'll go to see The Tree That Owns Itself, an oak at the corner of Dearing and Finley streets. 
One W.H. Jackson was so fond of the tree, local legend has it, that he willed it "entire possession of itself and of the land within eight feet of it on all sides." 

   Then it's off to the Athens City Hall to inspect an invention that the city itself proclaims, "One of Athens' most cherished memorabilia . . . a totally unique failure." 
This glorious blunder was a double-barreled cannon built during the Civil War, designed to fire two cannonballs at once. 
An eight-foot-chain between the cannonballs was intended to flatten the enemy. 
The one time the cannon was fired, the chain snapped and one cannonball "killed a cow in a distant field, while the other knocked down the chimney from a log cabin." 

   The museums and shrines tend to describe themselves in superlatives, though some of the boasting is not as impressive as was intended. 
A Bristol, Tenn., museum, for instance, bills itself as the "World's Only Guitar-Shaped Music Museum." 
Fort Sumner, N.M., calls itself the "International Billy the Kid Capital." 
Lucas, Kan., brags that its collection of concrete statues of Biblical figures is "the only place in the world where you can see the Garden of Eden and buy Brant's bologna." 

   Some of Ms. Bergheim's finds seem too quirky to be captured in a brief summary. 
"If you're into circuses, condensed milk, train wrecks, or salt and pepper shakers, this small museum is for you," she writes gamely, trying to describe Brewster, N.Y.'s Southeast Museum. 

   On the other hand, if the prospect of such variety makes you dizzy, consider going to Johnson City, Tenn., to see The Museum of Ancient Brick. 
See bricks from Egypt, from Babylon, from Jericho, inside a giant (you guessed it) brick building. 

   Many of the museums were founded by enthusiasts whose collecting zeal started off as single-minded and skidded right off the road into full-fledged obsession. 
The World O' Tools Museum has an exhibit of 1,500 adjustable wrenches. 
There is a Museum of Beverage Containers, a Cookie Jar Museum, a Paperweight Museum. 

   The weirdest tourist site of all? 
No contest -- it's the Cypress Knee Museum in Palmdale, Fla. (Look for the unpunctuated and unmistakable highway sign, "LADY IF HE WON'T STOP HIT HIM ON THE HEAD WITH A SHOE.") 

   Cypress knees are strange bits of wood that "grow around cypress trees like upwardly mobile mutant roots." 
They take on fanciful shapes ("Hippo wearing a Carmen Miranda hat"), and they are, a sign at the museum entrance proclaims, "Souvenirs of a Time Before Civilization Covered the United States."

FT  12 NOV 92 / Survey of Jordan (9): Culture worth more than camels - The
untapped tourist potential presents a delicate problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WADI RUM, the place where TE Lawrence and the Arab rebels he was riding with
in 1917 were stunned into silence by the 'stupendous' surroundings, must
rank among the world's most impressive desert landscapes.
Yet over a period of four hours on a late October day, when the worst of the
broiling summer heat has faded, not many more than 50 visitors arrived at
the little Bedouin settlement and picturesque 'Beau Geste' police post which
serve as the departure point for journeys by camel or four-wheel drive
vehicles into the sandy-floored Wadi.
More come by bus in the late afternoon to watch the sun set over the great
brown fractured cliffsides towering over either side of the valley. But the
Wadi - about 50km as the crow flies north east of the Red Sea port of Aqaba
 -remains remarkably little tainted by the tramp of tourist masses.
So it is at most of Jordan's rich tourist attractions. At the most famous of
all, the extraordinary rock-cut Nabataean city of Petra, south east of the
Dead Sea, visitor accommodation is still limited to just 400 beds. On the
Dead Sea itself, where the minerals in the water and the atmospheric
conditions provide relief for many skin and other ailments, there is only
one hotel.
Elsewhere, from the beautifully preserved Roman city of Jerash, north of
Amman, to evocative crusader castles such as Kerak, the story is the same:
few tourist facilities, and relatively few tourists.
The government in Amman is well aware of the untapped tourist potential in
the country. It is working to develop the local industry, worried about
being left behind by its neighbours, Egypt, Israel and even the well-oiled
Palestinian tour operators in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem and the West
Bank.
But the authorities are faced with a delicate task. Much of the attraction
of Jordan lies in the unspoilt nature of its sites. To increase volume too
much and too fast could easily be to kill the goose that laid the golden
egg.
This year, tourists have returned to Jordan in large numbers following the
1991 slump induced by the Gulf war - as they have done throughout the east
Mediterranean area. Officials say the volume will match the 1989 peak of
380,000 visitors, reaffirming tourism's place as the country's
second-biggest earning industry. Gross earnings of some Dollars 500m in 1989
accounted for 17 per cent of gross national product.
But Mr Yanal Hikmat, the minister of tourism, says he is anxious to avoid
expanding into the mass market. 'I have always wanted to raise Jordan above
the level of the belly dancers and camel caravans to a more cultural and
educational type of tourism. I think we would be satisfied with 1m visitors
a year by the year 2000, well catered for and well serviced.'
His senior official in the ministry, Mr Nasri Attallah, echoes this. 'Our
success lies in simplicity. Our sites are untouched, they have mystery, they
are uncrowded. Local people still mix with tourists. We very much want to
preserve that.'
Certainly, visitors have up to now benefited from the relative lack of
crowds - and welcome features such as fixed prices for horse and camel rides
at Petra and Wadi Rum that contrast with the chaotic rip-offs endemic to the
tourist industry in Egypt.
But the best intentions may be swept away by fast-growing demand and the
need to keep up with neighbouring competitors. This will be particularly
true if Middle East peace negotiations eventually yield open borders for
tourists. The prospect of Jordan becoming little more than a day trip for
visitors from Israel, Palestine and even Egypt is real and worrying.
Petra, for example, would be easily accessible to day trips from the Israeli
Red Sea resort of Eilat and the neighbouring Egyptian resort of Taba. Both
at present have hotel facilities far more sophisticated than Jordan's Aqaba,
also on the same strip of coast.
'I want to make sure these people stay in Jordan at least two nights and do
not just pass by in one day,' says Mr Hikmat. His overall intention is to
extend the average stay in Jordan beyond the present five to six nights.
To achieve that, Jordan must have the accommodation to compete. So it is
looking to the private sector to invest, providing incentives such as easy
terms for land acquisition and duty free imports. Two new privately-built
hotels will open in Petra next year, doubling local bed capacity. (A further
doubling is planned by 1995.)
But this quickly raises the tricky question of preserving the remoteness of
such sites - which gives them so much of their cachet now. Already the
authorities are considering whether to limit passage into Petra through the
famed 'siq', or narrow defile, to entry only, leading visitors out by an
alternative route.
As Mr Attallah says, Jordan's problem is to expand tourism while wearing
'kid gloves'.

   Startled tourists watched as a man scaled a barrier
and scooped up coins from the city's famed Trevi fountain until
police arrested him, authorities say.
   According to legend, tourists who throw coins over their
shoulders into the 18th century fountain will return to Rome.
   On Sunday afternoon, 41-year-old Franco Fascelli entered the
fountain, which is without water due to restoration work, police
said Monday.
   ``It really makes no difference who throws the coins into the
fountain. People who really want to return will come back anyway,''
Fascelli said as he was taken into custody, according to the Rome
newspaper Il Messaggero.

  [Text] Hangzhou, March 2 (XINHUA) -- Hangzhou, one of 
China's tourist meccas, in Zhejiang Province, is striving to 
improve its facilities and attract more tourists this year. 
  An official in charge of tourism said that the city will 
speed up the transformation of the old urban districts, 
introduce international conventions and add more cultural 
attractions this year. 
  Famous for its picturesque Western Lake, Hangzhou received 
199,800 overseas tourists last year, an increase of 8.7 percent 
over the previous year. 
  The proportion of foreign tourists rose from 37.54 percent 
of 
the total number of tourists in 1992 to 43.46 percent last year. 
  With a history of 2,100 years, Hangzhou has 49 sq [square]

WAXING ENTHUSIASTIC OVER TUSSAUD'S ROCK 'N' ROLL CIRCUS; 
</P>
<P>
NOSTALGIA: OPENED LESS THAN A YEAR AGO IN LONDON, THE ROCK MUSEUM FEATURES 
ROBOTIC FIGURES OF ROCK STARS SCULPTED IN WAX. EACH EXHIBIT IS ACCOMPANIED BY 
MUSIC AND COMMENT.

<P>
A wax replica of Johnny Rotten is poised in a glass booth, hands gripping the 
silver stem of a microphone, its face twisted and contorted with a bit of 
spittle evident on the teeth. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at Johnny Rotten," says a voice from overhead. "Look at him sneer at you. 
Look at him tell you your life is built on hypocrisy and lies." The unseen 
narrator reels off some facts about Rotten and his fellow Sex Pistols. 
</P>
<P>
"Just look at him," the voice sneers, finally. "He doesn't like you at all." 
</P>
<P>
Ouch. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing in the Rock Circus prepares visitors for the sting of learning that 
Rotten never liked them. But at least that is the only painful moment during a 
tour of the combination wax museum-robotics show-Rock Hall of Fame. That is, 
unless you consider it painful to watch a Bob Dylan robot in Ray-Bans strumming 
its way through "The Times They Are A-Changin'." 
</P>
<P>
Created by the Tussaud's Group, the same company behind Mme. Tussaud's 
Waxworks, Rock Circus features dozens of sculpted rock stars. Each figure is 
accompanied by a snatch of music and a dash of narrated comment. 
</P>
<P>
On an upper floor of the exhibit is a staged "animatronic" show that offers a 
Disneyesque view of rock history. Picture a Janis Joplin robot sitting on a 
park bench talking about the Summer of Love, singing "Me and Bobby McGee" and 
introducing a David Bowie robot. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of it certainly sounds kitschy. When credible musicians are displayed 
in such an overtly touristy way, one expects the result to be disappointing. 
Waxing nostalgic about rock 'n' roll is one thing. Turning rock 'n' roll 
nostalgia into wax is something else. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Rock Circus generally manages to stay interesting, if not compelling. 
The craftsmanship of the wax figures is extraordinary. And although the 
commentary accompanying each display will not enlighten anyone with a basic 
knowledge of pop history, it can be surprisingly acerbic for a tourist haunt. 
</P>
<P>
Opened less than a year ago in the historic London Pavillion at Piccadilly 
Circus, the $18-million rock 'n' roll display is probably the most grandiose 
tourist attraction ever devoted exclusively to pop music. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't without careful research that The Tussaud's Group decided there was a 
market for wax figures of Jimi Hendrix, Aretha Franklin and Robert Plant. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which also draws visitors to its castle and amusement park, was 
looking for a new venture in the early 1980s. "Like all good businessmen, we 
decided to ask the public what interested them," says Martin King, general 
manager of Rock Circus. 
</P>
<P>
The company organized focus groups of Britons and foreigners -- Americans, 
Scandinavians, French, Australians and Germans -- and tossed ideas at them. The 
three main concepts Tussaud's was considering were an historical exhibit about 
London, the lives of the contemporary rich and famous and something they called 
"The Pop Experience." 
</P>
<P>
What the Tussaud's researchers discovered was unequivocal, says King. "The 
impression is that people come to England to learn about the kings and queens," 
he says. "But what we found is that they much preferred to see Elvis the King, 
and Freddy Mercury of Queen." 
</P>
<P>
The company is renowned for its wax figures, so the machinery already was in 
place to create a gallery of stationary rockers. But creating the "audio 
animatronic" figures -- the rock robots -- was daunting. 
</P>
<P>
Deciding which stars should be represented in the Rock Circus was left to King, 
Tussaud's executive Ian Hanson and rock writer Paul Gambaccini. "It's the 
ultimate party game," says King. He said the first 85% of the choices were 
obvious and easy. "The real areas of dispute were the final 15%." 
</P>
<P>
Rock enthusiasts will inevitably quibble at some of the choices. Americans may 
be baffled by the inclusion of Lonnie Donegan, the '50s British skiffle star 
who hit briefly in the United States with "Rock Island Line" and "Does Your 
Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavor (on the Bedpost Overnight)?" 
</P>
<P>
And many people will be surprised to find there is not even a wax figure, let 
alone a robot, of Jim Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the gamble to invest heavily in a rock 'n' roll attraction appears to 
be paying off. King estimates that up to 750,000 rock fans will see the exhibit 
this year -- a reasonably good showing by local standards. By comparison, 
Madame Tussaud's, the most popular tourist attraction in Great Britain, draws 
2.7 million visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
The Rock Circus has no trouble attracting attention to itself; figures of Jimi 
Hendrix, Buddy Holly and Elton John stand outside on the balcony facing 
Piccadilly Circus, looking down on the pedestrians like royalty. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, visitors are first sent over to have their picture taken with a 
sculpted David Bowie. "There's no obligation" to buy the photograph later, an 
employee repeats for each new arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone gets a headset, which is keyed by electronic doodads overhead to 
provide the appropriate narration and music for each exhibit. Then on to the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
In the main room, a rotating, circular stage shows a very '70s Elton John 
performing "Bennie and the Jets," Little Richard singing "Tutti Frutti" and 
Stevie Wonder with "I Just Called to Say I Love You." All of a sudden -- boom! 
-- Elvis Presly pops up from the center and sings "Glory Hallelujah." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the stars immortalized in wax posed for the Tussaud sculptors and 
donated personal items to make their display more realistic. 
</P>
<P>
Tussaud's sculptor Stuart Williamson was one of the artists involved in 
capturing Eric Clapton. The guitarist came to the Tussaud studio several times 
to pose with his guitar. At one point he played an old blues number for the 
artists. "It was like a private concert for us," says an appreciative 
Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
The sculptor went to Los Angeles to do Little Richard and to Frankfurt to get 
Sting, who was on tour. Johnny Rotten came into the Tussaud's studio several 
times and allowed the artists to make a cast of his rotten teeth. 
</P>
<P>
After a tour through the wax figures, visitors are sent to the grand finale, 
the robot show. The performance begins and ends with the theme from "Sergeant 
Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band," with Beatles replicas standing onstage 
looking like they were peeled from that album's cover. 
</P>
<P>
In between Beatle numbers, a Madonna robot sings "Like a Virgin," Bruce 
Springsteen does "Born in the U.S.A." and Bob Dylan plays "The Times They Are 
A-Changin'." 
</P>
<P>
The performance begs a question: Does the existence of a guitar-strumming Bob 
Dylan robot as a centerpiece to a multimillion dollar tourist attraction say 
something good, or something bad, about the evolution of rock 'n' roll? 
</P>
<P>
The show ends and the Rock Circus visitors are sent into a gift shop where they 
find pictures of themselves with David Bowie. 
</P>
<P>
There's no obligation to buy one, but most of them do. 
</P>

   Lanny Bell, director of Chicago House, a special arm of the
University of Chicago's Oriental Institute, has wrestled for 11
years with how to save decaying monuments in southern Egypt's Luxor
area, the greatest concentration of monuments on earth.
   Using photography and hand drawings, Chicago House is recording
some of Egypt's best-known monuments before they disappear.
   ``In many respects the modern Egyptians live in a huge outdoor
museum, and museums are to be visited,'' Bell said. ``The question
remains one of finding the best way to display an artifact, even an
artifact as large as a temple, to best advantage.''
   Most Egyptian monuments were built as places of worship with
restricted entry. Bell said the dilemma for antiquities officials is
keeping monuments in their natural settings while insulating them
against tourist hordes.
   ``Tourism is both necessary and desirable,'' he said. ``But if
the present rate of decay continues, as it has for 100 years, there
will be no need for tourists 200 years from now to visit Luxor for
its monuments.''
   Zahi Hawass, who controls Giza Plateau, Egypt's best-known
tourist area, is trying to make it safer both for tourists and its
monuments, the Giza pyramids and the Sphinx. He hopes television
monitors being installed inside the pyramids can stop tourist antics
that began 1,100 years ago when treasure hunters forced their way
into Cheops Pyramid.
   ``For the past 100 years this place has been a zoo, and for the
past 50 years antiquities authorities have had no plans to protect
the monuments from tourists,'' Hawass said. ``Our biggest problem in
Egypt is we have no concept that a monument should be a national
park, where people come to enjoy but behave.''
   Tourism has become Egypt's second largest earner of foreign
currency, with almost 2 million visitors in 1988 spending more than
$2 billion. The Tourism Promotion Board's Moussa wants to double the
number within a few years.
   Moussa said officials recognize the appeal of Egypt's monuments
but must look beyond history to encourage mass tourism.
   ``If you're thinking of coming to Egypt only for its monuments,
you can always put it off, because the monuments will still be
here,'' he said.
   ``Our best bet to help both tourism and monuments is to provide a
number of alternative sites throughout the country, drawing tourists
away from congested monuments. We also can help find ways to stem
the tourist flow into popular sites.''
   Tourism officials and the World Bank have devised a plan they say
will ease congestion in the temples and tombs on Luxor's West Bank.
It includes new roads and a visitors' center that will control
visits to the main attractions by computer.
   Two of the most famous tombs in the Valley of the Kings _ Seti I
and Tutankhamun _ are endangered but remain open to the public.
   A year ago the frail tomb of Seti I was reopened after
restoration. A few weeks later, a zodiac design painted on its
ceiling, unique among Egyptian monuments, came crashing to the floor.
   Workers are restoring the zodiac behind a rope barrier, because
``every time we close Seti, we get objections from tourist
agencies,'' said Upper Egyptian antiquities director Balboush.
   In King Tut's tomb, visited every day of the tourist season by
2,500 and more, scientists found in November that bacteria were
eating away the colorful wall paintings.
   To accommodate tourist traffic, plans were made for restorers to
apply an antidote to the infested walls before and after hours. Once
they saw how serious the infestation was, however, experts decided
to work nonstop for three days.
   Tourists didn't hamper the work: the antidote smelled so foul
that once visitors took a whiff, they rushed out, leaving restorers
to their work.

SANTA A TOURIST ATTRACTION AT FARMERS MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Surrounded by crowds of excited teen-agers and exploding flashbulbs, I 
experienced Los Angeles' latest tourist attraction the other day in the Fairfax 
District. Me. 
</P>
<P>
Well, not me, exactly. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Claus was the focus of attention from Japanese visitors who piled by the 
busload into Farmers Market. That is where I was on rent-a-Santa duty to 
dispense candy canes and Christmas cheer. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the visitors were young. And most pulled cameras from their pockets and 
purses and rushed me when they spied Santa strolling among the outdoor shopping 
center's famous food and fruit stands. 
</P>
<P>
Each wanted a picture taken standing next to Santa No Ojisan -- that jolly old 
man in the red suit. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Claus is very famous in Japan," said tour guide Ken Kanazawa. "He's in 
many movies and on TV." 
</P>
<P>
The visitors explained that Christmas is known as seinaru hi in Japan -- a holy 
day in some parts of the world that is more of a fun day for Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
The day is much the same for some locals who frequent the 56-year-old 
marketplace, near one of Los Angeles' oldest Jewish neighborhoods. Many of the 
20,000 or so who stop off at Farmers Market each day are more likely to 
celebrate Hanukkah than Christmas at home. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, I was nervous when I was first told I was being sent on a 
four-hour Santa shift there -- even after officials of Western Temporary 
Services assured me that they often recruit Jewish Santas for seasonal work at 
shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
But my worries evaporated two weeks ago while on a Santa assignment at a mall 
in Manhattan Beach. That day, a group from Congregation Tifereth Jacob was 
conducting a menorah-lighting ceremony across the food court from my Santa 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, the rabbi's children, 5-year-old Marissa Hyman and her 
brother, Jonathan, 8, shyly waved at me. Then they came over and wished me 
happy holidays and handed me a tiny wooden dreidel -- a toy top that is a 
traditional symbol of Hanukkah. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers Market patrons treated Santa with the same kindness. 
</P>
<P>
Nora Handelman, Dorothy Levinson and Tillie Feinstein invited St. Nick to join 
them for coffee as they sat huddled against Thursday's unusually chilly weather 
in front of a marketplace doughnut shop. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein grabbed the bottom of my beard and lifted it up. "I want to see who's 
underneath there," she exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
Even the oldest of shoppers grinned when I stopped them to ask if they'd been 
good little girls or boys this year. They beamed when I reached into my candy 
cane bag to reward those who claimed to have been nice. 
</P>
<P>
I got a laugh when male shoppers happily confessed to being naughty. "Maybe 
Santa should give you the whole bag," I told them. 
</P>
<P>
When a 65ish woman who said her name was Doris demanded to know what Santa was 
bringing her this year, I suggested she sit on my knee and discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
To my surprise, she agreed. "This is the first time in my life I've ever sat on 
Santa's lap," Doris said. Her wish list included a cure for AIDS, rain for Los 
Angeles "and a man for me." 
</P>
<P>
Tourists at Farmers Market had different requests for Santa, however. 
</P>
<P>
Al Rolnick of Wilmette, Ill., was wishing for warmer sunshine for his Southern 
California visit. He could have stayed home if he wanted to be cold at 
Christmastime, he indicated. 
</P>
<P>
But Robyn Ford of New Zealand was looking for snow. It's summertime in 
Auckland, where she lives. Her family was stopping off briefly in Los Angeles 
on its way to Colorado for a skiing vacation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Vans and tour buses full of camera-wielding visitors were still pulling up when 
it came time for Santa to pull out. 
</P>
<P>
I changed out of my Santa suit and beard in market manager Sherif Barsoum's 
office before leaving. I hid the red suit in a bag. 
</P>
<P>
As I walked out wearing jeans and a sweater, I reflexively waved toward a new 
group of Japanese tourists flocking in from the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
They ignored me.

   The Great Pyramid of Cheops, the most
famous of ancient Egypt's royal tombs, was declared safe for
tourists and reopened Saturday for the first time in nine months.
   A Dutch woman and an American student were the first of the
scores of tourists who waited under the hot Egyptian sun to tour
the pyramid.
   Since August, workers had been sealing cracks, reinforcing
limestone slabs for safety and clearing vermin from the inside of
the magnificent structure, which now boasts television monitors.
   The restoration project was the first step in a five-year plan
to transform the pyramid area, including the Sphinx, into an
open-air museum.
   Gasping after the 155-foot climb to the King's Chamber, Sophie
D'Lang of Rotterdam said she and her husband were spending the last
day of a vacation in Egypt.
   ``I didn't think we had a chance to see inside Cheops,'' said
Mrs. D'Lang, who waited more than three hours for the re-opening.
``I think what they've done is great.''
   Michael Saxton of Dayton, Ohio, said he waited four hours. ``For
me the pyramid has special meaning because of the way it's built.
It's amazing.''
   The Great Pyramid is Egypt's top tourist attraction, and tourist
officials protested when it was closed Aug. 15.
   But the Egyptian Antiquities Organization prevailed with the
argument that newly discovered cracks in blocks lining interior
passages and a half-inch layer of salt on inside walls had to be
fixed without interruption by tourists.
   With a base of 13.1 acres, it stood at 481.4 feet when it was
built 4,600 years ago. Today, it is 31 feet shorter after losing
about a dozen layers and its capstone. It also has lost almost all
its outer facing of hard, white limestone, stripped for use in
stone bridges, irrigation canals, houses, walls and buildings.
   Zahi Hawass, director general of the pyramids area, said nothing
had been done to restore the pyramid's interior since it was opened
in the late 1830s.
   Hawass said in removing salt from the limestone walls, restorers
found weak and cracking rock throughout the pyramid.
   In the Grand Gallery, Hawass said, 500 limestone blocks were
restored and 16 granite slabs reinforced with stainless steel bars.
``Some of these slabs were in critical condition,'' he said.
   Cheops' lidless red granite sarcophagus, soiled by the touch of
generations of tourists, was cleaned of soot, grease and other
filth, Hawass said.
   He said insects and rats, which had invaded the pyramid, were
exterminated. Television monitors were installed to ensure that
visitors behave themselves.
   During the renovation, rubble was cleared and lighting added to
a chamber winding 396 feet beneath the pyramid, opening it to
tourists for the first time.
   Of the seven monuments listed as Wonders of the World by Greeks
of the second century B.C., only Cheops and the other two large
Giza pyramids remain intact.
   The remaining monuments on the list _ the statue of Zeus in
Olympia, Artemis' temple in Ephesus, the Colossus of Rhodes, the
mausoleum of Halicarnassus in Asia Minor and the Pharos lighthouse
in Alexandria _ were destroyed by warfare or earthquakes.

   The city that boasts the highest
average income in the country and attracts more tourists than
Disneyland is preparing to celebrate the 75th anniversary of its
sprouting from a lima bean field.
   And as one would expect from this capital of conspicuous
consumption, the 14-month-long extravaganza will be on a grand
scale, starting with a July 3 musical extravaganza, followed by an
ABC-TV special and a float in the Rose Parade.
   Former talk show host Merv Griffin, who owns the Beverly Hilton
Hotel, and singer Dinah Shore are the hosts of the musical, which
will include performers Jimmy Stewart, Betty White, Robert Stack
and Dick Van Patten.
   Merchants also are getting into the act, as only Beverly Hills
merchants can. Harry Winston, one of its more exclusive jewelry
stores, is crafting a slice of birthday cake iced with real
diamonds, said to be worth millions of dollars.
   The Labor Day weekend 1989 grand finale will bring together the
world's top fashion designers in what's touted as the world's
largest fashion show. More than 1,000 models will promenade along a
2{-block runway down Rodeo Drive.
   ``We want to attract as many people as possible,'' said event
chairman George Fenimore, who estimated the 14-month celebration's
cost at $1.6 million.
   Throughout much of its history, Beverly Hills, with its lavish
mansions and fashionable boutiques, has attracted worldwide
interest.
   ``It's just the fame of it,'' said tourist Sue Brown of
Doncaster, England. ``It's all very exciting. Most people know
Rodeo Drive, even in our little town.''
   The Los Angeles Visitors and Convention Bureau estimated that
between 16 million and 18 million tourists last year ambled through
the Golden Triangle, Beverly Hills' downtown district, compared
with 13 million at Disneyland.
   No wonder Beverly Hills is celebrating. The average annual
income in the 5.6-square-mile city is $125,000. There are more
licensed gardeners per capita than in any other U.S. city and more
Rolls Royces per capita than in London.
   There are more than $8 billion in deposits at its 100 financial
institutions, making it the nation's richest banking community
after New York. There's also a doctor for every 52 residents.
   Beverly Hills High School students watch from their football
field as an oil derrick pumps black gold from the school's 17 oil
wells.
   But what really separates Beverly Hills from other wealthy
communties is it's association with the entertainment industry.
   In 1920, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks built their
legendary home, Pickfair, in the northern reaches of the city. The
home has since been owned by Los Angeles Lakers owner Jerry Buss
and most recently by Meshulam Riklis and his singer-wife, Pia
Zadora.
   It all began in 1912 when developer Burton Green built a pink
and green palace, the Beverly Hills Hotel, above a bridal path
called Sunset Boulevard, on 12 acres of a lima bean field.
   The hotel was built at a then-staggering $500,000, today just a
fraction of home prices in the city.
   It was, and still is, the focal point of the city's social life.
In 1923, Will Rogers was inaugurated as the city's first honorary
mayor there, and its famous polo lounge is the site of the ultimate
power breakfast.
   In 1942, Billionaire Howard Hughes lived in four of the hotel's
famous bungalows, two used as decoys from reporters.
   Stewart, who filmed part of the 1946 classic ``It's A Wonderful
Life'' at Beverly Hills High, moved here with his family in 1948.
He often walks his two golden retrievers through his neighborhood.
   ``I wave to the tourist buses and sign people's maps to the
star's homes,'' said Stewart, who was honored by the five-member
City Council earlier this month as Man of the Year.
   ``A lot of people come up to me and say, `That guy looks like
Dean Martin,''' said Joe Patti, whose La Famiglia restaurant is a
popular celebrity hangout. ``And I say, `That IS Dean Martin.'''
   All the hoopla aside, Beverly Hills is a thriving city of
33,000, known for its community-oriented government.
   New commercial developments are limited to three stories and
fast food chains are banned. Its schools are among the nation's
best, with 93 percent of its students going on to college.
   ``I have great affection for Beverly Hills,'' Stewart said.
``It's a city built for the benefit of the community itself, not
just for a small group of celebrities.''
   ``Some people say, `Oh, you're just a snob from Beverly Hills,'
'' restaurateur Patti added. ``Well, they're just jealous.''

   American tourists grumble about prices in Italy even
as they pitch coins into the Trevi Fountain. The symbolic gesture
is supposed to guarantee a return to Rome, but that is something
fewer Americans can afford to do.
   ``We've been traveling for a month and this is the most
expensive place we've been,'' said Caroline Faris of Wilson, N.C.
``Paris and Nice were cheaper, and that's surprising.''
   Italian tour operators aren't surprised. They say Italy is
pricing itself out of the market with exorbitant rates and inferior
service. The government predicts that compared to last year, U.S.
tourism will drop by more than 6 percent, or 112,000 people.
   Tourism from other countries is on the rise, and students and
backpackers from the United States still jam the streets of
Florence and the ferries in the Venice lagoon. The drop-off is
among the big spenders.
   ``We are one of the most expensive countries in the world for
hotels and restaurants. And this comes with a very low level of
service quality,'' said Isabella di Montezemolo, a spokeswoman for
American Express Travel Services here.
   ``Our country is very rich in natural and historical beauty, but
people are getting a bit tired of the services,'' she said. ``They
feel they are being taken for a ride.''
   ``Our tourist services are 30 years old. They are too old, too
small and not competitive anymore,'' said Enzo Poli, the president
of a federation of 2,700 Italian travel agents and tour operators.
   Giovanni Colombo, the president of the Federation of Italian
Hotels, said that compared to last year, the number of foreign
tourists in Italian hotels has increased by 5 percent. Ms. di
Montezmolo cited a 47 percent increase this year in Japanese
tourism due to a favorable exchange rate.
   But industry officials are concerned about the drop in the
number of Americans, who traditionally are among the biggest
spenders.
   ``This year Americans won't be the big spenders and they will
shorten their vacations in Italy,'' said Franco Cesaretti of the
Aviatur travel agency in Rome.
   Franco Paloscia, spokesman for the Italian National Tourist
Office, said his government spent about $9.2 million over the past
two years to promote Italy's image.
   His office predicts Americans will account for 6 percent of
foreign tourism this year and at least 10 percent of the revenue.
In 1985, Americans made up about 7 percent of the tourists and 17
percent of the revenue.
   That was before the rise of Middle East terrorism in Europe and
the fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear plant accident in the Soviet
Union sent vacationing Americans elsewhere.
   The Italian tourism industry discounts the theory that recent
acts of terrorism in Europe, such as the killing of a U.S. diplomat
in Greece and an attack on a tourist ship there, are factors in the
declining number of U.S. tourists.
   ``Terrorism is not scaring American tourists anymore,'' said
Paloscia. ``Terrorism, pollution, strikes are problems which
tourists learn to live with.''
   Ms. di Montemezelo agreed, blaming instead the weak position of
the dollar.
   ``This is not connected to terrorism,'' she said. ``The decrease
is due mainly to the dollar. Bookings are done mainly in November,
and November was the lowest point reached by the dollar.''
   The dollar has rebounded from a value of 1,208 lire in November
to about 1,365 lire. But officials say that is not enough for
people to change their plans.
   ``Italy is extremely expensive, it is one of the most expensive
countries in the world,'' said Cesaretti of the Aviatur travel
agency. He said that in Rome, the average price of a night in a
first-class hotel is $184 to $220, while in Madrid it is $95 to
$110.
   An American Express spokeswoman in London, who asked not to be
identified, said a 14-day holiday in Spain at a three-star hotel
with breakfasts, some dinners and sightseeing tours would cost $965
while a comparable tour in Italy would cost $1,495.

<DATELINE>KORUMBURRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government has chipped
in $11,000 to help save the 12-foot, gurgling earthworms that
transformed Korumburra from a near ghost town to a bustling tourist
attraction.
   Several years ago, Korumburra decided to promote the
invertebrate, which has 16 hearts and is a hermaphrodite, meaning
it is both male and female.
   The great Gippsland gurgling earthworm is so named because of
the sucking and gurgling noises it makes when it burrows, sounding
like a bathtub draining water. Townsfolk credit the earthworm,
whose scientific name is megascolides australis, for helping turn
their fortunes around.
   An annual worm festival called Karmai, after the aboriginal word
for giant earthworm, is held each March. It celebrates the worm
with parades, carnivals and even an earthworm queen.
   Recently, however, intensive farming in the worm's small habitat
has raised fears the worms' days are numbered.
   Korumburra is in Gippsland, an area of the southeast state of
Victoria that once was covered by a rain forest where the worms
thrived. Today, that habitat has been reduced to an area of 100
square miles around the Bass River.
   Settlers, who thought the worms were snakes, cleared Gippsland's
rain forest with its 300-foot trees in the 1880s to make room for
dairy farming and cattle raising.
   Although not officially protected, the earthworm is now listed
as endangered, according to worm expert Georgina Hickey of the
Australian Museum.
   Federal Environment Minister Graham Richardson announced an
$11,000 save-the-worm grant last week as part of a $383,000 package
to study other threatened species in Victoria, such as the koala
bear and the fairy penguin. Korumburra began exploiting the
earthworm as a tourist attraction in 1977 after the local coal mine
went bust, a butter plant shut down and young people began heading
to Melbourne, 75 miles away, in search of jobs.
   ``The worm saved the town,'' said Mark Holmes, on whose property
most of the worms are found. ``The worms helped people have an
identity. I don't know if they're proud of what they've got but
we've got something unique. We've got a thing that is dropping off
the face of the earth.''
   Promoting the giant worms wasn't easy, local tourist offical
Judith Nicholl admits. ``Of all things in the world, how do you
promote a worm?'' she told a recent visitor. ``It started out as a
fun thing but now it's very serious. Now when visitors arrive the
first thing they ask is `Where is the worm?'''
   Visitors now flock to Korumburra, population 2,800. The town's
shops display fluffy toy worms and cute cutouts on windows, colored
pink because brown, the worm's natural color, isn't attractive.
   Festivities climax with a 100-foot fake worm resembling a
Chinese dragon that is hoisted and weaved through main street by 60
or 70 children.
   A nocturnal animal, the worms are difficult to dig up and
residents discourage the practice because the worms can break apart
and bleed to death when yanked from the rich clay on which they
thrive.
   Townsfolk proclaim the worm as the world's largest, although
long worms are found elsewhere in the world.
   Despite their fame, the local worms remain underground. There is
no worm museum in Korumburra or even a display. However,
entrepreneurs John Matthews and Tony Zoanetti opened a worm
attraction at Bass, 25 miles down the highway toward the Phillip
Island penguin reserve, a major tourist attraction.
   There, visitors enter a 300-foot-long building shaped like an
earthworm and can walk through a section that simulates the
internal view of the worm's stomach, complete with gurgling noises.
   Visitors also experience a worm's eye view of its world below
ground. With a $3 entry fee for adults, up to 1,000 people visit
the attraction daily.

FT  30 JUN 93 / Survey of Italy (12): Art becomes more visible - The Uffizi
gallery bombing has focused minds on culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNIFER GREGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON June 20, the Uffizi Gallery re-opened its doors, a mere 24 days after a
car bomb had severely damaged the western wing of the world's oldest museum.
Five people were killed in the explosion. Inevitably, the public imagination
was caught by what might have happened if the new form of terrorism had
destroyed this priceless collection.
Just as happened after the floods of November l966, when many of Florence's
treasured artworks and books were damaged, volunteers flocked to help.
Indeed, efforts to deal with the aftermath were impressive, including not
only the dedication of the Uffizi team (l50 in all) - with the help of
restorers from the famous Florentine laboratory, the Opificio delle Pietre
Dure - but also the determination of the Mr Alberto Ronchey, the minister of
culture. He insisted the museum be opened, at least in part, at the earliest
possible moment.
The ministry of culture is the poorest of all the ministries, receiving a
mere 0.02 per cent of the state budget - roughly L1,620bn a year. This is
equivalent to the amount spent by the French government on 60 new rooms of
the Louvre - FFr6bn. The Louvre also has five times as many paying visitors
a year as the Uffizi.
Mr Ronchey has proved one of the most successful appointments of the
government formed by Giuliano Amato last June (re-confirmed when Mr Ciampi
took over as Prime Minister in April). He has no party affiliations and is
not an art expert. In fact he started his career as professor of sociology
and economics at Venice University, followed by a long stint in journalism.
As cabinet heads have rolled amid revelations in the long-running bribes
scandal, Mr Ronchey's power has increased. The culture ministry has not been
immune, however. The last but one incumbent is under investigation over the
disappearance of L4bn for 'ghost' restoration works.
Tourism is now part of Mr Ronchey's field, the ministry for tourism and
sport having been demoted to a department of the prime minister's office
after a referendum in April.
The minister has realised the need for public support in his series of
struggles with entrenched Italian bureaucracy. But some of his battles seem
almost irrelevant in the general state of Italy's art - the attempt to
dislodge the Teatro dell'Opera's summer season from the Baths of Caracalla
(it is questionable whether people visit the monument or simply go to view
the elephants and horses of Aida) and banning rock concerts from the Arena
in Verona.
One stroke of genius, however, was his declaration of war on the vast army
of museum custodians by demanding that museums and galleries be open to the
public seven days a week from 9am to 7pm.
This battle was won at the outset in the Italian press, with the public and
tourists. He was mobbed like a pop-star outside the Uffizi on Easter Sunday,
as guides pointed him out to their tour groups as 'the man who opened up the
museums - even on holidays]'
Museum custodians account for 54 per cent of his ministry payroll - the EC
average is 28 per cent - and are high on the list of the most hated
professional groups in Italy. Loathed and feared by museum directors and the
public, they are said to derive pleasure from slamming museum doors in the
faces of tourists on once-in-a-lifetime trips.
Last year there were 21.5m visitors to Italy's museums, *something in here
(HP) *
down by 1m on 1991. The museums which lost out were mainly free entry, which
despite being splendid, such as the Villa Farnesina in Rome, have impossible
opening hours. The number of paying visitors to museums increased by
500.000.
The figures are not lost on Mr Ronchey. He plans to make under-l8s and
over-60s, who get free museum admission, pay something. He is also
determined Italian museums begin to offer services which are standard
throughout western Europe, such as restaurants, coffee-shops and bookshops.
And he has plans to open the door to private companies to run these
services.
Mr Ronchey's main objective is for the didactic material to be available on
video discs and video casettes, to enable visitors to get a restorer's-eye
view of the newly cleaned frescoes in the Sistine Chapel, or the Piero della
Francesca in San Francesco at Arezzo.
The proceeds of such projects will help the finances of the larger museums,
which are now freer of state controls. Earnings from the smaller museums
will go into a central regional fund, to be re-distributed according to
need. Enterprising competitors for the tenders, such as Ovidio Jacorossi of
Artemesia, are offering package deals to include air-conditioning, security
and restaurant services. The latter have already been provided for Rome's
newest and most comfortable exhibition space - the huge neo-classical
Palazzo Degli Esposizioni.
Mr Ronchey's latest battle is the fiercest, most important and maybe the one
most in danger of being lost. The military has refused to dislodge their
Officer's club from Palazzo Barberini, designated by the Italian government
in l949 as the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica (to hold 12th to l8th
century Italian art). The officers have used this now slightly decaying
billet in central Rome since l934, giving over part of a single floor to one
of the finest art collections in the world.
The gallery is composed of donations from the grand old Italian families,
such as the Corsinis and the Odescalchis, and includes Raphael's 'La
Fornarina', and several Caravaggios, Lorenzo Lottos and Filippo Lippis. Only
300 pieces of the l,500-strong collection can be displayed at any one time,
which the majority languishing in store-rooms.
Mr Ronchey, in his attempts to encourage the military to move out of the
Palazzo Barberini, issued a decree on April 21 to enable a pre-emptive
purchase of the handsome, turn-of-the-century villa on the Nomentana (just
outside the city walls), which was being sold by the state. L28bn was
rapidly raised from the finance ministry, and the defence ministry agreed to
pay restoration costs.
Mr Ronchey had hoped to save this architectural treasure from speculators
and free Palazzo Barberini for the National Gallery. Too simple. The decree,
guaranteeing that the finance ministry put up the money for the villa,
lapsed in mid-June, and although there is a 60-day prorogue the outcome is
in doubt - unless, as Mr Ronchey hopes, now, there is a public outcry. A
second decree has been issued, giving Mr Ronchey until August 21 to persuade
the military to accept his offer.
Some of Italy's long-hidden treasures will, however, be reappearing shortly.
On July 2 the newly-restored Palazzo Massimo opens to the public and Roman
statues and reliefs long hidden in the cellars at the Museum of Roman Art at
the Baths of Diocletion will at last be visible. The third section of the
Museum of Roman Art, based at Palazzo Altemps near Piazza Navona, will open
next summer.
It will house the fine groups of classical statues collected by the Roman
aristocrats in the l6th and l7th centuries, such as the magnificent 97-piece
Ludovisi collection.
Such efforts to make art more visible and the recent cleaning and
restoration work on a cluster of Rome's finest baroque churches, should make
the city a pleasure to visit.

FOR THE TOURISTS, HOLLYWOOD STILL HAS ITS GLITTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
New York tourist Marianne Muraca was puzzled when a stranger stopped her on 
Hollywood Boulevard and handed her a long-stemmed yellow rose. 
</P>
<P>
A few steps away, a guitarist was softly strumming a flamenco tune beneath a 
colorful, wall-sized portrait of silent movie actress Dolores Del Rio. 
Onlookers were nibbling on grapes, melon slices and cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Muraca was just as surprised by what happened next. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Woo stepped forward to tell those gathered at 
the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Hudson Avenue on Thursday that the new 
$27,000 Del Rio mural was another step toward sprucing up Hollywood's tacky, 
tarnished image. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives residents as well as tourists something to look at," said Woo, who 
represents Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Fingering her rose and glancing at her surroundings, Muraca confided that the 
Movie Capital of the World didn't look all that bad to her. 
</P>
<P>
The sidewalk known throughout the world as the Walk of Fame was filled with 
people. The boulevard throbbed with excitement. The sun was shining and the sky 
was blue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like New York City -- only cleaner," Muraca said. 
</P>
<P>
"And more elegant," added her companion, Long Island resident Brian Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood's main street is dismissed by many in Los Angeles as Hollyweird 
Boulevard -- home of degenerate rock 'n' rollers, runaway kids, panhandlers and 
prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are convinced that Hollywood's decline is more than cosmetic, 
however. Four years ago they launched a $922-million redevelopment effort to 
improve the area's mix of businesses, theaters and visitor accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
The comments of critics notwithstanding, Hollywood Boulevard still seems to 
glitter for most tourists flocking there this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I disappointed? Not at all!" exclaimed visitor Tina Harris of Vancouver, 
Canada, as she gleefully compared her handprints with those of Marilyn Monroe 
in the concrete courtyard of Mann's Chinese Theatre on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, other tourists crowded around barricades to watch a promotion stunt 
being staged by Warner Bros. for the new Bill Murray comedy, "Quick Change." A 
few visitors were picked from the crowd to climb into costumes to re-create a 
bank robbery scene in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Glover, a visitor from Edinburgh, Scotland, was one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best place I've ever been too," Glover said after he finished. 
"Everything here is brilliant." 
</P>
<P>
At a Los Angeles Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau office a few blocks down the 
boulevard, Denver visitor Bill Baldwin examined a rack of brochures for 
Hollywood tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood is not as bad as I thought it would be," he said. "I thought I'd see 
more druggies and prostitutes, more litter on the streets, more panhandlers and 
more run-down buildings. But I haven't. Either the media has overdrawn the 
negativism of the area, or it's on the rebound." 
</P>
<P>
Back out on the boulevard, self-styled Hollywood street person Dan Tanner voted 
for the rebound theory. 
</P>
<P>
In the "six years, off and on," that he has lived on the streets, Tanner, 22, 
says he has seen police crackdowns on loitering, the demolition of notorious 
transient crash pads and a general cleanup of litter and graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
He and his buddies have learned to keep moving when they are strolling the 
boulevard in their torn jeans, studded leather jackets and spiked hair, said 
Tanner, who grew up in Palos Verdes Estates. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner sports a blue-and-black striped Mohawk haircut and wears eight rings on 
his ears, tongue and other parts of his body. His appearance has made him a 
Hollywood tourist attraction of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
"People from out of town freak out when they see me. Tourists come up all the 
time and ask if they can take my picture," he said. "I say sure, for a dollar. 
It's better than bumming." 
</P>
<P>
As if on cue, visitor Mireya Gaxiola of Mexicali, Mexico, shyly tapped Tanner 
on the shoulder and asked if she could have her photo taken standing next to 
him. A few flash shots and one greenback later, the deal was done. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists say they are not surprised that genuine celebrities never seem to 
actually walk on the Walk of Fame that bears their names. But in a pinch, 
Hollywood can live up to its reputation as a town of make-believe, discovered 
visitor Tammy Strohl of Palmertown, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Strohl was waiting in line at a boulevard tourist shop called "Pose With Stars" 
to have a $10 photograph taken of her standing next to a cardboard cutout of 
her favorite entertainer, Dolly Parton. The shop's walls were covered with 
life-sized head-and-shoulders portraits of such entertainers as Elizabeth 
Taylor, Sylvester Stallone and musician Jon Bon Jovi. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping to see stars," Strohl laughed. "And here they are. All of them." 
</P>
<P>
Back at bigger-than-life Dolores Del Rio, visitor Scott DeSantis of Bound 
Brook, N.J., admired the mural. "I'll probably see more stars back in New 
Jersey than I'll see out here," he said. "But I'm not at all disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
After the speeches ended, the civic leaders lingered to discuss among 
themselves future Hollywood improvement projects. 
</P>
<P>
Woo listened politely as boulevard shopkeeper Mariam Hejazi buttonholed him to 
complain that the litter problem is out of control in front of her store. "The 
whole world looks at Hollywood. But when you look at it, it's really dirty," 
Hejazi asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Chamber of Commerce President Larry Kaplan -- whose organization 
represents many of the 1,200 businesses along the Walk of Fame -- was also 
fretting over tourism. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is they don't stay long enough to spend money," Kaplan said. "They 
pop a quarter in the meter, look over the stars on the sidewalk and the 
footprints over at Mann's and they're out of here." 
</P>
<P>
The one face in the crowd that seemed unconcerned was that of Del Rio, which 
gazed demurely toward Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder. City officials said muralist Alfredo de Batuc has protected her with 
a special anti-graffiti covering.

rock 'n' rollers, runaways, panhandlers and prostitutes, city officials believe 
it is making a rebound. Tourists seem to agree. Above, two visitors check out a 
few Hollywood maps and brochures. TONYA A. EVATT / For The Times

FT  05 DEC 92 / Travel: Rome, the only speed is slow - Michael Thompson-Noel
steps gingerly from sight to sight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THURSDAY, 9am. I am about to board a coach for a 3 1/2 -hour tour of central
Roman sights. It should not be over-strenuous: the Trevi fountain, Pantheon,
Piazza Navona, St Peter's and then back across the Tiber to my hotel near
the Villa Medici so I can gather my wits.
I have not been to Rome before, and already I can see that I will not be
disappointed. Rome is almost as I had imagined it, a giant pop-up postcard
crammed with so much stuff - large, important stuff: ancient, medieval,
Baroque and modern - that my head is spinning. Yet it is also strangely
different: more dynamic, but also more intimate; noisier and crowdier in
parts, but also more subdued; messier, nastier traffic, but also less
flamboyance than I had expected.
After a short drive we strike out on foot, and soon reach the Trevi
fountain. I distrust people who are snobbish about sight-seeing, and would
dislike anyone who had a rude word to say about this fountain. It is larger
than I had imagined, and so far over the top that I warm to it at once. On a
bench near the fountain a couple are canoodling. It is only 9.27, yet they
are whispering and licking ears. I borrow a coin, and am about to throw it
into the fountain - backwards, as instructed - when the guide rushes up. He
is not a happy man. He jabs his finger at me. 'You must keep up,' he says.
'If you do not follow me you are certain to get lost.'
We stroll towards the Pantheon. There is something to enjoy, some small or
large delight, at almost every step. I notice that even the smallest cafes
have Caravaggios on the walls and the bones of saints stashed beneath the
floors.
We are approaching St Peter's. On the sidewalk, a tramp shuffles past. A
woman tourist recoils from him in horror. His feelings are badly hurt. 'Go
on,' he shouts. 'Go and look at St Peter's, and then sod off home. Rome
doesn't need tourists like you.'
I spend a miserable 40 minutes in St Peter's Basilica, which depresses and
saddens me. I am intimidated, and know that I am meant to be, for this is
the architecture of totalitarianism. On the other hand, I recall what the
writer Malachi Martin said: that Romans have long memories, and remember the
time when the popes deserted them. Rome became the refuge of robbers preying
on a few farmers, its monuments overgrown, so dank and smelly that it was
known across Europe by the nickname 'Cowpatch.' Romans, says Martin, 'know
with surety Rome will always house the Great Fisherman. Or cease to be
Rome.'
1pm. I am restored to full happiness, for I am now enjoying lunch - an
American Thanksgiving lunch - in the rooftop restaurant of the Hotel
Hassler, one of the best in Rome, which is at the top of the Spanish Steps,
next to the twin-domed Trinita dei Monti Church.
In his latest travel book, The Happy Isles of Oceania, Paul Theroux warns
against the corrupting effect of staying too long in luxury hotels. Their
comfort and solitude, he says, can become an addiction. 'After even a short
experience of luxury, anything less is like punishment.' Theroux is a wise
man. But I am staying at the Hassler for only two nights, so my risk is a
small one. Its location is superb, and the comforts it offers are
complemented, as so often with grand hotels, by a zephyr of eccentricity.
3pm. Siesta.
5pm. I still haven't clapped eyes on the Colosseum, though I am reading a
first-rate book by Roberto Luciani (The Colosseum, Istituto Geografico)
which is telling me many things I did not know about the Flavian
amphitheatre and its circuses. For example: what high-society women most
longed for in ancient Rome was 'a gladiator of the Thracian speciality'
(shield and short sword).
7.30pm. I am half-way down the Spanish Steps, which are crowded with flirts.
There are knots of police, armed to the teeth. At the top of the steps, a
six-strong Peruvian pipe band is playing something mournful from the Andean
charts. The entire scene is heartwarming. Nor is it cold. Although it is
late November, the temperature is 15`C.
Malachi Martin says that May is the time to be in Rome, when the city is
filled with flowers and sparkling fountains and the sky is the one that
Raphael called 'the casement of Heaven.' But perhaps the thinning of the
ozone layer is changing things around. Perhaps, next century, Rome in May
will be as hot as Casablanca now, and tourists will only visit it in
December and January.
9.15pm. Still haven't caught sight of the Colosseum. I am dining at El
Toula, an extremely fine restaurant on Via della Lupa. I am in the company
of three intimidatingly senior UK female travel writers - women who know the
price of everything in 140 currencies and the value, when they encounter it,
of flakes of white truffle sensuously scattered across a plate of risotto.
We just keep on eating; nothing seems to stop us; soon we can hardly move.
Friday, 11am. I have spent the morning pottering, avoiding major sights,
concentrating on small stuff, the infilling of 20 centuries. Now I am in the
Keats-Shelley Memorial House, the Casina Rossa, on Piazza di Spagna, at the
foot of the Spanish Steps, chatting to the curator, Bathsheba Abse. Keats
spent the last three months of his life here, dying, of tuberculosis, on
February 23 1821. He was barely 25.
At Keats' death, the room in which he died was thoroughly disinfected to
comply with papal government regulations. The furniture, including windows
and doors, was burnt in the square. Ms Abse is planning to turn the room
back into a bedroom. You can still see the pale blue rosettes between the
ceiling rafters. There was little else for Keats to stare at. He said the
rosettes gave him the feeling of flowers growing over him.
1pm. Lunch in Piazza Navona. I am amazed, studying my map and glancing
through a guidebook, at the sheer tonnage of Roman sights I have not yet
been near. But you cannot hurry Rome, so what is the point of rushing?
4.30pm. Stretch limo to the airport. The traffic is appalling. Finally, in
the livid twilight, I pass the Colosseum. God, but it's . . . huge.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Denmark (7): Enormously successful mixture -
Profile of Legoland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE decided to obtain some proper consumer response before writing about the
Legoland family park, the miniature township built from millions of Lego toy
building bricks. So we took along Michela, aged 5 1/2 , from France.
It was a magical experience for her. She was intrigued and delighted by the
model villages, with ferries and cars plying a busy trade, and so convinced
by the life-size models in Pirateland (everywhere else the models are in a
scale of 1:20) that she was more than half-convinced that they were real
pirates, waving encouragingly to the automated marooned pirate who calls for
help from passing visitors in a doleful electronic voice.
Michela loved every minute of the four-hour visit and even that was not long
enough to sample all that Legoland has to offer. But by that time the adults
were happy with the day's success, if ready to drop. We had to give the
museum of dolls and dolls' houses and old mechanical toys a miss.
There was obvious satisfaction among the many other children in the park,
which delights children up to the age of about 13 - and also a lot of
parents.
There is something very Danish about Legoland, an enormously successful
mixture of amusement park - not at all brassy and not too large (the site is
about 10 hectares) - and town-in-miniature, as neat and as bright as
Denmark's well-kept farms and immaculate fields.
In fact, it is not just one township: the park is dotted with models of many
towns and villages, including Dutch, Danish and Norwegian, as well as models
of famous buildings, such as Brussels' ornate 15th century Town Hall,
correct in every detail and all in Lego bricks.
The word Lego comes from two Danish words 'lej godt', meaning 'play well';
and in the Legoland park there are plenty of opportunities to play, both
with the Lego bricks and construction kits and on the fair-ground
amusements.
It is a most unlikely place for a leading tourist attraction - in the middle
of the Jutland heathland, at Billund, far from any large population centres.
This, however, is where the Lego Group has the headquarters of what has
become one of the world's biggest and most successful ventures in the
manufacture of toys.
The group, a private company controlled by the Kirk Christiansen family,
which founded the company in the 1930s, has about 7,500 employees, of which
4,100 are in Denmark.
Published turnover in 1991 was DKr4.47bn, on which was made a net profit of
DKr341m. However, the published turnover applies only to companies employing
5,000 people, so total turnover is significantly larger.
Its manufacturing base is in Billund, but it also has manufacturing
operations in Connecticut (US), Switzerland, Germany, Brazil and South
Korea. Altogether the group has 36 companies in 21 countries.
It outgrew Denmark long ago. Ninety-eight per cent of its sales are outside
Denmark and its biggest markets now are Germany, the US, Britain, France and
Italy.
Lego has a lot of imitators and devotes considerable resources to trying to
prevent them from infringing Lego patents. But the Lego product has got what
it takes: the group noted in its 1991 annual report that, although there
have never been more imitators, their share of the market had fallen for the
fourth successive year.
In spite of its remote location, Legoland attracts about 1.1m visitors
during a season, which lasts for five months from May 1 to the third Sunday
in September.
It is Denmark's biggest tourist attraction outside Copenhagen. In 1991,
467,000 visitors came from Denmark, equivalent to one in 11 of the
population. From elsewhere in Europe, the number of visitors was: from
Germany (300,000), Sweden (140,000), Norway (66,000), the Netherlands
(51,000) and Britain (45,000).
Legoland has been a success in Denmark ever since it opened in 1968, but can
it be repeated elsewhere? Lego hopes so, and it has many enthusiastic
acolytes abroad.
When the company announced in 1991 that it was planning to set up Legoland
family parks in other countries, it received almost 1,000 inquiries, many
from mayors and governors anxious to acquire an important tourist attraction
for their own town.
It has now chosen six geographical locations for closer consideration, three
in the US and three in Europe.
The European locations are in the densely-populated border area between
Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, and in the London area.
In the US, California, the area around Washington DC and New England have
been singled out.
Each park will require an investment of about Dollars 100m, and aims to
attract about 1.4m visitors a year initially. Lego hopes to decide where the
first will be later this year or in 1993.

DIGGING UP PALMYRA: SYRIA'S TOP TOURIST ATTRACTION IS SLOWLY EMERGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KERIN HOPE, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PALMYRA, Syria 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Archeologists have been excavating this ancient oasis for more than 50 years, 
but it will take 30 more before the full splendor of Palmyra's temples, tombs 
and colonnades is restored. 
</P>
<P>
Lines of weathered columns gleam golden against green date palms. Hundreds more 
lie buried in the sand, along with piles of huge stone blocks dating back 1,800 
years to a time when Palmyra was the center of a kingdom on desert caravan 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
"If we brought in bulldozers, we could clear the site in six months, but we'd 
also destroy much evidence needed to assess the city's role in history," said 
archeologist Khaled Assad, the site director. 
</P>
<P>
"Doing it slowly means another generation of work by Syrian and foreign 
excavators. . . . We'll also be restoring as much of the ancient city as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
International Effort 
</P>
<P>
Polish, French, West German, East German and Japanese archeologists are digging 
in different areas of Palmyra. 
</P>
<P>
Syria, where human habitation has been traced back 150,000 years, is an 
archeological treasure house of the remnants of countless civilizations that 
have flourished and fallen throughout its history. 
</P>
<P>
About half of ancient Palmyra, about 4 1/2 square miles, has been unearthed. 
</P>
<P>
It's Syria's top tourist attraction, drawing more than 70,000 visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
Palmyra was important because it was the hub of the network of caravan trails 
that carried silks and spices from eastern Asia across the Roman province of 
Arabia to the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Challenge to Rome 
</P>
<P>
But its rebellious Queen Zenobia challenged Rome's authority. The city was 
plundered in AD 272 after Zenobia was captured during a long siege. 
</P>
<P>
"Palmyra is a unique site . . . a great responsibility, and we have to look 
after it, restoring the architecture, bringing it back to life," said Culture 
Minister Najar Attar. 
</P>
<P>
This year, conservators finished renovating a 3,000-seat amphitheater 
overlooking a colonnaded main avenue where plays, concerts and youth festivals 
will be staged. 
</P>
<P>
A tall, arched portico forms the backdrop, flanked by deep-set doorways and 
pillars made of limestone hauled from local quarries. 
</P>
<P>
"Palymra boasts very lively Roman architecture, and its public buildings are 
superbly planned," said Asif Bahnassi, a recently retired director of 
antiquities who supervised the restoration. 
</P>
<P>
"We've re-erected more than 150 columns as well as many masonry blocks. . . . 
You can feel the sense of spaciousness and grandeur." 
</P>
<P>
When excavations started in the 1930s, the villagers of Palmyra lived in the 
ruins of the huge temple of Bel, the Babylonian equivalent of Zeus, king of the 
Gods in Greek mythology. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Residents Resettled 
</P>
<P>
They were resettled in a town that now has a population of 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
The only modern building among the ruins is the 12-room Hotel Zenobia dating 
from 1918, mentioned in many Middle East travelers' memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
But it's unlikely to be torn down because "it happens to stand in the courtyard 
of a temple to the rain god Belshamin and doesn't overlie anything important," 
Assad said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he said, Syrian archeologists pulled 30 pieces "of really beautiful 
statuary" from an underground tomb dated around AD 98. 
</P>
<P>
In that period, wealthy Palmyrenes buried their relatives in family tombs 
decorated with sculptures and wall paintings of the deceased. 
</P>
<P>
The excavators are still looking for a likeness of Queen Zenobia. 
</P>
<P>
"She doesn't appear in the archeological record although we have a good deal of 
information about her. Her career was recorded in detail by Roman historians," 
Assad said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remains Were Razed 
</P>
<P>
The site of her palace has been identified, but a later Roman emperor, 
Diocletian, razed its remains and built a military camp there about 30 years 
after the city was captured. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3rd Century, Palmyra won tax breaks from the Romans that helped boost 
its commercial importance. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its markets for luxury goods, the city operated a network of 
caravan hostelries at 15-mile intervals -- equivalent to a day's journey. 
Palmyrene merchants owned ships that sailed in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
But Zenobia provoked imperial anger by asserting the city's independence after 
her Arab husband, Odeinat, died. 
</P>
<P>
"She was very ambitious for her son, Wahballat, but she was also a strong 
personality in her own right," Assad said. 
</P>
<P>
Called "the most beautiful woman in the Orient," she wore Roman purple and 
addressed her troops on horseback like an emperor on campaign. She followed 
political developments in Rome and hired a Greek philosopher, Longinus, as an 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Zenobia was seized by the Romans near the Euphrates River, while riding a camel 
to seek help against the Emperor Aurelian's siege of Palmyra. 
</P>
<P>
According to some historians, she was taken to Rome where she married a Roman 
senator and lived in a villa at Tivoli.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (29): Lots of attractions - Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tourism may well have the largest potential for growth of any industry in
Bolivia. At least that is the way the government sees it.
A plan to develop tourism - the first in the history of Bolivia according to
government officials - aims to boost industry income from Dollars 115m at
present to Dollars 1bn within a decade. Instead of the present 265,000
visitors a year close to 1m are to be enticed to the country.
'We want more tourists; have them stay longer; spend more money; and speak
well of our country when they leave,' says Mr Ricardo Rojas, secretary of
tourism.
'If you look at other countries that have been successful in tourism, you'll
notice that they've focused on a few well-targeted, key development
projects,' says Mr Rojas. A new tourism law, which the government hopes to
have approved by March 1995, will provide long-term tax exemptions to
attract foreign investment to several so-called 'mega-projects.'
In exchange for foreign capital, the government pledges to provide the basic
infrastructure for a project, train the personnel, and promote tourism
abroad. A list of proposed sites is to be made known shortly.
The government is aware that it faces a challenging task. Not only is there
an enormous information deficit about Bolivia among international tour
operators, but it also suffers from an image problem - that of a politically
unstable and drug-ridden country.
Many tourists still only visit Bolivia as part of a two- or three-country
tour. 'We get many tourists venturing into Bolivia on a brief excursion
following an extensive tour of Peru: that needs to change,' says the manager
of a leading tour operator.
As part of its promotional activities, the government inaugurated a tourist
office in New York on August 1 and plans to open others in Spain and Germany
by next year. A toll-free information line is operating in the US, and
Bolivia plans to attend international tourism fairs, including the World
Travel Market in London between November 14 and 17.
The image which the government will be trying to sell to the public is that
of a safe and cheap country boasting enormous diversity and friendly people.
One promotional brochure says that 'Bolivia is the new undiscovered tourist
destination' and that 'Bolivia is definitely the last frontier' for those
seeking ancient cultures or ecological adventure.
The potential exists. Tourist attractions in Bolivia abound. Only an 1 1/2
hours from La Paz, for example, are the crystal-clear waters of Lake
Titicaca, 4,000m above sea level and fed by the melting waters of the
snow-capped peaks of the Cordillera Real, which forms a breath-taking
backdrop.
On the island of Paco, the villagers of Suriki demonstrate their skills in
constructing balsas, or reed canoes, which the Norwegian explorer Thor
Heyerdahl used in his voyages and which the Spanish adventurer Kitin Munoz
is soon to take on a world tour.
Nearby, Tiwanaku is probably Bolivia's most important archaeological site,
featuring monumental stone figures and the so-called Sun Gate, which give
testimony to what was once the capital of one of the world's
longest-reigning empires.
The pre-Incan Tiwanaku civilisation, famed for advanced agricultural systems
that are now being revived, is said to have had significant cultural
influence on the subsequently larger Inca empire.
Opportunities for mountain climbing or trekking are numerous near La Paz.
Peaks such as the Ilimani or Huayna Potosi, rising over 6,300m are easily
accessible and can be climbed in two days. Stone-paved Inca trails, still
employed by farmers and their produce-laden llamas, are ideal for treks
through the Andean mountains.
A trip out to Bolivia's Amazon region is worthwhile. Visitors can see Jesuit
missions some 220km north-east of Santa Cruz in the middle of the tropical
rain forest.
Missionaries from Bavaria, Switzerland and Bohemia went there in the early
17th century to convert the Chiquitano Indians to Christianity and train
them as musicians and artisans.
Today, half a dozen of the world's most unique churches make the story of
The Mission come alive. They still serve as community centres for thousands
Chiquitanos.
Eastern Bolivia, with its rich biodiversity has enormous potential for
eco-tourism. A large number of local bird species, among them the
blue-throated or red-fronted macaws, make it an ornithologist's paradise.
Access to, and facilities within, the country's protected areas - which
boast a wealth of natural beauty - are rather limited, however.
A lack of infrastructure is also evident at other tourist sites such as
Samaipata, which features important vestiges of an Amazon tribe in the
Andean foothills but is still rather unprotected and unexplored.

FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Baden-Wuerttemberg (6): Scenery soaked in history
in the shadow of the Alps - Tourist facilities are on the increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUDOLF Forcher, mayor of Waldsee, likes to quiz his visitors about the
origin of his medieval town's name. Most think it stands for 'the lake near
the forest', the literal translation of Waldsee.
Historically minded visitors link it with Valdes, reputed founder of a 12th
century heretical movement who was in these parts before settling in the
Swiss canton of Vaud.
Mr Forcher has a more startling explanation - that the name actually derives
from the monks of Wales who travelled throughout Europe in the Dark Ages,
including Baden-Wurttemberg from where they passed on to Switzerland.
'Those who guess it get burned at the stake because we believe they know too
much,' the mayor jokes, referring to the witchcraft trials for which the
place is famous.
Behind him, large iron hooks are anchored in the solid walls of the medieval
town house. Standing up to look on a stone column where dates are inscribed,
Mr Forcher proudly points to 1530, the year 55 witches were enchained there,
interrogated and burned.
'Don't worry, we like tourists here,' he says smiling. 'We like diversity,'
he adds, grabbing a catalogue listing the various pedigrees of local
livestock. 'You see, our best ruminants come from Swiss cows and American
bulls.'
Mr Forcher can go on hours telling historical anecdotes and praising the
beauty of his region.
Together with other local personalities, he is a walking brochure listing
all the tourist attractions Baden-Wurttemberg can offer.
With 11m visitors and 38m accommodation bookings per year, Baden-Wurttemberg
rivals Bavaria as the most popular tourist area in Germany.
One of the best-known areas is the Black Forest with its romantic valleys
and narrow gorges. Lake Constance, with its panoramic views of the Swiss
Alps, is another perpetual favourite. Other attractions include numerous
spas such as Baden-Baden.
Baden-Wurttemberg offers, together with Bavaria, some of the best baroque
architecture in Germany. From a distance, the onion roof of Steinhausen
church could belong to an Austrian or Bohemian landscape. (The Austrians
controlled the area until Napoleon's conquest in 1806.)
Tourism, which earns some DM15bn a year for 200,000 businesses, rivals
agriculture as an important source of revenue, accounting for 4-5 per cent
of the state's gdp.
Unlike manufacturing, tourism has not yet been hit by the recession. The
number of tourists rose by 3.9 per cent in 1991.
But while most tourists are German, more foreigners are also arriving.
Between 1985 and 1989, foreign tourists increased by 12.5 per cent and
tourists from other EC countries rose by 20 per cent. The average stay is
four days.
To maintain this rising trend, Mr Dieter Spori, economics minister, is
anxious Spoto to improve facilities for youngsters and for the elderly.
Because of the recession, fewer Germans can afford the luxury of a fortnight
in the mud baths of the area's spas.
But, with Germans enjoying the longest vacations in Europe, it will remain
popular as a place for a second holiday. It offers Germans many of the
attractions of neighbouring French Alsace and German Switzerland but without
the anti-German sentiments evident in some of those areas.
'I finally put my finger on it and devised my moto,' says Mr Ulrich Ehrhardt
who oversees tourism around Lake Constance: 'If you want a holiday from your
last holiday, Baden-Wurttemberg is the place.'

FT  25 NOV 92 / Survey of Derbyshire (8): Second only to Mount Fuji -
Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To arrive at an overall picture of what tourism means to Derbyshire in
economic terms is difficult. Although the Peak National Park has 75 per cent
of its area within the county, it by no means occupies all of Derbyshire.
The park, which covers 550 sq miles, impinges on five other counties. But
some of the Derbyshire's best-known tourist attractions lie outside its
boundaries.
Buxton and Matlock, two well-known spa towns in Derbyshire, are both outside
the park. Buxton was once known as the Bath of the north. Today, it is
regrettably blighted and its famous 'Crescent' - John Carr of York's terrace
built in 1784 - is now boarded up and decaying.
But, using its famous opera house, it holds a festival each July. Buxton
also has a number of hotels.
Matlock Bath has a cable car, the Heights of Abraham Park and nature reserve
and Gulliver's Kingdom, a theme park.
These attractions pull in visitors over and above those going to the Peak
National Park, as does Derby itself with its art gallery and museum.
However, the county council does not concern itself greatly with the
promotion of tourism, leaving this to the district councils.
The authorities who run the national park do not involve themselves with
mass or popular tourist products such as theme parks. They believe these are
antithetical to the goals of running a national park.
These goals, they feel, are: preserving and improving the landscape,
encouraging the right kind of environmentally-concerned visitor and looking
after the interests of people who work and live in the park. There are
38,000 living and working there.
Neither the county council nor the Peak National Park has figures for
tourism for the county as a whole. The East Midlands Tourist Board said
three years ago it thought that tourism earned Pounds 120m for Derbyshire
and employed about 9,000 people.
The Derbyshire Dales District Council is heavily involved in tourism
promotion. Part of its area is within the national park and part outside.
The attractions it extols include the historic houses of Chatsworth and
Haddon Hall, the homes of the Dukes of Devonshire and Rutland respectively.
These are inside the park. The council also covers Matlock.
In 1990, Derbyshire Dales council estimated that it had 17m day visitors and
1.5m staying visitors. Estimated spending by visitors was Pounds 107m and
the number of people employed in tourism was 7,100.
The council estimated that this number represented 25 per cent of total
employment opportunities in the district of 66,000 people
Derbyshire is where Isaak Walton, a renowned angling writer, once fished
trout streams. It is where Charlotte Bronte set Jane Eyre. Clearly, the
county has a tourist industry apart from the national park, even if it is
difficult to quantify how big it is.
But it is the Peak National Park which is overwhelmingly the greatest
visitor attraction.
The latest survey undertaken by the park estimates that in 1991 it had 22m
visitor days.
According to Mr Roland Smith, spokesman for the park, this makes it the
second-largest visited national park in the world. Only Mount Fuji in Japan
attracted more visitors, he says.
The Peak National Park attracts far more visitors than any of the other 10
national parks in England and Wales. It is much more heavily used than any
of the famous parks in the US.
It is not hard to see the reason why. The Peak district is surrounded by
large conurbations. Sheffield and Manchester to the north, Derby and
Nottingham to the south.
It has been estimated that half the population of England is within two
hours' drive of the park.
Apart from the historic houses and pretty country towns, visitors go to
explore the huge subterranean caverns, and for walking, bird watching, and
other outside pursuits.
The Pennine Way begins in the park. It starts at Edale and winds 250 miles
to the Scottish borders.
The proximity of large cities and the ease of access puts the park's
authorities in a dilemma. The sheer volume of visitors means great wear and
tear on often fragile terrain. Moreover, although there are 22m visitor days
there are only 500,000 'staying guests' visitors.
This means the park does not make as much income as it might.
In 1991 it was estimated that the park made Pounds 75m. The town of
Portsmouth on the south coast makes three times as much from a fraction of
the number of visitors. This figure does not include those staying in hotels
in places like Buxton.
The aim is to diversify the kind of visits to increase income and to ease
the pressure. The pattern has been changing.
Mr Smith says: 'A few years ago visitors were people having a day out. They
often didn't leave their cars. They drove around, drank tea from a Thermos
and threw litter out of the window. They spent little and usually didn't
even buy petrol in the park. I have noticed that recently the number of
walkers has crept up to the point where they are probably as many as the
drivers.'
To encourage more environmentally-friendly tourists who stay longer, the
Peak authorities have tried to open up the district. They have negotiated
between 20 and 30 access agreements with private landlords. These agreements
now cover 80 sq miles.
They have signposted trails and footpaths and published literature on walks.
They have have set up visitor information centres and have encouraged cycle
hire centres. The park has a number of park rangers who have a policing
role, although they do not like to be called police.
There is a constant programme of repair and improvement of footpaths and the
landscape.
In terms of increasing accommodation, the park is not the planning
authority. That task falls to the High Peak District Council and the other
district councils.
But it has been closely involved with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food (Maff), the Rural Development Agency (RDA) and other bodies in
helping farmers diversify into farmhouse holiday accommodation.
It has also been active in converting barns to provide basic camping
facilities for school groups and similar visitors.
Mr Smith emphasises that any building has to be sympathetic to the local
environment. Local materials have to be used and planning applications are
expected to be in tune with the park.
He says: 'A scheme for a time-share project was turned down by the council.
We are not here to encourage mass tourism. We are here to look after the
landscape and conserve the environment and to encourage the kind of tourists
who will appreciate what is on offer.
'Increasingly, we must look after the interests of people who live here.'

  [Text] Beijing, June 4 (XINHUA) -- Order has been restored 
to a renowned Great Wall tourist spot near Beijing through 
measures taken by the municipal government in the past two 
months. 
  Police said that no extortion or racketeering cases had been 
reported at the Badaling section of the Great Wall, a drive of 
about 90 minutes from the city centre, since the end of April. 
Forced sales had evidently decreased. 
  Since the beginning of the year, the famous tourist site had 
been plagued by cases of forced sales, extortion and 
racketeering. The victims were Chinese and overseas tourists, 
and sometimes even foreign diplomatic personnel could not 
escape, according to police sources. 
  As a result, normal tourist order disappeared, and the 
number 
of visitors to that site declined. 
  Concentrated efforts were made from late April. A team of 
300 people, from police departments, industrial and commercial 
administration departments and city order departments, regularly 
and persistently inspected the area, achieving remarkable 
success. 
  Seven illegal vendors were detained. The stock of four 
stalls near the wall was confiscated and they were banned from 
trading for two months. Confiscated goods and fines totalled 
31,000 yuan. 
  In addition, education courses were given to vendors at the 
site and farmers around the area. 
  Police said they have improved telecommunications and 
transport equipment for the site. Police and industrial and 
commercial departments extended their own daily duty times by an 
hour. 
  The Badaling section of the Great Wall, which in 1991 was 
listed as a world top heritage site by the United Nations, 
stretches along 3.7 km. More than five million tourists visited 
the site last year.

<HEAD>Thousands of India's Ancient Monuments Crumble From Neglect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SEEMA SIROHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PURI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of monuments and temples from
India's ancient past are neglected and forlorn, slowly crumbling
under the onslaught of time, weather and vandals.
   Even the Taj Mahal, the 17th-century ``monument to love'' that
perhaps is the best-known symbol of India's past, is in trouble,
its marble yellowing and cracking under the assault of fumes from a
nearby oil refinery.
   Decay and disregard also blight such famed monuments as the
domed, 12th-century temple to the Hindu Lord Krishna here in Puri
and the erotic temple sculptures of Khajuraho.
   Lesser known but historically no less important monuments suffer
even more.
   Hundreds of poor people make their homes or even keep their
cattle in Mogul tombs. Others cart away chunks of monuments to
build makeshift houses. Marble is scratched with uncaring visitors'
names, and peepul or fig trees sprout from cracks in ancient walls.
   Critics attribute the disrepair to a lack of regard for history
by most Indians, a large majority of whom are concerned with
day-to-day survival, and a lack of will on the part of the
government.
   Despite protests from environmentalist, the oil refinery still
operates near the Taj Mahal in Agra, the magnificent tomb built by
the Mogul Emperor Shah Jahan for his favorite queen, Mumtaz Mahal.
   But even at that, the Taj, which attracts 1.4 million visitors a
year, is the best preserved of India's monuments, with pollution
levels at least monitored and treatment applied to stained marble.
   The famous erotic temples at Khajuraho in central India are one
of India's main tourist attractions. But large parts of the temples
are covered with moss and algae, and hundreds of smaller statues,
awaiting transport to museums, lie exposed to the sun and rain.
   Of the 85 temples built in the years 950 to 1050, only 22
survive. Those are protected from vandals and treasure hunters only
by a single barbed wire fence.
   In India, the Archaeological Survey, a 125-year-old government
body, looks after 3,524 monuments of ``national importance,'' and
state governments are responsible for 1,500 other historic
buildings. But that still leaves thousands of sites, either ancient
or notable for artistic beauty, with no protection.
   ``We try to maintain what we have in the best possible
condition,'' said J.P. Joshi, the Archaeological Survey's director
general.
   ``We have helped them survive. Ninety percent of India's ancient
history is our contribution. We have worked hard and quietly.''
   But conservation enthusiasts, such as Abhishek Singhvi, vice
president of the Delhi Conservation Society, contend that the
Archaeological Survey and the states simply do not have the money
or qualified personnel to look after all the majestic remains.
   ``This is not a priority area and funding is a perpetual
problem,'' Singhvi said.
   The survey received about $12 million for monument protection in
1985-86, or an average of $284 a month for the maintenance, repair
and protection of each of the 3,524 monuments on the list.
   The conservationists maintain the nation as a whole has become
complacent about its history.
   At Puri, one of the four major Hindu pilgrimage centers, major
leaks appeared in 1966 in the dome of the temple to Lord Krishna,
but 21 years passed before restoration started.
   The work was blocked by the temple's own priests, who went to
court claiming that repair would anger the gods and cause the
temple to collapse.
   Local kings had covered the temple with thick plaster to save it
from the salty sea breeze about 300 years ago. In time, the plaster
began to absorb water, adding enormous weight to the dome, causing
cracks and making it vulnerable, said Guru Prashad Mohanty, the
temple's chief executive officer.
   The court rejected the priests' claims last year, and hundreds
of Archaelogical Survey workers now are chiseling away the old
plaster, exposing hidden statues and strengthening the temple.
   Not all efforts at restoration have such happy endings.
   In New Delhi, which is a composite of seven cities built by
different rulers dating to the 8th century, some monuments simply
disappear as modern neighborhoods overwhelm smaller tombs and
courtyards.
   Singhvi said a 1913 survey listed about 1,400 monuments in New
Delhi. Of these, 400 have vanished without a trace, most likely
torn down overnight by people putting up houses, he added.
   New Delhi, which is a federal territory and not part of any
state, has no law empowering it to take over monuments, and it must
depend on the Archaeological Survey for conservation.
   Singhvi and other conservation enthusiasts say one way to raise
money to save India's past is to raise admission prices at
monuments, maybe as much as five times current levels. He said
foreign tourists could easily pay 70 cents instead of the present
15 cents to see the Taj Mahal.

FT  15 JUL 92 / Warning over tourist industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent

<TEXT>
POORLY paid and badly trained hotel employees, together with inadequate
public transport, threaten the UK's position as the world's fifth most
popular tourist destination, according to a study by the National Economic
Development Council.
The NEDC study, published yesterday, says the UK has held its own in the
international tourist industry over the past 20 years. Its share of tourists
was 4.2 per cent of the world total in 1990, the same as in 1970. Its share
of world tourist spending has remained about 6 per cent for 20 years,
suggesting Britain has been attracting visitors who spend more than the
average.
The study says, however, that this success masks worrying trends. Skill
levels in UK hotels are lower than in continental Europe. British hotels
also employ more staff than their continental counterparts but pay them
less.
The report says both the private and public sectors should raise the quality
of tourist facilities. The private sector should also improve training and
productivity, which would make the tourist industry more attractive to job
entrants.
The UK has attracted increasing numbers of visitors from the US and Japan,
but has been less successful in northern European markets.
The NEDC, which is due to be abolished at the end of the year, says that UK
tourism should not try to compete on price. 'Comparison of the UK with other
destinations shows that overall it is not particularly expensive; London
falls into the middle range of leading European cities.'
The report urges the tourist industry to create a new representative body to
stress the sector's importance. Tourist spending, including domestic
tourism, accounts for nearly 4 per cent of GDP and employs 1.6m people -
more than the health service.
Surveys carried out for the NEDC list British culture and heritage, the arts
and London as attractions mentioned most often by visitors to the UK. Only
the US, Spain, France and Italy attract more tourists.

<HEAD>Atlantic City's Old-time Piers Are Fading Fast</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fabulous piers of Atlantic City
are falling victim to fire, disrepair or commercialization. Gone are
the days when they featured big bands and ballrooms, aquariums,
church concerts and diving horses.
   When Steeplechase Pier burned down Saturday, the resort was left
with only four piers. Only one can be called commercially successful.
   The gaming halls that opened during the past 10 years are now
Atlantic City's main tourist attraction. But back in the late 1800s,
the resort's piers _with the soft, white-sandy beaches and ocean _
were the lure.
   The book ``So Young, So Gay,'' a collection of Atlantic City
historical facts, tells of numerous piers built and rebuilt since
1880, mostly for entertainment purposes such as concerts.
   ``Atlantic City doesn't seem to be a resort for piers anymore,''
said Atlantic County historian Adrian W. Phillips. ``I think the
temperament of Atlantic City has changed, and I just don't see the
piers coming back.''
   Saturday's fire at Steeplechase Pier caused more than $1 million
in damage, but shut down only a fast-food restaurant facing the
Boardwalk and a heliport. The pier, closed to the public in 1986,
was once know as ``the funny place'' for its variety of amusements
and theater acts.
   ``It had a variety of slides, rides and novelty features that
kept everybody entertained,'' Phillips recalled. ``It was famous for
that enormous Chesterfield cigarettes sign with thousands of
lights.''
   If the remnants of the pier are demolished as expected, four will
remain:
   _ Garden Pier holds the city's art and historical museums and a
small outdoor theater area. It is in need of repair, although plans
are under way to refurbish it, said Phillips.
   _ The old part of the famous Steel Pier overhanging the ocean is
being demolished, although owner Donald Trump has said he will
eventually rebuild and widen what remains as an extension of his
massive Taj Mahal casino project.
   _ Central Pier is now used mostly as a lucrative billboard
location and for storage, although souvenirs and arcade machines are
out front near the Boardwalk. A tower that once gave tourists a
bird's-eye view of the city is rapidly deteriorating.
   _ The burned out remains of the old Million Dollar Pier became
the Ocean One Mall in 1983, the only successful pier. It's designed
to look like an ocean liner, and attracts tourists bored with
gambling. It recently opened a small section with indoor amusement
rides.
   ``This is a shopping center where families can come to have a
good time,'' said Ocean One advertising manager Rita Similides.
``We're trying to emulate the old amusement piers as best we can.
Sometimes it's easy and sometimes it's not, given the interesting
mix of people that now visit Atlantic City.''
   But Phillips said, ``In no way is Ocean One family entertainment,
nor does it parallel what Steel Pier or Steeplechase Pier used to
be. There's no variety of entertainment.''
   Besides Ocean One, at least one casino has tried to capture the
nostalgic image of the past _ but indoors. TropWorld Casino and
Entertainment Resort recently opened up ``Tivoli Pier,'' an indoor
amusement center with attractions and rides.
   Trump eventually will develop Steel Pier with a ``family
entertainment'' focus, said Stephen Hyde, chief executive of Trump's
casinos.
   ``The problem we would have in making it like the old-time piers
is the cost of maintaining everything just for a short summer
season,'' he said. ``If you bought a Ferris wheel at 1962 prices,
you wouldn't mind leaving it in the salt air, but at 1988 prices, it
doesn't make sense to use it only in the summer months.''

FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (11): Attractions of peace - Tourists are
returning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EGYPT'S tourist industry is celebrating its own victory just 12 months after
it was plunged in gloom by the Gulf crisis.
In the wake of a publicity drive, Dr Fouad Sultan, the tourism minister, is
ebullient. 'Trends are extremely positive. We are worried about
overbooking,' he says, adding that he hopes this season will be the best on
record.
Last year began on a less happy note. In the fiscal year July-June 1990-91
the industry recorded 16.5m tourist nights compared with the record of 22.1m
the previous year. The drop in tourist income was even more dramatic - by 60
per cent from Dollars 2.5bn to Dollars 1bn.
But the first quarter for this fiscal year (July, August, September) showed
a strong rebound. In August 1991 the number of tourists from Arab countries
rose by 5.6 per cent. The average increase in arrivals in August 1991 stood
at 2.5 per cent. The recession in the west continued to affect non-Arab
arrivals which fell by 9 per cent.
The activity at some of Egypt's famous tourists sites only partly reflects
the improvement shown by the statistics. In Luxor, site of the Karnak Temple
on the east bank of the Nile and the Theban necropolis on the west bank,
tour guides confirm an increase in tourists compared with a year ago, but
say numbers are still well down on 1989.
'We used to have 4,000 tourists a day visiting the tombs in the Valley of
the Kings before the Gulf crisis. Last year there were days when no-one
came. Now we have 1,000 a day.'
Ferries used by tourists to cross from the east to the west bank at Luxor
are running well below capacity although local tour operators reported
capacity bookings in Luxor's 33 hotels for January.
Dr Sultan feels confident that occupancy rates at Cairo hotels for this
holiday season would reach 98 per cent, 75 per cent in South Sinai (Sharm el
Sheikh), 60 per cent in Hurghada on the Red Sea coast, and 65-70 per cent in
upper Egypt - Luxor and Aswan.
He attributes some of the success to Egypt's marketing campaign after the
end of the Gulf war when the government and private sector launched a
campaign to sell Egypt as a secure destination.
Another factor may have been that many tourists had delayed their travel
until after the Gulf crisis, contributing to a surge in arrivals in the
early months of the new fiscal year.
Mr Sultan anticipates that tourist nights for 1991-1992 will reach something
like 25m (compared with 22.1m in 1989/90). Income will exceed the Dollars
3bn achieved in 1989/90.
He says that another positive trend has been the fact that many hotels in
Egypt are reporting tourists returning for a second, third or even fourth
time. Mr Sultan says the average stay in Luxor, which used to be about one
night, is now three.
The main change, he claims, is that people now know Egypt 'not only for
culture, but also for other activities such as leisure and conferences'.
Egypt has encouraged the development of more and better facilities for
tourists over the last 10 years. As a result an important factor in the
growing number of arrivals has been the large increase in the number of
hotel beds.
In June 1991, there were 53,000 rooms compared with fewer than 25,000 rooms
in 1985. Another 14,000 rooms are under construction and will be completed
in the next couple of years.
Dr Sultan says the authorities have been successful at stimulating private
sector investment in the tourism sector which is by far Egypt's fastest
growing industry.
There is also evidence that Egyptian nationals with large off-shore dollar
deposits are beginning to invest in the sector.
New projects including extensions to the Meridien Hotel in Cairo and
ambitious schemes on the Red Sea coast south of Hurghada are attracting
investment from foreigners as well as Egyptians.
The industry has its tensions, however. For some involved in preserving
Egypt's ancient monuments, the government is pursuing development at the
cost of preserving historical sites.
'We take our monuments for granted. The government exploits their earning
potential, but does nothing to protect or develop them. Not enough is being
done to curb pollution and ensure we have historical attractions for decades
to come,' says a tour guide in Cairo.

<HEADLINE>  WE HAVE MUSEUMS FOR BASEBALL, WAR AND ROCK
'N' ROLL -- WHY NOT FOOD?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The Hugheses of Great Falls, Va., are trying to create a World Food
Museum.;    For a number of reasons, this is a wonderful idea.;    As our
country has laid down more and more asphalt, it has lost most of its roadside
attractions honoring food. I'm talking about restaurants shaped like
pineapples, or towers formed of gargantuan tomatoes and celery stalks that can
be spotted from miles away. Even the Oscar Mayer Weinermobile that travels
around the country is a type of American shrine.;    This is not to imply that
the Hugheses' museum concept will involve large plastic objects dotting the
landscape. While they appreciate zaniness, the Hugheses have a lofty goal for
their museum: educating us about our food heritage.;    Tom Hughes points out
that the American Association of Museums has a list containing the names of
museums devoted to enlightening us about baseball, rock 'n' roll, crime, war
and hundreds of other subjects. Amazingly, there is no food category.;    The
Hugheses' remedy would be a network of community museums, each exploring a
specific food's origins, nutritional importance and role in society. The food
in each museum would correspond to the food produced in that area.;    As its
name implies, the network of museums would not be confined to any particular
section of the country, or even the United States -- there's the dairy
industry in Wisconsin, the maple syrup industry in Vermont, the saffron
farming industry in Spain, garlic in Gilroy.;    The network could include
corporations. For example, these industries could be a part of it: the potato
chip makers of central Pennsylvania; the ketchup-producing Heinz company in
Pittsburgh; peanut-growers in the South; or corporations with existing food
museums, such as the Ocean Spray Cranberry World in Plymouth, Mass.;    In
California, Castroville would have an artichoke museum. Napa, which already
has instructive wine tours, would expand on them by putting together a museum
that shows how grapes are grown and traces their effects on society through
the ages. Gilroy, of course, would have a scientific/sociological display
regarding garlic, its most famous product. And so on.;    "We are not looking
to establish agricultural museums, although there is a part of that in what we
are trying to do. We are looking at food resources and their effect on our
culture," Hughes said recently.;    Or, as a brochure concerning the World
Food Museum puts it: The goal "is to explore and explain the history and
promising future of the world's foods" and address, among other concerns, how
to feed the hungry in a crowded world, food safety, water conservation and
saving the heritage of our food resources by examining production,
distribution and processing.;    Hughes sees schoolchildren and adult
volunteers as benefiting and contributing to the community museums.;    The
endeavor is a part-time one for Hughes, a schoolteacher, and his wife, a
writer.;    He points out that they already own much information relating to
various foods and are well-connected in the world of food and food science.
The Hugheses' now-closed Potato Museum, made up of items amassed over 15
years, contributed heavily to a display called "Seeds of Change" they prepared
for the Smithsonian Institution. The major exhibition focuses on food events,
among them those involving the potato, that dramatically altered life in
post-Christopher Columbus America.;    Aside from their educational value,
Hughes thinks food museums would help communities attract tourist dollars.;   
"Cities end up proposing aquariums to attract tourism. Other cities have
aquariums. Why not branch out into something nobody has? Take Salinas. That is
a prime place to celebrate produce. Tourists just pass by. This is a place
where virtually nobody visits, but might if it had an interesting museum," he
said.;    Watsonville, hard-pressed by a series of setbacks that include the
Loma Prieta earthquake, drought, the recent freeze and plant closings, might
do well to think about attracting tourists with such a venture.;    "If this
thing is going to happen, it could begin to happen with organizations forming
in California, because not only is California a dynamic state that picks up on
good ideas, it is the premier agricultural state in the country," he said.;   
Is that a challenge masquerading as flattery?;    Yes. Absolutely.;    IF
YOU'RE INTERESTED;  Information regarding the Hugheses' vision, the World Food
Museum, as well as membership in the Potato Museum, may be obtained by

<F P=106> ["Special Article" by reporter Wen Chang (3306 2512): "War </F>
Front Jinmen Is Undergoing Drastic Changes"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong 27 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--As soon as 
the "state of war" was ended in Jinmen in November 1992, a 
"craze for Jinmen" promptly surfaced, with eager tourists coming 
to the island in an endless stream, hoping to have a look at the 
famous "war front", and the "strait frontier paradise" that had 
been closed for 40-some years, but is full of opportunities for 
business. People would like to see for themselves what the 
atmosphere was like on the island. Statistics showed that in 
1993 alone, around 240,000 people in Taiwan sent in applications 
to visit Jinmen. Jinmen, the "war front" of yesterday, which 
had been shrouded in mysterious veils, has turned into a hot 
spot, which tourists are vying to visit. 
  Jinmen is located in the Xiamen Bay, only 2,310 meters away 
from mainland China at the nearest point. That being the case, 
it had long been the outpost in the confrontation between Taiwan 
and the mainland; in addition to the 40-some-year enforcement of 
martial law on the island, Jinmen had become an "out-of-bounds 
area" in the hearts of the people in Taiwan. Jinmen comprises 
15 isles of various sizes, with a total area around 17,800 
hectares, of which the two largest isles, Dajinmen and 
Xiaojinmen, account for 85 percent of the total area. According 
to 1988 statistics, its population was approximately 45,718 
(excluding troops stationed on the island); the number of people 
of Jinmen origin scattered all over the world was estimated to 
be 140,000. 
  Most inhabitants in Jinmen engage in farming. The root and 
tradition of their habits in life could be traced back to 
Fujian's Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, and the residential houses on 
the island were mostly built after the traditional architectural 
style of southern Fujian. There are 40-some historic sites on 
the island, along with many places of scenic beauty. The famous 
lion-shape god [feng shi ye 7685 3740 3639,] a unique 
traditional sign of Taiwanese of Fujian origin is a peculiar 
object for human study, and was said to be a patron saint that 
had power to control storms and dispel evils and monsters, a 
popular belief; its duplicates can be found almost everywhere on 
the island. 
  Aside from historic sites, the military installation and 
sites leftover from the CPC-KMT [Kuomintang] confrontation are 
full of attraction to tourists. For example, the Guning Museum 
of War History, and the Qionglin Underground Village. 
  Since martial law was lifted and the island was opened to 
tourists, Jinmen has undergone drastic changes. The opening up 
has brought the island swarms of people as well as opportunities 
for business. Taiwan-Jinmen airline tickets are sold out most 
of the time, despite several flights back and forth every day. 
The greatest opportunity for doing business is the tourist 
industry. According to the press, hotel rooms are in short 
supply in Jinmen, and all financial groups were vying for 
stationing on the island to initiate building projects in a big 
way. Thus, many overseas Chinese or Chinese residing overseas 
of Jinmen origin, including those from Brunei, the Philippines, 
and Singapore, as well as foreign businessmen, have come to 
invest in the island one after another; that has simultaneously 
brought along development of the catering business, the movie 
and television industry, as well as the motor-driven toy 
industry. Some businessman said that whatever there were in 
Taipei, there would be in Jinmen, too; thus, gambling, drug 
addiction, and pornographic businesses were on the rise. 
Consequently, Jinmen, which used to have a simple social 
amosphere, was under violent attack. 
  Because of foreign investment swarming in, prices of 
Jinmen's 
real estates rocketed almost overnight. The indexes published 
by Taiwan's Ministry of the Interior showed that price hikes of 
Jinmen real estates topped Taiwan; last year, land prices went 
up by 60 percent over the same period of the previous year. 
Today, Jinmen's land price is approximately NT $300,000 [New 
Taiwan dollars] per ping [0988, approximately 36 square feet, a 
Japanese unit], and its land has become the most sought after in 
Taiwan. 
  To meet long-range demands, building of various 
infrastructure projects and tourist installations has 
accelerated. The Jinmen civil aviation station that costs NT$ 
820 million will be completed and delivered to use by the end of 
1995; by then there will be 25 airliners coming in or going out 
everyday; it is hoped that will bring Jinmen more tourists. 
Besides, the government has decided to build a "national party" 
in Jinmen, which will add some attraction to Jinmen's scenery. 
The people's greater concern is whether or not the 
establishment of transport, trade, and postal relations will 
first be implemented in Fujian's Xiamen, which is very close to 
Jinmen; should that be the case, Jinmen's prospects will be 
brighter still. Just like Taiwan's media put it: The golden 
gate is open when Jinmen is opening up. How can anyone remain 
indifferent facing such temptation!

   El Morro Castle, the fortress
Spaniards built 400 years ago to keep out pirates and now a major
tourist attraction, has become a battleground for tree lovers and
those who demand historical authenticity.
   In the tree-lovers camp are conservationists and a group of art
students protesting what they call the ``chainsaw massacre'' of El
Morro's trees by the National Guard after Hurricane Hugo struck on
Sept. 18. All 200 trees on the 21-acre site, not just those damaged
by the storm, were chopped up and hauled away, leaving a litter of
stumps.
   In the opposing camp are the National Park Service and Puerto
Rico's Commonwealth Historic Preservation Office. They control
separate areas of El Morro and authorized the clearance as part of
their plan to restore the site to its original state _ a treeless
garrison.
   About 100 students at the School of Plastic Arts, which is on El
Morro grounds, planted saplings and protest placards outside the
school and have been maintaining an around-the-clock vigil there
since early October.
   The students, who once did their artwork in the shade of the
trees, have organized protest marches to the governor's mansion, La
Fortaleza, demanding reforestation of El Morro.
   Conservation groups have taken up the cause, which has provoked
a stream of letters in The San Juan Star, including one containing
Joyce Kilmer's most famous poem, ``Trees.''
   W.P. Crawford, the National Park Service superintendent in
Puerto Rico, said Hugo's 140-mph winds left only few trees standing
at El Morro and most of the rest were too badly mangled to be saved.
   Taking them out was only thing to do, he maintained.
   Besides, Crawford said, a 1983 general management plan, approved
two years later by the U.S. and Commonwealth governments, said the
broad grassy slope leading to the fort should be treeless, the way
it was originally.
   ``Maybe with a superhuman effort some of the trees could have
been saved,'' he said. ``But because the general management plan
calls for removing all the trees, I didn't think it was worth the
time and effort of nursing a dozen or so along.''
   ``What we are trying to do is protect the historic scene,'' as
mandated by Congress for all U.S. historic sites, Crawford said.
``The historical context has got to be No. 1 by law.''
   Archaeologist Guy Pantell, who has asked the presidential
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation in Washington for an
investigation, said the historical argument did not justify the
destruction of trees not damaged by the storm.
   ``If this was so, parts of El Morro would have to be eliminated.
Its construction occurred during several centuries,'' Pantell said
in an interview with the Star.
   The walled fort, which overlooks San Juan Harbor, was built
mostly between 1589 and the 1650s to guard the city against
seaborne attack. Today, it is by far Puerto Rico's most popular
tourist attraction, with 2.5 million visitors a year.
   Tourists approach El Morro's tiered batteries across a 200-yard
esplanade, which is a popular place for picnics and flying kites.
Historians say the esplanade was purposely kept clear of vegetation
to give El Morro's defenders a clear line of fire.
   But during the 1940s, soldiers planted about 50 sea pines and
coconut palms along the road in front of El Morro, which at that
time had a U.S. Army officers' club. Other trees were planted
nearby on land controlled by the Commonwealth government.
   Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon, who had endorsed the tree removal,
has reversed his position and appointed a committee to work out a
compromise.
   Committee member Enrique Marti, founder of the conservation
group Pro Bosques Urbanos, or Pro Urban Forests, said the panel had
agreed to selectively plant trees at El Morro to keep the main
esplanade clear. He said the landscape would look better than it
did before the hurricane.
   But not everybody is satisfied.
   ``Our children will see the trees, but we won't,'' said Lourdes
Quintero, 24, one of the protesting art students.

NEWS AND BRIEFS: PISA MAYOR BEMOANS LEAN TOURIST SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Compiled from Times news services and staff reports. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven months after the Leaning Tower of Pisa was closed to the public, work to 
keep it from toppling has yet to begin and the mayor of the tourist-abandoned 
city is appealing to Rome for help. 
</P>
<P>
The tower's 293 steps were last climbed on Jan. 7, when the former mayor 
reluctantly locked the wooden doors to the 180-foot tower with a steel key and 
expressed hope that work would begin soon so the monument could reopen. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the mayor's office has a new occupant and the city has been losing 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in entrance fees -- the monument attracts some 
800,000 tourists a year who pay $3.35 U.S. apiece to climb the spiral staircase 
for an odd view of the Tuscan city. 
</P>
<P>
Some tourists still pass through Pisa, but with the tower closed, the city is 
less appealing, and newly elected Mayor Sergio Cortopassi said he would ask 
Italian Premier Giulio Andreotti for help. 
</P>
<P>
Cortopassi's predecessor signed an order last December authorizing closure, but 
experts have yet to get moving on a plan to stop the 800-year-old tower from 
leaning further. Experts estimate the work will cost $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
Snakes alive: Train travel in China has always been an adventurous proposition, 
but it has become even more creepy of late. 
</P>
<P>
"For nearly one month, railway departments have seen various species of frogs 
and snakes filling train aisles, crawling on luggage racks and even in 
restrooms," according to a report in China's Legal Daily newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The cause is the illegal capture and sale of frogs and snakes by Chinese 
peasants with an eye for profit. Frog and snake meat are considered delicacies 
in China, but demand has outstripped supply, resulting in "wanton killing and 
trafficking" by industrious hunters, according to the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
More than three tons of wild frogs and toads and 1 1/2 tons of snakes were 
confiscated by Shanghai authorities in May alone, the newspaper said, adding 
that in one instance, 30 bags of live snakes weighing 1,650 pounds were 
discovered being illegally smuggled on a freight car. 
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh, van gone: A total of almost 1.3 million art lovers visited the 
"Vincent Van Gogh Retrospective" during its four-month exhibition at 
Amsterdam's Vincent Van Gogh Museum and the Kroller Muller Museum in Otterlo. 
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented collection of masterpieces from museums and private 
collections around the world closed last Sunday, the 100th anniversary of the 
Dutch artist's death. 
</P>
<P>
The Amsterdam museum, which normally attracts 700,000 visitors a year, 
attracted 860,000 people since the exhibition opened March 31, while 431,000 
visited the Otterlo museum, 62 miles from Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
The museums used a reservations system to cut down on the anticipated crush in 
queues, limiting visitors to 700 an hour in Amsterdam and 500 in Otterlo. The 
system was observed with interest by officials from the Louvre in Paris, the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and London's National Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Big Easy riders: United Cabs in New Orleans has been encouraging riders to take 
longer rides in cabs by allowing them to use their Visa and MasterCards for 
fares on local trips, city and plantation tours and, especially, airport trips. 
There's a $5 minimum on all credit card charges. 
</P>
<P>
Border opening: Finland and the Soviet Union may open their border to allow 
Germans to visit the graves of thousands of compatriots who fell in World War 
II, the Helsinki newspaper Uusi Suomi reported. 
</P>
<P>
In return, a German war graves society is ready to pay $1.85 million U.S. to 
help finance the road and rail connections that the two countries plan to open 
to boost tourism. 
</P>
<P>
Germans fought alongside Finns against the Soviet Union during the 
Finnish-Soviet War of 1941-44, and many were buried in land later ceded to the 
Soviet Union. There are thought to be as many as 5,000 German war graves north 
of the 800-mile border. 
</P>
<P>
Flea-ing Venice: Visitors to Venice this summer have been plagued by an 
infestation of water fleas. The insect's bite produces a rash similar to a 
sunburn, followed by dozens of painful blisters. Doctors have been inundated 
with patients suffering these symptoms, and Italian health authorities blame a 
type of water flea that lives in the algae on the city's lagoons and thrives in 
hot weather.

  [Text] Wuhan, February 6 (XINHUA) -- Wudang Mountain, a 
well-known sacred site for Taoism, one of the predominant 
religions in ancient China, has become an ideal place of 
investment for more and more investors, especially those from 
overseas. 
  Situated in northwestern Hubei Province and on the southern 
bank of the Hanjiang River, the mountain is famous for its many 
historical associations, beautiful scenery, rich popular 
legends, unsophisticated local customs and rich reserves of 
medicinal herbs, as well as martial arts and Taoist music. 
  According to local officials, the Wudang Mountain area has 
signed more than 40 letters of intent for the establishment of 
foreign-funded enterprises, five of which are under construction. 
  As the local government has made painstaking efforts to 
upgrade transport and telecommunications links to the outside 
world, Wudang Mountain has also become a popular tourist 
attraction. 
  Wudang Mountain receives at least one million domestic and 
overseas tourists a year. So far, tourists from more than 50 
countries and regions have visited the area. 
  Construction of several large tourism projects, including a 
"Water Amusement World on the Jianhe River" and a passenger 
cableway, has started in Wudang Mountain, with the purpose of 
further improving the environment for tourism. 
  Local officials added that they are presently working hard 
to 
list Wudang Mountain as one of the world's famous cultural 
heritages and historical towns.

<TEXT>
   Only in Beverly Hills could a
$200,000, chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce be considered an eyesore.
   But that's the problem facing David Spellerberg, who says he has
gotten nothing but complaints _ and threat of prosecution _ for
parking his 1954 black Rolls in front of his art gallery on Rodeo
Drive.
   He says his neighbors aren't just mad about the car, but the
people it attracts: namely thousands of tourists in the last six
months who have posed in front of the sleek black beauty while
their pictures were being taken.
   ``Anyplace else in the world and people would be happy to have a
Rolls-Royce parked in front of their business,'' said Spellerberg.
``But not Beverly Hills.''
   Spellerberg readily admits he leaves the car in the one-hour
metered space as a tourist attraction at the National Heritage
Gallery, which sells seascapes and other traditional-style
paintings and sculptures.
   His chauffeur stands by, reading a book and feeding the meter
with $15 in quarters each day.
   ``After all, wasn't it the public and tourists that made Rodeo
Drive and Beverly Hills famous?'' he asks in a full-page ad taken
out Friday in a local paper. ``This magnificent vintage Rolls-Royce
has allowed thousands to capture a touch of the `glitter and
glamour' that Beverly Hills is famous for.''
   But the city doesn't see it that way. In fact, the city attorney
wrote to Spellerberg's attorney saying that the matter has been
passed to the ``litigation-prosecution department.''
   There was no answer at city hall offices Friday, which was a
state holiday. But in general, parking meter regulations in the
region do not allow motorists to keep their cars indefinitely in
one spot, even if they return periodically to feed the meter.
   Spellerberg, however, says he won't give up. His advertisement
in the Beverly Hills Courier urges people to phone City Hall and
speak up in support of the Rolls.
   ``This is just one of those crazy things your hear about,'' he
said. ``I didn't think it would happen to me.''

FT  15 NOV 93 / Survey of Harrogate (3): The spa resort with a sparkle -
Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HARRIET ARNOLD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE centre of Harrogate is exceptionally easy on both the eye and the shoe
leather thanks to its spa resort elegance and the rare proximity of its many
tourist attractions.
The town boasts probably the most sulphurous springs in the country,
bringing the sweet stink of success in the late Victorian and Edwardian eras
when the town enjoyed its heyday as the hydropathic (water treatment)
industry took off. The Harrogate curative concoction was described by Bertie
Wooster, in Carry on, Jeeves, as 'practically equivalent to getting outside
a couple of little old last year's eggs beaten up in sea water.' He was
possibly understating the case.
The Harrogate water can still be sampled at the Royal Pump Room Museum, on
the site where a famous early nineteenth century Harrogate figure, Betty,
dispensed a sulphurous brew. Today's luckier visitor can follow up the
experience with a visit to a completely different Betty's establishment, the
town's most celebrated cafe tea-rooms.
The spa may have gone but the town has continued to develop its status as a
tourist spot and a base from which to make forays into the rest of
Yorkshire. The result is that the tourist information centre now handles
275,000 inquiries a year, says Mr Stuart Mackay, head of marketing and sales
at the Harrogate International Centre (HIC).
Visitors are drawn by the graceful architecture, the antiques and other
shops - the number of fashionably hatted ladies testifies to the well-heeled
atmosphere - the floral displays and the restaurants. That's just the town.
The surrounding area is bristling with stately homes and historical sites as
well as being close to the natural wonders of the Yorkshire Dales.
Tourism contributes about Pounds 80m-Pounds 90m to the local economy
according to Mr Stuart Quin, economic development officer for Harrogate
borough council. In 1987, Peat Marwick McLintock estimated that 3,500 jobs
in the area were directly attributable to the centre's activities. Another
2,500 are estimated to depend on holiday tourism.
'The centre's economic impact has been greater than expected,' says Mr Quin,
whose own figures indicate that employment in the Harrogate travel-to-work
area rose from an index of 100 in 1981 to 178 in 1989.
The centre promotes tourism opportunities as part of the mix which it can
offer its customers and is also responsible for maximising the number of
accompanying visitors and holiday tourists.
Local businesses have also become involved in shaping the area's strategy.
The A Group has started to contribute funds to developments at the centre on
a results basis. Its chairman Mr Frank Flaherty, general manager of the
Majestic hotel, says this 'indicates to the town that we are prepared to
work closely with the centre'.
In return, Mr Flaherty and his colleagues expect a say on what is planned.
For instance, he observes, 'a residential-based policy was critical.' A
Group also participates in the centre's marketing exercises to potential
customers.
The UK and international recession has affected Harrogate and it has come as
something of a shock to the town that even some of its more significant
hotels have been unable to avoid financial problems and in some cases have
gone into receivership.
There is concern that more could be done to target the holiday visitor. 'The
holiday tourist has been somewhat neglected,' says Joy Allan, president of
the Harrogate Chamber of Trade and Commerce, and part owner of the
privately-owned Green Park Hotel near the town centre, 'as the marketing
emphasis has been towards the business tourist.'
The marketing mix could change soon, as the council is currently debating
proposals on the direction holiday tourism should take. Mr Quin says that
two main points have emerged from a consultation process undertaken for the
council: 'There is overwhelming agreement that the district should be
marketed as an integrated product, and there is a great deal of goodwill on
the part of those operating private facilities towards the idea of
co-operating more fully with HIC.' Suggestions have been made for
enhancement of all-weather facilities, and a visitor management strategy has
been mooted, with greater co-ordination of tourism information.
Harrogate's spa industry may also live again, this time as a leisure
attraction. The council is examining the prospective rewards, based on
growing interest across Europe in spas. Much of Harrogate's spa
infrastructure, such as the wells and the Royal Baths Assembly Rooms
building (where a municipal Turkish Bath still operates), is still in place.
Other developments being closely watched by the council include the
recommendation by the Countryside Commission that the Nidderdale area should
officially become an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and North
Yorkshire's bid for European Community Objective 5B status, which allocates
cash to poor rural areas. If the area is designated eligible on January 1
1994, the council plans to use some of the funds to enhance local rural
tourism.
Transport to and around the town is a weakness, and the council is keen to
see a bus station restored to the town, having already campaigned
successfully for improvements to the railway station. It is also supporting
Leeds/Bradford Airport's application for authorisation for round-the-clock
flights.
Plans for marketing the area's attractions are many but, as Mr Quin points
out, the rich heritage alone will not keep Harrogate's well-heeled ladies in
hats or their menfolk in the latest cars.

FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of Bahrain (6): The bright lights beckon - Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAHRAIN's biggest tourist attraction dare not speak its name.
However hard the island markets its virtues as a tourist destination - and
the government is marketing these more vigorously than ever - it will not
advertise its liberal drinking laws as being among them.
Islamic propriety prevents the government from selling Bahrain on the basis
of its bars. But since Bahrain's neighbours prevent the selling of alcohol
altogether, little selling is required.
More than 1.4m people arrived in Bahrain last year for tourism or recreation
 -75 per cent of them fellow Gulf Arabs. An average of around 160,000 of
these visitors a month arrived over the 25km causeway which links Bahrain to
the eastern province of Saudi Arabia, which is very strictly teetotal - 'the
Saudis, very bluntly, come here for R and R,' says one official.
It would not be entirely accurate to claim that these visitors all crossed
into Bahrain just for a weekend drink (by far the majority cross only for
the day and a half of the Moslem weekend) - although numerous expatriate
workers with Saudi Aramco, the kingdom's giant oil company based over the
causeway in Dhahran, make no bones about the fact that they do.
Whatever Bahrain's additional attractions, and these include a good number
of Arab and western-style nightclubs, several top-of-the-range hotels and
restaurants and a generally accommodating atmosphere, Bahrain's weekend
popularity adds up to an industry worth, by government estimates, more than
Dollars 1bn a year - more, if the figure is correct, than its aluminium
smelter, for instance.
It also adds up to a growing and labour-intensive industry which the emirate
is, given its acute need to create jobs for young Bahrainis, exploiting to
the hilt.
According to government figures, the hotel industry in 1990 employed just
656 Bahrainis out of a total workforce of 3,249. However, Mr Tariq Almoayed,
the minister of information who is responsible for tourism, believes that as
many as 10,000 Bahrainis could eventually be employed in the sector.
On the path to that, as yet far distant, dream, Bahrain has set up a hotel
and catering training centre, which injects 200 Bahrainis a year into the
industry and which this year will add a year-long course in travel and
tourism to its curriculum.
The island is also adding fast to its hotels, particularly those of two- and
three-stars which cater for the bulk of visiting Saudi and other Gulf
families, on the basis that each new room equates roughly to one new job.
Bahrain already has 23 two- and three-star hotels and an additional 10 are
being built. 'With relatively small investment, you can create very large
opportunities for employing Bahrainis,' says Mr Almoayed.
The government's Tourism Development Company is also expanding - to the
extent that it can afford - the range of attractions offered on what is, to
be honest, a fairly small and featureless island. The company has set up bus
tours, dhow trips to nearby Dar island and has just completed an
impressively housed Arabic restaurant, in full wind-towered Gulf style,
beside the equally impressive new museum on the emirate's north coast.
The company also helped establish the island's first beach club at Al
Bander, which gathers an excellent fish restaurant, bars, holiday
apartments, a swimming pool and tennis courts round a small, man-made cove.
But the Al Bander development, to be followed shortly by the opening of a
new Meridien resort hotel - the island's first such - on a spit of land off
Bahrain's northern shore, points up some of the limitations the island faces
in promoting itself, as it is also seeking to do, as a rounded, upmarket
tourist spot.
To begin with, the island is acutely short of beaches. In fact, Bahrain at
present has only one public beach to speak of - the Emir's beach to the
island's south. The Al Bander beach has been hewn and sanded out of
otherwise rocky coast, and the Meridien will also have to create its own
sandy shores.
Moreover, much of the country's coast will be impossible to develop for
tourism - the east coast houses most of the island's heavy industry, much of
the west coast is taken up by private villas and the dagger-tip south coast
embraces the island's main airbase and is thus firmly out of bounds.
The government hopes, nevertheless, that the Meridien and Al Bandar will
create what one official calls a 'small critical mass' to pump-prime further
private sector investment into developing upmarket tourist features. One
hope is that the island's five five-star hotels will loosen out of being
purely business hotels into providing a bit more tourist fun.
But in aiming further upmarket and away from purely causeway-fed tourism,
Bahrain suffers badly from comparison with Dubai, its go-getting United Arab
Emirates rival further down the Gulf. Dubai's aggressive bid for the same
tourist market is already supported by three large resort hotels, one grassy
golf course, with another on the way, long stretches of sandy beach and,
most important, by something in the region of 10 times Bahrain's oil
revenues with which to invest further in tourist attractions. A large theme
park, for instance, is already well into planning.
Bahrain's hope is that visitors will include the island as one stop on a
regional Gulf tour - though at present, inter-Gulf co-operation on tourism
is as fraught with rivalry as other areas of regional economic endeavour.
Nevertheless, the island's promoters have persuaded the South African
airline Flitestar to open weekly flights to Bahrain later this year carrying
what, for the most part, will be tourist passengers.
In the end, though, it will be the bright lights visible from Saudi Arabia,
promising Egyptian and Filipino nightclub entertainers, a small feast of
Italian, Greek, Arabian, Chinese and Indian restaurants and, of course, the
odd glass of Johnnie Walker, which will keep Bahrain's future hotel and
catering school graduates busy on a Thursday and Friday evening.

FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (26): A paradise for pioneering spirits - The
tourist industry is working to change the country's negative image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ancient Inca festival of Inti Raymi, celebrating the midsummer solstice,
is one of Peru's great tourist occasions.
In a spectacular three-hour pageant inside the sacred fortress of
Sacsayhuaman, Cuzco, locals re-enact the legendary clash between the Inca
and Spanish cultures. Fantastically colourful costumes and swirling dances
accompanied by a solemn narrative intoned in Quechua make for an
unforgettable experience.
Much of the charm of festivals such as Inti Raymi - repeated on different
themes and different levels of splendour throughout the year in every
Peruvian town, village and hamlet - is that they are not organised for the
tourist. They are times when local people abandon everyday austerity and
give themselves over totally to music, dance, religious or pagan ritual -
and drink.
Tourism in Peru is not for the faint-hearted. With a few important
exceptions, a certain pioneering spirit is required. Travelling by road and
air, while easier every day, demands stamina and good humour - flights may
be cancelled without warning, carefully booked hotel reservations may prove
untraceable.
For the past five years, numbers of tourists have plummeted from a high of
120,000 to maybe a quarter of that. Any news abroad concerning Peru seemed
bad news. Hyperinflation, economic chaos and guerrilla violence (although
tourists were rarely caught up in it) kept all but the most adventurous -
some would say the foolhardy - away.
Now Peru is working hard to change that image. 'Tourism is the great
multiplier,' says Mr Victor Joy Way, third vice-president of Peru, formerly
minister of trade and tourism. 'It creates a market for craftsmen, a boost
for restaurant-owners, taxi drivers, tour guides - almost everyone in a
community benefits.'
The fall-off in tourism has hit Cuzco, the ancient Inca capital, worst of
all. 'More than 95 per cent of local inhabitants are partially dependent on
tourism,' says Mr Edwin Gonzalez, manager of El Libertador hotel and a
director of the hoteliers' chamber. 'Since the 1988 collapse, many hotels
have closed, special tourist buses have been sold and experienced staff have
found other jobs. When the tourists come back in numbers, we'll be
unprepared.'
June and July were better months, however. Occupancy rates, at about 25 per
cent, were up on the previous year, although well below the 40 per cent
needed to break even. Europeans currently account for over half of all
visitors to Cuzco, according to Mr Gonzalez, replacing the Americans who are
still dissuaded by their embassy from travelling within Peru.
Lima hotels are now busier than for several years past, although the
mini-boom is largely business-led, according to Mr Eduardo Arrarte,
president of Canatur, the national tourist chamber. He points out that
international recession has hit the tourist industry worldwide in recent
years, but 'Peru's image is still bad, or it has improved only at the
highest, governmental levels. The message hasn't got down to the travelling
public yet.'
Changing trends in world tourism should eventually favour Peru, he says. The
average tourist, who wants to visit as many places as quickly as possible,
will be the mainstay of the market for many years to come, but specialist
tours are in ever greater demand. Peru is a paradise for nature-lovers,
bird-watchers and butterfly enthusiasts; the high Andes are wonderful,
largely unexplored terrain for hikers and climbers; and alongside the
long-famous Inca cities of Cuzco and Machu Picchu are dozens of less
familiar sites and less renowned cultures.
Adventure tourism is also growing. Paragliding and bungee-jumping have
caught on, while opportunities abound for white-water rafting, some as
little as two hours away from Lima. Peru's Pacific rollers draw surfers from
many countries.
While convinced that development of tourism must be a matter for the private
sector, the government is doing what it can to provide the bases for growth.
Deregulation of domestic airways has already spawned a clutch of small
airline companies which have inaugurated new air services to a number of
hitherto remote provincial towns. And the transport ministry has made a
priority of asphalting stretches of roads leading to tourist attractions.
Outside Lima, hotel infrastructure leaves much to be desired. But investment
has already begun. The discovery of the tomb of the Lord of Sipan led
directly to the construction of three new hotels in the nearby coastal city
of Chiclayo. And El Libertador, Cuzco's leading hotel, is expanding capacity
from 130 rooms to 250 in anticipation of a tourist boom.
South Korean hoteliers are reported to be taking a close look at investment
opportunities in Cuzco. Their government has offered Peru Dollars 18m to
rehabilitate the city's airport and feasibility studies are under way. One
prime hotel property which could soon become available is the former
monastery of San Antonio Abad, owned by Cuzco's archbishopric. Dollars 4m
has already been spent on it.
The government and Canatur would like to see cities such as Ayacucho - most
famous as the cradle of Maoist guerrilla movement Shining Path, but also one
of Peru's loveliest colonial towns - become tourist centres. Official
estimates are that the average tourist spends Dollars 1,200 in a week's
stay, a potentially huge boost to national and local economies.
'The first tourists will be guinea-pigs, of course,' admits Mr Arrarte.
'They'll be roughing it a bit, but that's how it always starts. I bet we
find some very happy pioneers for Ayacucho.'
One opportunity to 'sell' Peru falls on November 4 next year, when a total
solar eclipse will be visible from the southern Peruvian coast. All 5,000
available hotel beds in the area have already been reserved by international
travel agencies.
'When those people come, visit a few other places, go home safe and happy
and tell their friends, it'll be the best promotion we've had for years,'
says Mr Arrarte. it

   Smelly sewage notwithstanding, the Tiber is having a
renaissance.
   Once the river was the lifeline of Rome. From ancient times to
just a century ago, Romans bathed, fished and washed their clothes
in it.
   Rome's unplanned development boom after World War II, however,
proved too much for the river. In 20 years, the population swelled
from 1 million to more than 3 million.
   Anyone foolish enough to swim in the Tiber risks fatal infection
from the untreated sewage that pours into it daily. Today's Romans
don't have the habit of going down to the river _ a stroll there
means sidestepping broken bottles, rats and syringes discarded by
drug addicts.
   But this summer gave Tiber lovers hope the tide is turning their
way in the battle against pollution and neglect.
   With an eye on developing tourist attractions for 1990, when
Rome hosts the World Cup soccer games, the city offered free boat
rides during July. The response was so great that the promotion was
extended into September.
   Tickets sold out for sunset cruises to the romantic setting of a
play performed at the Roman amphitheater at Ostia Antica, the
Tiber's ancient port.
   Hot, breezeless nights found young Romans playing cards and
dancing on Tiberina Island.
   ``The fish will return, there will be pleasure boats. This isn't
the Thames, but there's reason to believe the Tiber can be made
livable for flora and flauna,'' said Aurelio S. Misiti, a sanitary
engineer and professor at Rome's La Sapienza University. His
department works closely with the city on Tiber projects.
   While dictator Benito Mussolini had declared the river
contaminated and banned swimming and transport in 1924, Misiti
noted, postwar governments didn't get around to prohibiting the
dumping of sewage into it until 1976.
   ``In 1974, Rome started building the first purification plant,''
Misiti said in an interview. ``Now there are four plants, but they
can only handle a bit less than half the discharge, and that's just
talking about urban waste, not industry's, which is supposed to be
handled by the factories themselves.'' The sewage treatment program
was supposed to have been completed years ago.
   Misiti said it should be finished by 1992 and ``after that the
Tiber should return to normal.''
   Just outside the city, fisherman pull in edible catch from the
river, which begins its 251-mile course in the Etruscan Apennines.
   Paola Ruggeri of the World Wildlife Fund says the city for the
most part doesn't enforce regulations forcing factories to purify
their wastes before spilling them into the Tiber.
   Since 1982, her group has rented from the city a stretch of
riverbank and intends to keep it as a green oasis.
   Willows, poplars, even a fig tree, lean out to the water, making
that stretch look more like Mark Twain's Mississippi than a river
channeled through a noisy, traffic-plagued international city.
   ``Every week volunteers come to clean it and every week we find
a mountain of garbage,'' Ms. Ruggeri said.
   Until about a century ago, the city spilled down to the river
banks, leaving Rome vulnerable to devastating floods, roughly every
couple of hundred years.
   After many suggestions, including those of Giuseppe Garibaldi,
the unification hero, the government began walling off the Tiber
and demolishing buildings at river-level. Now pedestrians and cars
move along, at bridge-deck level, with the Tiber's murky green
waters are out of sight below.
   Earlier this year, when the city planned its annual April 21
celebrations of the legendary founding of Rome by Romulus along the
left bank of the Tiber, it hosted an exhibit about excavations done
in the last 10 years, when the river became a distinct department
within the city's Superintendency of Archaeology.
   Tourists walking along the river can see the excavation of a
three-level storehouse for jars of oil, wine and fish sauce left
dockside by barges at the ancient port near what is now Testaccio,
a blue-collar workers' neighborhood.
   ``In the past, the city lived on its river. Rome was a kind of
Venice, a Copenhagen, a London or a Paris,'' said Claudio
Mocchegiani Carpano, head of the city's underwater archaeology
department.
   ``A thousand years from now, when they dig up artifacts from the
20th century, they'll find out that the Tiber just ran through Rome
and served as a sewer,'' Carpano said.

"The Marriage of Figaro" and "The Barber of Seville." Seville is building an
opera house for these and other offerings. The new Teatro de la Maestranza is
supposed to be ready by May, with Spanish tenor Placido Domingo as operatic
director.;    And one of the most important collections of historical
documents in Europe is found here, the Indies Archives, housed in a building
near the cathedral. The collection -- with nearly 50,000 files -- includes
maps, charts and letters from Columbus, Magellan, Cortes and other great
Spanish explorers. One of the goals of the Spanish government this year and
next is to computerize the files.;    Tourists planning to stop in on the
world's fair will find rooms hard to come by. Emilio Casinello, who's in
charge of the Expo, says some visitors might have to stay two or three hours
outside of town, but there will be rooms for everyone.;    The fair runs from
April 20 to Oct. 12, and more than 100 countries are expected to participate.
The U.S. Congress has appropriated $13 million for the Seville fair and
another $1.5 million for another Columbus celebration to be held next summer
in Genoa, Italy.;    Monastery restored;  The Expo site -- La Cartuja island
in the Quadalquivar River -- covers about 530 acres. The 15th-century
monastery of Santa Maria de las Cuevas, once the only building on island, is
being restored, and its outer lodge will become a royal pavilion where King
Juan Carlos will receive visiting dignitaries. Columbus supposedly lived at
the monastery for eight years.;    The biggest foreign pavilions will be those
of Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany. Spain hopes the
Expo will attract about 20 million visitors during its six-month run, half of
those foreigners. Seville, the same size as San Jose, is the smallest city
ever to host a world's fair.;    Like Barcelona, Seville is a city under siege
by construction workers. Spanish government investment now totals about $1.5
billion on the actual Expo site, with $7 billion more being spent on roads,
rail and other infrastructure.;    Twenty new hotels are under way, and by
next spring, officials are forecasting a total of 75,000 beds (current hotel
capacity in Seville is about 10,000). Another 100,000 beds will be offered in
homes and apartments within an hour and a half of the city, and 600,000 more
beds are two and a half hours away on the Costa del Sol.;    Officials in
Seville say they plan to ask local citizens to rent out their extra bedrooms
as part of a bed-and-breakfast program. Information about such programs should
be available from the Spanish National Tourist Office in Beverly Hills, but
calls there often result in "we don't know" responses.;    New rail service; 
Also by next April, Spain hopes to begin high-speed rail service between
Madrid and Seville using trains that will cut the journey from six hours to
two hours and 45 minutes. The service, to be known as AVE, after its Spanish
name, Tren de Alta Velocidad Espa ola, will travel at up to 186 miles an hour.
There will be an AVE terminal at the Expo site.;    The high-speed trains will
have air-conditioned cars and a cafe car with telephones and a boutique.
Between 10 and 14 daily departures in each direction are planned, but
schedules and fares have yet to be announced. And work is proceeding on a new
airport terminal that is hoped to triple passenger capacity.;    Also next
year, an antique train, the Andalusian Express, will begin service that
includes a trip from Madrid to Seville on the AVE plus the train's normal
summer run from Seville to Cordoba, Granada and Malaga and back to Seville.;  
 The Expo might make or break Seville. Andalusia in general -- and Seville in
particular -- are in bad economic shape. Spanish officials hope the fair will
attract future investments to the city and the province -- hence the big money
being put into fixing up the infrastructure.;     IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; For
general information about Andalusia and the Seville region, contact the
Spanish National Tourist Office, 8383 Wilshire Blvd., No. 960, Beverly Hills
90211; (213) 658-7188. Among events planned for next year are:;    (check)
COLOMBO '92 -- Genoa, May 15-Aug. 15. Another Expo, this one concentrating on
maritime activities and on Columbus himself.;    (check) GRAND REGATTA
COLUMBUS '92 -- Puerto Rico, May-June 1992. A fleet of tall sailing ships and
hundreds of pleasure craft will sail from Cadiz and arrive at San Juan in May
1992. There will be events in San Juan June 10-14.;    (check) 1992 SUMMER
OLYMPICS -- Barcelona, July 25-Aug. 9, 1992. The games are dedicated to
Columbus.;     If you go . . .; (check) Expo Factos -- The 1992 world's fair
will stay open late -- probably 4 a.m. -- to cope with July temperatures that
often soar above 100 degrees. A one-day ticket is about $40 per person.;   
Visitors may enter and leave the site any time between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Pavilions will be open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. A night-time ticket for $10
will allow entry from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. Evening activities include a parade,
laser and fireworks display over the Expo lake, concerts, theater, dance
programs, cinema programs, discos and night clubs.;    Many attractions and
pavilions will focus on progress. Included among facilities on the island will
be a monorail to take visitors around the exhibition, and a cable car linking
the fair site with the city. Fair officials plan to plant 350,000 trees and
bushes and 30 miles of hedge to create a screen of vegetation against the
fierce heat.;    (check) COLUMBUS TRACKING -- If you want to see the Columbus
crypt, go to the vast Gothic cathedral in Seville, which holds the ornate tomb
built to hold Columbus' remains. The cathedral is said to be the third largest

FUERTEVENTURA: The Spanish poet Miguel de Unamuno described Fuerteventura as
'an oasis in the midst of the desert of civilisation' when he was exiled
there in 1924. Today, Fuerteventura can truly be described as one of the
'Fortunate Islands' in that it is relatively free of package tourists.
The islands are home to more than 3,000 members of the Spanish Foreign
Legion, whose reputation concedes nothing in toughness to that of their
French counterparts. The legion was originally based there with the purpose
of keeping an eye on King Hassan II of Morocco, who in the mid-1970s
successfully and peacefully invaded Spanish Sahara and recovered the
territory. The troops generally keep a low profile; the islanders do not
have a great love for them.
The second largest island of the group, at 1,725 sq km, Fuerteventura is a
desert-like place whose capital, Puerto del Rosario, is a stepping-stone for
the thousands who visit the island each year for its sun and sand. Pale
Europeans riding on camels, soaking up a touch of Africa, mingle with the
island's fishermen; Fuerteventura hosts some of the best of the Canaries'
fishing.
But although surrounded by water, the island still has to import much of its
drinking water from mainland Spain. Rainfall generally comes to the island
only once a year in a downpour which may last only one night.
Mass tourism has not yet defaced Fuerteventura as it has some of the other
islands; there are only 14,000 beds available to tourists on the whole
island, a small proportion of the Canaries' total.
That will change by the end of this year, when the Pounds 200m, 62 acre
Puerto Ventura project and a 9,000 bed hotel complex opens. A village
complex of hotels, apartments and entertainments, the development is a Swiss
project by a Zurich based company, Alpha Generalunternehmung. The man behind
the scheme, Mr Werner Bleiker, has convinced the Canarian authorities that
his village will offer Swiss quality with Spanish culture.
LANZAROTE: The volcanic arid island of Lanzarote (795 sq km, population
54,000) has become irrevocably linked in the minds of millions with cheap
package holidays - the 'lanzagrotty' of down market sun-worshipping. Not for
nothing has the island developed the myth - which may be true - that two BBC
television executives dreamed up the soap opera 'Eastenders' while taking in
the sun on Lanzarote; some 600,000 tourists come to the island each year.
That does an injustice to the island's natural beauty and scenic
attractions. But the bad image of the island has much to do with the
down-at-heel appearance of the principal town, Arrecife. The wise traveller
leaves Arrecife as soon as possible and heads off for places such as the
Timanfaya National Park, a reserve which is doing its best to maintain in an
unspoilt condition one of the world's youngest volcanic landscapes - the
last eruptions were in the early 18th century, and covered a quarter of the
island's most fertile land in a layer of lava between 6 and 10 metres deep.
The heat generated is such that bushes still spontaneously combust and
potatoes can be cooked by burying them just beneath the earth's surface.
GRAN CANARIA: With 700,000 people living and covering an area of 1,533 sq km
(making it the third largest island in the group), Gran Canaria is both the
seat of government for the autonomous region and the most popular tourist
destination within the islands. Its capital, Las Palmas, is both a major
port and the centre of one of the island's most famous resorts, Las
Canteras. But the Playa del Ingles and Maspalomas are equally well-known
among the hundreds of thousands of British, German and Scandinavian
tourists.
Gran Canaria has been pillaged for tourist attractions, its coastline
littered with ugly and badly designed mass-market resorts. Las Palmas
retains an authenticity lacking in many of the ready-mixed resorts, thanks
to its necessarily retaining all the functions of a working capital.
Las Palmas was used by General Franco as his launching post for the 1936
Spanish revolution against the Republican government, which had exiled him
to the islands following suspicion that he had been plotting a coup d'etat.
Local wits say that the Canaries have only committed two errors; the first
was to prevent Nelson winning the battle of Tenerife, the second, allowing
Franco to leave.

   Bid for World Fame by Memphis, Tenn.,
   Stalls as Pyramid Stands Almost Empty

   When promoter Sidney Shlenker first dropped into Memphis,
Tenn., officials were elated. Mr. Shlenker held out hopes of
making a world-class tourist attraction out of the city's
proposed Great American Pyramid, a sports arena to be shaped
like the famous pyramids near the Egyptian city that is
Memphis' namesake.
   But this week, the city and county mayors said they were
terminating Mr. Shlenker's Pyramid contracts when he failed,
after 26 months, to come up with $80 million in financing for
the project.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now, Memphis is left with a cavernous 32-story pyramid,
just north of its downtown, that's all but vacant except for
a basketball arena. It is the latest in a series of troubled
downtown projects designed to make tourists think of Memphis
as more than just Elvis Presley's hometown.
   The mayors' action involves two contracts between the
local governments and Mr. Shlenker's firm, Pyramid Cos. Under
the agreements, Pyramid was to manage the sports area and to
develop a host of other music and sports attractions that
would fill the facility. A separate contract, which remains
in effect, gave Mr. Shlenker management rights to Mud Island,
the city's Mississippi River theme park.
   Yesterday, Mr. Shlenker wasn't available for comment and a
secretary said that he wasn't talking to the press.
   The demise of Mr. Shlenker's project is just the latest
disappointment to Memphis' economic-development efforts.
After a decade of expansion, the city suffered a severe blow
in April when Holiday Inn, a major employer and long a source
of local pride, said it would move its headquarters to
Atlanta.
   In addition, two smaller manufacturing operations closed
their plants, and the city recently lost a bid to get NWA
Inc.'s Northwest Airlines' new maintenance hub. These losses
"have shaken people's confidence in the real successes of the
1980s," said David Ciscel, an economics professor at Memphis
State University.
   Still, while setbacks with the Pyramid may leave Memphis
with egg on its face, they shouldn't give the city any
serious budget problems. While many cities are having budget
troubles these days, Memphis isn't. Memphis will end the year
with a budget surplus, according to Mayor Richard Hackett.
"We've had 75 consecutive months of economic growth," he
said.
   Mr. Shlenker, a former majority owner of the Denver
Nuggets basketball team, wowed city officials with brash
gimmicks. For his initial sales pitch, he brought along a
magician who made a model of the Pyramid disappear, and he
had a 600-pound shovel delivered by helicopter for the
groundbreaking ceremony.
   Mr. Shlenker also produced studies that said the Pyramid
could bring in as many as three million visitors annually and
even compared the project to France's Eiffel Tower and the
Statue of Liberty in New York harbor.
   But Mr. Shlenker's prospective lenders clearly didn't
share his enthusiasm. For more than two years, he tried
unsuccessfullly to obtain construction financing to build the
inside of the Pyramid -- a collegiate football hall of fame,
a Hard Rock cafe, a museum-like "Egyptian Experience," among
other things. Finally, local government officials lost their
patience.
   Despite these setbacks, the city and county plan to open
the sports arena this fall as scheduled and they say they
will find another private management company to develop other
amenities at The Pyramid. "The city and county are moving
right along with our part of the project," said county Mayor
Bill Morris.
   Mayor Morris said that the departure of Mr. Shlenker
wouldn't affect local government's ability to meet its
obligations on the bonds issued to finance the sports arena.
The city and county issued $55 million in bonds, split evenly
between them, to finance the basketball arena.
   While city officials say they intended all along to pay
the $3 million annual bond obligations out of the general
budget, that is also how much they expected to collect from
Mr. Schlenker's ventures.
   Now, many in Memphis believe that The Pyramid is almost
certain to be developed on a far more modest scale than
originally planned, and its potential to draw tourists may be
diminished. The Pyramid is "not something that will make
money the way a business makes money," said Prof. Ciscel. "We
will pay for it with our taxes for decades to come."

Who Will Save the St. Bernard?
---
</HL>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<DATELINE> Bourg St. Bernard, Switzerland  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
    It's homecoming day for
Neena. After hours of uphill hiking, the six-year-old Saint
Bernard and her German master, Ralf Lauguer, have reached the
Hospice of Saint Bernard, a remote monastery near the
Swiss-Italian border. It was here, centuries ago, that monks
dabbling in doggy genetics developed Neena's ancestors and
bestowed their name on her breed.
   For more than 900 years, the hospice has stood here perched near the roof of Europe, its mission to guide mountain travelers over an ancient 8,000-foot-high pass through the Alps. 
And it was along these icy stretches of avalanche-prone mountains, countless tales hold, that man's best friend, brandy barrel at the ready, selflessly sprang through dark nights and raging blizzards to rescue hundreds of lost travelers from a frozen death. 

   In Switzerland the Saint Bernard holds the unofficial status of national beast. 
Parisians erected a statue to Barry, the most famous of these Alpine heroes, so that he might watch over the fallen at the city's pet cemetery. 
He now stands stuffed in a Berne museum. 
And Hollywood provided those ghostly booze-hounds George and Marion Kirby with a Saint Bernard in the television series version of "Topper." 

   There is no romance at all hovering about the Saint Bernard's home ground. 
The hospice is a drab, utilitarian four-story building that once served as a seminary and is now home to four black-frocked priests of the Congregation of Saint Bernard, part of the order of St. Augustine. 
Local points of interest include nearby Death Mountain and the hospice's morgue, once its main tourist attraction, where the bodies of 300 unfortunates lost to the elements reside in a state of permafrost. 

   During the five brief months each year when the soaring roads to the monastery are freed of snow, thousands of Saint Bernard lovers flock here to see the dogs at their source. 
Some tourists leave happy. 
A few visitors pay about $1,400 to buy a puppy. 
Others, such as Neena's owner Mr. Lauguer, experience shock, when they learn the only Saint Bernards on display here are those kept within cages in an indoor zoo. 
Admission: about $2. 

   "I'm not going in there," snarls Mr. Lauguer, "These dogs ought to be outside running free." 

   The good brothers of Saint Bernard probably couldn't agree more. 
Indeed, some say they are feverishly awaiting deliverance from the dogs, their fans, and every shaggy-dog story that surrounds the breed. 
"If the dogs are gone tomorrow, I wouldn't shed any tears," says Jean-Michel Girard, the hospice's director for the past seven years. 

   Legends die hard, particularly when they are soft and fluffy. 
But to hear Mr. Girard tell it, these fabled Alpine heroes are about as handy as the neighborhood poodle when it comes to sniffing out an avalanche-entombed skier. 
And though the household Saint Bernard may be a gentle soul, its mountain cousin retains some rustic qualities, such as the admirable urge to attack anything wearing a fur coat, including humans. 

   The hospice's dog zoo is also causing it image problems. 
A German newspaper, for example, recently accused it of running a canine concentration camp. 

   The dogs, which spend most of the day sleeping, are indifferent to the squabble. 
When the area roads are closed, they are shipped south to warmer quarters in a nearby valley town. 
The hospice's priests and staff traditionally celebrate the seven-month holiday from dogs and tourists with a feast. 
Skis and climbing gear come out of the closet and the monastery then operates as a religious winter sports resort. 

   It isn't exactly known when the dogs first appeared on the scene. 
Several authorities put the date around 1700. 
The dog's racial origins are also shrouded in mystery though these same experts speculate that a local mutt was merged with a mastiff, Great Dane or Newfoundland. 
The idea was to create a canine steamroller to pack down the snow. 

   Local mountain guides were hired by the monastery to do the dangerous work, walking area trails daily to search for the lost and carry food for the hungry. 
A Saint Bernard went along. 
When the dog smelled something unusual, it barked. 

   Since lost wayfarers heard or saw the dogs first, the pooches got all the credit. 
The brandy barrels never existed except in the fervid imagination of romantic 18th-century artists. 
Nor did any Saint Bernard, except perhaps a deranged critter, ever voluntarily venture away from the monastery's comforts. 

   By the beginning of the 20th century, the development of modern skis made the Saint Bernard's snow-trampling skills obsolete. 
And as travel by foot yielded to the tour bus, the hospice's practical mission also lost its urgency. 

   The dogs' confinement here began in the early 1930s, when several Saint Bernards mauled and killed an area child. 
By the 1950s, the hospice's elders were poised to drop the animals but opted instead to create a tourist attraction. 
The zoo-type arrangement is needed to protect both man and beast, Mr. Girard says. 
The dogs are thrown into a frenzy not only by fur coats, but also by the sight of the small replicas of themselves sold in local gift shops. 

   Financially, the dogs remain a success, raising about 30% of the hospice's budget. 
Yet, much as the captive dogs, the hospice also remains a prisoner to the breed's myth, Mr. Girard believes. 
His first lesson here as a seminary student, the priest recalls, was to memorize foreign phrases directing tourists to the dogs' cages. 

   Mr. Girard would like to change that. 
Unlike some of his predecessors, the priest abstains from being photographed with the dogs while wearing his religious garb. 
A new $600,000 museum will also open here next month. 
Its aim: To emphasize the hospice's role as a house of refuge for mankind's physical and spiritual needs. 

   It's a role the hospice must begin to serve again, the priest believes, if it is to outlive its canine connection. 
Says Mr. Girard: "I don't want to spend the rest of my life showing dogs to tourists."

<TEXT>
   Six months after the Leaning Tower was closed
to the public, work to keep it from toppling has yet to begin and
the mayor of the tourist-abandoned city is appealing to Rome for
help.
   The tower's 293 steps to the top were last climbed on Jan. 7,
when the mayor reluctantly locked the wooden doors to the 180-foot
tower with a steel key and expressed hope work would begun soon so
the monument can reopen.
   Since then, the mayor's office has a new occupant and the city
has been losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in entrance fees _
the monument attracts some 800,000 tourists a year who pay $3.35
apiece to climb the spiral staircase for a disorientating view of
the Tuscan city.
   Some tourists, of course, still pass through Pisa, but with the
tower closed, the city is less appealing.
   Newly elected Mayor Sergio Cortopassi said he's appealing to
Premier Giulio Andreotti in hopes of spurring a quick start to
work, Italian newspapers reported Sunday.
   The reports said Cortopassi wants the government to convene a
meeting on the situation in the next two weeks.
   Cortopassi's predecessor signed a order in December authorizing
closure, but experts have yet to get moving on a plan to stop the
tower from leaning further. Parliament hasn't yet appropriated the
$400 million experts estimate the work will cost.
   The tower began to lean almost immediately after Bonnano Pisano
began work on it in 1173; the ground beneath it shifted. It now
leans some 13 feet off perpendicular.
   At least once a year, Italian experts announce new findings that
the tower has leaned some more, usually a couple a millimeters. At
this rate, the tower will eventually topple, experts say, but even
without intervention, it should stand at least 100 years.
   One plan under consideration calls for a wheel-shaped support to
be planted around the base of the tower and connected by spokes to
the marble foundation. Although experts disagree on which is the
best strategy, all say the tower must keep its famous lean.

Usually when travelers arrive in a foreign city, one of the first orders of 
business is to sign up for the nearest sightseeing tour. 
</P>
<P>
But commercial bus tours have many disadvantages. Not only are they often very 
expensive, but on a scheduled sightseeing tour, there is no flexibility. 
Instead, you're on a strict timetable. 
</P>
<P>
One might want to stay to gaze a bit longer at a world-famous painting, or 
remain in a botanical garden for a few extra minutes amid the blossoms. Maybe 
it's just not possible to "do" a museum in half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Generally it's "On the bus, off the bus. Snap some pictures and away we go. 
Fifteen minutes. Don't be late. We have a lot more to see." 
</P>
<P>
And much of the so-called sightseeing is through a bus window at 30 m.p.h. "On 
the right you see beautiful old houses . . . on your left is a statue of King . 
. . in a minute we will come to the Olympic stadium where the games were played 
in . . . " 
</P>
<P>
There's an alternative here that doesn't have all of those drawbacks.

Tourists to this Danish capital can sightsee, but at their own pace. And it's 
much, much cheaper, leaving money over to buy statues of the Little Mermaid or 
a set of Royal Copenhagen vases. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Copenhagen operates buses -- the same kind used by residents -- for 
sightseers. Starting at the city hall (stop No. 1) the buses make continuous 
loops of the city. 
</P>
<P>
There are nine additional stops at which tourists can jump off and hop back on 
the buses. 
</P>
<P>
Drivers are very courteous and especially aware that their passengers are 
unfamiliar with their surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
The stop-off points are at the city's most interesting and popular attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Jump off at the world-famous Tivoli Gardens (stop No. 2), with its amusement 
rides and restaurants. A visit there might take a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
Check your watch. Another bus always will come by in exactly 30 minutes. Other 
stops include the Amalienborg Palace (stop No. 5), where the royal family has 
resided since 1794 and the beautiful Amalievhaven Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Another attraction at this stop, just a short walk away, is Den Lille Havfrue, 
the famed Statue of the Little Mermaid. Copenhagan has a statue on every block. 
The Little Mermaid is Denmark's most well-known one. 
</P>
<P>
Other stops include the Danish Resistance Museum illustrating Denmark's fight 
for freedom between 1940 and 1945 (stop No. 7). 
</P>
<P>
The Rosenborg Castle (stop No. 9), one of Copenhagen's most beautiful castles 
and located in King's Gardens, contains the Crown Jewels and the Royal Family's 
most precious objects collected for more than 500 years. 
</P>
<P>
At the same stop is the Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Demmark's National Gallery, 
with Danish and international art from the 13th Century to the present. 
</P>
<P>
Buses also stop near the Botanical Gardens (stop No. 10), The Royale Theatre 
(stop No. 5) and The national Museum (Stop No. 3). The buses run every half 
hour between 10:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. seven days a week between mid-June and 
the beginning of September. Explanatory guides are available on the buses in 
Danish, English and German. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are good for 24 hour periods and cost 20 Danish kroner, or about $3.50 
U.S. for adults and half-price for children.

<HEAD>Strike Closes Paris' Most Popular Tourist Attraction</HEAD>

   Museum security workers turned away busloads of
visitors from the Pompidou art center Tuesday for the 13th day,
demanding Paris' most popular tourist attraction provide more jobs,
higher wages and better benefits.
   About 1,200 employees working in other departments of the
multifaceted center went on a 24-hour strike today in solidarity
with the security workers.
   Helene Ahrweiler, the center's new director, said their demands
are ``trifling matters.'' She was more concerned about cutting
costs, and said she is canceling a $1 million Andy Warhol
retrospective.
   Defiant guards turned away thousands of European tourists on
spring vacations who flooded the city.
   ``You can't come in. Can't you read the signs? We're on
strike,'' said one guard at the 12-year-old center.
   The Georges Pompidou center tops the Eiffel Tower as the
capital's most popular attraction.
   Mrs. Ahrweiler said she wants to find a global solution to
personnel problems.
   ``I'm the president of the whole center, and I want to avoid the
isolation of the various departments,'' she said in a telephone
interview.
   She was to meet today with Culture Minister Jack Lang to discuss
``the status, career development and salary policies of all museum
workers.''
   The center, built in 1977 to accommodate 5,000 visitors a day,
now welcomes five times that number.
   Mrs. Ahrweiler said she would make changes in management and
cancel shows to cut costs.
   ``We can make substantial savings,'' she said. ``I'm stopping
the Andy Warhol retrospective.''
   The restrospective, organized by and now displayed at the Museum
of Modern Art in New York, was to run in 1990 and cost the Pompidou
Center nearly $1 million.

   No sleeping on the Spanish Steps or foot-soaking in
the square's Bernini fountain, the city has decreed in an effort to
keep bright the image of Rome's famed tourist area.
   The Committee for Order and Public Safety also warned that a law
forbidding wearing bathing suits or revealing clothing will be
strictly enforced.
   This week's action came in response to demands by the area's
merchants and residents following an increase in the past month in
vagrancy, purse snatchings, drug dealing and attempted rapes.
   The mayor's office also promised 24-hour police patrols, better
lighting and more street sweepers.
   The fountain at the foot of the steps is a favorite of tourists,
who like to sit soaking their aching feet in the boat-shaped basin.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - It sounds like something Disney would do, build
replicas of the tombs of Egyptian pharaohs for the tourists to look
at. But the people responsible for preserving Egypt's antiquities
say they have little choice. The real tombs are deteriorating
rapidly in the crush of the tourist flow. To close them would mean
losing the tourist trade.

   Egypt's pharaohs built their tombs to last
an eternity. But some of the most magnificent of the royal resting
places may not make it much past the 20th century.
   A main spoiler is man.
   Drawn by ancient Egypt's aura of mystery, thousands of visitors
parade every day through the once off-limits world of dead pharaohs
and their queens. They violate tomb chambers designed by ancient
priests for one mummy-filled coffin.
   With that in mind, a Swiss group has come up with a
multimillion-dollar answer: Custom-built tombs, clustered in a new
``valley of death,'' especially groomed to accommodate mass
tourism.
   Give the tourists what they've come to see, but in facsimile.
   ``If you want to have your tourists and save your tombs,
building replicas is the only answer,'' says Theodor Abt, president
of the Zurich-based Society of Friends of the Royal Tombs of Egypt.
   ``We haven't a minute to lose,'' he says. ``Each time I come I'm
shocked to see what has happened. The world can't afford to give up
something so unique and precious.''
   Egyptian officials agree. In March they approved a proposal from
the society to duplicate two tombs: the tiny, gold-painted chamber
of the boy Pharaoh Tutankhamen, and the larger, beautifully
decorated tomb of Nefertari, powerful chief queen of warrior
Pharaoh Ramses II.
   They are among more than 400 tombs stretching for five miles
along the Nile River's western bank opposite ancient Thebes, now
Luxor, 450 miles south of Cairo.
   Saving both tombs has been a great worry for antiquities
officials.
   ``It's a wonderful project, the answer we've been searching
for,'' says Sayed Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities
Organization. ``Now we can save our tombs without depriving our
tourists of their beauty.
   ``And if we have to close one or more of them for restoration
and conservation, we won't feel so bad about it.''
   Tawfik says tourists still will be allowed in the original
tombs, but he expects the replicas ``to deflect masses away from
endangered ones.''
   Not even Egypt's mightiest kings foresaw that their secret
burial chambers, carved in valleys so desolate they were unfit for
the living, one day would attract a tourist boom of monumental
proportions.
   But they do. Each day 3,000 to 5,000 people crowd the land of
the dead, even in the horrendous heat of Upper Egypt's summer.
Humidity, dust and salt brought into the tombs by sweaty bodies and
the touch of countless fingers are eating away at the timeless but
fragile decorations on their walls.
   The only sure way to save them would be politically and
economically explosive: bar tour groups from the most popular
tombs. Most visitors travel in groups, carried across the Nile by
special launch and bused to the various valleys of death. Only
about two dozen tombs are open to the public at any one time.
   Permanently closing the tombs is an option that's hardly figured
in years of debate over monument conservation because of a national
push to bring ever more tourists into Egypt.
   Some 2 million visitors now pump $2 billion a year into Egypt's
dollar-starved economy. The government predicts the number of
tourists will double within the next few years.
   For antiquities officials, whose job is to protect relics,
copying the best and most endangered tombs offers an acceptable
alternative to locking doors. It leaves room for tourist expansion.
   Also, the replicas will be tombs with a difference. Tourists
will see them as the ancients did, not the faded and damaged
chambers visited today. And with modern touches: one-way traffic
and air conditioning.
   Abt, a Zurich psychoanalyst, says engineers have selected the
bone-dry, fault-filled Western Valley for the reproductions, lying
just over the hills from the tombs of Tutankhamen and fellow
pharaohs.
   The Western Valley was chosen because of ``its beauty and
emptiness. The sacred atmosphere so important to early tomb
builders is something we don't have to duplicate,'' Abt says.
``It's already there.''
   The West Bank's most popular tourist spot is the Valley of the
Kings, where New Kingdom rulers were buried for 500 years.
   But ancient architects originally gave the royal nod to the
Western Valley, where they placed the mummy of pharaoh Amenophis
III in 1353 B.C. The area later was abandoned in favor of valleys
to the east and south.
   Abt says plans call for the first cluster of duplicate tombs to
include, in addition to Tutankhamen's and Nefertari's, those of the
warrior Pharaoh Tuthmosis III and two non-royals, Sennedjem, a
court official, and labor foreman Inherkhau.
   He estimates each cluster will cost as much as $80 million,
raised in a campaign like the 1960s UNESCO drive that saved the
monuments of Abu Simbel and other Nubian sites south of Luxor.
   Abt says duplicate tombs will be low-slung, built to disguise
their locations and decorated by Egyptians using techniques of the
ancients. Originally, tombs were dug into the landscape to hide
them from would-be robbers after the riches accompanying the dead
pharaoh into the afterlife.
   ``Each cluster will be built against the mountains and covered
with rocks to give the same feeling of antiquity as the ancient
tombs,'' Abt says.
   To ensure that each tomb will be correct historically, the Swiss
group's 50 international members include as vice president an
authority on the West Bank burial grounds, Basel professor Erik
Hornung.
   While new in Egypt, building replicas to save antiquities is not
a new concept.
   French officials closed the Lescaux Caves near Montignac in 1963
after 100,000 visitors surged in the previous year to see the
monuments' prehistoric paintings. In 1983 a facsimile was opened,
which today awes 400,000 visitors annually.
   Spain currently is seeking money to reproduce 12,000-year-old
wall paintings of bison and horses at its Altamira Caves. The
tourist crush in the main cave became so great in 1982 that it too
had to be closed.
