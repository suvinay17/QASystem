<HEAD>Number of Cases of Skin Cancer Leveling Off After Sharp Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After decades of soaring rates of skin cancer _
largely because of suntanning _ Americans finally may be wising up
to the dangers of the bronzed look, a medical researcher says.
   Rates of malignant melanoma, the most deadly form of skin
cancer, appeared to start leveling off in 1988, after 27 years of
steep rises, said Dr. Andrew Glass of Kaiser Permanente's Center
for Health Research in Portland, Ore.
   ``It's going to take some more time to follow that along,''
Glass said in a telephone interview Thursday. But early figures
from the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., appear to
indicate a similar leveling off, he said.
   Glass' remarks came after he reported on a long-term tracking of
300,000 members of the Kaiser Permanente prepaid health plan in the
Portland, Ore., and Vancouver, Wash., areas.
   Researchers found that from 1960 to 1987, annual cases of a type
of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma increased 2.6 times
in men and 3.1 times in women.
   Squamous cell carcinoma is one of the commonest skin cancers,
occurring in thousands of people each year. Usually starting as a
scaly patch on the lip, ear or hand, it grows, spreads and even
causes death if untreated.
   ``Squamous cell skin cancer clearly seems to be related to skin
exposure _ it is more common among fair-skinned individuals,
especially those with frequent or long-term exposure to sunlight,''
said a report by Glass and Dr. Robert N. Hoover of the National
Cancer Institute.
   Their findings represent the first systematic report over time
of squamous cell skin cancer, they said.
   The researchers also looked at melanoma, and found its incidence
rose 3.5-fold and 4.6-fold among men and women, respectively,
during the same 27-year period.
   Greater exposure to sunlight is only one of many factors
believed to have contributed to the increased rates of melanoma,
the researchers said in their report in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   But the occurrence of melanomas on the body's trunk rose much
faster than cancers involving the head and neck or the extremities,
the researchers said.
   ``These observations are consistent with the impression that the
rising incidence of both malignancies may be attributable to
increased voluntary exposure to the sun,'' said the researchers.
   Malignant melanoma, which often starts in an existing mole that
becomes enlarged, is the kind of cancer most likely to spread and
kill.
   Researchers found 2,453 cases of invasive skin cancers among
members of the health plan.
   The American Cancer Society has estimated that half of all
people who live to age 65 will have skin cancer at some point in
their lives and predicted malignant melanoma will kill 6,000 people
this year.
   ``As individuals and as a society, it is only prudent to take
precautions to save our skins,'' said an editorial in the journal
by Dr. Martin A. Weinstock of Brown University in Providence, R.I.
   He called for preservation of the earth's ozone layer, which
blocks harmful ultraviolet radiation, and early detection and
treatment of skin cancers, as well as increased public awareness
and use of sunscreens.

<HEAD>Acne Drug Prevents Skin Cancer in People at High Risk</HEAD>

   The acne drug Accutane, which can cause birth
defects in pregnant women, prevents skin cancer in people at
extremely high risk of the common malignancy, a study concludes.
   Experts cautioned that the treatment is too toxic to be used
routinely by most people who are afraid of skin cancer. But they
said it raises the possibility that similar drugs may someday be
given safely to prevent this and other forms of cancer.
   Until now, medicines have been given almost exclusively to
attack cancers once they occur rather than to prevent them.
   ``This is the first study that has scientifically proven in
humans that skin cancer can be prevented by any means,'' said Dr.
Howard Koh of Boston University School of Medicine. ``We use sun
screens because they should work, but we still have not rigorously
proven in a scientific way that skin cancer can be prevented with
that method.'' Sun is considered the main cause of skin cancer.
   However, he cautioned that the study, conducted on just five
people, is very small, and it is unclear whether the findings will
apply to those at lower risk of skin cancer.
   Dr. Kenneth H. Kraemer, who directed the research at the
National Cancer Institute, believes the study could represent a
step toward cancer prevention.
   He noted that Accutane is one of more than 2,000 synthetic forms
of vitamin A, and some of these could prove safe and effective for
routine use in warding off skin cancer in low-risk people.
   ``You are better off preventing it by avoiding the sun at the
beginning,'' Kraemer said. ``But if that isn't the case, this is an
indication that drugs may be developed to prevent the progression
of the damage to cancer.''
   The study was conducted on victims of xeroderma pigmentosum, an
inherited skin disorder that occurs in about one in 1 million
people. Their skin is unable to repair genetic damage caused by
sunlight, and they are more than 1,000 times more likely than the
average to get basal cell or squamous cell cancer of the skin.
   In the general population, these are the most common kinds of
cancer, striking about 500,000 people in the United States each
year. These tumors, which are usually curable, occur most
frequently in light-skinned people.
   In the study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, five patients took high doses of Accutane for two years.
   Doctors compared the number of tumors before, during and after
treatment. In the two years before taking Accutane, the five
patients had a total of 121 tumors. While on the drug, they had 25.
When the drug was stopped, they had nearly a nine-fold increase in
the frequency of tumors.
   But side effects caused two people of the seven who started in
the study to drop out. One had high levels of blood fats, while the
other showed signs of liver abnormalities.
   The researchers currently are checking to see if a dose
one-quarter as large will work as well but be less hazardous.
   Kraemer said high doses of Accutane could be warranted for some
people, such as sailors and farmers, who have frequent skin cancers
because of their lifelong exposure to the sun.
   Accutane, known generically as isotretinoin, is already widely
used to treat severe acne. Because of its possible danger for
pregnant women, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last month
ordered its maker, Hoffman-La Roche, to warn customers by printing
a picture of a deformed baby on the drug's packaging.
   At least two other studies using Accutane to treat pre-cancerous
ailments have been published over the last two years. One showed
that the drug clears up oral leukoplakia, pre-cancerous white
patches in the mouth that are common among smokers. The other found
that it improved the survival of people with myelodysplastic
syndrome, a pre-leukemic disorder.
   Some experts also believe that beta carotene, the form of
vitamin A found in food, helps prevent cancer.
   Dr. Harley Haynes of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston said
that vitamin A drugs similar to Accutane may someday be used to
treat other tumors of epithelial tissue, such as cancers of the
lung, stomach, colon, bladder, cervix and breast.

   A study published today shows that the acne
medicine Accutane is the first treatment known to prevent skin
cancer in humans, but scientists caution the drug is too toxic for
routine use.
   Accutane, a vitamin A derivative that can cause birth defects in
pregnant women, sharply reduced skin cancer in a small group of
people who were at extremely high risk because of an inherited
genetic disorder, the study shows.
   While Accutane cannot be taken for long periods by most people,
other synthetic forms of vitamin A may someday be routinely used to
prevent skin cancer in people whose skin has been damaged by years
of exposure to the sun, the researchers said.
   In addition, vitamin A drugs may someday be used to treat other
tumors of epithelial tissue, such as cancers of the lung, stomach,
colon, bladder, cervix and breast, said Dr. Harley Haynes of
Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
   ``The odds are that within the lifetime of many people, we may
well be able to develop treatments that reduce the risk of cancer
in high-risk people,'' he said.
   The treatment is an example of the young field of
chemoprevention. Until now, medicines have been given almost
exclusively to attack cancers once they occur rather than to
prevent them from forming.
   ``This is the first study that has scientifically proven in
humans that skin cancer can be prevented by any means,'' said Dr.
Howard Koh of the Boston University School of Medicine. ``We use
sun screens because they should work, but we still have not
rigorously proven in a scientific way that skin cancer can be

people, is very small, and it is unclear whether the findings will
apply to those at lower risk of skin cancer.
   The study was directed by Dr. Kenneth H. Kraemer at the National
Cancer Institute and published in the New England Journal of
Medicine.
   About 500,000 Americans are treated each year for basal cell and
squamous cell skin cancer, the most common forms of cancer. These
tumors, which are usually curable, occur most frequently in
light-skinned people exposed to too much sun.
   ``You are better off preventing it by avoiding the sun at the
beginning,'' said Kraemer. ``But if that isn't the case, this is an
indication that drugs may be developed to prevent the progression
of the damage to cancer.''
   Accutane, known generically as isotretinoin, is widely used to
clear up severe acne. Because of its possible danger for pregnant
women, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last month ordered its
maker, Hoffman-La Roche, to warn customers by printing a picture of

   Kraemer said that high doses of Accutane may be warranted for
some people who have frequent skin cancers because of their
lifelong exposure to the sun, ``but for the general population,
it's much too toxic.''
   More than 2,000 similar vitamin A compounds already exist, and
some of them may be safe and effective enough to protect ordinary
people from skin cancers, scientists say.

   The message today is simple: BEWARE THE
SUMMER SUN!
   Too many people, especially older people, become needlessly ill
because they fail to recognize the potential dangers of the sun and
its heat. However, the two great dangers, heatstroke and skin
cancer, are largely preventable.
   Symptoms of heatstroke occur almost instantly and can be
immediately fatal, while skin cancer develops years after exposure
to the sun's rays.
   If you must be exposed to the heat, drink plenty of water or
fruit and vegetable juice, even if you aren't thirsty. Avoid
alcohol and caffeine. Dress in light-weight, light-colored, loose
clothes. Limit activity in the hottest part of the day and keep
meals simple and light. If they are available, use air conditioners
liberally. Trips to cool places are good alternatives.
   If you are a relative, friend, or neighbor of a person who is
unable to get around you may want to offer transportation.
   Older people are especially vulnerable to heat-related
illnesses. Changes in the body that may affect ability to cope with
heat include inefficient sweat glands, poor circulation and changes
in the skin. Also, some older people have illnesses that cause
weakness or fever which, in turn, affect their ability to cope with
heat. Heart, lung, and kidney diseases are good examples.
   Diseases requiring special diets also may make a person more
vulnerable to heatstroke. People with high blood pressure, for
example, reduce the amount of salt in their diets. Yet this
reduction may increase the risk of heat stress. (A word of caution
_ salt should not be increased nor salt supplements taken without
consent from a physician.)
   Medications like diuretics, sedatives, tranquilizers and certain
heart and blood-pressure drugs may contribute to a body's inability
to regulate internal temperature. But never stop medication or
change a recommended diet without consulting a doctor. Unusually
heavy or underweight people also are at risk, as are those who
drink alcoholic beverages regularly.
   Anyone suspected of suffering a heat-related illness should
receive attention. Victims of heatstroke exhibit a body temperature
of 104 degrees or higher. The pulse may be rapid. Other symptoms
include flushed skin, a faint feeling, confused and bizarre
behavior and combativeness. These symptoms require immediate
emergency medical assistance.
   Heat fatigue and heat exhaustion are milder forms of heat
stress. Should you suspect either illness look for giddiness,
nausea, profuse sweating, and a cold and clammy feeling and take
steps to prevent the condition from worsening.
   First, and perhaps most obvious, the person needs to get out of
the sun and into a cool, preferably air-conditioned place.
Encourage sponging off with cool water or taking a cool bath or
shower and non-alcoholic, non-caffeinated drink.
   Another serious danger associated with the sun and aging is skin
cancer.
   Whether you are 15 or 50 your skin is accumulating sun damage,
including wrinkling, various growths and skin cancers and change in
texture. By following some easy sun-safety tips many skin cancers
can be prevented.
   Don't sunbathe too long. Try to limit exposure between 10 a.m.
and 3 p.m. and get used to the sun gradually. Wear a hat,
long-sleeved shirt, and W-rated (ultraviolet) sunglasses. Use
sunscreens liberally and apply them at least one hour before going
out. Reapply after swimming or sweating. Sunscreens are effective
at SPF (sun protection factor) 15.
   Prolonged exposure to the sun can cause skin cancer. The most
common forms are basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and
malignant melanoma.
   Basal cell carcinomas are the most common and rarely harmful to
vital organs. Squamous cell carcinomas are less common but are
potentially harmful because they can grow quickly and spread to
other organs. Malignant melanomas often look like dark, irregular
moles. They can be deadly.
   If you suspect skin cancer see a doctor. Warning signs include a
new mole-type spot or changes in color, size, shape or texture of
an existing one. With early detection and prompt treatment, many
skin cancers can be cured. Even if you have had a benign cancer you
must guard against the dangers of the sun.
   With good, sound judgment and a knowledge of preventive measures
the hot summer months can be safe and fun for everyone.

Cancerous Lesion
On Reagan's Nose</HL>

<TEXT>
   A lesion removed from President Reagan's nose this week has been found to be cancerous, and the president is to enter Bethesda Naval Medical Center this afternoon to have more tissue removed, the White House said. 

   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said a biopsy on the lesion removed Wednesday in the White House physician's office revealed that it contained basal cell epithelioma, a form of skin cancer. 
Mr. Fitzwater said the skin cancer is the same type found on President Reagan's nose in 1985. 
Mr. Reagan twice had cancerous cells removed from his nose that year. 

   Today's procedure, scheduled for late afternoon, will be performed under local anesthesia. 
Mr. Fitzwater said it won't be known until afterward whether Mr. Reagan would remain in the hospital overnight. 

   The president will enter the hospital for the latest procedure because "there's a possibility they will have to go slightly deeper" than in past procedures, Mr. Fitzwater said. 
He added that a team of three doctors, led by Col. John Hutton Jr., the White House physician, will be on hand for the procedure. 

   Mr. Reagan gave a speech to a group of right-to-life advocates shortly after he received results of the biopsy yesterday. 
He was wearing a small bandage on his nose, but his performance didn't seem affected. 

   Mr. Reagan also had colon cancer in 1985 and underwent major surgery that year to have it removed. 
He has received regular checkups since then to be sure there isn't a recurrence of colon cancer. 

   The recurrent skin problem plaguing Mr. Reagan is the most common, least dangerous form of skin cancer. 
The basal cell cancer is diagnosed in about 400,000 cases each year in the U.S. and results from long-term exposure to strong sunlight. 
Unlike two other types of skin cancer, called squamous cell and malignant melanoma, basal cell cancer is rarely life-threatening, nor does it spread to other parts of the body. 

   Doctors who treat such problems said it is common for them to recur in close proximity since much of the skin in an affected area probably received severe sun damage. 
They said that the most common procedure is a simple excision of the skin. 
However, Dr. Arthur Balin, a research dermatologist at Rockefeller University, New York, said recurrent problems sometimes are excised in a special procedure in which surgeons can microscopically view, during the surgery, tissue surrounding the removed skin to determine if any cancerous cells remain.

ON BEACH, SLOPES OR IN SALONS, TANNING IS DANGEROUS, 14 SCIENCE EXPERTS 
CONCLUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SALLY SQUIRES, Squires is a medical writer for the Washington Post health 
section, in which this story originally appeared. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zonker Harris, the Doonesbury comic-strip character known for his great tan, 
got the message and went "pale" a few months ago. But for sun worshipers still 
denying the dangers of too much sun, a government panel issued a report 
recently that left no more room for doubt. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-member panel, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, spent two 
days examining the scientific evidence on the effects of sunlight and 
ultraviolet radiation on the skin. They concluded that tanning, whether it 
occurs on the beach, in a tanning parlor or on the ski slopes, is "deleterious 
to the skin." 
</P>
<P>
"Tanning is visible evidence of injury to the skin," said David Bickers, 
chairman of the panel and director of the Skin Diseases Research Center at Case 
Western Reserve University in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
That damage can be measured not just by sagging and wrinkling -- signs of early 
aging -- but also by an increased risk of skin cancer. Skin cancers caused by 
ultraviolet-radiation exposure, the kind found in sun rays, are now the most 
common form of cancer in the United States. In 1978, the latest year for which 
figures are available, half a million new cases of skin cancer were diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
The panel said recently that this figure is "probably a gross underestimate 
(for the number of cases) in 1989." The reason: visits to the doctor for 
non-melanoma skin cancer treatment rose 50% in the past 10 years, at a time 
when visits for other ailments increased just 11%, reported Kenneth Kraemer, a 
dermatologist with the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of time spent baking in the sun is directly correlated with the risk 
of skin cancer. That is one reason why basal-cell carcinomas, the most common 
skin cancer found in Caucasians, form primarily on sun-exposed areas of the 
body, such as the face and neck. 
</P>
<P>
Basal-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell skin cancer are far less deadly than 
melanoma -- the most virulent type of skin cancer. "While the risk factors for 
melanoma . . . are less clear, it too has been associated with exposure to 
ultraviolet radiation," the panel concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Too much sun also causes changes in the immune system, and that may in turn 
increase the risk of other forms of cancer. Margaret L. Kripke, a researcher 
with M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, told the panel that only in the 
past several years have researchers discovered that ultraviolet radiation can 
modify immune function in animals. "There is increasing evidence that similar 
effects occur in humans exposed to UV radiation," Kripke said. 
</P>
<P>
For those who thought that they could simply slather on Retin-A to help erase 
sun-caused wrinkles and other damage, the panel's advice is that there is no 
proof that it works. "Available evidence is insufficient to recommend the use 
of Retin-A and similar compounds for treating sun-induced wrinkles," the panel 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Because people who use Retin-A must continue it for the rest of their lives, 
one concern about the drug is whether its long-term use also could pose a 
cancer risk. 
</P>
<P>
Ortho Pharmaceutical Co., the maker of Retin-A, said the company has completed 
studies of 2,000 patients who have used the drug to treat sun damage since 
1985. The results, not yet made public, will be submitted later this year to 
the Food and Drug Administration. "We are very confident about that data," an 
Ortho spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The best bet for preventing both premature aging and skin cancer is to minimize 
sun exposure, especially between the peak hours of 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., the 
panel advised. More than 60% of the ultraviolet rays reaching the Earth's 
surface do so during midday. 
</P>
<P>
Children and adolescents who spend a lot of time outdoors playing or involved 
in sports are the most likely to be affected during these peak hours. Studies 
show that more than half of all lifetime sun exposure occurs before age 18. 
</P>
<P>
For this reason, the panel advised parents and schools to change the time of 
outdoor activities. "Keep recess and recreation time away from those peak 
hours," Bickers said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who cannot avoid the sun need to take precautions when exposed, the panel 
said. They should start by wearing clothing "constructed of tight woven 
fabrics, long sleeves, long pants, (and the like)," they advised. 
</P>
<P>
The next step is frequent and liberal use of sunscreens, with sun-protection 
factors (SPF) of 15 or higher. But a sunscreen with a very high SPF rating is 
not necessarily that much more protective. "There is no evidence to suggest 
that a sunscreen with an SPF of 44 is twice as good as one with an SPF of 22," 
Bickers said. 
</P>
<P>
What most sunscreens do not do is guard against the effects of ultraviolet A 
radiation -- the longer-wave type known as UVA. Many studies in animals and 
humans suggest that UVB -- the shorter-wave ray -- is the more dangerous as far 
as causing cancer. But both types of rays penetrate the skin, and UVA is not 
without damaging effects, the panel noted. Studies of mice and guinea pigs 
show, for example, that UVA can damage DNA, cause redness and produce 
squamous-cell carcinoma. 
</P>
<P>
For this reason, the panel said, "combination sunscreens that are effective 
against UVB and UVA are preferable." Currently only one -- Photoplex, which 
offers extensive protection against both -- is on the market. It is available 
without prescription. Whatever sunscreen consumers choose, the panel said, 
should "be applied 30 minutes before exposure" and then frequently reapplied. 
Those living in the Sun Belt were advised to consider daily use of sunscreens 
for the best protection. 
</P>
<P>
The panel also advised people taking regular medication of any sort to check 
with their doctor before going into the sun. Among the drugs that can react to 
sunlight are some oral antibiotics, blood pressure medicine, drugs to suppress 
the immune system and anti-inflammatory medication. 
</P>
<P>
Worries about the possible cancer-causing effects of sunscreens themselves also 
surfaced in recent weeks. Lester Gurelik, a photochemist with the National 
Cancer Institute's Cancer Prevention and Control Branch, told the panel that a 
class of chemicals called benzophenones, which are found in many sunscreens, 
may themselves help promote cancer. With sun exposure, benzophenones "produce 
intermediate chemicals that cause reactions in the skin that normally cannot 
occur," Gurelik said. "These chemicals could potentially cause damage that 
might promote cancer." 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the current scientific evidence, however, the panel said 
benefits of sunscreens clearly outweigh their risks. Benzophenones have been 
used for 10 to 15 years, Bickers said. "The panel has considered this at great 
length," he said. "At the moment, the use of sunscreens is (deemed) safe." 
</P>
<P>
Despite all their precautionary warnings about sun exposure, the panel said 
they are not advising Americans to live hermit-like existences indoors. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to lead a normal life," said Maria Turner, a panel member who 
practices dermatology at George Washington University Medical Center. "I tell 
my patients to adopt a more Spanish life style. Play tennis at 4 p.m. Swim at 5 
p.m., and children should not be out in the sun at noon." 
</P>

ANATOMY OF SKIN CANCER 
</P>
<P>
BASAL-CELL CARCINOMA 
</P>
<P>
May be a small pearly nodule, a red patch, or a smooth growth with a rolled 
border and an indented center. There may also be tiny blood vessels on the 
surface. Often on exposed areas, such as the back of hands and face, but may be 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA 
</P>
<P>
May be a thick, hard nodule with white or yellow scales, or a red, crusty 
patch. May ulcerate or bleed easily. Usually on exposed areas, including lips, 
but may be elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MALIGNANT MELANOMA 
</P>
<P>
Can be a lethal form of skin cancer. Usually a brown-black or multi-colored 
patch or nodule. Asymmetrical, raised shape, with an irregular border which may 
bleed easily. Usually on the upper back and also on the legs of women.

   A new therapy combining an anti-acne drug with interferon
produced highly promising results in skin and cervical
cancers that were resistant to conventional treatment with
surgery or radiation.
   In the first human tests of the new chemotherapy, cancer
researchers in Texas and Mexico used a combination of two
Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. drugs. The first was 13-cis-retinoic
acid, sold by Roche under the brand name Accutane for the
treatment of acne; the second was alpha interferon, sold by
Roche under the brand name, Roferon-A, for the treatment of
two uncommon cancers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Hoffmann-La Roche, the U.S. unit of Roche Holding Ltd. of
Basle, Switzerland, supported the experiments, as did the
American Cancer Society.
   Among 28 patients with advanced skin cancers that had
resisted all other treatments, 19 patients experienced a
shrinkage of at least 50% in the size of their tumors,
including seven who had a complete disappearance of their
cancers.
   Among 26 women with advanced cervical cancers, 13 had a
regression in tumor size of at least 50%, including one woman
whose cancer disappeared completely.
   It's not yet known how long the benefits of the new
chemotherapy will last. Some of the patients have relapsed
after brief regressions of the cancers while in others the
effects have lasted a year or longer, said Irwin H. Krakoff,
one of the researchers at the University of Texas M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston who carried out the
experiments.
   "We wouldn't even think of saying this is curative," Dr.
Krakoff said. He called the results "encouraging" because it
is the first time this combination of drugs has shown an
anti-cancer effect when given systemically, that is by pill
for the Accutane and by injection for the interferon.
   Moreover, the drug combination had an effect in cancers of
a type and stage that heretofore had been beyond effective
treatment. All the patients had a type of cancer known as
squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cells, which resemble
paving stones when viewed under the microscope, comprise the
exposed or outermost lining of various tissues and organs, in
this instance, the skin and the cervix of the uterus.
   Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is the second most
common human cancer, the first being cancer of the skin's
next lower layer of cells, the basal cells. About 90% of
patients with squamous cell skin cancer are cured by surgery
and radiation. "The remaining nearly 10% of patients who are
not cured, however, represent tens of thousands of cases
requiring a new therapeutic approach," the researchers
reported in the current issue of the Journal of the National
Cancer Institute. They said that about 3,000 persons die
annually in the U.S. from squamous cell skin cancer.
   The M.D. Anderson team reported it had treated 28 patients
with the Accutane-Roferon combination, all of whom suffered
squamous cell skin cancer that had withstood treatment by
surgery and radiation. The cancers had begun to spread in all
the patients and in half the patients skin cancer cells had
metastasized or migrated to other organs.
   Among the 14 patients whose cancers were still confined to
the skin, six had a complete remission of their tumors and
seven had a 50% or greater regression, according to the
researchers, led by cancer specialist Scott M. Lippman. Among
the remaining 14 in whom the cancer had metastasized, one had
a complete remission and five had partial responses.
   A second research team from M.D. Anderson reported it had
gone to Guadalajara, Mexico, to work with Mexican cancer
researchers in treating women with advanced squamous cell
cancers of the cervix. Among the 26 Mexican women, who've
been under treatment for two to four months, one patient has
had a complete remission and 12 have had partial regressions,
the researchers reported. One of these patients has already
had a relapse.
   Among the 13 women classed as "nonresponders," the cancers
in nine seemed to have stopped growing, the researchers
reported. But in the other four women, the cancer has
progressed.
   In both studies, the two drugs are administered every day
for at least two months. The major side effect was fatigue, a
well-known adverse effect of interferon, which posed a
problem largely for the more elderly skin cancer patients.

   How Sunlight
   Causes Cancer

   Scientists said they pinpointed how sunlight causes a
common form of skin cancer, the strongest evidence yet
linking the environment directly to a cancer.
   The scientists, led by researchers at Yale University
School of Medicine, found that the sun's ultraviolet rays
disable a particular gene known to control cell growth. Over
the past three years, scientists have found that when the
gene, called p53, is somehow damaged, cells usually under
control can become malignant.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Until now, there was scant evidence about exactly what
causes the gene to go awry, although scientists have
speculated that environmental agents, such as sunlight or
radiation, are the trigger.
   "There is little doubt that skin cancer involves exposure
to the sun, but we didn't know exactly what happens," said
David Leffell, chief of dermatologic surgery at the Yale
medical school. "Now we do."
   The finding is one of the most important to emerge from
the spate of discoveries over the past three years showing
that cancers arise when certain genes that usually control
cell growth become altered or defective. In particular, the
p53 gene has been linked by scientists to cancers of the
colon, breast, lung, kidney, and brain.
   There is evidence suggesting that people who inherit a
mutated version of p53, or other so-called tumor-suppressor
genes, are especially susceptible to cancer. But most
scientists have argued that the vast majority of cancers
develop when these same genes are deactivated, either through
some spontaneous mistake during cell division or from
exposure to a cancer-causing agent. But only in the past few
months have scientists begun to find evidence linking
suspected carcinogens to the genes.
   The Yale team, aided by researchers in Boston, New York
and Uppsala, Sweden, made the connection by looking at cancer
cells taken from 24 patients. They found that one tiny "hot
spot" in the p53 gene was altered in the exact same manner in
72% of the cases they studied. "What really surprised us is
that the defect was exactly the kind of change that only
occurs when (genetic material) is exposed to ultraviolet
light," said Douglas Brash, who led the research for the Yale
group.
   Ultraviolet light transforms one of four chemical bases,
which recur thousands of times in differing order in the
gene, into another of the four bases. Researchers found that
this change, benign in other genes, is disastrous to p53,
causing the gene to manufacture a defective protein that
destroys the cell's growth-regulating system.
   There are about 650,000 new cases of skin cancer in the
U.S. every year, and about 8,500 deaths related to the
disease, making it the most common of all cancers. The Yale
research, published today in the National Proceedings of the
Academy of Science, involved cancer of squamous skin cells.
The scientists also are looking for similar gene damage in
basal cell cancer and melanoma, the other two major forms of
the disease.
   The Yale scientists said their discovery isn't expected to
produce immediate benefits for treating the disease. But the
finding, they said, should inspire other researchers who are
searching for the exact environmental cause for other
cancers.
   "There is, of course, good reason to believe that
cigarette smoke causes lung cancer by acting on p53 or other
tumor suppressor genes," said Dr. Brash. "Finding as strong a
link as we found won't be easy, but it is the proof everyone
needs."

<HEAD>Study: Many Refuse to Change Sunning Habits After Skin Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study of more than 1,000 people who had
skin-cancer surgery found that nearly half continued to stay in the
sun in the belief that cancer ``was not enough of a problem to give
up a tan.''
   Still, a leading dermatologist sees the sun setting on
sunbathing.
   ``I'm encouraged in the way attitudes are changing,'' said Dr.
Howard K. Koh, chairman of the American Academy of Dermatology
committee coordinating its annual effort to encourage skin cancer
prevention and detection.
   ``I think the message is out that the deep tan is unhealthy.''
   The study found 44 percent had not changed their habits
concerning outdoor activities one year after removal of their
cancers, despite a doctor's repeated counseling.
   Thirty-eight percent said they still weren't using sunscreens,
despite their doctors' advice, said the study, published in the
April issue of the American Medical Association's Archives of
Dermatology.
   Though giving up sunbathing was the most common behavior among
subjects after surgery, 24 percent admitted they were still
suntanning a year later.
   ``The attitude of these non-compliant individuals, who were
usually women, was that skin cancer was not enough of a problem to
give up a tan,'' said the study's author, Dr. June K. Robinson, a
dermatologist at Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago.
   The patients who disregarded their doctor's advice said a tan
``made them feel good, and that the sunscreens have an
objectionable sticky feeling,'' wrote Ms. Robinson.
   All subjects underwent surgery between 1983 and 1987. They were
counseled before and after by Ms. Robinson and a nurse, who told
them they could reduce their risk for subsequent cancers by
reducing sun exposure, wearing protective clothing and using
sunscreens.
   The study focused on non-melanoma skin cancer because its known
cause is the built-up effect of sun exposure over several years,
Koh said.
   Though rarely fatal, non-melanoma skin cancer will strike an
estimated 600,000 Americans this year, the American Cancer Society
says.
   In contrast, melanoma skin cancer is expected to strike 27,600
Americans in 1990 and kill 5,300.
   Its cause is less certain but is believed to be partly
intermittent harsh sun exposure, particularly during adolescence,
Koh said.
   Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United
States, with the number of cases of malignant melanoma doubling
each decade, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.
   Ms. Robinson wrote that of the 1,042 patients who answered
anonymous questionnaires, 56 percent said they had changed their
outdoor activities.

<HEAD>Study: No Evidence Beta Carotene Prevents Skin Cancer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Scientists today said big doses of the nutrient
beta carotene fail to prevent skin cancer but that Mom's advice
still holds: Eat your vegetables.
   People who eat plenty of fruits and vegetables are less likely
to get cancer, and experts had suspected that their intake of beta
carotene might explain this.
   But a study published today in the New England Journal of
Medicine found that beta carotene does not seem to be the key
ingredient, at least as far as skin cancer is concerned.
   ``This conclusion should not, however, deter people from eating
fruits and vegetables,'' the researchers wrote.
   Beta carotene is the nutrient that makes carrots yellow and is
found in varying degrees in many fruits and vegetables. The body
uses it to manufacture vitamin A, which some believe can prevent
cancer, perhaps by trapping chemical compounds known as free
radicals that can harm the body's cells.
   The researchers tested beta carotene pills on people who had
been treated for basal-cell or squamous-cell skin cancer. None had
melanoma, the far more dangerous malignant form of skin cancer. The
treatment did nothing to slow the growth of new skin cancers.
   ``Although our results provide no support for an anti-cancer
effect of oral beta carotene on non-melanoma skin cancer, it would
be unwise to conclude on the basis of this study alone that beta
carotene is ineffective against all cancers,'' the researchers
wrote.
   They noted other evidence to suggest that it might prevent lung
cancer. Several other studies of beta carotene are also under way.
   The study was directed by Dr. E. Robert Greenberg of Dartmouth
Medical School.
   In the study, 1,805 people were randomly assigned to take 50
milligrams of beta carotene or placebos each day for a year. After
five years of follow-up, 362 people who took beta carotene and 340
in the comparison group had at least one new skin cancer.
   The researchers concluded that there is not enough evidence to
prescribe the nutrient as an anti-cancer treatment.
   A separate study in the journal, by Dr. Waun K. Hong of M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, showed that the acne drug
Accutane blocked the growth of new tumors in people being treated
for smoking-related cancer of the mouth and throat.
   The report was widely publicized in May when it was presented in
Washington at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical
Oncology.
   Even after this cancer is initially removed, patients risk
getting new tumors elsewhere in their throats and lungs. Accutane,
an artificial form of vitamin A, reduced the recurrence rate from
24 percent in untreated patients to 4 percent in those getting the
medicine.

VITAMIN C HINDERS BUILDUP OF DEPOSITS IN ARTERIES?

Question: Is it true that taking Vitamin C can help prevent heart attacks? A 
nurse tells me that this is the case. I've heard that Vitamin C is good for 
colds, but I've never heard that it can keep a person from having a heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Your friend may have deen referring to a study that showed that eating 
foods high in Vitamin C may increase the amount of high-density lipoproteins 
(HDL) cholesterol (the good cholesterol) in the blood. HDL cholesterol has been 
found to prevent the buildup of fatty deposits on the inner walls of the 
arteries, and therefore decreases the possibility that the arteries will become 
blocked. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Whenever I go shopping, I become confused by the number of different 
products to choose from, all of them claiming that they are the best. With 
cereals, for example, there seems to be a hundred different kinds on the 
shelves. And when I shop for salmon, there's the red and the pink variety. I 
usually go by which is cheaper, but is one better than the other? 
</P>
<P>
A: From a nutritional standpoint, there isn't a great deal of difference 
between red and pink salmon. They both contain about the same number of 
calories and they both contain about the same amount of calcium and other 
minerals and vitamins. However, the red salmon does have a little more of the 
fish oil that may be medically important. 
</P>
<P>
Pink salmon is more common than red salmon and, therefore, less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My daughter wants to lose some weight, so she goes in a lot for low-calorie 
foods. I don't mind this so much except that all she looks at are the calories, 
without giving any thought to anything else the food might or might not 
contain. Are calories the only thing a person on a diet should worry about? 
</P>
<P>
A: The fact is that some low-calorie foods should be avoided by some dieters. 
For example, many low-calorie frozen dinners are high in sodium. The same holds 
true for a number of sugar-free diet soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
I look upon dieting as a means of enhancing the health of my patients. Any diet 
that does not have this as a goal is probably not worth following. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there any logical reason why so many people in some of the smaller 
countries of the world seem to suffer so much from blindness? Aren't eyes in 
one country the same as eyes in another country? 
</P>
<P>
A: One of the most common causes of blindness in the developing countries is 
cataracts. While cataract surgery is a fairly simple operation in the United 
States, many of the developing nations do not have the surgeons needed to 
perform the operation. The result is blindness that is preventable. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have heard a lot of talk about skin cancer, but I'm not certain what it 
means. Would you please explain? I would also like to know if all skin cancer 
is the same. 
</P>
<P>
A: Skin cancer is the uncontrolled growth of cells in one of the layers of the 
skin. There are several different types of skin cancer, but the most common 
ones are basal cell carcinoma, which is the most common; squamous cell 
carcinoma; and malignant melanoma.

<HEAD>Tailor-Made Antibodies Reverse Lethal Skin Cancer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tailor-made antibodies can dramatically
reverse spreading melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, when
injected directly into the tumors, researchers say.
   The work, though still in its preliminary stages, suggests that
it may be possible to stop the disease by harnessing the body's own
built-in defenses.
   Antibodies are among the body's principal weapons for fighting
off a variety of foreign invaders, including cancer. In this case,
scientists crafted human antibodies in the test tube that were
specifically targeted against the cancer. Then they injected them
into cancerous growths on victims' skin.
   ``The lesions dry up and regress,'' said Dr. Donald Morton,
director of the John Wayne Surgical Oncology Clinic at the
University of California, Los Angeles.
   In initial studies, Morton and colleagues gave the injections to
28 people whose melanoma came back after initial surgery. In 18 of
them, the shots caused partial or complete disappearance of the
growths.
   The doctors injected three different kinds of antibodies. Each
recognizes a different chemical structure that is unique to cancer
cells.
   The antibodies latch onto these chemical structures, marking the
cancer cells for destruction by other patrolling white blood cells.
To the researchers' surprise, they found that the cancer patients
began making more of these antibodies on their own.
   ``We are actually stimulating immunity with this treatment,''
said Morton. ``We don't know why, but it is happening.''
   Morton presented his findings Monday at the annual meeting of
the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
   ``I was quite impressed by the response rate,'' commented Dr.
Carol Westbook of the University of Chicago. ``It appears to be a
promising treatment that warrants further investigation.''
   However, Dr. Bruce Cheson of the National Cancer Institute
cautioned that melanoma is particularly hard to study. The course
of the disease can be difficult to predict, and the cancer may go
away for reasons that have nothing to do with the experimental
treatment.
   Melanoma is curable in about 90 percent of cases when it is
caught early. However, it is fatal if it progresses and spreads
throughout the body.
   Melanoma, like other, less dangerous forms of skin cancer, can
result from over-exposure to the sun, and people with light
complexions or irregularly shaped moles are at highest risk.
   An estimated 27,000 new cases will be diagnosed in the United
States this year, and the disease is believed to be increasing at a
rate of 3 percent or 4 percent a year.
   Among other research presented at the meeting:
   _The acne drug Accutane appears to significantly reduce the risk
of second cancers in people who undergo treatment for
smoking-related tumors of the mouth and throat. In a comparison
study on 100 people, Dr. Waun K. Hong of M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center in Houston presented evidence that the drug, a synthetic
form of vitamin A, suppresses abnormal growths from turning
cancerous.
   Also on Monday, medical experts advising the Food and Drug
Administration said stronger efforts are needed to make sure women
do not use Accutane during pregnancy because it can cause birth
defects. The advisory committees rejected the advice of some within
FDA who want Accutane withheld from all women to eliminate any risk
of birth defects from the drug.
   _Granulocyte colony stimulating factor, a genetically engineered
substance that speeds up production of white blood cells, can
offset a major side effect of cancer treatment. Often people
receiving chemotherapy must stop their medication because the drugs
lower their blood counts, leaving them open to infection.
   Dr. Jeffrey Crawford of Duke University Medical Center tested
the growth factor on 126 lung cancer patients and found that it
reduced low blood counts and infected-related fever by 44 percent.
   _A study by Dr. Charles G. Moertel and others from the Mayo
Clinic helps doctors handle the dilemma of how to treat colon
cancer patients whose tumors have spread through the bowel wall but
have not visibly invaded the lymph nodes. Since three-quarters can
be saved with surgery alone, doctors are reluctant to offer
chemotherapy.
   The new study found ways of identifying the 25 percent whose
tumors are highly likely to spread. Moertel found that those whose
tumors have unusual genetic characteristics or have perforated the
bowel would probably benefit from chemotherapy.

"Britain Faces Skin Cancer Epidemic"] 
  [Text] Skin cancer has become Britain's fastest growing 
cancer, with more than 25 per cent more cases last year than in 
1992, according to the latest figures. 
  More than 40,000 people in the UK were diagnosed as 
suffering 
from skin cancer in 1993, up from 30,000 in 1992, because of 
increased exposure to the sun. 
  A leading cancer expert warned yesterday that babies and 
small children must be protected against the sun this summer. 
Professor Gordon McVie, scientific director of the Cancer 
Research Campaign said that without adequate sunscreens, 
youngsters risked damage from ultraviolet light which could 
cause lasting harm in adult life. 
  A nationwide survey commissioned by the Cancer Research 
Campaign and Boots the Chemist shows that parents use sun 
protection creams on their children, but few keep them covered 
up in T-shirts, hats and sunglasses, or keep them out of the 
treacherous midday sun. 
  Professor McVie said: "The increased number of skin cancer 
cases we are witnessing is a legacy of the 1960's and 1970's, 
when the advent of the cheap package holiday brought the 
Mediterranean sun within the reach of most people's pockets. 
  "This is one cancer which is entirely preventable, but 
unless 
we can get people -- particularly parents -- to follow simple 
sun protection guidelines, I fear we will be facing a skin 
cancer epidemic by 2014." 
  The most dangerous form of skin cancer, malignant melanoma, 
is still considered rare but accounts for about 5,000 new cases 
a year in the UK. It is more common in women than men. 
  There were 1,265 deaths from the disease in the UK in 1992, 
split equally between men and women. Survival rates for women 
seem to be improving, which may be due to earlier diagnosis. 
  Malignant melanoma appears usually as a black or dark mole 
with irregular edges which can itch and bleed. Benign moles are 
more regular in shape and have a lighter pigmentation. Most 
people develop moles on their body before the age of 30, but any 
which appear suddenly should be treated with suspicion. 
  In England and Wales between 1968 and 1985, there was an 80 
per cent greater chance of women developing the disease in 
Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Dorset, Isle of Wight, East Sussex 
and Cambridgeshire. 
  Men had a 100 per cent increased risk of developing the 
disease in Cornwall and were also more vulnerable in Devon, 
Somerset, Dorset, Isle of Wight, Hampshire, West and East Sussex.

<HEAD>Expert Panel Says All Suntans Are ``Potentially Hazardous''</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Those summer days spent soaking up the rays to
create a glorious tan may come back to haunt sun worshippers with
cancer and aged, wrinkled skin, a panel of experts said.
   A National Institutes of Health consensus committee on Wednesday
said current health studies show that suntans can lead to skin
cancer, a weakened immune system and skin that wrinkles and ages
before its time.
   Instead of uncovering to bathe in the noontime sun, the panel
recommended Americans avoid the midday hours of sunlight, wear
shading clothes and apply generous amounts of sunscreen lotions.
   Children in particular should be protected from overexposure to
sunlight because skin damaged early in life is more likely to
develop cancer later, the panel said in a report.
   ``All forms of tanning are potentially hazardous to the skin,''
said David Bickers, head of the panel and chairman of the
dermatology department at Case Western Reserve University in
Cleveland. ``Tanning is visible evidence of injury to the skin.''
   Larry A. Schachner of the University of Miami paraphrased Noel
Coward to note: ``Only mad dogs and Englishmen go out in midday
sun. There are no healthy tans.''
   Bickers said the panel recommended that:
   _Everyone avoid direct exposure to sunlight, particularly during
the hours of 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. when the ultraviolet rays coming
from the sun are the strongest.
   _People exposed to sunlight should wear sunscreen lotion with a
rating of 15 based on protection from ultraviolet B solar
radiation. The panel said ultraviolet A radiation also is
hazardous, though much less so, and lotions that protect against
both types of UV are best. Bickers said the panel found that
lotions with a protection rating of 15 ``will assure that virtually
everyone would get sufficient protection from the sun'' and that
there is no evidence lotions with higher ratings provide additional
protection.
   _Tanning parlors should be avoided. ``The panel consensus is to
recommend against the use of tanning parlors for cosmetic
purposes,'' said Bickers. People who do use tanning parlors should
wear goggles to protect their eyes and should be aware that tanning
lamps can damage the skin and cause adverse reactions in people
taking antibiotics, hypertensive or anti-inflammatory drugs, the
panel said.
   _Though some people react adversely to chemicals contained in
lotion sunscreens, the panel said the ``risk-benefit ratio'' favors
the use of such lotions for people who must be exposed to the sun.
Said Bickers: ``Individuals in the Sunbelt should use sunscreens on
a daily basis.''
   _Special precautions should be taken to protect children from
damaging exposures to sunlight. Schachner, an expert on children's
skin, said that schools and day care centers should schedule
outdoor recesses to avoid midday exposure to the sun. He also said
that outdoor play or lunch areas should be shaded.
   _Damaging exposure to sunlight, particularly early in life, can
lead directly to development of two types of common skin cancer,
and there is a suggestion that sunlight may play a role in
development of maglignant melanoma, an unusually vicious type of
skin cancer.
   _Though Retin-A and other vitamin A-based compounds are widely
used to treat the wrinkles in sun-damaged skin, Bickers said the
panel found there was insufficient scientific evidence about ``the
long-term safety'' of such products.
   A 1978 study showed that about half a million people annually
develop the common forms of skin cancer, said Bickers, but reports
from skin doctors indicate ``it is highly likely that there is an
increasing number of cases of non-melanoma cancers.''
   He said chemicals are thought to be eroding the ozone layer of
the stratosphere, thus allowing more ultraviolet radiation to reach
the Earth's surface. And Bickers said the panel's research showed
there are about 20,000 tanning salons in the United States which
are visited by an estimated one million customers. Both of these
factors, he said, may be leading to increasing cases of skin
cancers.
   The panel released the recommendations after reviewing studies
and hearing testimony over a three-day period. The panel included
14 skin and cancer experts from nine states.

<LEADPARA>  JUST when you thought it was safe to go out in the sun -- slathered with
sunscreen -- a controversy has arisen over whether current products protect
the skin from all damaging forms of ultraviolet light.;    Ultraviolet B, or
UVB, is the high-energy form that tans and ages skin and causes skin cancer,
especially the most deadly type, melanoma.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  SUNSCREEN IS THE FIRST STEP TO PROTECTION  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Health &amp; Fitness  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Ultraviolet A, or UVA, is a lower-energy form that is 1,000 times less
effective at tanning. Yet it, too, damages the skin, and causes non-melanoma
skin cancer.;    Most sunscreens block only the UVB radiation that causes
sunburn -- but not much UVA. Some scientists have begun to worry that unless
UVA is also blocked, skin will still be damaged. Use of sunscreens, these
scientists warn, may even have contributed to the rise in skin cancer, by
protecting sunbathers from getting burned, thereby allowing them to stay in
the sun longer -- but without protection from damaging UVA rays.;    John
DiGiovanna, a skin cancer expert at the National Cancer Institute, is
skeptical. He said it takes decades for a cancer to arise after the skin is
damaged by the sun. In addition, he said, "you can cause skin cancer in
animals by shining ultraviolet light on them. The animals don't get more skin
cancer if you use a sunscreen on them; they get less.";    Nevertheless,
between the thinning of the ozone layer and the rise in skin cancer, there is
cause to worry about overexposure to sunlight. This year alone, according to
the Cancer Institute, 600,000 Americans will be diagnosed with some form of
skin cancer, including 32,000 with melanoma. The number of cases of melanoma,
which annually kills about 8,000 Americans, has doubled in the last decade.;  
 To limit the risk, the American Cancer Society recommends that people use
sunscreen, wear protective clothing and hats, and stay out of the sun at
midday, when ultraviolet radiation is most intense.;    Experts recommend
using a sunscreen with a protection rating of SPF 15 or higher; the
preparation should also be waterproof or water-resistant, they say. SPF, or
sun protection factor, is a measure of how long a person can remain in the sun
without being burned, compared to the time it takes for unprotected skin to
redden.;    An SPF of 15 means you can be in the sunshine 15 times as long as
it takes your unprotected skin to turn red. Higher SPF numbers do not provide
significantly greater protection.;    Bright surfaces -- especially sand,
water and white concrete -- reflect ultraviolet light, enabling it to reach
even people sitting in the shade. Swimmers also are not safe from the sun's
rays, because water does not block ultraviolet rays.;    Two new products,
Filterray from Burroughs Wellcome Co. and Photoplex from Herbert Laboratories,
are designed to block both UVB and UVA. The FDA has concluded that the
products work. Other studies found that some traditional sun lotions provided
good protection against UVB and some protection against UVA.  </TEXT>

   When Doug La Follette tossed his hat in the
ring for the U.S. Senate, some people wondered why the hat was so
big.
   La Follette, Wisconsin's secretary of state, wears a gray
Australian bush hat almost everywhere he goes. The reason is, he
has the same mild form of skin cancer as President Reagan.
   His wide-brimmed hat is a slight political liability, but also a
potential trademark and a tool for educating people about the
hazards of excessive exposure to the sun, La Follette said.
   ``I don't wear a hat out of a quirk, I wear a hat for very
realistic health reasons,'' La Follette, 48, said during a campaign
visit at a recent farmers market on Capitol Square. ``I've learned
that the sun can be harmful.''
   La Follette is one of five Democrats and two Republicans vying
to succeed retiring Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis.
   ``It's very sobering, realizing being brown is not as beautiful
as you think it is,'' said La Follette, who was diagnosed three
years ago as having basal cell carcinoma, the most common and least
dangerous form of skin cancer.
   Nationally, an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 people are diagnosed
each year as having the easily treated form of cancer. It is not
even counted in official cancer statistics, but still could be
fatal if untreated.
   La Follette's case was diagnosed when what he thought was a
pimple turned out to be a pre-cancerous spot on his skin. Since
then, he has gone in for a checkup every six months.
   His physician, Dr. Stephen Snow, of the University of Wisconsin
Medical School, said skin cancer accounts for more than one-third
of all cancer cases, and as many skin cancers are diagnosed
annually as cancers of the lung, breast, colon and prostate
combined.
   ``It's all related to sunlight,'' Snow said. ``It's a totally
preventable problem, but since when has the average person ever
been rational?''
   Dr. Derek Cripps, also of the University of Wisconsin,
recommends that everyone wear sun screen with a protection factor
of 15 or higher; La Follette wears sun screen rated 32 as well as
his wide-brimmed hat.
   Wearing a hat puts off some people, La Follette said.
   ``You can't be a hermit; the hat is my solution,'' La Follette
said. ``The big brim is important because it keeps the sun off my
nose and ears.''

   A fatal type of skin cancer is affecting more
people at a younger age than ever before, and the trend may get
worse if chemical pollution continues to leach natural ozone from
the atmosphere, an expert says.
   Dr. Darrell S. Rigel, an assistant clinical professor of
dermatology at New York University Medical School, said Tuesday that
melanoma, a type of skin cancer that can be fatal if not treated, is
now diagnosed at the rate of one of 128 Americans, an increase of
about 1,500 percent compared to 1935.
   Even more disturbing, the ages of patients developing melanoma is
dropping dramatically, Rigel told the American Academy of
Dermatology annual meeting.
   ``Five years ago it was unusual to see someone under the age of
40 with skin cancer,'' said Rigel. ``Now we're commonly seeing
people in their 20s with skin cancer.''
   About 25 percent of the estimated 27,300 Americans diagnosed as
having melanoma this year will be aged 39 or under, he said. Only a
few years ago, melanoma was conidered a disease of the aged, Rigel
said.
   ``Not only has the overall rate grown, but the age group where it
has grown the most rapidly is in the youngest group,'' said Rigel.
``The rate of increase is highest among the youngest people, not
only here, but in other countries.''
   It's generally believed that melanoma, a skin cancer that will
spread throughout the body if not excised by surgery early, develops
after 10 to 20 years of heavy or damaging exposure to ultraviolet
rays of the sun. But Rigel said the increasing rate of the disease
among the young suggests that the time it takes to develop the
disease may be decreasing.
   A loss of ozone in atmosphere ``might be the explanation of why
people are getting it younger and younger _ maybe. That has been
brought up as a hyposthesis,'' said Rigel. ``For every decrease of 1
percent in the ozone layer, there is a 2 percent increase in the
incidence of skin cancer.''
   Ozone is a natural gas present in the atmosphere that partially
blocks ultraviolet solar rays from reaching the Earth's surface.
Studies in recent years have shown that some types of chemical
pollutants, principally the fluorocarbons that are used for
refrigerants and solvents, destroy the atmospheric ozone, thus
allowing more ultraviolet rays to reach Earth.
   Counterbalancing the ozone-loss effect, said Rigel, is a growing
consciousness about the dangers of excessive exposure to the sun. He
said more people are using solar screens, a lotion that is applied
to the skin to filter out ultraviolet sun rays.
   ``People are so much more sun conscious than they were just five
years ago,'' he said in an interview. ``The use of sun screen has
risen very dramatically.''
   Many parents have become aware that sun damage on the skins of
children under the age of 10 can result in cancer among those
youngsters before they are 30, said Rigel. As a result, he said,
even children now are using sun screen.
   ``We won't begin to see the effects of that sun screen usage for
another 10 to 20 years from now,'' he said. ``The hope is that by
the turn of the century, the sun screen use and more common sense
about avoiding the sun will kick in'' and cause a decline in skin
cancers.
   If not, said Rigel, he predicts that by the year 2000, melanoma
may be striking one in every 90 Americans.
   Melanoma first appears as a black, brown or mixed colored spot of
irregular shape on the skin's surface. Left untreated, the cancer
penetrates to the interior of the skin and releases cells that can
move through the bloodstream and establish colonies in the bone,
brain, lung or even heart. Once this happens, the disease cannot be
cured, said Rigel.
   But if the cancer is detected early, when it is still about the
size of a pencil eraser, it can easily be cut from the skin and cure
is almost certain, he said.
   Rigel said the number of melanoma cases in the United States has
almost doubled during the last eight years, and the number of deaths
has tripled, to about 5,800, since 1960. Yet, the survival rate for
melanoma patients has risen from 60 percent in the 1960s, to about
83 percent now.

   Melanoma, a sometimes-fatal skin cancer, is

   The disease is found largely among light-skinned people and in
this country in the Sun Belt states of the South and West.
   It is generally believed that melanoma, a skin cancer that will

<HEAD>Bird Watchers on the Lookout for Everglades Kites</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Florida bird watchers are
being asked to report sightings of the endangered Everglades kite.
   The Everglades kite also is known as the snail kite because it
exclusively eats apple snails, a wetlands mollusk whose survival is
threatened by drought.
   ``We want to identify important wetlands where the kites are so
the state can possibly protect the site,'' said wildlife biologist
Mark Maffei of the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge, which has
asked for reports of sightings.
   The kite is 15 inches tall with a wingspan of 45 inches. Males
are slate gray and females are dark brown with white mottling. They
also have a white band on the tips of their tails.
   If wetlands dry up and deprive the birds of the snails, the
kites will travel far from their nests in search of food and will
not return.
   ``They just abandon their young,'' said Jim Rodgers, a biologist
for the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission. ``They won't
nest on dry ground.''
   The kite's prime habitat and nesting area are Everglades water
conservation areas in western Palm Beach, Broward and Dade
counties. These sites are parched by a severe drought that has
forced residential water restrictions.
   ``And we're just getting into the dry season,'' said Burkett
Neely, manager of the refuge. ``It was bad last year. It could be
worse this year.''
   A midwinter survey found 464 snail kites foraging in marshes
from Central Florida to the tip of the peninsula in Everglades
National Park. That was 36 fewer than the previous year's count,
Rodgers said.
   The wildlife refuge has become a clearinghouse for reports of
snail kite sightings. The birds have been found along canals,
flooded farm fields or wetland pockets as they scatter out of the
dried-out Everglades.

will produce copies of Palomar Observatory's definitive atlas of
the northern sky.
   The 48-inch Oschin Telescope at Palomar, located on a
mountaintop in eastern San Diego County, has been used exclusively
since 1986 for a decade-long effort to take detailed photographs of
all portions of space above the Northern Hemisphere.
   The project, known as the second Palomar Observatory Sky Survey,
will yield 2,682 photographic plates that ``will serve as the basic
astronomical guide to the northern skies for decades to come,''
said Robert Finn, spokesman for the California Institute of
Technology, which owns Palomar.
   The plates must be reproduced for sale to major research
observatories, but Caltech hasn't done such work since Palomar's
first northern sky survey was conducted in the 1940s and 1950s.
   The staff of the ESO, headquartered near Munich, West Germany,
recently produced plates of Southern Hemisphere sky surveys made in
the 1970s by its observatory in La Silla, Chile, and by the
Anglo-Australian Observatory in Australia.
   So Caltech officials decided the European Southern Observatory's
staff would be able to make high-quality plates less expensively,
keeping costs as low as possible, Robert J. Brucato, Palomar's
assistant director, said.
   Under an agreement between Caltech and ESO, the European
organization will reproduce Palomar's sky atlas in two forms: glass
plates and film transparencies.
   Brucato said the cost depends on the number of purchasers, but a
set of the glass plates probably would cost several hundred
thousand dollars, while a set of transparencies likely would cost
tens of thousands of dollars.

<HEAD>Skin Cancer Patients Sought for Study on Selenium Link</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MACON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers are looking for former skin cancer
patients in Georgia for a study on the role of selenium in
prevention of the disease.
   The Georgia Dermatology and Skin Cancer Center is taking part in
a program called ``Nutritional Prevention of Skin Cancer,'' said
Mary Reid, project coordinator of the research, sponsored by the
Arizona College of Medicine and the American Cancer Society.
   Selenium, a trace mineral found most often in volcanic soil, is
passed to humans through food, meats and grains, she said. Data
from studies around the world show that cancer is more common in
areas where selenium levels are lower. Selenium is found in only
very low levels in Georgia soil.
   The mineral helps protect cells from structural changes, Ms.
Reid said. There also has been evidence that selenium helps
stimulate the immune system.
   A total of 1,700 patients in the selenium research project come
from clinics in Georgia, Connecticut, Florida, North Carolina and
South Carolina.
   The Macon study group is the largest, with 500 people, Ms. Reid
said. But more participants are needed.
   Participants must have no history of kidney or liver problems,
as very large doses of selenium have been found to cause liver
problems. Selenium, otherwise, has few side effects.
   ``To qualify (for the study), the person must have had basal
cell or squamous cell carcinoma in the past and a recent (bout with
skin cancer) within the last 12 months as well,'' said Billie L.
Jackson, a dermatologist in the Macon center.
   Squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common form of skin
cancer, affecting 80,000 to 100,000 people a year, with about 2,000
deaths reported, according to the American Cancer Society.
   Excessive sun exposure is the major factor associated with this
type of cancer.

<HEAD>American Cancer Society Uses Ads to Glamorize Sunscreens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In posters of bronzed sunworshippers, she's
sultry and he's hot, and both need to avoid ultraviolet rays if
they want to stay that way.
   In a broadcast and poster campaign launched last week, the
Cancer Society is using Sports Illustrated swimsuit models like
Cheryl Tiegs to convince teens that tanning is ``out'' and the
undamaged look is ``in.''
   Those who burn most easily and have the highest risk of skin
cancer are Caucasians with light hair and eyes, said Northwestern
University dermatologist Dr. June Robinson, head of the American
Cancer Society Skin Cancer Task Force.
   Teens, lured by bronzed bodies, also are more prone to risk
overexposure, Robinson said. ``We keep telling teen-agers to stay
out of the sun, but they don't listen. They want to look like
Sports Illustrated models.''
   ``Calling any of these Sports Illustrated swimsuit models a `10'
is no compliment,'' a breathy voice in the TV spot says as the
models whip back their hair and rub suntan lotion on their legs.
``They are definitely `15s' because when they're in the sun, each
of them uses a suncreen with at least a SPF of 15 as recommended by
the American Cancer Society to help rub out skin cancer.''
   Robinson and Stanley Tannenbaum, a Northwestern advertising
professor, launched the campaign to encourage use of lotions with a
Sun Protection Factor of 15 or greater. A sunscreen with SPF 15
enables the user to stay in the sun 15 times longer than without
sunscreen.
   Posters will be given to schools and health clubs on request; TV
and radio announcements were mailed to Chicago stations.
   The campaign was undertaken after the society found the
incidence of malignant melanoma, the most deadly of skin cancers,
growing at a rate of 3.4 percent a year _ faster than that of any
other cancer. It estimates half of all people who live to 65 will
have skin cancer at some time and predicts malignant melanoma will
kill 6,000 this year, often because of sun damage 20 years ago.
   Warning signs of melanoma are ragged-edged moles, uneven in
color and about the size of a pencil eraser. They increase in size,
bleed easily, and commonly appear on the backs of men and the legs
of women.

<HEAD>Prehistoric Blades Give Clue to Human Migration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ultra-sharp ``microblades'' that rival
some of the best modern cutting tools may provide a glimpse into
the lives of primitive people who wandered from Asia to the Pacific
Northwest eons ago.
   ``This is the sharpest thing there is,'' said Washington State
University archaeologist Robert E. Ackerman as he looked at drawers
of blades chipped from obsidian, a hard, volcanic glass, and chert,
a fine-grained, tough rock. ``This is sharper than any surgeon's
instrument.
   ``In fact, it is now being used in some eye surgery.''
   The abundance of microblades and the blocks from which they were
chipped across the Soviet Union and into Alaska are solid clues to
how primitive people wandered from Asia to the Pacific Northwest,
Ackerman said. ``These microblade cores are very distinctive, like
pottery,'' helping to identify the cultures of the people who made
them and the times in which they lived.
   Akerman and other researchers from around the world shared their
knowledge at a Circum-Pacific Prehistory Conference last week in
Seattle.
   While a number of theories support the creation of land bridge
as the Ice Age lowered ocean levels, the trail of blades show a
clear migration of people from 30,000 years ago to 12,000 years
ago, Ackerman says.
   Many of the blades were made of obsidian, a fine-grained
volcanic mineral available throughout the Pacific rim's ``ring of
fire.'' And because they will not decompose, the blades have left
researchers with unique timeline.

FT  31 JUL 93 / Group aims to cut level of skin cancer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITAIN has had its worst late-July weather for more than a decade,
according to official figures.
They will be welcomed by the National Radiological Protection Board, an
independent body, which yesterday launched a campaign to discourage
sunbathing.
The board is to publish weekly reports on solar ultra-violet radiation, the
part of the sun's rays that cause tanning and burning.
From next year the service will give daily forecasts so that the
sun-sensitive can take evasive action. The board recommends wearing
sunglasses, a broad-brimmed hat and 'clothing with a tight weave'.
Swimmers should use a sun block with a high sun protection factor. A
protection factor of 15 allows the wearer to stay in the sun 15 times longer
without burning than without any protection.
Without protection, it takes just 23 minutes on a clear summer's day for
sensitive skin to burn in the UK, the board said.
In the Caribbean it takes little more than half that. Sunburn increases the
risk of skin cancer, and Britons' carelessness could be behind a rising
incidence of the disease. Women are more at risk because they sunbathe more
than men, said the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. Pale skin and slow tanning
show a greater sensitivity, but more important is a family history of skin
cancer.
The government's Health of the Nation white paper last year said the
increasing trend of skin cancers should be halted by 2005. The Department of
Health has backed the board's initiative.
Government figures show incidences of skin cancer in England increased by a
quarter between 1980 and 1987, the most recent year for which statistics are
available.
Sufferers of the most common skin cancer need an operation to remove the
diseased area. Half of those who develop the more rare malignant melanoma
die from it. There were 1,091 recorded deaths from malignant melanoma in
1991 compared with 815 in 1981.

RESEARCH: A SAN DIEGO EPIDEMIOLOGIST SEES THE NEED FOR RAYS IN PRODUCTION OF 
VITAMIN D. OTHERS SAY MORE STUDY IS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE THE RISKS AND 
BENEFITS OF SUNLIGHT.

Slowly but steadily, the evils of sunbathing have been etched into American 
consciousness. Stay out of the sun, most everyone has been warned by physicians 
at one time or another, to minimize the risk of skin cancer, not to mention an 
onslaught of wrinkles. If sun worshiping is still a must, so is sunscreen, most 
doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
Now, some researchers are crying "overkill." Getting a little sun, they claim, 
isn't a bad idea. Minimal sun exposure may actually decrease the risks of 
colon, rectal and breast cancers, partly by triggering adequate production of 
Vitamin D, especially in the elderly, suggests Cedric Garland, a San Diego 
epidemiologist and associate professor of community and family medicine at the 
UC San Diego School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
He is not promoting a return to the old bake-at-the-beach mentality. But 10 or 
15 minutes a day of sunlight exposure may actually be healthy for some people, 
contends Garland, who earlier this year presented his research findings in New 
Orleans at the annual meeting of the American Assn. for the Advancement of 
Science. 
</P>
<P>
Dermatology and cancer specialists emphasize that the work of Garland and 
others should be viewed with caution and that further work needs to be done to 
determine the relative risks and benefits of sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
Colon and rectal cancer will kill 61,000 people this year, while breast cancer 
will claim another 44,000 lives, according to American Cancer Society 
estimates. Another 8,800 people will die of skin cancer in 1990, most of them 
from the most deadly form, called melanoma. 
</P>
<P>
Garland began rethinking traditional sun exposure advice about a decade ago, 
when he and his brother, Frank Garland, head of the epidemiology program of the 
U.S. Naval Health Research Center in San Diego, examined a U.S. map showing 
county-by-county death rates from different types of cancers. The brothers 
became intrigued by the low colon cancer rates in the Southwest and the high 
rates in the Northeast, wondering if the amount of sunlight and the Vitamin D 
it helps produce might play a role. 
</P>
<P>
Next, the Garlands, working with other researchers, analyzed the diets of 
nearly 2,000 men and found that the risk of colon cancer was correlated with 
low levels of dietary Vitamin D. In another study, published late last year in 
The Lancet, Garland and his colleagues thawed blood samples collected years 
earlier from colon cancer patients, comparing them to samples drawn from 
healthy subjects. Vitamin D levels were lower in the cancer patients than in 
controls, said Garland, who concludes that maintaining high levels of Vitamin D 
might reduce colon and rectal cancer risk by as much as 80%. 
</P>
<P>
An unpublished study by the Garlands and UC San Diego epidemiologist Edward D. 
Gorham found that breast cancer death rates in the darkest republics of the 
Soviet Union are three times those in republics with more sunshine. He found 
that breast cancer death rates in northern parts of the United States are about 
1.5 times higher than the death rates in the sunnier southern parts of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Any protective effect of Vitamin D probably works in more than one way, Garland 
said. "It may maintain tight junctions between cells in the bowel's lining, for 
instance, thus . . . preventing the evolution of early cancers." 
</P>
<P>
The Garlands are not the only ones doing research in this area. 
</P>
<P>
In a University of Utah study, dietary calcium was termed a "mitigating factor" 
in colon cancer after researcher Martha Slattery followed 231 patients 
eventually diagnosed with colon cancer and 391 patients who remained 
cancer-free. Vitamin D helps regulate the amount of calcium absorbed by the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
She compared the dietary habits of the groups two years before the cancer 
diagnosis and found that dietary calcium decreased the risk of colon cancer in 
low-risk people. It may do so, Slattery speculates, by decreasing the exposure 
of the bowel's lining to irritating fatty acids and bile acids. Her research 
was published in 1988 in the American Journal of Epidemiology. 
</P>
<P>
In another study, researchers found that chronic sunscreen use decreases 
concentrations of circulating Vitamin D. The researchers, whose study was 
published in late 1988 in the Archives of Dermatology, compared 20 long-term 
sunscreen users with 20 control subjects who were about the same age and who 
were accustomed to about the same sunlight exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Based on this body of research, Cedric Garland offers several pieces of advice: 
</P>
<P>
* Spend just a few minutes in the sun every day, especially if you are 65 or 
older. But the advice doesn't hold for very fair-skinned people or those with a 
history of serious skin disorders, Garland added. 
</P>
<P>
* Minimize sun exposure otherwise. Skip sunscreen, Garland advises, although 
other experts strongly disagree with him. 
</P>
<P>
"Sunscreen interferes with the production of Vitamin D in the skin and reduces 
circulating Vitamin D levels by half," said Garland. And he is not convinced 
that sunscreen prevents melanoma. 
</P>
<P>
The sunscreen industry thinks differently. "What we know is sunscreen blocks 
the sun and sunlight contributes to melanoma," said Jerry McEwen, vice 
president of science for the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Assn., a 
Washington-based trade group. 
</P>
<P>
* If you do use sunscreen, be sure to eat sufficient amounts of Vitamin 
D-containing foods, Garland suggested. Milk and fish such as tuna are good 
choices, he added. 
</P>
<P>
How much Vitamin D is enough? About 400 International Units (IUs) a day, 
Garland suggested. That is the current recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for 
children and double the RDA for adults. (A cup of milk, for instance, supplies 
about 100 IUs of Vitamin D.) "And we may have reason to take that up to 1,000 
IUs (based on research in progress)," Garland added. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees with Garland's advice. Dr. Clark Heath, vice president for 
epidemiology and statistics for the American Cancer Society, calls Garland's 
advice and ideas "interesting but unproven," adding that "further research may 
or may not bear them out." What is known, Heath said, is that "excessive 
sunlight is clearly linked with all forms of skin cancer." 
</P>
<P>
In a consensus statement issued in 1988, the American Academy of Dermatology 
called for "further documentation of the impact sunscreen use has on elderly 
patients at risk of Vitamin D deficiency," according to a spokesman for the 
academy. "We stand by our advice to use sunscreen with a sun protection factor 
of 15 or greater," he added. 
</P>
<P>
But some physicians have adopted a middle-of-the-road stance, pending further 
studies. "We don't yet know what role 10 minutes a day plays in (the 
development of) skin cancer, but it would probably be safe," said Dr. Jeff 
Ashley, USC associate clinical professor of medicine and a Burbank 
dermatologist, who cautions his patients never to sunburn. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are taking sun-avoidance advice seriously," Ashley also tells his 
patients, "you need to pay attention to Vitamin D. Drink three or four glasses 
of milk a day, or take a Vitamin D supplement. Take it with calcium. The 
metabolism of the two are so closely linked that those people not getting 
enough Vitamin D may not be getting enough calcium either."

<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush had a small cancerous growth
removed from her upper lip on Wednesday, her press office announced
today.
   ``No side effects or subsequent difficulties are expected,'' it
said in announcing the operation.
   She underwent the outpatient procedure at Bethesda Naval
Hospital in Maryland.
   Mrs. Bush was in New York today, visiting All Children's House,
a day care center for homeless children and other youths.
   In a one-paragraph statement, her press office said:
   ``At Bethesda Naval Hospital on Feb. 14, Mrs. Bush underwent a
routine outpatient medical procedure to remove a small basal cell
carcinoma, a common form of skin cancer, from her upper lip. The
procedure was performed under local anesthesia by Bethesda's chief
of dermatology, Dr. Harry Parlette. No side effects or subsequent
difficulties are expected.''
   Mrs. Bush recently underwent radiation treatment for a
persistent eye problem stemming from a condition known as Graves
disease, which also had affected her thyroid.
   Jean Becker, a deputy press secretary, said the cancer was
discovered about a week ago. She was not sure whether Mrs. Bush had
undergone the same procedure in the past.
   Basal cell carcinomas are common skin cancers that occur most
often on the face or on other skin areas that have been exposed to
the sun. Light-skinned people, such as Mrs. Bush, are most
susceptible.
   The cancer grows slowly, usually is easily removed surgically
and only rarely re-occurs at the same site.

ROGER SIMON: BEING PALE: FATE WORSE THAN DEATH 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am standing here in Phoenix at 2 o'clock in the afternoon and the temperature 
is hovering right around the melting point of copper. 
</P>
<P>
I know this because the pennies in my pocket are beginning to fuse. The heat 
waves are shimmering up from the sidewalk and it is difficult to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
But as I raise my hand to block the relentless sun, I see a sign through my 
fingers: It is for a tanning salon. 
</P>
<P>
I begin to laugh. A tanning salon? In Phoenix? Where the sun shines 300 days a 
year -- and when I say shines, I mean char-broils? 
</P>
<P>
When I get back to my hotel room I look in the Yellow Pages. I find 20 tanning 
salons in the greater Phoenix area (cutest name: "Brown Bunns" on Shea 
Boulevard). This is very unfortunate but completely understandable. I have 
written about this phenomenon before: It is a uniquely American right. The 
right to be goofy. 
</P>
<P>
"Buckle my seat belt? No way. It's my head and I got a right to have it go 
through the windshield if I want." 
</P>
<P>
"Wear a helmet on a motorcycle? Not a chance! I got a right to become a 
vegetable." 
</P>
<P>
"Stop getting suntans? Hey, it's my skin and I got a right to get cancer." 
</P>
<P>
And we do. There are 500,000 new cases of skin cancer each year in the United 
States. One thing that causes skin cancer is tanning. Skin cancer is the most 
common form of cancer. It is also one of the most curable forms. Even the worst 
type, malignant melanoma, is curable if you catch it in time. 
</P>
<P>
But 23% of the people who develop it die because it has spread too far for 
effective treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Melanoma skin cancer will strike 27,600 Americans this year and kill 5,300 of 
them. The number of cases of malignant melanoma is doubling each decade. 
</P>
<P>
I know all these facts. And I mull them over as I head out to the pool for a 
tan. This makes no sense. This is my right to be goofy. 
</P>
<P>
But at least I know why I am being goofy. I know why people get tans. It makes 
them look good. And they get compliments and this makes them feel good. 
</P>
<P>
I look beautiful this week. More beautiful than usual, that is. I have a golden 
tan. I shouldn't, but I do. I try to be sensible: I always use a sunscreen. I 
never stay out more than an hour a day. I try to avoid the most dangerous 
hours, around noon. 
</P>
<P>
But I know I would be better off looking pale like the belly of a fish. I can't 
seem to resist a tan, however. 
</P>
<P>
The people who run tanning salons know this. They know about customers they 
call "tanorexics." These are people with dark tans who keep coming back to get 
even tanner. 
</P>
<P>
There are now 20,000 tanning parlors in the United States, up from 5,000 in 
1986. Every day more than 1 million Americans use them, and annual retail sales 
are about at $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
This is more than goofy. This is nuts. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to some claims, there is no "safe" kind of suntanning. You can ask 
Kelly Salvey, a 21-year-old New Yorker. In 1989 she used a tanning machine in a 
health club for 60 minutes. She used it that long because after the first 40 
minutes, she saw no results. 
</P>
<P>
But within two hours of returning home, she had plenty of results: Her skin 
turned purple, she had trouble breathing, she dehydrated. She had received six 
times the recommended dosage of ultraviolet radiation and had second- and 
third-degree burns. She spent four days in a hospital and today she has 
permanent scars on her face. 
</P>
<P>
All she wanted to do was look good. 
</P>
<P>
Even in sunny cities where people get plenty tanned just walking around, 
tanning parlors flourish. People aren't satisfied getting tanned in the 
daytime. They want to be able to get a tan at night, too. 
</P>
<P>
You want to know how crazy this gets? This is one of the craziest stories I 
have read in years. It was carried by the Associated Press last week: 
</P>
<P>
"A study of more than 1,000 people who had skin-cancer surgery found that 
nearly half continued to stay in the sun in the belief that cancer 'was not 
enough of a problem to give up a tan.' 
</P>
<P>
"The study, published in the April issue of the American Medical Assn.'s 
Archives of Dermatology, found that 44% had not changed their outdoor 
activities one year after removal of their cancers, despite repeated warnings 
by their doctors." In addition, 38% still weren't using sunscreens. 
</P>
<P>
Now think about this. You get cancer. You have it removed by a doctor. And then 
you go back out to get a suntan. Why? 
</P>
<P>
"The attitude of these non-compliant individuals, who were usually women, was 
that skin cancer was not enough of a problem to give up a tan," said the 
study's author, Dr. June K. Robinson, a dermatologist at Northwestern 
University Medical School in Chicago. A tan made these people "feel good." 
</P>
<P>
Which is just plain goofy. And if we wanted to help each other out, we would 
never compliment a friend's tan. 
</P>
<P>
Instead we would say: "You look like cooked meat, you jerk! Don't you know 
enough to come in out of the sun?" 
</P>
<P>
I have been telling this to myself every time I look in the mirror this week. 
</P>
<P>
I just wish I didn't look so darned good.

   A promising vaccine to prevent
recurrence of melanoma is being tested in nationwide clinical
trials involving at least 200 patients suffering from the deadliest
form of skin cancer, its developer says.
   ``What it means is there is potential for some hope, and perhaps
we're going to be able to immunize a patient against potential
recurrence,'' said Marc Wallack, a cancer specialist and chairman
of general surgery of Mount Sinai Medical Center.
   Wallack on Thursday announced the beginning of the three-year
trial of the vaccine he has been testing for 15 years.
   Melanoma, which strikes about 27,000 Americans each year, is
easily treated by removing the tumor if the disease is discovered
before cancer cells spread. But death rates can climb as high as 70
percent if it spreads to lymph nodes.
   The disease resists traditional chemical and radiation
treatments, making it the hardest skin cancer to treat, said
Wallack.
   Cancer vaccines aren't a new idea, and vaccines for various
cancers are being studied around the nation. Like others, Wallack's
aims to prevent the disease from recurring by energizing the body's
immune system to seek out and destroy stray malignant cells that
may have broken off tumors.
   ``We specifically activate the immune system against the
patient's melanoma,'' said Wallack, who will oversee the trials
involving at least 200 patients whose tumors have been recently
removed and whose lymph nodes have been invaded.
   It will be a double-blind study, meaning neither doctors nor
patients will know who gets the vaccine and who gets a placebo.
   The trials are beginning at the University of Florida; Duke
University in Durham, N.C.; the M.D. Anderson cancer institute in
Houston; the University of Alabama; and Emory University in
Atlanta, Wallack said.
   The vaccine is created by infecting four types of melanoma cells
with smallpox vaccine viruses. Membranes from the infected cells
are injected into patients weekly for 13 weeks, then biweekly for
the rest of a year.
   Wallack believes the smallpox ``wakes up'' the immune system,
prompting it to act against the cancer.
   Wallack plans to compare in follow-ups the cancer recurrence and
survival rates of the two groups of patients. He hopes to repeat
the results of early experiments, which helped at least 15 percent
of smaller numbers of patients.
   ``Surgery is very important to remove the primary lesion, and
also any (lymph) nodes that are positive. After this, that's when
this approach, specific immunotherapy, comes into play,'' he said.
   A different type of melanoma vaccine is being developed by Dr.
Philip Livingston of Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
   ``I'm not saying one is better than the other, but it's a
different approach,'' said Livingston, whose work uses purified
chemicals taken from cancer cells.
   Researchers wonder if extracts from the melanoma cells used in
Wallack's study will trigger immune systems for the dozens of types
of melanoma, Livingston said.
   ``It's a little bit of a shot in the dark in that regard,'' he
said.
   Wallack said the four cell types he's using should prove
effective on all melanomas.
   Skin cancers are diagnosed in about 500,000 Americans each year
and are readily cured by surgical removal, except for advanced
melanoma, recent American Cancer Society figures show. Of about
7,800 annual skin cancer deaths, 5,800 were melanoma victims.

1.6.;    Chronic sun exposure causes wrinkling, coarsening, splotches and a
loss of skin elasticity and may lead to skin cancer, according to the Skin
Cancer Foundation.;    The sun's rays also have been linked to the increasing
incidence of malignant melanoma in the United States, which is growing faster
than any other cancer, according to the American Cancer Society.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Longterm Studies Show Drug Erases Wrinkles of Aging</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Studies lasting almost two years have confirmed
earlier findings that tretinoin, a vitamin A acid derivative, is
able to help smooth skin wrinkles and repair some damage of aging
and sunlight exposure.
   Dr. John J. Voorhees of the University of Michigan Medical School
said Monday that use of tretinoin cream on a small group of patients
over 22 months has shown the drug can cause the skin to repair some
of the marks left by time and to erase some blemishes.
   ``Whatever type of wrinkling that has occurred, treatment from
(tretinoin) will improve,'' Voorhees said in a report at the annual
meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology.
   In a report published last January in the Journal of the American
Medical Association, Voorhees said that a four-month study using
tretinoin cream caused fine skin wrinkles to disappear on the face
and arms.
   He said Monday that study has now been extended to 22 months and
that 21 patients have remained in the experiment from the beginning.
   Careful photographic analysis of treated areas of the skin on the
arms and face, he said, have shown that the drug has erased many
fine wrinkles, caused a lightening of so-called liver spots and
caused improvements in deep wrinkles, skin sagging and droopy
eyelids.
   Voorhees said examination of skin samples by electron microscope
shows that skin treated with tretinoin develops new collagen fiber,
a natural substance that lends elasticity to the skin and helps
prevent wrinkles. He said the sample skin also showed that blood
vessels are dilated, which helps improve skin color, and that the
skin actually thickens.
   The continuing studies, said Voorhees, shows ``the longer you use
it, the better it works.''
   In another study, James J. Leyden of the University of
Pennsylvania said he assessed the drug in a double blind study using
40 patients, half of whom received tretinoin cream, and half
received cream without the drug.
   To measure the precise effect, silicone molds were taken of the
``laugh line'' area around the eyes of the patients. These molds
were analyzed by computer and the wrinkles were given numerical
values. At the end of six months, more molds were made.
   Leyden said those who received the tretinoin cream showed a 32
percent reduction in fine wrinkles and a 22 percent reduction in
deeper skin furrows.
   Dr. Barbara A. Gilchrest of Boston University School of Medicine
said the application of tretinoin, a vitamin A acid derivative, has
been shown in studies to reduce the number and size of skin lesions
called actinic keratoses.
   Dr. Barbara A. Gilchrest of Boston University School of Medicine
said tretinoin ``is the most exciting thing to happen in the field
of skin aging in this century. It allows for the possibility that
some aspects of skin aging can be reversed.''
   But she added that the drug is only for those who are willing to
put up with ``weeks or even months of soreness or peeling'' to
achieve skin improvements that may be slow and ``subtle.''
   ``I tell patients not to expect miracles, and that the changes
will be subtle,'' she said. ``The benefits, as we understand them
now, will be largely cosmetic.''
   Gilchrest said preliminary findings in year-long studies at 10
medical centers shows that tretinoin acts on cells in the actinic
keratoses lesions to prevent them from turning into cancer.
Precisely how the drug works, she said, is not understood.
   But she said the findings suggest that tretinoin, in addition to
correcting skin wrinkling, also may help prevent a common type of
skin cancer.
   Actinic keratoses are dry, scaly spots on the skin that don't
heal normally and can sometimes develop into squamous cell
carcinoma, a type of skin cancer.
   Tretinoin, which is marketed by Ortho Pharmaceuticals under the
brand name Retin-A, is authorized by the Food and Drug
Administration for the treatment of acne. The drug has been used
experimentally for the treatment of aging, but has not yet been
approved by the FDA for that use.
   Voorhees said studies now are under way directed toward clearing
tretinoin for the treatment of wrinkles and other skin damage caused
by exposure to sunlight.
   Albert M. Kligman, a University of Pennsylvania professor who
first reported the anti-wrinkling effects of tretinoin, said he
believes that patients who want the full benefits of the drug ``must
make a lifelong commitment'' to applying the cream at least three
times weekly to get its full benefit.
   He said patients ``can go to a minimum dosage'' after one or two
years using the cream and that this will continue to prevent the
skin aging.
   Voorhees said the cost of Retin-A, which can sold only with a
perscription, is about $14.50 for a month's supply.

<HEAD>Scientists Locate Gene Underlying Inherited Melanoma</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have located a gene responsible for
irregularly shaped moles that are a major underlying cause of fatal
skin cancer.
   The gene causes moles known as dysplastic nevi, which often run
in families. The moles can become cancerous, resulting in malignant
melanoma.
   Unlike other forms of skin cancer, melanoma is often fatal. Most
cases are not inherited, but about 10 percent of cases occur in
people with a family history of the disease.
   In the research, scientists came closer to locating the gene
involved in inherited melanoma, although they have not yet isolated
it.
   They said their work ``provides a starting point for the use of
molecular techniques to identify the gene for the disorder and
characterize its function.''
   The research was directed by Dr. Sherri J. Bale of the National
Cancer Institute and was published in today's New England Journal
of Medicine.
   They said that finding the gene and learning the protein it
makes should help scientists understand the causes of inherited
melanoma.
   The research was based on genetic studies of 99 relatives and 26
spouses in six families where melanoma is common. Thirty-four
family members had malignant melanoma, and 31 of these also had
dysplastic nevi. Twenty-four other relatives had dysplastic nevi
alone.

<HEAD>Baucus Announces He Has Skin Cancer During Ozone Hearing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., was chairing a
hearing on damage to the ozone layer Friday when he announced that
protecting the Earth from the sun's killing rays had suddenly
become very personal.
   Motioning to the back of his neck, he said, ``Three and a half
hours ago, my dermatologist called me up and told me I have basal
cell carcinoma.
   ``It's fine. It could be taken care of,'' he assured witnesses
who had come before his subcommittee on environmental protection.
``But I understand that it is somewhat caused by ultraviolet rays.''
   Basal cell carcinoma, the most common form of skin cancer, comes
primarily from exposure to ultraviolet radiation in sunlight. It
strikes between 300,000 and 400,000 people a year, according to the
American Academy of Dermatology. It can cause disfigurement, but it
does not spread like other cancers and has a 95 percent cure rate.
   Baucus' subcommittee was gathering testimony on legislative
proposals to reduce use of chlorofluorocarbons, known as CFCs,
which poke holes in the ozone layer and let the ultraviolet rays
through.
   CFCs, used in refrigerants and some industrial cleaning
materials, are non-toxic when released, but break apart into other
chemical substances 10 to 100 years later as they slowly build up
and rise into the stratosphere, poking holes in the ozone.
   Witnesses on Friday testified about the pros and cons of
charging fees on excess profits from the production of CFCs, and
the feasibility of using recycling as a way to minimize release of
CFCs during manufacturing.

<TEXT>     "If you look hard enough, every adult individual has at least one mole,"
says Dr. Richard Sagebiel, head of the melanoma clinic at the University of
California and Mount Zion in San Francisco. "Many people have only one, or a
very hard-to-find one.";    All it takes is one abnormal mole to trigger the
start of melanoma, a form of skin cancer linked to sun exposure that can be
fatal. If untreated, melanoma spreads throughout the body. It is expected to
strike 32,000 people this year, according to the American Academy of
Dermatology, and kill 6,500 of them.;    In recent years, the number of
melanoma cases has been increasing annually by 5 percent. Doctors are unsure
what is causing the increase, but say that severe childhood sunburns play a
role in developing melanoma in later years. Others blame increasing melanoma
on depletion of the Earth's ozone layer, which blocks out the dangerous
ultraviolet rays of the sun.;    Most moles are harmless and require no
treatment. But when they change in size, shape or color, or begin suddenly to
itch or bleed, they should be examined by a dermatologist who can evaluate
whether they should be removed.;    "Any mole that's changing should be
investigated," says Sagebiel. He adds, "If you have over 100 moles, you
probably should have them evaluated.";    Moles often start in childhood but
still occur in adulthood. They are formed by pigment-making cells called
melanocytes that come together, perhaps in response to prolonged sun
exposure.;    Most adults have about 20 to 30 moles. Sagebiel is studying
people who have large numbers of normal moles to see if they have a genetic
predisposition to melanoma.;    One previous study found that people with more
than 100 normal moles were almost 10 times more likely to develop melanoma
than those who had 10 or less. Those who had between 50 to 100 moles were five
times as likely as the others to get melanoma.;    "It is a very big risk
factor," says Elizabeth Holly, an epidemiologist who worked with Sagebiel on
the study.;    Sunburns, light coloring;    What kind of people tend to have a
lot of moles? "It's not necessarily the most light-skinned people," Holly
says. "It varies.";    There are plenty of factors other than the number of
moles that can influence whether someone gets melanoma. Those factors include
the tendency to burn rather than tan and light eye, hair or skin color.;   
The single most important step people can take to lessen their chance of
developing melanoma, doctors say, is to stay out of the sun or, if they can't,
to wear a sunscreen. Those who live close to the equator, where sunlight is
strongest, need to be more careful than those who don't.;    "People who grew
up in Los Angeles have a higher risk than those who grew up in Seattle," says
Dr. Tom Mack, professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern
California.;    The second important step people can take is to see a doctor
if they notice any unusual change in moles or freckles.;    "Anything that
calls your attention to it compared to a year ago" should be checked by a
dermatologist, Sagebiel says. He also urges other doctors to give their
patients' moles a careful exam: "It may look ordinary and benign. But if the
patient says it's changed, you should pay attention to it," he says.;    Catch
it early;    Experts also suggest that people consult a dermatologist, rather
than a general practice doctor, when they have questions about their moles.;  
 The trick to beating melanoma is to catch it early. If it has not spread
beyond a small contained area of the body, there is a 90 percent chance of
living beyond five years. But if it has spread to distant parts of the body,
the chance of surviving beyond five years plunges to 20 percent.;    Sagebiel
urges people to avoid delaying a trip to the dermatologist if they are worried
about a suspicious mole.;    "I see too many patients in the melanoma clinic,"
he says.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Blood Substitute Shows Promise, Researcher Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A chemical cousin of Teflon is showing promise as
a blood substitute in animals and may one day help stroke patients,
a researcher says.
   ``It's chemically pretty inert - pretty non-toxic - (and) could
be stored fairly easily without fear of contamination with virus or
bacteria or dirt,'' said Robert A. Linsenmeier, associate professor
of biomedical engineering and neurobiology and physiology at
Northwestern University.
   The blood substitute is made of a class of chemicals called
fluorocarbons. Teflon is also a fluorocarbon, a carbon-based
compound in which most or all hydrogen ions have been replaced by
fluorine atoms, Linsenmeier said.
   Different fluorocarbons have different physical properties, he
said, adding that the blood substitute he and his colleagues are
testing is a thick, milky fluid made by Alliance Pharmaceutical
Corp. of San Diego.
   In stroke patients, doctors may one day be able to inject some
of the artificial blood soon after the stroke and boost the oxygen
supply to affected brain tissue.
   The findings in tests on eight cats by Linsenmeier and Thomas K.
Goldstick, professor of chemical engineering and biomedical
engineering, were to be presented this month by their
co-researcher, Rod Braun, at the annual meeting of the American
Institute of Chemical Engineers in Chicago.
   Now, only one form of artificial blood is approved by the Food
and Drug Administration for use in humans - a fluorocarbon emulsion
called Fluosol, said Gary Schaer, director of the cardiac
catheterization laboratory at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical
Center in Chicago.
   But Fluosol is not effective in general transfusions, he said.
It is only useful in tiny quantities to keep heart muscle supplied
with oxygen during cardiac angioplasty.
   Schaer cautioned that any type of artificial blood still
undergoing only animal tests is years away from potential use in
humans.

<HEAD>Genes May Be Key to Skin Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 40 percent of people probably carry a genetic
susceptibility to the most common forms of skin cancer no matter
how fair their skin is, researchers reported.
   Scientists from the University of Miami and the Veterans
Administration Medical Center in Miami reported in the Journal of
Investigative Dermatology that there is a genetically distinct
group inclined to develop skin cancer.
   Scientists have known for some time that too much sun can cause
skin cancer, but the research team concluded a genetic
predisposition in tandem with overexposure also may play a role.
   Dr. Howard Koh, associate professor of dermatology and medicine
and public health at Boston University, was not familiar with the
study but noted the importance of such research.
   ``Skin cancer is the No. 1 cancer in the United States estimated
at up to 600,000 cases a year,'' Koh said. ``Non-melanoma skin
cancer rarely kills a person but its impact on quality of life and
the morbidity of it is really considerable.''
   Dr. J. Richard Taylor and colleagues studied people using
ultraviolet light exposure and a drug to test the body's immune
response. Neither the drug nor short bursts of ultraviolet light
exposure were harmful to study participants, he said.
   Study subjects who never had skin cancer developed a rash that
showed they had the immune system cells needed to fight a
cancer-causing assault. None of the volunteers who previously had
cancer developed the rash, Taylor said.

<HEAD>Non-Cancerous Patch Of Skin Removed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dermatologist removed a small patch of skin
from Nancy Reagan's upper lip and tests show it to be
non-cancerous, her spokeswoman said Thursday.
   ``It was from too much sun,'' Mrs. Reagan's press secretary,
Elaine Crispen, said.
   The first lady ``had a little scraping'' done to remove the skin
patch and no stiches were required, Mrs. Crispen said. She was
informed of the results of the tests on Monday, the spokeswoman
added.
   The procedure was performed at the White House over the weekend
by Adm. William Narva, a U.S. Naval dermatologist who is the
attending physician to Congress, the spokeswoman said.
   The first lady wore a small adhesive bandage for two days but is
no longer wearing one, Mrs. Crispen said.
   The procedure marked the second time the first lady has had a
growth removed from the area. In 1982, a growth was removed that
was diagnosed as a basal cell carcinoma.
   Last August, President Reagan had a skin cancer identified as a
basal cell epithelioma removed from the tip of his nose. It was his
third procedure in three years dealing with skin cancer.
   In their younger days and as residents of California, Reagan and
his wife spent many hours in the sun. Since their bouts with skin
cancer, they have changed their habits, wearing sunblock and hats
when they venture outdoors and advising others to do the same.

   Patient trials are beginning on a
vaccine to prevent recurrence of melanoma, a hard-to-treat skin
cancer that strikes about 27,000 Americans eash year, the vaccine's
developer said Thursday.
   ``What it means is there is potential for some hope, and perhaps
we're going to be able to immunize a patient against potential
recurrence,'' said Marc Wallack, a cancer specialist and chairman
of general surgery at Mount Sinai Medical Center.
   He is coordinating a three-year study on at least 200 patients
around the nation who have had melanomas surgically removed but are
at high risk of the cancer returning, spreading and killing them.
   The trials are under way at the University of Florida; Duke
University in Durham, N.C.; M.D. Anderson cancer institute in
Houston; the University of Alabama; and Emory University in
Atlanta, he said.
   Cancer vaccines aren't a new idea, and vaccines for various
cancers are being studied around the nation. They aim to prevent
cancers from returning by ``waking up'' the body's immune system so
it will seek out and destroy cancer cells that may have broken off
a tumor and migrated, thus escaping surgical removal.
   Dr. Philip Livingston of Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New
York is working on a different type of vaccine for melanoma, which
resists traditional chemical and radiation therapies.
   ``I'm not saying one is better than the other, but it's a
different approach,'' said Livingston, whose work uses purified
chemicals taken from cancer cells, while Wallack's uses cancer-cell
membranes mixed with smallpox vaccine virus.
   In Wallack's ``vaccinia melanoma oncolysates'' vaccine, four
types of melanoma cells are infected with smallpox vaccine viruses.
Membranes from infected cells are injected into patients weekly for
13 weeks, and then bi-weekly for the remainder of one year.
Smallpox energizes the immune system, alerting it to the cancer, he
believes.
   The study is double-blind, meaning neither doctors nor patients
know who is getting vaccine and who is injected with a placebo.
During follow-ups, Wallack will compare the cancer recurrence and
survival rates of the two groups of patients.
   Researchers wonder if extracts from the four melanoma cells used
in Wallack's study will trigger immune systems for the dozens of
types of melanoma, Livingston said.
   ``It's a little bit of a shot in the dark in that regard,'' he
said.
   Wallack said the four cell types he's using should prove
effective on all melanomas. And if his preliminary test results are
repeated, the vaccine will help at least 15 percent of the
patients, he said.
   Skin cancers are diagnosed in about 500,000 Americans each year
and are readily cured by surgical removal _ except for advanced
melanoma, recent American Cancer Society figures show. Of about
7,800 annual skin cancer deaths, 5,800 involved melanoma.

   Barbara Bush kept an active schedule Friday,
saying she felt great following minor skin-cancer surgery that left
her with a slightly swollen lip and a row of stitches below her
nose.
   The first lady was cheerful and energetic as she toured an
interior decorating exhibit benefitting the Washinton Home, a
health care and hospice program with which she has long been
associated.
   Smiling, but not broadly, she replied ``great'' when asked how
she felt following the outpatient operation Wednesday to remove a
small basal cell cancer on her upper lip.
   Her press secretary, Anna Perez, said Mrs. Bush still has some
soreness when she smiles. On Thursday, she told children at a New
York day-care center, ``Don't make me laugh.''
   Accompanied by daughter-in-law Margaret Bush, Mrs. Bush met
several individuals who had rooms of their homes duplicated in the
exhibit, titled ``Entertaining Alfresco.''
   Mrs. Bush's lip was almost imperceptibly swollen. The dozen
stitches were not visible from a few feet away.
   The first lady attended a private luncheon for the exhibit
before travelling to Kennebunkport, Maine, to spend a long weekend
with President Bush at their seaside vacation home.
   On Thursday, Mrs. Bush said the operation had been performed to
remove ``a small cancer that you get because you were stupid and
sat in the sun all your life.''
   Basal cell carcinomas are common skin cancers that occur most
often on the face or areas of skin exposed to the sun.

<HL> Natural Tan: To Fend Off the Sun, Researchers Are Using Body's Own Chemistry --- They Put Melanin, a Pigment In Skin, Into Products To Block Harmful Rays --- Bronzed Like a Red Chicken </HL>

   For centuries, humans have smeared countless elixirs on their skin to ward off sunburn or soothe its painful effects. 
Now, scientists say they are on to the ultimate tonic, one derived from the body's own chemistry and one that, when harnessed, may prove the most potent sun protection of all: melanin. 

   Melanin is the dark pigment the body produces to protect against damage from sunlight, especially burning ultraviolet rays. 
It is what makes black people black and gives light-skinned people a tan. 

   If the efforts of several enterprising scientists pan out, retailers soon may be selling a variety of melanin-based products to the sun-fearing as well as the sun-loving. 
A small California company is developing a melanin ointment that blocks the entire spectrum of burning ultraviolet rays and washes off at night with soap and water. 
In Arizona, researchers are testing an ointment that stimulates the skin to produce a natural melanin tan before you go out in the sunlight. 
And in Texas, a scientist is fashioning melanin-impregnated eyeglasses and contact lenses that protect the eyes from sun damage, and melanin-coated windows that prevent sun bleaching of art works and draperies. 

   "Melanin's time has come," says James Gallas, assistant professor of physics at the University of Texas at San Antonio and the researcher developing melanin-based eyeglasses. 

   The outcome of the research is bound to get plenty of attention. 
Doctors and the public are more anxious these days about the risk of exposing too much skin to too much sun. 
Because of America's increased penchant for playing in the sun and for wearing shorts, T-shirts and bikinis, the incidence of skin cancer in the U.S. is growing at a faster rate than the population. 
This year 500,000 people will develop the malignancies, the American Cancer Society estimates. 
Particularly alarming is the incidence of malignant melanoma, a once-rare form of skin cancer that kills quickly. 
Cases of melanoma have jumped more than sixfold since World War II and this year will afflict 27,000 Americans and kill 5,800, the society says. 

   Reports that pollution is thinning the ozone layer high in the Earth's atmosphere are heightening worries about skin cancer. 
The depletion of this layer of charged oxygen molecules will allow more of the sun's ultraviolet radiation to reach the surface of the Earth, and the incidence of skin cancer probably will climb even faster, health officials say. 

   Whether any or all of the proposed new melanin-based products ever reach the consumer is uncertain at this stage. 
For the most part, tests in humans haven't yet been done. 
Even if the human trials are successful the products' safety and efficacy would still face the scrutiny of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
And it isn't certain that consumers would rush to melanin-based products with the same alacrity they are showing for, say, Retin A (to remove wrinkles) or minoxidil (to fight baldness). 

   Nature offers its own proof of melanin's effectiveness in preventing sun-induced skin cancer. 
Black and dark-skinned people, whose ancestors adapted to a climate of intense, year-round sunlight, rarely develop such malignancies. 
Their melanin-producing system keeps the skin constantly filled with the dark pigment. 

   Light-skinned people are able to produce as much melanin as dark-skinned people but it is a different type, and leaves them more susceptible to skin cancer. 
Their Northern European ancestors had to adapt to a climate where sunny days were few and short and it was important for the skin to absorb sunlight to produce vitamin D. Thus, light-skinned people have a type of melanin that builds up only after the skin is threatened by repeated sunburn and fades quickly when the threat diminishes. 

   As protection against the sun, melanin can't be beat, the researchers say. Mr. Gallas says melanin filters the wavelengths of light in proportion to the damage that each wavelength does to the skin. Thus, it blocks most of the highly dangerous invisible ultraviolet waves and much of the visible blue. "But even green and red are bad, not as bad as ultraviolet and blue, but still bad," Mr. Gallas says. Melanin also blocks some of these
   In contrast, the sunglasses and sunblocking lotions currently on the market block only the most dangerous part of ultraviolet light, although some newer products are promoted as "blue blockers." 

   Although chemists have been able to synthesize melanin for some years, it is insoluble and sticky and, thus, hasn't been incorporated into commercially usable formulations. 
One company that believes it has overcome this problem is Advanced Polymer Systems Inc. in Redwood City, Calif. 

   Advanced Polymer has a technique for incorporating various substances, including melanin, in microscopic plastic sponges. 
The transparent, melanin-containing sponges are tiny - -about the same size as the microscopic dots of melanin found inside the skin's melanin-producing cells. 
In bulk, the sponges have the texture and consistency of a cream. 
The company hopes to get federal clearance later this year to begin human tests of the melanin skin cream and to invade the $300 million-a-year sun-screen market in 1990. 
"We're developing a new line of skin protectants based on melanin produced by genetic engineering," says Sergio Nacht, vice president for research and development and a biochemist who has specialized in dermatology research. 

   The melanin cream, Mr. Nacht says, should be 10 times more effective than sun screens currently on the market, as it blocks the entire spectrum of solar ultraviolet light rather than just one portion of it. 
The melanin sponges are too big to be absorbed by the skin, so the researchers believe the cream shouldn't pose any health risks, Mr. Nacht contends. 

   Melanin cream will be waterproof and will stay on the skin until washed off with soap, Mr. Nacht says. 
But there is one problem: The lotion isn't clear and actually colors the skin wherever it is smeared on. 
The researchers hope consumers will see this as an advantage, rather than drawback. 
They say they have developed cosmetically pleasing tints that will give users the appearance of being tanned, albeit temporarily. 

   The melanin for the Melanosponges, as the company has dubbed them, is being made through a new type of genetic engineering developed by another small California company, Biosource Genetics Corp. in Vacaville. 

   Biosource has a novel technique by which a plant-infecting virus is genetically engineered to introduce a new gene into grown plants, Robert L. Erwin, president, explains. 
The new gene changes the chemicals a plant produces internally. 
All one has to do is spray the virus on the leaves of the right kind of plant and it soon will begin producing the desired chemical. 
Unlike other plant genetic engineering techniques, the new gene isn't passed on to offspring, nor does it spread to other plants. 
Instead, it dies with the plant, Mr. Erwin says. 

   The company is currently producing experimental quantities of melanin by infecting plant cell cultures with a genetically engineered virus, Mr. Erwin says. 
The plant cells normally produce a mix of chemicals that happen to be raw materials for melanin. 
The new technique inserts a gene that causes the cells to make an enzyme that converts these precursors into melanin. 

   Should Advanced Polymer's melanin sun-blocking cream prove successful and large quantities of melanin be needed, Biosource would switch to applying the virus to growing plants, probably broccoli, cabbage or related plants, which contain the right precursors. 
He envisions greenhouses full of plants producing hundreds of kilograms of melanin that eventually would be smeared on thousands of human bodies. 

   Because melanin is ubiquitous in nature, Biosource has a wide choice of melanin-producing genes to choose from to get exactly the right kind of melanin for the cream. 
It currently is using a bacterial gene in the plant cells and is investigating other genes including one in Rhode Island Red chickens, which makes the melanin that produces the chickens' distinctive color. 

   For those who might want a permanent tan, Prof. Mac E. Hadley a University of Arizona endocrinologist, and a colleague, chemist Victor J. Hruby, may have an answer. 
The two have developed a chemical variation of melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), the hormone that activates the skin's melanin-producing cells, the melanocytes. 
When the chemical is rubbed on the skin, it soaks through and quickly begins activating melanin cells throughout the body. 
So, one could get a natural, whole-body tan before going out in the sunlight and much more quickly than normal, without any white areas left from bathing trunks and halters. 
"Soon there will be no need for tanning parlors," Mr. Hadley claims. 

   The invention has just been licensed by the university's agent to "a major producer of dermatological products," Mr. Hadley says, declining to name the company. 
The first human trials to test for safety are under way, he adds. 

   The melanin-impregnated plastics for sunglasses, contact lens and window panes under development by Mr. Gallas in San Antonio also have generated commercial interest. 
"We've already signed 15 secrecy agreements" with companies that want to look at the inventions, the physicist says. 
He adds that he expects to sign licensing agreements soon. 

   Mr. Gallas says he began looking into melanin about five years ago when he was working on solar energy and was looking for materials that absorb sunlight. 
As he investigated melanin's properties, he says, "it seemed reasonable to put it into a lens to protect the eye" from solar radiation. 
He tackled the problem of how to get the sticky synthetic melanin incorporated into plastic and already has produced some experimental eyeglasses, though he won't explain how. 
In appearance, the glasses range from brown to a yellow amber, depending on how concentrated the melanin is, he says. 

   The first of the eye-protection products, Mr. Gallas says, probably will be contact lenses and the intraocular lenses implanted after cataract surgery. 
Medical evidence is growing that long years of exposure to ultraviolet rays prompts cataracts. 
Melanin-impregnated contact lenses could help prevent this sort of damage while intraocular lenses could, in addition, help protect the retina. 

   The physicist also is working on melanin-coated windows that could be used where valuable items -- such as books, paintings, photographs and fabrics -- need to be protected from light. 
Since melanin doesn't totally block any color of the visible light spectrum, such windows wouldn't distort the colors of paintings and fabrics. 
In fact, the scientist says, colors stand out sharper and clearer when viewed through melanin-impregnated plastic. 

   Which gives these researchers heart. 
If all else fails, melanin products may still profoundly affect modern life in at least one way. 
"One unexpected finding was that even the color of television images is enhanced" when viewed through melanin glass, Mr. Gallas says.

   A 29-year study of cancer in Sweden
shows the rate of cases increased faster among women than men,
especially skin cancer caused by too much sun.
   Malignant melanoma caused by overexposure to ultraviolet rays
was increasing by 6.6 percent a year and ine 1987 represented 3.5
percent of all cancer cases, said Jerzy Einhorn of the Karolinska
Hospital.
   A law requiring doctors to report all cancer cases to a national
registrar since 1958 has yielded ``a unique foundation'' for health
care and planning, since it covers 100 percent of the population in
specific areas, Einhorn said.
   The study, released Tuesday by the hospital, covered Stockholm
and Gotland, a large rural island in the Baltic.
   Sven Tornqvist, who was in charge of the register, said the rate
of all forms of cancer increased by 29 percent for women and 15
percent for men in the Swedish capital from 1958 to 1987. The
figures were higher in Gotland.
   Malignant melanoma ``could become the major form of cancer in
the next century'' because many people who have damaged their skin
have not yet developed the disease, Einhorn said.
   He attributed the increase among Swedes to their more frequent
holiday trips to warmer countries and their penchant for sunbathing.
   One reason for the general rising incidence of cancers is that
people are living longer, Einhorn said.
   Lung cancer was the most common cancer, but it decreased among
men along with a decline in smoking.

   Americans lured by summertime's great outdoors are being
cautioned anew by dermatologists that the sunny side of the street _
or the mountain or the beach _ may not be the healthiest side to be
on.
   Physicians have long cautioned sun worshipers that too much
exposure to ultraviolet radiation can hasten the skin's aging and
wrinkling process, not to mention the possibility of skin cancer.
   Recent research indicates further depletion of the atmosphere's
protective ozone layer is letting through even more ultraviolet rays.
   ``The public is finally taking suncare protection very
seriously,'' says Dr. Frank Akin, senior director of clinical
research for Plough Inc., a Memphis-based manufacturer of suncare
products. ``Studies have shown one of every eight Americans develops
some form of skin cancer during his lifetime.''
   According to the American Cancer Society, 50 percent of those
reaching the age of 65 will develop at least one form of skin cancer.
   ``Older Americans have accumulated years of sun exposure,'' Akin
explains. ``Because many suffer from the worst type of skin damage,
our main concern at present is to halt the harm that has already
been done.
   ``As senior citizens enjoy their improving health in the pursuit
of sports and outdoor activities, they must take special care to
protect their skin from the sun _ be it while playing golf,
gardening, or even watching an outdoor baseball game.''
   Dermatologists recommend limiting the risks of overexposure by
using suncare products whenever spending time outdoors. Most
sunscreen lotions now use Sun Protection Factor (SPF) numbers
ranging from two to 30-plus.
   The SPF number indicates how many times longer a person can stay
in the sun before beginning to burn, when using the product, than
without any sunscreen at all. Sunscreens prevent damage because they
contain chemicals that absorb ultraviolet radiation.
   Generally, Akin says, an SPF 15 is recommended for protection of
most skin types, but during initial exposure to the summer sun it is
preferable to start with a higher SPF. After developing a base tan,
darker-skinned people may then move on to a lower SPF.
   ``However,'' he adds, ``there is need for greater protection in
certain cases. People with extra sensitive skin, people who live at
high altitudes, people who have had skin cancer and tourists
exposing their winter skin to tropical sunlight, all need greater
protection.''
   Other recommendations include:
   _ Limit sun exposure when the sun is at its strongest, between 11
a.m. and 3 p.m.
   _ Be extra careful near highly reflective surfaces, such as sand,
water or snow.
   _ Check with your physician before going in the sun if you are
taking medication; some don't mix with the sun.
   _ Examine your skin regularly, look for any irregularities,
differences in color or shading _ and if you notice any changes,
consult a physician immediately.

   People with one or more of six
characteristics run higher than normal risks of getting the
deadliest form of skin cancer, a new study suggests.
   Because of its high curability in early stages, and the ease in
identifying likely susceptible people, ``no one should die from
melanoma,'' said researcher Darrell Rigel of New York University.
   Melanoma is expected to kill 6,300 Americans this year,
according to the American Cancer Society. Some 27,600 new cases of
melanoma, caused chiefly by excessive exposure to the sun, are
expected this year.
   Rigel described the new study Sunday at a science writers
conference sponsored by the cancer society. The work included data
from 200 people with or without melanoma, and considered 43
possible factors that might have been found to contribute to the
disease.
   Six factors appeared to raise the risk of melanoma: blond or red
hair; marked freckling of the upper back; the presence of rough red
bumps on the skin called actinic keratoses that come from sun
exposure; a history of other family members with melanoma; a
history of three or more blistering sunburns during the teen-age
years; and having spent three or more years at an outdoor summer
job as a teen-ager.
   Having any one or two of these factors gives a person a three to
four times increased chance of developing melanoma, the study
suggested. The combination of three or more factors gave an
increase of 20 to 25 times, Rigel said.
   The overall risk of getting melanoma for Americans is estimated
to be about one in 120, Rigel said.
   It was one in 250 in 1980 and is forecast to be one in 90 in the
year 2000, he said. Scientists blame much of the trend on increases
in the time people spend on the beach, and skimpier swimsuits.
   Because melanoma takes 10 to 20 years to appear after damage
from the sun, Rigel said, the behavior of people in the 1960s and
1970s has only recently begun to show up in melanoma rates.
   Lawrence Garfinkel, the cancer society's vice president for
epidemiology and statistics, said previous research gives ``good
evidence'' to support the conclusions of Rigel's study of risk
factors.
   Rigel said people at high risk of melanoma should learn the
so-called ``ABCD'' method of identifying melanoma early.
   The ``A'' refers to the asymmetry of melanoma's mole-like
growth, in which one half does not match the other. ``B'' stands
for border irregularity, because the edges of the growth are
ragged, notched or blurred.
   ``C'' refers to color, which varies within the growth. And ``D''
stands for the growth's diameter of greater than six millimeters,
about the size of a pencil eraser.
   Rigel said research suggests that if melanoma is detected while
the lesions are still thinner than about one thirty-second of an
inch, the 15-year survival rate is about 98 percent. In contrast,
if lesions are more than about one-eighth of an inch thick when the
cancer is discovered, the survival rate is about 53 percent, he
said.
   Melanoma spreads to other parts of the body more quickly than
many other cancers, he said. A melanoma growth that is the size of
a dime has probably already spread cancer cells elsewhere, he said.
   In a separate presentation, another researcher said experimental
treatments that use the body's disease-fighting immune system show
some promise against melanoma in early studies.
   One approach uses a ``theraccine,'' an abbreviation of
``therapeutic vaccine,'' so-named because it aims to fight cancer
rather than prevent disease, said Malcolm Mitchell of the
University of Southern California School of Medicine in Los Angeles.

   The Antarctic ``ozone hole'' apparently caused
record low ozone levels over southern Australia in 1987, said
scientists, who suggested that the hole may raise skin cancer risk
in the globe's southern latitudes.
   The work is the first detailed study that links the Antarctic
hole to observed ozone declines in the Southern Hemisphere's
midlatitudes, where many people live, scientists said.
   The study concludes that record low ozone levels over southern
Australia and New Zealand were caused mainly by the arrival of
ozone-poor air from the Antarctic hole.
   Southern South America and the southern tip of Africa also may
be vulnerable, said study co-author R. Alan Plumb.
   A layer of ozone, a form of oxygen, high in the atmosphere
shields Earth from ultraviolet rays in sunlight that cause skin
cancer. Reductions in ozone let more rays through and can boost
skin cancer rates.
   The Antarctic ozone hole, which appears for a limited time every
year, is an area in which up to 50 percent of ozone disappears.
   Plumb said that while he regards the declines observed over
Australia and New Zealand as relatively small, they could become
more hazardous.
   But Margaret Kripke, an immunologist who studies skin cancer,
said the increase in ultravolet rays implied by the ozone
observations is ``enormous.''
   Such increases could raise the risk of skin cancer, but it is
difficult to say by how much, said Kripke, chairman of the
immunology department at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center of the
University of Texas.
   Protection of the worldwide ozone shield has become a focus of
international concern that extends beyond the Antarctic ozone hole.
Last year, for example, scientists announced evidence that ozone
had declined about 2.3 percent since 1969 over a region that
includes most of the United States.
   In May, delegates from 81 countries at a U.N. conference pledged
to stop producing and using chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons,
which destroy ozone, by the year 2000.
   The new study was conducted by Plumb of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology; Paul Newman, of the Universities Space
Research Association and a visiting scientist at the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Space Flight Center in
Greenbelt, Md.; and researchers from Australia and New Zealand.
   It appears today in the British journal Nature.
   ``It makes a convincing case to me,'' commented William Mankin
of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.
   The Antarctic ozone hole was unusual in 1987, the study said.
Ozone levels reached record lows in October and November, and the
funnel-shaped wind pattern that sustained the hole disintegrated in
early December rather than November.
   With the disintegration of the wind pattern each year, streams
of polar air are ripped away and migrate north, the researchers
said.
   They concluded that the arrival of such ozone-poor air was the
chief factor in producing record low ozone levels over southern
Australia and New Zealand in December 1987.
   The levels reported over the Australian cities Melbourne and
Perth for much of the month were the lowest December readings since
measurements began in 1979.
   The Melbourne readings averaged about 7 percent below normal for
the month, which theoretically could boost the dose of ultraviolet
rays at the Earth's surface by 14 percent, Plumb said.
   Newman said Australians are typically on the beaches in
December, the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. As a
result, low ozone readings during that month are particularly
worrisome.
   For the most common skin cancers, which develop only after
decades of exposure to ultraviolet rays, a single episode of ozone
reduction may not have much effect, said Kripke.
   But reductions would pose a hazard if they continue for another
decade or so, she said.
   Some recent studies suggest that the risk of the deadliest skin
cancer, melanoma, may be increased by a single exposure to excess
ultraviolet rays, Kripke noted. But too little is known about the
causes of melanoma to gauge the risk of a single summer's exposure,
she said.

   Getting a tan in order to improve your looks
raises your risk of skin cancer, wrinkles, eye damage and changes
in the skin's immune system, a new report says.
   No health benefits are known from cosmetic tanning, except that
``tanned skin may have positive psychological value by creating an
enhanced image of personal worth,'' said the report by the American
Medical Association.
   The price can be high _ premature wrinkles, dryness and leathery
skin; a heightened risk of skin cancer; damage to the eyes, and
genetic changes that may compromise the skin's ability to fight
invaders, the report said.
   ``Despite the hazards, many people cannot be dissuaded from
sunbathing or using artificial tanning devices,'' said the report,
written by the Chicago-based AMA's Council on Scientific Affairs
and published in Friday's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
   The council recommended these guidelines for people who insist
on tanning:
   _Minimize exposure to ultraviolet radiation, the component of
sunlight that causes tanning and burning, by staying out of the sun
between 10 a.m and 2 p.m. and wearing a hat and protective clothing.
   _Beware of surfaces such as sand, snow, ice and concrete that
reflect sunlight and can intensify the effects of the sun's rays by
10 percent to 50 percent.
   _Use a sunscreen, with a sun protection factor of at least 15
for skin that burns easily or tans only gradually, or higher at
greater elevations or for other intensive exposures. A person
wearing a sunscreen with a protection factor of 15 would get the
same amount of radiation exposure after 15 hours in the sun as he
would in one hour if he were wearing no sunscreen.
   _Keep babies out of the sun as much as possible and apply
sunscreen to older youngsters who are to be outdoors for long
periods.
   _Avoid tanning machines. Exposure to their radiation may
increase the risk of skin cancer, even though most modern machines
use the ``safer'' form of ultraviolet light, called UV-A, rather
than the more dangerous form, UV-B.
   People with extremely fair skin or severe reactions to sunlight
should never use such booths, it said.
   If tanning equipment is used, people who tan moderately well
should limit their exposures to 30 to 50 half-hour sessions per
year or less, use a properly calibrated device with a timer, keep a
record of exposures, wear protective goggles and make sure an
attendant is nearby in case of an emergency, the report said.
   Becca Essman, executive director of the Suntanning Association
for Education, an industry group, reacted to the report by saying
that tanning parlor operators have already responded to medical
concerns about radiation.
   ``Tanning is a part of life that probably will never go away,''
she said in a telephone interview from the association's
headquarters in Frederick, Md. ``And we think indoor tanning
facilities give people in general an opportunity to not burn, to
avoid the overexposure.''
   The association's 1,500 member facilities make up about
one-quarter of the U.S. indoor tanning industry, Ms. Essman said.
   The group has drafted a code of ethics, developed a training
program for parlor operators and promotes safety measures, she said.
   The Council on Scientific Affairs is a 15-member panel of
doctors and other health specialists whose job is to compile the
latest scientific information on topics of interest to the AMA.

Scientists have pinpointed a rare, genetic flaw that makes people unusually 
sensitive to sunlight and predisposes them to skin cancer, it was reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
A Japanese team headed by Kiyoji Tanaka at Osaka University said it has 
discovered and made copies of a gene that when defective causes the most common 
type of a disease called xeroderma pigmentosum. 
</P>
<P>
About one in 250,000 people suffer from xeroderma pigmentosum, an inherited 
disease in which skin cells lack the normal ability to repair the damage the 
sun's ultraviolet light inflicts on genetic material. 
</P>
<P>
People with xeroderma pigmentosum must avoid exposure to sunlight. If they fail 
to do so, they run a high risk of developing skin cancer and potentially 
blinding growths on the eyelids and cornea.

SKIN CANCER SCREENING RESULTS DRAMATIZE SUN HAZARD, UCI DOCTORS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Some people in Orange County are apparently not listening: Too much sun is not 
good for you. Sun worshipers who frolic on the county's beaches without 
protection from the glare of cloudless skies may very likely get skin cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at UC Irvine's Melanoma Center say they know they sound like a broken 
record, but they figure many outdoors types in this county are still not paying 
attention. And now they have more evidence of that. 
</P>
<P>
During a skin cancer screening offered by the center during April and May, 1 of 
every 5 persons was diagnosed with skin cancer, while almost a third had 
precancerous lesions -- numbers that alarmed some doctors and others at the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
"We were really amazed at what we saw," said Leslie Ann Cyril, a spokesperson 
for the center. "Melanomas are being discovered in much younger people. That's 
what's so surprising." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Matthew Goodman, co-director of the melanoma center, cautioned that these 
results are not an accurate measure of skin cancer prevalence among the general 
population, nor was this meant as a scientific study. The 175 people who were 
screened, he said, probably likely suspected they might have a problem with 
skin abnormalities, including skin cancer. However, he said, results of this 
screening echo trends in national studies showing that skin cancer is on the 
rise, especially among people who live in sunny Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"It reiterates the need to use good judgment in our sun habits and the use of a 
sun screen with an SPF (Sun Protection Factor) of 15 or greater," he said. "It 
shows that it could happen to you." 
</P>
<P>
He also said it is an indication that there is still a great need for better 
educational programs warning about the dangers of the sun in this county of 
sunny beaches and endless summers. The melanoma center, which opened in 1986 at 
the UCI Clinical Cancer Center and is the only such center in Orange County, 
has started some educational programs for elementary school children, Cyril 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The American Cancer Society estimates that 60,000 people will develop skin 
cancer during 1990, a 4% increase from last year. Of those, 27,600 will be 
diagnosed with melanoma, the most serious form, and the Cancer Society 
estimates that 6,300 people will die from melanoma this year. 
</P>
<P>
That is why Matthews said he could not overstate the need for caution and 
prevention. The cancer center plans to offer another screening in the fall, he 
said, and he encouraged people in Orange County, especially those who engage in 
outdoor activity, to get themselves checked out. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion it is related to the popularity of the masses going to the beach 
and other outdoor recreation as much as they have in the last few years, almost 
to a fanatic extreme," he said. "Well, don't say fanatic extreme, because I 
think outdoor recreation is great and good. But people should be prudent." 
</P>
<P>
But Dore Gilbert, a Newport Beach dermatologist, said he thinks people living 
along the coast are well-informed about the dangers of overexposure. The higher 
incidence of skin cancer and melanoma cases, he said, could reflect an 
increased awareness among people who are seeking medical help earlier, before 
it is too late. 
</P>
<P>
"In this area, in Orange County and also in Los Angeles, people are very aware 
of melanoma," he said. "If you get out to more rural areas, areas away from the 
coast, you are going to find more people who say, 'It can't happen to me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Those, he said, are the people to worry about.

<HL> Morbid Ad For Sunscreen Raises Furor </HL>

<TEXT>
   Forget all those cheery advertisements for sunscreen lotions showing families frolicking at the beach. 
Now they're showing families mourning skin cancer victims in funeral parlors. 

   Eclipse Laboratories Inc. this month began running a controversial ad for its Skin Cancer Garde Sunblock lotion in which people dressed in black gaze into an open casket. 
The headline: "Here's how you can look with a healthy tan." 

   "It was a very difficult decision to run this ad because we don't want to offend people," says Steven Manenti, chairman of Eclipse. 
"But we're trying to create a substantial amount of awareness about our product and the prevalence of skin cancer." 

   Some dermatologists, however, are concerned that such scare tactics will mislead consumers. 
"The ad is deceptive because the chances of death from skin cancer are infinitesimally small," says Leonard Harber, chairman of the dermatology department at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. 
"I also wouldn't call it a very tasteful way of communicating about cancer to the public." 

   The ad notes that the Skin Cancer Foundation recommends Skin Cancer Garde. 
But despite its endorsement, the educational organization isn't fond of this particular ad. 
"People need to be aware of the serious damage skin cancer does, but I'm fearful of ads that imply a healthy tan will kill you," says Mitzi Moulds, the foundation's executive director. 
"On the other hand, I hope people won't take the ad as just tongue in cheek." 

   In small type, the ad does state that just 5,800 of the 241 million Americans will die this year of skin cancer and that "odds are it won't be your funeral." 
But later the ad also says that "soon one out of seven Americans will be affected by" skin cancer, without clearly explaining the chances for survival in those cases. 

   According to Ms. Moulds, most cases won't be "the big killer, malignant melanoma." 

   Thus far, the Skin Cancer Garde ad has appeared only in Spy, an irreverent magazine popular with trendy, young New Yorkers. 
"We thought we wouldn't get any negative vibes if we ran the ad first in Spy because its editorial matter is so offbeat," says Allan Ford, a marketing and media consultant for Eclipse. 
But the ad also may be submitted to Rolling Stone and USA Today, according to Irwin Goldberg, whose agency I. Goldberg &amp; Partners creates Eclipse's ads. 
"We fully expect to receive letters from people complaining that we're frightening them," he says. 
"It's a gutsy thing for us to do." 

   Spy hasn't received any letters from readers about the Skin Cancer Garde ad. 
But many people complained about another "coffin ad" last spring for Michael Max leather stores in New York. 
The ad showed a corpse dressed in leather with a tag on her toe listing the retailer's name. 
"Another fashion victim," the ad declared. 

   "I think these coffin ads are getting really gross," says Larry Hettleman, an advertising assistant at Spy. 
"I don't tend to buy things people are trying to scare me into buying."

   ATLANTA -- The death rate for malignant melanoma, a severe
form of skin cancer, is rising sharply in the U.S., according
to a new federal study.
   The Centers for Disease Control said yesterday that the
mortality rate among men jumped 50% between 1973 and 1988 to
3.3 per 100,000 from 2.2. Overall, the death rate for
malignant melanoma among men increased faster than for any
other cancer. By contrast, the mortality rate among women
over the same period rose 21% to 1.7 from 1.4 per 100,000.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The biggest increase in mortality occurred among men age
50 and older, with a peak rise of 78% for men age 80 to 84.
   The data for the study came from cancer cases in nine
locations: Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico and Utah;
and Atlanta, Detroit, San Franciso/Oakland and Seattle/Puget
Sound.
   The CDC cited increased recreational exposure to sunlight
as one of the primary causes of the increases.

ASK SANTA Monica State Beach lifeguard Jackie Burke about her skin-care routine 
and she starts spouting off SPF numbers. "A 40 on my lips, 30 on my face, 15 on 
my arms and chest and 6 on my legs," says the blue-eyed blonde just before 
ripping off her regulation red jacket and white T-shirt and jumping into the 
Pacific for a save. 
</P>
<P>
Protecting herself from the ravages of the sun is Burke's biggest concern, so 
she takes extra care to apply sunscreen lotions with higher SPF levels where 
her skin is more sensitive. To combat the drying effects of the sun after 
exposure, she also moisturizes her face and conditions her hair daily. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California lifeguards like Burke realize that spending eight hours on 
the beach every workday can make sun-induced skin cancer an occupational 
hazard. Many who used to wear deep-bronze tans like badges of honor can almost 
pass for pale office workers, even after an entire summer in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the information about skin cancer and premature aging of the skin started 
coming out, lifeguards jumped right on it," says a decidedly untanned Matt 
Karl, who has been a Huntington Beach lifeguard for the past nine years. Karl 
now wears a long-sleeved T-shirt every day, in addition to an SPF 30 sunscreen 
lotion, to protect his fair skin. "Once you hear about another guard getting 
cancer," he says, "you think about it every day." 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-four-year-old Howard Lee, chief lifeguard of the Los Angeles County 
Department of Beaches and Harbor, has worked the beaches for 36 years. He had 
manned a guard tower for about 12 years when he developed skin cancer on his 
lip, and he recently had more cancerous cells removed from his shoulder. 
"Thirty years ago, we used baby oil to fry our skin," remembers Lee, who also 
has no semblance of a tan today. "It's not uncommon for (veteran) lifeguards to 
develop skin cancer. Now, because we have more knowledge, the guards check 
unusual skin conditions early, before they become cancerous." 
</P>
<P>
Although the county has no regulations about skin protection for lifeguards, 
Lee distributes advisory information at least twice each summer to notify his 
team of lifeguards about the latest developments in skin cancer research and 
sun protection. He also encourages the men and women to wear protective 
clothing such as hats and Windbreakers. But the decision to take these 
precautions is up to each individual, he explains. "When there's a lot of 
rescue activity going on, it's not always possible to keep a shirt and hat on." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Bitler, who has been a lifeguard at Will Rogers State Beach for 17 years, 
says that only the new lifeguards appear to feel invulnerable to the sun and 
still go after a tan. By contrast, he wears an SPF 15 sunscreen and a jacket 
most days and sees a dermatologist for checkups -- just in case there might be 
early signs of the disease. "You start taking precautions as soon as your older 
co-workers start developing skin problems -- or as soon as you see the first 
signs of aging on your own skin," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, Christian Henry has spent six months of the year working as a 
Huntington Beach lifeguard. Bombarded by the media and his supervisors with 
information about the dangers of the sun, he's become extra cautious. Now he 
wears a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses with ultraviolet light protection, and 
he slathers on SPF 30. He also applies moisturizer to keep his skin supple. But 
despite his efforts, Henry's skin is tanned, a sign that it hasn't escaped 
unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
What is an occupational hazard for lifeguards is, of course, a recreational 
hazard for the general public. So lifeguards also spend time trying to protect 
sunbathers, especially those who coat themselves with baby oil or low-SPF 
tanning products. For Henry, observing sunburned beach-goers is one of the 
job's frustrations. "I see it happening every day, but by the time I warn them, 
it's usually too late -- they're already fried."

<BYLINE>Immune System May Battle Melanoma, Studies Suggest
^By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two strategies that boost the immune
system to battle the most dangerous form of skin cancer show
promise in early tests with patients, a researcher said Sunday.
   Twenty-three percent of patients showed evidence of some
remission of melanoma after injections in one of the experimental
treatments primed their bodies to attack certain proteins found on
melanoma cells, said Malcolm Mitchell.
   The injections are called theraccines, short for therapeutic
vaccines, because they seek to treat cancer rather than prevent
disease, he said.
   Mitchell, a professor of medicine and microbiology at the
University of Southern California School of Medicine in Los
Angeles, described the work at a science writers seminar sponsored
by the American Cancer Society.
   About 27,600 new cases of melanoma are expected this year, with
6,300 deaths, the society says. Intense exposure to the sun is a
chief cause.
   Mitchell's experimental injections make the immune system seek
out proteins called antigens on cancerous cells. The preparations
are made from melanoma cells grown in the laboratory.
   Injections were done under the skin once a week for four weeks
with a final injection on week six. Patients who responded were
treated with a single monthly booster and semiannual courses of
five more doses.
   In 79 melanoma patients, the treatment produced a complete
remission in 5 percent and a partial remission in 18 percent,
Mitchell said. Another 10 percent showed minor responses, defined
as tumor shrinkage of 26 percent to 50 percent.
   No major side effects were observed, he said.
   Other researchers have reported similar work. ``Clearly this is
an attraactive approach,'' said John Laszlo, the cancer society's
senior vice president for research.
   Mitchell also reported on results from treating melanoma
patients with low doses of interleukin-2, a natural substance used
by the immune system, and a standard cancer drug called
cyclophosphamide. Both drugs were given at about one-third the dose
used in experiments or therapy.
   In 39 patients, the combination produced a 28 percent response
rate, including two complete remissions and eight partial
remissions, Mitchell said.
   Potentially, this treatment could be done by any hospital, and
its results are comparable to a more complex treatment in which
interleukin-2 is combined outside the body with white blood cells
and then reinjected into the patient, Mitchell said.
   In what he called the ``down note'' of his talk, Mitchell said
some other forms of therapy will have to be found to deal with the
spread of melanoma cells to the brain, where they can form new
cancers.
   In a separate presentation, a researcher said a study of 200
people with or without melanoma suggests that six factors define
people at high risk for getting the disease.
   They are blond or red hair, marked freckling of the upper back,
the presence of rough, red bumps called actinic keratoses caused by
to sun exposure, a history of melanoma in other family members,
having had three or more blistering sunburns during one's teen-age
years, and having spent three or more years at an outdoor summer
job as a teen-ager.
   Having any one or two of these factors gives a person a three to
four times increased chance of developing melanoma, said Darrell
Rigel of the New York University School of Medicine.
   People with three or more of the factors run an increased risk
of 20 to 25 times, he said.
   People at high risk should be taught the ways to detect melanoma
early, when it is at a highly curable stage, he said.

   Jackie Thomas desperately wishes someone
could tell her how to cope with the rare disease that forces her
4-year-old daughter to live life away from sunlight, her facial skin
to be replaced by surgery.
   Every time Wendy Thomas goes outside, she must wear a large
sunbonnet and special sunglasses that protect her delicate eyes. If
she doesn't, she runs the risk of developing more of the skin
cancers that already have marred her ever-smiling face and threaten
her life.
   Unless it is night, she must travel only in her family's van,
which is equipped with window blinds and tints. Even in the house,
she must be careful to play on the side away from what rays get past
the blinds and shades, and she must be covered every day with the
most powerful sun blocker manufactured.
   As Wendy prepared to undergo more surgery Thursday in Dallas, her
32-year-old mother said she can only wish there was a support group
in Texas for mothers of children with xeroderma pigmentosum. She
would even start one if she could find someone to join.
   ``I wish somebody could tell me what Wendy is going to go
through, especially in the last and final stages,'' she said. ``But
I can't find anybody.''
   Only a couple hundred Americans have the usually fatal disease.
The odds of having XP, as the affliction is known, are literally
one-in-a-million, says its foremost expert, Dr. Kenneth Kraemer, a
research scientist at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md.
   Those with XP must be constantly protected from sunlight,
otherwise their skin and eyes may be severely damaged.
   But the real risk for Wendy comes from the numerous skin cancers
that form on XP patients, some of which could prove fatal if not
treated in time. Also, about 20 percent of XP patients have
nerve-related problems and may develop deafness, muscular disorders
or retardation.
   Wendy has had so many skin cancers removed from her fair,
freckled skin during seven previous surgeries that her parents have
agreed to allow a plastic surgeon to replace all the skin on her
face.
   At present, her face is scar-covered and her scalp is hairless in
several patches. The girl's parents say they know the extensive skin
grafting is risky, but say it is her only chance for a fresh start _
and survival. Otherwise, she faces a risk of melanoma, the most
severe form of skin cancer.
   The surgeon, Dr. H. Steve Byrd, would rather not talk about how
risky the surgery is, his secretary said.
   The difficult and painful surgery will take place at Dallas'
Baylor University Medical Center, where Wendy will have an extender
inserted into her abdomen so skin can be stretched and later removed
to be grafted onto her face, Mrs. Thomas said.
   ``I wish she was old enough to make some of these decisions on
her own,'' Mrs. Thomas said. ``She's gone through so much pain
already.''
   Some of the pain isn't merely physical, and that is just becoming
evident to the child.
   Even in Athens, where several fund-raisers have been held to help
the Thomases with medical bills, some women will pull their children
away from Wendy, fearful her disease may be contagious, said Mrs.
Thomas, who lost her a factory job recently and whose husband is a
farmer.
   It is not, said Kraemer, who has produced the only laymen's guide
to the disease. And a lucky few, who were diagnosed early in life,
have lived relatively normal lives, he said.
   Mrs. Thomas said she can only sit and wonder how effective
previous surgeries have been in removing all the skin cancers.
   ``Quite frankly, for a long time, I'd just sit in my house and
cry,'' she said. ``I used to blame myself for Wendy's problems. I
used to love sitting out in the sun and Wendy would always be with
me.''
   Mrs. Thomas, and her husband, Ronnie, didn't identify Wendy's
problem was until she was 2, when she suddenly turned bright red in
what seemed to be an untreatable sunburn. And the first doctor that
did know what was wrong gave them no encouragement. The Thomases had
asked how XP would affect Wendy's schooling.
   ``He said, `You won't have to worry about that, she won't be
around that long,''' Mrs. Thomas said.
   The Thomases, who live with their three children in this town of
10,000 residents 60 miles southeast of Dallas, refuse to let their
faith waver. They say they must be willing to take desperate
measures because they desperately love Wendy. And no matter what
cost they must meet, it will gladly be paid.
   ``And I'm different,'' said Mrs. Thomas. ``Someday when another
mother needs me, when someone needs to know what it's like going
through the last and final stages, I'm going to tell them.''

   HOUSTON -- Cancer researcher Steven Rosenberg said his
team is close to identifying a gene in malignant melanoma as
part of a novel cancer program to make tumors self-destruct.
   The new thrust places Dr. Rosenberg in the position of
both altering cancer cells and producing cancer vaccines. His
previous efforts in fighting cancer have focused on boosting
the power of the body's own cancer-fighting white blood cells
by inserting genes in them and creating "designer
lymphocytes," a term coined earlier by Dr. Rosenberg.

   Dr. Rosenberg, chief of surgery at the National Cancer
Institute in Bethesda, Md., announced his findings on
melanoma, the deadly skin cancer that's spreading very
rapidly in the U.S., at the annual meeting of the American
Society of Clinical Oncology here, where he received the
society's highest honor, the Karnovsky Award.
   In the latest research, Dr. Rosenberg is trying to alter
cancer cells so that they produce particular proteins that
make the cancer itself appear more "foreign" to the body's
immune defense system. These cancer proteins, called
antigens, could provoke a response by the body, thus
immunizing "a patient against his own cancer," Dr. Rosenberg
explained.
   He said an NCI team led by Rina Zakut, a visiting
scientist from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, has
identified a gene in melanoma believed responsible for
producing a protein that the body's immune system recognizes.
The team also unraveled the genetic blueprint of the gene,
which is a modification of a normal gene. Nevertheless, Dr.
Rosenberg was cautious about the unpublished findings.
   "It may not be the right gene," he warned, "but we're on
the right track. We're very close."
   In a proposed experiment that could lead to a vaccine, Dr.
Rosenberg plans to take the probable melanoma gene and
implant it into a standard preparation such as that used to
immunize people against smallpox. A melanoma patient so
innoculated would begin churning out the melanoma antigen, in
effect waving it like a red flag to arouse the body's immune
response to fight the cancer. Dr. Rosenberg said his team now
is close to cloning the melanoma gene in the test tube.
   In his address, Dr. Rosenberg also outlined a series of
experiments that he's planning, starting with efforts to
implant genes into cancer cells that produce cancer-fighting
substances such as interleukin2 (IL-2) and tumor necrosis
factor (TNF). He already has implanted such genes into
cancer-fighting blood cells.
   Implanting such genes into the actual cancer cells would
plant the seeds of the cells' own destruction. Animal studies
by several laboratories show success in treating mouse cancer
with such "designer cancer cells." "The cells grow and then
regress. That mouse is then immune to {its own tumor,}" Dr.
Rosenberg said.
   As with prior studies, Dr. Rosenberg faces a series of
regulatory hurdles before he can proceed to human testing
with any of these experimental procedures.
   If the vaccine approach eventually proves successful, Dr.
Rosenberg speculated that immunization of healthy people
against cancer might become "a realistic goal for the 21st
century." However, this is a distant, if devoutly sought
"Holy Grail" for medical researchers, as well as very
difficult because it might require a different vaccine for
every kind of cancer.
   "It's important to emphasize the experimental nature of
these treatments, and their limited availability," he added.
He also acknowledged "the research is expensive," rendering
practical treatment even more remote.
   In a progress report on his current cancer therapy
program, Dr. Rosenberg said two melanoma patients treated
with genemodified killer blood cells in January "are doing
fine and at home." However, he declined to answer questions
as to whether their tumors had regressed from the treatment
nearly four months ago.
   In that program, the patients' own cancer-fighting cells
were spliced with a gene that makes TNF in order to deliver
the cancer-fighting substance right to the tumor site. "It
will take one to two years to see whether these gene-modified
TILS {tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes} work," Dr. Rosenberg
said.
   He acknowledged that he's still daunted by "the immense
complexity of the malignant process, {involving} the very
subjugation of life," in which normal cell growth is
transformed into wild proliferation.
   So far, only about one-tenth of patients experience
complete remission from Dr. Rosenberg's treatments-and only
half of those are lasting. Still, he likened his work to the
flight of the first rickety airplane -- not practical, but a
technology worth pursuing.
