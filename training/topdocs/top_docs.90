DICK CLARK MOVES 'BANDSTAND' TO DINERS

<TEXT>
<P>
OK, so MTV and other video channels knocked "American Bandstand" off the air
last October.
</P>
<P>
Now Burbank-based Dick Clark Productions hopes its name, spirit and ability to
generate cash flow from the American public will rock on at a string of novelty
restaurants named for the television show that entertained generations of
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
A pilot diner overlooking Biscayne Bay in Miami opened Monday as Dick Clark's
American Bandstand Grill, complete with a mock "Bandstand" set; a pop art
cellar club that recalls the 1960s and other decade theme areas; a sing-along
arena; and TV monitors churning out repeats of "Bandstand" segments from 1958
to 1989.
</P>
<P>
For dessert, patrons can use the grill's video studio. For a fee, they can
record their own music videos with intros from Clark, once known as "America's
oldest teen-ager" and the host of "American Bandstand" for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
"We realize there is untapped value in certain trademarks," said Francis C. La
Maina, president of Dick Clark Productions. "For the past year we have been
actively exploring ways to capitalize on those assets."
</P>
<P>
The Burbank company kicked in its famous name in a joint venture with Harmon
Entertainment, a Secaucus, N.J., commercial real estate outfit that paid
start-up costs and the $2-million construction cost of the 8,500-square-foot
restaurant.

<TEXT>
   Dick Clark, the ageless rock 'n' roll emcee
whose ``American Bandstand'' gave teen-agers everything from the
jitterbug to Madonna, says he is leaving the show after 33 years as
host.
   ``American Bandstand,'' syndicated nationwide, will move to USA
Network on April 8 with David Hirsch as host.
   ``This is actually an exciting day for me,'' Clark said Tuesday.
``Like David, I was 26 when I started hosting Bandstand. After 33
years, I finally decided it was time to give someone else a chance.''
   Hirsch, a Detroit native, was discovered at dick clark
productions in Burbank. At the time, he was a producer for ``USA's
CAMP MIDNITE,'' a late-night talk show on USA Network, which is seen
in more than 46 million homes through 10,000 cable affiliates.
   Hirsch had to audition for ``American Bandstand.''
   Clark's age, 59, had nothing to do with the decision, said an
associate who spoke on condition of anonymity. In the past, Clark
has indicated he wanted to relinquish his host role by 1990.
   ``Bandstand,'' as it was first titled, hit the TV air waves in
September 1952 on WFIL-TV in Philadelphia with Bob Horn and Lee
Stewart as hosts.
   But it was Clark, who took over in 1956, that became the show's
symbol, even as it made him a multi-millionaire.
   On Aug. 5, 1957, ``American Bandstand'' debuted on the ABC
network, quickly becoming a national success.
   Generations of teen-agers saw the clean-cut, carefully suited and
coiffed Clark preside over a studio full of equally clean-cut teens,
dancing and posing for the cameras.
   Clark, who never danced on the show, became the butt of some
jokes for maintaining his boyish looks over the years. He once
compared the burden to that of female sex symbols.
   ``They're constantly told how wonderful they look, but it gets to
be a drag after a while, because someday the looks have gotta go,''
he said. ``It would be nice to be allowed to age gracefully.''
   Off-screen, Clark has acknowledged that he has a temper and is
intolerant of mistakes by subordinates. But in his ``Bandstand''
persona, teens saw him as a friendly, hip father figure.
   The show was a must for many performers.
   During its three decades, it has provided the first national
exposure to scores of performers, including Madonna, the Beach Boys,
Linda Ronstadt, Jerry Lee Lewis, James Brown, Stevie Wonder and Neil
Diamond.
   Others making nationwide debuts on the show included Chubby
Checker, Buddy Holly, Sonny &amp; Cher, The Doors, Barry Manilow,
Prince, Pat Benatar, Sheena Easton, Cyndi Lauper and Billy Idol.
   ``American Bandstand'' also launched songs onto the best-seller
charts and introduced America to such dances as the Twist, Jerk,
Bunny Hop, Hustle and Break Dancing.
   In 1987, ``American Bandstand'' was entered into the Guinness
Book of World Records as television's longest-running variety
program. It has earned five Emmy awards.
   The show has been on the air 37 years, through more than 6,000
hours, played more than 65,000 records and been host to more than
600,000 dancing teen-agers.
   In a 1986 interview with USA Today, Clark said he helped in
``keeping the music alive'' in the early days of televised rock, but
described himself as a fortunate man of limited abilities.
   ``I don't have any basic talents myself,'' he said. ``I have the
ability to work on television and feel comfortable with and make
other people feel confortable with it. That's probably some sort of
a mild form of talent. Beyond that, I don't get too serious about
it.''

   Dick Clark, the boyish Pied Piper of rock
'n' roll known to generations as America's oldest teen-ager, turns
60 Thursday secluded on another continent far away from the
enamored masses.
   The squeaky-clean packager of pop will blow out the candles on a
birthday cake with his wife, Kari, and another couple somewhere in
Brazil, publicist Paul Shefrin said.
   No fanfare. No party. No fuss.
   Whether because of modesty or vanity, Clark turned down an
interview request. In the past, the multimillion-dollar
entertainer-producer said he would prefer to ``age gracefully''
without media attention.
   Wrinkles can finally be seen on his boyish face, but it's hard
to believe he's 60.
   For decades, his youthful looks were the butt of jokes. He once
compared the burden to that of female sex symbols.
   ``They're constantly told how wonderful they look, but it gets
to be a drag after a while because someday the looks have gotta go.
It would be nice to be allowed to age gracefully,'' he said.
   Clark arrived in the nation's living rooms through his
``American Bandstand'' television show, introducing teen-agers to
Stevie Wonder, The Jackson 5 and Madonna, as well as the Bunny Hop,
Twist and Jerk dance crazes.
   ``Bandstand,'' as it was first titled, hit the airwaves in
September 1952 on WFIL-TV in Philadelphia with Bob Horn and Lee
Stewart as hosts.
   But Clark became its symbol when he took it over in 1956, and
generations of teen-agers came to identify with the clean-cut,
carefully suited and coiffed host. He was a friendly, hip father
figure.
   On Aug. 5, 1957, ``American Bandstand'' debuted on the ABC-TV
network, quickly becoming a national success. Jerry Lee Lewis'
``Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On'' was the first record spun on that
show.
   In March, Clark hung up his saddle shoes after 33 years as host
of ``American Bandstand.'' The show reigns as television's
longest-lived variety program.
   Clark lives on the beach near Paradise Cove, behind an imposing
iron gate across a driveway that winds down from Pacific Coast
Highway.
   He was born at the onset of the Great Depression, when the Big
Band era started to flourish.
   Clark joins other celebrity sexagenarians this year _ Jacqueline
Onassis, Bob Newhart, Audrey Hepburn, June Carter Cash, Buck Owens,
Ed Asner, Berry Gordy, Adam West, Jules Feiffer, Jean Simmons and
Arnold Palmer.
   Clark was unique, however, in transcending the generations with
a hip music show and, in recent years, as host of the ``$25,000
Pyramid'' and ``$100,000 Pyramid'' game shows.
   He also produces the annual American Music Awards, the Academy
of Country Music Awards, the ``New Year's Rockin' Eve'' TV bash and
``TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes.''

   Dick Clark, the rock 'n' roll Pied Piper whose
``American Bandstand'' introduced teen-agers to Stevie Wonder, The
Jackson 5 and Madonna as well as the Bunny Hop, Twist and Jerk dance
crazes, is hanging up his saddle shoes after 33 years.
   Known to generations of youths as America's oldest teen-ager, the
squeaky-clean packager of pop next month turns over the emcee chores
of television's longest running variety program to David Hirsch.
   ``Like David, I was 26 when I started hosting Bandstand. After 33
years, I finally decided it was time to give someone else a
chance,'' Clark, 59, said in a statement.
   ``I knew that this day would evenutally come. I've been very
forutnate to host Bandstand as long as I have,'' he continued.
```American Bandstand' has always been like a fourth child to me _ a
child that has grown and matured.''
   Interview requests were declined. ``He is trying to make it nice
and quiet without hoopla,'' Clark spokesman Tom Stepanchak said
Wednesday.
   Hirsch takes over April 8 when the syndicated show moves to USA
Network. The Detroit native, who lives in Los Angeles, also will
continue to work for Clark's production company as a producer for
``USA's CAMP MIDNITE,'' a late-night talk show on USA Network.
   ``I was completely flattered and honored to be asked to audition.
I was extremely nervous,'' Hirsch said in quotes provided by
Stephanchak. ``When they told me I was the new host, I was
speechless. It was a total shock.''
   Hirsch, who was unavailable for interviews Wednesday because of
an unspecified family emergency, is a graduate of Michigan State
University. He has worked with improvisational comedy groups, worked
as a disc jockey in college and played drums in several bands to
help pay his way through school.
   Clark won't be retiring to his Malibu beach house to watch gulls
and migrating whales. ``American Bandstand'' is only a small part of
his production empire.
   He continues as TV host of the ``$25,000 Pyramid'' and ``$100,000
Pyramid'' game shows, numerous television movies and network
specials. He is the producer of the annual American Music Awards,
the Academy of Country Music Awards, the ``New Year's Rockin' Eve''
TV show and ``TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes.''
   ``Bandstand,'' as it was first titled, debuted in September 1952
on WFIL-TV in Philadelphia with Bob Horn and Lee Stewart as hosts.
Clark took over in 1956. He became the show's symbol as it won five
Emmy awards and made him a multimillionaire.
   On Aug. 5, 1957, ``American Bandstand'' moved to the ABC network,
quickly becoming a national success. The first record spun on that
show was ``Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On'' by Jerry Lee Lewis.
   ``The first record of the day was always a fast one. It got the
kids moving,'' said Clark.
   On his Thanksgiving show on Nov. 22, 1957, Clark introduced the
singing duo Tom &amp; Jerry, who sang ``Hey Schoolgirl.'' The duet later
recorded under their real names, Simon &amp; Garfunkel.
   Over the years, more than 65,000 records were played on
``American Bandstand.'' The show has logged more than 10,000 musical
guest appearances and more than 600,000 teen-agers have danced
before television cameras.
   Generations of teens saw the clean-cut, carefully suited and
coiffed Clark preside over a studio full of equally clean-cut teens,
dancing and posing for the cameras.
   Clark, who never danced on the show, became the butt of jokes for

Pips, Wham! and Bon Jovi.

A LAST DANCE WITH DICK CLARK
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"American Bandstand' is rock 'n' roll history," Chubby Checker said this week
as he considered the role that the seminal teen dance show -- the longest
running show on television -- has played in the rise of rock.
</P>
<P>
"When you talk about rock 'n' roll dancing, it goes back to 'Bandstand,' " the
"Twist"-meister said of the show, which helped boost his career in the late
'50s and early '60s. "Just like the phone starts with Alexander Graham Bell."
</P>
<P>
At approximately 4 p.m. today, that history takes a turn.
</P>
<P>
In a Hollywood TV studio, Dick Clark, who has presided over "Bandstand" for 33
years, will pass his microphone to the man he has picked to succeed him: David
Hirsch, 26, formerly a segment producer for Clark's "Camp Midnight" series.
</P>
<P>
In today's "Bandstand" taping, which will air April 8 -- the first outing on
its new USA Network home -- Hirsh will preside over the familiar trademarks of
the American TV institution, including the spotlight dance and rate-a-record
segments.
</P>
<P>
Clark, who at 59 is still known as "America's Oldest Teen-Ager," is stepping
aside to concentrate on the other tentacles of his huge entertainment empire.
</P>
<P>
Besides "Bandstand," which Dick Clark Productions will continue to produce,
Clark has his hands in other television production and syndication packages,
concert tour packages and other holdings that, as of 1986, had boosted him onto
the "Forbes 400" list of wealthiest Americans with an estimated worth of more
than $180 million.
</P>
<P>
Neither Clark nor Hirsch would comment about the transition, but to many
associated with the show over the years, today's taping represents nothing less
than the end of an era.
</P>
<P>
"Dick Clark leaving 'Bandstand' just doesn't seem right," said Joe Bonsall, a
member of the Oak Ridge Boys country group who, in the late '50s, sometimes
danced on "Bandstand" broadcasts in Philadelphia. "Sometimes when something
lasts so long, you think it will always be there."
</P>
<P>
The show began as a daily 2 1/2-hour local program in Philadelphia in 1952.
Clark took the host job in 1956, and ABC picked up the series in 1957. Clark
moved the operation to Hollywood in 1964, from where the it has originated,
once a week, since.
</P>
<P>
To Kent Ferguson, who like Bonsall dressed in a suit and tie and stood in line
outside the Philadelphia studio hoping to be accepted for the show in the late
'50s, "Bandstand" and Clark will always represent a lost time of innocence.
</P>
<P>
"Around the corner from the studio was a soda shop, and the guy who ran it was
really named Pops," recalled Ferguson, who now is headmaster of the Santa
Barbara Middle School. "That was the hang-out, where the in-crowd went after
school and before the show.
</P>
<P>
"Today it's so different. All during that time, every Saturday night there
would be a dance you could go to. There would be no liquor or cigarettes and of
course no drugs. And this was all the impact of 'American Bandstand.' Clark
really impacted a generation. I think it's sad today that kids don't have a
wholesome dance environment without all that other crap."
</P>
<P>
The history of "American Bandstand" isn't all quite that Norman Rockwell-ish.
</P>
<P>
In 1960, Clark -- along with disc jockey Alan Freed -- was called before a
congressional committee investigating payola and conflict of interest in the
music industry. For Freed, the scandal ended a brilliant career; he died a
broke alcoholic in 1964 at 43. Clark, though, emerged unscathed after divesting
his interests in record and publishing companies. Many in the industry
speculated that Clark's smooth, clean-cut image helped him escape the taint of
scandal that destroyed the more abrasive Freed.
</P>
<P>
Over the years there have also been stories about Clark being a dictatorial,
egotistical boss -- though most associated with him speak glowingly of his
fathomless loyalty to those who have helped him and worked for him.
</P>
<P>
More recently, the luster of "Bandstand" itself has faded. MTV certainly
supplanted it as the primary television outlet for pop music and "Bandstand's"
ratings dropped to the point that, in 1987, ABC would not guarantee a set spot
on its Saturday daytime lineup and asked for it to be cut from one hour to half
an hour.
</P>
<P>
Clark then took the show to the less-visible world of syndication. And the new
move to cable, with or without Clark, leaves industry observers uncertain about
the show's value as a place to expose artists.
</P>
<P>
A recording company publicist, who asked not to be identified, said that it is
no longer economical to place artists on the show because the program requires
that the artist pay all transportation and union fees.
</P>
<P>
However, a publicist for another record company, who also asked not to be
identified, said "Bandstand" remains part of the regimen of promotional
outlets, though it's far from the dominant force of old.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think in the '80s there's anything aside from repeated MTV airings of
a video that has the impact 'Bandstand' or 'Ed Sullivan' had in the '60s. But
every little bit helps."
</P>
<P>
For Deon Estus, who will be the first recording artist to appear on the new
"Bandstand," the change doesn't lessen his thrill.
</P>
<P>
"I was raised on 'Bandstand,' like we all were," said the musician, whose song
"Heaven Help Me" is a hot item on the black and dance music charts. "To me it's
as exciting as it would have been 20 years ago."
</P>
<P>
And Chubby Checker insists that it's pointless to mourn the changes time has
brought to the show.
</P>
<P>
"It's like this," the still-active singer said. "The wheel has already been
invented, so what's the big deal? Dick Clark taught everybody how to do it, or
they wouldn't be doing it. And dancing is still going on."

HITS PROVE HARD TO FIND AT DICK CLARK PRODUCTIONS;
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN MEDIOCRE SINCE THE COMPANY WENT PUBLIC IN

All the cats watched "American Bandstand," Dick Clark's rock 'n' roll
television show, back when Chuck Berry released "Sweet Little Sixteen" in 1958.
</P>
<P>
But 31 years later, the stars rock around the clock for video junkies on MTV
and other music video channels. That's bad news for "Bandstand," which
disappeared from TV after Oct. 7, when it had its last USA cable network
airing. The show ultimately will be replaced in the same time slot by a
look-alike music program, "Dance Party U.S.A.," and a teen-oriented magazine
show called "Youthquake."
</P>
<P>
It's the first time since Clark took over "Bandstand" in 1956 that the show has
been out of production. But though it's an American cultural icon, the show's
cable cancellation came with a whimper and not a bang.
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Clark -- "Bandstand's" host for 33 years -- said the show's not
dead. He'll try to bring "Bandstand" back on prime-time network TV. Moreover,
America's oldest teen-ager had already quit hosting the show, which was aired
only on cable since April and hadn't been seen on ABC-TV, its home for three
decades, for several years.
</P>
<P>
Still, the cancellation was symbolic of the times for Dick Clark Productions,
the Burbank company that produced it. The company badly needs a sitcom or game
show in regular production to smooth out its history of bumpy earnings caused
by a reliance on revenues from the periodic musical and comedy specials it
produces.
</P>
<P>
When Dick Clark Productions went public early in 1987 and raised $8.2 million,
the company planned to expand into game shows, sitcoms and dramatic TV. (Clark
and his wife, Karen, own about 76% of the company.) Then, as now, the plan was
to keep generating new program ideas until one took off.
</P>
<P>
"One successful game show, one successful series, and everybody will be happy,"
said Clark in a recent interview. "One will beget another, which will beget
another."
</P>
<P>
But since the public offering, revenues have tailed off and profits have
gyrated. The company's stock still trades at about $6.50 a share -- its
original offering price. Part of the problem has been a competitive market for
new TV shows, exacerbated by the continued success of many shows already on the
air.
</P>
<P>
Clark's company has failed to produce a successful series and continues to rely
largely on specials.
</P>
<P>
"You can't make it on specials alone," said industry analyst Harold Vogel of
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
</P>
<P>
Specials, however, make up most of Dick Clark Productions' schedule -- although
the company declined to break down its earnings by show.
</P>
<P>
Of the four 1989-90 season series listed in the company's most recent annual
report, "American Bandstand" is already off the air, and "Trial by Jury" -- a
courtroom drama -- may soon follow, said Francis C. La Maina, the company's
president and chief operating officer. One show, "Dick Clark Presents," aired
only six times in 1988.
</P>
<P>
What's left, for the most part, are specials. Some are successful perennials:
Dick Clark has produced "New Year's Rockin' Eve" for 18 years, the "American
Music Awards" for 17 years and the "Academy of Country Music Awards" for 12
years.
</P>
<P>
But some, like "Farm Aid IV" and "The Ice Stars' Hollywood Revue," have
appeared only once and have an uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
That means the company's creative staff has to reinvent the wheel each year
just to keep rolling at the same pace.
</P>
<P>
Worse, it also means that revenues come in fits and spurts, not a steady stream
-- creating stark quarter-to-quarter contrasts. After a fairly strong fiscal
year that ended June 30, in which Dick Clark earned $2.6 million on revenue of
$25.6 million, the company's earnings for the first quarter that ended Sept. 30
plunged 97% to $14,000 from $435,000 a year earlier, despite a 47% jump in
revenue to $6.9 million from $4.7 million.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the volatility: in the first quarter last year, the television
company was producing a couple of series -- including "Bandstand" -- that
generated respectable profit margins. This year, most of Dick Clark
Productions' first-quarter revenues came from an expensive made-for-TV movie
that exceeded its budget, cutting into profits.
</P>
<P>
One of Dick Clark's bids for a regular series is a game show pilot called "The
Challengers" -- a quiz show Clark would host. The program would focus on
up-to-date news and entertainment topics. Buena Vista Television, the
syndication arm of Walt Disney Co., already has sold the show to at least 10 TV
stations around the country, according to Buena Vista representative Andi
Sporkin.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, NBC has commissioned Dick Clark and another production company to
produce a pilot for a revived version of "Let's Make a Deal."
</P>
<P>
But what's behind Door No. 1 for Dick Clark in game shows could be
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
For one, there's plenty of competition. "It'll be pretty hard, I think, because
there are many doing the same thing," said Merrill Lynch's Vogel. In fact,
about 45 game shows are now in development and vying for air time, said
Sporkin.
</P>
<P>
Among those, one heavyweight contender will be "Monopoly," a TV version of the
classic board game, produced by Merv Griffin Enterprises, the company that
created "Jeopardy!" and "Wheel of Fortune."
</P>
<P>
So Dick Clark is also working on pilot scripts for sitcoms. One would star the
Motown recording group, The Boys. "The script has gone and it's . . . been
received well. It looks very good for a pilot," Clark said.
</P>
<P>
Another pilot script the company is working on is based on the Judy Blume book
"Just as Long as We're Together."
</P>
<P>
Counting on a sitcom or series success has its pitfalls too. For the most part,
such series are so expensive to write and film that their producers don't
profit from them until they're sold for rerun syndication. But to make it as a
rerun, a show has to last three or four years as a first-run series. Meanwhile,
production costs are up front.
</P>
<P>
It takes considerable resources to bankroll that kind of gamble. And La Maina
admits that Dick Clark's bigger rivals are better prepared for the risk.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we can compete on the same level," said La Maina. "We can't have
15 or 20 writers under contract."
</P>
<P>
Despite the company's need for a breakthrough, Clark said he had no plans to
try to match his bigger competitors' spending on a single project to create a
success. "If anybody wants to criticize us they'd say we've been too
conservative," said Clark. "But we're not in the business of spending the money
in a dangerous way. With one or two modest successes, everybody will be very
happy."
</P>
<P>
Clark still has a few other businesses besides Dick Clark Productions. Clark
and La Maina own Olive Enterprises, which essentially leases to Dick Clark both
the building that houses the company and the right to use the name "American
Bandstand."
</P>
<P>
That right could become important soon. A subsidiary of the production company
has entered into a deal with an East Coast real estate company to develop an
American Bandstand Grill restaurant in Miami, and La Maina said he hopes the
restaurant will become the first of a chain.
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to make the asset work in different ways," La Maina said of the
"Bandstand" trademark. Being off the air "may add value to the company because
it now has legendary status," he said.
</P>
<P>
A former Utica, N.Y., newsman, Clark started in television production in 1956
when he took over "Bandstand," a local music program on television in
Philadelphia. Within a year, ABC brought the show to national television,
dubbing it "American Bandstand" and giving Clark the boost he needed to start a
series of businesses, one of which eventually became Dick Clark Productions.
</P>
<P>
Clark, approaching 60, said he's eager to show that his company can do more
than specials and musical variety shows. "Absolutely, that's the only reason
this whole world of entertainment is so fascinating," he said. "It's always new
challenges. It's a great boon for your head. You never get bored."
</P>
<P>
Clark said he is looking forward to results, too -- to the day when observers
might look at the company's strategy and say "Gee, aren't they smart."
</P>
<P>
But, he added: "Right now you can't say that."

<HEAD>Dick Clark To Serve Up Nostalgia At Restaurant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dick Clark, whose ``American Bandstand'' spanned
decades of musical tastes, intends to see if he can get to the top
of the charts satisfying tastes for food.
   He expects to open his American Bandstand Grill in downtown Miami
by January and greet patrons with a heavy dose of nostalgia,
including rock 'n' roll memorabilia such as Elvis Presley's cape and
Elton John's shoes.
   The two-story establishment will resemble the studio from
``Bandstand,'' which premiered in Philadelphia in 1952. Clark joined
the show four years later and was the program's host for more than
30 years until earlier this year.
   Dancers will be able to watch themselves on television monitors,
another trademark of ``Bandstand.'' Also planned is a recording
studio where aspiring singers can make a tape complete with
background singers, music and an introduction by the 59-year-old
Clark.
   ``American Bandstand,'' a fixture on ABC-TV for years, is TV's
longest-running musical program and continues to air on the USA
cable network.
   At the upscale Bayfront setting where Clark intends to open for
business, another celebrity has failed in similar venture. In
February, Mariel Hemingway's restaurant, Zemo's, closed after only a
month.

   They twisted, coffee-grinded and
jitterbugged their way into the nation's living rooms on the
original ``American Bandstand'' in the 1950s. Now, older and a
little less svelte, they're back in the city where it all began to
recapture their glory days.
   On Thursday, for the first time in a quarter century, 27 of the
original Bandstand dancers, including Joe, Kenny, Arlene, Carole,
Flossie and Jim, reunited to rehearse their steps for a rock 'n'
roll celebration over Labor Day weekend in Philadelphia.
   ``Any place there's dancing, I'll still go,'' said Joe Fusco,
who was 15 when he joined the show.
   Fusco, now 46, of south Philadelphia and Lis Braun of the Hot
Foot Agency, a talent agency for dancers, cooked up the idea of
bringing the gang together to dance, gossip and reminisce at the
rock 'n' roll event, called Rock `A' Rama.
   Fusco developed the two-hour show with Braun, contacted the
dancers and helped with the choreography.
   ``American Bandstand'' started life as a Philadelphia TV show in
1952, with Bob Horn as master of ceremonies. Dick Clark took over
as host in 1956, and the show made its network debut on ABC-TV on
Aug. 5, 1957.
   Clark moved the show to California in 1964, but many fans
remember it as a Philadelphia phenomenon.
   The Bandstanders invented steps that are still given a whirl:
the bunny hop, the chalypso and the stroll.
   ``You were like a big star. Girls chased ya; the guys hated
ya,'' said Fusco.
   So in a dance studio Thursday night, remembering the glory days,
they practiced their jitterbugs and coffee-grinding and listened to
Bobby Darin, Frankie Avalon and Neil Sedaka.
   The dancers have aged, some have gained weight or grown
mustaches, but they continue to follow what's hip in fashion and
dance steps. Several wore miniskirts, others donned sneakers and
pedal pushers.
   During breaks, they grabbed cameras and cigarettes and tried to
catch up with each others' lives before Joe called them back for
another try at ``Rock Around the Clock'' or ``Oh, Carole.''
   The reunion gossip even included a love story.
   Philadelphia's Carole Scaldeferri, a regular on the show from
1957 to 1961, met Richard Spada in 1957, when he was a fan who
traveled to Philadelphia to see the show in person.
   In 1977, Carole appeared on a Dick Clark television special,
where Richard spotted her. With the help of Clark and his wife,
Richard contacted Carole and the two were married six months later.
   ``Now I only dance at weddings,'' said Carole, 42.
   Bobby Baritz, a little out of breath from a fast jitterbug, said
he now runs a food and gift shop in New York City. He said fans
often spot the ``American Bandstand'' display in his store and gawk
at photographs of their favorite Bandstanders.
   Recalling the days when a secretary handled her fan mail, Arlene
Sullivan of Washington Township, N.J., said, ``They still remember,
they still remember.''
   And they do.
   David Frees of Ephrata is president and founder of the American
Bandstand Fan Club, which has more than 800 members in the United
States, Europe and Japan.
   ``You better believe I'll be there,'' Frees said of the Rock `A'
Rama appearance. There are no plans to televise the event.
   And it was Frees, not any of the original Bandstanders
interviewed Thursday, who remembered the words to the show's theme
song, written by Barry Manilow.
   ``I'll jump and, hey, I may even show 'em my handstand, because
I'm on the American Bandstand.''

   They boogied and stomped their way into the
nation's living rooms in the 1950s when American Bandstand was
filmed in Philadelphia. Now they're back in the city where it
began, rehearsing for a reunion.
   For the first time in 30 years, 27 of the original Bandstand
dancers, including Kenny, Arlene, Carole, Flossie and Jim, got
together Thursday night to rehearse their steps for a show Sept. 4
at Philadelphia's Penn's Landing.
   ``American Bandstand,'' with host Dick Clark, made its network
debut on ABC television Aug. 5, 1957.
   Bandstander Joe Fusco of south Philadelphia and Lis Braun of the
Hot Foot Agency cooked up the idea of bringing the gang together
again. They came from Philadelphia, Camden, Manhatten and Houston
to bunnyhop, gossip and reminisce.
   ``Any place there's dancing, I'll still go,'' said Fusco, who
was 15 when he joined the show.
   Fusco developed the two-hour show with Braun, contacted all the
dancers and helped with the choreography. When he's not dancing,
Fusco is a professional party organizer.
   ``You were like a big star. Girls chased ya; the guys hated
ya,'' he said.
   The show was filmed near the University of Pennsylvania, across
from the Pop Singers drugstore, where the dancers used to hang out
to meet their fans. The drugstore is no longer there, but the steps
the dancers invented are still given a whirl: the bunny hop, the
chalypso and the stroll.
   Bob Horn emceed the show from its inception in 1952 until Dick
Clark took over in 1956. Clark moved the show to California in
1964, but the show's fans still remember it as a Philadelphia
phenomenon.

<TEXT>
   Rock 'n' roll pioneer Dick Clark said
Friday he's donating hundreds of videotapes, films and other
memorabilia for a music museum in a 30-story pyramid being built
along the Mississippi River.
   ``I've got a great collection of stuff to share,'' Clark said.
   Clark's announcement was to have kicked off a night of parades,
music and fireworks to mark the start of construction of the $56
million pyramid, intended as the centerpiece of a $200 million
tourist theme park billed as a musical Disneyland.
   Then it rained, and the party was postponed 24 hours, leaving
thousands of would-be revelers wandering aimlessly past soggy beer
and souvenir stands, and the empty soundstages set up for
street-party bands.
   Promoters had promised for weeks that the celebration, called The
Big Dig, would be the biggest party Memphis had ever seen. But
Sidney Shlenker, the man who will run the pyramid, said wet
electronics made the affair too dangerous.
   Major events of The Big Dig included a fireworks display with a
ton of explosives and a laser-light show outlining the shape of the
321-foot pyramid.
   Police said they had expected up to 100,000 spectators for the
show but were unable to count the sparse crowd that showed up
because it was too scattered through downtown.
   ``We're going to have the whole show tomorrow night,'' Shlenker
said. ``It just got to a point tonight that the decision got taken
out of our hands. It rained so hard that we've got pools of water.
It's just too dangerous with the electrical equipment to risk
peoples' lives.''
   A late-night rock 'n' roll concert featuring comedian Dan Aykroyd
and his Blues Brothers Review was to go on as scheduled at an
amphitheater on the city's Mud Island tourist park near the pyramid
site.
   Clark, who helped usher in rock 'n' roll with his TV show
``American Bandstand,'' said the museum will be a hall of fame
linked to his annual American Music Awards. The museum will include
computerized displays with recordings and videotapes of the nation's
musical past.
   ``You'll be able to punch up a date and find out what musically
was happening, what world events were happening and what it meant to
your life,'' Clark said.
   The concrete and stainless steel pyramid is scheduled to open in
May 1991. It is called ``The Great American Pyramid.''

   DICK CLARK PRODUCTIONS INC. said it reduced the size and price of its initial public offering to 1.1 million shares at $6.50 each.
Last November, the Burbank, Calif.-based developer and producer of television programs filed for an offering of 1.6 million shares at an estimated price of $8 to $10 each.
A spokesman said the company made the reduction because of "market conditions."
Mr. Clark, host of the long-running "American Bandstand" television series, will retain 86% of the company's voting securities, the company said.
Proceeds from the offering will be used for working capital and to expand the 29-year-old company's development, production and distribution of television programming.
Allen &amp; Co. and L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin Inc. are the underwriters.

   Dick Clark Productions Inc. expects to report lower earnings and revenue for its first quarter ended Sept. 30, and for the full year ending next June 30, said Francis La Maina, the company's president.

   For the quarter, net income was about $100,000, or one cent a share, down from about $1.6 million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier, Mr. La Maina said.
Revenue was between $7.5 million and $8 million, down from about $9 million a year ago, he added.

   Mr. La Maina said the lower results were due to a $3 million syndication sale in the year-earlier quarter that contributed $1.6 million to earnings.
There wasn't a similar item in the latest period.

   Mr. La Maina said the television production company founded by TV personality Dick Clark, who still has a 78% stake, has stepped up production activity and hopes "to establish a more consistent source of revenue."

   Without providing specific figures, Mr. La Maina said he anticipates that results for fiscal 1988 will be lower than those of fiscal 1987, when the company had net of $2.6 million, or 34 cents a share, on revenue of $28.9 million.
Mr. La Maina said results in the current fiscal year will suffer in comparison because of unusually strong syndication sales in the prior year.

   The executive said the company plans to increase its development of series and situation comedies, particularly in the variety area and in first-run syndications.

   Mr. La Maina said the company is well positioned to expand production with more than $14 million in cash and no debt.
He said the company doesn't plan any acquisitions or management changes, but does plan to add sales and creative staff.
The company now has about 110 employees, he said.

   The company gets most of its revenue from television series, but also has motion pictures in the development stage.

   Dick Clark Productions went public in January, garnering $6.8 million from the sale of almost 1.3 million shares.
Since then, in national over-the-counter trading, the stock has risen as high as $8.125 apiece but, as have the shares of many newly public entertainment companies, the price has fallen.
Yesterday, Dick Clark Productions closed at $4, down 50 cents.

   Actor-comedian Chevy Chase, who is reprising his
role as the dedicated family man in ``National Lampoon's Christmas
Vacation,'' says he thinks about going out with the guys as a break
from an all-female household.
   Chase said living with his wife, Jane, and three daughters has
changed his life, but he also feels ``out of control of my life
now.''
   ``I think I need to be taken away, dropped in some territory
with just a lot of loud guys,'' he said in an interview scheduled
for broadcast today and Friday on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``Like just get Danny Aykroyd and Marty (Martin Short) and (Tom)
Hanks and a bunch of us and just put us all together and leave us
alone with a 'fridge full of beer or something.''
   Chase, who has played the goofy family patriarch Clark Griswold
in two previous ``Vacation'' movies, said being a real-life father
means having responsibilities to his children.
   ``So, there are many things that I don't do that I used to do,''
he said. ``For instance, I sleep in a nightgown now.'

   Talk show host Dick Cavett needed 35
tries to get it right while making a videotape to promote West
Virginia.
   But give him break: He was doing it in Japanese.
   Gov. Gaston Caperton, scheduled to go to Japan Dec. 2 for a
nine-day visit, will take with him the promotional videotape in
which Cavett extols the state's virtues.
   ``We in America are quite proud of West Virginia,'' the
translated text of Cavett's remarks show. Cavett says Japan and
West Virginia have mountain ranges, a proud history and eyes on the
future.
   The governor's office said Cavett has done three documentaries
for Japanese television.
   Cavett is the latest celebrity to promote West Virginia. Actor
Leslie Nielsen, star of ``Airplane'' and ``The Naked Gun,'' has
done a package promoting education in the state.

   Jean-Paul Kauffmann has won the ``Relais Gourmand''
literary prize for a book of essays on wine, ``Le Bordeaux
Retrouve,'' which he dedicated to fellow Beirut hostage Michel
Seurat, who died in captivity.
   Kauffmann, who received the award Wednesday, was freed in May
1988 after spending more than three years in captivity. While held,
he promised to swear off wine for one year if released.
   He kept his promise.
   The book is about his rediscovery of wine.
   The book, whose title means rediscovering Bordeaux, is not for

   Dick Clark, America's oldest teen-ager,
turned 60 today but with little fanfare or fuss.
   He planned to blow out the candles on a birthday cake with his
wife, Kari, and another couple somewhere in Brazil, publicist Paul
Shefrin said.
   Clark turned down an interview request. In the past, the
multimillion-dollar entertainer-producer said he would prefer to
``age gracefully'' without media attention.
   Wrinkles can finally be seen on his boyish face, but for decades
his youthful looks were the butt of jokes. He once compared the
burden to that of female sex symbols.
   ``They're constantly told how wonderful they look, but it gets
to be a drag after a while because someday the looks have gotta go.
It would be nice to be allowed to age gracefully,'' he said.
   Clark arrived in the nation's living rooms through his
``American Bandstand'' television show, introducing teen-agers to
Stevie Wonder, The Jackson 5 and Madonna, as well as the Bunny Hop,
Twist and Jerk dance crazes.

   John Palmer, who in September was replaced as
``Today'' show newscaster by Deborah Norville, is leaving NBC News
after 26 years.
   Palmer and an NBC News spokeswoman declined to comment Wednesday
on a report that he is calling it quits at the network.
   But an NBC executive who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Palmer is leaving.
   ``Media Beat,'' shown on CNBC, the NBC-owned cable channel,
reported that Palmer is going to work with Av Westin, a former ABC
News program executive, on a new series for King World Productions,
syndicator of ``Wheel of Fortune.''
   Palmer joined NBC News in 1963 from station WSB-TV in Atlanta.
   He later became a White House correspondent. In September, after
seven years with ``Today,'' he moved to ``NBC News at Sunrise.''

   Profanities uttered by the heavy metal band
Guns N' Roses were heard by millions of TV viewers tuned in to the
American Music Awards and brought a barrage of complaints and an
apology from ABC.
   ``As a policy we can't discuss specific numbers, but I can
acknowledge that we have received many calls during the telecast
and this morning protesting the fact that the program contained
offensive language,'' network spokeswoman Janice Gretemeyer said
this morning from New York.
   Guns N' Roses, with a reputation for raunchy behavior, won two
awards during the Monday night ceremony at the Shrine Auditorium,
one as favorite heavy metal group and the other for best heavy
metal album, ``Appetite for Destruction.''
   The band was cut off in mid-sentence while accepting its first
award when guitarist Slash used a profanity.
   Slash and fellow band member Duff ``Rose'' McKagan stumbled to
stage and draped themselves over the speaker's stand to accept the
second award. They were quickly cut off when they began using
profanities again.
   The three-hour telecast was shown live in the East. The
offensive language was edited out of the tape-delayed West Coast
version.
   ``We regret that last night's telecast of American Music Awards
contained some offensive language,'' Gretemeyer said. ``This has
not happened before in the 17 years that the awards show has been
on the air and we will take precautionary measures to see that it
will not happen in future telecasts.''
   ABC may use a seven-second delay in the future, she said.
   A receptionist at Geffen Records, the band's label, said
telephone lines were jammed at the company's Sunset Boulevard
offices and no one was available for comment.
   ``Live programming leads to spontaneous occurrences and
unfortunately last night's was regrettable,'' Dick Clark, producer
of the show, said in a statement. ``We will take all steps possible
toward preventing a recurrence.''
   Paul Shefrin, a publicist for Clark, said Clark's office had
received numerous calls complaining about the language, but he
couldn't determine how many.
   Five months ago, dick clark productions was victimized by
comedian Andrw Dice Clay when he used a profanity on the MTV Video
Music Awards. The Sept. 6 show was also televised live nationwide
on cable's music channel.
   MTV officials announced afterward that the comic was banned for
life from the cable channel.
   Guns N' Roses has offended before.
   Last year, the sponsors of an AIDS benefit concert in New York
dropped the band from the lineup because of anti-homosexual lyrics
on some of their songs. Among the songs deemed objectionable was
``One in a Million,'' which uses a degrading term for homosexuals
and implies they spread the disease.
   In October, lead singer Axl Rose told a Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum audience he was quitting the band because of excessive
drug use in the group. ``I just didn't want to see my friends slip
away,'' said Rose.
   He later apologized and said he wasn't leaving the group.

<TEXT>
   Nickelodeon's ``Nick at Nite'' service knows
its audience is the TV generation, so it will expand its lineup
this fall to include more old comedies and a new but old-style
cartoon series from animator Ralph Bakshi.
   ``The Patty Duke Show'' comes to the cable channel's night-time
lineup of nostalgia, which already includes such classics as ``Mr.
Ed,'' ``My Three Sons,'' ``The Donna Reed Show'' and ``Make Room
for Daddy.''
   Nickelodeon is also adding two more contemporary comedy
showcases. Beginning Sept. 12, viewers can see ``The Best of
`Saturday Night Live'' and ``SCTV'' back-to-back nightly, 10-11
p.m. EDT.
   ```Nick at Nite' is targeting the new American family. Our
demographics tell us that both kids and their parents are watching.
We're not sure who is dragging whom to the set _ the mom who loves
`Donna' and remembers it or the kid who just discovered `Mr. Ed,'
'' Nickelodeon Vice President Linda Kahn told a meeting of
television critics.
   ``We've decided we've become a Museum of Broadcasting with a
beer and a fridge thrown in for good measure,'' she said.
   Bakshi, who also appeared at the presentation to TV critics,
said his half-hour cartoon ``Tattertown'' would be an homage to the
old-style animation of the 1920s and '30s.
   The series is set in a village inhabited by cartoon characters.
   ``We'll have characters sitting in bars or in parks wondering
why didn't they make it; they could have been as big as Mickey, but
they didn't have an organization behind them,'' Bakshi said. The
concept sounds something like the wildly successful feature-length
animated film ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' which is set in 'Toon
Town.
   Bakshi said he created the concept for ``Tattertown'' back in
high school, but added, ``if it does sound like it (`Roger
Rabbit'), that's fine.'' For ``Tattertown,'' Bakshi said he will
create new characters, where ``Roger Rabbit'' featured cameos by
already famous cartoon characters.
   Bakshi didn't escape questions about his network cartoon show,
``Mighty Mouse,'' and the charge by conservative media critic Rev.
Donald Wildmon that Mighty Mouse snorted cocaine in one episode.
Bakshi said the mouse was sniffing flower petals, but later cut
those seconds from the episode to quiet the controversy.
   ``When an adult makes a statement enough times, the kids are
going to believe it, and I didn't want it to become an issues at
school _ did he or didn't he?'' said Bakshi, adding he has a
10-year-old son. He said if it had been an adult cartoon, he would
have resisted any changes, but in this case, ``my first concern was
with the kids.''
   ``Nick at Nite'' will also have its own satirical news show,
``Global Village,'' which boasts a similarly satirical promo, a
takeoff on the currently popular up-close, cinema verite
commercials. The ``Global Village'' motto is, ``If we don't cover
it, it doesn't matter.''
   As far day-time Nickelodeon, which features kids' programming,
the cable channel plans to add the new show ``Kids Court,'' in
which kids decide such issues as whether to turn in a friend for
cheating on a test, and who should have to fix a broken portable
stereo.
   There's also ``Eureka's Castle,'' a show aimed at pre-schoolers'
problems, such as being afraid of the dark or having to make a
telephone call. Kids will also get to vote in a Nickelodeon poll on
who should be president after a series of reports on the campaign
by a kid reporter. Nickelodeon announced it is developing a kids'
news show, but it will probably be a few years before it gets on
the air.
   MTV Networks, which owns Nickelodeon, also announced some
changes for its music video channel VH-1. That channel, aimed at
older viewers, is going this fall to a half-hour format rather than
radio-like continuous music. Each half hour, viewers will get an
entertainment news update, a video, a comedy short, another video,
then a ``time capsule'' look back at a moment in history before the
half hour concludes with more videos.

   Elsewhere in television:
   MTV DISCOVERS DICK CLARK _ Music television veteran Dick Clark
will produce the ``1988 MTV Video Music Awards,'' to be broadcast
live from Los Angeles on Sept. 7. Arsenio Hall will be co-host. The
other co-host will be announced later, MTV officials said. ``Our
purpose is not to change that little off-center feel that MTV
brings to all of their work, but to organize and bring it in
hopefully on time,'' said Clark, who launched ``American
Bandstand'' in 1952. ...
   SPEAKING OF AWARDS SHOWS _ ``Saturday Night Live'' executive
producer Lorne Michaels plans, not surprisingly, to introduce a
note of comedy into the Emmy Awards show which he is producing for
the first time this year. The show airs Aug. 28. Michaels says
since it's the 40th anniversary of the awards, the show will
feature montages of shows with similar themes, such as how a
problem might have been solved in family sitcoms, dating from
``Father Knows Best'' to ``Growing Pains.'' Also as a note of
nostalgia, Michaels plans to put a band on stage _ probably
including SNL bandleader G.E. Smith _ and bring back the phrase,
``May I have the envelope please?''

   As campus crusades go, it will never be the rallying cry
of a generation. But some college students have become
fervent confectionery objectors.
   Several students at Clark University are on a mission to
save their chocolate namesake, the Clark bar. With its bright
red-and-blue packaging and crunchy blend of peanut butter,
nuts and chocolate, the 105-year-old bar has been a venerable
survivor of the candy-counter wars.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But last year, the Clark bar's owner, the Leaf Inc. unit
of Huhtamaki Oy, of Finland, announced it would close the
candy's manufacturing plant in Pittsburgh if a buyer couldn't
be found. Leaf tried to turn the once-profitable regional
confection into a national brand when the candy industry
consolidated in the 1980s, only to find it lacked the
marketing clout of better-financed rivals.
   When news of the sweet's impending demise reached Clark
University in Worcester, Mass., the great candy crusade
began. After all, the school hands out bars to students as
part of a survival kit during final-exam week, and a campus
singing group is named the Clark Bars.
   Spearheading the campaign was Jennifer Leone, a
21-year-old senior who concedes that not all students were
moved by the cause. "I remember one girl started laughing
when I asked her to sign a petition to save the Clark bar,"
she says.
   The bar enthusiasts used the campaign to raise money for
the American Cancer Society. (A Clark student died of cancer
last year.) They sought out natural allies, checking Who's
Who and writing letters to 203 Clarks, including television
personality Dick Clark. The students also sent notes to
dozens of Clarks in the Worcester area.
   The missives alerted the Clarks that their bar was
endangered, and also requested a contribution for cancer
research. Dick Clark didn't respond, but dozens of other
Clarks did, including a lawyer in Little Rock, Ark.
   "He said he was proud to be part of the Clark family," Ms.
Leone says. She sent him 10 bars.
   The students raised $3,500, including a $1,000
contribution from Leaf. Jim Hanlon, chief executive officer
of Leaf North America, says no buyer for the Clark bar has
been found. He won't say how much longer the company will
wait before shutting the plant, but calls the response to the
campaign heartening. He notes: "It shows that the bar has
vitality."

   Pop dynamo George Michael and heavy
metal leaders Def Leppard were the top nominees Wednesday in the
16th annual American Music Awards, which choses winners by popular
vote.
   Michael, whose crossover album, ``Faith,'' has spawned six hit
singles over the last year and scored on both pop and soul charts,
was nominated as favorite male vocalist in the pop-rock and
soul-rhythm and blues categories and received favorite album
nominations in those same categories.
   Def Leppard was nominated in the pop-rock category for favorite
duo or group and favorite album for their ``Hysteria'' LP. They also
received the favorite artist and favorite album nominations in the
heavy metal category.
   Earning three nominations each for the awards were heavy metal
bands Guns N' Roses and Van Halen. Country music star Randy Travis
also earned three nominations.
   The awards show, set for broadcast Jan. 30 on ABC-TV, added heavy
metal and rap music to categories for this year while eliminating
video music awards.
   ``We did it several years ago with the disco era. We just added
the category. It seemed logical,'' producer Dick Clark said.
   Clark, who this year took over production of the annual MTV Video
Awards show, said videos had been eliminated because ``There are
other awards shows that seem to take care of that category.''
   The American Music Awards nomination categories this year include
pop-rock, soul-rhythm and blues, country, heavy metal and rap.
   Among the groups and performers receiving at least two
nominations were Alabama, Rick Astley, Tracy Chapman, D.J. Jazzy
Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Gladys
Knight &amp; The Pips, Run D.M.C., Salt-N-Pepa, George Strait, Al B.
Sure! and Steve Winwood.
   Nominees were announced by Jermaine Jackson and Rita Coolidge
during a morning news conference.
   Clark said this year's show will include tributes to Roy Orbison,
soul singer Brook Benton and pop singer Andy Gibb. All three died in
the last year. The show will also present an award of merit to an
artist yet to be announced for outstanding contributions to musical
entertainment.
   Hosts for this year's show will be Kenny Rogers, Anita Baker, Rod
Stewart and Debbie Gibson. They also will perform, along with Rick
Astley, Fleetwood Mac, Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine,
Guns N' Roses, K.T. Oslin, Randy Travis, and D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; The
Fresh Prince.
   Clark noted the American Music Awards show is traditionally the
second-highest rated awards show on television, next to the Oscars.
   Names of nominees are compiled from year-end sales charts of the
music industry trade publication Cash Box.
   Winners are selected by a public polling of 20,000 people who
receive ballots sent by Herbert Altman Communications Research Inc.
The ballots are counted by the Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co.
accounting firm.
   The Grammy Awards of the National Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences are determined by votes of artists and technicians in the
music industry. Nominees for those awards will be made Jan. 12.

<LEADPARA>  NOT SO long ago, the market for old TV musical specials was virtually

market for them.;    So, mostly they gathered dust on warehouse shelves or,
worse yet, were simply forgotten for so long that they were considered lost.  </LEADPARA>

(box) FRANK SINATRA: THE MAN AND HIS MUSIC
Tonight at 9 p.m., Disney Channel  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     There was a reason for the low value accorded vintage TV music shows by the
commercial broadcast networks: They depend on attracting a mass audience to
justify the huge costs charged for advertising spots, and nobody expects a
mass audience to tune in for yesterday's out-of-date music.;    But all that
is changing, thanks to the growth of cable television and the home-video
market, where it's standard practice to market entertainment to much more
specialized tastes.;    Example: Tonight's revival of the 1981 TV special
"Frank Sinatra: The Man and His Music," on the Disney Channel, a pay-cable
network. It's not being hidden away in the wee hours of the morning, but
begins at 9 p.m., the heart of prime time.;    The Sinatra show, which
features the legendary singer in concert with another legend, the late Count
Basie and his orchestra, is one of 13 Sinatra TV specials the Disney Channel
has been featuring in its "Sunday Night Showcase" series.;    These old
Sinatra shows not only are getting a major revival on one of America's most
popular cable networks, but also are becoming available in boxed sets of three
on the home-video market, where they're sold to hard-core Sinatra fans at
about $70 a pop.;    Naturally, long-running superstars of Sinatra's stature
are the kind whose earlier TV specials are most in demand. The Disney Channel
already has revived several Elvis Presley specials and has been running early
Judy Garland TV shows.;    Such programs are especially attractive to the
folks at Disney, who market their service to a mixed audience of youngsters
and older adults. They don't sell advertising, so there's no need to guarantee
anybody a huge rating for each show.;    Instead, pay networks such as Disney
are mainly interested in satisfying subscribers by appealing directly to their
tastes. Obviously, Disney research shows there's a demand for these old
musical shows, or they wouldn't be scheduling them so often.;    There's also
a brisk business in recycling vintage TV appearances by rock-and-roll stars of
the 1950s and '60s. Dick Clark, who controls perhaps the largest library of
vintage rock tapes and TV clips, markets his material so cannily that dust
never has time to collect. ABC already has ordered a 40th anniversary
"American Bandstand" special from Clark for next season, which will make heavy
use of Clark's library.;    The recent revival of the 15-minute and half-hour
Nat "King" Cole musical shows from the early 1950s on PBS stations may signal
yet another market for TV musical programs that generally were considered
arcane fare for the dust bin.;    In the meantime, tonight's Sinatra/Basie
concert on Disney is a rare treat for anybody who enjoys pop music with an
authentic jazz flavor, from the opener, "Nice and Easy," to "Thanks for the
Memory," which closes the show.;    The thought of shows like this just
sitting on a shelf for decades at a time is almost too much to bear. Thanks to
the emerging new markets for them, that may no longer be their ultimate fate.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Rainshowers canceled a huge shindig to
celebrate the construction of a 30-story pyramid, but organizers
said they would try again after mopping up flooded beer stands and
stages set up for street-party bands.
   The party will go on tonight, weather permitting.
   ``It just got to a point tonight that the decision got taken out
of our hands. It rained so hard that we've got pools of water,''
developer Sidney Shlenkler said Friday.
   Promoters had promised for weeks that the event would be the
biggest party Memphis had ever seen. Police had expected up to
100,000 people, and several thousand would-be revelers showed up
despite the downpour.
   At a luncheon to kick off the celebration, rock 'n' roll pioneer
Dick Clark announced he will supply hundreds of videotapes, films
and other memorabilia for a music museum in the pyramid.
   Clark, who helped popularize rock 'n' roll with his TV show
American Bandstand, said the music hall of fame will be linked to
his annual American Music Awards show and include computerized
displays with recordings and videotapes of the nation's musical past.
   The stainless steel pyramid, which is being built along the
Mississippi River, is intended as the centerpiece of a $200 million
tourist theme park billed as a musical Disneyland and scheduled to
open in May 1991.
   The pyramid and music park are being financed largely through
public funds and developed primarily by Shlenker, who helped develop
the Houston Astrodome, and by international businessman John Tigrett.
   Shlenker likes to compare the pyramid with the Eiffel Tower and
the Statue of Liberty and said he expects the music theme park to
eventually draw up to 3 million tourists a year.

DEEJAY, 84, IS STILL SPINNING PLATTERS;

AT HIS AGE, HE'S SOME KIND OF RECORD HOLDER IN THE BUSINESS

When Frank Meyers dusts off an oldie from his record collection and slaps it on
his turntable, it's a real oldie. Frank Meyers is 84 years old. That's young
for a piece of classical music, perhaps, but pretty old for a disc jockey still
trying to make toes tap and joints jump.
</P>
<P>
Dick Clark, for instance, was a schoolboy when Meyers started spinning
platters. Glenn Miller was still a struggling band leader. Wolfman Jack's voice
had yet to change. And the long-playing record hadn't been invented.
</P>
<P>
Meyers is a performer who knows his audience. When he spins records tonight at
a Valentine's dance at the Hotel Knickerbocker in Hollywood, hundreds of
retirees are expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
Meyers said his 1,000-record collection is filled with romantic songs and Big
Band ballads that can set the oldest of hearts beating and toes tapping. And if
that doesn't work, he'll even toss in "a little rock 'n' roll" -- tunes from
the '50s.
</P>
<P>
"None of this hard-rock stuff," Meyers said. "I play real music. Things that
really swing."
</P>
<P>
The energetic Meyers has been doing that kind of swinging since he purchased
his first portable sound system in 1941, signed up for a night school
announcing class and began playing at parties, weddings and dances.
</P>
<P>
He had worked in Canada as a carnival shooting gallery operator, welder and
accountant before deciding that music was his life.
</P>
<P>
"I was playing records for $7 a night. Pretty soon, I got so many jobs that I
had to hire four other boys to help me out," Meyers recalls.
</P>
<P>
As his fame as a Toronto disc jockey grew in the 1940s, Meyers rented a small
ballroom and staged his own dances for adults. In the 1950s, he launched a
nightclub for teen-agers. By 1960, he was running a discotheque called
Frankie's Surf Club, large enough for 600 dancers at a time.
</P>
<P>
Meyers sold out and moved to California in 1965, working for an aircraft parts
company and as an apartment manager while continuing part-time jockeying of
discs.
</P>
<P>
"Playing at bowling banquets was a big thing then," he recalled. "I was never
on the radio. I never made a name for myself like Dick Clark. That's my big
regret.
</P>
<P>
"After night school, I got a radio job offer at a little 2-by-4 station for $80
a month. But at the time I was buying a convertible for $85 a month, so I
couldn't afford it."
</P>
<P>
Although no piece of officialdom seems to keep track of party disc jockeys,
Meyers figures he is this country's oldest active deejay. Officials of the
National Assn. of Broadcasters said Tuesday they know of no one on the air who
is older -- although legendary New York radio personality Hal Jackson is
celebrating his 50th year in the business this month.
</P>
<P>
Because of space problems in his one-room, 12-by-16-foot apartment at the Hotel
Knickerbocker, Meyers has converted about half of his albums and 78 r.p.m.
platters to tape cassettes for his shows. His collection includes
Charleston-type music popular in the 1930s, Big Band music of the '40s, ballads
of the '50s and "soft" pop music from the '60s.
</P>
<P>
There's not a Beatles tune in the bunch. Or disco or heavy metal.
</P>
<P>
Or rap.
</P>
<P>
"I never went in for any of that," he said. "That stuff leaves me out in the
cold. I don't speak that language."
</P>
<P>
That's music to the ears of those who will be in Meyers' Valentine's dance
crowd tonight.
</P>
<P>
"I'm too old for romance," joked 73-year-old Mildred Feldman, a Glenn Miller
fan who will be there. "But I still love his music."
</P>
<P>
Lester Lees, 78, said he will be listening for "the old-time" tunes from the
'50s. "That's my kind of music," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dave Maier, a 1928 Golden Gloves boxing champion, said he will also be there to
listen. "I'm 81. I don't dance anymore," he said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
But Meyers figures that his dance contest prizes will lure the crowd to its
feet, even if his music doesn't. Along with cash, he'll give away bags of
groceries.
</P>
<P>
"That's what older people need," he said.

HOME TECH CD CORNER: 2 ALBUMS OPEN ED SULLIVAN COLLECTION

<P>
Quite amazingly, one of the nation's most celebrated pop music treasure chests
-- the Ed Sullivan television show library -- has never been available on
record. Until now.
</P>
<P>
Dick Clark's "American Bandstand" may have been the everyday TV home of rock
'n' roll in the '50s and '60s, but Sullivan's Sunday-night CBS variety show was
the most important TV showcase for all music -- from rock and jazz to country
and classical.
</P>
<P>
Steve Gottlieb, a former Wall Street lawyer who made a splash in the record
business in the mid-'80s with a series of albums devoted to television theme
songs, has arranged with the Sullivan estate to release music from the shows in
a series of 25 or more albums.
</P>
<P>
The first two volumes in the series, which is titled "The Sullivan Years" and
is available through Gottlieb's TVT Records, are devoted to jazz great Louis
Armstrong and the '60s British rock invasion.
</P>
<P>
The Armstrong package features 18 performances, including "Mack the Knife" and
"Hello, Dolly!" The "British Invasion" album consists of 16 tunes by such '60s
rock groups as the Animals, Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas and Herman's
Hermits.
</P>
<P>
The next volume, titled "The Mod Sound" and due next week, features 17 songs by
such '60s outfits as the Mamas &amp; the Papas, the Fifth Dimension and Spanky
&amp; Our Gang.
</P>
<P>
Why has this music -- an estimated 9,000 performances -- remained stored all
these years in a vault at a CBS warehouse in New Jersey?
</P>
<P>
"Some people approached (the estate) with the idea of skimming the catalogue .
. . just using Elvis or the Beatles or (Barbra) Streisand," said Gottlieb, who
spent two years pursuing the rights. "Our approach was to put together a
comprehensive series."

   Dick Clark is justifiably proud of
his place in rock 'n' roll history, but he admits he wouldn't have
minded being a headliner instead of a host.
   ``My only regret is that I didn't study more on the piano,''
Clark said in a recent interview. ``I've gotten awards where I'm
mentioned in the same company of musicians, and while it makes me
proud, it also humbles me.''
   Still, he said, ``I may not be a king of rock 'n' roll ... but I
certainly was there playing midwife.''
   Clark, who hosted ``American Bandstand'' on television for more
than 30 years, will play host to The Spinners, The Guess Who, The
Association and The Drifters in the ``American Bandstand Concert
Tour'' at Bally's Grand Hotel Casino on Saturday.
   The tour is one of Clark's first performing jobs since he gave
the reins of ``American Bandstand'' over to his hand-picked
successor, David Hirsch, 26, earlier this year.
   Clark, who was 26 when he took over ``Bandstand'' and now is 59,
concedes that he stepped down reluctantly.
   ``It's one of those things I didn't want to say goodbye to,'' he
said. ``But I was getting out of an age range with the kids that I
was comfortable with.''

   A 17-year-old girl who allegedly took part in a
pornographic videotape with actor Rob Lowe reportedly told her
next-door neighbor that she planned to blackmail the star for $2
million.
   The neighbor's statement was contained in a court affidavit
filed last summer in Cobb County Superior Court as part of the
girl's parents' divorce, The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta
Constitution reported Wednesday.
   The girl's mother filed a civil lawsuit in Fulton County on May
12 seeking unspecified civil damages from Lowe, and prosecutors are
considering possible criminal charges against the 24-year-old Brat
Pack star for exploitation of a minor. The girl was 16 at the time
of the alleged incident.
   News reports have said the girl, who turned 17 in April,
apparently met Lowe in Atlanta during last summer's Democratic
National Convention.
   An acquaintance said in an affidavit filed in the Cobb County
case that the girl said she and another woman had sex with Lowe
``and that they all took turns filming each other,'' the newspapers
reported.
   Television stations that have aired edited portions of the tape
have said it depicts the girl and another woman having sex, with
Lowe directing them off camera. The stations also say the tape
contains scenes of the actor and a male companion having sex with a
third woman.
   Lowe's public relations firm issued a statement late Tuesday
that Lowe ``will have no comment until the matter is resolved.''

   Some seventh-graders at Cedar
Springs Middle School hoped President Bush would give a warm
reception to their suggestions for running the country. So they
wrapped them in long johns.
   The letters, mailed Tuesday, were part of a spelling project
initiated by English teacher Janet Wilson. Students studied various
national and international problems, then wrote Bush to offer their
solutions.
   Homelessness and drug abuse were the students' major concerns.
Several suggested hiring the unemployed to build housing for the
homeless.
   The mailing included a pair of personalized flannel long johns
for the president reading ``I'm behind America'' and a nightgown
for first lady Barbara Bush.

   A founder of H&amp;R Block Inc. and his wife
have donated nearly $1 million to create a park to honor cancer
survivors.
   Richard and Annette Bloch said the park would be the first of
several similar facilities in cities in the United States and
Canada with populations of more than 1 million.
   Bloch survived a bout with lung cancer that was diagnosed in
1978.
   Mrs. Bloch said the centerpiece of the Kansas City park would be
a life-size bronze sculpture with eight figures representing people
going through a maze denoting cancer treatment and recovery.
   The park is to be named the Richard and Annette Bloch Cancer
Survivors Park.
   ``The important thing is to show that there is life with cancer;
there is life after cancer,'' Mrs. Bloch said Tuesday.

   The curator of Harvard University's
prestigious Nieman Fellowship for journalists is taking a medical
leave of absence, the fellowship office announced Wednesday.
   Howard Simons, 59, is suffering from pancreatic cancer,
according to Lois Fiore, the assistant to the curator. An interim
successor was not immediately named.
   Simons was a Nieman fellow himself in 1958, and then rose from
science reporter at The Washington Post to become managing editor
in 1971. In that role, he helped oversee the newspaper's Pulitzer
Prize-winning coverage of the Watergate scandal.
   In 1984 Simons took charge of the Nieman program, a one-year
fellowship allowing mid-career journalists to pursue a year of
unrestricted study with a stipend.

   Ireland's deputy prime minister was
recuperating Wednesday after undergoing a liver transplant at the
Mayo Clinic, according to Irish Embassy officials.
   Brian Lenihan, 58, underwent the surgery Tuesday night, embassy
officials in Washington said.
   Neither the Mayo Clinic nor the Irish Embassy would identify the
nature of Lenihan's liver ailment. However, Angela Phelan, a
reporter and columnist with the Irish Independent, said Lenihan
suffered from hemochromatosis, a disorder that causes excess iron
in the tissues.
   Lenihan, who also is minister of foreign affairs, and his wife,
Anne, have been in Rochester since May 2, the Rochester
Post-Bulletin reported Wednesday.

<LEADPARA>  MANY critics, including this one, predicted cable's ACE awards would wither
and die once the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences let cable programs
compete for Emmys.;    Well, that happened a couple of years ago and the ACE
awards still are going strong, celebrating their 12th anniversary tonight with
the televised presentation of their honors for 1990.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  RACE IS ON FOR BEST OF CABLE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cable;  TV Editor Ron Miller is a former national judge for the ACE awards.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Unlike the Emmys, which are telecast by one broadcast network (currently
Fox) while the other three all counter-program fiercely, the ACES are telecast
simultaneously on eight different cable networks, so the winners will get the
maximum exposure to viewers.;    The live 6 p.m. telecast from the Wiltern
theater in Los Angeles will be carried by Black Entertainment Television
(BET), The Discovery Channel, The Family Channel, HA!, Lifetime, Nick at Nite,
TBS and TNT.;    That spirit of cooperation is what the ACE awards are all
about. The cable networks see the show boosting their industry by reminding
viewers how much good stuff is now available only on cable.;    Why do the
ACEs still exist when the same shows now can win more prestigious Emmys?
Here's an educated guess: Cable folks love awards just as much as broadcast
people, but the TV Academy just doesn't give them enough.;    If you watch
tonight's ACE telecast, you'll see nothing but cable awards. The National
Academy of Cable Programming, which makes the awards, doesn't engage in the
sort of tokenism that has characterized cable's modest showing at the Emmys so
far.;    You might also see an entertaining show, produced by Dick Clark,
hosted by actor James Woods and featuring such celebrity names as James Earl
Jones, Bob Saget, Debbie Reynolds, Leonard Nimoy, Blair Brown and many more.;
  Here are nominees in the major categories:;     Best Movie or Miniseries:
"Max and Helen," (TNT); "The Last Elephant" (TNT), "Age-Old Friends" (HBO),
"The Image" (HBO), "Heat Wave" (TNT).;    Best Actor, Movie or Miniseries:

NOBLE BROADCAST'S BID TO BUY RADIO NETWORKS FALTERS;

Noble Broadcast Group's $200-million bid for two radio networks, a deal that
would have put the San Diego-based radio chain in the front rank in number of
U. S. listeners, has been turned down, Noble chairman John Lynch said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
San Diego-based Noble said the offer for New York-based United Stations and
Colorado Springs-based Transtar is still on the table and he is optimistic that
his company and the networks will come to an agreement "down the road." The
deal has been in negotiations for three months and has been followed widely in
the broadcast industry.
</P>
<P>
United Stations President Nick Verbitsky acknowledged the offer Wednesday,
saying only that "we talk to a lot of people, and we get offers all the time."
Verbitsky, who with Dick Clark is a principal shareholder of United, said "your
guess is as good as mine" when asked the chances of striking a deal with Noble.
</P>
<P>
Fast-growing Noble owns 18 radio stations, including XTRA-FM and AM in San
Diego, up from two stations four years ago. To raise equity capital for the
purchase of the networks, Nobel last month sold two Boston stations, WSSH-AM
and FM, to a group led by entertainer Merv Griffin.
</P>
<P>
Lynch said Noble's long-term goal is to own a major radio network in order to
better exercise control over Noble's "inventory," or programming, and Noble
will continue to look for suitable network acquisitions. Noble also plans to
acquire more stations over the next year or two to reach the maximum 24
stations allowed by the Federal Communications Commission, Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
31 Weekly Programs
</P>
<P>
Closely held United Stations bought the RKO radio network in April 1985 and
also owns a programming production company, Verbitsky said. The network
produces about 31 weekly programs, including Dick Clark's weekly Top 40
countdown show, that are sold to 1,200 affiliates.
</P>
<P>
Transtar sells eight 24-hour radio formats, ranging from Top 40 and Golden
Oldies to country-western and big band, which are fed to 1,400 affiliate
stations via satellite. Transtar also produces a rock-'n'-roll countdown show
featuring comedian John Candy and owns a radio market-research firm.
</P>
<P>
Transtar principals C. T. Robinson and Bill Moyes were unavailable for comment
Wednesday.

   It is nice to be 82 and still a working
journalist. But Alistair Cooke, who is both, reports one problem
when young reporters arrive to interview him:
   ``I am at the stage where I ask, `Does the name Adolf Hitler
mean anything to you?'''
   Despite this gentle reminder that those who forget history are
doomed to see it repeated on cable, Cooke has prevailed in
broadcasting and will take due note of it early in the new year -
on Jan. 13, to be precise.
   He'll celebrate his 20th anniversary then as host of PBS'
``Masterpiece Theatre,'' commencing a nine-week retrospective of
some of its better-known dramatic bundles from Britain. But of
course they include ``Upstairs, Downstairs,'' ``I, Claudius,'' and
``The Jewel in the Crown.''
   If that's not enough, PBS will offer a Jan. 24 parody of the
series, ``Masterpiece Tonight,'' concocted by Gerard Alessandrini,
whose ``Forbidden Broadway'' here regularly applies the needle to
Broadway musicals.
   A transplanted Englishman who gives urbane a good name, Cooke
has been the only host of ``Masterpiece Theatre'' since it began on
Jan. 10, 1971 with ``The First Churchills'' - one of his
least-favorite shows, incidentally.
   An elegant man, he favors blue blazers, gray slacks, and the
graceful turn of phrase. Also jazz piano.
   Born in Manchester, and a U.S. citizen since 1941, he first came
here as a student in 1932. He returned as a man of print and
broadcast who since 1938 has tried to explain America to the
British, no mean feat.
   In 1970, he embarked upon an even more difficult feat -
explaining America to the Americans - in his acclaimed ``America''
series, a BBC co-production that NBC aired in prime time in
1972-73. The show won four Emmies.
   But it also almost prevented him from signing up for
``Masterpiece Theatre.'' He was in Boston, filming the third
``America'' episode, when accosted by a young British producer,
Christopher Sarson.
   The ``Masterpiece'' idea - hosting a weekly series of British
dramas adapted from famous novels - was explained. Cooke begged
off, saying he'd be tied up on ``America'' for two years and
constantly travelling.
   But Sarson ``was a deadpan scoundrel - and terrifically
persuasive,'' he said.
   A veteran America-watcher whose dossier of pals and influences
includes H.L. Mencken, Cooke will celebrate another milestone in
March.
   That will be his 45th anniversary of commenting on his adopted
country's wild and sometimes disturbing ways in ``Letter From
America,'' a 14-minute weekly report he delivers on radio for the
BBC.
   Heard via short-wave in 52 countries, including this one, he
likens what he calls ``my talks'' to ``a diary, in a way, written
for a friend.''
   He comments on whatever strikes his fancy, sad or funny, minute
or of great import and consequence (he does admit, gently laughing,
that he has yet to give the once-over to Madonna and her amazing
mondo video).
   It's his proud semiboast that in all the years of ``Letter'' he
hasn't missed a week, although ``we came damn close a few months
ago'' when he had to go to a hospital here for a prostate
operation.
   Arrangements were made for him to tape that week's show in the
hospital's boardroom. They rolled him there in a wheelchair,
accompanied by two public relations officials, ``both stunning,''
from the hospital.
   He recalls telling them, ``What a pity we didn't have a
photographer with us. It's the first time in 44 years that I've
broadcast with a catheter bag.''
   As befits a man of his years and travels, he occasionally is
asked to compare the America of, say, 1940, with the America of
today. Given the chance to go cosmic, he instead offers a
refreshing, unexpected answer.
   ``I couldn't do it,'' he says. ``The standard thing is to talk
about the loss of innocence. Every generation thinks it was
innocent when it was young. It wasn't innocent. It was young.''
   He smiles when asked when, if ever, he'll sign off the air and
retire.
   ``Oh, it may happen tomorrow. I live from day to day, and it's
not for me to decide that. But I don't have any intention of doing
that. I think when you retire, you keel over.''
   ---
   Elsewhere in television ...
   SHOULD AULD ACQUAINTANCE BE FORGOT, IT'S FOR A DARN GOOD REASON:
The usual New Year's shows are loose on the networks starting at
11:30 p.m. EST tonight. CBS has ``Happy New Year America, 1991,''
hosted by Melissa Manchester and featuring Terry Bradshaw in Times
Square. That's where NBC's Jane Pauley also will be as part of a
live ``Tonight'' guest-hosted by Jay Leno. Yet another star, Dick
Clark, is checking in from Times Square for ``Dick Clark's New
Year's Rockin' Eve '91.''

   Paul McCartney, Dick Clark, Miles Davis and
the late Vladimir Horowitz and Nat King Cole will receive lifetime
achievement awards at this year's Grammy Awards ceremonies.
   McCartney, Clark and Davis have agreed to appear Feb. 21 at the
Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles for the Grammy telecast, said
Michael Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording
Artists.
   McCartney's impact on music as a songwriter and member of the
Beatles, as well as his continuing growth as a solo performer were
cited as reasons for his award.
   Davis played a crucial role in the development of jazz since the
1940s, the academy said.
   Horowitz was included because many consider him the 20th
century's greatest classical pianist, and Cole was cited as a
leading singer of the 1940s and 1950s.
   The inclusion of Clark was a surprise because he produces the
American Music Awards, which competes with the Grammys. The shows
are a month apart and many artists will appear on only one show,
fearing overexposure.
   ``We don't view these shows as competitive and when you look at
the big contribution Clark has made to the recording industry,
especially in exposing new talent, there is no question he is
deserving,'' Greene said.
   Clark will receive the Trustees Award because he is a
non-performing contributor to music. Past recipients include
inventors Thomas Edison and Robert Moog.

   Do television viewers need another program
showcasing the video gimmickry of video camera owners? NBC seems to
think so.
   The network will broadcast the premiere of ``Do-It-Yourself TV''
Sunday night, a slightly different but unmistakable hybrid of
ABC-TV's top-rated ``America's Funniest Home Videos.''
   Dick Clark, who is producing and serving as co-host of the new
show, says he thinks people love to watch the latest rave, no
matter how many times it's duplicated.
   He should know. When he did ``TV's Bloopers &amp; Practical Jokes''
for NBC six years ago, it started its own copycat bonanza. ABC
quickly announced it was doing a celebrity show called ``Foul-ups,
Bleeps &amp; Blunders.''
   How many video shows can the market stand?
   ``They asked the same question when `Bloopers' came to the
fore,'' Clark said Thursday in a phone interview from New York,
``and there were three on at the time.''
   ``Bloopers'' had some home video segments, ``but we weren't
smart enough to think of home video bloopers,'' Clark said.
   ``People in our office were somewhat exercised'' by the success
of ABC's home video show, which premiered as a series in January,
four years after ``Bloopers'' was canceled, Clark said.
   ``If you're not smart enough to think of a new angle, you can't
feel bad about it,'' he said.
   When NBC approached Clark about ``Do-It-Yourself TV,'' a new
angle was exactly what the network wanted.
   CBS had virtually owned Sunday evenings, beginning with the 7
p.m. broadcast of its venerable ``60 Minutes.'' But ABC, with a
program that showed America's warts and stumbles, was now No. 1 in
the time spot.
   For ```Do-It-Yourself TV,'' we came back with the idea of
sending these amateur videographers out on assignment,'' Clark
said. ``There's nothing socially redeeming about these assignments,
they're just crazy.''
   Like having six fully uniformed motorcycle cops singing
``Feelings'' and ``Stop in the Name of Love,'' taping how silly
people look and sound when they sing along to earphones on their
heads, and a pizzeria where the customers are invited to throw a
little dough.
   ``You're not going to learn anything. You're not going to retain
any of it,'' Clark said. ``It's like junk food. It's entertainment.
And I'm not ashamed of that.''

   Country music singer Barbara Mandrell
used ringers to win a come-from-behind victory over a team led by
Bob Hope in the Barbara Mandrell Celebrity Softball Classic.
   A host of celebrities including talk show host Oprah Winfrey,
entertainer Dick Clark, rock musician Meat Loaf and rap musician
L.L. Cool J turned out for the 18-17 victory Friday by Mandrell's
AT&amp;T Ringers over Hope's Pepsi Challengers.
   Before the game, Hope was anything but pessimistic.
   ``Pay no attention to Barbara's team,'' the comedian said.
``We're gonna kill 'em. We're gonna win, even if we have to cheat.''
   Mandrell literally got a lift from former Pittsburgh Steelers
great Lynn Swann during one of her trips to the plate. Swann
hoisted the petite singer parallel to the ground, and began
swinging his new ``bat.''
   In the second inning, John Stamos, the heartthrob of the ``Full
House'' television show, strutted to the plate and made two strikes
before grounding to Ron Perlman, star of the ``Beauty and the
Beast.'' TV show. Stamos joked he ``was a lover not an athlete.''
   ``I'll be the judge of that,'' said pop star Sheena Easton.
   Proceeds from the game went to the Vanderbilt University Medical
Center transplant program.

It was fitting that Diet Coke launched its high-powered George Michael ad
campaign on the American Music Awards telecast.
</P>
<P>
The annual pop special itself is simply one long -- very l-o-n-g -- commercial.
</P>
<P>
When pop stars (including Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood) weren't seen hawking
beer in conventional commercials during Monday's three-hour event, they were on
stage hyping themselves.
</P>
<P>
Unlike next month's Grammy Awards ceremony, where the emphasis is on artistic
achievement, the American Music Awards is simply an excuse for a television
program. No sin in that, but it does make performers look a bit silly when they
shed tears and repeatedly thank God for their trophies.
</P>
<P>
The "awards" are based on results of a national popularity poll conducted among
approximately 20,000 music fans -- which helps explain how Whitney Houston
could defeat Tracy Chapman for recordings in 1988 and how the "Dirty Dancing"
sound track could defeat anything.
</P>
<P>
If Dick Clark Productions gave out the pyramid-shaped trophies at a private
dinner, they would be lucky to have enough stars on hand to generate one good
trade publication publicity photo.
</P>
<P>
Because the awards are handed out on prime-time television, however, artists
scurry for seats. The lure: 60 seconds or so for the winners at the podium.
</P>
<P>
If that exposure isn't enticing enough, superstars can look forward to special
awards and -- crucially -- extra time.
</P>
<P>
Two special awards and 16 minutes of exposure were enough to lure the normally
reclusive Michael Jackson to the Shrine Auditorium stage, where another
superstar, comedian Eddie Murphy, obediently narrated a gushing
mini-documentary of Jackson's recent "Bad" tour.
</P>
<P>
It's not as if Jackson had to fight to get the 16 minutes and the awards. The
show's producers would have given him 26 minutes because it's a coup having
Jackson involved at all.
</P>
<P>
Even Murphy, whose persona is based on his ultra-confident manner, seemed
intimidated by Jackson's transcendent fame.
</P>
<P>
When the pop star stepped to the microphone to accept the awards, he discovered
the stand was too low. After trying to bend over awkwardly to reach the
microphone, the unnerved Jackson stepped back and asked Murphy to adjust the
stand for him.
</P>
<P>
Murphy moved forward like an eager stage hand before remembering that he, too,
is a star and that it wasn't his job to fix the microphone stand.
</P>
<P>
In Murphy's only spontaneous -- and funny -- remark, he quipped, "(Michael)
said, 'Eddie pull it up,' like I was working for him . . . and I started to do
it, too, 'Yes Michael.' "
</P>
<P>
Though Willie Nelson also received a special award (and 9 minutes of TV time),
the evening's co-star was the other Michael -- George Michael.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Jackson's 16-minute salute served in the end to further enhance the
status of his pop rival from Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
The much ballyhooed Diet Coke commercial didn't have much fizz: scenes of a
matador preparing for battle juxtaposed against scenes of pop star Michael
getting ready to face his fans on stage.
</P>
<P>
But the English pop star's victories in three American Music Awards categories
(most popular R&amp;B album, male R&amp;B singer and male pop/rock singer) did
leave their mark.
</P>
<P>
Because Michael Jackson was also nominated in the two latter categories, the
message for millions of viewers was that George Michael -- despite all the
excitement of the 16 minutes of "Bad" tour footage" -- was the more popular
record-maker in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Equally impressive was the graceful way the young Englishman handled himself at
the podium.
</P>
<P>
Though his "Faith" album has sold more than 6 million copies in the United
States alone, Michael is still struggling to win credibility as an artist -- a
goal made more difficult by his former membership in the lightweight British
pop duo Wham!
</P>
<P>
Michael may be reading more into the awards than the voting decrees, but there
was a disarming sense of genuine humility in his remarks each time he accepted
an award.
</P>
<P>
"I'd just like to say that a couple of years back when I split the (duo), I
knew I had a tough job ahead of me . . . and I thought that maybe people
weren't going to give me much of a chance," he said in his final visit to the
podium.
</P>
<P>
"So, I'd just like to thank everybody . . . for giving me that chance and
letting me prove myself."
</P>
<P>
If the head-to-head competition between the two Michaels produced a true moment
of drama in an evening of unabashed self-promotion, most of the telecast was as
flat as the Diet Coke spot.
</P>
<P>
With the array of stars on stage (from country's Randy Travis to rap's D.J.
Jazzy Jeff), one certainly got a look at the range of commercial pop music
these days. But it was surface rather than substance.
</P>
<P>
Except for Guns N' Roses' defiant rendition of "Patience," the live
performances (ranging from Rick Astley and Sade to the Miami Sound Machine and
K.T. Oslin) were uneventful, and the evening's co-hosts (Kenny Rogers, Anita
Baker, Rod Stewart and Debbie Gibson) were uninspired.
</P>
<P>
Maybe next year the producers ought to acknowledge the program's TV-show
foundation and invite Oprah, Phil and Geraldo to co-host. That'd probably boost
ratings -- and those three certainly know the realities of television
self-promotion.

   Julie Brown wants you to know that her
character on MTV's ``Just Say Julie'' is, to put it simply, sort of
crazy.
   If you've seen her ditsy cartoon of an empty-headed Valley girl,
you might agree. It's a persona she's honed with albums like
``Goddess in Progress'' and such songs and videos as ``Homecoming
Queen's Got a Gun,'' ``I Like 'Em Big and Stupid'' and ``Trapped in
the Body of a White Girl.''
   She co-wrote the movie ``Earth Girls Are Easy,'' in which she
also had a starring role, from one of her songs.
   Brown's weekly half-hour show is a tongue-in-cheek way of
introducing rock videos. It's set in her tacky condo, where friends
and relatives occasionally drop by.
   ``I make fun of the videos,'' Brown said. ``Some of them are
pretty lame. After all, if it's rock 'n' roll, it should be a
little rebellious. Poking fun at them is in the spirit of rock 'n'
roll. MTV never told me to do that. They just said, `Here's the
show.'
   ``You know, when television first started, Ernie Kovacs did a
lot of experimental comedy,'' she said. ``That was before the
networks started research to see if their shows would appeal to
people. I think research is killing a lot of good shows before they
ever get on the air. It destroys innovation and originality.''
   Brown speaks from experience. Her pilot ``Julie Brown: The
Show'' was broadcast by CBS last summer.
   ``I got amazing reviews,'' she said. ``But the research wasn't
good enough to get it on the air. Then they came up with something
called `Peaceable Kingdom.' No wonder the networks are losing their
audience to cable, because cable's still willing to experiment.''
   ``Peaceable Kingdom'' was an undistinguished drama on CBS' fall
schedule that died a quick and merciful death.
   Brown is in her second season on MTV. Of the cable music
network's three female video jockeys, two are named Julie Brown.
The other is better known as ``Downtown'' Julie Brown.
   Don't think for a moment that Brown is like her character. She
did grow up in the San Fernando Valley, the Valley Girl's natural
habitat, but she studied acting at the prestigious American
Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco. She's been a standup comic
and she writes her own offbeat songs.
   She and her regular writing partner, Charlie Coffey _ they wrote
the ``Earth Girls are Easy'' screenplay with Terence E. McNally _
have several more movies in development: ``Medusa: Portrait of a
Pop Legend,'' in which Brown would play a pop music superstar, and
``Totally Witchin','' a musical about a woman possessed by a
witch's spirit.
   Brown began doing a standup comedy act with Coffey while
attending ACT in San Francisco.
   ``Most female comics were taking sexuality out of their acts,''
she said. ``I thought that was a shame. Marilyn Monroe could be
sexy and funny at the same time. When I started 11 years ago, a lot
of women were doing self-deprecating humor _ `I can't get a date.'
I wasn't going to do that. I thought I was attractive.
   ``Charlie and I were very successful in San Francisco, but
people in Los Angeles didn't understand our humor,'' she said.
``Charlie left the act and I was doing a single. It's tough because
you have to be aggressive with the audience. Then I began singing,
and once I did that it became a whole new thing.''
   Brown appeared in such movies as ``Any Which Way You Can'' and
``Police Academy 2,'' and was a guest on such shows as ``The
Jeffersons,'' ``Happy Days,'' ``Laverne and Shirley'' and
``Newhart,'' where she appeared several times as airhead weather
girl Buffy Denver.
   Before starting her half-hour show on MTV, she had made several
guest appearances as a video jockey. In her early appearances, she
came on and said she was ``Downtown'' Julie Brown, who is black. At
the time, she was promoting her album ``Trapped in a White Girl's
Body.''
   When MTV offered her a show, she said, she didn't want to move
to New York.
   ``I'm an actress, and I felt that would take me out of acting,''
she said. ``We reached a solution and I do the show here. As long
as I show three videos on each show, I can do anything I want. I
can break into a video and say, `Stop, I have something to say.'''

<HEAD>Ed McMahon Marks 30 Years as Johnny Carson's Sidekick</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Johnny Carson and Ed McMahon recently
celebrated the 26th anniversary of ``The Tonight Show,'' but their
association goes back four more years.
   It was 30 years ago when they started working together, when
Carson was host of a game show called ``Who Do You Trust?'' and
McMahon was hired to be the announcer.
   ``Our relationship was established the very first day,'' McMahon
recalled. ``I introduced the show, then I brought him the list of
questions. He jumped and said, `Lothar, you startled me!'
   Lothar was the faithful sidekick to ``Mandrake the Magician'' in
the newspaper comic strip. When Mandrake's magic wasn't enough,
Lothar supplied the muscle.
   ``That set our relationship. Lots of humor and kidding. A lot of
playing on my size, being a happy-go-lucky Irishman. All the things
we've done on `The Tonight Show' were set up and tested on `Who Do
You Trust?'
   ``Johnny's the boss,'' said McMahon. ``You have to remember
that, but I get my two cents' worth in there. His many marriages _
it's always good for a joke. His wealth and his passion for
privacy. Actually, Johnny kids himself. He'll say, `Somebody came
to see me, but they got wet when they fell into the moat.'''
   Their association has lasted longer than any of Carson's
marriages.
   ``We've never had a disagreement, never had a problem,'' said
McMahon. ``I think we have a mutual respect for each other. I
respect his being the boss. I respect his privacy. We like each
other.''
   It was Dick Clark who brought them together, and many years
later, McMahon and Clark teamed up for NBC's ``Bloopers and
Practical Jokes,'' which they still do occasionally as a special.
   ``Dick was my next-door neighbor in Philadelphia,'' McMahon
recalled. ``One day Edward R. Murrow interviewed Dick on the CBS
show `Person to Person.' He had a party, and I entertained. Dick's
producer told me I was pretty good. The producer's office was in
New York in the next office to Johnny's at the Little Theater. When
he heard they were looking for an announcer he suggested me.''
   McMahon took the train to New York and met with Carson. ``He
asked me a few questions and we stood by the window and watched
them put up a sign at the Shubert Theater across the street,'' he
said. ``It was for Judy Holliday in `Bells are Ringing.'
   ``Johnny said thank you, and I left figuring I didn't get the
job. Two weeks later the producer called me and said, `Look, when
you start Monday, wear a suit. Johnny likes to wear sports
clothes.' I said I didn't know what he was talking about. He said,
`Didn't anybody tell you? You got the job.'''
   Prior to becoming Carson's inseparable sidekick, McMahon worked
as an announcer in Philadelphia. He had been host of ``Bride and
Groom'' for six weeks and done a few commercials. Since then, of
course, he has become one of the most active personalities in
commercials. He is also the host of the syndicated talent show
``Star Search.''
   One of his commercial accounts is American Family Publishers,
which mails millions of sweepstakes entries every year. Hallmark is
bringing out a new card which says, ``Why don't I hear from you
anymore?'' Open the card and it says, ``Ed McMahon has time to
write to me.''
   His daughter, Katherine Mary, got a sweepstakes entry when she
was 6 months old.
   McMahon and his wife, Victoria, adopted Katherine Mary nearly
three years ago. He has four grown children.
   In World War II he was a Marine fighter pilot, teaching carrier
landings at Green Cove Springs, Fla. He got his orders to join an
all-Marine group on an aircraft carrier on the day Japan
surrendered.
   He was called back into the Marines in the Korean War and flew
an L19 as an artillery spotter. He recently retired from the Marine
Corps Reserve as a colonel.
   Despite his Irish ancestry, McMahon claims descent from a former
premier of France. He says an ancestor was a general in Napoleon's
army and briefly premier in the days when the Irish frequently
joined the French to fight the English. He has a picture of himself
and his wife standing by the street sign for McMahon Boulevard, one
of the streets radiating from the Arch of Triumph in Paris.

<HEAD>Game Show Host Bill Cullen Dies At 70</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bill Cullen, a television personality and
game show host whose career spanned such hits as ``I've Got a
Secret,'' ``The Price is Right'' and ``The $25,000 Pyramid,'' has
died of lung cancer at age 70.
   Cullen, who died Saturday at his home in Bel Air, appeared on
radio and television game shows from 1944 to 1988,
   With his crew cut and heavy-frame glasses, he became a familiar
face as a panelist on CBS's ``I've Got A Secret'' from 1952 to
1967. He also was host of the original ``Price is Right'' from 1957
to 1964 on NBC and later on ABC.
   ``Bill was the ultimate host,'' said colleague Dick Clark. ``He
had great humor, intelligence and humanity. Most of all he had the
great talent of making his job look easy.''
   ``He was the best,'' said Clark, who was master of ceremonies
for ``The $10,000 Pyramid,'' while Cullen was host of the nighttime
version, ``The $25,000 Pyramid.''
   ``He certainly created the yardstick of professionalism by which
all other MCs could follow,'' said Cullen's manager, George Spota.
   Cullen's game show resume also includes ``Three on a Match,''
``Pass the Buck,'' ``To Tell the Truth'' and ``The Joker's Wild.''
   He made the cover of the national edition of TV Guide seven
times between 1954 and 1984, including twice in one month in 1964.
   Cullen was working in a garage in Pittsburgh in 1939 when he got
his first job in broadcasting as an unpaid assistant disc jockey.
He later became a regular announcer earning $25 a week.
   In 1943, Cullen moved to New York and became a staff announcer
with the CBS Radio Network. A year later, he became announcer for
the ``Winner Take All'' game show.
   Cullen's first television game show was ``Give and Take,'' a
1952 question-and-answer show on which he was co-host with John
Reed King.
   ``He's spent more time on broadcast air, radio and television,
than anyone else in the business,'' said Spota.
   Bob Stewart, who produced ``The Price Is Right'' for eight
years, said Cullen was in a class by himself.
   ``Professionally, nobody I ever worked with was his peer,'' said
Stewart, a friend for 35 years. ``There was nobody like him nor
will there every be. Off camera, he was the same kind of lovable,
fun, mischievous guy you saw on television.''
   ``I hope never to be a big, really big, star,'' Cullen told The
New York Times in 1958. ``I may never be one in any case. But I've
seen too many big names burn themselves out on television.''
   Cullen is survived by his wife, Ann.

TELEVISION: WITH A HUGE POTENTIAL PAYOFF AT STAKE, PRODUCERS OF PROGRAMS FOR
SYNDICATION HOPE TO SPELL TROUBLE FOR 'WHEEL OF FORTUNE.'
</P>

By JEFF KAYE, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A videotape is popped into a machine and Merv Griffin appears, eager to tell
everyone about "the biggest project I've ever worked on." Best known today for
his involvement with hotels and TV programs, Griffin is now out pushing an
enterprise that combines elements of both: "Monopoly," a syndicated game show.
</P>
<P>
After Griffin's brief spiel on the tape -- "Peter Tomarken is a wonnnnderful
host" -- the pilot for the program runs. Salespeople representing Griffin and
King World, which will distribute the show, are blanketing the country, playing
the cassette for TV station executives who might buy "Monopoly."
</P>
<P>
Griffin and King World already produce and distribute the nation's top two
syndicated shows, "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" If they can sell their
video version of the classic board game to enough stations to make it worth
producing, they stand to make millions.
</P>
<P>
But it won't be easy. The offices of TV station executives are thick with
salespeople these days. This is selling season for the syndicated television
industry, a period that will culminate with frenzied deal-making this month at
the National Assn. of Television Program Executives convention in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of syndicated offerings are vying for attention in categories ranging
from talk shows ("Voices of America With Jesse Jackson"), to series ("The New
Dragnet") to network reruns ("Head of the Class") to the offbeat ("TV
Personals"). Nowhere does the competition appear steeper than in game shows,
however. The bright lights, bells, buzzers and toothsome hosts belie the
cutthroat nature of the business.
</P>
<P>
Fighting for syndicated slots this round -- the programmers' convention will be
the Bonus Round -- are "Monopoly"; "Trump Card" from Warner Bros.; "The
Challengers" from Dick Clark Productions and Buena Vista Television; "Quiz Kids
Challenge" from Guber-Peters; and remakes of "Tic Tac Dough" from ITC, "The
Joker's Wild" from Orbis Communications and "Name That Tune" from Orion.
</P>
<P>
Out of those game shows, which are considered to be the major contenders for
success, and the countless lesser hopefuls, only two, maybe three will make it
into production, say industry experts.
</P>
<P>
The problem is that there are few time slots available for new syndicated
shows. Besides "Wheel" and "Jeopardy!," which each appear on more than 200
stations across the country, valuable time slots already are taken by other
types of syndicated programs. "Oprah Winfrey," "Entertainment Tonight" and "A
Current Affair" are still going strong.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the potential payoff is great enough that for many production
companies it is worth the expense of taping a pilot and unleashing a sales
team. Most game-show producers sell their programs through "cash plus barter."
That means they not only get paid by the stations buying the show, but they
keep the rights to some of the available commercial time, which they sell
themselves. If they syndicate their program to enough stations -- 70% of the
country is generally considered the minimum -- the producers can sell lucrative
national advertising spots.
</P>
<P>
Game-show sales may also get a boost this year from an advertiser backlash
against trashy programs. "There's advertiser resistance to titillating talk
shows and magazine shows of a tabloid nature," says Jon Gluck, vice president
of programming for MMT Sales Inc., which advises stations. National advertisers
are growing concerned about advertising on "the 'Geraldos,' the 'Hard Copies,'
the 'Current Affairs' and even the 'Oprahs' and 'Donahues,' " he said. Games
shows, says Gluck, offer "a very healthy advertising environment."
</P>
<P>
In addition to the lure of cash and lovely prizes that await successful
game-show producers, this year's contestants smell an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
"There's a feeling that the time is right to challenge 'Wheel,' " says Gluck.
Although it remains a strong No. 1, Vanna White's show is slipping in the
ratings and competitors are anxiously awaiting the day the wheel stops
spinning.
</P>
<P>
While each game-show producer is trying to carve a separate niche, all keep an
eye on the basic elements that have made "Wheel" an institution. More than
anything else, game shows have to get viewers involved. Part of the genius of
"Wheel," say observers, is that it's designed to make the folks at home feel
smarter than the contestants. Even when an answer becomes obvious, the show's
contestants often must wait to guess. By that time, viewers are ready to burst,
wishing they could tell Vanna the answer.
</P>
<P>
"You've got to have a game show people can play along with," says Rick Feldman,
general manager of Los Angeles station KCOP Channel 13.
</P>
<P>
Feldman already has purchased "Tic Tac Dough" and "Joker's Wild" for next year,
believing that the remakes already have "recognizability."
</P>
<P>
A look at some of the games shows considered to have the best chance of making
it:
</P>
<P>
* "Monopoly" -- Griffin and the King Brothers have managed to boil down the
board game so it takes less than a half hour to play. But Monopoly purist may
squirm at the way this is accomplished. Contestants gain properties by guessing
easy questions (Q: Wabbit hunter. A: Elmer Fudd.). The players buy houses and
hotels off-camera during the commercial breaks and a midget in a tux runs
around a giant board to mark where each player has landed. The host, the midget
and winner dance around the board at the end of the game.
</P>
<P>
Michael King of King World says that his Monopoly rules are a little different
than the standard rules, but he argues that "nobody really plays Monopoly by
the same set of rules."
</P>
<P>
"Merv may not know what casinos to buy, but he knows what game shows to buy,"
says Bill Carroll, director of programming for Katz American Television, a
consulting firm. "Merv was able to take hangman and make 'Wheel of Fortune.' I
can't discount his ability to take a board game and make it a video game."
Nonetheless, he says it's too early to tell whether the show will make it.
</P>
<P>
* "Challengers" -- With Dick Clark as host, this game asks contestants tough,
often topical and newsy questions. The producers plan to tape the show
year-round so they can keep the questions current. The show is designed to air
just before or after evening newscasts, a lucrative location for syndicated
fare. "We thought the audience interest in question-and-answer shows was being
underserved," says Jamie Bennett, senior vice president at Buena Vista
Television, which will distribute the program. " 'Wheel of Fortune' is a
wonderful show, but you don't watch 'Wheel of Fortune' to get information.
There is a viewer benefit when you get information."
</P>
<P>
" 'Challengers' is the obvious front-runner," says Carroll of the Katz
consulting firm. "They've got the Big Mo. They were first in the marketplace,
they have a good pilot, a credible host, an aggressive syndicator. Put that all
together you've got deals."
</P>
<P>
Feldman, on the other hand, complains that "Challengers" is "derivative -- too
much like 'Jeopardy!' for its own good."
</P>
<P>
Sample pilot question: Name the two sons in "Death of a Salesman."
</P>
<P>
* "Trump Card" -- Donald Trump has lent his name to the show, but not his body.
The show is like bingo with the winner spelling out T-R-U-M-P.
</P>
<P>
"Right now they have a name, they don't have a game," scoffs Carroll. "If I
want to play bingo, I go to the parish hall."
</P>
<P>
* "Name That Tune" -- Entertainer Peter Allen is set to host this remake. "They
have a good pilot," says Feldman. "It's really more miscellaneous trivia than a
quiz show."
</P>
<P>
"It's played more for entertainment value than anything else," says Carroll. He
found host Allen a little too much "like a hyperactive kid," but declared that
"fixable."
</P>
<P>
* "Quiz Kids Challenge" -- The first game show from movie moguls Jon Peters and
Peter Guber will pit kids against adults in a battle of the brains.

<LEADPARA>  Dick Clark shows us the famous hands he had just pressed into wet concrete
this week at the Rock Walk, a sidewalk gallery on Sunset Boulevard down there
in Smogville. This concrete honor is afforded only to those who have made
significant contributions to rock music. One proof of Clark's significance is
standing behind him in this shot. It's Fabian, one of Clark's discoveries.  </LEADPARA>

<HL> Who's News:
Film Producer Is Scouting Heavy Industry

   In two years as chief executive of a cement company, Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman has directed a baffling series of investments.

   The cement company, Giant Group Ltd., bought control of Barris Industries Inc. -- famed for its "Gong Show" and "Dating Game" television shows -- and made overtures to take over companies with products ranging from vacuum cleaner bags to aerospace metals.
This month, when Giant and Barris bought a stake in a company called Clark Equipment, one Barris game-show writer thought he finally had figured out the logic of at least one deal.

   "He told us he was excited about our investment in Dick Clark's company," says a bemused Mr. Sugarman, adding that Clark Equipment Co., a South Bend, Ind.-based producer of forklift trucks, isn't related to the Clark who produces "American Bandstand."

   Being bewildered by Mr. Sugarman's ventures is understandable.
The 48-year-old producer was responsible for the 1986 Oscar nominee "Children of a Lesser God," along with "Extremities," "Crimes of the Heart," and other films.
Yet he now spends most of his time building Giant into a conglomerate.
Beyond its interest in Clark, the company's latest acquisition is a half-interest in closely held Rally's Inc., a tiny hamburger chain that Mr. Sugarman believes could one day rival McDonald's.

   "Simple threads" run through Giant's acquisitions, the nattily dressed executive explains in his plush office across the street from the Beverly Wilshire Hotel: All the companies are low-cost producers in basic, if out-of-favor, industries that in some way rely on a mass market, he says.
Mr. Sugarman expects sharp population growth to favor such industries in the 1990s.

   A Beverly Hills native who started his business career selling exotic used cars when he was in his early 20s, Mr. Sugarman showed an entrepreneurial spark when he went to Italy to buy a Ghia automobile and came back with exclusive dealership rights.
Show-business friends, many of whom he met when they bought cars from him, helped Mr. Sugarman break into television production.
By 1972, when his "Midnight Special" television rock concerts started a popular 10-year run, he already had a number of music specials to his credit and was an active investor.

   But why cement?

   "Tastes change," is his cryptic explanation for paying $4 million in 1982 for the controlling interest in struggling Giant, with operations in Harleyville, S.C.
He turned the company around, cutting its cement-making fuel costs sharply by incinerating other companies' hazardous wastes along with conventional fuels.

   After an unsolicited offer from game-show giant Chuck Barris to sell a controlling stake in the Barris production company, Mr. Sugarman decided last year to get back into television production and make use of Barris's cash.
Giant and Barris own Clark Equipment stakes that total 6.3% of the company's shares.

   Mr. Sugarman's forays have brought occasional charges that he is a corporate raider.

   "My feeling is that all he was after was . . . trying to put a company in play," says Leopold Wyler, former chairman of TRE Corp., which Mr. Sugarman tried to acquire last year.
TRE, a maker of specialty metals for the aerospace industry, escaped a proxy contest by Giant only by selling itself to Aluminum Co. of America.
Alcoa eventually bought Giant's 17% stake in TRE at the same price the aluminum concern paid other shareholders -- but that still resulted in a $13.3 million gain for Giant.

   As previously reported, the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the roles of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Jefferies &amp; Co. in Giant's bid to win control of TRE.
As part of the investigation, the SEC is studying whether a Giant unit and other entities with TRE holdings failed to disclose that they were acting in concert.

   Mr. Sugarman says he believes the SEC inquiry "is going nowhere," and adds that the agency hasn't communicated with the company since it sought information and documents in December.
Drexel "has done a terrific job for us" raising money, but wasn't involved in Giant's TRE bid, Mr. Sugarman adds.
Adopting a combative tone, the executive says he launched a proxy fight at TRE only after the company adopted anti-takeover measures indicating "that the company had a lot to protect."

   While Mr. Sugarman's critics say that a Hollywood producer is out of his element in heavy industry, securities analyst Craig Schwerdt of Morgan, Olmstead, Kennedy &amp; Gardner Inc., Los Angeles, says he thinks show business may be the perfect training ground for a corporate entrepreneur.

   "You have to have a good eye as a Hollywood producer," the analyst says.
"You're out there buying properties, and putting yourself at risk."

   Mr. Sugarman says that Clark Equipment is currently considered an investment, although "all the alternatives are there."
The company, which vows to fight any takeover attempt, meets Mr. Sugarman's acquisition tests.
Mr. Schwerdt of Morgan Olmstead notes that Clark "has been getting itself lean and mean," and could be even more attractive a producer as the dollar's fall gives it an edge over foreign construction-equipment makers.

   Despite his tentative moves into the rust bucket, Mr. Sugarman remains image-conscious, as befits his Hollywood roots.
He is disturbed by suggestions that he is debasing himself by running Barris's low-brow game-show shop.
As a producer often associated with quality motion pictures, he says with tongue in cheek that even Barris's silliest shows have "very good lighting, wonderful sound."

   "Schlock?
I don't disagree," he adds.
But change is coming.
Even though a new "Gong Show" is in the offing, he says, "it will look different.
It will be a "Gong Show" of the '90s."

   Gentle country crooner Randy Travis and
stylish crossover singer George Michael dominated the American Music
Awards, where heavy metal rowdiness and rap jive earned only limited
acceptance.
   The Shrine Auditorium nationally televised ceremonies Monday
night ushered in first-time categories for heavy metal and rap,
which enjoy widespread youth culture popularity.
   Michael and Travis each won three trophies and diversity reigned
in the winners list with artists like Whitney Houston, Def Leppard,
D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince, Gladys Knight and Guns N' Roses.
   Def Leppard, who didn't attend the ceremony despite three
nominations, won two trophies for heavy metal music but lost with
Van Halen to Gloria Estefan &amp; Miami Sound Machine in the pop-rock
group category. Guns N' Roses lost to Def Leppard twice in heavy
metal but won for pop-rock single.
   The lethargic performance by the tattooed, long-haired ruffians
Guns N' Roses, who were joined by ex-Eagle Don Henley, contrasted
sharply with the show's other flashy, professional numbers.
   Their bad-boy persona also didn't endear them to show producer
Dick Clark, who was forced to move Rod Stewart's performance ahead
of schedule because Guns N' Roses showed up late.
   Travis was named favorite male country vocalist and won the album
trophy for ``Always &amp; Forever'' and the single award for ``I Told
You So.'' He won in three categories last year for the same album.
   Asked about milking awards twice from the same album, he said
backstage, ``I'm not sure how that happened but I'm glad it did.''
   Unlike Grammy Awards decided by artists and industry insiders,
20,000 ordinary music lovers are the arbiters for American Music
Awards. Because ``Always &amp; Forever'' spanned two calendar years, it
was eligible twice.
   It happened before. Glen Campbell's ``Rhinestone Cowboy'' won in
1976-77, Kenny Rogers' ``The Gambler'' in 1980-81 and the
Rogers-Dolly Parton duet ``Islands in the Stream'' got a two-year
ride in 1984-85.
   Michael, formerly of the group Wham!, was favorite male vocalist
in the pop-rock and the soul-rhythm-and-blues categories. His album
``Faith'' claimed the soul-R&amp;B album award.
   ``A couple of years back when I split the group with Andrew
(Ridgely), I knew I had a tough job ahead of me and I thought that
maybe people weren't going to give me much of a chance,'' Michael
told the audience.
   Miss Houston won the female pop-rock and rhythm-and-blues
vocalist categories, her 10th and 11th American Music Awards, and
Miss Estefan &amp; Miami Sound Machine's Latin beat got them the
pop-rock group award.
   ``I never expected to win this,'' said Miss Estefan. ``It's
wonderful to be able to cross over to a whole new market and to have
everyone from all walks of life like our music.''
   Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips, who dominated the awards in 1976 with
four trophies, beat out hot new acts New Edition and Salt-N-Pepa for
R&amp;B group honors. Alabama won its seventh consecutive country group
trophy.
   Def Leppard swept the heavy metal category as favorite artist and
for the album ``Hysteria.'' The new rap category went to favorite
artist Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince and his album ``He's The D.J.,
I'm The Rapper.''
   Tracy Chapman, who led Grammy nominations earlier this month with
six, was the favorite new pop-rock artist but did not appear to
claim the trophy.
   The ``Dirty Dancing'' movie soundtrack won favorite pop-rock
album.
   Highlighting the three-hour ABC-TV presentation were tributes to
Michael Jackson and Willie Nelson, who were given non-competitive
trophies for personal achievement. A brief segment also honored
three artists who died last year _ Roy Orbison, Brook Benton and
Andy Gibb.
   ``I would first like to thank God, who makes all things
possible,'' said Jackson.
   Guns N' Roses won best pop-rock single for ``Sweet Child O'
Mine'' and Freddie Jackson's ``Nice 'N' Slow'' took the R&amp;B single
award. The favorite new R&amp;B artist was Al B. Sure!, a Boston native.
   Reba McEntire won favorite female country singer, and Patty
Loveless was favorite new country artist.
   Names of nominees were compiled from year-end sales charts of the
music industry trade publication Cash Box.
   Winners were selected by a polling of 20,000 people who receive
ballots sent by Herbert Altman Communications Research Inc. The
ballots are counted by the Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co.
accounting firm.
   The Grammy Awards will be handed out Feb. 22.
