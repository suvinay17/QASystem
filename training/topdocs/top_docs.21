It's easy for anyone looking for some depth in pop music to dismiss Billy Joel. 
"Storm Front" won't change that, but there is something fascinating about how 
Joel strives for respectability. As imitative, calculatingly commercial and 
occasionally foolish as this music is, a brash individuality comes through. 
</P>
<P>
Joel is canny enough to come up with a concept like "We Didn't Start the Fire" 
(a rapid-fire "This Is Your Life" montage for the Baby-Boom generation), 
pretentious enough to try to invest it with significance and shallow enough to 
have it turn out an exercise in banality. It's a failure (especially 
considering what R.E.M. made of a similar idea on "It's the End of the World as 
We Know It"), but at least it's a failure that is uniquely Joelesque. 
</P>
<P>
The strengths of "Storm Front" are also typical of Joel: Everything is 
marvelously tuneful and much of it rocks nicely. Highlights include a lively 
Memphis soul excursion ("When in Rome"), a nifty pop-rocker that sounds a lot 
like Todd Rundgren ("State of Grace"), and a well-crafted echo of Eric 
Clapton's "Bell Bottom Blues" ("Shameless"). And then there is "And So It 
Goes," a simple piano hymn of such loveliness and naked vulnerability that one 
wonders why Joel ever bothers with all the bluster and pretense in the first 
place. MIKE BOEHM

   Rock star Billy Joel says he no longer cares for
his early 1970s cult hit ``Captain Jack'' or his popular song ``My
Life,'' which he describes as childishly redundant.
   ``My Life'' is ``a song that turned out sour for me ... just
like some of your kids turn into bums,'' he told a master class at
the Performing Arts Center of Long Island University's Southampton
campus on Monday.
   ``Captain Jack,'' a song about adolescent drug abuse, ``kind of
burned me out quick,'' he added.
   The master class was open to the public and included Art
Garfunkel. Joel made it clear his professional career, not his
private life, was the topic of the day.
   ``Usually, somebody wants to know, `What does Christie look like
in the morning?''' he said, referring to his wife, model Christie
Brinkley. ``She looks good, so let's get that out of the way.''
   Joel said he writes his music first, composing the melody to
what he called ``bail-out lyrics'' that establish a song's phrasing.
   As he was working on the first verse of ``Just the Way You
Are,'' he said, the lyrics went:
   ``Don't be crazy, don't be lazy
   Don't bring me chicken soup alone.
   I'm not hungry, I'm not thirsty...''
   Later, when he wrote the real words, Joel said, he thought the
phrase ``What will it take 'til you believe in me _ The way that I
believe in you'' was essential to its success.
   ``That edge of anxiety made it a more meaningful song,'' he said.
   Joel, who signed a contract as a young musician that gave away
his rights to his early songs, said his advice to newcomers to the
field was ``to get a lawyer.''
   ``Then I'd tell them to hire another lawyer to watch the first
lawyer.
   ``There's a great deal of dishonesty and greed, and musicians
tend to be naive about this business,'' he said.

Billy Joel once regretted becoming a singer and songwriter, he said, but his 
doubt "lasted about five seconds." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a weird gig, there are no two ways about it," the pop star told about 800 
students in a master's class at Philadelphia's The University of the Arts on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask yourself a lot of times if you should be doing something else, 
maybe you should." 
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old singer, in town for a concert series, made a guest appearance 
at the university to talk about songwriting. 
</P>
<P>
Joel told the students they should ignore those who ask, "When are you going to 
get a real job?" "Most artists have had to overlook a lot of that kind of 
pressure," he said. "You do what you want to do." 
</P>
<P>
Of his precedent-setting 1987 tour of the Soviet Union, Joel said he noticed 
that Russian kids have an affinity for heavy metal. "All of our (pop) music 
comes from the black experience. . . . their music is from suffering. Heavy 
metal is the music of frustration. That's a frustrating life over there." 
</P>
<P>
Joel said the Soviet tour was "my greatest thrill as a performer" but he 
probably won't be going back because foreign performers are paid in rubles, 
which can not be taken out of the country and "you can't buy anything with them 
in the country."

Joel is at his worst when he's on a social-consciousness kick. 
</P>
<P>
On four of the five videos in this 25-minute collection, including "Leningrad," 
"We Didn't Start the Fire" and two versions of "The Downeaster," he's raising 
our consciousness about something or other. Joel comes across as very 
in-sincere -- just another millionaire rock star on a crusade. Like these songs 
-- from his recent hit album "Storm Front" -- the videos are saturated with 
sentimentality and melodramatic excesses. Only the joyous "I Go to Extremes" 
isn't tainted by a social message. Joel's music and videos are more likeable 
when he's just having fun, crooning about nothing deeper than the trials of 
romance and everyday life. DENNIS HUNT

FT  22 JUL 94 / Arts: Clash of the piano greats - The start of a concert
tour that brings together two of rock's giants, Elton John and Billy Joel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK LIPSIUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Billed as the battle of the great piano rockers, the 24-date Billy Joel  -
Elton John US stadium tour brings together two confident superstars ambling
through 20 years of their repertoire.
The four-storey high set depicting the American War of Independence with
Redcoats and tricorned Americans conveys less of the regal atmosphere than
the shield atop the proscenium with the legend 'Heart and Soul' flanked by
the British lion and American eagle.
The paired grand pianos on-stage at Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium, where
the tour started with three shows, were closer together than the two
performers, despite a warm embrace at the start.
Elton John acted the shy guest, putting lusty lungs behind the songs with
little audience eye contact. He had been invited to join the show by Joel,
ostensibly after a decade-long courtship, but the dual billing was timed to
coincide with a crowded summer of superstar stadium tours by Pink Floyd,
Barbra Streisand and the Eagles, as well as the packaged events Woodstock
'94 and Lollapalooza (in its fourth year as a Woodstock for alternative rock
acts).
John started with his first hit, 'Your Song', followed by Joel singing
'Honesty'. John did Joel's 'New York State of Mind' saying that they had
agreed to sing one of each other's songs. This made Joel sound insincere in
his effusive intro to John's 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road'.
When they took their turns separately, they sang truncated but generous sets
of their greatest hits. Returning together for the finale, they moved beyond
the predictable with an oldies medley and a duet of the Beatles' 'Hard Day's
Night'.
John used to make his body reverberate with the intensity of his fingers
pounding the keyboard. In this concert the piano still pounded out jangling
harmonies, but his expression was placid. His range of emotion was embodied
in a modest costume change from a loose grey suit to a white linen jacket
and finally a blue satin jacket. Even his spectacles were modest
yellow-tinted half-frames. It was positively demure by Elton's standards.
John got the audience to their feet with 'Philadelphia Freedom', but the
20-to-50-year-old crowd sat for the rest of the hour-long set, which
included his current number-one hit from The Lion King, 'Can You Feel the
Love Tonight', performed like a music video to the film's animated sequence.
The camera caught him at his most animated during 'Baby, You're the One'
gesticulating to his crew to turn his monitor down.
Joel was far more the showman. He soon removed his loose-fitting grey suit
jacket and rolled up the sleeves of his black T-shirt, swinging the
microphone stand as he strutted across the stage.
His good spirits seemed only spurred on by a sudden crisis when his drummer,
who had been food poisoned, left the stage. Joel quickly filled in with
John's drummer, whom he instructed before each song - back to the audience,
arms flailing.
Joel reached deep into his repertoire for songs such as 'Billy the Kid', but
he kept the audience on their feet singing the words.
These were obviously Billy Joel fans, happy to get a look at Elton John and
have a 3 1/2 -hour performance from the two piano rocking greats, but they
were there for the one whose finale 'Piano Man' sent them out singing into
the sweltering summer night.

   The rock memorabilia display in New York's Hard
Rock Cafe recently acquired a small, rather beat-up electric piano
that bears the inscription ``Trashed in the U.S.S.R.''
   The piano belonged to Billy Joel, and his tantrum is one of the
highlights of the 90-minute documentary by Martin Bell, ``A Matter
of Trust: Billy Joel in the U.S.S.R,'' which can be seen Wednesday
on ABC.
   The film is, in fact, what prompted Joel's well-publicized
attack on the innocent instrument. He explained later he thought
the camera lights were intimidating the audience.
   In order to pay for the tour, Joel commissioned two movies, a
concert film for HBO, directed by Wayne Isham, and the documentary
by Bell, an Englishman whose documentary on runaways,
``Streetwise,'' was nominated for an Oscar in 1985.
   The hey-look-they're-just-like-us impact of Bell's film is
perhaps faded somewhat in the wash of publicity from the Moscow
summit. But it is still a lovely travelogue and an interesting
backstage portrait of a rock tour. There's also plenty of
behind-the-scenes footage of Joel, his wife, Christie Brinkley, and
their infant daughter, Alexa Ray, to satisfy the most avid fan.
   ``It's difficult making films about rock 'n' roll in general,''
Bell said in a telephone interview. ``Because of films like `Spinal
Tap,' that form is so well-parodied. But the thing that was
interesting to me was the Soviet Union and also Billy's music.''
   Surprisingly, he said, it was not that difficult to work in the
Soviet Union, except for the difficulty of changing travel plans,
since Aeroflot is demandingly prompt and always fully booked.
   ``The other problem is, it's difficult getting food after 10
o'clock at night. So you're limited to vodka and caviar and
sturgeon. How difficult can it be?
   ``The interesting thing to me,'' Bell said, ``was that it wasn't
at all what I expected it to be. I mean I really did go with an
idea of what the place would look like. I thought it would be dull
and gray and uninteresting. It wasn't. It was the opposite _
lively, full of color and the people incredibly warm.''
   One of the most profound moments in the film comes when Joel
visits the grave of Russian folk singer Vladimir Visotsky, who died
in 1980. People stand in line all day just to glimpse the grave.
``That's popular,'' Joel says admiringly. Later, he meets
Visotsky's mother, who is enormously impressed that an American
rock star would visit her son's grave.
   There is also some nice footage of Joel and his backup singers
trading riffs with a Georgian men's singing group.
   The piano-hurling came on the second night of the tour. During a
song, Joel shouts, ``Quit lighting the audience!'' When there is no
response from the lighting people, he throws the piano over, then
attacks a microphone stand, breaking it in two.
   ``Thank goodness he did it, because it's very dramatic in the
film,'' said Bell.
   At another concert, Joel confounds his Soviet fans by going out
into the audience and lying down on top of them. At first
perplexed, they eventually get into the spirit and pass him, hand
by hand, over the tops of their heads back to the stage. ``I can't
believe I did that!'' cries Joel.
   ``The thing I am pleased about most in the film is that in a
sense you're just seeing the people,'' said Bell. ``You're seeing
people respond directly to that music, and they look just like us.
I don't know why that should be such a surprise, but in a sense we
haven't seen the Soviets like that.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   ATTACK OF THE `MEMOIRS THING' _ Former CBS anchor Walter
Cronkite has a major task looming _ ``the memoirs thing,'' as he
calls it. He said he hopes to get to work this year or next. ``I'm
not really intending to do another expose on CBS,'' he said.
``That's not my intention.'' There's a flurry of such recently,
including ``Prime Times, Bad Times'' by former CBS News President
Ed Joyce and ``Who Killed CBS?'' by New York Times reporter Peter
Boyer. ``I thought Joyce's book was very, very interesting,'' said
Cronkite. ``A great deal of it I thought was pretty accurate, but
no question it was his own view of it and self-serving.'' ...
   FROM `ST. ELSEWHERE' TO ELSEWHERE _ Ed Begley Jr., who played
fawning Dr. Ehrlich on NBC's ``St. Elsewhere,'' has a new role as a
United Nations interpreter in a made-for-TV action comedy for CBS
that also stars Harry Anderson of NBC's ``Night Court,'' Linda Purl
and Wendy Crewson.

CONCERT: ONCE AGAIN BILLY JOEL, THE CONSUMMATE ENTERTAINER, GIVES HIS FANS A

Billy Joel did a shtick early in his show Saturday at the Los Angeles Sports 
Arena -- the first of five sold-out dates there -- in which he pushed his piano 
stool back with his foot as he played a little rock-a-boogie introduction to 
"Angry Young Man." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually the stool was just . . . far . . . enough . . . away that he 
couldn't quite reach it to pull it back. With a little stagy flair he stretched 
with his left hand to try to grab the stool, all the while not missing a note 
with his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there was no real point to this exercise, but it was a nice little 
bit of show. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a pretty good analogy to the nature of Billy Joel the artist. Often 
he has tried to give the impression that he's stretching, reaching, finding new 
vistas. Some examples -- highlights of a nearly 20-year recording career -- 
were presented throughout the two-hour-plus concert Saturday, notably the 
social observation of "Only the Good Die Young," "Allentown," "Out of Saigon" 
and the new, glasnost-inspired "Leningrad." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, though, it's just show. It doesn't add up to much, any more than 
the post-World War II names and places listed in the recent smasheroo "We 
Didn't Start the Fire" add up to anything besides a list. 
</P>
<P>
Ask yourself: Has ever there been a figure in popular music as successful for 
as long as Joel who has left so little impact on the music world? Can you name 
one significant artist whom Joel has influenced? Can you identify any special 
nature to Joel's artistic vision? 
</P>
<P>
But to some extent it's a moot point. "We Didn't Start the Fire" was a smash 
hit, and it brought the crowd (predominant age group: mid-to-late 30s; average 
status, from appearances: comfortable) to its feet. And there's the rub. 
</P>
<P>
It may have been just a show, but it was a really good show. Joel is a 
consummate entertainer, a naturally feisty presence and a born ham. And, most 
important, he knows his fans and plays to them with the best. He just never 
tests them or challenges them. Or stretches them. 
</P>
<P>
He just delivers, on an uncluttered, unobstructed stage, with nifty lighting 
and an accomplished (though musically anonymous, save for ace drummer Liberty 
DeVitto) seven-piece band. He plays most of his many hits, he mugs and clowns, 
he makes engaging hey-I'm-just-a-working-Joe patter. It's very easy to sit back 
and just enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
Too easy, and that's the problem, just like the facetious, let-'em-eat-cake 
joke that he closed the evening with: 
</P>
<P>
"If you abso-tively, posi-tootly have to go home," he told the crowd after 
cautioning against drinking and driving, "do what I do. . . . Go in a big 
limousine." 
</P>
<P>
Way too easy.

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS: TV: Billy Joel in the U.S.S.R. </HL>
<AUTHOR> Martha Bayles </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<TEXT>
   This Wednesday, ABC will present "A Matter of Trust: Billy Joel in the U.S.S.R." (9:30-11 p.m. EDT). 
Partway through this part-concert-film-part-travelogue, the talented Mr. Joel sits at a grand piano telling the studio audience of a popular Leningrad TV show the tale of how he decided to bring his band on a tour of the Soviet Union. 
He was inspired, he confesses, by the thought that his two-year-old daughter might someday ask him, "What did you do in the Cold War, Daddy?" 

   Like countless celebrities before them, Mr. Joel and his wife, supermodel Christie Brinkley, have traveled into darkest Russia and brought back the revelation that it is inhabited by Homo sapiens. 
In sequence after sequence, we are shown proof of this startling fact: Kindly old gentlemen stroke snowy mustaches, flaxen-haired cherubs lick ice-cream cones, plump housewives fondle plump rutabagas, and scraggly teen-agers blurt treasured bits of American slang. 

   All in uninterrupted sunshine. 
Granted, the temperature in Moscow does hit 95 every 109 years or so. 
But let's admit it, folks. 
The weather in Russia stinks. 
There is a perfectly valid reason why we have a "negative image" of the Russians as a grim-faced, bulky race huddled in long lines to buy shriveled rutabagas. 
In this respect, Mr. Joel joins the rest of the glasnost-drunk media in pushing the by-now cliched "positive image" of the Russians as a sweet-faced, graceful race skateboarding into a glorious future without state censorship, one-party rule, secret police, nuclear weapons, rutabaga shortages -- or winter. 

   Objectivity requires me to add that "A Matter of Trust" does reveal one rainy day. 
And honesty requires me to confess that I am a Billy Joel fan. 
I admire the depth of his musicianship, the wit of his lyrics, and the astuteness of his half-sincere, half-ironic public persona. 
Thus I am willing to look beyond this film's heavyhanded reminders that the Soviets are human like us, and see what it really has to offer: a fascinating account of a rather jaded performer rediscovering himself through the enthusiasm of a new and unjaded audience. 

   Elsewhere in the Leningrad TV clip, Mr. Joel offers a summary of his beginning as a rock musician. 
"I knew the Russian classics at 12," he says, noodling a few Rachmaninoffian chords on the grand piano. 
"But I always used to jazz them up," he adds, demonstrating. 
"Then my old man would come along, and -- pow!" 

   I don't know if Mr. Joel was particularly aware of it, but his story resonates with a long history of keen Russian appreciation for American popular music. 
The first Russian jazzmen got going in the mid-1920s, during Lenin's New Economic Policy. 
Then Stalin came along and -- pow! 
The music didn't swing again until the mid-1930s, when Stalin's cultural commissars tried to co-opt it for their own purposes. 
Then the purges came along and -- wham! 
Things were quiet until 1944, when Hitler, who loathed jazz even more than Stalin, invaded Russia, and Uncle Joe revived the dzhazes, or jazz bands, to help inspire the Red Army. 
Then came the Cold War. 
Be-bop made a stand in the late 1950s, and Benny Goodman toured in 1962. 
Then Khrushchev came along and -- oops! 
"When I hear jazz," the premier declared, "it's as if I had gas on the stomach." 

   According to "Red &amp; Hot," the excellent history of Soviet jazz by the respected Sovietologist and jazz musician S. Frederick Starr, the authorities have been equally dyspeptic toward rock 'n' roll, which since the 1960s has supplanted jazz as the sometimes suppressed, sometimes tolerated sound of Western decadence and/or freedom. 
Yet, as Mr. Starr writes, the Soviet government's attempts to stamp out rock music have been no more successful than its efforts to eradicate jazz. 

   Strong as the Soviet interest in rock is, it doesn't pay Mr. Joel's bills. 
Since his return he's been hustling to recoup the estimated $2.5 million it took to send his show on the road. 
First there was a cable-TV special and a live album. 
Now there's this ABC special. 
Mr. Joel has also taken pains to attract as much as possible of the free hype surrounding any mixture of Soviet glasnost with American stardust. 

   When asked in the film whether he would advise other rock musicians to tour the Soviet Union, Mr. Joel shrugs half-ironically: "Yeah, if they can swing it financially." 
Then he frowns half-sincerely: "Yeah, they should come, because they'll rediscover their own material over here. 
They'll have fantastic audiences that they'll never forget." 
This statement sounds like more hype. 
But in the next sequence, when Mr. Joel sings "A Matter of Trust," to a young, starry-eyed crowd, it's obvious they're enthralled by something larger than the thrill, all-too-familiar to us, of attending a live rock concert. 

   It is during the next number that Mr. Joel suddenly knocks over an electric piano and breaks a microphone stand in order to get the technical crew to quit shining spotlights on the audience. 
It seems calculated, especially when he shouts, "These people want to be in the dark! 
They're tired of being watched!" 
After all, it is not the KGB but Joel's own staff who is lighting the audience. 
Restore this much-publicized outburst to its proper context, however, and it seems less a stunt than a genuine, if clumsy, reaction to the unexpected rapture of that audience. 

   Toward the end of the film, Mr. Joel provides more grist for the publicists' mills. 
While singing his lyrical doo-wop number, "The Longest Time," he stops at the edge of the stage, where the ecstatic fans are straining to touch him and, turning his back, falls into their many-armed embrace. 

   It's an old T-group trick -- not to mention rock-concert ploy -- proving "trust" by letting other people catch you when you fall. But this time around the moment becomes extraordinarily moving. Part of it's the way the show has carefully built up to this. And then there are the lyrics of the song itself. Written about a budding romance, they apply rather well to the tentative emotions of glasnost:
   "Maybe this won't last very long
   But you feel so right
   I could be wrong
   Maybe I've been hoping too hard
   But I've gone this far
   And it's more than I hoped for. . . ."

'WHY IS IT THAT THE POP CRITICAL ESTABLISHMENT HAS TURNED INTO A STRONGHOLD FOR 
PRETENSE?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rock 'n' roll started out as a protest against pretense and stuffiness -- pure 
vitality and good fun, along with moments of emotional uplift and tenderness: 
Elvis, Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Roy Orbison, the Everly 
Brothers. The Beatles, with their good humor, tender ballads and rhythmic 
vitality, continued that tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Why is it that the pop critical establishment has turned into a stronghold for 
pretense -- both a humorless intellectual pretense (suicidally bleak lyrics are 
a requirement) and an insecure machismo pretense? 
</P>
<P>
Music must be loud and unmelodic. And to like rock with melodic structure, or 
rock full of vitality and fun or, God forbid, a ballad, is an unforgivable sign 
of weakness. 
</P>
<P>
Good rock these days is still a protest against pretense -- but now, 
paradoxically, a protest against the self-importance of rock critics; that is 
why Billy Joel's superb "Storm Front" was on Pop Eye's Jan. 14 list of the 
worst albums of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
FERDINAND GASTELUM

 The Pop Eye list was the result of a poll taken among 40 writers, critics,

ninth place.

POP MUSIC SPECIAL; 
</P>
<P>
THE RECORD INDUSTRY'S BIG PUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Boehm 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fall season is always the most active time for pop record releases, as the 
music industry gears up for its November-December season, during which nearly a 
third of all records, tapes and CDs are sold. But that can mean confusion for 
even the most serious music fans, as old favorites compete with newcomers for 
consumers' attention. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the albums expected to generate the most critical and commercial 
interest of all the post-Labor Day releases during the hectic year-end rush. 
The selections, presented in alphabetical order, cover all parts of the pop 
music spectrum, from heavy-metal fathers (Aerosmith) and sons (L.A. Guns) to 
rap innovators (the D.O.C., Young M.C.); from rock kings on the rebound (Bob 
Dylan, the Rolling Stones) and pop queens living the lush life (Linda Ronstadt, 
Barbra Streisand) to country chartbusters (Randy Travis) and folkie mavericks 
(Tracy Chapman, Michelle Shocked). 
</P>
<P>
 The comments are by the Times pop writers indicated, but the star ratings (one 
is poor, five a classic) sometimes reflect additional pop staff input. 
</P>
<P>
 The reviewers are Robert Hilburn, Dennis Hunt, Mike Boehm, Richard Cromelin, 
Jonathan Gold, Steve Hochman, Connie Johnson, Craig Lee, Kristine McKenna, 
Randy Lewis, Don Snowden, Chris Willman, Paul Grein, Duff Marlowe and Don 
Waller. 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 GRATEFUL DEAD, "Built To Last,"Arista. The best songs are the three 
valedictory numbers sung and co-written by Jerry Garcia. When it's Uncle 
Jerry's Band, the Dead is something to hear. But when he steps back and lets 
the other guys take over, "Built to Last" subsides into something less durable. 
(Boehm) 
</P>
<P>
*** BILLY JOEL, "Storm Front,"Columbia. He's obnoxious, derivative, almost 
always playing to the grandstand with oversized gestures. But that can be 
overlooked when the craftsmanship and tunefulness are as strong as they are 
here. A rock-oriented treat for Joel's fans, and maybe even a guilty pleasure 
for those who think of him as an obnoxious, derivative grandstander. (Boehm) 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 ELTON JOHN, "Sleeping With the Past,"MCA. The album is dedicated by John 
and Bernie Taupin to soul pioneers, but it's no juicy soul update. Instead, 
it's a savvy piece of smooth pop craft, with warm singing, consistently 
hummable melodies and as strong a sequence of tunes as John has put together 
since his mid-'70s days as a dominant force on the pop charts. (Boehm) 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 THOMPSON TWINS, "Big Trash,"Red Eye/Warner Bros. While nothing here is 
as good as the Twins' mid-'80s hits, "Big Trash" does serve as a credible 
comeback album. Tom Bailey and Alannah Currie don't have anything deep or 
original to say, and they are fairly shameless about stealing from such sources 
as the Doors and Talking Heads, but they offer more humor and vitality than 
most of the dance-rock competition. (Boehm)

<DATELINE> Singer Billy Joel sued his former manager  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   and ex-brother-in-law -- for $90 million for allegedly mismanaging the pop star's finances. 

   Frank Weber was fired as Mr. Joel's manager Aug. 30 after the entertainer's attorneys began reviewing various financial records. 
Leonard Marks, a lawyer for Mr. Joel, said the alleged improprieties date back to 1980, when Mr. Weber became the singer's exclusive manager. 

   "It's really quite a shocking story of trust," Mr. Marks said. 
The former manager "had a very close, personal relationship with Billy Joel. . . . 
Billy Joel had total faith that he was dealing with someone who was totally honest." 

   Mr. Weber became Mr. Joel's manager after the entertainer and his wife at that time, Elizabeth Weber, separated. 
Ms. Weber, Mr. Weber's sister, had been Mr. Joel's manager; Mr. Marks said Mr. Weber sided with Mr. Joel when the couple split up. 

   Among other things, the lawsuit claims that, against the singer's instructions, Mr. Weber allowed Mr. Joel's song copyrights to be pledged as collateral for loans. 
The suit, filed in state court in Manhattan, also accuses Mr. Weber of double-billing Mr. Joel for song videos made by a Weber-controlled company. 

   The suit says that because of the fees and commissions to Mr. Weber and his companies, the former manager made more money off some of the entertainer's tours and recordings than did Mr. Joel. 

   Mr. Weber's commission as manager was 20% of Mr. Joel's gross revenue. 
The commission amounted to about $12 million over the past three years, Mr. Marks said. 
In addition, the suit says Mr. Weber drew on the entertainer's assets for unauthorized, interest-free loans. 
The suit also claims that Mr. Joel sustained a loss of at least $10 million on risky investments in horse-breeding partnerships, oil and natural gas, and real estate transactions arranged by Mr. Weber. 
Often Mr. Weber had a personal stake in the investments, the lawsuit says, though Mr. Weber's conflict of interest was never disclosed to Mr. Joel. 
"We believe Mr. Weber took substantial fees and commissions every time Billy Joel invested in one of his deals or partnerships," Mr. Marks said. 

   Neither Mr. Weber nor his attorney could be reached for comment on the suit.

   JUDGE ORDERS LAWYERS to return $3.1 million in excess billings. 

   U.S. District Judge Joseph C. Howard in Baltimore ruled that Annapolis, Md., attorneys David A. Levin and James T. Wharton "were vicariously liable" for overbillings submitted by their former partner, Edward S. Digges, even though they didn't participate in the fraud. 

   Mr. Digges, former managing partner of Digges, Wharton &amp; Levin, represented a Baltimore unit of Dresser Industries Inc. in asbestos litigation from 1984 to 1988 and submitted $4.5 million in total billings. 
In his ruling last month, Judge Howard characterized Mr. Digges's billing practices as "grossly fraudulent and willful." 

   The judge found Messrs. 
Wharton and Levin liable along with Mr. Digges because the firm had no monitoring system in place to ensure the accuracy of Mr. Digges's bills or to prevent fraud. 
The judge ordered that $3.1 million be returned to the Dresser unit, Harbison Davidson Refractories Inc. 

   Lawyers for Messrs. 
Wharton and Levin declined comment. 
Mr. Digges couldn't be reached. 

   A jury trial is planned to determine what, if any, punitive damages to assess.

   A WEEK OF AMNESTY for pilferers of court files pays off in Austin, Texas. 

   The files weren't making it back to the county clerk's office after court proceedings, so Travis County Clerk Dana DeBeauvoir offered attorneys, law clerks and other courthouse personnel a chance to return the files last week with no questions asked. 

   The clerk's office handles records for 47,000 misdemeanor criminal cases and 41,000 civil cases on an "open-shelf" system that allows lawyers and others to fetch the files themselves. 
Trouble was, 10% of the files weren't being returned for days and sometimes weeks after a court proceeding. 

   "I don't have any files that are permanently missing," Ms. DeBeauvoir said. 
"I just have a revolving door that got stuck." 

   The clerk concedes she lacks enforcement power when a file is overdue but said the declaration of an amnesty week was a way of drawing attention to the problem. 
And although she doesn't have hard data, Ms. DeBeauvoir said the amnesty did inspire many attorneys to return the files. 
"I just wanted to raise their consciousness that it's not okay to borrow a file for a while," she said.

   PERIPATETIC PROSECUTORS: Celia Goldwag Barenholtz, the former chief appellate attorney in the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, has become a partner at Kronish, Lieb, Weiner &amp; Hellman, a 78-lawyer New York law firm. 
She will handle criminal and civil cases. . . . 
Morrison Cohen Singer &amp; Weinstein has recruited Laura A. Brevetti as a partner and co-head of the 50-lawyer New York law firm's white-collar crime group. 
She was formerly chief of the U.S. Department of Justice Organized Crime strike force in Brooklyn. 

   ---

   QUOTABLE: In an opinion largely backing insurers in a Superfund toxic-waste cleanup case, state court judge Robert H. Dierker Jr. of St. Louis took the opportunity to comment on "loss spreading," a theory holding that those who share the benefits of industrialization must all share in its costs. 
The judge said such notions "are merely 'critical legal studies' code words to disguise methods by which courts can be utilized as devices for imposing socialist or Marxist economics through perversion of the common law." 
Needless to say, the judge rejected this approach.

HIT-MAKER RICHARD MARX DOESN'T SPLIT HAIRS; 
</P>
<P>
POP MUSIC: THE SINGER WITH THE FAMED MANE SHRUGS OFF HIS CRITICS AND LOOKS FOR 
RESPECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Marx leaned his head over the West Hollywood restaurant table and poked 
his fingers into the top of his notoriously lush mane. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see right here, I have no hair spray," the pop singer said. "I don't 
ever use hair spray. I just have thick hair, which I think (upsets) a lot of 
bald critics." 
</P>
<P>
Hair and critics are two things that often come to mind concerning Richard Marx 
-- and he's proven touchy on both subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Last year on "Late Night With David Letterman," Marx repeated David Lee Roth's 
famous line that critics seem to like Elvis Costello because they all look like 
him. And more recently he got into a verbal tiff with MTV veejay Adam Curry 
over who was the biggest hairhead. (Marx called Curry a "mousse endorsement.") 
</P>
<P>
But all Marx wants, he said, is a little respect. 
</P>
<P>
Like Billy Joel, an acknowledged role model, Marx professes that he is knocked 
simply for having hits and that he has been given an inaccurate image as a 
middle-of-the-road popster rather than a rock-oriented performer. 
</P>
<P>
The son of a jingle composer father and studio singer mother, Marx -- who plays 
the Greek Theatre on Saturday and Sunday -- is proud to consider himself a 
craftsman and is mystified that the critics won't take him on those terms. 
</P>
<P>
"When I read bad reviews of me and when I read slams in the press, I don't ever 
read, 'He doesn't sing well' or, 'He doesn't write melodic songs,' or 'He 
doesn't work hard on stage or produce good records,' " he said. "I read, 'His 
hair's too perfect.' " 
</P>
<P>
After having spent his teen years singing on jingles his father had written, 
Marx came to Hollywood from Chicago at 18 in 1982 at the invitation of Lionel 
Richie, who had heard a tape of his songs. 
</P>
<P>
Marx spent several years learning the studio system, having songs recorded by 
James Ingram, Kenny Rogers and Kim Carnes, doing background singing and 
performing in local mainstream clubs like Sasch in North Hollywood. At 23 his 
debut album was released by EMI records, with the first single, "Don't Mean 
Nothing," making it to No. 3 on the Billboard pop chart. 
</P>
<P>
Now at 26, Marx has had nine hit singles, including the recent Top 10 song 
"Children of the Night," a topical ballad that is the fifth hit from his 
3-million-selling second album, "Repeat Offender." 
</P>
<P>
Marx, who returns to his hometown Tuesday to sing the national anthem at 
Wrigley Field for the All-Star baseball game, believes critics let the looks of 
artists interfere with their judgment of them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the critics necessarily hone in on the music and lyrics," he 
said, speaking genially, but making his point forcefully. "I think they look at 
the overall picture and if an artist doesn't fit the mold that they've placed 
for the artists they like, visually, then they like to beat them up." 
</P>
<P>
But Marx says that the negative reviews are easier to shrug off now than they 
were when they were new to him. His career and his personal life -- he and his 
wife, actress-singer Cynthia Rhodes, with whom he lives in the Hollywood Hills, 
are expecting their first child in September -- are satisfying enough that he 
can ignore the critics. 
</P>
<P>
"I do have a certain amount of satisfaction that somebody like Billy Joel has 
said he likes my music. And the truth is I have kind of griped and moaned that 
I get slammed so much in the press, but the truth is I knew before I even made 
a record that that would be the case, because I don't do the kind of music 
that's going to get me in good graces with the press, and that's OK." 
</P>
<P>
"Children of the Night" has also opened new creative avenues for him to 
explore. The song examines the plight of child prostitutes in Hollywood, with 
royalties from it earmarked for the assistance organization that gave the song 
its title. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a kid in Chicago I worried about whether I was going to pitch the 
next game, my term papers, whether a girl liked me," he said. "These kids, some 
of them 12- and 13-year-old girls, worry about, 'How do I get this guy out of 
my room now that I've had sex with him?' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Children of the Night' was a great exercise for me because I had to write 
about something that wasn't me. . . . After I wrote that song I started 
thinking not necessarily that I'm going to follow that road 100%, but if I can 
find other topics like that, it would inspire me to probably be better 
lyrically." 
</P>
<P>
And Marx even believes that someday that respect of peers and fans could rub 
off on the critics. Asked what a future rock history book might say about him, 
Marx answered confidently: 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to say, 'He took a lot of (flak) for along time, and now he's 
getting the respect he deserves.' That's what I hope."

to his lush hair than his craftsmanship, but he's not afraid to say things that 
may make them dislike him even more.

   Entertainers and fans worldwide mourned the
death of rock 'n' roll legend Roy Orbison, describing the singer,
guitarist and songwriter as a seminal artist and a gentle man.
   Entertainers as diverse as Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt, Billy
Joel, Emmylou Harris, Keith Richards and U2's Bono said Wednesday
that rock 'n' roll had lost one of its giants.
   The Grammy Award-winning Orbison, famed for such hits as ``Oh,
Pretty Woman,'' ``Only the Lonely'' and ``Crying,'' died of a heart
attack shortly before midnight Tuesday in a Nashville hospital. He
was 52.
   ``Sweet Roy. A gentleman and a gentle man. A good friend. His
death is a great loss to rock 'n' roll, but we still have his
music,'' said the Rolling Stones' Richards.
   ``He was and always will be one of the greats of rock 'n' roll,''
said former Beatle Paul McCartney. ``We toured with Roy in the early
days and he was a really good guy.''
   Instantly recognizable by his ever-present sunglasses and dark
attire, Orbison had 27 consecutive records on the charts during his
heyday in the early 1960s. Orbison's vocal range spanned three
octaves, and Elvis Presley once called him the greatest singer in
the world.
   ``He was as gentle, wise, and mysterious as his voice,'' said
U2's Bono, who recently recorded with Orbison in Memphis, Tenn.
   ``Starting over more than once, he was at the time of his death
the finest white pop singer on the planet. Writing a song for him
was like writing a song for Elvis Presley, the only other comparable
vocal talent,'' said Bono.
   Recently, Orbison became popular with still another generation of
fans as a member of The Traveling Wilburys _ along with ex-Beatle
George Harrison, Tom Petty, Bob Dylan and Jeff Lynne. The group's
album is No. 8 on the charts.
   Harrison and Petty said through publicists that they were too
stunned to comment immediately.
   Miss Harris, contacted on tour in Connecticut, described Orbison
as ``one of the greatest singers that ever lived. There will never
be another like him.'' In 1980 she collaborated with Orbison for
``That Loving You Feeling Again,'' which won a Grammy Award.
   Miss Ronstadt, who enjoyed great success with her rendition of
Orbison's ``Blue Bayou,'' said, ``I'm shattered. Roy was a
tremendous influence on the Los Angeles music community. I, the
Eagles, J.D. Souther were in awe of his artistry from our very
beginning.''
   ``He had the voice of an angel,'' said Billy Joel. ``His loss
with be felt by anyone who loves rock 'n' roll.''
   ``Roy Orbison was a great musician and a great friend to country
music. We have lost a giant,'' said Miss Parton.

We Didn't Start the Rumors: Billy Joel is trying to squelch stories that his 
marriage to Christie Brinkley is in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
The reports started when Brinkley was seen with race car driver Danny Sullivan, 
and escalated with a tabloid story about Joel and another woman. "Our marriage 
is very solid," the singer told People magazine. "It always has been. I guess 
when celebrity news is slow, the press starts cooking up the old Billy-Christie 
split story. The most aggravating thing about it is that there is a child 
involved here (Alexa Ray, 4, their daughter) who is still young enough to be 
troubled by these rumors. I say enough is enough. Leave us alone." GREG BRAXTON

Billy Joel says he can't wait to play Yankee Stadium -- he'll be playing music 
and a little baseball on the field where Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, 
Mickey Mantle and other greats once performed. 
</P>
<P>
Two popes and several heavyweight fights have sold out the stadium, but Yankees 
officials say the native New Yorker and five-time Grammy winner will be the 
first rocker to headline a show there when he appears June 22. 
</P>
<P>
Other bands have played there following Yankee games. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the House that Ruth Built, man. It's a magic place," Joel said in a 
telephone interview from Chicago. "The day we set up, I'm going to walk out to 
the mound and do a little pitching, maybe shag a few flies." 
</P>
<P>
His piano will be set up in left-center field.

   Now playing center field at Yankee Stadium ...
Billy Joel.
   The five-time Grammy winner, whose most recent album is the
former No. 1 ``Storm Front,'' will become the first rocker to
headline a show at the stadium, as far as New York Yankees
officials can determine. Two popes and several heavyweight fights
have sold out the stadium, but no musical acts.
   Joel will play a June 22 concert at the Bronx ballpark, the
playground of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio and Mickey
Mantle, to name a few. His piano will be set up in left-center
field.
   The show, for an expected 57,000 fans, will be a homecoming for
the native New Yorker.
   ``It's the House that Ruth Built, man. It's a magic place,''
Joel said in a telephone interview from Chicago. ``The day we set
up, I'm going to walk out to the mound and do a little pitching,
maybe shag a few flies.''
   The show will be part of Joel's second swing through the United
States on a tour that began last year. On May 5, he begins a
one-month European tour.
   Joel, who early in his career played under the nom-de-tune Billy
Martin, said there's a possibility of a second show at the stadium
if the first sells out.
   The show will be co-promoted by Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner, whose biggest concern was the Yankees infield.
   Joel, who first visited the stadium for a late '50s World Series
game, agreed. ``That's understandable. That grass is sacrosanct,''
he said.
   Joel's group will not be the first band to play at the stadium.
The Beach Boys and the Charlie Daniels Band have performed
following Yankee games in recent years.

The philosopher George Santayana once issued a warning to people in a position 
to shape history: Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe somebody should issue a new warning to pop songwriters who take on 
historical subjects: Those who cannot put the past into some sort of 
perspective are condemned to regurgitate annoying lists of facts. 
</P>
<P>
That's the problem with Billy Joel's recent No. 1, "We Didn't Start the Fire." 
Damning the torpedoes (of critics such as yours truly) and rushing full speed 
ahead, Joel packed 40 years' worth of rhyming names and events into his song, 
starting with Harry Truman and ending with "rock and roller cola wars." In his 
staccato rush, Joel couldn't pause for a line or two to explain what any of 
those names and events might have meant, or how they might have affected the 
people who lived through them. 
</P>
<P>
Still, at a time when educational horror stories abound about high school 
students who don't know Mussolini from minestrone, any focus on history is 
welcome -- and Joel's hit seems to be serving a need. Reacting to feedback from 
teachers who used the song in their classrooms, educational publisher 
Scholastic Inc. has sent schools across the country cassettes of the song, 
along with suggestions for incorporating it into their lessons. While verses 
such as "Pope Paul, Malcolm X, British politician sex/J.F.K. blown away, what 
else do I have to say?" strike me as unutterably banal, who's to argue if they 
wind up serving as starting points for compositions or class discussions that 
go into greater depth? 
</P>
<P>
However. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If a ridiculous song like "We Didn't Start The Fire" is doing some good in 
classrooms, what might be made of some of the first-rate historical rock songs 
that have come down over the years? 
</P>
<P>
Songwriters such as Ray Davies of the Kinks and Robbie Robertson of the Band 
have given us songs and albums that not only deal in facts but engage our 
emotions. Once students learn that history isn't the stuff of disconnected 
factoids, but of sadness, anger, pride and suspense, the door to learning can 
be flung wide open. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some songs that teachers, students, history buffs and plain old music 
fans might find worthwhile. (The list takes into account songs about pre-1960s 
history. For students of more recent events -- Vietnam, the U.S. civil rights 
crusade and racial unrest, South African apartheid -- rock and pop have offered 
a running commentary of songs too numerous to mention by such great writers as 
Bob Dylan, Stevie Wonder and Peter Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
(As for Billy Joel, songs like "Allentown," "Goodnight Saigon" and the recent 
"Leningrad" show that, when he pauses long enough to tell a story, he is 
capable of writing a decent song from historical material.) 
</P>
<P>
"Acadian Driftwood." This song from the Band's 1975 album, "Northern Lights -- 
Southern Cross," tells the story of the Acadians, the French-speaking 
inhabitants of Canada's maritime provinces. Uprooted from their homes in the 
mid-1700s when the British seized Canada from the French, the Acadians trekked 
south to the nearest French-controlled territory, Louisiana, where they became 
known as the Cajuns. That's the historical gist of it. But Robertson's story, 
sung from the viewpoint of a single Acadian refugee, goes beyond mere facts to 
explore what it's like to be one of history's victims. This eloquent, 
fiddle-accented song is full of sadness and longing for a lost homeland. 
Listening to "Acadian Driftwood" once more, I thought of how history does 
repeat itself: The Vietnamese war refugees who have settled in Orange County 
are the Acadian driftwood of today. 
</P>
<P>
"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down." Another one from the Band, this time 
about the fall of the Confederacy. The song captures the potent mixture of 
poverty, pride, anguish and bitterness among white Southerners that doomed the 
Reconstruction to failure. Again, the key to the song is Robertson's ability to 
center a historical tale on a character who, more than just narrating facts, 
brings home the emotional experience of living through great events. 
</P>
<P>
"Past, Present And Future." This 1974 album by British folk-rocker Al Stewart 
is full of first-rate songs drawn from 20th-Century history. Included is 
probably the only rock song that will ever be written about President Warren G. 
Harding (Stewart even tells you what the 'G' stands for), whose pathetic 
incompetence in office is evoked in a sprightly, mocking tune. "The Last Day of 
June, 1934" illustrates how blissfully unaware we usually are of the history 
going on around us, shaping our lives. Verses about carefree lovers enjoying 
themselves on a balmy June day in England and Germany are set against the story 
of Hitler, on that same day, consolidating his power with a bloody purge among 
his own Nazi followers, setting Europe -- and those happy, unknowning lovers -- 
on a course for disaster. In the album's epic masterpiece, "Roads To Moscow," 
Stewart -- like the Band -- tells of earthshaking events through individual 
eyes, giving an account of the crucial Eastern Front warfare during World War 
II from the viewpoint of a Soviet foot soldier. The song, like Soviet history, 
is tragic: Nazism is crushed, only to give renewed free reign to the terror and 
paranoia of Stalinism. 
</P>
<P>
"Arthur (or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)." With "Arthur," a 1969 
album often regarded as the first rock opera (it was originally the soundtrack 
for a BBC TV drama), the Kinks' Davies shows the sweep of British history from 
World War I to the socialist experiments of the 1950s and 1960s, and what it 
all means to one average English family. Like life itself, this great album is 
alternately funny and sorrowful. Just as the Band couldn't play a song during 
its heyday without reflecting deeply on the American soul, the Kinks' music in 
the middle to late '60s captured a specially British essence of character. Both 
bands realized that you couldn't delve into the nature of a nation's soul and 
character without closely considering its history. 
</P>
<P>
"Sympathy for the Devil." People who haven't really listened to this famous 
Rolling Stones song tend to assume that it is a worshipful ode to Satan. 
They're ignoring the bitterly ironic historic commentary embedded in the 
lyrics. Mick Jagger does play the role of Satan in "Sympathy for the Devil" -- 
a Satan who cackles and gloats over how readily mankind has done the devil's 
bidding throughout the 20th Century. This Satan points to the horrors of the 
Russian Revolution, the Second World War and the Kennedy assassinations, 
implying that only creatures in close sympathy with the devil could have 
written such a grievous history for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Butcher's Tale (Western Front 1914)." The Zombies, one of the most underrated 
bands of the British '60s rock invasion, ended their career in 1968 with a 
great album, "Odessey &amp; Oracle" (available on a Rhino Records re-release). 
Included is "Butcher's Tale." The song's angry, unflinching account of World 
War I trench warfare is given by a shellshocked British soldier infuriated by a 
preacher's militaristic fight-for-God-and-country sermon. The song's harrowing 
details, which presage the welcome war-really-is-bloody-hell realism of Oliver 
Stone's Vietnam War films, make it one of the definitive anti-war statements in 
rock history: 
</P>
<P>
"And I have seen a friend of mine hang on the wire like some rag toy 
</P>
<P>
 And in the heat the flies come down and cover up the boy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If the preacher he could see those flies, wouldn't preach for the sound of 
guns." 
</P>
<P>
 "Butcher's Tale" makes us see the flies. 
</P>
<P>
"Cortez the Killer." The tricky thing about history is that it's so easy to 
twist. In this song about the Spanish conquistadores' destruction of Aztec 
civilization, Neil Young does more than a little twisting to make the Aztecs 
look like innocent, spiritually lofty victims of greedy, morally bankrupt 
Europeans. "Hate was just a legend/War was never known," Young sings, extolling 
the Aztecs. In fact, they were ruthless conquerors themselves, who enslaved 
their neighbors and spilled vats of their war prisoners' blood in human 
sacrifice (Young's lyric tries to put a happier face on that little 
circumstance by implying that the sacrificial victims gave their lives 
voluntarily and altruistically for religious reasons). Cortez and his gang were 
greedy and morally bankrupt, of course, but Young draws the conflict in stark 
moral terms that defy historic fact. "Cortez the Killer," from the album 
"Zuma," is worth hearing because it is a terrific rocker, and also because 
Young's distortions illustrate how tempting -- and how wrong -- it can be to 
paint history in simple black and white.

   Oh, that Christie Brinkley. Cover
girl, married to Billy Joel, mother of a beautiful daughter _ and
now she's figured out a way to fight Lyme disease.
   Brinkley is raising guinea hens on her Long Island estate, and
she believes the fowl are eating the deer ticks on her land. The
ticks are carriers of potentially fatal Lyme disease, which has
struck Suffolk County harder than any other county in the state
this summer.
   When the actress-model told Rep. George Hochbrueckner about the
hens on patrol, the congressman quickly seized the (photo)
opportunity.
   Brinkley and Joel will soon be hosts to the congressman and a
team of researchers who want to determine if the deer tick
population is lower on the celebrity property than at the
neighbors' homes.
   The New York Democrat said the researchers also will take some
of the hens back to a laboratory to see if the animals can tell the
difference between dog ticks and deer ticks.
   Brinkley told Hochbrueckner she noticed the number of deer ticks
dropped after she let the hens wander around the property.
   Hochbrueckner said the guinea hens are used in Africa to keep
ticks out of barnyards.

   He designed a new automobile, they called the `K.'
   His new car and charming wit surely saved the day.''

   Singer Billy Joel won the first round of a $90
million lawsuit he filed against his former manager.
   State Judge Edward Lehner ordered the ex-manager, Frank Weber,
to pay the singer $2 million that Joel contended was stolen from
him. Lehner also said Joel was entitled to go to trial on another
set of claims against Weber.
   Joel contends that Weber took $30 million from him in
unauthorized management commissions, investments in companies Weber
controlled and other alleged embezzlements.
   Joel also is seeking $60 million in punitive damages from Weber,
according to Joel's lawyer, Leonard Marks.
   In the written opinion Thursday, Lehner dismissed Weber's claim
that he had an oral agreement to pay $2 million back to Joel.
   Marks said he contacted Joel in London and told the singer of
the judge's decision.
   ``Billy is absolutely delighted with this result and regards it
as a first-round knockout,'' he said.
   Marks said he expected the case to go to trial in six months to
a year.
   Weber's attorney, Anthony Conforti, could not be reached for
comment Friday because he was on vacation, according to a secretary
at his Long Island office.

   Donald Trump had his alleged mistress Marla
Maples move in next door to him at Trump Tower, much to the dismay
of his estranged wife, Ivana, a newspaper reported Friday.
   ``I am shocked and saddened that Donald could subject me and the
children to such shameful behavior,'' Mrs. Trump said, according to
gossip columnist Liz Smith's account in the Daily News.
   Ms. Maples moved into the building in December, Smith said, and
has evaded the past 5{ weeks of intensive media scrutiny by using a
side entrance and taking the service elevator directly to her
63rd-floor apartment.
   After Trump's separation from his wife became public in
February, Trump moved in across the hall from Ms. Maples, Smith
said.
   It was reported Thursday that Trump was ``dropping'' Ms. Maples.
But Smith called this a ruse designed to ``soften up'' Mrs. Trump
and prevent her from making legal moves that might embarrass the
billionaire tycoon before he goes before the New Jersey Casino
Control Commission on Thursday.
   Trump is seeking final license approval for the Taj Mahal, his
mega-casino slated to open April 5 in Atlantic City.
   Trump's spokesman has refused to comment on the alleged affair.
Ms. Maples' spokesman has said the aspiring actress' relationship
with Trump was never more than a friendship.

   Miss America Debbye Turner says she
entered beauty pageants repeatedly and refused to listen to critics
who told her a black woman would never win the national contest.
   She also said she was undeterred when the same critics scoffed
at her for being a devout Christian and a marimba player.
   Ms. Turner, who won the title last September in Atlantic City,
told high school students Thursday that her example should show
everybody that all dreams are attainable.
   She said she entered pageants repeatedly, and had two runner-up
finishes in Arkansas, before winning the Miss Missouri title and
qualifying to go to Atlantic City.
   ``I said, `Alright, God, do you want me to do this?'' Ms. Turner
recalled. ``What's important about the story is, no, I didn't give
up.''
   Ms. Turner said afterward that she has delivered much the same
speech to dozens of school audiences, but that the message of
motivating youth to high achievement has remained fresh.
   ``Although it's the hundredth time, I'm doing something I
sincerely believe in,'' she said.

   Billy Joel once epitomized the Angry Young Man he
sang about in the mid-1970s.
   Now, at age 41, he's still angry. He's also broke.
   Joel is almost a year into a 15-month world tour to promote his
triple-platinum ``Storm Front'' LP and get himself out of a sea of
red ink.
   Althouyh one of the biggest selling solo artists in the history
of Colombia Records - with 14 albums and 25 Top-40 singles in his
catalog, Joel has little financially to show for it.
   Still in litigation is a $90 million lawsuit he filed in
September 1989 against his former manager and brother-in-law Frank
Weber for fraud and breach-of-contract. The suit asks for $60
million in punitive damages and alleges that Weber duped Joel out
of $30 million, losing $10 million of it in unsafe investments.
   ``I haven't gotten a penny back yet,'' Joel said in an interview
before a recent sold-out concert here. ``The bulk of the lawsuit is
still with the lawyers.
   ``The reason for the length of this tour is financial. Look, at
this age, you don't want to go out on the road for fun and games.
When I started the tour, I was in deep financial straits. The
accounting firm I'm with now said I was looking at a deep, deep,
deep, deep financial hole that would take two years to get out of.
So I said, `OK,' and put my head down and went to work and I'm
getting back in the black.
   ``Am I angry about it? Bitter is a good word. The worst thing is
having to spend so much time away from my kid added Joel,'' who is
married to supermodel Christie Brinkley. They have a 4-year-old
daughter, Alexa Ray. ``When I was a kid, my dad was gone a lot and
I swore to myself that when I became a father, I'm going to be
home. So here I am - on the road, away from my kid.
   ``That's the thing that gets me the most. I'll make up the money
somehow. I'll make good on that. But the time spent away from my
kid isn't something you can make back. That's what I'm really
bitter about.''
   Joel is well aware that his cash-flow problems would be history
if he agreed to tour sponsorship, but the subject makes him
bristle.
   ``I'm not comfortable with it. Whatever celebrity I have was
given to me by people. To trade in on it would be a betrayal to
that,'' he said. ``Coke asked me. It was a lot of money. Millions
and millions of dollars. George Michael got that deal. Pepsi made
me an offer, I turned that down and Madonna got that deal.
   ``Part of me was saying to myself, `What are you, nuts? Take the
money!' The funny thing is, I actually drink the stuff. But I can't
really recommend it to other people.''
   If he did accept sponsorship, Joel is wary of another round of
bashing from some segments of the media. The five-time Grammy
winner said certain music critics have been on his back ever since
``The Stranger'' album produced four Top-20 singles in 1978.
   ``As soon as I started selling records, I was perceived in some
circles to be this commercial wunderkind, a tunesmith-balladeer, a
Tin Pan Alley man. You know, `Need a hit? Let me grind it out'
That's not how I write. Any hit I've had is an accident,'' he said.
   Born William Martin Joel, he grew up in Hicksville, N.Y., and
discovered Mozart at age 4 before taking 10 years of piano lessons.
   As a second-grader, Joel remembers watching Elvis Presley
perform on television one night and then trying to duplicate his
moves at school the next day.
   ``I got up on stage during lunch hour in the gym and did my
Elvis impersonation and the girls in the third grade started
screaming because I was shaking my hips and doing `Hound Dog.' The
teacher dragged me off the stage, thinking I had done something
really nasty. Hey, you don't even have hips in the second grade.
But I was thinking, `This is great.' I knew there was something to
this and it stayed with me,'' he said.
   ``When I saw the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Show, I looked at
them and said, `That's it. That's what I want to do.' Those guys
didn't look like Frankie Avalon or Fabian. They wrote their own
songs, played their own instruments and they had the coolest hair
in the world.
   ``The first gig I did was when I was 15, in 1964. I played in a
band at Holy Family Church in Hicksville. Girls who wouldn't look
twice at me now liked me. At the end of the night, the priest came
over and gave us $5 each. You got PAID for this stuff. That locked
the backdoor. There was no way out for me. I was hooked.
   ``I didn't graduate from Hicksville High. Too many absences. I
was working until 3 o'clock in the morning in clubs. Who could wake
up at 7 o'clock?''
   In 1971, Joel was homeless, sleeping on laundromat floors and
surviving on peanut butter sandwiches when he signed a solo
recording contract with Family Productions.

<TEXT>
   Welcome to sophomore history, a look at
post-World War II global events. Now put on your headphones and
pump up the volume, dude.
   It's the classroom of the '90s, where Billy Joel's No. 1 single
``We Didn't Start the Fire'' will soon have teachers turning to
their turntables to help students learn about history from Harry
Truman to Tiananmen Square.
   A special cassette version of the rapid-fire single, including a
10-minute talk by Joel, will be provided to 40,000 junior and
senior high school students nationwide, according to the singer's
label, CBS Records.
   ``A lot of people tend to think history is just this drab series
of boring names and dates that you just have to connect to pass the
test,'' Joel says on the tape. ``Really, history is a living thing.
We are where we are today, and we are who we are today, because of
our history.''
   Joel says he's received letters from both teachers and students
about the song, his highest-charting single since ``Uptown Girl''
in November 1983. The Grammy-winning singer-songwriter also reveals
on the tape that he once considered a career as a history teacher.
   The cassette will be distributed in conjunction with Scholastic
magazine; teachers will receive a poster-sized copy of the lyrics
and a lesson plan to aid them.
   The tapes will be sent out with the Jan. 26 issue of Junior
Scholastic magazine, for junior high school students, and Update
magazine, for high schoolers, said Scholastic public relations
manager Stephanie Feuer.
   ``We're trying to create a bridge between the classroom and
what's going on in the outside world,'' said Ms. Feuer. ``We're
bringing their world into the classroom.''
   Joel packs enough images into the song to fill a few volumes of
the World Book: He begins with Harry Truman, touches on the Korean
War, ``trouble in the Suez,'' ``Belgians in the Congo,'' the JFK
assassination, then wraps it up with a string of current events
climaxing with ``rock and roller cola wars.''
   Each year from 1949 through 1963 gets a verse; USA Today
described it as ``musical Cliff Notes.''
   Joel, in an interview with Rolling Stone, said teachers have
told him the song is ``the greatest teaching tool to come down the
pike since Sesame Street, which means a lot to me.''
   A fifth-grade class at the Banta Elementary School in Menasha,
Wis., used the song lyrics last year to select topics for history
reports.
   The single is from Joel's ``Storm Front'' album; its success has
not been limited to the United States. ``We Didn't Start the Fire''
has gone Top Five in Canada, Australia, Japan and Germany, while
hitting the Top 10 in England, Holland, Norway and New Zealand.
   Joel's interests weren't strictly educational _ there is a
record to be sold, as Ms. Feuer noted.
   ``These kids are part of the record-buying public, and he hasn't
had a No. 1 record in six, seven years,'' she said. ``The record
company wanted to do something a little different.''

<HEAD>Joel Sues Former Brother-In-Law and Manager</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 5 grafs to update with published report of Joel hospitalized.
Picks up 3rd graf pvs, `The lawsuit ...'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer Billy Joel is suing his former manager
for $90 million, alleging that he stole millions of dollars and
lost millions more in risky investments such as horsebreeding.
   The suit was filed Monday, the day after Joel was hospitalized
with severe abdominal pain from kidney stones, the New York Post
reported today.
   The pain struck Joel as he waited Sunday afternoon at John F.
Kennedy International Airport for a Concorde supersonic flight to
London, said Joel's lawyer, Leonard Marks. The trip was part of a
tour of Europe to promote his new album, ``Storm Front.''
   Marks would not disclose the name of the hospital. ``He's in
this country and he's OK _ that's all I can tell you,'' he said.
   The lawsuit was filed in state court against Frank Weber, who
was fired Aug. 30, after an audit uncovered the alleged thefts,
Marks said. Weber also was Joel's former brother-in-law.
   The lawsuit charges that Weber used Joel's money in the form of
interest-free loans; misued his power of attorney by signing the
singer's name to documents without his consent; and invested Joel's
money in high-risk ventures despite the singer's express
instructions to invest conservatively.
   Court documents said the horsebreeding venture in which Weber
invested without his consent, Thoroughbred Breeding Associates, is
a partnership with Weber as general partner.
   There was no answer at Weber's lawyer's office when The
Associated Press called Monday.

YES, IT'S THAT TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN OUR FEARLESS FORECASTER OF GRAMMY GLORY 
AGAIN PUTS HIS REPUTATION ON THE LINE

<P>
The Grammys embrace rock. 
</P>
<P>
That's the usual headline on stories about how the Grammy nominations have 
gotten hipper in recent years. Among the acclaimed rock acts who have been 
nominated since the mid-'80s for album and/or record of the year honors: Bruce 
Springsteen, Prince, Peter Gabriel, David Bowie and Tracy Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grammys snub rock. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the usual headline on stories about how Grammy voters, in choosing the 
winners, continue to favor top-selling pop attractions over adventurous rock 
artists. None of the rockers cited above made it past the nomination stage in 
the two most prestigious categories. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, U2's anthem "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" lost 
the song of the year award to the old-fashioned movie theme "Somewhere Out 
There." Last year, Chapman's stark, socially conscious "Fast Car" lost the 
record of the year prize to Bobby McFerrin's amiable but lightweight "Don't 
Worry . . . Be Happy." 
</P>
<P>
It's as if the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences -- which 
awards the Grammys -- has enlisted enough young, rock-conscious members to 
enable rock performers to be nominated in key categories, but not enough to 
enable them to win. In the end, the 7,000-member academy's large contingent of 
older, tradition-minded voters usually prevails. 
</P>
<P>
There have been exceptions. U2's critically lauded "The Joshua Tree" won the 
Grammy for album of the year two years ago. But the prizes mostly go to 
mainstream pop favorites like Phil Collins and George Michael. 
</P>
<P>
What does all this mean for this year's awards, which will be presented on 
Wednesday in a nationally televised ceremony at the Shrine Auditorium? 
</P>
<P>
Billy Joel, get that tux pressed. 
</P>
<P>
Even though multiple nominees Don Henley and Fine Young Cannibals are the toast 
of the rock critical Establishment, we're putting our money on Joel for record 
of the year and the Traveling Wilburys for best album. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Record of the Year 
</P>
<P>
Fine Young Cannibals' "She Drives Me Crazy" isn't nominated in the song of the 
year category, which all but dooms its chances. Since 1972, every record of the 
year champ was at least nominated for best song. 
</P>
<P>
Mike + the Mechanics' classy, heartfelt "The Living Years" sounds like a 
winner, but the group has an identity problem -- namely, it doesn't have one. 
If a high-profile artist like Steve Winwood had recorded this song, it probably 
would win. 
</P>
<P>
Bette Midler's traditional ballad "Wind Beneath My Wings" is the kind of single 
that would have won hands-down in the early '70s, but no longer. As far back as 
10 years ago, Barbra Streisand and Neil Diamond's "You Don't Bring Me Flowers" 
-- the quintessential record in this genre -- lost out to the Doobie Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Don Henley's "The End of the Innocence" is a strong candidate, but how many 
Grammy voters can hum it in the shower? Don't scoff: The hum factor probably 
explains why "Don't Worry . . . Be Happy" won. Also, the single peaked at No. 8 
on the weekly sales charts. Every record of the year winner since 1977 has 
reached the Top 3 except for Paul Simon's "Graceland." 
</P>
<P>
That leaves Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire," a time-capsule history of 
the past four decades of pop culture. We used to think voters would regard this 
as a clever but shallow and even irritating novelty record. Then we remembered 
"Don't Worry . . . Be Happy." 
</P>
<P>
Joel it is, then, for the second time in this category (he won in 1978 for 
"Just the Way You Are"). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Album of the Year 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Raitt's "Nick of Time," which has yet to go platinum (1 million copies), 
is a l-o-n-g-shot. Every album of the year champ has been a multiplatinum 
seller since platinum awards were introduced in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Petty, nominated as a member of the Traveling 
</P>
<P>
Wilburys and for his own "Full Moon Fever," is the first artist to have two 
albums in the finals since Streisand in 1964. But people who like Petty will 
probably vote for the Wilburys, to enable his famous cronies to share the 
glory. 
</P>
<P>
Fine Young Cannibals' "The Raw &amp; the Cooked" will be the clear favorite of 
the academy's under-30 voters. Both of them. 
</P>
<P>
Again, Henley's "The End of the Innocence" is a strong contender. But the title 
track is its main calling card, and if that won't win, why should the album? 
</P>
<P>
That leaves "Traveling Wilburys, Vol. 1," a widely admired collaboration by 
five celebrated rock veterans -- Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Petty, Jeff Lynne 
and the late Roy Orbison. This album has the broadest potential base of support 
-- from pop and rock listeners to country and adult contemporary adherents -- 
of any of the nominees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Song of the Year 
</P>
<P>
This award traditionally favors compositions that have the potential to become 
standards -- i.e. romantic ballads. That hurts the chances of both "We Didn't 
Start the Fire" (written by Joel) and "The End of the Innocence" (Henley and 
Bruce Hornsby). "The Living Years" (Mike Rutherford and B. A. Robertson) will 
probably finish somewhere in the middle, with the race coming down to the Linda 
Ronstadt-Aaron Neville smash "Don't Know Much" (Barry Mann, Cynthia Weil and 
Tom Snow) and "Wind Beneath My Wings" (Larry Henley and Jeff Silbar). 
</P>
<P>
The well-liked Mann and Weil won this award two years ago for the 
Ronstadt-James Ingram smash "Somewhere Out There." But this time they're 
outmatched. "Wind" is the year's most obvious standard, and the likely winner. 
</P>
<P>
Though Janet Jackson was shut out in the big categories, she's the front-runner 
in four other contests. That would make her the year's biggest multiple winner. 
And in one of those races -- best long-form music video -- she's going 
head-to-head with older brother and rival Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
That's the real drama in this year's Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the likely winners in other key races: 
</P>
<P>
BEST NEW ARTIST: Jazzie B's critically lauded British soul ensemble Soul II 
Soul will edge out critically panned mega-sellers Milli Vanilli. 
</P>
<P>
POP MALE: Joel is very strong, but how can voters bypass Orbison, one of the 
classic pop vocalists of all time? Is it a sympathy vote? No. It's a final 
chance for the academy to rectify past wrongs whereby Orbison never won in the 
pop field. 
</P>
<P>
POP FEMALE: Midler won in 1980 for "The Rose" and she'll win again. (Unless 
enough last-minute voters went to "Stella" screenings.) 
</P>
<P>
POP DUO/GROUP: Duets often win in this category, and Ronstadt and Aaron Neville 
are both highly respected. 
</P>
<P>
ROCK MALE: It's a toss-up between Petty and Henley. Since Petty has never won a 
Grammy, he has the edge. (That makes three No. 2 finishes for Henley, who will 
go home knowing how the Denver Broncos feel.) 
</P>
<P>
ROCK FEMALE: Bonnie Raitt's album of the year nomination is the tip-off. She'll 
beat Tina Turner, who has had a lock on this award since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
ROCK DUO/GROUP: The Wilburys again. Fellow nominees the Rolling Stones have yet 
to win a Grammy (!), but this probably won't be their year. 
</P>
<P>
HARD ROCK: Controversial mega-sellers Guns N' Roses define the category and 
will likely win, though Living Colour, which tore down the Berlin Wall of 
segregated rock and black playlists, will also have support. 
</P>
<P>
METAL: Metallica, upset last year by the miscategorized Jethro Tull, will 
finally prevail. 
</P>
<P>
R&amp;B MALE: In the year of Bobby Brown, who else could possibly win? 
</P>
<P>
R&amp;B FEMALE: Anita Baker beat Janet Jackson three years ago. This is 
Jackson's year to turn the tables. 
</P>
<P>
R&amp;B DUO/GROUP: Soul II Soul wins Award II. 
</P>
<P>
RAP: Tone Loc made the biggest splash, becoming the first black rapper to top 
the pop album chart. That makes his smash "Funky Cold Medina" a clear favorite. 
</P>
<P>
COUNTRY MALE: Clint Black, country's hottest newcomer since Randy Travis, 
should beat two-time winner Travis. 
</P>
<P>
COUNTRY FEMALE: k.d. lang won last year for a duet with Orbison and should win 
this year on her own. 
</P>
<P>
COUNTRY DUO/GROUP: In the absence of a strong alternative, the Judds are the 
favorites to win here for the fifth time in six years. 
</P>
<P>
COUNTRY VOCAL COLLABORATION: How could the voters resist Hank Williams Jr.'s 
teaming with his late and legendary father Hank Williams on "There's a Tear in 
My Beer"? 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC VIDEO -- SHORT FORM: Michael Jackson revealed a sense of humor about 
himself in "Leave Me Alone." For that astonishment, he deserves a Grammy. 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC VIDEO -- LONG FORM: Michael Jackson's nominated here too for 
"Moonwalker," but will likely lose to sister Janet's "Rhythm Nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Grein tabbed 14 of 21 categories correctly last year. Done in by his 
prediction of a clean sweep for Tracy Chapman, he resolved not to read any rock 
criticism in the month leading up to Grammy voting.

Billy Sings the Blues: Billy Joel, almost a year into a 15-month world tour to 
promote his triple-platinum "Storm Front" LP, says he is touring primarily to 
get himself out of a sea of red ink. "The reason for the length of this tour is 
financial," he told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, at this age, you don't want to go out on the road for fun and games. 
When I started the tour, I was in deep financial straits . . . I was looking at 
a deep, deep, deep, deep financial hole that would take two years to get out 
of. So I said, 'OK,' and put my head down and went to work and I'm getting back 
in the black." CLAUDIA PUIG

<HEAD>Garry Shandling Host for Star-Studded Salute to Recording Artists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ANTCZAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rambling, slow speech is the nemesis of
any television awards show. So how did comedian Garry Shandling get
picked to be host of the three-hour CBS telecast of the 32nd annual
Grammy Awards?
   ``Well, you know, I hosted the ACE awards a few years ago, and,
and, and uh, uh, it went well and it really wasn't a problem with
uh, my, my delivery,'' the droll Shandling explains.
   ``It's not, it's really not that slow. You know I'm laid back
but _ I put it more as laid back _ I've never had anyone actually
come up to me and say, `Speak faster,' other than my girlfriend in
the heat of an argument.''
   The National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences will present
its coveted Grammys for the best music of 1989 at the cavernous
Shrine Auditorium on Wednesday.
   Don Henley and his thoughtful ``The End of the Innocence'' album
was nominated for four top awards, leading a host of pop and rock
veterans up for more awards or receiving long-overdue consideration
for Grammys.
   Henley, who has one solo Grammy to his credit and four from his
old days with the Eagles, had his LP nominated for album of the
year and best male rock performance. The title tune is up for
record and song of the year.
   Other nominees include Bette Midler, Linda Ronstadt, Tom Petty,
Billy Joel and Bonnie Raitt, who's looking for the first Grammy in
a distinguished career. Perennial favorite Aretha Franklin could
win her 16th Grammy.
   Prince also was a major nominee, earning four of seven bids
drawn by the ``Batman'' movie soundtrack. Neneh Cherry, Indigo
Girls, Milli Vanilli, Soul II Soul and Tone Loc were nominated as
best new artists of 1989.
   Presentations will be framed by performances of nominees Harolyn
Blackwell, Larry Carlton, Rodney Crowell, Miles Davis, Fine Young
Cannibals, Herbie Hancock, Henley, Billy Joel, k.d. lang, Branford
Marsalis, Aaron Neville, Raitt, Ronstadt and Sting.
   The glitter, glamour and variety will be provided by presenters
including spunky dance queen Paula Abdul, rockers Motley Crue and
Bob Seger, breezy singer Olivia Newton-John and actress Meryl
Streep.
   So what does Shandling figure to do?
   ``I'll do a little opening monologue _ and then I understand
there's going to be some music. From what I understand there's a
lot of music on this particular awards program,'' he said.
   The connection between Shandling, star of ``It's Garry
Shandling's Show,'' and the recording industry seems a bit tenuous.
   ``I made a 45 once,'' he says, conceding: ``I have a little
catching up to do. I still have an eight-track tape system.''
   Shandling will review the award show format and write his own
material. Beyond his haircut and getting plenty of sleep the night
before, he claims no worries about the show.
   ``I guess Guns N' Roses isn't going to be making an acceptance
speech, so that takes some of the risk out,'' he says.
   ``It'll be exciting to meet a lot of the musical stars who will
be there because I've spent quite a lot of money on them. This will
be an opportunity for them to give me some of my cash back. ... I'm
certainly going to hit Paul McCartney up for $200,000.''
   McCartney and jazz trumpeter Miles Davis will receive lifetime
achievement awards. Dick Clark will be presented the Trustees
Award, and posthumous tributes will be paid to pianist-crooner Nat
``King'' Cole and pianist Vladimir Horowitz.
   In all, there were 388 nominees in 77 categories.

   But his debut LP in 1972, ``Cold Spring Harbor,'' was mastered
at the wrong speed. So he played piano bars under the name Bill
Martin and gathered material for his hit debut album for Columbia -
``Piano Man'' - in 1973.
   His problems, however, were far from over.
   ``I signed away a lot of things in those early days,'' he said.
``I signed away publishing rights, copyrights, a lot of record
royalties. I tell you, I'm not a businessman. But I assumed in this
just land of ours that there's some law against indentured
servitude. You can't pay for a mistake for 20 years.''
   The on-going legal hassles are the main reason why Joel can't
help out other aspiring acts.
   ``People send me tapes all the time. They either want me to do
their material or they want to know what I think. I used to like
that. Now, I send them right back,'' he said. ``A laywer can say,
`Billy Joel used the word `the' in a song. Didn't you use the word
`the' in the song that you sent him? Hey, sue him!'
   ``It's a total defeat for the little guy because no one will
listen to their tapes now because of all these lawsuits,'' added
Joel, who once was unsuccessfully sued by someone who claimed he
wrote ``My Life,'' Joel's No. 1 single in 1978.
   ``Guys who do what I do, we don't need to steal. We write our
own stuff. All the music I write, I've dreamt. I dream music all
the time. I don't dream scenes and scenerios like most people do. I
dream abstractions - shapes, colors, sounds, symphonies. I wake up
and I don't remember what I dreamt, but it's in my subconscious
like a filing cabinet.
   ``When I sit down to write, I try to get into that filing
cabinet and once in a while, a little window or drawer will pop
open with the music in it and I'll be able to write it very
quickly.''
   The formula has produced a string of hits, including ``We Didn't
Start the Fire,'' which topped the charts earlier this year.
   The song, which featured a barrage of headline events over the
past 40 years, was widely used as a history-teaching tool for
junior high and high school students across the country.
   Joel's ``Storm Front'' tour began Dec. 6, 1989 in Worcester,
Mass., and is scheduled to end in March in New Zealand. By the time
it's over, he and his seven-piece band will have played 165 shows
to more than 3.5 million fans on five continents.
   On Dec. 5, he will take a one-day break from the tour and return
to New York City to receive a humanitarian award from the Cathedral
of St. John the Divine and a ``Grammy Legends'' award in a
television ceremony.
   Past humanitarian winners include Leonard Bernstein and Duke
Ellington. Joel will be honored as a ``Grammy Legend'' along with
three of his idols: Quincy Jones, Aretha Franklin and Johnny Cash.
``How does a little pup like me get in there? It's wild.
   ``I'd like to be remembered as a writer. I believe in the stuff
I've written. Those are the things that really end up being your
legacy. I'm not a showman and I don't really feel like I'm an
entertainer.''
   But Joel can relate to his past and shakes his head in disbelief
over all he's survived.
   His father left home when Joel was 7, he considered suicide and
checked himself into a mental institution in his early 20s,
fractured his right wrist and left thumb in a 1982 motorcycle
accident that put his career in jeopardy, and was divorced in 1982
after a nine-year marriage to Elizabeth Weber. His nose still shows
signs of the 26 amateur fights he had at age 19.
   ``It always amazes me, the resilience of human beings. It's
unbelievable. But I'm happy to be anywhere,'' he said with a laugh.
   ``I'm as old as a '49 Studebaker. Ever look at a car from 1949?
The steel is all rusted out, the body is all dented and falling
apart, the upholstery is all ripped and the engine doesn't work.
   ``I look in the mirror and say, `Well, you ain't Cary Grant but
you ain't in the junkyard, either.' But I'm happy with my life.
Very happy. It's nothing at all like I pictured it would be.''

   The weight of office off his shoulders, Ed Koch
now simply wants to take off weight.
   Just four days out of City Hall, the porky former mayor
presented himself Thursday as the new pitchman for a weight-loss
powder, unabashedly touting its reputed benefits and his own
overstuffed profile.
   ``I know I'm fat,'' he said. ``I can tell you how I know I'm
fat. I see myself in the mirror, naked. Horrible.''
   Koch's fatness is not news to New Yorkers, whom the mayor

   Billy Joel says he feels like part of his family
has been taken when others claim ownership of his songs.
   Joel told Rolling Stone magazine in the Jan. 9 issue that he's
``not all that rich'' and may, in fact, owe money.
   The 40-year-old singer is touring and has just released ``Storm
Front,'' his most successful album in a decade, but he said
copyright disputes over some of his past songs have made his
financial status questionable.
   ``For better or worse, your songs are your kids. Then somebody
comes along and tells you that they're not your kids anymore. The
bank is going to take your kid,'' he said.
   He said part of the problem is that artists are ``knuckleheads
when it comes to business. Money isn't why I did what I've done
with my life. I did what I did because it made me happy. But I'm
tired of getting it taken away from me by other people who haven't
earned it.''
   Meanwhile, he says people too often misunderstand his
relationship with his wife, supermodel Christie Brinkley, ``as if
somehow Christie and I don't love and hurt and feel the same things
that anybody else does.''
   ``What do they think we do _ walk in the door and fly around on
gossamer and glitzy gliders? Don't people realize that the minute
the door closes, all of the silly rock star-supermodel stuff goes
right out the window? Then it's just me and her and real
man-and-wife time,'' Joel said.

   In a first for television, the title sequence
for the new Shadoe Stevens adventure series ``Max Monroe: Loose
Cannon'' has been turned into a music video that will soon be seen
on MTV.
   The music video uses the hit single ``Tied Up'' by the popular
European group Yello. The video features Stevens and co-star Bruce
Young along with Yello members Boris Blank and Dieter Meier.
   ``I'm one of Yello's biggest fans. Yello is inventive,
experimental, intelligent and has the sound of the '90s,'' said
Stevens, who is also host of the radio show ``American Top 40.''
   Parts of the video will be seen each week during the title
sequence of the one-hour CBS-TV series premiering tonight.
   Stevens stars as the unconventional police detective who will do
anything, no matter how wild, in the pursuit of a criminal suspect.

   Gabonese President Omar Bongo,
offering cash and an assortment of traditional gifts, married the
daughter of the president of the neighboring Congo.
   State radio said the marriage of Bongo and Edith Sassou Nguesso,
a 27-year-old doctor, took place in a family ceremony in Oyo, the
home village of President Denis Sassou Nguesso about 250 miles
north of Brazzaville.
   Bongo, 54, who has three children from a previous marriage,
offered about $170 to the families of his new wife's father and
mother, along with two pieces of fabric, a headscarf, a men's suit,
a pair of women's shoes, a shovel and a hoe.
   In August, when rumors of the marriage began to circulate, Bongo
refused to confirm or deny them. ``People should stop concerning
themselves with something that's none of their business,'' said
Bongo, who has been president of Gabon, a country of 1.5 million on
Africa's West Coast, since 1967.

   A white Mercedes owned by George Harrison and used
in the Beatles' film ``Let It Be'' sold for $29,740 at an auction
of rock memorabilia, Christie's auction house said.
   The 1969 car drew the highest price of any of the 426 items on
sale Thursday, said Victoria Wolcough of Christie's.
   Other auction highlights included handwritten lyrics to
``Whatever Gets You Through the Night,'' John Lennon's first hit
after leaving the Beatles, which went for $10,224; a pair of
Michael Jackson's dancing shoes, which fetched $5,577; and the
first major collection of clothing owned by the late punk rocker
Sid Vicious to be sold, which went for more than $16,900.
   ``It was an enthusiastic crowd, a very busy auction,'' said Ms.
Wolcough, adding that buying was dominated by Warren Stone of the
Hard Rock Cafe in Los Angeles and by Brian Murphy of the London
Hard Rock Cafe.

   Robert Mondavi, the dean of California
vintners, celebrated the 1988 harvest with the annual blessing of
grapes and the start of the crush in Napa Valley.
   Beaming under a cloudless, sunny sky Thursday, the energetic,
75-year-old Mondavi told tourists and guests crowding the crushing
area at his winery, ``This is our 23rd vintage ... thank you for
coming.''
   The crowd applauded after the Rev. Andre Tournier of St. Joan of
Arc Church in Yountville, wearing a 200-year-old robe, blessed the
grapes with new juice and holy water.
   After the blessing, Mondavi made a small speech, then wine was
served from tables lining the rear of the crush area.
   In 1966, Mondavi built Napa Valley's first new winery since
Prohibition. He began a quality-building program that, less than 10
years later, helped California wine compete successfully with
world-class European wines for the first time.

   Lawyers for the Beatles' licensing company
have filed suit over what they charge are pirated compact disc
recordings of songs and interviews by the former rock group.
   ``It not only rips off the Beatles, it rips off the public,''
said attorney Paul LiCalsi, representing London-based Apple Corps
Ltd.
   The eight pirated CDs include a 1961 audition tape the Beatles
made for Decca records and a 1962 live performance in Hamburg, he
said Thursday.
   The suit names Jay Chernow of Sayreville and two companies, San
Juan Record and Tape Club Ltd. and Music Rent, both of Parlin,
among other defendants.
   Reached for comment, Chernow said he was the president of the
companies, which only do licensing. He said the music and
interviews were legally licensed and denied the allegations in the
suit.

   Austrian maestro Herbert von Karajan,
the No. 1 attraction of the Salzburg festival for 30 years,
announced his resignation from the five-member festival directorate.
   Von Karajan, 80, who suffered a circulatory collapse last week
and had to cancel three conducting appearances, was the festival's
sole artistic director in 1956-60 and has been on the directorate
since 1964.
   Von Karajan's terse letter Thursday to festival president Albert
Moser gave no reasons for the surprise decision, prompting
speculation the maestro may have quit in a huff rather than because
he is ill. A copy of the letter was published by the Austria Press
Agency.
   For years, the festival has been the target of media criticism
for being elitist, too expensive and too conservative. The quality
of some of the performances also has been disputed.
   In a statement, the directorate noted the world-famous
conductor's decision ``with the greatest regret.''
   The statement said it was ``understandable'' that von Karajan
might want to lessen his administrative duties to concentrate on
artistic work and added the festival ``will do all in its power''
to secure him as a conductor for concerts and operas in future.
   Von Karajan has conducted at the famed summer music festival
since 1948.

   A defamation lawsuit filed by a
musician against rock star Billy Joel has been dismissed by the
Nevada Supreme Court because the musician's lawyer failed to file a
timely notice of appeal.
   Carson City musician John Powers sued after Joel called him ``a
creep'' and ``a poor little schlump'' and said he would like ``to
break his legs with my own hands'' in a 1982 Playboy magazine
interview.
   The Supreme Court's dismissal of the case Wednesday ended a
10-year legal battle that began when Powers sued Joel, claiming
Joel's 1978 hit ``My Life'' was originally recorded by Powers.
   Joel settled that suit in 1980 for $42,500, later saying his
attorneys and business manager told him to settle it as a nuisance
suit because it would cost him more to fight it.
   Part of the settlement was that Powers stop claiming the Joel
hit was a song Powers recorded in 1974. But Powers allegedly
continued to claim Joel's song was stolen, prompting Joel's
comments in the magazine interview.
   The state Supreme Court appeal was filed after a Reno judge
ruled in April that Joel didn't commit slander or defamation
although his remarks appeared to vilify Powers.

<HEAD>Rap Has Gone Establishment, But Is It Here To Stay?</HEAD>

   Rap music's come a long way from the days of parties in the
South Bronx, when disc jockeys manipulated records in a frantic
competition to see who could keep people on the dance floor te
longest.
   Now it seems rap is everywhere, and is firmly established as a
music category at the annual Grammy Awards, which will be held Feb.
21.
   That makes Grandmaster Flash proud, even though this pioneer
barely has time to pause from his producing chores to reflect on
rap's rapid rise.
   ``I'm a little shocked, but then again I'm happy because I knew
it was an appealing form of music,'' said Flash, one of a handful
of deejays credited with creating rap in the mid-1970s. ``But to
what magnitude it would reach was a mystery to me.''
   Rappers sell millions of records, but their names and music are
as bewildering to a generation of Americans over age 21 as John,
Paul, George and Ringo were more than 25 years ago.
   It's a veritable alphabet soup of stars. There's LL Cool J and
Kool Moe Dee. There's NWA, Heavy D, Ice-T and Run-DMC. There's
Young MC and MC Lyte, DJ Jazzy Jeff and D-Nice. There's Salt 'n'
Pepa, Flavor Flav and the Fat Boys.
   ``The groove is good. You can dance to it,'' said LL Cool J,
updating the line teen-agers have used to praise records on
``American Bandstand'' since before he was born.
   Like Bob Dylan in the 1960s, rap's opened the door to many
artists who aren't conventional singers but have something to say.
Because of rap, the beat has overshadowed the melody as the primary
element in many pop songs. To the chagrin of many, rap popularized
the technique of ``sampling'' old sounds in new music.
   Rap also has emphasized differences _ political, racial, musical
and generational _ still alive in music and society as a whole.
   Flash, the moniker of Joseph Saddler, spun disco records at
clubs and parties in the South Bronx. He and fellow deejays used
turntables and records the way other musicians used guitars and
keyboards. Eventually, some dejays started ``rapping'' or talking
through microphones over the music.
   ``Hip-hop'' and breakdancing became hot styles. Rap records,
many released on independent labels, became hits through word of
mouth and play in dance clubs. ``The Message,'' a 1982
state-of-the-ghetto report by Flash and his band, the Furious Five,
was an early landmark.
   Rap technicians quickly learned to mine old records for new
sounds. Now it's a popular practice. Janet Jackson's hit, ``Rhythm
Nation,'' uses a passage directly lifted from an old Sly and the
Family Stone record. Jailed soul star James Brown has reached a
whole new generation of listeners because of old passages
``sampled'' in new rap songs, says LL Cool J.
   Some artists are flattered by the new attention, others so angry
they launch lawsuits.
   Many pop music fans say rap has claimed the mantle of innovation
that rock music earned in the 1960s.
   ``It can actually stand on its own legs now, where at one point
it was understood to be a fad,'' Flash said. ``It was just
considered in its own little category. From a technical and
creative point of view, I always knew that this could intertwine
with various forms of music _ your jazz, blues, rock and pop.''
   Another fan is 38-year-old William Adler. He's admittedly a
little biased, since his job at Rush Artists Management involves
steering the careers of rap artists such as Public Enemy and LL
Cool J.
   ``To me, it's the most thrilling rock 'n' roll being made
today,'' Adler said. ``Do I want a big beat? It's there. Do I want
rebellion? It's there. Do I want wit, do I want sex, do I want
social engagement, do I want nonsense? All there. And it delivers
it to me in greater measure than any other comparable musical form
right now.''
   Rap styles are as diverse as music itself.
   DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince are good-natured pop stars,
with such novelty songs as ``I Think I Can Beat Mike Tyson,'' and
the teen anthem ``Parents Just Don't Understand.'' The aptly named
Fat Boys have made duets with the Beach Boys and Chubby Checker.
   Artists such as NWA and Public Enemy are on the other end of the
spectrum, with blunt lyrics that pick up where ``The Message'' left
off. A controversial NWA song about black attitudes toward police
left law enforcement on edge. Public Enemy, with its recent single,
``Welcome to the Terrordome,'' has opened a Jewish-black rift.
   Many rappers are simply braggarts claiming to be the biggest,
the baddest, the best. That, in turn, has brought complaints of
sexism and the calculatedly contrary stance of artists such as the
female Salt 'n' Pepa and the 1960s-influenced De La Soul.
   Rap and rock have also forged an interesting alliance. They were
thought to be contrary camps, until Run-DMC's hugely influential
remake of Aerosmith's ``Walk This Way'' broke down barriers in 1987.
   High ratings for MTV's ``Yo! MTV Raps!'' show also indicate that
rap is not just music for black teen-agers.
   ``Black America is not hooked up for cable, I'm sorry,'' Adler
said. ``It's a suburban phenomenon. So you know who the audience is
for `Yo! MTV Raps!'''
   The Grammys created a new category last year to honor rap music.
But several of its stars boycotted the awards because the rap
Grammy wasn't presented on prime-time television.
   Also, although Tone Loc's sly homage to sex, ``Wild Thing,''
last year became the biggest-selling single since ``We Are the
World,'' it never made it to No. 1 on the Billboard singles charts
because some Top 40 radio stations won't play rap. No rap single
has ever reached No. 1 on the Billboard pop charts.
   Some rappers say racism has a lot to do with that. But that
doesn't explain the so-called ``black'' radio stations that also
resist rap in favor of the soul sounds of the '60s and '70s.
   Occasional violence at rap concerts has given communities
jitters and caused some cancellations. Rappers say it's not the
music that causes trouble, but some fans who are gang members.
   Some rappers are worried about too much rap, not too little.
They wonder if rap will go the way of disco and collapse under the
weight of too many mediocre records. Russell Simmons, founder of
Def Jam Records, complains that major record labels are signing too
many bad rap acts in their attempt to find new stars.
   But radio resistance hasn't stopped rap from seeping into
mainstream culture. Advertisers looking for a youthful market know
rap sells. Rap was incorporated into the work of several Top 40
musicians through the 1980s, from Blondie's ``Rapture'' in 1980 to
Billy Joel's ``We Didn't Start the Fire'' in 1989.
   ``There's nothing wrong with that,'' LL Cool J said of the
competition with Joel, suburban Long Island's favorite white son.
``I like it. That just shows that people are opening up. If an
artist like Billy Joel does something like that, maybe people will
listen to a little guy like LL Cool J.''

SOUND &amp; VISION: NENEH CHERRY'S 'MANCHILD' TOPS AMONG MUSIC VIDEOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I believe in miracles, words in steady doses," proclaims Neneh Cherry in 
"Manchild," the top video entry in this month's Sound &amp; Vision, and indeed 
there's something near-miraculous about how her seamless, sexy, mature mix of 
pop and rap has been captured on film this time out. Rap also figures at the 
bottom of our roundup -- in which music video clips are rated on a 0-100 scale 
-- in the sexist form of LL Cool J, who proves himself in his latest tune more 
child than man. 
</P>
<P>
CLIPS PICKED TO CLICK: 
</P>
<P>
Neneh Cherry's "Manchild." (Director: Jean-Baptiste Mondino.) Nothing less than 
one of the most visually arresting video clips ever produced, illustrating one 
of 1989's truly great singles, an accusatory yet compassionate balladic 
broadside. In keeping with the theme of the song, which is directed at a 
full-grown man who has a little more growing up to do, the camera slowly rocks 
back and forth throughout the clip, as if mounted on a swing set like the one 
seen in the background on the beachside playground. The camera stops moving 
only during the portions of the song when Cherry -- who is cradling her infant 
son through much of it -- stops singing and starts to rap. Using eye-popping 
visual trickery in the pursuit of thematically relevant imagery, this is a 
likely 1990 award winner and a must-see. 94 
</P>
<P>
Concrete Blonde's "Happy Birthday." (D: Jane Simpson.) This cheerful-sounding 
song, one of the year's catchiest, is really about an unhappy birthday, but 
Johnette Napolitano -- writing about spending the night of her own 30th at home 
alone -- is following in the great rock 'n' roll tradition of making feeling 
bad sound good. It's the best pop birthday song since the Beatles took a crack 
at it, and a little more substantive, too. The fine video is very much in the 
same anti-depressant, celebratory spirit, as Napolitano alternately knocks 
around her Silver Lake apartment in her pj's or kicks balloons around while 
fronting her ace band, with some clever animation thrown in for good measure. 
80 
</P>
<P>
The B-52's' "Love Shack." (D: Adam Bernstein.) On the mindless fluff front, the 
comeback of new-wave vets the B-52's has been one of the season's more welcome 
returns, with the ascension of their "Love Shack" up the singles charts 
certainly good news for the Top 40. This bouncy clip finds the immaculately 
colorful band rolling down the sunny Georgia highway to set up at the Shaque 
D'Amour, a wonderfully mythic place where old and young of all shapes and 
colors (but "no fools allowed") can bump and grind to their hearts' content in 
the middle of the day. Sharp photography and editing help make it seem like 
even more of a Shangri-La. Anybody got an address on this place? 79 
</P>
<P>
WORTH A LOOK AND A LISTEN: 
</P>
<P>
U2's "All I Want is You." (D: Meiert Avis.) The four horsemen of U2 make only 
cameo appearances in this black-and-white tale of a circus dwarf's unrequited 
love for a trapeze artist. It gets all unnecessarily weird toward the end, a 
funeral scene in which it's impossible to figure out which character is dead. 
But this still remains one of U2's more interesting videos, for what is one of 
the band's most inherently cinematic songs; neither the video nor the single 
have received much U.S. airplay, however. 69 
</P>
<P>
Exene Cervenka's "Leave Heaven Alone." (Director: Modi.) Cervenka's folkish 
song is a heartfelt plea for mankind to refrain from filling the heavens with 
the weapons of destruction, now that the Earth itself has been all mussed up; 
the video uses obvious but affecting footage of the environment and its 
spoilage to cement the point. 67 
</P>
<P>
Janet Jackson's "Rhythm Nation." (D: Dominic Sena.) Somehow, Sound &amp; Vision 
wonders if Jackson's world-uniting vision of a "nation without geographical 
boundaries . . . united by music and dance" is the sort of utopia that'll leave 
out those of us too old, too uncoordinated or too busy being activists to cut a 
rug. In any case, the baker's dozen of hot hoofers seen in this 
well-choreographed piece of noir-lit film certainly can. And unlike most 
directors of dance videos, Sena occasionally lets the camera stay on Jackson 
and company long enough for us to actually see what kinds of steps they're 
doing. 67 
</P>
<P>
Tom Petty's "Runnin' Down a Dream." (D: Jim Lenahan.) Dreaming Tom returns to a 
surreal Wonderland, as visited in that great old clip for "Don't Come Around 
Here No More" -- only this time it's animated, in black and white, and he's 
Alice, not the Mad Hatter. 65 
</P>
<P>
Fine Young Cannibals' "Don't Look Back." (D: Kevin Godley.) Plenty of nifty 
visual trickery going on here -- just enough to distract us for several minutes 
from the fact that motionless singer Roland Gift is as uncharismatic a 
performer as he is a handsome man and gifted vocalist. 58 
</P>
<P>
Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire." (D: Chris Blum.) The title may be a 
heavy reference to original sin, or then again it may be as meaningless as the 
string of unrelated cultural icons of the baby boom era that Joel reels off. 
The video improves on the song somewhat with an amusing portrait of a nuclear 
family passing through its kitchen over the decades. But being a distraction 
there in the corner, looking too cool for school in his shades, is Billy J., 
acting all tense and pent-up like maybe this audio/visual parade of '50s-'80s 
touchstones is going to make his sensitive artist's soul explode in spontaneous 
combustion. To which one might suggest: If you can't stand the heat, get out of 
the kitchen. 50 
</P>
<P>
GAMMA RAY ROT: 
</P>
<P>
Donny Osmond's "Sacred Emotion." (Director: Michael Bay.) While grown-up Donny 
does his very best George Michael under a scorching midday sun, a buncha models 
-- sweaty beefcake and sweet-thang cheesecake alike -- build a structure from 
scratch on the Bonneville Salt Flats. It's like a symbolic modern retelling of 
the story of the Mormons settling in Utah, as choreographed by Vogue or GQ. 23 
</P>
<P>
Bon Jovi's "Living in Sin." (D: Wayne Isham.) Bon Jovi's paean to secretive 
teen sex blooms forth in video with a full-scale narrative detailing this 
underage couple's tryst at a motel, as tragically cut short by the girl's 
party-pooping parents. Before the interruptus, shots of the groping, 
love-struck youngsters are intercut with shots of the fat, unhappy parents 
getting ready to settle into separate beds. If only there were some irony 
intended there -- say, the suggestion that someday these hormonally stricken 
teens will get married and turn into their parents, as we all know they will -- 
but there can be no such irony in a genre founded on the proudly immoral 
feeling morally superior to their elders. 1 
</P>
<P>
LL Cool J's "Big Ole Butt." (D: Paris Barclay.) The state of faithfulness has 
come to this: "Lisa got a big ole butt / I know I told you I'd be true / But 
Lisa got a big ole butt / So I'm leaving you." Complete, of course, with visual 
illustrations of the lyrical sentiment from more than one hip-heavy Lisa. The 
decline of Western civ continues. 0

   Rip Torn in ``Laguna Heat'' and Juliet
Stevenson in ``The Race for the Double Helix'' won supporting actor
and actress honors Saturday, while Home Box Office dominated the
craft categories of cable television's 10th annual Awards for Cable
Excellence.
   HBO won 17 of the 46 acting and technical awards handed out at
the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills. A&amp;E Cable Network had
five, followed by The Discovery Channel with four.
   The remainder of the ACE awards are scheduled for presentation
Sunday evening at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles in a live
ceremony broadcast over 10 of the largest cable networks.
   Favorites in the awards Sunday were HBO's ``The Vietnam War
Story,'' a 30-minute dramatic anthology series that garnered 18
nominations, and the network's ``Mandela,'' based on the life of
South African activist Nelson Mandela, which had eight nominations.
   The HBO drama ``The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains'' also received
eight nominations.
   The awards are made by the National Academy of Cable Programming,
a division of the National Cable Television Association. This past
September, cable shows and performers participated in the Emmy
awards for the first time, but the cable industry said it would
continue its own awards program.
   On Saturday, Torn won for supporting actor in a movie or
miniseries for HBO's ``Laguna Heat,'' while Ms. Stevenson won for
supporting actress in the same category for ``The Race for the
Double Helix'' on A&amp;E Cable Network.
   Jack Wallner picked up an award for photography and-or lighting
direction for an episode of ``Vietnam War Story,'' while ``Mandela''
won Ralph Sheldon an editing award.
   Daniel Massey was the actor honored for a dramatic or theatrical
special for ``HBO Showcase: Intimate Contact,'' while Stockard
Channing took the actress honor for another HBO Showcase
presentation, ``Tidy Endings,'' which also won Gavin Millar an ACE
for directing a dramatic or theatrical special.
   Pop music star Billy Joel won the ACE for performance in a music
special for ``HBO World Stage: Billy Joel Live from Leningrad,
U.S.S.R,'' which captured his recent concert series in the Soviet
Union.

series for ``Yes, Prime Minister,'' a British show aired by A&amp;E
Cable Network.

   Three dramas dealing with contemporary issues,
``Mandela,'' ``Vietnam War Story'' and ``Tidy Endings,'' led Home
Box Office to a smashing victory Sunday in the cable industry's 10th
Annual ACE Awards.
   The trio of dramas won 13 awards as HBO captured a total of 35
Awards for Cable Excellence, four times more than the nearest
competitor, Arts &amp; Entertainment Network with eight. In all, HBO had
received 114 nominations in the 76 categories for which prizes were
given.
   Danny Glover, Alfre Woodard, Stockard Channing, Rip Torn, Robin
Williams, Billy Crystal, Jackie Mason and Billy Joel were among the
performers cited by the National Academy of Cable Programming. Lucy
Webb won her fourth consecutive ACE as best actress in a comedy
series for HBO's ``Not Necessarily the News.''
   ``Vietnam War Story,'' a 30-minute anthology series, won five
awards including best dramatic series. Wesley Snipes was named best
actor, and in the dramatic series category the show also won for
directing, writing and direction of photography. It had received 18
nominations, the most of any show.
   Pamela Reed was named best actress in a dramatic series for HBO's
``Tanner '88.''
   Glover and Ms. Woodard won as best actor and actress in a movie
or miniseries for ``Mandela,'' which got four ACEs in all. Glover
starred as Nelson Mandela, imprisoned South African founder of the
African National Congress, and Woodard was Winnie Mandela, his wife
and fellow activist. The drama also won for directing and film
editing.
   ``Tidy Endings,'' a playlet about settling the affairs of an AIDS
victim by his ex-wife and his homosexual lover, took four awards. It
was named best dramatic special and Ms. Channing won as best
actress. Her co-star, ``Torch Song Trilogy'' creator Harvey
Fierstein, won an ACE for writing, and another went to the director.
   ``The Race for the Double Helix'' was selected best movie or
miniseries. Juliet Stevenson also won as best supporting actress in
a movie or miniseries.
   ``Blackadder the Third'' on A&amp;E Network was picked as best comedy
series. HBO's ``On Location: Dennis Miller: Mr. Miller Goes to
Washington'' won as best comedy special.
   Crystal won as best actor in a comedy series for ``HBO Comedy
Hour Live: An All-Star Toast to the Improv.'' Williams was cited for
best performance in a comedy special for HBO's ``Comedy Relief
'87.'' Mason missed out for best performance but won as best writer
of a comedy special for HBO's ``On Location: Jackie Mason on
Broadway.''
   Billy Joel won as best performer in a music special for ``HBO
World Stage: Billy Joel Live from Leningrad.'' The show also won as
best music special.
   Daniel Massey was named best actor in a dramatic special for
``HBO Showcase: Intimate Contact.'' Rip Torn won as best supporting
actor in a movie or miniseries for HBO's ``Laguna Heat.''
   Peter Ustinov received an ACE as best informational or
documentary host for ``Peter Ustinov in China'' on the Discovery
Channel. Roy Firestone was named best sports host for ``Sports
Look'' on ESPN. Bernard Shaw of Cable News Network was named best
news anchor.
   Nearly 500 cable academy members and others in the production
community got to vote on the preliminary competition, which narrowed
the 1,214 entries to 324 finalists, and the final balloting. Votes
were tallied by an accounting firm. In addition to HBO's 35 awards
and A&amp;E's eight, here's how the other networks did: CNN five; Bravo
Cable Network, Discovery Channel, ESPN and Showtime four each;
Disney Channel three; Cinemax, Nickelodeon and USA Network two each;
and Lifetime, Prime Ticket and SuperStation TBS one each.
   HBO also received the ``Golden ACE,'' the cable industry's
highest honor, for its ``high impact'' programming. Its three
winning dramas were cited, as was ``Dear America: Letters Home from
Vietnam,'' which won an ACE as best dopcumentary special.
   Harry Anderson, star of NBC's ``Night Court'' and of cable comedy
specials, was host of the show at the Wiltern Theater. It was
produced by Moffitt-Lee Productions, whose ``Not Necessarily the
News'' on HBO has 13 ACEs over the years, the most for any show. The
awards presentation was carried live on 10 basic cable networks.
   Awards in the crafts and technical awards, and in some acting
categories, were made Saturday night at a dinner at the Beverly
Wilshire Hotel.
   The National Academy is a division of the National Cable
Television Association. It was created in 1985 to promote excellence
in cable programming. This past September, cable shows and
performers were included in the Emmy awards for the first time. The
cable industry said, however, that it would continue its own awards
program.
   The presentations were carried by Black Entertainment Television,
the CBN Family Channel, the Discovery Channel, Financial News
Network, Lifetime, Movietime, Nick at Nite, SuperStation TBS, Turner
Network Television, and USA Network.
   Nominations this year came from 24 cable programming networks, up
from 19 networks last year.

THE POP CHARTS WOULD HAVE MORE MEANING IF HIT MAKERS CHANNELED THEIR PASSION 
INTO THEIR MUSIC INSTEAD OF WHINING OVER BAD REVIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the bittersweet ironies of the current pop scene is that many of today's 
biggest sellers inject more passion into their interviews than into their 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Much of that passion, however, is wasted by the artists on complaints that 
critics dismiss their work for reasons that have almost nothing to do with 
music. 
</P>
<P>
Bad reviews, the artists maintain, are due to such extraneous issues as how 
much money they have or how carefully they groom their hair. 
</P>
<P>
The arguments are amusing on one level because they're so superficial, but they 
are symptoms of an unwillingness among many of our artists who consistently top 
the pop charts to face some issues undermining the quality of pop music in the 
'90s. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than document excellence in music these days, the pop charts all too 
often simply chronicle the conservative judgments of radio programmers and the 
success of marketing campaigns. That's the bittersweet reality of today's pop 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who lets these charts -- or radio -- serve as their guides to what they 
should be listening to is probably missing out on the most inspiring currents 
of pop music today. The fact that many of our top hit makers are among those 
who don't recognize this reality speaks to the depth of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
If they spent more time concentrating on their music and less time trying to 
rationalize why their music isn't more critically admired, we'd all be better 
off. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the big four of pop-star complaints: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1 -- Critics don't like me because of my hair. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Marx, who has had nine consecutive hit singles despite music that's 
colorless and almost totally void of revealing edges, blamed his bad press 
recently on his lushly sculpted hair. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have thick hair, which I think (upsets) a lot of bald critics," the pop 
singer told the Times' Steve Hochman in July, drawing attention to his long 
locks. 
</P>
<P>
"When I read bad reviews of me and when I read slams in the press, I don't ever 
read, 'He doesn't sing well' or 'He doesn't write melodic songs' or 'He doesn't 
work hard on stage or produce good records,' " he said. "I read, 'His hair's 
too perfect.' " 
</P>
<P>
If Marx had indeed stumbled upon a truism in pop, Don Henley and John 
Mellencamp, among others, would be the targets of every critic in the country. 
Henley's hair was so self-consciously long on the last tour that he spent half 
his time on stage brushing it out of his eyes, yet Henley is among the most 
admired figures in pop. Ditto for Mellencamp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 -- Critics don't like me because I'm rich. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Collins was upset earlier this year because so many critics have 
maintained that Collins, one of pop's biggest sellers in the '80s even though 
his music tends to lack invention and fiber, is unconvincing when he sings 
about such social issues as the homeless and racism in his latest album, ". . . 
But Seriously Folks." 
</P>
<P>
In a January interview with The Times' Dennis Hunt, Collins blamed the response 
on his comfortable financial status. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're rich, people assume you're an insensitive jerk who's out of touch," 
Collins said. "But there's some decent rich people too. Having money doesn't 
turn you into a jerk. If those critics knew me, they wouldn't be making rash 
assumptions about me. I'm rich, but I'm not a bad guy." 
</P>
<P>
That's certainly more biting than anything Collins has put on record in years. 
The problem with Collins' argument is that it ignores the fact that some of the 
most commercially successful pop artists -- including Bruce Springsteen, 
Prince, U2 and Stevie Wonder -- are praised by critics for their social 
commentary. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that there's more conviction and character in their music. 
Collins may care as deeply about social issues, but he surrounded his views in 
the album with such gentle, unthreatening pop strains that many listeners no 
doubt didn't even realize the songs are supposed to be social laments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3 -- Critics don't like me because they don't think I'm rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Joel has complained repeatedly that one reason he's not better 
appreciated by critics is that the writers tend to be rock fans and they don't 
see him as a legitimate rocker. 
</P>
<P>
Raising the point again in Rolling Stone magazine last January, Joel said: "Me, 
I've had a . . . war with the press going on forever, and that's one war you 
cannot win. . . . They don't see me as this authentic rock 'n' roller. . . . I 
never pretended to be one." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, if pop critics truly couldn't see past rock, why are Randy Newman, Paul 
Simon and Tom Waits so widely acclaimed? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4 -- Critics don't like me because I'm too popular. 
</P>
<P>
The argument here is that critics are snobs who only like struggling or unknown 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
Collins -- here's that guy again -- employed this reasoning in a recent letter 
to my colleague Chris Willman, who had reviewed a Collins performance at the 
Forum. Willman called the singer-songwriter a pop underachiever -- a gifted 
musician who sacrifices some of his artistic potential in order to connect with 
the masses. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Collins said: "Critics like you assume a holier than thou 
position (and feel) . . . if it's a 'hit' its gotta be cheap . . . and written 
for the lowest common denominator." 
</P>
<P>
The populist stance is no more true than the first three defenses, but it 
deserves more attention because it is probably the one defense most voiced by 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints that critics don't like anything that is popular aren't leveled only 
by defensive artists. Pop fans, too, often raise it. 
</P>
<P>
These fans expect critics to write about and praise successful acts, but they 
often think critics are being self-indulgent or playing favorites when they 
applaud unknown artists or someone whose style is perceived by the mainstream 
listener to be extreme -- punk in the late '70s or rap in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
If a record's any good, it's going to be a hit, right? 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
It was possible once to write only about hits and touch on the most vital 
strains in pop music, but no longer. 
</P>
<P>
There were lots of mediocre hit makers in the '50s and '60s -- from Pat Boone 
and the Crew-Cuts to Bobby Vee and Tommy Roe. But the Top 10 was also filled 
those years with the works of such gifted figures as Elvis Presley, Little 
Richard, Buddy Holly, the Beatles, Bob Dylan, Creedence Clearwater Revival, 
Marvin Gaye, the Byrds and the Beach Boys. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the '70s that the pop charts began to be dominated by the 
mediocre -- no longer reflecting the brightest and the best of modern pop 
music. The primary reason is that rock-oriented radio stations -- in seeking 
the widest possible audience -- began avoiding artists with the radical and 
adventurous edges. 
</P>
<P>
If this meant that discriminating pop fans could no longer count on the radio 
-- or at least top-rated stations, as opposed to college and alternative 
stations -- as the main guide to stimulating new music, it didn't mean that 
critics or fans couldn't sometimes find brilliant work in the Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
A look at the results of the Village Voice's annual poll of the nation's 
leading pop critics over the years shows that many best-sellers have been 
wildly acclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Village Voice poll is fairly characteristic of the balance these days 
between commercial and relatively unknown on critics' lists. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen of the 40 best albums of 1989 sold 500,000 or more albums -- enough to 
qualify as gold. Among the artists: De La Soul (the New York rap group that 
topped the poll), Madonna, Janet Jackson, Tracy Chapman, Don Henley, Soul II 
Soul, the Fine Young Cannibals and the Cure. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than Collins, Marx, New Kids on the Block, Paul Abdul, Bon Jovi, Milli 
Vanilli, Skid Row, Debbie Gibson, Poison, Warrant, Winger, Great White, Kenny 
G, White Lion and other meaningless best-sellers from 1989, the Voice poll 
saluted such commercial underdogs as the Neville Brothers, the Mekons, the 
Pixies, the Replacements and Lyle Lovett. 
</P>
<P>
The reason the latter artists were favored over the best-sellers by critics had 
nothing to do with haircuts, bank accounts or image, but music. Those artists 
on the Voice poll reflect more of the personal vision that has helped expand 
the social and artistic boundaries of pop music over the last 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
To maximize their talent, Marx, Joel and Collins need to stop swinging at straw 
men and realize the problem is within. To improving their pop-music diet, pop 
audiences too must stop depending on what is on the pop charts. 
</P>
<P>
Even Marx, Joel and Collins must shudder at an album Top 10 this week that 
includes M.C. Hammer, Wilson Phillips, New Kids on the Block, Poison, Keith 
Sweat and the "Pretty Woman" sound track.

Rock star Billy Joel, who signed a contract as a young musician that gave away 
his rights to his early songs, gives this advice to newcomers in the field: 
"Get a lawyer . . . then hire another lawyer to watch the first lawyer. There's 
a great deal of dishonesty and greed, and musicians tend to be naive about this 
business." Joel made the comment during an appearance at a master class at Long

   Ex-Beatle Paul McCartney opened his first
foreign tour in 13 years at a community hall in this out-of-the-way
city south of Oslo.
   With 6,000 fans shouting, ``We want Paul,'' McCartney took to
the stage Tuesday evening with his wife, Linda, and a tour band.
   The concert, which kicked off a four-month European tour,
included a heavy dose of Beatles songs. The two-hour show began
with ``Figure of Eight'' from McCartney's latest album, ``Flowers
in the Dirt,'' and ended with a medley from the Beatles album
``Abbey Road,'' released 20 years ago.
   ``It isn't everyday I know all the words to all the songs at a
concert,'' said Sigbjoern Nedland, a music critic. ``It surpassed
my expectations by 150 percent.''
   Before the show, one Oslo newspaper dubbed McCartney ``Nervous
Paul'' because only Norway's domestic media was invited. Uni
Arnesen of EMI Records, said foreign news organizations were kept
out because McCartney wanted to warm up ``off Broadway,'' as he put
it when the tour was announced in July.
   The singer embraced the environment as the tour's theme and
distributed pamphlets from the group Friends of the Earth. ``At the
end of the tour it would be nice to look back and see that it meant
something,'' McCartney said.

   Poland's two living Nobel Prize recipients
held a warm reunion, with Peace Prize laureate Lech Walesa saying
the works of literary winner Czeslaw Milosz ``shaped me and a whole
generation.''
   Milosz, the poet-essayist who won his Nobel in 1980 after having
fled Poland in the 1950s, has long been a supporter of Walesa and
critic of communist cultural controls. His books were banned
throughout the East bloc but in recent years became available in
Poland and several other countries.
   ``I was in jail several times for (the ideas contained in) Mr.
Czeslaw Milosz's books,'' Walesa said Tuesday.
   The two first met in Poland in 1981, during Solidarity's first
brief 16-month legal existence that preceded a martial-law
crackdown. Walesa received his Nobel two years later.
   Solidarity now sits in the prime minister's office.
   ``It is good fortune to live until this moment,'' said Milosz,
who lives in Berkeley, Calif., and is visiting Poland for only the
second time since emigrating.

   ``Of all the issues one can get involved in, I think the rain
forest issue is the one that clearly spells doom _ I mean for the
entire planet,'' Weir said Tuesday. ``If they go, we go.''
   ``Earth Train 1990'' is scheduled to carry more than 600
students, teachers and activists from around the world on a
weeklong trip from San Francisco to Washington, D.C., next April to
dramatize the dangers to the environment posed by deforestation.
After the trip, the group plans to go to New York to make a

   Singer Billy Joel is doing fine after doctors
operated to remove a kidney stone, according to his wife, model
Christie Brinkley.
   ``The kidney stone came out today, his new single will be coming
out tomorrow, his new album ``Storm King'' will be out Oct. 17,''
Brinkley said in a statement Tuesday.
   The singer was about to board a flight to London on Sunday when
he was struck with severe abdominal pains, said his spokeswoman,
Elaine Schock.
   Joel should be released from the hospital soon, Schock said, but
he will postpone his trip for four weeks to promote his new album.
She didn't identify the hospital.
   On Monday, Joel filed a $90 million lawsuit against his former
brother-in-law and manager, alleging the loss of millions of
dollars because of theft and risky investments.

   Comedian Red Skelton attracted crowds
when he went shopping at a K mart to before a weekend show in this
southeastern Missouri town.
   Skelton picked up three dozen pairs of socks _ buying them is
cheaper than having them laundered on the road, he said. He also
went to a mall and an art store Monday to buy oil paint and colored
pencils for sketching, stopping to sign autographs and shake hands
with shoppers.
   ``I like to come into town early and get into the cadence of the
town,'' the 76-year-old comic said. ``I like people. I like going

   Former Temptations lead singer David Ruffin was
ordered to check into a drug treatment program instead of a jail
for violating probation on a drug conviction.
   Judge John O'Brien on Tuesday ordered Ruffin to spend the next
28 days in a New York drug treatment center, after which his
probation would be considered completed.
   Ruffin, 48, had spent Monday night in Wayne County Jail after
showing up five hours late for a court appearance. He was sentenced
to two years' probation, drug testing and treatment after his May
1988 conviction for misdemeanor possession of cocaine.
   Ruffin was arrested last week after testing positive for opiates.

Singer-songwriter Billy Joel, who was honored recently as one of four music 
legends of the past two decades, has revealed that he attempted to end his life 
not once, but twice, at the age of 20 or 21. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt the last thing the world needed was another failed itinerant musician, 
so I popped a bunch of pills," Joel told Parade magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't work, so I tried again by swallowing furniture polish. 
</P>
<P>
"Again, it wasn't fatal, but I checked into the hospital. . . . It was the best 
thing I ever did. I stayed there three weeks and saw all these people with 
profound emotional and mental problems. It was a great insight, because I 
realized my situation was nothing compared to theirs. I knew I'd never feel 
that sorry for myself again."

POP EYE: NASH CLIMBS INTO 'RING' AS A TV TALK-SHOW HOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Graham Nash has done it all -- he's been everything from a pop superstar to a 
political activist to David Crosby's baby-sitter. But a TV talk-show host? 
</P>
<P>
Nash makes his debut Dec. 17 on the Arts &amp; Entertainment cable network 
(A&amp;E), where the politically active pop star will host a planned series of 
one-hour programs tentatively titled "The Ring." Produced by DIR Broadcasting 
and Dalrymple Productions, the shows will feature pop-star guests discussing 
social issues -- and performing favorite songs -- before a live, 
celebrity-studded audience. You might say DIR has run the gamut celebrity-wise: 
The debut program, with Nash interviewing Grace Slick, features appearances by 
Steve Garvey, Bonnie Raitt, Suzie Chaffee, Lamont Dozier and the head of the 
World Wildlife Fund. 
</P>
<P>
You also might say that Nash, despite his obvious enthusiasm, has mixed 
feelings about his new career path. "I'm not so sure whether I want to be this 
guy -- this talk-show character -- or not," he explained the other afternoon. 
"I have to admit that I was a little nervous, because in one way it made me 
feel like I was, well, getting old. 
</P>
<P>
"I was talking to David Crosby the other day and he told me, 'Stop looking at 
this as something you have to do because you're retired or something. It's just 
another career move, another facet of your personality.' " 
</P>
<P>
Nash laughed. "But still . . . it really is strange walking around an audience 
with a hand-mike, asking people all these crazy questions. I don't want anyone 
to think I'm Phil Donahue." 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry. Nash has no interest in tabloid-TV journalism. "I've always 
thought there were lots of musicians who really have something to say, but the 
problem with most TV shows is that you simply come on, sing a song, sit on the 
couch for five minutes plugging your new record and you're gone," he said. 
"We'd like to give musicians a chance to talk about things in depth. I'd like 
to have people on like Sting, who could discuss the rain forests, or Peter 
Gabriel or Midnight Oil or Stevie Wonder, who's a social activist of the 
highest order." 
</P>
<P>
An offspring of glasnost, the show was inspired by a Soviet talk show called 
"The Ring," which had Billy Joel on as a guest when he was touring Russia 
several years ago. "It was a truly unusual program," recalled DIR president Bob 
Meyerowitz, who was there handling a live Joel simulcast. "It was a heavy, very 
intellectual show. The audience was full of Politburo members and Communist 
Party functionaries, who would all ask Billy questions. He didn't know what to 
make of it when he went in, but he came out loving it." 
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with Robert Dalrymple, DIR has Americanized the show, but they 
plan to stock each segment with provocative audience participants. A recently 
taped show, with special guest David Crosby, features appearances from a 
National Rifle Assn. exec and a woman whose son was recently killed with a 
handgun. Nash's guests will also perform -- Nash got Slick and Crosby together 
for an acoustic version of "Wooden Ships." 
</P>
<P>
According to Meyerowitz, A&amp;E is still waiting to see the final version of 
the two initial pilots before making a commitment, but DIR is hoping for an 
initial run of 13 hourlong shows. Meyerowitz insists that Nash was an obvious 
choice as host. "I'd heard him do a radio show a few years ago and he was 
tremendous," he said. "He's exactly what we needed -- someone who will command 
the respect of his guests." 
</P>
<P>
Nash is still a little nervous. "When we taped the first show, I was 
terrified," he said. "Put a guitar in front of me and I can keep going for 
days. But it was scary when I had to just go out by myself in front of an 
audience. So I just try to read up on my guests as much as possible. For Grace, 
I studied all sorts of articles and books." 
</P>
<P>
And for David Crosby, whom Nash has performed with for two decades? "With 
David?" he laughed. "I knew all I could ever possibly want to know!"

   Home Box Office swept the cable industry's
10th Annual ACE Awards on the strength of a trio of dramas that
captured 13 of the cable network's 35 awards.
   HBO won four times more awards than its nearest competitor: Arts
&amp; Entertainment, which won eight. The ACE awards were presented
during ceremonies Sunday sponsored by the National Academy of Cable
programming.
   HBO's winning dramas were ``Vietnam War Story,'' ``Mandela'' and
``Tidy Endings.'' In all, HBO had received 114 nominations in the 76
categories for which prizes were given.
   Winning performers included Danny Glover, Alfre Woodard, Stockard
Channing, Rip Torn, Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Billy Joel.
Lucy Webb received a fourth consecutive ACE as best actress in a
comedy series for HBO's ``Not Necessarily the News.''
   Other winning networks were: CNN five; Bravo Cable Network,
Discovery Channel, ESPN and Showtime four each; Disney Channel
three; Cinemax, Nickelodeon and USA Network two; and Lifetime, Prime
Ticket and SuperStation TBS one each.
   ``Vietnam War Story,'' a 30-minute anthology series, won five
awards out of its 18 nominations, the most of any show. It was named
best dramatic series and Wesley Snipes won as best actor. Other ACEs
in the dramatic series category were for directing, writing and
direction of photography.
   Glover and Miss Woodard were cited as best actor and actress in a
movie or miniseries for their roles as South African black activists
in ``Mandela,'' which got four ACEs in the movie or miniseries
categories. Glover played Nelson Mandela, imprisoned founder of the
African National Congress, and Miss Woodard was his wife, Winnie
Mandela. The drama also won for directing and film editing.
   ``Tidy Endings,'' adapted from Harvey Fierstein's play about
settling the affairs of an AIDS victim by his ex-wife and homosexual
lover, took four awards. It was named best dramatic special and Miss
Channing won as best actress in a dramatic or theatrical special.
Fierstein, her co-star, won an ACE for writing and another went to
the director.
   ``The Race for the Double Helix'' won best movie or miniseries.
Juliet Stevenson also won as best supporting actress in a movie or
miniseries. ``Blackadder the Third'' on A&amp;E Network was named best
comedy series. HBO's ``On Location: Dennis Miller: Mr. Miller Goes
to Washington'' won as best comedy special.
   Pamela Reed won best actress in a dramatic series for HBO's
``Tanner '88.'' Crystal was cited as best actor in a comedy series
for ``HBO Comedy Hour Live: An All-Star Toast to the Improv.''
Jackie Mason won as best writer of a comedy special for HBO's ``On
Location: Jackie Mason on Broadway,'' but lost the best performance
title to Williams for HBO's ``Comic Relief '87.''
   Joel won as best performer in a music special for ``HBO World
Stage: Billy Joel Live from Leningrad.'' The show was named best
music special.
   Daniel Massey won as best actor in a dramatic special for ``HBO
Showcase: Intimate Contact.'' Torn was the winner as best supporting
actor in a movie or miniseries for HBO's ``Laguna Heat.''
   Peter Ustinov received an ACE as best informational or
documentary host for ``Peter Ustinov in China'' on the Discovery
Channel. Roy Firestone was best sports host for ``Sports Look'' on
ESPN. Bernard Shaw of Cable News Network was named best news anchor.
   HBO won the ``Golden Ace,'' the cable industry's highest honor
for its ``high impact'' programming. Its three winning dramas were
cited, as was ``Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam,'' winner
for documentary special.
   The Governor's Award went to Charles F. Dolan, chairman of
Cablevision Systems Corp., for his contribution to the development
of cable programming.
   Harry Anderson, star of NBC's ``Night Court'' and of cable comedy
specials, was host of the awards presentation, which was carried
live on 10 cable networks.
   Awards in the crafts and technical awards, and in some acting
categories, were made Saturday night.
   The National Academy is a division of the National Cable
Television Association. It was created in 1985 to promote excellence
in cable programming. In September, cable shows and performers were
included in the Emmy awards for the first time. The cable industry
said, however, that it would continue its own awards program.
