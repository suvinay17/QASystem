   Oscar-winning composer Sammy Fain, whose
classic love ballads included ``Love is a Many Splendored Thing''
and ``I'll be Seeing You,'' has died of a heart attack. He was 87.
   Fain, who was nominated for 10 Academy Awards and won two, died
Wednesday at the UCLA Medical Center, said Ken Sunshine, a
publicist for the American Society of Composers, Authors and
Publishers.
   During a career that stretched from New York's Tin Pan Alley to
Broadway and Hollywood, Fain wrote some of America's most memorable
pop hits.
   Many Fain titles bring instant recognition: ``Secret Love,''
``Let A Smile Be Your Umbrella,'' ``Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up
That Old Gang of Mine'' and ``Tender is the Night'' among them.
   `` `I'll Be Seeing You' _ just think of how often we say that.
But when you say it a certain way, it means something very deep,''
ASCAP President Morton Gould said of the World War II song. ``It's
hard for me to believe I won't be seeing him anymore. He was such a
sweet person, such a gentle person.''
   Sammy Cahn, a decades-long colleague and collaborator, said his
friend leaves ``not just a few but a staggering medley of hits,
songs that are readily identifiable to everyone.''
   He added: ``You know, old songwriters never really die because
their songs keep them alive forever.''
   Fain's collaborators included lyricists Cahn, Irving Kahal, Bob
Hilliard, Harold Adamson, Lew Brown, Paul Francis Webster, Mitchell
Parish, E.Y. Harburg, and Alan and Marilyn Bergman.
   ``Sammy didn't study at Juilliard. He played the piano by ear.
He was self-taught, but he wrote some of the most beautiful
standard melodies,'' said Parish in a telephone interview from New
York.
   The two men wrote ``You're So Indifferent'' for Lena Horne and
another tune, ``In a Little French Cafe.''
   ``When a writer sat down in those days to write a song, he
didn't sit down to write a standard,'' Parish said. ``We wrote
songs that we felt inside of our hearts _ to have people sing and
dance to, and for kids to whistle in the streets.
   ``Workmen, whatever they were doing, would be singing strains of
our songs ... That explains why these songs are still alive.''
   Fain won Oscars for the title tune from the 1955 movie ``Love Is
a Many Splendored Thing'' and in 1953 for ``Secret Love'' from the
Doris Day film ``Calamity Jane.''
   Born Samuel Feinberg in New York on June 17, 1902, Fain was a
piano prodigy who unsuccessfully worked Tin Pan Alley until teaming
with Kahal for their first hit, ``Nobody Knows What A Red-Headed
Mama Can Do.''
   He went to Hollywood to work in early musical films, including
``Dames,'' ``Footlight Parade,'' and ``Goin' to Town,'' then
returned to Broadway and wrote songs for the smash 1938 review
``Hellzapoppin.''
   Two songs from a failed Fain musical that year, ``I'll Be Seeing
You'' and ``I Can Dream, Can't I,'' later became wartime classics.
The latter was recorded by the Andrews Sisters.
   Back in Hollywood after the war, Fain and Hilliard wrote the
songs for Walt Disney's ``Alice In Wonderland,'' including the tune
``I'm Late.''
   He also joined with Cahn to write the score for Disney's ``Peter
Pan,'' which included the tune ``Second Star to the Right,'' and
wrote music for Disney's ``The Rescuers'' in 1977.
   Fain is survived by a son, Frank, of New York.

   Composer Sammy Fain, a two-time Academy Award
winner who wrote ``Love Is a Many Splendored Thing'' and ``I'll Be
Seeing You,'' died Wednesday. He was 87.
   Fain died of a heart attack at UCLA Medical Center, said Ken
Sunshine, a publicist for the American Society of Composers,

   During a career that stretched from New York's Tin Pan Alley to
Broadway and Hollywood, Fain wrote some of the most enduring pop
hits of American music this century.
   His collaborators over the years included lyricists Irving
Kahal, Bob Hilliard, Paul Francis Webster, Sammy Cahn, E.Y. Hapburg
and Alan and Marilyn Bergman.
   Many Fain titles bring instant tune recognition: ``That Old
Feeling,'' ``Let a Smile Be Your Umbrella,'' ``I'll Be Seeing
You,'' ``Wedding Bells are Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine'' and
``Tender Is the Night'' among them.
   Fain won his Academy Awards for best song, in the title for the
1955 film ``Love Is a Many Splendored Thing,'' and in 1953 for
``Secret Love'' from the Doris Day film ``Calamity Jane.'' Fain was
nominated for Oscars nine times during his career.
   He was born Samuel Feinberg in New York City on June 17, 1902. A
piano prodigy, he unsuccessfully worked Tin Pan Alley until teaming
with lyricist Kahal for their first hit ``Nobody Knows What a

   Fain also joined with Cahn to write the score for Disney's
``Peter Pan.'' After winning his ``Secret Love'' Oscar, Fain
collaborated to write the theme songs for several movies besides
the second Academy Award winner ``Love Is a Many Splendored Thing.''
   Those included ``A Certain Smile,'' ``April Love,'' ``The Gift
of Love'' and ``Tender Is the Night.''
   Fain was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1971 and
was presented earlier this year with a special award from ASCAP for
his lifetime achievement of writing popular music.
   He is survived by a son, Frank, of New York. Funeral
arrangements were pending.

   Academy Award-winning composer Sammy Fain,
who wrote such enduring tunes as ``Love Is a Many Splendored
Thing,'' ``That Old Feeling'' and the wartime classic ``I'll Be
Seeing You,'' died Wednesday. He was 87.
   The two-time Oscar recipient, who suffered a heart attack, was
at the UCLA Medical Center when he died, said Ken Sunshine, a
publicist for the American Society of Composers, Authors and
Publishers.
   During a career that stretched from New York's Tin Pan Alley to
Broadway and Hollywood, Fain wrote some of the most memorable pop
hits of American music this century.
   Many Fain titles bring instant tune recognition: ``Let A Smile
Be Your Umbrella,'' ``I'll Be Seeing You,'' ``Wedding Bells Are
Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine'' and ``Tender is the Night''
among them.
   ```I'll Be Seeing You' _ just think of how often we say that.
But when you say it a certain way, it means something very deep,''
said ASCAP President Morton Gould of the World War II song.
   ``It's hard for me to believe I won't be seeing him anymore. He
was such a sweet person, such a gentle person,'' Gould said.
   Fain's collaborators over the years included lyricists Irving
Kahal, Bob Hilliard, Harold Adamson, Lew Brown, Paul Francis
Webster, Mitchell Parish, Sammy Cahn, E.Y. Hapburg, and Alan and
Marilyn Bergman.
   ``Sammy didn't study at Juilliard. He played the piano by ear.
He was self-taught, but he wrote some of the most beautiful

from New York.

they were doing, would be singing strains of our songs. ... That
explains why these songs are still alive.''
   Fain was nominated for 10 Academy Awards during his long career.
He won for best song for the title tune from the 1955 movie ``Love
Is a Many Splendored Thing'' and in 1953 for ``Secret Love'' from
the Doris Day film ``Calamity Jane.''
   Known for a self-effacing style, Fain's modesty even extended to
Academy Award politics. When he had a little-heard 1976
Oscar-nominated song, ``A World That Never Was,'' from a
little-seen movie called ``Half a House,'' he said in a trade paper
advertisement: ``It would be nice if we had a commercial record,
but we don't. It would also be nice if we were in a widely seen
motion picture, but we don't have that, either.''
   To make up for those shortcomings, Fain provided a
``Dial-a-Song'' phone number so Academy voters could hear his song.
But the award went to ``Evergreen'' that year.
   Born Samuel Feinberg in New York City on June 17, 1902, Fain was
a piano prodigy who unsuccessfully worked Tin Pan Alley until
teaming with lyricist Kahal for their first hit, ``Nobody Knows
What A Red-Headed Mama Can Do.''
   He went to Hollywood to work in early musical films, including
``Dames,'' ``Footlight Parade,'' and ``Goin' to Town,'' then

   Fain was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1971 and
was presented earlier this year with a special award from ASCAP for
lifetime achievement.
   He had been a member of the ASCAP board of directors for the
past 10 years.
   He is survived by a son, Frank, of New York. Funeral
arrangements were pending.

OSCAR-WINNING SONGWRITER SAMMY FAIN DIES AT AGE 87 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sammy Fain, among the last of that select breed of tunesmiths who peddled their 
songs from the backs of trucks and in the dingy hallways of New York City's 
legendary Tin Pan Alley, died Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The two-time Academy Award-winning songwriter (for "Love Is a Many Splendored 
Thing" and "Secret Love") was 87 when he died of a heart attack at UCLA Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Prolific and pleasant, Fain kept at his piano until shortly before his death, 
adding to a library of song that brought him admission to the Songwriters Hall 
of Fame in 1971. His dozens of tunes, many of them for films, included such 
evergreen melodies as "I'll Be Seeing You," "Katie," "Let a Smile Be Your 
Umbrella," "Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine," "I Can Dream, 
Can't I?," "Dear Hearts and Gentle People," "You Brought a New Kind of Love to 
Me" and "When I Take My Sugar to Tea." 
</P>
<P>
Films he scored or wrote for include "Footlight Parade," "Hellzapoppin," "I'll 
Be Seeing You," "Anchors Aweigh," "Alice in Wonderland," "Calamity Jane," "Love 
Is a Many Splendored Thing," "A Certain Smile," "Tender Is the Night," "Myra 
Breckinridge," "The Rescuers" and others. 
</P>
<P>
In all, he was nominated for nine Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
He also collaborated on four Broadway musicals in the 1950s and 1960s, 
including "Flahooley," "Ankles Aweigh" (revived in 1988), "Christine" and 
"Something More." 
</P>
<P>
Born Samuel Feinberg in New York City, he attended school there and taught 
himself the piano and composition as a youth. 
</P>
<P>
Fain became part of a unique group of early 20th-Century American songwriters 
such as Irving Berlin who were gifted with an abundant talent for simple 
melodies that remained popular decades after the tunes first were heard. 
</P>
<P>
While his success wasn't instantaneous (he worked for several Tin Pan Alley 
song publishers before establishing an independent reputation), it proved 
lasting. 
</P>
<P>
His collaboration with lyricist Irving Kahal produced the first of his hits, 
"Nobody Knows What a Redheaded Momma Can Do." 
</P>
<P>
With Kahal he also wrote "Let a Smile Be Your Umbrella," "Wedding Bells Are 
Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine" and "When I Take My Sugar to Tea," all 
immensely popular hits. 
</P>
<P>
His other lyricists over the years included Bob Hilliard, Paul Francis Webster, 
Sammy Cahn, E. Y. Harburg and Alan and Marilyn Bergman. 
</P>
<P>
Fain came to Hollywood as one of the country's rising young composers in the 
early days of sound films when producers were grinding out musicals with 
abandon. 
</P>
<P>
His first recorded film credit was "It's a Great Life" in 1929 and his last was 
"The Rescuers" in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote songs for Dick Powell ("By a Waterfall"), Mae West ("Now I'm a Lady") 
and Maurice Chevalier ("You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me.") 
</P>
<P>
He and Kahal were reunited on Broadway in 1938 for a long-forgotten flop called 
"Right This Way" but the score contained two of Fain's greatest songs, "I'll Be 
Seeing You" and "I Can Dream, Can't I?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'll Be Seeing You" was used as a signature song by the cabaret singer 
Hildegarde throughout her career while "I Can Dream, Can't I?" was a wartime 
hit for the Andrews Sisters. 
</P>
<P>
In the last several years Fain could be seen about Los Angeles playing for 
former radio or film stars or fellow songwriters at their various meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Frail but enthusiastic, he dressed in the latest styles and would offer up his 
long-ago melodies in a reedy, infectious voice and always with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
His awards included several from foreign governments, including Italy and 
France. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year he was presented a special award from the American Society of 
Composers, Authors and Publishers for being "one of America's premier composers 
of popular songs." 
</P>
<P>
Sammy Cahn, a decades-long colleague and collaborator with Fain on "Peter Pan" 
and its enduring song "You Can Fly, You Can Fly, You Can Fly," said his old 
friend leaves "not just a few but a staggering medley of hits, songs that are 
readily identifiable to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
And then he added, "You know, old songwriters never really die because their 
songs keep them alive forever." 
</P>
<P>
Fain is survived by a son, Frank, of New York City. Funeral arrangements were 
pending.

   People recognize the melodies if not the man
behind the music:
   ``I Can Dream, Can't I?'', ``I'll Be Seeing You,'' ``Dear Hearts
and Gentle People,'' ``Let a Smile Be Your Umbrella,'' ``That Old
Feeling,'' ``By a Waterfall,'' ``When I Take My Sugar to Tea,''
``Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine.''
   These and scores of other songs are the life's work of Sammy
Fain.
   At 86, Fain is one of the last of a breed of songwriters who
wrote their way from Tin Pan Alley to Broadway to Hollywood during
the golden days between the two World Wars. Give them a job and
they'd write a song _ fast.
   ``You know, you'd get an assignment on Monday,'' Fain says
matter-of-factly, ``and they'd be rehearsing the orchestra by
Thursday. It's one of those things.''
   If his name isn't as well-known as a Rodgers, Gershwin, Porter
or Berlin, it may be because he never had a big Broadway musical,
although Fain did write the music for ``Hellzapoppin,'' the
long-running vaudeville escapade remembered more for the antics of
comics Ole Olson and Chic Johnson than its songs.
   The success that eluded Fain on Broadway was found in Hollywood:
dozens of film assignments, 10 Academy Award nominations and two
best-song Oscars for ``Secret Love'' and ``Love Is a Many
Splendored Thing.''
   Now theatergoers have a chance to sample a Fain rarity, ``Ankles
Aweigh,'' a 1955 Broadway musical that had nothing more on its mind
than gags, girls and a good time.
   The show is on view at the Goodspeed Opera House, that
ginger-box musical museum in East Haddam, Conn., best known as the
birthplace of ``Annie'' and for its sterling revivals of vintage
musicals from the 1920s and '30s. It will run through Sept. 30.
   A new book has been written for the musical by Charles Busch,
author and star of the long-running off-Broadway hit, ``Vampire
Lesbians of Sodom.'' Busch's revamped plot, still set in the 1950s,
had something to do with Hollywood starlets, the U.S. Navy, Italy
and a secret code coveted by the Russians.
   ```Ankles Aweigh' is an old-fashioned show,'' Fain said the
other day during a visit to the headquarters of the American
Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. ``It's got a lot of
good rhythmic tunes and ballads which I like to do.''
   Fain, whose family lived in New York, was born into music. His
father was a cantor. His older brother played violin in Broadway
pit orchestras. His cousin was Willie Howard, the great sad-faced
comedian.
   ``Every winter I would get pneumonia,'' Fain recalls, so the
family eventually moved from the city to the Catskills.
   ``Living up in the country, all I had was the piano,'' says
Fain, who taught himself to play and to write his own music. ``I
had a rather interesting little alto voice. I'd just get up and
sing my own material.''
   After high school, singing brought him back to New York and a
job as a staff pianist with Jack Mills who ran a music publishing
company.
   ``They hired me to demonstrate and teach their songs to all the
performing artists,'' Fain says. ``I would sell the songs to big
performers. It helped me learn to play in every key.''
   He also performed in vaudeville and on radio as part of an act
called Dunn and Fain. But he never stopping writing. His first hit
song, with lyrics by Al Dubin, was published in 1925. It's title
was ``Nobody Knows What a Redhead Mama Can Do,'' and Fain was on
his way.
   Two years later he teamed up with Irving Kahal, a young
vaudeville performer and writer. Their partnership took them to
Hollywood and back again to Broadway and lasted until Kahal died in
1942.
   In California, Fain and Kahal contributed songs to such movie
musical classics as ``Footlight Parade'' and ``Dames.'' The songs
they wrote during those days were sweet and saucy with titles like
``Two Little Flies on a Lump of Sugar'' and ``When You Were a Smile
on Your Mother's Lips (And a Twinkle in Your Daddy's Eye).''
   ``A good title is an incentive to me,'' Fain says. ``I'll change
my melody if I hear a good line. I'm not stubborn about it. That's
collaboration.''
   And Fain has worked with some of the best word men in the
business. Besides Kahal, his lyricists have included Al Dubin, Jack
Yellen, E.Y. Harburg, Mitchell Parish, Joe Young, Lew Brown, Ralph
Freed and Paul Francis Webster.
   ``When I play a good tune for a lyricist, it gives him some
construction,'' Fain says. ``Music can lead you to a different
construction and sometimes a good lyricist likes that. It gives
them a chance to dig for a different kind of rhyme.''
   ``Ankles Aweigh,'' which has lyrics by Dan Shapiro, originally
ran in New York for six months. Besides ``Hellzapoppin'' and its
sequel, ``Sons o' Fun,'' it was one of Fain's longer running
Broadway shows.
   Many of his other musicals, such as ``Christine,'' ``Something
More'' and ``Toplitsky of Notre Dame,'' disappeared quickly.
``Flahooley,'' a 1951 Fain musical that starred Yma Sumac, Barbara
Cook and Bil Baird's Marionettes, has developed an almost legendary
reputation.
   The score, one of Fain's best, graced a witty and satirical book
by E.Y. Harburg that told the story of a laughing doll and its
effect on the big business of toy-making.
   ``That show was the talk of Philadelphia,'' said Fain, recalling
``Flahooley's'' triumphant out-of-town opening. Only New York
seemed unimpressed and the musical died after only 40 performances.
   ``It was a very unusual show,'' Fain sats. ``Someday, somebody
will revive `Flahooley' and it will be a hit.''
   If the shows weren't successful, much of the music was. Consider
two of Fain's biggest hit songs _ ``I Can Dream, Can't I?'' and
``I'll Be Seeing You.'' They somehow survived a 1938 flop called
``Right This Way'' that lasted two weeks on Broadway.
   Fain keeps writing today _ turning out new songs at his home in
Beverly Hills, Calif.
   ``I like to read the script,'' Fain says. ``That gives me an
idea for a melody. Many times, I play a certain little progression
and the lyricist will say `That's great.' If he doesn't like it,
I'll switch it around to fit a line. We help each other. That's the
way to work.''

<MEMO>  Theater  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     My reaction is much the same, too. This is a nice way to spend an evening.;
   A hero forever;  Sammy Cahn is one of my heroes. Anybody can worship Joe
Montana or Mel Gibson. Those icons will have their moment in the sun and
disappear, albeit with smiles. Sammy Cahn and the songs he wrote are forever,
and it's the public that keeps the smiles.;    Cahn jests a lot about his life
as a lyricist and wins laughs by pretending that writing words to music is
something of a lark. In one or two examples -- the Academy Award-winning hit
"Three Coins in the Fountain," for example -- he may have a point.;    But
Cahn wrote a whole catalog of lyrics that hang onto their wit and our hearts.
Here are a few: "Until the Real Thing Comes Along," "Love Is Lovelier the
Second Time Around," "A Pocketful of Miracles," "Love and Marriage," "All the
Way," "Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow," "A Touch of Class," "Saturday
Night Is the Loneliest Night of the Week," "(Kiss Me Once and Kiss Me Twice
and Kiss Me Once Again) It's Been a Long, Long Time.";    You want more? "High
Hopes," "Call Me Irresponsible," "The Tender Trap," "It Seems I've Heard That
Song Before.";    I've heard them all before, and, while Cahn's jests could
use a freshen-up, I'm never going to weary of the songs. Nor of the way he
sings them. The 78-year-old tummler (a make-happy guy at the Jewish resorts)
has just a wisp of a voice, but nobody sells a song better than a songwriter,
not when they've spent a lifetime at it.;    Cahn talks about his composer
collaborators -- people such as Saul Chaplin, Jimmy Van Heusen and Jule Styne.
He explains a lyric or two, including the line, "My heart will lose its mind"
from "Five Minutes More" that once mystified a film producer. He eulogizes the
De Castro Sisters for saving "Teach Me Tonight" from the ash can, tells jokes
about a stiff Doris Day and the operatic Mario Lanza.;    "I won't say I made
Frank Sinatra," Cahn grins, "but judge for yourself." And he belts -- OK,
pushes -- a handful of hits that, indeed, made Sinatra, including the best
city song ever written -- "My Kind of Town, Chicago Is." Where would Frankie
be without "All the Way"? Then again, Cahn made a few shekels on the deal,
too.;    Cahn dances through "Thoroughly Modern Millie," with its intricate
rhymes. "It won two gold medals and financed my second marriage.";    He tells
us that "Bei Mir Bist Du Shoen" is his favorite song because, finally, his
(Yiddish-speaking) mama could understand what her Sammy did for a living. But
Cahn, strangely, leaves out the name of the songwriters who created that song
in its Yiddish form, including the title, which Cahn adapted and the Andrew
Sisters immortalized. That was composer Sholem Secunda. Jacob Jacobs wrote the
Yiddish lyric.;    By the way, Cahn used to say that "Call Me Irresponsible"
was his favorite song. I won't hold him to it.;    Cahn appears not to be
getting any older. He still moves pretty well for a skinny, bald
septuagenarian, and, by the way, when he went through the audience shaking
hands and making jokes, he kidded a bald head that may have been sitting on my
shoulders. For shame.;    Cahn also kids himself, singing parody lyrics: "This
is my first affair/ So what goes where?" And Cahn tells us, "I never had to be
inspired to write. Just paid.";    Strong help; Cahn is ably abetted by a trio
of performers: Jordan Bennett, a big-voiced tenor; Linda Lloyd, a steamy
belter, whose "Until the Real Thing Comes Along" stops the show; and Shawn
Daywalt, a somewhat priggish soprano who sings better than she moves. You may
remember Bennett as Che in "Evita" for the San Jose Civic Light Opera. Harper
MacKay, on the piano again, has his usual droll fun.;    Cahn tells us that if
he had been born 13 years earlier, he might have been George Burns. I detected
a note of envy.;    I, on the other hand, am jealous of Cahn. I gave up
lyric-writing for journalism, never suspecting that clips get yellow, while
songs go on forever. As does Sammy Cahn. This man wrote "Time After Time."

<TEXT>
   Pop singer Stevie Wonder's Academy
Award-winning song ``I Just Called To Say I Love You'' was written
by two other people and stolen by Wonder after it was played for
him, a lawyer charged.
   Songwriter Lloyd Chiate, 40, claims he and collaborator Lee
Garrett wrote the song in the 1970s and titled it ``I Just Called
To Say.'' Wonder says he wrote the song himself before the pair
composed their song.
   Wonder, who was born Steveland Morris, is being sued in federal
court for alleged copyright infringement by Chiate.
   ``We are going to prove to you that Mr. Morris took the song
written by Mr. Chiate and Mr. Garrett for his own benefit ... and
Mr. Chiate received nothing,'' attorney Herbert Dodell said
Wednesday in opening statements as Wonder sat in the courtroom.
   But Wonder's attorney, Howard King, said the pop star wrote the
song's chorus on July 16, 1976, as he returned from a visit with
his mother in the San Fernando Valley, before Chiate and Garret
ever met.
   He said Wonder completed the song in 1984 after hearing part of
the soundtrack to the film ``The Woman in Red.''
   King added that Garrett, who dropped out as a plaintiff in the
case, has acknowledged that Wonder actually wrote the song.

   Oscar-winning songwriter Jimmy Van
Heusen, who wrote such tunes as ``All the Way,'' ``Love and
Marriage'' and ``High Hopes,'' was remembered upon his death as one
of pop music's most important composers.
   Van Heusen died of a stroke Tuesday night at his desert home
east of Los Angeles, according to a spokesman at the Riverside
County Coroner's Office. He was 77.
   Van Heusen collaborated with such lyricists as Johnny Mercer,
Johnny Burke, Eddie DeLange and most notably, Sammy Cahn. He also
wrote for Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra.
   ``Jimmy Van Heusen was an architect of melody,'' Cahn said
Wednesday. ``When we were writing together, if I would ask him to
add even a grace note to the song, he would sit down and write a
whole new melody.''
   Van Heusen won Academy Awards with Cahn for ``All the Way'' in
1957; ``High Hopes'' in 1959; and ``Call Me Irresponsible'' in
1963. ``High Hopes'' was chosen as the official song for John F.
Kennedy's presidential campaign.
   He and Johnny Burke also won an Oscar for ``Swingin' on a Star''
in 1944.
   ``He was one of the most important composers of American pop
music,'' Cahn said. ``He was considered a composer's composer.''
   The son of a building contractor who played the cornet, Van
Heusen was born Edward Chester Babcock on Jan. 26, 1913, in
Syracuse, N.Y. He adopted the name Van Heusen from the shirt
maker's billboard advertisement.
   In 1928, he was expelled from Central High School in Syracuse
for singing his own composition, entitled, ``My Canary Has Circles
Under Its Eyes.''
   His next-door neighbor in Syracuse was composer Harold Arlen.
When Arlen went to Hollywood in 1933, he asked his brother Jerry
Arlen and Van Heusen to take over his writing duties at New York
City's Cotton Club in Harlem.
   He wrote ``Harlem Hospitality.'' The tune and the show for it
flopped, but Van Heusen hung on in New York, operating a freight
elevator and plugging tunes until he got a hit when Crosby recorded
``It's the Dreamer in Me'' in 1938.
   By 1940, he was one of Tin Pan Alley's most successful
composers, with 60 songs published in just one season. Hollywood
beckoned, and he joined with Burke for a songwriting team that
became known as the Gold Dust Twins. Among the words and music they
churned out were the daffy tunes for the Bob Hope and Crosby
``Road'' pictures.
   He wrote ``Swingin' on a Star,'' for Crosby's movie ``Going My
Way.'' The tune ``Love and Marriage'' won a 1955 Emmy and has been
introduced to a new generation of television viewers as the theme
song for ``Married ... With Children.''
   During the summer of 1942, Van Heusen toured West Coast Army
camps with Crosby, sometimes serving as Crosby's pilot.
   In 1955, Van Heusen teamed with Cahn and produced a string of
motion picture scores that became hits. They also scored the 1965
Broadway musical, ``Skyscraper,'' including ``Everybody has a Right
to Be Wrong.''
   Cahn and Van Heusen also wrote numerous hit songs for Sinatra,
including ``All the Way,'' and the title songs of the albums ``Come
Fly With Me,'' ``Only the Lonely,'' ``Come Dance With Me'' and
``September of My Years.''
   Van Heusen was one of 10 songwriters elected to the Songwriters
Hall of Fame when it was founded in 1971.
   The gregarious Van Heusen loved entertaining, parties, and the
single life. ``I dig chicks, booze, music and Sinatra _ in that
order,'' he told an interviewer in the 1960s.
   Cahn called Van Heusen ``one of the world's greatest swingers.''
   Van Heusen remained a bachelor until September 1969, when he
married Bobbe Brock. He is survived by his wife.
   Private services are scheduled Friday at Desert Memorial Park in
Cathedral City.

   Irving Berlin's death at age 101 marked the end
of an era in American music, but his legacy lives on in his music,
friends and admirers said Saturday.
   ``Just knowing he was there'' was an inspiration, said John
Wallowitch, a composer and cabaret performer who had organized
Christmas Eve serenades outside Berlin's Manhattan town house for
more than 20 years.
   Upon hearing of Berlin's death, Wallowitch said, he and three
friends went to the reclusive songwriter's home.
   ``We just stood there and cried a lot and sang, `I'll be loving
you, always,''' he said. He said he planned to organize a larger,
candlelight vigil for Sunday night.
   Berlin, who wrote ``Always,'' ``God Bless America,'' ``White
Christmas,'' and more than 1,000 other songs in his long career,
died in his sleep at his home about 5:30 p.m. Friday.
   A spokesman said the funeral would be private, but plans for a
memorial service would be announced.
   Broadway theaters planned to dim their lights Saturday night in
honor of the man who wrote the scores for 19 shows, including
``Annie Get Your Gun'' and ``Call Me Madam.''
   The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, of
which Berlin was a charter member, planned to take out a full-page
testimonial in Monday's New York Times, said former president
Stanley Adams. ASCAP, which organized an all-star Carnegie Hall
salute to Berlin for his 100th birthday last year, also planned a
memorial.
   ``I think he's the greatest songwriter the world has ever had,''
Adams said.
   Composer-conductor Morton Gould, the president of ASCAP, said
Berlin's music has become ``part of our language, part of our
heartbeat, part of our soul.''
   In Boston, President Bush joined a crowd of thousands Saturday to
sing ``God Bless America.'' Bush was speaking at a luncheon of Roman
Catholic lawyers.
   Later, he said in a statement: ``Very few people have come to
touch and move the soul of a nation, reflecting its spirit and
traditions. Mr. Berlin ranks among such people, a composer, a
legendary man whose words and music will help define the history of
our nation.''
   Former President Reagan, who as an actor was featured along with
Berlin's songs in the flag-waving 1943 movie musical ``This is the
Army,'' said in a statement: ``Nancy and I are deeply saddened by
the death of a wonderfully talented man whose musical genius
delighted and stirred millions, and will live on forever.''
   Actress-dancer Ginger Rogers said working with Berlin and her
longtime partner Fred Astaire in ``Top Hat,'' was ``like heaven,''
referring to the lyrics of Berlin's Oscar-nominated ``Cheek to
Cheek,'' which was featured in the classic 1935 film.
   Jack Horvath, a salesman at Carl Fischer Music in Manhattan, said
Berlin sheet music is still in demand. The nearly 50-year-old
``White Christmas'' is the store's No. 1 seller during the holidays,
he said.
   ``I personally went up to his office last Christmas and picked up
500 copies because it had gone so fast,'' Horvath said.
   ``He wrote songs for the people,'' said opera singer Robert
Merrill. ``Irving Berlin was the greatest Tin Pan Alley songwriter.
He was not a great musician but he had a great ear and he had a
feeling for melody and words that was precious.''
   ``There'll never be another Irving Berlin. It's an era that's
gone.''

   Pianist and composer Robert D.
Emmerich, who played with the Tommy Dorsey band and wrote songs for
Fats Waller, has died at age 83.
   Emmerich died Friday at Florida Medical Center, and a funeral
was held Sunday.
   Emmerich wrote more than 100 songs, including ``Beat It Out,''
``Woe Is Me'' and 10 others for Waller. He wrote ``Our Love,''
first sung by Dinah Shore, and ``No. 10 Lullaby Lane,'' introduced
by Kate Smith.
   Emmerich, who collaborated with Buddy Bernier and Joseph Meyer,
wrote a song called ``The Big Apple'' in the 1940s, said his wife,
Miriam.
   ``Walter Winchell liked it so much he started calling New York
`the Big Apple,''' his wife said.
   Emmerich also was a vaudeville, radio and night club performer.
   ``Bob was a self-taught piano player who couldn't read a note of
music, but he had some left hand,'' Mrs. Emmerich said.
   Emmerich, who was born in New York City, moved to Florida nine
years ago.

and memorable.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  HE'S PLAYING THEIR SONGS
THE TOP 10 FAVORITE TUNES OF MICHAEL FEINSTEIN  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Theater; At Large  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Feinstein, who used to fascinate small, devoted crowds in San Francisco's
Plush Room just a few years ago, has become a major star, appearing mostly in
theaters. He and pop-music great Rosemary Clooney, a former neighbor, are in
concert now at the Curran Theater through Jan. 5 in a delightful show, "Say It
With Music.";   Backstage, a couple of hours before show time, Feinstein sat
still long enough for me to ask him what somehow had not been covered in our
previous discussions in New York and here. The question: Michael, what are
your 10 favorite songs?;   Feinstein seemed shocked. "There are thousands," he
said. But lists have their limits, and 10 seems to be the number of choice
these days.;   The movie-star-handsome young musician, wearing a college sweat
shirt, smiled, let his eyes roll back and started thinking. "OK," he said,
"but remember these are top-of-the-head. It's what comes to mind first. I know
I'm going to leave something out.";   Fair enough. What's No. 1?;   "Well, in
no special order, the first one I'd say is 'Someone to Watch Over Me.' ";  
Actually, this one would probably top the Feinstein list even if he had weeks
to consider. It has to do with the story behind the selection:;   "I have a
lot of personal memories about this song," Feinstein said. "That gives it
extra poignancy. Ira (Gershwin, with whom Feinstein lived for a time) told me
that he wrote the song (lyric) about himself. It was shortly before his
marriage to Leonore. He felt himself so lucky to win a woman like her.;   "He
never considered himself attractive. He was short, wore glasses, was heavy. It
was (brother) George who was the lady killer. But George never married. In the
last year of his life he asked every woman he met to marry him, including
Paulette Goddard.;   "Anyway, Ira's lyric goes: 'Though he may not be the man
some/Girls think of as handsome/ To my heart he carries the key . . .';  
"That was Ira talking about himself. Gertrude Lawrence sang it in 1926 in 'Oh,
Kay.' ";   "OK," I said. "No. 2?";   This one was a real surprise. Feinstein
picked "Old Friend," a song by Gretchen Cryer and Nancy Ford written for the
1978 feminist musical "I'm Getting My Act Together and Taking It on the
Road.";   "This song is really requested a lot," Feinstein said. "And it
strikes me very deeply. It reflects the lifestyles of the '80s and '90s.
Friendships now are tenuous. The song has poignancy and hope. I like songs
that express hope.";   No. 3 is not exactly a major hit, either. Feinstein
picked "Where Do You Start?" a song by Johnny Mandel and Alan and Marilyn
Bergman. "I introduced it on my 'Isn't It Romantic?' album," he said. "I was
working with Johnny then. He won an Oscar for 'Shadow of Your Smile.' ";  
Frankly, I muttered, I prefer "Isn't It Romantic?" but this isn't my list. So
we headed to No. 4.;   Finally, finally! Feinstein chose a 1932 song by Irving
Berlin, the beautiful "How Deep Is the Ocean?";   "That song is quintessential
Berlin," Feinstein said. "It takes a line that was even then a cliche phrase
and makes it eloquent. Irving Berlin seems to be very simple in his songs, but
it is a deceptive simplicity.";   No. 5 would warm the cockles of Bob Hope's
heart, though it isn't the Hope rendition of "Thanks for the Memory" that
Feinstein loves. The Leo Robin/Ralph Rainger song was in "The Big Broadcast of
1938.";   "I knew Leo Robin," Feinstein said. "He gave me all the multiple
sets of lyrics he wrote for this song. There are so many marvelous verses.";  
And Feinstein sang me one: "Thanks for the memory/massages at the club/That
little tree/ Your Pekingese/Would sniff but never snub . . .";   Feinstein,
once he gets on a lyric, turns very mellow. He mentioned many phrases from the
song that delight him. Such as "Strictly entre nous/And how are all those
little dreams that never did come true . . .";   It looks rather ordinary on
paper, of course. But Feinstein marvels over the insight in the phrase and how
it reaches so many people.;   On to No. 6. It's "I'll Be Seeing You." That's
one the World War II generation would heartily endorse.;   "It's by Sammy Fain
and Irving Kahal," Feinstein told me. "It was actually written in 1938, before
the war, but it became a hit later. Kahal died in 1942, before it all
happened." And Feinstein had another memory.;   "I think I was probably the
last person that Sammy Fain heard sing the song," he said. "I sang it at an
L.A. concert in 1989. And when I finished I asked him to stand up and take a
bow. He died a few months later.";   (Another Sammy Fain song, said Feinstein,
is "Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing.");   Song No. 7 is a Richard Rodgers and
Lorenz Hart ballad, "Bewitched (Bothered and Bewildered)," one of the hit
songs from the 1940 musical "Pal Joey.";   "Simply because it's one of Larry
Hart's most brilliant lyrics," Feinstein said.;   It contains the memorable
lines: "I'll sing to him/ Each spring to him/ And worship the trousers that
cling to him." The lines had to be changed for the hit-parade version, when
the song became popular.;   His eighth choice, Feinstein said, is "I Can't Get
Started." It was written by Vernon Duke and Ira Gershwin for the "Ziegfeld
Follies of 1936," where it was sung by Bob Hope and Eve Arden. Feinstein sings
this song with the still-mellifluous Clooney in the current concert show.;  
"There was one rendition of the song by trumpeter Bunny Berigan, who jazzed it
up and sang, 'I still can't not get started with you.' That double negative
drove Ira mad. He didn't want the world to think it was his bad grammar.";  
Another surprise for No. 9. Feinstein picked a Harold Arlen/Yip Harburg song
from "The Wizard of Oz," "If I Only Had a Brain.";   Why this one?;   "The
brilliance of Harburg's lyrics really shines through. Harburg is not well
known today, but he was a genius. The song showed the struggle of the common
man, the kind of man who thinks, 'If only I had this, if only I had that . .
.' I heard Yip sing this song in 1979 at a UCLA tribute to him.";   Which
brings us to No. 10.;   And true to the iconoclastic nature of his list,
Feinstein picked "Blame It On My Youth." This is a melody by Oscar Levant,
better known as a pianist and interpreter of George Gershwin, with a lyric by
Edward Heyman, written in 1934.;   I said that Levant must be feeling good,
wherever he is, to get the recognition.;   "I doubt that," said Feinstein
about the famous hypochondriac. "I never get tired of singing this song. And I
get lots of requests. The song is cynical -- 'If I expected love when first we
kissed/ Blame it on my youth.' It establishes a very sophisticated mood.";  
As does Feinstein whenever we talk. There aren't many others like him. He
dismisses Harry Connick as "not a competitor; he's a jazzer.";   Feinstein is
a throwback to another era, which he has managed to revive. He did it first in
a nightclub act, but now he has developed a bigger voice and a stage presence
that allows him to leave his piano and hold the stage, front and center.;  
Feinstein says that, yes, he would like to write songs, too, but "it's a
separate discipline. I would have to do it full time.";   When he isn't
talking about songs, Feinstein will offer opinions on current songwriters,
those, at least, from his show-tune world. The problem is that there aren't
many of them.;   His opinions are provocative.;   Cy Coleman, who composed the
music for "City of Angels," is "not discriminating," Feinstein said. He thinks
"City of Angels" would have been better as a straight (non-musical) comedy.;  
He says Andrew Lloyd Webber, perhaps the most successful of today's show
composers, "is a man of great potential, but he hasn't realized it yet. Yes,
he is derivative, but other composers have been derivative, too.";   Feinstein
compared "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina" with the earlier "Rose Marie, I Love
You" and indeed there are similarities.;   And Stephen Sondheim, the other
current songwriter celebrity?;   "I love a lot of Sondheim," Feinstein said,
"but he's too cerebral for me.";   And so on and so on about this song and
that.;   Sooner or later in concert he touches on one of your own favorites.
Then he treats it as a special child, displaying it lovingly.;   In an age of
heavy metal and pornographic lyrics, you don't get much of that anymore.;

   Irving Berlin's songs were so much a part of
America for generations that it would be hard to think of life
without him, his admirers said.
   ``There'll never be another Irving Berlin. It's an era that's
gone,'' said opera singer Robert Merrill, who also sings Berlin's
songs.
   ``He wrote songs for the people,'' Merrill said. ``He was not a
great musician but he had a great ear and he had a feeling for
melody and words that was precious.''
   Berlin, whose most memorable compositions included ``White
Christmas,'' ``Easter Parade'' and ``God Bless America,'' died
Friday night at his home at the age of 101.
   Cabaret singer Bobby Short said he thought Berlin would be
remembered as ``a very, very, very important, very great American
composer. He is perhaps the last of the giants _ and I think that's
not a bad way to go.''
   ``His musicality was constantly astonishing. People who thought
they could pin down the Irving Berlin style would be surprised to
find his newest song a complete turnabout,'' Short said.
   Actress-dancer Ginger Rogers paid tribute to Berlin by humming a
phrase from his ``Cheek to Cheek.''
   ``I'm in heaven,'' she sang sadly in a telephone interview from
her home in Eagle Point, Ore.
   Breaking off to describe the thrill of working with Berlin and
Fred Astaire on the movie ``Top Hat,'' she said: ``It was like
heaven.''
   Miss Rogers recalled the songwriter's kindness when she was first
breaking into show business.
   ``I went into his music company to get some songs,'' she said.
``He had no reason to make charming conversation to me, but he made
very gentle conversation and encouraged me because I was very new to
show business.''
   Ronald Reagan, who in his acting days was featured in the 1943
movie musical ``This is the Army,'' said: ``Nancy and I are deeply
saddened by the death of a wonderfully talented man whose musical
genius delighted and stirred millions, and will live on forever.''
   ``He's been so much a part of all of us, of all ages, over all
the many years,'' said composer-conductor Morton Gould, president of
the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. ``The
generations of people, millions of people, have danced to it, have
lived it, have romanced it.
   ``It's become part of our language, part of our heartbeat, part
of our soul. It's the kind of finish of an era,'' Gould said.``I
can't believe that he's not here.''
   Composer Burt Bacharach, who wrote 1969's Academy Award-winning
song ``Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head,'' said, ``This is a great
loss. But Irving Berlin has left us with the greatest legacy through
his music. His contributions to American popular music are
immeasurable.''
   Singer Paul Anka said: ``Throughout my career as a writer of
songs, I've always idolized Irving Berlin as the consummate master
of words and music.
   ``He wrote `God Bless America' _ May God bless Irving Berlin.''

REMEMBERING BERLIN -- ALWAYS; 
</P>
<P>
'IF YOU'RE A PRO YOU WRITE WHAT YOU GOTTA WRITE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK HIRSHBERG, Hirshberg, a publicist at Paramount in the 1940s, worked 
with Irving Berlin on White Christmas and Blue Skies. Following are 
recollections and excerpts of conversations he taped over the years with the 
reclusive composer who died Friday at age 101. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I had the good fortune to work on an almost daily basis with Irving Berlin for 
close to two years at one time, and for other shorter spans. We had many 
conversations, some of which I managed to record. This was no minor 
accomplishment inasmuch as Berlin, a wiry, supercharged individual, aspired to 
assert complete control over any project with which he was associated. 
</P>
<P>
He was almost always in motion, seldom remaining seated for more than a few 
minutes unless he was at the piano. He preferred to patrol the executive 
corridors at Paramount Studios, where we worked, or pace nervously in circles 
around his office, frequently in shirt sleeves, lost in introspection, hands 
clasped behind his back, torso bent slightly forward as he moved. Like an ice 
skater. 
</P>
<P>
He was a genial man, as sharp a businessman as he was a beguiling and 
perceptive poet. 
</P>
<P>
Berlin once told me, with his customary candor, that some of his output "was 
trash." Nonetheless, his ability to churn out songs so enchanting and timeless 
that their appeal spans generations and socioeconomic strata and national and 
racial boundaries is unrivaled in the annals of American music. 
</P>
<P>
"Some songs just write themselves," Berlin said. "Take 'Cheek to Cheek,' for 
instance. It is quite a long, involved song. I wrote it for Astaire and Rogers 
in 'Top Hat.' I did it after dinner one evening while staying at the Beverly 
Wilshire Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, I was not satisfied lyrically with 'Always.' I had the tune 
finished for months but couldn't get the lyric right. Then one day I just 
ad-libbed it and it worked. For me, lyrics are the hardest part." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no special recipe for success," Berlin told me. "Some very good songs 
never got off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the timing is wrong and a good song dies. It happens to all writers. 
In my opinion, Cole Porter's 'Begin the Beguine' is one of the greatest pieces 
of music written by anybody. It was in a show called 'Jubilee' many years ago 
and it was a failure until much later Artie Shaw, the big-band leader, made a 
recording and everyone suddenly discovered it is a classic. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote 'White Christmas' because I had to write a song about Christmas for 
the show. I was a good songwriter so I wrote a good song." 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain basic emotions, not only in songwriting and play writing but 
also in making speeches or writing stories. There's self-pity, which is 'All 
Alone' or 'Remember' . . . where you feel sorry for yourself. There's 
happiness. There's the straight love song, like 'Always.' There's the homesick 
song -- songs about Dixie. There's the patriotic song, such as 'God Bless 
America.' 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I've written songs that were failures. You can be so clever that 
you write around your subject and become oblique. Your pencil becomes so sharp 
that you write from the outside rather than the inside. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all amateurs until we write a hit, and there are no basic rules. When I 
started, we were confined to an octave and maybe a note, although 'Alexander's 
Ragtime Band' went beyond that. Then Jerome Kern came along and wrote two 
octaves, or an octave and three quarters. It didn't make a darn bit of 
difference because Jerome Kern had talent and a heart of gold and he just wrote 
great melodies. 
</P>
<P>
"I can give you all sorts of rules, but you may go home and break them all and 
write the biggest hit ever written. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a pro you write what you gotta write. Someone needs a ballad, you 
write a ballad. It's a matter of talent. Some of the biggest hits I've had were 
written because we needed a ballad in the publishing house. I've written many 
songs because the situation called for a boy and a girl to sing a love song. 
</P>
<P>
"Take 'Annie Get Your Gun.' Herbert and Dorothy Fields wrote the book about 
Annie Oakley, who was a fantastic rifle shot. The situations called for a love 
song, so I wrote 'They Say That Falling in Love Is Wonderful.' I thought that 
would be the big hit. We all felt 'I Got the Sun in the Mornin' would be a 
rhythm smash. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Annie Get Your Gun' has 16 songs. It's a true story. Frank Butler was the 
world's greatest marksman with a rifle. But when Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, 
in which Butler starred, came to town, little Annie Oakley beat him. Buffalo 
Bill asked Annie to join his show but she didn't want to leave home. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to write a song that would sell her on the idea of coming along . . . 
the glories of riding on a train. The excitement. I tried to wrap it up in one 
phrase, and the phrase was 'There's No Business Like Show Business.' I wrote it 
as a throwaway song to advance the story line. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't plan it as an anthem for show business. But, according to my ASCAP 
survey, it is my most-performed song. Not the biggest record seller, but the 
most-performed." 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a professional songwriter, you write. You write in the morning, you 
write at night, you write in a taxi or on the subway. You have it in your mind 
until you're finished, and even after it's finished. It may turn out to be very 
bad. I have songs written years ago that I'd still like to change. 
</P>
<P>
"A professional songwriter doesn't work business hours. He subconsciously 
gathers material and ideas all the time. I don't have a notebook filled with 
titles or these ideas, but they're tucked away somewhere in memory. 
</P>
<P>
"There's one thing about longevity in this business. You don't get 
holier-than-thou. You don't give something to the public with the attitude 
that, well, here it is and you damn better like it. You try to guess what they 
want and then try to please them." 
</P>
<P>
"(George M. Cohan) was my ideal," Berlin said. "I tried to write like him. He 
was the fellow who supplied special material to the guys who sang in the 
saloons when I was a kid. I started by writing parodies of current songs by 
other composers -- at first I just wrote lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a bit older I became a singing waiter, and I want you to know I was 
a pretty good one. At least, I thought I was pretty good until we made the 
movie version of 'This Is The Army' at Warner Brothers in which I sang 'Oh, How 
I Hate to Get Up in the Morning.' An electrician heard my prerecording and said 
that if the guy who wrote that song could hear this fellow sing it he'd turn 
over in his grave." 
</P>
<P>
"My interest is principally in the creation of songs," Berlin once told me. 
"But we live in a country and society that is based on free enterprise. Just 
try buying a painting by Picasso or Cezanne and see what you'll be charged." 
Around 1944, Berlin bought up copyrights to all his songs. They are still owned 
by his estate. He refused more than one offer in the hundreds of millions of 
dollars for his catalogue, claiming he would not know what to do with the money 
and the would-be purchasers would not know what to do with his music. 
</P>
<P>
At his death, Berlin was still living in the house on Beekman Place in New York 
which he purchased in 1946 from its builder and original owner, the late James 
Forrestal, one-time Navy Secretary. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to rent it but we couldn't, so we bought it," he remembered. "It's 
on the East River in what is supposed to be a fashionable neighborhood. But the 
East River doesn't impress me because they picked me out of the East River when 
I was a kid . . . a little lower downtown, perhaps, but still the same river, 
tugboats and all." 
</P>
<P>
During his life Berlin stubbornly resisted all offers to use his life story as 
the basis for a Broadway musical or film. He told me that when he died his 
children could make such a decision, if they chose. 
</P>
<P>
"My private life is private, but I'll be very happy to talk about it," he said 
puckishly. "We have a nice corner house in New York. We spend out summers in 
the Catskills, and we go there in winter, too. There's lots of deer up there. 
And snow. 
</P>
<P>
"I seldom relax. My hobby is songwriting. My wife and I used to go dancing, but 
we'd sooner sit and talk. I'm not a good dancer. I'm a very big eater. I like 
good food. I like to cook but they tell me I cook badly. I've found if you buy 
good meat you should leave it alone -- the same as with a good song. Don't do 
too big of an arrangement." 
</P>
<P>
Berlin said the most important advice he would offer aspiring songwriters was, 
"Never throw anything away." 
</P>
<P>
"During World War I, I wrote a song at Camp Upton for a soldier show called 
'Yip, Yip Yaphank'," he said. "I intended it as the finale but we didn't use 
it. It went into the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1938 I was in London for the opening of 'Alexander's Ragtime Band.' It was 
September, near the time Neville Chamberlain came back from meeting Hitler with 
his piece of paper about peace in our time. 
</P>
<P>
"I was distraught about the threat of war, and when I returned to New York I 
wanted to write a patriotic song. I wrote one called 'Thanks, America,' but it 
was a very sad song. 
</P>
<P>
"But the word 'America' recalled the song I wrote 20 years earlier at Camp 
Upton. I hauled it out of the trunk and rewrote it. The first 16 bars and the 
last eight are exactly as they were written originally, but I changed the 
middle because I wanted to write a song about peace, not about war. 
</P>
<P>
"A short time afterwards, when Kate Smith asked me to write a patriotic song 
for her, I just gave her the revised version of the old song." 
</P>
<P>
Thus was "God Bless America" rescued from the scrap heap. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my personal favorite song." 
</P>
<P>
When last we talked, Berlin seemed interested in dispelling a myth about his 
keyboard ability. 
</P>
<P>
"People think I can only play that special piano with the movable keyboard. I 
play in the key of F sharp, which are the black keys. Years ago all fakers 
played that way. We played by ear, and the publishing companies had these 
transposing pianos because we could not transpose. We really could not write 
music. 
</P>
<P>
"For me F sharp happened because the black keys are right under your fingers. 
But as I progressed, I got to know the relative keys. I took lessons once or 
twice but I wasn't any good. 
</P>
<P>
"George M. Cohan had a couple of transposing pianos. He played in the key of C, 
which is also supposed to be easy. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, I began composing away from the piano. I developed a system 
whereby I envisioned the keyboard in my mind, and I could encode the proper 
notes on paper. I work mainly with ideas. I write words and music together, one 
phrase at a time. But I can play any piano." 
</P>
<P>
Today Berlin's old moveable piano stands mute in the Smithsonian Institution in 
Washington.

JIMMY VAN HEUSEN, PROLIFIC SONGSMITH, OSCAR WINNER, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jimmy Van Heusen, who took his name from a shirt label and his melodies from a 
mirthful mind and gentle heart, has died at his home in Rancho Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
The tunesmith whose "Swinging on a Star," "All the Way," "High Hopes" and "Call 
Me Irresponsible" not only won four Oscars but became national monuments, had 
celebrated his 77th birthday last month. 
</P>
<P>
He died Tuesday, a spokesman for the Riverside County coroner's office said 
Wednesday. His death was attributed to a stroke, and the coroner's spokesman 
said he had suffered from cerebral vascular disease for about two years. 
</P>
<P>
Born Edward Chester Babcock in Syracuse, N.Y., he was a mischievous boy who was 
expelled from high school for singing a mildly salacious song "My Canary Has 
Rings Under His Eyes" at a school assembly. 
</P>
<P>
It probably was the only song he was ever identified with that he didn't 
compose himself. 
</P>
<P>
He grew to become a fun-loving adult who once told an interviewer "I dig 
chicks, booze, music and Sinatra -- in that order." 
</P>
<P>
It was Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby who made famous his songs -- "Aren't You 
Glad You're You" from Crosby's film "The Bells of St. Mary's"; "Moonlight 
Becomes You" from Crosby's "The Road to Morocco"; "(Love Is) The Tender Trap," 
from Sinatra's "The Tender Trap" and "All the Way" from Sinatra's "The Joker Is 
Wild." 
</P>
<P>
He was nominated for eight additional Academy Awards for such musical 
masterpieces as "The Second Time Around" from "High Time"; "Pocketful of 
Miracles" from the 1961 film of the same name; "My Kind of Town," a Sinatra 
signature song from "Robin and the 7 Hoods" and more. 
</P>
<P>
He won an Emmy for "Love and Marriage" from the 1955 production of "Our Town." 
It since has become a leitmotif for the current generation of TV watchers who 
now hear it as the theme of the ribald "Married . . . With Children." 
</P>
<P>
If he helped make stars of Crosby (both as a priest and with Bob Hope in the 
legendary "Road" series of comedies) and Sinatra, he also helped make household 
words and friends of his many collaborators -- Johnny Mercer, Johnny Burke, 
Eddie DeLange and most notably and recently, Sammy Cahn. 
</P>
<P>
The son of a building contractor who played the cornet, young Edward Babcock 
was encouraged to seek a conventional education, even though he was more 
interested in music. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving high school under circumstances his parents didn't consider 
amusing, he enrolled briefly at a boarding school near Syracuse but left there 
when teachers found him more often in poolrooms than classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
While still a student, Babcock (who never changed his name legally) landed a 
job on a local radio station for $15 a week. The station manager insisted that 
he change his name, and he appropriated Van Heusen from the shirt manufacturer 
and James because he said he just liked it. 
</P>
<P>
He did attend Syracuse University from 1930 to 1932, studying piano and 
composition, and while there formed a partnership with Jerry Arlen, Harold 
Arlen's younger brother. 
</P>
<P>
His next-door neighbor in Syracuse had been composer Arlen, and when the man 
who was to write the music for "The Wizard of Oz" went to Hollywood in 1933, he 
asked his brother and Van Heusen to take over his composing duties at Harlem's 
famed Cotton Club. 
</P>
<P>
Van Heusen wrote "Harlem Hospitality." The tune and the show it was written for 
flopped, but Van Heusen hung on in New York, operating a freight elevator at 
Park Central Hotel and plugging tunes. 
</P>
<P>
One of his first compositions, "There's a House in Harlem for Sale" was 
performed by the hotel orchestra and got him out of the elevator and into a job 
with a music publishing firm. 
</P>
<P>
He met orchestra leader Jimmy Dorsey in 1938 and offered him his latest song, 
"It's the Dreamer in Me." The resultant recording became a hit and also sold 
100,000 copies of sheet music. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby also recorded it and, by 1940, Van Heusen had become one of Tin Pan 
Alley's most successful composers, with 60 songs published in just one season. 
Next came Hollywood, and he joined with Burke for a songwriting team that 
became known as the Gold Dust Twins. 
</P>
<P>
He composed his first film score with Burke for "Love Thy Neighbor" in 1940, 
which was widely recorded. 
</P>
<P>
In a single week that year, Van Heusen had three songs on the Hit Parade, 
including "Shake Down the Stars," "All This and Heaven Too" and "Polka Dots and 
Moonbeams." 
</P>
<P>
During the wartime summer of 1942, Van Heusen toured West Coast Army camps with 
Crosby, sometimes serving as the crooner's pilot. He had amassed enough flying 
time to qualify as a test pilot for Lockheed Corp., taking war planes up for 
their maiden voyages between 1942 and 1944. 
</P>
<P>
He owned aircraft and a helicopter during the 1960s, and his Yucca Valley ranch 
was equipped with a landing pad. 
</P>
<P>
At one point Van Heusen and Burke were under contract to Crosby, 20th Century 
Fox, MGM, Columbia and International studios. 
</P>
<P>
In 1955 Van Heusen teamed with Cahn and produced a string of motion picture 
scores that became hits. Their Academy Award-winning "High Hopes" was chosen as 
the official song for John F. Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The composer also donated the song "California" to the inaugural gala held for 
former California Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Although he had tremendous success with popular tunes (seven Grammy 
nominations) and movie music, Broadway was one venue whose success eluded Van 
Heusen. The productions of "Swingin' the Dream," "Nellie Bly" and "Carnival in 
Flanders" were all acknowledged by the composer as flops. 
</P>
<P>
(The durable jazz ballad "Darn That Dream" was one of the few bright spots from 
the 1939 "Swingin' the Dream," which starred Louis Armstrong and Benny 
Goodman.) 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big, big gamble," he said in 1965 before the stage production of 
"Skyscraper," for which he was nominated for a Tony award. "You spend two years 
putting it together, and if six critics don't like it, you're out of business 
overnight. It's that simple." 
</P>
<P>
He had shaved his head for years and cut a dashing figure with exquisite but 
casual clothes. He loved entertaining, parties, and, until 1969 when he married 
singer Bobbe Brock, being single. Friends said he was able to write songs with 
a party going on around him or while lounging by his swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
He also wrote songs for those same friends, including two for Sinatra's 
daughters -- "Nancy (With the Laughing Face)" and "Tina." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, lyricist Cahn said by telephone from New York that when people 
ask him who is the most fascinating character he ever met, he always answers 
"Jimmy Van Heusen." 
</P>
<P>
"Then they say, 'what about Sinatra?' 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them Sinatra thought he was Van Heusen, but he couldn't pass the 
physical." 
</P>
<P>

<LEADPARA>  THE Christ child's nativity 2,000 years ago in an obscure village of a remote
Roman colony has inspired composers ever since. They've created music that's
still played and cherished by Christians around the globe.;   It's not the
glossy concert pieces and oratorios that take center stage tonight, however;
it's the humble Christmas carol, an often misrepresented musical form.
Strictly speaking, a carol is a dance-like song with alternating verse and
refrain, like "God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen" or "I Saw Three Ships."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  THE HUMBLE CAROL TAKES CENTER STAGE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Music  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Love the carol, sing it badly -- just don't abuse it any more. It deserves
better.;   Incredible nonsense has made the rounds about Christmas music, and
some of the myths endure. Every piano-vocal Christmas collection I've ever
bought has had glaring errors.;   Consider the breathtaking "Silent Night," a
work built on just three chords, easy enough for a child to sing or play. A
masterpiece, right? For years it seemed both plausible and accurate that the
composer was Michael Haydn, Franz Josef Haydn's brother.;   Wrong.;  
Actually, "Silent Night" was composed on an emergency basis by schoolteacher
Franz Gruber of the humble Austrian village of Oberndorf when the church organ
broke down on Christmas Eve. The assistant pastor, Josef Mohr, provided the
German words. "Silent Night" made its world premiere in 1818 not with a chorus
of 200, not with an orchestra, but with just two solo singers, a chorus and a
guitar.;   Contrary to what your carol book might say, Handel did not write
"Joy to the World." That canard stemmed from the fact that its opening four
notes match "Lift Up Your Heads, O Ye Gates" from Handel's "Messiah." The real
composer: an 18th-century unknown.;   "Away in a Manger" was not written by
Martin Luther, though it is often attributed to him. In fact, the tune remains
virtually unknown in Luther's Germany today. It first appeared in James R.
Murray's 1887 "Dainty Songs for Little Lads and Lassies," bearing Murray's
initials.;   Mozart and Mendelssohn actually did have a hand in songs of the
season.;   Mendelssohn wrote the music of "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing," but
the words were foreign to him. He composed his tune for "For a Tercentenary of
the Invention of the Art of Printing" (his title!), as an homage to Gutenberg.
Though he wrote many sacred works, he staunchly opposed the recycling of this
tune for Christmas use. Fortunately his protests were to no avail.;   Mozart's
involvement was even more peripheral: He recycled our popular Welsh carol
"Deck the Halls," using its theme in a violin-piano duo.;   Carols have an
ambivalent history. Long before they ever entered the church, carols had a
role in pagan ritual. The church actually fought to keep them out.;   Today,
however, carols are as welcome in the church as in the home. Carolers wander
around neighborhoods, spreading cheer. And in millions of households around
the world tonight, carols will nourish the soul as the family celebrates
Christmas.;   Happy caroling, and a very merry Christmas too!;   BACH FOR THE
HOLIDAYS: If you want to set a musical tone for Christmas Eve, a marvelous new
compact disc does it well, blending both Catholic and Protestant traditions.
J.S. Bach's Masses, BWV 233 and 236 (Virgin Classics, 55 minutes) features the
Collegium Vocale of Ghent, Belgium, under the direction of the
period-instruments conductor Philippe Herreweghe.;   These works use the Latin
texts of the Catholic Church, but they were intended for Protestant services
in Leipzig, probably after 1734. Each Mass consists of just a Kyrie (Christ,
Have Mercy) and Gloria; as a result, they are rarely sung at our Bach
festivals.;   The first Mass is especially effective musically, with rich
baroque counterpoint and, in the Kyrie, some of Bach's best fugal writing.  </TEXT>

<MEMO>  Obituaries  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Mrs. Kaye, the widow of actor Danny Kaye, wrote the music and lyrics for
many of her husband's films, including "Up in Arms" (1944), "Wonder Man"
(1945), "The Kid From Brooklyn" (1946), "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"
(1947), "The Inspector General" (1949) and "The Court Jester" (1956).;   A
native of Brooklyn, she was a graduate of Brooklyn College, where she studied
music. After college, she helped put on skits at a summer camp in
Pennsylvania, where her fellow entertainers included Imogene Coca, Max Liebman
and Danny Kaye.;   There she began writing specialty material, including a
Yiddish version of Gilbert and Sullivan's "Mikado" for Danny Kaye. In 1940,
the sketches were produced on Broadway under the title "The Straw Hat Revue.";
  That year, she married Kaye, and the couple worked as a popular act at La
Martinique, a Manhattan nightclub. Mrs. Kaye wrote the music and lyrics for
her husband and accompanied him on piano.;   Mrs. Kaye was known for her
complex, witty lyrics, and she was often described as a composer of patter
songs, which turn on the rapid delivery of tricky lines.;   Most frequently
cited are "Anatole of Paris," "The Lobby Number" and "Soliloquy for Three
Heads," the last sung by three mirror images in "The Inspector General." But
Mrs. Kaye disagreed with this characterization.;   "I wrote many songs for
Danny that had patter sections in them," she once told an interviewer, "but
only two pure patter songs." They were "Melody in 4-F" and a variation of "The
Nightmare Song" from Gilbert and Sullivan's "Iolanthe." For the film "Knock on
Wood" (1954), she wrote "All About You," which Cole Porter called "a perfect
love song.";   For most of her career, Mrs. Kaye wrote songs and music solely
for her husband. She once estimated she wrote more than 100 songs for him
during their 40-year collaboration. She also was involved in the production of
almost all his films. She was nominated twice for Academy Awards, for her work
on "The Five Pennies" (1959) and "The Moon Is Blue" (1953).;   In the 1970s,
she embarked on a separate career as a television producer and teacher. She
began teaching musical comedy at the University of Southern California in 1971
and at Yale University in 1975.;   In 1979, she produced and narrated the
course as a 90-minute Public Broadcasting Service program, "Musical Comedy
Tonight," which won a Peabody Award. In 1975, she was executive producer for a
television special, "Danny Kaye: Look In at the Met." She also produced and
edited "Assignment Children," a UNICEF film that starred her husband.;   In
the last three years, Mrs. Kaye devoted most of her time to writing a book
about her life with Danny Kaye, "Fine and Danny," for Alfred A. Knopf. She
also was writing a catalog of show-business material that she and her husband
had donated to the Library of Congress.;   Brooklyn College awarded her an
honorary doctorate in humane letters in 1985. This year she endowed the Sylvia
Fine Chair in Musical Theater there. She recently financed the restoration of
the 664-seat Playhouse at Hunter College.;   Danny Kaye died in 1987 at the
age of 74. Mrs. Kaye is survived by her daughter, a magazine and television
journalist, and a sister, Rhoda Gamson of New York City.  </TEXT>

For the most part, Amy Wooley likes California. "I came here 10 years ago from 
Ohio, and I'm a California girl," she says. "I love the ocean -- walking on the 
beach near Malibu, picking up seashells, listening to the waves. They make a 
great background for writing songs." 
</P>
<P>
But about this time of year she finds herself yearning for the crisp, wintry 
atmosphere of a Norman Rockwell Midwest Christmas. And she knows where to find 
a facsimile. 
</P>
<P>
"I know this sounds crazy, but when you drive through Topanga Canyon Pass, 
there is one little green section with a stream and trees -- pines and maples 
with leaves that change colors with the seasons. It's just the shortest 
stretch, and it's not Ohio, but it gives me a homey feeling. That's where I've 
been sneaking off to these last few weeks, when I'm in the holiday mood." 
</P>
<P>
For Wooley, a songwriter-composer who completed her bachelor's degree in music 
composition at UCLA this year, the little Topanga stretch of pines and maples 
recaptures her favorite Christmas ritual memory -- bringing home the tree. 
</P>
<P>
"It reminds me of the Rocky River Valley in Ohio where we used to drive home in 
our station wagon after buying our tree on Christmas Eve. Daddy was a school 
teacher, and we had a big family -- five children. So we would wait until 
Christmas Eve, when the trees were marked down, and then buy the biggest one we 
could find, usually a spruce. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we would drive the long way home to Lakewood through the valley. It was 
fun because we were all in the car together with the tree, singing carols. My 
family is all musical and we sing in harmony. 'Silent Night' was a biggie with 
us because it has great harmony. 'Joy to the World' is my favorite. My mother's 
favorite was 'O Little Town of Bethlehem.' All the kids liked 'The First Noel' 
because you get those high notes at the end. 
</P>
<P>
"Our happy times were being together in the station wagon. I don't have any 
better memories: It was Christmas, we were happy, we were kids. That was it, 
boy!" 
</P>
<P>
Wooley recorded one solo album as a performer but is concentrating on 
composition. She is writing a pop opera based on Steinbeck's "Grapes of Wrath." 
And because she recently started teaching music at the Neighborhood Nursery 
School at Westwood Hills Congregational Church, she is interested in children's 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're real focused on Christmas right now, and I wrote one song -- a descant 
for 'Silent Night' called 'Peace on Earth.' I play the guitar, and the kids 
love it. So once again, I'm singing harmony with kids -- my Christmas 
favorite." CONNIE KOENNEN

   Irving Berlin, the Russian cantor's son whose
songs such as ``Cheek to Cheek,'' ``Easter Parade,'' ``White
Christmas'' and ``God Bless America'' became the essence of American
music, has died at age 101.
   ``He's been so much a part of all of us, of all ages, over all
the many years,'' said composer-conductor Morton Gould, president of
the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.
   Of Berlin's music, Gould said: ``It's become part of our
language, part of our heartbeat, part of our soul.
   ``It's the kind of finish of an era.''
   Berlin died in his sleep at his Manhattan town house Friday
afternoon, said his son-in-law, Alton E. Peters. Asked if Berlin had
been ill, Peters said, ``No, he was 101 years old. ... He just fell
asleep.''
   An actor, singer, and songwriter, Berlin began his career in the
early days of vaudeville and his songs for a time so dominated the
stage and screen that the late composer, Jerome Kern, said: ``Berlin
has no place in American music. He is American music.''
   In a musical career that began with a job as a singing waiter,
Berlin wrote nearly 1,000 songs, from his first big hit,
``Alexander's Ragtime Band'' in 1911, to ``Puttin' on the Ritz,''
which was revived in 1983 by the Dutch singer Taco and was a hit on
the rock charts.
   Berlin was an immigrant Russian whose ``God Bless America''
became the nation's unofficial second national anthem. A Jew, his
``White Christmas'' and ``Easter Parade'' became Christian holiday
traditions.
   ``American music was born at his piano,'' violinist Isaac Stern
said on Berlin's 100th birthday.
   So timeless was his appeal that his songs have become hits over
and over, performed by such artists as Frank Sinatra, Barbra
Streisand and Diana Ross. ASCAP records show 25 of his songs have
topped the popular music charts.
   ``Blue Skies,'' a top hit when he penned it in 1926, reached the
charts again 51 years later on an album by country singer Willie
Nelson.
   Berlin played the piano by ear and never stopped making what he
described as ``songs with heart.'' Even in his 90s, he talked of
adding yet another musical to his credits, which included 19 stage
musicals and 15 movie scores.
   At his peak, one smash followed another so readily that Cole
Porter once said Berlin ``can't help but write hits.''
   Berlin, along with 11 other American immigrants, received a medal
from President Reagan during the Statue of Liberty centennial
celebrations in July 1986.
   Reagan the actor was featured in the mammoth, flag-waving 1943
movie musical ``This is the Army,'' with songs from Berlin.
   ``Nancy and I are deeply saddened by the death of a wonderfully
talented man whose musical genius delighted and stirred millions,
and will live on forever,'' Reagan said.
   Always a private man, Berlin declined to attend a Carnegie Hall
gala, led by Sinatra and Leonard Bernstein, to mark his 100th
birthday on May 11, 1988.
   He was mourned by artists from across the spectrum of American
music.
   ``Irving Berlin was the greatest Tin Pan Alley songwriter,'' said
opera singer Robert Merrill, who also sings Berlin's songs. ``He was
not a great musician but he had a great ear and he had a feeling for
melody and words that was precious.''
   Composer Burt Bacharach, who wrote the 1969 Academy Award-winning
song ``Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head'' said, ``This is a great
loss. But Irving Berlin has left us with the greatest legacy through
his music.''
   ``One could hear the dancing by just singing the lyrics,''
cabaret singer Bobby Short said. ``He is perhaps the last of the
giants _ and I think that's not a bad way to go.''
   Actress and dancer Ginger Rogers remembered Berlin with a bit of
song from his ``Cheek to Cheek,'' from the movie ``Top Hat.''
   ``I'm in heaven,'' she sang, then broke off. ``It was like
heaven,'' she said, describing the thrill of working with the likes
of Berlin and Fred Astaire.
   The biggest names on Broadway played in his musical successes,
which began in the World War I era with ``Watch Your Step,''
starring Irene and Vernon Castle, and ran through such post-World
War II hits as ``Annie Get Your Gun'' and ``Call Me Madam,'' both
with Ethel Merman.
   ``A Pretty Girl Is Like A Melody,'' one of many Berlin wrote for
the Ziegfeld Follies, became the unofficial theme song for every
Ziegfeld extravaganza.
   In Hollywood, Berlin did the scores of ``Top Hat,'' starring
Astaire and Miss Rogers; ``Holiday Inn'' with Astaire and Bing
Crosby; ``Blue Skies''; ``Easter Parade''; ``White Christmas''; and
``There's No Business Like Show Business.''
   His last Broadway show was ``Mr. President'' in 1962. His last
song, ``An Old Fashioned Wedding,'' was published in 1966.
   His music-publishing empire earned him a fortune, which he
readily shared with his country in wartime or with favorite causes.
Since 1939 the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of America have been
getting the royalties from ``God Bless America.''
   Berlin was awarded three medals for his works and a special Tony
award for his contribution to the musical theater. He won a
congressional medal for the acclaimed World War II musical, ``This
is the Army,'' and the Academy Award for best song of 1942 for
``White Christmas.''
   Explaining the seemingly endless gusher of successful songs,
Berlin said his tunes were merely rewrites of a handful of his best
numbers. ``All good songwriters have no more than half a dozen good
tunes in their systems, and if they have that many they're liberally
blessed,'' he once said.
   Berlin never learned to read or write music and his piano playing
was confined to the key of F sharp. He called songwriting hard work,
but director Josh Logan once recalled that Berlin dashed off the
first verse of ``Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better'' during a
six-minute cab ride.
   Celebrity and wealth didn't seem to touch the shy personality of
the intense, short man with wavy, slicked-down hair and dark
glasses. He lived a simple life, centered on his songwriting and his
family _ his late wife, Ellin, and their three daughters.
   Berlin was brought up in poverty amid the immigrant swarm on
Manhattan's Lower East Side. Born Israel Baline on May 11, 1888, he
was 5 when his family emigrated from Temun in eastern Russia. He was
one of eight children and acquired his earliest musical education
from his father, a cantor. But his father's death put an end to
Berlin's formal education and, at age 8, he went from the second
grade to the streets to earn a living.
   Known as Izzy, Berlin sold newspapers, guided a blind, singing
beggar and worked in vaudeville. In 1907, he wrote the words to his
first song, ``Marie of Sunny Italy'' in collaboration with the piano
player at the Chinatown bar where he worked as a singing waiter.
   The song earned him 37 cents in royalties and a new name _ the
sheet music cover erroneously credited the words to ``I. Berlin.''
   In 1911, at the age of 23, he was contributing songs to the
Ziegfeld Follies. His ``Alexander's Ragtime Band'' with its ``ragged
meter'' ushered jazz onto the popular scene and established Berlin
as a master of Tin Pan Alley.
   Berlin's marriage to Dorothy Goetz the following year ended after
six months when his bride died of typhoid contracted during their
honeymoon in Havana. In his grief, Berlin composed ``When I Lost
You.''
   His marriage in 1926 to Ellin Mackay followed one of the most
widely reported courtships of the decade. His wife's father, a
prominent Roman Catholic layman and head of Postal Telegraph Co.,
had opposed the union.
   Berlin's wife died of a stroke at age 85 in July 1988. Berlin is
survived by his three daughters, Mary Ellin, Linda and Elizabeth.
   Services will be private, said Bill Hartgrove, evening manager at
the Frank Campbell funeral home in Manhattan.

POP STAR AND WRITER IN DISCORD OVER SONG 
</P>

<TEXT>

Pop singer-composer Stevie Wonder, accused in a lawsuit of stealing the song "I 
Just Called to Say I Love You," testified Thursday in federal court that he got 
the idea for the hit tune in 1976 while being driven to a hotel in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Wonder, 39, who is in the Songwriters' Hall of Fame and has sold millions of 
records, said he created "enough of a working idea for a verse and a chorus" 
during the ride to make a recording of the song the same day -- but that he 
changed the tune over the years and did not record its final version until 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
In a $25-million copyright infringement lawsuit filed in Los Angeles, 
songwriter Lloyd Chiate claims that Wonder pilfered a song that Chiate had 
written in 1976 and converted it into the tune that won a Grammy Award and an 
Academy Award in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Chiate, 40, is a successful songwriter in his own right who has written for the 
Fifth Dimension, Billy Davis Jr., Marilyn McCoo, Eddie Money and Wonder 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Wonder, the first witness called to the stand, said he had left his mother's 
home in the San Fernando Valley and was on his way to Hollywood when the song 
came to him. 
</P>
<P>
The blind singer, who was born Stevland Morris, acknowledged under oath that 
"various things changed throughout the years" on the song, as they frequently 
do when he is working on one. 
</P>
<P>
"I never completed the song," Wonder said, in response to questioning from 
Chiate's lawyer Herbert Dodell. "I never felt it was complete until I recorded 
it in 1984." 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a black-and-brown checked jacket and turtleneck sweater and with his 
hair tied in a ponytail, Wonder compared his song-writing process to the way a 
painter creates a painting. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dodell presented a different account in his opening statement 
Wednesday before U.S. District Judge David W. Williams. The case is being heard 
by a six-member jury. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney said Chiate and a partner, Lee Garrett, composed a song called 
"Hello It's Me, I Just Called to Say" in 1976 that is "strikingly similar" to 
Wonder's hit. 
</P>
<P>
Dodell said that Garrett, an old friend of Wonder's who also is blind, played a 
tape of the song for Wonder in 1977 after Wonder stopped a depressed Garrett 
from committing suicide. Asked about the incident Thursday, Wonder said he 
"honestly" could not remember what was discussed that day. 
</P>
<P>
Chiate and Garrett registered a song called "I Just Called to Say" with 
Broadcast Music Inc. in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
They sued Wonder in 1985, but Garrett dropped out of the lawsuit a year later. 
Dodell said Garrett had made a deal with Wonder in which he gave him a license 
to use the song "I Just Called to Say" in return for money and musical 
equipment. Garrett is expected to testify for Wonder at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Dodell pressed Wonder on a letter that Wonder supposedly wrote to the Academy 
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1984 using the name Stevland Morris. The 
letter states that Wonder wrote the song in 1984, making it eligible for an 
Academy Award. 
</P>
<P>
Wonder denied writing the letter. He said it had been written by a lawyer who 
no longer represents him. 
</P>
<P>
Wonder is scheduled to resume his testimony today.

   Admirers remembered Irving Berlin upon his death
as the heart and soul of American pop music, and said his songs
such as ``White Christmas,'' ``Blue Skies,'' and ``God Bless
America'' will never die.
   The Russian cantor's son who wrote nearly 1,000 songs died
Friday night in his Manhattan townhouse at age 101.
   Much of his music was written for stage and movie musicals, but
dozens of his songs have been performed over and over from Las
Vegas cabarets to country-western bars.
   Among his songs are ``Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' ``Always,''
``Mandy,'' ``Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better,'' ``There's No
Business Like Show Business,'' ``Cheek to Cheek,'' ``I've Got My
Love to Keep Me Warm,'' ``Heat Wave'' and ``A Pretty Girl is Like a
Melody.''
   ``It's become part of our language, part of our heartbeat, part
of our soul,'' said composer-conductor Morton Gould, president of
the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, which
Berlin helped found.
   ``Your songs will be with us always,'' the organization said in
a full-page advertisement in The New York Times today.
   ``Very few people have come to touch and move the soul of a
nation,'' said President Bush, who joined a crowd of thousands in
Boston singing ``God Bless America'' in honor of the songwriter
Saturday. ``Mr. Berlin ranks among such people, a composer, a
legendary man whose words and music will help define the history of
our nation.''
   ``This is a great loss,'' said composer Burt Bacharach. ``But
Irving Berlin has left us with the greatest legacy through his
music.''
   Broadway theaters dimmed their lights Saturday night in tribute.
   On Sunday, more than 100 people held a candlelight serenade
outside Berlin's Manhattan townhouse. There was no indication if
anyone was home.
   ``There was sobbing. You can't avoid it,'' said John Wallowitch,
a composer and cabaret singer who led the group. He also has
organized serenades outside Berlin's home at Christmas and on his
birthday for about 20 years, ``but I never wanted to do it for this
reason.''
   Born Israel Baline on May 11, 1888, he was 5 when his family
emigrated from Temun in eastern Russia to New York. The death of
his father forced Berlin him to start working at age 8. He worked
in vaudeville, and as a singing waiter.
   In 1907, he published his first song, ``Marie of Sunny Italy,''
and he had his first hit in 1911 with ``Alexander's Ragtime Band.''
   Some of his songs have become pop hits across the generations.
His ``Puttin' on the Ritz,'' made the charts when it was revived in
1983 by the Dutch singer Taco, and his 1926 composition ``Blue
Skies'' helped get an album by country singer Willie Nelson on the
charts in 1978.
   Berlin was an immigrant Russian whose ``God Bless America''
became the nation's unofficial second national anthem. He was a Jew
whose ``White Christmas'' and ``Easter Parade'' became Christian
holiday traditions.
   Though he never learned to read music, he wrote 19 stage
musicals and 15 movie scores. Twenty-five of his songs have topped
the popular music charts, according to ASCAP.
   Berlin got a medal during the Statue of Liberty centennial in
July 1986 from then-President Reagan, who appeared in the
Berlin-scored 1943 movie musical ``This is the Army.''
   The biggest names on Broadway played in his musical successes,
which began in the World War I era with ``Watch Your Step,''
starring Irene and Vernon Castle, and ran through such post-World
War II hits as ``Annie Get Your Gun'' and ``Call Me Madam,'' both
with Ethel Merman.
   ``A Pretty Girl Is Like A Melody,'' one of many Berlin wrote for
the Ziegfeld Follies, became the unofficial theme song for every
Ziegfeld extravaganza.
   In Hollywood, Berlin did the scores of ``Top Hat,'' starring
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers; ``Holiday Inn'' with Astaire and
Bing Crosby; ``Blue Skies''; ``Easter Parade''; ``White
Christmas''; and ``There's No Business Like Show Business.''
   His last Broadway show was ``Mr. President'' in 1962. His last
song, ``An Old Fashioned Wedding,'' was published in 1966.
   Berlin was awarded three medals for his music and a special Tony
award for his contribution to the musical theater. His won a
congressional medal for the World War II musical ``This is the
Army,'' and the Academy Award for best song of 1942 for ``White
Christmas.''
   His second wife, the former Ellin Mackay, died in 1988 after 62
years of marriage. Berlin is survived by his three daughters, Mary
Ellin, Linda and Elizabeth.

   Forty years ago, when the late songwriter Johnny Marks penned
his first draft of ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,'' he was
unhappy with it _ so unhappy he thought it was the worst song he
ever wrote.
   In fact, Marks' dissatisfaction was such that he put the song
aside and didn't get back to it until the following year.
   But in 1949, while humming the melody during a walk near his
home in New York's Greenwich Village, the composer hit upon a
solution:
   Instead of having the notes in the unsatisfactory opening bars
dropping down the scale, he reversed the progression and had them
go up.
   Asked how long it took to complete the new version, Marks
replied:
   ``It took me only two weeks, but 20 years of songwriting to
learn what to throw away.''
   Since then, ``Rudolph'' has been a spectacular success.
   According to one record industry source, it has been translated
into nearly every language and sold approximately 150 million
records, more than 8 million copies of sheet music and 25 million
copies of 200 arrangements for orchestras, bands and choral groups.
   Gene Autry first recorded it and gave the first live performance
of the song at a rodeo at New York's Madison Square Garden,
changing the finale of his show from ``Ghost Riders in the Sky'' to
``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.''
   Marks, who died in 1985, often was called ``Mr. Christmas of the
music world.'' Among his other holiday compositions were ``I Heard
the Bells on Christmas Day,'' ``Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree''
and ``A Holly Jolly Christmas.''
   Perhaps the most memorable of Christmas songs, however, is
``White Christmas.''
   Sung by Bing Crosby in the 1942 movie, ``Holiday Inn,'' it
became Irving Berlin's greatest hit and resulted in the 1954 movie
``White Christmas,'' starring Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney
and Vera-Ellen.
   Written during World War II, Berlin has said ``it was nostalgic
for a lot of boys who weren't home for Christmas.'' It's been a lot
more than that, perhaps the second most popular Christmas song
ever, to ``Silent Night.''
   In 1973, the International Society of Santa Claus gave its first
award to Marks, for ``Rudolph,'' and Berlin, for ``White
Christmas,'' in recognition of their contribution to the spirit of
Christmas.
   Runners-up were Charles Dickens' ``A Christmas Carol'' and
Clement Moore's ``'Twas the Night Before Christmas.''
   Another Christmas song, ``Silver Bells,'' was written by Jay
Evans and Ray Livingston for Christmas sequences of a Bob Hope film
comedy, ``The Lemon Drop Kid'' (1951). It became the biggest seller
for the song-writing team.
   One of the many joys of the 1944 movie, ``Meet Me in St.
Louis,'' was Judy Garland's singing ``Have Yourself a Merry Little
Christmas'' by Ralph Blane and Hugh Martin.

   Irving Berlin once insisted there were nine
rules to writing popular songs.
   They must be original, easy to sing, easy to remember,
``sexless'' so that a man or woman could perform them and should
have attention-getting titles. But most important, Berlin stated,
``The song writer must look upon his work as a business, that is,
to make a success of it, he must work and work, and then WORK.''
   And he meant it. American music, it seems, was created on a
thousand restless nights by a shy little man with a high voice who
insisted, ``I sweat blood between 3 and 6 many mornings, and when
the drops that fall off my forehead hit the paper they're notes.''
   He liked to write in the evening, sleep in the morning and pitch
songs in the afternoon; sometimes he didn't bother sleeping.
   On a winter's night in 1941, Berlin began working on ``White
Christmas.'' He finished it the next morning and raced over to his
office, telling his stunned transcriber that ``not only is it the
best song I ever wrote, it's the best song anybody ever wrote.''
   Berlin always seemed to have a plan. In 1909, he set himself a
goal of writing four to five songs a night, creating an enormous
backlog of unused or ``trunk songs'' _ ``God Bless America'' among
them.
   Nearly 80 years later, Steven Spielberg tried to negotiate for
film rights to the great love song ``Always,'' but the director was
curtly informed that Berlin wanted to use it for a project _ never
started _ of his own. The movie, also called ``Always,'' was
released in December 1989, three months after the songwriter's
death at age 101.
   What kept him going? According to Laurence Bergreen, author of
the comprehensive biography ``As Thousands Cheer: The Life of
Irving Berlin'' ($24.95, Viking), it wasn't love or greed or even
artistic ambition. The sound of applause, the need for the public's
approval was the songwriter's greatest inspiration, the author said.
   ``He began by singing for pennies and nickels in the sidewalks
of New York,'' explained Bergreen, also author of ``James Agee: A
Life.''
   ``If people liked what he sang they gave him money and if they
didn't like it, they didn't give him money and he didn't eat.
   ``You wrote songs. They were performed, and the audience heard
it. You would stay up all night and fix it to and try to make it
better. That's how you developed, with the immediate feedback.''
   Bergreen raises the same question again and again: How did
Berlin remain so prolific for so long? How did he change with the
times for nearly 40 years until another self-made man named Elvis
Presley redefined popular music and pushed a frustrated Berlin into
retirement?
   ``He was totally market driven,'' Bergreen said. ``I think
what's remarkable is that every 10 years or so he tried to reinvent
himself as a songwriter; popular songwriters then tended to come
and go as quickly as they do now.
   ``He consciously adapted himself to changing styles. Ragtime in
the 'teens (`Alexander's Ragtime Band') to sob songs in the '20s
(`Always') to romantic ballads (`Cheek to Cheek') in the '30s. In
the '40s, you notice a pronounced influence of swing music (`I Got
the Sun in the Morning').''
   Irving Berlin was born Israel Baline on May 11, 1888, the son of
a Russian cantor and one of eight children. His family emigrated to
the United States in 1893 and settled into the heavily populated
Jewish community of Manhattan's Lower East Side.
   While his parents and siblings stuck to the ways of the old
country, even speaking in Yiddish, Berlin raced into the new world,
hustling to get out of his family's cramped, dirty tenement as
quickly as possible and make it to the classy world that waited
uptown.
   He hawked newspapers, spoke in colorful New York slang, earned
coins as a singing waiter. Eventually, he changed his name and
tried writing his own songs, reasoning, ``Once you start singing,
you start thinking of writing songs, it's as simple as that.''
   He wrote his first song, ``Marie From Sunny Italy,'' in 1908 and
soon joined a music publishing house called Waterson &amp; Snyder. In
1911, Berlin contributed four songs to the Ziegfield Follies, and
hammered out ``Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' a lively update of the
``classic'' ragtime made popular by Scott Joplin in 1899.
   Like any quick-thinking kid, Berlin was looking for an angle, a
gimmick _ some way to grab onto a trend _ and seized on ragtime as
the answer. But he was also willing to take chances, play with the
rules and invent the rules.
   ``Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' the name inspired by the
derogatorially named ``coon'' songs that had ``Alexander'' in the
title, combined popular black and white music, mixing ragtime and
march. The chorus ran 32 bars, double the usual length, and the
song changed key in mid-course, another innovation.
   ``I humbly began to study my own song, asking myself, `Why?'
`Why?','' Berlin recalled in 1915, reflecting on its international
success.
   ``And I got an answer. ... It's opening words, emphasized by
immediate repitition _ `Come on and hear! Come on and hear!' _ were
an invitation to `come' and join in, and `hear' the singer and his
song.''
   ``There were distinctive yard marks in his songs that you could
see,'' Bergreen said. ```Puttin' on the Ritz' on the one hand and
`God Bless America' as the other. You had anthems of basic American
events: `White Christmas,' `Easter Parade'; ragtime songs like
`Alexander's Ragtime Band.'
   ``And there was the counterpoint song, `Just in Love,' `Play a
Simple Melody,' `An Old Fashioned Wedding.' There were two songs
kind of going at the same time, two singers singing against each
other.''
   Berlin could neither read nor write music and his business
skills were equally crude, equally effective. He had dropped out of
school at age 14 to earn money and had to scramble around town,
pitching his songs to publishers; until his death in 1989, his
office never had a computer.
   But if Berlin sweated blood as a businessman, the drops that
fell quickly turned to cash. He realized early on that publishing
was where the most money could be made and held on stubbornly to
the rights of his songs, boasting for years that he received the
highest royalty payments in the nation.

<HEAD>`Popeye' Theme Creator Sammy Lerner Dead at 86</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sammy Lerner, the Hollywood songwriter whose
lyrics ``I'm strong to the finich 'cause I eats me spinach''
created a loyal following for Popeye the Sailor Man, has died of
cancer. He was 86.
   Lerner died Wednesday at a Los Angeles nursing home, said a
spokeswoman for the American Society of Composers, Authors and
Publishers.
   The serious songwriter said he was horrified by the 1932 theme
``I'm Popeye the Sailor Man,'' which he composed in less than two
hours for cartoonist Dave Fleischer.
   ``When I saw that first cartoon, I wanted to crawl in a
corner,'' Lerner said in a 1977 interview. ```Just do me a favor,'
I said. `Don't put my name on the screen.'''
   Lerner was as adept at nonsense cartoon lyrics as he was with
the romantic and breezy standards of Tin Pan Alley.
   His work in the 1930s and 1940s included ``Is It True What They
Say About Dixie,'' a song immortalized by Al Jolson, and English
lyrics to ``Falling in Love Again,'' Marlene Dietrich's song in the
film, ``The Blue Angel.''
   Lerner also wrote the theme for Betty Boop and a number of
``bouncing ball'' musical cartoon songs.
   Born in Saveni, Romania, in 1903, Lerner emigrated with his
family to Detroit, where he attended Wayne State University.
   He began writing songs for vaudeville acts and lyrics for the
Ziegfeld Follies stage shows in New York. Soon he was composing
lyrics for cartoons in Hollywood and songs for film musicals,
including ``Blondie Meets the Boss,'' ``The Lady Vanishes'' and
``Lady From Cheyenne.''
   He collaborated with such popular composers as Hoagy Carmichael,
Richard Whiting, Gerald Marks, Irving Caesar and Burton Lane.
   Lerner is survived by his wife of 53 years, Dorothy.

   It wasn't a White Christmas, but dozens of fans
who usually sing Christmas carols to composer Irving Berlin
serenaded him at his mansion today at the very start of his 100th
birthday.
   The reclusive composer, who hates to get up in the morning and
wrote a song to that effect, didn't put in an appearance.
   ``If he's 100, he's probably sleeping,'' said Roberta Kaufman,
who had been walking her dog and stopped to see what the crowd of
75 people was doing in front of the five-story brick mansion in
Beekman Place, an exclusive East Side enclave.
   John Wallowitch, who organized the midnight Tuesday serenade and
has organized the Christmas carol singing outside Berlin's door for
at least 20 years, was sure Berlin was awake.
   ``He's a night owl, I've seen him walking his dog at 3 a.m.,''
Wallowitch said.
   Berlin's secretary confirmed that.
   ``When they were there singing, of course he heard them. He was
very thrilled by that,'' Hilda Schneider said at mid-morning. She
added that the composer was spending the day ``quietly at home.
He's never made a big thing about his birthdays.''
   During a singing a somewhat intoxicated reveler yelled
``HAAApppy Birthday Irving'' at the drawn shades of 17 Beekman
Place. ``We love you. Where are youuuuu?''
   Many of those gathered seemed to be neighbors hoping to catch a
rare glimpse of Berlin. Just before the singing began, a shade went
up in the house and the crowd gasped.
   But it was a teen-age girl and a matron. Both waved and the
crowd waved back.
   ``Even if he didn't write a thing, to reach 100 is to be part of
American history,'' said 21-year-old John Wiessman, a junior at New
York University. ``But this guy wrote a lot. I love `God Bless
America.' Every American has got to love it.''
   The music and lyrics among the more than 1,500 songs Berlin
created for the stage, screen and popular music are inextricably
woven into the American culture.
   They include ``White Christmas,'' ``Easter Parade,''
``Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' ``There's No Business Like Show
Business,'' ``Puttin' on the Ritz,'' ``Blue Skies,'' ``Cheek to
Cheek,'' and ``Oh, How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning.''
   In London, the British Parliament honored the composer today
with a motion wishing him ``many more White Christmases and Easter
Parades.''
   Today's informal serenade will be followed tonight by a Carnegie
Hall tribute to the composer, with stars like Frank Sinatra, Isaac
Stern and Ray Charles scheduled to appear.
   Wallowitch got the crowd ready by reading through a song he
composed for the occasion.
   ``Just think, 100 years ago this little Russian lady was very
pregnant,'' he said, referring to Berlin's birth on May 11, 1888,
in Russia. Then he told the crowd to sing ``softly, with great
love.''
   The crowd sang ``Happy Birthday,'' Berlin's ``Always'' and
Wallowitch's ``The Songs of Irving Berlin,'' which included the
broad hint, ``Knock on my door and I'll welcome you in.''
   Nearly five years ago, Wallowitch was invited into the Berlin
home on Christmas Eve after a chorus of ``White Christmas.'' On an
impulse, he rang the doorbell. A maid answered and took him and his
fellow singers into the kitchen.
   There they were greeted by Berlin himself, in bathrobe and
slippers. The composer hugged the men, kissed the women and told
them, ``That's the nicest Christmas present I've ever had.''
   Still no Berlin, so the crowd ran through ``We'll be loving you,
always'' again. Another shade went up but again it was the teen-age
girl.
   ``Hey,'' the drunk said. ``We would love to see Irving. Please
bring him to the window.''
   The dispersing neighbors said they did not really expect to see
him. It's a neighborhood known for its recluses like Greta Garbo.
   Garbo didn't show either.

<HEAD>Memory of Folk Singer Phil Ochs Kept Alive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With America facing the possibility of
another war and the unbound optimism of the 1980s becoming
threadbare, the late Phil Ochs' songs carry the same bite today as
they did two decades ago.
   And they're getting wider play again, at least in the East.
   Verses such as ``So young so strong so ready for the war, so
willing to go and die upon a foreign shore,'' from ``One More
Parade,'' could just as easily be a lament about soldiers marching
off to the Persian Gulf as Southeast Asia.
   And, ``If you can't afford your bill don't tell me that you're
ill, 'cause that's the free enterprise way,'' from the sarcastic
``AMA Song,'' rings a chord for people hit by the spiraling cost of
health care.
   Ochs - sounds like ``oaks'' - wrote those songs in the '60s,
when his gift for composing tuneful poison-pen letters to the
establishment placed him near the top of the heap of popular folk
singers.
   ``I think everybody in the field at the time felt he had a great
influence and was a great writer,'' said Dick Cerri, president of
the World Folk Music Association.
   ``As a songwriter ... he was second to only (Bob) Dylan in the
late '60s,'' said Ochs' brother and former manager, Michael Ochs.
   But when the peace and love spirit of the Woodstock generation
withered in the early '70s, so too did Ochs' spirit. Feeling he
lost touch with his audience and his abilities, he killed himself
in 1976 at the age of 36.
   But this is a case where the old cliche is true: the death
silenced Ochs, but not his music. Old Ochs songs have been ringing
out with regularity the last eight years in clubs from
Massachusetts to the Mason-Dixon line.
   Keeping the spirit of her younger brother alive, Sonny Ochs has
been organizing ``Phil Ochs Song Nights,'' during which old folkies
and younger performers highlight Ochs' extensive song catalog. A
typical performance recently in Albany, less than 40 miles from her
rural Middleburgh home, featured national folk stars Nancy Tucker
and Magpie sharing a club stage with local acts.
   ``I get all these people together through Phil's music,'' Ochs
said.
   She has been organizing the concerts since 1982, when choosing
the line-up for a planned memorial show at the now-defunct
Speakeasy in Manhattan inadvertently fell in her lap.
   ``I picked up the ball and ran with it and I've been running
ever since,'' she said.
   Ochs has since put on shows all over the East.
   ``I just did not want the songs to die. What would have been the
point of his life if no one listened to them anymore?'' she asked.
   Born Dec. 19, 1940, in El Paso, Texas, Phil Ochs was mostly
raised in the East. Following an in-and-out college career, he
headed to where every aspiring folkie headed in the early '60s -
Greenwich Village.
   ``I was very arrogant at the time, and I thought I'd be the best
songwriter in the world,'' he said. ``But then I immediately met
Dylan and decided that I'd be the second-best songwriter in the
world.''
   Ochs built a following on the strength of songs like ``I Ain't
Marchin' Any More'' and ``When I'm Gone.''
   A keen observer and sharp wit in the tradition of Woody Guthrie,
Ochs fired lyrical salvos at everyone from the Nixon administration
to fellow liberals. His acid tongue attracted listeners, but also
scared a lot of people off.
   ``Everyone just assumed he was a raving commie, but he wasn't,''
said Michael Ochs. Not as lovable as Peter, Paul &amp; Mary or as
drop-dead cool as his estranged friend Dylan, Ochs was mostly
ignored by the mass media.
   ``He was censored when he was alive,'' Sonny Ochs said. ``He
couldn't get on national TV or radio.''
   Even without media attention, Ochs could sell out a hall,
including Carnegie Hall three times, and he relied on album sales.
He also maintained a high profile in the civil rights and anti-war
movements.
   But he grew disillusioned when the anti-establishment fervor
faded after the '60s. He moved on to more introspective songs, and
he became depressed.
   ``He felt he didn't fit in anymore,'' Michael Ochs said.
   His sister said Phil felt he lost his gift for writing songs. He
began avoiding live appearances and stopped writing songs.
   ``He refused to even try,'' she said. ``The last three years
were the worst.''
   On April 9, 1976, he hanged himself in his sister's bathroom in
New York City.

Jose was called when fruit trees, not houses, dotted the landscape. One of
those compositions, by Eleanore Schuster, a former concert singer, was
presented to President Truman.;   Several other early composers focused on
California, and at least one picked the entire western United States. "East is
the place where the wise men sit, West where the strong men walk," the song
begins. "West is the place where the young men act, East where the old men
talk.";   Charlotte M. Phelps, a San Jose native who sold real estate, penned
"California I'm in Love With You," which was sung by the Warblers Glee Club,
one of several such groups that came and went until about World War II.;  
Some of the composers stuck to music, devising dance tunes, mostly lively
schottisches, named for local points of interest. There was the Lick
Observatory Schottische by F.M. Lee and the Vendome Schottische, named for a
local luxury hotel, by Lena Sullivan.;   The local music scene was enhanced by
conservatories, independent or affiliated with colleges. There were dozens of
music teachers -- 74 were listed in the city directory in 1905, when San
Jose's population was about 25,000. (Today, 41 music teachers are listed in
the yellow pages.) The area also had a musical kindergarten, a local woman who
made violins, and regular performances by local and imported musicians at
theaters.;   And, in those pre-Nordstrom days, Woolworth's featured live
music. Harriet Huntley Dean played the piano in the dime store's sheet-music
department, one of many places she performed, according to Anne Louise Heigho,
the music volunteer at the historical museum. Dean's collection of sheet music
is among the thousands of pieces, dating from 1840, in the museum's
collection.;   Grand pianos, parlor organs, memorabilia from the King
Conservatory of Music, old Edison phonographs and collections of hymns and
student songs also are among the items in the museum's music collection,
Heigho said.;   The late Leo Sullivan, a fiddler who liked to boast that he
was the first San Jose musician to make a living from his art, recalled some
of the high points of the city's musical history in a small book, "The Musical
Heritage of San Jose," published in 1967.;   In it, he recalls playing at the
last dance at the elegant Vendome Hotel at North First and Empire streets. The
"ritzy affair" broke up about 1 a.m. April 18, 1906, just hours before the
ballroom was destroyed by the massive earthquake.;   Dances provided regular
employment for musicians, who in the early days had to haul their own pianos
to jobs in outlying areas, he wrote.;   Live music began to decline during
World War II, Sullivan said.;   "It is difficult," he wrote, "to grasp what an
important part live music played before mechanization took over."  </TEXT>

   Three failed marriages helped country
music songwriter Sanger D. ``Whitey'' Shafer to compose the
memorable ``All My Ex's Live in Texas.''
   In fact, he wrote the amusing ditty _ recorded by George Strait
_ with his fourth wife's assistance. The 1987 song is probably
Shafer's best known work in a 25-year composing career that's
yielded 200 recorded tunes.
   ``I think I've written something about everything that's ever
been written about,'' the 55-year-old Shafer said recently.
   His wry look at former spouses, embellished by the catchy title,
became one of the most popular country songs of the past decade.
Local country music bands everywhere have the song in their
repertoire.
   The tune also helped Strait win the prestigious ``Entertainer of
the Year'' award from the Country Music Association last year.
   And attention all those ex's: the royalties helped Shafer, too.
   He and current wife, Lyndia, who have been married eight years,
wrote the song about his three ex-wives. It's not malicious, and
listeners tend to feel sorry for the fellow in the song who can't
even return to the river where he learned how to swim.
   ``That's why I hang my hat in Tennessee,'' the song says.
   ``He'd like to go to Texas, but things are kinda hot down
there,'' explained Shafer, born and raised in the Waco, Texas,
area. ``It was a fun song to write. I did change the names to
protect the guilty.''
   The rhyming title, which has become one of the most famous in
country music, is a followup to a punchy line he wrote in the 1970s
for another song: ``I was following the rodeos in Texas and being
chased by the fathers of my ex's.''
   ``Some titles don't tell the whole story, but this one did,''
said Shafer, who got the nickname ``Whitey'' in high school because
of his light-colored hair.
   He gives Strait, a fellow Texan, credit for taking a chance on
the song others considered inappropriate.
   ``I think if he had not have cut that, it would never have been
recorded,'' Shafer said. ``People are funny about cutting cute
songs, but that one just had something about it. It was too cute to
pass up.
   ``I wish I had a bushel basket full like that one.''
   The inevitable question is whether his three ex-wives really do
live in Texas and how they reacted to the song. ``They do live
there, but one sort of drifts back and forth between California and
Texas,'' Shafer said.
   He's not sure how two of them feel, but ex-wife Darlene took it
fine.
   ``We're still friends,'' he said.
   Last year, Shafer wrote the hit song ``I Wonder Do You Think of
Me,'' which was the first tune released by country singer Keith
Whitley after Whitley died in May of an accidental overdose of
alcohol. It was a No. 1 record.
   ``I liked him a whole lot and he'd been to my house a lot when
he first came to town,'' Shafer said. ``He was a heck of a talent,
a great singer and was only getting better as he went on. He also
had a great personality.''
   Some of Shafer's other top songs include ``Does Fort Worth Ever
Cross Your Mind,'' recorded by Strait; ``That's the Way Love
Goes,'' a No. 1 country music record by both Merle Haggard and
Johnny Rodriguez; and ``I Never Go Around Mirrors,'' also recorded
by Whitley.
   Shafer moved to Nashville from Texas in the mid-1960s with the
idea of becoming a singer. He did some performing, but found the
competition stiff.
   ``There were too many singers,'' he recalled. So he turned to
songwriting.
   ``For some reason, I've always been able to retain a string of
notes I've heard,'' he said. ``It just seems like I know what kind
of idea will go with a certain melody.''
   Shafer, who recently was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters
Hall of Fame, describes himself as a writer of traditional country
music with little interest in pop oriented styles. Give him a few
beers and his favorite instrument and he'll come up with a country
song.
   ``It just seemed like a guitar and six pack went together,'' he
said.
   ``Right now I like to write love songs because I'm in love. When
I was rough and rowdy, I wrote rough and rowdy songs.''
   But he says country music's honky-tonk songs glorifying alcohol,
such as Hank Williams' ``There's a Tear in My Beer,'' aren't as
popular as they used to be.
   ``Drinking and getting drunk is not hip any more. People don't
like to see it. It's almost indignant to be tipsy. People just
don't want to mess with people who can't control their lives.''

   Irving Berlin created the American popular song.
   Until Berlin began writing after the turn of the century,
American music was dominated by Europe _ English music hall, Gilbert
and Sullivan, Viennese operetta and Italian opera. Berlin took
native American sounds, such as ragtime, and turned them into huge
popular hits like ``Alexander's Ragtime Band'' and ``Everybody's
Doin' It Now.'' When Irving Berlin wrote, America listened _ for
more than 50 years.
   ``He caught the voices of the people early in this century and
held them for longer than anyone else,'' Robert Kimball, musical
theater historian, said Friday.
   From his first song, ``Marie of Sunny Italy,'' in 1907 to his
last Broadway show, ``Mr. President,'' in 1962, Berlin's presence
was felt on the music scene in this country. No one today can look
to such a long period of domination.
   And Berlin was a winner in every medium he tried. He found
success not only in Tin Pan Alley but on Broadway with musicals like
``Annie Get Your Gun,'' ``Call Me Madam'' and his Music Box revues,
and in Hollywood where he wrote the scores for Fred Astaire-Ginger
Rogers movies like ``Top Hat'' and ``Follow the Fleet'' and other
films like ``Holiday Inn'' and ``Easter Parade.''
   His colleagues thought he was the best, particularly
contemporaries like Jerome Kern. He had an enormous influence on the
Broadway composers who followed him, especially George Gershwin and
Harold Arlen who relished his inventive way with rhythm.
   Berlin also had an incredible versatility, a great intelligence
and perspective about the world. He could write any kind of song _ a
stirring, patriotic anthem like ``God Bless America,'' a seasonal
standard like ``White Christmas,'' a comic theater ditty like
``Doin' What Comes Natur'lly,'' an unbashedly sentimental favorite
like ``Always'' or a complex love song like ``Let's Face the Music
and Dance.''
   ``He was a folk singer and he was able to absorb whatever was
happening in the street and bring it out, even more than Stephen
Foster,'' said Edward Jablonski, a good friend of Berlin's and the
author of several books on American theater composers. ``He was an
ordinary man who was able to write songs. That's why he appealed so
much to people.
   ``But he also made a point of not being a well-educated musician.
He was a born musician, which is a hard thing to be. So he could be
more sophisticated that he ever thought he was.''
   Berlin also was a shrewd businessman. He was a charter member and
served on the first board of directors for ASCAP, the American
Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, which collects
songwriting royalties. Before 1920, he had formed his own music
publishing company which published all of his music. And at the time
of his death, he was still co-owner of the Music Box Theater, a
Broadway theater he built in 1921. As late as two years ago, he
would call up the box office at the Music Box to see how the grosses
were going.
   But it will be for his music that he will be remembered.
   ``I would think Irving Berlin is the most admired songwriter
America has produced in this century _ and maybe ever,'' Kimball
said.

Oz).;   Menken and Ashman completed the score for "Aladdin," Disney's next
animated musical, before his death. However, the story subsequently has been
revised, necessitating the writing of new songs, Menken said.;   Menken is
collaborating on the new material with Tim Rice, who has written lyrics for a
number of Andrew Lloyd Webber shows.;   Menken said Ashman never wrote an
anti-AIDS statement into his songs, but he said he sometimes hears echoes of
his collaborator's struggles in his lyrics.;   "The last song we wrote for
'Aladdin' is called 'Humiliate the Boy,' " he noted. "(The villain) is
stripping the boy of all the powers that he had.;   "At the time, Howard was
being stripped of all his abilities," he said quietly. (box)  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   This week, as everyone knows by now, America's greatest living songwriter turned 100. 
And Wednesday evening the royalty of musical America trooped to the big birthday party here at Carnegie Hall for Irving Berlin. 
It was a stirring, emotional, and perhaps historic procession: Leonard Bernstein, Frank Sinatra, Isaac Stern, Tony Bennett, Ray Charles, Marilyn Horne, Jule Styne, Hal Davis, Sammy Cahn, Irving Caesar, Burton Lane, the Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts and the Army. 
But Mr. Berlin spent the evening at home, nine blocks east on Beekman Place. 

   The producers of the birthday program would have settled for even a call. 
But by 10:30, the $1,000-a-seat crowd was left all alone by the telephone. 

   While I don't mean to criticize Mr. Berlin for his absence, I can't help thinking there comes a time in every great man's life when his need to be honored declines in inverse proportion to the need of everybody else to honor him. 
Mr. Berlin's is such a case. 
He's lived long enough to watch five generations embrace his music. 
Long enough to see the impact of his work penetrate our civilization so that his stature has transcended any conceivable homage that might be paid. 
So of course, the challenge to try becomes irresistible. 

   Irving Berlin began life as a Russian Jew in czarist Siberia and rose to become a vastly wealthy musical empire: Berlin melodies with Berlin lyrics published by Berlin Music Inc. 
A great melody has an ineluctable logic about it that makes it seem predestined from the first note. 
It's Mr. Berlin's astonishing powers of alchemy that have converted the neutrality of the diatonic scale into so many nuances of logic and emotion. 
So the world has given him the best it could give in trade for his tunes -- fame, money, recognition beyond comprehension. 
And when the world could give him no more, fate added time and good health to his gifts. 

   Chronologically, he is the second of the six great writers who have defined the classic American song: coming after Jerome Kern (1885) and just before Cole Porter (1892), George Gershwin (1898), Richard Rodgers (1902) and Harold Arlen (1905). 
He's survived them all, as well as numberless trends and the institution of Tin Pan Alley that launched him. 
He's even outlived some of his own copyrights ("Alexander's Ragtime Band," 1911). 
But he hasn't outlived the appeal of his music, which for all its apparent simplicity, defies typecasting. 

   If Mr. Berlin is to song as Norman Rockwell is to art or Frank Capra is to film, as some like to say, then how do we account for the unexpected Berlin of "Supper Time," the stylish Berlin of "Cheek to Cheek," the ironic Berlin of "Change Partners," or the chromatic Berlin of "White Christmas"? 
If great writers write in bold signatures, then Mr. Berlin writes with invisible ink. 

   Mr. Berlin was not an auteur. 
He was a pro, a craftsman. 
His vision was directed outward. 
Songs are products, not art. 
He sometimes even plagiarized his own hits ("Alexander's Bagpipe Band," 1912). 
"Give the public what it wants," he would say. 
The customer is always right. 
Pianist Dick Hyman -- whose new album of Berlin music on Musicmasters joins other centennial efforts by Tony Bennett (CBS), Michael Feinstein (Parnassus), and Elizabeth Welch (Verve), and practically everybody else in the CBS two-LP anthology "A Hundred Years" -- says: "Among his peers, Berlin has the least musical education. 
It was sheer native genius that took him to the levels of sophistication he reached, yet he still kept his feet on the street. 
Gershwin, for instance, was well grounded in theory and consciously reached for the innovations he achieved. 
Berlin, I believe, came to his almost instinctively. 
He could move in and out of melodic formulas according to his own higher logic." 

   The power of Mr. Berlin's melodies sometimes leads us to underestimate the power of his words. 
But the wrong words mean the wrong song. 
In 1917 he wrote a forgotten failure called "Smile and Show Your Dimple." 
In 1933 he reintroduced the same tune outfitted in new words: "In your Easter bonnet . . ." "He was a poet," says composer Morton Gould. "'All alone by the telephone' tells you everything there is to know about loneliness in the 20th century." 
Mr. Gould's comment was borne out Wednesday when Garrison Keillor merely recited the words to the Carnegie Hall audience. 

   If his years and eminence have rewarded him, though, they've also isolated him. 
As his contemporaries and peers have died, so have the camaraderie and shared experience that kept him moving with the world. 
When there's no one left outside of George Abbott, 101, who feels comfortable calling you by your first name, that's isolation. 
Happily, Mr. Berlin still has his wife of 62 years and his three daughters. 
Beyond them and a tight circle of associates, however, Mr. Berlin holds the world at bay, walled off in a silken cocoon of nonnegotiable privacy two blocks south of America's other most famous recluse, Greta Garbo. 
There he sits like the High Lama of Shangri-La as absolute master of his own self-created domain. 
He wouldn't even allow a closed-circuit feed from Carnegie Hall set up in his home Wednesday. 
Those few with access become like monks when asked about any aspect of Mr. Berlin's private life or current activities. 
Even the songs he reportedly still writes are a state secret. 
Incredibly, not one biographer has so far managed to penetrate the code of silence to produce a serious Berlin biography. 

   "He feels pretty good," a spokeswoman said two weeks ago in a brief phone interview. 
She then asked that her name not be used in this column. 

   Mr. Berlin has been a member of ASCAP since its founding in 1914, and he still remains active in its affairs. 
But even ASCAP President Morton Gould, 79, has never actually met Mr. Berlin. 
Mr. Gould's predecessor, lyricist Hal David, who served from 1980 to 1986, says, "My whole relationship with him has been a telephone friendship. 
I've never actually seen him. 
He would call me about things he read in the trades or heard through the grapevine. 
He likes to talk about his contemporaries like Harold Arlen too." 

   Now he'll be helping preserve them all. 
Proceeds from the centennial will benefit the ASCAP Foundation and Carnegie Hall Society. 
On Friday, May 27, CBS will telecast Wednesday's gala in a two-hour special.

<MEMO>  Martinez is a columnist for the Los Angeles Times.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     They had come to Los Angeles from New York as they said they would, and had
unpacked their dreams in a city where dreams are supposed to come true.;    It
was a magic time for the young married couple. Music floated through their
lives like ribbons of gold. Guy played the keyboard and was hired by a band.
Marilyn worked in an office during the day and went to school at night. She
was studying musical engineering, but aimed for a singing career. Their dream
was that Guy would have his own band in the Happy-Ever-After and Marilyn would
be his vocalist.;    He wrote her a song she fell in love with, and she
promised someday she'd perform it on stage, backed by Guy. He called it,
appropriately, "Fairy Tales.";    "Talk to stuffed animals, -- Can't they be
real? -- Make believe you live with them -- For always. . . .";    Marilyn was
the kind of person who believed what the lyrics implied, that dreams and
reality can be joined by just closing your eyes and clicking your heels. But
after two years in the City of Angels, something began going wrong.;    The
long, late hours spent apart, once perceived as the sacrifice that would make
their dream come true, clawed at the fabric of their marriage and, in the end,
destroyed it. They were divorced.;    "It was strange," Guy says today. "We
were getting so close to what we wanted, and then I woke up one morning and it
was gone.";    He never believed the fairy tale was over, and maybe it wasn't.
But a harsher reality intruded before the tale could continue. Marilyn
Galloway, still chasing a dream, was murdered.;    By any measure, hers was
not a significant death in a city that records three homicides every day of
the year. Marilyn and 12-year-old Jose Morales, a son from a previous
marriage, were found stabbed in their tiny stucco home in a rundown area of
the waterfront.;    There was no apparent motive. The killer is still at
large.;    As brutal as they were, their murders weren't prime time news. The
Los Angeles Times carried a brief notice in a suburban edition. That was it.; 
  Marilyn and her son had become statistics, certificates of death, a police
problem.;    But there are those who will not allow to pass unsung lives that
once burned with special fire.;    "I am the mother and grandmother of the
mother and son slain Dec. 2, 1990 in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles,"
Marilyn Sloane wrote from her home in Jamesville, N.Y.;    "I have searched
for evidence of a story on their murder and can find nothing. It is upsetting
to me to that this awful crime could go unreported.;    "The people of Los
Angeles should know that someone murdered a young mother and her child and
brought a nightmare to my family. . . .";    She sent photographs. Marilyn's
face, dark-eyed, smiling whimsically, stares out from its final imprint. Her
boy wears a tie. His expression is hesitant, uncertain. I telephoned Sloane to
say that their deaths had been reported. She thanked me and said, "But is that
enough?";    I guess not.;    Marilyn Galloway was one of those free spirits
whose existence was somehow larger than her surroundings. Her highs were
higher and her lows lower than almost everyone else's.;    She was a joking,
teasing tomboy, her mother says, who often came home tattered and bruised from
the risks she willingly took. She challenged life. She dared it to be
different.;    "I never knew anyone so open to adventure," Sloane told me.
"She was never afraid. Could that have been her problem?;    "The last time
she phoned, she had just moved into a new place and was going to school. She
said, 'I'm excited, mom. Everything's going to be OK.' A few days later, we
got a call from the coroner's office. . . .";    What her daughter wanted more
than anything, her mother remembers, was a place for herself.;    "That's what
she was looking for when she went to L.A., her place . . . but she never found
it, and now she never will.";    Guy thinks about Marilyn every time he hears
the song he wrote. "Fairy Tales" runs through his memory like a half-forgotten
dream.;    "Marilyn was beautiful and I still love her," he says. "We broke up
for all the wrong reasons, but I always thought I'd get her back.";    He
repeats the words of his song, softly and with feeling: "It's always true, --
fairy tales were made -- for me and you.";    And then he falls silent,
remembering. . . .  </TEXT>

   A federal jury Thursday rejected a $25
million claim that pop star Stevie Wonder's Oscar-winning 1984 song
``I Just Called to Say I Love You'' was stolen from another
songwriter.
   The plaintiff, Lloyd Chiate, claimed Wonder's song, part of the
movie soundtrack for ``Woman in Red,'' was stolen from a song he
co-wrote titled, ``I Just Called To Say.''
   ``I knew the truth in my heart all along,'' said Wonder, who
attended the two-week trial and testified on his own behalf. ``I'm
very sorry a lot of people had to spend a lot of precious time in
this courtroom. But I do appreciate and respect justice.''
   Wonder offered to try to smooth over the dispute by writing a
song with Chiate and Lee Garrett, co-author of ``I Just Called To
Say,'' and donate the proceeds to charity.
   ``Then we all really win,'' Wonder said. ``It is far easier to
love than to hate.''
   Chiate, 40, sued Wonder in 1985 under the superstar's real name,
Steveland Morris, for copyright infringement, claiming that Wonder
pilfered ``I Just Called To Say,'' co-written by Lee Garrett, after
Wonder heard the song in 1977.
   Wonder, 39, denied stealing the song, which won an Academy Award
in 1984. He said he wrote ``I Just Called to Say I Love You'' long
before hearing the Chiate-Garrett composition and without any
influence from the song.
   Chiate wasn't present when the jury announced its verdict. His
attorney said his client was wronged by a star-struck jury and a
biased judge who had originally dismissed the lawsuit but was
overruled by an appeals court.
   ``I don't think that Mr. Chiate ever got a fair trial,'' said
lawyer Herbert Dodell. ``The result was inevitable, a terrible
miscarriage of justice.''
   Jury foreman Robert Apfelzweig, 39, a research scientist from
Pasadena, said the jury didn't find any evidence that Wonder had
access to the Chiate-Garrett song and the two songs were ``quite
dissimilar.''
   ``Mr. Chiate's case started weak and got weaker,'' said
Apfelzweig.
   Chiate contended that Wonder first had access to Chiate and
Garrett's music during the summer of 1977, when Garrett played
Wonder a tape recording of his music after the latter had talked
Garrett out of committing suicide one night.
   Garrett and Wonder are boyhood friends. Garrett originally was
named as a plaintiff in the suit, but he dropped out and testified
for Wonder.
   Wonder testified in the courtroom of U.S. District Judge David
W. Williams that he wrote much of ``I Just Called to Say I Love
You'' on July 16, 1976, while being driven from his mother's San
Fernando Valley home.
   It was at least a year, perhaps two, before he heard the song
Chiate and Garrett wrote, he said.
   Wonder said that he later polished and recorded ```I Just Called
to Say I Love You,'' which became a big hit and also won a Grammy.

<MEMO>  WEST CLOSE-UPS; INTERVIEW  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     A. I think of myself as being an interpreter of classic American pop songs,
from an archival and historical viewpoint. My approach to a classic song is
not clinical -- I take liberties with it, I do my own interpretation -- but my
focus is on approaching it with an understanding of, and respect for, the
composer's intentions. My concerts differ somewhat from my albums -- in
performance I'm able to do much more in the way of shaping the presentation
with anecdotes and humor.;   Q. Why was the American popular music of the
first half of the century, especially from the '20s to the '40s, so
memorable?;   A. One reason, I think, was the creative atmosphere in New York
City in those years. New York bred those guys, those composers. They
articulated the diversity and pace in the city that was generated byall the
immigrant groups. Jewish immigrants had gotten into the music publishing
business in the late 19th century because the industry was largely
unorganized; they could get into it without facing prejudice. One of the
things the composers did was articulate a desire of the immigrants to be very
American. So you had many very patriotic songs, like Irving Berlin's "God
Bless America," which he wrote in 1917, although he didn't present it to the
world until 1938.;   Q. You've spoken of Irving Berlin as a man who changed
the world.;   A. His songs had immense influence around the world.
"Alexander's Ragtime Band" was one of the first songs to be an international
hit. Songs like "White Christmas" and "Easter Parade" and so many others --
hundreds of them! -- have influenced many, many people and brought them
together. Berlin was divinely inspired, there's no doubt of that in my mind,
but he was also out to write hits. He wrote 1,500 songs, which is just
staggering to me, especially when you realize how good most of them are. Ira
Gershwin, for whom I worked in the late '70s, always said that Berlin's
ability with lyrics was exceptional and perhaps underrated -- Ira said that
Berlin would have been considered a great songwriter as a lyricist even if
he'd never written a tune.;   Q. You're not so enamored of the work of Cole
Porter?;   A. I don't think I'm as well-matched to Porter as to Berlin or,
say, Harold Arlen. There are many Porter songs I love, but there are many I
don't like and find diffi-cult to perform. Bobby Short can do them better than
me. Others too -- Julie Wilson, Steve Ross. I wrote recently in an article
that maybe they can create a certain archness, a certain reserve, that some of
his songs require, that I can't generate. A lot of his songs don't hit me in
the kishkas -- "Night and Day" just doesn't do it for me.;   Q. Where are the
kishkas?;   A. That's Yiddish for intestines.;   Q. You mentioned Harold
Arlen, who wrote the music for the songs in "The Wizard of Oz." You do a
beautiful interpretation of "If I Only Had a Brain.";   A. Thank you. In 1981
I heard it sung by E.Y. Harburg, who wrote the lyrics for Arlen's tune, and
this gave me a completely fresh perspective on it -- I began to see the song
in the context of the struggle of contemporary man! Our struggle to exist in
the world today, and find love; the simple things we all yearn for. I
discovered that no one had ever recorded the verses and choruses of all three
of the Oz characters in one piece, so I decided to do it that way. Also, there
were parts cut out of the movie -- there's an introduction to the Scarecrow's
part that goes: "Said a scarecrow swinging on a pole/To a blackbird sitting on
a fence. . . ." This is how I often proceed with a song -- going back, digging
around, seeing what's really there. It's sort of an archeological search.;  
Q. When you were growing up in Columbus, Ohio, in the '60s and early '70s, at
the height of the rock era, did any of your peers share your love for the old
tunes?;   A. No. Occasionally some would come over and listen to my records --
I had a collection of 78s by Al Jolson, Fred Astaire, Bing Crosby and others.
I liked some things from the '60s -- Carole King, Leiber &amp; Stoller and others.
I like rock 'n' roll more now than I used to. One of my problems with a lot of
contemporary songs is that, while I really like to bring words to the fore,
many records today consist largely of electronic sounds generated in the
studio. Actually, the thing about rock that most worries me is its impact on
people's hearing. People of my generation are going deaf! It's really
happening!  </TEXT>

   Hollywood animator Chuck Jones, the creator
of the popular cartoon character Wile E. Coyote, says current
Saturday morning cartoon fare is ``TV mush that attempts to pass
for animation.''
   ``It's illustrated radio,'' said Jones, 75. ``You can turn off
the picture and know what's going on because they have to describe
it to you.
   ``Good acting will survive on its own. That's the essence of
good cartoons. You can turn off the sound and watch the pictures,''
Jones said Friday.
   ``The quality of the new stuff is flat. Some of these old
cartoons are 50 years old and still being shown. That's good
quality,'' said Jones, in Lincoln for the Animation Festival at the
Sheldon Film Theater.
   Jones also created Pepe le Pew and collaborated in the creation
of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Porky Pig during his years at Warner
Brothers Studio. He won three Oscars and hundreds of other awards
and honors for some 300 movies.

   Country-western singer Mickey Gilley is
temporarily leaving the stage for a courtroom, where he is suing
his former business partner and accountant for allegedly defrauding
him of $8.2 million.
   As a result of the trial, expected to last three weeks, Gilley
says he's likely to miss five or six performances.
   Gilley is suing Sherwood Cryer and accountant Gerard Willrich
for allegedly cheating him over the past 17 years.
   According to the suit, Cryer was Gilley's manager from 1971 to
1984 but still represents himself as such. The singer also accuses
Cryer of failing to pay him half the profits from the Houston-area
club named after Gilley and for merchandise that carries the
Gilley's name.
   Cryer responded that the claims were filed too late to collect
damages, that no written contracts existed for many of the
transactions and that Gilley silently consented to Cryer's actions.
   ``I'm an entertainer,'' Gilley said Thursday outside the
courtroom. ``I'm not real good at standing and testifying.''

   After a three-year marriage, Bruce
Springsteen and his wife, actress Julianne Phillips, have split,
Miss Phillips' publicist says.
   ``Yes. I'd rather not comment on it. You can say it's been
confirmed,'' Molly Madden, Miss Phillips' spokeswoman, said Friday.
She said neither Springsteen nor Miss Phillips has filed for
divorce.
   Springsteen, 38, the working-class kid who rose from the bar
bands of Asbury Park, N.J., to become one of the world's most
popular rock stars, is in Europe with his ``Tunnel of Love''
concert tour.
   Miss Phillips, 28, is filming ``Fletch II'' with comedian Chevy
Chase, Ms. Madden said.
   The couple met backstage in Los Angeles during his ``Born in the
U.S.A.'' concert tour in 1984. They were married in a private,
midnight ceremony in a church near her family's home in Lake
Oswego, Ore., on May 13, 1985.

   U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy greeted each
new graduate of the nation's oldest school for the hearing and
visually disabled after urging increased federal funding for
programs for the blind and deaf.
   ``Thanks for remembering us,'' said Mark Belair, a new graduate
of the Perkins School for the Blind, where Helen Keller began her
education more than 100 years ago. ``We won't let you down.''
   Kennedy, D-Mass., lauded the 19 graduates Friday.
   ``Our nation has prospered by recognizing the contributions that
physically and mentally challenged individuals can make,'' said
Kennedy, whose 26-year-old son, Edward Kennedy Jr., lost a leg in
1973 due to bone cancer.
   ``We have much to learn from those once thought incapable of
independent living or achievement. Their examples inspire us all to
try harder to eliminate the barriers,'' he said.

   The songwriters who penned ``Jailhouse
Rock'' and ``Hound Dog'' are suing a restaurant for playing the
tunes without permission.
   Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, whose songs produced hits for
Elvis Presley, alleged in a federal lawsuit Thursday that owners of
Big Top Pizza Palace have caused them irreparable harm by piping
the songs over the restaurant's loudspeakers without authorization.
   A co-plaintiff is Sheb Wooley, who wrote the song ``The Purple
People Eater.''
   The lawsuit, which seeks damages of up to $10,000 for each of
the plaintiffs, alleges the restaurant owners ignored repeated
letters and visits from representatives of the American Society of
Composers, Authors and Publishers, which licenses the songs.
   Owners of the restaurant could not be reached for comment Friday.
   Attorney Nancy Mays, who represents the songwriters, said it is
a standard procedure for restaurants or nightclubs to arrange for
licensing through ASCAP or Broadcast Music Inc., which represent
composers.

   The legal eagle for rock 'n' roller Jerry
Lee Lewis knows the show must go on.
   The rock pioneer was about to give a rooftop concert at the
historic Peabody Hotel on Friday for the Tennessee Bar Association
when a member of the audience decided to conduct a little
unfinished business.
   Attorney Frank Clayton of Nashville tried to seize Lewis' $5,000
payment for the performance. Clayton represents Oklahoma nightclub
owner George Cunningham, who won a suit against Lewis in 1978 for
$483,645 after the flamboyant entertainer failed to appear for a
concert at The Whiskey River Club. Lewis never repaid the advance
fee he received.
   When Clayton learned that Lewis' band was to receive the fee
instead of the entertainer, he tried to serve Lewis with a court
order allowing him to collect the $483,645 award.
   But Lewis' attorney, Jim Sanderson, accepted the suit himself,
preventing Lewis from getting the writ before the show and possibly
ruining Lewis' mood for the performance.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Irving Berlin, America's best-known but most
private songwriter, turns 100 this week. A diverse group of
entertainers will take part in a tribute to Berlin at Carnegie
Hall, but don't expect him to attend. Except for occasional
strolls, Berlin stays home, talking infrequently with his friends
by telephone.

   Shortly before midnight on May 10, a small group
of carolers will gather in front of a five-story brick mansion
facing the East River on New York's posh Beekman Place.
   When the clock strikes 12, this impromptu glee club, led by
composer and cabaret performer John Wallowitch, will break into
``Happy Birthday,'' followed by a chorus of ``Always.''
   They will be celebrating at the doorstep of the man who wrote
that haunting love song. Irving Berlin, America's best-known _ yet
most private _ songwriter turns 100 on May 11, 1988.
   Just mention the melodies Berlin wrote, and you'll start to
sing: ``White Christmas,'' ``Easter Parade,'' ``God Bless
America,'' ``There's No Business Like Show Business,''
``Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' ``A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody,''
``Puttin' on the Ritz,'' ``Blue Skies,'' ``How Deep is the
Ocean?,'' ``Cheek to Cheek,'' to name a few.
   Wallowitch's Berlin salute, an annual celebration he began more
than 20 years ago and which he usually holds at 6 p.m. on Christmas
Eve, may be the most personal tribute to Berlin this year.
   ``They have been devastatingly emotional experiences,'' says
Wallowitch, an unabashed Berlin fan who lives down the street and
around the corner from the composer.
   But the only festivity officially recognized by the songwriter
will be a Carnegie Hall salute on May 11 held in connection with
ASCAP, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.
Berlin is a charter member of the organization _ founded in 1914 _
that licenses music for public performance.
   The collection of diverse performers expected to appear at the
gala includes Frank Sinatra, Willie Nelson, Jerome Robbins, Walter
Cronkite, Isaac Stern, Ray Charles and Garrison Keillor. It will be
taped by CBS for a television special later in the month.
   Don't expect an appearance by the master. Berlin is passionate
about his privacy. Except for short walks around Beekman Place when
the weather is warm, Berlin never is seen in public. On his
infrequent strolls through the tranquil, tree-lined neighborhood,
he usually is accompanied by a young woman or a doorman from a
nearby building.
   Call the Irving Berlin Music Corp. and ask for an interview with
the boss. You'll get Hilda Schneider, Berlin's longtime secretary.
She is polite and friendly but adamant in declining interviews for
her employer.
   ``I'm sorry I can't be more encouraging,'' the woman says. ``If
we do one, we'd have to do them all. It's all in the record. You
can look it up.''
   And the record is pretty impressive: Some 1,500 songs that span
the worlds of theater, movies and popular music. No other composer
can match that record.
   For the stage, Berlin wrote ``Annie Get Your Gun'' and more than
a dozen other Broadway shows. His movies include several Fred
Astaire-Ginger Rogers classics such as ``Top Hat'' and ``Follow the
Fleet.'' His pop hits, those songs not written for any particular
stage show or film, include such standards as ``Remember'' and
``All Alone.''
   What makes his music so great?
   ``His songs have the sophistication of simplicity,'' says Morton
Gould, president of ASCAP. ``You know precisely what he's saying
and singing. He's been able to distill everything down to its
essence.
   ``He also expresses universal truths,'' Gould adds. ``If you
look at his song titles and listen to his music, he expresses
emotions that human beings would like to experience. Most people
want blue skies. They want the equivalent of white Christmases or
the whole idea of what `Easter Parade' evokes. And most of us don't
want to be all alone by the telephone. He says it directly and you
feel it.''
   Ironically, the telephone is how Berlin communicates with the
outside world today. When he wants to talk, he calls. The
songwriter has a small circle of telephone friends, people he dials
when he has something on his mind. Gould is one such listener.
   ``He will just call,'' Gould says. ``His liaison will say `Mr.
Berlin would like to talk to you.' When that happens, you drop
everything and pick up the phone. It's a wonderful thing. He has a
keen mind, and he's right on top of everything.''

Q &amp; A: BOBBY SHORT: GETTING A KICK OUT OF COLE PORTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan King 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You didn't have to live through the 1930s, '40s and '50s to recognize these 
tunes: "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," "I Love Paris," "Too Darn Hot," "Anything 
Goes," "I Get a Kick Out of You," "Night and Day." They are the witty, 
sophisticated and romantic handiwork of the beloved Cole Porter, who died in 
1964. A contemporary of the Gershwins, Jerome Kern, Richard Rodgers, Lorenz 
Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II, Porter is the subject of the "American Masters" 
documentary, "You're the Top: The Cole Porter Story," airing Monday at 10 p.m. 
on KCET. 
</P>
<P>
The one-hour special features interviews with performers and artists who knew 
Porter-including Bob Hope, Gene Kelly, Cyd Charrisse, Alfred Drake-more than 20 
performances from his movie musicals and archival footage and photos. 
</P>
<P>
And who better to host and narrate the documentary than noted cabaret 
performer, Bobby Short, who talked about Porter and his legacy with Susan King. 
</P>
<P>
Did you ever meet Cole Porter? 
</P>
<P>
I met him in the late 1940s. I had gone to the Masonic Hall in Los Angeles to 
accompany a young woman who was auditioning for the national company of "Kiss 
Me Kate." She sang for Mr. Porter, who was sitting out front in a very dapper 
up mood in spite of his physical disabilities (a horseback-riding accident in 
1937 left him handicapped) because he had this big hit on his hands. 
</P>
<P>
After she finished singing the song, he yelled out, "Bobby, what do you think 
of the show?" We never met formally; it was just like that. 
</P>
<P>
I think he had seen me before because I performed at the time on the Sunset 
Strip in a club called the Cafe Gala, which is now Spago. The Gala was about 
the most sophisticated little club on the West Coast. Porter was a regular. He 
could go there and hear his own songs. 
</P>
<P>
We became friends right there. I didn't see him again until I came to New York 
in the 1950s, where I saw him repeatedly at parties. He was a very polite 
person and, of course, I appeared in a revival of "Kiss Me Kate" in New York in 
1956. I played the role of Paul, who was the valet to the leading man, and I 
sang "Too Darn Hot." 
</P>
<P>
What makes Porter's songs so special? 
</P>
<P>
It was his lifestyle which made him so attractive. He had the most glamorous 
lifestyle. He had enough style, intelligence, integrity and education to make 
it all work. I think whatever you want in this life, if you want it badly 
enough, you can get it. I really think Porter wanted to live life at its 
highest level-socially, that is. 
</P>
<P>
Was composing easy for him? 
</P>
<P>
There is evidence that Porter had great difficulty writing songs. When you 
write songs with an express purpose in mind, it is never easy. If you have to 
please a Hollywood studio executive with a song, it's not easy. 
</P>
<P>
The story about the song "Rosalie" that he wrote is just one example. I think 
he turned in a number of versions before the studio head said, "That's the one 
I want." When you are writing under a deadline for a Broadway show, it can't be 
easy. And if you are a perfectionist like Porter was, it can't be easy. It is 
not easy to please yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Which Porter songs do you enjoy performing? 
</P>
<P>
I like Cole Porter's ballads. I think he becomes very pensive in the ballads, 
and his love songs took on a new turn in popular songwriting. Porter made it 
quite plain that love is not always going to have a happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
Did you ever see the Porter film biography "Night and Day," which starred Cary 
Grant as the composer? 
</P>
<P>
I never saw the film. I think it was a commercialization of the many high 
points in his life. It had been said that Porter would have liked Fred Astaire 
to have portrayed him. He did have more of a resemblance to Porter than Cary 
Grant. 
</P>
<P>
I think the thing to remember is that Porter, despite his flirtation with high 
society and fancy living, was a very, very hard worker and came along at the 
time when it must have been difficult for a young man just out of Yale to break 
through the ranks of Tin Pan Alley in New York. 
</P>
<P>
What new insights into Porter does the documentary reveal? 
</P>
<P>
It goes quite deeply into his personal life. There is a lot of attention paid 
to the struggles he had after the accident, and the fact that he was indeed 
reclusive when the pain and the disability became too much. In the end, Porter 
lived by himself in the Waldorf Towers and saw only a few of his friends. I 
suppose that is the way most people who grow old and sick wind up. 
</P>
<P>
It always seems an artist's life is touched with sadness and tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
The entire pursuit of the arts necessarily makes for a kind of loneliness. If 
you are an artist, and I call myself one in a minor way, you are not really 
happy unless you are practicing your art. In the end, Cole Porter was not 
called upon to practice his art. His last effort was a TV special called 
"Aladdin" which was not particularly notable. I think all of our lives are 
mirrored in the lives of people as celebrated as Cole Porter. Think of all the 
people who end up all alone and ill who have not given the world anything or 
who are not special in anyway at all. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Porter's success, a lot of critics still don't take his songs 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the 1930s and all through Cole Porter's career, he has had to buck 
criticism. "Night and Day" came in for such criticism, I cannot tell you. 
People thought it sounded like Ravel's "Bolero" or some kind of a chant. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, he wrote a score for a show called "Jubilee" and it failed 
because the critics thought the songs were so terrible. Out of the show came 
"Begin the Beguine" and "Just One of Those Things." 
</P>
<P>
I think that Cole Porter's songs hold up very, very well. It's too bad people 
who tend to call themselves critics are so severe.

If there were a word to describe the voice of Blossom Dearie, who's at the 
Tiffany Theater through Monday, it would have to be sopranissimo. But no word 
or phrase can precisely pin down her special delicacy, the almost childlike 
grace, fragile on the surface, yet assured enough to bring honesty to every 
ballad and joy to every jump tune. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be called a jazz singer," she says, "though I certainly have 
some roots there. I'm not a cult singer either -- that word is used too much 
with a political connotation now -- and after being called a legend, that 
sounds too much like an epitaph. I think of myself as a songwriter's singer. 
All the great Broadway and Hollywood teams are in my repertoire, along with 
contemporary people like Dave Frishberg and Bobby Scott. Writers bring their 
songs to me because they rely on me to define their work with respect. That's 
very flattering." 
</P>
<P>
As a pianist, she considers herself mainly a self-accompanist. "I can't play 
jazz choruses like my friend Joyce Collins -- she's marvelous at that." For the 
Tiffany gig, she's backed by bassist Joel Di Bartolo of "The Tonight Show" 
band. 
</P>
<P>
"The job here is a new experiment for me," said Dearie. "I rented the theater, 
which means finding a sound person and a lighting person and someone to sell 
the tickets and rent the piano and place the ads. It's a nice hall and I do a 
two-hour show at 8 p.m. -- 6 p.m. on Sundays -- and then sell my cassettes and 
CDs afterward." 
</P>
<P>
Though she had lived in Paris for several years and led a successful vocal 
group there, Dearie said her present career as a singer-pianist-songwriter 
began in London in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"London was absolutely swinging in the '60s. I started at Ronnie Scott's club, 
and did a lot of television. I was on a show Peter Cook and Dudley Moore had 
called 'Not Only But Also.' When I was in Australia and New Zealand last month, 
I found a built-in audience of people who had seen me on the BBC programs that 
had been shown there." 
</P>
<P>
It was in London that her songwriting career took off. "I wrote 'Sweet Georgie 
Fame' with Sandra Harris; it was recorded by Tony Bennett. Later I collaborated 
with Johnny Mercer, who wrote the lyrics to 'I'm Shadowing You' and 'My New 
Celebrity Is You,' which was the one of the last songs he ever wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"At present I'm working with Jack Segal. We wrote 'After Me,' 'Good Morning,' 
and 'Bye Bye Country Boy.' I regard him -- and so does my audience -- as a 
world-class lyric writer." 
</P>
<P>
(Dearie's best-known song, "Inside a Silent Tear," was written with a 
lesser-known lyricist, Linda Albert, and has been recorded by Cleo Laine and 
several others.) 
</P>
<P>
Dearie's recording career goes back to the days when Norman Granz was still 
producing for Verve Records (one of the albums from that era, "Blossom Dearie," 
has just been reissued on CD), but in 1972 she founded Daffodil Records. 
"Johnny Mercer gave me the name for it. I have 10 albums out, with three on CD 
and more to come. My upcoming project is a video, which I'll make in London, 
probably at Ronnie Scott's." 
</P>
<P>
Because her style and sound are unique, one does not tend to think of Dearie in 
terms of influences, but she does admit to one. "Although I admire many singers 
and musicians, the one who truly stands out as an influence was Jeri Southern. 
I remember her record of 'You'd Better Go Now,' which was a hit in the 1950s. I 
fell in love with that; she was playing piano and singing, and it made a 
lasting impression on me. I have never stated this before, and I've never even 
met Jeri Southern." 
</P>
<P>
Like Southern (who retired in the 1960s and is now a teacher), Blossom Dearie 
requires a quiet, receptive audience. She has been very particular about 
working conditions; late-night hours, smoky clubs and cash registers that play 
the wrong chord are not for her. 
</P>
<P>
"For five years I spent six months of each year at the Ballroom in New York, 
where I had just one show at 6:30 p.m. It was lovely, and people really paid 
attention. I hold my listeners in high regard, because they respect me; they 
are very polite and they deserve a good performance -- which is why I'm at a 
theater here with just 99 seats. The conditions look ideal to me. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy controlling my working circumstances and having my own record company 
and being at a great stage in my career. I'm at the top of my game, and still 
learning something new and wonderful every day."

   Thomas Broadus Shearman, a publisher of
the Lake Charles American Press who crusaded against gambling in
the 1950s, died Monday. He was 94.
   Shearman entered the newspaper business as an advertising
salesman for The Chicago Tribune in 1914. He bought the Lake
Charles paper in 1943 and acquired the Roswell (N.M.) Daily Record
in 1933 and the Hobbs (N.M.) Daily Sun and the Trinidad (Colo.)
Chronicle News in 1936.
   As a result of his crusade against gambling in southwestern
Louisiana, he and four other journalists were indicted by a special
Calcasieu Parish grand jury on charges they defamed 16 public
officials and three admitted gamblers.
   A special judge appointed to hear the case acquitted the five,
saying every allegation made in articles and editorials was without
malice and was either true or could reasonably be believed to be
true. With legislative help casinos and slot machines were
eventually eliminated.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Cindy Walker Writes `Songs With A Face'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cindy Walker, ``the queen of country
music songwriters,'' has spent about half a century writing
recognizable songs that have been recorded by such performers as
Elvis Presley and Bing Crosby.
   The veteran composer, who lives in Mexia, Texas, has written more
than 450 songs that have been recorded. She was a finalist this year
for induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame.
   The best tunes, she said in a telephone interview, ``are songs
with a face.''
   ``You recognize them. You know them. It's like a person. They
have a face that's outstanding. Other songs don't have a face; you
just hear them, that's all. The really good ones are few and far
between.''
   Two of her best known songs are ``You Don't Know Me'' and ``Dream
Baby.''
   ``You Don't Know Me'' has been recorded by more than 75 singers,
including Presley, Ray Charles, Eddy Arnold, Jerry Vale and Mickey
Gilley. Walker wrote the song in the mid-1950s after Arnold
suggested the title, although he had no music or lyrics to go with
it.
   ``I was in Nashville for a music convention and he said, `I've
got a title for you.' He said you've got to promise me to write it.
I was flippant about it (the title) because it didn't strike me at
the time,'' she said.
   ``It's about someone you think you know but you don't. I came on
home and two months later, I was sitting in my chair in my studio
and that song just started singing itself. I was just carried away
with it.
   ``It took me three weeks to finish. Then I called Eddy and sang
it over the phone to him. He had forgotten about it, but he recorded
it three weeks later.''
   Her song ``Dream Baby'' was written in the mid 1960s and was a
hit by Roy Orbison and later Glen Campbell among others.
   ``It's been recorded by lots of people,'' she said. ``I hate to
name names because I leave someone out.''
   Some of her other songs include ``In the Misty Moonlight,''
``Take Me in Your Arms and Hold Me,'' ``China Doll'' and tunes with
a Western flavor such as ``Blue Canadian Rockies,'' ``My Rancho Rio
Grande,'' ``Lone Star Trail'' and ``You're From Texas.''
   For the king of Western swing music, Bob Wills, she wrote
``Bubbles in My Beer,'' ``Cherokee Maiden'' and ``Dusty Skies.''
   Her first big break, though, came in 1942 when she accompanied
her father, a cotton buyer, on a trip to Hollywood. They drove past
the Crosby Building and she decided to try to make an appointment
with Bing Crosby.
   ``I went into the office and asked for Mr. Crosby,'' she
recalled. ``The secretary said Larry or which one. I didn't know
there was but one. So I asked for the first one said named. It was
Larry. He listened and I sang him the song. He said Bing had been
looking for a Western song. He said, `meet me here tomorrow and
we'll let him hear it.' I did.''
   As a result, ``Lone Star Trail'' was recorded by Bing Crosby and
became her first song recorded by someone else.
   ``It started me off,'' she said.
   Later, she signed her own recording contract with Decca Records.
For five years she was a performer and songwriter and appeared in a
few movies but eventually decided to concentrate on composing.
   ``I've always been a songwriter,'' she said. ``Everything was an
offshoot from my writing.''
   Her procedure has been to think of a title and then go from there.
   ``The title tells the story. If you can get a real good title,
you've got something. I always write from the title. I've never
written a song without the title.''
   Melodies flow from the lyrics, she said.
   ``The words and music come together. It just sort of comes to
you. The songs just sing themselves to me. They kind of write
themselves. I just stand back and listen.''
   Walker, who gives her age as ``old enough to know better and
young enough not to care,'' is still writing. Her song, ``Sugar
Moon,'' has recently been recorded by country stars Willie Nelson,
Janie Frickie and K.D. Lang.
   ``I write all the time. It's all I've ever done,'' she said.

   With a wicked smile and a wicked song,
Christopher Mason lampoons the ladies and gents of the upper crust.
   He sings about the foibles, follies and fads of high-powered,
high-society folk like Ivana (Trump), Nancy (Reagan), David
(Rockefeller), Brooke (Astor) and William (Paley). And they love it.
   In less than two years, the sprite-like, 27-year-old Mason has
gone from private party entertainer to budding cabaret star. Now
he's appearing through May at the fabled Oak Room in the Algonquin
Hotel where he's singing not only about people like Mrs. Trump and
her yacht and Mrs. Reagan and her new life in California, but about
such topics as the water shortage and trash TV. He's a combination
of Cole Porter and Tom Lehrer with a bit of Noel Coward thrown in
for good measure.
   ``I write the words and the music. I play the piano and sing,''
Mason explains. ``So if the evening is terrible, it's all my
fault.''
   It was never hard to get Mason to perform. He was born in
England, the son of an opera singer and a civil servant. At the age
of 3, he saw ``The Sound of Music,'' came home, sat down at the
piano and played every song from the show _ with one finger.
   ``I used to drive all of my piano teachers crazy because I'd be
playing Chopin or Beethoven, and I'd always think of what I thought
was a nicer way of finishing a phrase,'' he says, recalling his
precocious childhood.
   At Cambridge, Mason majored in English and art history, but when
he came to New York, he worked long hours for little pay in public
relations and fund-raising. But he got to observe the rich at close
quarters. He also got to attend parties, lots of them.
   ``When there was nothing left to revive a party, I was thrown
toward the piano to play and sing,'' he says. ``People said, `Why
don't you do this all the time?'''
   He finally did. His big break came last May when he was hired by
fashion designer Mario ``the Prince of Chintz'' Buatta to play for
a society dinner at the New York Public Library.
   Mason wrote five new songs for the occasion. ``If you are
burning with the love of learning, write a check to the public
library,'' he crooned in his best fund-raising voice. But he also
wrote songs about Brooke Astor and Annette Reed, two of the biggest
supporters of the library. The ditties suggested that Mrs. Astor
change her first name from Brooke to Book and Mrs. Reed spell her
last name R-e-a-d.
   Mason was a big success, and people began calling to ask if he'd
appear at their parties, playing original songs.
   ``I was terrified of asking for money,'' he says. ``I'm English,
so I'm terrible at dealing with money.''
   At first, Mason would immediately say yes to a job and then ask
about the fee. Often it was less than $500. Today, he has an agent
at William Morris and his price for an evening's work can go as
high as $3,000.
   He serenaded Mrs. Trump last summer aboard the Trump Princess,
her husband's $30 million yacht.
   Mason writes during regular, 9-to-5 office hours, but finds
pressure the best tonic for non-productivity.
   ``The idea of a deadline and a check at the end of it is
irresistible for writing new songs,'' he says.
   Some of his best songs have been born on airplanes and trains.
   For the reopening of Blair House in Washington, Mason wrote a
song about it on a cocktail napkin, while he was flying from New
York to the nation's capital.
   And for his Algonquin engagement, Mason has written different
types of songs.
   ``God knows, not everybody is interested in society's
darlings,'' he says. ``So I've written a love song or two. As well
as one number about the former president called `The Reagans at
Home in Bel Air.'''
   Mason suddenly begins reciting:
   ``The Secret Service is awfully nervous
   ``They can't think what to do.
   ``They are meant to take care of the Reagans
   ``But the Reagans seem awfully blue.
   ``They are finding it hard to adjust to being ordinary folk
   ``And the pressure's not fair.
   ``Though their friends bought them quite a swell house.
   ``It's no fun being the Reagans at home in Bel Air.''
   Mason also is working on a musical called ``How To Bag a
Billionaire,'' a look at today's version of what used to be called
golddiggers, those women who want to marry for money and not
necessarily love.
   ``I'm selfishly writing the whole thing, the book and songs, but
I won't be in it,'' he says.
   The show has been delayed while Mason completes his Algonquin
engagement, and he tries to juggle all his offers from the rich and
the famous.
   ``I find myself now invited to all the big parties _ the
serious, social parties, which is a peculiar thing,'' Mason says.
``I spend time with these people. They must be aware that I am
watching them every second to see how they are behaving. Maybe
people think they are flirting with danger in a very acceptable way
by having me around.''

   Ellin Berlin, the novelist wife of songwriter
Irving Berlin, died Friday after the last of a series of strokes.
She was 85.
   Mrs. Berlin died at Doctors Hospital, where she was taken from
her Manhattan home.
   The last of Mrs. Berlin's four novels, ``The Best of Families,''
was published in 1970. She was also a prolific short-story writer.
   In one article for The New Yorker, she defended her generation's
abandonment of the Junior League and ``polite society'' for the
wilder life of cabarets and dancing the Charleston.
   ``It is not because fashionable young ladies are picturesquely
depraved that they go to cabarets,'' she wrote. ``They go to find
privacy.''
   Her marriage to Berlin on Jan. 4, 1926, drew headlines as the
famous songwriter, an Orthodox Jew, wed the former Ellin Mackay, a
Roman Catholic debutante who spurned her multimillionaire father's
fortune for love.
   When her father reportedly threatened to disinherit his
daughter, Berlin reportedly replied, ``In that case, I'll probably
have to make her a wedding gift of a couple of million dollars.''
   ``It could be the greatest love affair of the century,'' said
composer and cabaret performer John Wallowitch, a neighbor. ``It
really is a tragedy.''
   Wallowitch, who leads a group in serenading Berlin on his
birthday, recalled that Mrs. Berlin could frequently be seen
walking in the neighborhood and went to Mass each Sunday at St.
Patrick's Cathedral until about 10 years ago.
   During 62 years of marriage, Berlin wrote several songs just for
his wife, including ``Always'' and ``The Song Is Ended.''
   Mrs. Berlin was born on her father's $6 million estate in
Roslyn. She and Berlin had three daughters. Mrs. Berlin was a major
supporter of the Girl Scout movement.
   She is survived by her daughters, Mary Ellin Barrett of New
York; Linda Louise Emmett of Paris and Elizabeth Irving Peters of
New York; a brother, John W. Mackay of Locust Valley, nine
grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
   A funeral was scheduled for Tuesday at St. Patrick's Cathedral.

<HEADLINE>  SONGWRITING'S TOP GUN IS A HAPPY VALLEY GIRL  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Pop Music  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The answer is found more and more in free-lance songwriters -- hired guns
who ship over finished songs or collaborate with tired artists looking for a
quick recharge. The top guns include Desmond Child, who has written for
Aerosmith and Bon Jovi; and Billy Steinberg, who has written for Madonna and
Whitney Houston.;   But the hottest of the bunch is California valley girl
Diane Warren, who later this month will be featured in a special section in
Billboard and profiled in Time magazine. She's racked up 30 Top 40 hits, among
them "I'll Be Your Shelter" for Taylor Dayne, "Rhythm of the Night" for
DeBarge, "If I Could Turn Back Time" for Cher, "Who Will You Run To" for Heart
and "Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now" for Starship.;   This week alone, Warren has
five songs in Billboard's Hot 100, including "Love and Understanding" for Cher
and "Time, Love and Tenderness" for Michael Bolton.;   Success suits Warren;
Warren is reeling in the hits -- and reeling in the profits: Witness the
half-million dollars a songwriter earns for a Top 3-and-up global hit. Yet she
remains blissfully down to earth, and not at all worried about overexposure or
burnout.;   "As far as having too many songs out at one time, that's fine,"
she says in a recent interview from the Los Angeles office of her Realsongs
publishing company. "If I was a really stylized writer, that might be a
problem. People would tire of your sound. But the songs I do are pretty
diverse, and the artists that cover them are diverse. I remember having 'When
I See You Smile' for Bad English at No. 1 on the charts, and 'Blame It on the
Rain' for Milli Vanilli at No. 2. But you'd never know the same writer wrote
those songs. It wasn't like, 'Oh, I'm getting tired of the Diane Warren
sound,' because I don't think there is one. There's a style to my ballads,
maybe, but nothing else. And I'm proud of that.;   "Everybody says I'm the
most driven person they know," she adds. "And I really am. I work 12 hours a
day, seven days a week pretty much. I'm constantly working. If I'm not
writing, I'm in the studio. If I'm not in the studio, I'm on the phone with
somebody regarding songs. I live and breathe it.";   And just who is this
human hit machine?;   "I'm a Jewish girl from the Valley -- the San Fernando
Valley -- you know, they talk that valley girl talk. I'm 34 years old, at
least for another month. I grew up in a middle-class house. My dad was an
insurance man. I had two older sisters, which was cool because I got to listen
to a lot of music through them.;   The radio was a friend; "I was always
listening to the radio. It was like my friend growing up. Top 40 radio had so
much great music back then in the '60s. I've been influenced by everything,
but a lot of the great songs of the '60s have really given me inspiration --
the Motown stuff and all that.";   After years of banging on doors in L.A.,
Warren scored her first success with "Solitaire," a 1983 hit for Laura
Branigan. Then came the international hit "Rhythm of the Night" for DeBarge
(with its infectious line, "Listen to the beat of the rhythm of the night"),
and she was on her way. Today, artists from Aerosmith to Gloria Estefan are at
her door, asking for help.;   Warren says she generally writes for herself
first, without tailoring a song to a given act. "I never write to trends," she
says. "First of all, I don't like doing it. And second, it's a bad thing to do
because by the time your record or song comes out, that trend may be over.;  
"The key is for me to get excited. I figure I have pretty commercial ears,
because I grew up listening to hits. If a song excites me, I continue with it.
Then I go, 'OK, let me try to think who this is good for. Who can I fool into
thinking this is a hit?' " She can be so persuasive that she even fell on her
knees to plead with Cher to record "If I Could Turn Back Time," which became
Cher's biggest hit in 15 years. "I just knew it was right for her," says

   Another member of this select telephone circle is Stanley Green,
a musical comedy historian and author of several books about the
Broadway musical. Green last spoke to Berlin when Fred Astaire died
last year. Berlin called Green to express his regret about the
passing of a man he admired very much.
   Most of Berlin's contemporaries are dead. He's the last of the
great musical comedy composers, a pantheon that once included
George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Cole Porter and Richard Rodgers. Of
his theater contemporaries, only director George Abbott, who turns
101 in June, survives.
   Berlin, born Israel Baline in Russia, came to the United States
at the age of 2. His family settled on New York's Lower East Side
where, as a young boy, Berlin got jobs singing on the Bowery. He
worked as song plugger and a singing waiter at a Chinatown cafe. It
was there that he learned to play the piano, laboriously picking
out tunes with one finger. This self-taught musician writes the
same way.
   `It's an incredible catalog this man has achieved with no formal
education as well as no musical education,'' Green says. ``And to
be able to write music AND lyrics.''
   For all his success, Berlin is a loner, a man very much aware of
his humble origins. His first wife, Dorothy, died from typhoid
fever less than a year after they were married.
   In 1926, Berlin married his second wife, Ellin Mackay, the
daughter of a wealthy and socially prominent businessman, Clarence
Mackay, the president of a commercial telegraph company. She eloped
with Berlin over her Catholic father's objections and the marriage
was front-page news all over the country.
   In the more than 60 years they have been married, Berlin has
kept his wife and his three daughters out of the public eye.
   ``I think a reason he is so very private is that he is wildly in
love with his wife,'' Wallowitch says. ``I think it is one of the
greatest romantic love affairs in history.''
   Berlin is the only major songwriter who never had a film
biography like Cole Porter's ``Night and Day,'' George Gershwin's
``Rhapsody in Blue,'' Sigmund Romberg's ``Deep in My Heart'' or
Rodgers and Hart's ``Words and Music.''
   Coupled with his desire for privacy was Berlin's shrewd business
instincts. In the early 1920s, he and two partners built the Music
Box Theater to showcase his musical revues. He and the Shubert
Organization still own it.
   His music publishing company tightly controls his songs. ASCAP
won't reveal the amount of money these melodies have generated, but
the man is believed to be a millionaire many times over. Berlin
gave the royalties from ``God Bless America'' to the Boy Scouts and
Girl Scouts of America. So far, they have earned some $700,000 from
that one song.
   Berlin withdrew even more from the public eye in 1962 after his
last Broadway musical, ``Mr. President,'' flopped. The show,
starring Robert Ryan and Nanette Fabray, was a wildly anticipated
musical, generating a record box-office advance but tepid reviews.
It had a six-month run.
   Still he came back. Four years later, he wrote a new song, ``An
Old- Fashioned Wedding'' for the Lincoln Center revival of ``Annie
Get Your Gun'' which starred Ethel Merman. Twenty years after the
original production, she stopped the show again with Berlin's new
song.
   In all his years of serenading Berlin, Wallowitch finally was
invited into the Berlin home nearly five Christmas Eves ago after a
chorus of ``White Christmas.'' On an impulse, he rang the doorbell.
A maid answered the door and he and his fellow singers were taken
into the kitchen.
   There they were greeted by Berlin himself, wearing a bathrobe
and slippers. The composer hugged the men, kissed the women and
told them, ``That's the nicest Christmas present I've ever had.''
   Every day, Wallowitch walks his dog Winnie around Beekman Place
and often wonders what is going on inside the big house now.
   ``I keep holding on to the idea that the man is not allowing
himself to be bored and is still writing,'' Wallowitch says. ``God,
I hope it's true.''

<TEXT>     Mr. Yellen wrote "Happy Days Are Here Again" in 1929, with Milton Ager, and
it became a campaign song for the Democratic Party, although Mr. Yellen
considered himself a Republican, Buyer said.;    Among other songs for which
he wrote lyrics were "Down by the O-Hi-O" (1920), "I Wonder What's Become of
Sally?" (1924), "Ain't She Sweet" (1927), "Hard Hearted Hannah (The Vamp of
Savannah)" (1924) and "Are You Havin' Any Fun?" (1939), as well as "My
Yiddishe Momme" (1925), one of many songs he wrote for Sophie Tucker.;   
Writing in Variety in 1963, Mr. Yellen recalled: "Tucker sang it at the Palace
-- the song and recitation in English, then a chorus in Yiddish. She made it a
hit not only in this country but in Europe.";    Born in Poland, Mr. Yellen
grew up in Buffalo and graduated from the University of Michigan in 1913. He
began writing songs in high school and continued on the side during his first
job, as a reporter for the Buffalo Courier.;    He was on the board of the
American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers from 1951 to 1969.;   
Mr. Yellen is survived by his wife, the former Lucille Hodgeman; a son, David
of Buffalo; a daughter, Beth Wilcove of Gaithersburg, Md.; a brother, Irving
of Buffalo; and six grandchildren.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>`Michael Feinstein in Concert: Piano and Voice' Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Feinstein could be the world's biggest
fan of classic popular music.
   That's part of his appeal, a genuine enthusiasm for the songs of
George Gershwin, Richard Rodgers, Jerome Kern, Jule Styne, Harry
Warren, Stephen Sondheim, Richard Whiting and scores of other
Broadway and Hollywood composers.
   His affection for these melody masters comes through in
``Michael Feinstein in Concert: Piano and Voice,'' his third trip
to Broadway since 1988.
   Once the technical glitches - particularly a balky sound system
- are ironed out Feinstein's new show, which is on view at
Broadway's Golden Theater through Oct. 27, could be his best yet.
   The evening has been constructed carefully, with songs grouped
together by theme or composer or lyricist. Feinstein always has
been adept at intertwining different songs by the same writers. The
numbers reverberate off each other, making the listener doubly
aware of what a composer or a lyricist was trying to say.
   For example, Feinstein does it with two standards that have
lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein - Jerome Kern's ``Make Believe'' and
Richard Rodgers' ``I Have Dreamed.'' Both numbers reveal the man's
unabashed sense of romanticism and his firm belief in true love.
   The evening's highlight is a medley of songs by Burton Lane,
with whom Feinstein recently has recorded an album. A spry,
ebullient Lane was on hand Tuesday night to assist Feinstein, and
it was Tin Pan Alley heaven. The 78-year-old composer is a marvel,
playing his own songs with a zest no mere second-hand interpreter
could ever muster.
   Besides such Lane evergreens as ``Babes on Broadway,'' ``How
About You'' and ``On a Clear Day You Can See Forever,'' Feinstein
and Lane ripped smashingly through a witty little ditty called
``Anything Can Happen in New York.'' The lyrics were by E.Y.
Harburg and recall a time when the unexpected in the Big Apple
actually could be fun.
   Feinstein has a conversational rapport with the audience. He
talks to them as if he were sitting in their living rooms. There's
a bit of a true believer in him as well. He knows he's right when
he extols the virtues of these songwriters.
   Near the end of the long evening, he delivers a little lecture
on lyricist Johnny Mercer, peppered with musical illustrations
ranging from the well-known, ``Come Rain or Come Shine,'' to the
more than obscure, ``Girlfriend of the Whirling Dirvish.''
   But Feinstein relishes even these most unknown of songs. He has
the same preciseness of enunciation that he gives such standards as
Rodgers and Hart's ``Manhattan'' or Gershwin's ``I'll Build a
Stairway to Paradise.'' And he can be heartfelt with an unknown
Jule Styne song, ``Killing Time,'' which has the last lyrics ever
written by Carolyn Leigh.
   Feinstein certainly doesn't hold anything back. He gives his
all. You wonder what kind of voice he'll have at the end of a
four-week engagement. There may be better singers and better piano
players, but nobody tops Michael in his love of performing these
grand musical standards.

   Admiral Sergei Gorshkov, the man credited with
turning the Soviet Union into a modern naval power, died Friday at
age 78, Tass said.
   Gorshkov was appointed to head the Soviet navy in 1956 by Nikita
S. Khrushchev, who considered Josef Stalin's emphasis on large
surface vessels impractical because of their vulnerability to
rocket attacks.
   In the book ``Sea Power of the State,'' Gorshkov said the Soviet
navy's development of a fleet of submarines and missile-launching
warships had frustrated ``illusory hopes of imperialist aggressors
that in the sphere of armed conflict at sea they would have no
strong opponent.''
   Gorshkov was replaced in 1985.

<LEADPARA>  WE INTERRUPT this mundane existence to remember Cole Porter.;    In case you
haven't circled the date on your calendar, note please that Porter was born
June 9, 1891, to Kate Cole and Samuel Fenwick Porter. Cole was the first of
the Porter children to survive his early infancy. Two earlier children had

<MEMO>  Entertainment  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     It took Cole Porter 10 years to write his first song, "Song of the Birds."
It was not a hit.;    But after that, the songs came hot and heavy. At 11,
Cole Porter wrote "The Bobolink Waltz," which was actually published
(privately) and 100 copies were printed, thanks to Mom.;    In the 73 years of
his life, Cole Porter was to write more than 800 songs, more than half
unpublished. There are few writers who were more prolific.;    Today Cole
Porter occupies a musical niche all his own. He's still the backbone of
cabaret performers the world over, not to mention the cocktail lounge
pianists. He represents a style and an age that has all but disappeared, but
that just adds nostalgia to his material.;    Porter came out of a time when
songwriting was a youthful sport, much like stand-up comedy is today. Musical
shows were everywhere. Broadway, in a season, might have four or five dozen.; 
  Young lyricists and composers had college shows and college revues to learn
their craft, and Porter took advantage of that at Yale, where he composed (and
wrote his own lyrics for) many campus hits. ("Bulldog, Bulldog, Bow Wow Wow"
is still played at football games.);    Robert Kimball's hefty book, "The
Complete Lyrics of Cole Porter" (Knopf) has collected the songs, including the
ones at Yale. One begins:;    "First select a small canoe/ Where there's room
for only two . . .";    Little turns of phrase and wit. In our own age, where
rock lyrics cannot be heard or understood without special effort, Porter's
lyrical sophistication seems quaint. But his words are as well remembered as
that of any poet and, in concert with his melodies, serve as a backdrop for so
many private memories over the years.;    Speaking of rock lyrics, where
profanity seems commonplace, it's interesting to note that Porter was
considered risque in his time, and such songs as "I Get a Kick Out of You" had
to have such lines as "I get no kick from cocaine" censored.;    The beautiful
ballad "Love for Sale" could not be sung on radio or television for years.;   
Porter was a rich kid who spent many years in Europe. His career developed
slowly and is replete with flop shows and abandoned songs. A riding accident,
wherein a horse fell on him and crushed both legs, left him in pain the rest
of his life. Six years before his death, one leg was amputated.;    Today,
Porter is part of a select group of American songwriters who are considered
literary and musical treasures. Yale University has a collection of his
manuscripts. So does the Library of Congress. A discovery at a Warner Bros.
warehouse of unseen Porter lyrics in 1982 was front-page news everywhere.;   
That's kind of amazing, considering the low esteem songwriting enjoyed during
those early days of Porter's career. Lorenz Hart, who wrote lyrics for Richard
Rodgers, was said to have become seriously depressed by the lack of importance
of his calling.;    Today, ironically, songwriting is a huge money-maker,
though, with the exception of a Stephen Sondheim (and you will get an argument
there), nobody comes up to the artistry of a Cole Porter now.;    But enough
of this tribute. Let's get to the songs. I regret I can't supply the melodies,
but hunt up an Ella Fitzgerald album or, if you can find one, a rare recording
by Janice Mars, who sang Cole Porter as if she lived each lyric. In a pinch,
some of Sinatra will do.;    And you'll hear: "Begin the Beguine" and the
haunting "In the Still of the Night.";    You will be cheered by "From This
Moment On." Romance was never better than "I've Got You Under My Skin." It's
said that a mourning Jackie Kennedy sat for hours listening to "Down in the
Depths on the 90th Floor.";    Americans during World War II wept through
"You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To." Mary Martin first made her mark with "My
Heart Belongs to Daddy.";    So many songs are classics: "You're the Top,"
"It's De-Lovely." "It's All Right With Me," "Night and Day," "Just One of
Those Things.";    Roy Rogers and his horse, Trigger, recorded "Don't Fence Me
In" during that song's heyday. And a recording last year by current pop and
rock stars doing Porter, "Red, Hot &plus; Blue," was a surprise hit, bridging the
generations.;    This year there will be many reminiscences, including galas
at Carnegie Hall and the London Palladium this week and next. There will even
be a postage stamp.;    All meant to say, Cole, you're the top.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Vanwarmer Album `Like Gathering Your Family'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer-songwriter Randy Vanwarmer is
counting on the emotional edge of his new album to stem a nine-year
slide since his million-selling hit ``Just When I Needed You Most.''
   The 33-year-old Vanwarmer has just released ``I Am,'' a
collection of soft country ballads with romantic titles such as ``I
Will Hold You,''``That's What Your Smile Does for Me'' and ``Words
I Never Meant.'' It's his first album in four years.
   ``There's something spiritual about the record,'' Vanwarmer said
in an interview. ``It's kind of like gathering your family around
the fireplace.''
   As a marketing exercise, however, it has been a disaster.
   Instead of Vanwarmer's ``It's a Heartache,'' a tune by pop-jazz
singer Michael Franks, ``The Camera Never Lies,'' was distributed
erroneously with Vanwarmer's name printed on it.
   The mistake was repeated during a second round of distribution,
so record company officials gave up on the song and will switch to
another one, ``Where the Rocky Mountains Touch the Morning Sun.''
   ``The radio stations kept calling and saying, `We like Randy's
record but he's not country enough for our station,''' Vanwarmer
said.
   ``His record is kind of jazz, funky, but we have similar
textured voices. I can almost understand why they almost thought it
was me.''
   His tough luck continues a pattern since his powerful ``Just
When I Needed You Most'' propelled him from obscurity in 1979.
   Instead of establishing himself as a ballad singer, he followed
up with an uptempo tune titled ``Gotta Get Out of Here.''
   ``It did terribly,'' Vanwarmer recalled.
   More than half a dozen singles were released subsequently, but
none was a hit. On the advice of others, he declined to do American
concert tours that would have built up his name and following. A
possible tour with Anne Murray was bypassed.
   Furthermore, his record company wound down, ``and I don't think
they were putting the money behind the records that they needed
to,'' he said.
   ``I don't blame anybody,'' he said about the downfall. ``Maybe
if I had been more knowledgeable. ...
   ``We had one solid record, and then we wanted to change
direction _ something with a little more edge. I wanted to do it;
that was just naivete. My first record seemed so easy. I do ballads
best. We could have done another ballad, but we put out an uptempo
thing.''
   Though he failed to capitalize on the success of ``Just When I
Needed You Most,'' he says his royalties from writing the hit paid
the bills for six years.
   His breakup with his girlfriend inspired the song.
   ``That was kind of devastating,'' he recalled. Six months later,
he sat down and put the song on paper.
   ``I found that those kind of songs, the deepest ones, come some
time after an event. You're too traumatized at the time. When
someone leaves, you just don't go sit down and write a song. If you
did, you'd almost wish bad things would happen to you.''
   He said the song was a hit because listeners related to a lament
over a broken romance. ``It's happened to everyone. That emotion is
universal. Some people like to feel sorry for themselves,'' he said.
   ``I always hoped the record wasn't wallowing in self pity and it
had some redeeming value, and I guess it does.''
   A footnote about the song is that John Sebastian of the rock
group Lovin' Spoonful played autoharp on the record.
   ``To me, it was one of the things that sold the record,''
Vanwarmer said.
   In 1980, he wrote the song ``It Never Hurts to Hurt Sometimes,''
which later became a No. 1 hit for the Oak Ridge Boys.
   The song, triggered by the death of his father 13 years earlier,
made its way to the charts in an unusual fashion. The song got into
the hands of Oak Ridge Boys' record producer Ron Chancey, whose
wife fell in love with it after hearing it on a demonstration tape.
It was then recorded by the group as a favor to her, Vanwarmer said.
   ``One perk of being a songwriter is exorcising your feelings as
they come along,'' he said. ``And people can exorcise theirs as
they listen too.''
   He wrote it on Christmas Eve as he sat alone at home before
gathering with family members.
   ``It was emotion from the heart. It wrote itself.''

   Loewe, whose partnership with lyricist Alan Jay Lerner produced

friend of 45 years. ``The world will always hear him speak, feel
his emotions, for he has only put on a shroud that makes him
invisible. He broke hearts on Valentine's Day. But perhaps, at
last, he found his Camelot.''
   Skelton will deliver the eulogy this week during a memorial
service here. The comedian said Loewe was much loved by members of
this exclusive desert community, and was also friends with area
residents Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra.
   ``I'm very sad. He was an adorable person under his very rough
manner,'' said French actress Leslie Caron, who starred in
``Gigi.'' ``I was quite fond of him. He looked a bit like Edward G.
Robinson playing a gangster ... When I first met him he put me off.
Then I realized he was a softy.''
   ``He was a very sentimental and gentle man. He was always happy
and never gloomy,'' Skelton added.
   The Lerner-Loewe team enchanted audiences with tunes from such
classic musicals as ``Gigi,'' ``Camelot,'' ``My Fair Lady'' and
``Brigadoon.''
   Some of the other songs the team produced were ``Almost Like
Being in Love,'' ``I Could Have Danced All Night,'' and ``Get Me to
the Church on Time.''
   Actor-dancer Gene Kelly, who starred in the film version of
``Brigadoon,'' praised Loewe as ``a fine musician who did great
things.''
   ``I was lucky to do `Brigadoon,' because it was a singer's
picture,'' Kelly recalled. ``But Frederick helped make it a
dancer's picture with my small Irish tenor called upon to sing all
those wonderful songs. He was a fantastic man, an eccentric and an
adventurer.''
   Loewe, known as Fritz, died Sunday at 1:51 p.m. at Desert
Hospital, where he had been admitted Wednesday for chest pains.
   Loewe had strong ties to the hospital, donating most of the
funds to build the Frederick Loewe Pediatric Pavilion in 1971, said
Bob Barcklay, the hospital's acting chief executive officer. Loewe
also donated royalties from some of his songs to the pediatric
unit, which are used each year to buy Christmas gifts and toys for
sick children there, he added.
   Lerner died in 1986. His widow, actress Liz Robertson, was in
Manchester, England, on Monday performing in a revival of ``My Fair
Lady.'`
   ``He was just a wonderful generous man who wrote the most
extraordinary, beautiful music. I'm pleased to be performing `My
Fair Lady' on stage in Manchester so that I can celebrate his life
by singing his music tonight,'' she said.
   Lerner and Loewe's partnership began with a one-night flop in
Detroit in 1942. They parted bitterly after ``Camelot,'' their last
Broadway hit, in 1960. After a 1973 reunion for the Broadway
production of ``Gigi,'' originally written in 1958 as a movie, they
remained friends.
   Loewe was born June 10, 1901, to a distinguished musical family
in Vienna, Austria. He began piano lessons as a boy and at 13 was
the youngest pianist to appear as soloist with the Berlin Symphony.
Loewe was 15 when he published ``Katrina,'' a song that sold 2
million copies on sheet music in Europe.
   He came to the United States in 1924 and later wandered the
country prospecting for gold, herding cattle, delivering mail on
horseback and teaching riding at a New Hampshire resort. As a
bantamweight boxer in Brooklyn, he won eight of nine professional
bouts.
   In 1931, Loewe married Ernestine Zerline, whom he divorced after
26 years together with no children. He has no survivors.
   He began his collaboration with Lerner after accepting an offer
from a stock company in Detroit to adapt a farce, ``The Patsy.''
   Lerner's fascination with the Scottish writer Sir James Barrie
led to the team's first hit show, ``Brigadoon,'' and their first
hit song, ``Almost Like Being in Love,'' in 1947.
   Loewe and Lerner went their separate ways for a time, but
reunited in 1951 to produce ``Paint Your Wagon.''
   Next came ``My Fair Lady'' in 1956, a musical adaptation of
George Bernard Shaw's ``Pygmalion.'' The cast included Rex Harrison
and Julie Andrews and ran for 2,717 performances.
   It won Loewe the first of two Tony Awards and the 1964 film
adaptation won several Academy Awards, including best picture.
   The team also produced a film musical, ``Gigi,'' based on a
novella by Colette, in 1958. It was the first film to win nine
Academy Awards, including an Oscar to Loewe as co-writer of the
title song.
   The next project was ``Camelot.'' Critics were hard on the
musical when it arrived in 1960 but it was greatly loved by
President John F. Kennedy, whose short-lived administration was
later dubbed Camelot by admirers.

<P>
To win an important award is an honor, the significance of which has been 
slowly diluted by the proliferation of media ceremonies. Today the rarest and 
most prestigious tributes go to the men and women who, in effect, have 
themselves become awards. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett Lester Carter has just joined the elite group. Last month, at the 
Hollywood Bowl, the first annual "Benny" award, in the form of a bronze bust of 
Carter, commissioned by the American Federation of Jazz Societies and sculpted 
by the bassist-turned-artist John Heard, was presented to Carter. In future 
years it will go to others who come closest to matching his achievements. 
</P>
<P>
Such artists will be hard to find. Carter today, instead of resting on the 
laurels accumulated during overlapping careers as saxophonist, composer, 
arranger, bandleader, songwriter, trumpeter and drafter of scores for 
television series and movies, remains as active as ever. He has just composed 
his first-ever extended piece for two vibraphones, to be premiered Tuesday 
evening at New York's Avery Fisher Hall, with Milt Jackson and Bobby Hutcherson 
in the featured roles. An hour after the concert ends, his 83rd birthday will 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm calling it 'Good Vibes,' " he said over tea at his Los Angeles home 
overlooking the Valley. "It will run from 30 to 40 minutes; the Classical Jazz 
Orchestra, a repertory ensemble, will perform it. Bobby Hutcherson will double 
on vibes and marimba, an instrument you don't hear often enough. It's a long 
the lines of the 'Kansas City Suite,' which I wrote for Count Basie in 1960 -- 
a swinging thing, with ballad and Latin interludes. We'll probably record the 
whole suite in a studio a few days later." 
</P>
<P>
Carter's recording career is in higher gear than ever. He is a guest soloist on 
a current album of his tunes recorded by pianist Marian McPartland, for 
Concord. Next month the session he recorded with Phil Woods, an alto 
saxophonist who came out of the Charlie Parker generation, will be issued by 
Music Masters. 
</P>
<P>
"Phil is younger than my daughter," he says, "but age has never been an issue. 
I wrote a song called 'My Man Phil' -- words and music; I sang it on the record 
-- and he dedicated a number to me." 
</P>
<P>
Lyric writing is the newest addition to Carter's arsenal of talents. Over the 
years he has had such collaborators as Johnny Mercer ("A Kiss From You") and 
Sammy Cahn ("Only Trust Your Heart") but lately he has devoted himself to the 
serious study of how lyrics are devised. 
</P>
<P>
In the works now is a Benny Carter songbook album that will belatedly bring 
together, in vocal version on one CD, some of his best known standards, among 
them "Blues in My Heart" (1930), "When Lights are Low" (1936), "All That Jazz" 
(from the Sammy Davis movie "A Man Called Adam") and "Key Largo." 
</P>
<P>
Also due sooner or later is "Benny Carter: Symphony in Riffs," a 60-minute 
documentary that has been shown and praised in England while ironically an 
American release is still to be set. The film, narrated by Burt Lancaster, 
includes splendid evocations of Harlem in the '20s and of Carter's expatriate 
years and Hollywood movie successes. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's gift for melodic creation has been expressed most memorably through 
his improvisations on alto saxophone. The logic, symmetry and beauty of these 
solos set a standard that has never been outdated, despite the inroads of bop, 
modality, the avant-garde and whatever other movements have prevailed since his 
style was essentially set in the 1930s. His orchestral arrangements, 
particularly those of a five-piece sax section on such records as "Further 
Definitions" in the early 1960s, are paradigms of skill and sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's writing has been interpreted with panache by musicians at a 
one-or-two-generation remove from him. Those who played in his orchestra at the 
recent Hollywood Bowl concert (and who will return when he shares a bill there 
with Ella Fitzgerald Aug. 22) range from musicians in their 30s (saxophonist 
Jeff Clayton and his bassist brother John) to others in their 60s, like the 
trombonist Buster Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
He has gone from being the youngest man in the band ("I was only 23 when I 
joined Fletcher Henderson") to becoming the oldest. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's longevity has enabled him to triumph over many obstacles -- most 
conspicuously racism, which he has opposed actively on many levels, whether it 
was fighting to retain ownership of a home in Hollywood against the objections 
of bigoted neighbors, or taking an active role in eliminating the segregated 
musicians' unions that long existed in Los Angeles, until the two combined in 
1953. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's achievements in broadening the vocabulary of the music world he has 
inhabited for 65 years have involved most of jazz history's honored names: he 
has played with (or written arrangements or conducted for) Benny Goodman, Glenn 
Miller, Dizzy Gillespie, Django Reinhardt, Max Roach, Buddy Rich, Quincy Jones, 
Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Dexter Gordon, Coleman Hawkins -- not to 
mention Ella and Peggy and Sarah and Carmen and a constellation of other 
singers. He has outlived many contemporaries, but those who have survived are 
all good friends. 
</P>
<P>
It becomes hard to find a negative word to say about Benny Carter, to avoid the 
overtones of press agentry. For the record, then, let it be said that he was a 
co-composer of "Cow Cow Boogie," a song of which he is less than proud ("but it 
made a fair amount of money for me"), and that his singing is, well, not on the 
level of his other accomplishments. At that point the negatives have to stop. 
</P>
<P>
The tributes, though, go on and on; just last month, with a thousand names from 
which to choose, an international panel of 64 jazz critics voted him Jazzman of 
the Year in a Down Beat poll. 
</P>
<P>
He has done it all and won them all -- what possible unrealized ambition can 
remain? 
</P>
<P>
"Easy," he said, "To live to be a hundred -- and in good health." 
</P>
<P>
Don't bet against it.
