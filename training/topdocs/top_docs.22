<HEAD>States Consider Laws Requiring Companies to Insure Workers</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Poor-Insurance, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a list of some of the states considering legislation to
help workers who have no health insurance. Hawaii and Massachusetts
have laws requiring employers to insure their workers.
   _Alaska: A bill in the Senate would provide up to 10,000
uninsured people with state-subsidized health insurance. Lawmakers
also are considering a mandatory insurance bill based on
Massachusetts' law.
   _California: Five bills have been introduced, including one
requiring companies with five or more employees to provide health
care benefits. About 2.7 million workers are uninsured, or about
one out of 10 California residents.
   _Delaware: A measure pending in a Senate committee is aimed at
providing insurance for the indigent. Between 80,000 and 90,000
people are uninsured.
   _Florida: Legislators are considering a measure based on
Massachusetts' law, requiring employers to insure their employees.
An estimated 1 million to 2 million people, or one-sixth of
Florida's population, are uninsured.
   _Georgia: The General Assembly passed a measure creating a
high-risk health insurance pool that will arrange health insurance
for those who could not previously qualify for insurance. About 2
million people are uninsured.
   _Illinois: A bill would require businesses with five or more
employees to provide health benefits for employees who work more
than 17{ hours weekly. About 1.5 million Illinoisans have neither
private health insurance nor Medicaid, or more than 13 percent of
the state's 11 million people.
   _Indiana: The state General Assembly is considering a measure
that would create a commission to study the need for
state-sponsored health care services. Indiana has 769,000 people,
or about 17 percent of the population, with no insurance.
   _Iowa: A bill passed by a House committee creates a $200,000
study, eventually calling for businesses with 40 or more employees
to provide insurance coverage. About 350,000 people, or more than
10 percent of the state's population, are uninsured.
   _Kansas: A bill in the appropriations committee seeks to
establish an insurance ``buy-in'' program for workers who meet
poverty guidelines and whose employers do not provide coverage.
About 480,000 Kansans, or 14 percent of the state's population, are
uninsured.
   _Minnesota: Bills pending in the House and Senate aim to
guarantee that all Minnesotans have access to affordable health
insurance. About 400,000 people, or 9.3 percent of the state's
population, are uninsured.
   _New York: A pilot program will provide health insurance to
14,500 uninsured New Yorkers, mostly those unemployed or employees
of small companies. About 2.5 million people are uninsured, and 75
percent of them are working.
   _Ohio: A House bill would require insurance coverage for
low-paid workers with a 1 percent payroll tax on employers. About
1.4 million of Ohio's 11 million residents are uninsured.
   _Oklahoma: A bill seeks to provide `insurance of last resort''
to workers without health insurance. An estimated 636,800 people
are uninsured out of a population of 3.3 million.
   _Oregon: The Senate approved a bill that would revamp the
federal-state Medicaid program with the aim of covering more poor
people. About 400,000 people are uninsured, about 15 percent of
Oregon's population of 2.7 million.
   _South Carolina: Lawmakers are considering a measure that
creates an accident and health insurance pool to help uninsured
workers. About 440,000 of South Carolina's 3.1 million people are
working without insurance and are ineligible for Medicaid.
   _Vermont: Lawmakers are considering a plan to help small
companies provide health insurance to their workers. About 31,000
of Vermont's 550,000 residents are uninsured.
   _Virginia: The General Assembly passed a $14.8 million program
to provide medical care for those with little or no health
insurance. About 880,000 of Virginia's 5.9 million residents have
little or no insurance.
   _Washington: The state's five-year Basic Health pilot project
provides health care to the ``working poor'' who are not covered by
welfare programs. About 720,000 people, or 16 percent of
Washington's residents, are uninsured.

<HEAD>Population Gains to Give Sunbelt States More Seats in Congress</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts new 6th graf with 1980 population</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The flow of Americans to California has pushed
the Golden State far ahead of all rivals in population and will
give it a record 52 seats in the 1992 House of Representatives, new
census figures indicate.
   Preliminary 1990 population figures show California picking up
seven House seats, followed by Florida with four, Texas three and a
handful of other warm-weather states with one each.
   New York hung on to its No. 2 ranking in population behind
California in the new figures _ with Texas and Florida closing fast
in third and fourth places _ but will lose three seats in Congress
because its population rose only slightly in the 1980s.
   Four Northern industrial states _ Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and
Pennsylvania _ lost population during the decade and will have two
fewer seats each.
   The Census Bureau estimated a national count of just under 246
million, including 29.3 million in California, 17.6 million in New
York, 16.8 million in Texas and 12.8 million in Florida. Wyoming
was last, at just under 450,000, passed by Alaska, which had the
smallest population in 1980 but grew to almost 546,000 in 1990.
   The total population count in 1980 was 226,545,805.
   House seats are redistributed among the states after each
Census. Because the number is limited to 435 seats, when a growing
state gains a seat some other state must lose one.
   New York's slight population gain was quickly disputed by state
officials, who had predicted repeatedly that the state would be
undercounted.
   ``I don't believe it,'' Gov. Mario Cuomo said in Albany. ``Do
you really, honestly believe that everybody who should be counted
has been counted? The answer is of course not. My mother had
trouble; she didn't want to answer.''
   New York Mayor David N. Dinkins called the city's estimated
slight decline ``unadulterated nonsense'' and promised to pinpoint
where he said the government had made errors.
   Overall 19 House seats will change states according to the
figures, which could change significantly before the final report
is issued Dec. 31.
   The widely noted movement of Americans to the Sun Belt was
documented anew in the Census Bureau figures. Besides California,
Florida and Texas, states gaining a House seat each were Arizona,
Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
   Besides the two-seat losers _ Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and
Pennsylvania _ there will be one less seat each for Iowa, Kansas,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey and West
Virginia.
   Overall, the preliminary Census figures show the United States
with a population of 245,837,683 residents. That's somewhat below
the 250 million that the bureau had estimated earlier this year.
   However, 4 million or more may be added as the Census Bureau
conducts follow up counts and completes tabulations before the
final reports are made public. If those are added in only a few
states, some of the seats allocated in the preliminary tally could
shift again.
   For example, a study by the private firm Election Data Services
showed Kentucky and Mississippi neck and neck for the last seat
allocated. Mississippi got the seat, but a shift of 3,000 people
could shift it to Kentucky.
   Kimball Brace, head of EDS, stressed that the figures are
subject to change.
   In addition to changes made after local officials assess the
preliminary figures, there is a chance that the final report could
be adjusted next summer.
   The bureau has been criticized for undercounting minorities in
the past and is conducting a post-census check on its count this
time. If officials determine that some group has been missed a
decision could be made to statistically adjust the final numbers.
   That ruling will be made by the Department of Commerce in
mid-July 1991.
   The national total was completed Wednesday with the reports for
the final four states _ New York, Texas, Illinois and Pennsylvania.
   Census officials emphasize that the figures are provided to
allow local governments to question the results in the event people
were missed or overcounted.

   Census Bureau
   Says It Missed
   2% of Population

   WASHINGTON -- The 1990 census missed more individuals --
both proportionately and in absolute numbers -- than in 1980,
undercounting the U.S. population by 2%, according to
preliminary findings by the Census Bureau.
   The new estimates could have far-reaching effects on
congressional redistricting and the allocation of federal
dollars to state and local governments.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The findings are based on two Census Bureau projects: a
post-enumeration survey conducted in selected areas after the
1990 census and a demographic analysis of state, local and
federal administrative records.
   The census count for 1990 is 248,709,873 nationwide.
According to the post-enumeration figures, however, the
census count should be somewhere between 252,982,000 and
254,989,000.
   Under a 1989 court order in a lawsuit brought by New York
City and several other cities, the Bush administration must
decide by mid-July whether to adjust the 1990 count based on
the post-enumeration survey. The decision will be made after
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher reviews recommendations
by the Census Bureau and several independent experts
concerning the post-enumeration data.
   The post-enumeration findings "continue to strengthen the
case that failure to adjust will cause substantial damage in
many, many places across the country," said Rep. Tom Sawyer
(D., Ohio), who heads the House census and population
subcommittee.
   But Census officials were quick to warn that the
post-enumeration data could reflect errors in the
post-enumeration survey itself rather than in the census
count. "We know we have the symptoms of an undercount," said
C. Louis Kincannon, bureau deputy director. But he stressed
the need to make sure that the "cure is not worse than the
ailment."
   If the population count is adjusted, California and other
Western states probably will gain the greatest benefits,
along with the District of Columbia and the rest of the
South-Atlantic region, according to the post-enumeration
estimates. In both regions, the census undercount was found
to be proportionally greater than it was for the entire U.S.
   The regions that will benefit the least from an adjustment
include New England, the Mid-Atlantic area and the Midwest.
No state figures are likely to be adjusted downward, but
population counts for certain cities and counties in states
such as Pennsylvania and Ohio might be lowered, according to
bureau assistant director Peter Bounpane.
   Despite doubts about the post-enumeration data, it isn't
likely the bureau's demographic analysis data will change
significantly, Mr. Bounpane said. According to the analysis,
the 1990 census missed 1.8% of the population, compared with
1.3% in 1980.
   The undercount appears to be particularly sharp for
blacks. According to the bureau's demographic analysis, the
census failed to count 7.2% of the black population, compared
with 4.7% in 1980. A bureau official said the black
population is harder to count than the population at large,
possibly because a high proportion of blacks are low-income.
A black majority in the District of Columbia may explain why
the census apparently missed a huge fraction of people living
in the bureau's back yard: According to the post-enumeration
survey, roughly 4% to 8% of all Washington, D.C., residents
were uncounted.

<HEAD>Census Shows 249.6 Million Americans; Sun Belt Still a Gainer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation grew to 249.6 million people in the
1980s as more Americans left the industrial and agricultural
heartlands for the South and West.
   The Census Bureau's first ``final'' figures from the 1990
census, released Wednesday, showed the pull of the Sun Belt
remained strong, despite efforts by the industrial North to promote
growth and the collapse during the 1980s of the oil and savings and
loan industries - two mainstays of the Southern and Western states.
   The census figures are used to adjust the number of
representatives each state sends to Congress so that political
clout is in line with population. The figures also determine the
division of federal money among states and localities.
   The numbers could change next summer when the Commerce
Department decides whether to adjust the count. Some states and
cities are likely to challenge the tallies, whichever way the
adjustment decision goes.
   More than 6,000 local governments challenged the accuracy of a
preliminary count based mainly on the April 1 census taken by mail.
The Census Bureau responded with a series of recounts and an ad
campaign urging people who thought they had been missed to come
forward.
   In New York, Mayor David Dinkins criticized the count released
Wednesday, saying it underestimated the city's population and as a
result will cost the city millions of dollars in federal funds each
year.
   ``Since at least 1940, the Commerce Department and the Census
Bureau have systematically under counted Americans of color and
Americans who live in cities,'' Dinkins said at a City Hall news
conference.
   The Census Bureau's final national population total was nearly 4
million people more than the preliminary number it released earlier
this year.
   Five states, all in the South or West, grew by more than a
fourth in the decade: Nevada, up 50.7 percent; Alaska, 37.4
percent; Arizona, 35.3 percent; Florida, 33.4 percent; and
California, 26.1 percent.
   The six states having growth of less than 1 percent included
some industrial powerhouses: Illinois, up 0.4 percent;
Pennsylvania, 0.5 percent; Michigan, 0.7 percent; and Ohio, 0.8
percent. Grain-growing Nebraska grew by a bare 0.9 percent.
Louisiana, hard hit by the collapse in oil prices in the 1980s,
grew 0.8 percent.
   Five states lost population. The biggest percentage loser was
West Virginia, whose population dropped by 7.6 percent to
1,801,625. Other states losing population were Iowa, down 4.3
percent; Wyoming, down 2.9 percent; and North Dakota, down 1.7
percent. The District of Columbia also lost population, 4.5
percent.
   America's population grew at a slower pace in the 1980s than in
decades past: 10.2 percent, compared with 11.4 percent in the 1970s
and 13.4 percent in the 1960s.
   This year's population count, 249,632,692, for the first time
included some Americans living abroad. The 1980 population figure,
226,504,825, counted only people living within the nation's
borders.
   Wednesday's release was only the first burst of what will be a
barrage of census numbers detailing not only the number of people
but their ages, races, housing situations, incomes and a wealth of
other data.
   The last figures in the $2.6 billion census won't be released
until 1993.
   All regions had more people in 1990 compared with 10 years
earlier. The Pacific, Mountain and South Atlantic regions had the
sharpest growth, and the East North Central, West North Central and
East South Central regions had the slowest.
   The Pacific states were the fastest growing region, 23.4
percent, followed by the Mountain states, 20.6 percent, and the
South Atlantic states, 18.8 percent. In the 1970s those regions had
each showed double-digit growth.
   By contrast, the East North Central states grew a bare 1.1
percent; the West North Central states, 3.1 percent; and the East
South Central states, 3.9 percent. Those numbers represented a
falloff from each region's growth in the 1970s.
   Other facts from the census release:
   -Besides California, states gaining representatives will be
Florida, four; Texas, three; and Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina,
Virginia and Washington, one seat each.
   -States losing representatives will be New York, three;
Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, two each; and Iowa,
Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey and
West Virginia, one each.
   -The 1990 census counted 922,819 members of the armed forces,
civilian employees of the federal government and their dependents
living abroad. Other Americans living overseas weren't counted.

   The U.S. population stood at 249,632,692 as of
the 1990 census, the government said Wednesday in a numerical
portrait of a nation growing far more rapidly in the Sun Belt than
in the industrial north and agricultural heartland.
   California, the nation's largest state, added more than 6
million people in the decade, a 26.1 percent increase to 29,839,250
people.
   Wyoming remained the smallest state, with 455,975 people, down
2.9 percent from 1980.
   Nevada was the biggest population gainer in percentage terms,
and Florida and Arizona each grew by more than one-third as
millions of Americans flocked to the sunshine.
   West Virginia was the largest loser in percentage terms.
   In all, the population increased by 10.2 percent from the
226,504,825 people counted in the 1980 census, below the 11.4
percent population growth recorded from 1970 to 1980, and the 13.4
percent rate from 1960 to 1970.
   The information was contained in the Census Bureau's first
release of ``final figures'' - really tentative final figures -
from the 1990 count. The information will be used for everything
from readjusting the size of each state's congressional delegation
to parcelling out federal aid.
   In political terms, the population shifts will give California
seven new House seats, and add lawmakers to seven other states.
Thirteen states will lose representation.
   Because of the importance of the population estimates, some
states and cities are likely to challenge the tallies, and a final
count isn't expected until next summer.
   The cost of the 1990 census, from planning begun in 1984 to a
final release of data in 1993, is estimated at $2.6 billion by the
bureau.
   Still locked in Census Bureau computers - to be doled out over
the next several years - is a wealth of information about age,
race, living conditions and other details of America near the turn
of the century.
   Besides Wyoming, four other states lost population. The biggest
percentage loser was West Virginia, whose population dropped by 7.6
percent to 1,801,625. Other states losing population were Iowa,
down 4.3 percent, and and North Dakota, down 1.7 percent. The
District of Columbia also lost population, 4.5 percent.
   The sharpest gainer in percentage terms was Nevada. That state's
population grew by 50.7 percent to 1,206,152. Besides California,
other states with gains of more than 25 percent were Florida, up
33.4 percent; Arizona, up 35.3 percent; and Alaska, up 37.4
percent.
   The Pacific states were the fastest growing region, 23.4
percent, followed by the Mountain states, 20.6 percent, and the
South Atlantic states, 18.8 percent. By contrast, the East North
Central states grew a bare 1.1 percent, and the West North Central
states, 3.1 percent.
   Some regions went against the broader trend. New England, which
had a boom in high-tech industry during the 1980s, grew by 7.2
percent. The East South Central states grew only 3.9 percent.
   Because of the high financial and political stakes, the census
numbers and the way they were obtained are certain to draw
continued sharp scrutiny.
   More than 6,000 local governments challenged the accuracy of a
preliminary count based mainly on the April 1 census taken by mail.
The Census Bureau responded with a series of recounts and an ad
campaign urging people who thought they had been missed to come
forward.
   The final national population total was nearly 4 million people
more than the preliminary number released by the bureau earlier
this year.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher has until July 1991, to
decide whether to adjust the census numbers to account for a
statistically determined undercount of minorities. An adjustment
would increase political representation of areas with a high
percentage of minorities, and lower that of other areas.
   California will gain seven seats, giving it 52 in the 435-member
House. Florida will gain four; Texas, three; and Arizona, Georgia,
North Carolina, Virginia and Washington, one seat each.
   New York will lose three seats; Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and
Pennsylvania, two seats each; and Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey and West Virginia,
one seat each.
   The 1990 census for the first time counted some Americans living
abroad. The total included 922,819 members of the armed forces,
civilian employees of the federal government and their dependents.
   The comparable numbers from 10 years earlier counted only people
living within the United States.
   The Census Bureau on Wednesday released two sets of 1980
numbers. The 226,504,825 figure used by the bureau for comparison
with the 1990 national total was released in December 1980 but was
later adjusted slightly to get rid of minor problems. The adjusted
figure was 226,545,805.
   The 1990 population count was nearly 64 times the 3,929,214
counted in 1790, the first census in the nation's history. By 1900,
the population had reached 76,212,168.
   In 1950, the first census after World War II, the population was
151,325,798.
   In January, the Census Bureau will begin sending information on
small areas, in some cases the size of a city block, to state
legislatures so they can begin drawing new congressional and
legislative boundaries.
   That process will be completed by April 1.
   The bureau will put off releasing detailed demographic data
until after the decision on adjusting the figures.

   Census Bureau Adds 3.8 Million to Count
   But Critics Say Millions Remain Missing

   WASHINGTON -- The Census Bureau added 3.8 million more
people to its 1990 headcount, but critics continue to
complain that the bureau is missing millions more.
   The bureau said yesterday that its almost-final tally from
the 1990 census is 249,632,692 people, 10.2% more than the
1980 census found.

<TEXT>
   The addition of 3.8 million people to the preliminary
total released this summer reflects 2.9 million residents the
bureau missed the first time as well as the anticipated
922,819 military and other federal employees and dependents
overseas.
   Under the Constitution, the new headcount will result in a
shift of 19 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
   California is the big winner, adding seven seats to give
it 52 representatives, or nearly 12% of all the seats in the
435-member House. New York is the big loser. It will lose
three seats and end up with 31 seats after the 1992 election.
   The 1990 tally includes military and other federal workers
and dependents living overseas. The 1980 tally didn't.
Excluding those people, the resident population of the U.S.
grew by 9.8% during the 1980s, Census Bureau Director Barbara
Bryant said.
   The bureau may yet make additional adjustments to the
tally. Under terms of an out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit
brought by New York City and others who argued that the
census disproportionately misses minorities, the Commerce
Department must decide by July 15 whether to adjust the
tallies statistically to compensate for the undercount.
Commerce Undersecretary Michael Darby yesterday called the
1990 census "full, fair and efficient."
   But congressional skepticism persists. "It's not a
question of whether we have counted everyone. The census
never does," said Rep. Thomas Sawyer (D., Ohio), chairman of
the House census subcommittee. "The question is how close
they've come to the truth."
   New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams, among those
suing the bureau, was quick to complain that the 1990 census
still undercounted his state. "When large segments of our
residents are left out of the political process, democracy is
devalued for all of us," he said.
   Additions to the preliminary tally reflect, among other
things, recanvassing of a substantial number of housing units
by census enumerators. With aid from state and local
governments, the bureau also identified about 125,000 housing
units it had missed. It also turned up an extra 400,000
people from parole records, Mrs. Bryant said recently.
   Mr. Darby noted that the new tally is "surprisingly close"
to earlier projections that the census would find a
population of 250 million. But Rep. Sawyer noted that the
249.6 million total is still substantially shy of the
bureau's recent projections, based on demographic data, of
253.4 million.
   The 1990 census confirms trends identified in earlier
reports, such as the rapid growth of the western states. "The
West is the big population gainer," Mrs. Bryant said. In the
past decade, the population of the West has grown by 22%,
while the South grew by 13.5%, the Northeast by 3.4%, and the
Midwest by 1.3%.
   The reassignment of seats in the House reflects these
trends, with the West and Sunbelt states gaining at the
expense of the big industrial states of the Northeast and
Midwest. In addition to California, states adding seats
include Florida, which gains four seats; Texas, which gains
three seats; and Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia
and Washington, which each gain one seat.
   Besides New York, states losing seats include Illinois,
Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, which each lose two seats;
and Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts,
Montana, New Jersey and West Virginia, which each lose one
seat.
   None of these shifts comes as a surprise, however. Earlier
bureau reports on the 1990 count pointed to all of them.
   The figures may provide new ammunition for the District of
Columbia's perennially unsuccessful campaign for statehood.
Although the census found that the district lost population
during the 1980s, it still is larger than either Vermont,
Alaska or Wyoming. Yet the district hasn't any seats in the
Senate, and its one representative in the House can't vote.
   The bureau also noted yesterday that four states lost
population in the 1980s. They are Iowa, North Dakota, West
Virginia and Wyoming.

<HEAD>Half of All Americans Live in 37 Metro Areas</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two centuries after the United States was
founded as a largely agricultural nation, nearly nine-tenths of the
population growth is occurring in metropolitan areas, the Census
Bureau reports.
   Almost half of all Americans reside in just 37 major urban
areas, the bureau said Thursday in a new analysis of the patterns
of growth. And the metropolitan share of the population is growing
faster than that in rural areas.
   The ``rural renaissance'' reported in the 1970s when small towns
and rural areas were growing seems to have ended, with increases in
cities and suburbs now well in the lead.
   The census study found that about 86 percent of the nation's
population growth since 1980 has occurred in the 282 officially
designated metropolitan areas across the country. That pattern
represents a return to the metropolitan area dominance that has
been common since the era of the Great Depression, the bureau
reported.
   The analysis of 1987 figures found that nearly half of all
Americans, 48.9 percent, reside in the 37 metro areas with
populations of a million or more.
   Led by New York and Los Angeles, these metro areas had 119
million residents in 1987, the Bureau said.
   New Jersey leads the way as the only state entirely included
within metropolitan areas, the bureau noted. The northern portion
of the state is included in the greater New York metro area while
the southern portion is part of the Philadelphia region.
   Seven other states have more than 90 percent of their
populations in metropolitan areas _ California, Maryland,
Connecticut, Rhode Island, Florida, Massachusetts and New York.
   Idaho is the least metropolitan state with only about 20 percent
of its residents in urban areas, the report added.
   Reflecting the nation's overall population trend, metropolitan
area growth has tended to flow to the South and West in recent
years, the Census Bureau observed in its study of growth patterns
between 1980 and 1987.
   The population loss experienced in the Northeast during the
1970s has halted in this decade, the agency found, while the
Midwest has continued to have net losses in recent years.
   ``A slowdown in population growth has taken place since 1980 in
much of the interior of the United States, especially in
nonmetropolitan areas,'' noted the report prepared by Donald E.
Starsinic and Richard L. Forstall.
   During this decade the nonmetropolitan population declined in 10
contiguous states _ Ohio, West Virginia, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa,
Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas, the
bureau pointed out.
   The nation's metro areas with 1 million or more residents, as of
July 1, 1987, were New York, 18.0 million; Los Angeles, 13.5
million; Chicago, 8.1 million; San Francisco, 5.9 million;
Philadelphia, 5.9 million; Detroit, 4.6 million; Boston, 4.1
million; Dallas, 3.7 million;
   Also Washington, 3.6 million; Houston, 3.6 million; Miami, 2.9
million; Cleveland, 2.7 million; Atlanta, 2.6 million; St. Louis,
2.4 million; Seattle, 2.3 million; Minneapolis, 2.3 million;
Baltimore, 2.3 million; Pittsburgh, 2.3 million;
   And San Diego, 2.3 million; Tampa, 1.9 million; Phoenix, 1.9
million; Denver, 1.8 million; Cincinnati, 1.7 million; Milwaukee,
1.5 million; Kansas City, 1.5 million; Portland, Ore., 1.4 million;
Norfolk, Va., 1.3 million;
   Plus Sacramento, 1.3 million; New Orleans, 1.3 million;
Columbus, Ohio, 1.3 million; San Antonio, Texas, 1.3 million;
Indianapolis, 1.2 million; Buffalo, N.Y., 1.2 million; Providence,
R.I., 1.1 million; Charlotte, N.C., 1.1 million; Hartford, Conn.,
1.1 million and Salt Lake City, 1.1 million.

population living in metropolitan areas as of July 1, 1987:

<HEAD>Democrats Mobilizing to Protest Preliminary Census Figures</HEAD>

   Democrats are mobilizing local officials to
protest preliminary census figures and pressure the government to
take another look at the count for the nation's cities and rural
areas.
   ``I don't believe it,'' New York Gov. Mario Cuomo said Wednesday
when the Census Bureau estimated that his state's population grew
by fewer than 70,000 during the past decade.
   ``Way out of line,'' Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson said of the
estimate for his city.
   An analysis done for Democratic state legislators said the
preliminary figures for rural areas, particularly in the South,
were consistently below the population estimates issued by the
Census Bureau in February.
   With the release of numbers for New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania
and Texas, the Census Bureau completed its estimate of the
population for all 50 states.
   Overall, the preliminary census figures show the United States
with a population of 245,837,683. Ten years ago, the census set the
nation's population at 226,545,805.
   To no one's surprise, the numbers showed Americans continued to
move South and West during the past 10 years.
   Nineteen U.S. House seats will follow that population shift to
the Sun Belt.
   That trend was good news for Republicans, who consider the Sun
Belt the area of their strongest growth. But a similar trend in the
1980 Census, when 17 House seats shifted South and West, failed to
yield expected GOP gains because most of the state legislators who
drew the new district lines were Democrats.
   The big winner when the shift takes place in time for the 1992
election will be California, which is expected to gain seven new
House seats for a total of 52. With a population expected to push
close to 30 million, California would have 21 more House seats than
the second-largest state, New York.
   Based on the preliminary population figures, Florida would gain
four House seats and Texas three. Picking up one each would be
Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
   New York would lose three House seats and Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Michigan and Illinois two each. Losing one seat each would be Iowa,
Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey and
West Virginia.
   Officials who think the Census Bureau missed a lot of people in
their areas have 15 working days to submit information to support
claims they were undercounted.
   Mayor David Dinkins of New York called the estimate that his
city lost 40,000 people ``unadulterated nonsense'' and pledged to
``comb through the bureau's data to locate those areas where the
count is too low, identifying housing units the bureau overlooked
and buildings it missed entirely.''
   ``Do you really honestly believe everybody who should be counted
was counted?'' Cuomo asked. Answering his own question, the
governor said, ``Of course not. My mother had trouble. She didn't
want to answer.''
   Rep. Vic Fazio of California, chairman of the House Democratic
group monitoring reapportionment, urged local officials to
challenge the preliminary figures.
   ``Now is not the time to be ringing partisan alarm bells,'' said
Fazio. ``But when a Republican administration is on a track leading
us to a less than fair and accurate census count, Democrats must
challenge at every opportunity available.''
   Kimball Brace, president of Election Data Services, a consulting
firm that analyzes census data for Democratic state legislators,
told a news conference that the figures were subject to
considerable adjustment before the government comes out with final
numbers on Dec. 31. Even then, the Commerce Department will have
until July 15, 1991, to determine whether to adjust for an
undercount.
   Brace said he understood the Census Bureau has found up to 4
million additional people but has not yet included them in the
state figures. He said no estimate was available on where those
people are distributed among the states.
   Brace cited Alabama, Louisiana and Tennessee as states where
figures for rural areas were well below earlier estimates.

   The industrial states of the Midwest and
Northeast are pulling out of the population doldrums and adding
people once again, the Census Bureau reported Thursday.
   ``The industrial-based states of Indiana, Michigan and Ohio
continue to recover from the early 1980s population losses,'' the
bureau said. ``These three states added more population between 1986
and 1988 than in the previous five years combined.''
   In addition, the Northeast's population growth between 1985 and
1988 was the highest since the late 1960s, the Bureau said.
   And the report came just one day after the bureau and the
Department of Agriculture reported that the nation's rural
population had halted its long-term decline.
   Growth was sluggish in states with energy-based economies, the
bureau added, particularly Alaska, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, West
Virginia and Wyoming.
   But the other trends notwithstanding, the bureau noted that the
nation's overall growth pattern continues to favor Sun Belt states
like California and Florida.
   At least since 1970, the Western region has remained the fastest
growing section of the nation, with the South second, the bureau
noted in the study ``State Population and Household Estimates, With
Age, Sex and Components of Change: 1981-88.''
   ``The East North Central states increased by 443,000 from 1985 to
1988 after population losses during the 1980-85 period,'' the report
said. ``Indiana, Michigan and Ohio added more population in the
three-year period between 1986 and 1988 than in the previous
six-year period.''
   The Northeast lost population between 1975 and 1980 but has since
recovered, the report said, and annual growth of 0.5 percent between
1985 and 1988 is the highest since 1970. Indeed, half of New
England's growth between 1980 and 1988 has occurred just since 1985.
   Slowed growth and population losses have plagued several
farm-oriented states in recent years. But, the bureau concluded,
``the downward slide seems to have reversed last year.'' Iowa showed
a slight new immigration, as did Nebraska, and South Dakota has
slowed its outmigration enough to experience population growth for
two consecutive years.
   The sluggish population growth in energy-dependent states is a
continuing problem, with West Virginia losing people every year in
this decade and even Texas, which added 59,000 people in the year
ending July 30, 1988, far below its peak growth of 1981-82, when it
agined 609,000.
   In fact, Texas experienced net outmigration last year, for the
second year in a row, the report said.
   Here is a state-by-state list showing the population of the
states according to the 1980 census and the estimates for 1985 and
1988, in thousands.

<HEAD>Eleven States Get Preliminary Population Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hawaii and Nevada have topped the 1-million
population mark, according to the Census Bureau, which is issuing
preliminary 1990 counts for 11 states.
   While 10 of the states showed population gains in data released
Friday, Ohio recorded a decline from the 1980 national head count.
   The bureau said that it had counted 10,777,514 people in Ohio,
down from 10,798,000 in 1980.
   Officials stressed that the reports are preliminary. They are
designed to give local officials a chance to raise questions if
they find areas where they believe people have been missed or
overcounted.
   The final, official, census counts are scheduled for release on
Dec. 31.
   Friday's report brings to 40 the number of states for which
preliminary counts have been published. The rest are expected in
the next week or two.
   Newly released state counts, and the census count in 1980 are:
   _Alaska, 545,774, up from 402,000.
   _Arizona, 3,619,064, up from 2,718,000.
   _Colorado, 3,272,460, up from 2,890,000.
   _Hawaii, 1,095,237, up from 965,000.
   _Kansas, 2,467,845, up from 2,364,000.
   _Maryland, 4,732,934, up from 4,217,000.
   _Nevada, 1,193,287, up from 800,000.
   _North Carolina, 6,552,927, up from 5,882,000.
   _Ohio, 10,777,514, down from 10,798,000.
   _Virginia, 6,127,680, up from 5,347,000.
   _Washington, 4,826,675, up from 4,132,000.

<HEAD>Dinkins Says Census Bureau Missed 1 Million New Yorkers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE CROCKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor David Dinkins has accused the Census
Bureau of skipping one out of every 13 housing units and missing up
to 1 million residents in its preliminary 1990 count of the city's
population.
   Dinkins said Wednesday the city is filing a challenge to the
government's figures. Federal aid and representation in Congress
are determined by the Census count.
   ``The 1990 undercount could cost us up to $1 billion in lost
federal aid, or $150 for each man, woman and child living in our
city,'' he said. Dinkins also said the count could cost the city at
least one seat in Congress.
   The mayor said the Census Bureau failed to count 254,534 housing
units, undercounting the city's population by 800,000 to 1 million.
   The Bureau counted 7.033 million people in the city. The
Department of City Planning estimates 8 million people live in the
city.
   ``It is statistically stunning and demographically absurd for
the Census Bureau to claim that a city whose resident birth rate
has risen by at least 23 percent and which has welcomed more than
800,000 legal immigrants to its shores during the past decade has
actually lost population,'' the mayor said.
   The city was given 15 business days to review the Bureau's 1990
preliminary figures. It did so by analyzing data from the city, Con
Edison and the New York Telephone Co., as well as consulting
surveys, atlases and aerial photographs.
   In his letter to Sheila Grimm, regional director of the Census
Bureau, Dinkins asked that the bureau review some 11,900 city
blocks - approximately 43 percent of the city's more than 28,000
residential blocks.
   The bureau has said it would take 10 days to review the city's
challenge.
   In a three-block area in one section of Queens, the city counted
567 housing units in what it said was a neighborhood of one-and
two-family homes; the Census Bureau counted zero units.
   Neighborhoods with minority populations, in general, tended to
be undercounted by the bureau, said Richard Schaffer, director of
the Department of City Planning and chairman of the City Planning
Commission.
   Dinkins said the 1980 undercount, put by the Census Bureau at
450,000, cost New York City some $675 million in federal aid during
the ensuing 10 years.

<P>
After complaining that preliminary 1990 census figures grossly underestimated
the growth of their populations over the past decade, officials in many big
cities -- including Los Angeles -- say that census counts may not be quite as
far off as the critics originally alleged.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, officials in Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and other
metropolitan areas continue to say that there were serious errors in the Census
Bureau's population count, which could cost local governments seats in Congress
and hundreds of millions of dollars in federal assistance.
</P>
<P>
In an official challenge forwarded to Washington late Monday, Los Angeles
officials said they had turned up 49,513 more dwellings than the 1.3 million
units counted by the Census Bureau. While that difference of 3.8% could
translate into thousands of people and millions of dollars in government aid,
the figure is well below the 10% housing underestimate Los Angeles officials
had originally predicted.
</P>
<P>
As it stands, the Census Bureau has put the city's 1990 population at 3.42
million -- 15% above the 1980 level. But the challenge over housing units, when
translated into residents, could bring that figure up by 123,783 -- a total
about equal to the population of Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
"The possibility of missing anyone who resides in the Los Angeles area can have
a devastating impact on the federal funds we may receive to provide needed city
services," Mayor Tom Bradley said from Frankfurt, West Germany, while on a
mission to promote tourism.
</P>
<P>
During the remainder of this week, cities and towns across the country will be
scurrying to complete formal responses to the initial census figures.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of last week, the Census Bureau had received formal responses
from 4,341, or 11%, of all local governments, but not all have formally
challenged the census numbers.
</P>
<P>
"We've actually received a lot of letters here accepting our counts, telling us
we were right in the ball park," said Denise Smith, an official in the Census
Bureau's regional office that covers all of New England and Upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
In Houston, a week before the deadline, officials were finding the local review
of housing units much closer to the census count than they had expected.
Nonetheless, city officials were challenging the Census Bureau's contention
that Houston has 1.61 million residents and essentially has not grown since
1980.
</P>
<P>
In Philadelphia, officials were disturbed but not surprised by the census
conclusion that population has eroded over the past decade, with city dwellers
fleeing in ever-larger numbers to the suburbs. While officials there thought
the census count was off, they also acknowledged that their numbers were not as
different as they had thought. Based on earlier estimates, city officials said
the census had overlooked as many as 97,000 dwellings. In fact, the post-census
review of building permits and other records showed that the census undercount
was closer to 67,000 units, said Barbara J. Kaplan, executive director of the
city Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
In a few places, officials continued to say the numbers would be as bad -- and
in some cases, worse -- than anticipated. In Chicago, a week before the
deadline, the difference between the census count and the local review was
"large and growing larger," said Susan Weed, a community development
demographer.
</P>
<P>
New York's deadline is also later this week, but officials there continued to
be outspoken in their criticism of the preliminary census count of 600,000
fewer residents than the city had a decade ago -- a situation that officials
say is preposterous, given their large homeless population and the city's
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
At a hearing in Washington last week, Barbara Everitt Bryant, the director of
the Census Bureau, responded sharply to the New York officials in her first
public statement since the agency released the preliminary 1990 counts last
month.
</P>
<P>
If New York's population did not drop, she said at the hearing, "Why did the
school enrollment drop by 54,000? Why do the moving vans show more people going
out than coming in?"
</P>
<P>
The bureau has until mid-October to assess the challenges, at which time it
will begin preparing a final gross count of the population, due on the
President's desk by Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
While these operations and last-minute efforts are under way to correct the
preliminary census count of 245.8 million, census statisticians will be
evaluating what is known as the post-enumeration survey, a statistical survey
analyzing how well the regular census did in finding such hard-to-count
residents as immigrants and inner-city residents.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, New York and other cities and states, along with civic and civil
rights groups, filed a lawsuit after the 1980 census seeking to force a
statistical correction of the 1990 census based on this study. Although the
lawsuit is pending, the commerce department did agree to conduct the study to
make an adjustment possible, if the Secretary of Commerce decides it is
necessary.

</P>
<P>
In San Diego, city officials said late Monday that they suspect the preliminary
Census Bureau figures -- which had accounted for 428,618 housing units -- are 1
1/2% to 2% low.
</P>
<P>
The comparison was due to be completed by late today, said Joey Perry, a senior
city planner.
</P>
<P>
"We are finding housing units they're missing," Perry said. "I'm not certain
we're finding that 1 1/2% to 2%. I'm hoping we are. But we're still in the
midst of doing our research on this."
</P>
<P>
The city is comparing every block in town where it believes the bureau has
undercounted by 15 or more housing units, Perry said.
</P>
<P>
The check does not involve much door-to-door footwork, she said. Instead, the
city is matching the figures against its own list of housing units per land
parcel.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary figures put the city's 1990 population at 1,094,524 and the
county's at 2,465,961, said Pat Chriss, the bureau's San Diego district office
manager. The final 1980 count for the city of San Diego was 875,538, according
to the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Chriss said she had not heard criticism that the San Diego counts were far too
low.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Perry said, the city had estimated its population at
1,118,282 -- or 2% higher than the preliminary census count of 1,094,524.
</P>
<P>
County planners were not available for comment.

      Census Bureau Sees
   Slow U.S. Growth Ahead
   ACCORDING TO projections published today by the Census Bureau, there will be nearly 250 million people in the U.S. by 1990, up 23.3 million from 1980.
If the 1990 census proves these figures correct, the U.S. population will have grown by only 10.3% this decade, the lowest rate in U.S. history except for the Depression years of the 1930s, when it was 7.2%.
The projections also indicate record low growth in the near future: 7.2% in the 1990s and 5.3% between 2000 and 2010.

   But the bureau foresees wide variation from state to state.
For example, it expects that during the 1980s, four states (Iowa, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio) will together have lost nearly 300,000 people.
At the other extreme, the four fastest-growing states (Arizona, Nevada, Florida and Alaska) are expected each to have grown more than 30%, adding a total of 4.6 million people.

   Fastest growth doesn't mean most growth, however.
About half of total U.S. growth for the rest of the century will occur in just three states -- Texas, Florida and California -- which are expected to gain 12 million people in the 1980s and 9.5 million in the 1990s.

   Interstate Migration
   Plays a Key Role
   THE CENSUS Bureau's projections assume that past trends in birth, death and migration rates will continue. Natural increase (births minus deaths) varies little from state to state, so interstate migration is often the key in determining future populations. For example, Michigan is projected to gain 435,000 people from natural increase during the 1990s -- but lose 498,000 to out-migration.
   While all 50 states are expected to show positive natural increase this decade, 24 will see that growth partially or completely offset by people leaving. Positive natural increase is seen for most states during the next decade as well, but Florida could be an unusual case. It is projected to have 20,000 more deaths than births between 1990 and 2000. A net in-migration of 2.6 million, though, will overwhelm this negative natural increase.
   Many factors can influence migration, perhaps even government intervention. New York state, which lost population in the 1970s, has lowered personal income tax rates and some business taxes. Coincidentally or not, it is expected to gain 215,000 people this decade.
   Workers Seen Carrying
   Fewer Dependents
   PROMISING A lighter burden of support, the overall dependency ratio in the U.S. is expected to decline to 57 by 2010 from 62 in 1987. The ratio measures the number of dependents (children under 18 and people 65 and older) for every 100 nondependents (those 18 to 64).
   The number of nondependents will rise 17% between 1990 and 2010, while that of dependents will grow only 7%, according to the Census Bureau's forecast. However, these figures mask differences between the young and the elderly, as well as among geographic regions.
   The number of people 65 and older is projected to grow 25% between 1990 and 2010, raising the elderly dependency ratio to 21.9 from 20.5. The ratio for those under 18 will drop to 34.8 from 41.5, as fewer children are born.
   The dependency ratio is based strictly on age groups and makes no assumptions about true dependence. In fact, more than 10% of the elderly were employed in 1987, and only 72% of working-age people were actually working.
   Study Profiles Network
   Of Family Support
   MORE THAN FOUR million Americans provide financial support to seven million young children living outside their households, according to another new Census Bureau report; two million provide support to three million adults outside their homes, mostly elderly parents. Of these providers, 6% are helping both children and adults who don't live with them. The bureau estimates that payments total $19 billion a year.
   The typical provider is a divorced father 25 to 44 years old. On average, providers have an annual family income of $37,800 and pay $3,000 a year in support; those supporting both kids and adults average $43,500 in income and $8,400 in support annually. The largest amount of support -- an average of $7,800 -- goes to spouses who are separated or temporarily living apart. Ex-spouses get the next-largest chunk, averaging $4,700 each. Children 21 and older receive an average of $3,800 a year; those under 21 get $1,600 on average. Parents receiving support get an average of $1,500.

<HEAD>Some State and Local Officials Attack Census Figures as Too Low</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ink was barely dry on the first official
1990 census results when the numbers came under attack from state
and local officials fearful of losing political clout and federal
dollars.
   ``I think this thing was destined to fail from day one,'' said
Mayor Jimmy Kemp of Meridian, Miss., a longtime critic of how the
headcount was run.
   He was far from the only mayor to complain that the census
overlooks many of the nation's poor living in big cities.
   The census numbers determine how many representatives each state
sends to Congress and how many federal aid dollars states and
localities receive.
   If the numbers are skewed, some states will get more than their
share of money and power while others will be shortchanged.
   Michael Darby, undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs,
said Thursday he was confident the count was ``full, fair and
accurate.'' He said an analysis due next summer is designed to
checkthe accuracy.
   ``Certainly there's no valid basis for making a judgment about
an undercount or overcount at this point,'' said Darby, who
oversees the Census Bureau.
   The bureau said Wednesday that it counted 248.7 million people
in the United States as of April 1, up nearly 10 percent from a
decade ago. Sun Belt states such as California, Arizona and Florida
were the big gainers. Population grew at a far slower pace in the
industrial northern states and the Farm Belt.
   New Orleans Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, president of the National
League of Cities, said the numbers seemed ``to confirm the fears of
many city officials that significant numbers of people in their
communities were uncounted.''
   He said the figures put ``a substantial burden'' on the Census
Bureau and the secretary of commerce to prove the count was
accurate or adjust it to account for uncounted people.
   ``We have not seen anything that would convince us that there
has been a complete count in Texas,'' said John Bender, a spokesman
for the state comptroller's office. ``We are certain there was an
undercount in 1980 that cost the state at the very least $30
million a year in federal funds during the 1980s, and it appears
that there's been an undercount again in 1990.''
   ``We will assume they missed people in the state,'' said Ken
Jones an analyst with the Vermont Office of Policy Research and
Coordination.
   ``If we feel that the number missed in Vermont is consistent
with the number missed throughout the country, then we are
comfortable with that,'' he said. ``If we feel that the rural areas
were undercounted more than the urban areas, then we will take
action.''
   But California officials praised the census figures, which
showed the state's population grew 26 percent in the 1980s.
   The count released this week was significantly higher than the
preliminary figures ``and more in line with our own estimates,''
said Linda Gage of the California Finance Department. ``We are
surprised and delighted.''
   Rep. Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio, chairman of the House census
subcommittee, noted the overall population count was 4.7 million
people below the Census Bureau's October estimate of 253.4 million.
   ``We're saying the apparent discrepancy is cause for concern,''
Sawyer said.
   But Rep. Thomas Ridge of Pennsylvania, senior Republican on the
census subcommittee, said failure to confirm the October projection
``is not legitimate grounds for criticizing the enumeration process
itself.''
   The Census Bureau said it counted 249.6 million Americans. That
figure includes nearly 1 million Americans living abroad, who
weren't counted in 1980 and who weren't included in the October
estimate.
   More than 6,000 local governments - including the nation's 51
largest cities - filed challenges to preliminary figures released
earlier by the Census Bureau. The resolution of those local
challenges will help determine the final totals.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher has until July 15 to decide
whether to add people that the local officials say were not
counted.

   Florida has supplanted Pennsylvania as the fourth most-populous state, ranking behind California, New York and Texas, the Census Bureau said.

   The Commerce Department bureau put the overall estimated U.S. population as of July 1 at 243.4 million people, up from nearly 241.1 million in mid-1986 and 226.5 million in the 1980 census.

   The latest estimates showed that Florida's population has grown by 2.3 million people, or 23%, since 1980 when it ranked seventh.

   Pennsylvania now ranks fifth, followed in order by Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey and North Carolina, the Census Bureau said.

   Meanwhile, Alaska, the least-populous state at the time of the 1980 census, is now second-smallest with an estimated population of 525,000.
Wyoming ranks last with a population of 490,000.

   Population losses continued in the past year in five farm states -- Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, Montana and Idaho.

   Energy-depressed states, including Louisiana, Oklahoma, West Virginia and Wyoming, also showed losses, and Texas grew far more slowly than earlier in the decade, the agency said.

   The new figures are only estimates.
The government will conduct a fullfledged census in 1990.

IMMIGRANTS CITED AS KEY TO POPULATION GROWTH OF 1980S;

CENSUS: DEMOGRAPHERS ALSO SAY EARLY FIGURES SHOW RURAL AREAS ARE LOSING

<P>
Waves of immigrants, seeking the American Dream, contributed heavily to the
nation's estimated population growth of 23 million people during the decade,
according to demographers and social scientists.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, growth in the nation's rural areas reversed itself once again as
millions of Americans migrated to urban centers, according to preliminary
Census Bureau figures that estimate the nation's total population at 245.8
million people.
</P>
<P>
These estimates, based on the census mail returns and follow-up interviews this
spring, are subject to change, bureau officials said. They refused to discuss
the significance of the figures and cautioned against relying on them.
</P>
<P>
However, observers are studying the early returns as a way to test their
independent estimates of national population growth and demographic trends.
And, they say, they're finding that the preliminary findings match their
expectations.
</P>
<P>
"We're getting counts that are consistent with what we've known," said Jeffrey
Passel, a senior researcher at the Urban Institute in Washington. "Maybe their
counts are a little bit lower than what we were expecting, but they're in line
with the kinds of projections we made. People are showing up in the places we
expected them to be."
</P>
<P>
The most obvious examples of matching trends, he says, can be found in a
comparison of the early findings of the nation's two most populous states:
Nearly all demographers predicted that California would be a winner and New
York a relative loser in the census count.
</P>
<P>
California showed about 29.3 million residents, a 23.7% increase over the 1980
count. New York, where a failing economy has nudged away jobs and workers,
showed a paltry 0.4% population gain to 17.6 million residents.
</P>
<P>
Other winners in the preliminary tally include Nevada (49.1% increase), Arizona
(+33.1%), Florida (+31.1%) and Texas (+11.8%) in the Sun Belt. Losers,
including Iowa (-5.1%), Illinois (-0.9%), Pennsylvania (-0.8%) and Michigan
(-0.9%), are clustered in the Rust Belt.
</P>
<P>
John Connolly, an assistant to Census Director Barbara Everitt Bryant, said
these early figures are "working numbers," adding: "We expect these numbers to
rise throughout the country. We don't know how much of a rise because we're not
finished counting yet."
</P>
<P>
But demographers say the figures are helpful. In particular, they point to the
numbers to prove their belief that legal and illegal immigration is boosting
the nation's population. In some states, for example, the infusion of
immigrants during the 1980s prevented a decline in total population, said
Passel, an immigration expert.
</P>
<P>
"New York grew by about 70,000 people, if the census figures are to be
believed," he says. "But New York got close to 1 million immigrants over the
decade. Clearly, without the immigrants, New York would be losing population at
a pretty rapid clip."
</P>
<P>
He noted that California, Texas and Florida are magnets for immigrants, as well
as for native-born residents seeking jobs and warm weather.
</P>
<P>
The driving force behind all these changes is economics, said William P.
O'Hare, director of policy studies with the Population Reference Bureau, a
Washington-based firm specializing in demographic trends.
</P>
<P>
"Almost all of the nation's immigrants are going to the Sun Belt states," he
said. "They're following the jobs. I don't see anything about that trend that's
going to change in the next couple of decades."
</P>
<P>
Ken Johnson, a demographer at Loyola University in Chicago, said his analysis
of the preliminary figures shows that rural areas are losing residents once
again, reversing a short-lived trend during the 1970s of rural community gains
and urban population losses.
</P>
<P>
Passel said the shift in population from one region to another creates severe
pressures as communities grapple with housing and employing the new residents.
"My sense is, however, that population growth is probably less of a problem for
the place getting the people than it is for the places losing them," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's worse if you lose your jobs and your tax base. Then the communities are
left with infrastructure problems. How do you support the infrastructure with
few (work-age) people?"
</P>
<P>
The political implications of that fact are not lost on local and state
officials, who also stand to lose or gain congressional representation based on
the census figures, because the 435 seats in the House of Representatives are
apportioned by state population. Also at stake are federal dollars from
programs funded on a population basis.
</P>
<P>
California is expected to gain seven additional congressional seats, bringing
the state to 52 representatives. New York, by contrast, is expected to lose
three seats.
</P>
<P>
Some officials, such as those in Los Angeles and New York, are complaining
about an undercount of their residents and are preparing to mount challenges to
change the numbers before final figures are reported to President Bush on Dec.
31.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley, while pleased with the way Los Angeles fared in the
preliminary report, said he couldn't wholly embrace the census tally,
"especially in light of the disastrous undercount reported across the country."
</P>
<P>
In New York, Mayor David N. Dinkins was more blunt, calling the preliminary
returns "unadulterated nonsense." He was joined by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who
said the state was undercounted and his Administration will "do anything we can
to challenge it."

      Americans on the Move
   Are on the Rebound
   EVERY few years, Americans stuff their worldly goods into cardboard boxes and change homes.
From the end of World War II until the 1970s, annually about 20% of the U.S. population changed residences.

   During the 1970s and early 1980s, however, the "geographic mobility rate" drifted as low as 16%, the Census Bureau says.
Bureau demographers believe that rising housing costs, especially high interest rates, made lots of people postpone moves, the bulk of which are local and tend to be more discretionary than long-distance ones.

   Newly released figures show American mobility snapping back to more traditional levels, with 20.2% of the population moving in 1985, compared with 17.3% a year earlier.
The Census Bureau, which has been charting household moves since 1948, finds the year-to-year increase of three percentage points "unprecedented," says Larry Long, of the bureau's Center for Demographic Studies.
The mobility rise followed a sharp drop in mortgage rates from unusually high levels.
Mr. Long speculates that many potential movers were simply waiting for housing to become more affordable.

   Long-distance moves in 1984-85 marked the first time in several decades that the South didn't score a big population gain.
Some 1.3 million people moved into Southern states, but nearly as many, 1.2 million, moved out, most to the Midwest and West.
Census demographers say they aren't sure whether this shift in Southern net migration is a one-year statistical aberration or the start of a significant trend.

   Shift to the Sun
   Belt For Congressional Seats
   POLITICIANS are starting to speculate how the population drift toward the Sun Belt during the 1980s will alter the balance of power in Congress.
If state population trends continue as they have so far this decade, California would gain six seats in the House of Representatives in the 1990s.
Two other Sun Belt states with prospective big gains in House seats are Texas, with four, and Florida, with three.
Arizona, Georgia and Virginia each would add one seat.

   The rejiggering of House membership comes in 1991, when states redraw congressional and legislative district lines based on the 1990 census.
Since House membership is a permanent 435, states that saw an exodus of people in the 1980s will lose seats to states where population grew.

   Election Data Services Inc., a political consulting firm in Washington, has figured the size of each state's delegation in Congress in the 1990s, using 1986 Census Bureau population totals.
The big losers are in the Frost Belt: New York would drop three House seats, and Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania two each.
Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, West Virginia and Wisconsin would lose one seat apiece.

   Ride-Sharing Incentives
   To Cut Los Angeles Smog
   MANY communities encourage voluntary car-pooling.
In the smog-choked Los Angeles area, that encouragement is soon to be the law.
By next Jan. 1, companies with more than 500 workers in a four-county area in and around Los Angeles must offer tangible rewards aimed at persuading employees who normally drive to work alone to join car pools or to ride buses or bicycles.
Possible lures: cash bonuses, free gasoline, bus passes, choice parking spots in the company lot, and showers for bikers.

   By 1990, the policy will cover companies with more than 100 workers in Los Angeles, Orange, and Riverside counties and the urban areas of San Bernardino County.
That's roughly 8,000 employers with 1.5 million workers, or 40% of the area's commuters.

   The ride-sharing rules, supported by most businesses as a cost-effective way to reduce both smog and rush-hour bottlenecks, are the strictest adopted so far in the U.S., according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
The agency sees the plan as a potential model for communities elsewhere troubled with pollution or traffic congestion.

   Enforcing the strategy is the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which was given expanded powers by the California legislature last year to deal with smog in the Los Angeles Basin, the nation's No. 1 air pollution problem.
Companies have broad discretion in crafting incentives, but the air quality district will rule on each firm's plan and audit the firm for compliance.

   Workers aren't required to accept the incentives, but companies are required to file a plan.
"Our experience is that when incentives are offered, people reconsider their commuting options," says Thomas Eichhorn, the district's spokesman.

   Helping Small Businesses
   Trade in Foreign Markets
   EXPORTING is standard fare for big manufacturers like Boeing or Caterpillar, but for a smaller outfit in, say, Columbus, Ohio, plunging into foreign trade with its letters of credit and exchange-rate exposure may be daunting.
Finding a commercial bank to arrange and finance a trade deal of less than $1 million can also be tough.

   The U.S. Export-Import Bank is trying to ease the pain with one-year pilot programs in three states -- Massachusetts, Maryland and California -- and three cities -- Columbus, Los Angeles, and Tucson, Ariz.
The Ex-Im Bank provides a specialist to lead would-be exporters through the paperwork maze involved in loans to foreign buyers and working-capital guarantees.
The states and cities support the project with money and professional services.

   Says Raymond Lorello, Columbus's development director: "Our argument is that the $100,000 deal today may grow into the $1 million deal tomorrow."

GROSS CENSUS UNDERCOUNT IN POOR AREAS ALLEGED
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles' poorest communities with the greatest needs were "grossly
undercounted" by census enumerators, Deputy City Atty. Jessica Heinz told a
meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Officials from 20 cities met to plan a strategy to convince legislators that
preliminary census figures undercounted residents in cities both large and
small, particularly in neighborhoods with low-income and minority residents.
</P>
<P>
The problems with the methods used to count populations were amplified in Los
Angeles and other large urban centers with significant ethnic populations,
Heinz said.
</P>
<P>
"Undocumented immigration into California is tremendous," Heinz said. "People
in L.A. don't live in the kind of way where you can use a mail-out, mail-back
process and have it work; a lot of our city doesn't speak English."
</P>
<P>
Fear of overcrowding and immigration laws also deters residents from filling
out the form, she said, adding, "People don't believe it is confidential."
</P>
<P>
The complaints will be voiced today before the House Post Office and Civil
Service subcommittee on census and population by mayors from Chicago,
Baltimore, Denver, Brownsville, Tex.; Winston-Salem, N.C., and Meridian, Miss.
The cities hope to win congressional support for adjusting the 1990 population
figures. However, the final decision on whether to revise the count rests with
Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher, who has until next July 15 to
decide.
</P>
<P>
Conference participants agreed that in attempting to persuade the
Administration to adjust the figures, cities should document any measures that
they took to aid their local census bureau in counting residents, particularly
when the information conflicts with preliminary census counts.
</P>
<P>
For example, in Los Angeles sanitation workers wrote down the address of each
house in 400 randomly selected city blocks. Their numbers showed 4.5% more
housing units than were reported in preliminary census numbers, Heinz said. In
another study, after counting the number of idle gas meters and examining rent
stabilization figures, city workers concluded that vacancy rates in certain
neighborhoods were only half that recorded in the preliminary census, Heinz
said.
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau's preliminary figures put Los Angeles' population at 3.42
million -- up 15% from 1980. However, the city claims that at least 49,513
dwellings were not counted, which could increase the city's population count by
123,783.
</P>
<P>
The mayors also will tell the subcommittee that census officials are failing to
give adequate feedback on whether they are incorporating the data provided by
cities in their post-census studies.
</P>
<P>
Post-census studies conducted by officials in 1980 showed a 4.65% undercount in
Los Angeles, but the corrected figures were not incorporated into the city's
population total. Since 1990 base figures are based on the previous decade's
census, the preliminary figures are too low even if mistakes in counting were
not a factor, Heinz contended.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, East Los Angeles was a test area for the census. After a post-census
enumeration study was conducted, significant undercounts of minority groups
were revealed: almost 10% of the Latino community was missed, 7% of the Asian
population was overlooked, and 9% of African-Americans were not counted, Heinz
said.
</P>
<P>
By knowing how officials used the post-census data, cities could decide whether
to demand an increase in the current 2% limit on the number of housing units
that cities can challenge, the conference concluded.
</P>
<P>
The mayors will also ask the census subcommittee to move up to April 1, from
the current July 15 date, Mosbacher's deadline for announcing whether the
census figures will be adjusted nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Many city's laws require them to redistrict before July 15, 1991, which means
that the newly drawn districts will not reflect the latest population figures,
the mayoral representatives said.

OXNARD'S 'WINDFALL'
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A windfall is defined as "an unexpected or undeserved stroke of good fortune."
The Times unfortunately chose the word "windfall" to describe the potential
increase in state and federal funding that the city of Oxnard may receive due
to the preliminary population count released by the U.S. Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
As noted correctly by The Times, the preliminary count shows Oxnard with a
population of 137,468 -- significantly higher than the State Department of
Finance estimate of 129,980. However, this preliminary figure is neither
unexpected nor undeserved. We have long maintained that Oxnard's population was
severely undercounted in the 1980 census and, as a result, tax dollars that
have been paid by Oxnard residents over the years have been flowing from our
large, ethnically diverse, lower-income residents to other cities that have
wealthier, easier-to-count communities.
</P>
<P>
The correction of such an inequity can in no way be considered a "windfall,"
any more than the return of stolen property to its rightful owner would be a
windfall for the victim of a theft.
</P>
<P>
The city of Oxnard funded an aggressive program to reach out to our homeless,
minority and non-English-speaking populations to encourage participation in the
census, a program that still continues.
</P>
<P>
It must be emphasized that the figures are preliminary, and that the census is
not over yet. We are presently reviewing the housing-unit figures provided by
the Census Bureau, and will be presenting to the bureau a response reflecting
some concerns we have with their preliminary figures. For example, the figures
from the Census Bureau assert that nearly 25% of the housing units in the
Oxnard Shores area are vacant, and that more than 11% of the units in the city
of Port Hueneme are vacant. We have questions about these figures, as well as
concerns that all of the hundreds of doubled-up families (whose addresses we
provided to the Census Bureau) be included in the final census count.
</P>
<P>
If you or anyone you know hasn't been counted, call us at 984-4609, or the
Census Bureau at 1-800-999-1990 (English) or 1-800-CUENTAN (Spanish) to make
sure you are included.

   It's Because Small Towns Produce
   Stand-Up-and-Be-Counted People

   CASWELL, Maine -- In a town too small for a stoplight,
word gets around quickly about strangers. That's why the
newcomers here have everybody talking.
   Last week, the U.S. Census Bureau unveiled its 1990
population count for Caswell. It's 2,743 -- a 368% leap from
the last count of 586 in 1980.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The trouble is, nobody in Caswell has seen the outsiders.
   "I've lived here all my life. I know pretty much everybody
in town. . . . It's gotta be a computer mistake," says
Frederick St. Pierre, chairman of the Board of Selectmen.
Adds his cousin, Town Clerk Doris St. Pierre, "We have a
little over 400 people who live here now," about a 32% drop
from the last census.
   Folks are leaving this one-horse town for lack of jobs --
other than potato farming or work at a nearby Air Force base.
In a town with no high school, police station or bowling
alley, what in the world, townsfolk query, would 2,000 new
residents do for a living? "I honestly don't know where we'd
put them all," says Ms. St. Pierre.
   But while Caswell residents are laughing it up, the Census
Bureau isn't budging. "Until we investigate it, we don't know
there is an error," says Edwin Wagner Jr., a Census Bureau
officer, who refuses to call the figure an overcount.
"Obviously, we have what appears to be a discrepancy."
   Discrepancies like these have led to lawsuits in places
much bigger, where the complaints have been about an
undercount, not an overcount. Two years ago, even before the
1990 census began, five major cities -- including New York,
Los Angeles and Chicago -- filed suit against the Department
of Commerce, which oversees the Census Bureau, seeking a
change in procedures that led to alleged undercounting in the
1980 census.
   Many of these cities, including New York, have also
claimed an undercount in the 1990 census. New York says its
population is 7.8 million, but the census count was 7.3
million last year.
   "What (Caswell) has pointed out is an extraordinarily
serious problem" of both undercounting and overcounting, says
Peter L. Zimroth, an attorney representing New York in the
lawsuit.
   The Census Bureau takes the low ground in all this. While
Mr. Wagner acknowledges that mistakes have been made in past
censuses, he says more often it's a case of folks
"misinterpreting" what jurisdiction census figures really
represent.

After complaining that preliminary 1990 census figures grossly underestimated
the growth of their populations over the past decade, officials in many big
cities -- including Los Angeles -- say that census counts may not be quite as
far off as the critics originally alleged.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, officials in Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and other
metropolitan areas continue to say that there were serious errors in the Census
Bureau's population count, which could cost local governments seats in Congress
and hundreds of millions of dollars in federal assistance.
</P>
<P>
In an official challenge forwarded to Washington late Monday, Los Angeles
officials said they had turned up 49,513 more dwellings than the 1.3 million
units counted by the Census Bureau. While that difference of 3.8% could
translate into thousands of people and millions of dollars in government aid,
the figure is well below the 10% housing underestimate Los Angeles officials
had originally predicted.
</P>
<P>
As it stands, the Census Bureau has put the city's 1990 population at 3.42
million -- 15% above the 1980 level. But the challenge over housing units, when
translated into residents, could bring that figure up by 123,783 -- a total
about equal to the population of Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
"The possibility of missing anyone who resides in the Los Angeles area can have
a devastating impact on the federal funds we may receive to provide needed city
services," Mayor Tom Bradley said from Frankfurt, West Germany, while on a
mission to promote tourism.
</P>
<P>
During the remainder of this week, cities and towns across the country will be
scurrying to complete formal responses to the initial census figures.
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, no governmental agency has so far challenged any of the
preliminary census counts.
</P>
<P>
After the 1980 census, Santa Ana officials complained that upwards of 50,000
residents -- most of them Latino newcomers living in the shadows of society --
were left uncounted. But the city launched a massive effort to encourage
residents to cooperate with the census, and officials say the 1990 count
practically exceeded their expectations.
</P>
<P>
William Bellamy, U.S. Bureau of the Census district director in Orange County,
said other large cities in Orange County also have appeared satisfied with the
Census Bureau's preliminary counts. The only city in Orange County that has
indicated it was taking a hard, second look at the preliminary figures is
Westminster, but no challenge has yet been mounted by that city, Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last week the Census Bureau had received formal responses from
4,341, or 11%, of all local governments, but not all have formally challenged
the census numbers.
</P>
<P>
"We've actually received a lot of letters here accepting our counts, telling us
we were right in the ball park," said Denise Smith, an official in the Census
Bureau's regional office that covers all of New England and Upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
In Houston, a week before the deadline, officials were finding the local review
of housing units much closer to the census count than they had expected.
Nonetheless, city officials were challenging the Census Bureau's contention
that Houston has 1.61 million residents and essentially has not grown since
1980.
</P>
<P>
In Philadelphia, officials were disturbed but not surprised by the census
conclusion that population has eroded over the past decade, with city dwellers
fleeing in ever-larger numbers to the suburbs. While officials there thought
the census count was off, they also acknowledged that their numbers were not as
different as they had thought. Based on earlier estimates, city officials said
the census had overlooked as many as 97,000 dwellings. In fact, the post-census
review of building permits and other records showed that the census undercount
was closer to 67,000 units, said Barbara J. Kaplan, executive director of the
city Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
In a few places, officials continued to say the numbers would be as bad -- and
in some cases, worse -- than anticipated. In Chicago, a week before the
deadline, the difference between the census count and the local review was
"large and growing larger," said Susan Weed, a community development
demographer.
</P>
<P>
New York's deadline is also later this week, but officials there continued to
be outspoken in their criticism of the preliminary census count of 600,000
fewer residents than the city had a decade ago -- a situation that officials
say is preposterous, given their large homeless population and the city's
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
At a hearing in Washington last week, Barbara Everitt Bryant, the director of
the Census Bureau, responded sharply to the New York officials in her first
public statement since the agency released the preliminary 1990 counts last
month.
</P>
<P>
If New York's population did not drop, she said at the hearing, "Why did the
school enrollment drop by 54,000? Why do the moving vans show more people going
out than coming in?"
</P>
<P>
The bureau has until mid-October to assess the challenges, at which time it
will begin preparing a final gross count of the population, due on the
President's desk by Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
While these operations and last-minute efforts are under way to correct the
preliminary census count of 245.8 million, census statisticians will be
evaluating what is known as the post-enumeration survey, a statistical survey
analyzing how well the regular census did in finding such hard-to-count
residents as immigrants and inner-city residents.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, New York and other cities and states, along with civic and civil
rights groups, filed a lawsuit after the 1980 census seeking to force a
statistical correction of the 1990 census based on this study. Although the
lawsuit is pending, the commerce department did agree to conduct the study to
make an adjustment possible, if the Secretary of Commerce decides it is
necessary.

AREA ANALYSTS SAY EARLY CENSUS COUNT MISSED 3,700 PEOPLE
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Entire housing tracts in Oak Park and the city of Ventura were missed during
early census counts, so Ventura County's population of 650,880 should be
increased by at least 3,700 residents before the count becomes final in
December, city and county analysts said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The analysts, who have pored over preliminary U.S. Census Bureau figures since
the numbers were released two weeks ago, also said they question the bureau's
finding that more than 6% of the county's dwellings are vacant. A recent state
estimate was only 3.8%.
</P>
<P>
In general, however, planners in most area cities and at the county praised the
bureau's early work, saying that the large undercounts of 1970 and 1980 seem to
have been avoided this year.
</P>
<P>
"In most of the places we've checked we're finding they are quite accurate,"
county senior planner Steve Wood said. But verification by local analysts is
limited to comparing the number of dwellings reported by the census with local
figures.
</P>
<P>
Using that method, area analysts found that the initial canvass failed to
include up to 900 houses in suburban Oak Park east of Thousand Oaks and some
300 dwellings in a mobile home park and in Rancho Ventura in eastern Ventura.
</P>
<P>
Port Hueneme also has reported to the Census Bureau an undercount of about 140
dwellings, mostly in a newly completed subdivision on Victoria Avenue.
</P>
<P>
If the size of each of the 1,340 uncounted dwellings discovered so far matches
the county average of 2.8 residents, about 3,700 people were not included in
the preliminary population count.
</P>
<P>
That prompts concern, because Ventura County and its 10 cities all receive some
tax money in proportion to their populations. Officials said each extra person
brings the county $200 a year in state and federal subsidies, while an extra
city resident brings it about $50 through vehicle fees and gas and cigarette
taxes.
</P>
<P>
The extra residents in unincorporated Oak Park will bring the county about
$500,000 a year. The uncounted residents in Ventura would mean a windfall of
$42,000 for the city each year.
</P>
<P>
Geary-Ellen Williams, manager of the census office in Ventura, confirmed
problems with the Oak Park preliminary count.
</P>
<P>
"People called in and said they didn't receive our questionnaire," she said.
Census workers have since canvassed that community, counting residents in each
unlisted home, she said.
</P>
<P>
"The whole point of giving the cities this preliminary information is so they
can help us get an accurate count," Williams said. When releasing the early
figures Aug. 27, the Census Bureau said it expected upward revisions.
</P>
<P>
City and county planners have another week to complete their check of the
figures and to file a challenge. But representatives of seven cities said
Monday that they have seen little to indicate that the preliminary count is far
off the mark.
</P>
<P>
In Thousand Oaks, where the census numbers were about 3,600 residents below
state estimates, senior planner John Prescott said his check shows that the
federal figures jibe with the city's.
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks has 37,500 dwellings, the city estimates, while the federal count
is 37,748.
</P>
<P>
"Right now it looks like the difference is going to be less than 1%," he said.
"You want zero percent, but in some of these areas we don't even have a
complete count ourselves for April 1."
</P>
<P>
The 1990 census is intended to reflect population for April 1, 1990.
</P>
<P>
Part of the difference between federal and local figures reflects new dwellings
completed between Jan. 1, when the census did its initial count, and April 1.
</P>
<P>
However, federal officials said they were not sure how hundreds of older homes
were missed.
</P>
<P>
For example, in Ventura, the two uncounted subdivisions are well established,
planner Mark Stephens said. "Those are the two most significant discrepancies
we see," he said, "but we'll spend the next few days going back and checking
our figures against theirs."
</P>
<P>
Ojai Planning Director Bill Prince said about the only thing he has found to
challenge is an undercount of 22 people. The city found 212 senior citizens in
retirement homes instead of 190 as reported by federal canvassers.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, representatives of several cities said they question dwelling
vacancy rates reported in the census. In Santa Paula, chief of planning Joan
Kus said she knows of virtually no vacant houses or apartments, while the
census says the city has 526 out of a total of 8,077.
</P>
<P>
"Their figure is kind of ridiculous based on common knowledge," Kus said.
</P>
<P>
Under census guidelines, vacancy rates are not subject to challenge, Kus said.
But she plans to ask Ventura County to file a protest on behalf of all area
cities since the rate in the census is nearly double the state's estimate.
</P>
<P>
Even before revisions upward, Ventura County's population of nearly 651,000 is
an increase of 122,000 over the past decade. That 23% rate of growth is
slightly under the 24% rate for California during the 1980s.

<TEXT>     The Census Bureau reported Chicago's population at 2.78 million, more than
140,000 short of the figure the city submitted last fall in an official

satisfied with the final count, which could mean a loss of millions of federal
dollars.;    Census Bureau defends data;  Barbara Everitt Bryant, director of
the Census Bureau, has defended the quality of the 1990 census, saying the
Census Bureau figures have in most cases proven to be more accurate than those
from the cities.;    Wednesday's population figures -- for counties, towns and
cities in 18 states and the District of Columbia -- are part of the continuing
release of data from the 1990 census, which was conducted last spring. Figures
for the remaining states are scheduled to be released today and Friday.;
Figures were released Wednesday for Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, the District
of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont,
Virginia, Washington and West Virginia.;    Flak from big cities;  While
thousands of local jurisdictions had challenged the preliminary findings, it
was the big cities that were most critical of the 1990 census. Even before the
census was conducted, New York, Chicago, Houston and other communities filed a
suit to force the federal government to compensate for residents missed in the
head count by using a statistical formula to arrive at new population
figures.;    As a result of that suit, the government agreed to consider such
an adjustment, and a decision will be announced by July 15.;    In the
meantime, complaints from cities grew even louder Wednesday, when officials
saw that their population counts fell short of the figures they believe are
more accurate.;    Boston's complaint;  "It's embarrassing for the government
to put forward this as a final piece of work," said Allan Stern, a city
official in Boston responsible for the census.;    While city officials
believe Boston's population is more than 600,000, the Census Bureau published
a final count of 574,283, a gain of 20,571 over the preliminary number.;
The statistics hold special significance in Massachusetts, which lost a
congressional seat in the 1990 reapportionment based on its population.;
"We're losing a seat by 12,000 human beings," Stern said. "They're off by more
than twice that in this city alone.";    Atlanta sued;  In Atlanta, where city
officials filed a separate lawsuit in December challenging the census numbers,
the city's final figure prompted similar dismay.;    The Census Bureau's
figure for Atlanta was 394,017, a gain of 9,864 over the preliminary number.;
  "The feeling is those figures are wrong," said Lyn May, a spokeswoman for
Mayor Maynard Jackson. She said the city would pursue its lawsuit.;    The
city believes its population is 437,000. "We stand by those numbers," May
said.;    This is the first time the Census Bureau has released detailed
population figures for the whole nation this early in the census reporting
process. Normally, population counts for localities are released one state at
a time over a period of many months.  </TEXT>

<HL> REGIONS:
Nonstop Population Outlaw
A Cause for Concern in Iowa
---
By Eugene Carlson
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL>
<DD> 10/06/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   IN THE BROADWAY SHOW "The Music Man," the clever con man Prof. Harold Hill urged Iowans to think positively about their state when he sang, "You oughta give Iowa a try."

   Judging by what's happened to the state's population, the professor's advice has been largely ignored.

   Iowa has a population problem.
New state figures from the Census Bureau covering the 1980s show Iowa losing residents consistently from 1981 to mid-1986.
No other state, neither manufacturing states of the Northeast -- Great Lakes industrial belt nor other Farm Belt states, can match Iowa's dubious record of nonstop population outflow through the first half of the decade.

   Since births outnumber deaths in Iowa, as they do in every other state, the decline in total population reflects out-migration-the decision of a lot of Iowans to pick up and move elsewhere.

   Iowa's own population watchers say the continuing exodus is a mix of older people looking for retirement homes in the sun, middle-aged wage earners fleeing a depressed farm economy, and most troubling, well-educated young adults who don't see a future in their home state.

   "It's a problem and we're deeply concerned," says Herbert Schulte, vice president of corporate planning for Meredith Corp., the large, Des Moines-based magazine publisher.
"We're willing to concede that a number of our state's retirees are seeking a warmer climate.
What concerns us more is the out-migration of young people, particularly those on whom we've spent considerable money training for someone else."

   IN THE SIX-PLUS YEARS between the last national census on April 1, 1980, and the date of the Census Bureau's latest estimates of state populations -- July 1, 1986 -- Iowa lost 2.2% of its population.
That works out to 63,000 persons, more than the population of Council Bluffs, one of Iowa's medium-sized cities.

   It's also a bigger percentage decline than in any of the other three states that lost population in this period.
The other population losers in 1980-1986 were Michigan, Ohio and West Virginia.
The District of Columbia also lost residents in this period.

   While the short-term population flight from industrial states such as Michigan grabbed all the headlines at the height of the recession, Iowa remains the only state to lose residents in each year of the decade so far.

   In Michigan in the early 1980s, you could chart the stream of unemployed auto workers heading for construction and oil-field jobs in Texas and Oklahoma.
The biggest outflow came in the 12 months ending in April 1982, when 157,000 more people moved out of the state than moved in.

   BUT MICHIGAN HAS DONE a demographic about-face.
It hasn't been a population loser since 1984.
And out-migration has slowed to a trickle; the net loss for the year ended April 1986 was just 3,300.

   The improving industrial and service economy in the upper Midwest "has diminished drastically the number of people leaving," says Laurence Rosen, Michigan's state demographer.
"We might even see some net in-migration.
It's been a good year," he adds.

   In Iowa, the trend is just the reverse.
Out-migration is on the rise.
Total net migration (the excess of persons leaving the state over those moving in) in the last three years is estimated at 15,000, 37,000 and 46,000.

   (These migration numbers are obtained by analyzing names and addresses on federal tax returns.
These data, which the Internal Revenue Service gives to the Census Bureau, are considered the best available source of interstate population shifts.)

   AGRICULTURE GETS most of the blame for Iowa's runaway population.
Farm employment has shrunk by one-quarter, or by 10,600 jobs, since 1980, according to the federal government's Bureau of Economic Analysis.
Employment in the machinery sector, dominated by the farm implement manufacturer Deere &amp; Co., is off by one-third, or 22,400 jobs, in the same six-year period.

   And the boom in services, real estate and transportation that has buoyed the economies of other states seems to have leapfrogged Iowa.
Non-manufacturing employment there is up only 3% since 1979, compared with 20% for the U.S.

   "When you dig down, you find that the state's economy really isn't very diversified," says David Allardice, vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and principal author of a recent study of the Iowa economy.

   Adds Kenneth Stone, professor of economics at Iowa State University: "The fact that agriculture has taken such a hit explains an awful lot why people have left."

   Boosters may point to Iowa's surprisingly low unemployment rate, 4.5% in July, well below the national average, as evidence that things aren't all bad.
Prof. Stone says fleeing Iowans have even played a part there.

   "An awful lot of young people have left, looking for jobs, and that's gotten rid of our surplus labor," he says.

SANTA CLARITA TO CHALLENGE CENSUS AS BEING TOO LOW;
</P>
<P>
POPULATION: WITH 40,000 FEWER PEOPLE THAN THE OFFICIAL COUNT, THE CITY COULD
LOSE STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS AND FEEL MORE PRO-GROWTH PRESSURE.
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Clarita officials, worried that a lower-than-expected federal estimate of
the city's population could mean more development pressure and less money for
the young municipality, say they will challenge a preliminary head count by the
U.S. Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau reported last week that Santa Clarita's population is about
107,000. But since its 1987 incorporation, the city has been using 147,000 -- a
figure produced by the state and based on voter registration -- as its official
population count.
</P>
<P>
The far lower federal figure could provide ammunition for local developers to
argue that land-use plans being assembled by both the city and Los Angeles
County don't allow for enough residential construction. Government planners
have used the higher figure to set tentative limits on how many residences can
be built in the city and the surrounding Santa Clarita Valley.
</P>
<P>
A tentative land-use plan being weighed by county officials envisions trying to
hold the valley's population to about 270,000 by the year 2010. The city's
plan, which also is not final, anticipates limiting growth to about 180,000
people by the same year.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Jo Anne Darcy said she is particularly concerned that the Census Bureau's
figure, unless it is revised upwards, may encourage developers to push for more
housing units in the Santa Clarita Valley.
</P>
<P>
City officials have argued that developers in outlying unincorporated county
areas are not paying their fair share for municipal services such as schools,
roads and police. Although residents of developments outside the city limits
pay no city taxes, they still use city services, Darcy said.
</P>
<P>
"We've always been the hole in the doughnut," she said. "We're the hole and the
county's the doughnut."
</P>
<P>
Marlee Lauffer, a spokeswoman for Newhall Land &amp; Farm Co., the major
developer in the Santa Clarita Valley, said her firm has not studied the
preliminary census figures closely. But if the lower federal figure is correct,
she said, it would mean "there's definitely more room" for growth in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Census figures also are important to cities because they are used as a basis
for divvying up millions of dollars in sales taxes, motor vehicle registration
fees and other state and federal funds.
</P>
<P>
Darcy said if Santa Clarita's population is pegged at 40,000 less than what
city officials now estimate, it would produce a shortfall of up to $500,000 in
the city's $42-million annual budget.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said the city plans to undertake its own population count and intends
to formally challenge the federal number.
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Jill Klajic said "it's obvious to us" that the Census
Bureau's early figure is incorrect, although she believes final census numbers
will put the city's population somewhere between 121,000 and 137,000.
</P>
<P>
The census "had so many internal problems and management problems out here,
there were just whole tracts that they can't guarantee were counted in the
first place," she said.
</P>
<P>
Larry Hugg, a Census Bureau spokesman, said census takers will conduct recounts
in cities that have questioned the preliminary federal count, but he could not
gauge the chances of Santa Clarita prevailing in its challenge. Final census
figures will be issued by March, he said.
</P>
<P>
Early census numbers also showed that most San Fernando Valley cities
experienced double-digit growth rates during the 1980s, especially newer cities
at the Valley's northern and western edges.
</P>
<P>
The most explosive growth occurred in the Antelope Valley area. Palmdale's
population zoomed to 65,357 this year from 12,297 in 1980 -- a phenomenal 432%
increase -- while the number of Lancaster residents jumped to 95,101 from
48,027 in 1980, an increase of 98%.
</P>
<P>
Agoura Hills grew by 77%, as its upscale population jumped to 20,190 this year
from 11,399 in 1980. San Fernando posted a 25% gain, while Westlake Village's
population jumped 21%. Burbank grew by 9%.
</P>
<P>
The only Valley city to lose population was tiny, affluent Hidden Hills, which
dropped by 3%, or 45 residents.

CENSUS STAFF TO INVESTIGATE UNDERCOUNT COMPLAINTS

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Census Bureau has agreed to investigate the claims of 17% of the
nation's cities, counties and towns -- including the city of Los Angeles --
that the 1990 preliminary census missed thousands of housing units across the
country.
</P>
<P>
In all, the bureau has accepted for review the challenges of 6,602 communities,
including 128 in Southern California, while rejecting 983 challenges
nationwide. Over the next week or so, census workers are expected to recanvass
homes in many of these communities and will add inhabitants of houses they
missed to the census roll.
</P>
<P>
The claims of inaccuracies surfaced last month when local governments across
the country took issue with the Census Bureau's preliminary population count.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, cities and counties were given the opportunity to analyze the
bureau's preliminary tally -- comparing the bureau's list of households with
local inventories.
</P>
<P>
Twenty of the nation's largest cities reported discrepancies of more than
570,000 housing units. Los Angeles city officials reported that the census
missed nearly 49,000 dwellings, or almost 6%.
</P>
<P>
Among the cities challenging the census in California are both slow- and
fast-growing communities. Oakland, according to the latest census figures, grew
6% to 360,000 people, but officials there believe the count missed 500 houses
and apartments. Cathedral City was the state's fastest-growing city, jumping by
600% over the last decade. Local officials contend the Census Bureau may have
missed 4,000 people, or 12% of the city's population.
</P>
<P>
Of the 39,198 local governments nationwide, only one in four communities
officially responded to the preliminary census figures and as many as a quarter
of those said they accepted the bureau's preliminary counts.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, census officials interpreted this as a sign that despite
vociferous complaints from a number of large cities, including New York and Los
Angeles, the vast majority of the nation's towns and cities were satisfied with
the census. Many legislators, however, have taken a different view.
</P>
<P>
"Barbara Bryant (director of the Census Bureau) argues that it's a sign the
census is going well because 80% of the jurisdictions did not complain," said
an aide to Rep. Thomas Sawyer, an Ohio Democrat who heads the congressional
subcommittee on population and census. "Far from indicating that 80% were
satisfied with the results, we believe that most jurisdictions lacked the time
or the resources to mount a challenge."
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau's preliminary population count was 245.8 million, short of
the 250 million mark the bureau had estimated before the 1990 census began.
</P>
<P>
In both the House of Representatives and Senate, legislation has been
introduced that would prohibit the Census Bureau from releasing official
population figures until officials decide whether to revise the traditional
head count by using a controversial statistical method. The technique,
generally supported by big-city Democrats and opposed by suburban and
small-town Republicans, would give relative weight to areas of the country that
are thought to be routinely undercounted, such as inner cities with large black
and other minority populations and rural communities.
</P>
<P>
A number of cities challenging the preliminary census results have decided to
join New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Dade County (Miami) in a lawsuit,
originally filed in 1988, designed to force the bureau to use the so-called
post-enumeration survey.

<HEAD>Study Projects Little Change from Census Adjustments</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A new study concludes that skewing the Census
Bureau's national headcount, as has been proposed in various forms
by lawmakers and special interest groups, would make little
difference in the allocation of House seats.
   Population shifts since 1980 are expected to result in the shift
of 18 or more seats, various experts agree.
   But even combining the various suggested adjustments would shift
a maximum of just four additional seats among California,
Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Minnesota, population analyst William P.
O'Hare reports.
   ``It appears that none of the adjustments to Census figures that
are being urged upon the bureau are likely to make a big difference
in the overall apportionment of Congress,'' O'Hare reported in the
latest issue of ``Population Today,'' the newsletter of the private
Population Reference Bureau.
   The census, taken every 10 years, is required by the
Constitution to redistribute the 435 House seats, keeping them
relatively even in population. Because the number of House members
is limited, whenever a state gains a seat, another state must lose
one.
   Last year the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census
Bureau, decreed that the 1990 results would not be adjusted.
Various interest groups, however, continue to push the idea.
Several lawsuits and congressional bills have been filed seeking to
force changes.
   The main dispute over adjusting the count centers on either
increasing the totals to add minorities presumed to have been
missed or reducing the total to subtract illegal aliens or people
who are ``imputed.''
   Imputed people are those counted despite the fact that Census
officials do not actually contact them. For example, when neighbors
say someone lives at a house even though the census taker
repeatedly cannot locate those people, that person is counted.
   The suit contending minorities are undercounted was filed in
U.S. District Court in Brooklyn by New York; Los Angeles; Chicago;
Dade County, Fla.; the NAACP and groups representing Hispanics and
the nation's mayors.
   A separate suit, seeking to remove the effect of illegal aliens,
was filed in U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh by the Immigration
Reform Law Institute on behalf of 42 members of Congress,
Pennsylvania, Kansas, Alabama and the Federation for American
Immigration Reform.
   An analysis of the 1980 census concluded that more than 5
percent of blacks and Hispanics were missed, considerably more than
the number of whites who were said to have been uncounted. Thus,
interest groups have urged increasing the minority count in each
state by a predetermined percentage.
   Such a move would be expected to benefit states with large
minority populations, but O'Hare's calculations said that would not
be the case.
   ``Interestingly,'' concluded O'Hare, ``minority undercount
adjustment, the modification of the census figures which has
received the most attention, would not result in the movement of
any seats between states.''
   On the other hand, he calculated that eliminating illegal aliens
from the count would result in the transfer of one House seat from
California to Pennsylvania.
   ``This is not surprising when you realize that the 1980 census
figures for California included an estimated 1 million illegal
aliens,'' O'Hare commented. Taking them out of the California
population would cost that state a House seat; Pennsylvania would
be next in line for that seat.
   Some states are more difficult to count and thus have more
imputed people than others, O'Hare found. He estimated that
subtracting imputed people from the count would cost Kentucky a
seat. Once again, the gainer would be Pennsylvania.
   O'Hare also calculated the results of various combinations of
these adjustments:
   _Adding in allegedly uncounted minorities and subtracting
estimated illegal aliens would move one seat from Minnesota to
Pennsylvania.
   _Adding in minorities and subtracting the imputed people would
transfer seats from Kentucky and Minnesota to Pennsylvania and
California.
   _Subtracting both illegal aliens and imputed people would move
one House seat from California to Pennsylvania.
   _Making all three adjustments would move one seat from
California to Pennsylvania.
   The various changes calculated by O'Hare would be in addition to
reallocartions of House seats caused by discernable shifts in
population since 1980.
   While the exact shifts won't be known until after the census,
the Population Reference Bureau and the private Election Data
Service have projected changes based on recent Census Bureau
population estimates.
   Both groups anticipate the shift of 18 seats from northern
states to the South and West, mirroring the flow of population.
   Gainers are expected to be: California, 5; Texas, 4; Florida, 3;
Arizona, 2; Georgia, 2; North Carolina, 1 and Virginia, 1.
   Expected to lose seats are: New York, 3; Pennsylvania, 3;
Illinois, 2; Michigan, 2; Ohio, 2; Iowa, 1; Kansas, 1;
Massachusetts, 1; Montana, 1; West Virginia, 1, and Wisconsin, 1.

   WASHINGTON -- The populations of many big industrial
states stagnated in the 1980s, while Americans swarmed to the
Sun Belt and the West Coast, according to preliminary U.S.
Census Bureau figures.
   The population of New York state barely grew over the past
decade, rising a mere 0.4%, to 17,626,586 from 17,558,000.
Over the past year, it actually declined. The populations of
Illinois and Pennsylvania also slipped slightly between 1980
and 1990.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the population of California surged nearly 24% in the
1980s, to 29,279,015 in 1990 from 23,668,000 in 1980. Texas
grew 18%, to 16,824,665 from 14,229,000 in 1980, although its
population slipped over the past year, according to the
figures.
   The figures on New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Illinois
were released yesterday, completing the Census Bureau's
preliminary population listings for all 50 states.
   California easily retained its spot as the most populous
state, while New York managed to hang onto the No. 2
position.
   A Census Bureau official cautioned that the counts are
incomplete and likely will be changed in the final report,
which is expected next spring.

   From the great cities to the small towns,
America's municipalities are telling the federal government they
can't possibly be as small as census takers say.
   By the thousands, local officials are demanding something be
done about the 1990 Census. Even states are contesting the
preliminary figures, aware that the more residents they are
credited with, the more federal aid they will get and the greater
their representation in Congress will be.
   Some voices from the nationwide chorus:
   -``Unadulterated nonsense ... statistical grand larceny,'' said
New York Mayor David N. Dinkins.
   -``There are errors everywhere,'' said Detroit research director
Juliette Okotie-Eboh.
   -``It really stretches credibility to the breaking point,'' said
Hartford, Conn., Mayor Carrie Saxon Perry.
   -``They missed our farthest south street,'' said Hays, Iowa,
City Clerk Judy Grothe.
   All were reacting to the preliminary results of the Census
Bureau's April 15 head count.
   The preliminary reports were sent out in late August and early
this month to give officials a chance to file challenges in time
for the bureau to double-check its numbers before announcing its
final count Dec. 31.
   Census Director Barbara Everitt Bryant has already told Congress
there will be big changes in the initial numbers.
   ``The census count will increase in practically every
jurisdiction throughout the country because of ongoing coverage
improvement programs,'' she said.
   Even some states that posted gains in the preliminary figures
are upset.
   Take Texas. Despite recording significantly more people, state
officials say the count is not high enough.
   ``Our conservative estimate puts the state's population at about
17 million. If the census' final count ... stays with 16.8 million,
Texas will definitely be shortchanged,'' state Comptroller Bob
Bullock said.
   But it is clearly from the jurisdictions that showed losses that
the loudest complaints are coming.
   Such as West Virginia, credited with the largest population drop
of any state.
   ``Many West Virginians live up dirt roads and hollows, and
proving their existence has been as difficult as it has been for
the Census Bureau to find them,'' said Bob Brunner, spokesman for
Gov. Gaston Caperton.
   Or Pennsylvania, where Vincent Carocci, spokesman for
Pennsylvania Gov. Robert P. Casey, said the preliminary count
underestimated the population by 200,000 to 300,000. Census takers
undercounted the state's cities, Carocci said, because people there
are ``just harder to count.''
   Or tiny Jacksonburg, Ohio, which the Census Bureau said has 14
residents. Last week, 39 Jacksonburg residents appeared at a
protest of the count. Between them, they said they could count at
least 26 more people in the town.
   Denver Mayor Federico Pena was ``stunned.'' New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo exclaimed, ``I don't believe it.'' Atlanta Mayor Maynard
Jackson said if errors aren't corrected, ``we'll see them in
court.''
   Barraged with such complaints, the Census Bureau is having
workers do rechecks of some neighborhoods, add late reports and
factor in military personnel overseas.
   The bureau has its hands full.
   In Iowa, officials say as many as 75,000 residents were missed.
   In Louisiana, said a representative of Avoyelles Parish, ``We
know for sure that's not right. Several types of errors were made
but I don't know what kind. ``Something went wrong, but I guarantee
that we will get to the bottom of this.''
   Why are the numbers so important?
   Simple. After the nation's population is counted every 10 years,
the House of Representatives is reapportioned and federal and state
aid formulas are adjusted. Losing people, or not growing as fast as
other places, can mean a loss of political power and federal aid
until the next census.
   The census news wasn't bad everywhere, though.
   Seattle and Washington state officials are pleased with the
preliminary counts, which exceeded their own estimates.
   ``We still think there are people out there that the census did
not count, but generally we think they did a pretty good job,''
said urban research analyst Eric Friedli.
   ``My impression is that we have a smaller proportion of people
who aren't going to respond or who aren't going to be counted. I
don't see any outstanding reason to say this is a bad census,''
said Lawrence Weisser, a state research investigator.
   Officials in Sacramento, Calif., are puzzled by preliminary
census figures 5 percent higher than they had estimated. ``I'm at a
loss,'' said Scott Mende, a city planner.

   The populations of five states grew at rates
faster than 10 percent in the last half of the 1980s, the Census
Bureau said Thursday in a report that is causing revised estimates
for congressional reapportionment.
   The Census figures on state population, issued for release
Friday, showed Nevadawith the biggest population gain at 18 percent
from 1985 to the middle of 1989. Arizona had the second highest
growth rate, at 12 percent, followed by Florida and New Hampshire
at 11 percent and California at 10 percent.
   Seven states lost population during the same period, the bureau
said: Iowa, North Dakota, Montana, West Virginia, Wyoming,
Louisiana and Oklahoma.
   The population figures are closely watched at the end of each
decade because they determine how many seats in the U.S. House of
Representatives each state will have. The next reapportionment will
be based on the final 1990 Census figures, which will be collected
in the 10-year census next year.
   The report issued Thursday represents one last checkpoint before
that final, official count, and two forecasting groups on Thursday
issued revised reapportionment predictions based on the trends.
   While the two reports varied on some specifics, they agreed on
the overall trend: states in the Sunbelt will generally pick up
seats lost by states in the Northeast and Midwest.
   The non-profit Population Reference Bureau said that if the
trends in Thursday's report hold true through the final 1990
figures, 11 states are likely to lose one or more seats in Congress
while seven will gain.
   It said New York will lose three seats, Pennsylvania two, Ohio
two, Michigan two, Illinois two, New Jersey one, Massachusetts one,
Iowa one, Kansas one, West Virginia one and Montana one.
   The Population Reference Bureau said California will gain seven
seats, Texas will gain three, Florida three, Virginia one, North
Carolina one, Georgia one and Arizona one.
   The comparable prediction by Election Data Services Inc., a
Washington-based political consulting firm, differed only for a few
states. It said Florida is likely to pick up four seats, rather
than three, and it added Kentucky to the list of those losing
seats, dropping one.
   There is still a wild card in the deck which cannot, at this
point, be predicted with certainty. The Census Bureau figures on
which the projections are based do not include members of the
military and their dependents living overseas.
   The government recently announced that they will be counted in
the 1990 reapportionment. This change could tip the balance in some
states that now appear close to winning or losing a seat.

CENSUS DASHES LATINO HOPES FOR SEAT ON ENLARGED COUNCIL

<P>
Latino leaders said they are disappointed over unexpectedly low population
totals reported for the city last week.
</P>
<P>
The Latino community had hoped that preliminary census data would show a
population of more than 100,000, which would result in the expansion of the
City Council and give Latinos a better chance of winning a council seat for the
first time, leaders said.
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the Compton City Charter, the five-member council must be
expanded to seven members when the city's population reaches 100,000.
</P>
<P>
However, preliminary census data released last week shows that the population
count fell far short of the necessary 100,000. The U.S. Census Bureau put
Compton's total population at 86,999, up 7% from the 1980 figure of 81,286.
</P>
<P>
"That can't be, because, if you look at the school district, it's growing,"
said veteran Latino activist Joseph Ochoa. "I'm pretty sure we've got to be
over 100,000."
</P>
<P>
Pedro Pallon, a local bakery owner and founding member of the Latino Chamber of
Commerce, said: "I was very disappointed. We were counting on 100,000 at least.
I think there's been an undercount, definitely."
</P>
<P>
There is a heavy concentration of Latinos in Compton's northeast corner, as
well as along its eastern edge, and Latinos believe that they might be able to
mount a winning council campaign from there.
</P>
<P>
Council members are elected at large, although they are required to be
residents of the district from which they are running. Ideally, Latino leaders
would like to force a charter change that requires council members to be
elected by the residents of a district. For such a change to take place,
however, the city voters would have to approve a charter change.
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau has not yet announced the racial breakdown in city
populations, but there is little doubt that the city's Latino population has
mushroomed during the last decade.
</P>
<P>
Last year, for the first time, Latino youngsters reached a majority in the
Compton schools. They represented 50.3% of the enrollment, compared to only
about 33% five years ago.
</P>
<P>
In the city, various estimates from census tracking research firms put the
overall Latino population at about 33% to 35%, up about 10% to 12% from 1980.
</P>
<P>
However, the Compton Unified School District takes in large tracts of
county-controlled areas that are not within city boundaries, and the county
areas are heavily Latino.
</P>
<P>
In response to its growing Latino population, Compton has hired some
Spanish-speaking workers in order to communicate with all its residents. The
Police Department, for example, had to hire Spanish-speaking dispatchers in
order to take emergency calls.
</P>
<P>
Latinos, however, have been agitating for more Latino hiring in the school
district and the city and demanding that both adopt affirmative action hiring
plans.
</P>
<P>
Ochoa and Pallon said they had no plans to challenge the census data and will
wait to see what action the city itself takes over the lower-than-expected
count.
</P>
<P>
In an ironic twist, the city may use its growing Latino population as evidence
when it challenges the federal count. There is no doubt that the Latino
population has grown over the last 10 years, Councilwoman Patricia A. Moore
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Maybe, Moore suggested, many Latinos are recent immigrants and were afraid to
respond to the census questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
City officials say they also were stunned by the low census figures and will
challenge them. The process is known as the post census local review and gives
cities an opportunity to present evidence that the Census Bureau figures are
wrong.
</P>
<P>
"The state Department of Finance has had us up over 93,000 for about three
years," city planner Barbara Kilroy said.
</P>
<P>
Much of the state and federal money, such as gasoline and sales tax revenues,
that cities receive is based on population. If Compton cannot prove that it has
the 93,000 people attributed to it by the state Department of Finance, then the
city could lose some funding, said Jerry Gadt, city planning manager. He is in
charge of preparing the city's challenge to the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Gadt said he is poring over tax records from the county assessor's office in
hopes of showing that the number of dwellings in Compton has risen. The
household figures, Gadt said, are one measure used to challenge Census Bureau
population figures.
</P>
<P>
City Manager Howard Caldwell said: "I understand they have been undercounting
all over the state. We have enough data here to show that they severely
undercounted our population (increase) over the 10-year period."
</P>
<P>
Caldwell said that the city sells water to all the households and that his
staff is compiling data to show that the number of households has risen
steadily over the last decade. He also said that billings from the city's
sanitation contractor will show that the number of households in the city has
risen.

   A new agreement calling on the Census Bureau to
double-check its 1990 results and adjust them if necessary could
mean more federal money for some cities and changes in congressional
representation.
   The federal government agreed on Monday to examine results of the
1990 census and adjust them if necessary to correct a historical
undercount of minorities and inner city dwellers.
   ``This is a civil-rights issue, not a money issue,'' said New
York City Corporation Counsel Peter L. Zimroth. ``The money is
secondary, what we want is the most accurate count. There are people
in this country who are not brought into account. They are losing
representation.''
   Mayor Edward I. Koch, who called the agreement a ``a great
victory'' for the city, added, ``The impact is money.''
   Relying on the one-person, one-vote doctrine, New York City _
joined by two states and several major cities with large minority
populations and civil-rights organizations _ filed suit last
November to get the census bureau to use a statistical method
devised to correct the undercount.
   The dispute focuses on drawing electoral districts for the House
of Representatives.
   Because the House is limited to 435 members, distributed
according to population, areas where people are missed in the census
lose seats to other states. In addition, many federal programs
distribute money according to population.
   Under a settlement announced in federal court, the Commerce
Department and the Census Bureau agreed to set up an eight-person
panel of statisticians and demographers to review the results of the
1990 census and recommend to the commerce secretary whether the
numbers need to be adjusted.
   The secretary will not be bound by the recommendations.
   Following the nationwide head count, the Census Bureau also will
conduct a massive followup survey, sampling 150,000 households
nationwide to determine whether the final tally should be adjusted.
   A somewhat smaller survey already was planned to evaluate the
count.
   Following criticism that it missed as much as 1 percent to 2
percent of the population in 1980, the Census Bureau already
analyzed the possibility of adjusting its figures for under-counting
of some population segments.
   However, last fall the Commerce Department, parent agency for the
Census, decided against making an adjustment.
   Commerce officials said they didn't believe any sample could be
as accurate as the national head count itself. They also said they
were concerned an adjustment would undermine public confidence in
the Census.
   That decision was widely criticized.
   Barbara Bailar, the Census official who researched methods of
adjustment, resigned. She is now head of the American Statistical
Association. Bailer could not be reached for comment on Monday's
agreement.
   In addition, some local officials accused the department of
playing politics in the decision, an accusation the department
denied.
   Because the undercount largely affects minorities and inner-city
residents _ most often represented by Democrats _ critics asserted
that Republicans stood to benefit from cancelling the adjustment
plans.
   ``The agreement provides for a careful and thorough
re-examination as to whether the census requires adjustment to
produce a more accurate population count,'' Secretary of Commerce
Robert Mosbacher said in a statement.
   In the suit joined by New York state, California, Los Angeles,
Chicago, Houston, Dade County, Fla., and several civil-rights
organizations, New York City charged that the methods of the Census
Bureau commonly undercount blacks, Hispanics, the homeless and
illegal aliens.
   Zimroth said the agreement potentially means ``many millions of
dollars'' for the city in federal funds lost because of the
undercounting. It also could affect legislative boundaries, which
are drawn according to population.
   According to the city, the 1980 census missed as many as 500,000
people, or 6 percent of the city's population. The mayor's office
said the city has lost out on more than $200 million since the 1980
census because of the undercounting.
   Stephen Hart, a Justice Department lawyer, said that as many as 7
percent of the nation's blacks were overlooked in previous censuses.
The Census Bureau was looking at methods to reduce the undercount,
caused by people not responding to questionnaires or not cooperating
with neighborhood canvassers.
   Monday's agreement removed a motion by the city for a preliminary
injunction that could have stopped the 1990 census.

   The Census Bureau's day-old population count
came under swift criticism Thursday from a key congressman and some
state and local officials who argued it had missed many urban
Americans and would cost large cities federal funds.
   The Bush administration official in charge of the census,
Michael Darby, defended it as ``full, fair and accurate.''
   Rep. Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio, chairman of the House census
subcommittee, said the ppulation count ``may be the first one to
be less accurate than its predecessor.'' He noted the total was 4.7
million people below an estimate made in October, and added,
``We're saying the apparent discrepancy is cause for concern.''
   The count released on Wednesday pegged population in the United
States - excluding nearly 1 million Americans living abroad - at
248.7 million, an increase of nearly 10 percent from a decade ago.
In general, it showed large population gains in California,
Arizona, Florida and other Sun Belt states, and far smaller
increases in the industrial northern states and the agricultural
heartland.
   The governor of New York and the mayor of Meridian, Miss.,
called separately for continued legal challenges to the count. The
census process has been criticized throughout the year by municipal
and state officials, who say it skips people in urban areas,
particularly the poor.
   The census numbers are important to those officials because they
determine how many representatives each state sends to Congress and
how much federal aid states, counties and cities will get. An area
that's undercounted, for example, will have less political clout
and will get less federal money.
   ``New York will continue to make every effort both in the courts
and elsewhere to have all New Yorkers counted, so that we can
maintain our vital and important voice in Washington and ensure our
fair share of federal dollars,'' said New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   ``We know where those 5 million folks are,'' Jimmy Kemp, mayor
of Meridian, Miss., said of the difference between the October
estimate and this week's count. ``You're going to find them in your
cities where you have the most economically disadvantaged folks.''
   Rep. Thomas Ridge, R-Pa. and senior Republican on the census and
population subcommittee, said it was wrong to call the difference
between the October ``guesstimate'' and this week's count a
discrepancy.
   ``The fact that you couldn't hit the projection, in my view, is
not legitimate grounds for criticizing the enumeration process
itself,'' Ridge said.
   The Census Bureau said this week that there were in fact 249.6
million Americans. But it isn't accurate to compare that figure to
the 1980 tally because it includes 1 million Americans living
abroad, who weren't counted ten years earlier.
   Darby, the under secretary of commerce in charge of the Census
Bureau, said he believed the 1990 census was ``full, fair and
accurate,'' but he added no one now can say how accurate.
   ``Right now we don't know just how good the census is'' and
won't know until statistical checks have been completed this
summer, Darby said. ``Certainly there's no valid basis for making a
judgment about an undercount or overcount at this point.''
   More than 6,000 local governments - including the nation's 51
largest cities - filed challenges against preliminary figures with
the Census Bureau. The resolution of those local challenges will
help determine the final census totals.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, under whose direction the
Census Bureau operates, has until July 15 to decide whether to add
people that the local officials say were not counted.
   Ralph Munro, secretary of state of Washington state, expressed
concern that eastern cities challenging the census results might
prevail.
   ``We're thinking of intervening on the other side to argue that
the numbers should stand,'' he said.
   New York City Mayor David N. Dinkins said he was ``mad as hell''
with the census figures.
   ``We will fight it to the hilt, because it means to us about a
billion dollars over 10 years and of course a loss of
representation, which is tremendously important,'' he said.

<TEXT>     These are the final numbers of the Census Bureau's national count.;    In
addition to releasing the numbers for New York and many other cities, the
bureau released head counts for 16 states -- Alabama, Connecticut, Hawaii,
Idaho, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New
York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Utah.;    New York City's
mayor, David Dinkins, first complimented the Census Bureau's work, then
reiterated the criticism he has leveled at the agency throughout the 1990
count.;    "After much prodding, we are pleased that the bureau no longer is
headed in the wrong direction, is no longer statistically shrinking a city
which actually is growing," said Dinkins. "But even today's bureau report
falls short -- far short -- of the number of people who live in New York

number was higher by about 290,000 than a preliminary figure released last
year and 250,925 higher than the final figure from the 1980 census.;    The

dropped 6 percent to 1,585,577, and Detroit plummeted 15 percent to
1,027,974.;    Chicago's population, released Wednesday, was 2,783,726, down
7.4 percent.;    Several other cities in the East also were big losers.;
The biggest drop was Newark, N.J., which fell more than 16 percent to 275,221
people. Pittsburgh, named America's most livable city in the mid-1980s, lost
nearly 13 percent of its population, to 369,879. Cleveland slipped nearly 12
percent to 505,616.;    Several small cities made big percentage gains --
Boise, Idaho, grew 23 percent, to 125,738. Salem, Ore., picked up 19 percent
to 107,786, and Huntsville, Ala., gained nearly 12 percent to 159,789.;    The
Census Bureau has received heavy criticism from municipal officials who say
many of the poor weren't counted. They've sued in an attempt to force the
bureau to correct its numbers. The bureau will decide by midsummer whether to
do so.  </TEXT>

   WASHINGTON -- The 1990 census will not be adjusted upward
to correct for an undercount, Commerce Secretary Robert
Mosbacher said.
   The long-awaited decision will affect congressional
reapportionment in four states and the distribution of an
estimated $59 billion in federal assistance.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In choosing not to adjust the 1990 count, Mr. Mosbacher
overruled Census Bureau Director Barbara Bryant and seven out
of nine members on the bureau's undercount steering
committee. They had urged that the figures be adjusted on the
basis of a post-census survey that estimated a nationwide
undercount of 2%, or roughly five million people. A separate,
outside panel considering the issue split, 4-4, over whether
to recommend an adjustment.
   Although he conceded there was an undercount, Mr.
Mosbacher said at a news conference that changing the census
count would "abandon a 200-year tradition" of counting people
in the U.S. and should be done only if "it would make the
census better." He said he found the evidence in favor of an
adjustment "inconclusive and unconvincing" and was concerned
that an adjusted census would be less accurate at the local
level.
   Ms. Bryant said that she had recommended an adjustment to
correct the Census Bureau's "historic problem" in counting
minorities, especially blacks, Hispanics and Native
Americans. Yesterday, Mr. Mosbacher said the 1990 census
undercounted blacks 4.8%, Hispanics 5.2%, and American
Indians 5%.
   The accuracy of the 1990 census has been in dispute since
before it was taken. Under a 1989 court-ordered consent
judgment in a lawsuit brought by New York City, Philadelphia,
and several other cities, the Commerce Department was
required to consider the merits of adjusting the census based
on the post-enumeration survey, in which census employees
were sent to a fraction of U.S. households to check the
accuracy of the count. Following a court-ordered timetable
that many Commerce Department and Census Bureau officials
contend didn't allow time for sufficient statistical
analysis, Commerce Secretary Mosbacher had to announce his
decision by July 15.
   Cities have long suffered from unusually high undercounts
because they shelter large numbers of blacks, Hispanics and
other disproportionately low-income minority groups that are
difficult to count accurately.
   In a statement, New York City Mayor David Dinkins
denounced Mr. Mosbacher's decision as "deplorable" and said
it was "driven more by politics than by sound public policy
considerations." Rep. Tom Sawyer (D., Ohio), who heads the
House census and population subcommittee, said the decision
"has the consequence of a gerrymander on a national scale."
   Mr. Mosbacher denied that political considerations were a
factor and said he hadn't discussed the matter with the White
House. But he confirmed that an aide to White House counsel
C. Boyden Gray had contacted members of the outside panel
about their recommendations, and described the aide's actions
as "out of line." The incident was reported in yesterday's
New York Times.
   An administration official said that the aide, Robert
Swanson, had been instructed to investigate the legal
ramifications of a possible decision to adjust the census
figures. A White House spokeswoman said that Mr. Swanson
wasn't authorized to contact members of the panel.
   There is broad agreement that adjusting the census based
on the post-enumeration survey would be more accurate at the
national level. But many demographers are concerned that an
adjustment would be less accurate at the local level and
would hurt the federal grant process and reapportionment.
   At yesterday's news conference, Mr. Mosbacher said
adjusted census figures would be more accurate for 29 states
and less accurate for 21 states. But he also contended that
the unadjusted census would be more accurate for 11 of the 23
metropolitan areas with 500,000 or more people, including New
York, Chicago and Washington, D.C.
   Adjusting the 1990 census would appear to favor Democrats
over Republicans, because the big cities suffering the
largest undercounts tend to be heavily Democratic. But
adjusting the 1990 census would likely result in one more
congressional seat for Arizona, which is predominantly
Republican, and one less for Wisconsin, which is
predominantly Democratic. Also, adjustment would give one
additional congressional seat to California and one less seat
to Pennsylvania.
   The relationship between population counts and federal
grant money isn't clear-cut either. Roughly $59 billion in
federal aid is allocated partly on the basis of population,
according to Michael Murray, professor of economics at Bates
College in Lewiston, Maine, who examined the issue for the
Census Bureau. But population isn't the only consideration.
Some Community Development Block Grants, for example, award
more money to cities that have smaller population growth, on
the theory that they suffer from an eroding tax base and,
therefore, are more needy.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Says Census Figures May Have to be Delayed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of a congressional panel
overseeing the 1990 census says release of official state
population figures may have to be delayed because too many people
are going uncounted.
   Rep. Thomas Sawyer, D-Ohio, chairman of the House Post Office
subcommittee on the census, said the Census Bureau is rechecking
disputed figures and has assured that several million people will
be added to the preliminary U.S. total population count of
245,837,681.
   ``I am increasingly concerned, however, that these programs are
not designed to find the significant numbers of people who may have
been overlooked during the primary counting phases,'' Sawyer said
Tuesday at a hearing by his subcommittee.
   The lawmaker plans to introduce a bill that would delay release
of official state population counts until the commerce secretary
has adjusted the figures based on the rechecks, or determined that
no adjustment is necessary.
   That decision must be made by July 15, 1991. State population
counts were to be released by next April 1 so that state
governments would have plenty of time to redistrict before the 1991
state election season.
   The final count also will lead to congressional redistricting,
although timing is not quite so critical for that since the next
congressional election is not until 1992.
   Testimony before Sawyer's committee emphasized the problems the
Census Bureau is having counting this complex society with its
ethnic diversity, extensive travel habits, diverse living
arrangements and huge geographic areas.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., said, for example, that in Monroe,
Mich., census workers apparently listed vacancies for houses whose
inhabitants were simply out of town.
   ``Michigan has a long winter, and many permanent residents are
away from home during the early spring,'' Dingell said.
   According to census reports, 389 Monroe houses and apartments
are vacant, although city officials say there are only 41 units
without residents, Dingell said.
   Rep. Frank McCloskey, D-Ind., said census workers missed 7,000
students in dormitories on the Bloomington campus of Indiana
University.
   He said Bloomington Mayor Tomi Allison also told him that about
900 housing units in the city are missing from preliminary census
figures.
   Rep. Arthur Ravenel Jr., R-S.C., who represents Charleston
County, said Hurricane Hugo caused many of his constituents to be
displaced and uncounted.
   ``Prior to the hurricane, the city of Charleston had an
estimated vacancy rate of 7 percent,'' said Ravenel. ``In April of
1990, after the storm, it was reported to be 11.6 percent
(according to the census),'' he said.
   Rep. Mike Espy, D-Miss., whose district is the third poorest in
the country, said the Census Bureau didn't seem to understand the
complications of counting a predominantly poor, minority, rural
district where many citizens lack the basic education needed to
fill out forms.
   Barbara Everitt Bryant, director of the Census Bureau, said the
post-census review was finding clusters of missed housing units and
group quarters, such as dormitories.
   She said 39,000 local governments have had a chance to review
preliminary counts and identify discrepancies that will be
rechecked.
   ``We have heard some people claim the census was a disaster,''
Bryant said. ``Making such statements is at best premature, and at
worst misleading and potentially mischievous.''

SMALL TOWN IN WYOMING GOES BUST IN ILLUSTRATION OF POPULATION SHIFT;

CENSUS: EARLY FIGURES INDICATE THAT THE HEART OF THE COUNTRY HAS LOST PEOPLE TO
BOTH COASTS. IMMIGRANTS WERE A KEY FACTOR.

<P>
On the main street of Rawlins, Wyo., a shoe store, a drug store, a jewelry
store and several clothing stores have closed in the last few years. Motel
rooms go vacant, tract houses stand empty, restaurants struggle to stay open
and the residents of the dusty little city see their children grow up and leave
to find jobs elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
"We have hit what we think is bottom," city attorney David Clark said.
</P>
<P>
In 10 years, Rawlins has ridden to the top of a fuel and mining boom and
skidded to the depths of a bust. The population, once 14,500, fell by more than
a third.
</P>
<P>
And so when the Census Bureau released preliminary 1990 figures recently, the
numbers confirmed what Clark and his neighbors see daily -- a city on the
losing side of a dramatic population shift. They know about the lives behind
the data spinning out of Census Bureau computers.
</P>
<P>
They reduce to statistics some of the dramatic developments of the last decade:
economic decline and misery in some parts of the country and burgeoning
development in others, a stunning wave of immigration, an aging population
moving to popular retirement spots and young families going beyond the suburbs
in search of affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
The data are the first trickle of what will become a mass of new information
about the country, garnered from the laborious decennial census conducted this
spring and summer. Although census officials cautioned that many of these
preliminary nationwide numbers will change in final tabulations late this year,
the early figures confirm that the heart of the country is hollowing out and
the nationwide population of about 250 million is becoming concentrated on the
coasts.
</P>
<P>
The population losses in Rawlins and other rural communities reflect the
economic hardships of farmers, coal and uranium miners, oil workers and
small-scale rural manufacturers, including farm equipment and lumber mills. And
the surge of metropolitan growth in the face of rural declines indicates an end
to the "rural renaissance" of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Wyoming, for example, lost more than 4% of its population, while West
Virginia's declined 8.6% and Iowa lost 5.1%.
</P>
<P>
"It clearly means there was a greater degree of out-migration than had been
expected," said Calvin Beale, a demographer at the Agriculture Department.
"Basically, it is economic."
</P>
<P>
The numbers also show the significance of immigrants, who accounted for perhaps
40% of the nation's growth over the decade.
</P>
<P>
In Brownsville, Tex., for example, where census figures show growth of nearly
13% -- officials say it is closer to 18% -- the public schools cannot keep up
with the flood of new immigrants.
</P>
<P>
"We take in over 2,000 kids new to the system from south of the border every
year," said Alejandro Perez, supervisor for admissions. "It's almost a new
school coming in per year. We're building all the time."
</P>
<P>
The numbers are felt in the everyday duties of Perez's colleagues: More and
more bilingual teachers are hired, officials deal with the poor educational
backgrounds of many of the immigrant children and the city faces the costly
proposition of supporting a quickly expanding school system.
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Passell, a demographer at the Urban Institute, said that foreigners
settling in the upper Midwest and Northeast also kept several states -- such as
New York, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Massachusetts -- from losing population
or kept losses at half of what they would have been otherwise.
</P>
<P>
The numbers reflect other trends:
</P>
<P>
Cape Cod and the Ozark Mountains of northwestern Arkansas gained more
population than was expected, demographers say, because more and more people
are retiring in those areas.
</P>
<P>
Washington state gained 16.8%, at least in part because of what one social
scientist called "suburban Angst," middle-class families disenchanted with the
suburbs in California moving to the open spaces of the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic growth was in California, where the population rose nearly
24% since 1980. The influx pushed cities such as San Diego and San Jose into
the ranks of the major metropolises. In some cases, the figures suggest the
rise of a new economy built under near-sweatshop conditions by immigrants
willing to work for low wages in clothing and electronics factories.
</P>
<P>
The statistics for some Southern California communities are stunning. Cathedral
City in Riverside County grew by more than 600%, to nearly 29,000 residents
from just over 4,000 a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
In Victorville, a once-sleepy community in the high desert about 90 miles from
downtown Los Angeles, the population shot to nearly 39,500 from 14,220 in 1980.
Here the census numbers paint an increasingly typical picture: A young couple
moves far out of the city to find an affordable house, then sets up life on a
landscape of new tracts with few trees and drives more than two hours to and
from jobs in the city.
</P>
<P>
City planner John Hnatek described an army of crews laying sewer pipes and
hanging traffic lights to keep up with the growth: "We have people who come up
once a month, and every time they come up they see something new they haven't
seen before," he said.
</P>
<P>
With this extraordinary growth comes political clout. California is expected to
gain seven seats in the House, for a delegation of 52 and an unprecedented
opportunity to dominate Congress.
</P>
<P>
Alan Heslop, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, said the
new seats may act as a "steam valve" for ethnic communities by allowing
minorities more chances to win elective office at national and state levels.
</P>
<P>
Heslop and others predicted that, as minorities find representation in state
legislatures and in Congress, they will focus more on the issues they consider
important -- education, access to jobs and immigration policy.
</P>
<P>
New regional tensions may emerge. The debate over the infrastructure, for
example, could increasingly become a competition between the Sun Belt, which
will need funds for new highways, and the so-called Rust Belt, which has long
needed to repair old highways.
</P>
<P>
Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. cautioned, however, that such projections
are often overdrawn.
</P>
<P>
"As population goes, so do problems go," he said. He predicted that the
blossoming cities of the South and West will soon care about the issues that
predominate in New York and Detroit -- crime, education, solid waste disposal
and welfare, for example.
</P>
<P>
Also, the conservatism of high-growth areas may be mitigated with a dose of
reality, he said. "As these problems rise in the South and Southwest, the need
for affirmative government to deal with the problems will also rise,"
Schlesinger said.

<HEAD>New Census Figures Could Affect Reapportionment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Census Bureau figures released today indicate
that seven states are likely to gain seats in the U.S. House of
Representatives in reapportionment, while as many as a dozen states
will lose at least one seat, forecasters say.
   The next reapportionment will be based on the final 1990 Census
figures, which will be collected in the 10-year census next year.
The state population figures released today go up to mid-1989 and
represent one last checkpoint before the final, official count.
   The non-profit Population Reference Bureau said that if the
trends in this latest report hold true through the final 1990
figures, California will gain seven seats, Texas and Florida each
will gain three, and Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona
will gain one apiece.
   At the same time, 11 states are likely to lose one or more
seats, the Population Reference Bureau said. It said New York will
lose three seats, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois each
will lose two, and New Jersey, Massachusetts, Iowa, Kansas, West
Virginia and Montana each will lose one.
   Comparable predictions by Election Data Services Inc., a
Washington-based political consulting firm, differed little. The
firm, however, added Kentucky to the list of losers, dropping one
congressional seat, and predicted that Florida will gain four
seats, rather than three.
   However, the Census Bureau figures on which the predictions are
based do not include members of the military and their dependents
living overseas. They will be counted in the 1990 reapportionment,
the government recently announced, and that change could mean the
difference in whether some states gain or lose a seat.
   The Census figures show that the populations of five states grew
at rates faster than 10 percent from 1985 to mid-1989.
   The state that experienced the largest percentage increase in
population between 1985 and mid-1989, Nevada, grew by 18 percent.
Second was Arizona, 12 percent, followed by Florida and New
Hampshire at 11 percent and California at 10 percent.
   At the same time, seven states lost population, the bureau said:
Iowa, North Dakota, Montana, West Virginia, Wyoming, Louisiana and
Oklahoma.

   At least four states may have lost population
since 1980, according to preliminary Census figures.
   Louisiana, Michigan, North Dakota and West Virginia registered
population declines, data released Friday showed.
   The Census Bureau said 14 other states reported increases.
   Reports for the 18 states were sent to state and local officials
as part of the Census Bureau's local review program.
   Census officials emphasized that the figures are preliminary and
were provided to allow local governments to question the results in
the event people were missed or overcounted.
   Final official state population figures are scheduled to be
issued Dec. 31.
   Here is a list of the figures made public Friday, compared with
the results of the 1980 census. Reports for other states are
expected to become public over the next few weeks.
   Connecticut: 3,226,929, up from 3,108,000.
   Delaware: 658,031, up from 594,000.
   Idaho: 1,003,558, up from 944,000.
   Kentucky: 3,665,220, up from 3,661,000.
   Louisiana: 4,180,831, down from 4,206,000.
   Maine: 1,218,053, up from 1,125,000.
   Michigan: 9,179,661, down from 9,262,000.
   Mississippi: 2,534,814, up from 2,521,000.
   Montana: 794,329, up from 787,000.
   Nebraska: 1,572,503, up from 1,570,000.
   New Hampshire: 1,103,163, up from 921,000.
   North Dakota: 634,223, down from 653,000.
   Oregon: 2,828,214, up from 2,633,000.
   Rhode Island: 988,609, up from 947,000.
   South Dakota, 693,294, up from 691,000.
   Tennessee: 4,822,134, up from 4,591,000.
   Vermont: 560,029, up from 511,000.

Dividend From Tax Returns:
Details on Migration Patterns
---
By Eugene Carlson
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)
GOVMT
INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS)
   THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE isn't the only federal agency peeking at your income-tax records.
Sometime this fall, the IRS will hand over to the Census Bureau a massive computer file containing personal and basic income information for everyone who filed a tax return for 1986.

   This sensitive transfer of tax records has been taking place annually since the early 1970s, when the aim was to determine how to divide billions of dollars of federal revenue-sharing money among communities.

   But revenue sharing is dead.
These days, the tax records are mostly used to trace movement of the American public from place to place.
The migration figures, purged of names and income, can be purchased from the IRS.
A bank in a high-growth area, for example, could use the figures to see precisely where its potential new customers are arriving from.

   THE MIGRATION PROJECT is statistically awesome.
Using your Social Security number, the Census Bureau will compare the address that you printed on your 1986 tax return with the address on your previous year's tax form.
The idea is to see if you changed residence between tax filings and, if so, from where to where.

   A similar address scan is done on every other individual tax return.
Matching the estimated 103 million returns filed for 1986 with the roughly 99 million from 1985, adding the number of exemptions claimed, and charting where everybody moved down to the county level is no small data-processing chore.
The project will tie up the bureau's huge Univac 1100/84 computer for some 700 hours, a computer run roughly equivalent to the first tally of the entire 1990 national census.

   When the address information is combined with the number of exemptions claimed by the tax filer, the IRS data yield the single best picture of population migration available during the 10 years between national head counts.

   This sort of intelligence is solid gold to market researchers, developers and planners who are forever seeking better ways of predicting and charting state or regional population growth.
Migration data is vital in the local growth equation because what sets the growth rate of one area apart from another is almost entirely the movement of people.
Birth and death rates, the other main population components, are relatively constant throughout the nation.

   DEMOGRAPHERS USE voter registrations, auto registrations, school enrollments, and other social indicators to figure out whether a state is gaining or losing population through migration.
What the IRS figures show in addition to this are the origins and destinations of these migrants.

   The IRS numbers, for example, illuminate the strong population flow between Colorado and California and show how that stream has reversed in the last decade.
At the end of the 1970s, some 5,000 more people were moving to Colorado from California each year than were leaving Colorado for California.

   Over the next few years, Colorado's attraction for Californians gradually diminished, and by 1983 the migrant flow between the two states was about equal.
The most recent IRS figures show that the flow has tilted steeply toward California with net in-migration of 5,400 Coloradans in the year ended April 15, 1985.

   Arizona pulled a net 4,400 residents from Colorado in the latest reporting year.
The states with the biggest net population losses to Colorado: Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska and Wyoming.

   New Jersey massaged the IRS data and found that it is pulling in people from heavily populated Northern states such as Pennsylvania, New York, Illinois and Indiana, while losing residents, on balance, to increasingly urbanized states in the South and West, such as Florida, California, Texas, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia.

   ARMED WITH this knowledge, a New Jersey demographer assumes that most of those leaving for Florida are retirees, while most of the Illinois newcomers are in the active labor market.
The makeup of these two migrant streams has very different implications for the state's future population.

   The IRS data isn't a perfect migration mirror.
Because it only catches tax filers, migrants below the income-filing threshold don't show up on the Census Bureau printouts.
The 1986 tax law, which eliminates still more people from the tax rolls, will make the movement of low-income Americans, many of them elderly, even harder to trace.

   The Census Bureau's migration methodology also assumes that all the exemptions listed on a tax form change residence when the tax filer does.
That isn't always so, as in the case of divorced couples where one parent has custody of the children, and the other has financial support.
A single person who marries, moves and the next year files a joint return, is also lost in this tabulation.

   Addresses can be a problem for the Census Bureau, especially at the local level.
Taxpayers sometimes list post-office-box numbers on their return from a different jurisdiction than their home.

   Affluent taxpayers sometimes file from the offices of their lawyers or accountants.
The world knows that President Reagan has been in residence in Washington, D.C., since 1981.
But on their Form 1040 filed two weeks ago, President and Mrs. Reagan gave their address as 333 South Grand in Los Angeles.
That's the office address of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, the Reagans' attorneys.

   When it comes to migration, the Census Bureau's computer thinks the First Family lives in California.

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. population shift from rural to
urban areas accelerated sharply during the 1980s, according
to newly released figures from the 1990 census.
   The change reflects a significant slowdown in rural growth
during the 1980s, and also a small increase in the rate of
urban growth during that decade. The nation's rural
population grew a mere 4% during the 1980s, following a brisk
11% rise in the 1970s. The urban population, which includes
people in cities and surrounding suburbs, grew 12% in the
1980s after increasing 11.6% in the 1970s.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Census Bureau demographer Larry Long said changing
relocation practices of U.S. companies may help explain the
slowdown in rural population growth during the 1980s. Many
companies moved plants from urban to rural areas during the
1970s in an attempt to reduce labor costs, but after the
recession of the early 1980s, such companies were more likely
to relocate plants overseas, he explained.
   Urban dwellers totaled 187 million in 1990, or 75% of the
total population, up from the 1980 tally of 167 million, or
74% of the population, according to the Census Bureau. To a
great extent, this growth reflects a rising number of
immigrants, especially Hispanics and Asians. Immigrants are
much more likely than other groups to live in urban areas.
   In two states, North Carolina and North Dakota,
populations that previously were predominantly rural became
majority urban during the 1980s.

<TEXT>
   Folklore holds that this village along
the Ohio River got its name from railroad conductors who suggested
that passengers get off on the shady side of the tracks.
   A pamphlet found in a library says James Leasure planted
evergreens along the road to his farm and hung a sign reading
``Shady Side'' at his gate opposite the railroad platform in the
1870s.
   ``Eventually it became known as the Shadyside stop,'' said
Belmont County coroner's investigator Chuck Vogt. ``It's just a
nice, middle-class America town.''
   But it's also a town that has seen hard times, even before last
week's flash flooding killed at least 21 people and left 13 missing.
   The southeastern Ohio county lies in the coal and steel country
of the Appalachian foothills. Its heavily wooded hills are dotted
with bedroom and retirement communities for the mills and mines of
Wheeling, W.Va., and western Pennsylvania.
   ``Because of the closing of many, many coal mines and the
reduction and closing of some steel mills, the population has been
declining,'' said Martins Ferry Library Director John W.P. Storck.
``The average age in Belmont County is increasing, too.''
   Figures from the 1980 census show Belmont County's population
grew from 80,917 in 1970 to 82,569 in 1980, but the figures are
still below the 1940 peak of 95,614.
   Figures from the 1990 census are not yet available, but are
expected to reflect a further decline, Storck said.
   Shadyside, classified as a city until the 1980 census, had to be
reincorporated as a village because its population count of 4,300
was 700 below the Ohio cutoff for a city.
   Figures in a 1989 report compiled by Washington-based Woods &amp;
Poole Economics Inc. show the average age of the county's residents
is about 32.7 years, compared with the statewide average of 29.9.
The report predicts the average will increase to 37.4 in 1995 and
41.1 by 2010.
   But there has been little change in the character of Shadyside
residents, said Sandy Wallace, who grew up in Bellaire and reports
on the area for the Martins Ferry Times-Leader.
   Everybody knows everybody else, ``and that's why this flood has
become such a devastating emotional issue,'' she said.
   ``There's this quality of giving and openness, a very close-knit
and neighborly situation,'' she said. ``And that's something that
I've noticed has really come to the fore in the past few days.''
   Donations of food, clothing, technical assistance and labor for
the backbreaking process of debris removal came from all over
southeastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia.
   So much clothing was donated that authorities ran out of storage
space.

<LEADPARA>  The racial complexion of the American population changed more dramatically in
the past decade than at any time in the 20th century, with nearly one in every
four Americans having African, Asian, Hispanic or American Indian ancestry. In
1980, one in five Americans had minority backgrounds.;    In the field of

at which the country's racial mix was altered in the 1980s was breathtaking,
Census Bureau figures show.  </LEADPARA>

HISPANICS LEAD SURGE, CENSUS FIGURES SHOW  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The rate of increase in the minority population was nearly twice as fast as
in the 1970s. Much of the surge was among those of Hispanic ancestry, an
increase of 7.7 million people, or 53 percent, over 1980.;    "About half the
Hispanic increase is due to immigration," said Jorge del Pinal, the bureau's
chief of ethnic and Hispanic statistics.;    The increase was also a result of
high birth rates among Hispanic people, the legalization of many new Hispanic
citizens and the counting of illegal residents.;    With the wave of
immigration from Latin America, and separate influxes from the Philippines,
China, India and Southeast Asia, the total number of minority residents rose
to between 61 million and 62 million.;    Whites now make up 80.3 percent of
the nation's resident population. This group includes the vast majority of
Hispanic residents, who can be of any race.;    Whites of European or Middle
Eastern backgrounds make up slightly less than 76 percent of the resident
population of 248.7 million people.;    "This is the dawning of the first
universal nation," said Ben J. Wattenberg, an author and demographer.;    In
recent years, he said, more than 4 in 5 legal immigrants to the United States
have had non-European backgrounds. That proportion will decline under the most
recent immigration law, Wattenberg said, but of the 700,000 immigrants allowed
in annually, about 3 of every 4 are likely to be from countries outside Europe
or Canada.;    The predominant racial group still traces its roots to Europe.
"If you believe that the descendant of an English lord and a descendant of a
Polish shtetl are part of the same group, then that group is going to continue
in the majority for a long time to come," said Wattenberg.;    The dimensions
of the change became clear this weekend as the Census Bureau made public the
racial breakdowns for Alaska, the last of the 50 states to receive a
statistical portrait derived from the 1990 census.  </TEXT>

CENSUS: AN UNDERCOUNT IS BEING CHARGED. CONGRESSIONAL SEATS AND BILLIONS OF

Relying on independent data, their own estimates and gut instincts about urban
populations, city officials in California and across the country are heaping
discredit on the 1990 Census, charging that preliminary results of the census
are too low -- by anywhere from 2% to 12%.
</P>
<P>
Billions of dollars in aid to cities, as well as seats in the U.S. Congress,
rest on the outcome of the census -- an increasingly difficult task to count
one by one a mobile and uncooperative population of 250 million people.
</P>
<P>
The final census will be reported to President Bush by the first of the year.
</P>
<P>
City officials said the figure for Los Angeles -- 3,420,000 -- could be as much
as 10% off, and New York City officials say the bureau's count of 7,033,000
could be 1 million in error. Other cities ranging from San Francisco to Chicago
to Detroit to Houston echoed similar complaints.
</P>
<P>
The big losers could be major industrial cities of the Northeast and Midwest.
Although cities in rapidly growing states such as California stand to gain much
because of flight to the Sun Belt over the last decade, few cities even in
those areas are satisfied with the government's figures.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Los Angeles, New York and other cities contend that the
preliminary figures suffer from the same flaw that beset the 1980 Census -- a
5% or greater undercount of non-English-speaking immigrants, illegal aliens and
homeless people.
</P>
<P>
City officials believe that as these populations have swelled over the last
decade, the undercount has become more pronounced.
</P>
<P>
In response to these complaints, the Census Bureau stresses the preliminary
nature of figures released earlier this week, and emphasized that canvassing is
still going on. Bureau officials also said that local authorities will have a
chance to challenge the figures over the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
City officials don't put much stock in the challenge because under the law they
are not allowed to contest the number of people, just the number of households.
</P>
<P>
If the census has failed to accurately count the number of people living in the
houses, there is no way to correct that mistake, the cities argue. And in many
large cities with poor and immigrant families doubling up, it is easy to make
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
In addition, local officials across the country said the bureau's tally of
housing units does not match their own records drawn from such sources as
public utilities and building permits and the cities' own estimates.
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking census official said Friday that communities should not be
alarmed if the population figures seem low.
</P>
<P>
"People are reacting to the population count," said Edwin B. Wagner Jr.,
assistant division chief for operations at the Census Bureau in Washington. "We
provided that for information only," and those figures are expected to climb as
a result of the ongoing canvassing, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The real focus needs to be to review these counts of housing units" by cities
that feel they are being undercounted, he said.
</P>
<P>
That is not always easy, some local authorities countered, especially in cities
such as Los Angeles that have a high number of illegal immigrants and others
who would prefer that the government not know they are here.
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the census has missed "about 18,000 units," said Jessica Heinz,
deputy city attorney. Heinz also believes the census listed a lot of housing
units as vacant that are actually occupied -- including garages and facilities
that house large numbers of illegals -- but the census does not allow
provisions for local authorities to challenge the number of units listed as
vacant.
</P>
<P>
The count "is off (low) by as much as 10%," said Heinz. That "undercounting"
could cost the city millions in both federal and state funds.
</P>
<P>
"We figure a person is worth about 65 bucks a year in state money" alone, Heinz
said.
</P>
<P>
Adding to the confusion is the state Department of Finance's figures. For
example, the department's estimate of Los Angeles' population is close to the
census count. But department officials question the accuracy of their figures
for some of the same reasons that the census figures have been questioned.
</P>
<P>
According to Linda Gage, demographer for the Department of Finance, the state's
estimate does not count homeless people and does not accurately measure the
number of people in a given household.
</P>
<P>
"Neither one is accurate," Gage said, referring to the state count and the
preliminary census. "Ours is an estimate and subject to all the errors you can
make when you're making an estimate. And the census bureau number is
preliminary and will certainly change."
</P>
<P>
One city, Detroit, is in a uniquely difficult position.
</P>
<P>
Juliet Okotie-Eboh, chief of data analysis for Detroit's Planning Department,
said the census is about 140,000 too low, and that could translate into a
devastating loss for the city. Detroit, by far Michigan's largest city,
benefits from state legislation that was tailored specifically for cities of a
million or more inhabitants. The preliminary census puts Detroit's population
at 970,000.
</P>
<P>
That drop, from 1.2 million in 1980, will cost the city dearly if it cannot be
boosted by 30,000, and Okotie-Eboh said she believes the city will succeed.
</P>
<P>
"We're confident we're going to get it," she said.
</P>
<P>
Census officials expect the numbers to change, partly as a result of
"post-census local review," the process that allows local officials to
challenge the number of housing units in the preliminary count. But that task
is made more difficult by the fact that the bureau does not provide local
officials with addresses to protect the confidentiality of the census. So
instead, local governments are given the number of housing units for specific
blocks within the area.
</P>
<P>
It is then up to local authorities to compare that number with their own
records.
</P>
<P>
But some feel that is not a satisfactory approach and will still end up falling
far short of the actual number of residents. That is of particular concern to
New York City, which has lost a million residents during the last decade,
according to the latest census.
</P>
<P>
Following the 1980 census, the "post-census local review," as the housing
verification is called, made very little difference, according to David Golden,
assistant counsel for New York City.
</P>
<P>
"It added something like 76,000 people nationwide to the overall count," Golden
said. "And it reallocated only 56,000 people geographically."
</P>
<P>
"That was the extent of its impact," he said of the review process.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities across the country are hoping for far more, and they are
compiling as much evidence as they can get in hopes of proving the bureau
wrong.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Chow, assistant director for planning and development for Houston, said
he could not understand how the federal count should have been as far off as
his records indicate.
</P>
<P>
"I have found they have misreported some 10,000 units in one southwest area
alone," Chow said. He said he believes the bureau may have missed 200,000
units, including "588 units on one block which they identified as three units,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
"They just missed it."

   Here's how many people are old enough to vote in this year's
election, and how they are spread across the United States, along
with figures on the total population.

   Generally, in the most recent elections when the presidency was
at stake, only about half of those who were old enough to vote
actually went to the polls.
   For example, according to the Census Bureau, turnout in the 1984
presidential election was only 53.1 percent of the voting-age
population, up from 52.6 percent in 1980.
   The bureau said turnout was 62.8 percent in 1960, 61.9 percent
in 1964, 60.9 percent in 1968, 55.1 percent in 1972, and 53.6
percent in 1976.

   The last census in 1980 placed the nation's total population at
226,546,000, and the next such official count will be in 1990.
   Meantime, the Census Bureau's most recent detailed estimates are
that total population reached 243,400,000 in mid-1987 and that
182,628,000 residents will be at least 18 years old when America
votes this November.
   Since the 1984 presidential election, the voting-age population
is estimated to have grown by more than 8 million.

   The bureau points out that voting-age projections are based on
the resident population of the United States including members of
the armed forces where they reside at their duty stations.
   It said these projections exclude people overseas _ about
520,000 in the military and 65,000 federal civilian workers plus
their dependents of voting age, and an unknown number of other
American citizens residing abroad _ who would be eligible to vote
by absentee ballot in their home state.
   Meanwhile, the bureau said that the population of voting age
includes many who meet the age requirement but cannot vote.
   Because citizenship is a universal requirement for voting,
aliens are the main group of ineligible voting-age people, the
bureau said.
   About 6.5 million legal aliens and 2.5 million undocumented
aliens age 18 or over are included in the estimates and represent
roughly 5 percent of the total population of voting age, the bureau
said.
   The bureau also said somewhat more than 680,000 people will be
ineligible to vote because they will be in prisons or mental
hospitals.

   Based on Census Bureau reports, here is a state-by-state list
covering:
   _Total population figures from the census on April 1, 1980.
   _An estimate of what the total population had reached on July 1,
1987, the latest available such list.
   _An estimate of this November's voting-age population (residents

OFFICIAL REBUTS CHALLENGES TO CENSUS FIGURES

Census Bureau officials warned Los Angeles and other cities Wednesday that many
population count challenges are likely to be dismissed because local officials
tried to pass off vacant buildings, empty lots and other uninhabited places as
occupied housing units.
</P>
<P>
Delivering her sharpest rebuttal to date of charges that census enumerators
undercounted many communities, Census Director Barbara Everitt Bryant told the
census and population subcommittee of the House Post Office and Civil Service
Committee that early housing unit counts "were largely accurate."
</P>
<P>
Bryant acknowledged that the bureau had committed some coding errors, resulting
in overlooked dwellings, but she said that the agency corrected those mistakes
when found by punching updated information into a computer database.
</P>
<P>
Bryant said that the bureau's computers were able to correct mistakes made by
census counters in New Jersey, who reportedly fabricated information about some
hard-to-count households without actually visiting them. An investigation into
the allegations resulted in census officials recounting 18,303 households in
northern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
Bryant said that the bureau is unwilling, however, to recount some blocks
flagged by city officials because they contained "large amounts of error or are
out-of-date compared to census counts."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the bureau's efforts to correct its counting errors, Rep. Thomas
C. Sawyer, the Ohio Democrat who heads the subcommittee, said: "I'm grateful
they made the effort, but concerned they had to."
</P>
<P>
Bryant, however, charged that local officials had made far worse mistakes in
their efforts to discredit the bureau's preliminary figures.
</P>
<P>
"There was one lively example in Queens (New York), where the city said there
were 414 housing units on what turns out to be a piece of the Gateway National
Recreation Area, and all we can find are three lifeguard benches," she said.
</P>
<P>
Bryant declined to identify other cities that made such mistakes or to quantify
the number of claims expected to be rejected for bogus documentation. The
bureau is expected to respond to the cities' challenges later this month.
</P>
<P>
The challenges involve preliminary census findings released in September as
part of the bureau's efforts to review the accuracy of the decennial census.
Many urban mayors, state governors and congressional leaders have complained
that their localities were undercounted.
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, city officials reported that the census missed nearly 49,000
dwellings, or almost 6% of the city's total housing stock.
</P>
<P>
Across the country, about 25% of 39,198 local governments officially responded
to the bureau's findings, including eight large cities that questioned the
counts of more than 2,000 residential blocks in their jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
Lance Simmens, assistant executive director of the U.S. Conference of Mayors,
said that because city leaders did not know which challenges would be rejected
by the bureau, they could not respond to Bryant's charge that inaccurate data
was used to support their challenges.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Simmens used the census director's comments as an opportunity "to
reiterate our call for a statistical correction of the 1990 census." The
conference has served as an umbrella group in a series of legal battles with
census officials.
</P>
<P>
Bryant said that the bureau is on schedule to meet a legal requirement to
deliver a final count of the nation's population to President Bush before Dec.
31.
</P>
<P>
"I will not speculate on what those numbers will be," she told the panel. "That
is an announcement for the President to make."

   The countries five largest cities retained
their rankings in the Census Bureau's latest estimates of city
populations but San Diego replaced Detroit as the nation's sixth
largest city.
   The Census Bureau said that San Jose, Calif., and Jacksonville,
Fla., also moved up in the rankings of the country's 25 largest
cities in a new report prepared for release today.
   New York City ranked No. 1 in population in 1988 followed by Los
Angeles, Chicago, Houston and Philadelphia, the same positions
these cities held in 1986, the last time the bureau estimated city
populations.
   But San Diego replaced Detroit as the nation's sixth largest
city while San Jose passed San Francisco and Indianapolis to move
into 12th place. In the other change in the top 25, Jacksonville
replaced Washington, D.C., as the 16th largest city.
   Since 1970, there have been major shifts in the ranking of the
most populous cities, with many in the East and Midwest being
replaced by cities in the South and West. Seven of the 10 largest
cities in 1970 were in the North and East but by 1988 there were
only four in these regions. Baltimore, Washington and Cleveland had
been replaced by San Diego, San Antonio and Phoenix.
   Among the 25 largest cities, 12 are estimated to have lost
population from 1986 to 1988, including Houston, Dallas and Denver.
Dallas' population loss dropped the city under 1 million, a level
Dallas had reached for the first time in 1986.
   The bureau's new estimates were prepared using procedures that
rely on measuring components of population change since 1986 such
as statistics on births and deaths and monitoring of federal income
tax returns to make estimates of net migration into an area.
   The bureau's population estimates cover inside the city limits
and do not include suburbs. Populations and rankings for
metropolitan areas, including suburbs, can differ substantially
from those for cities.
   Following are the 1988 Census population estimates for the
country's 25 largest cities, with each figure followed by the 1986
estimate. The figures are in thousands:
   New York: 7,353; 7,263

<HL> Power, Money at Stake in Reagan Decision to Bar Census From Adjusting Its Counting of Minorities </HL>

<TEXT>
   Politics has traditionally been off limits at the Census Bureau, but that agency's jealously guarded reputation as a nonpartisan purveyor of the nation's statistics has lately begun to fray.

   Two years before the 1990 census, questions are being raised over a Reagan administration decision that all but guarantees that minority groups won't be represented as accurately as whites in 1990 official population figures.

   The controversy centers on a politically sensitive proposition: Should state and local population totals for blacks, Hispanics and others be adjusted upward in 1990 census totals to reflect the fact -- which everyone agrees is true -- that millions of these persons won't be found by normal census methods?

   The administration says no.
Top Census Bureau officials are defending that decision, saying that rejiggering the census totals will open a statistical can of worms.
But a number of outside experts, including a panel of the National Academy of Sciences, argue just as strongly for adjusting the 1990 state and local census figures.

   Power and money are at stake.
Census figures are the basis for apportioning seats in the House of Representatives and in state legislatures.
According to one scenario, California could gain a House seat in the 1990s at the expense of Massachusetts if blacks, Hispanics and Asians are counted with the same accuracy as whites.
Cities like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles would increase their clout in state legislatures if their minority residents are enumerated with precision.

   Big-city mayors are especially pro-adjustment, because population and income data are the basis for handing out some $30 billion in federal grants.
"We're dollars-and-cents losers if we have an undercount of the minority population," says Houston Mayor Kathy Whitmire.

   The dispute has rocked the normally staid world of the Census Bureau.
A senior bureau official even quit her job in protest, an unusual action in a low-profile agency where whistleblowers are a rarity.
Barbara Bailar, associate director for research and a 29-year Census Bureau veteran, says the decision not to adjust 1990 census figures to compensate for the minority undercount was "dressed up in technical language, but was a purely political decision."

   Failure to adjust the population totals, "when it visibly discriminates against minorities, the poor, the homeless, the inner cities and the young will surely raise suspicions about the integrity of the census," Ms. Bailar says.

   Since many minority-group members tend to vote Democratic, some congressional Democrats echo the charge that raw partisanship is behind the administration's decision.
But the politics of the issue aren't as simple as that.
Lawmakers from rural areas also aren't anxious to see a change that would benefit the cities more in the competition for federal dollars.

   Perhaps as a result, a bill that would overturn the administration decision and order the 1990 census adjusted hasn't attracted widespread enthusiasm in Congress to date.

   Reagan administration officials don't dispute that many people will go uncounted in the census.
But Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner says the political barbs are "untrue and unfair."
He argues that manufacturing new population figures after the basic census is run amounts to "number shopping" that would undermine the credibility of the census.

   The administration says such a change would confuse the public and lead to charges of political tampering, an accusation that could hurt the Census Bureau's image of remaining aloof from partisan squabbles.
Officials sketch a scenario where two sets of population figures -- unadjusted and adjusted -- could emerge for every locality, each set with its own advocates.

   They also note that the "corrected" population numbers would be the product of a pioneering statistical technique that has majority, but not unanimous support, from demographers; alternate adjustment formulas could produce different numbers.

   The heart of the matter is who gets counted, and who doesn't, in the decennial census.
Ideally, everyone present in the U.S. on April 1, 1990, citizens and aliens alike, will be tallied.
Most persons get census questionnaires by mail.
Those who don't return them are supposed to get a personal visit from a census enumerator.

   In practice, however, a lot of people fall through the census cracks.
Low-income minorities, especially, may not be on post office lists that the census uses to contact people.
Homeless people are tough to track.
And multifamilies crowded into a single home or apartment may be understandably reluctant to list all the occupants, even under the census pledge of confidentiality.

   Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) says that adjusting the census is the only way to get the roughly 100,000 people estimated to be living illegally in New York City public housing onto the population rolls.
"This is New York City, not a nice subdivision with tract houses," Mr. Schumer says.

   Using follow-up surveys, the bureau figures its official 1980 national total of 226.5 million reflected only 98.6% of the actual population.
Some 3.2 million persons, or 1.4% of the population, were missed.
The bureau estimates that more than half of the missing persons, 1.7 million, were black males.

   Overall, census officials figure that nearly 6% of both black and Hispanic populations went uncounted in 1980 while less than 1% of the white population was overlooked.
While the bureau has improved its total coverage over the years, this "differential undercount" -- the share of uncounted minorities vs. the share of uncounted whites -- has stubbornly refused to close.

   Even Census Bureau officials who support the administration's position concede that a sophisticated and hugely complex adjustment formula, developed since the 1980 census, would improve census accuracy.
But using the formula would require time-consuming surveys and computer runs, and the bureau is required by law to deliver state population totals to the president by Dec. 31, 1990, just nine months after the census begins.
So while adjustment is "technically feasible," says William Butz, a census associate director, "on operational grounds, I don't think we can do it."

   One thing remains certain: The dispute will drag on for a long time.
Fifty-two lawsuits were filed against the Census Bureau after the 1980 census, and officials are reconciled to more litigation on the adjustment issue after 1990.
"There'll be many suits, no matter what we do," says Mr. Butz.

<LEADPARA>  More Americans lived in urban areas in the 1980s than at any other time in
U.S. history, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday.;   In part, the urban growth

<TEXT>     All-time high;   According to a Census Bureau report released Tuesday,
187.1 million Americans, or 75.2 percent of the nation's population, lived in
big cities or their suburbs at the end of the decade, marking an all-time
high.;   In 1980, 167.1 million, or 73.7 percent, lived in urban areas.;   By
contrast, the number of people living in places with populations below 2,500
rose by a slightly slower rate -- from 59.5 million to 61.7 million.;
California had the highest percentage of urban residents -- 92.6 percent; it
also has the most urban land, 8,175.4 square miles. In 1980, 91.3 percent of
all Californians lived in cities and suburbs.;   Vermont had the highest
percentage of residents living in small towns, 67.8 percent; while Alaska had
the most rural land, 569,733.3 square miles.;   Increase in rural residents;
The Census Bureau also found that 11 states increased their percentage of
rural residents during the 1980s, compared with 19 states from 1970 to 1980.;
 North Carolina and North Dakota were the only states where the majority of
the population shifted from rural to urban during the 1980s.;   The proportion
of urban dwellers has risen steadily since census demographers first noted in
1920 that a majority of Americans lived in cites.;   The trend toward urban
growth generally parallels employment opportunities, which historically have
moved from rural areas to urban ones, said Larry Long, a housing and household
demographer at the Census Bureau.;   Long also noted that the pace of
immigration increased during the decade, helping fuel the cities' growth.;
"There was less growth (nationally) due to immigration during the 1970s, but
in the '80s there was tremendous growth," he said. "Virtually all immigrants
go to cities and stay there."  </TEXT>

California's Latino population, which represents one-third of the Latinos
nationally, has increased by nearly 2 million since 1980, according to a Census
Bureau estimate released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said that the nation's total Latino population has grown by 39%
since 1980, rising to a record 20.1 million. Latinos now make up 8.2% of the
U.S. population and have a population growth rate that is five times that of
non-Latinos, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Census Bureau spokesman Carmen Denavas said that half of the 6.7 million
California residents of Latino origin are immigrants. Immigration accounted for
about 50% of the national increase in the Latino population.
</P>
<P>
"This is our first estimate of over 20 million," said bureau spokesman Jorge
Del Pinal. "It's up from about 14.5 million in 1980."
</P>
<P>
While the Census Bureau estimate did not include specific Orange County
figures, the National Planning Data Corp., a Los Angeles-based research firm,
has estimated that the local Latino population has increased by 53% since 1980.
Orange County Latinos totaled 286,339 or about 14.8% of the population in 1980
compared to an estimated 440,117 -- about 19.2% -- in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Latinos account for 22.8% of North County residents, while they represent only
8.7% of the South County population.
</P>
<P>
The figures in the report are estimates and include illegal immigrants. There
are no precise figures for the numbers of illegal immigrants in the state or
the country, and estimates of the number vary widely.
</P>
<P>
California retains its rank as the state with by far the largest Latino
population, followed by Texas, which is home to 21% of the nation's Latinos.
Next are New York with 10% and Florida with 8%. The report also identified
Illinois, New Jersey, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado as having significant
Latino populations.
</P>
<P>
Estimates are not prepared for every state because "Hispanics are not well
spread out throughout the United States," Del Pinal said.
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles on Wednesday, Mayor Tom Bradley joined with Latino leaders and
celebrities to kick off a city campaign designed to encourage Latino youths to
stand and be counted in the 1990 Census.
</P>
<P>
"Tell your friends, tell your family that Hispanics must be counted to earn
political power," came a message shouted not from the mouth of a politician,
but by Latin American rock star Jose Luis Rodriguez, who attended the event at
Roosevelt High School.
</P>
<P>
And, based on the high-pitched screams of approval from hundreds of teen-agers,
the words were well received.
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles, bolstered with $600,000 in funding, has joined forces
with a host of community and civic groups to find ways to reach traditionally
under-counted groups, including Latinos, the homeless and those who live in
overcrowded apartments.
</P>
<P>
Officials said they have targeted high school-age Latino youths because the
students can pass along census information to their parents and push them to
fill out forms for the April 1 head count.
</P>
<P>
As part of the campaign, schools in areas with large immigrant populations will
be sent census lessons for classroom instruction throughout the campaign, which
lasts until April 1.
</P>
<P>
The official 1980 count missed as many as 10% of U.S. Latinos, according to
federal officials.
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau report said that the largest segment of the Latino population
is of Mexican descent, about 12.6 million. Residents of Central and South
American origin total 2.5 million, while those of Puerto Rican descent total
2.3 million and those of Cuban descent account for 1.1 million. The remainder
are of Spanish or other Latino origin.
</P>
<P>
While people of Mexican descent are the largest Latino group in the United
States, they are not the fastest-growing segment, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Comparing estimates from 1982 and 1989, the bureau said that the number of
Central and South Americans had increased by 67%. The "other Hispanic" category
rose 31%, followed by Mexicans, up 30%, Puerto Ricans, 14%, and Cubans, 12%.
