ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HAZARDOUS SPILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Hazardous Materials Team, or HAZMAT, is administered by the 
county Health Care Agency division of environmental health. It responds to 
calls on chemical spills and other incidents involving hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it goes to the site, other times it advises citizens or local fire 
departments over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
Of 17 local fire departments in Orange County (16 city departments plus the 
county), three have hazardous materials units that cover the entire county 
through mutual aid agreements -- Anaheim, Huntington Beach and the county 
station in Irvine. HAZMAT is called in most, but not all, hazardous spills.

The Orange County Hazardous Materials Team, administered by the county Health 
Care Agency division of environmental health, responds to calls on chemical 
spills and other incidents involving hazardous materials. Sometimes it goes to 
the site, other times it advises citizens or local fire departments over the 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
Of 17 local fire departments in Orange County (16 city departments plus the 
county), three have hazardous materials units that cover the county through 
mutual aid agreements -- Anaheim, Huntington Beach and the county station in 
Irvine. HAZMAT is called in most, but not all, incidents. Following is HAZMAT's 
spill response log for September.

The Orange County Hazardous Materials Team, administered by the county Health 
Care Agency division of environmental health, responds to calls on chemical 
spills and other incidents involving hazardous materials. Sometimes it goes to 
the site, other times it advises citizens or local fire departments over the 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
Of 17 local fire departments in Orange County (16 city departments plus the 
county), three have hazardous materials units that cover the county through 
mutual aid agreements -- Anaheim, Huntington Beach and the county station in 
Irvine. HAZMAT is called in most, but not all, incidents. Following is HAZMAT's 
spill response log for December.

The Orange County Hazardous Materials Team, administered by the county Health 
Care Agency division of environmental health, responds to calls on chemical 
spills and other incidents involving hazardous materials. Sometimes it goes to 
the site, other times it advises citizens or local fire departments over the 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 17 fire departments in Orange County (16 city departments plus the 
county), three have hazardous materials units that cover the county through 
mutual aid agreements -- Anaheim, Huntington Beach and the county station in 
Irvine. HAZMAT is called in most, but not all, incidents. Following is HAZMAT's 
spill response log for March.

<HEAD>Panel Concerned About Half Million Hazardous Materials Trips Daily</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government rather than the chemical industry
should track the half a million daily shipments of hazardous
materials over the nation's roadways, the chief sponsor of a bill
supported by the nation's firefighters said Wednesday.
   Another congressman said, however, that the relatively low number
of fatalities, injuries and property losses may not justify
proposals that could cost the chemical and trucking industries
hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
   The House Public Works and Transportation subcommittee on surface
transportation is considering changes in the law to increase
training requirements for drivers, make regulations more uniform
from state to state and keep track of all hazardous cargo with a
nationwide computer system.
   Rep. Douglas Applegate, D-Ohio, said the bill he is sponsoring
would shift control of hazardous materials shipments, sometimes
abbreviated on road signs as ``hazmat,'' from the chemical industry
to federal, state and local governments.
   ``We believe this shift is vital to protect the health and safety
of our constituents and our communities,'' Applegate said.
   A 1980 agreement between the Transportation Department and
chemical manufacturers set up an industry-run system called Chemical
Transportation Emergency Center, or Chemtrec. It gives local police,
firefighters and others a number to call for information on
hazardous cargo so they will know how to handle various chemicals in
an accident.
   But Applegate said the ``answering service'' is useful only when
the materials involved are known, and this may be difficult at the
site of a crash where chemicals have spilled out and the vehicle is
smashed or ablaze.
   He said placards required on trucks carrying hazardous materials
often are missing or incorrect and the Transportation Department's
emergency response guidebook is not always up to date.
   The Chemtrec system, said Applegate, is ``totally inadequate to
protect the American public.''
   But Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Penn., ranking minority member of the
subcommittee, said hazardous cargo hauls were involved in only 17 of
the 48,200 traffic fatalities in 1988 and 158 of the nearly 700,000
injuries.
   Shuster questioned whether the hundreds of millions of dollars
that might be collected from shippers or others under proposed
legislation were needed.
   Clifford J. Harvison, president of the National Tank Truck
Carriers, said the tank truck industry supports legislation that
would make laws more uniform regarding hazardous materials.
   ``Trucks cross thousands of jurisdictional boundaries daily, and
carriers cannot tailor the equipment and operational characteristics
of each truck and driver to meet the singular requirements of a
given community,'' Harvison said.
   Frederick H. Nesbitt of the International Association of Fire
Fighters said a system is needed to give emergency personnel quick
information about any hazardous cargo involved in an accident.
   ``The unnecessary dangers our firefighters face every day due to
an antiquated reporting system are inexcusable in this age of high
technology,'' Nesbitt said.

NEW SITES TO HANDLE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

<TEXT>
<P>
Disposing of oil-soaked rags, used insecticide cans and other hazardous 
household waste will soon be more convenient for county residents as new 
collection sites open. 
</P>
<P>
Only one site, in Anaheim, now accepts hazardous household trash. 
</P>
<P>
But within a year, at least five new sites will open in the county, including 
two in Huntington Beach and Stanton within a few months, said Janice Oest, 
coordinator for the county Fire Department's hazardous materials collection 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"Residents of Orange County have not had an alternative to get rid of hazardous 
household materials," other than special, one-time-only collections, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Each new site in the county will accept up to 5 gallons or 50 pounds of refuse 
per person, Oest said. 
</P>
<P>
Making the collection points more accessible to county residents is important 
because it reduces the amount of hazardous chemicals that are dumped with 
innocuous waste in ordinary landfills, said Huntington Beach public works 
analyst Jim Sankey. "A lot of people are throwing stuff away that they're not 
supposed to. But now there will be a place they can take it without charge," he 
said. The Huntington Beach collection site will open in November at the Rainbow 
Disposal Co. Inc., 17121 Nichols St. 
</P>
<P>
Stanton expects to begin collections by Jan. 1, and San Juan Capistrano, Brea 
and Irvine are expected to open sites within the next year, Oest said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Anaheim Regional Collection Center remains open Tuesdays 
through Fridays from 9 a.m. to. 1 p.m. and on Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.

<P>
LONG BEACH ORDERS MAN TO PAY $3,094 FOR CLEANUP OF SMALL PAINTING JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the freshly painted trim outside his house is bright blue, Martin 
Luyben is seeing red these days over the city of Long Beach's reaction to a 
$100 home-maintenance project. 
</P>
<P>
Luyben has been ordered to pay $3,094 for the cost of a professional hazardous 
materials crew sent by the city to clean stains from the curb near his house, 
where paint-tainted water collected after Luyben's painter washed off his 
brush. 
</P>
<P>
"They came in here in their moon suits, like something out of 'Ghostbusters,' " 
said the 28-year-old Blackthorne Avenue resident. "They were wearing masks and 
gowns like they were getting ready for surgery." 
</P>
<P>
Luyben vows that he will not pay the bill, which he received from the city in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
It's not so much the money, he said (though there are things he'd rather do 
with the $3,000). It's the principle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tiny Amount 
</P>
<P>
He said the tiny amount of water-based paint that washed into the street's 
gutter from the brush was nontoxic and barely visible. And besides, he said, 
city officials never bothered to ask him to clean it up before sending in the 
heavy artillery. 
</P>
<P>
But adamant City Hall leaders say they are prepared to use their legal muscle 
to collect the money. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they acted properly by quickly stopping the blue paint from 
trickling into the city's storm drain system, which empties into the city's 
waterfront. Because of the potential danger, they said, they did not have time 
to get Luyben to clean the gutter. 
</P>
<P>
The paint dispute began May 5 when Luyben said he paid a handyman $100 to touch 
up the wood trim with a half-full can of latex paint from his garage. 
</P>
<P>
When the paint ran out, the painter washed off his brush in the driveway with a 
garden hose. The bluish-colored water flowed out of the driveway and about 100 
yards down the street's gutter, Luyben said. 
</P>
<P>
Luyben said he returned home from his job at his family-run mortuary that 
evening and was firing up the back yard barbecue when professional toxic-waste 
removers called in by the city showed up. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member cleanup crew never asked what the substance in the gutter was, 
Luyben said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, they said nothing to him at all, except to ask to borrow his 
garden hose. 
</P>
<P>
"All the neighbors came out to watch. They couldn't believe what was 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
Diana M. Bonta, director of the Long Beach Department of Health and Human 
Services, said an anonymous caller notified authorities about the pale blue 
slick, which had spread 2 1/2 blocks by the time the call came in. She said 
city inspectors feared that toxic, oil-based paint had been dumped into 
Luyben's gutter. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sensitive to the environment because we're a coastal city," Deputy City 
Manager John H. Williams said. "We want to protect the integrity of the water 
in the bay here." 
</P>
<P>
Luyben said he could not believe it when he got the city's detailed bill about 
a month after the paint job. It itemized every glove, the truck and the vacuum 
pump used by the city-contracted hazardous materials ("hazmat") team. According 
to Luyben, city officials told him not to worry about paying the bill when he 
telephoned them the next day to complain. 
</P>
<P>
"I called the city manager and he started laughing hysterically. He said, 
'Don't lose any sleep on this -- we'll get it taken care of,' " Luyben said. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager James Hankla could not be reached for comment. But other officials 
denied laughing at the incident. They said the city has no intention of paying 
for Luyben's cleanup out of municipal funds -- although they have asked the 
cleanup company to recalculate the bill and reduce it by about $500. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Mistake Was His' 
</P>
<P>
"I feel bad about his predicament. But the mistake was his, not the city's," 
Mayor Ernie Kell said. "Either he pays or the rest of the citizens do. I can't 
see having the rest of the taxpayers pay for it. If he doesn't pay it . . . it 
will go to the city attorney." 
</P>
<P>
Bonta of the health department said state law requires inspectors to consider 
"any colored material in a gutter" as hazardous waste until it is 
satisfactorily identified. Luyben's vacuumed-up paint was not analyzed in a 
laboratory because of the city's desire to keep his cleanup bill down, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Kell and Bonta said Luyben's expensive experience has caused Long Beach to 
re-evaluate its procedure for hiring private "hazmat" crews. Future cleanup 
contracts will be awarded through a different bidding process, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Back on Blackthorne Avenue, however, some still believe that the city was 
giving Luyben's paintbrush complaint the brushoff. 
</P>
<P>
Delivery truck driver Jim Obbema characterized the city's cleanup efforts as 
overkill. "It's sad the little guy always ends up paying," Obbema said.

POLLUTION: THE STATE AND THE EPA PROPOSE TO ISSUE PERMITS TO BUILD A PLANT TO 
TREAT HAZARDOUS MATERIALS LESS THAN A BLOCK FROM HOMES AND HUNTINGTON PARK 
HIGH.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to build a plant to treat hazardous waste less than a block from 
homes and Huntington Park High School is expected to draw strong opposition 
during a public hearing Tuesday night at the school. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Health Services and the Environmental Protection Agency 
are proposing to issue permits to Chem-Clear Inc. that would allow the firm to 
treat daily up to 120,000 gallons of hazardous industrial waste. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, state and federal officials will decide whether to issue the 
permit or to require that changes be made in the operation of the proposed 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
The plant would be built in an abandoned factory at Slauson and Boyle avenues 
in heavily industrial Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
The site is on Huntington Park's northern border, a stone's throw from the 
school and homes. Residents, students, state legislators and even the Los 
Angeles Board of Education have opposed the plant since the proposal came under 
public scrutiny about two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Industrial wastes, including hexavalent chromium, acids and other hazardous 
chemicals from Los Angeles area factories, would be hauled to the facility by 
tanker on freeways and city streets. Water would be separated from the 
materials and disposed of by sewer. Sludge containing hazardous metals and 
other materials would be hauled to a landfill in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Park High health teacher Richard Loya is one of the plan's most 
vocal foes. He has taught his students about the potential dangers of the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
"As a teacher, I have to be concerned about the safety of my kids, and this is 
adding extra risk," Loya said. "Do we need that added risk in this area, 
especially right across the street from the school?" 
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for Chem-Clear, which is owned by a subsidiary of Union Pacific 
Railroad, said the plant would enable area factories to dispose of their waste 
safely, rather than store it in leaky barrels or dumping the waste illegally. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a need for a facility like this, to get this stuff, deal with it and 
get it out of the community," Chem-Clear spokesman Xavier Hermosillo said. 
</P>
<P>
A study by a private firm assessing the health risks the plant would pose has 
been completed since the last public hearing was held in July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The study, sure to be the focus of Tuesday night's hearing, indicates that 
plant emissions would not pose a substantial risk. 
</P>
<P>
The plant would not incinerate wastes but would emit minute amounts of 
hazardous chemicals during processing. Depending on the waste treated, those 
emissions could include tiny amounts of such chemicals as benzene, a 
carcinogen. 
</P>
<P>
The study indicated that such emissions would cause, at most, fewer than one 
additional case of cancer per million people -- well within the range 
considered acceptable by state health officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't feel that anyone would be at risk from breathing the air," said 
Florence Pearson, senior hazardous materials specialist for the state 
Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
But the study indicated that a spill at the facility or by a truck hauling 
hazardous waste could cause injuries. One scenario cited by the study would be 
a spill from a 25,000-gallon drum containing waste that is 18% hydrochloric 
acid, the maximum concentration of hydrochloric acid that would be allowed in 
waste processed at the facility. Dikes would contain the spill but vapors would 
escape into the air. 
</P>
<P>
Such a spill is an extremely unlikely, worst-case scenario, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
"Any individual located in the immediate vicinity of or directly downwind and 
close to the accident site would be likely to suffer serious adverse health 
effects," the study said. 
</P>
<P>
Those effects could include burns to the nose, throat, lungs and skin, and even 
death. In such a spill, vapors could reach the school, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
But Pearson, the state specialist on hazardous materials, said: "There are a 
tremendous number of safeguards that are built into the process that would 
prevent this from happening." 
</P>
<P>
Up to 8,000 gallons of flammable waste would be stored at the site in a special 
room designed to keep a fire from spreading, the report said. The study cited 
many variables and did not predict what sort of health risks would result from 
toxic smoke produced from such a fire. 
</P>
<P>
Hermosillo, the Chem-Clear spokesman, said the firm has made some concessions 
because of public concern. For example, Chem-Clear dropped plans to treat 
cyanide waste, although the proposed permit would allow cyanide waste to be 
stored at the facility before being transported to the Utah landfill. 
</P>
<P>
But those concessions have not yet won over foes such as Assemblywoman Lucille 
Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles), who are concerned about the proliferation of 
such plants in populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still not convinced that it's not going to pose some danger to the 
existing school that's right across the street," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing begins at 7 p.m. Tuesday at the Huntington Park High Auditorium, 
6020 Miles Ave., Huntington Park.

A PLACE FOR HOUSEHOLD WASTES; 
</P>
<P>
NEW COLLECTION CENTER WILL ACCEPT WHAT MOTHER NATURE MAY NOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having motor oil, paints, pesticides and other toxics around the house can 
really add up. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Orange County estimate that each household generates about 7.5 
pounds of hazardous waste per year, for a total of about 3,000 tons per year in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
But what to do with it all? 
</P>
<P>
Many places around the country in recent years, Orange County included, have 
held hazardous waste collection days for the environmentally conscious 
homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
That's all to the good. 
</P>
<P>
The public response has been heartening, too, a sign that many people 
understand the dangers posed by illegal dumping of hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even the best intentions can result in frayed nerves for the people 
stuck waiting in line to leave their items on rare collection days. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County now has a good answer -- it has opened its first permanent 
collection center for hazardous waste in Anaheim, giving residents the best 
legal alternative for disposal of toxic materials. 
</P>
<P>
Free of charge, residents can drop off household materials at 2761 E. White 
Star Ave. from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
The site is one of six expected to open in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Others are to open by the end of the summer in San Juan Capistrano, Huntington 
Beach, Brea and Stanton, and the county is looking for a location in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim center is located on property already used as a commercial garbage 
transfer station, and serves as a collection point. From there, the waste will 
be hauled to special toxic-waste landfills, disposal sites, or recycling 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors, which approved the funding for household waste 
centers last year, is to be congratulated for having the vision to go ahead 
with this project. 
</P>
<P>
The center signals the county's willingness to help keep hazardous materials 
out of sewers or storm drains, where they end up damaging the environment.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PRIVATE FIRM CONTRACTED FOR 
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city will turn to the private sector in an effort to avoid what it believes 
are excessive new charges for emergency handling of hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council authorized City Manager Lee Risner and City Atty. Richard D. 
Jones to enter into a contract for handling hazardous materials with Disposal 
Control Services Inc. by Oct 1. 
</P>
<P>
For the past five years, the service has been provided free by Anaheim. 
Effective Oct. 1, however, the service will cost $68,400 annually. 
</P>
<P>
The free services had grown out of an agreement among Orange County cities to 
support grant proposals by five of the county's largest fire departments for 
hazardous materials equipment, training and personnel. Those departments are 
Anaheim, Huntington Beach, Newport Beach, Santa Ana and Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, those agencies established a joint powers agreement and 
determined that charges should be imposed to cover rising costs. 
</P>
<P>
According to a study conducted by La Habra, units assigned to hazardous 
materials duties also respond to other types of emergencies. This led the city 
and a number of other communities with their own fire departments to conclude 
that the costs were too high and that fewer units were needed to meet needs. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the plan to contract for services approved by the City Council on 
Tuesday, Fire Department personnel will also receive hazardous materials 
training, while the option of calling on Anaheim for emergencies beyond the 
capabilities of the private company will be retained.

DUMPING PLAN SOUGHT FOR HOUSEHOLD WASTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To discourage illegal dumping of household hazardous wastes, county health 
officials are proposing the creation of two special collection stations at 
existing landfills and working with four private stations elsewhere in the 
county to handle such materials. 
</P>
<P>
Operating the pilot program would cost about $1.2 million a year. To pay for 
it, county officials have proposed a 25-cent a ton surcharge on trash deposited 
at county landfills. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is part of a series of changes in landfill fees recommended by 
county health and waste management experts. Under the plan, the basic landfill 
rate on July 1 would jump from the current fee of $11 per ton to $13.75 per 
ton, which includes the surcharge. Fees for individual trucks using the 
landfills would increase from $4 to $5 a load, but the rate for individual cars 
would remain at $3 per load. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to hold a public hearing on the proposal 
at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The fee increases are being proposed to offset the costs of the planned 
closings of the Coyote Canyon landfill south of Irvine and the Santiago Canyon 
landfill east of Orange later this year, and the simultaneous opening of the 
Bee Canyon Landfill northeast of Irvine, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Complying with more stringent environmental regulations for disposing and 
handling trash also has proved more costly for the county. 
</P>
<P>
The special collection stations for household hazardous wastes would be created 
at existing landfills in Brea and San Juan Capistrano. The county also would 
work with private facilities in Anaheim, Stanton, Huntington Beach and Irvine.

USERS OVERWHELM TOXIC WASTE CENTER

<P>
A new drop-off site for household hazardous materials -- the first of its kind 
in the county -- has attracted so many people since opening on July 5 that it 
has had to close early and turn residents away. 
</P>
<P>
County officials, ready to open the site again this morning, are asking 
residents not to storm the place and to observe state law that allows 
individuals to carry a maximum of five gallons or 50 pounds of toxics at a 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"People have been holding materials for so long they're bringing truckloads," 
said Jaimy Gentry, assistant coordinator for the Orange County Fire 
Department's Household Hazardous Materials Collection Project. "But they've had 
it in their garage for 10 years -- two more weeks isn't going to hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Hours of the center are 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. today through Thursday and 9 a.m. to 3 
p.m. Saturday. But the doors have been closed at least one hour early every day 
since the site opened. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 cars daily have passed through the center, delivering household 
toxics such as paint, insecticides and motor oil. Most people were carrying 
more than the limit, causing a number of cars to be turned away. 
</P>
<P>
Gentry noted that on Saturday lines were especially long -- some residents 
waiting up to an hour -- and encouraged people to wait until the rush dies down 
to bring in their toxic trash. 
</P>
<P>
Until the center opened, county residents had no permanent site for legally 
disposing of household toxics. 
</P>
<P>
The county, which funds the Anaheim operation, plans to set up five other 
permanent sites by the end of the year, in Huntington Beach, Stanton, San Juan 
Capistrano, Brea and Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim center, at 2761 E. White Star Ave., accepts only household toxics. 
The waste is trucked out of the county to be either recycled, treated or taken 
to landfills. LISA MASCARO

100 EVACUATE AREA OF TOXIC SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two 55-gallon drums filled with an ether-based substance fell from a truck in 
Irvine, forcing authorities to cordon off the intersection of Von Karmen and 
McGaw avenues and evacuate about 100 people from two businesses Friday morning, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Fire Department spokeswoman Kathleen Cha said passers-by 
discovered the drums, which were leaking into a flood control channel, at about 
9:45 a.m. The drums fell from a truck from Anaheim-based Cypress Chemical Co., 
Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
Two hazardous-materials teams and a fire engine company were sent to the scene 
to determine the type of chemicals involved and to contain the spill in the 
business and light industrial area. 
</P>
<P>
Cha said the fact that the spill occurred in an open area when there were no 
winds helped firefighters quickly bring the situation under control. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials identified the ether-based substance as dipropylene glycol 
monomethyl ether, a chemical that is used as a solvent and in the manufacture 
of hydraulic brake fluids. It is moderately toxic and hazardous if absorbed 
through the skin or inhaled in large quantities, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials advised businesses to shut off air conditioners and close 
windows and doors to prevent fumes from entering buildings. No injuries were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Workers were allowed to return to their buildings about 1 p.m. and the 
intersection was reopened about 4 p.m. GEORGE BUNDY SMITH

A termite control truck carrying containers of pesticides overturned Friday, 
spilling a bug-killing chemical in a Placentia intersection and forcing 
authorities to evacuate more than 100 people in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The truck driver, Sal Rapabas, 26, of El Monte, suffered minor injuries when 
his vehicle collided with another small truck. No one else was hurt in the 
accident, which occurred about 9:20 a.m. at the intersection of Yorba Linda 
Boulevard and Kraemer Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Officials evacuated more than 100 people at the nearby El Torito Shopping 
Center and at a Fidelity Bank office as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
At least one 30-gallon container of the bug-killing chemical Dursban burst and 
spilled in the intersection, Orange County Fire Department spokeswoman Patti 
Range said. The chemical can cause a burning sensation if it comes in contact 
with skin or is inhaled, but there were no reports of injuries due to 
inhalation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rapabas, an employee of the Home Care Termite Control Co. in Anaheim, was 
treated for minor injuries at Placentia-Linda Community Hospital, Range said. 
</P>
<P>
The intersection was closed for about 2 hours while hazardous materials teams 
neutralized the chemical, Range said. She said the chemical was doused with 
bleach to neutralize it and that none of it seeped into storm drains.

VANDALS BLAMED FOR GASOLINE SPILL INTO L.A. RIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARISSE JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An apparent act of vandalism caused hundreds of gallons of diesel gasoline to 
be washed down a storm drain and into the Los Angeles River on Sunday, sending 
local and state officials scurrying to prevent the spill from flowing into the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
As much as 1,100 gallons of gasoline may have poured into the river after a 
fuel pump in a downtown city sanitation yard leaked for an unknown amount of 
time, said county flood control maintenance worker Bobby Arnwine. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that up to 1,100 gallons got away from us," he said. Arnwine added 
that about 1,600 gallons of the pump's gasoline apparently had leaked out, but 
500 gallons were contained in the yard with sand. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to trap the rest of the gasoline before it reached the ocean, 
officials set up floating booms in the river at three locations in the Long 
Beach area. As the gasoline was being trapped, workmen in rowboats were laying 
out cotton pads on the water's surface to absorb it. 
</P>
<P>
After letting the pads soak in the river, Gabriel Martinez and Alfonso Serrano 
guided their tiny boat through about two feet of algae-covered water and 
deposited the industrial sponges in large plastic bags on the shore. 
</P>
<P>
"We're mostly just picking up green slime," said Martinez, one of eight workers 
dispatched by Crosby and Overton Inc., a Long Beach-based firm that specializes 
in such cleanups. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the county's hazardous materials team said that a small quantity of 
fuel appeared to have formed a light sheen around some of the booms. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't say exactly how much, but it wasn't any great quantity," said Irwin 
Biederman, a hazardous materials specialist for the Department of Health 
Services. "This is a pretty minor event." 
</P>
<P>
As of Sunday evening, none of the fuel had entered the sewer system, officials 
said. Storm drains had been flushed out, and county health officials said a 
contractor had been called to finish cleaning up the spill at its source. 
</P>
<P>
The gasoline leak apparently began Saturday night or early Sunday morning in a 
city sanitation yard on Mission Road, just east of the river. Officials 
speculated that vandals may have sneaked into the yard and broken the nozzle on 
a gasoline pump, leaving it leaking. 
</P>
<P>
A city sanitation worker discovered the leak shortly before 8 a.m. and called 
the Fire Department, Staheli said. 
</P>
<P>
The spill's discovery came only a day after two neighborhoods in Long Beach had 
to be evacuated after four illegally dumped 55-gallon drums were discovered to 
be leaking a highly toxic and combustible chemical. Residents were allowed to 
return home after the cleanup was completed.

TOXIC SPILLS DISCOVERED IN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From a Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several hundred people were evacuated from two neighborhoods in Long Beach 
Saturday after four illegally dumped 55-gallon drums were discovered leaking a 
highly toxic and combustible chemical known as dimethyl phenol, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of about 30 homes were evacuated in each neighborhood -- located 
about four miles apart -- while hazardous material teams cleaned up the spills, 
which occurred in alleys near the 100 block of Eldridge Street and the 200 
block of Eleanor Lane, said Sgt. Dennis Webster. 
</P>
<P>
Two drums of the substance were found in each neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported, he said. Residents were allowed to return to their 
homes late Saturday after the clean up was completed. 
</P>
<P>
Webster said police suspect the illegally dumped drums contained industrial 
waste, but investigators had not determined the source. The chemical, also 
known as xylenol, is used as a disinfectant, solvent and fungicide for 
pharmaceuticals and dyestuffs. 
</P>
<P>
In a possibly related incident, three drums of hazardous material, believed to 
be methylene chloride, were found in an alley in nearby Signal Hill on Friday. 
Four police officers exposed to fumes from those drums were treated at Long 
Beach Memorial Hospital for headaches and nausea, Signal Hill police said. On 
May 5, barrels of similar chemicals were found at 343 E. Esther St. in Long 
Beach.

UNESCO has declared today International Literacy Day to focus on the worldwide 
problem of illiteracy. Orange County ranks seventh in the nation in the number 
of immigrants it receives each year, according to the Center for Immigration 
Studies in Washington D.C., and among them are many who do not speak English 
and lack skills in their native language as well. It is also estimated that one 
in five people in Orange County do not have the necessary reading, writing and 
comprehension skills necessary for employment advancement.

In just a few weeks, Capt. Bob Reynolds of the Costa Mesa Fire Department will 
receive computer equipment he says will make the department more effective when 
faced with hazardous spills. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted earlier this week to approve Reynolds' proposal to buy 
$16,898 in computer equipment that will give the department access to Cameo II, 
a database maintained by the National Safety Council that lists the chemical 
properties of thousands of hazardous materials and tells firefighters how to 
cope with a spill or fire. 
</P>
<P>
"Costa Mesa does not have a specially trained hazardous materials team to deal 
with these incidents," Reynolds said. "But even then, no one person could ever 
be trained to know all that's needed. 
</P>
<P>
"The computer will allow us to make a lifesaving response in an emergency. As 
it is now, if you make the wrong decision just once, a real disaster could 
result." 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds said the computer will also allow the department to create its own 
database, listing what hazardous materials are commonly used by industries in 
the city. JANICE JONES

<TEXT>
<P>
A chemical spill at a plating company on Monday forced the evacuation of about 
50 people working in the plant and other nearby businesses, fire officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 pounds of sodium hydrosulfite spilled at Platecorp, 1223 N. Batavia 
St., about 5:30 p.m., authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Hazardous material teams from Santa Ana and Anaheim assisted Orange 
firefighters in containing the spill that had the "potential to be highly toxic 
when mixed with water," Orange County fire dispatcher John Shope said. 
</P>
<P>
"People from the plant and adjacent businesses were evacuated as a precaution," 
Shope said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured during the incident, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials closed North Batavia Street between Katella Avenue and Struck 
Avenue for several hours while fire crews mopped up the chemical. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Orange County Health Care and Environmental Management 
agencies and the Southern California Air Quality Management District were 
notified of the spill. MATT LAIT

75 EVACUATED IN CHEMICAL SPILL AT SURGERY CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seventy-five workers at Memorial Health Center in Huntington Beach were 
evacuated Friday afternoon after an employee spotted a leak of a hazardous 
chemical in a storage room on the first floor of the building. 
</P>
<P>
According to Huntington Beach fire officials, a total of 31 firefighters and 
Orange County Health Care Agency specialists helped in the cleanup effort 
Friday afternoon and evening. There were no injuries, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The chemical was ethylene oxide, which is used to sterilize instruments for 
surgery. It is extremely flammable as well as being a health hazard, 
authorities said. It was kept in two 90-pound tanks in the storeroom. 
</P>
<P>
The center is an outpatient surgery center, the Huntington Beach Fire 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
The Westminster Fire Department also participated in the cleanup, fire 
officials said.

40 EVACUATED AFTER SPILL IN UCI SCIENCE BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 40 people in the UC Irvine Physical Sciences Building were evacuated 
Friday night when about 4 liters of a hazardous material, cyclopentadiene, was 
spilled in a fifth-floor stock room. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported, although two students complained of dizziness and 
were taken to the Student Health Center as a precaution, said Linda Granell, 
UCI director of public information. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 fire safety personnel, including two hazardous-materials teams, were 
called to the campus at 7:54 p.m., Orange County Fire Department spokesman Dan 
Southworth said. 
</P>
<P>
The teams cleaned up the material, which has a strong, perfume-like odor and is 
harmful when inhaled in large amounts, Granell said.

<LEADPARA>  Throughout the South Bay, hazardous materials are used and stored near where
people live and work. If the worst were to happen -- a major earthquake, a
fire in storage building, human error or even sabotage -- a toxic gas release
or uncontrollable fire could threaten many lives.;    Here are 10 places fire
officials say would be of great concern if there were such a gasrelease or
fire. They are near residential areas, and there are significant amounts of
hazardous materials at each. The sites are numbered according to location; the
numbers do not reflect any sort of ranking. Some have long records of
compliance with fire prevention and hazardous materials laws; others are in
violation of such laws or have been cited in the past. The Mercury News
checked fire department files during September, October and November of 1990.
Often, it is difficult to verify whether violations have been corrected,
because sites are usually only inspected once a year. Unless a violation
presents immediate or extreme danger or is long-standing, fire officials won't
find out whether it's been corrected until the next inspection.  </LEADPARA>

SPILL CLOSES PORTION OF CHINO HILLS PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Several acres of the Chino Hills State Park remained closed this weekend as 
efforts continued to clean up a chemical spill that contaminated a creek bed 
and caused a chemical burn on one bicyclist, state officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 466 gallons of water containing a high level of sodium hydroxide 
-- a powdered chemical commonly added to drinking water -- apparently leaked 
into the Telegraph Canyon creek south of Carbon Canyon Road for several days 
before it was discovered on Oct. 28, a Department of Fish and Game warden said. 
</P>
<P>
A cyclist on a mountain bike crossed the creek and later felt an itching and 
burning sensation on his feet, warden Ralph Sugg said. The cyclist went to a 
local hospital, and physicians diagnosed his ailment as a "chemical burn," Sugg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hazardous material specialists with the Brea and Orange County fire departments 
traced the chemical leak to the Metropolitan Water District's Diemer filtration 
plant on a ridge above Telegraph Canyon, less than a half mile from the creek. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that the water carrying the chemical was slowly trickling out of a 
pressure relief valve," Sugg said. "MWD quickly sealed it off, but the cleanup 
is going to take some time." 
</P>
<P>
Sodium hydroxide is added to public drinking water supplies to prevent lead and 
acid buildup. When diluted in large water supplies, such as reservoirs, the 
chemical poses no health hazard. But when humans are exposed to the widely used 
industrial chemical in large concentrations, it can cause eye and skin 
irritation. 
</P>
<P>
The 466 gallons of water that contaminated the creek had a "50% solution" of 
sodium hydroxide, Sugg said. He estimated that about a half mile of the creek 
was polluted, including three to four feet of soil on either side of the creek 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
Telegraph Canyon is on the western edge of the 11,000-acre Chino Hills State 
Park, and the dirt road that runs through the canyon and along the creek is 
popular among hikers, cyclists and horse riders. But it remained closed Sunday 
as cleanup crews continued to remove tainted soil and vegetation from the creek 
bottom. A chain-link fence has been erected across the road, and the MWD has 
posted guards to keep outsiders away. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Black, an Anaheim resident who often rides horses in the canyon, said he 
was angered Sunday when the guards refused to disclose why the trail had been 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
"If they've got a toxic chemical down in the dirt, why are they keeping this so 
hush-hush?" he asked. "This is a state park bordering on several large 
communities. I think people have a right to know." 
</P>
<P>
Sugg said the spill is under investigation by state Fish and Game, the Orange 
County Sheriff's Department and the state Regional Water Quality Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
Sugg said the cleanup is time-consuming because of the thick vegetation that 
lines the narrow creek and canyon bottom. Sugg said officials want to preserve 
as much of the brush and trees as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"We could take bulldozers and just level that area, and get that dirt out," he 
said. "But that's not the way to do it. We don't want to disturb any more of 
the area than necessary."

2 HURT, 300 EVACUATED IN CHEMICAL EXPLOSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two workmen suffered minor injuries in a chemical explosion at an airplane 
parts manufacturing plant Friday that forced the evacuation of 300 employees, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred at 12:52 p.m. in the rear of Air Industries Corp. in the 
12500 block of Knott Avenue, Garden Grove, Fire Department officials said. 
Employees at the plant and in the surrounding businesses were evacuated 
immediately. Firefighters said it was not necessary to evacuate residents 
living across the street or students at nearby Pacifica High School. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred when two workers added what they believed to be bleach 
to another drum of bleach. However, they were actually adding acid to the 
bleach, and the explosion resulted, Garden Grove Fire Capt. Bill Dumas said. 
</P>
<P>
"The explosion was in a chain-linked area, and the chemical leaked into a diked 
area, where it was contained," Fire Capt. Cameron Phillips said. A 
chlorine-type odor was detected, he said, but the high school was not in the 
affected area." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators were still trying Friday night to determine the exact type of 
chemicals involved in the explosion, Dumas said. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said the two men who mixed the materials were taken to Humana Hospital 
Westminster after complaining of ear pains. A hospital spokeswoman said both 
were treated for minor injuries and released. 
</P>
<P>
"We heard a large explosion in the rear and we went back there and a couple of 
boys were plugging their ear drums up a little bit," said Pat Shierden, a 
foreman at the plant." 
</P>
<P>
Hazardous materials specialists from both the Anaheim and Orange County fire 
departments were called to the scene. Police barricades were set up for several 
hours to divert traffic from Knott Avenue at Lampson Avenue and Garden Grove 
Boulevard, causing traffic jams throughout the area.

   WASHINGTON -- United Parcel Service faces possible federal
fines of $625,000 on charges of worker-safety violations
after a call from Nassau County, N.Y., police warned OSHA
that a UPS driver was injured by a hazardous chemical carried
by his delivery truck.
   The Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health
Administration charged UPS with 312 willful record-keeping
violations at its Uniondale, N.Y., facility, including 310
instances of improper recording of employees on restricted
work activity. OSHA said it has issued numerous citations for
record-keeping violations by UPS over the past 16 years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   United Parcel Service of America Inc., the closely held
package-delivery company based in Greenwich, Conn., said it
was studying the complaint and hadn't decided on a response.
Most of the citation, however, dealt with "alleged violations
of written procedures and guidelines," which are "complex and
subject to conflicting interpretations," UPS said.
   The company also was cited for failure to develop an
emergency response plan, or to train all workers in how to
respond to an emergency involving hazardous materials, and
for not supplying a proper respirator for employees handling
hazardous-materials spills.
   OSHA said its inspection of the Uniondale facility
resulted from a call from the Nassau County police
hazardous-materials team, after methylene chloride, a
suspected carcinogen, spilled from a box bound for delivery
in the truck. The driver touched the chemical, then put his
hand to his face, sustaining hand and facial injuries, OSHA
said.
   UPS has 15 working days to contest the citations before
the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review
Commission.

INDUSTRIES THAT POLLUTE ARE FACING LOTS OF DIRTY WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George J. Smith may be one of the few corporate environmental managers in 
Orange County who can look ahead to next year with equanimity. His company, an 
Anaheim-based computer circuit board manufacturer called Aeroscientific, has a 
state-of-the-art waste treatment system, and top management made a strong 
commitment to environmental protection several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The wave of new rules on air and water pollution, hazardous waste disposal, 
garbage recycling and other environmental issues that will be implemented 
during the year ahead therefore shouldn't cause any severe disruptions for 
Smith and his firm. But the same cannot be said for many other Orange County 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
1990, in fact, could go down as the year that Southland companies really 
changed the way they think about environmental protection. The regulations that 
come into effect in 1990, combined with the establishment of specific targets 
for even more stringent pollution-reduction measures that will kick in later in 
the decade, will make it painfully clear that Band-Aid solutions are no longer 
a practical option. 
</P>
<P>
"Band-Aids have heavy operations and maintenance costs," noted Douglas K. 
Garfield, an associate in the Orange County office of Dames &amp; Moore, a 
large construction and engineering company that is experiencing huge growth in 
its environmental consulting business. "You can say, 'What do I need to do to 
respond to these specific requirements?' Or you can step back and start to look 
at everything, all your processes, in light of what is likely to occur." 
</P>
<P>
Regulatory Vise 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, what is likely to occur over the course of the next decade is a steady 
tightening of the regulatory vise which will severely limit the use of many 
common industrial chemicals and require substantial new capital investments in 
pollution control for companies ranging from large aerospace concerns to the 
neighborhood auto body shop. 
</P>
<P>
And what is a certain to occur in 1990 is a series of local, state, and federal 
regulations which will: 
</P>
<P>
* Bar the disposal of untreated hazardous wastes on land. 
</P>
<P>
* Require companies to catalogue emissions into the air of even small amounts 
of toxic chemicals, and then, in conjunction with regulatory agencies, assess 
the risk they pose. 
</P>
<P>
* Limit the ability of companies to install facilities which contribute to air 
pollution without first reducing pollution at existing facilities. 
</P>
<P>
* Further restrict the use of certain so-called "volatile organic chemicals" -- 
commonly used in paints and solvents -- and of the notorious ozone-depleting 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). 
</P>
<P>
* Establish new rules for the proper handling of medical wastes. 
</P>
<P>
* Mandate that much of the regular trash produced by businesses and residences 
be recycled. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of these measures on business is far from uniform, hitting some 
small manufacturing firms in businesses such as metal plating and painting very 
hard while leaving some larger, cleaner industries relatively unscathed. But 
few will escape entirely. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that next year will be a turning point, but there will be more 
regulations, more restrictions, and costs are going to escalate," said Duane 
Jordan, an active member of the Industrial Environmental Coalition of Orange 
County and an environmental manager at a large local manufacturing company. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most important measures to take effect in 1990 is the final phase of 
a state and federal prohibition on the land disposal of certain untreated 
hazardous substances. Known as the "land ban," the rule will require that all 
hazardous materials be treated even if they are being dumped in regulated 
hazardous waste landfills. 
</P>
<P>
Many dangerous substances are already subject to the land ban, but the third 
phase of the rule, set for implementation on May 8, will affect a number of 
materials -- such as heavy metal sludges -- that are not acutely toxic but are 
produced in great volume by industries such as electronics and metal finishing. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Department of 
Health Services are now scrambling to develop treatment standards for the 
various affected substances. If no standards have been established by May, or 
if adequate treatment capacity is not available, some wastes could be exempted 
from the ban. 
</P>
<P>
Forms of Treatment 
</P>
<P>
Treatment often involves a process called "fixation," in which the waste is 
solidified so that it will not leak into ground water, and some of the wastes 
affected by the land ban can be treated relatively easily. The cost burden on 
some smaller firms could nonetheless be significant enough to cause serious 
disruptions, or even desperate and illegal solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"I fear (the land ban) will lead to an increase in illegal dumping," said 
Robert Merryman, chief of the Environmental Health Division of the Orange 
County Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
To help small companies cope with the land ban, the Orange County Fire 
Department is developing an education campaign to help disseminate information 
on alternatives, said Karen Peters, head of the department's hazardous 
materials program. 
</P>
<P>
"The little guys get crunched, because they don't have a staff to analyze the 
waste streams," Peters noted. "We want to get as much information out there as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
Larger companies, meanwhile, are already taking a number of steps in response 
to the land ban. A McDonnell Douglas spokeswoman said the company is spending 
"millions" to revamp its hazardous waste disposal systems. The company is using 
fixation for some wastes, incinerating others, and increasing its efforts to 
recycle some hazardous materials and find substitutes for others, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The land ban may also force companies to begin planning for a September, 1991, 
deadline for evaluating all sources of hazardous waste and identifying specific 
waste reduction measures. Already, any company disposing of hazardous waste 
must certify that they have a waste minimization program in effect, but that 
rule is considered a mere formality. 
</P>
<P>
"People are going to start getting ready for the source evaluation," predicted 
Gail Brice, vice president in the Orange County office of McLaren, an 
environmental consulting firm. "There will have to be a huge commitment to 
waste minimization programs." 
</P>
<P>
At Hughes Aircraft, a program called the "zero disposal initiative" has been in 
place since last year, according to environmental health manager Renzo Venturo, 
who added that the company is working to "change processes, change materials 
and change what we buy" to limit the amount of waste that needs disposal. 
</P>
<P>
A similar commitment is now being forced upon companies in regard to the 
emission of toxic materials into the air. A new state law requires all firms to 
conduct an audit of "air toxics," and next year regulators will begin to 
conduct "risk assessments" based on the results of those audits. 
</P>
<P>
Companies judged to be posing too great a risk to the surrounding communities 
-- the exact levels of acceptable risk for different substances will be 
established next year -- will be required to cut their emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Brice said that "enlightened" companies would begin preliminary risk assessment 
now, so they might be able to eliminate trouble spots before the state comes in 
and mandates what could be more dramatic and expensive action. "Now is the time 
to implement the plan," said Brice, who added that the aerospace, petroleum and 
electronics industries would be especially affected by the air toxics law. 
</P>
<P>
"To wait will be a lot more costly than doing it up front," added Garfield. 
</P>
<P>
It might be more difficult for companies to prepare for some of the 19 measures 
likely to be adopted next year by the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District as part of the comprehensive -- and controversial -- Air Quality 
Management Plan approved last March. The proposals are now in draft form and 
are likely to be approved by the AQMD board in 1990 as part of the first phase 
of the broad, three-phase effort to bring the Los Angeles basin into compliance 
with federal air quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more arcane, but potentially most influential, of the AQMD measures 
has to do with changes in the "new source review" requirements for emissions 
from factories and other stationary sources of pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, any new or existing company that wants to bring a polluting facility 
on-line has to "offset" any new pollution by reducing pollution from an 
existing source, if emissions from the new plant exceed a certain threshold. If 
the company cannot reduce pollution elsewhere, it can purchase offsets on the 
open market from a company that has reduced pollution without opening new 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Fuel Conversion 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed new rules, which the AQMD board is expected to decide on in 
March, the minimum threshold for offsetting would be eliminated, meaning any 
new source would require offsetting reductions, explained an AQMD spokesman. 
Moreover, all outstanding offset credits would be discounted by 80%. And that's 
in addition to the general requirement to use the best available technology to 
control emissions from any new source. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD will also be considering a number of initiatives for future 
implementation, including measures to require operators of vehicle fleets to 
convert to cleaner fuels, rules to further controls on emissions and wastes 
from bakeries and dry cleaners, new restrictions on release of gases from small 
boilers, and a complete phase-out of fuel-oil use by local utilities and other 
power generators. 
</P>
<P>
Several other AQMD proposals could impose further rules governing the use of 
volatile organic chemicals (used in paints, solvents, and many other 
applications) and chlorofluorocarbons. CFCs have been banned in aerosol sprays 
for more than a decade, but they are still widely used in air-conditioning 
coolants and as a solvent for cleaning electronic components. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Irvine, in a widely publicized move last July, imposed its own 
total ban on CFC use within the city, and that measure is scheduled to take 
effect July 1. Local electronics companies, however, say they are in good shape 
to comply with the rule. "We are getting rid of some of our CFC-based products, 
replacing them with an aqueous cleaning product that's like soap and water," 
said John Olson, vice president of manufacturing at the personal computer maker 
AST Research. 
</P>
<P>
Olson added that the company supported the CFC ban, and that it didn't 
anticipate problems with other new environmental rules. A Western Digital 
spokesman said his company was committed to working with the city on the CFC 
issue, and that it is currently seeking an exemption to use a CFC substitute 
that has a less severe impact on the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the local level, the county and cities will be working to develop 
recycling programs for regular residential and business trash in accordance 
with a state law requiring a 25% reduction in the amount of garbage shipped to 
landfills by 1995, and a 50% reduction by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
And though there are no specific new rules this year, a major concern for many 
local companies will be cleaning up ground water and soil polluted by recently 
removed underground storage tanks. In the real estate industry, even greater 
vigilance is expected regarding possible contamination problems and liability 
on any property that changes hands. 
</P>
<P>
The state government will not be idle either, as it moves to pass new 
legislation governing the handling and disposal of infectious medical wastes. 
</P>
<P>
d 
</P>
<P>
Clean Air Act 
</P>
<P>
And on the federal level, Congress is expected to pass next year the 
long-delayed reauthorization of the Clean Air Act. The impact of the 
legislation in California will be limited, because a key part of the 
legislation deals with the Eastern and Midwestern problem of acid rain, and 
because air pollution standards in California generally exceed federal 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
But the exact shape of the legislation could have a major impact on the type of 
regulatory policies adopted throughout the country over the next decade, 
because state and local policy makers often follow the lead of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"Congress will have to decide whether to micro-manage the controls on every 
smokestack, or whether to go with an enforceable market incentive plan," said 
Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund. "How that 
debate goes will effect not only how the acid rain rules are written, but also 
the type of environmental laws that get passed in the future." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION 
</P>
<P>
Numerous government bodies are involved in implementing environmental 
protection policies. Many pollution problems involve more than one agency, and 
in those cases a "lead agency" will usually be designated. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: 
</P>
<P>
Federal agency that enforces such federal environmental laws as the Clean Air 
Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource Recovery and Conservation Act. 
</P>
<P>
California Department of Health Services: 
</P>
<P>
State agency with overall responsibility for many state environmental laws. Key 
divisions include the Toxic Substances Control Division and the Environmental 
Health Division. 
</P>
<P>
California Air Resources Board: 
</P>
<P>
Responsible for regulating automobile emissions and overseeing implementation 
of state clean air laws and the policies of the regional air quality districts. 
</P>
<P>
California Water Resources Control Board: 
</P>
<P>
Responsible for regulating the use and quality of surface and ground water, and 
overseeing the activities of the regional water quality control districts' 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
South Coast Air Quality Management District: 
</P>
<P>
State-chartered agency covering Orange County and four others, the AQMD has 
authority to set and enforce rules for all stationary sources of air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Water Quality Control Districts:: 
</P>
<P>
Two state-chartered agencies have the authority to set and enforce rules 
protecting water quality in the county. The Santa Ana district covers North 
County; the San Diego district, South County. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Water District: 
</P>
<P>
Responsible for supplying water. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Health Care Agency: 
</P>
<P>
The agency's Environmental Health Division enforces regulations regarding 
handling and disposal of hazardous waste, storage of hazardous materials in 
underground tanks, ground water cleanup projects, and oversees clean-up of 
hazardous waste spills. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Sanitation District: 
</P>
<P>
Permits and regulates discharge of waste water to the sewage system, and 
operates sewage treatment plants, in most of the county. Local sanitation 
districts have responsibility elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County General Services Administration: 
</P>
<P>
Operates landfills for regular trash and has general responsibility for solid 
waste disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Fire Department: 
</P>
<P>
With 16 local fire departments, the county department regulates the storage and 
handling of hazardous materials, and performs emergency response.

D.A. SPECIAL UNIT AIMS TO CLEAN UP ON COUNTY POLLUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jonathan Weber, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the public discovers environmental protection, prosecutors are discovering 
environmental crime. From the Justice Department in Washington to city 
attorney's offices around the country, environmental protection has suddenly 
become a front-burner issue, and new resources are being devoted to the complex 
task of enforcing pollution laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental crimes can range from clandestine dumping of toxic waste to 
unauthorized emissions of chemicals to violations of obscure monitoring or 
record-keeping rules. In the past, most such transgressions drew only small 
fines or warnings, and criminal prosecutions were rare. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, empowered by new legislation beefing up the penalties for many 
environmental crimes, prosecutors are seeking felony convictions carrying heavy 
fines and jail sentences for polluters. Illegal dumping accounts for the most 
serious cases, but less damaging violations of previously unenforced laws -- 
such as those requiring the monitoring of underground fuel tanks -- are also 
drawing attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The complexity of many environmental regulations, however, can make 
environmental prosecution a difficult business. Prosecutors must undertake 
lengthy investigations to determine the source of pollution, for example, and 
then make tricky judgments about who is ultimately responsible for it and how 
heavily they should be punished. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Orange County district attorney's office, the environmental crime unit 
has more than doubled in size over the past year, and now includes two 
full-time and one part-time deputy district attorneys, two investigators and a 
paralegal. Times staff writer Jonathan Weber recently spoke with unit 
supervisor Jan J. Nolan and deputies Christopher P. Kralick and Gerald G. 
Johnston about their priorities as environmental prosecutors and about how they 
handle some of the more difficult aspects of this new area of law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. What are some of the more serious environmental crime cases that have been 
prosecuted over the past several years? 
</P>
<P>
A. Nolan: First of all, you have to understand that this unit is fairly new. It 
started about four years ago, but in the past year we have had a significant 
change in personnel, and we have enlarged the unit. So we can go back about a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
One of our major current cases is against the Metropolitan Water District. 
Their plumbing system (allegedly) discharged some toxic chemicals into a creek 
in Santa Ana Canyon, and several bicyclists who rode through the creek suffered 
burns on their legs. So we have felony charges pending against the MWD, and we 
have misdemeanors against some of the officers and directors of the 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What other major cases are pending? 
</P>
<P>
A. Johnston: We are reviewing allegations against W.C. Richards Co. (operator 
of an Anaheim paint manufacturing plant). In that case, we were anonymously 
informed that the company was unlawfully disposing of its hazardous wastes, 
solvents and other things that were byproducts of the paint manfacturing 
process. Ordinarily, you have to manifest (register) these products and dispose 
of them at a proper facility. It's very expensive, about $500 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
What allegedly was happening at W.C. Richards was that employees each day were 
taking those waste products and mixing them with sawdust. They would then take 
that mixture and shovel it into a dumpster, which was put out for disposal at 
an ordinary landfill. As far as we know, all those substances went to the 
Brea-Olinda landfill, and under state law that is not a proper disposition of 
those kinds of waste. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You said that you got an anonymous tip. How do you generally find your leads 
in these kinds of cases? 
</P>
<P>
A. Johnston: In cases where you have unlawful dumping, you often have employees 
who are aware of it and become disgruntled, or become worried about their 
safety or the safety of others, and they will call some regulatory agency. 
Whatever agency hears about it will then usually come to our environmental 
crime task force, which meets once a month to discuss cases that have come up. 
From there, we will frequently initiate investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Who is on the task force? 
</P>
<P>
A. Nolan: It's chaired by our office, and it includes the California Highway 
Patrol, the Department of Fish and Game, the Health Services Department, the 
Regional Water Quality Control Board, the Orange County Sanitation District, 
the Orange County Environmental Management Agency, and the County Fire 
Department and local fire departments. The Air Quality Management District is 
part of it, and we hope to get them to start attending. 
</P>
<P>
Q. When was this task force put together? 
</P>
<P>
A. Nolan: About three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You said the task force meets once a month. How many cases are discussed at 
each meeting? 
</P>
<P>
A. Kralick: About 15 or 20. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston: And a lot of these things carry over from month to month. Many of 
these investigations are lengthy and complex, and it might take four or five or 
six months to put one of these cases together. We put together the 
investigations, and the agencies with the proper authority and interest will 
coordinate in different cases. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How many cases do you expect to prosecute this year? 
</P>
<P>
A. Johnston: Probably around 100. But we have a lot of cases coming in. 
Environmental awareness is expanding so much that many more agencies are now 
becoming interested and coming to us with the cases. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are the largest categories of violations? 
</P>
<P>
A. Nolan: About half will have to do with underground storage tanks. We've made 
a big effort in enforcing those rules. (Owners of underground storage tanks 
used for fuel and waste are required to monitor them for leaks and remove them 
if leaks are found.) 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are the other large categories of environmental crime? 
</P>
<P>
A. Kralick: Illegal disposal of hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston: Business emergency plans is another area where we have a lot of 
material coming in. 
</P>
<P>
Q. That's the requirement that businesses using hazardous materials have 
storage and emergency evacuation plans? 
</P>
<P>
A. Nolan: Yes. In most of those cases we're concentrating on compliance with 
the law rather than prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston: We also have quite a few smaller cases, involving dumping of 
materials into the bays and harbors. There is a real problem with that in 
Orange County, especially in Newport Harbor, and in Dana Point. The people in 
the boats are not always following the rules in regard to what they do with the 
waste from the toilets. 
</P>
<P>
The materials they dump tend to concentrate in the bays, and then you get 
production of coliform (fecal) bacteria and the water becomes unhealthy. So 
we're trying to do what we can to prosecute those cases when we can find them. 
We're getting the word out: You have to take more care in dumping waste from 
boats. 
</P>
<P>
Q. In cases where you have a choice, how do you decide whether to go for felony 
charges or misdemeanor charges? 
</P>
<P>
A. Johnston: It's a little hard to enumerate exactly, but I think it just 
depends on how serious we feel the conduct is, the degree of knowledge that the 
person had about the damage they were doing, the actual damage -- if we can 
figure it out -- and the volume and type of hazardous material. Generally, 
we're looking for someone who has dumped a significant quantity of hazardous 
material for us to file a felony. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How about the issue of knowing or not knowing? The law has been interpreted 
to say that you can bring felony charges even when someone didn't realize that 
what they were doing was illegal. Supposing someone has dumped a significant 
amount of waste, but the person really thought that the disposal method was 
proper when it wasn't. You could file felony charges, but some people might 
think that's not fair. 
</P>
<P>
A. Nolan: It depends on the amount of damage they have done, and the quantity 
of waste. In a situation like that, where they really didn't know, and there is 
a problem with whether or not they should have known, we also have the civil 
remedy. But based on that one element, we couldn't say whether we would file a 
felony. 
</P>
<P>
We would have to look at all the facts. It's a very serious situation for a 
corporation to have felony charges filed against them, so we don't take that 
lightly. On the other hand, neither do we take lightly what they do to our 
environment and community. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How do you decide between civil and criminal charges? 
</P>
<P>
A. Nolan: That's another very difficult evaluation. It's going to depend on 
culpability, on how egregious the conduct was, on the knowledge factor, on 
whether or not the officers and directors of the corporation were involved. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston: It's a difficult thing to quantify. You have to evaluate all the 
circumstances and do what you think is correct. 
</P>
<P>
Q. That seems like a pretty soft definition. There is a big difference between 
criminal and civil charges, and I would think there would be a more defined 
standard as to what is a criminal violation and what is not. 
</P>
<P>
A. Nolan: We look at every case from the aspect of filing criminally. That's 
what a prosecutors office does. We file criminally. If there is a lot of 
mitigating circumstance, such as a lack of knowledge, we may determine that 
it's better for the community and the corporation to handle the case civilly. 
Sometimes it may hurt the corporation more to go civil. But primarily we go 
criminal unless there is sufficient mitigation to go civil. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are some of the special difficulties involved in environmental 
prosecutions? You said these are often very complex and difficult cases. What 
makes them complicated? 
</P>
<P>
A. Kralick: The first problem is detection. When you have someone doing illegal 
disposal, it's the whole nature of illegal disposal to avoid detection in any 
way, shape or form. Then, even if you are detected, there is the question of 
who will be held ultimately responsible for that act. 
</P>
<P>
If you have an individual working for a company and operating a truck, and he 
just flushes the tanker (of hazardous material) in some vacant field, the 
question is whether he was acting under the authority and direction of some 
corporate officer, or just acting on his own to save time because he's running 
behind on his schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Then we have what you would have with any criminal case: lab reports, 
collection of the samples, preservation of the samples, analysis, getting the 
witnesses into court, and whatever is associated with any case. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston: In addition, there are complexities you wouldn't normally have. For 
one, the statutory framework is different. There is a large body of statutes 
and regulations that you wouldn't normally see. There are a lot of regulatory 
agencies that would potentially have jurisdiction, and that will require 
coordination to figure out who should be doing what. 
</P>
<P>
That's one reason we have the task force, to make sure all the proper 
authorities are in there and participating. To give an example: If we had a 
spill of solvents into the ground in a waterway, we might have the 
Environmental Management Agency, because it's a manmade waterway; the AQMD, 
because the solvents are evaporating into the atmosphere; the Health Care 
Agency, because it involves soil contamination; and the Regional Water Quality 
Board, because there is the potential that it could migrate into ground water. 
So there is a lot you have to think about any time these spills happen. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How much time do you spend on coordination? 
</P>
<P>
A. Kralick: We have an investigator, Kip Kinnings, who coordinates most of that 
for us. We're very lucky. He's very experienced, and has been doing this for a 
number of years, and he has developed very good communication with all the 
different agencies, which helps us tremendously. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you do any kind of special training to handle these cases? 
</P>
<P>
A. Nolan: When we enlarged the section, the deputies got together and decided 
it would be a good idea to go to classes at UC Irvine having to do with the 
regulatory framework, investigations and a series of other things. Also, the 
California District Attorneys Assn. puts on seminars, and recently they had a 
three-day seminar here in Garden Grove on environmental issues. In June, there 
will be an advanced seminar on environmental crime. It's a continual training 
process that we either do on our own or through the D.A.s' association. We're 
constantly learning. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Clearly, environmental crime is a rapidly growing field. Los Angeles Dist. 
Atty. Ira Reiner has made it a major priority in his office. How big a priority 
is it in this office? 
</P>
<P>
A. Nolan: In the last year, we have made it a bigger priority. Our district 
attorney, Mike Capizzi, has taken a great interest in this unit, allowed us to 
expand it with the deputies we have, and I've been told that if we need 
additional deputies to handle the workload, we certainly will get them. It's 
getting a lot of attention. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think you will need more deputies? 
</P>
<P>
A. Nolan: Absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you have an ideal size in mind? 
</P>
<P>
A. Nolan: You never know where it's going. As environmental crime gets more 
attention, as more people call in with information, as we get more information 
from other agencies, we could grow up to 25 or 30 deputies. Let's hope it 
doesn't get that big, because a lot of our work here is prevention. As we get 
the word out about what we're doing and how we're working, we're hoping 
corporations will comply with the rules and we won't be in a position to have 
to expand the unit.

<DATELINE>ALVARADO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Santa Fe freight train derailed Friday
in a remote region in north-central Texas and two police officers
were overcome with fumes from spilled chemicals.
   None of three people aboard the train, heading from Louisiana to
Fort Hood in Killeen, was injured when 13 cars derailed near
Alvarado.
   Two Alvarado officers were treated at a hospital as a
precautionary measure after breathing chemical fumes and were later
released, said police Sgt. Gerald Tucker.
   A state Department of Public Safety dispatcher said two
chemicals spilled from the derailed cars. The amount and types of
chemicals spilled was not immediately known.
   ``There is hazardous material involved in the cars that are
derailed,'' said Ken Jure, an assistant superintendent for Santa Fe
railroad.
   Fire officials said the spill posed no danger to residents.
   A portion of the train in front of the derailment was carrying
military equipment, including tanks and other equipment, to Fort
Hood, officials said.

<P>
The fireworks' color palette is created by using precise amounts of chemicals 
mixed with the explosives. Blues, for example, are obtained by using copper, 
Strontium salts make the red colors, calcium makes orange and sodium makes 
yellow. Since World War II, organic compounds of chlorine have been mixed with 
the explosive to make the color burn brighter. The sparkling effects are 
created by using metals, such as iron or magnesium, which burn brightly when 
placed in an explosive mixture.

<HEAD>Group Says Toxic Spills on Railroads Up 13 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spills of toxic materials on railroads rose by
13 percent in 1988, but highway incidents dropped, a private group
reported Wednesday.
   Citizen Action, citing statistics from the Transportation
Department, said there were 1,015 toxic spills on railroads last
year, the most since the department started keeping track of such
incidents in 1982.
   An industry representative, however, disputed the significance of
many of the spills cited by Citizen Action and accused the group of
trying to ``cloud railroad safety.''
   There were no deaths linked to the spills, but they caused nine
major injuries and 27 minor ones and resulted in $2.4 million in
damage, Citizen Action said.
   Texas led the nation with 151 incidents, followed by Ohio, 64;
Illinois, 59, and Georgia, 55, the group said.
   ``This growing list of railroad catastrophes and
near-catastrophes is no aberation,'' Citizen Action said. ``Rather,
it is the inevitable consequence of the increased reliance on the
rail transport of toxic chemicals, explosives, combustibles,
caustics and other hazardous materials.''
   The totals included small spills that may have been related to a
broken valve on a rail car or other faulty equipment, said Robert
Creamer, a Citizen Action spokesman.
   There were 4,831 highway incidents in 1988, a drop from 4,932
recorded in 1987, Citizen Action said.
   The Transportation Department data are based only on incidents
reported to the government ``and as a consequence (are) very
conservative,'' the group said.
   But Jim Reiter, a spokesman for the Association of American
Railroads, said many of the spills counted by Citizen Action were
small and occurred in rail yards. He said there were 44 major train
accidents that caused spills, down from 50 in 1987.
   Railroad companies moved 1.4 million carloads of hazardous
materials last year, he said.

TOXIC SPILL CLOSES STREET FOR 2 HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A toxic chemical spill closed a half-mile stretch of Madero south of Los Alisos 
Boulevard for two hours Thursday, but no one was injured or evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
Two 4-liter glass bottles of highly flammable liquid dichloromethane broke open 
at 12:40 p.m. in the trailer of a truck, which was delivering the chemical to a 
nearby light industrial complex, Orange County Firefighter Terry Gorgen said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the Motor Cargo of Montebello truck called 911 and the Orange 
County Fire Department's Hazardous Materials team, three engine companies and 
seven Orange County sheriff's deputies responded, Gorgen said. 
</P>
<P>
The spill was confined to the truck. 
</P>
<P>
Gorgen said dichloromethane is used in organic chemistry and in paint solvents. 
Besides being explosive, it can cause respiratory distress, vomiting and burns, 
he said.

   Firefighters nationwide need a better system
for notifying them of hazardous materials so they can prevent
accidents such as the one that killed six Kansas City, Mo. firemen
last year, a House panel was told Wednesday.
   ``They had no warning that the fire they were trying to
extinguish was a time bomb waiting to take their lives,'' said Terry
Conroy, president of the Kansas City chapter of the International
Association of Firefighters.
   At a hearing before a House Government Operations subcommittee,
Conroy, other firefighting officials and several members of Congress
said that accident pointed to the need for tighter and more
coordinated regulation of hazardous materials as well as improved
training for firemen.
   The Kansas City firefighters were killed when a trailer loaded
with tons of blasting agent exploded at a highway construction site
Nov. 29. Lawmakers were told that a dispatcher warned the
firefighters that explosives might be in the area but was unable to
provide the specific location or the type of hazardous material
involved.
   Most of the criticism was directed at the regulatory system
spread among a host of federal agencies as well as state and local
governments.
   Current laws have created ``tremendous duplication and confusion
and, at the same time, leave gaping voids,'' said John Eversole,
commander of the Chicago fire department's hazardous incident team.
   Lawmakers were told that current ``right-to-know'' laws were
inadequate and that many companies do not comply with requirements
to report chemicals and other hazardous materials to fire
departments and other emergency planning agencies.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the employment and housing
subcommittee, suggested that Congress consider criminal penalties
for those failing to report hazardous materials.
   Rep. Alan Wheat, D-Mo., complained that the blasting agent in the
Kansas City accident was not on an Environmental Protection Agency
list of materials that must be reported to firefighters. Jim Makris,
an EPA official, said the agency would consider adding it to the
reporting requirement.

<DESCRIPT>  CHEMICAL; REGULATION; CONGRESS; RAILROAD  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  After a gas leak killed 3,500 people in Bhopal, India, in 1984, Congress
required local communities to plan for chemical accidents.;    But the law did
no good when a derailed tanker loosed 13,000 gallons of a pesticide into the
Sacramento River on July 14: Railroads are largely exempt; California created
"local" planning districts bigger than many states, and the rural county in
which the train derailed has no plan for handling hazardous materials.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  CHEMICAL RULES WERE DERAILED BEFORE TRAIN  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The result was confusion. In the crucial hours immediately after the
Southern Pacific tanker plunged 50 feet down an embankment and into the river,
officials from more than a dozen local and state agencies did not know what
was in the tanker, what its effects would be in water, how much had leaked out
or what to do about it.;    After officials learned that the soil fumigant
metam sodium could form a noxious cloud when mixed with water, they backed
away from the overturned tanker. But they didn't warn residents until the
first complaints about odors and itching eyes came in eight hours after the
derailment.;    "We are essentially without a response capability in the
county," said Terry Barber, an environmental health supervisor in Siskiyou
County, where the train derailed.;    As the deadly pesticide flowed toward
Lake Shasta, there was little Shasta County officials could do. Its
hazardous-materials team had been shrunk by budget cuts, they had little
warning and the pesticide was completely mixed into the river, like
"dissolving sugar in water," one official said.;    Community wasn't prepared;
   "I just know we had some confusion," said Banky Curtis, regional manager
for the Fish and Game Department, which was in charge of the response.;   
This wasn't how community planning was supposed to work. Passed in the shock
that followed Bhopal, the idea was to have local residents -- from the fire
chief to public-health officials to private citizens -- learn about the
chemicals used in their community and to develop a plan to prevent and respond
to accidents. Most users of hazardous chemicals -- from neighborhood swimming
pools to giant chemical plants -- have to report how much of each substance
they store and use.;    In some places, the law has helped spur changes. Many
swimming pools and water-treatment plants have switched from gaseous to
less-dangerous liquid chlorine, and are keeping less of the potentially lethal
chemical on hand. In New Jersey, residents toured a glass manufacturer and
recommended safety improvements.;    Railroads exempted from law;    But
Congress, under lobbying pressure, exempted railroads and truckers from the
law. Unlike swimming-pool owners, they don't have to tell emergency planners
what they are carrying through the community, and few planners have bothered
to ask.;    "The basic thing that this California spill illustrates is that
chemical shippers are shipping things around the country where local people
don't have the damnedest idea what it is," said Fred Millar, toxics director
of Washington, D.C.-based Friends of the Earth and an expert on uses of the
law.;    Appealing to the railroads on moral and political grounds, the local
planning group in Washington asked for -- and got -- lists of what materials
were moving through the capital, including ammunition, explosives, ammonia and
chlorine. Southern Pacific spokesman Mike Furtney said he doesn't know any
reason why the railroad wouldn't make similar information available in
California.;    Except no one has asked.;    Planning districts were few;   
Millar and others say that is because former Gov. George Deukmejian
effectively "sabotaged" the law by carving the nation's most populous state
into just six "local" planning districts.;    By contrast, New Jersey --
one-twentieth the size of California, with a quarter the population -- has 588
local planning districts. Kentucky -- a quarter the size with an eighth the
population -- has 120.;    The region covering the site of the derailment
stretches from the Oregon border to the suburbs of Sacramento, taking in 13
rural and often-remote counties. San Jose is in a region that stretches along
the coast from Oregon to Big Sur.;    "It's impossible for there to be
significant citizen oversight with a region that big and that diverse," said
Ted Smith, executive director of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition.;   
Aided by officials of the state Office of Emergency Services, officials in the
Shasta-Siskiyou region recently completed a new draft of their emergency
plan.;    Officials unsure of plan;    But none of the officials interviewed
knew what the plan said about chemical accidents in the Sacramento River. In
fact, they've shown little evidence of having talked to each other before the
accident.;    Dunsmuir is the town nearest the derailment, where residents
were urged to leave their homes for several days after the spill, but Police
Chief Dennis Salanti does not recall participating in any regional meetings,
and said the city has no written disaster plan.;    "I don't think any agency
has policy spelling out what steps need to be taken," Salanti said.;    But
David Zocchetti, hazardous-materials manager for the state Office of Emergency
Services, said the spill demonstrated the wisdom of Deukmejian's approach,
because the pesticide affected several counties.;    Under older state laws,
local governments already were tracking which companies used hazardous
materials, he said, adding that the six large regions allow rural counties to
pool their resources.;    "We thought the gap was a catastrophic incident that
involved multiple jurisdictions," he said.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Eight employees of a Palo Alto laser manufacturer were admitted to the
hospital today for respiratory problems or as a precautionary measure after
they inhaled fumes from an acid leak in their company's hazardous material
storage room.;    "It was a thick, cloudy orange color. I thought the whole
place was going to blow up. It was coming through the doors," said Richard
Dominguez, a facility person who said he was the first person to notice the
spill and immediately called his boss. "I told him we have a major spill
here," Dominguez said shortly after leaving the hospital at noon today.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  LASER FIRM ACID LEAK HOSPITALIZES 8 IN P.A.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The leak, which authorities on the scene believe may have been caused by a
chemical reaction inside a 55-gallon drum of nitric, phosphoric and chloric
acid, was reported by workers at Coherent Inc., on Porter Drive, at about 8
a.m. The acids are used as a cleaning mixture.;    "We heard the alarm, and we
saw the orange clouds of smoke coming out of the vents. We evacuated calmly,"
said Joe Bouchard, a laser technician at Coherent. "We have evacuation drills
every few months, so there was no panic at all.";    Nine buildings in a
quarter-mile radius of the company in southeast Palo Alto were evacuated,
including a nearby Hewlett-Packard plant. Firefighters believed the buildings
would be closed off for at least part of the day while authorities relieve the
pressure inside the drum and safely transfer the chemicals to another drum to
be taken to a treatment center.;    All eight were being treated at Stanford
University Medical Center. A hospital spokeswoman who talked to doctors
treating the eight said the most serious injury was to one man listed in fair
condition with respiratory problems. The seven others are all listed in good
condition. There were no burns, and all were indirectly exposed to fumes, the
spokeswoman said.;     Three Palo Alto fire engines responded to the accident
in Stanford Research Park, as well as the hazardous materials teams from Palo
Alto and Santa Clara County.  </TEXT>

PLANT FIRE TRIGGERS SPILL OF CONTAMINATED WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 2,500 gallons of water that was mixed with potentially hazardous 
chemicals flooded a city street Tuesday morning after a fire in a metal plating 
firm triggered an automatic sprinkler system that failed to shut off, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out about 6 a.m. at Omni Metal Finishing Inc., a metal plating 
firm in an industrial complex at 11665 Coley River Circle, according to Fire 
Capt. John Williams. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze started in a tank of nickel sulfate, William said, and then spread to 
a nearby nitric acid tank. The sprinkler system doused the flames but did not 
shut off, causing the tanks to overflow and sending contaminated water out onto 
Coley River Circle and then Newhope Street. 
</P>
<P>
Several businesses in the area were closed for about an hour as hazardous 
materials response teams cleaned up the spill. The area was cleared by 1:30 
p.m. No one was injured in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the spill was "relatively harmless" as long as no one walked in 
or ingested the chemicals. Williams said damage was estimated at $45,000 to the 
building and $20,000 in cleanup costs.

Two 55-gallon drums filled with an ether-based substance fell off a chemical 
truck in Irvine this morning, forcing authorities to close off the intersection 
at Von Karmen and McGaw avenues and evacuate two businesses, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Fire Department spokeswoman Kathleen Cha said passers-by 
discovered the drums, which were leaking into a flood control channel, about 
9:45 a.m. The drums fell off a truck from Cypress Chemical Co., based in 
Anaheim, Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
Two hazardous materials teams and a fire engine company were sent to the scene 
to identify the chemicals and stop the spill in the largely industrial and 
commercial area. 
</P>
<P>
Cha said that "because it is open air and because there are no winds," the 
situation appeared to be under control. The ether-based substance is moderately 
combustible and causes skin irritation, Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials also advised area businesses to shut off air-conditioning units 
to prevent fumes from entering buildings. No injuries were reported.

All cities in Orange County have adopted the minimum required by the Uniform 
Building Code, a 900-page document from the International Conference of 
Building Officials that sets forth regulations to make buildings safe. 
</P>
<P>
Amendments to the UBC spell out classifications for degrees of roof fire 
retardancy, rated on a measure of flame spread. Class A is most resistant to 
fire, such as concrete or clay tile and even wood shakes or shingles that have 
</P>
<P>
been pressure-treated with a flame-retardant chemical. Class B includes asphalt 
shingles. Class C includes composition shingles or any materials of 
non-combustible construction, as tested according to the fire code. 
</P>
<P>
Further amendments currently in the draft stage, if approved by individual 
cities, will become effective Jan. 1, 1990.

<LEADPARA>  The deadly herbicide that poured from a derailed Southern Pacific tanker car
into the Sacramento River was being shipped by the book, state and federal
regulators say.;    But the book didn't require the tank car to be labeled,
meaning little was known about its 19,500 gallons of chemicals in the hours
immediately after Sunday's accident. The chemical -- metam sodium -- is not
listed in the federal hazardous materials guide commonly used by emergency
crews. And the manifest describing the train's contents merely labeled the
chemical "weed killer," said Southern Pacific spokesman Mike Furtney.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Everybody assumes there is somebody minding the store, but there isn't
anybody minding the store," said Fred Millar of the Washington-based
environmental group Friends of the Earth.;    No warnings required;  The
tanker car did not have to display special warnings required of toxic
materials, said Claire Austin, a spokeswoman for the Federal Railroad
Administration, one of several agencies investigating Sunday's accident.
That's because the chemical -- which sent 190 people to hospitals and left the
river littered with dead fish -- isn't classified as "hazardous" by either the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or the railroad administration.;    "It
was not considered a high-risk item after it was tested," Austin said. "I have
a feeling after this accident they will go back and retest it.";    Emergency
crews had little to go on when they arrived at the scene. State and federal
officials Tuesday were at a loss to explain why the chemical was omitted from
the U.S. Department of Transportation's Hazardous Materials Commodities Code,
which emergency crews rely on when they arrive at a spill.;    Southern
Pacific said the lack of informational placards on the tanker and the fact
that the chemical was not in the guide apparently delayed initial cleanup
efforts.;    Railroad workers could not immediately inspect damage to the
tanker because local fire authorities and California Fish and Game officials
were afraid to let anyone near the unmarked rail car.;    Asked whether clear
markings on the tankers could have expedited the emergency response, Southern
Pacific spokesman Bob Hoppe said: "It might have. Maybe they would have
reacted differently.";    Six cars of a 97-car train, pulled by four
locomotives, derailed at 9:50 p.m. Sunday. It was nearly an hour before crew
members were able to call the state Office of Emergency Services, as required
by law. Furtney said the delay was reasonable given the remote location of the
accident site. State Public Utilities Commission officials, responsible for
enforcing rail regulations in California, declined to characterize the
railroad's response.;    "To be quite honest with you, the rail carriers in
the state are a lot better off than they were two years ago," said Jack Rich,
supervisor of Railroad Operations and Safety Section for the PUC.;    Even
before the spill, the PUC was preparing to pass requirements that railroads
submit emergency response plans to the agency and immediately notify local
authorities of any spills. Now, Assemblyman Stan Statham, R-Redding, and other
legislators will hold an inquiry in Redding on Saturday to determine whether
toxic transportation laws need to be improved.;    "If they met all the
requirements, then clearly the requirements are inadequate," Statham said.  </TEXT>

A 250,000-gallon sewage spill Wednesday at a regional treatment pant in 
Fountain Valley flooded several major streets, prompted health authorities to 
quarantine an eight-mile stretch of beach and caused raw effluent to cascade 
into basement dressing rooms at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities at the Fountain Valley Treatment Plant said they were unsure what 
caused sewage to begin backing up at the sprawling processing facility, sending 
waste sloshing out of manholes to cover nearby streets at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
All systems at the plant were back to normal an hour later, but the sewage had 
by then spilled into storm drains leading to the Santa Ana River and flowed 
into the ocean, said Blake Anderson, technical services director for the 
Sanitation District of Orange County, operators of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
"The good news is there's no sewage spilling right now," Anderson said 
Wednesday night. "But we're baffled. We're still trying to locate the cause of 
the backup." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County officials, concerned about potential health problems, shut down a 
stretch of beach fanning out from the mouth of the Santa Ana River. Beaches 
between Newport Pier on the south and Beach Boulevard in Huntington Beach on 
the north will be posted with signs warning against swimming in the ocean, 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipated rain and storm-driven surf should help dissipate the sewage, and 
the quarantine will probably last only a few days and no longer than a week, he 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Health officials will begin taking bacterial counts of the surf beginning today 
to determine when the beaches should be reopened, Anderson said. County health 
officials could not be reached for comment on the sewage spill. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a health hazard for anyone who swims the ocean off the quarantine 
area," Anderson said. "People should stay out of the water until the health 
department reopens those sections of beach." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Ron Manda of the Fountain Valley police said officers began receiving 
reports shortly after 5:30 p.m. of flooding on several streets surrounding the 
sewage plant, located just south of the San Diego Freeway and west of the Santa 
Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous motorists plowed through huge pools of sewage stretching from sidewalk 
to sidewalk along Euclid Street and Ellis Avenue. Sewage also poured from 
manholes just across the river from the plant, flooding a short stretch of 
California Street. 
</P>
<P>
Police later shut down all three streets for several hours, authorities said, 
as well as the San Diego Freeway's southbound exit at Euclid Street. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said 16 cleanup crews on tanker trucks were dispatched by the sewage 
plant Wednesday night to wash the effluent down storm drains with a mix of 
water and disinfectant. Rains should also help wash down the streets. Any 
remaining sewage puddled on the streets would not not represent a health threat 
to motorists or residents of surrounding neighborhoods, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Bryant, a spokesman for the Performing Arts Center, said the problem at 
the plant caused sewage to back up and spew out of floor drains in the concert 
hall's basement, which houses more than a dozen dressing rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Center employees had to rush to mop up the flowing sewage and rescue several 
elaborate costumes for the opera "La Traviata," which has a performance 
tonight. Bryant said none of the costumes was damaged and he expects the 
dressing rooms to dry out in plenty of time for the show. 
</P>
<P>
Workers discovered the effluent cascading from the floor drains about 5:30 
p.m., just as they were leaving for the evening. Several maintenance employees 
used squeegees to push the foul-smelling waste water into a sump that pumped it 
into the city storm drain. 
</P>
<P>
Within an hour, the sewage crested at about an inch or two, then began to 
recede, leaving little more than patches of soggy carpet in the dressing rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Although no performance was in progress when the effluent began pumping into 
the basement, about 50 young children from the Turandot Children's Choir were 
practicing at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"It totally stunk really bad," said Melissa Wyatt Trutz, 11, of Laguna Niguel. 
"We had to hold our noses." 
</P>
<P>
Brent Woods, also 11, agreed that "it sure stunk." The Irvine youth and his 
friends in the choir had no idea what was happening until they saw a sign in 
the bathroom that read "Don't Flush."

<LEADPARA>  A Santa Clara-based defense contractor has agreed to pay $35,575 in penalties
for improper storage of hazardous materials, in a settlement made public
Friday by the district attorney's environmental protection unit.;    The fine,
which was negotiated with attorneys for Avantek Inc., is the largest penalty
that local prosecutors have collected for a case of this type, said Deputy
District Attorney William Richmond.  </LEADPARA>

STORAGE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The case stems from an episode last May in which chemicals were mixed
improperly in several barrels that were stored at the Avantek manufacturing
plant at 3175 Bowers Ave. When the chemicals -- trichloroethane, Freon,
aluminum chips and lubricating oil -- reacted with each other, they released
hydrogen gas, according to Rich Peterson, deputy fire marshal for the city of
Santa Clara.;    There was no explosion or fire, and no one was injured.
Authorities said the company itself reported the incident.;    A company
executive said the episode was inadvertent. Avantek employees were able to
dispose of the chemicals properly, but they called the fire department because
they are required to do so under state law, said Steve Allan, Avantek's chief
financial officer.;    Authorities said Avantek has been cited previously for
violating hazardous-materials regulations, but Allan characterized the
problems as technical violations. "We've never had a real spill," he said.;   
Avantek makes microwave components for radar and communication systems. Some
of its products are being used by U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf.  </TEXT>

   Walt Disney World has handled
hazardous waste materials in a sloppy and potentially dangerous
way, the state Department of Environmental Regulation reports.
   The DER told the company it would be fined $174,399 unless it
can show that the violations are not as serious as the state agency
contends.
   ``It looks as if they (Disney supervisors) do not have good
control of their hazardous waste,'' said George Gionis, enforcement
section manager for DER's Central Florida district.
   A two-day inspection of the 43-square-mile tourist attraction in
January found nine violations, seven classified as major. The DER
wants the company to test for possible groundwater contamination in
two of the nine areas inspected.
   Disney spokesman John Dreyer said Thursday the company had
``always tried to comply with DER regulations, and we will make
whatever improvements are deemed necessary.''
   The inspection was conducted after the DER received an anonymous
complaint.
   Much of the criticism involved a maintenance yard in the Epcot
Center section, where toxic paints, solvents, pesticides and other
chemicals are stored.
   The DER described the maintenance yard as an ``uncontrolled,
unsupervised, unmanaged and unposted site.''
   State inspectors said they found steel drums stored
indiscriminately and filled with waste and unknown chemicals. Many
drums were unlabeled, rusty, open or lying on their sides, with
their contents running off a concrete slab where they could
contaminate groundwater.
   There were no precautions to guard against fires, explosions or
spills, the inspectors said.
   Such dangers, plus a possible contamination of groundwater,
``could threaten human health or the environment,'' according to
the report.
   Inspectors found only one employee that had received training in
handling the materials, and the DER asked that Disney set up a
training course on hazardous-waste management.
   The park passed similar inspections in 1984 and 1985. No
inspections were made in 1986 or 1987. In 1981 and 1983, it was
cited for minor violations.
   Disney officials have 10 days to meet with the regulatory agency
to set up a plan for correcting violations and negotiate penalties.
It could take months or even years to make some of the changes
requested, Gionis said.

<HEAD>Authorities Plan Test Of Powerful Chemicals; Vaidogubsky Returns</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Exxon and government scientists said
Friday they plan to test-spray an oily island beach with powerful
sludge-thinning chemicals because weeks of scouring have failed to
clean Alaska's oily shores.
   Oil industry executives also announced that they have renewed
the $15,000-a-day contract for the Soviet vessel Vaidogubsky, a
state-of-the-art oil skimmer that will be on standby near the
entrance of Prince William Sound as a backup in case of spills.
   The use of chemical oil thinners, or dispersants, drew immediate
criticism from the environmental group Greenpeace.
   ``It creates more of a hazard than it's worth,'' said Cindy
Lowry, a Greenpeace spokeswoman. ``Right now, it seems a pretty
risky thing to try. There are so many important pupping areas for
harbor seals. This is not the right time to do it. I don't think
they are that controlled, either.''
   Exxon, under the orders of Coast Guard Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins,
is developing a plan to test the dispersants on Ingot Island beach,
a heavily fouled area of Prince William Sound. Scientists hope to
thin the taffylike crude enough to float it away in the current,
then allow it to decompose naturally. In some areas, the oil has
the consistency of asphalt.
   Robbins said other land cleanup methods, including hot- and
cold-water washing of the rocky shores, had proven futile. ``I'm
not hot on dispersants, but I think we've got to look at it,'' said
Robbins, the on-site commander of the oil cleanup.
   Earlier testing of dispersants proved inconclusive shortly after
the oil spill March 24, when the Exxon Valdez tanker slammed into
Bligh Reef and poured about 10.9 million gallons of crude through
its ripped hull.
   The National Transportation Safety Board has scheduled hearings
next week in Anchorage to investigate the cause of the accident.
The fired skipper of the tanker, Joseph Hazelwood, 42, of
Huntington, N.Y., faces trial June 20 in Valdez on charges that
include operating the vessel while intoxicated.
   The 11,400-ton, 450-foot-long Vaidogubsky was involved in the
oil cleanup under a monthlong contract with Exxon. But the ship's
high-tech pumping and dredging equipment frequently jammed on the
hardened crude, or ``mousse,'' formed by buffeting from winds and
waves, and Exxon did not renew the contract.
   But Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the oil industry's jointly
owned company that manages the trans-Alaska oil pipeline, hired the
ship through the end of May as ``standby backup,'' said Alyeska
spokesman Tom Brennan. ``It will be assigned to the tanker waiting
area south of Valdez. When tankers can't come directly into port
because of heavy traffic, they wait out there.''
   He said the vessel ``would provide extra protection'' in case of
another spill.
   Exxon has proposed cleaning some 364 miles of shore inside
Prince William Sound and southwest from Valdez along the Alaska
coast. The company, which has spent about $100 million on the
cleanup to date, said it will have 5,000 beach cleanup workers in
place by midsummer.
   Much of the oil that has reached land has been pounded into the
shore by wave and tide action, Robbins said, and the buried crude
does not dissipate.
   ``The oil trapped in the subsurface is not weathering at all,''
he said.
   The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation said the
methods used to clean the beaches to date ``are not efficient at
removing this oil which is trapped in the soil ... or trapped
within the shoreline sediment. More effective methods need to be
used.''
   Legislation creating a state commission to investigate the Exxon
Valdez spill and to increase spill fines to up to $50 a gallon were
signed into law Friday by Gov. Steve Cowper. He also signed a bill
that imposes stricter liability laws on companies responsible for
ol and hazardous material spills.
   The ``spill bills'' were the first to become law since the Exxon
Valdez ran aground.
   ``These new laws are a first step in making sure another Exxon
Valdez incident never happens,'' Cowper said in a news release.
``They also send a signal to the oil industry that it's going to
have to improve its performance or face some serious consequences.''
