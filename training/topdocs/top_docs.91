   Honda plans to increase its exports of
American-made cars from 12,000 this year to 70,000 in 1991, a move
that some analysts see as an effort to enter the European market.
   Honda of America Mfg. Inc. expects to export 50,000 cars to Japan
that year and 20,000 to other countries not yet specified, company
spokesman Roger Lambert said. Honda earlier this year began
exporting U.S.-built two-door Accord Coupes to its home country.
   The Accord Coupe is produced only at the Marysville plant, about
35 miles northwest of Columbus in central Ohio.
   Europe would be a likely market for Honda of America to
penetrate, John Franck, an analyst with Provident National Bank in
Philadelphia, said Wednesday. American companies stand to benefit
from lowered economic trade barriers that would result from the
merger of Europe into a single market by 1992.
   ``Where else would you go with them?'' Franck said. ``There are
no barriers for American exports in Europe in 1992 that I know of.''
   Under the current system, American companies are faced with
differing regulations in each of the 12 countries in the European
Community.
   Franck said the export of Hondas serves the company's auto supply
needs in Japan but also ``is an attempt to diffuse the idea of
shipping to Europe. They have been evasive in that area.''
   Lambert said Honda of America does not yet know which countries
to target for its 1991 exports.
   Maryann Keller, an analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz &amp; Birney
of New York City, also said Honda would be interested in the
European market.
   ``The specter of American-made Japanese cars is something that
the Europeans would find to be very paranoid about,'' she said.
``Who wants to have more competition?''
   Honda of America has been exporting motorcycles to world markets,
including Europe, since 1980. It also exports four-door Accord
sedans to Taiwan and Canada. The company plans to ship 4,500 cars to
Canada and 1,500 to Taiwan this year.
   Honda, the fourth-largest automaker in the United States, expects
to ship 6,000 Accord Coupes to Japan by the end of this year, up
from its original estimate of 4,000.
   Lambert said there has been strong demand for the car, with
orders for 2,000 Accord Coupes when the initial load of 540 cars
arrived last April. He said the cars aroused curosity in dealers and
customers.
   ``They asked, will these cars be as good as the cars that come
out of Japan?'' he said. ``When the first cars arrived, they were
put under the microscope ... and they were very well-received.''
   In Japan, the Coupe sells for 2.6 million yen, about $21,300 at
current exchange rates. A comparable car sells for $11,650 to
$15,300 in the United States, depending on equipment.
   Toshiaki Mishiba, a Honda dealer in Tokyo who has sold about 30
of the Coupes since April, said Japanese are attracted to the
left-side steering wheel in the U.S.-made Honda. Japanese cars have
the steering wheel on the right side.
   ``It gives Japanese an American feeling combined with confidence
in Honda's quality,'' Mishiba said. ``With its leather seats,
aluminum wheels and (American-made) Bose stereo system, it's
relatively cheap, about 300,000 yen ($2,500) less than a comparable
car sold in Japan.''
   Ms. Keller said the Accord Coupe, a new model this year, must
prove it is a well-made car that retains its value if the company is
to reach its export growth goals.
   ``The Japanese customer may very well be buying this car this
year because it's new, it's different. It has its badge of
distinction,'' Ms. Keller said.
   Honda began manufacturing in the United States in September 1979
with a motorcycle plant at Marysville. The auto plant at Marysville
began production of the Accord four-door sedan in November 1982, and
an engine plant at Anna in western Ohio started production in July
1985.
   The Civic four-door sedan was added to production at Marysville
in July 1986, and production of Civic engines began at Anna two
months later.
   Near the Marysville operation, Honda is building a new assembly
plant that is scheduled to begin production of Civic four-door
sedans in the fall of 1989.

   The one millionth automobile produced by
Honda in the United States will roll off the assembly line Friday,
Honda officials announced Wednesday.
   The car, a Honda Civic four-door sedan, will be driven off the
assembly line by the first associate hired at Honda of America
Manufacturing in 1978, Al Kinzer. Honda refers to its employees as
associates.
   Honda said the production of its one millionth car in the United
States signifies rapid growth and customer acceptance of the
products made at the company's auto assembly plant in Marysville,
about 35 miles northwest of Columbus in central Ohio, and at its
engine plant in Anna in western Ohio.
   The car's engine, a 16-valve, four-cylinder fuel-injected
powerplant, was made at the engine plant.
   Kinzer was hired as manager of administration when Honda started
operations at Marysville in 1978. He now is plant manager of the
engine plant.
   Honda is the nation's fourth-largest car company in sales and
manufacturing. It began manufacturing in the United States in
September 1979 with production at its motorcycle plant in
Marysville.
   The auto plant at Marysville began production in November 1982.
The engine plant at Anna opened in July 1985.
   The company last month broke ground for a new assembly plant
near its Marysville operation. The new plant, called the East
Liberty Auto Plant, will make Civic four-door sedans.
   Honda, the first Japanese automaker to build cars in the United
States, employs about 5,900 people at its auto, motorcycle and
engine plants in Ohio, said Honda of America spokesman Roger F.
Lambert.

   Demand in Japan for American-made Hondas
has been so strong that the company says it has increased production
to satisfy orders for the autos, which it began exporting to its
home country earlier this year.
   Honda, the fourth-largest automaker in the United States, will
ship 6,000 two-door Accord Coupes to Japan by the end of this year,
up from its original estimate of 4,000, according to Roger Lambert,
a spokesman for Honda of America Mfg. Inc.
   Lambert said Tuesday that the first shipment, which arrived in
Tokyo last spring, aroused curiosity among Japanese dealers and
customers. There were orders for 2,000 Accord Coupes when the
initial load of 540 cars was shipped.
   ``They asked, will these cars be as good as the cars that come
out of Japan?'' he said. ``When the first cars arrived, they were
put under the microscope...and they were very well-received.''
   ``Reports continued to come back that orders were pouring in and
that any increase in production would be welcome,'' he said.
   Few Honda dealerships in Japan have the Accord Coupe on display,
primarily because they lack showroom space and because of the
one-month delivery time for the car, said Toshiaki Mishiba, a Honda
dealer in Tokyo. Of the six dealerships in Tokyo that belong to
Honda Daiichi Sales, Mishiba's is the only one displaying the car.
   In Japan, the Coupe sells for 2.6 million yen, about $21,300 at
current exchange rates. A comparable car sells for from $11,650 to
$15,300 in the United States, depending on equipment.
   Mishiba, who has sold about 30 of the Coupes since April, said
Japanese buyers are attracted to the left-side steering wheel in the
U.S.-made Honda. Japanese cars have the steering wheel on the right
side.
   ``It gives Japanese an American feeling combined with confidence

   Maryann Keller, an analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz &amp; Birney
of New York City, said that although the U.S.-made Hondas were
selling well in Japan, the auto must prove it is a well-made car
that retains its value if the company is to reach its export growth
goals.
   ``The Japanese customer may very well be buying this car this
year because it's new, it's different. It has its badge of
distinction,'' Ms. Keller said.
   Honda will export a total of 12,000 cars this year, including
4,500 Accord four-door sedans to Canada and 1,500 of the same car to
Taiwan, Lambert said. The company hopes to export 70,000 U.S.-made
cars by 1991, including 50,000 to Japan, he said.
   In comparison, General Motors Corp. plans to export 80,000
vehicles worldwide by the end of the year, Ford Motor Co. 42,000 and
Chrysler Corp. 55,000.
   Lambert said Honda plans to export about the same number of
Accord Coupes in 1989 as it exports this year. The car is produced
only at the Marysville plant, about 35 miles northwest of Columbus
in central Ohio.
   Honda began manufacturing in the United States in September 1979
with a motorcycle plant in Marysville. The auto plant at Marysville
began production of the Accord four-door sedan in November 1982, and
an engine plant at Anna in western Ohio started production in July

   The first U.S.-made Accords shipped to Japan arrived there April
8, the same day Honda of America's one millionth car rolled off the
Marysville assembly line.
   Honda, which holds 3.5 percent of the world auto market, expects
to produce 360,000 cars at its Marysville plant this year.
   The Civic four-door sedan was added to production at Marysville
in July 1986, and production of Civic engines began at Anna two
months later.

<TEXT>
   Honda celebrated two milestones Friday
when its one millionth U.S.-produced car rolled off the assembly
line and its first exported cars rolled onto a dock in Japan.
   A Civic four-door sedan was driven off the assembly line at
Honda of America Manufacturing's auto plant in his central Ohio
city, becoming the one millionth American-made car since Honda
started building cars in the United States in November 1982.
   Halfway around the world, a shipload of 540 Honda Accords built
at the Marysville plant arrived in Tokyo, ending a monthlong
journey that started on March 7 from Portland, Ore.
   The one millionth car was driven by Al Kinzer, who became Honda
of America's first employee when he was hired as manager of
administration in 1978. Honda calls its employees associates.
   ``We owe our ability to produce 1 million cars in such a short
period of time to the teamwork and efforts of our associates,''
said Kinzer, now vice president and plant manager of Honda's engine
plant in Anna in western Ohio. ``They have proven that Honda
quality knows no geographical boundaries.''
   The arrival of the Honda Accords signaled an end to a voyage
that was interrupted when the ship's ballast tank and fuel tank
cracked during a storm in the northern Pacific Ocean on the third
day at sea. It returned to Portland and left again on March 17.
   In Tokyo, Honda spokesman Bret Anderson said the company does
not have facilities in Japan to build the American-made coupe.
   ``It was built for the U.S. market. We see the car as an
American car,'' he said.
   Honda is the nation's fourth-largest car company in sales and
manufacturing. It began manufacturing in the United States in
September 1979 with production at its motorcycle plant in
Marysville.
   Production at the Marysville auto plant began Nov. 1, 1982, with
the Accord four-door sedan. The Civic four-door sedan was added to
production on July 24, 1986.
   Production of the engine for the Civic began at Anna on Sept.
23, 1986.
   The company in February began construction for a new assembly
plant near its Marysville operation. The new plant, called the East
Liberty Auto Plant, is scheduled to begin production of Civic
four-door sedans in August 1989.

<HEADLINE>  THIS SANTA HAULS TOYS ON A HARLEY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Doc earned his being a paramedic.;   Bear, who is part Cree Indian, was
known as Standing Bear while growing up in Colorado. In the biker world, the
name was shortened to Bear.;   Bear is explaining the world of motorcycling
enthusiasts who band together through their interest in American-made bikes.
They are united, too, by unspoken creeds of helping each other and using their
word as their bond.;   A 53-year-old man whose right hand is covered with
silver and turquoise rings, Bear stands tall in the doorway of his leather
shop in Niles. A steady stream of customers and biker friends stop to talk.;  
With his flowing grayish-white beard and long wavy hair, he bears a strong
resemblance to Santa Claus.;   This weekend, Bear, whose given name is Don
Schurr, will close his shop to make toy runs along with scores of other East
Bay bikers, including members of the Niles-based Black Sheep club, of which
Bear is a charter member.;   Saturday, Bear will strap his donation -- a
large, cuddly brown bear with a stocking cap and red ribbon around its neck --
to the back of his Harley-Davidson and ride to Sunol on the fifth annual toy
run to benefit the Viola Blythe Foundation. The run is sponsored by the
Travelers Club.;   Sunday, he'll be off on another toy run. Riding amid his
"brothers," as he refers to his fellow bikers, he will head to Sacramento and
drop a toy truck and car carrier set into the bins on the steps of the state
Capitol. The U.S. Marines will be there taking holiday donations for needy
families.;   Bear has made toy runs for as long as he can remember. He
promotes them in his shop, on a table filled with literature about
motorcycling organizations and benefit programs.;   The Black Sheep, which he
helped found 18 months ago, has been collecting holiday donations for the past
three months to contribute this Friday at a dance in East San Jose for
American Indian children, sponsored by the Sioux Warrior Association.;   The
image of bikers as a charitable group runs counter to the stereotype, Bear
says, but the attitude of helping others is as central to the biker culture as
the black leather jackets they wear.;   "There's always somebody to lend a
hand," says Bear, who worked 27 years for Southern Pacific, 10 as a commuter
train conductor. He's been in the leather business for 35 years, operating a
leather shop in Fremont for more than two decades years.;   "I've worked so
many places, been lied to or cheated. But that seldom happens in the biker
world. I don't worry about people stabbing me in the back. Your word is your
bond. You go back on your word and you're shunned. You mess up, you lose a
lot.";   Bear makes a point of distinguishing between those who ride
motorcycles for recreation and those "who live, breathe and eat motorcycles.";
  "We ride Harleys, not those rice-burners," says Bear, making a reference to
Japanese-made motorcycles. "Personally, I don't care what anyone rides as long
as he's a straight arrow.";   During this interview, Bear receives dozens of
phone calls.;   Strictly business calls are in the minority. Some callers need
messages relayed. He walks down the street with his portable phone, trying to
pass on a message to call home.;   Then Bear consoles a woman who is upset
because the alcoholic she's been trying help stay stober has fallen off the
wagon.;   Bear admits he's somewhat of a counselor in his culture, a position
he has earned by his ability to adapt through personal crises. One of the
toughest was losing his second wife and son in the same year to cancer, about
11 years ago.;   "I guess my wife and I just knew what we were dealing with,"
says Bear, who is the father of eight children and grandfather of three.;  
"We are both Christians. We joked, even at the hospice in Hayward, about how
she wanted two little girls and now she was deserting me.;   "She told me,
'I'll never leave you because you've got our daughters and as long as you're
taking care of them, you're taking care of me and you won't forget me' -- and
that's the way it's been," Bear says.;   The trust others place in him and his
judgment comes as much from his ability to take care of himself and keep
others in line.;   Last week, six intoxicated young adults on the street were
causing a ruckus. He heard the noise and got a glimpse of what was happening.
He moved to the doorway of his shop.;   As the group walked by, they taunted
him and circled around him: "Hey, old man, we're going to kick you so hard and
whip you. Get back inside before we hurt you, old man . . .";   Bear grabbed
one of the young men by the shirt collar, pulled him close to him and breathed
into his face.;   "Now you die," Bear told the young man, who became so
frightened that he wet his pants.;   "I'm 53 years old and 240 pounds and I
got this way by being able to take care of myself.";   The next day, the young
men were in his shop, apologizing, Bear says.;   Now they stop in frequently
at the leather shop where Bear goes about his business of selling people on
the idea of helping others.  </TEXT>

More than 3,000 people saw the "Globe of Death" in Harley Heaven on Sunday at 
the San Buenaventura Antique and Classic Motorcycle Show, a celebration of 
black leather, tattoos and chrome. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 mostly British and American bikes were on display at the Ventura 
County Fairgrounds, ranging from a 1969 Harley-Davidson worth $800 to the Globe 
of Death, a 1908 Indian 500cc custom-made for a circus performer who rode it in 
circles inside a steel-framed sphere. 
</P>
<P>
As buffs took snapshots and praised the bikes' fuel pumps, chains and motors, 
the proud owners sat on beach chairs drinking beer, smoking Marlboros, eating 
beef jerky and listening to a rock band while taking in the sun. Many of them 
said their bikes were not for sale, only on display. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Dillman and David Weidner sat beside their bikes, a red, 1945 Indian 
Chief and a gray, 1955 Triumph, respectively. Like many other exhibitors, they 
said it would take a lot to get them to part with their machines. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just hanging out, looking at all the old bikes you wish you owned when 
you were a kid but couldn't afford to buy," Dillman said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hughes, 46, did make a purchase at the show, paying $11,000 cash for a 
maroon, 1947 Indian Chief, his first classic motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to collect something, it might as well be a toy you can have 
fun with while its value goes up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The collector who sold the bike could not be found. "He's got cash in his 
pocket, so you know he's shopping around," said Gary Ziegler, a friend of 
Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most valuable bikes at the show, a brown, unrestored 1942 Crocker 
1,000cc in mint condition, belonged to collector Gordon M. Clark. His was the 
last Crocker to come off of the assembly line before the factory closed, Clark 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Only two '42 Crockers were sold last year -- a wrecked one went for $50,000 and 
a good one for $100,000, said Clark. He said he owns more than 30 classic bikes 
and knows almost every bike collector in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Hansley, 40, who owns the "Globe of Death" bike -- a slender, 
unpretentious machine that looks like a sturdy bicycle with a small motor under 
the frame -- said it is one of only four ever built. His was made for a circus 
performer named C'Dora. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only one known to still exist, so anywhere around the world it would 
bring a lot of money," said Hansley, who sported a "Globe of Death" sweat shirt 
and matching baseball cap and vowed to never sell the motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
Hansley, a retired graphics designer from Pasadena who was paralyzed in a 
motorcycle racing accident 20 years ago, sat in his wheelchair with a broad 
smile as a parade of collectors came up to congratulate him on his find. 
</P>
<P>
Hansley, who no longer rides, said he spotted the dilapidated "Globe of Death" 
bike two years ago at a motorcycle show in Hershey, Pa. He bought it for just 
over $10,000, completely restored it and added it to his 24-bike collection. 
</P>
<P>
Event sponsor David Hansen said the Ventura show, which began two years ago, 
was a success and is quickly becoming one of the premier motorcycle exhibitions 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was particularly pleased with the variety and price range available 
to prospective collectors. Glancing at the relatively inexpensive '69 Harley, 
he said, "There's a collectors' item right there. Everything's collectible 
after enough time goes by."

<TEXT>     The Milwaukee-based manufacturer is a bit baffled by the sudden fascination
among foreigners with the big, bad bike.;   "We are totally hot right now.
It's really amazing," said Catherine Tenke of Harley's international marketing
department.;   In 1988, the company peddled 9,400 Harleys overseas, about 16
percent of its total $400 million in sales. Last year, it sold 16,000, nearly
30 percent of its $600 million in sales, she said.;   This year, the company
expects to sell about 20,000 bikes in its main export markets: Britain,
France, Australia, Japan and the largest foreign customer, Germany.;   BUT
WHAT the numbers don't describe is the Harley lifestyle made famous by old
biker flicks and now embraced by Europeans, for whom American pop culture is a
chief import.;   Last year, Klaus Schmitt was a balding, gray-haired limousine
driver. Today, he is a balding, gray-haired owner of a Heritage Classic, which
looks like a motorcycle on steroids.;   But Schmitt didn't just buy the bike.
He bought a black leather vest, a T-shirt that says "The Strong Survive" and a
gold hoop earring. He bought the lifestyle.;   "It's Hollywood. This is
history; this is a motorcycle with personality," said Schmitt, 47.;   Manfred
Kozlowsky, advertising manager for Western Europe, says he doesn't do much
advertising. Supply is meeting only 40 percent to 50 percent of demand, he
says.;   People who want Harleys sometimes wait six months, he said. Some
regularly stake out dealerships, waiting to catch the delivery truck and buy
crated bikes sight unseen.;    A TOP-OF-THE-LINE Harley sells for about
$16,500 in Germany. Dealers say a 10-year-old model will fetch its original
price, the demand is so great.;   "We're going to hold a press conference on
Sept. 25 to tell people worldwide why we can't meet demand. We can only guess
why this (demand) came about," Kozlowsky says.;   While Harley has always had
mystique, the bikes were eclipsed in the 1970s by Japanese motorcycles, which
were cheaper, faster, handled better and were much more reliable.;  
Harley-Davidson made a widely publicized turnaround in the early '80s,
improved quality substantially and regained U.S. dominance, albeit with the
help of tougher import rules.;   "People always wanted a Harley but didn't
dare buy one," Kozlowsky said. "You had to be some kind of mechanic. Now, no
screws fall off.";   Kozlowsky's division is making plans to open one
dealership each next year in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.;   Ken
Schmidt, a spokesman in Milwaukee, said Harley-Davidson's major goals are to
increase production capacity and substantially expand the overseas network,
where the growth is.;    HE SAID Europeans to a greater degree have embraced
the "outlaw biker" image the company does not particularly endorse.;   "Our
image has softened a lot in America. We attract a lot of upscale, white-collar
people. Riders in Europe tend to follow more of our '70s image.";   People
such as Manuel, 31, the only person allowed to speak for the Hells Angels
chapter that formed last year in Berlin. Its headquarters are in a red
building in a working-class neighborhood. A sign that says "The Angel Place"
hangs outside.;   For "security reasons," Manuel spoke on the condition his
last name not be used.;   "The Harley, it is difficult to say," he said. "It
means freedom. When someone asks you if you believe in God, you don't know
why, but you do. It is like that with Harley."  </TEXT>

FT  12 JUN 93 / Hog wild in Milwaukee: Bikers are celebrating more than a
90th birthday at Harley-Davidson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It will be Hog Heaven. About 60,000 leather-clad motor cyclists will rumble
into the US city of Milwaukee today to celebrate one of the greatest icons
of American popular culture - the Harley-Davidson motorcycle.
It is 90 years since the first crude Harley was assembled in the Davidson
family's Milwaukee backyard, and to mark the occasion convoys of bikers have
spent the past week riding their Harleys - which enthusiasts call 'hogs' -
to the city from every corner of North America.
Today they will party. By the shore of Lake Michigan they will eat, drink
and rock to the sounds of ZZ Top, a band whose members ride customised
Harleys known as Hogzillas.
Some of the aficionados will get married, taking their vows in a riot of
gleaming chrome and buffed leather on the front steps of that holy of
holies, the red brick Harley-Davidson headquarters building. The brides,
naturally, will wear black.
But this is much more than a birthday party. It will also celebrate the
revival of a company which 10 years ago seemed to be at death's door,
another example of an industry killed by competition from Japan.
Instead, Harley has beaten back rivals such as Honda, Kawasaki and Suzuki,
and its share of the US market for big bikes (over 850ccs) has risen to
about 60 per cent from a nadir of 23 per cent in 1983, even though the
overall market has dropped substantially during the decade.
Harley is starting to focus more on international sales, where it sees big
growth potential, since it has only 10 to 15 per cent of the market outside
America.
However, its machines are so popular in the US - despite often having a much
higher price tag than Japanese rivals - that the company cannot keep pace
with demand, even though it has more than doubled annual output over the
past six years to about 80,000 cycles. The bikes have to be painstakingly
rationed out among dealers, with only 30 per cent reserved for the export
market.
The turnaround is a case study in how western companies can take on the
Japanese and win, helped by a degree of protectionism, attention to quality,
employee involvement and, in Harley's case, clever marketing.
For the company is selling far more than a humble means of transport. It is
marketing a lifestyle - what executives refer to as 'the Harley experience'.
This blends images of macho, rebellious US individuality and personal
freedom - a Harley rider alone on the open road, somewhere in the vastness
of America - with down-to-earth group social events organised by the
company.
The Harley motto - 'Live to ride, ride to live ' - has an irresistible
appeal to many people trapped in humdrum jobs. Ageing baby boomers find
solace in the suggestion that a Harley engine contains the elixir of youth.
'A Harley-Davidson is ageless and timeless,' runs one advertisement. 'On it,
you cannot grow old.'
All this has helped the company broaden the appeal of its products beyond
the industry's traditional young, male, blue-collar customers to
professionals, the middle-aged, and women.
The average US owner, according to the company's market research, is 38,
married, with a household income of Dollars 43,000 a year. Some 20 per cent
of buyers are women. Harley maintains that Hell's Angels, one of the
company's most visible customer groups, make up only 1 per cent of the
total.
None of this recent marketing success would have been possible without the
particular mystique which has long surrounded Harley, making it seem the
serious biker's bike. This is partly to do with Harley's styling - raw, yet
glamorous - and partly with its V-twin engine, which gives out a distinctive
thump likened by some to the beat of the heart.
The image has been powerfully reinforced by Hollywood. Peter Fonda rode a
modified Harley in the classic 1960s road movie, Easy Rider. Arnold
Schwarzenegger mounted a Harley Fat Boy in Terminator 2: Judgement Day.
Still, the brand name was little help at the start of the 1980s, when
Harley's market share skidded because of quality problems. Its engines were
technologically primitive and tended to leak oil, while an attempt to expand
production rapidly meant half the machines coming off its assembly line had
missing parts.
In 1983, the loss-making business was sold by the then owner, the
conglomerate AMF, to its management, and many observers predicted early
bankruptcy.
However, the new team radically changed the way it made bikes, imitating
Japanese methods of quality control. Says Mr Jeffrey Bleustein, who heads
the motorcycle operations: 'It took us a while before we realised they (the
Japanese) were just better managers than we were.'
Harley also developed a more sophisticated engine, got government help (in
the form of tariffs on Japanese imports, lifted in 1987) and, in 1986, eased
its heavy debt burden with a public flotation.
Despite the surge in demand for its products, the company has been careful
to expand production gradually. Stung by poor quality once, it does not want
a repeat performance.
Unlike many consumer product companies, Harley concentrates most of its
marketing expenditure on customers after they have bought its machines. The
idea is to hook them for life on 'the Harley experience', buying more and
more expensive bikes when they trade their old ones in. The price range runs
from around Dollars 4,800 (Pounds 3,100) to more than Dollars 16,000.
Central to this was the formation of the Harley Owners' Group - Hog for
short - a club restricted to Harley buyers, which organises rallies and
charity fund-raisers.
It not only promotes a sense of exclusivity and purpose among owners, but
also gives the company valuable feedback on fashion trends among bikers, who
like to customise their machines with individual flourishes.
'The motorcycles are the canvas, the parts and accessories are the paint;
that's where everyone can express their individuality,' says Mr Jerry Wilke,
marketing chief.
A central figure at the rallies is Harley's head of design, Mr William
Davidson, known as 'Willie G', a grandson of one the company's founders. He
has been responsible for many of the company's most important model
innovations, such as the 1971 Super Glide with its extended front forks, and
the 1977 Low Rider, with its seat close to the ground.
Many bikers think he embodies the soul of the company. With his thick beard,
dark glasses and fringed leather jacket he looks the part. Fans often ask
him to carve his name with a screwdriver in the metal of their machines.
However, Harley's top executives are all keen bikers and are leading each of
the 90th anniversary convoys across country towards Milwaukee, raising money
for charity as they go. It is hard to get closer to the customer than that.
Another important marketing initiative has been to encourage Harley dealers
to transform their outlets from grimy workshops into attractive retail
outlets, selling not only bikes but a broad range of Harley brand
accessories, clothes and momentos, made by or licensed from the company.
Women can buy black Harley bathing suits, with the company name studded
across the front.
All this has transformed Harley's profits. It made Dollars 53.8m last year
on turnover of Dollars 1.1bn. Debt on the balance sheet is now negligible.
Next month it will mark a milestone on its return to financial health by
paying its first dividend since flotation.
The recent record, however, is not flawless. The company also owns Holiday
Rambler, which makes Recreational Vehicles - caravan-like trucks in which
Americans cruise around the continent. Holiday Rambler makes little money
(it lost Dollars 13m in 1991) and Wall Street would like Harley to sell the
business.
Industry observers are also a little edgy about the company's plan to expand
motorcycle production by 25 per cent by 1996 to 100,000 a year. Harley
insists that it will do so in a way which retains the quality of its bikes
and service, but the analysts note that it suffered hiccups recently with a
new paint plant.
Some also ask whether Harley's popularity, as well as a small upturn in the
US motorbike market in the past two years, could be a fad.
But Mr Richard Teerlink, the chief executive, although concerned about the
company growing arrogant, says confidently: 'This is a fad that has been
going on for a long time - 90 years.'

<TEXT>
   Honda Motor Co. Ltd. on Thursday
unveiled a station wagon version of its mid-sized Accord sedan, the
nation's best-selling car.
   The 1991 Accord Wagon, designed and engineered in the United
States, is the first mid-sized station wagon in the Honda line. It
began rolling off assembly lines Nov. 20 at the company's
Marysville plant, officials said at a briefing to introduce the
car.
   Although pointed primarily at the North American market, Honda
expects to export about 10,000 during the first production year,
said Thomas G. Elliott, executive vice president for automobile
sales.
   Elliott said he expects about 35,000 wagons to be sold in the
first year. He said between 4,000 and 5,000 will be marketed in
Europe and the rest in Japan and other Far East markets.
   Honda said the wagon is the first U.S.-made car the company will
export to Europe. It joins the Accord line of four-door sedans and
two-door coupes, also made at Marysville, about 35 miles northwest
of Columbus. Honda exports the Accord coupe to Asia.
   The Accord was the top-selling car in the United States last
year and is expected to be again this year when final numbers are
tallied. By adding a station wagon, the model could widen its
already substantial lead over the No. 2 seller, Ford Motor Co.'s
Taurus, which includes a station wagon version.
   Kurt Antonius, manager of public relations for Honda of America,
said the nation's station wagon sales declined sharply with the
introduction of the minivan in the mid-1980s, but is enjoying a
resurgence. He said the Honda wagon is expected to be a sport and
family vehicle.
   The wagon was designed at Honda's Torrance, Calif., facility and
engineered and tested at its central Ohio plant.
   Antonius said Honda's total sales through November were up 15
percent over 1989 and the Accord sedans and coupes will have 58
percent of the Honda market in 1990. Total Accord sales for 1990
are expected to be about 410,000 units, up from 380,000 in 1989.
   Elliott said the addition of the station wagon at Marysville
will not increase total production at the plant. Assembly of the
Civic is being shifted to Honda's new plant in East Liberty, less
than 10 miles away, and assembly of the station wagon will be mixed
with that of Accord's four-door and two-door coupe models.
   It will be available in two models - the 125-horsepower LX and
the 140-horsepower EX - both with a standard five-speed
transmission or the optional four-speed automatic. Both have
2.2-liter, four-cylinder engines.
   Depending on the model, the wagon will cost $17,300 to $19,800.
It also was expected to get 20 or 22 miles per gallon in city
driving and 26 or 27 miles a gallon on the highway, also depending
on the model.
   Base prices for the Honda wagon are higher than those of the
Taurus, which range from $15,629 to $19,128. The Honda is slightly
longer and narrower than the Taurus, but has a longer wheelbase.
   The announcement of the new car came as the nation's
fourth-largest automaker reported U.S. sales for the year running
15 percent ahead of last year. It said 676,981 Honda automobiles
were sold through November, compared with 589,090 at the same time
in 1989.
   Honda, the first Japanese automaker to build cars in the United
States, employs more than 9,000 people at four auto, motorcycle and
engine plants in Ohio.
   Honda began manufacturing in the United States in September 1979
with production at its motorcycle plant in Marysville.
   The auto plant at Marysville began production of the Accord in
November 1982, and an engine plant in Anna, in western Ohio, began
production in July 1985.
   The Civic four-door sedan was added to production at Marysville
in July 1986. Production of the engine for the Civic began at Anna
the same year.
   The company added an auto assembly plant near its Marysville
operation last year. The new plant, called the East Liberty Auto
Plant, makes Civic four-door sedans.

She's a motorcycle mama who rarely rides a motorbike. Still, even without her 
back to the wind, Ruth West comes about as close to the biker's life as a 
desk-bound artist can. 
</P>
<P>
As a free-lance fashion designer for a company that supplies clothing and gear 
to the motorcycle industry, West makes her own hours -- without bosses or time 
clocks -- creating designs for jackets, full-body suits, hats, gloves, pants 
and patches. The clothes are sold to such firms as Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki and 
Harley Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
A middle-aged mother of two ("Say I'm over 40; I always knock about 10 years 
off"), West began designing sportswear in 1965 after graduating from 
Philadelphia's Moore School of Art in fashion design. She started her career by 
launching her own ski wear design company, called Swing West. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, when day-glo colors and psychedelic designs began seeping into 
Middle America, West started creating ski outfits in bold, whimsical prints, 
which were featured in several fashion publications, including Women's Wear 
Daily. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where I really made my name, with wild ski overalls and graphic 
designs," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after she was asked by Ocean Pacific, an active-sportswear company based 
in Orange County, to develop a line of swimwear, outer-wear and sweaters. She 
has also designed sportswear for Adidas, Sears, Hobie and Union Bay. And she 
designs clothes for Germany's Hein Gericke line, imported by Intersport, which 
is the company that buys and distributes all of her motorcycle fashions. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those fashions may soon be seen in a retail store; Hein Gericke plans 
to open a shop called Speedwear in Orange County this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Switching from ski and surf wear to clothing for bikers was not a huge leap, 
West says. 
</P>
<P>
"I basically translated the ski look into motorcycle clothes," she says. "It 
was easy to take my experience with stretch fabrics and combine them with 
leather." 
</P>
<P>
West, who lives in Newport Beach, now concentrates mostly on motorcycle 
clothes. Her business is called Wild Wild West, and her ideas are hatched in a 
studio overlooking Newport Bay on Balboa Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Why motorcycle fashions? 
</P>
<P>
"Because nobody else is doing it," she says, pulling sketches out of a giant 
portfolio. "There are a lot of things I'd like to do. I'd like to be able to 
use some of the real forward fashion leathers, pearlized finishes, patent 
leather trims, more hardware, stretch fabrics and texture, more creative use of 
studs." 
</P>
<P>
West's styles are not of the outlaw variety: She doesn't sprinkle her designs 
with skulls and snakes or fringe the sleeves. Most of her pieces are 
traditional, long-sleeved leather jackets designed for comfort and speed. 
They're stylish and well-made in soft leathers and sturdy fabrics, the kind of 
no-nonsense clothes favored by serious riders. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some of her tops and pants sport wild colors sprinkled with silver 
studs. And although her clothes are sold exclusively through motorcycle 
dealerships, she envisions a day when biker styles hit the fashion big time and 
are merchandised in boutiques and department stores. 
</P>
<P>
With long, pink fingernails flying, she pulls out some of her jacket designs 
with bold graphics, electric colors and shimmering zippers. There is a lot of 
room to grow, she says, shaking her blonde hair to reveal large black-hoop 
earrings. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it, you're selling mostly to the Midwest, and those people are not 
very fashion-conscious," she adds. "I would love to design for people out here 
that ride for the style of it. That's a whole area that nobody's touched." 
</P>
<P>
West, who admits she likes to ride but doesn't own a bike, is drawn to the 
motorcycle world not only by the creative possibilities it offers her, but also 
by the freedom it symbolizes. She admires the independence of the biker's life 
-- it's the kind of niche she's carved out in her career. 
</P>
<P>
"I like my independence and individuality. I have a hard time working 9 to 5 at 
anything. I'd just as soon work in the middle of the night to get time off 
during the day." 
</P>
<P>
Like many motorcycle riders, West has had to negotiate some tricky byways. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been tough," she says. "You're always promoting yourself. You always have 
to worry about one job ending and filling the gap with another right away. It's 
the nature of this business. Even if you're full time, if the business falls on 
hard times, the designers are the first ones out the door." 
</P>
<P>
Another pitfall is age bias, she adds. 
</P>
<P>
"When you've been in the business for as long as I have you're competing with 
very young people, right out of school, who don't cost a lot. Employers don't 
realize the ones in the business are not making the mistakes the new ones are 
making; they already made them and have learned from them. There are economic 
advantages to hiring someone with experience. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't know what it's like competing with these young kids," she says. "Or 
you talk to a design director and he's about 25 and thinks you can't draw. You 
know, just because you get older doesn't mean you lose your eyesight or can't 
draw. It just means you're getting better."

   Harley.
   For decades, that name triggered images of burly bad boys
roaring down the highway on big black bikes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It was a mystique molded by popular culture and encouraged
by the manufacturer, Harley-Davidson Inc. So what if
leather-clad Marlon Brando didn't really ride a Harley in
"The Wild One," the 1954 movie about a motorcycle-gang
leader? People thought he did, and they hankered to hitch
along.
   Somewhere, though, the harum-scarum aura of tattooed
Hell's Angels and Easy Rider-era hippies became as much a
liability for Harley-Davidson as an asset. By the early
1980s, hurt by leaky, unreliable bikes and plunging market
share, the lone American motorcycle maker was brushing up
against bankruptcy. And with baby boomers headed for their
own midlife crises, the company appeared on the verge of
missing a huge new market.
   But it didn't.
   Less than a decade later, Harley-Davidson is enticing
white-collar workers to become weekend warriors. One in three
of today's Harley buyers is a professional or manager. About
60% have attended college, up from only 45% in 1984. Their
median age is 35, and their median household income has risen
sharply to $45,000 from $36,000 five years earlier.
   All this makes Milwaukee-based Harley the industry's
hottest company. Despite price tags that top $15,000 for
dressed-up touring bikes, its market share has climbed for
six years in a row. While Japanese competitors were chasing
each other with motorcycles of all sizes, Harley has captured
about 60% of the market for biggest bikes -- up from 23% in
1983. "Harley capitalizes on the impression they have the
`real motorcycle,'" says Bruce Johnson of J.D. Power &amp;
Associates, a California market-research firm.
   Harley-Davidson's turnaround suggests how a company, as
times change, can position a product without dissipating its
mystique. That isn't easy. The marketplace is filled with
brands, such as Coors, Volkswagen and Zenith, that once
carried, but then lost, a certain cachet. Some let
competitors erode their market; others failed to realize that
demographic changes demand new marketing approaches.
Successful marketers, says Michael Marsden, professor of
popular culture at Bowling Green State University in Ohio,
"realize their long history and play off it."
   What Harley officials managed to do was broaden their
bikes' appeal while keeping them looking big, mean and
American. They improved engine reliability and smoothed the
fit and finish -- though even as Harley overtook Honda in the
big-bike market, consumer surveys continued to suggest that
American Honda Motor Co. makes a better motorcycle.
   Officials targeted the yuppie generation by smoothing
Harley's rougher edges. They told dealers to brighten up
their stores with more lights. They slapped the Harley name
on cologne and wine coolers. They even competed with biker
clubs such as Hell's Angels with their own Harley Owners
Group.
   "We tried to leave nothing to chance," says Vaughn L.
Beals Jr., Harley's chairman, who headed a 1981
management-led leveraged buy-out from AMF Inc. Five years
later, Harley went public.
   The company's restyled mystique captured Todd Van Slyke,
for one. The 42-year-old Chicago advertising executive rides
his Harley on weekends with a group called the Rolex Rangers.
When you ride a Harley, he says, you're doing something "a
little bit nasty."
   Another devotee is Mike McAlister of Flagstaff, Ariz. On
weekdays, the middle-aged federal government administrator
wears a jacket and tie and drives a Honda Accord. Weekends,
he dons leather vest, earring and gold neck chain and jumps
on his Harley. "This is the real me]" he declares.
   Robert Lefton, a St. Louis psychologist, thinks that some
Harley buyers are grappling with midlife turmoil, and may see
a Harley as a chance to feel free, powerful and, well,
virile. "Here you are at middle age, and suddenly you feel
young," he says.
   Harley's image as a rugged bike goes back decades. In
1903, William Harley and the Davidson brothers -- William,
Walter and Arthur -- built three motorcycles in the
Davidsons' Milwaukee back yard. The bikes were crude but
tough; one of the first went 100,000 miles.
   They were also all-American. Harleys served as police
bikes beginning in 1907 and as scout and dispatch vehicles in
both world wars. In 1953, when Indian Motocycle Manufacturing
Co. of Springfield, Mass., stopped making its Indian
motorcycle, Harley was left as the last of what once were
more than 150 U.S. producers.
   Harley prospered until its troubles in the late 1970s and
early 1980s forced drastic changes. It successfully lobbied
the Reagan administration for stiff import tariffs against
Japanese bikes from 1983 to 1987 and then struggled to catch
up.
   Practically every step Harley took was geared to
attracting upscale riders. The first was to improve quality.
Officials realized that although blue-collar buyers, loyal
and mechanically inclined, might put up with a bike needing
frequent attention, the new generation of Harley riders
wouldn't. In 1983 it introduced the so-called evolution
engine, an improvement on the then-familiar V-twin.
Reliability increased, and owners no longer had to get their
hands dirty repeatedly fixing their machines.
   Harley also reduced vibration on its top-of-the-line
touring bikes by mounting the engines on rubber, and it
offered options such as sophisticated stereo systems and
intercoms built into helmets. But the company didn't tinker
with a few things: Its bikes still come with lots of chrome
and iron and a heavy dose of tail-pipe thunder. "It makes
your heart thump a bit," says Larry Winse, an Arizona dentist
who bought his first Harley in 1985.
   Many changes, though, involved marketing, not
manufacturing. Harley officials began wearing red or white
shirts at motorcycle rallies to dispel the image that Harley
riders wore only black. They revised their ads to lob gentle
messages at yuppies. A 1988 ad by Carmichael-Lynch, Harley's
Minneapolis agency, summed up the appeal with the slogan:
"Life should be so simple." The ad showed a stark 1950s
kitchen with refrigerator, table, chair -- and a Harley on
the white floor.
   Dealers cleaned up their stores, many of which had
conveyed a dark, menacing atmosphere. "Some people told us
they were afraid to walk into a dealership," says Jerry
Wilke, Harley's vice president of sales and marketing. The
newest "designer store" dealerships would make a Hell's Angel
weep: They sell motorcycle-fashion clothing amid neon lights,
mirrored dressing rooms and revolving jewelry cases next to
the 20-W-50 motor oil. Dealers are even advised how to
"present a look on a mannequin," says Clyde Fessler, vice
president of merchandising.
   Harley also worked on its image through licensing
agreements, with Mr. Fessler striving to convince retailers
that the bike's black, white and orange logo would attract
business, not scare it off. He showed them demographic data
and pictures of celebrities like Kurt Russell and Elizabeth
Taylor on Harleys. The company tries to let its name appear
only on quality items. In clothing, it monitors cotton
content and thread counts. And last year's promotional
activities even included Harley-Davidson fashion night at
Bloomingdale's.
   "As the demographic profile of the baby-boom shifts," Mr.
Fessler says, "so does our program."
   Because motorcycles often are an impulse purchase, one of
Harley's biggest challenges is holding its new customers
after they have bought a bike. Enter the Harley Owners Group,
or HOG. Run through local dealers, HOG gives the new rider
instant companionship through organized rides, rallies and
charity runs.
   HOG rallies are popular with Harley's new converts, many
of whom shun the tough biker rallies with Harley women who
bare their breasts or Harley men who destroy Hondas for fun.
Among those at a HOG rally in Phoenix last spring was Jerry
Clark, an IBM engineer who owns six Harleys but sports a
"ride straight" pin on his leather vest, and Jean McGrath, a
plant dealer who reads books while riding on the back of her
husband's touring bike.
   The rallies also give Harley executives a chance to see
what's on customers' minds. Richard F. Teerlink, chief
executive, rode into Phoenix on a new Ultra Glide with his
wife, Ann, on back. Then he held a "town hall" session that
attracted both easy riders in black boots and weekend rebels
in loafers.
   One biker asked whether Harley would wimp out and put
rubber mounting under the engine of its Softail model.
(Probably not.) Another griped that his Fat Boy bike was a
lemon and wanted to know what the company planned to do about
it. (A marketing man suggested they talk later.) Some
questions reflected quite different concerns. A gentleman in
the back asked whether Harley-Davidson planned to pay
dividends on its stock, which is traded on the New York Stock
Exchange. (No.) Another wondered how the company's
acquisition of a recreational-vehicle maker is working out.
(So-so.)
   So far, Harley has been able to satisfy its new customers
without alienating the old. Despite a shrinking domestic
market (last year's industry sales of 217,000 road bikes were
down two-thirds from their 1980 peak), the company sold
41,000 motorcycles in the U.S. last year, up from 27,000 in
1983. Harley plays only in the super-heavyweight category and
lets the Japanese fight over the shrinking market for smaller
motorcycles.
   Its shareholders have benefited, too. Harley shares,
adjusted for June's 2-for-1 stock split, sell for $23, up
from the $5.50 initial public offering price in 1986. Last
year's net income surged 38% to a record $32.9 million, or an
adjusted $1.91 a share, on sales of $791 million. This year,
first-half profits were up 61%.
   Nevertheless, after six years of rapid sales growth,
Harley may soon face new hazards. Its Holiday Rambler RV
division is already in a slump, and the higher gasoline
prices since the Mideast crisis began bode ill for motor-home
sales. A recession could clobber both bike and RV sales.
   And Harley's motorcycles may be getting too fashionable.
The basic appeal of being bold and different loses something
when nearly everyone seems to be riding a Harley. A few years
ago, the company was happy to persuade Malcolm Forbes, Jay
Leno and Mickey Rourke to pose for its annual catalog. Today,
Harleys are the bike of choice in Hollywood. The unanswered
question: How many weekend rebels will remain loyal after
Hollywood turns to a new toy? "When they get tired of being
bikers, they'll go out and be yachtsmen or whatever the next
thing is," predicts Carl "Rodent" Metzger, a long-haired
photographer who travels the country taking pictures of
bikers.
   That thought has occurred to Harley and its advisers. It
is one reason the company diversified into RVs in late 1986.
   But Harley bets that innovations like HOG will help it
hold most of the new riders. Mr. Beals, the chairman, says
U.S. sales have grown steadily, without a sudden boom that
could lead to a bust. And officials think the fast-expanding
foreign sales, now running about 15,000 bikes a year, should
eventually approach those of the U.S. Exports to Japan are
rising, and the company is setting up HOG chapters in Europe.
   Harley even sees an untapped market in the U.S. To
encourage more women to ride, the company has formed a
"Ladies of Harley" club and come out with a new line of
tattoos for women. For those who aren't ready to make a
lifelong commitment, the tattoos are removable.

says.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  STANDING UP TO A WORD HOG  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     But there's more than business at stake. To appreciate this, you need some
background.;   About six years ago, Seghieri, then a 37-year-old sheet metal
worker, and some biker buddies were having a late-night discussion over some
beers.;   "I said something like: 'I'm tired of doing what I've been doing,' "
he recalled. "One of the guys suggested opening a motorcycle parts store. The
light bulb went off.;   "We started kicking around names. Way into the night,
someone came up with 'The Hog Farm.';   "Since we were all riding Harleys (as
in Harley-Davidson motorcycles) and since Harleys were pretty much known as
the classic 'Hogs,' it seemed right," he said.;   To appreciate the
significance of this revelation, you need a bit more background.;  
Milwaukee-based Harley-Davidson has been making motorcycles for 87 years. At
the end of World War II, when returning soldiers were buying them because they
were cheap, Harleys were likened to garbage scows -- fat, low to the ground,
exhaust belchers -- "Hogs.";   IT'S IMPORTANT to keep that historical tidbit
in mind because the Harley lawyers are building their case against Seghieri
around it.;   Anyway, Seghieri borrowed some money and leased a brick building
at Montgomery and West San Carlos streets near downtown San Jose.;   He
specialized in Harley parts. He hired reliable mechanics and put in a few
decor options -- chrome accessories, leather jackets, raunchy T-shirts, etc.; 
 Within a couple of years, "The Hog Farm" became San Jose's most popular
Harley parts store. Last year, it grossed about $1 million.;   By comparison,
Harley-Davidson had $600 million in bike and parts sales worldwide last year.
That's muscle.;   Now the giant bike builder is trying to muscle Seghieri out
of business because The Hog Farm is not one of 600 official Harley dealers.
The official Harley dealer, Golden State Harley-Davidson, is about 150 yards
down the road on West San Carlos Street.;   Harley-Davidson says Seghieri is
ripping off not only its good name but also the name "Hog," which, the
company's lawyers have pointed out in federal court, is a registered
Harley-Davidson trademark.;   "It's not that we have anything against Mr.
Seghieri; we just do not want the word 'Hog' or even 'H-A-W-G' to be used
negatively or to become generic, like aspirin," said Bill Wood,
Harley-Davidson's manager of trademark enforcement.;   HE TOOK great pains to
sound polite on the phone. But I got the picture.;   "I can't tell you how
many victories we've had or who they were," Wood said, "because most of those
people backed down and settled out of court.";   Sounds pretty intimidating.; 
 "They've got the money," said Seghieri. "They're trying to wear me down.";  
But he's got his own lawyers. And he said he'll fight.;   You've got to admire
him -- the little guy standing up to the self-righteous bully -- especially
when the cause is bigger than business.;   It's language.;   In Germany,
Harley-Davidson's biggest foreign market, it's the word "schwein." In France,
it's "cochon." In Italy, it's "porco." In Japan, it's "buta.";   "We do not
intend to go after foreign derivations, regardless of the markets," Wood said.
"We're only interested in the American word 'Hog.' ";   Somehow, that's not
reassuring. Harley-Davidson's claim on the word still sounds greedy. It ought
to be challenged.;   A little San Jose business could be the place to draw the
line.  </TEXT>

<HEADLINE>  'HOG HEAVEN'
HARLEY, NEARLY BROKE A DECADE AGO, HAS ROARED
BACK TO PROFITABILITY BY IMPROVING QUALITY
AND MARKETING  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  See related article on this page  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "I don't even have any used ones. I sold about 30 (used motorcycles) this
year. More than I ever have.";    Business for a number of other Harley
dealers also has been in high gear over the past few months.;   
Milwaukee-based Harley-Davidson Inc., the only U.S.-based motorcycle
manufacturer, says that current inventory levels are at an all-time low
because of accelerated demand. Meanwhile, much of the motorcycle industry is
fighting to escape a decade-long slump made even worse by the current
recession.;    Harley's 1990 profit rose nearly 15 percent to $37.8 million,
or $2.12 a share, from $33 million, or $1.91 a share, in 1989.;    Harley's
sales, including parts and accessories, totaled $864.6 million last year, up 9
percent from $790.9 million the previous year. Just a few years ago, the
company was on the brink of bankruptcy.;    Industry experts attribute its
turnaround largely to increased quality control, an expanded product line and
some innovative marketing techniques.;    But it has been a long road to
recovery.;    Before the Japanese invasion of the U.S. market in the 1960s,
Harley had very little competition. It became the lone American survivor when
Indian motorcycles ended production in 1953.;    But Honda Motor Co. Ltd.
stepped in and transformed the market almost overnight, selling lightweight,
colorful, easy-to-ride motorcycles that were hundreds of dollars cheaper than
a Harley.;    In 1959, 60,000 motorcycles were sold in the United States. By
the early 1960s, the Japanese giant was selling 60,000 all by itself, while
Harley sold 10,000 to 13,000.;    The market reached its all-time high in
1973, when the Arab oil embargo helped spur sales to 1.5 million. Harley went
along for the ride, even after it was purchased by AMF Inc. in 1969, selling
as many motorcycles as it could produce.;    In 1973, Harley held a 77 percent
share of the heavyweight portion of the market -- which includes those big,
distinctive motorcycles featured in such movies as "Easy Rider" and favored by
many law enforcement agencies.;    But the Japanese competitors had big ideas.
Their strategy: invade the lightweight market segment, go for high volume at
low prices, then move into the heavyweight division.;    Much of the Japanese
machinery was designed to look like Harley clones, although the quality was
higher.;    Under AMF, Harley expanded production at a fast pace -- from
27,000 motorcycles in 1969 to 60,000 in 1972 -- but product development was
ignored and quality plummeted.;    While only 5 percent of Japanese machines
failed to pass company inspection, as many as 60 percent of Harleys failed.
Because of missing parts, new Harleys often came off the assembly line
incomplete and simply sat in areas called "hospitals" until they were
finished.;    Sometimes, unsuspecting dealers did the dirty work.;    "We
fixed them. We made them run. It was rough," said Splittgerber, the
Schenectady dealer. 'We were not accustomed to that because the old company
made a good motorcycle. We had the bikes, but we couldn't sell them.";    By
1983, Harley's share of the heavyweights had plunged to 23 percent; Honda's
jumped to 44 percent.;    "There was a mess of bikes that AMF had built in the
factory in crates, stacked one on top of the other right to the ceiling,"
Splittgerber said. "They came to us and more or less begged us to take them.
They needed the cash. I said I'd take eight of them, and they almost kissed
me.";    Harley would not have survived without such loyal dealers.;   
Thirteen Harley managers bought the company from AMF in a leveraged buyout in
1981. There were numerous layoffs over the next few years, and the company was
forced to borrow heavily. There were even rumors of filing for bankruptcy.;   
"It was a terrible time to be working for Harley," said John Gaedke, a Harley
spokesman, whose father lost his job after 23 years with the company. "There
was one black Wednesday when they just came in and fired every engineer
without a degree," he recalled.;    The Japanese were indirectly responsible
for Harley's turnaround. The company learned tips from its foreign competitors
and improved quality and production while expanding its product line.;   
Harley also received help from the Reagan administration, which imposed stiff
tariffs against imported motorcycles from 1983 to 1987.;    In addition,
Harley introduced some innovative marketing techniques, like promoting test
rides. It fosters a familylike atmosphere through the Harley Owners Group,
which has more than 100,000 members nationwide and conducts club activities.; 
  Although motorcycle sales dropped precipitously during much of the 1980s --
from 1.3 million in 1984 to 505,000 in 1989 -- sales of larger bikes, like the
kind Harley makes, gradually rose. In 1984, larger bikes made up 12 percent of
sales; in 1989, it rose to 21 percent.;    Today Harley sells about 60,000
motorcycles annually -- starting at $6,000 for smaller bikes and at $10,000
for larger ones -- and holds about 60 percent of the market for larger bikes,
compared with Honda's 14 percent share.;    "We have about a 95 percent
loyalty ratio today," Gaedke said. "Once they buy, they stay, and I have yet
to see a Honda tattoo.;    "The idea is to get people into the family. That's
really what Harley is. It's not just a piece of hardware.";  The average;

<HEAD>Bikers Deliver Toys to L.A. Skid Row Mission</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 400 motorcyclists, from yuppie
weekenders in exotic leather to hard-core bikers in soiled denim
``colors,'' delivered toys to a Skid Row mission in a thundering
testament to good will.
   The walls of the Fred Jordan Mission echoed from the blast of
arriving and departing Harley-Davidsons, Hondas, Kawasakis and
other big road bikes as the members of the Harley Owners Group
(HOG) and other motorcycle clubs made their second annual delivery
for the mission.
   Some Skid Row residents looked astounded at the polished
machines, some of them festooned with Christmas garlands and
mounted by riders wearing red and fur-trimmed Santa Claus hats.
Others took the opportunity to collect empty aluminum soda cans
left by the riders.
   ``I think it's the neatest thing there is,'' said Ferdie
Chaddick of West Los Angeles.
   Resplendent in black leather pants and jacket, Chaddick watched
and laughed as Skid Row children and mission workers sat astride
his $16,000 Harley for a snapshot.
   It belied, he admitted, the old biker motto that nobody _
NOBODY, touches a man's machine.
   ``The thing with the mission run is, we just go along with
everything,'' said Chaddick, a Santa Monica glazier.
   The delivery to the Jordan Mission on Sunday was part of a
larger effort in which the Salvation Army said it expected 25,000
motorcyclists to drop off toys in the Dodger Stadium parking lot
for the Army's 1989 Toy Run.
   ``We enjoy it, and its great for these needy kids,'' said South
Bay Harley Owner Group member Skip Fottler, who made the run to the
mission with his wife, Mary.
   ``A lot of people think we're hellions, but we're trying to drag
down that old image,'' Fottler said. ``We have doctors, lawyers,
policemen, firemen. We're just a band of bikers.''
   The mission hopes to collect 40,000 new toys for its huge annual
Christmas party on Dec. 16. About 20,000 people are expected this
year, said Willie Jordan, widow of mission founder Fred Jordan.
   ``Last year, we expected 15,000, and we got 20,000,'' Mrs.
Jordan said. The mission ran out of toys and food bags, and about
3,000 people went away empty-handed.
   ``It was one of the saddest days in my life. I just wanted the
street to swallow me up,'' she said.

<MEMO>  See related article this page  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The side and back walls of this motorcycle shop, Golden State
Harley-Davidson in downtown San Jose, are reserved for parts. Everything a
bike rider would need to keep his or her Harley in working order is probably
available.;    Accessories and parts keep a steady stream of customers flowing
in and out of the West San Carlos Street shop.;    That's good news for owner
Rick Falzone because customers sure aren't coming in to see motorcycles.;   
Only one new motorcycle -- a '91 Harley-Davidson FXSTS Springer Softail
costing $13,652 -- and three used ones are on display.;    Business is good,
Falzone says. It's just that he can't keep inventory on hand. "When they ship
a bike, it's already sold," he said while pointing to a list of customers who
have put down deposits on yet-to-arrive bikes.;    Potential customers have to
browse through catalogs and other sales material to choose the model and color
of the bikes they want.;    Golden State Harley sells 150 new bikes a year and
75 used ones. "And I could easily sell 200 (new) bikes," Falzone said.;   
Getting enough merchandise from the Harley headquarters in Milwaukee is "a
problem," Falzone said. But the renewed popularity of the bikes, coupled with
their relative scarcity, keeps prices stable and high.;    Falzone opened
Golden State Harley in late 1986 and sold his first bike in January 1987.
Although he bought into the franchise when the parent company was in trouble,
Falzone said his business has grown steadily.;    He now has 14 full-time
employees, including a new mechanic hired last week, to try to cut down a
three- to four-week backup in the service department.;    Large shipments of
new helmets and boots also arrived last week as Falzone beat the usual fall
rush of pre-Christmas accessory orders. He estimates that 30 to 35 percent of
his revenue comes from the sale of parts and accessories.;    Falzone's
typical customer is a white-collar worker who rides on weekends as a hobby.
The perception of the Harley rider as a tattooed, black-leather-covered
motorcycle outlaw isn't accurate, Falzone said.;    Before opening his Harley
dealership, the 53-year-old Falzone worked in the computer industry. He's
single, a barber-shop-quartet singer and a weekend rider of a custom-built
bike.  </TEXT>

<HL> In Beverly Hills, The Wildest Ones Aren't Hell's Angels --- Upscale Bikers Roar Around, But Their Pastel Machines Would Make Brando Cry </HL>

<TEXT>
   It is almost midnight when more than a hundred motorcycles thunder into the ground level of the shopping-mall garage, right past the valet parking attendants, and pull to a halt. 

   Hell's Angels on a tear, no doubt. 
But wait. 
Some of these bikes are baby pink, lilac and mint green. 
The black leather jackets look too new, some of the riders too well-coiffed. 
Then Billy Idol, the rock star, dismounts from one of the Harley-Davidsons and with the rest of the crowd disappears into Durango, a nightclub. 

   Relax. 
Remember, this is on the edge of Beverly Hills. 
It is just another evening out for the local RUBs. 

   That stands for rich urban bikers. 
Baby boomers of the rebellious '60s now in cushy jobs, plus other affluent would-be Brandos, are tearing themselves away from their Easy Rider videos to join trendy new motorcycle clubs. 
Suddenly, vintage leather jackets that cost up to $3,500 are fashion statements. 
Harley-Davidsons, once the outlaw biker's wheels of choice, have become the latest Hollywood status symbol, leaving Porsches and Jaguars to the masses. 

   "It's the nouveau biker," announces Tod Breslau, executive director of Stock Exchange, a night club that is hosting a weekly biker night. 
"They wear leather and jeans, but they're kind of clean. 
You can smell the conditioner in their hair." 

   Motorcycles have become so essential that they are in the Neiman Marcus Christmas catalog. 
A red, white and blue Harley-Davidson with a white leather seat goes for $25,000 -- more than twice the price of a less patriotic, plain Harley. 
His-and-her black leather jackets with studs in the shape of an eagle are just $2,000 and $1,900 each. 

   "The next face you glimpse behind a motorcycle helmet could be a CEO's," says the catalog. 
Sure enough, there is 65-year-old William Kieschnick, former Atlantic Richfield Co. president and chief executive, posing with the bikes and clutching a red helmet. 
He and his wife are modeling the jackets, as are famous Los Angeles chef Wolfgang Puck and his wife. 

   No matter that the Kieschnicks aren't bikers, and are in the catalog only because they are "friends of the store." 
Or that Mr. Puck doesn't ride either because "it's very dangerous." (He has a point. 
A motorcycle rider is 10 times more likely to die in an accident than an automobile driver.) 

   There are plenty of real celebrity bikers, and they are giving the traditional hairy-chested Harley image a chichi slant. 
Harley-Davidson gave comedian Jay Leno a free bike for promotional purposes, but actors Mickey Rourke and Sylvester Stallone bought their own. 
The Bangles, a female rock group, and Michael Jackson are including Harleys in new rock videos. 
Two movie studios recently bought movie scripts about bikers. 

   Even Elizabeth Taylor has become a biker. 
Well almost. 
Earlier this year, Malcolm S. Forbes, Forbes magazine editor-in-chief, gave her a purple Harley to celebrate her new perfume line, "Elizabeth Taylor's Passion." 
But the usually chauffeured star lacks a driver's license, so Mr. Forbes drove the purple bike with Ms. Taylor and a purple teddy bear named Lizabear on the back. 

   Mr. Forbes, a motorcycle collector, is actually the high priest of respectability for motorcycling. 
With his own "gang" called the "Capitalist Tools," he has generated widespread favorable publicity for an activity that at one time belonged to the wild and reckless. 
"Bikes are like horses used to be to cowboys," Mr. Forbes preaches. 
"It's you and your horsepower. 
It's very personal." 

   The average RUB, if there is such a thing, tends to wax eloquent about camaraderie, Beverly Hills style. 
"If a Porsche breaks down on the side of the road, you don't see another Porsche pull over," explains Frederick Spiker, a pastry chef. 
"But if my bike breaks down, two Harleys pull over." 

   Then there is freedom and machismo. 
Some Beverly Hills bikers ride in groups of 50 or more, zooming through red lights on the way toward Rodeo Drive. 
No helmets for them, thank you, and no mufflers for their bikes. 

   Female bikers make riding a dating game on wheels. 
"It gives me a feeling of power and it's a great way to meet men," says Dianna Edwards, a 41-year-old sales representative who shows up at Durango in tight black leather pants and a red leather jacket. 
"Men think it's really hot." 

   That goes both ways, figures Kim Robinson, 33, who owns an indoor-plant design company. 
"With women in cars, you get a much better response on a Harley." 

   Gathering spots for RUBs are proliferating. 
On Sunday afternoons, more than a hundred upscale bikers, mostly professional people, may rendezvous in front of the Rock Store, a small grocery store in a canyon near Malibu. 
"I'm going through a divorce, and I wanted a way to channel my energy," says new Harley owner Albert Aragon, 32, an operations officer at First Interstate Bancorp. 

   One club, WW3, used to allow customers to drive their bikes up to the bar, until the fire marshal called a halt. 
Some women who wouldn't be seen within miles of traditional biker bars now routinely head for RUB clubs to meet nice, attractive fellows. 
At the Cathouse, women in black leather miniskirts, black lacy tops and spiked heels form a line that stretches around the block. 
"Guys on motorcycles are sexy," says Debbie Searcy, a young blond dental assistant wearing a black leather jacket. 
"They used to be hoods," she adds, "but now it's materialistic." 

   For sure. 
Beverly Hills bikers invest small fortunes in their look. 
Giuseppe Franco, a Beverly Hills hairdresser, paid about $10,000 for his Harley and put an additional $11,000 into a white paint job, chrome parts and other accouterments. 
"It's getting out of hand," concedes Mr. Franco. 
For too many, he says, the focus is getting to be, "Who has a better bike? 
Who has a bigger bike?" 

   Jeff Levy does. 
He is a clothing store owner whose Harley boasts a strip of green lizard skin near the speedometer to accent its special mint-green paint job. 
The additions cost $12,500; the bike was a mere $10,500. 
His leather jacket adorned with a painting of a sexy woman on a big playing card completes the look. 

   Women RUBs know how to make Harleys more fetching, too. 
Laurel Rosenberg, an actress who works at Beverly Hills Fur, painted her bike pink and plans to add fox trim to her boots and a mink tail to her key chain. 
A motorcycle, she says, "is something personal where you don't have to use your intellect. 
It's emotional." 

   So what do the Hell's Angels, the legendary bad boys of biking, think of all this? 
"It's not the wild and crazy days of the '50s and '60s," laments a hulking Angel who identifies himself only as "Dougster." 
He complains that "people in Hollywood are into the Harley-Davidson for the nightlife and glamour. 
They ride from their homes in Beverly Hills to the coast on weekends. 
Rarely do you see them on the highway touring across the U.S." 

   He and some other Hell's Angels are willing to mix in with Beverly Hills RUBs once in a while. 
But they still dress their Hogs in basic black.

   Gloria Carter Spann, the last surviving
sibling of former President Carter, died Monday of the type of
cancer that killed three other family members. She was 63.
   Mrs. Spann had been diagnosed in December as having pancreatic
cancer, which killed her father, James Earl Carter; her sister,
Ruth Carter Stapleton; and her other brother, Billy Carter.
   Her mother, Lillian Carter, had breast cancer that had spread to
other organs, including her pancreas, when she died in 1983.
   Mrs. Spann, who lived on a farm southwest of Plains, died at
Sumter Regional Hospital at about 1 a.m. She was with the former
president and his wife, Rosalynn, several close friends and her
husband, Walter Spann.
   Mrs. Spann, an avid motorcyclist, will be buried Tuesday at a
graveside service at Lebanon Cemetery in Plains following a funeral
procession led by fellow motorcyclists. All but Mrs. Stapleton are
buried in the cemetery.
   Billy Carter's widow, Sybil, said the family is bewildered by
the disease and hopes that scientists can learn more about it.
   ``It's very sad for all of us,'' she said. ``It's just something
we don't understand. Our family is grieved and saddened.''
   Carrie Harmon, a spokeswoman at the Carter Presidential Center
in Atlanta, said the former president was issuing no statement
about his sister's death. Carter will depart as scheduled on a
Middle East trip later this week.
   As residents of her small farming community mourned Mrs. Spann's
death, a group of about 10 fellow bikers, some in jeans and leather
jackets, consoled her husband at the family farm.
   The Spanns were described by friends as private people who
shunned the publicity that Carter's presidency brought to the south
Georgia town of 600.
   A 6-foot wire fence protects the Spann's white frame house from
unwanted guests. A sign posted at one of the gates says,
``Motorcycles Only.''
   Spann, wearing a leather vest, dark glasses and with long,
flowing gray hair, said his wife had requested the motorcycle
procession.
   He and the other bikers gathered in the yard declined to be
interviewed. A red Harley-Davidson motorcycle was parked nearby.
Some of the bikers had beards, while some wore jackets and shirts
with Harley-Davidson logos.
   A burly biker wearing a military-style beret stood a few feet
from a reporter with his arms crossed over his chest, as if to
protect Spann from unwelcome guests.
   In downtown Plains, tourists visited a Jimmy Carter museum in
the railroad depot Monday and Mrs. Spann's cousin, Hugh Carter,
chatted with visitors in his antique shop.
   ``She was a fun person, outgoing, smart and beautiful,'' he
recalled. ``She had lots of friends. The mood everywhere is very
sad.''
   ``Everybody is concerned. We're going to miss her,'' said Walter
Dozier, a neighbor.
   Mrs. Spann belonged to the Georgia Motorcycle Rights
organization and was named Most Outstanding Female Motorcyclist in
the nation in 1978. Just after her cancer was diagnosed, she said
through a spokeswoman that she and her husband planned to ride
their motorcycles to Florida for the weekend.
   She and her husband traveled widely by motorcycle and at one
time she received an award for having biked 100,000 miles.
   Mrs. Spann was co-author of the book ``Letters from Home'' in
the early 1970s, based on letters written by her mother while she
served with the Peace Corps in India.
   Besides her brother and husband, Mrs. Spann is survived by a
son, William C. Spann.

<HEAD>Thousands Of Harley-Davidson Owners Rumble Into Milwaukee</HEAD>

   It was a homecoming for Harley-Davidsons
Saturday, and thousands of bikers came to party, swap stories and
share what they say is a special bond among ``hog'' owners.
   ``This is going to sound crazy, but I just kept patting my bike
all the way here, saying, `You're coming home,'' said Chuck Dungan,
a mechanic from Kansas City, Mo.
   Milwaukee-based Harley-Davidson Inc., the country's only
motorcycle maker, called on bikers from across the United States
and Canada to come celebrate its 85th anniversary and raise money
to fight muscular dystrophy.
   By late Saturday afternoon, officials estimated 11,000 bikers
had arrived for the weekend event, which is expected to attract at
least 20,000 riders.
   Dungan said owners of hogs, as Harley-Davidsons are called,
share a bond with each other and the company.
   ``It just kind of gives you goose bumps,'' he said of the
gathering.
   ``If you ride a Harley, you've got an infinite home in
Milwaukee,'' said Bob Bunton, from Lakeland, Fla.
   At Waukesha County Technical College, bikers turned a parking
lot into a sea of black and red metal with glistening chrome.
   The riders included middle-age men with scruffy beards and
leather jackets, and couples toting 35 millimeter cameras. The vast
majority wore black T-shirts bearing the Harley-Davidson name.
   Dennis Hamon of Lake Tahoe, Calif., said his bike's transmission
once broke in Iowa, and another Harley-Davidson owner lent him new
equipment.
   ``Man, there's something about Harleys,'' he said. ``There's
more than a machine. Anytime you pull into a town and you see
Harleys, you know you have something in common.''
   Ruby Lovett, 59, of Worcester Mass., suffered a broken arm in
Syracuse, N.Y., but that didn't stop her and her husband from
completing their journey.
   ``I just had to go on,'' she said.
   One rider who sat quietly among the crowd was Pat Harley, whose
grandfather, William S. Harley, was one of the company's founders.
   ``I was riding before I could walk,'' Harley said.
   Harley sat on his bike, which had a sidecar that carried a
wheelchair. He said he was paralyzed in an accident over two
decades ago, but that didn't dent his enthusiasm.
   ``Just because you can't hold your bike up doesn't mean you
can't ride,'' he said.
   Most bikers gathered at the college or at another designated
spot in Kenosha County. Then they rode into Milwaukee's lakefront
and the festival grounds in groups of 50 to 100, watched by
hundreds of spectators who gathered at overpasses along the highway.
   Bikers gave a $10 donation to muscular dystrophy to get into the
weekend festival, which features music and carnival games, and
others were admitted for a donation of $14.
   Meanwhile, the nation's oldest motorcycle race was expected to
attract as many as 50,000 bikers to central New Hampshire over the
weekend.
   By late afternoon, about 25,000 bikers were in Weirs Beach, a
popular amusement area in Laconia in the state's Lakes Region, said
police Capt. Robert Babineau. Thousands of spectators and
motorcyclists packed Bryar Motorsport Park, where the Loudon
Classic and other motorcycle races were held.
   Babineau reported about 130 arrests in Weirs Beach, mostly for
disorderly conduct and motor vehicle violations. Numerous accidents
also were reported, all of them minor.

Big Expansion
In U.S. Lines
---
Japanese Auto Maker to Be
First to Manufacture All
Of Its Major Parts Here

   Honda Motor Co. said it will boost engine production capacity sixfold and start making transmissions, suspension assemblies and brakes in the U.S., making it the first Japanese auto maker to build all of the major parts for its cars in the U.S. 

   While Honda already assembles cars in the U.S., it imports most of the parts from Japan. 
The new operations, which will be part of a $450 million expansion of Honda's Anna, Ohio, engine plant, are the broadest U.S. manufacturing expansion to date by any Japanese auto maker. 

   Honda also said that, effective March 1, it will organize all of its North American operations under a new company, Honda North America Inc., which will chart Honda's strategy in this part of the world. 
Tetsuo Chino, 55 years old, senior managing director of Honda Motor Co. and president of its U.S. sales arm, American Honda Motor Co., will assume the additional responsibilities of president of the Torrance, Calif., umbrella company. 
Mr. Chino has essentially already been guiding North American operations for Honda. 

   Honda's planned expansion of manufacturing operations here marks the auto company's latest inroad into the lucrative North American market. 
It comes at a time when the strength of the Japanese yen has made it as cost-efficient for manufacturers to build in the U.S. as to import parts and finished vehicles from Japan. 

   Already, Honda is building its Civic and Accord cars and its Gold Wing motorcycles at plants in Marysville, Ohio. 
And in September, Honda started making engines for its Civics at the Anna plant, which opened in 1985. 
Until September, the plant had made motorcycle engines. 

   Honda's announcement, made late last night both here and in Japan, also may help the company battle growing protectionist sentiment in Congress. 
Though the list of so-called Japanese "transplant" companies assembling cars in the U.S. is growing, the United Auto Workers union and others have complained that labor-intensive parts, such as engines, are still built in Japan and then shipped to the U.S. for final assembly. 

   Honda says the expanded production in Anna will help boost local content for its cars built in Ohio to at least 66% by 1990 from the current 50%, including labor. 

   The company was quick to note the political significance of this. 
Noboru Okamura, Honda's chairman, said in a statement that the new operation represents "another major step in Honda's endeavors to make the cars built in Marysville truly American products." 

   Expansion of engine production at Anna wasn't totally unexpected, since Honda has been boosting auto assembly here and has said it is studying the possibility of further increases. 
The dimension of the new operations at Anna, however, reflect how important the U.S. market is to Honda and how aggressively it plans to pursue its position here. 
In 1986, Honda sold more cars in the U.S. than it did in Japan. 

   Michael Luckey, an auto analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., said he believes the expansion "will turn out to be a good move on (Honda's) part -- both from a political as well as a competitive point of view." 

   Honda said the new operations also reflect its strategy of building products where it sells them. 
The company currently has capacity to build about 60,000 engines at Anna for the Civic subcompacts it makes in Ohio. 
Honda said that by 1991 it expects to be making 360,000 engines at the plant for the Civics, Accords and motorcycles it builds in Ohio. 
The expansion will create about 800 jobs and will add to, rather than replace, Honda's world-wide engine-production capacity. 

   Of the 693,515 cars Honda sold in the U.S. last year, about one-third of them were built in Marysville. 
The company said it will build 320,000 cars in Marysville this year and 360,000 cars in 1988. 
Honda also recently started building Accords at a new plant in Ontario. 

   The company's cars have been selling strongly in the U.S. and any additional production in the future is likely to be welcomed by dealers. 
Honda had a five-day supply of inventory Dec. 1, according to Automotive News, a trade publication. 
A 60 to 65-day supply is considered normal. 

   Any addition to Honda's U.S. car production in the future would also allow the company to skirt the voluntary restraints that currently put a quota on the number of cars Honda and the other Japanese auto makers can import into the U.S. 

   Still, the company is expanding its operations here at a time when the U.S. market is growing increasingly competitive. 
Several Japanese auto makers, including Toyota Motor Corp., Mazda Motor Corp., Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. and Izusu Motors Co., are either expanding or building new capacity in the U.S. 

   Separately, Honda said it is projecting 1987 sales of 750,000 cars in the U.S. and 550,000 cars in Japan. 
In 1986, the company sold about 500,000 cars in Japan. 
Honda also said it plans this year to start exporting Accords from Marysville to Taiwan.

   Sixty bikers guided their Harley-Davidson
motorcycles into a rural cemetery for the funeral of former
President Carter's sister, Gloria Carter Spann, an avid rider.
   Mrs. Spann, the last surviving sibling of Jimmy Carter, died
early Monday of the same cancer that killed three other members of
the family. She was 63.
   About 300 people, including Mrs. Spann's husband, Walter, and
the former president and his wife, Rosalynn, gathered at the
Lebanon Cemetery on Tuesday for a 30-minute graveside service.
   The mourners included men in business suits, women in Sunday
dresses and bikers in grimy faded jackets with club colors
emblazoned on the back.
   Walter Spann, his long hair tied in a pony tail, wore a black
leather jacket.
   Mrs. Spann belonged to the Georgia Motorcycle Rights
organization and was named Most Outstanding Female Motorcyclist in
the nation in 1978.
   The Harley-Davidson Motorcycle Co. sent a floral spray.
   Riding side-by-side on 30 motorcycles, the bikers led the
funeral procession from Americus to the cemetery, a few miles
southwest of Plains in rolling farm country. Eight bikers served as
pallbearers.
   John ``the Reverend'' Herlihy, a photographer and custom bike
builder from Melbourne, Fla., was introduced to the mourners by the
Rev. Jenny Jackson Adams, pastor of Morningside United Methodist
Church in Americus.
   The bearded middle-aged biker, with tattooed arms and long hair,
and wearing a black T-shirt emblazoned with ``Biker Lifestyle,''
stood at a microphone a few feet from the coffin. His voice cracked
with emotion as he remembered his discussions with Mrs. Spann.
   ``Please take some time and say a prayer for her because I know
she's in biker heaven,'' Herlihy said.
   The pastor described Mrs. Spann as a courageous person who lived
life to the fullest and was an inspiration for others.
   ``Gloria was tough and Gloria was wonderful,'' she said.
``Gloria was a private person and saw no real need to explain her
life to people. She did not seek the spotlight, but she was a light
_ bravest of the brave _ and of course she knew exactly what she
was up against with this disease.''
   Mrs. Spann had been diagnosed in December as having pancreatic
cancer, the same disease that killed her father, James Earl Carter;
her sister, Ruth Carter Stapleton; and her brother, Billy Carter.
   Adams said Mrs. Spann felt that Christianity can be meaningful
for all types of people.
   ``Perhaps it was part of her nature to transcend culture and to
transcend lifestyles in the way that she did and to bring out the
best in all kinds of people who thought of themselves as pretty
rough characters,'' Adams said.

<LEADPARA>  THE HOG Farm in San Jose features one of the most impressive inventories of
chrome accessories for overhead engines, sprocket covers and suspension
systems, as well as raunchy black T-shirts, in all of Santa Clara County.;   
But now, owner Larry Seghieri is begrudgingly considering stocking some new
merchandise in his popular motorcycle parts shop -- helmets -- which
California Gov. Pete Wilson made mandatory beginning next year.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  'ROAD DOGS' HATE HELMETS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "Maybe we can make it the hot item for Christmas," Seghieri sighed bleakly,
leaning against a glass display case full of chrome gas tank covers for
Harley-Davidsons, "Hogs," if you will, or more appropriately, the machines
that made American motorcycling famous or infamous, depending.;    The roar
from a Harley's 80-cubic-inch engine is like no other -- throaty, contentious,
untamable, threatening with one crank of the throttle to run amok.;    That's
what turns some people on and terrifies others. Not the machine; the wild and
wind-through-the-hair image exuded by the people who straddle them.;    "Are
they worried about safety, or just jacking us around?" asked Doug Bontempi, a
43-year-old air brush painter and self-described "road dog" who owns a 1990
Harley FXRs worth about $10,700.;    HE'S BEEN riding for nearly 25 years, 19
of them with the Hells Angels in Oakland and San Jose.;    "I remember being
in the car when I was a kid and seeing these guys come over the hill," he
said. "All that color, all that noise, hair blowing, everything.";    Bontempi
figures he's run more than 20,000 road miles a year over the years. And,
frankly, he looks it.;    He says he'll wear a helmet, because, "What else can
I do? It's a $100 fine every time.";    But I can't quite picture him and 200
other hog-straddling Angels roaring down Highway 1 in their crash helmets, and
I don't want to, either. I'd rather picture the scene whereby a lone
California Highway Patrol officer suddenly comes upon 200 leather-clad,
helmetless scofflaws and decides to beat it for an early coffee break.;    For
better or for worse, their affiliations and well-earned nasty reputations
aside, road dogs with the wind in their hair have been part of the California
scene, blacktop cowboys the rest of us have watched with fear, fascination and
a little bit of envy.;    If they want to risk their lives for the sake of
keeping up their crazy appearances, the government ought to let them. Laissez
faire: Let reckless road dogs die.;    I know you can't selectively apply the
laws.;    'BUT A lot of us have mellowed," Bontempi said. "We wouldn't still
be alive and on the road if we hadn't mellowed.";    There's a shred of
evidence to back him up.;    According to California Highway Patrol
statistics, 40 percent of the more than 500 accidental motorcycle deaths in
1989 involved riders between the ages of 15 and 24. Thirty-seven percent were
between 25 and 34.;    "Helmets aren't going to protect people who have no
business being on bikes," said Bill Shrum, 44, a marketing manager and Harley
rider. "The important thing is to make the test for the operator's license
harder. All you do now is run through some pylons at 10 mph in the parking lot
of the DMV.";    Other Hog Farm regulars wandered in. They weren't shopping
for parts. They were looking to vent their frustrations.;    Similar
frustrations are being vented in biker crossroads throughout California. But I
wonder if anyone has come up with a better slogan for a raunchy black T-shirt
than Larry Seghieri did.;    "A vote against Pete Wilson is a vote for
freedom!" When he announced it, the guys at the Hog Farm howled.;    I bet it
won't be the last howl the governor hears from the road dogs.  </TEXT>

   Until last week, Harley-Davidson Inc. was selling all the
motorcycles it could make. Now it can't make any of the
motorcycles it wants to sell.
   Harley's first strike since 1974 has halted the momentum
at the Milwaukee company, which in recent years has breezed
past problems that plagued other companies -- from industry
slowdowns to economic recession and escalating gas prices.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Efforts to end the walkout that began Feb. 4 at the
company's York., Pa., plant continued late yesterday. A
federal mediator met with negotiators for Harley and the
International Association of Machinists, which represents the
1,421 striking workers.
   Each day of lost work means 275 motorcycles that can't be
made -- or sold. With the current model year sold out
already, neither Harley-Davidson nor its dealers have a big
buffer of inventories to insulate them from the effects of
the shutdown.
   Although its recreational vehicle unit has suffered from
the recession and high gas prices, Harley's motorcycle
business has continued its long string of earnings and
market-share increases that began in the mid 1980s.
   Chick Hancock, owner of Chick's Harley-Davidson in
Albuquerque, N.M., says dealers have one reaction to the
strike: "God, please get this thing over." He says a few of
the bikes his customers ordered are sitting, uncompleted, on
the York assembly line.
   Daniel J. Kapusta, an analyst at Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. in
Milwaukee, figures the strike costs the company $1.5 to $2
million in sales a day. If the strike is short, he reckons
that can be made up with even more overtime, and possibly
production during the two weeks of a normal shutdown later in
the year.
   But that might not be so easy. Overtime is one of the
issues in the conflict, the union says, along with wages and
insurance. The shutdown later in the year is used for
retooling, and making motorcycles at the same time could
prove cumbersome. Ways to make up the production shortfall
may have to be settled in negotiations.
   The last strike at Harley's York factory was in 1969, when
the company was owned by AMF Inc., and there was another
strike in 1974 in Milwaukee by members of another union. The
group of managers that bought Harley from AMF in 1981 and
took it public five years later has cultivated an image as a
company that knows how to work with its employees.
   "Evidently, they didn't mean York," says Eric Burkey, a
member of the strike committee at IAM lodge 175.
   Richard F. Teerlink, the company's chief executive
officer, acknowledges that with the strike, Harley's vaunted
employee involvement philosophy "hasn't worked as
successfully as it should have." The test, he says, will come
after the conflict is settled. "The only way Harley has
succeeded is by getting everyone pulling in the same
direction," he says.
   The walkout has already led the company to lay off 398 of
774 employees at its manufacturing operations in Milwaukee,
where it makes engines and transmissions for the York
factory. And Harley warns that if the strike continues
through this week, it will lay off another 41 workers
starting Monday.

BUILT FIRM INTO A WORLD-BEATER  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Additional information attached to the end of this article.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Honda launched his corporation by attaching recycled war engines to
bicycles.;    An inventor by nature, who often joined workers on the floors of
his factories and research laboratories, Honda developed engines that
transformed the motorcycle into a worldwide means of transportation. He also
helped develop the world's first anti-pollution passenger car engine.;    At
his death, the company that bears his usually mispronounced name -- actually
HONE-dah -- stood as Japan's fourth-largest carmaker, manufacturing 1.9
million automobiles a year. It also is the world's largest producer of
two-wheelers, with 3.4 million motorcycles in its latest fiscal year.
Corporate sales were $30.5 billion.;    Following the Honda's strategy, his
firm was the first Japanese auto company to build factories in its main
market, the United States. This year, Honda is expected to become the third
largest producer of passenger cars in America, displacing Chrysler.;   
Indeed, it was in the United States, not Japan, that the balding engineer with
a razor-sharp temper found his greatest success. Taking on a U.S. industry
that seemed invincible, in the 1970s he won over a generation of young drivers
attracted to the fuel efficiency and low emissions of Honda's CVCC (compound
vortex-controlled combustion) engines.;    Honda's two biggest sellers, the
Civic and the Accord, emerged as the basic family car for millions of
Americans, and in recent years, the company has pushed into the luxury-car
market. Toyota and Nissan, which once thought his U.S. auto plant ideas were
foolhardy, soon followed.;    Although he retired in 1973, Honda's death
stirred an emotional comment from Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda Motor's president.;
   "(He) taught us the challenge of life without compromise and the real
meaning of technology. With a great deal of affection and respect, we called
him 'oyaji-san' (the great father). Words cannot express the sorrow we feel
for his departure," Kawamoto said.;    A maverick in a nation of conformists,
Honda made it a point to wear loud suits and wildly colored shirts. Described
even by Honda executives as a "tyrant in the factory" with "a quick temper
(and) thundering methods of instructing younger workers," he was blunt and
outspoken. He was never invited to join elite business circles.;    In 1967,
Honda entered the passenger car business by coming out with a midget-sized
"family car" called the N360. It had a 40-horsepower engine, a top speed of 81
mph and rode the crest of Japan's late-1960s motorization boom to become an
instant hit.;    In 1972, Honda became the world's first automaker to develop
an engine capable of restraining emissions to the standards specified for 1975
by the U.S. Clean Air Act without the use of a catalytic converter, announcing
the development of the fuel-efficient, stratified-charge CVCC engine.;    The
announcement severely embarrassed Detroit's Big Three, who at the time were
protesting that the Clean Air Act's standards were too strict.;    Born in
1906, Honda was the eldest son of a blacksmith who repaired bicycles. Honda
had only an elementary school education when, in his teens, he left home to
seek his fortune in Tokyo. He was hired by an auto repair company in 1922.;   
In 1937, he established his company, manufacturing piston rings, but found he
lacked a basic knowledge of casting. To obtain it, he enrolled in a technical
high school, applying theories, as he learned them in the class, in his
factory.;    But he did not take exams. Informed that he would not graduate,
Honda commented that a diploma was "worth less than a movie theater ticket. A
ticket guarantees that you can get into the theater. But a diploma doesn't
guarantee that you can make a living.";    World War II brought a boom to his
firm, but when the fighting ended, he sold it to Toyota Motors and took a year
off. He spent it partying with geisha and drinking alcohol that he fermented.;

HITTING HARLEY FOR MILLIONS CALLED 'JUSTICE,' NOT MALICE

<P>
Christy Joseph Dello bears Harley-Davidson no ill will. 
</P>
<P>
He can afford to be generous. An Orange County Superior Court jury last week 
ordered the motorcycle company to pay Dello $7.2 million in damages for 
fraudulently using his design for an engine exhaust system. 
</P>
<P>
The victory did not come easily, the 51-year-old Norco man said this week in an 
interview. After a 10-year fight with the company, Dello said he can now look 
back and place his experience in its proper perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no malice for Harley-Davidson," Dello said from his attorney's office 
in Corona. "They make the finest motorcycle an American would ever want to 
ride." 
</P>
<P>
Dello said his affinity for the motorcycles stems from working more than 20 
years in the machinery industry. He used his background in space aeronautics in 
1970 to open FUBAR of Anaheim, a parts shop specializing in custom bikes. 
</P>
<P>
"A customized motorcycle is an expression of your individualism," said the 
self-proclaimed "real-deal biker," which he defined as a man who "believes in 
his country, in honor . . . and rides Harley." 
</P>
<P>
He said he believes in the company's superiority in the motorcycle industry, 
and he strongly believed the same in 1980 when he said he verbally agreed with 
one of the company's former officials to be the sole supplier of a custom 
exhaust pipe he had designed. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dello testified, after he provided Harley with prototype samples and 
drawings of the system and received a $250,000 purchase order, the company took 
its business elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"They promised me an exclusive, long-term supply relationship," he said. "But, 
other than a few (purchase orders), I never received other orders. They just 
stopped. They didn't keep their promise." 
</P>
<P>
By then, Dello testified, he had taken a $300,000 loan to finance his venture 
with Harley. 
</P>
<P>
"When I didn't get another large order, I didn't have the money to pay back the 
loan," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Harley-Davidson is appealing the jury awards that total $7,166,892.25. Harley's 
vice president, Tim Hoelter, said the company had assumed Dello did not value 
its business when he raised the exhaust system's wholesale prices "to at least 
the retail levels and higher." 
</P>
<P>
"When he did that, Harley-Davidson elected to take its business elsewhere," 
Hoelter said. 
</P>
<P>
Dello denied doing that during the trial and repeated his denial this week. 
</P>
<P>
Dello is a private man and is reluctant to talk about the case. But he said he 
wanted his peers in the industry to know what happened. 
</P>
<P>
After the orders abruptly halted, Dello said, he was forced to close FUBAR, 
lost his La Sierra home and in 1984 filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
His dealings with Harley were far from over, however. In 1985, while working as 
project manager for a motorcycle parts manufacturing company, he said he 
happened to see a prototype of an exhaust system resembling his design. When he 
confronted the company's owner, he discovered that companies other than Harley 
had access to his design. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, when a Superior Court jury found Harley guilty of, among other 
charges, committing fraud, Dello breathed a sigh of "great relief" and felt 
"vindicated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The trial has given me justice," he said. "Now people will find out what 
really happened to FUBAR." 
</P>
<P>
Because of Harley's appeal, Dello said he is apprehensive about the future. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to get on with my life again," he said. "At this time, there's 
only fishing on my mind."

   It took some prodding from his
congresswoman wife, but Maine's governor hopped on the back of a
thundering motorcycle Sunday to lead thousands of leather-clad
bikers in an annual charity run.
   Gov. John R. McKernan, known for his annual tea parties that
draw scores of motorcyclists to the executive mansion, had shied
away from riding one of the big machines in past ``toys for tots''
runs through the state capital.
   But some gentle persuasion by his wife, U.S. Rep. Olympia J.
Snowe, R-Maine, who once had a motorcycle learner's permit, changed
that.
   ``I had to marry the governor to get him to ride a bike,'' Snowe
told the crowd at the Capitol Complex after she and her husband
finished their two-mile jaunt.
   McKernan rode on the back of a motorcycle driven by Carlie
Snowe, the congresswoman's former father-in-law, and she rode on
one driven by Ken Monroe.
   The estimated 10,000 motorcyclists filled two trucks with
Christmas presents for needy children.
   Jim Paterson, the Harley-Davidson motorcycle company president
who attends similar events all over the country, was impressed by
McKernan's presence.
   ``It's the only one where I've ridden behind a governor on a
Harley,'' said Paterson.

   Malcolm Forbes, the 68-year-old leader
of the pack, hugged actress Elizabeth Taylor, pulled on a red vest
sporting a ``capitalist tool'' logo and climbed onto his Harley
motorcycle Sunday to ride for charity.
   The thunder of engines pierced the dewy morning air at Forbes'
estate as the millionaire publisher's motorcycle club kicked into
action.
   He then roared down the driveway, leading 45 bikes to a rally in
Elysburg, Pa., to help raise funds for muscular dystrophy research.
   The scene recurs on Sundays from spring through fall at Forbes'
estate, Timberfield. But on Sunday, Forbes, who appeared on Outlaw
Biker's magazine May cover, was riding for charity.
   ``We do this every Sunday but this is a worthy cause,'' said
Forbes, as he prepared to leave on his 2{-hour dash. ``We're sorry
Elizabeth can't come. She's going to chopper down.''
   Miss Taylor had planned to accompany Forbes but couldn't be his
motorcycle mama because of recurrent back problems.
   ``This is the first time I haven't gone'' on a Sunday outing
this year, Miss Taylor said.
   Forbes has been a motorcycling enthusiast for 20 years. He
introduced Miss Taylor to the sport last year. Last fall, Forbes
gave her a custom-painted purple motorcycle and the two exchanged
biker rings.
   Miss Taylor rode in Forbes' private helicopter to the rally at
the Knoebels Amusement Resort, where hundreds of other bikers were
expected.
   Before leaving his estate, Forbes presented a $5,000 check to
Willie Davidson of Harley-Davidson, which is raising money for
muscular dystrophy research.
   The event was sponsored by the Eastern Harley-Davidson Dealers
Association, said Forbes' publicist, Donald Garson.
   Forbes is the publisher of Forbes magazine, a business
publication that bills itself a ``capitalist tool.''

   The president of Honda of America Mfg.
Inc. is leaving the position to become managing director of the
Tokyo-based Honda Motor Co.'s worldwide manufacturing operations.
   The new assignment in Tokyo becomes effective June 30.
   Shoichiro Irimajiri, 48, will be replaced by Hiroyuki Yoshino,
general manager of Honda's Suzuka factory in Japan.
   ``I look forward to this new assignment because it represents an
opportunity to guide Honda's plan of establishing a worldwide
manufacturing network with a complementary international parts
sourcing network,'' Irimajiri said in a statement released by the
company Wednesday night.
   Irimajiri will be responsible for both planning and operations
for all Honda manufacturing worldwide, including auto, motorcycle
and power equipment, as well as quality control.
   Irimajiri joined Honda of America as president in May 1984.
Before that, he was general manager of the Suzuka factory and
executive vice president of Honda research and development at
Asaka, Japan.
   In 1982, at the age of 42, he was appointed a managing director
of Honda Motor Co. Ltd., the youngest ever.
   Yoshino, 48, joined Honda in 1963. He spent most of his career
in Honda research and development and was executive vice president
of R&amp;D at Asaka. He also had primary responsibilities for both
Honda's international purchasing and data processing divisions.
   Honda, the first Japanese automaker to build cars in the United
States, began its operations here in September 1979 with production
at its motorcycle plant in Marysville, about 35 miles northwest of
Columbus. The motorcycle plant now employs about 320 people.
   The auto plant at Marysville, which began production in November
1982, employs about 3,700 people. The engine plant at Anna in
western Ohio began production in July 1985.

FOOTNOTES: LIGHTNING-QUICK LAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Japanese, who showed the West how to make motorcycles and electronic 
equipment faster and cheaper, have now turned their attention to brewing. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's biggest brewer, Kirin, claims to have devised a process that will allow 
lager to be produced in a plant one-tenth the size of a traditional brewery in 
just three days -- lightning-quick by normal brewing standards, which can 
require up to two months to turn out a strong lager. 
</P>
<P>
Kirin's process, described vaguely as "bio-reactor technology," remains a 
mystery, although the Guardian newspaper of Britain says the company has 
applied for patents to use ceramics as a catalyst to make yeasts work harder. 
</P>
<P>
So far no outsiders have been allowed to taste the high-tech beer. But Kirin, 
whose beers command half the Japanese market, has a solid track record. Its 
engineers' current triumph on Tokyo supermarket shelves has been a designer 
vegetable called senpousai -- a cross between cabbage and spinach. 
</P>
<P>
Reading and Riding 
</P>
<P>
The people at Paisano Publications, who put out 400,000-circulation 
"Easyriders" and other motorcycle magazines, noticed that 10% of motorcycles 
are now owned by women, compared to 1% a decade ago. Sensing a business 
opportunity, the Agoura company recently hit the newsstand with a new magazine, 
"Foxyriders," for women who ride Harley-Davidsons. 
</P>
<P>
Keith R. Ball, editor of the magazine, explains that women bike fans have 
different interests from men. They join clubs called "Leather and Lace," and 
"Women in the Wind," and decorate their bikes differently. "I've seen a few 
pink bikes," he said. The inaugural issue has tips for women on bike 
maintenance, stories by women explaining their passion for the pastime, and a 
centerfold of a strapping male biker. 
</P>
<P>
A Run on Hosiery Ads 
</P>
<P>
This must be what those acquisition-minded retailers mean when they talk about 
economies of scale. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Bullocks Wilshire and I. Magnin ran a joint ad for a hosiery sale 
saying that the stockings could be purchased at either store. But a spokeswoman 
said that doesn't mean that R. H. Macy &amp; Co., which bought the two chains a 
year ago, is thinking of combining them. 
</P>
<P>
"Both companies have two very distinct personalities, and there is no intention 
of integrating them," she said. "Where it makes sense to advertise products 
like cosmetics or hosiery, we intend to strengthen our advertising by 
advertising both chains." Most ads, she indicated, will continue to keep the 
two chains' socks -- and shirts and suits -- in different drawers. 
</P>
<P>
Been There, Done That 
</P>
<P>
The biggest California banks, such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo, recently 
began offering Saturday hours. Big deal, Great Western Bank says. 
</P>
<P>
In a press release sent to business editors last week, the large Beverly 
Hills-based institution (which is also a savings and loan, despite its name) 
noted that it has been offering Saturday hours at selected branches since the 
mid-1970s. "We helped write the book on extended hours many years ago," it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Most news accounts of the recent entry of California banks into the Saturday 
market -- including several stories in The Times -- did not note that, Great 
Western said. For reasons of its own, Great Western's bulletin did not name any 
of several other savings and loans that also have been offering Saturday hours 
for years.

   When the Legislature convenes for its spring
session Tuesday, one freshman assemblyman plans to display an
American flag while riding to work on his Harley-Davidson motorcycle.
   ``To me, that ride is very important, a milestone,'' said Rep.
David Zien, 38, a Republican from Gilman and a decorated Vietnam War
veteran.
   ``I almost sacrificed my life for that flag,'' Zien said.
   The motorcycle and flag have been Zien's trademarks since his
first run for the Legislature in 1986, when he lost by 242 votes to
longtime incumbent Democrat Joseph Looby. Zien ousted Looby in the
Nov. 8 election by 1,121 votes.
   Looby said that in 1986, Zien rode around on a Japanese-made
motorcycle with an American flag in the back. It wasn't until Zien
was criticized, Looby said, that he went out and purchased a
U.S.-made Harley.
   Zien admits he drove a Japanese-made Yamaha for a brief time in
1986. He added, however, that the bike belonged to his wife, Jane.
   He said he purchased a Harley shortly after that because he had
owned several Harleys in the past ``and I happen to love Harleys.''

   Restaurant owners are taking a dim view of a
crackdown by fire inspectors, who have been by snuffing out candles
and other open flames in establishments that failed to get the
required inspection and approval.
   ``There must be another planet we can go to where they'd allow a
candlelight dinner,'' said Marlene Pulaski, general manager of the
Tin Angel, a cliffside restaurant and lounge.
   ``It all seems a little preposterous,'' said Dan Cosagrande,
owner of Brandy's restaurant. ``How am I supposed to keep a chafing
dish warm or to use butter warmers for crab legs?''
   Ed Zeliesko, co-owner of Tramps downtown, said his restaurant has
been darker since fire inspectors ordered him to remove
glass-enclosed candles from 40 tables.
   ``At first we were astounded when these guys came in with their
fire hats on,'' Zeliesko said. ``I've seen candles in every
restaurant I've eaten at, all over town. But it's really not funny
when you realize they could cost you business.''
   Violators also can be fined $1,000.
   Fire Capt. Robert Friel said if the restaurants would seek
permission, and an inspection shows they have a good sprinkler
system and fireproof construction, ``we might be able to give them
an OK.''

   Honda Motor Co. may soon set another first among domestic Japanese auto makers -- as a major exporter of cars it makes in the U.S. to markets abroad. 

   Honda has scheduled a news conference today in Columbus, Ohio. 
As previously reported, the company is expected to announce its decision to build a second assembly plant in Ohio. 
But sources familiar with Honda's plans said it also will unveil -- most likely at the news conference -- a more important long-range strategy to build cars in the U.S. and export them. 

   The company wouldn't comment on its plans but has been touting today's event as probably the most important announcement it has made to date in North America. 
Honda's top executive, President Tadashi Kume, will be representing the company. 

   Clearly, any decision to begin exporting cars from the U.S. would be a major step for Honda, with potentially significant political and economic rewards. 
Honda, the first Japanese auto maker to build a car in the U.S., also would join Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., both of which just announced new efforts to sell selected North American-built vehicles to Western European consumers, a likely target for Honda as well. 

   However, details of the program, including which markets might be targeted, couldn't be learned. 

   Aware of growing protectionist sentiment in Congress, Honda has been broadening its manufacturing effort in the U.S. for years. 
Any further increase here, such as an export program, would improve its political position with those who argue that Japanese companies have been exporting products to this market at the expense of U.S. jobs. 

   The company has repeatedly said it wants to build cars in the markets it serves. 
Honda already sells more cars in the U.S. than it does in Japan. 

   If the Japanese yen remains strong against the U.S. dollar, Honda would also likely benefit economically from building its export vehicles in the U.S. Khaled Majeed, international auto analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., estimates that it currently costs Honda about as much to build its cars in the U.S. as it does to build them in Japan and then pay the extra transportation and other export costs. 

   If Honda were to build vehicles in the U.S. and then ship them for sale in Europe, the company could also benefit if the dollar remained weak against European currencies. 
That makes U.S. exports to Europe less expensive to buyers. 
Any major export program, however, probably wouldn't be fully under way for a few years. 

   Honda could also win an additional advantage: Cars built in the U.S. may not fall under the import restrictions that some European countries have placed on Japanese cars. 
A spokeswoman for the Delegation of the European Community Commission said she wasn't immediately sure whether a case, similar to Honda's, would evade the restrictions. 

   But she added that the location of the last "economically justified" substantial operation on a product generally defines the official country of origin. 
Honda currently imports many parts into the U.S., where it assembles cars at its Marysville, Ohio, plant. 
Honda said that U.S. parts and labor currently account for a little more than 50% of the content of vehicles it builds here. 

   "I think (Honda) would be exempt (from the European import curbs) the way things stand," said Mr. Majeed. 
"I don't think there would be enough screaming out of Europe saying they were skirting the restrictions." 

   Honda already has some operations in Europe, chiefly building products such as motorcycles and lawn mowers. 
Its only car production program in Europe is a joint venture with Austin Rover Group in Great Britain, under which Austin Rover is building a jointly designed midsized car for both the Honda and Austin Rover nameplates. 

   A major U.S. car-export program wouldn't be the first time Honda has built products here and sold them abroad. 
The company currently makes motorcycles at its Marysville plant and exports them to 15 countries. 
It recently announced that it would start exporting its top-of-the-line Gold Wing motorcycles to Japan. 

   Also, Honda this year began exporting a small number of its Accord model cars from Marysville to Taiwan. 
The company expects only to sell between 1,000 and 2,000 of the cars to customers in Taiwan this year. 
Honda also builds its Civic model cars at Marysville, and sources have said that the expected second plant in Ohio would be able to build Accords, Civics and the company's Acura luxury cars. 
That expansion of capacity would clearly be part of any export program. 

   Nissan Motor Ltd., Mazda Motor Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp. are also currently building vehicles in the U.S., but none of those cars are sold overseas.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- Japan should relax excessive 
regulations, including one that limits driving licenses for 
large motorcycles, to remove import barriers, a government body 
handling trade complaints said Friday [13 May]. 
  The Office of Trade and Industry Ombudsman urged government 
ministries to ease 21 irksome regulations listed in a report 
submitted to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. The report comes 
against the backdrop of mounting criticism that Japan's rigid 
regulations shut out foreign products. 
  U.S. motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc. has complained 
about "an almost impossible driving license test" for 
motorcycles with an engine displacement over 400 cc. In a 
complaint filed with the office by the U.S. Embassy, 
Harley-Davidson said the system effectively blocks imports of 
foreign motorcycles, almost all of which have larger engines. 
  Two years ago Japan's four major motorcycle makers appealed 
for eased regulations on large bikes and the rigid examination, 
but no change has been made. 
  As requested by Harley-Davidson, the report also recommends 
the government review its ban on tandem riding on highways and 
change the highway speed limit for motorcycles to 100 kilometers 
per hour from 80 kilometers per hour in line with that for 
automobiles. The report also urges flexible enforcement of 
rules on issuing a model certificate by accepting widely 
acknowledged foreign inspection and safety standards. 
  It also said the time required for obtaining import 
permission for cosmetics and perfume should be shortened from 
three to six months. 
  Other rules cited in the report include: 
  Regulations on foodstuff, health care and medical goods 
  -- Standards on condensed grapefruit juice. 
  -- The prevention system for plant epidemics. 
  -- Inspection rules on dairy products. 
  Regulations on industrial goods 
  -- Standards on labeling for textile products. 
  -- The licensing system for automatic nail driving 
machines run on internal gas combustion. 
  -- Rules on electric wheelchairs. 
  Regulations on transport 
  -- Safety standards and inspection rules on automobiles 
and auto parts. 
  -- Regulations on batteries used in electric cars. 
  Regulations on construction 
  -- Rules on fire-resistance tests. 
  -- Standards on wallpaper.

   Thousands _ maybe hundreds of thousands _
of motorcyclists are converging on this small, unassuming town from
all points of the compass. And they're finding the welcome mat out.
   Every year since 1940, the town of 7,000 on the edge of western
South Dakota's Black Hills has played host to motorcyclists out to
enjoy races, tours and general communal good times.
   The weeklong 50th Black Hills Motor Classic starting Monday is
expected to draw anywhere from 140,000 to 400,000 to a town that,
on a normal day, you can drive through in less than five minutes.
Most of the visitors own Harley-Davidsons.
   ``It's an extremely small-town-type atmosphere when the rally's
not here,'' said Marcy Myhre, executive director of the Black Hills
Motor Classic Board and nine-year Sturgis resident.
   ``This year it's going to be exceptionally big,'' said Randy
Billings of Phoenix, who is here with his wife, Karen. ``Every
Harley rider I know says he's coming up.''
   Last year's rally attracted only an estimated 60,000 people, at
least partly because of this year's anniversary, said Ron Paull of
Spokane, Wash. He and his wife, Jean, are running a T-shirt stand
for Spokane's Latus Motors Harley-Davidson for the fourth year.
   ``Everyone we talked to said, `Oh, my buddy didn't show up
because he's waiting for next year,''' Paull said.
   During the rally, Main Street and two other thoroughfares are
taken over by vendors like the Paulls selling every kind of biker
paraphernalia imaginable, from T-shirts to knife cases.
   By Wednesday, Main Street was a study in blue jeans, black
T-shirts and leather.
   While Hell's Angels from Ohio roared down Main Street, the
Paulls talked about how they first came to the rally as part of a
Christian bike group. They said that in the five years they've
attended, they've met people from France, Austria, Australia, South
Africa and West Germany, ``lots of West Germans.''
   The rally's reputation has hit the mainstream public
consciousness only recently.
   It was mentioned in an episode of the ABC series ``Roseanne''
last season. Roseanne Barr and her TV husband were visited by biker
friends, and one was asked if he would go to this year's rally.
   The response: ``Everybody and their dog are going to be there.''
   In 1986, a crew from the British Broadcasting Corp. filmed a
documentary on the rally. In 1988, actor Mickey Rourke rode his
Harley in from California.
   Last year, millionaire Harley lover Malcolm Forbes showed up
with his green and gold motorcycle, saying Sturgis is a ``mecca for
anyone who loves Harleys.'' Forbes died Feb. 25.
   Some rally-goers belong to established groups, such as Hell's
Angels, Banditos and Sons of Silence.
   A man was shot during one rally, but that's beyond the norm,
said Police Chief Jim Bush.
   ``It goes pretty well usually,'' said Bush, a 12-year veteran of
the 10-member force who's in his first year as chief. ``We've never
had a whole lot of great big problems.''
   However, with the predictions of huge crowds, a state task force
has been working with local officials since October to make sure
there's enough support for law enforcement, traffic control,
sanitation and firefighting.
   A few businesses have complained that not enough is done to
protect them during rally time.
   Despite that, ``I think overall, businesses feel good about the
rally,'' Myhre said.
   ``Most people, I think, accept it,'' Bush said. ``There's money
to be made, and they like the idea of the community being known
throughout the world.''

<HEAD>One Millionth Car Rolls Off Assembly Line; Hondas Arrive in Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARYSVILLE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first shipment of Honda cars made in
the United States rolled onto Japanese soil while the Ohio factory
that produced the exports turned out its one-millionth automobile.
   A shipload of 540 Accords made at Honda of America
Manufacturing's plant in this central Ohio city arrived in Tokyo on
Friday. The cars left Portland, Ore., bound for Japan last month.
   The voyage aboard the U.S.-flagged ship Green Bay was
interrupted when its ballast tank and fuel tank cracked during a
storm in the northern Pacific Ocean on the third day at sea. It
returned to Portland and left again on March 17.
   In Tokyo, Honda spokesman Bret Anderson said the company does
not build the American-made coupe.
   Production was halted for a few minutes shortly after 9 a.m.
Friday on Honda's No. 2 assembly line as a Civic four-door sedan
was driven off the assembly line at the plant which has been
building cars since November 1982.
   Al Kinzer, who became Honda of America's first employee when he
was hired as manager of administration in 1978, drove the car off
the assembly line.
   ``We owe our ability to produce 1 million cars in such a short
period of time to the teamwork and efforts of our (employees),''
said Kinzer, vice president and plant manager of Honda's engine
plant in Anna, Ohio. ``They have proven that Honda quality knows no
geographical boundaries.''

   The first American-made Honda cars imported to
Japan arrived Friday and were welcomed with a party on the ship
that brought them.
   Makoto Tanaka, spokesman for Honda Motor Co., said about 350
people attended a one-hour reception aboard the auto carrier Green
Bay, including U.S. Embassy personnel and Japanese government
officials.
   The ship's cargo was 540 Honda Accord coupes and 100 motorcycles
from Honda's plant in Marysville, Ohio, he said.
   Tanaka quoted Koichiro Yoshizawa, vice president of Honda, as
saying the arrival of Honda cars produced in the United States was
``the first concrete step'' by Japan's third-largest automaker to
meet ``flexibly'' an increasing worldwide demand for vehicles.
   Honda has said it plans to bring 4,000 American-made Hondas to
Japan in 1988 and hopes for annual sales of 50,000 by 1991.
   Atsushi Kawashima of the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry said Honda's importation plan was ``a very good action.''
   ``As a result of the yen's appreciation, it is natural that
Japan's imports be increased ... and that things like that are
happening during a major trend of imports flowing into Japan'' more
rapidly, he said.
   The yen has doubled in value against the dollar in three years,
making dollar-denominated imports cheaper.
   Last year, vehicle sales in Japan rose 9.9 percent to a record
4.5 million. Honda sold about 365,000, far behind Toyota with 1.9
million and Nissan with 1 million.
   Imported Accord coupes will be sold in Japan for about 2.6
million yen ($20,800) beginning April 22, a Honda official said.

   Slim are the profits reaped by the small investor who is lured to a big-name stock by a little bullish news. 

   This old Wall Street truism may prove painfully accurate in the case of Harley-Davidson, a number of takeover speculators and securities analysts say. 

   It wasn't the well-heeled "smart money" crowd that sent Harley-Davidson shares soaring 3 5/8 yesterday to a new 12-month high of 42 3/4. 

   "No big buyers are in there," remarked one takeover speculator who yesterday called a broker on the New York Stock Exchange floor. 
"It's only retail {small investors} buying." 

   What sent the motorcycle maker's stock racing ahead was the disclosure that private investor Malcolm I. Glazer and certain family members had bought 6.24% of the stock and might seek control of the Milwaukee company. 
Their regulatory filing came to light after the market closed Monday. 
Even before yesterday, the stock had jumped nearly 25% on takeover rumors since mid-September, when it traded at 32. 

   Some analysts think Harley's stock price has risen too fast on a bubble of takeover speculation to make it worth buying at current levels, even if it inches higher for a few days. 
"It's hard to argue against taking partial profits" on Harley-Davidson, said William Tichy, a securities analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds in San Francisco. 

   Several professional takeover speculators said they won't be buying Harley shares until they see evidence that the Glazer group could, or would, mount a successful takeover of Harley after making failed attempts to acquire other companies in 1984 and 1988. 

   Richard Teerlink, Harley-Davidson's chief executive officer, said in a brief interview yesterday afternoon that company officials hadn't had any contact with Mr. Glazer, "and we don't intend to sell the company." 

   Some analysts speculated yesterday that Wisconsin's tough anti-takeover law might repel any hostile bidder for the motorcycle concern. 
But a Harley-Davidson official said the company is incorporated in Delaware and so the Wisconsin law doesn't apply. 

   Mr. Glazer, 61 years old, is chairman of First Allied Investors Corp., a closely held Rochester, N.Y., investment company with $200 million in assets including real estate and network-affiliated television stations. 
Mr. Glazer says he spends most of his time at his Palm Beach, Fla., home "but I'm on the phone with Rochester every day." 

   Mr. Glazer failed in an attempt to take over Consolidated Rail Corp. in 1984. 
He didn't win Formica Corp. last year, either; that company was bought by another bidder. 
But he bristles at one speculator's skepticism about his intentions, saying, "We made a bid for Formica; that means we're for real." 

   Harley-Davidson is "tremendously undervalued," Mr. Glazer says. 
It has "over a 50% market share" in large motorcycles, and "there's still tremendous upside {growth potential} in the export field." 

   Analysts say the company's unique position makes it difficult to value. 
But some say the shares are worth at least 48 based on eight-times cash flow (net income plus depreciation) of about $6 a share, or three-times the company's $16-a-share book value (assets minus liabilities). 
The mystique of the Harley-Davidson name could push the per-share value above 50, analysts added. 

   Harley-Davidson management, which owns about 10% of the company, took it private in 1981 in a buy-out from its then-owner, AMF Inc., which had acquired the company in 1969. 
Harley-Davidson went public again in 1986. 

   Institutional investors hold nearly three-fourths of Harley-Davidson's shares. 
Some of the largest institutional holders say they approve of Harley-Davidson's management. 

   An officer of Harris Associates in Chicago, which bought more than 12% of the shares in the past six months, said, "Management is a key ingredient to their success." 
John Nelson, an investment officer with the Wisconsin Investment Board, which manages retirement funds for state employees and holds 7.8% of Harley-Davidson, said, "We're very pleased with the company's long-term performance." 

   Both institutions said they need more data to evaluate Mr. Glazer's intentions.

HAWTHORNE POLICE, BIKERS PLAY OUT CONFLICT IN COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL McGRAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ed (Fat Eddie) Serna had ridden with the toughest of them in his years with the 
Vagos, a band of notorious bikers formed in the 1960s to fight off the outlaw 
Hells Angels. But nothing from his biker days quite compared to the shock of 
what he says happened to his motorcycle at the hands of Hawthorne police. 
</P>
<P>
Serna said the lovingly restored 1948 Harley Davidson was confiscated in a raid 
and returned months later in pieces -- its motor rusted, the shift rod broken, 
the chrome pitted, a new paint job scratched, the taillight smashed, the 
carburetor torn loose and the seat missing. The mere sight of the disassembled 
machine, he said, plunged him into a lengthy despondence that almost wrecked 
his marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Serna, since retired from the Vagos, is among 70 plaintiffs seeking at least $3 
million in damages against the Hawthorne Police Department for alleged 
emotional distress and violation of their civil rights. The plaintiffs, who are 
being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, are also seeking a 
permanent injunction prohibiting Hawthorne police from harassing the Vagos and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
"It was in real bad shape," Serna testified, recalling when his beloved Harley 
was returned to him. "I felt very angry. I worked four years on it and was that 
close to driving it, and it was taken away." 
</P>
<P>
The trial, which is now in its fourth week before Los Angeles Superior Court 
Judge Maurice Hogan Jr., is expected to end in May. It is a study in contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
The police officers, with their neatly trimmed hair and mustaches, stride into 
the courtroom impeccably dressed in business suits and carrying leather 
briefcases. They rarely talk with anyone but their attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The bulky, bearded bikers, with such nicknames as "Panhead," "Puff" and "L.A. 
Lenard," come attired in ragged jeans and T-shirts with an occasional beer 
belly peeking out from underneath. When a reporter asked ACLU attorney Paul 
Hoffman why he didn't "dress up" his witnesses, as some other attorneys do when 
in trial, he replied: 
</P>
<P>
"They are what they are. This case isn't about how they look, but what the 
police did to them." 
</P>
<P>
The case stems from two raids that occurred in August and September of 1983, 
when police searched 43 homes in 14 cities looking for a Vagos member named 
Raymond (South Bay Ray) Malloy, who was suspected of stabbing three patrons in 
a bar. 
</P>
<P>
The police did not find Malloy at any of the homes they searched, but they did 
find a housewife stepping out of the shower, a mentally handicapped girl, a 
licensed child-care operator tending five babies, past and present Vagos 
members, and others who said they had never heard of Malloy or the Vagos. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses have testified that during the raids, police broke down doors, 
brandished guns in the faces of children, called them obscene names, used 
unnecessary force to detain them, trashed their homes, made false arrests, and 
confiscated motorcycles, cars, photo albums and other personal items. 
</P>
<P>
Named in the suit, filed jointly by the ACLU and attorney Joanne Bockian of 
Sierra Madre, are former Hawthorne Police Chief Kenneth R. Stonebraker, three 
of his lieutenants, a sergeant and numerous unnamed officers who participated 
in the searches. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the ACLU's case is the allegation that Hawthorne police lied in 
affidavits so they could obtain search warrants to conduct the manhunt for 
Malloy. The ACLU contends the raids were conducted merely to harass the 
families so that Malloy would be pressured into giving himself up. 
</P>
<P>
But Hawthorne police deny the allegations, contending they had good reason to 
suspect the Vagos were hiding Malloy, who also was wounded in the bar fight. 
Malloy eventually turned himself in to police. 
</P>
<P>
Police say they were acting on solid tips given to them by a Los Angeles County 
sheriff's detective and an informant, and from addresses and phone numbers they 
obtained from the Sheriff's Department and even some members of the Vagos. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't going to a convent with those search warrants," said John Daly, a 
Los Angeles attorney hired by Hawthorne to defend the city and its police force 
in the suit. "They (Vagos) were known violent people, and the police were 
knocking on doors with the expectation of finding Malloy, who had been accused 
of three vicious stabbings." 
</P>
<P>
Daly plans to call to the witness stand dozens of law enforcement officers, who 
are expected to testify that they used standard police procedures in conducting 
the searches, which they considered dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
The defense has painted the Vagos as an outlaw gang in which the men have long 
hair, the women tattoos, and members arm their homes with guns, knives and pit 
bulls. Through their own testimony, the Vagos have not denied much of that. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU, while not attempting to paint the plaintiffs as saints, has focused 
its case on such civil rights issues as invasion of privacy, unlawful search 
and seizure, false arrest and excessive and unreasonable force. 
</P>
<P>
"The bikers' rights were violated," said attorney Bockian. "They have the same 
constitutional rights as everybody else in this country." 
</P>
<P>
As one trial participant noted, the courtroom drama really comes down to just 
one question: who were the meanest guys on the block -- Hawthorne police or the 
Vagos? 
</P>
<P>
A jury of seven women and five men will have to sift through testimony from 
nearly 200 witnesses. The trial's outcome may hang on testimony of four people: 
Hawthorne Police Lt. Steven Frazier, Vagos International President Lenard (L.A. 
Lenard) Barela, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. James Fosdyck, and former 
Hawthorne police Officer Dana Griffith, who now works for a motorcycle 
dealership in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier is a 13-year cop whose lanky boyish looks earned him the nickname 
"Opie" because of his resemblance to Ron Howard's character on the old "Andy 
Griffith" television series. Frazier was the detective assigned to get the 
search warrants and find Malloy. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier is expected to testify that in obtaining the search warrants he relied 
on information from the Sheriff's Department -- specifically Fosdyck -- that 
the Vagos were hiding Malloy. 
</P>
<P>
Fosdyck, a 20-year deputy sheriff with steely eyes and sandy hair, disputes 
that. In clipped and unemotional sentences, he testified that he told Hawthorne 
police that the Vagos were not hiding Malloy. 
</P>
<P>
During cross-examination, the defense implied by its questioning that Fosdyck 
had a faulty memory, took no notes of his conversation with Frazier, and may 
have gotten in trouble with his superiors for giving out information on Malloy. 
</P>
<P>
Fosdyck said he had a meeting with Barela at a local Denny's restaurant during 
which the Vagos leader assured him that the bikers were not hiding Malloy. 
Barela is expected to buttress the detective's testimony when he appears as a 
witness in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Barela, a beefy man who said he joined the Vagos because many were Vietnam 
veterans like him who "felt lost," often wears checked flannel shirts and work 
boots to court. He alternately listens intently to testimony, dozes off, and 
talks proudly out in the court hallway about his Harley Davidson or a daughter 
attending UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth key witness is Griffith, whose curly, graying hair and cowboy-cut 
clothes make him resemble a country-Western singer. Griffith testified that his 
colleagues made unwarranted arrests, wrote false crime reports and brutalized 
suspects with the blessings of superiors. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith testified that Hawthorne police commonly participated in what they 
called "P.R." work, an acronym for "pound and release." This meant stopping 
suspects and "physically manhandling them to let them know their behavior 
should be modified." 
</P>
<P>
Under "P.R.," Griffith said, these people were not arrested, but "it made it a 
memorable event for them." 
</P>
<P>
Griffith also testified that when officers completed calls that involved 
blacks, Latinos, motorcycle gangs or whites of "low economic means," they would 
radio the station that the incident had been "N.H.I." -- a label meaning "No 
Human Involvement." 
</P>
<P>
In another instance, Griffith testified, officers stopped a suspected pimp on a 
traffic warrant. Some of the officers knew he was paralyzed and, as a joke, 
told a rookie officer that the man was faking it, Griffith recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"The officer dragged him out of the car through the window, and kept thumping 
him on his legs to get him to walk," Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
The treatment of the Vagos, he added, was no different. Early on in his job, 
Griffith said he was told by senior officers that "no Vago was to ride through 
Hawthorne flying their colors without being stopped." 
</P>
<P>
He said in one incident, an officer even faked a disturbance call into police 
headquarters so police could hassle a group of Vagos at a bar. After their 
arrests, Griffith said he was asked to fake the crime reports. 
</P>
<P>
Items confiscated from the Vagos -- jackets, knives and key chains -- were 
lined up on chairs in the station "like trophy displays," and city employees 
came by to admire them, Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
The defense has sought to undermine Griffith's credibility by saying Hawthorne 
police considered him a suspect in a murder and that he was allowed to resign 
from the force because of other unrelated allegations. Griffith denied the 
allegations and said he has never been interviewed by homicide detectives. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU argues that the alleged "harassment campaign against the Vagos" was 
part of a larger pattern of police abuse in Hawthorne that occurred between 
1980 and 1983 -- a direct result of a conscious political policy of Chief 
Stonebraker and other city officials to get tough on crime. 
</P>
<P>
In those years, Hawthorne was a city in transition. 
</P>
<P>
Located 15 miles southwest of downtown Los Angeles, Hawthorne changed from a 
predominantly white, working-class city to one that is 40% minority. It faced 
several crises in the 1970s and early 1980s: budget deficits caused by the loss 
of employers, a grand jury investigation that was critical of the "Old Boys" 
network and nepotism in city government, and rising crime. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, in the city's six-square-mile area, there were 13 murders, 601 
robberies and 1,558 burglaries. The figures touched off alarm among several 
grass-roots groups, which demanded and got a reorganization of the Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
As pressure was placed on the 80-member Police Department to "clean up the 
city," Griffith said he witnessed excessive force and misconduct by police 
against the Vagos and others. 
</P>
<P>
The Vagos' run-ins with the law are legendary. Over the years, some members 
have been convicted of murder, rape, drug trafficking and other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
But to hear the Vagos tell it, the organization -- whose membership at times 
has exceeded 200 -- is not unlike the Rotary Club or other service 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Vagos, which means "drifters" in Spanish, elect officers, hold weekly meetings 
at their clubhouses, have secretaries who take minutes, and adhere to strict 
bylaws. 
</P>
<P>
Each member wears a green emblem on his motorcycle jacket depicting their logo: 
a devil astride a winged motorcycle. Vagos also pass out "courtesy cards" that 
bear their logo and names. 
</P>
<P>
Their wives and girlfriends adorn their own clothing with "property patches," 
which, as the name implies, indicate the wearer is the property of a Vago. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1983, as tensions rose between the Vagos and police, an 
incident occurred at the Country Girl bar on Hawthorne Boulevard that would 
ultimately trigger the raids and the resulting lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"South Bay Ray" Malloy and a friend confronted three Latinos who were playing 
pool and told them to "talk English," according to a police report. A fight 
ensued and all four suffered knife wounds. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1983, Malloy turned himself in to sheriff's deputies. Authorities 
at the time said Malloy told them he was afraid of being picked up at his job. 
Malloy later claimed self-defense and pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of 
assault and battery and was sentenced to 142 days in jail and placed on five 
years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on search warrants, a force of 50 police officers, including two SWAT 
teams from various police departments around the Southland, conducted 
simultaneous raids on the mornings of Aug. 9 and Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
In one of those raids, Barela's former wife, Suzanne, testified that police 
"scared my children with their guns . . . threatened to shoot the dog . . . had 
a good ol' time hanging my lingerie from curtain rods . . . paraded me in my 
nightgown outside in front of neighbors . . . and called me a (obscenity) lying 
(obscenity)." 
</P>
<P>
She alleged that officers also said to her: "Since you are Lenard's old lady, 
were you passed around to the brothers?" 
</P>
<P>
"They told me to give Ray Malloy a message," she recalled. "That if he didn't 
turn himself in, they'd keep kicking in doors until he did." 
</P>
<P>
Malloy is the one person who may not testify at the civil trial, the ACLU's 
Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
The biker's attorney told Hoffman: 
</P>
<P>
"Malloy doesn't want to have anything to do with any of it."

   The Taiwanese company that offered ``Made in
USA'' labels to American distributors of its U.S. flags says it quit
the business because even that ploy didn't generate business.
   ``We stopped sales to the United States about two years ago
because our products were strongly rejected,'' Ni Feng-ming, general
manager of Ming Teh, told an interviewer in Taipei. ``I guess
Americans hate to see their national flag made by foreigners.''
   The Taiwanese government said Tuesday it was looking into the
label-switching allegations, which amount to a suggestion that
American importers violate U.S. country-of-origin labeling law.
   The U.S. Customs Service already is looking into the allegations.
   Both investigations were sparked in part by Rep. Douglas
Applegate, D-Ohio, who asked for the Customs investigation and
publicized the complaints of a Coshocton, Ohio, flag maker.
   The Colonial Flag Co. provided Applegate with a copy of the Ming
Teh solicitation, which says ``we can realize why you need'' to
remove the original label and replace it.
   ``If possible, we suggest you cut off this label after you
receive the goods and spend very little cost to mark on the flags
your own brand name and Made in U.S.A. signs,'' the 1987 letter
said. ``We can offer the labels too.''
   Ni, who said his company never changed the labels on its flags,
blamed the lack of response to the 1987 solicitation on U.S.
protectionism. The company now makes national flags for Canada,
Japan, West Germany and Australia, he said.
   Victor Chin, a spokesman for the Taiwanese government office in
Washington, confirmed Tuesday that country's Board of Foreign Trade
is looking into the matter. He predicted quick action as ``an
example to other companies.''
   ``We are very concerned,'' he said. ``We are concerned about our
image, naturally, but we are also concerned about our free trade
practices.
   ``I assume something will happen this week,'' Chin said.
   Also Tuesday, Rep. Harley Staggers Jr., D-W.Va., resubmitted
legislation that would require that all U.S. flags be made in the
United States.
   ``I am asking that my colleagues help me to keep our Stars and
Stripes raised in the battle against the exploitation of foreign
countries,'' said Staggers, who told the House some imported flags
violate the U.S. Flag Code.
   ``I have, for example, a U.S. flag that was made in Taiwan,'' he
said. ``Superimposed upon it is a Harley Davidson motorcycle with
the words `High Times' written across the gas tank.''
   Chin, an assistant in the public affairs arm of the Coordination
Council for North American Affairs, said the Taiwanese government
didn't want to comment on the potential impact of the ban sought by
Staggers.

INTO THE NIGHT: BIKERS ADD SPICE TO BENEFIT

<P>
The Scene: The Harley, Leather &amp; Lace Affair at the Spice club Tuesday 
night in Hollywood. Chaired by Dan Haggerty ("Grizzly Adams") and Bill Reed, 
1,000 motorcycle riders were expected at this benefit for the World Children's 
Transplant Fund, the Spastic Children's Fund and A Head With Horses, a 
horseback-riding program for handicapped children. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: Traditional Spandex-and-leather club scene types, plus members 
of the Hells Angels, the Tribes and other assorted motorcycle clubs. By 
midnight, perhaps 100 motorcycles were parked outside. The lengthy list of 
promised celeb guests came close to batting a rare, absolute zero until Mickey 
Rourke arrived at 11 p.m. He left 20 minutes later looking angry. (There was 
also a large turnout of press, TV crews and paparazzi grumbling about the lack 
of star presence and ready to lynch the publicist.) 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: No buzz, plenty of roar as open-piped motorcycles came and went. "The 
American people love American iron," said Haggerty. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Code: Everybody had a black leather jacket. Optional equipment included 
Levi's with a heavy-duty padlock hanging from a belt loop, handkerchief 
headbands, scar tissue. The general idea was to look sinister but to have a 
heart of gold. 
</P>
<P>
Motorcycle Mode: The '50s retro look is big. Two-tone paint jobs on "Fat Bobs" 
(large gas tanks), whitewall tires partially covered by drooping fenders, more 
chrome than Zimbabwe produces in a year. 
</P>
<P>
Money Matters: Tickets were $20. There appeared to be a few hundred paying 
guests; no one ventured an estimate of the net receipts. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: Hors d'oeuvres passed on trays included smoked salmon mousse, cantaloupe 
wrapped in prosciutto and puffed pastry with shrimp curry. Pretty much what 
you'd expect at any Hells Angels picnic. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: "There are all kinds of people in the world, but no matter what 
concerns them, they care about kids," said LAPD Deputy Chief Mark Kroeker, 
founder of the World Children's Transplant Fund, which helps to pay for organ 
transplants performed in the United States for poor children from Third World 
countries.

   Harley-Davidson is often cited as an example of
"industrial policy that worked." Over the longer term,
however, the company is more likely to make it into textbooks
as a classic case study on the follies of protectionism.
   Your Aug. 31 story on Harley notes that the market for
smaller motorcycles has shrunk to a fraction of its former
self. But your writer ignores the significance of this fact.
Buyers of smaller bikes traditionally have honed their riding
skills on the less powerful machines, then "stepped up" to
ride Harleys. The motorcycle tariffs of the 1980s destroyed
this junior market. As a result, there is no younger
generation of bikers being weaned on Hondas. When
trend-conscious baby boomers eventually tire of Harleys, the
company may be hard pressed to find replacement customers.

SARANDA, Albania 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five residents surround an American visitor on a beach here on the Albanian 
Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
He is the first American they've met, and the topics for conversation are many. 
For one thing, an Albanian navy patrol boat is buzzing the beach: Occasionally 
a swimmer escapes from this tiny Communist corner of Europe by swimming to the 
Greek island of Corfu, only a few miles away. 
</P>
<P>
But the young Albanians have something else in mind. "How much does a 
Harley-Davidson cost?" asks an English-speaker among them. 
</P>
<P>
In an Albanian textile factory the manager explains to the same visitor his 
rush order for ski parkas for West Germany. An Albanian guide, Ilir Gjoni, is 
translating, but abruptly he stops and stares at the American. "Has anyone ever 
told you that you look like the actor Michael Gross in 'Family Ties'?" 
</P>
<P>
Albania, the last Stalinist regime in Eastern Europe, has long followed its own 
xenophobic path. For decades the government has closed off travel outside the 
country. Only 14,000 foreign tourists were admitted last year. Probably fewer 
than 1,000 were Americans and virtually all of those have relatives among the 
country's 3.3 million people. 
</P>
<P>
The national press, radio and television are strictly controlled, and it has 
been about 50 years since Albania had any trade or diplomatic relations with 
the United States. Yet a visitor finds that odd bits of Americana have somehow 
penetrated this isolationist screen, giving Albanians a strangely selective 
picture of life in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Albanians know that Earvin is Magic Johnson's first name, for example, and that 
Madonna is really Louise Ciccone. It is possible to find Coca-Cola, Apple 
computers, Levi's, even a Cadillac in Albania. But they also believe that 
professional wrestling is a genuinely competitive sport. 
</P>
<P>
About one-third of Albanian high school students study English, which is the 
most common second language. But studying America is still a little like gazing 
at Mars for most Albanians. They can get an impression mostly from radio, 
television, and films, but America remains so distant that their knowledge is 
spotty at best. 
</P>
<P>
A foreign diplomat in Tirana, Albania's capital, describes young Albanians as 
"infected" by capitalism. Students there proudly wear blue jeans and T-shirts 
advertising Pepsi, Alaska, San Francisco, Levi's and Sheraton Hotels. 
</P>
<P>
One young engineer said his most valued possession is a "Manwalk" -- not a Sony 
Walkman but a copy made in China that he bought for $20 at one of a chain of 
foreign goods stores the government has opened within the last year. 
</P>
<P>
Where did he get $20? "In the street in front of the store," the engineer 
explained. The official exchange rate is 7 Albanian leks per $1, but the 
engineer paid 30 leks per dollar on the black market, so his Chinese toy cost 
him nearly a month's pay. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the dollars and other foreign currencies come into Albania from 
relatives living abroad, although Albanians also sell gold at the national bank 
so they can buy goods at the luxury stores. The stores -- similar to chains 
long established in the Soviet Union and the one-time Soviet satellite states 
of Eastern Europe -- are one way the government gets hard currency while 
simultaneously providing a safety valve for some of the frustration that 
otherwise can build up in societies deprived of consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
The Tirana shop, measuring only about 15 feet by 50 feet, is dusty and dark. 
One recent morning people were crowded three deep around the counters. There 
were blue jeans from Turkey ($15), Juicy Fruit chewing gum (50 cents a pack), 
Czech motorcycles ($2,000) and Dutch color TVs ($330). Most are major purchases 
in a country where the average income is $930 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The questions an American visitor hears reflect a fascination with Western 
lifestyles and the cost of supporting them. 
</P>
<P>
"How much does it cost to buy a house?" 
</P>
<P>
"How much is a color TV?" 
</P>
<P>
"How much do you make?" 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of car do you have?" 
</P>
<P>
When an American responds that he owns a Honda, it sometimes causes surprise. 
"Honda makes cars too?" one resident exclaimed. Most Albanians know Honda only 
for its motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
The most prestigious thing an Albanian can own is a motorcycle -- thus the 
beachcombers' question about Harley-Davidson. The lucky few are are most likely 
to buy Czech or East German machines, although Japanese motorcycles are 
considered more fashionable and a few can be seen in Tirana's streets. 
</P>
<P>
Owning a car is impossibly expensive. The few on the road are all 
government-owned. Most are East European models or green Chinese jeeps. 
</P>
<P>
But at Tirana's Kino movie studio, the boss, Viktor Gjika, offers his American 
guest the use of a 1956 robin's-egg-blue Cadillac convertible with electric 
windows and wide whitewall tires. The car was a gift from some 
Albanian-Americans to the late Communist dictator Enver Hoxha. Hoxha liked 
luxuries, but American capitalism was the wrong image, so he gave the Cadillac 
to the government, and now itis used in an occasional film. 
</P>
<P>
The few images of America that come through the official media are carefully 
controlled. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally an American film is telecast in English with Albanian subtitles. 
But the movie must meet the Albanian government's approval, which means any 
nudity is cut and usually the story deals with the darker side of American life 
or with imperialism. 
</P>
<P>
Some recent samples: "Under Fire," the Gene Hackman film about a newsman killed 
in Nicaragua; "Missing," the Jack Lemmon movie set in Chile around the time of 
the Allende coup, and "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" the Jane Fonda character 
study set at a Depression-era marathon dance.

Albania has been making films for about 30 years, but movie directors still use 
American films as an educational tool. Kino Studio produces 14 feature films, 
18 documentaries and 16 cartoons a year on a 14-million lek budget (about $2 
million), according to studio chief Gjika. He says the old Marlon Brando film 
"Viva Zapata" is required viewing. "Our filmmakers grow up on this film. Brando 
controls himself so well." 
</P>
<P>
The average Albanian feature film costs about $90,000, and it shows: Gjika says 
his directors use East German color film and concedes that the "quality is 
desiring." Occasionally the studio uses Kodak film bought in France "for scenes 
with special lighting. But it's expensive." 
</P>
<P>
Enver Derhemi, head of the cartoon department, says he tapes Walt Disney, Bugs 
Bunny and Tom and Jerry cartoons from Italian TV. The Albanians have been 
producing cartoons since 1975, and "Walt Disney is like a school for us," he 
says. "We've learned the language of animation from him." 
</P>
<P>
Many residents listen to short-wave radio broadcasts by the Voice of America, 
British Broadcasting Corp. and other stations. 
</P>
<P>
Young people love rock and roll but they don't get it from Albanian radio. The 
occasional American song heard on Albanian stations, such as "When a Man Loves 
a Woman," are instrumentals and sound like Muzak, so the young tune in foreign 
stations and can talk at length about Tina Turner, Stevie Wonder, Michael 
Jackson and Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
Because original cassettes or phonograph records of Western rock music are not 
for sale in Albania, friends get together with a dual-cassette recorder (price: 
3,500 leks, or about half a year's salary), and blank tape cassettes (100 leks 
on the black market) to record their own from foreign broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
The government's skimpy TV offerings also drive Albanians to search for Western 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Homemade Albanian antennas pull in Italian and Yugoslav TV. In the south, 
Albanians can pick up Cable News Network from Corfu. 
</P>
<P>
Gjoni, the Albanian guide, used to spend weekends in Kruje, a medieval castle 
city 2,000 feet up in the mountains near the Adriatic Sea, where it's possible 
to receive clear signals from 10 Italian TV stations, including several pay 
channels, and two Yugoslavian stations. "I stayed 24 hours a day watching 
films," Gjoni said. 
</P>
<P>
He talked about Bruce Willis, Charles Bronson and Paul Newman and asked, "Is 
Elizabeth Taylor all right?" Gjoni is one of the few Albanians with access to a 
VCR; he has both a Betamax and a VHS in his office. 
</P>
<P>
The rock music channel MTV, broadcast from Yugoslavia, is popular with young 
people. Basketball is another favorite American export. Italian television 
broadcasts NBA games, and one Albanian said authoritatively: "Magic Johnson is 
No. 1. Michael Jordan is No. 2." Another basketball aficionado insisted, "The 
Harlem Globetrotters are the best." 
</P>
<P>
The Albanian Establishment is not entirely pleased with all these uncontrolled 
foreign images. Hamit Beqja, psychology professor at the lone Albanian 
university, says foreign TV is "light, sugary, with not much substance, like 
lemonade" and adds, "Foreign TV has violence and sex. These are contradictions 
with our traditions." 
</P>
<P>
Albanians see Italian commercials for Jacuzzis while most cannot even buy 
toilet paper. They see Madonna dancing in black underwear while few Albanian 
women even use makeup, couples avoid kissing in public and many women are 
virgins when they are engaged. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the trauma of Hulk Hogan and "catch," as the Albanian 
beachcombers call professional wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
When their American visitor explained that most of his countrymen consider pro 
wrestling to be about as free-form as a three-act play, one of the Albanians 
slapped a hand to his head. "This is very upsetting!" he said. "How can there 
be a winner and a loser?" 
</P>
<P>
Land of Limits and Isolation 
</P>
<P>
Albania at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
Population: 3.3 million 
</P>
<P>
Economy: Industries include chemical fertilizer, textiles. Chief crops are 
corn, wheat, cotton, potatoes, tobacco, citrus fruits, grapes. 
</P>
<P>
Government: Communist. The People's Assembly, a single-chamber legislature of 
250 deputies, meets a few days a year, essentially to ratify actions taken in 
its name by the chairman of the Assembly, Ramiz Alia.

<TEXT>
   All of Honda's 1988 model NX650
motorcycles are being voluntarily recalled to repair a defect that
could cause loss of front-wheel braking, the company announced.
   American Honda Motor Co. Inc. said Tuesday that its dealers
would replace front wheel hubs free of charge on all 2,032 of the
motorcycles sold. This is the first year the model has been
produced.
   Under severe use, one or more of the bolts securing the front
brake disc assembly can loosen, the company said, posing a
potential danger of front brake failure. The rear brakes are
unaffected and Honda hasn't had any reports of accidents blamed on
the defect, the company said.
   Owners of the bikes will be notified, or can take the machines
back to their dealers.

   DETROIT -- Just when Detroit seems to be giving up on
"made in America" as a marketing pitch for its cars, other
folks are picking up the red-white-and-blue banner.
   And those other folks are two of Japan's largest car
companies, Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Corp. For the
first time, they're aggressively advertising some of their
cars as American-built.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Honda, for example, is using two-page magazine spreads to
tout its new Accord wagon as "The amazing new car from Ohio
that goes around corners, up hills and overseas." The ad
notes that Honda makes the Accord wagon in just one factory
-- Marysville, Ohio -- and that from there the car is
exported to Europe and Japan.
   Meanwhile Nissan is airing, in the Midwest only,
television commercials that show a Toyota Corolla, Honda
Civic, Ford Escort and Nissan Sentra driving around a track
in a fuel-economy contest. After the Corolla and Civic run
out of gas, an offscreen voice declares: "In fact, this
year's winner wasn't built in Japan. And it wasn't the Ford
Escort either." Instead, the winner is the "all-new,
American-built Nissan Sentra."
   These pitches represent a big switch in marketing tactics
for Nissan and Honda. In the mid-1980s they seemed to
soft-pedal the fact that some of their vehicles were made in
America. They didn't want buyers to worry that those cars and
trucks might be of lower quality than the ones imported from
Japan.
   And as Japanese companies took a record 28% of the U.S.
car market last year, Detroit moved to distance some of its
brands from the "domestic car" label.
   General Motors Corp.'s Saturn subsidiary, which is aimed
at attracting import buyers, carefully keeps the parent
company's name out of its advertising. And GM's Chevrolet
division created the Geo brand to highlight the fact that
some of its cars are made not by GM but by GM's Japanese
affiliates and partners.
   Still, "there is some tugging at the heart strings to
support American products," says Eric Conn, a senior
advertising manager at Honda. That's particularly true in
such Midwestern states as Ohio, Indiana and Michigan, which
have been among the toughest markets for the Japanese auto
makers to crack.
   During the 1980s Midwest sales didn't matter much to the
Japanese, because their car shipments to the U.S. were
restricted and they never had enough to go around. But now
seven Japanese auto makers build cars or trucks in the U.S.,
which means they have plenty of vehicles to sell. And while
Nissan and Honda started their campaigns before the Gulf war
began, experts say the recent rise in patriotic fervor makes
"buy American" seem like the right theme for the times.
   But there's a risk: A non-U.S. based company, particularly
one owned by the Japanese, might come across as trying to be
something it isn't. "You have to be cautious of the character
and style of the campaign," says Stephen A. Greyser,
professor of consumer marketing at Harvard Business School.
"Some consumers may see it as pandering to flag waving or
another effort at exploitation."
   Some Japanese auto makers agree and want no part of the
Honda and Nissan approach. Mazda Motor Corp. has no plans to
advertise that the Mazda 626 and MX-6 are built in Flat Rock,
Mich., says spokesman Thomas McDonald.
   "We don't hide the fact that they're made in America," Mr.
McDonald says. "But it's dangerous to make knee-jerk changes
in advertising. It's a very shallow effort."
   Mr. Greyser, however, says such marketing tactics, if
tastefully done, can be effective. A foreign-based
manufacturer, he explains, can market the "realities of the
company," such as where the product is built, the fact that
American jobs are created and other related items.
   That's the story Honda's U.S. sales and manufacturing arm
says it wants to tell. Honda views itself as different from
other Japanese auto makers because it was the first one to
build cars in America (back in 1982) and because more than
half of the cars it sells in the U.S. are made in America.
   "Japanese companies so often are visualized as one, as a
single unit," says the company's Mr. Conn. "We aren't one
mass group. We're very proud of our contributions to the U.S.
We've earned the right to be here." He says Honda had wanted
to get its message out sooner but has struggled for years to
find a way to say it.
   The Accord wagon provides a handy vehicle, so to speak,
because it's the first Honda engineered and designed in the
U.S. (though only partially so) as well as built in America.
"It is all part of our commitment," Honda's ad concludes, "to
building a self-reliant car company in the United States that
can compete with any auto maker. Anywhere." In a related
series of ads, Honda also boasts that it exports its
American-made motorcycles and lawn mowers to a variety of
overseas markets. Honda's advertising was created by Rubin
Postaer &amp; Associates of Los Angeles, its long-time agency.
   Nissan's made-in-America commercial, unlike Honda's
advertising, appears only in parts of the Midwest, mainly
Ohio and Michigan. Being American-made "isn't much of an
issue outside that region," says John Rinek, Nissan's
national advertising manager. The advertising was created by
Nissan's agency, Chiat/Day/Mojo of Los Angeles.
   While other Japanese companies aren't following Nissan and
Honda, at least one Midwest Isuzu dealership is. It's John
Rogin Buick &amp; Isuzu of Wayne, Mich., a blue-collar suburb of
Detroit. Once a customer refused to buy a Buick from the
dealership, says general sales manager Lou Ward, because of
the dual franchise with Isuzu.
   So for the past several months the dealership has stated
in its local newspaper advertising that Isuzu Motors Ltd. is
partially owned (34.2%) by GM. The advertising also notes
that the Isuzu Rodeo off-road vehicle is built in the U.S. --
at Isuzu's plant in Lafayette, Ind. "People who wouldn't
consider buying one because they thought it was an import
might consider buying one now," explains Mr. Ward. "It would
make a big difference if {Isuzu} advertised this in the
region."
   American Isuzu, the Japanese company's U.S. marketing arm,
says it doesn't plan such a campaign, though it applauds
Rogin's ingenuity. "The Midwest is a tough market," says
Richard Gillmore, director of marketing services at Isuzu.
"If I were in {Rogin's} shoes, I wouldn't hesitate to do the
same."

   Beach Demands $1 Million
                                                                                                       

   Bruce Beach, who resigned as managing director of Ogilvy &amp;
Mather's Chicago office last month, is demanding $1 million
in an arbitration proceeding against Ogilvy and parent WPP
Group.
   Ogilvy said last month that Mr. Beach was leaving for
personal reasons. But in his demand for arbitration, Mr.
Beach says WPP "considerably diminished" his autonomy and
control over the Chicago office. He claims he is due the $1
million under a severance agreement that guarantees him twice
his annual salary if his "responsibility, authority,
autonomy, title" or other benefits are reduced.
   Mr. Beach charges, among other things, that WPP
"instituted substantial adverse changes" by interfering with
profit-setting, hiring and firing, and by eliminating fringe
benefits like first class air travel. He claims that WPP's
chief executive, Martin Sorrell, interfered with his
authority by, for example, meeting with executives at client
NutraSweet without consulting him. WPP declined comment.

   New Yorker Picks Goodby
                                                                                                       

   The New Yorker magazine awarded its ad account to Goodby,
Berlin &amp; Silverstein, San Francisco, bringing to an end a
long relationship with executives who worked at the former
Lord Geller agency.
   The account had been handled from 1972 through 1988 by
Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein. When several top Lord
Geller executives quit in 1988 to form their own agency,
Lord, Einstein, O'Neill &amp; Partners, the magazine followed,
becoming one of the new agency's first accounts. Lord
Einstein earlier this month was merged and renamed Lord,
Dentsu &amp; Partners. Lord Dentsu pitched the account, along
with three other well-regarded small agencies: Deutsch,
McCabe &amp; Co. and Omon.
   Steve Florio, the magazine's president and chief executive
officer, said he had put the account up for review because
key people on the account left when Lord Einstein was merged
into Lord Dentsu. He said he was impressed that Goodby
Berlin's principals "all read the New Yorker and understand
the culture of the magazine." The magazine, published by
Advance Publications, has spent as much as $3 million on
advertising in past years, but Mr. Florio said current
spending is in the $500,000 range.

   NEW ACCOUNTS: Carvel Corp., Yonkers, N.Y., pulled its $6
million ad account from Hal Riney &amp; Partners' New York office
and awarded it to TBWA Advertising. Industry executives said
personnel changes at the client and at Riney were factors in
the switch. Carvel, a unit of Investcorp, said only that it
reviewed the account because of a planned "repositioning" of
the business; it wouldn't elaborate.
                                                                                                       

   Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco pulled its estimated $8 million
to $10 million Raleigh cigarette account from
Campbell-Mithun-Esty, New York, and awarded it to Geer,
DuBois, New York.
                                                                                                       

   EARNINGS: Omnicom Group, New York, said fourth-quarter net

   For more than a decade, Rose Hoffman nosed
around biker bars, braved threats and talked to virtually everyone
she met in an effort to find her son.
   Her quest ended this month when three men were convicted of
sodomizing and murdering 20-year-old Gus Hoffman Jr. and stealing
his motorcycle.
   His mother's ordeal began in 1978, when the young man didn't
return to his San Jose home the night of July 4.
   ``We're a very close family, and when your son doesn't come home
all night, you right then know something is definitely wrong,''
Mrs. Hoffman said. ``I would brag he was home every night, and I
would say at least I know where he is.''
   Hoffman was last seen on his rebuilt Harley-Davidson motorcycle
at a San Jose intersection. Witnesses said he was being chased by
two other motorcycles and a car filled with people. Neither his
body nor the motorcycle was ever found.
   ``My son was a very gullible young kid. He helped a lot of
people in his life. He had a heart of gold,'' Mrs. Hoffman said.
``The bike was the reason he was killed. He spent almost all his
money ... on that bike. He only had it running for three weeks, and
then he was missing.''
   Immediately after their son's disappearance, the Hoffmans hired
private investigators, sent out fliers and offered rewards. Mrs.
Hoffman, now 55, began checking out biker bars and other places
zfor information.
   ``I didn't care if I went into a grocery store or liquor store,
I talked to people,'' she said. ``I just would not give up. I'm
very, very persistent. He was my son. ... What would you do for
your son?''
   She said she was threatened and told to stop asking questions.
``But it didn't bother me,'' she said, adding that ``there are a
lot of good bikers out there.''
   The case had been assigned as well to police, who didn't find
much. But Mrs. Hoffman kept dogging them to pursue the case. On her
own, she learned that a man named Michael Lee Stevenson might have
had something to do with her son's disappearance.
   In 1987, the San Jose Police Department's homicide chief, in an
attempt to close the books on old cases by assigning them to night
detectives, gave the case to Sgts. Jack Baxter and Jeff Ouimet.
They took it from there.
   ``We knew we had leads and witnesses to talk to, which led us to
other witnesses,'' Ouimet said. ``There was a ray of hope there
which felt pretty good.''
   A key prosecution witness turned up: the ex-wife of suspect
Richard Morris Dollar, who said she witnessed the attack.
   Deputy District Attorney Don Shearer said the woman, whose name
was withheld, had kept silent for years for fear of retribution
from Stevenson and the legal system.
   But Stevenson, in whose garage the assault is believed to have
occurred, was shot to death in 1986 by an elderly man after trying
to shake down the man's son, Shearer said.
   In 1988, Dollar and two other alleged motorcycle gang members
were arrested in Gus Hoffman's slaying.
   Dollar, 34, Michael Allen Hodges, 38, and John Michael Stelle,
49, face a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole at
sentencing Oct. 17.
   Hodges' attorney, Francis Cavagnaro, said he will seek a new
trial.
   ``It did not bring our son back,'' Mrs. Hoffman said of the
conviction. ``But we did what we could to get justice, and our
prayers were answered.''

<CAPTION>  Photo; PHOTO: Associated Press; HELMET BACKER -- Actor Gary Busey supports the
state's mandatory helmet law.  </CAPTION>
<DESCRIPT>  CALIFORNIA; VEHICLE; SAFETY; EQUIPMENT; LAW; CONTROVERSY  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  With his shiny black Harley Davidson beneath him, leather-clad biker Baldy Lox
gave voice to the anger felt by thousands of motorcyclists over the impending
enforcement of California's mandatory helmet law.;   "This country just isn't
as free as people think it is," said Lox, of Van Nuys, explaining his
opposition to the law that orders him to wear a helmet as of Jan. 1.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  California News  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  MUCH-DEBATED BIKER-HELMET LAW TAKES EFFECT JAN. 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "It's a matter of freedom of choice, and it should be my decision," he
said.;   But underscoring the volatility of the helmet debate, Mary Price of
Sacramento described a different kind of anger, stemming from the death of her
son -- who wasn't wearing a helmet -- as a result of a motorcycle accident.;  
"He exercised his freedom of choice not to wear that helmet. And after raising
him nearly 19 years, I had no son," Price said. "I decided to exercise my
freedom of choice and try to get a helmet law.";   Son died in collision;  
Her son, Jimmy Holquin, died in September 1985 when his motorcycle collided
with a car that turned in front of him. After the accident, Price lobbied hard
for passage of the mandatory helmet law that will take effect next month.;   A
lawsuit seeking to overturn the law has been filed in Orange County. But
barring an unexpected injunction, all motorcyclists and their passengers will
be required to strap on a helmet beginning Jan. 1.;   The helmet law will
apply to anyone who sits astride a motorcycle in California -- from the
Hollywood bikers dressed in leather, long hair flowing in the wind as they
ride on the throaty roar of a  low-slung Harley, to mom-and-pop duos wearing
matching jumpsuits as they cruise on the well-cushioned purr of a wide-body
touring cycle.;   Failure to obey the law can result in a fine of up to $100
for the first offense, $200 for the second offense and $250 for subsequent
offenses. Court fees will about double the penalties.;   Violation of the law
could also affect motorcyclists' insurance rates. Bill Madison, a spokesman
for the Department of Motor Vehicles, said the department will make a final
decision this month, but it is "leaning toward assessing a (violation) point
for anyone not wearing a helmet.";   Joins other states;   With enactment of
the law, California -- which had previously required helmets only for those 15
1/2 or younger -- joins the ranks of states that require all riders to wear
helmets.;   But while 23 other states already have similar helmet laws on the
books, the effect of the law will be greater in California, where roughly 20
percent of the nation's motorcycles are registered.;   To those who have long
ridden the state's roads with the wind in their hair, the new law threatens
what many considered a birthright.;   "Feel the wind, man, that's the whole
joy of it," said motorcyclist Gene Swinnie of suburban Lakewood. "They're
taking all the enjoyment out of it. And that's not fair.";   Two themes;  
Those who disagree with the helmet law primarily base their opposition on two
themes -- personal freedom of choice and challenges to the claimed safety
benefits of wearing helmets.;   "It's not a good law for a number of reasons,"
said Paul Lax, California director of ABATE -- American Brotherhood Aimed
Toward Education. "This law involves what I consider an unprecedented degree
of government interference with personal rights.;   "They're saying, 'Because
we don't think you have enough sense to do this, we're going to make you,' "
Lax said. "But if you accept that rationale, you have allowed that to override
individual rights.";   Don and Lucy Lawson of Glen Avon, near Riverside, wear
helmets at all times. An accident on a narrow highway to Lake Tahoe convinced
them their decision was correct.;   Still, Don Lawson disagrees with the law:
"I would not ride without a helmet, but I think we should have the choice.";  
Or, as biker Jesse Aguilar bluntly put it: "If somebody wants to go and
splatter their brains out there, it's their decision.";   Opponents of the
helmet law have some high-profile supporters. One is rock star Billy Idol, who
says he doesn't wear a helmet even after a February 1990 accident in which he
severely injured his right leg.;   Busey backs law;   Actor Gary Busey, who
suffered severe head injuries in a December 1988 crash, initially was against
a mandatory law. But now he supports it.;   To those who pushed for the law,
while the helmet law may take away each individual's right to choose, the
benefits to the whole of society outweigh any loss of personal freedom.;   "It
is the duty of the state to enact laws for common good," said Bob Terry, a
legislative aide to state Assemblyman Richard Floyd, D-Gardena, author of the
helmet law.;   "We enact laws that prevent you from skateboarding on the
freeway," Terry said. "They don't allow pedestrians on the freeway. And that
interferes with the right of the skateboarder, the pedestrian.;   "All of
these laws are for the common good," he said.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>U.S.-Made Hondas Coming To Japan, Sign Of New Direction In Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of thriving on a booming export trade,
it might seem odd for Honda Motor Co. Ltd. to celebrate the first
arrival here of U.S.-built Honda automobiles.
   But for the company and the domestic economy, today's
celebration over the shipload of 540 Hondas built in Marysville,
Ohio, marked more than a simple welcoming party.
   For Honda, the shipment signaled maturity for a company that in
two decades has transformed itself from a respected motorcycle
maker into a worldwide maker of attractive cars.
   In a broader sense, the imported Hondas reflected ongoing
changes in the surprisingly robust Japanese economy, which is being
fuled more by domestic demand than because of exports, its
longstanding source of growth.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange has surged back from last October's
worldwide crash. On Thursday the Nikkei Stock Average surpassed its
previous high, which was set on Oct. 14. The New York and London
exchange indexes are still about 10 percent below pre-crash levels.
   Japan's gross national product grew at a vibrant rate estimated
at 7 percent to 8 percent in the last quarter of fiscal 1987-88,
which ended March 31. Official figures aren't yet published. Most
analysts expect it to expand at over 4 percent in the new fiscal
year.
   The Japanese consumer _ the same Japanese whose propensity to
save is legendary _ is changing. The car that Honda is importing is
the Accord coupe, a type of car that hasn't been much favored by
Japanese buyers, who traditionally have gone for four-door family
sedans.
   But in recent years, as the strong yen has greatly increased the
wealth of some Japanese, sportier cars have been selling better,
and the Honda Accord coupe is aimed at that increasing market.
   Still, why not make it in Japan?
   Honda spokesman Bret Anderson explained: ``This particular car,
the coupe, is completely designed and set up by American Honda,
with American R&amp;D (research and development) and engineering. So we
don't have facilities in Japan to build it. It was built for the
U.S. market. We see the car as an American car.''
   The company saw the growing demand in Japan and ``thought that
it probably would sell,'' he said. The company predicts sales in
1988 of the American-made coupe at 4,000, and hopes sales will grow
to 50,000 in 1991.
   The Japanese domestic car market is the second biggest in the
world after the United States, where Japan has an export quota of
2.3 million cars a year.
   Oddly, Honda sells more cars in the United States, about 740,000
last year, than in Japan, about 365,000. Importing the Accord coupe
is part of the company's drive to increase its domestic market
share.
   The U.S. price for the Accord coupe is about $15,000; its price
in Japan hasn't been announced.
   The Japanese economy has spurted ahead on a combination of the
high yen and some pump-priming undertaken by the Japanese
government last spring when it looked as if 1987 might be a
recession year.
   On Thursday, the Japanese parliament enacted another mildly
expansionary budget of 56.7 trillion yen ($453.6 billion), up 4.8
percent from the earlier year.
   The new budget includes a big increase in public works spending,
up 19.7 percent at 7.3 trillion yen ($58.4 billion), to keep
domestic demand high.
   A strong factor fueling growth last year was private-sector
housing investment, which leaped 21.7 percent, according to Fuji
Bank economists. They predicted in early April that the economy
would expand at a 4.1 percent rate in fiscal 1988-89, inflation
would be only 0.9 percent, and the dollar would average 122 yen,
close to its recent level of 123-125 yen.
   A projection by the respected Okasan Research Institute
predicted 4.5 percent growth. The Okasan and Fuji projections
agreed that private housing would stall after its hot performance
in the previous year, but that personal spending and corporate
capital investment would continue to fuel growth.
   The Okasan think tank said domestic demand would push the
economy up 5.6 percent while external demand _ exports _ would
shrink and reduce the economy's growth by 1.1 percent.
   Okasan expected the trade surplus to drop from $93.3 billion in
the past fiscal year to $87.7 billion, and the dollar to average
124 yen.

Beals Takes Harley-Davidson on New Road

<TEXT>
   Vaughn L. Beals Jr. got up at a Washington news conference earlier this week and offered to give up what many U.S. chief executives would dearly love to have -- a stiff tariff against foreign competitors. 

   The chairman and chief executive officer of Harley-Davidson Inc., the Milwaukee-based motorcycle maker, said his company doesn't need the final year of a five-year tariff aimed at big Japanese motorcycles, and he asked the International Trade Commission to cancel it. 

   The move brought immediate praise from Congress and gave a boost to controversial efforts to aid other battered domestic industries with trade legislation. 
Mr. Beals's offer to drop the tariff early "is the kind of attitude in American business that we need," says an aide to Sen. John Heinz of Pennsylvania, a Republican who backed Harley's efforts to get the tariff in 1983. 
Harley's move shows that a tariff can be a short-term tonic to a company, Sen. Heinz feels, and needn't become a permanent lifeline, as opponents to such measures have warned. 

   But the 59-year-old Mr. Beals didn't bring his company back from the brink of collapse by giving away competitive advantages, nor is he doing so now. 
His plea to terminate the tariff is more intended to portray Harley as a Chrysler Corp. on two wheels. 

   Mr. Beals concedes that the tariff, which falls to 10% from 15% April 1, is at this point worth little or nothing to Harley, the only remaining U.S. motorcycle maker. 
And some say it was never essential to Harley's survival. 
"I think they could have pulled it off without the tariff," says Kevin Bahr, a securities analyst who follows Harley at Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. in Milwaukee. 

   Rather, Mr. Bahr says, it was Harley's streamlining of its manufacturing process and improvement of quality that saved the company. 
Some of the measures, such as so-called just-in-time inventory control, are patterned after Japanese industrial practices. 

   Though Mr. Beals was saying in Washington that the tariff had given Harley a "respite from predatory import practices," the company noted in its stock offering last summer that "the benefits . . . from the special tariff have been limited." 

   A spokeswoman at the trade agency said yesterday that Harley hasn't yet filed its request to cancel the tariff and that, when it does, the agency will need at least three months to research the request and then make a recommendation to President Reagan. 

   Mr. Beals says that making such a request has been under consideration for several months, but that he wanted to wait until just before the tariff levels were lowered to 10%, when the tariff won't be "worth a whole bunch." 

   Mr. Beals, himself an avid rider of Harley's big Electra Glide, or "hog" cycles, led a management buyout of Harley from its then-parent, AMF Inc., in 1981. 
Almost immediately, high interest rates, a soft market for big cycles and a global war for market share among the much bigger Japanese motorcycle brands, Honda and Yamaha, threatened to send Harley to the junkyard. 

   The two Japanese makers were rapidly introducing new models and cutting prices. 
Their U.S. inventories were bulging, threatening still more price cuts. 
"When the elephants dance, the ants get trampled," Mr. Beals says. 
Harley also was still dogged by a 1970s reputation for uneven workmanship. 

   President Reagan granted the company tariffs on imported cycles with engines of 700 cubic centimeters or bigger, known as heavyweight cycles, beginning at 45% of wholesale prices and falling year by year to 35%, 20%, 15%, 10%, and ending in April 1988. 

   But, Mr. Beals notes, that was easily skirted. 
Japanese makers quickly began building so-called "tariff busters" -- cycles with engines between 690 and 699 cubic centimeters. 
And the glut of Japanese cycles already in the country wasn't affected. 
"I'd bet my net worth," Mr. Beals says, that some Japanese dealers are still selling "new" cycles that were imported before the tariff. 

   As a result of the improved manufacturing techniques he installed at Harley, Mr. Beals's net worth is now considerable. 
His 15.9% stake in Harley's almost six million shares, which went public last summer, had a value of about $12 million at yesterday's closing price of $13.50, up 25 cents, in American Stock Exchange composite trading. 

   Mr. Bahr says that's a rich price -- almost 16 times 1986 operating earnings of 82 cents a share, or $4.3 million -- for a company in a mature industry, but adds that "there is still kind of a mystique -- the only motorcycle company in America." 
Sales last year were $295.3 million and market share rose to about 19% from a 1983 low of 12.5%, Mr. Beals says. 

   Mr. Beals monitors quality by doing his business travel, weather permitting, on a "hog." 
On a recent trip from San Francisco to Denver with his wife, Eleanor, he discovered a defect in the 1986-model seat: the rear, or passenger, seat tilted forward and Mrs. Beals's helmet kept bumping his whenever he hit the brakes. 
They stopped in Reno, Nev., to call the factory, but test riders there had already found the flaw.

   Honda Revs Up 

   A Hip Cycle Campaign 

   HONDA MOTOR Co., hoping to recruit a new generation of motorcycle riders, is making a big push to overcome cycling's black-leather-jacket stigma. 

   Like other motorcycle makers, Honda's U.S. division has been fighting sharp declines in motorcycle sales and the image problem that just won't go away. 

   Sales of motorcycles, scooters and all-terrain vehicles have dropped 45.6% since 1984, according to the Motorcycle Industry Council. 
About 710,000 units were sold in 1988, down from 1,305,000 units in 1984. 

   Motorcycle makers say the sales decline is due in part to the industry's heavy reliance on advertising in magazines that appeal to cycle enthusiasts but don't reach the mainstream public. 

   To try to change the demographics, Honda is spending $75 million. 
Central to its marketing campaign is the introduction of a new touring motorcycle called the Pacific Coast, the establishment of rider education centers and fresh advertising. 

   The company is going for the young and hip, with ads in magazines like GQ and Esquire and on television shows like "thirtysomething" and "L.A. 
Law." 
In 1979, the average motorcycle rider was 25 to 29 years old; today the average age is 35 to 40. 

   The latest Honda ads invite consumers to "Come ride with us." 
That may sound familiar to consumers with long memories. 
The strategy, Honda readily admits, is similar to its 1950s campaign that boasted, "You meet the nicest people on a Honda," and successfully attracted a new group of riders back then. 

   In one of the new TV ads, actress Courteney Cox of NBC's "Family Ties" promotes responsible riding and recommends proper safety gear and clothing. 
Another ad features Larry "Bud" Melman, David Letterman's late-night sidekick. 

   "This is an invitational program introducing people to a side of motorcycling they may have not seen or thought about before," says Ray Blank, assistant vice president at American Honda. 

   Other motorcycle makers aim to draw a new breed of customer, too. 
Says Bob Moffit, a vice president at Kawasaki Motors Corp. U.S.A., "We are trying to focus more on the experience of motorcycling and not dwell so much on the hardware." 

   Green Products Sprout 

   In North America 

   GREEN PRODUCTS are being introduced in North America at a fast clip, growing from only 55 in 1985 to an estimated 706 by the end of 1989, according to Marketing Intelligence Service in Naples, N.Y. 

   Green products are promoted as "environmentally friendly," and marketing experts say the green trend, which is well under way in Europe, is just now taking off in the U.S. and Canada. 
Procter &amp; Gamble Co., for example, has started selling Spic 'n Span in a plastic bottle that can be recycled. 

   But most of the green products are coming from smaller companies. 
Melitta U.S.A., the Cherry Hill, N.J., maker of coffee makers and filters, recently introduced Natural Brown filters made from natural unbleached paper pulp. 
Poly-Tech Inc., Minneapolis, is marketing Ruffies, biodegradable trash bags, and ISE of America Inc., Lakewood, N.J., is selling eggs in clear plastic cartons that can be recycled. 
ISE is promoting the eggs as the ones in "the honest egg carton." 

   "Smaller North American manufacturers are discovering that the conservationist ethic sells new products," says Richard Lawrence, president of Marketing Intelligence. 

   Ailing Hospital Ads 

   Need Intensive Care 

   CONSUMERS have a lot to say about hospital advertising -- and most of it isn't very nice. 

   Useless, boring, unclear and uninformative are just a few of the adjectives people came up with when interviewed for a study on hospital marketing. 

   The study by Consumer Network Inc., Philadelphia, found that more than eight out of 10 respondents are turned off by "mushy" hospital advertising slogans. 
One theme, "We Care," received especially negative reactions from skeptical consumers. 

   Just a few years ago, advertising was foreign terrain to most hospitals. 
But today, 91% of all U.S. hospitals have marketing programs, spending a total of $1.6 billion, according to Consumer Network. 
About $500 million of that goes for advertising. 

   But along the way, hospitals got wrapped up in image advertising that missed the mark with consumers, the study says. 
Consumers are most interested in ads with information on prices, number of hospital beds and specialized medical services. 

   Some hospital advertising executives agree that marketing remedies are needed. 
"There is a lot of learning to do before we consider ourselves sophisticated marketers," says Neal Westermeyer, vice president at Humana Inc., a large hospital chain based in Louisville, Ky. 
"I don't think we do a good enough job researching how to identify the real target groups for the marketing of distinctive services." 

   Odds and Ends 

   EVER WONDER what happens to the holes in the middle of Life Savers candy? 
Well, now you can buy them. 
RJR Nabisco Inc. will test market Life Savers Holes in limited areas starting in November. . . . 
How a man shaves may be a telling clue to his age. 
According to a survey by Mediamark Research Inc., use of disposable razors is heavy among 18- to 24-year-olds, razor blades are particularly popular among 45- to 54-year-olds, and electric razors are the top choice of men 55 and up.

BIKERS: OWNERS OF THE ROCK STORE, A CAFE AND GROCERY THAT DRAWS MOTORCYCLE 
ENTHUSIASTS, SAY THEY'RE LOSING BUSINESS BECAUSE OF A CHP ROADBLOCK AIMED AT 
STOPPING MOTORCYCLE RACING ON A STRETCH OF MULHOLLAND HIGHWAY.

<P>
Hare Kokkinos, a Northridge carpenter taking a break from his latest weekend 
motorcycle odyssey, stood outside the Rock Store and described how Sunday 
afternoons used to be at one of best-known biker pit stops in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"This place was packed with metal; motorcycles were everywhere," said Kokkinos, 
nodding at a long parking lot off Mulholland Highway that fronts the store 
about two miles south of Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"It was wall-to-wall bikers." 
</P>
<P>
But lately, Sunday parking has been easy at the Rock Store, a small cafe and 
grocery that draws a wildly eclectic mix of middle-aged pleasure cyclists, 
Hells Angels and upscale "yuppie bikers," including Hollywood figures such as 
comic Jay Leno and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Far fewer motorcyclists rumble 
in now, say the store's owners, Ed and Veronica Savko, who blame a determined 
-- and controversial -- California Highway Patrol effort to stop motorcycle 
racing along the highway's scenic but deadly curves. 
</P>
<P>
For the last 10 weeks, the CHP has erected roadblocks every Sunday along a 
two-mile stretch of Mulholland about 200 yards west of the Rock Store. And 
although authorities say the tactic has eliminated racing, the Rock Store's 
proprietors say it is strangling their long-established business. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm down about 85%," said Veronica, who with her husband has run the Rock 
Store for 28 years and is usually known simply as "Vern." 
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to force us out of business," Ed insisted. "You wonder if this 
is a police state or something." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, several hundred motorcyclists showed up at the Rock Store for a 
bluegrass jam benefiting a bikers organization that opposes drunk driving. But 
many in the crowd also wanted to show support for the Savkos and to vent anger 
at the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
"The Highway Patrol is not out for a good purpose," snapped a middle-aged 
motorcyclist from Santa Monica who identified himself only as Joe. 
</P>
<P>
"They totaled three patrol cars out here chasing motorcyclists," he said, and 
that made the CHP angry. 
</P>
<P>
In August the Highway Patrol began closing Mulholland, between Kanan Road and 
Seminole Springs Road, every Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. to all but residents 
and those with business in the area. The roadblocks, which are to be lifted 
Oct. 29, were undertaken as a test program approved by Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP acted because racing "was just getting intolerable," said Capt. Richard 
Kerri, commander of the patrol's West Valley region. 
</P>
<P>
Crashes and injuries were common -- two or three each Sunday, Kerri said. On 
some Sundays, he said, as many as 200 people gathered at an overlook to watch 
the racers speed along the highway, a hilly, twisting road with eye-popping 
views of canyons. So numerous were bikers that some local residents were afraid 
to take their cars on the road, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In response, the CHP began stationing two officers, one at each end of the 
roadblock, who stop bikers and tell them the road is closed. If the cyclists 
are trying to reach the Rock Store, they're told of an alternate route, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The action, Kerri said, has ended racing. "We have in effect taken the race 
track away from them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the roadblock didn't stop a large crowd from attending Sunday's 
benefit. The store's parking lot was dense with bikers checking out each 
other's leathers and eyeing a gleaming fleet of Harley Davidsons, BSAs and 
Kawasakis. At least one Hells Angel was in attendance, along with a couple 
wearing black leather vests proclaiming them members of the Christian 
Motorcycle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The Savkos and many of their biker-customers agree that something needed to be 
done to slow down racers, especially young men -- some in their teens -- who 
favor high-powered "bullet bikes" that can rocket along at up to 160 m.p.h. 
Older bikers disparagingly refer to such riders as "squids" because, as one 
disapproving middle-aged cyclist put it, "they're all over the road." 
</P>
<P>
But the Savkos and many Rock Store customers believe that roadblocks are an 
unnecessarily Draconian way to handle the problem. Racers could just as easily 
be controlled, they argue, by installing speed bumps or posting officers with 
radar guns along the road. 
</P>
<P>
"No one questions the rationale for the roadblocks. But there is a question of 
if this is the right way to control speeders," said Dean Rigsby, a 
schoolteacher who visits the Rock Store from his home in the Central Valley 
town of Manteca aboard a black Yamaha 920. 
</P>
<P>
Kerri counters that Los Angeles County is reluctant to install speed bumps for 
fear of exposing the county to lawsuits from motorcyclists who might slip on 
them and crash. Speed guns would be ineffective, he added, because of the 
overwhelming number of bikers who formerly used Mulholland. 
</P>
<P>
The Savkos also complain that CHP officers frequently harass customers at their 
store and at the roadblock, ticketing them for infractions such as crooked 
license-plate holders or inadequately muffled engines. 
</P>
<P>
"Just crazy things. Just plain harassment," said Veronica Savko. 
</P>
<P>
The couple claims that contrary to Kerri's assertion, officers at the roadblock 
don't inform bikers of an alternate route to the Rock Store -- only that 
Mulholland is closed. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Savko contends that officers "don't like my clientele," wrongly believing 
they are trouble-making, greasy jeaned outlaws straight out of the movie "The 
Wild One." Many Rock Store patrons, he and his wife said, are white-collar 
professionals: doctors, lawyers and entertainment-industry employees. 
</P>
<P>
"The police can't understand why there's never any trouble here," Veronica 
Savko said. "There's no gangs. If the Hells Angels come up here, they take off 
their jackets." 
</P>
<P>
But Kerri said he has no ax to grind against the Savkos or their customers. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel bad about their business. . . . They're caught up in this and their 
business is suffering. It's just fallout of our trying to prevent accidents out 
there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While some nearby residents agree with the Savkos that the roadblocks are too 
harsh, others applaud them, saying the move has eliminated a major public 
safety problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw many accidents from my driveway . . . saw these kids all broken up and 
dying," said Lawrence Casey, a construction manager whose home is on 
Mulholland. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, racing "doesn't exist now." 
</P>
<P>
"We're so glad you're here," called a middle-aged woman to a CHP officer 
manning the roadblock Sunday, as she turned her car into a nearby mobile home 
park. 
</P>
<P>
The Savkos claim that Antonovich backs the roadblocks because developers are 
pressuring him to get rid of the Rock Store and its leather-jacketed customers, 
fearing that they might scare off potential buyers of new luxury homes in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
But Leeta Pistone, an Antonovich aide, characterized that allegation as 
"absolutely false." 
</P>
<P>
"The kind of people that go up there are 99% family bikers," she said. "They're 
nice people. They're not people Mike would want out of there." 
</P>
<P>
The supervisor decided to support the roadblocks after hearing that in a single 
Sunday, CHP officers were drawn into three high-speed chases with racers, 
Pistone said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the racing problem has been quelled and the roadblocks are scheduled 
to be lifted, Kerri said they may be reimposed if daredevil antics resume. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, longtime fans of the Rock Store hope it can survive the 
drop-off in business. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a beautiful joint," said actor Robert Blake, who for years rode a 
Harley Electraglide to the store but now travels aboard an Appaloosa. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an elegant place. To try and close it down is just the heartbreak of all 
time, ain't it?" 
</P>

   EUREKA SPRINGS, Ark. -- Unshaven, his sandy hair lapping
over the collar of his weathered denim vest, Herbie Shreve
roars into town on his Harley-Davidson, prompting a few
stares from the busloads of Bible Belt churchgoers here for
the outdoor passion play, one of the chief attractions of
this Ozark tourist haven.
   Mr. Shreve, however, has business elsewhere. He heads his
motorcycle down a gravel road rutted like a washboard and
pitches a tent in a lakeside clearing where hundreds of other
bikers have gathered for a boozy weekend rally. Here, he will
spend the next 48 hours as he spends most weekends: trying to

   Biking and Bibles would seem an unlikely combination. But

33-year-old Mr. Shreve is no purse-lipped, fire-and-brimstone
evangelist. Eschewing what he calls the pushy "vacuum cleaner
salesman" approach, he's as adept at "kickin' tires" --
talking shop with other bikers -- as he is at quoting
Scripture.
   The CMA encampments that are fixtures at most motorcycle
events nowadays provide free ice water and Biblical tracts,
as well as volunteers eager to preach the Gospel should a
biker amble by. But there is no hard sell. "They will seek us
out when it's the right time," Mr. Shreve says serenely.
   Mr. Shreve is thus able to mingle easily with people like
"Cowboy," a towering, long-haired biker from Little Rock who
rides with the tough Bandido club. "As long as he doesn't try
to judge me, we get along fine," Cowboy says of Mr. Shreve.
"I'm a Christian and not ashamed of it," he says. "I just
live differently than the CMAers do. They stick closer to the
rules."
   CMA was founded by Mr. Shreve's Baptist-preacher father,
Herb Sr., who took up motorcycling to draw closer to his
then-rebellious teen-age son. As the pair biked around the
heartland, often snubbed by fellow Christians when they tried
to attend church along the way, the preacher hatched plans
for a motorcycle ministry. "Jesus said, `Go on the highways
and hedges,' and that always stuck with me," says the elder
Mr. Shreve. "I felt churches ought to be wherever the people
were."
   So in 1975, he resigned from his church in Cove, Ark.,
moved his family out of a comfortable parsonage and took to
the road. The pastor's wife, Shirley, who found herself
suddenly supporting the family with Tupperware parties, gave
him one month to make good.
   The group has since grown to 33,000 members in more than
300 chapters in the U.S. and Canada, Herbie Shreve says.
   To get to Eureka Springs, Herbie Shreve and his wife,
Diane, have cycled four hours from their home in Hatfield,
Ark., where CMA is headquartered. At the campground, they
rendezvous with about 20 CMA compatriots and plunge into the
festivities: a noisy parade through town, motorcycle games
and races. Vultures soar overhead, beer flows and a blues
band plays at top volume through the night.
   Some CMA members led rough-and-tumble lives prior to
joining up. "There were no warrants out on me, but I'd been
around the block a few times," says bearded Bill Wisely, a
hospital janitor in Jackson, Ark. Three years ago, he says,
"God started giving me the word it was time to turn my life
over to Him."
   Tonight, he talks not only of the bike show he helped
judge at the rally, but of "witnessing" to some attendees.
   Greg Heinritz of Oden, Ark., used to ride a bike painted
with images of nude women. Now the bike sports murals
depicting Jesus reaching down to bikers on the road. His
famous "Jesus bike," as it's known, has been on prominent
display at big rallies and featured as a "centerfold bike" in
many biker magazines.
   Mr. Heinritz now is a paid CMA evangelist -- and Herbie
Shreve says the bike led one of his young sons to accept
Christ.
   Plenty of CMAers are simply church people looking for a
wholesome crowd to ride with. Some shun what they call
"secular rallies," such as this one. Instead, they congregate
at CMA events that feature Bible study and Gospel music.
   CMA member Frances Wing of Cincinnati, Ark., prayed hard
before deciding to attend a secular rally. "The Lord and I
decided I shouldn't hold back," she recalls. Now she finds
that witnessing to the "down-and-outers" -- the CMA term for
hard cases and rough customers -- is easier than trying to
win converts among the prosperous professionals who have
taken up biking in recent years.
   "They think they are all right, that they're going to go
to heaven," Mrs. Wing says of the upscale crowd. The more
menacing bikers, on the other hand, "know they are sinners."
   During winter months, CMA runs weekend workshops where
skills such as witnessing in parking lots and "handling
negative responses" are honed. Members are also reminded not
to restrict their ministry to motorcyclists. As Herb Shreve
Sr. put it in a recent newsletter: "If Jesus physically lived
in America today and rode a motorcycle, would He witness only
to motorcyclists in America? No way]"
   CMA doesn't assess dues or collect offerings at the
services it holds at motorcycle rallies. Member donations
fund its $500,000 administrative budget, which covers the
salaries of its 13-member staff (including eight paid
evangelists), publication of tracts and a monthly newsletter.
   In addition, it sponsors an annual fundraiser in which CMA
members solicit pledges for completing a 100-mile motorcycle
run. This year's proceeds, $284,000, went mostly for foreign
missions, such as the purchase of motorcycles and even mules
for local ministers in Central America.
   The CMA rank-and-file, who call themselves "weekend
warriors," ride at their own expense. Typical is Dewell
Grisham of Little Rock, a retired installer for AT&amp;T who puts
in 20,000 miles a year on his bike in voluntary service to
CMA. "The pay's not too good," he chuckles.
   "Riding for the Son," the motto embossed on CMA T-shirts
and jackets, isn't easy riding. Severe thunderstorms doused
Herbie Shreve on his way to Eureka Springs. The weekend
before, he camped in a Kansas cornfield in 108-degree heat.
"There was gobs of nudity, and we woke up Sunday morning with
a guy passed out in front of our tent," he says. And two CMA
women at this rally were sidelined all summer after cycling
accidents.
   But no one in CMA, members say, has ever been harmed by a
biker. The closest call came in the early days, when drunken
revelers surrounded Herb and Shirley Shreve's tent at a rally
in Sturgis, S.D., and threatened to burn it down. "Some of
those same people are close friends of mine today," says the
elder Mr. Shreve, who is 56 years old.
   Motorcycle events in general are much tamer now, he adds.
   It is dawn in Eureka Springs, and the CMA contingent fans
out through the campground urging last night's carousers to
join them by the lake for a Sunday service. Four years ago at
this rally, no worshippers bestirred themselves from their
tents, and Herbie couldn't hold a service. Today, about 20
groggy bikers straggle down to the dock.
   Herbie's brief, plain-spoken sermon touches on the bikers'
alienation: the unpaid bills, the oppressive bosses, the
righteous church ladies "who are always mad and always
right." His message: "If you call me, I'll help you fix your
life."
   Though the weekend brings no dramatic victories, Herbie
isn't discouraged. "Always on Saturday," he says, "you begin
to think, `Is this panning out?'" Peer pressure keeps some
away from services, he says. "But they come by afterwards and
talk. We don't get in a hurry to leave on Sunday morning."
   Sure enough, while breaking camp, the CMA group gives away
half a case of tracts to bikers who drop by their tents. And
as Herbie pulls out to leave, two bikers call to him,
thanking him for his words. "I don't remember seeing them at
the service," he says. "You're covering a lot more ground
than you realize sometimes."
