<HEAD>Creator Of Kellogg's `Snap, Crackle And Pop' Characters Dies at 88</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Vernon Grant, creator of the Kellogg's
cereal characters Snap, Crackle and Pop and a longtime magazine and
book illustrator, has died. He was 88.
   He died Monday at a nursing home, where he had been for several
weeks.
   ``He was right up there with Norman Rockwell in the number of
covers he designed,'' said Linda Williams, chairwoman of the Vernon
Grant-Art Advisory Committee with the Museum of York County.
   The nursing home would not release a cause of death, but Ms.
Williams said he had been in declining health since he broke his
hip some months ago.
   Grant was born in Nebraska in 1902, and moved with his family to
California when he was a teen-ager. He studied at the University of
Southern California, and later at the Art Institute of Chicago.
   In 1932, a gnome figure he drew of Santa Claus landed on the
cover of Ladies' Home Journal and was a smashing success.
   A year later, inspired by a radio commercial for Kellogg's Rice
Krispies, he created the gnomelike characters of Snap, Crackle and
Pop. He submitted drawings to the company's ad agency.
   Overall, he designed 187 magazine covers from the 1930s to the
'50s, and illustrated children's books.
   In 1947, Grant and his wife, Elizabeth, moved to her hometown of
Rock Hill to raise their family and farm 600 acres. While living in
South Carolina, he developed a strain of grass and became known for
his conservation methods.
   Grant is survived by his wife, a son and a daughter.

<HEAD>No Snap, Crackle, Pop to Kellogg's B-Vitamin Claims, Attorney
General Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is no snap, crackle or pop to Kellogg
Co.'s claim that B-vitamins in its Rice Krispies cereal provide
pep, and the company has agreed to stop some of its advertising on
the claim, New York's attorney general said Wednesday.
   Kellogg, of Battle Creek, Mich., agreed Aug. 4 to stop all
advertising in New York that might mislead consumers about the
health benefits of Rice Krispies, said state Attorney General
Robert Abrams.
   Kellogg's ads had claimed B-vitamins in Rice Krispies would give
consumers added physical energy, vigor and power, and also asserted
that fatigue was due to lack of these vitamins, Abrams said.
   Of the five B-vitamins contained in Rice Krispies, three _
thiamin, riboflavin and niacin _ are known to help convert food
into the type of energy needed by the body's cells, Abrams said.
But there is no evidence that eating Rice Krispies has an effect on
a person's energy level or feeling of well-being, he said.
   Studies have shown B-vitamins are readily available in the
American diet and the majority of consumers who suffer from fatigue
do not have any primary vitamin deficiency, Abrams said in a
statement.
   The attorney general obtained a formal ``assurance of
discontinuance'' from Kellogg on Aug. 4, stating the company would
not use any advertising or labeling that might lead consumers to
believe B-vitamins added to Rice Krispies provide energy or relieve
fatigue.
   The company admitted no liability but paid $10,000 toward the
cost of New York's investigation.
   A recording at Kellogg's Battle Creek headquarters said the
offices were closed Wednesday afternoon.
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a
Washington-based public advocacy group, applauded the attorney
general's efforts. CSPI brought the Rice Krispies health claim to
New York's attention last October.

   Snap, crackle, ouch]
   Prices of breakfast cereals are going up about 4%, or 12
cents on a $3 box, and consumers will start paying more soon.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the past two weeks, three of the biggest makers of
ready-to-eat cereals in the U.S. have notified the grocery
trade of higher prices. The latest was General Mills Inc.,
which yesterday said it is raising prices an average of 4%
immediately.
   That move follows a 3.7% average price increase by
market-leader Kellogg Co. over the weekend. Quaker Oats Co.
kicked off this year's round of increases -- annual price
gains are becoming an industry tradition -- with a boost
averaging about 5%.
   As yet, Ralston Purina Co., the Post division of Philip
Morris Cos.' Kraft General Foods unit, and the Nabisco Brands
unit of RJR Nabisco haven't followed suit. "We're studying
what everybody's doing," said a Nabisco spokesman.
   If the entire industry boosts prices an average of 4% and
consumers don't balk at the increase, it would mean at least
$300 million in additional sales in the $7.5 billion domestic
ready-to-eat category. In the past, consumers have gulped at
rising prices, but continued to buy their breakfast staple
nonetheless.
   "We felt it necessary to do it now to maintain our margins
in the face of rising costs," a Quaker spokesman said, citing
ingredients, packaging and labor. Quaker has a 7.4% share of
the U.S. cold-cereal market. Its price increases don't
include hot cereals, a category the company dominates.
   General Mills Vice Chairman Arthur Schulze, defending his
company's increase, said that oats -- a primary ingredient in
several of its cereals -- cost 15% more than last year, while
wheat is up 17%. Raisins, almonds and other food ingredients
also have risen, as has the price of recycled paper,
increasingly popular as a packaging material, Mr. Schulze
said.
   "It shouldn't be surprising these advances occur about the
same time because we all are looking at the same costs," he
said. "We all rely on grain as our principal ingredient. . .
. When we see dramatic increases in costs we inevitably
adjust our prices."
   Last year the company, which has a 29% share of the
domestic market, raised cereal prices 5.9%.
   Market-leader Kellogg, with about a 39% share, this year
raised prices across the board; in November the company had
exempted Corn Flakes and Frosted Flakes, apparently to
protect those core brands against share erosion.
   While the increases by Kellogg's range from 3% to 5%, Corn
Flakes will go up only 2.4%. A company spokesman noted it was
the first price increase for the flagship product since April
1989.

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the race to become the champions of
big breakfasts, civic-minded chefs in western Massachusetts have
stirred oceans of batter, flipped mountains of pancakes and brewed
rivers of coffee.
   Rival Battle Creek, Mich., has served up cereal, Pop Tarts,
doughnut holes and Tang _ cold.
   ``We're not talking apples and apples and oranges and oranges,''
says state Rep. Athan Catjakis, a co-chairman of this Saturday's
breakfast in Springfield.
   Officials hope to dish up 35,000 pancake breakfasts to hang on
to the biggest breakfast title, wrested from Battle Creek last year
by a margin of about 1,000 breakfasts served. Battle Creek answers
the challenge June 9.
   Springfield, Ore., which tried and failed to beat its
Massachusetts namesake in 1989, will send Mayor William E.
Morisette and his wife to pick up pointers, although no immediate
challenge is planned.
   ``As far as a pancake breakfast, I don't think there's anybody
in the United States that can touch us,'' Catjakis said. ``It's a
lot easier to take a box of cereal and pour some milk.''
   Officials in Battle Creek, home of three major cereal makers,
defended their menu. ``Is it fair? You bet,'' said spokeswoman
Helen Royal.
   She said Battle Creek, with a population of about 70,000, is at
a disadvantage to Springfield, a city of about 150,000, so the
Michigan city has to work harder to get the big numbers.
   Besides, cereal goes back a long way in Battle Creek, home of
the Kellogg Co., the Post division of General Foods Corp. and
Ralston Purina Co., she said.
   ``We are the cereal capital of the world. That's a title that we
really honor and that we defend and we're the only city in the
world that can claim that right,'' Royal said.
   Battle Creek held a free cereal breakfast in 1956 to celebrate
the 50th anniversary of the founding of Kellogg. The event was
repeated four times from 1958 to 1962. The tradition was resumed in
1976.
   A decade later, Springfield set up a table on Main Street and
served 24,000 pancake breakfasts to celebrate its 350th anniversary.
   ``We were looking for something different to do,'' Catjakis said.
   The cities first competed for ``World's Longest Breakfast
Table,'' but after that became logistically difficult, the race
switched to feeding the most people.
   Battle Creek won in 1987 and 1988. But in 1989, Springfield won
with 33,869 breakfasts served. Battle Creek officials blamed a
cold, windy day for only attracting 32,856 people.
   In 1987, Springfield tried serving cereal, but it bombed with
New England breakfast-eaters, Catjakis said.
   The Springfield pancakes, provided by a restaurant chain at
$1.50 per adult, calls for 600 pounds of egg yolks, 220 pounds of
butter, 3,000 pounds of flour and 400 gallons of water. Sixteen
griddles are used and the flapjacks are served with 2,000 pounds of
butter and 200 gallons of maple syrup.
   Six hundred gallons of coffee and orange juice complete the meal.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Television:
   Snap, Crackle and Pop

<LP>
   Some weeks ago, the "CBS Evening News" aired a segment
about a new and intriguing television commercial. In spotting
the newsworthiness -- relatively speaking -- of this ad for
Taster's Choice instant coffee, correspondent Richard Roth
was on to something.
   In that ad, which everyone must have seen by now, a
handsome, raffish but ultimately serious fellow finds a
beautiful new neighbor standing at his door. She says she
wants to borrow some coffee. The heady brew of action and
reaction between them is entirely charming and, we're
promised, there will be more, since the commercial has been
conceived as a kind of miniseries, with a developing story
line.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That is why the commercial is making news. Yet even
without the serial gimmick, this first spot's civilized guile
would be enough to set it apart in an era when TV advertising
grows more primitive by the day. For example, it can't have
gone unnoticed that commercials, particularly commercials for
food products, have entered a peculiarly noisy phase. The
symphony of sounds -- crunch crunch, chomp chomp -- and
emissions of a still more bestial ilk mostly attends the
consumption of breakfast cereals, though by no means
exclusively.
   We have just, after all, passed through the season of the
Washington State apple ad, a creation consisting almost
entirely of sounds whose effect is roughly equivalent to the
pleasure of having someone snap chewing gum in your ears.
Notwithstanding market researchers, who think that the crunch
sells, there are people around who have developed hard
feelings about the Washington State apple precisely on
account of that ad.
   The most-far-gone exemplar of the new primitivism, so far,
at any rate, lurks in the cheese department -- the Kraft
Light Singles ad, to be exact. This commercial recently
provided the edifying spectacle of a father sitting at a
table with his small son. The father is slavering over a
cheese sandwich and trying to make the boy understand what
he's saying, something to do with Kraft cheese. But
understanding the father is not easy, either for the boy or
us, since the man is trying to talk through a mouth so
completely stuffed that most of what he says is
incomprehensible -- except of course for the mention of the
cheese brand.
   What all this says about the advertisers' reading of the
public taste is worth contemplating on some bleak rainy day.
One thing is already certain. An industry that feels itself
-- as a good part of the advertising industry evidently does
-- freer and freer to traffic in the boorishness reflected in
these ads is telling us something about the condition of the
culture, a condition it has done a good deal to help bring
about. And the news it brings is not good. The same is true,
of course, of the new crudity in TV fare itself this past
season.
   For all these reasons and more, the oases of civilization
in the TV advertising desert stand out. That a number of
these better ads seems to be about coffee is a mystery whose
depths some enterprising Ph.D. candidate may wish to plumb
some day. Possibly this may have happened because coffee is a
more traditional item than, say, Kraft Light Singles.
   Tradition is, of course, the heart of the enormously
watchable current ad for Maxwell House 1892 coffee. This is
the soft-focus, summery one set somewhere in the '40s, or
earlier, that begins with a man's voice asking for a cup of
that coffee, please, and follows with the low voice of the
waitress, who says, in soothing down-home accents, "You know
it's gonna be a nice day for the paraayde." And you know what
kind of a parade it is: There is the flag, and small boys
with their caps off looking reverentially at that flag the
way, the voice-over tells us, things used to be.
   These are, of course, hardly the first ad creators to have
latched on to the great yearning out there for the way things
used to be. Still, the Maxwell House 1892 coffee ad is
particularly effective in the way it puts its finger on the
nature of that yearning. Not that it is altogether oblivious
to contemporary glories. It can't be an accident that the
huge army man with avuncular smile who is the star of the
parade scene bears so striking a resemblance to a certain big
general recently back from the wars.
   The man himself will be the subject of a biographical film
of sorts tomorrow night on A&amp;E (8-9 p.m. EDT). About this
work, which consists in good part of scrapings from here and
there, one can only say that those hoping to learn more than
the by-now-familiar outlines of the Schwarzkopf legend had
better not look for it here. Those who miss the briefings and
the other Gulf War footage enough to want to see a replay
will, on the other hand be riveted by these clips
masquerading as a biography.
   For a genuine biography, if of another sort of hero, wait
until Friday (9-11 p.m. EDT), when PBS's American Playhouse
offers "Darrow." Kevin Spacey (currently the star of Neil
Simon's "Lost in Yonkers" on Broadway) is a marvel as Darrow.
The script, by William Schmidt and Stephen Stept, needless to
say, provides much more detail about Darrow's private life
and foibles than did either of the two great Hollywood films
about him. But make no mistake: This film, like those earlier
ones, is the purest act of hero worship. Darrow wasn't much
of a husband to his first wife, nor much of a father, loving
though he was to his son. His work and causes were his life
and sole concern. The scriptwriters are wise enough not to
make much of this. They also wisely avoid dealing with the
Scopes trial, for which Darrow is best known. Instead, they
concentrate on his early career as a labor lawyer and as the
attorney for Leopold and Loeb at their murder trial, where he
argued successfully against the death penalty.
   It is a remarkable visit back to the time when workers
were at the utter mercy of management, when nine-year-olds
labored in mines for 14 hours, when every right-thinking
heart beat for the strikers and the unions stood for justice.
The way things used to be. . . .

   Susan Montgomery Williams kept the bubbles
blowing and the rhymes flowing until the jury burst her bubble.
   She called it a case of double bubble trouble.
   Williams was convicted Monday of disturbing the court by popping
her gum too loudly in a hallway. She was fined $150 and got a
warning from Commissioner Michael J. Feinberg not to chew gum in
the courthouse.
   ``I guess I just must have made a new law _ don't snap, crackle
or pop unless you want to stop a cop,'' Williams said.
   Williams, a 29-year-old housewife, won a place in the Guinness
Book of World Records in 1985 by blowing a 22-inch bubble. A
National Enquirer photographer was on hand to record the event at
her home.
   But in October, she was cited at an outdoor concert for popping
bubbles so loud they disturbed the performers. She said she did it
so her kids could find her.
   Waiting outside a courtroom for dismissal of that case, Williams
couldn't resist popping another one. That drew the attention of two
bailiffs, who contended the explosions sounded like .38-caliber
gunfire.
   ``I guess it's my double bubble trouble,'' Williams said.

   In Saturday's competition, the
contestants were better off without fire in the belly.
   The contestants: Battle Creek and Springfield, Mass. The weapons:
flapjacks, cereal, doughnut holes, Pop Tarts, coffee, milk and
orange drink. The final score: Battle Creek 38,753, Springfield
37,380.
   It was sweet revenge for the ``Cereal City,'' which reclaimed its
crown Saturday after coming up empty in last year's annual breakfast
battle. The victory was especially impressive since Springfield's
population of 150,000 is almost three times Battle Creek's.
   ``It was a fantastic day; it was great,'' organizer Rick Royal
said after 500 volunteers dished out 38,753 portions. The food was
served for 3{ hours from a 2,500 foot-long table.
   ``It was an incredible effort for a town our size,'' Royal said.
   Battle Creek lost its title for the first time last year when
Springfield, fed pancakes to 33,869 hungry residents, outdoing
Battle Creek by 1,013 breakfasts.
   Royal, however, had a perfect alibi for last year's loss. In
1989, it was cold and rainy. This year, skies were sunny and
temperatures high.
   Battle Creek is the home of Kellogg Co., Post and Ralston Purina
Co. cereal plants. The city held its first free cereal breakfast in
1956 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Kellogg's founding.
   In 1977, Springfield unsuccessfully challenged Battle Creek; the
two cities began competing annually in 1986.

KELLOGG TO FIRE NEW SALVO IN OAT BRAN WAR; 
</P>
<P>
CEREAL GIANT'S SECOND NEW PRODUCT TO DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Kellogg Co. will put the crackle back into the oat bran war this morning when 
it introduces its new cereal Heartwise, a bran-and-psyllium breakfast food and 
its second new product in as many weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Heartwise and Oatbake, which was introduced last Thursday, are an effort by the 
Battle Creek, Mich., cereal giant to work its way back into the nation's 
breakfast bowls and gain ground lost to General Mills Inc., maker of oat-based 
Cheerios and Benefit. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to oat bran, Benefit also contains a controversial grain called 
psyllium, which is grown in India and is high in soluble fiber. General Mills 
was the first to manufacture a bran-and-psyllium cereal, introducing Benefit 
last April. Kellogg became a quick No. 2 with Heartwise. 
</P>
<P>
"What is happening here last week and this week is that Kellogg is positioning 
itself to benefit from the demand for oat-based products," said Harry Segalas, 
analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York. "General Mills has been gaining 
share because they're very well positioned." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aggressive Marketing Campaign 
</P>
<P>
The oat bran craze began about two years ago, with a diet book called "The 
Eight-Week Cholesterol Cure" by Robert E. Kowalski, said Timothy S. Ramey, food 
industry analyst for County NatWest Securities USA in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things the book had in there was that oat bran reduced cholesterol 
levels," Ramey said. "It had been substantiated a year earlier by a scientific 
study. This guy was the first to market the idea. Quaker then picked it up and 
started touting it." 
</P>
<P>
When "The Eight-Week Cholesterol Cure" was published, General Mills already had 
an oat-based product on the market: that staple of early morning eating called 
Cheerios. In April, the company introduced Benefit. 
</P>
<P>
General Mills followed with an aggressive marketing campaign that touted the 
cereal's cholesterol-reducing properties, crediting soluble fiber-filled oat 
bran and psyllium. Studies have linked soluble fiber and a low-fat diet with 
reduced cholesterol levels. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a very strong demand for cholesterol reduction in the diet and a 
tremendous explosion in the oat bran cereals in the past two years, the last 12 
months in particular," said Lawrence Adelman, food analyst at Dean Witter 
Reynolds in New York. "An important part of cereal consumption in the last few 
years has been very dramatically driven by health considerations." 
</P>
<P>
It is just those considerations -- coupled with General Mills' market share -- 
that have driven Kellogg to double the number of oat-based cereals that it 
offers, industry watchers say. Oat-based cereals such as Benefit and Cheerios 
account for about 40% of General Mills' cereal volume, Adelman said, compared 
to only 10% for Kellogg. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that General Mills is gaining some share and Kellogg has 
lost some share, a moderate shift," he said. "But Kellogg is coming back like 
gang busters." 
</P>
<P>
Until last Thursday, Kellogg's bit of the bran bonanza consisted of Common 
Sense Oat Bran and Cracklin' Oat Bran. Six days ago, the company introduced 
Oatbake, a whole oats cereal that can be eaten hot or cold, Ramey said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FDA Developing Rules 
</P>
<P>
And this morning, Ramey said, Heartwise will burst upon the bran world during 
-- appropriately enough -- a breakfast news conference at New York's Waldorf 
Astoria Hotel. A Kellogg's spokesman would only confirm that company Chairman 
William E. LaMothe will introduce a new product and make a "major policy 
announcement." 
</P>
<P>
But before the announcement and the product introduction, "leading members of 
the scientific community, in the area of disease prevention . . . will discuss 
recent research findings on lowering blood cholesterol," according to a written 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Kathryn Newton, a spokeswoman for General Mills, said she knew nothing about 
Heartwise, except that it sounds a lot like her company's controversial cereal 
Benefit. Soon after Benefit was released, Procter &amp; Gamble Co. asked the 
Food and Drug Administration to pull the psyllium-based cereal from market 
shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the FDA is developing a regulation governing health claims on product 
labels. 
</P>
<P>
Psyllium is also a part of Metamucil, Procter &amp; Gamble's fiber laxative. 
Procter &amp; Gamble had asked the FDA to allow the company to make 
cholesterol-lowering claims for Metamucil, but the agency said more tests are 
needed. 
</P>

Procter &amp; Gamble contends that Benefit is actually a drug and should meet

Dr. Donald B. Hunninghake, director of the Heart Disease Prevention Clinic at 
the University of Minnesota, supervised the General Mills studies on its 
Benefit cereal. According to the study, a two-ounce serving of Benefit -- 
coupled with a low-fat diet, resulted in a 5.9% decrease in blood cholesterol.

"In terms of how (oat bran and psyllium) lower cholesterol, I don't think

"The U.S. ready-to-eat cereal market is enjoying phenomenal growth this year," 
Segalas said, who estimates that oat-bran cereals account for about $1.5 
billion of the $7-billion cereal industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The volume for the industry is at a 5% clip," he said. "The reason is that 
there's been a very strong demand for oat-based products. Historically this 
market has grown at a 3% to 4% annual rate. "

<TEXT>
   Kellogg Co. said today it is recalling
the ``cool flute'' and binoculars toys packaged in some products
because small children could choke on them.
   Tests showed the plastic toys could break into small parts and
pose a hazard to children under 3 years old, Kellogg said.
   The company said about 30 million of the promotional toys have
been distributed since early 1988.
   The recall includes the ``cool flute'' _ a musical toy with two
tubes connected to a mouthpiece _ found in Corn POPS cereal, but not
``cool flute'' toys found in other products, the company said.
   The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission received a report of
a choking incident involving a ``cool flute'' which did not result
in serious injury, Kellogg said. The company said it has received no
complaints of injuries related to the toy.
   The binoculars _ two plastic lenses in a cardboard holder, were
distributed in marked boxes of Fruity Marshmallow Krispies, Cocoa
Krispies, Rice Krispies and 12-count Pop-Tarts toaster pastries. No
complaints of injuries involving the binoculars have been received,
Kellogg said.
   Customers were urged to take the toys away from children under 3
years old and either discard them or contact Kellogg's consumer
affairs department for reimbursement.

   A trail through Aptos Canyon has become a
tourist attraction, drawing hundreds of hikers eager to stand at
ground zero of the deadly and devastating October earthquake.
   ``It's awfully crowded ... it's swamped,'' said senior park aide
Barbara Louck on Sunday, adding that the crunch of curious
sightseers were creating problems for parking and access to the
six-mile round-trip trail.
   ``It's an exciting place to be,'' said Bud Getty, superintendent
of Forest of Nisene Marks State Park. ``This was the major quake of
people's lifetimes, and it really captures your imagination to walk
out to the epicenter. You can really see the power of the earth.''
   A sign posted by Ranger Jerry Waggoner marks the spot about 50
miles south of San Francisco that was calculated by latitude and
longitude. The site has 4-foot-diameter redwood trees snapped off
at the ground, and a 150-foot wide landslide nearby. Just beyond
the epicenter, the trail is closed because of danger from new
landslides.
   ``That's enough to convince me,'' said Pat Wagner, 62, of
Burlington, Iowa. ``I've never been in an earthquake _ and I never
want to be.''
   ``Can you imagine what it took to rip these trees out?'' asked
Julie Dawson of Milpitas during a hike to the epicenter last week.
``And can you imagine the sound it made? Snap, crackle and pop!''
   Dawson said she understands why the previously obscure park site
has become so popular since the 7.1-magnitude on Oct. 17 that
killed 67 people and resulted in $10 billion in damage.
   ``I stayed away from San Francisco because I didn't want to be a
rubble necker. I wouldn't want that in my neighborhood,'' she said.
``But there's no one to bother out here.''
   The walk to the site takes about an hour. Most of the trail is
in a deep forest where sunlight rarely penetrates.
   In addition to Nisene Park, other San Francisco Bay area
locations are experiencing renewed interest from temblor tourists.
   At Point Reyes National Seashore, the 0.6-mile Earthquake Trial
leads to the epicenter of the 1906 San Francisco quake and visitors
can see a fence displaced by fault movement of 16 to 20 feet.
   And in Hollister, meeting place of the San Andreas, Calaveras
and Hayward faults, a self-guided earthquake walk wanders past
curbs offset by fault creep and buildings damaged in the Oct. 17
earthquake.

   For knockdown rivalry, forget the Rose Bowl or the Cotton
Bowl. This year's toughest competition is taking place in the
cereal bowl.
   "Buy one, get one free." . . . "For a limited time,
Cheerios or Wheaties or Kix just 99 cents each." . . . "Buy
two boxes of Rice Krispies or Raisin Bran and get a stuffed

<TEXT>
   An avalanche of cereal come-ons has descended on consumers
as the industry giants -- Kellogg Co. and General Mills Inc.
-- go head to head for a bigger share of the lucrative $7.5
billion-a-year business. Indeed, even as they annually raise
prices in the 3%-to-5% range, so that some cereals are
approaching $5 a box, market leader Kellogg and archrival
General Mills are virtually giving away some product to snare
business. (Between them, they already hold two-thirds of the
domestic market, with Kellogg ahead 38% to 28%.)
   In this clash, the two behemoths aren't shy either about
bashing each other's products. Current boxes of Total Corn
Flakes from General Mills proclaim the product "more
nutritious and better-tasting than Kellogg's Corn Flakes."
Kellogg counters with streamers on packages of Just Right
saying its "taste beats Total." (Kellogg says it has research
proving that claim but declines to disclose it.)
   "Kellogg is spending like it's on the warpath," says
analyst John McMillin, who follows the cereal industry for
Prudential Securities. In the third quarter alone, Kellogg
shelled out an estimated $100 million more on marketing than
it had a year earlier. Sales jumped 11.4% and earnings 6.2%.
   There is no indication that Kellogg will let up soon. Mr.
McMillin believes Kellogg is as intent on forcing General
Mills to pay more attention to its business at home --
General Mills recently ventured overseas, where Kellogg is
king -- as it is on gaining domestic share points.
   "As the market leader, we are going to protect and
increase that leadership -- doing whatever it takes," says
Kellogg senior vice president Joseph Stewart. Noting that
"the cereal business has always been intensely competitive,"
General Mills vice chairman Arthur Schulze says his company
seeks to build market share by "focusing on the consumer's
breakfast needs rather than on our competition." Grocers
often put cereals on special, he says, because next to soft
drinks they are a store's largest-selling branded-food item.
   Whatever the rationale, U.S. consumers are the winners.
Where company founder W.K. Kellogg once snared customers with
advertisements warning he couldn't make enough corn flakes to
meet their demand, today's pitches stick primarily to price
promotions. Discount coupons, some worth $1 and more, lard
Sunday newspaper supplements, for instance.
   "We're seeing aggressive pricing," says a spokesman for
Dominick's Finer Foods, a Chicago-based supermarket chain.
Promotions, he adds, are "more frequent and deeper."
   The explanation is simple: A single share point, or 1% of
total sales, means $75 million in revenue. Brands can thrive
on less than that. And where profit margins run 20% and more,
incremental sales mean bottom-line gains.
   Against the Big Two in the cereal wars, "the real losers
are the small guys," contends Bonnie Wittenburg, food analyst
at Dain Bosworth in Minneapolis. She thinks Quaker Oats Co.
and RJR's Nabisco Brands unit, each with less than 10% of the
domestic market, are particularly vulnerable. Kellogg's
recent announcement that it will introduce a low-fat granola
soon is seen as a shot at Quaker, whose much-smaller product
line includes a granola.
   At the same time, all national brands are under attack
from their primary customers: the nation's supermarkets. Many
chains have their own house-brand cereals; Cincinnati-based
Kroger Co., for example, has 20 varieties. "The national
brands are priced pretty high. That's left plenty of room for
private-label people like us to come in with dramatically
lower prices," says a Kroger spokesman. "As a result, our
sales have increased rather sharply."
   Many private-label products are blatant knockoffs of
leading national brands, advertised as being cheaper without
sacrificing taste. In Hy-Vee Food Stores Inc. outlets across
Iowa, an oat-based cereal called Tasteeos closely resembles
-- and is placed on shelves next to -- General Mills'
Cheerios. Whereas Cheerios may cost $3.26 for 15 ounces,
Tasteeos costs about half that, $1.69. Hy-Vee also stocks
apple-cinnamon and honey-nut versions of Tasteeos, mimicking
Cheerios' line extensions.
   Cereals are such profitable staples that supermarkets
sometimes offer discounts on their house brands. North
Carolina-based Food Lion Inc. stores celebrated a grand
opening in Dallas earlier this month with a two-for-one sale
on its private-label cereals. Tactics like that put
price-slashing pressure on the national brands. At Food Saver
stores in Des Moines last week, Kellogg was selling boxes of
Rice Krispies for just 84 cents, with an in-store coupon.
   Others also nibble at the majors' market shares.
British-based Weetabix recently introduced a line of
"natural" cereals named Grainfields in the New York
metropolitan area. On the West Coast, an "environmentally
correct" multigrain cereal called Rainforest Crisp boasts of
buying nuts grown in Brazil's jungles, thereby discouraging
their destruction.
   To fill niches and maintain momentum, the big cereal
companies keep up a parade of new products. Typically, they
are either extensions of established brands, such as
Kellogg's forthcoming frosted bran flakes, or copies of
rivals' successes, like General Mills' pre-sweetened Wheaties
Honey Gold, which is strikingly similar to Kellogg's
best-selling Frosted Flakes.
   Few cereals are sold solely on their stated qualities.
Even adult or all-family varieties offer added incentives,
ranging from free liters of soda pop to tips on golfing.
In-store salespeople augment in-box promos. In Safeway Inc.
stores in the Tucson, Ariz., area, a Kellogg pitchman
recently gave away baseballs autographed by Tony the Tiger.
Kellogg also is using its sponsorship of the U.S. Olympic
team to generate videotaped Winter Olympics highlights,
bobsled-team pins and similar bonuses.
   But retailers curb some in-store promotions. Kellogg's
offer of free milk or fruit with multiple-box buys was nixed
by Shaw's Supermarkets, a New England chain, because "you
have to keep track of what a customer has purchased,"
explains a Shaw's spokeswoman. "It's labor-intensive" and can
slow the checkout process, she adds.
   To nail down buying intentions before consumers get to the
store, manufacturers are making cents-off coupons
increasingly attractive. Weekend newspapers often contain
cereal coupons worth $4 or more in all.
   Couponing is a proven merchandise mover. "Cereals you sell
a case a week of you now sell 12 or 15," says Frank Kamberos,
an owner of Treasure Island Food Stores in Chicago. One
cereal-company spokesman says the stepped-up couponing
activity in part reflects a pullback from network television
as that medium's reach becomes less certain.
   But others see a correlation between the ever-rising price
of breakfast flakes and today's increased discounting
activity. Says Ms. Wittenburg: "Couponing softens the blow."

<HEAD>Ralston-Purina Puts Adult Incentive in Kids' Cereals</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ralston Purina Co. is giving away $29,000 sports
cars in a promotion designed to sell more cereal, but it steered
away from high-fiber ``adult'' products in selecting vehicles for
the giveaway.
   The St. Louis-based food marketer chose six children's cereals
with names like Freakies, Fruit Islands and Ghostbusters for the
promotion.
   Ralston isn't the first to recognize the potential in marketing
children's cereals to adults.
   The leader in the $5 billion ready-to-eat cereal market, Kellogg
Co., has been doing it for years in advertising its Frosted Flakes
and Frosted Mini-Wheats brands, among others. Frosted Flakes
commercials have shown adults ``confessing'' to a powerful
attraction for the taste of the cereal and drawing the window
shades while they indulge.
   General Mills Inc. advertises the ``unsinkability'' and low
sugar content of its Cheerios brand in advertising aimed at adults
and spins stories about the latest adventures of the Cheerios kid
in commercials aimed at children.
   Quaker Oats Co. found a few years ago that its Cap'n Crunch
cereal was so popular at campus cafeterias that it devised a
special version of a ``Find the Captain'' promotion for college
students.
   Ronald Strauss, who follows the cereal business for the
investment firm William Blair &amp; Co. in Chicago, said cereal makers
have increasingly tried to market their products as something for
all the family.
   ``The demographics are changing. The average age of the
population is getting older and there are simply not as many
teenyboppers out there anymore,'' he said.
   Celeste Clark, a spokeswoman for Kellogg, which is based in
Battle Creek, Mich., said advertising pre-sweetened cereals to
adults reminds them of the good tastes they enjoyed while they were
growing up.
   Frosted Flakes, for example, has been available for more than 35
years and was initially marketed to children, she said.
   But many of those who ate it years ago may now have children of
their own and may be receptive to trying it again, she said.
   Kellogg began advertising Frosted Flakes to adults five years
ago with the light-hearted approach that aims at reassuring them it
is appropriate for adults to eat it, and Ms. Clark said the cereal
now leads the category.
   Strauss said his figures confirm that, with Frosted Flakes
capturing about 6 percent of the retail value of the ready-to-eat
cereal market in 1986.
   Ms. Clark said Kellogg has also fouind that while health
concerns are driving some adults toward cereals with fruits, nuts
and grains, a key factor in determining what cereal people buy is
still its taste.
   Kathryn Newton, a spokeswoman for General Mills in Minneapolis,
said advertising children's cereal to adults makes sense because
adults make the purchases for all of them.
   That was the principle motivation behind the Ralston sports car
promotion, said spokeswoman Sandra Harrington.
   Ralston Purina began offering tiny sports car models in about 11
million boxes of six of its children's cereals in February. Ten
boxes of cereal contain a scale-model red Corvette, and those who
find the models can turn them in for the real thing, a 1988
Chevrolet Corvette valued at about $29,000.
   The promotion has been advertised nationally in newspapers and
network television commercials, the company said. Sales results are
not yet available.
   ``We were looking for something that would appeal to parents as
well as kids,'' Ms. Harrington said.
   She said the company doesn't know if the promotion will prompt
adults to try the cereals, but hopes that it will at least get them
to buy it for their children. ``Maybe this will be the difference
between having them pick up pour cereal or buying something else,''
she said.

Garage band music it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
Though Louie Louie shares his name with the quintessential grunge-guitar hit of 
the '60s, he draws little inspiration from the chaotic, 
anyone-can-be-a-rock-star sound it exemplifies. Slick and snap-crackle-pop 
crisp, the sloe-eyed singer's debut album, "The State I'm In," could only have 
been recorded in the most high tech of studios. 
</P>
<P>
Louie Louie, the singer from Santa Ana whose real name is Louie Cordero, makes 
no secret of just who his influences are. Average White Band and Prince song 
titles work their way into his lyrics, and in concert Tuesday night at the Roxy 
in Hollywood, the artist paid homage to Sly &amp; the Family Stone, Madonna and 
the disco-era S.O.S. Band by slipping snippets of their tunes into the midst of 
his own. In fact, Louie Louie's strength lies mainly in his ability to parrot 
so many styles so ably. Though there's little original about his act, it is at 
least refreshingly diverse. 
</P>
<P>
Backed my enough players to put up a football team (some of whose sole function 
seemed to be to sway with the music), the singer bounded from the imminently 
enjoyable dance pop of "Pushin' It Too Hard" and "Stop Lookin' for Someone 
Else" to the sly, Latin-flavored "Variety Is the Spice of Life" with unflagging 
energy. So animated were the performances that it often seemed as if the stage 
itself were moving from side to side in an effort to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
The quality of the faster-paced compositions, which constituted about 
three-quarters of the show, ranges from serviceable to extraordinary, the 
latter of which describes the heady "The State I'm In." The song could easily 
slip by undetected on a Prince album as the work of the master himself, though 
it's hard to imagine anyone giving it a more impassioned treatment than its own 
author did Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
A canny expression of 21st-Century Angst, the song's sole failing is an 
obtrusive horn break. Renowned trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie makes an appearance on 
one track on Louie Louie's album, and it's almost as if horn parts were quickly 
tacked on to others so that it wouldn't appear as if Gillespie were recruited 
for his name value alone. 
</P>
<P>
But the evening's most significant clunkers came when the group slowed down the 
pace of the proceedings to allow Louie Louie to try his hand -- and voice -- at 
some generic urban contemporary-style balladry. Clearly, he needs to do more 
homework. Only "Unicorn" displayed any sort of melodic or lyrical imagination. 
</P>
<P>
The nadir came with "Penny Lady," a pathos-laden ode to a homeless woman in 
which Louie Louie offers her not food or shelter but a copy of his album. 
</P>
<P>
That sorry exception aside, however, Louie Louis presented a remarkably 
entertaining hour of radio-ready (critics of the genre might say formulaic) 
contemporary pop music. But a lack of his own distinct musical personality 
might hinder his ability to make the leap from the teen positions on the 
charts, where the sassy "Sittin' in the Lap of Luxury" has already taken him, 
into the upper single-digit spots. 
</P>
<P>
Even if his only goal is to hold title to the most important "Louie Louie" in 
the history of pop music, he faces the formidable task of developing a style to 
rival the impact of garage rock. 
</P>
<P>
Dance diva Nayobe's opening set inadequately displayed her considerable vocal 
talents, marred as it was by a malfunctioning sound system and time constraints 
that limited her to just four songs.

   Watch out, Tony the Tiger, here comes a copycat.
   General Mills Inc. is quietly producing a sugar-coated
version of Wheaties that looks and tastes remarkably like the
country's best-selling presweetened cereal, Frosted Flakes
made by archrival Kellogg Co.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The appearance of Wheaties Honey Gold signals the latest
round in a battle for the breakfast bowl between the two
companies. Whereas in the past the rivals seldom copied each
other, both are now blatantly using knockoffs to win points
in the $7 billion domestic ready-to-eat cereal market.
   General Mills recently introduced a three-grain version of
Kellogg's Rice Krispies called Triples. Perhaps
coincidentally, a sugar-coated version of Rice Krispies
brought out by Kellogg in the mid-1970s is reappearing in
some grocery stores in Minneapolis, General Mills' hometown.
   Kellogg also greeted General Mills' recent entry into the
European market by rolling out its own version of Honey Nut
Cheerios, called Honey Nut Loops, a line extension of Froot
Loops.
   Wheaties Honey Gold leaves little doubt that the cereal
giants are getting away from their flirtation with "healthy"
cereals high in fiber, a fad that culminated in the oat bran
boomlet.
   "The game of selling more fiber and more oats has changed
to a renewed emphasis on the children's area," says John
McMillin, food analyst at Prudential Securities. "During the
oat bran craze the kids were forgotten."
   Kellogg failed twice to woo children with "nutritious"
cereals, first with graham-flour-based S.W. Graham and more
recently with Bigg Mixx, a four-grain presweetened product.
"It's just not there," Kellogg Chairman William E. LaMothe
admitted recently, referring to Bigg Mixx's attraction.
   A Kellogg spokeswoman says the company typically doesn't
comment on competitors' products, but she acknowledges that
the new General Mills cereal "certainly looks" like an
attempt to mimic Frosted Flakes. Although Frosted Flakes
features a cartoon character, Tony the Tiger, Kellogg
successfully expanded the product's appeal beyond kids with
an ad campaign featuring adults, whose faces are hidden,
admitting that they also eat the presweetened flakes.
   A General Mills spokesman says the sweetened version of
Wheaties will be pitched as an "all-family cereal. The target
is people who like what Wheaties stands for but like a
presweetened cereal."
   The word "Wheaties" is turned sideways on the box,
allowing "Honey Gold" to dominate. Unlike its namesake, the
cereal contains corn as well as wheat.
   General Mills hasn't yet announced the new cereal,
although it began taking orders from the grocery trade
yesterday. The product is being produced in the company's new
plant in Covington, Ga., and securities analysts touring the
facility late last week took home boxes of the new cereal.
   While line extensions account for most of the "new" food
items introduced each year, they're still unusual in the
cereal business, where research scientists have been
remarkably creative in using three basic techniques --
flaking, puffing and biscuit-baking -- to fashion new
cereals.
   But the trend seems to be toward the tried-and-true to
gain market share. Kellogg's latest cereal, a presweetened
offering called Double Dip Crunch, is a sugar-coated version
of its Crispix product. And Frosted Flakes, the nation's No.
2 selling cereal with a 5.3% share, is itself a line
extension -- a sweetened version of Corn Flakes, Kellogg's
best-seller world-wide, which has a 5.6% share of the U.S.
market.
   Wheaties Honey Gold jazzes up General Mills' oldest brand;
Wheaties, introduced in 1922, has a 1.5% market share. The
company made lightning strike twice when it dipped its
best-seller, Cheerios, in honey. It followed that with Apple
Cinnamon Cheerios. Together the three have an impressive 8.9%
share, or about $623 million in annual sales.
   Overall, Kellogg has about a 38% share, and General Mills
a 28.4% share of the U.S. ready-to-eat cereal market.
   General Mills says Wheaties Honey Gold will first appear
in the eastern half of the U.S. in mid-September. The company
says it hasn't signed off on advertising plans for Wheaties
Honey Gold, but a spokeswoman says basketball superstar and
Wheaties pitchman Michael Jordan won't be pulling the new
cereal from his locker in TV commercials.

   Battle Creek has lost its bid to
regain the World's Largest Breakfast Table title. But not for lack
of appetite.
   ``It was the weather,'' said Rick Royal, co-chairman of Battle
Creek's weeklong Cereal Festival. ``It was predicted to be sunny and
mild, but it just wasn't there for us in the early morning hours. It
was just very cold.''
   A breakfast including cold cereal and doughnut holes was served
Saturday to 32,856 people, who huddled over their food in cloudy,
50-degree temperatures as whipping winds lifted place mats and milk
cartons.
   The number of people fed in 3{ hours at the 2,000-foot table
missed the mark of 33,869 set by Springfield, Mass., at a May 13
pancake breakfast.
   Mayor Albert Bobrofsky will send a gift of cereal to Springfield
Mayor Mary Hurley.
   Battle Creek is home to Kellogg Co., the Post division of General
Foods Corp. and Ralston Purina Co., all makers of cereal.
   Battle Creek held the first free cereal breakfast in 1956 to
celebrate the 50th anniversary of Kellogg's founding. The first
taste of competition was in 1977, when Springfield fed 11,000
people, wresting away the title.
   It's been heated competition ever since.
   Last year, Battle Creek fed 32,697 people to beat Springfield.
Last month, Springfield reclaimed the record.
   ``Even though they are the breakfast capital of the world for the
year, we still lay claim to Cereal City,'' Royal said.

   A 10-year-old with a yen for fishing but
no one to teach him has taken out a newspaper ad for a surrogate
grandpa.
   ``I've been wanting to go fishing for a long time and my parents
don't really have time to take me a lot,'' said Brandon Weber.
``That's when my mom and I decided to get a buddy for me.''
   The requirements are simple enough, he said: ``somebody who's had
some experience, that's a good fisherman and knows a lot of stuff.''
   So for three days Brandon's parents, Judy and Ernie Weber, ran
this ad in the Bureau County Republican:
   ``WANTED: Surrogate grandpa. Goal: Fishing buddy for a
10-year-old.''
   The Webers hadn't had a response by Friday, and telephone calls
Monday went unanswered.
   ``Brandon would come in and say, `Did a grandpa call?' I'd say,
`No, not yet,''' said Mrs. Weber.
   Mrs. Weber, a nurse, and her husband have full-time jobs and
little interest in the outdoors. Besides, she said, ``It's not the
same with a mom as it is with a grandpa who stands there helping
you, telling the stories.''
   Both of Brandon's grandfathers are dead.

   This hasn't been Kellogg Co.'s year. 
The oat-bran craze has cost the world's largest cereal maker market share. 
The company's president quit suddenly. 
And now Kellogg is indefinitely suspending work on what was to be a $1 billion cereal plant. 

   The company said it was delaying construction because of current market conditions. 
But the Memphis, Tenn., facility wasn't to begin turning out product until 1993, so the decision may reveal a more pessimistic long-term outlook as well. 

   Kellogg, which hasn't been as successful in capitalizing on the public's health-oriented desire for oat bran as rival General Mills Inc., has been losing share in the $6 billion ready-to-eat cereal market. 
Kellogg's current share is believed to be slightly under 40% while General Mills' share is about 27%. 

   Led by its oat-based Cheerios line, General Mills has gained an estimated 2% share so far this year, mostly at the expense of Kellogg. 
Each share point is worth about $60 million in sales. 

   Analysts say much of Kellogg's erosion has been in such core brands as Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies and Frosted Flakes, which represent nearly one-third of its sales volume. 
Kellogg is so anxious to turn around Corn Flakes sales that it soon will begin selling boxes for as little as 99 cents, trade sources say. 

   "Cheerios and Honey Nut Cheerios have eaten away sales normally going to Kellogg's corn-based lines simply because they are made of oats," says Merrill Lynch food analyst William Maguire. 
"They are not a happy group of people at Battle Creek right now." 
Kellogg is based in Battle Creek, Mich., a city that calls itself the breakfast capital of the world. 

   Another analyst, John C. Maxwell Jr. of Wheat, First Securities in Richmond, Va., recently went to a "sell" recommendation on Kellogg stock, which closed Friday at $71.75, down 75 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
"I don't think Kellogg can get back to 40% this year," he said. 
"Kellogg's main problem is life style. 
People are reading the boxes and deciding they want something that's `healthy' for you -- oats, bran." 
Mr. Maxwell said he wouldn't be surprised if, over the next two years or so, General Mills' share increased to 30% or more. 

   In announcing the plant delay, Kellogg Chairman William E. LaMothe said, "Cereal volume growth in the U.S. has not met our expectations for 1989." 
He said construction wouldn't resume until market conditions warrant it. 

   Kellogg indicated that it has room to grow without adding facilities. 
The company has five other U.S. plants, including a modern facility at its Battle Creek headquarters known as Building 100, which is to add bran-processing and rice-processing capacity next year. 

   General Mills, meanwhile, finds itself constrained from boosting sales further because its plants are operating at capacity. 
A large plant in Covington, Ga., is to come on line next year. 

   A Kellogg officer, who asked not to be named, said the Memphis project was "pulled in for a reconsideration of costs," an indication that the ambitious plans might be scaled back in any future construction. 
Initial cost estimates for the plant, which was to have been built in phases, ranged from $1 billion to $1.2 billion. 

   A company spokesman said it was "possible, but highly unlikely," that the plant might never be built. 
"As we regain our leadership level where we have been, and as we continue to put new products into the marketplace and need additional capacity, we will look at resuming our involvement with our plan," he said. 

   The new facility was to have been the world's most advanced cereal manufacturing plant, and Kellogg's largest construction project. 
The company had retained the Fluor Daniel unit of Fluor Corp. as general contractor. 

   But in recent weeks, construction-industry sources reported that early preparation work was slowing at the 185-acre site. 
Subcontractors said they were told that equipment orders would be delayed. 
Fluor Daniel already has reassigned most of its work crew, the sources said. 

   Last Friday's announcement was the first official word that the project was in trouble and that the company's plans for a surge in market share may have been overly optimistic. 
Until recently, Kellogg had been telling its sales force and Wall Street that by 1992 it intended to achieve a 50% share of market, measured in dollar volume. 

   Although he called current market conditions "highly competitive," Mr. LaMothe, Kellogg's chairman and chief executive officer, forecast an earnings increase for the full year. 
Last year, the company earned $480.4 million, or $3.90 a share, on sales of $4.3 billion. 

   As expected, Kellogg reported lower third-quarter earnings. 
Net fell 16% to $123.1 million, or $1.02 a share, from $145.7 million, or $1.18 a share. 
Sales rose 4.8% to $1.20 billion from $1.14 billion. 

   The company had a one-time charge of $14.8 million in the latest quarter covering the disposition of certain assets. 
The company wouldn't elaborate, citing competitive reasons.

<HL> Why Is Capt. Crunch A Little Like Zeus? This Museum Knows --- Ad Characters Are Mainstay Of Pop and Schlock Fare; Spuds MacKenzie in 2988 </HL>
<AUTHOR> Carrie Dolan (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>

<TEXT>
   Take it from Ellen Weis: Snap, Crackle and Pop have more integrity than Spuds MacKenzie. 

   Ms. Weis prefers the Rice Krispies pitchmen because of their simple, clearly delivered message. 
She feels that Spuds's message for Bud Light isn't quite so lucid. 

   "A thousand years from now," when people see pictures of women swooning over a dog, "what will they think of us?" asks Ms. Weis. 
"What will they think are our rituals?" 

   Such questions are important to Ms. Weis. 
She is the director and a co-founder of the five-year-old Museum of Modern Mythology, a nonprofit institution here dedicated to the artistic interpretation of pop and schlock culture. 
Its mainstay is a collection of advertising characters ranging from a Poppin' Fresh Doughboy to a Charlie the Tuna doll. 
These days, says Ms. Weis, pointing to such phenomena as the California Raisins and Energizer batteries' Jacko, ad characters are on the rise. 

   "We're trying to promote a higher consciousness regarding these images," she says. 
"They get into our subconscious, seep into our brains and stay with us for life. 
It's very important to be aware of how powerful they are." 

   Which isn't to say that the museum is a solemn place. 
A Charlie the Tuna doll isn't exactly the moral equivalent of "Aristotle Contemplating the Bust of Homer." 
And what could be less solemn than the museum's current exhibit: the History of Art on 100% Polyester Shirts? 

   Jeffrey Errick, a graphic artist who was one of the museum's founders, is displaying some 200 of his personal collection of 500 polyester shirts. 
There are shirts inspired by Japanese ink drawings, the space program, sports and "the chemical experimentation of the era." 
Patrons are asked to "note the compulsion to put cartoon characters in . . . bizarrely foreign contexts," such as the shirt featuring Tweety and Sylvester in ancient Greece and one of Mickey and Minnie Mouse at Versailles. 

   "I've been to the Museum of Modern Art, but this is much better," says Doug Pauly of Sacramento, who drove 100 miles to see the shirts. 
His friend Gilda Taffet praises a polyester Pollock reproduction, while Mr. Pauly applauds the fact that there isn't "an abundance of paisley." 
Keith Dabney of San Francisco, who collects tea-bag wrappers and once owned a leisure suit, finds the shirts "so ugly they're actually beautiful . . . in a way." 

   Mr. Errick, who also collects metal lunch boxes, began scouting shirts two years ago when he "was looking for something that no one else was collecting." 
At that time, he says, "you could find five or 10 good ones at any thrift store; now they're drying up and getting hard to find." 

   Manufacturers stopped mass-producing the shirts in the mid-1970s, and Mr. Errick frets that they are rapidly disappearing. 
"You can't assume this stuff will be around forever," he says. 
His interest is purely artistic. 
He claims he has never worn a 100% polyester shirt, except to the show's opening. 

   Maybe he doesn't want to admit wearing one before because he read this evaluation by designer John Weitz on a wall card at the exhibit: "There was exceedingly bad styling during the middle 1970s. 
Polyester became associated with a sort of neo-Italian, West Coast cowboy look. 
And it created a whole new world of bad taste. 
Polyester people. 
Polyester towns. 
Polyester hotels." 

   Highlighting the show is a collection of 33 art shirts boasting designs taken from, among other things, Egyptian tomb wall paintings, Italian frescoes and the works of van Gogh. 
Cubism, expressionism and surrealism are all represented. 

   The ad props that constitute the museum's permanent collection were amassed mostly by Mr. Errick himself. 
Among them are a smiling hand from Hamburger Helper; Grit, the personification of dirt for Hoover vacuum cleaners; a Whopper Hopper, a wind-up plastic hamburger; an inflatable pack of cream cheese; and an original Mrs. Butterworth's syrup container. 
The museum has over 3,000 artifacts, only a fraction of which are displayed. 

   "Every society has mythology," Ms. Weis says. 
"It's an important part of culture. 
In some societies, it's religion. 
Our religion is our consumerism." 

   A sign near an eight-foot plastic Jolly Green Giant tells visitors: "At one point, a Harris poll showed more people could correctly identify the Jolly Green Giant than they could the president of the U.S." (Louis Harris &amp; Associates doesn't recall taking such a poll.) 

   "We're not suggesting {that ad characters} have the same stature as Zeus," Ms. Weis says. 
But there are similarities. 
Many ancient figures were half mortal, half gods, while ad characters are often half mortal, half product. 
"They are fictitious characters given enormous credence by their society," Ms. Weis says. 
"Just look at Captain Crunch." 

   With a few exceptions, she says, most corporations and agencies don't chronicle their characters: "No one ever thought it was important enough. . . . 
Every week we find out someone just threw out 10 years of work. 
It's hard to take. 
You can really learn from an original drawing of Elsie the Cow." 

   Some parts of the permanent collection are in storage because they are too big for the gallery. 
One is a prized 10-foot-high, 500-pound hound's head from Doggie Diner, a now-defunct California restaurant chain. 
Also in storage is a "priceless" motorized display for Buster Brown shoes, circa 1915. 
It features -- besides Buster and his dog, Tige -- Alice in Wonderland and other Wonderland characters. 

   The museum has a Frito Bandito eraser, and these erasers are hard to find: The character was retired in the 1960s because of its unflattering ethnic stereotype. 
For the same reason, ethnic characters that were used to promote children's fruit drinks have been transformed: Injun Orange became Jolly Olly Orange; Chinese Cherry became Choo-Choo Cherry. 
And pancake mix's Aunt Jemima went from a mammy to a modern suburban housewife. 

   Other ad characters changed for other reasons. 
The Campbell kids slimmed down, the Michelin Man, initially a gruff guy, grew more "cherubic and charming." 
Betty Crocker and the Morton salt girl are often modernized, but Mr. Peanut has changed little since he was dreamed up by a 12-year-old boy who won a contest in 1916. 

   The museum receives funds from some ad agencies and corporations, but winning traditional art grants has been tough. 
"This isn't perceived as art," Ms. Weis says. 
"It's clearly art. 
It's just not fine art." 

   Cynics may doubt the value of the works, but Ms. Weis takes them seriously: "Junk and kitsch are words I never use."

FT  04 OCT 94 / Europe reaches for its cereal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French are abandoning their croissants, Belgians their rolls and
Italians their habit of nothing but espresso. Across Europe, people are
swapping their traditional breakfasts for a bowl of processed grain and cold
milk. The European market for breakfast cereals has grown in recent years to
be worth some Pounds 1bn annually.
Even during recession, most countries have increased consumption. For
example, sales in France, the second largest European market for cereal
after the UK, increased by 21 per cent in the year to May 1993.
Europe has become an increasingly competitive market for cereal
manufacturers. The recent acquisition of two cereal companies by the Dutch
food and drinks company BolsWessanen, giving it almost 10 per cent of the
European cereal market overnight, has brought into the open what industry
insiders have known for some time.
To compete seriously, companies must have the market share and financial
muscle to back new products with heavy advertising. This year, Kellogg is
estimated to be spending Pounds 6m in the UK alone to support its Corn Pops
brand.
Harrison &amp; Crosfield, the UK conglomerate which sold, the companies to
BolsWessanen, admitted it would not compete in this league by shedding what
had been for it a successful, but peripheral, business.
The European breakfast cereals market is controlled by a few large
companies. According to the Food Industry Bulletin, Kellogg dominates with
more than 50 per cent, followed by Weetabix at 9.5 per cent and Cereal
Partners Worldwide, a joint venture between Nestle and General Mills, with 6
per cent.
The arrival of CP in 1989 is widely credited with setting off the real
explosion in the market. Within three years, through aggressive marketing
and new product launches, it had won sales of some Dollars 348m (Pounds
225m). Naturally, Kellogg fought back. When CP launched its Golden Grahams,
Kellogg came back a few weeks later with its own Golden Crackers. When CP
introduced Clusters, Kellogg responded with Nutfeast.
The battle even threatened a veteran campaigner, Tony the Tiger, of Frosties
fame. CP lit upon Huey, Dewey and Louie, Donald Duck's nephews, as the
cartoon warriors, for its Trio cereal in France.
But the biggest beneficiaries of the battle between the cereal giants appear
to have been the manufacturers of own label products. Own labels claim 11.5
per cent of total European cereal sales, second only to Kellogg. The
European market for private label products is widely acknowledged to be
growing at a faster rate than the branded sector.
It is partly due to the increasing number of adults who are turning to
cereal as a healthier breakfast option. In the UK, for example, the own
label market is largely an adult market, focusing on mueslis and bran
products.
'Staples deliver more steady virtues,' says Mr Mike Batten, marketing
manager of the UK private label manufacturer, Telford Foods. 'They may have
shown a dip in market share at times, but have stable volumes.' And with the
prospect of an ageing population, 'staples and bran are good bets for the
future'.
In the UK, own label sales are estimated to be outperforming the overall
breakfast cereal market's growth of 2 per cent a year.
'Private labels need size to compete,' says Ms Nomi Ghez, an analyst with
Goldman Sachs in the US. 'Who wants to fight for a share of a market which
only has sales of about Dollars 40m?'
But BolsWessanen, now with 50 per cent of the European private label market
and the financial muscle to back this up, could force Tony the Tiger, and
his rivals, Huey, Dewey and Louie, to sing even louder for their breakfasts.

<HL> 'Friend of Court' Rebuffed

   Just how friendly can friends of the court be with parties involved in litigation? 
That's what Blue Mountain Arts Inc. has asked an appeals court to determine in its battle with Hallmark Cards Inc. 

   In filings with the U.S. appeals court in Denver, Blue Mountain has accused Hallmark of disguising itself as an impartial, expert "friend of the court" in an effort to overturn an adverse ruling. 
In that ruling last year, a federal judge concluded that Hallmark had copied some of the smaller company's greeting cards, and then issued a preliminary injunction barring Hallmark from distributing 83 cards. 

   In a brief filed with the federal appeals court in Denver, the prestigious Society of Illustrators, a New York-based non-profit group, came out in support of Hallmark, arguing that specific styles shouldn't be monopolized. 
The group's more prominent members have included Norman Rockwell, cartoonist Rube Goldberg and Vernon Grant, creator of the Snap, Crackle, Pop characters on the Rice Krispies box. 

   The society's supporters also include Hallmark. 
According to court filings, the company picked the lawyers who wrote the society's friend of the court brief and paid the legal expenses. 
The greeting-card giant also has contributed $200,000 over the past four years to the group's scholarship program. 
None of those details were disclosed in the brief. 

   After uncovering Hallmark's role in the brief, lawyers for Blue Mountain called it a "sham" and "a fraud on the court" in documents filed with the court. 
The attorneys were tipped off when they found that one of the society's exhibits for the brief was stamped "Property of Hallmark Cards Creative Department." 

   In September, the appeals court tossed out the controversial brief, and Hallmark, soon after, forked over $25,000 to Blue Mountain to cover legal expenses in contesting the society's filing. 

   The court, however, didn't set any guidelines for what would make such a filing acceptable. 
Blue Mountain has asked the court to rule that any party filing a friend of the court brief must explicitly state its connection with the litigants. 

   Hallmark says that how it handled its role with the society "was perfectly appropriate." 
The society, meanwhile, says it's unlikely "we would have been able to state our position" without Hallmark's financial help.

   Some people never throw anything
away, according to Scott Bruce, who came to this breakfast food
mecca looking for old cereal boxes to add to his collection.
   Sound flaky?
   ``Cereal boxes represent heroes of popular culture _ the grain
gods, I call them,'' said Bruce, a Cambridge, Mass., collector who
once started a lunch-box collecting craze.
   ``When a kid sits down with a bowl of his favorite cereal, he
becomes one with his hero. It's like a secular communion rite.''
   Bruce, 34, is talking this week with cereal company executives
as well as ordinary people who hoard cereal boxes, if there is such
a thing.
   Rare boxes can fetch up to $1,000, said Bruce, who began his
collection in 1988 and recently published a collector's magazine
called Flake.
   Battle Creek is the home of Kellogg Co., the world's largest
cereal maker, as well as Post and Ralston-Purina plants.
   ``The people here have cereal in their bloodstream,'' said Bruce.
   Old cereal boxes are all the more valuable because of the
scarcity of people who allow them to hang around.
   ``The militant mom was the death to many collections,'' he said
mournfully. ``But maybe I'll find that that odd citizen who has a
Corn Flakes box with Vanessa Williams.'' Miss Williams, Miss
America 1984, lost the crown when it was disclosed she had posed
nude for Playboy.
   Bruce said he generally hunts for vintage boxes in good
condition from the 1930s through 1970s. But he's even squirreling
away some of today's boxes.
   ``The 1990 Batman cereal box from Ralston is an instant
classic,'' he said. ``Just you wait.''

   A marina owner has discovered a use for
the pesky zebra mussels clogging water intake lines along Lake Erie.
   Kent Floro makes the mussels into jewelry.
   ``Business has been going quite well,'' said Floro, owner of
Floro's Marina and a convenience store. ``It's kind of like your
pet rock from a few years ago. Everyone's got to have one.''
   Floro said he collects the basic raw material from the shore by
his marina. Completed mussel earrings, necklaces, tie clips and hat
pins cost between $3 and $4.
   ``We aren't going to run out of stock,'' Floro said, pointing
out that a mussel can produce 30,000 larvae a year.
   The tiny shellfish, less than an inch long, have been clogging
water intake lines from the lake since 1988.

   Kellogg's Next Chairman Langbo Plans
   To Serve Cereal to More Foreign Markets

   BATTLE CREEK, Mich. -- Before being elected Kellogg Co.'s
next chairman and chief executive officer on Friday, Arnold
G. Langbo ate a breakfast of Fiberwise cereal and fruit.
   It was a fitting start for the incoming leader of the
world's biggest cereal maker. "I eat a lot of cereal," Mr.
Langbo says.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   His task is to see that millions of others do as well. As
head of a company with unparalleled world-wide market shares,
with ample cash and a newfound willingness to spend whatever
it takes, the 54-year-old executive is eager to proceed.
   "The exciting issue for the '90s is geographic expansion,"
he says, noting that Kellogg recently entered what had been
East Germany and also revealed plans for plants in Latvia and
India.
   China may be next. Mr. Langbo, who as chairman intends to
continue his current oversight of the company's international
operations, says Kellogg hopes to build a plant in the
People's Republic soon. Reluctant to give details, he would
say only that "we're moving right along."
   And he indicated that changing China's eating habits could
be challenging. Kellogg makes ready-to-eat, or cold, cereal,
while the Chinese are "used to eating something that's warm,
soft and savory" for breakfast, Mr. Langbo noted.
   He will succeed William E. LaMothe as chairman and CEO
upon Mr. LaMothe's retirement on Dec. 31. Like his
predecessor, who spent his entire career at the company, Mr.
Langbo began 35 years ago as a Kellogg sales representative
in his native British Columbia, Canada.
   After directors dismissed the company's President Horst W.
Schroeder in 1989, Mr. Langbo, who by then was running
international operations, was promoted to president and
joined the board.
   He was a popular choice. "People are very loyal to him," a
former colleague said. "He's a positive stroker."
   While overseas offers what its chairman-elect calls "great
opportunities," Kellogg is spending heavily to defend its
leading 37.5% share of the U.S. ready-to-eat cereal market.
   Indeed, in its third quarter ended Sept. 30, Kellogg's
selling and administrative expenses soared $100 million from
a year earlier. Further increases are likely in the current
quarter, the company said. Mr. Langbo indicated in an
interview that a big chunk of those dollars would go into
television advertising, including network, local (spot) and
cable.
   In the U.S., Kellogg also is seeking to fend off
private-label intruders on four of its biggest brands -- Corn
Flakes, Frosted Flakes, Raisin Bran and Rice Krispies -- with
deep-discount promotions. One allows customers to get two
boxes for the price of one during a limited time period.
   Meanwhile, Kellogg is seeking to economize overseas with
commercials that can be adapted to many markets. Mr. Langbo
said one coming commercial for Frosted Flakes can be used in
two dozen countries. As a result, "We saved tremendous
amounts of money."
   Although Mr. Langbo promised several new cereals in the
next year, he wouldn't be specific other than to indicate
that Kellogg will do substantial research before bringing new
products to market because of huge promotional costs
involved. However, he added that consumers shouldn't be
surprised to see products that use grains typically not in
breakfast bowls today.
   Mr. LaMothe, who began as a salesman loading a station
wagon with cereal cases 41 years ago in Brooklyn, says he
intends to remain on Kellogg's board, as is the custom with
former chairmen.
   "I'm still going 90 miles an hour here," he said Friday.
Mr. LaMothe is perhaps best-known in the food industry as an
evangelist for cereal as a health food. Some say it is more
than coincidental that his initials are WEL.

   Workers are unfurling hundreds of
yards of checkered tablecloths as the cereal city prepares to
reclaim bragging rights to the World's Largest Breakfast Table.
   Organizers of the 1989 Cereal Festival plan to serve breakfast to
35,000 people in three-and-a-half hours Saturday to topple a record
set by rival Springfield, Mass., last month.
   ``We'll have ready-to-eat cereal and milk, of course,'' Rick
Royal, co-chairman of the festival, said Thursday.
   Battle Creek is home to Kellogg Co., as well as the Post division
of General Foods and Ralston-Purina, all makers of several varieties
of cereals.
   The 2,500-foot table spans five city blocks, Royal said.
   Battle Creek held the first free cereal breakfast in 1956 to
celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of Kellogg.
   The first taste of competition was in 1977, when Springfield held
a breakfast and fed 11,000 as part of its founders day.
   It's been heated competition ever since.
   Last year, Battle Creek fed 32,697 people to beat Springfield,
which served pancakes to 31,279.
   On May 13, Springfield upped the ante by serving 33,869 people.
   ``There are a few bets involved,'' Royal said. ``But what's
really at stake is a lot of pride. We want the title, but we'll
always be the cereal capital of the World.''
   The cereals are donated by the companies.

   First, Sen. Jaime Gutierrez protested the length
of the Arizona Legislature's session by refusing to shave anymore.
   Now, Sen. Patricia Wright is dying her white hair red in protest.
   Arizona's session is supposed to end by the Saturday of the week
in which the 100th day falls, but budget and tax negotiations had
lawmakers returning for the 152nd day Friday, and Mrs. Wright marked
the occasion with the new hair color.
   Gutierrez has been growing his beard for about two weeks.
   ``With Jaime growing his beard, I just said if they're not
adjourned by two weeks from Thursday, they're going to deal with a
redhead on Friday,'' said Mrs. Wright, explaining the lengths she
went to not to have to carry out her threat. ``Nobody really
believed me.''
   Senate Majority Leader John Mawhinney chuckled at the news.
   ``I hope she's not too testy,'' he said. ``Because I'm pretty
much that way myself.''

<LEADPARA>  Television food advertisements aimed at children should be banned because they
exploit youths and contribute to obesity, the American Academy of Pediatrics
said today.;    The group said children are bombarded with ads for products
such as sugary breakfast cereals aimed at profit-making rather than health.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  DOCTORS' GROUP OPPOSES FOOD ADS AIMED AT
KIDS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     In a policy statement to be issued at a downtown conference, the group said
the ad ban is necessary because young children cannot distinguish between
programs and commercials and don't understand that commercials are designed to
sell products.;    "Not only do we believe that food ads should be eliminated
but also parents' control of the television set should be increased," said Dr.
William Dietz, lead author of the statement and an associate professor of
pediatrics at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston.;    But a
spokesman for a trade organization representing 80 percent of the nation's
major grocery manufacturers called the recommendation "overkill.";     "There
is not a serious problem with food advertising to children," said Jeff
Nedelman of the Grocery Manufacturers of America in Washington.;    
Television has been linked to the two most prevalent nutrition problems in
U.S. children -- obesity, which affects one in five youths, and high
cholesterol levels, found in about a third of all children, Dietz said.;   
"Television viewing promotes inactivity and food consumption," partly through
a heavy dose of food ads, he said.;    Children demand that their parents buy
the products they see advertised, and parents often bow to the pressure, he
said.;    "What we have is a tightly woven net of commercialism that now
surrounds children's television, in which it often begins with toys like the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" and ends with a cereal for the toy, Dietz said.;
   About half of all food ads are aimed at children, and most of those ads are
for sugary breakfast cereals, Dietz said.;    Spokesman Pat Farrell of St.
Louis-based Ralston Purina Co. said the company's rice-based Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles cereal is nutritious.;    A one-cup serving is about one-third
sugar, but it's also fat-free and vitamin-fortified, Farrell said.;    "It's
clear that the authors of the proposed ban don't understand the role of
ready-to-eat cereals in providing children with a healthy, low-fat breakfast,"
said George Franklin, spokesman for Kellogg Co.;    Kellogg's products include
Froot Loops cereal, which is 47 percent sugar, said Michael Jacobson,
executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.;    The
Battle Creek, Mich., company was founded in 1906 by the Kellogg brothers, who
created breakfast cereals "as an alternative to the fat-laden, heavy
breakfasts at the turn of the century," Franklin said.  </TEXT>

General Mills Inc. plans to spend about $65 million for the national 
introductions of Basic 4 and Triples -- breakfast cereals that it hopes will 
generate tasty profits. 
</P>
<P>
The promotional cost, estimated at $35 million for Triples and $30 million for 
Basic 4 over at least a year, is in line with the national rollout costs for 
cereals. 
</P>
<P>
Introducing a cereal costs $20 million to $30 million, said a spokesman for 
rival Kellogg Co. in Battle Creek, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
The expense of national rollouts and the proliferation of brands already on 
supermarket shelves, from 90 to more than 200 depending on the store, caused 
cereal introductions to slow in the past year, said William Maguire, an analyst 
with Merrill Lynch Research in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"The industry has come to realize the high cost of new-product introduction and 
realized that when you go to the market place . . . you've got to introduce a 
product that has some potential," said Kellogg's Joe Stewart, senior vice 
president of corporate affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Add to rollout costs the budgets for promoting existing brands -- figures not 
disclosed by the cereal companies for competitive reasons -- and marketing 
costs for breakfast cereals are tremendous. 
</P>
<P>
But the payoffs are great. U.S. retail cereal sales total anywhere from $5.5 
billion to $7 billion a year, according to industry sources and stock analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, if a cereal achieves even a 1% share of such a large market, 
"you have a very successful cereal," said Craig Shulstad, a spokesman for 
General Mills, based in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're looking at 1%, that translates into sales of $70 million in the 
first year," he said. "That $70 million is a good return on an investment of 
$35 million." 
</P>
<P>
Shulstad said cereal is purchased by 95 of every 100 households. At any time, a 
household has more than one brand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cereal consumption grew at about 3% a year from 1985 to 1989. In per-capita 
terms, the growth in consumption was even stronger, said John Bierbusse, an 
analyst with A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
But consumption slowed in 1990, Bierbusse said, partly because cereal price 
increases in the previous five years outpaced the consumer price index. Another 
factor, he said, was a loss in volume by industry leader Kellogg. 
</P>
<P>
"Their brand-name products have faced competition from General Mills, most 
notably, in selling products that have either better nutritional positioning or 
are more elaborate and have better price value," he said. "At the other end of 
the spectrum, their more mundane branded products, things like Corn Flakes and 
Raisin Bran, have suffered some market share erosion to private-label products 
who compete on the basis of price." 
</P>
<P>
When measured in terms of tonnage sold, Bierbusse said, Kellogg has a 38% 
market share, followed by General Mills with 24%; General Foods Corp., 11%; 
Quaker Oats Co., 7%; Ralston Purina Co., 6%; Nabisco Brands Inc., 4.5%; private 
labels, 6%, and all others, 2.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Bierbusse said "it is a fact that the industry leader has not been able to 
introduce a successful new-product for the last several years." 
</P>
<P>
Kellogg's Stewart said the company is active in new product introductions. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed to Oat Bake, "introduced at the height of the oat craze," Common 
Sense Oat Bran and Ken Mei Rice Bran, introduced recently. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said the key factor for success in the industry is the quality of a 
company's cereals, "the ability to provide customers with that value," rather 
than the quantity of brands available. 
</P>
<P>
The characteristics of a successful cereal have changed little since Kellogg 
introduced its Corn Flakes in 1906, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It has to taste right. It has to offer value to the customer, and it has to be 
in line with the perceived consumer need on health, fitness -- whatever that 
consumer is looking for," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Kellogg is "extremely optimistic" about the cereal market's future, 
despite limited growth this year. Growth in the near future may be limited, he 
said, adding that health considerations position cereal to do well over the 
long term. 
</P>
<P>
"When you consider the health ramifications and the fact our society is moving 
from a treatment society to a disease-prevention society, then these 
grain-based products will play an increasingly meaningful role in a healthy 
diet," he said.

<TEXT>
   Kellogg Co., which has seen
private-label brands take a bite out of sales of its most popular
cereals, is making its latest price increase a bit easier for
consumers to swallow.
   The world's largest cereal maker said Tuesday it has raised
prices on most of its products an average of 3.7 percent, but is
exempting Corn Flakes - for the second straight year - and Frosted
Flakes, two of its biggest sellers.
   Because those cereals and some smaller brands were omitted from
the increase, the net price increase is about 2.8 percent, Kellogg
spokesman Richard Lovell said Tuesday. The increase took effect
Saturday.
   William E. LaMothe, Kellogg's chairman and chief executive
officer, told industry analysts last week that since 1987,
private-label versions had increased their market share to 6.2
percent from 3.6 percent, largely at the expense of Corn Flakes,
Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies, Raisin Bran and Froot Loops.
   LaMothe told the analysts that ``in response to very competitive
conditions, including competition from unbranded products, we'd be
very conservative in our increases,'' Lovell said.
   Over the last couple of years, Kellogg has seen its market share
dip from about 41 percent to 38 percent of the approximately $7
billion ready-to-eat domestic cereal industry. The industry has
been relatively flat this year after a few years of hefty sales
growth, analysts said.
   Kellogg's increase is well below the average 5.9 percent
increase rival General Mills Inc. announced Oct. 19. However,
analysts noted, Kellogg raised its prices an average of 2.2 percent
last spring, while General Mills' last increase was in November
1989.
   Ralston-Purina Co., which makes about half of all cereal sold to
private companies for sale under their own labels, also is gaining
ground with such novelty children's products as Teen-age Mutant
Ninja Turtles and Batman cereals, said John C. Maxwell Jr., cereal
analyst for Wheat First Securities of Richmond, Va.
   But, Maxwell said, Minneapolis-based General Mills is in the
best position for the 1990s with the popularity of oat-based
cereals such as Cheerios still on the rise.
   ``If it doesn't say bran or oats on the label, people aren't
buying,'' Maxwell said. ``Unless Kellogg develops new products to
offset the decline (in older brands), they're going to be in
trouble.''
   However, LaMothe told analysts last week that new products,
because of their increased cost and riskiness, probably would not
be a key to regaining market share.
   Analyst Edward Eyring of Argus Research Corp. in New York said
his company recently has taken a more bullish view of Kellogg and
thinks the relatively conservative price increase is a ``step in
the right direction.''
   ``We think Kellogg has untapped potential,'' he said. ``We have
confidence that the company will be able to successfully tap the
international market for cereals as it intends to do and weather
the competitive pressures that private brands are putting on it.''

<HL> Kellogg Agrees It Won't Run Some Cereal Ads --- Pact With New York State Covers Rice Krispies Ads Promoting B Vitamins </HL>

<TEXT>
   Kellogg Co. agreed not to run certain advertisements for Rice Krispies in New York after the attorney general there accused the company of false advertising. 

   New York Attorney General Robert Abrams alleged that Kellogg's ads promoting the high vitamin B content of its Rice Krispies cereal were misleading. 
The ads in question implied that the B vitamins would give consumers added physical energy and vigor, the attorney general alleged. 
Kellogg said it discontinued the ads in question last September as part of the company's normal marketing strategy. 

   While the Battle Creek, Mich.-based food company denies any wrongdoing, it agreed not to run those ads again in New York and to pay the attorney general's office $10,000 to cover costs of the investigation. 
A company spokesman declined to comment whether Kellogg has plans to run the ads in other states. 

   The New York settlement is part of a recent effort by states to examine health claims made in food ads. 
The National Association of Attorneys General recently set up a task force to look at such ads. 

   Moreover, a group of eight states is jointly investigating dozens of food companies for making misleading health claims, including ads that mislead consumers into believing that some foods are low in such substances as cholesterol, sugar and fat, according to Barbara Tuerkheimer, an assistant Wisconsin attorney general. 

   Such efforts worry the ad industry, which argues that regulation should be done by the federal government, not by the states. 
"If you have attorneys general coming up with different results in different states, then it would make it impossible to run national ads," said Wally Snyder, senior vice president of the American Advertising Federation. 

   In the Kellogg case, the company ran ads that, according to Mr. Abrams, misled consumers into believing that additional B vitamins would give them extra energy and that fatigue signaled a deficiency of the vitamins. 
Kellogg argued that consumers weren't misled, and that, in fact, B vitamins "convert food into energy usable by the body." 

   "Unfortunately, what many people think of when they think of food giving them energy is pep and enthusiasm," says Phyllis Stumbo, a research nutritionist at the University of Iowa's medical school. 
"While vitamin B is required to get energy from food, that doesn't mean you're going to feel energetic." 

   Separately, Kellogg in recent weeks quietly recalled 30,000 cases of Rice Krispies the company said were accidentally overfortified with iron during production. 
A Kellogg spokesman said the error gave the cereal "an off flavor." 

   Kellogg said the error presented no health hazard, so it didn't announce the recall publicly. 
Instead, it ordered its field force to pick up the suspect boxes. 
The company couldn't say how many packages were affected as the production involved several sizes. 
Nor would it say how many have been recovered. 

   The cases were produced in Kellogg's Memphis, Tenn., plant and were stamped with the markings "better if used before" June 22, 23 or 24, 1989, with a letter M following the dates. 
Rice Krispies typically has a one-year recommended shelf life. 

   A similar episode subsequently occurred at the Battle Creek plant, on two batches of Frosted Mini-Wheats biscuits. 
In that instance, 2,400 cases, or about 28,800 packages of cereal, were sprayed with excessive amounts of vitamin A. 
The company said consumers might experience a tingling or burning sensation in the mouth after eating the product. 
Those boxes, stamped "better if used before" Aug. 2, 1989, include the codes BC117 or BC118. 

   That error occurred on two production lines only on the late-night shift, the company said. 
A spokesman said that while that mistake might cause "a short-term discomfort," it wasn't a health hazard. 
But he acknowledged that Kellogg had reported both production mistakes to the Food and Drug Administration. 
Kellogg said it was investigating how both incidents could have occurred.

<HL> Spending It (A Special Report): Giving It Away --- Snap, Crackle, Give: How the Kellogg Foundation Decides Who Receives Its Generosity </HL>

<TEXT>
   The Kellogg Foundation will give away $120 million this year, but that isn't as simple as giving away secret decoder glasses in Rice Krispies boxes. 

   It's easy turning down the ex-convict who wants to market an anti-theft device for Porsches -- which he developed through his expertise in stealing the cars. 
Another rapid reject is the money-losing San Francisco liquor store that wants $30,000 to buy more booze. 

   But how do you say no to an emergency shelter for homeless women and children in Detroit, to a plan to help orphans in Uganda, to AIDS research and to a project to support cottage industries in South Africa? 
So far this year, the Kellogg Foundation has rejected all these worthy proposals -- and hundreds more. 

   The foundation expects to get 5,000 pleas in 1988. 
It will probably refuse more than 90% of them. 
A close look at how the Kellogg staff picks which projects to fund shows the often-mysterious workings of a major foundation and how the business of giving away money changes over time. 

   While the '80s have seen a mushrooming in the ranks of shop-aholics, there are also more donate-aholics than ever. 
Many wealthy people and thriving corporations do their giving through private foundations and they have formed 446 of them -- major ones, with assets of at least $1 million -- since 1980. 
The growth rate of new foundations is 12% higher in this decade, according to the Foundation Center, than in the '70s. 
This year, 5,148 major private foundations in the U.S. with total assets of about $90 billion will pass out more than $5 billion all told. 
Some will do so with considerable flair, others with almost no fanfare at all. 

   Kellogg is among the latter. 
It is so lowkey that few realize it is the nation's third-largest foundation. 
Only the Ford Foundation and the J. Paul Getty Trust outweigh its approximately $3 billion in assets. 
Nearly 60 years after it started operations, its late founder still sets its unpretentious tone. 
W.K. Kellogg, the "King of Cornflakes," was a driven, unsmiling, introverted man who started the Kellogg Co. when he was 46 and surprised himself by becoming a millionaire many times over. 
He arranged for the foundation to remain independent of his company but left it about half the company's stock. 

   Today the foundation's board doesn't include any Kellogg descendants, but if it did they would feel right at home with the foundation's down-to-earth Midwestern conservatism. 

   Mr. Kellogg set few rules, but he stipulated that the foundation had to remain in Battle Creek. 
That has deeply affected the foundation's style. 
Still a small town, the "Cereal City" today has a population of 50,000. 
Its low-rise, red-brick downtown smells of corn from the nearby cereal factories. 
The foundation occupies a low, spare building outside town, but it is preparing to build a $60 million headquarters downtown and to renovate the city's center. 
Now, boarded-up shops and businesses testify to a decade of Rust Belt decline. 

   More than 25 years after its founder's death, the foundation still helps ordinary people meet basic needs, and its leaders would also suit Mr. Kellogg. 
Russell G. Mawby, the foundation's chief executive since 1970, uses words like "golly" and "doggone" and studied horticulture at Michigan State. 
A slightly paunchy man with big hands, a hearty voice and twinkling eyes, he lives on a farm, where he trained oxen named Yankee and Doodle. 
It's hard to imagine the head of some elite East Coast foundation saying, as Mr. Mawby does, "There's something therapeutic about going out and tending livestock morning and night." 

   The Kellogg Foundation now has only a 35% stake in Kellogg Co., but in the last five years the bull market doubled the value of its diversified portfolio. 
Still, the practitioner of what has been called shirtsleeve philanthropy has only 92 employees. 
Preferring straightforward letters, it doesn't even have grant application forms. 
"We're looking for the germ of a great idea, not someone who's good at grant forms," says Norman Brown, the foundation's president. 

   Unless they are addressed to one of the dozen program directors, proposal letters sent to the Kellogg Foundation arrive first at the cubicle of Debbie Rey, a program assistant. 
Ms. Rey, a relentlessly polite young woman, recalls: "One man sent a letter about radio waves and talking to God. 
I wrote back that we were sorry, but we don't have a program category that fits his project." 

   Because of Mr. Kellogg's concerns, the foundation concentrates its programs in three basic areas: agriculture, health and education. 
Mr. Kellogg's words, printed on the foundation's front door, say the organization exists "for the application of knowledge to the problems of people." 
Thus, the practical Kellogg Foundation has given money to community colleges and rural hospitals, not theoretical physicists. 

   On a recent morning, the mail yields half a dozen pleas that fall into the foundation's general areas. 
One group wants $64,000 to set up two rural economic-development councils in Illinois. 
"We do fund some economic-development programs, but only in Michigan," says Ms. Rey. 
"But we do rural programs and they may want to know about this." 
She attaches a small routing slip to her boss and to an appropriate program director. 

   A nonprofit advocacy group for the handicapped wants money to set up a Washington, D.C., office. 
"We don't pay for things like offices, equipment or cars," says Ms. Rey. 
She makes a rejection-letter notation for the word-processing department but, for the record, also sends the request to the person who handles projects for the disabled. 
A California group wants $325,000 to educate children about drug abuse, but Ms. Rey says it will probably be turned down. 
"We don't fund just one disease or health problem at a time," she explains. 
"We get some tear-jerkers too, like one woman who said she had terrible medical problems and sent a photograph of herself hooked up to all these tubes. 
We just can't help everybody." 

   Also destined for rejection letters on this day: The request by a medical professor in Ireland for a grant to study "global medicine issues" after he retires, and the plan of a British microbiologist to research sorghum disease in Africa. 

   Program directors eventually review all but the most frivolous proposals. 
Then the board, which meets monthly, must approve any grant over $50,000. 
The average grant stretches across three years and totals about $300,000, though grants range from roughly $5,000 to $5 million. 
The foundation makes about 300 grants a year, and at any one time has some 600 to 700 active projects. 

   It favors grass-roots efforts to help communities -- mostly in the U.S. and Latin America. 

   Even worthy ideas may be declined. 
Perhaps they are too much like another program in the works, or maybe the area is one the foundation is no longer funding: In the early '80s, the foundation gave some 25 grants to develop computer software for farmers, but now universities and commercial concerns provide such programs. 

   Kellogg is concerned about getting "the most bang for the buck." 
An ideal project is one that, if successful, could either be copied elsewhere -- "replicated" in philanthropyspeak -- or will become self-sufficient. 

   For instance, Rick Little turned to the Kellogg Foundation as a 19-year-old college dropout, after 155 other foundations rejected his idea. 
He developed a highschool course to teach practical skills like how to balance a checkbook along with helping kids make responsible decisions in such areas as sex and drugs. 
He asked for $55,000, but Mr. Mawby decided that that wasn't enough and granted $150,000. 

   That was in 1977. 
Kellogg gave modest grants to Mr. Little for a decade and now his course, called Quest, is being taught to 1.4 million teen-agers in 29 countries. 
Quest International has a $15 million budget, which it raises mostly by selling materials to schools. 
More important, the program has cut absentee and dropout rates and drug and alcohol use in the schools that offer it, while improving academic performance. 

   Like many foundations, Kellogg singles out its own community for attention: the Chicago-based MacArthur Foundation doles out money in Palm Beach County, Fla., not because of poverty in the area but because that community was important to the founder. 
In Battle Creek, the $60 million of Kellogg grants since 1931 have been pivotal in keeping the town alive. 
The foundation donated a community college, an ice rink and various clinics and training programs. 
But most unusual are the fastgrowing zoo and an 18-mile-long strip of park that winds along rivers and through town; every summer, the foundation pays teen-agers to work on these projects, making them job programs as much as monuments of civic beautification. 

   Even though the basic focus of the Kellogg Foundation hasn't changed, its staff has a chance at a summer retreat each year to argue for new approaches. 
At last June's retreat, the staff agreed to recommend funding in six "experimental" areas, including volunteerism and science education. 
But much of the talk was about the frightening national statistics showing rising drug use, pregnancy and suicide among teen-agers. 

   The staff and trustees decided that a foundation could try something far more intense and long-term than any government body could. 
They emerged with a 20-year program targeted to three Michigan communities: Battle Creek, an impoverished rural area and a segment of innercity Detroit. 
The foundation is now assembling groups of leaders in each community who will dream up a whole series of interrelated projects. 
The challenge is to try to make each community "the best place in the country to be born into." 

   When foundations do change course, it is often due to a changing of the guard at the top. 
Mr. Brown, who became president of the foundation in January, is a former county extension agent who has run many educational and agricultural programs in developing countries. 
He has talked the board into making grants in southern Africa. 
"Frankly, I was concerned that this foundation was looked upon as conservative and not risk-taking," Mr. Brown says. 
"I wanted to work in parts of Africa not considered safe." 

   After meetings with various African leaders and outside advisers, Mr. Brown delivered some $3.5 million for scholarships to black Africans in five countries, including South Africa, and there is more to come. 

   Once the money is spent, the hardest task for any foundation is figuring out whether anything was accomplished. 
Kellogg often includes money for evaluation as part of a grant, and supplies consultants to take surveys. 
Some goals are more easily measured than others: The foundation counts a local women's clinic a success partly because the infant-mortality rate in the county has dropped. 
But deciding whether the many Kellogg leadership programs are actually developing leaders is far trickier. 

   Failures are inevitable. 
Mr. Mawby cites an effort in the '60s to teach Eskimo men to raise musk oxen, whose fine wool could be knit into expensive sweaters by their wives. 
The women finally took to knitting. 
But the men, hunters and fishermen for generations, resisted their lessons in livestock-tending. 
The oxen developed breeding and disease problems. 
"It was a cultural contradiction," says Mr. Mawby. 
Despite a photo in the 1970 annual report of an Eskimo hugging an ox, Kellogg gave up and put the herd under a professional manager. 
But the women are still knitting and selling sweaters. 

   At the Kellogg Foundation, staff members like to say that "money doesn't solve problems; people do," but they still have to ask themselves, over and over, as they give away their millions: Which problems? 
Whose solutions?

<HEAD>Rambo III Revises Rambo II's Rewrite of Vietnam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last time we saw him, he had a question.
``Do we get to win this time?''
   And you did, Rambo II _ with a knife, a bow and arrow and just a
little help from a Vietnamese girlfriend. Three years later comes
``Rambo III,'' and the Vietnam War according to Sylvester Stallone
has come full circle.
   Captured by Soviet forces in Afghanistan, Rambo's mentor, Col.
Trautman, explains that wars against determined opponents on their
home ground cannot be won.
   ``We've already had our Vietnam,'' Trautman snarls. ``Now you're
gonna get yours.''
   With that tip of the beret to those gritty guys in the Viet
Cong, Rambo is off to Afghanistan on another private war _ and
maybe nothing's changed at all.
   ``Rambo still thinks that way,'' said Stallone, who also writes
the scripts. ``It's just different characters, see?''
   ``Rambo III'' features more of the cartoonish
``Roadrunner''-style violence of its predecessors, with the
slow-talking, fast-shooting fighting machine joining horse-mounted
holy warriors to subdue Soviet armor.
   It's the same invincible John J. Rambo that delighted President
Reagan at the time of the TWA hijacking in Beirut in 1985. ``After
seeing `Rambo' last night, I know what to do the next time this
happens,'' Reagan joked.
   ``That's wrong,'' Stallone says hotly. ``Rambo goes in to end
conflicts, not initiate them. He didn't go in to kick the Russians'
butts, he went in to get his friends out.''
   David Morrell, the former Iowa State English professor who
introduced Rambo in the novel ``First Blood,'' says he also was
offended by Reagan's jest.
   ``I can't say I was amused,'' Morrell said, ``because I was
distressed by the interpretation of the character. But I was
bemused because it's a way of being told how powerful the character
is. So I was gratified by that.''
   ``Rambo: First Blood Part II'' grossed $150 million in U.S.
theaters, spawned a line of fighting dolls and fearsome squirt guns
and made ``Rambo'' a part of the language.
   Reagan's joke marked the first time that any Associated Press
story from Washington mentioned Rambo, but other references
followed. Reagan invoked Rambo again on behalf of tax reform in
September 1985, but mostly Rambo became a term of abuse hurled by
Democrats.
   ``I see where Rambo is now `it' with the young,'' former vice
president Walter Mondale said three years ago, complaining of a
``Rambo streak'' in the White House. ``War is great. You can shoot
and won't be shot. Complexity is blown away by simple violence.''
   Stallone and Morrell, who recently came to New York to promote
the film, both say Rambo is a man of peace, not a jingoistic
murderer but a celluloid descendant of the frontier gunslinger
forced into one last battle.
   ``I find it incredible,'' Stallone says, his voice rising,
``every time some local atrocity occurs where a man puts on fatigue
pants and takes a rifle and goes into a shopping center, it's
`Rambo murderer slays three.'
   ``Rambo doesn't kill innocents. ... He's never killed unarmed
children.''
   In 1985, a 17-year-old in Missouri who had seen ``First Blood''
half a dozen times put on camouflage gear, picked up a kitchen
knife and a pistol and attacked his neighbors. He was convicted of
assault, burglary and armed criminal action.
   ``I can philosophically put it into this bag, that this child
was an accident waiting to happen,'' Stallone says. ``If it wasn't
Rambo, it was going to be another fictional character, which he
would just use as his _ I don't know _ his primer cord.''
   ``I keep close watch of this, and I know of only six cases in
which the Rambo character was blamed for violent events,'' says
Morrell. Three were in the United States, he said, and the others
in England, Australia and Canada.
   ``When I look into these things, what happened was that we were
dealing with psychotics, people who were unbalanced. If it hadn't
been one thing, it would have been that their Rice Krispies didn't
snap, crackle and pop properly in the morning.''
   So what does Rambo stand for? That depends, in part, whether
it's the books or the films.
   Morrell, who had Rambo criticizing U.S. policy in Central
America in his book of ``Rambo II,'' had suggested setting the $63
million ``Rambo III'' in Nicaragua.
   Stallone nixed that, in part because he didn't want another
jungle picture. But if Rambo fears anything, it's controversy.
   ``Until that conflict is really over, or until the line of
demarcation is drawn . . . then I can't jump into that,'' Stallone
said of Nicaragua.
   Afghanistan, however, was one place where Congress and Reagan
agreed on who wore the black hats.
   ``You have 300 million Russians vs. 12 million Afghans who are
undernourished, underarmed, undertrained and they are holding their
own. Finally, after 8{ years they are receiving some assistance,''
Stallone said.
   ``But Rambo doesn't go in to fight Russians. When they accuse me
or my characters of red-bashing, that is irresponsible, because he
never says, `I'm gonna get that dirty commie.' It never came out of
his mouth.''
   Gee, maybe it was all the exploding Russians in ``Rambo II'' or
the hulking Soviet boxer in ``Rocky IV'' that gave the impression
that Stallone harbors strong feelings about Moscow.
   ``I used to think I did,'' he said. ``I understand `glasnost,'
and the Soviets' need to do this. ... I'm all for `glasnost.' I
think the military branch is totally out of line, and they've made
mistakes, and this is their Vietnam.''

<TEXT>
   Kellogg Co., the nation's largest
maker of ready-to-eat cereals, plans a 5 percent cut in its U.S.
white-collar work force of about 2,900 by year's end, the company
said.
   The approximately 145 jobs to be cut will be achieved
selectively, mainly through attrition, said Kellogg spokesman Neil
Nyberg.
   ``We'll be examining all our U.S. operations and making
determinations about how our organization needs to be best staffed
to meet competitive challenges,'' he said.
   Kellogg has 1,400 salaried employees based at its Battle Creek,
Mich., headquarters. The total U.S. work force of the country's
largest cereal maker is 9,000.
   Kellogg's cereal market lead has been eroded this year by No. 2
General Mills Inc., and company officials have said they expect
1989 earnings, due out this month, to show the first decline in
annual earnings in 37 years.
   Kellogg's brand cereals include, among others, Rice Krispies,
Frosted Flakes, Special K and Froot Loops.
   Nyberg said Wednesday the reductions began in late 1989.

   See the movie. Eat the cereal.
   Ralston Purina Co. has made millions from that strategy,
one of the food industry's most unconventional marketing
devices.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An also-ran in the usual breakfast-flakes business,
Ralston dominates the fad-cereal sector by pouncing on
whatever film, cartoon or toy that happens to be hot, then
producing a cereal to ride the attendant promotional wave.
   These days it's "The Addams Family," a maple-sugary cereal
shaped like skulls, hands and headless dolls. Last summer, it
was "Prince of Thieves," another presweetened product that
capitalized on Kevin Costner's movie version of Robin Hood.
(It's still on the market.)
   Ralston, based in St. Louis, began licensing properties in
1983, when it created Donkey Kong cereal, based on a video
game. The subsequent procession of character-based cereals
has ranged from Ghostbusters to G.I. Joe.
   Most cereals cost millions of dollars to introduce. But
since the public (read kids) already knows all about Batman
or Nerds or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Ralston can avoid
that up-front expense. "We already have a highly visible and
leverageable license which we tie into," a company spokesman
says.
   But fad-based cereals also are short-lived, typically
dying after about 15 months. So Ralston, which makes most of
its money from dog food, batteries and Wonder bread,
maintains a full-time staff looking for properties it can
cerealize. "We continually fill the pipeline with new-product
introductions," the spokesman says.
   Nerds, a 1986 offering, faded fast, and Barbie's status as
the nation's favorite fashion doll didn't keep her at the
breakfast table. Among Ralston's biggest hits: Donkey Kong
and the still-popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, while
Ghostbusters cereal was on shelves for five years.
   Other cereal companies have tinkered with licensed
products, but Kellogg Co. got burned when anticipated "Star
Wars" sequels evaporated and undermined its C3PO cereal.
General Mills Inc. once marketed an "E.T." breakfast food but
says such items don't fit its strategy of resilient brands. A
one-time marketer of Mr. T cereal, Quaker Oats Co. recently
cut a deal to make a cereal based on Hollywood cartoon
characters.
   Perhaps because they're so fleeting, Ralston's cereal
boxes are more fun to read than most. "The Addams Family,"
for example, is cast as the "creepy, crunchy cereal with the
great taste you'll scream for."
   Such properties make for novel shapes. Breakfast with
Barbie included hearts, bows, cars, stars and the letter B.
The Nintendo Cereal System, introduced in 1989, featured
separate bags of fruit-flavored electronic-game figures.
Although they are fortified with vitamins and iron, the
cereals seem intended as much for amusement as nutrition.
Cabbage Patch Kids, ballyhooed as the first low-sugar
licensed cereal, also was Ralston's last.
   Would-be licensers pitch Ralston with all sorts of
suggestions. "To do a cereal deal is one of the best ways to
be in front of a child on a daily basis. It's wonderful
billboarding," says Andrea Hein, senior vice president of
merchandising and licensing at Paramount Pictures, a unit of
Paramount Communications Inc., which owns "The Addams
Family."
   Ralston won't discuss licensed-cereal finances -- a
spokesman says it doesn't want to divulge any trade secrets
-- but one licensing agent says the company likely pays
$100,000 or more for a typical property, plus royalties based
on sales.
   What's next? World Wrestling Federation Superstars.
Ralston says the product will be "sweet -- but no pushover."

Karl Lamers, foreign policy spokesman for the Christian Democrats in the
German Bundestag, is fast turning into Chancellor Kohl's unguided missile.
Lamers wants to set up a 'hard core' of states at the centre of Europe and
forge ahead with European federalism, much to the irritation of several
European governments. One of those least happy is his own. Bonn's finance
ministry takes exception to Lamers' suggestion that France, Germany and the
Benelux countries will automatically form the 'core' of European monetary
union.
Londoners have the chance to hear for themselves when Lamers brings his
federalist roadshow to town on Thursday, speaking at the Royal Institute of
International Affairs and the European think-tank, Federal Trust.
Will he tone down his federalism once at the heart of Euroscepticism? Let's
hope not; some snap, crackle and pop would make a nice change.

   Lean Cuisine is coming to Spain, and Perrier isn't far behind. 

   Countless other products familiar to consumers in the U.S. and the rest of Europe suddenly are popping up for the first time on the shelves of Spanish supermarkets. 
They are among the fruits of Spain's transformation from a quirky, protected and government-dominated economy into a wide-open battleground for the world's biggest corporations. 

   Kellogg Co. and Nestle S.A. want to persuade more Spaniards, who typically eat breakfast at a cafe later in the morning, to have a bowl of cereal before leaving home. 
Fiat S.p.A., Jaguar PLC and other auto makers are aggressively promoting their stylish imports and new, more competitive prices. 
Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Corp. and other big foreign bank holding companies have wooed customers away from Spanish banks by introducing new, relatively high-interest money-market accounts. 
Citibank branches -- there are 81 in Spain -- seem almost as plentiful in Madrid as they do in Manhattan. 

   The shift to this more open economy got a huge push last year when Spain joined the European Community, opening its borders to freer trade with the rest of the world. 
"EC entry meant a revolutionary increase in the level of competition in foreign markets and, undoubtedly for the first time in history, in domestic markets," says Carlos Solchaga, the economy and finance minister. 

   As has not been true elsewhere in Europe, foreign expansion here gets an unequivocally warm welcome. 
British politicians in recent years blocked U.S. companies' attempts to help rescue Britain's state-owned auto maker; the Spanish gladly handed control of their troubled car company, SEAT group, to Volkswagen AG of West Germany last year. 
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., rebuffed recently by the French, is building its first European plant in the hills north of Madrid in a joint venture with Spain's phone company that has been amply supported by Spanish government money. 
The two partners recently announced plans for a second factory. 

   In Spain, "there's a fresh attitude about things," says George W. Foyo, the managing director of AT&amp;T Microelectronica, which is building the first plant. 
Some 80% of the unit is owned by AT&amp;T. 

   Carlo De Benedetti, the Italian financier, praises Spain's "new entrepreneurial, international way of thinking." 

   When Generalissimo Francisco Franco died in 1975, he left behind a country of 38.4 million people, a nation oddly out of step - not quite modern, not quite backward. 
Spain concentrated first on instituting a democracy. 

   But Franco left behind an economic mess, too: state-owned companies and sanctioned monopolies that protected workers and deprived consumers of choice. 
Fresh coffee could be imported only through official agencies. 
Cigarettes were a government monopoly. 
Regulations kept gas stations a certain, minimum distance apart, and they were run by a monopoly Spain is just now starting to disband. 

   Spain's living standards remain far below the rest of Europe's. 
Spaniards drive fewer and smaller cars on inferior roads; you still can't drive from Madrid to any other major city by expressway. 
Appalling hospital conditions prompted a five-month strike this year by public-sector doctors. 
The government says it needs to spend $17 billion to streamline the poky and overmanned railway system. 

   So Spain wants to grab as much foreign investment, management and technology as it can. 

   Long-established foreign companies find doing business in Spain easier today, and entry into the European Community has sparked a wave of interest from many other companies. 
Spain combines some of the advantages of a rich country -- its democratic system made more secure by EC membership -- with the growth potential of a poor country. 
Foreign investment in Spain in the first quarter of this year was $3.75 billion, triple the year-earlier level. 

   Obviously, the government isn't acting merely so Spaniards can buy Lean Cuisine and Perrier; economists expect investments eventually to build more efficient industries. 
Critics of the government's policy call it a sellout. 

   "Perhaps in the future most Spaniards will be very well-fed, with very nice suits -- but all of them will be executives without real decision power," says Ramon Tamames, an economist and a member of the Spanish house of representatives who belongs to a small left-wing party. 

   Even within parts of the government, doubts sometimes arise, as was the case earlier this year before the government allowed Montedison S.p.A., the Italian chemical giant, to take over Antibioticos S.A., Spain's largest drug company. 
But government officials say they want to remove more barriers as soon as practicable. 
"It's better to have foreign capital than no capital at all," says Manuel Conthe, the finance ministry official who oversees foreign investments. 

   The rush of money, so far, coincides with better economic health. 
Employment, after sliding since the mid-1970s, at long last is rising. 
Spain last year created 250,000 jobs but, because more people entered the work force, the 20% unemployment rate hasn't budged. 
The economy last year grew 3%, the strongest showing in at least a decade, and this year Spain is expected to do even better. 

   "An important part of the country has learned to walk again, even to run," says Mr. De Benedetti. 
The financier is setting up a holding company here, adding Spanish companies to his growing European portfolio of businesses, which include office-equipment, computer-service and auto-parts concerns. 

   Other foreign companies already have snapped up Spanish companies making everything from soap to sausage. 
Last year, for instance, Gillette Co. acquired a locally known maker of natural cosmetics; Unilever Group took over a big meatpacker, and Pillsbury Co. bought a canner. 

   By backing locally known brands with more manufacturing and marketing expertise, acquirers hope to muscle in on a still-fragmented market. 
Spanish companies, lacking scale, capital and know-how, are often willing sellers. 
"There are a lot of Spanish companies that have been managed with the principles of the past; they haven't developed an efficient management culture," says Manuel Balmaseda, the general manager here of Hay Group, a consulting unit of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. of Britain. 
"It becomes very, very appealing for a foreign company to buy them." 

   Even experienced investors like the new climate. 
Nestle, for instance, has done business in Spain since 1881, coping with the Civil War and then a fascist dictatorship that regulated supply of critical ingredients. 
The Swiss giant remembers when it took more than a year to get approval to bring more capital into Spain. 
Today, approvals usually take a month, and just a one-page application form. 

   In 1983, the government ended a ban on the sale of packaged ground coffee. 
The restrictions were originally intended to conserve foreign exchange and to maintain the purity of the coffee sold. 
But, by the 1980s, all that was being protected was the business of local coffee-roasting companies. 
Nestle has since bought three coffee companies. 

   Nestle believes that Spanish consumers, like other Europeans before them, will become more Americanized. 
"What's interesting," says Francisco Castaner, the head of Nestle's Spanish unit, "is how powerful is the image of the American style of life." 
Accordingly, the company decided to challenge Kellogg's hold on the tiny market for breakfast cereal -- even though consumption probably won't reach U.S. levels for decades. (In 1984, the average Spaniard consumed just three ounces of breakfast cereal, while Americans ate nine pounds, according to one estimate.) 
Kellogg just announced plans for a big expansion of its Spanish plant, voicing its confidence in the potential market. 

   Similarly, the market for frozen Lean Cuisine dinners -- a U.S.-developed product Nestle sells in other European countries -- and other frozen foods is limited at the moment. 
Fewer than 30% of Spanish households have proper freezers, much less microwave ovens; few of the mom-and-pop stores where many Spaniards still shop have big freezer cases. 
But "all the habits are changing," says Mr. Castaner. 

   Aspirations are high. 
The importers of Perrier water, who already sell Lindt chocolates from Switzerland, hope to appeal to spreading status consciousness. 
Another sign of the times: Peugeot S.A., the French car maker, is selling a special Lacoste edition of its compact 205 model with a crocodile logo on the side of the car. 

   Along with consumer goods, the Spanish are importing more capital equipment, aiding a needed modernization of manufacturing. 
Among the most prominent projects is the $200 million AT&amp;T plant; it is expected to begin making advanced computer chips for its partner, Cia.Telefonica Nacional de Espana, and for other European customers later this year. 
Despite such visible high-tech projects, most Spaniards say the country's future lies in medium-technology goods. 
In autos, for instance, investments by Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp. and, more recently, Volkswagen have made Spain a center of small-car production. 

   Aside from food-processing, where sunny Spain has a natural edge, Spain offers few clear advantages in manufacturing compared with the rest of Europe. 
Costs are fast catching up with the rest of Europe; one survey says Madrid real estate soared 40% in the last year. 
Labor laws are rigid; it is difficult to move people from plant to plant and all but impossible to lay them off. 

   The government is trying to reduce last year's 8% inflation rate. 
But unions are challenging the government's wage policies, sometimes winning inflationary increases. 
Madrid airport and subway stations were filthy in April when cleaners were on strike. 
A slowdown by ground workers at Iberia, the state airline, caused flights to be canceled and annoyed customers waiting for service at ticket counters. 
And on two recent weekends, unions closed down the nation's bingo parlors. 

   The labor troubles and interest rates -- the government briefly pushed interbank rates above 20% in May -- gave investors on Madrid's stock exchange the jitters a few weeks ago. 
But the ebullience accompanying Spain's entry into the European Community persists. 
Vice premier Alfonso Guerra says that Spain hasn't had it so good for four centuries. 

   The national high may well last until 1992, when Spain plans to celebrate the 500th anniversary of Columbus's discovery of America with a World's Fair in Seville, the Summer Olympics in Barcelona and the end of the transition period to full EC membership. 
And foreign investors help sustain the optimism.

   One oatmeal box promises to reduce cholesterol. 
A rival package says its ingredients promote healthy skin, aid digestion and even help heal wounds. 
Another cereal alludes to cancer prevention. 

   As cereal companies make their section of the supermarket sound more like a drugstore, government regulators, medical groups and consumer advocates are raising objections. 
General Mills Inc., for example, can't sell its new Benefit cereal in Texas until it substantiates the product's reputed cholesterol-lowering properties. 

   In an effort to mollify the regulators, Kellogg Co. issued a call yesterday for the industry to police itself. 
The biggest U.S. cereal maker proposed a marketing guide that seeks to differentiate between advertised "health messages" and "health claims." 

   The Battle Creek, Mich., company says manufacturers should provide a "health message" about a total diet that may include the product. 
An inappropriate "health claim" would be one that touts a specific product or ingredient as preventing or treating a disease. 
"Any statement regarding a specific food that goes beyond the concept of a total diet . . . should be subjected to {the Food and Drug Administration's} regulatory approval process," Kellogg contends. 

   Kellogg urged that even health "messages" be used only where they can be supported by what it called "adequately substantiated scientific studies" -- a concept it didn't immediately define. 

   "This is unquestionably an indirect shot at General Mills," says John McMillin, food analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., noting the questions raised about the study cited in General Mills' advertising for Benefit. 
As for how one can distinguish between a "claim" and a "message," he says, "it's a very fine line." 

   Kellogg also seemed to send a mixed message. 
Even as it proposed the industry standard, the company rolled out a new cereal called "Heartwise," a name that seems to make a health claim. 
Kellogg says Heartwise has more soluble fiber than any other ready-to-eat cereal. 
That's important, Kellogg contends, because "health experts" recommend that Americans eat more fiber as part of a good diet. 

   The health-claims issue currently is being tackled by the FDA and Congress, which are drafting new food-labeling laws. 
But several states, weary of that protracted process, are starting to act on their own. 
In Texas, where General Mills just this week met again over the Benefit issue, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Gardner says he has misgivings about any health claim or message. 
"Heart attacks are way too serious to put on cereal boxes or in 30-second TV spots," he says. 

   General Mills isn't the only cereal company to come under Mr. Gardner's scrutiny. 
He has been talking with Quaker Oats Co. for more than a year over the cereal maker's claims that oatmeal reduces the risk of heart disease. 
"Quaker is hyping a product," he says. 
"If you have cholesterol problems, you don't see Quaker. 
You see your doctor." 

   Ronald Bottrell, a spokesman for Quaker in Chicago, cites several studies that found that "both oatmeal and oat bran, as part of a low-fat diet, helped contribute to a cholesterol reduction." 
He especially notes one study, done at Northwestern University Medical School, which Quaker helped to fund. 
As for Kellogg's call for self-policing, Mr. Bottrell says, "Food manufacturers should be able to show a link between their products and any health-related effects they could have -- provided it is based on reliable scientific research." 

   In Minneapolis, a General Mills official took issue with Kellogg's proposal. 
"My feeling is that the consumer is not going to see a difference between a health message and a health claim," said Vice Chairman Arthur Schulze. 
"It looks like they've made a distinction without a difference." 

   Self-regulation may be in for a grilling. 
According to Norine Olson-Elm of the Minnesota attorney general's office of consumer affairs, "We're not scientists, but we can rely on experts as well as companies can, and we will be doing that." 

   The FDA plans hearings around the country, beginning in October, on food labeling. 
"We expect health claims will be the most contentious issue," says agency spokesman Jeff Nesbit. 
"Our plan is, by early next year, to propose a regulation that covers the entire range of food labeling . . . . 
Consumers want a change." 

   Indeed they do, says a spokeswoman for the American Heart Association, which is developing its version of the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval in response to requests from perplexed shoppers. 
Called "HeartGuide," the program will review various foods for their ability to help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. 
Those items that pass association guidelines -- manufacturers will pay for the product evaluation -- would bear an endorsement sticker.

<LEADPARA>  THE art world has been snapping and crackling with the repercussions of pop
mania since the '60s, but few people know that this soooooo American
phenomenon was actually launched in Britain the previous decade.;    Even
fewer realize that one of the people who got it started and became its chief
spokesman was the late Peter Reyner Banham, who moved to Santa Cruz in 1980 to
teach art history on the University of California campus there and remained in
the States until shortly before his death in 1988.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  PARENTS OF POP ART
AMERICAN MANIA OF THE '60S HAD ROOTS IN '50S
BRITAIN  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Art  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "The Independent Group: Postwar Britain and the Aesthetics of Plenty," at
the University Art Museum, UC-Berkeley, celebrates those British pop roots in
a fascinating yet difficult show that should not be missed.;    It sheds light
on a period when a bunch of argumentative British rebels -- artists,
architects, writers -- staked out a mythical post-war world of plenty (ours)
and defined an art made for mass audiences.;    Mesmerized by technology and
American mass-media imagery, especially as distilled in illustrations from
sci-fi magazines, in comics, automobile designs, movies and music -- they came
to be called "The Fathers of Pop" even though (remember, this was the '50s)
their group included women.;    Known as the Independent Group (IG), the crew
included Magda Cordell, Richard Hamilton, Nigel Henderson, John McHale,
William Turnbull, Eduardo Paolozzi and Alison and Peter Smithson; and critics
Lawrence Alloway and Banham (who was also an architectural writer).;    The IG
show is a how-when-where-and-why kind of exhibit, bursting with ideas -- many
important, others less so. It is short on painting and sculpture, but that's
the nature of the movement: How do you illustrate discussion? British pop's
chief energy came out of talk; its visuals were mostly reproductions.;    The
exhibition is a collaborative effort begun by University Art Museum director
Jacquelynn Baas before she left a museum at Dartmouth. Visitors will do well
to read the free gallery handout before roaming the galleries. It explains how
the works relate to the milieu of the '50s. The splendid, informative catalog
is a must, too.;    There's a jukebox, for instance, blasting out American
chart-toppers such as the Shirelles' rendition of "I Didn't Mean to Hurt You."
The show focuses on such kitsch, not as art masterpieces but as examples of
what critic Alloway called "the fine art/pop art continuum" -- reflecting
"what society does.";    Of course, the show also reflects the IG's interest
in '50s intellectual currents, earlier art and architecture, as well.
According to one account, the Smithsons' design for cluster housing was
inspired by a reproduction they saw of a Jackson Pollock painting.;    Other
members, especially Paolozzi, drew on the legacy of the dadaists and
surrealists. Paolozzi's sculptures from the '50s, made of old machine parts
cast in bronze, flaunt his skepticism about traditional fine-art values.;   
His "Contemplative Object," for instance, sits on the floor sans pedestal,
foreshadowing bronzes produced by mid-'80s artists. Paolozzi's collage, "Real
Gold," features various American pop icons -- a bikini-clad pin-up girl,
Mickey Mouse and a can of Real Gold California Lemon Juice.;    But it is
artist Hamilton whose work most effectively encapsulates British pop, which he
later described as "a new landscape of secondary filtered material.";    In
his crisp, linear collages here, the artist cleverly pulls together bits and
pieces of advertising imagery -- for everything from bras to Chryslers -- and
transforms them with his keen graphics eye into art.;    Unfortunately
Hamilton's celebrated, prophetic 1956 collage "Just What is it That Makes
Today's Homes So Different, So Appealing?" is in another show, though a photo
of it is here.;    In this witty collage, the word "Pop" appears for the first
time in art. But more than this, all the chief image sources for later
American pop art are squeezed into this picture of a room from an apartment:
The comics became Roy Lichtenstein's wellspring; the TV set and chunky sofa
inspired Claes Oldenberg's motel sets of the '60s; the Ford logo and the
canned ham served others.;    Even more revealing of the Independent Group's
bent are the reconstructions of six mini-environments from the group's
pioneering exhibit called "This is Tomorrow," mounted at London's Institute of
Contemporary Arts in 1956.;    One is a constructivist environment with space
defined by geometric panels. Another is a walk-through futurist fun house,
full of twists, slanted walls, and black-and-white circles twirling like
pinwheels. The most eloquent is a patio and pavilion designed by Henderson,
Paolozzi and the Smithsons.;    Meant to represent "the range of human
activity," it uses a wheel to symbolize movement and the machine; rocks and
shards of antiquities are visual metaphors for contemplation; sand suggests
the passing of time; the garden itself, the concepts of nurturing and rebirth.
The environment's mirrored walls reflect visitors as they walk through, making
these images a part of the piece as well.;    For me, more than anything else,
this haunting piece speaks most strongly about the second half of the 20th
century, most of which we've now lived through, and lays bare the fragility of
human experience.;    The "aesthetics of plenty," a phrase coined by critic
Alloway and used in the show's title, refers to a "classless lifestyle based
on high-quality mass production (of goods), rapid obsolescence" and mass
consumption -- concepts with far-reaching impact on our lives.;    The first
show to place this movement in perspective, "The Independent Group" documents
a significant moment that forever changed the course of modern art.;  The

<HEAD>Kellogg Introduces New Cereal It Claims Lowers Cholesterol</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kellogg Co., trying to take advantage of
consumers' increasing concerns about health, on Wednesday entered
the growing market for foods that purportedly lower cholesterol.
   Kellogg at a news conference unveiled a new cereal, Heartwise,
which contains oat bran and psyllium. The two grains are high in
soluble fiber, which is believed to help the body rid itself of
cholesterol.
   High levels of cholesterol have been shown to increase the risk
of heart disease.
   In introducing its new product, which is expected to reach stores
in the fall, Kellogg is challenging one of its biggest competitors,
General Mills Inc., whose Benefit cereal contains the same
ingredients.
   Kellogg said it would spend $40 million in the first year to
advertise and promote the new cereal. It will be marketed nationwide.
   A variety of oat bran products have exploded onto the market
since researchers said the grain could help reduce cholesterol
levels. But psyllium, a grain grown mainly in India, is a relative
newcomer in terms of foods connected with healthy hearts, although
it has been used for years in laxatives such as Procter &amp; Gamble
Co.'s Metamucil.
   The outer husk of psyllium contains soluble fiber that has been
shown to reduce cholesterol, the cereal makers claim.
   General Mills' promotion of Benefit has been challenged by
Procter &amp; Gamble, which was ordered by the Food and Drug
Administration to refrain from advertising health claims for
Metamucil. Procter &amp; Gamble contends psyllium is a drug and should
be regulated by the FDA.
   However, the FDA, instead of declaring psyllium a drug _ and
thereby forcing companies to undergo lengthy approval procedures _
is developing a regulation governing health claims on product labels
including foods such as cereal.
   Other cereals made by Kellogg, based in Battle Creek Mich.,
include Corn Flakes and Rice Krispies.
   Heartwise will be targeted to consumers age 35 and older, but
Kellogg is planning an advertising campaign that promotes the
cereal's benefits for children as well as adults.

warpath. This time, it is about the state of education in California.;   
Never one to sit back and let others act on his concerns, Graham held an
informal meeting on the future of education at his home in Mill Valley on
Sunday. Among the participants were State Superintendent of Schools Bill
Honig, former San Jose mayor Tom McEnery, former governor Jerry Brown and
rockers Jerry Garcia, Carlos Santana and Paul Kantner. The purpose of the
meeting was to discuss the issue and to devise long- and short-term ways of
funding, and lobbying for, education.;    One of the short-term suggestions
was a vast benefit show -- what one of the participants at the meeting
described as "Education-Aid." Long-term, there was talk of establishing an
education lobbying group like the Sierra Club.;    But Tuesday, by phone from
Santa Fe, Graham was talking more immediately about an upcoming vote in the
state legislature. "In a few days, they are going to vote on the governor's
plan to cut back $850 million from education," Graham said. "We can't allow
that (cutback) to happen . . . We must stand up about this issue. The governor
must hear from the people on this . . .;    "All the time, we hear about the
Kurds and the famine in Ethiopia," Graham said by phone Tuesday from Santa Fe.
"Those are all valid problems that need our attention and money. But the
difference between the jungle and civilization is education.";     MILLER
TIME, AGAIN -- Two months ago, the Black Crowes were booted off the ZZ Top
tour by the guzzlers at Miller Beer, because of remarks the group's Chris
Robinson made about corporate sponsorship. Undeterred, the Crowes began a tour
of their own. For their opening act they picked Maggie's Dream.;    There was
just one problem: Three days into that tour, the Crowes were driving along on
their way to Memphis, Tenn., when the car radio spit out a Miller commercial
performed by -- you guessed it -- Maggie's Dream.;    "I think it's a little
slimy that no one told us," Robinson said. ". . . Here we are three days into
the tour, and then we learn they are singing songs for a company we've run
into problems with.";    Their feathers thoroughly ruffled, the Crowes gave
Maggie's Dream the heave-ho from the tour.;     JAZZ AT FILOLI -- Benny Barth

<LEADPARA>  WAKE up: It's time for breakfast.;    Too busy, you say. Never can eat in the
morning. Got to get the kids up, dog walked, cat fed, coffee made, paper read,
lunches packed, self washed and dressed and out the door. Who has time to eat
breakfast, let alone cook it?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     True, weekday mornings are not the time for most of us to whip up pancakes
or even scramble an occasional egg. But aren't you weary of the old
cereal-bagel-toast-juice routine?;    Thought so. Why not rethink the day's
first meal? How about breakfast pizza? A baked apple? A toasted slice of
homemade quick bread with cheese? A made-by-you frozen yogurt pop? A warm
slice of homemade quiche?;    Breakfast fruit;  Imagine the first bite from a
bowl of cold, juicy grapefruit and orange sections, sprinkled with a few
berries and a mango slice or so.;    Impossible? Nah. Not if you're willing to
do a little planning, a little night-before preparation and a little weekend
baking. Then, rely on the microwave and blender to jump-start your mornings.; 
  While you're at all this breakfast revamping, consider starting a family
tradition of Saturday or Sunday morning pancakes, waffles or French toast.
Make a double batch and freeze the rest. Put them in one layer on a baking
sheet and freeze until firm; then bag or wrap. You can take out one or more as
you need and microwave them.;    Thoughts for food;  Here are some more ideas
for breakfast. (A few of them are from an article in a September 1988 issue of
1,001 Home Ideas magazine.);    (box) Breakfast pizza: Why not? And who says
pizza has to have tomato sauce? A slice of mozzarella cheese on an English
muffin or pita bread, a sprinkle of oregano, a minute under the broiler and
you're set.;    (box) Bake a breakfast quiche from your favorite recipe, but
substitute Canadian bacon, liquid egg substitute and reduced-fat cheese for
higher-fat ingredients such as bacon or ham, eggs and rich cheese. Cool, slice
into servings, wrap well and freeze. Rewarm in the microwave.;    (box) Top
your favorite toast with sliced tomatoes and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.
Broil until bubbly.;    (box) Top a rice cake with cottage cheese and berries
or peanut butter and bananas.;    (box) For quick baked apples, prepare the
night before and refrigerate. Rewarm in the microwave and add a dollop of
vanilla yogurt.;    (box) Yogurt. Need we say more? Try it with a helping of
wheat germ on top. Stir in a spoonful of all-fruit spread. Add a few raisins.;
   (box) Spend a little extra for individual boxes of cereal to toss into a
briefcase or lunch box. Or be more frugal and portion out cereal from a big
box.;    For kid power;  Here are some child-friendly breakfast ideas. They're
easy enough for older kids to do themselves.;    (box) Make fruit and cheese
kebabs: Alternate cubes of cheese and fruit on small wooden skewers, wrap well
and refrigerate overnight.;    (box) Make your own trail mix and pack it into
little plastic bags or containers to eat on the way to school or work.;   
(box) For fun, make miniature muffins instead of regular size. If they're a
few days old, split and toast them, then spread with cream cheese.;    (box)
Remember, chocolate milk is not the worst thing in the world.;    (box) Frost
a banana with peanut butter, roll in crushed cereal, wrap and freeze. Yum.;   
(box) A sandwich for breakfast? Put together a cheese sandwich the night
before and quickly grill it in the morning.;    (box) Scoop yogurt into an ice
cream cone. Add sprinkles of wheat germ or raisins or a dollop of all-fruit
jam.;    (box) Along the same lines, dish up a breakfast parfait or banana
split. Recipes below.;    (box)  A breakfast ice-cream bar? Make them with
yogurt and fruit or fruit juice and fruit. Cold and yummy.;   BREAKFAST POPS; 
 1 8-ounce container yogurt;  1 small sliced banana;  1/2 cup sliced
strawberries or other fruit;   Stir fruit into yogurt, then spoon into paper
or plastic cups. Insert a ice-cream stick (or small plastic spoon) and freeze.
When firm, wrap in foil. Makes 2 small pops.; (hbox);    This recipe, which
goes together in about 5 minutes, is from an old Southern Living. Be careful
not to over-mix the batter; it doesn't have to be smooth. A crack in the top
of the loaf is normal; it's also normal for quick breads to look pretty flat,
not domed like yeast breads. (Low-cholesterol cooks could substitute 2 egg
whites for the beaten egg.);    I've also baked this as muffins (they're done
in about 25 minutes). Bread or muffins freeze well.;      APPLESAUCE-PECAN
BREAD;  2 cups all-purpose flour (or 1 1/2 cups flour and 1/2 cup wheat germ);
 1 tablespoon baking powder;  1/2 teaspoon baking soda;  1/2 teaspoon salt; 
3/4 cup sugar;  1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon;  1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg; 
1/2 cup chopped pecans;  1/2 cup raisins;  1 egg, beaten;  1 cup applesauce
(or 1 cup mashed ripe banana or 1 cup canned pumpkin puree);  1/4 cup
vegetable oil;   Combine first 7 ingredients in a large bowl; stir in pecans
and raisins. Make a well in center of dry mixture. Combine egg, applesauce and
oil; add to dry ingredients, stirring just until moistened. Spoon mixture into
a greased and floured loaf pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 40 to 45 minutes or
until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in pan 10
minutes; remove from pan, and let cool on a wire rack.; (hbox);    This is
from a baby and toddler cookbook called "Mommy Made (And Daddy, Too)" by
Martha and David Kimmel (1990, $13.95, Bantam trade paperback). It's good for
grown-ups as well.;  PEANUT BUTTER BANANARAMA SHAKE;  1 very ripe banana,
peeled and sliced;  2 tablespoons smooth peanut butter;  1 cup or more milk; 
2 ice cubes (or more);  1 teaspoon honey (optional);   Place all ingredients
in a blender and whirl until smooth. Add more milk if too thick. Serve soon or
banana will start to darken. Makes enough for 1 adult and 1 child or 2
toddlers.; (hbox);   BREAKFAST BANANA SPLIT;  1 small banana, sliced in half
lengthwise;  8 ounce carton vanilla yogurt;  2 tablespoons sliced strawberries
or raspberries;  2 tablespoons blueberries;  2 tablespoons crushed pineapple; 
2 tablespoons granola or chopped nuts;   If you have banana-split dishes, use
them. Otherwise, use a small oblong dish. Place banana halves on sides of
dish, then place yogurt in three scoops down center. Top each scoop with
fruit, then sprinkle with granola or nuts. Serve immediately. Makes 1
serving.;    Note: Try banana split with other flavors of yogurt and your
favorite fruits. How about lemon yogurt and chopped mangoes or peaches?;
(hbox);    These are easy enough for anyone to make. Wrap bars individually
and grab one on the way out the door when you're really in a rush. The recipe
is from Pillsbury.;     NO-BAKE GRANOLA BARS;  1/2 cup firmly packed brown
sugar;  1/2 cup light corn syrup; 1 cup peanut butter; 1 teaspoon vanilla; 1
1/2 cups quick-cooking rolled oats; 1 1/2 cups crisp rice cereal; 1 cup
raisins;  1/2 cup coconut;  1/2 cup sunflower seeds; 2 tablespoons sesame
seeds;   In a medium saucepan, combine brown sugar and corn syrup. Bring to a
boil, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Stir in peanut butter and
vanilla; blend well. Add remaining ingredients and mix well. Press into
ungreased 9-inch-square pan. Cool, then cut into 20 bars.; (hbox);  TROPICAL
SHAKE;  2  tablespoons frozen orange juice concentrate;  1 cup ginger ale or
skim milk;  2 tablespoons non-fat dry milk powder;   Handful of ice cubes; 
1/4 cup canned crushed pineapple;  2 tablespoons coconut;   Blend orange
juice, ginger ale or milk, and dry milk in blender until creamy. Add ice,
pineapple and coconut and blend again. Serve at once.;    Note: You can
substitute frozen pineapple juice concentrate and bananas for orange juice and
pineapple.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Kellogg Recalls Frosted Mini-Wheats With Too Much Vitamin A</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kellogg Co. has announced a 25-state
recall of about 29,000 boxes of Frosted Mini-Wheats Biscuits cereal
that may contain too much vitamin A and cause a burning sensation
in the mouth.
   The giant cereal maker also said Thursday it had withdrawn an
unspecified number of boxes of Rice Krispies cereal at distribution
points because they may contain ten times more iron than normal.
   The levels of vitamin A found in 16-ounce and 20-ounce boxes of
Frosted Mini-Wheats coded BC117 and BC118 with the expiration date
of Aug. 2, 1989, may cause short-term discomfort such as a burning,
tingling sensation in the mouth, but will not cause any major
health risks, company spokesman Joe Stewart said.
   The levels of iron found in Rice Krispies with the code dates
June 22-24, 1989, and the letter ``M'' are at 100 percent of the
U.S. recommended daily allowance, but would not produce any health
threat, Stewart said. The product normally contains 10 percent of
the U.S. RDA of iron.
   In both cases, the cereals may not taste right, Stewart said.
   Stewart said he knew of three or four complaints to the company
about the Frosted Mini-Wheats from Michigan consumers since
Wednesday. At least one consumer experienced a burning sensation
after eating the cereal.
   The cereal normally contains 25 percent of the U.S. RDA of
vitamin A, and some of the recalled boxes have contained as much as
four times that amount, Stewart said.
   The Detroit district of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
said it had been advised of the recall and the withdrawal.
   Kellogg advised consumers with the affected Frosted Mini-Wheats
not to eat any of the product and return the entire package top
with the code dates to the company.
   In the case of the Rice Krispies, the company stopped
distributing the affected product Aug. 10, but no consumer recall
will be ordered, Stewart said. He said any consumer dissatisfied
with the product may follow the directions listed on the box for
return of the product.
   The states affected by the recall of the Frosted Mini-Wheats
are: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa,
Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Maryland, Montana,
Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin.

   BATTLE CREEK, Mich. -- Kellogg Co. soon will introduce its
first presweetened cereal for kids in 15 years, a four-grain
flaked product called Bigg Mixx.
   The ready-to-eat product includes rolled oats, rice,
toasted corn flakes and whole-grain wheat, flavored with
brown sugar and cinnamon. One variety also comes with
raisins.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Most of Bigg Mixx's $22 million rollout budget will focus
on a fanciful creature -- part chicken, wolf, moose and pig
-- that will speak for the product. The character, named for
the cereal, joins Tony the Tiger and Toucan Sam in Kellogg's
marketing menagerie.
   The last successful presweetened item from the world's
largest maker of ready-to-eat cereals was Frosted Krispies, a
1975 rollout.
   Kellogg's hopes for a new hit with kids and their parents
last year was S.W. Graham, a graham-flour cereal with a
nostalgia advertising campaign. But when initial sales didn't
meet expectations, the company quietly took it off the
market.

   BATTLE CREEK, Mich. -- Kellogg Co. reported record results
for the first quarter, reflecting continued strong overseas
sales and an accelerating turnaround in the U.S.
   The world's largest cereal company said earnings rose 69%,
to $163.1 million, or $1.35 a share, from $96.3 million, or
79 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales increased nearly 18%,
to $1.42 billion from $1.2 billion. But the company cautioned
against multiplying by four to calculate full-year figures as
it forecasted an "extremely challenging" year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While an intense sales effort domestically was paying off,
last year's first quarter was soft. Moreover, officials
acknowledged that competition from Ralston Purina Co. and
other private-label competitors has kept Kellogg from raising
prices as much as it might like on such core brands as corn
flakes and raisin bran.
   The company also said that its biggest children's cereal
introduction in several years, Bigg Mixx, wasn't meeting
expectations. "It's just not there," said William E. LaMothe,
chairman and chief executive officer. Kellogg introduced the
product with much fanfare last year.
   Mr. LaMothe said early sales of the company's newest
cereal, Cinnamon Mini Buns, were encouraging. But he said
that high marketing costs associated with rollouts would
result in more rigorous testing of future cereals; two may be
introduced domestically this year, and one is likely to be a
presweetened product, he said.
   Arnold Langbo, Kellogg's recently named president, said at
the annual meeting here Friday that Kellogg had boosted its
share of the domestic ready-to-eat cereal market to 38.8% in
the first quarter from 37.5% in the previous quarter.
   The gain came partly at the expense of runner-up General
Mills Inc., whose tonnage share Kellogg said had slipped to
23.8% from 24.3%. Ralston, the Nabisco unit of RJR Nabisco
Inc., and the Post unit of Kraft General Foods, a subsidiary
of Philip Morris Cos., also gave up market share, Kellogg
said.
   The company credited the end of the oat-bran fad, which
had made General Mills's Cheerios the nation's top-selling
brand, for some of its bottom-line improvement in the U.S.
   Overseas, Kellogg remains undisputed king, with what Mr.
Langbo said was a 51.1% share. The company sells in 130
countries, and Mr. Langbo said it is developing omnibus TV
commercials that can be easily customized for each market,
thus reducing marketing costs.
   In response to inquiries from shareholders, Mr. LaMothe
said Kellogg's board was studying the possibility of a stock
split, although he said no decision had been made. Kellogg
closed last Friday at $95.50, unchanged, in composite trading
on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEAD>Texas Slaps Embargo on Kellogg's Heartwise Cereal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA PERLMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas officials have imposed a distribution embargo on Kellogg
Co.'s Heartwise cereal in Texas in a dispute over labeling.
   On Tuesday, the Texas Health Department ordered warehouses to
halt distribution of the cereal. It accused Kellogg of deceptive
labeling and of failing to warn consumers about potential allergic
reactions to psyllium, a whole grain touted by Kellogg as a
cholesterol fighter.
   Texas is the only state that has sought to ban sales of
Heartwise, which was introduced last year by the Battle Creek,
Mich.-based cereal maker and has prompted a federal inquiry into
the safety of psyllium.
   Last week, Kellogg filed a federal lawsuit in Dallas against the
Texas Health Department and the attorney general's office to try to
ward off the embargo and allow the company to retain its current
labeling on the product.
   ``For the state of Texas to detain Heartwise on the basis of
their belief that it's an unapproved drug is totally ridiculous and
a total disregard for the science behind psyllium,'' Kellogg
spokesman Joseph Stewart said.
   Kellogg maintains that psyllium, a grain grown mainly in India,
has been scientifically shown to help reduce cholesterol when used
as part of a complete nutritional diet. The soluble fiber is used
in laxatives and its inclusion in Heartwise has led to a
controversy in the food industry about whether the cereal should be
considered a drug or food.
   The Food and Drug Administration is currently reviewing data on
psyllium's safety and the company's cholesterol-fighting claims.
   ``I think this goes back to the labeling of foods with drug-like
claims,'' said Dan Sowards, chief of the food branch for the Texas
Department of Health. ``The FDA ... has said products that
continued to make health claims would be subject to scrutiny.''
   Sowards said his department has asked Kellogg to change the
product's name and remove heart symbols from the box as well as
references to hospital endorsements. It also has asked for
inclusion of warnings about potential allergic reactions to
psyllium.
   Sowards said data given to the FDA by Kellogg include at least
50 cases of allergic reactions to the grain and some of them
required hospitalization.
   Kellogg maintains Heartwise has been shown to be safe. Most
grains, including wheat, cause allergic reactions in a very small
percentage of people, Stewart said.
   Three independent university studies released in April found
psyllium to be more effective in fighting cholesterol than wheat or
oat bran cereals.
   Stewart said the embargo's timing _ less than a week after the
lawsuit was filed _ shows that it is ``politically motivated and
not out of any concern for public safety.''
   He said the company is worried about the controversy's affect on
the cereal's sales, which have been disappointing.
   John McMillin, a food analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities of
New York, said those worries are justified.
   ``This just might be the nail in the coffin for Heartwise,''
McMillin said. ``It is my own feeling that the state of Texas has
no business doing this ... but consumers, and the state of Texas,
seem to perceive this as a drug and not as a food.''
   General Mills Inc. pulled its psyllium-based cereal, Benefit, in
January, citing poor sales.

Kellogg $100 Million Lawsuit
Aims at 'Natural' Claims
In Post Bran Cereal Ads

   The raisin wars have begun. 

   Kellogg Co., based in Battle Creek, Mich., fired the first shot yesterday with a $100-million-plus lawsuit against General Foods Corp. and its advertising agency. 
The provocation: nine television and print advertisements over the past two years allegedly implying that Post Natural Raisin Bran is more natural than Kellogg's Raisin Bran. 

   "False and misleading," Kellogg huffed in a statement. 
No comment, replied spokesmen for White Plains, N.Y.-based General Foods, a unit of Philip Morris Cos., New York, and Grey Advertising Inc., also of New York. 

   Kellogg, the No. 1 raisin bran maker, attacked No. 2 Post's ads on three fronts. 
First, it said they "inaccurately claimed that the raisins . . . are natural and unprocessed." 
According to the lawsuit, those raisins are coated with glycerol and coconut oil. 

   Second, Kellogg said that in visual raisin vs. raisin displays, Post doctors its own raisins to look better. 
"The extraneous cereal that would cling to the raisins has been cleaned off," a Kellogg spokesman charged. 
He said Post bran flakes do cling to the Post raisins -- because of the glycerol and coconut oil coating. 
He declined to elaborate on whether cereal also clung to Kellogg raisins and whether that was good or bad. 

   The final alleged infraction is that Post advertising -- including television spots by country singer John Denver -- inaccurately imply that Post raisin bran has less sugar. 
"Join me for breakfast . . . my way. 
Welcome to my morning, Welcome to my day," invites Mr. Denver in one ad as he pulls up to a bowl of Post raisin bran. 
"You know, people used to think what made a great raisin bran was just a couple of scoops of raisins," he adds in a veiled jibe against a Kellogg slogan. 

   "Taste Post's Natural raisin bran," he continues. 
"Post uses naturally sweet raisins. 
They don't sugar coat them like some other raisin brans do." 

   That is true, acknowledged Kellogg. 
But Post does use sugar in the bran, according to the Kellogg spokesman. 
"So when you compare a serving of their cereal vs. a one-ounce serving of Kellogg cereal, both products have the same amount of sugar," he added. 

   Kellogg, in the suit filed in U.S. District Court in Kalamazoo, Mich., said it wants $100 million in punitive damages, as well as treble the unspecified amount of actual damages. 
It also wants "corrective advertising," and a "permanent injunction prohibiting General Foods from disseminating false or misleading advertising." 

   This is actually the second legal battle this year involving Kellogg and a raisin product. 
Last spring, General Mills Inc. sued Kellogg over trademark infringement involving oatmeal raisin crisps and apple raisin crisps. 
Kellogg filed a countersuit and those claims are still pending.

DAVE DISTEL: ROLL THE FILM! PADRES PICTURE BIG YEAR IN '90 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Excuse me, but would it be gauche or even un-American to be talking baseball on 
the eve of the National Football League's conference championships? 
</P>
<P>
It shouldn't be, not around here. 
</P>
<P>
After all, it has been seven years since the local football heroes were party 
to any activity in January. It is interesting to ponder how many Super Bowls 
will be played in San Diego before San Diego plays in a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
This then leaves us to contemplate how many World Series the Padres might be in 
before the Chargers make it to a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
You see, I am ready for the baseball season to start. Spring training is little 
more than a month away, assuming something as stupid as a strike or a lockout 
does not intervene. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Padre highlight film, which made its debut Thursday night, did not 
stir memories as much as it did hope. What it was was a look ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, if this was a look back, Mark Davis would have made his first 
appearance long before what must have been the last reel. (Then again, maybe it 
was appropriate that Davis should appear near the end, since that was his modus 
operandi through what was a Cy Young season.) 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Davis' contribution are acknowledged and then Davis is dismissed, as 
in sayonara Cy. 
</P>
<P>
Davis is gone, it seemed to be saying, but look at what's new pussycat . . . 
</P>
<P>
Joe Carter . . . and Craig Lefferts . . . and Fred Lynn. 
</P>
<P>
Correct me if I am wrong, but Carter may be the best player the Padres have 
ever obtained in a trade. This is an impact player. Put Tony Gwynn third, 
Carter fourth and Jack Clark fifth, and you have a lineup with snap, crackle 
and a whole lot of pop. 
</P>
<P>
When Jack McKeon was asked who would be playing where, he identified Benito 
Santiago as the catcher, Clark as the first baseman, Roberto Alomar as the 
second baseman, Garry Templeton as the shortstop, Gwynn as the right fielder, 
Carter as the center fielder and a very versatile "I don't know" at both third 
base and left field. 
</P>
<P>
These observations came in a question-and-answer period. The film itself did 
not deal with such specifics, only with how wonderful everyone will be. 
</P>
<P>
But one of the film's stars should be the answer to McKeon's "I don't know." 
Bip Roberts was identified in the film as a utility player. In his case, this 
should mean that he is available to play whatever position no one else seems to 
be able to take. 
</P>
<P>
You know, Roberts plays third base if Fred Lynn plays left field, and Roberts 
plays left field if Mike Pagliarulo plays third base. That's called 
utilitarian, if not utility. 
</P>
<P>
One "place" Roberts has to play is leadoff. The film reminds us that he hit 
.301 and scored 81 runs in only 117 games last year. He wasn't under-utilized, 
but rather discovered a little too late. 
</P>
<P>
Another reminder . . . Alomar ended up hitting .295, sixth in the National 
League. Suddenly, the batting order is looking awfully good in the first 
through fifth spots. 
</P>
<P>
That gets us, finally, to the very first face to pop onto the screen. 
</P>
<P>
Benito Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's the way of getting the message to everybody that this man is the 
Padre catcher. There's no more controversy, no more tug-a-war, over whether the 
Padres will deal Santiago or Sandy Alomar Jr. Goodby, Junior; Hello, Benny. 
</P>
<P>
When Santiago gets to Yuma, McKeon should sit him down and show him the film 
first thing. He will walk out of the room popping his buttons and maybe get 
through a whole season without whining or complaining. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did the film get me thinking the Padres are going to score a lot of 
runs, but it also left the impression that the other guys won't be scoring a 
lot of runs. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 staff, which returns virtually intact, may have gone unappreciated in 
the shadow of Mark Davis' 44 saves. After all, Ed Whitson and Bruce Hurst were 
fourth and fifth in the league in earned run average and had 31 victories 
between them. Eric Show was only around for 16 starts before he was injured, 
and Andy Benes was only around for 10 starts after being called up. Remember 
that Mark Grant was 8-2, and Greg Harris had a 2.60 earned run average. 
</P>
<P>
What we have here is a solid starting rotation and a committee with no 
chairman, unless maybe it's Lefferts, to come out of the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
However, one thing I did not see in the film were many highlights from early in 
the season. Indeed, there have been very few early-season highlights for the 
Padres for the last couple of years. It is as if they start spring training in 
February and finish it sometime in June, whereupon they commence playing 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
If the Padres' 1990 highlight film is going to be as good as the 1989 highlight 
film seems to suggest it will be, they might consider that games played in 
April and May do count. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, of course, we can entertain ourselves watching other cities' 
teams continue to play football. At least it will kill time until the real 
season is here . . . or the Chargers produce a highlight film longer than a 
station break.

'NINJA 3': BLAND LEADING THE BLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The karate genre is alive, if hardly kicking, in "American Ninja 3: Blood Hunt" 
(citywide). 
</P>
<P>
The silly fight scenes gave a few sound-effects experts a lot of work, even if 
the violent snaps, crackles and pops on the sound track don't precisely match 
the fights staged on screen. It's a cinch that the sound men still put far more 
care into their work than did writer-director Cedric Sundstrom, who has 
bothered neither with wit nor logic. 
</P>
<P>
All that the tedious "Ninja 3" has in common with with two earlier "Ninjas" is 
the likable presence of Steve James as the brawny black sidekick. The new white 
lead in this episode is the wooden but hunky David Bradley, playing Sean 
Davidson, a young man who mastered martial arts after seeing his karate-champ 
father gunned down at a tournament by robbers. 
</P>
<P>
Either the lead character or the screenwriter seems to have forgotten the 
father after the prologue, and thus, the hero never seems to recognize the 
baddies as the very same scum who orphaned him. Gifted with a poor memory and 
stripped of a revenge motive, Davidson mostly just worries about the bad guys' 
cache of homicidal germs as he demolishes craniums by the hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
Even flamboyant Marjoe Gortner, who has made a career out of being -- as Daffy 
Duck would say -- deth-spicable, is bland unto death here as the chief bad guy. 
For a movie with so many flying feet, "American Ninja 3" (MPAA-rated R) is 
amazingly short on kicks. 
</P>
<P>
'AMERICAN NINJA 3: BLOOD HUNT' 
</P>
<P>
A Cannon presentation. Producer Harry Alan Towers. Director/writer Cedric 
Sundstrom. Executive producer Avi Lerner. Editor Michael J. Duthie. Music

Chan, Calvin Jung. 
</P>
<P>
Running time: 1 hour, 29 minutes.

MICROWAVE: HOT CEREALS CAN HURRY MORNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA, Anderson and Hanna are nutritionists and 
cookbook authors specializing in microwave cookery. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because many hot cereals -- especially the instant varieties -- cook quickly on 
top of the stove, you may wonder if there is any reason to microwave them. 
</P>
<P>
The answer is yes. For starters, there's little danger of a cereal lumping or 
scorching in a microwave oven. Second, you needn't stir it nonstop or resort to 
the double boiler to keep it smooth and creamy. 
</P>
<P>
Best of all, you save messy pot-scrubbing because cereals can be microwaved 
right in their serving bowls. It's such a snap that the children may want to 
fix their own breakfasts before they dash off to school. 
</P>
<P>
Oatmeal, farina, cream of wheat, cream of rice, even the Southerner's choice, 
grits, are cooked much the same way in the microwave. The only variable is the 
ratio of cereal to liquid. For best results, however, follow these guidelines: 
</P>
<P>
 -- To prevent boil-overs, always use a bowl or casserole twice the volume of 
the ingredients that are placed in it. For each individual serving, use a deep 
1-pint bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To speed cooking, use hot tap water instead of cold. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cover the cereal, if you like. A cover keeps the cereal uniformly creamy 
(no surface drying) but also increases the risk of boil-overs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If, at the end of the suggested cooking time, a cereal tests -- and tastes 
-- done but seems soupy, microwave in 15-second increments (for one serving) 
and in one-minute increments (for four-servings) until the mixture thickens 
properly. If, on the other hand, the cereal cooks dry before it's done, add a 
little hot water and microwave as directed for thickening the mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Always use potholders. Cereal bowls and casseroles get blistering hot in a 
microwave oven. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Always let cooked cereals cool slightly before tasting lest you scald your 
tongue. 
</P>
<P>
BASIC MICROWAVED CEREAL 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup old-fashioned oats or 3 tablespoons grits or 2 tablespoons farina, 
cream of wheat or cream of rice 
</P>
<P>
2/3 cup hot water 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon salt, optional 
</P>
<P>
Combine cereal, water and salt in microwave-safe 1-pint bowl. Microwave 
(covered, if desired) on HIGH (100% power), stirring at half time, until all 
liquid is absorbed and cereal thickens. Allow 1 3/4 to 2 minutes for farina, 
cream of wheat or rice, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes for grits and 3 1/2 to 4 minutes for 
oats. 
</P>
<P>
Stir cereal again. Cool 30 seconds on heat-resistant surface. Makes 1 serving. 
</P>
<P>
Note: In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%. 
</P>
<P>
Variations: 
</P>
<P>
For 2 servings: Microwave single portions in 2 (1-pint) bowls, arranged 
side-by-side on microwave oven floor, 5 1/2 to 6 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
For 4 servings: Microwave single portions in 4 (1-pint) bowls, placing 1-inch 
apart and staggering 2 on oven shelf, 9 to 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 SOME QUICK WAYS TO IMPROVE COOKED CEREALS 
</P>
<P>
 Add any of following to each portion of cooked cereal (any kind), then cool 
briefly as recipe directs: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1 to 2 teaspoons light brown or maple sugar plus sprinkling of ground 
cinnamon, nutmeg, mace or allspice. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons seedless raisins, diced dates, prunes, dried figs, 
apples, peaches or apricots. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1 tablespoon honey and/or wheat germ. 
</P>
<P>
 OR, JUST BEFORE SERVING 
</P>
<P>
 Top oatmeal, farina, cream of wheat or cream of rice with jam, jelly or 
preserves, any sliced or diced fresh fruit or whole ripe berries. Dollop of 
sour cream adds finishing touch. 
</P>
<P>
 FOR GRITS ONLY 
</P>
<P>
 Cook grits in chicken or beef broth instead of water, then serve in place of 
potatoes.

   Even in good times it's hard for Southerners
to trash anything that comes from a hog, hence the presidential
snack, pork rinds.
   ``You don't throw nothing away,'' said Larry Pierce, manager of
the Nahunta Pork Center. ``You use everything from a hog but the
squeal.''
   ``It's the finest food substance available on the planet,'' said
state Sen. Wendell Murphy, a Duplin County hog farmer and one of the
largest pork producers in the nation.
   Hogs provide hams, pork chops, bacon and sausage. Their feet are
pickled, the intestines are used as casings for sausage, the tails
are used for seasoning and the hide ends up in fancy driving gloves,
Hush Puppy shoes and President George Bush's favorite munchie.
   Pierce, who produces pork rinds, thinks it's great that Bush
prefers them with Tabasco sauce. But if the president wants some of
Nahunta's home-style skins, he'll have to come to this crossroads 50
miles southeast of Raleigh to get them.
   ``It will probably be good for the pork industry, but there's not
much way for it to help our business,'' said Pierce, whose father
founded the company 24 years ago. ``We process 100 skins a week and
can't meet the demand from our customers as it is.''
   The pork company, which makes up most of Nahunta, started as a
slaughterhouse in 1955 and added retail pork sales in 1975. It does
not distribute its products, but more than 3,000 people a week come
by to pick out fresh pork and cured hams. They also grab up 99-cent
bags of Pierce's salted and deep-fried pork skins.
   ``We process about 500 hogs a week,'' Pierce said, ``but we're
real particular about the skins we use. If they aren't quite up to
snuff, we won't use them. That's why we only turn about 100 skins a
week into pork rinds.''
   A special machine slices the skin off of pork pieces. The skin
pieces are cooked for four hours in vats to dry out the fat. Then
the hard, shriveled skins are deep fried.
   The pieces of skin swell and pop, turning into puffy slabs of
rind in minutes.
   ``This is our scientific measuring process,'' Pierce said as he
dipped a handful of salt from a bucket and spread it over the fried
rinds.
   ``Ones that come out like this, we throw away,'' he said,
plucking a dark, hard chunk from among the beige sheets of fried
skin. ``And we've got two grades of rinds.
   ``The ones that come out really nice and thin are No. Ones,'' he
said. ``Your thicker skins that come out a little tougher are No.
Twos.''
   A bag of No. Ones, which weighs a little more than 3 ounces, and
a 12-ounce bag of No. Twos go for the same price _ 99 cents.
   ``We actually sell more of the No. Twos,'' Pierce said. ``People
seem to like to gnaw on them a little bit.''
   A half-ounce serving of pork rinds provides little in the way of
nutrition; potato chips and peanuts have more nutrients, but also
more fat and cholesterol.
   A U.S. Department of Agriculture analysis showed a two-ounce
package of rinds contains 315 calories; 32.5 grams of protein; 18.9
grams of fat; 58 milligrams of cholesterol; and 1,054 milligrams of
salt.
   The Snack Food Association said pork rind sales nationally
totaled $195 million in 1987, a figure dwarfed by potato chips,
which had $3.8 billion in sales the same year.
   Dwayne Pilkington, a professor of food science at North Carolina
State University, said the origin of pork rinds is lost in history.
   ``I don't know when people started popping skins or why,''
Pilkington said. ``I don't know if it's a takeoff from the old days
of crackling or what.''
   Crackling, or cracklin', is hog fat that has the lard squeezed
out of it and is then cooked. In some areas, the layer of fat was
ground up with the skin to make the crisp treat.
   ``It could be that somebody had a piece of skin left over from
cracklin', put it on a stove and it popped, sort of an accidental
discovery,'' Pilkington said.
   Pierce said he isn't sure why pork rinds have remained a regional
delicacy, limited mainly to the South.
   Murphy, who raises a million hogs a year, said other areas of the
country have just lagged behind the South in realizing how good pork
rinds are.
   ``Anybody that doesn't like them has just never tasted them,''
Murphy said. Murphy, a Democrat, said he was aware of the Republican
president's use of symbolism in the 1988 campaign, but he did not
believe Bush used pork rinds as a populist snack to fight a
less-than-macho image.
   ``I really think he ate them before the presidential campaign,''
Murphy said. ``But maybe nobody paid much attention to what he ate
when he wasn't the president. The office sure changes that.''
