<HEAD>Hanford 1949 Test Released More Radiation Than Expected, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A secret 1949 experiment at the Hanford
nuclear reservation released about twice as much radioactive gas as
scientists had predicted beforehand, according to a newly
declassified report.
   The report said the so-called Green Run experiment released
about 7,780 curies of radioactive iodine and about 20,000 curies of
xenon-133, a gas.
   By contrast, the 1979 Three Mile Island accident, the worst
commercial nuclear accident in the United States, emitted 15 to 24
curies of radioactive iodine into the Pennsylvania countryside.
   Scientists had estimated in 1949 that the test would release
about 4,000 curies of iodine and 7,900 curies of xenon. The
increased radiation measurements may have been caused by an
unstable weather inversion over the region, the report said.
   The Spokane Chronicle and Spokesman-Review, two of several
newspapers that requested the report's release, published details
of its contents in articles Wednesday and today.
   The Dec. 2, 1949 experiment, the only known non-accidental
release of radiation in Hanford's post-World War II history, spread
radiation in a 40-by 200-mile plume to Spokane and as far south as
Klamath Falls, Ore., near the California border.
   It's not known how much radiation residents actually were
exposed to, since the public was never notified and no follow-up
health studies were done.
   Scientists are now starting a study to see if Hanford emissions
in the 1940s and '50s, including the Green Run, have led to an
increase in thyroid disease in the area.
   Some details of the Green Run test were included in a Hanford
nuclear reservation environmental monitoring report that was among
19,000 pages of previously secret documents made public by the
Department of Energy in 1986. But a more detailed 120-page report
on other aspects of the experiment was not released until this
week. Some segments of the report were deleted for security
reasons, the government said.
   The Green Run experiment was apparently conducted to help
develop efforts to detect emerging military plutonium production in
the Soviet Union. The contamination exceeded the Atomic Energy
Commission's ``tolerance thresholds'' for iodine-131 on vegetation
by tens of thousands of times on the nuclear reservation and by
hundreds of times in nearby communities.

   The Soviet Union admitted for the first time Friday
that a tank of radioactive waste exploded at a nuclear weapons plant
nearly 32 years ago, showering particles over nearly 400 square
miles and forcing 10,000 people to evacuate.
   Before the Chernobyl power plant explosion on April 26, 1986,
Western specialists called the disaster in the southern Ural
Mountains the world's worst nuclear accident. A secret CIA file made
public in 1977 quoted Soviet sources as saying hundreds of people
were killed.
   The Western accounts said the explosion created a vast
radioactive wasteland one-third the land area of Rhode Island, or
about 400 square miles.
   Thirty rural villages vanished from Soviet maps, fishing was
banned in lakes, dams were built to contain radioactive waterways
and rivers were diverted with canals, according to the Western
accounts.
   But the official news agency Tass said Friday no casualities had
resulted. It quoted Boris Nikipelov, first deputy minister for
medium machine-building, as telling a news conference a ``chemical
explosion'' occurred in September 1957 near Kasli, about 870 miles
east of Moscow.
   A tank of radioactive waste exploded at a military plant where
atomic weapons were to be built, ``forming a radioactive trail 105
kilometers (65 miles) long and 8 to 9 kilometers (roughly five to 5{
miles) wide,'' said Nikipelov, whose ministry administers
military-related nuclear programs.
   Tass said 2 million curies of radioactive elements were released,
and ``more than 10,000 people were urgently evacuated from the
contaminated zone.'' In comparison, Tass noted that 50 million
curies of radiation were released in the Chernobyl explosion and
fire in which 31 people were killed.
   The 1979 accident at Three Mile Island power plant in
Pennsylvania released 14 curies, a measure of the amount of
radioactivty contained in a material.
   U.S. analysts have calculated that the Urals accident spewed out
more radiation than that produced by the U.S. atomic bombing of
Japan.
   The effects of the accident lasted for decades, Tass indicated.
It said economic activity resumed in the area only by 1978, and even
then only in 80 percent of the contaminated zone. The remaining
territory was turned into a reserve. Radiation returned to safe
levels in the area only by 1974, and lakes and other waterways
remain contaminated, Tass reported.
   Tass did not say when or where Nikipelov gave the news
conference, nor did it say which radioactive particles were released
or whether the atomic weapons plant is still operating.
   Some Western reports have said the accident happened at the
Soviet Union's first nuclear production facility, in Kyshtym, about
20 miles south of Kasli. The complex or a replacement is believed to
be still producing plutonium.
   Tass said the accident was kept secret so long in the Soviet
Union because it occurred at a military plant.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness,
has brought to light other disasters long hushed up. In April, a
Soviet magazine reported for the first time that an ICBM exploded in
1960, killing the chief of Soviet rocket forces and incinerating
many other people.
   Tass said disclosure about the 1957 accident ``poured oil onto
the fire'' of a debate about building an atomic power plant in the
southern Urals. Nikipelov defended the plant's construction,
claiming it would help purify water contaminated by radiation by
evaporating it.
   Since Chernobyl, Soviet public opinion has turned against
harnessing the atom for electricity. Several nuclear power projects
were canceled because of protests.
   The Urals accident was first disclosed in 1972, when Zhores
Medvedev, a Soviet biochmist now living in Britain, wrote that
hundreds of people probably died of radioactive poisoning after
nuclear wastes near the first Soviet atomic power plants exploded.
   Lev Tumerman, a physicist who emigrated to Israel, said in a 1976
interview that he visited the area in the early 1960s and found it
was ``empty land,'' almost like a lunar view.
   CIA documents say another nuclear accident, an explosion,
occurred at Kyshtym in 1960 or 1961.

   Disposal of eight old, closed reactors
that produced plutonium fuel for the nation's nuclear weapons could
cost $217 million and take more than 100 years, according to a
draft plan released Thursday.
   The pioneering reactors, some of which date back to the
Manhattan Project during World War II, are on the Hanford federal
nuclear reservation in south-central Washington and have been idled
for years.
   ``No future long-term use of any of the eight surplus production
reactors has been identified by the DOE,'' said the draft
environmental impact statement by the Department of Energy.
   They are the nation's first defense production reactors proposed
for permanent disposal, said Roger Freeberg, chief of Hanford
restoration for the DOE.
   Although the reactors' nuclear fuel has long been removed, they
are still contaminated with 98,100 curies of tritium, 37,400 curies
of carbon-14, 74,400 curies of cobalt-60 and other radioactive
materials that could threaten workers and the environment, the plan
said. A curie is a measure of radioactivity.
   That is why they must be decommissioned or placed in a condition
that ensures public safety and protects the environment, DOE said.
   Five disposal alternatives _ from burying the reactors to
leaving them intact _ were discussed in the report.
   The Energy Department will choose one of the five alternatives
by late 1990, Freeberg said. None of the disposal methods pose any
radiation threat to the public, the report said.
   The eight hulking reactors, built between 1943 and 1955, stand a
few miles apart along the Columbia River. They employed thousands
of workers making highly radioactive plutonium for the nation's
nuclear weapons.
   But from 1964 to 1971 they were shut down one by one as the need
for plutonium, which lasts thousands of years, diminished.
   Only one operable defense reactor, the N Reactor, remains at
Hanford and it is closed because of a plutonium surplus. The
nation's only other defense reactors are at the Savannah River
Plant in South Carolina.
   Among reactors slated for decommissioning is the B Reactor, the
world's first full-size nuclear reactor. It was built during a
crash 15-month period in 1943-1944 as the nation raced to develop
an atomic bomb before Nazi Germany. In fact, the Nazis were far
from developing nuclear weapons.
   The reactor sites should not be abandoned because maintenance is
needed to prevent the release of the remaining radioactivity, the
report said.
   Alternatives studied were:
   _Continue the present routine monitoring and maintenance. Over
100 years, this would cost $41 million in 1986 dollars, with
minimal radiation doses to workers.
   However, at the end of 100 years the reactors and some
radioactive contamination would remain, requiring additional work,
the report said.
   _Immediately move the 9,000 to 11,000-ton reactor vessels to a
Hanford burial site several miles away. This would take about 12
years for all eight reactors, cost about $191 million and be more
hazardous for workers.
   _Wait 75 years for radiation levels to subside before moving the
reactor vessels to the burial site. That would allow radioactive
cobalt 60, a significant threat to workers, to decay and reduce
worker exposure to radiation by an estimated two-thirds.
   This plan would cost $198 million and take 87 years before all
12 reactors would be buried.
   _Wait 75 years and then dismantle each reactor so the waste
could more easily be transported for burial. This plan is most
expensive at $217 million, and would take 103 years for all eight
reactors.
   Worker exposure is over 10 times greater than any other
alternative because workers would be inside the reactor vessel, the
report said.
   _Bury the 46-feet-tall reactor vessels under 16 feet of soil at
their present sites, after the surrounding buildings have been
removed.
   This plan would take five to six years to complete, at a total
cost of $181 million. Except for the proposal to maintain present
conditions, this is the safest alternative for workers.

<HEAD>Soviets Confirm Accident at Leningrad Nuclear Plant in 1975</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union confirmed Thursday
that a major accident occurred at a nuclear power plant in
Leningrad in 1975, Finnish officials said.
   The officials said the nuclear reactors in the Leningrad plant
were similar to those at Chernobyl and that the accident was
``possibly of grade 3 _ in other words, a serious accident.''
   Radioactivity spread over parts of northern Europe in April 1986
after the reactor exploded at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in the
Soviet republic of Ukraine. At least 31 people were killed as a
direct result of that nuclear accident, the worst in history.
   However, the Finnish Center for Radiation and Nuclear Safety
said no radiation from the 1975 accident was detected in Finland,
60 miles at the nearest point from the plant. It made no mention of
any casualties.
   The center said the accident occurred when ``the fuel channel of
the number one reactor unit at the Leningrad nuclear plant was
damaged on Nov. 30, 1975, when it was started up, and short-term
radioactive substances were released into the atmosphere.''
   The recorded message said the information came from Soviet
nuclear officials after inquiries Thursday by the Finnish center.
   The message said, according to Soviet authorities, the release
of radioactivity was far less than the 1.5 million curies reported
in earlier press accounts. The Soviets have said 50 million curies
of radiation were released in the Chernobyl accident.
   ``Officials saw no reason to take special measures in the
immediate vicinity of the power plant, and the reactor was back in
use two weeks after the incident,'' the message added.

   Greenpeace asked the Soviet Union on Monday to
seek world help to recover from the bottom of the Norwegian Sea,
one mile down, a wrecked submarine and its two nuclear reactors and
nuclear weapons.
   A technical report commissioned by the environmental
organization said the Soviet submarine on April 7 took ``a
significant amount of highly active and toxic radioactive
materials'' to the bottom, 5,296 feet beneath the surface.
   ``If the submarine is not recovered intact then it is, in our
opinion, inevitable that all of this material will disperse to the
marine environment,'' said the report by the independent nuclear
engineering consultants John Large and Associates Ltd. of London.
   Forty-two seamen were killed and 27 survived when the vessel,
armed with two nuclear torpedoes and reportedly fueled by uranium
235, caught fire and sank 120 miles southwest of Norway's Bear
Island.
   The report said the nuclear reactors may have contained up to 20
million curies of radioactivity and the reactor hull parts 1
million curies. Greenpeace said its figures are conservative
because they do not include the radioactivity of the reactors'
liquid metal coolant or the toxic plutonium of the torpedoes.
   The No. 4 reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, by
comparison, emitted an estimated 50 million curies of radiation
after it caught fire in the Soviet Union in April 1986.
   The report said much of the radioactive material aboard the Mike
Class submarine will continue to emit radiation and be harmful to
marine and human life for many tens of thousands of years.
   ``This vast quantity of radioactivity is mainly from highly
active materials which will remain highly toxic to organisms almost
indefinitely,'' said Greenpeace spokesman Damian Durrant.
   ``Inevitably, they will be released and a proportion absorbed
into the marine food chains, through fisheries and toward man. The
only question is when the reactors breach and this process begins.''
   Director Johan Baarli of the Norwegian National Institute of
Radiation Protection said in response to the report, ``There is no
reason to doubt that the sub's reactor is in its containment.
According to all information we have, there is no radiation
leakage.''
   The institute said last month that tests showed the submarine's
reactors and weapons have apparently withstood tremendous water
pressure. Water samples collected near the submarine showed no
radiation that could be attributed to it, the institute said.
   The Soviet news agency Tass quoted Deputy Prime Minister Igor
Belovsov last month as saying a decision on whether to raise the
submarine is months away.
   The report does not discuss the possible impact of leaked
radioactivity on the marine environment.
   ``This requires a further study dependent on the provision of
more information from the Soviet Union, as requested by Greenpeace
as well as the Norwegian government, but which neither have thus
far received,'' Greenpeace said.
   The report noted that when the United States tried to raise a
Soviet Golf Class nuclear submarine in 1974 the vessel broke in
half.
   It said recovery should not be regarded as a ``quick technical
fix for this or future nuclear submarine accidents'' and called for
elimination of all 544 military nuclear reactors from ships and
submarines worldwide.

<TEXT>
   When the nation rushed to build atomic
bombs during World War II and the Cold War, few thought the work
might eventually prove more dangerous to the U.S. citizens living
near the weapons factories.
   As the Hanford nuclear reservation produced much of the plutonium
for the nuclear arsenal, radioactive wastes escaped into the air
from smokestacks or were dumped into the adjacent Columbia River.
   ``In the early history of Hanford, there were exposures to the
public. Nobody argues with that,'' said Jim Ruttenber of the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control. Forty-five years after the first
emissions, the government is making its first attempt to learn if
they hurt people in Washington, Oregon and Idaho.
   The Department of Energy's Hanford Environmental Dose
Reconstruction Project is under way to estimate the possible
radiation doses residents might have received, and similar studies
are being done at the Nevada Test Site, the uranium processing plant
at Fernald, Ohio, and other sites. The CDC is about to launch a
study of thyroid disease rates, a $1.5 project that will focus on a
group of 300 people at greatest risk from exposure to radioactive
iodine.
   For the scientists, the issues include dose reconstruction,
environmental transport, source terms, uncertainty analyses and
other jargon.
   But for Hanford's ``downwinders,'' the issue is damaged lives.
   ``Myself and five other members of my family all have
hypothyroidism,'' said Judith Jurji, whose father and two uncles
were Hanford welders from 1949 to 1956. Ms. Jurji, 43, believes the
disease, which slows the body's metabolism and robs a person of
vigor, was caused by Hanford emissions.
   Only the branch of her family that moved to eastern Washington,
around Hanford, has any trace of thyroid disease, Ms. Jurji said.
   The downwinders are prohibited by law from suing the federal
government or its contractors, and even if they could sue it would
be extremely difficult to prove a long-term illness was caused by
radiation exposure 40 years ago, said Jim Thomas of the Hanford
Education Action League, a citizens watchdog group.
   The first step in trying to link health problems to emissions is
dose reconstruction, an elaborate attempt to estimate how much
radiation might have reached people, mostly during the 1940s. The
federal government has estimated over 435,000 curies of radioactive
material was released into the atmosphere over Hanford in 1945-1947.
Three Mile Island released just 15 to 24 curies.
   But dose reconstruction isn't concerned with individual illness.
The $15 million, 5-year DOE study will estimate possible radiation
doses to the public. That will be done by meticulous examination of
such things as milk production, because radioactive iodine-131
settled on grass eaten by cows; weather, because radioactive
material was scattered for hundreds of miles by wind; and outdoor
recreation patterns, because exposure is greatest outdoors.
   The study has been attacked as not credible by some downwinders
because it is being done by Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratory, a
major DOE contractor.
   Ms. Jurji said she is also dissatisfied by how long the work will
take, and what she perceives as the wrong attitude of the
scientists, who she said were too dispassionate at a recent
downwinder conference in Spokane.
   ``Not one person said one word of sympathy or indicated any sort
of compassion,'' she said. ``They were looking like the kind of
scientists who might have given us the problems in the first place.''
   The CDC study will try to determine if there are higher rates of
thyroid disease in the region, and whether that is caused by
iodine-131, which attacks the thyroid. But even that won't yield
conclusive answers in individual cases.
   ``There is no way of measuring or detecting how somebody got
cancer,'' Thomas said. ``A lot of health effects are separated from
the exposure by 20 to 40 years.''
   Delbert Barth of the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, a member of
an independent panel overseeing the dose reconstruction project,
said at a recent meeting that it is wrong to think the study will
produce a firm number for radiation exposure the public received.
   There will only be estimates, with wide margins of error,
scientists say.
   Hanford was built in south central Washington in 1943 during the
Manhattan Project. The world's first full-sized nuclear plant, B
Reactor, was erected in a frenzied 15 months, and produced plutonium
for the Nagasaki bomb. Seven other plutonium reactors built along
the Columbia in the 1940s and '50s, all are shut permanently. A
ninth reactor, the N Reactor, was built in 1963 and is closed
because of a plutonium surplus.
   The releases were revealed when the Energy Department released
19,000 pages of previously classified documents in 1986.
   Most of the early releases were deliberate, from normal nuclear
operations for the time. But one release, the 1949 ``Green Run,'' is
notorious because an unknown amount of radioactivity was released so
its path could be charted.
   The term ``Green Run'' refers to faster processing of irradiated
nuclear fuel into plutonium. It was processed after just 16 days of
cooling, instead of the normal 40. The exact mission of the research
is unknown, though scientists have said it was to aid in monitoring
nuclear production in the Soviet Union.
   No one knows exactly how much was released, although recent
estimates are about 8,000 curies, twice what experimenters
originally planned.
   Much of the ``Green Run'' report remains classified.
   ``The main answer we are still looking for is why the Green Run
was done, who authorized it and how could it happen in a democratic
society,'' Thomas said. He wonders why the public wasn't told to
take precautions _ like staying indoors and evacuating pregnant
women _ during the December 1949 experiment.
   The dose reconstruction project's initial report is due early
next year and will deal with 10 counties in eastern Washington and
northeastern Oregon, said John Till, head of the oversight panel. It
will cover 1944-49 releases into the air, and 1963-64 releases of
cooling water into the Columbia River.
   Radiation releases aren't a thing of the past at the
560-square-mile site. While off-site radiation is negligible, 50
million gallons of radioactive and hazardous waste from plutonium
processing is still dumped each day.

Scientists studying what the radiation exposure levels around the Hanford 
Nuclear Reservation were during the Cold War are trying to decide how to break 
the news of their preliminary findings to Northwest residents. 
</P>
<P>
The initial announcement of results from the first-ever study on the question 
is due in April, and the task of releasing the data is fraught with dangers of 
misinterpretation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're walking such a fine line," said Mary Lou Blazek, Hanford programs 
manager for the Oregon Energy Department in Salem and vice chairwoman of a 
panel of independent scientists overseeing the $15-million Energy Department 
multiphase study of radiation exposure from Hanford. 
</P>
<P>
The Hanford Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project, conducted by the 
government contractor Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories, was launched 
after the public learned for the first time in 1986 of massive radiation 
releases from Hanford. 
</P>
<P>
Blazek said the initial announcement may involve hypotheticals and stressed the 
information is subject to change as the study progresses. 
</P>
<P>
"We may say if you were 16, and you lived in Pasco in 1944-'46, and your food 
intake was this, then your dose could have been this," Blazek said. 
</P>
<P>
Blazek, who chairs the communications subcommittee of the oversight panel, said 
scientists may also try to explain what the health consequences of a certain 
dose could be. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult because of the science involved," she said. "It's difficult 
because there are so many variables involved. You have to make so many 
assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
"Say you have X millirems. That is equivalent to what? We can't even agree on 
that in our own panel." 
</P>
<P>
The government said in 1986 that more than 500,000 curies of iodine-131 were 
released between 1945 and 1956 from Hanford during accidents and planned 
experiments. An estimated 15 to 24 curies were released during the 1979 Three 
Mile Island nuclear accident. 
</P>
<P>
The studies under way are designed to estimate how much of the radiation people 
were exposed to in the 570-square-mile site along the Columbia River in 
south-central Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Hanford, an old complex of military reactors that is now focusing on cleaning 
up extensive environmental contamination, helped build the first atomic bomb 
exploded in New Mexico, as well as the weapon that fell on Nagasaki. 
</P>
<P>
Many Hanford "downwinders" claim the radiation releases have increased the 
cancer rate in the area. 
</P>
<P>
A controversial and limited state study found cancer mortality rates near 
Hanford are actually lower than the national average, although the federal 
Centers for Disease Control is preparing to conduct its own $5-million study of 
cancer rates in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The CDC has previously estimated that about 20,000 children may have drunk milk 
exposed to radioactive iodine from Hanford. 
</P>
<P>
The Hanford dose reconstruction project is planned in four phases and may 
continue through 1993. Results from the first phase will reflect its limited 
scope, Blazek said. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase focuses on 10 counties closest to Hanford: Washington's Adams, 
Benton, Walla Walla, Franklin, Klickitat, Yakima, Kittitas and Grant and 
Oregon's Umatilla and Morrow. 
</P>
<P>
No decision has been made on whether future phases will expand the study east 
and south into more of rural Washington and Oregon and into Idaho, or north to 
the region's population center around Spokane. 
</P>
<P>
The study's first phase will estimate exposure to iodine-131, although future 
phases could look at other isotopes. 
</P>
<P>
The initial phase will examine exposure from airborne radiation from 1944 to 
1947 and exposure through water from 1964 to 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Indian tribes were not extensively studied in the first phase, but in later 
phases eight Northwest tribes are expected to participate. Scientists are 
interested in radiation exposure to Indians because their diets and life styles 
differ from other populations. 
</P>
<P>
Although exposure levels have not been released, scientists have already come 
up with some potentially important conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
Milk drinkers in the Walla Walla area may have received more radiation than 
people closer to Hanford because of the milk distribution system in place at 
the time, and scientists think the same may apply in Pendleton, Ore. The milk 
was contaminated because cows ate radioactive feed. 
</P>
<P>
And potential radiation exposure from the Columbia River was probably low 
because of the huge river's diffusion capabilities, Blazek said. 
</P>
<P>
After the Energy Department declassified 19,000 pages of information about the 
radiation releases, Blazek said officials tried "sort of back of the envelope 
calculations" of potential radiation doses to people. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we're at an 8-by-11 sheet of paper. We're nowhere near the finished 
report," she said.

<HEAD>Watkins Acknowledges High Radiation Emissions from Atomic Weapons
Plant</HEAD>

   Energy Secretary James Watkins said Wednesday
a nuclear weapons plant in the Pacific Northwest released enough
radiation in the 1940s to pose a serious health hazard to nearby
residents.
   It was the first time the government has acknowledged that
radiation emissions from the Hanford Nuclear Reservation were high
enough to cause illnesses, incluuding cancer, in people living
nearby.
   Watkins, speaking in advance of a study on the Richland, Wash.,
plant to be released Thursday, said, ``The implications of the
report are serious.''
   Watkins said the report is expected to ``contain estimates of
potentially large doses'' of radiation from the Hanford plant from
1944 to 1947.
   ``When I say high I mean significantly high _ 3,000 rads,
thousands of rads,'' he said.
   A rad is a measure of radiation exposure to human tissue. The
Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires that facilities it licenses
limit yearly radiation exposure from airborne emissions to 15
thousandths of a rad.
   He said between 350,000 and 400,000 curies of radioactive
material was released in one episode in 1945. A curie is the amount
of radiation emitted in one second by 1,400 pounds of enriched
uranium.
   The study being released Thursday is the first part of a
five-year, $15 million study that is the first major research into
accidental and intentional release of massive amounts of radiation
that drifted from Hanford into ten nearby Washington and Oregon
counties.
   The report will cover emissions, but not the health effects of
the radiation, said Angela Beers, spokeswoman for the panel of 18
non-government scientists and experts that directed the review.
   But a parallel study under way at the Centers for Disease
Control will use the exposure estimates to try to document cases of
thyroid disease among Hanford area residents, she said.
   Watkins said at his press conference that the main source of
worrisome exposure was radioiodine, the same isotope that caused
radiation sickness in some residents who lived near the Soviet
Union's nuclear power plant at Chernobyl when radiation was
released in a 1986 accident.
   A number of people who lived across the Columbia River from
Hanford's nine reactors claimed the 1940s emissions caused cancer
and thyroid-related illnesses.
   ``I don't want you to think we do this today,'' Watkins said.
``We are not casual about this today. But we do have to go back and
look at what happened to people. We don't know who was at the right
spot at the wrong time ... We have to learn lessons out of this and
be sensitive to the human beings who were there at the time.''
   The Hanford Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project uses
computer models to estimate how much radiation escaped when
plutonium was produced at the 560-square-mile nuclear plant.
   Scientists will use the first-phase estimates to test and refine
computer models over the next two years, during the second phase,
said John Till, a South Carolina nuclear scientist and the panel's
chairman.
   Radioactive iodine was produced when spent reactor fuel rods
were chemicall dissolved to produce weapons-grade plutonium and
uranium. When it concentrates in the thyroid gland, iodine-131 can
cause cancer and other diseases.
   Judith Jurji, president of the Hanford Downwinders Coalition,
said she and five members of her family have hypothyroidism, which
causes sluggishness and puffiness. Her father and two uncles worked
at Hanford from 1949 to 1956.
   However, it would be very difficult to prove a long-term illness
was caused by exposure more than 40 years ago and law prohibits
lawsuits against the government, said Jim Thomas of the
Spokane-based Hanford Education Action League.
   Researchers studied air emissions from 1944 to 1947 and
contaminated cooling water emissions into the Columbia River from
1964 to 1967, in part because those were years of highest radiation
releases and the best documented, Ms. Beers said.
   Weapons-grade plutonium was produced at the plant from 1943
until 1988, but radiation emissions steadily decreased over the
last 30 years.
   The Energy Department is paying for the study but has no
supervisory authority.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] It has been a little over a month since it became 
clear that Russia resumed its dumping of radioactive waste into 
the Sea of Japan. At the London meeting, held until 12 November, 
of the nations that signed a treaty on the regulation of ocean 
dumping (the London Treaty), the decision was made to ban all 
dumping of radioactive waste into the ocean. Japan, as well, 
relinquished its option on the ocean dumping of low-level 
radioactive waste. There is also an indication that the problem 
of nuclear power plants discharging radioactive wastewater into 
the ocean will lead to unexpected consequences. Concerned 
parties worry that ``atomic energy development will be driven 
into a difficult position because of the waste problem.'' 
  When the revisions to the London Treaty were decided by an 
overwhelming majority, an official of the Science and Technology 
Agency (STA) disclosed the following: ``We cannot go against the 
trend toward banning all ocean dumping of radioactive waste. 
But, in a form that appears to yield to the pressure, hasn't 
Japan given the impression of having distorted the meaning of 
its government policies on nuclear energy?'' 
  ``Pressure'' means the suddenly loud calls in government 
circles saying that ``to make Russia stop the dumping, Japan 
should take the initiative and stop dumping waste into the 
ocean.'' 
  For fourteen years up until 1969 Japan was dumping 
medical-use radioactive isotopes and other such radioactive 
waste into the open sea, but since then has not been doing so. 
At the on-land radioactive waste processing facilities in Aomori 
Prefecture's Rokkasho-mura, a low-level radioactive waste burial 
center went into operation last year. The STA claims that burial 
space that will last for ``several decades to almost a century'' 
has been secured and that the provisions for on-land disposal 
are adequate. 
  Nevertheless, the possibility still remained for ocean 
dumping as an arrangement in case the use of nuclear energy 
becomes more vigorous in the future. Eventually, however, the 
Atomic Energy Commission (chaired by Science and Technology 
Director-General Eda) preceded the London Treaty meeting and 
decided on 2 December that ``ocean dumping is not an option.'' 
  Indeed, the Atomic Energy Commission is not completely 
letting go its attachment to ocean dumping, saying that ``if the 
situation changes significantly in the future, a change of 
government policy will also be considered.'' At least there is 
an air of welcoming the fact that conditions were attached: 
whether or not to continue the ban on the ocean dumping of 
low-level waste will be reconsidered every 25 years. 
  What sort of effect Japan's ``concession'' will have on 
Russia's dumping ban is another ticklish point. Russia, along 
with the U.K. and France, abstained from voting on revisions to 
the treaty. If the abstentionist countries lodge an objection 
before the treaty goes into effect, they will not be bound by 
the treaty. An ironic situation where Russia continues dumping 
while Japan bans it is likely to arise. 
  Japan's nuclear energy development is coming to a crucial 
turning point. Next spring, for example, the Monju FBR will 
achieve criticality. Under a coalition government that includes 
the strongly anti-nuclear Socialist Party of Japan, the 
quarelling between the pro-nuclear and anti-nuclear factions is 
approaching a delicate stage. Given that situation, there is a 
strong feeling among the pro-nuclear side that altering the 
basic government policy ``would amount to showing the 
anti-nuclear side our weakness.'' 
  That unease has materialized in an unexpected form. Once 
again radiation released from Japan's nuclear power plants was 
highlighted when Russia's Nuclear Power and Energy Minister 
Mihailof came to Japan and announced that ``Tokyo Electric 
Power's Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant releases about 10 
curies of radioactive tritium per year.'' 
  The total amount of radioactivity that Russia dumped into 
the 
Sea of Japan in October was 0.38 curies (the initial 
announcement was 1.08 curies). Mihailof daringly tried to 
emphasize the insignificance of the effects of his country's 
ocean dumping and seemed to be citing Japan's nuclear power 
plants as an example to support his case. His statement was 
conveyed to Korea where it caused an uproar that invited the 
passionate opposition of the Korean people. 
  Nuclear power plants evaporate and concentrate their cooling 
water and wash water, filter it to reduce the level of 
radioactivity, then release it into the ocean along with thermal 
effluent. In the case of tritium, Japanese power plants that 
release 100 curies or more per year are not unusual. 
  Nuclear power facilities release radioactivity in the 
gaseous 
form as well as in liquid form. The government and the electric 
power industry say that ``there is no problem when it comes to 
safety.'' Their true intent, however, is that if possible they 
would like the matter to be left alone. 
  Greenpeace, the international environmental protection group 
that was encouraged with this recent all-out ban on ocean 
dumping, takes the standpoint where it ``regards all 
radioactivity released into the environment from nuclear power 
facilities, including waste liquids, as a problem.'' Greenpeace 
Japan is also eager to ``aim at Monju's criticality and take up 
the issue of radioactivity discharged into the environment.'' 
  Science and Technology Director-General Eda's stance is to 
change the point of attack: ``The ocean dumping by Russia is a 
problem of another dimension compared to the release of 
radioactivity from nuclear power facilities.'' Nevertheless, 
there are more than a few concerned parties who take the 
radioactivity discharge problem as if it were a body blow and 
worry about how it will impact the future of atomic energy 
development.

Residents of the Pacific Northwest were exposed to large doses of radioactive 
iodine released at the Hanford, Wash., nuclear weapons plant during the 1940s, 
the Department of Energy acknowledged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The radiation exposure, which will be detailed today in a report to be released 
in Richland, Wash., by an independent panel of scientists, was sufficient to 
cause illness among people living in parts of Washington, Oregon and Idaho, the 
department said. 
</P>
<P>
While the government has previously confirmed the release of radioactive iodine 
from the plant, the statement Wednesday by Energy Secretary James D. Watkins is 
the first official acknowledgment that the radiation could have affected the 
health of people living in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins said he had conferred with John Till, a nuclear engineer leading the 
scientific study, and conceded that it will show "significantly high" doses of 
iodine were released from 1944 to 1947 at the site. "The implications of the 
report are serious," Watkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins said the total radioactivity released during a single episode at 
Hanford in 1945 was between 350,000 and 400,000 curies. A curie is the amount 
of radiation emitted in one second by 1,400 pounds of enriched uranium. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins said the scientific report would estimate that some residents had been 
exposed over this period to as much as 3,000 rads. A rad is a measure of 
radiation equal to what is absorbed in about a dozen chest X-rays. By 
comparison, nuclear plant workers are limited by the government to an annual 
radiation exposure of five rads. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins said it was unclear what the exact health effects of the releases were. 
"We don't know who was at the right spot at the wrong time," he said. "We're 
primarily interested, of course, in the infants," who are substantially more 
vulnerable than adults to such radiation. 
</P>
<P>
A separate study by the federal Centers for Disease Control is addressing the 
actual cases of illness that may have resulted. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating today's new disclosures about nuclear waste problems at the 
Hanford weapons complex, the department Wednesday shook up management of the 
sprawling plutonium production facility. It also announced it will sign an 
agreement today giving the Army Corps of Engineers a major role in the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins said Hanford's future will be devoted to waste management and 
environmental restoration rather than production of fuel for nuclear warheads. 
He added that its new director and three deputies will report directly to the 
chief of the multibillion-dollar cleanup of the department's contaminated 
weapons facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Hanford now has some 600,000 cubic yards of radioactive waste in storage, 
including 2,100 tons of spent fuel rods from plutonium production reactors and 
149 contaminated underground tanks that once held liquid wastes. So far, some 
1,100 sites on the 560-square-mile reservation have been identified as 
requiring remediation. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from Energy Department headquarters are now completing another 
seven-week assessment and will shortly be reporting details of the cleanup 
requirements, Watkins said. 
</P>
<P>
In the management shake-up announced Wednesday, Watkins chose John Wagoner, a 
veteran of both civilian and military nuclear power programs, to replace 
Michael Lawrence, who will leave the department at the end of July. 
</P>
<P>
While he praised Lawrence as a "wonderful person," Watkins acknowledged that he 
wanted a more aggressive management organization to tackle the cleanup, whose 
cost is still a subject of widely varying estimates. 
</P>
<P>
A former admiral in the nuclear Navy, Watkins said he was shocked when he took 
over the nation's nuclear weapons complex to find that it lagged far behind the 
civilian nuclear industry in dealing with waste problems. 
</P>
<P>
"When we start rattling the trees here, we get a lot more rotten apples down 
than we expected," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The memorandum of understanding to be signed with the Army Corps of Engineers 
will lay out national guidelines for the corps' participation in the cleanup of 
weapons installations across the country.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article, under the rubric: "Official </F>
Department": "Naval Press Center Statement"] 
  [Text] The Naval Press Center has been authorized to 
disseminate the following statement as a result of articles in 
the mass media on radioactive waste dumping problems: 
  The decision on radioactive waste dumping at sea from naval 
facilities was made at the end of the 1950's, based on the 
results of a series of scientific investigations and while 
considering the practices of the majority of "nuclear" countries 
that existed at that time. The organization of dumping wastes at 
sea stipulated the reduction to a minimum of the possible 
unfavorable impact of the wastes on the population as a whole 
and on the critical group of the population who reside in 
coastal areas. During the resolution of organized issues of 
waste dumping at sea, a policy was also conducted toward the 
reduction of the possible unfavorable impact of the wastes on 
the environment. Dumping standards had a significant hygienic 
reserve and took into account the accumulation of radionuclides 
by aquatic life and their entry into the human organism as food. 
Permissible concentrations of man-made radionuclides in seawater 
were adopted that were 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than 
permissible concentrations for drinking water. Based upon the 
results of a number of expeditionary studies of the radioactive 
situation in waste dump areas, the actual concentrations of 
radionuclides in seawater turned out to be lower than the 
permissible levels by 2-3 orders of magnitude. They also did not 
detect any radioactive contamination of aquatic life. 
  The practice of dumping wastes at sea was the only possible 
step that supports the vital activities of ships with nuclear 
power plants in view of the absence of effective processes for 
reprocessing radioactive wastes. France and Great Britain adhere 
to a similar practice for dealing with radioactive wastes until 
the present time. 
  Since 1991, the Navy has ceased dumping solid radioactive 
wastes at sea. The dumping of liquid wastes has been reduced to 
the lowest possible level. 
  Based upon the results of radiation-hygienic and 
radioecological research of solid and liquid radioactive waste 
dumping areas that have been conducted by the Navy and also by a 
number of scientific research institutions (RAN GEOKhI [Russian 
Academy of Sciences Institute of Geochemistry and Analytical 
Chemistry imeni V.I. Vernadskiy] and "Tayfun" NPO [Scientific 
Production Association]) during the period from 1967 to 1992, no 
cases were detected of dangerous radioactive contamination of 
the sea environment both directly in the dumping areas and also 
in the water areas adjacent to them. The levels of radioactive 
contamination of the seas of the North and the Far East do not 
indicate any dangerous increase of the content of radionuclides 
in seawater. Specifically, the concentrations of Strontium-90 in 
the surface waters of the Barents Sea, the Sea of Japan, and the 
Pacific Ocean (the coastal waters of Eastern Kamchatka) total 
1.6x10[.sup]-11[/] Ki/l [Curies per liter], 
1.0x10[.sup]-11[/] Curies per liter, and 
0.9x10[.sup]-11[/] Curies per liter, respectively, which is 
four times lower than the concentration of Strontium-90 in the 
surface waters of the Baltic Sea (4.4x10[.sup]-11[/] Curies 
per liter). 
  At the international conference of experts on the assessment 
of the existing and potential consequences of dumping 
radioactive wastes in Arctic waters that took place in Oslo in 
February 1993 in which the representatives of 12 countries and 
also IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] experts 
participated, based on the materials examined, they arrived at 
the conclusion that there is inadequate evidence of a dangerous 
impact of sources of radioactive contamination on the maritime 
environment of the Arctic Seas at the present time, except for 
the entry of radioactive wastes from Western European spent 
nuclear fuel reprocessing plants and global fallout of the 
products of nuclear detonations. 
  An expeditionary study of waste dumping areas in the Karsk 
Sea was conducted on the "Kovrayskiy" OIS [Experimental Research 
Ship] to assess the impact of radioactive wastes on the naval 
environment during the period from 16 August through 10 
September 1993. The expedition's work was conducted by experts 
of Russian Federation profile scientific-research institutes 
("Radiyevyy Institute" NPO and "Kurchatovskiy Institute" RNTs) 
and of a number of Russian Federation Ministry of Defense 
institutions. At the present time, the initial processing of 
samples is being conducted and an express-report has been 
prepared based upon the expedition's results. The amount of 
research accomplished permits us to arrive at the conclusion 
that the radioecological situation in the areas studied is 
without anomalies and can be characterized as normal. There have 
been no cases detected of radionuclides leaking into the 
environment from dumped containers. The yield of gamma radiation 
doses on the surface of the water area, on land surrounding the 
bays and on the ground does not exceed background levels and is 
4-12 microroentgens per hour. Concentrations of Cesium-137 in 
seawater do not exceed the sensitivity of instrument measurement 
methods (2x10[.sup]-12[/] Curies per liter). An international 
expedition that operated on the "Akademik Mstislav Keldysh" NIS 
[Scientific Research Ship] obtained similar results. Final data 
on the content of radionuclides in seawater, algae, ground and 
sea organisms will be reported after radiochemical and 
spectrometric research has been conducted in the laboratories of 
the institutes that participated in the expeditionary research. 
  Two international expeditions (Russian-Norwegian -- on the 
"Viktor Buynitskiy" NIS and on the Jigofs [Transliterated] 
project -- on the "Dmitriy Mendeleyev" NIS) are continuing the 
study of the radioecological situation in the Northern Seas. 
Expedition work will be concluded at the end of October 1993. 
The final results of the radioecological research can be 
obtained after processing, under laboratory conditions, of the 
samples of the environment that were taken and also after the 
comparison, summarization and analysis of the data obtained 
during the course of the study of maritime areas which will 
require a certain amount of time. 
  It seems to be advisable to note that this problem, being 
universal, can be resolved only at the state level within the 
framework of the realization of a purposeful Russian Federation 
State Program for dealing with radioactive wastes and spent 
nuclear materials and for writing them off and dumping them.

<HEAD>Nevada Nuclear Tests Safe, Congressional Study Says</HEAD>

   There is no evidence to show that underground
nuclear tests in Nevada jeopardize the health of nearby residents,
although radioactive materials have periodically been released by
the blasts, a congressional study concludes.
   The report by Congress' Office of Technology Assessment said
that since 1970 the underground tests have released about 54,000
curies of radiation, an amount the study said would give a resident
living near the test site all that time about the same exposure to
radiation as a single X-ray.
   The report, released this week, said there is no need to improve
radiation containment procedures in connection with the tests, but
it suggested that the government abandon its practice of keeping
such tests secret.
   ``The secrecy associated with the program is largely
ineffective,'' the report said, adding that public concern about
such tests could be reduced if citizens were told of the tests. For
the most part, word of the tests becomes publicly available anyway
because workers are evacuated from the test site and the
underground explosions are detected from seismic signals.
   The study had been requested by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who
said the findings demonstrate that ``no significant health risks
are likely to result'' from the underground tests at the Nevada
Test Site.
   More than a dozen nuclear weapons are detonated underground each
year at the Nevada site. The tests are used to develop new weapons
and assess the effects of nuclear explosions on military equipment.
   The congressional study said elaborate efforts are made to
prevent radiation from being released. The 54,000 curies released
from 126 tests since 1970 compares to more than 12 billion curies
of radiation that were released in tests prior to 1970, the report
said.
   The report noted concerns among some Nevada citizens over
whether some areas of the test site such as the Rainier Mesa are
strong enough to contain the underground radiation. Ground cracks
have been found on the mesa near where tests were conducted.
   But the OTA study said the cracks do not indicate a greater
possiblity of radiation leaks. It said tests on the mesa are
conducted deeper than similar tests at Yucca Flat and that drill
samples near the cracks show no weakening of rock strength because
the cracks do not extend down to the test region.

   Corrosion of the nuclear reactor aboard a
Soviet submarine that sank off Norway April 7 may eventually lead
to the release of huge amounts of radioactivity, the environmental
group Greenpeace said Tuesday.
   The group said a study done for it by John Large and Associates,
a nuclear engineering consulting firm in London, concluded that the
submarine may release up to 20 million curies of radioactivity if
the vessel is not recovered.
   That is equal to about one-third of the radiation released by
the April 1986 explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in
the Soviet Ukraine, Greenpeace said. Thirty-one people died in the
Chernobyl accident.
   The Soviet submarine caught fire and sank in 5,000 feet of water
off northern Norway. Soviet officials said 42 of the 69 sailors on
board were killed.
   Moscow said earlier this month that a decision on whether to
attempt to raise the sub will not be made for several months. It
said the vessel's two nuclear reactors were shut down before the
crew evacuated and that there was no danger of radiation leaks. But
Greenpeace took issue with that assertion.
   ``Even if the reactor containment structures weren't damaged by
the fire, the collision with the ocean floor or the deep water
pressure, the protective structure will erode before the reactors
are safe,'' said Steve Shallhorn, a Greenpeace representative.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Russia in Crisis: Navy admits dumping nuclear reactors at
sea

RUSSIA has admitted the Soviet navy sank nuclear submarines and radioactive
materials in its northern seas.
An official report seen by the Financial Times paints a chilling picture of
secret pollution which began in 1959. The report, drawing on KGB and
military documents declassified on the orders of President Boris Yeltsin,
was drawn up after a ship from Greenpeace, the environmentalist
organisation, was seized by the Russian navy for trying to measure the
radioactivity last October.
Between 1959 and 1992, 18 reactors from nuclear submarines were dumped at
sea after accidents or decommissioning, as well as a reactor from the
nuclear-powered ice-breaker Lenin which was simply put on to a barge and
sunk. Seven of the reactors, complete with their submarines and dangerous
nuclear fuel, were dumped into the northern Kara and Barents seas after
on-board accidents made them too dangerous to handle.
The report says that 2.3m curies of radioactive material - 50m curies was
released by the world's worst nuclear accident, at Chernobyl - was dumped
into the sea over this period. It specifies where and when the dumping was
carried out.
But Professor Alexei Yablokov, the presidential adviser who led the
commission which produced the report, said research was now needed to
determine the harm done to the environment and draw up steps to repair the
damage.
'We don't know the extent of the danger because there is no data on what
radioactivity seeped into the ecosystem. Maybe nothing terrible happened.
But maybe it did get into fish and will then go on to human beings.'
Mr Yeltsin has ordered the government to draw up a programme to deal with
the issue. He has also instructed Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister,
to circulate the report among the international community.
Greenpeace has urged the Group of Seven industrialised companies to consider
urgent assistance for Russia to deal with what it describes as the Russian
navy's 'deadly cold war legacy'.
Russian nuclear submarines are continuing to dump liquid radioactive waste
at sea for lack of on-shore storage and reprocessing facilities. Britain,
France and the US, the other countries to operating nuclear submarines, as a
rule return the waste back to land.
Despite signing in 1976 the London Convention banning disposal of highly
radioactive materials at sea the Soviet Union ignored the ban.

  [Text] Haiyan, 15 Dec -- The Qinshan nuclear power plant, 
China's first domestically designed and built nuclear power 
plant, which is located in Haiyan County, Zhejiang Province, has 
generated a total of 2.145 billion kWh of electricity since it 
joined the grid on 15 December 1991 up until 15 December 1993, 
and especially in the last year, it has produced 1.62 billion 
kWh, 207.7 percent over its planned annual output, and operating 
at a load factor of 64.46 percent, it is two years ahead of its 
planned operating capability. 
  Two years of safe and stable operations of this plant 
demonstrates that China is fully capable of self-development in 
nuclear power. The Qinshan Nuclear Power Corporation which runs 
the plant, has adhered a strict policy of "quality and safety 
first," and has been persistent in scientific management, and in 
multi-level training of its personnel. It fully completed every 
aspect of its debugging mission in two years, getting an 
excellent high rate of operational efficiency out of its 300MW 
units. The daily output of its units is now 7.2 million kWh, and 
the plant has entered full operational test stage. 
  The latest statistics from the environmental monitoring 
department shows that the radiation level from particles in 
waste water discharge is 0.015 Curies, less than the nationally 
specified limit (20 Curies) of one to one-thousand parts; 
chimney discharge of inert gases totalled 0.70 Curies, or just 
at the state-set limit (70,000 Curies) of one to 100,000 parts.

<TEXT>     Home to more than 3,000 people just five years ago, it is one of the
hundreds of villages in the western Soviet Union that was abandoned after
clouds of radioactive particles from the explosion at the Chernobyl Atomic
Energy Station passed overhead in 1986 and made the villages uninhabitable.;  
 "The young have all gone -- they understood that all this radiation would be
a living death," said Anatoly E. Popkov, 58, whose family is one of 17 still
living in Bartalomeyevka, about 100 miles north of Chernobyl. "We should
leave, too. There is still lots of radiation here, and it churns up your
stomach and makes your bones ache and just eats away at you.;    "But how can
you leave a place that has been your whole life and the life of your parents
and their parents and their parents before? Bartalomeyevka is where God put us
-- this is our place in the world. Where will we go?";     AS DESTRUCTIVE as
the original explosion was, the full consequences of the Chernobyl disaster
are only now becoming clear:;    (check) Hundreds of thousands of farmers from
Byelorussia, western Russia and the Ukraine have been resettled, or still must
be, from land so poisoned that it cannot be farmed for a generation or more.
Yet, the massive migration from villages that go back centuries threatens to
destroy the very societies it is intended to save.;    (check) As many as 4
million people from the region are thought by doctors to be in high-risk
groups susceptible not only to cancer but also to a range of severe illnesses,
already increasing, that includes heart and lung diseases, nervous disorders
and digestive tract ailments. For doctors, the sharp increase last year in
cancer of the thyroid gland among children and adolescents is a portent of the
human suffering still to come.;    (check) The exploded reactor at the
Chernobyl Atomic Energy Station in the northern Ukraine remains a serious
threat. Although stabilized at tremendous cost in 1986 and encased in a
concrete sarcophagus, the reactor is still highly radioactive and far from
leakproof, and a fierce dispute is raging over what to do about it.;   
(check) The cleanup, resettlement and health care that will be required now
seem beyond the capability of the crisis-ridden Soviet Union and its
Byelorussian, Ukrainian and Russian republics. At the same time, there is
widespread distrust of all government, a feeling that it will abandon
Chernobyl's victims to their fate.;    "A sense of doom is settling on our
people that, if we accept it, could condemn our nation to extinction," said
Natalya P. Masherova, president of the Byelorussian Znich Union, named for the
holy fire with which ancient Byelorussians sought to ward off evil spirits and
which was formed to aid Chernobyl victims.;    "People ask, 'What have we done
for God to punish us this way?' And it does seem a punishment. Every fourth
Byelorussian was killed in World War II, and now every fifth Byelorussian --
2.2 million people -- was in the Chernobyl radiation zone. It is a real
question: 'How will we survive?' ";     UNDER THE CENTRAL government's
resettlement program, more than 163,000 people have been evacuated from
territory where radioactivity measures more than 40 curies per square
kilometer, and 73,000 more remain to be moved this year. But Byelorussia,
Russia and the Ukraine, setting stricter limits than Moscow, want to resettle
people living in areas that received 15 curies or more. Altogether, officials
estimate that more than half a million people will be moved eventually.;   
"The scope and the degree of the radioactivity was seriously underestimated
from the beginning," said Professor Dmitri M. Grodzinsky, a biologist and
member of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences.;    "It was thought the main
danger was from cesium 137, that the strontium 90 fallout had been contained
within 30 kilometers of the reactor, the plutonium within 10. But now we are
turning up plutonium and strontium right here in Kiev (the Ukrainian capital,
about 80 miles south of Chernobyl).;    "This means that many more people than
we believed were subjected to greater doses initially and to continued
radiation. It means that they are at far greater health risk than we thought.
It means that the cleanup will take more work and more time than we expected.
It means, in short, that the long-term consequences of Chernobyl can only be
assessed now.";    And the radioactivity is spreading, scientists working with
the environmentalist groups Green World and Chernobyl Union report. Previously
clean areas are being contaminated slowly by radioactivity carried by dust,
water and weeds.;    "Of the 2.2 million of our people who were in the fallout
area, 400,000 were children. We are very, very concerned for them," Dr. Arkady
K. Tomashev, Byelorussia's deputy health minister, said. "Of those children we
have monitored, 14 percent suffered very heavy doses of radiation. Overall, 40
percent to 45 percent of the children we are monitoring have enlarged thyroids
now. Understand, we are talking about thousands and thousands of our
children.";    Estimates of Chernobyl's eventual number of victims vary
widely. Even now, Soviet officials continue to maintain that only 32 deaths
can be attributed to the disaster, while environmentalists put the number as
high as 10,000.  </TEXT>

<P>
Rosalynd Pflaum's "Grand Obsession: Marie Curie and Her World" is a series of 
overlapping biographies of Marie and Pierre Curie, their daughter, Irene, and 
her husband, Frederic Joliot-Curie. All Nobel Laureates, they dominated the 
field of radioactivity in France during the first half of this century. 
</P>
<P>
Feminists will be disappointed. Despite the lip-service Pflaum pays to the 
slights and institutional obstacles that being female visited upon the distaff 
Curies, she writes about scientists who happened to be women, rather than women 
scientists. Moreover, she describes both Marie and Irene Curie in the contexts 
of their marriages. She does not even elaborate on the matter of nomenclature 
-- the apparently painless transformation of Manya Sklodowska, a fervent Polish 
nationalist -- to Marie Curie when she married the French chemist. In contrast, 
a generation later, Frederic Joliot, enamored of his wife's lineage, went the 
extra mile to hyphenate her name with his, becoming Joliot-Curie. 
</P>
<P>
Pflaum has set herself a difficult task in this thoroughly researched book. She 
presents four separate biographies, explains the lives of her subjects in the 
context of the science as well as the social history of their times, and 
addresses earlier biographers and critics in an effort to set the record 
straight. The result is uneven, a book rich in detail, scientifically literate 
but occasionally naive. 
</P>
<P>
Pflaum focuses on issues that dominated contemporary headlines, including the 
alleged affair between Marie Curie and her colleague Paul Langevin in 1911 and, 
a generation later, on the turmoil over Frederic Joliot-Curie's activities 
during the German occupation (when he had the opportunity to escape France and 
refused to leave). Pflaum reflects on these issues, recapitulates the old 
gossip as well as the evidence, but sheds little new light. 
</P>
<P>
She is at her best in her cameo portrait of Dr. Eugene Curie, Pierre's 
free-thinking father, who lived with them and who remained, after Pierre's 
horrific death beneath the wheels of a wagon on the rue Dauphine, to care for 
their small daughters. Later, Pflaum presents a vivid picture of the World War 
I front to which Marie, with her then-teen-aged daughter Irene at her side, had 
lugged her X-ray machine to help treat the wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Pflaum follows the early years of nuclear research in the makeshift laboratory 
where Marie single-mindedly and patiently separated a few grams of radium out 
of the literally tons of pitchblende she had had dumped in the yard outside. 
Never, it seems, did the Curies seriously question the wisdom of working with 
radioactive materials, not even after each of them in turn showed symptoms of 
extreme fatigue and unhealing sores that signal disease. 
</P>
<P>
The Curies believed that the discovery of radioactivity would enhance human 
life, and in its early years, X-rays did seem only a boon to medicine; 
radiation therapy had not yet revealed a dark side. A generation later, with 
the explosions over Japan, Frederic and Irene Joliot-Curie felt betrayed by 
their American colleagues. To them, science was unequivocally a force for good, 
and they did not seem to comprehend how their work could be interpreted as an 
evil genie released to wreak universal havoc. 
</P>
<P>
Pflaum captures the international spirit of science in a world before people 
needed passports to travel and Nobel Prizes, still new, were accepted in the 
spirit of pacifism. The Curies, not alone, believed in "pure" science. Their 
ambitions took the form of a desire for recognition, for professorships, 
appointments, and financial subvention of their research. But they did not seek 
patents or the creation of personal fortunes. Even their Nobel money, never 
inconsequential, was spent on their work, or on domestic assistance so that 
they could work even harder. 
</P>
<P>
Pflaum projects mixed feelings about her subjects. In one paragraph, she 
admires Marie: "An amazing, brilliant woman, whose doggedness and stubbornness 
had overcome immense hardships." Then she adds, gratuitously, "But she was 
never the genius Pierre was." 
</P>
<P>
Brilliant but not a genius? How does one measure the difference? Perhaps Pflaum 
is registering distaste for the woman she portrays as monomaniacal and 
humorless, whose children were saved from neglect only by their good fortune in 
having a benevolent grandfather. Yet both daughters seem to have matured into 
productive women with deep affection for their mother. 
</P>
<P>
Biographers do not have to like their subjects, but Pflaum wavers between 
making judgments and making excuses for hers. Discussing the Langevin affair, 
she feels obliged to remind the reader that Marie was only 39 when she was 
widowed, and had a healthy interest in men. When documenting Marie's arranging 
for Irene to get a position at the Curie Institute, Pflaum dismisses the 
irregularity, writing that "Scientists are not saints." Few of us think they 
are. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Frederic's actions during the Nazi occupation when he worked with 
German scientists in his laboratory by day and, a Communist, fought with the 
Resistance by night, she asserts, "But those who never lived in an occupied 
country cannot, especially in retrospect, pass judgment on those who have." 
This is a peculiar statement on two accounts: She does not make any sort of 
case for Joliot-Curie's culpability, and if there was one, surely historians as 
well as all people of good will have the right, and perhaps the obligation, to 
judge human behavior in difficult times. 
</P>
<P>
With the Curies now gone, it is a good time to review the special role they 
played in the creation of a nuclear-shadowed world. Pflaum presents a generous 
portrait that they probably would have accepted as fair. 
</P>
<P>
I suspect that they would have objected, however, to the jacket copy, which 
says that the family won three Nobel Prizes in two generations. The number is 
five. Individuals who share the award do not receive half a prize, even when 
they happen to be married to each other.

<F P=106> [Article by VLADIVOSTOK correspondent Sergey Bulakh: </F>
"Ecological Catastrophe in Bolshoy Kamen Is Perhaps Two Months 
Away"] 
  [Text] As we have already reported, the commission headed 
by Yevgeniy Stomatyuk, chairman of the kray administration 
committee for natural resources, worked in Bolshoy Kamen on 
Wednesday with a group of journalists. It visited the Vostok and 
Zvezda plants, where nuclear submarines are dismantled and 
radioactive waste stored. 
  As a result of eight hours of work at the city and plant 
administration offices and an examination of the facilities 
where liquid radioactive waste is kept, the commission prepared 
a protocol which states unequivocally that the situation in 
Bolshoy Kamen is fast approaching critical. The main conclusion: 
"We should expect an emergency situation involving TNT-5 to 
develop in April-May." 
  The liquid radioactive waste problem is increasingly often 
associated with the Far Eastern plant Zvezda. According to the 
commission's estimate, about 2,253 cubic meters of it is kept 
here, with total radioactivity exceeding 30 curies. It is all 
kept in seven tankers, which are moored at the plant's piers. 
Two tankers -- TNT-5 and TNT-27 -- acquired notoriety around the 
world after the liquid radioactive waste dumping in October of 
last year, and the third--TNT Pinega -- is just beginning 
service in this capacity. 
  TNT-5 is currently in the most critical situation. The 
vessel, built at the beginning of the 1960's and decommissioned 
two years ago, now represents the main danger. Its tanks hold 
794 cubic meters of liquid radioactive waste with a total 
radioactivity of 0.776 curies. Over the past three months the 
radiation level in the stern and engine compartments increased 
threefold and now measures 1,400 microroentgen an hour. Because 
of malfunctioning systems and equipment, up to 10 cubic meters 
spilled from the tanks into the vessel's body over this time. 
Analysis of radionuclides in the tankers and samples of soil at 
the pier under the mooring area show that radioactive waste may 
leak not only into the tanker's body but also into the bay's 
aquatic area. 
  The opinion of the commission, which consisted of 
representatives of various agencies, as well as those of Bolshoy 
Kamen, the plant, and the Pacific Fleet administrations, is 
unanimous: Tanker TNT-5 has to be urgently hauled outside 
Bolshoy Kamen bay and the content of its tanks dumped. 
  These and many other conclusions may remain on paper, 
however. 
  "The problem is that radioactive waste is stored on the 
territory of the Zvezda plant, but does not belong to it," the 
enterprise's chief engineer Yuriy Shulgan said at the meeting 
with the commission. "The owner is the Pacific Fleet." 
  "After the Government of Russia banned liquid radioactive 
waste dumping, the fleet also has been unable to resolve this 
problem," emphasized the Pacific Fleet deputy commander, Rear 
Admiral Nikolay Lysenko. 
  The facility for storage and processing of radioactive 
waste, 
including liquid, which existed in the 1960's at the Sysoyev 
Cape was closed down temporarily by the Pacific Fleet more than 
20 years ago; in the opinion of specialists, it is unlikely that 
this facility could be restored. 
  Construction of a new facility, regardless of which design 
and whose money was used, cannot be accomplished in less than 
six to nine months. Meanwhile, the tanker, despite the fleet's 
energetic efforts to keep it afloat, may, if not sink, at least 
begin seriously leaking radioactive waste. 
  "Right now we are only talking about the waste stored in the 
tanker, but this is only part of the problem," emphasized 
Dmitriy Gichev, deputy chief of the Vladivostok consolidated 
inspectorate for nuclear and radioactive safety. "Over 30 years 
of active exploitation, the TNT itself has become a source of 
radioactive contamination. Even if we pump the contents out of 
it, there remains the equally serious problem of dismantling the 
tanker itself." 
  The commission's protocol is as alarming as it is hopeless. 
Maritime Kray is unable to solve a problem whose roots are in 
Moscow. Neither the plants, nor the fleet, nor the 
administration received any reply to their numerous appeals to 
Moscow. Just as there is no federal financing for the program of 
improving radiation safety drafted by the Government of Russia 
in August last year. The issue of building a radioactive waste 
processing facility in Maritime Kray was to be resolved under 
the provisions of this program. 
  Moreover, from the faraway offices of the Moscow military 
brass an order arrived at the fleet to prohibit access to 
military facilities to anyone whatsoever. Therefore, the kray 
commission had to go to Moscow to obtain permission to examine 
the decommissioned TNT-5. Journalists were not permitted on 
board this "classified military facility" (which, I repeat, was 
decommissioned from the Pacific Fleet two years ago). 
  Compared to other enterprises (the Urals Mayak plant, for 
instance, is in need of reprocessing liquid radioactive waste 
with a radioactivity level of 500 million curies), Bolshoy 
Kamen's 30 curies may look like a drop in the bucket, but it is 
our ocean, as it is our land on which we live and the products 
of which we consume. Why should we all remain hostages to a 
government that is trying to maintain a good image in the eyes 
of the world at the expense of our health and safety? 
  By the way, in the opinion of specialists, if a catastrophe 
with TNT-5 does occur in Bolshoy Kamen, because of the 
specificity of underwater currents the main victim will be 
Vladvostok. Specialists already note a higher radioactivity of 
bottom-layer sediment in Shamora and Tavaiza bays as a result of 
work with nuclear submarines at the Zvezda plant. 
  So far the situation in Bolshoy Kamen is relatively calm. 
The 
plants were promised a 200,000 ruble advance for February, 
provided there is enough cash. Another nuclear submarine has 
arrived for repairs. On the one hand, it is work for thousands 
of people; on the other, new cubic meters of radioactive water, 
which may become the last drop that will cause the cup of 
radioactive equilibrium to overflow -- and then we will have an 
ecological catastrophe. The bureaucrats in Moscow refuse to see 
this, however.

<HEAD>Radioactive Pellet Found in Cross-Country Shipment, NRC
Investigates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials spent Saturday laboriously trying to
track down truck drivers, warehouse workers and others who may have
been exposed to an intensely radioactive pellet buried within a
transcontinental cargo shipment.
   The radioactive pellet _ the size of a pencil eraser _ was
discovered Thursday lying loose in a shipment of what were supposed
to have been empty containers trucked to Massachusetts. The pellet,
called a source, is used for making X-ray-type pictures of welds,
structural steel and other industrial objects.
   Technicians at the shipment's last stop, Amersham Inc. of
Burlington, discovered the pellet when they detected radioactivity
coming from the shipment of containers used to carry sources. The
container that the source was found in lacked a shielding device
that would have prevented the radiation from leaking out.
   ``It's safe to say that this is extraordinarily rare,'' said
Karl Abraham, a Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman. ``There
should be concern but certainly not panic until we have a chance to
contact all the individuals who have had exposure.''
   Abraham said it would take several days to determine how many
people may have received radiation during the shipment's transit
from South Korea to Los Angeles, where it was stored for a month
before being trucked cross-country to Amersham, which manufactures
equipment used to test industrial structures.
   ``It appears to be an old source, a decayed source,'' Abraham
said of the pellet. New pellets radiate at a level of 60 to 75
curies; radiation from the one that was found was at levels from 3
to 7 curies, he said.
   Initial measurements taken 4 to 6 inches away form the pellet
found the level of radiation to be 150 rems per hour _ millions of
times higher than that people normally are exposed to from the
environment and X-rays. A rem is a measure of the estimated damage
done to living tissue by radiation.
   People generally receive about one-tenth of a rem, or 100
millirem, of radiation annually from natural sources; the average
American is exposed to an annual dose of 77 millirem from medical
X-rays.
   Abraham said investigators would better be able to determine the
radiation field after reconstructing the way in which the cargo was
stored.
   ``Then we have to determine the relation of that to where the
driver was sitting, where the people in the warehouse were and how
long these people were near the source,'' he said. ``It's going to
be a laborious process that will take many days.''
   The NRC has enlisted the help of state officials in
Massachusetts, California, Pennsylvania and Maryland in their
efforts to reconstruct the radioactive shipment's path. The Sate
Department has also contacted the South Korean government, he said.
   Abraham said it wasn't immediately clear how or at what point
the radioactive pellet slipped into the cargo, but ``the shipment
supposedly came in sealed up under bond like most things do when
they go from one continent to another.''

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- Hwang Sang-chun, 
chairman of the State Environmental Commission of the DPRK, 
strongly urged the South Korean authorities to immediately stop 
nuclear waste dumping in the sea and take emergency measures to 
prevent nuclear leakage. 
  Speaking at a press conference here today, he told home and 
foreign reporters that the South Korean authorities dumped 
29,513 curies of liquid waste, 84,737 curies of gas waste and 
29,034 drums of solid waste in seven years from 1986 to 1992. 
  He ascribed their dumping of a large amount of nuclear waste 
in the sea to their anti-popular policy, the backwardness of the 
technological levels of atomic energy facilities and, 
especially, their clandestine promotion of nuclear arms 
development. 
  According to him, the authorities in South Korea have paid 
no 
heed to the health and lives of the population and environmental 
protection in constructing and running nuclear power stations, 
and failed to regularly check, repair and readjust machinery, 
while immersing themselves only in power production for 
money-making. Subsequently, there have been not infrequent 
leakages of radioactive substances due to breakdown, damages, 
etc. 
  It is no secret that the "Taedok research complex" in South 
Korea, has nuclear reprocessing facilities now operated under 
the name of "a research reactor". 
  The spent nuclear fuel from the reactors in South Korea is 
turned into plutonium through reprocessing facilities now 
concealed at the "Taedok research complex" and used to develop 
nuclear weapons. 
  He condemned dumping of nuclear waste into the sea by the 
South Korean puppets as a wanton violation of international 
accords, barbarism and anti-national, anti-human crimes to 
exterminate the nation and mankind. 
  He sternly warned that if the South Korean puppets continue 
dumping nuclear waste into the sea and accelerating the 
development of nuclear weapons, they will have to bear 
responsibility for the consequences arising therefrom and face 
strong denunciation at home and abroad. 
  Chairman Hwang Sang-chun and Yi Hak-sun, an expert of 
nuclear 
safety and radioactive protection, answered questions put by 
reporters. Exposing the scheme of the South Korean puppet 
clique to build a nuclear power plants in Kosong, South Korean 
Kangwon Province, they said that if the power plant is built at 
the place less than 10 kilometres from the Military Demarcation 
Line, nuclear polution will directly affect the northern half of 
the country.

<F P=106> [Answer to reader's question from Vitaliy Lystsov, deputy </F>
chief of the Russian Federation Ministry for the Protection of 
the Environment and Natural Resources Main Administration for 
Ecological Safety, under the "Question-Answer. We Inform, We 
Advise, We Consult" rubric: "`Spots' on Map"] 
  [Text] Your newspaper has repeatedly written about 
radioactive contamination of Russian oblasts. Can they not be 
listed? (D. Chvilev, city of Vidnoye, Moscow Oblast). 
  Vitaliy Lystsov, deputy chief of the Russian Federation 
Ministry for the Protection of the Environment and Natural 
Resources Main Administration for Ecological Safety, replies: 
  "They are Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Kaluga, Kursk, 
Lipetsk, Leningrad, Nizhniy Novgorod, Orel, Penza, Ryazan, 
Saratov, Smolensk, Tambov, Tula, Ulyanovsk, and Chelyabinsk 
Oblasts and the Republic of Mordovia. Eighteen territories in 
all. But it must be said that the danger to people's health 
compared with other sources of risk (smoking, for example) is 
not high here. In the main the level of contamination does not 
exceed 1 curie per square km. Certain parts of Bryansk Oblast 
(310 square km) with contamination of over 40 curies per square 
km are an exception. A total of 17 percent of this oblast's 
territory is contaminated. The most contaminated territory is 
in Tula (39.7 percent), Orel (37 percent), Ryazan (13 percent), 
and Kaluga (11.7 percent) Oblasts, but the contamination there 
is not great (mainly between 1 and 5 curies per square km). 
Admittedly, in Tula, Kaluga, and Orel Oblasts there are `spots' 
where contamination is between 5 and 15 curies per square km."

<P>
The 10 days from April 26 to May 6, 1986, have become known in Soviet 
literature as the "Battle of Chernobyl." There were no direct reports from 
Chernobyl in those 10 days. At that stage, the people directly or indirectly 
responsible for the accident controlled the emergency measures. They had 
nothing to gain and a great deal to lose from glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to cover up inconvenient information and a tendency to shift 
responsibility were immediately apparent. They became even stronger later, 
particularly during and after the trial in July, 1987, of the director of the 
Chernobyl station and his deputies and engineering team. The proceedings of the 
trial were kept secret -- not because classified technical information was 
divulged, but because they were too embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the accident helped in the initial effort to cover it up. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the accident took place at night had one obvious advantage: There 
were few people in the immediate vicinity. The first concentrated cloud of 
radioactive debris, aerosol and gases that formed over the reactor passed over 
parts of the town of Pripyat, Yanov station and villages nearby. But most 
people were asleep indoors, protected from the radiation to some extent by the 
walls of their houses. Moreover, the night shift in the station was smaller 
than the day shifts. During the day shifts, for example, more than 2,000 
workers normally worked on the construction sites at Units 5 and 6 at 
Chernobyl. There were far fewer people around at 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
It is now known that the explosion that destroyed the reactor core in the early 
hours of April 26, 1986, blew nearly 20 million curies of radioactive materials 
and several million curies of the inert radioactive gases xenon-133 and 
krypton-85 into the atmosphere. Although the reports of the trial do not 
disclose the actual level of radiation, it was alleged that one local official 
"deliberately reduced the levels of radioactivity by several orders of 
magnitude" when he reported the situation to his superiors. 
</P>
<P>
This attempt to lay the blame for the initial cover-up on the local 
administrators -- who, it is implied, thereby made it difficult for Moscow 
officials to assess the disaster immediately -- is misleading. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial of station officials in July, 1987, it was reported 
that,"(Chernobyl station director Viktor) Bryukhanov and the former shift 
foreman, Boris Rogozhkin, were responsible for not taking the measures 
envisaged in the evacuation plan. Moreover, almost the entire shift that came 
to work at 8 a.m. remained unnecessarily at the station. 
</P>
<P>
"The population of Pripyat was not warned about the accident, nor were the 
civil-defense headquarters informed. Since the civil-defense staff had no 
information about the situation, they took no measures. As a result, the usual 
rhythm of life on a Saturday proceeded . . . . The evacuation began only 36 
hours later and was conducted according to a newly worked-out plan." 
</P>
<P>
But it is not fair to only blame local officials. One account of the accident 
makes it clear that officials in Moscow did not understand they were dealing 
with a catastrophe of global dimensions. There are signs, too, of an initial 
attempt to hide what had happened. The decision-making process seems to have 
been deliberately slow to preserve a facade of "business as usual." The 
chairman of the commission formed to handle the situation was allowed, for 
example, to complete a routine, rather unimportant meeting. It was probably 
hoped that if there were no sign of crisis, rumors of the accident could be 
prevented. 
</P>
<P>
Another indication that Moscow did not comprehend the seriousness of the 
accident was the low status of the commission first set up to handle the 
accident. Normally, when an industrial or natural disaster is considered to be 
nationally or internationally important, an energy commission is set up under a 
member or candidate member of the Politburo. Few people, even in the Soviet 
Union, knew commission chair Boris Shcherbina, one of more than a dozen deputy 
prime ministers. When it became clear a few days later that the Shcherbina 
commission lacked the necessary power to deal with the accident, a parallel, 
superior commission was set up under Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, a member of the 
Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the situation deteriorated hourly. Throughout the night of April 26, 
the level of radioactivity in the air continued to increase. Gen. Vladmir 
Pikalov, the commander of chemical services for the Soviet Army who was 
dispatched to the scene, decided to inspect the destroyed reactor. As Pikalov 
and his driver drew closer to the reactor building, they noticed the air above 
the ruins was fluorescent. There were no flames, just the eerie light. 
</P>
<P>
Pikalov understood the cause, but did not know how to deal with it. He decided 
to try something desperate. He took a special armored car equipped for 
radiological reconnaissance and drove to the plant. The gates were closed. 
Dismissing his driver, Pikalov took the wheel himself and smashed through the 
gates. He stopped near the destroyed building to take measurements. It was only 
then, more than 20 hours after the original explosion, that it was definitely 
established that the graphite of the reactor core was burning, that the core 
was still melting and that the reactor continued to release enormous quantities 
of radioactivity and heat. 
</P>
<P>
At 7 a.m. Sunday, April 27, Pikalov and the group of nuclear experts who had 
spent the night discussing his findings, reported the situation to the 
government commission. The commission in turn reported to the Kremlin. Pikalov 
probably also reported to his military superiors in the Ministry of Defense. 
This was the first proper information received by the leaders of the Soviet 
Union about the scale of the disaster and its possible consequences. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the government commission arrived in Pripyat, it was clear that if 
the reactor was still releasing enormous amounts of radioactive material, the 
danger to the local population was mounting rapidly. Evacuation was clearly 
indicated, but the commission's medical officers wanted to delay it, on the 
ground that the radiation level in Pripyat was not high enough. 
</P>
<P>
Although the authorities knew the gravity of the situation, they did not 
realize the radioactive plume had crossed the Soviet border and that the 
accident had acquired international dimensions. The radiation monitoring 
service had probably not yet been able to summarize the contours of the plume 
and offer computer predictions of its movements. There was still hope that the 
accident could be covered up. And as long as there was that chance, local radio 
and television could not be used to advise people to stay indoors. Thus people 
in Kiev were not informed of the accident and the evacuees from Pripyat were 
moved only a short distance, to villages in the Polessky district, 40 
kilometers southwest of Chernobyl. 
</P>
<P>
The news blackout was partly lifted on May 6, when Soviet journalists were 
allowed to send "heroic" reports from Chernobyl, including some details of the 
"great battle" that, it was claimed, had already been won. However, no 
technical details were given. 
</P>
<P>
It was feared that public trust in nuclear energy would be undermined. Both the 
Soviet government and the nuclear industry wanted to preserve the momentum of 
the nuclear energy program. It was not only a crucial element of the Soviet 
Five-Year Plan and of the long-term plan to the year 2000, it was also the 
cornerstone of plans to integrate the economies of the Soviet Union and the 
countries of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Chernobyl accident had serious repercussions for the Five-Year Plan, set to 
be presented during the Supreme Soviet session in June. But the government was 
unwilling to reconsider it at such short notice and no changes were made. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-day news blackout on Chernobyl may have harmed the reputation of the 
Soviet government and its new policy of glasnost, but it did not surprise 
anyone who lives and works in the Soviet Union. Glasnost was new. It had not 
yet become a trend that could be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, this short-sighted attitude made the emergency work more costly, 
particularly in terms of human health. But there was probably also a reluctance 
to appear helpless, and the Soviet government was helpless until the inferno of 
the graphite fire and the huge releases of radioactive products were 
controlled. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the news blackout were thus primarily domestic. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows what is left inside the sarcophagus and whether the Chernobyl 
radioactive volcano is really dead. Nor do they know whether it will be safe 
for future generations.

<HEAD>Report: High Radiation Levels Detected In Soviet Arms Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Karachay Lake, a 100-acre body of water in the
Soviet Union, could be ``the most polluted spot on the planet,''
the result of years of radioactive waste dumping, according to a
published report today.
   U.S. experts who recently visited a Soviet nuclear weapons
production complex found extremely high levels of radioactive
contamination and a history of high doses to production workers,
The New York Times reported.
   The Soviets have confirmed that in 1951, atomic bomb makers
began pumping radioactive wastes into Karachay Lake _ about 900
miles east of Moscow _ a practice that continued until the
accumulation reached 120 million curies.
   That amount is about 2{ times greater than the release from the
Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986.
   ``This has got to be the must polluted spot on the planet,''
said Thomas B. Cochran, a physicist and senior staff scientist at
the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private environmental
group in Washington.
   The dose rate on the lake shore near the outlet pipe is 600
roentgen per hour, according to a new report by Cochran and Robert
Standish Norris, also at the council.
   At that rate, one hour's exposure would kill a person within
weeks, the Times reported.
   The Times said Soviet documents describe a ``sanitary alienation
zone'' in contaminated areas in which people are forbidden to live
or travel. The zone's size was unknown.
   ``Provided you keep away from it, which they are, it is causing
no harm to public health,'' said Richard Wilson, a Harvard
University physicist who has studied the Soviet nuclear complex.
``I would characterize it as greater than anything we've even
contemplated in this country.''
   Recent Soviet disclosures also show very high worker exposures,
the newspaper said.
   Other scientists who have visited the area recently say the lake
was extremely contaminated, but they disagreed on the degree of
contamination.
   Estimates ranged from as high as 600 roentgen per hour down to
six, said Frank L. Parker, an engineering professor at Vanderbilt
University and chairman of the National Academy of Sciences board
on radioactive waste management. He was at the Chelyabinsk site in
June.
   But whether 600 or six, Parker said, both constitute an
``astronomical dosage.''
   Even the lower figure would surpass the maximum allowable
exposure for an American worker for a year, the Times reported.

<F P=106> [Aleksey Tarasov article: ``Krasnoyarsk-26 Threatens Global </F>
Disaster''] 
  [Text] Krasnoyarsk -- The legacy of the Cold War will not 
allow Russians to live in peace for some time to come. Quite 
recently, in 1992, progressive public opinion as a whole 
rejoiced at the closure of two industrial reactors located in 
the secret underground complex at Krasnoyarsk-26 that produced 
weapons-grade plutonium, the substance used to fill nuclear 
warheads. This event really was something to be pleased about. 
However, unresolved problems connected with radiochemical 
production and the territories contaminated by this nuclear 
production were swept under the carpet; these problems are now 
making themselves felt with increasing frequency. What is to be 
done with the accumulated plutonium and radioactive waste? And 
finally, what is to be done with the thousands of people who 
forged the nuclear shield? This entire cluster of problems has 
come to the fore in the closed city of Krasnoyarsk-26. 
<H5>  Time Bomb </H5>
  Environmental catastrophe is the natural result of the work 
carried out by the Krasnoyarsk nuclear scientists. The true 
scale of the environmental contamination is only now becoming 
apparent. For almost 30 years liquid radioactive waste from 
military production has been pumped underground -- into the 
aquiferous sand and clay strata beneath the ``Severnyy'' 
installation. Radioactive waste is still being pumped today. 
  According to data published openly in the press, the 
underground reservoir has received millions of cubic meters of 
radioactive waste with a total radioactivity level of hundreds 
of millions of curies. On the basis of its design parameters, 
this reservoir is now full to capacity. The underground 
reservoirs are infinitely expandable. Nevertheless, if an 
additional RT-2 plant is then built to reclaim the spent nuclear 
fuel, it seems likely that ``Severnyy'' will have to accept 
tritium. 
  This installation is unique in many ways. In the opinion of 
specialists, it is the only storage facility in the world that 
operates a dual system of injection and discharge wells. As 
radioactive waste is pumped in, underground stratal water is 
drawn off. These processes deep underground are monitored via a 
system of observation wells. 
  The site of the installation is also extremely interesting 
-- 
it is located in the Yenisey valley (the distance between the 
river channel and the edge of the installation is 750 meters) on 
a high terrace (100 meters above the level of water in the 
river). Experts are extremely skeptical about the impermeability 
of the screen designed to stop the radioactive waste from moving 
toward the river. And, generally speaking, ``tongues'' of 
waste, judging from geological maps of the area, can travel 
unpredictably large distances. 
  But that is not all. The installation is located in an 
extremely unfavorable site in geological-tectonic terms. 
Hydrogeologist A. Goryunov has the following to say: 
```Severnyy's' location is unique. The fact is that in zones 
where there are regional faults, the various elements of the 
earth's crust are arranged in blocks, so to speak, and this 
basically cannot ensure safe, long-term storage of nuclear 
waste. Moreover, world experience demonstrates that in 
geotectonic conditions such as these, there is an increased risk 
of seismic activity.... These processes are unpredictable. The 
installation poses a potential contaminatory threat to the 
Yenisey and the waters of the Arctic Ocean. Accidents connected 
with leakage of radioactive waste are possible and could be 
described as serious and global in their implications.'' 
  Liquid industrial waste is conveyed to the installation via 
a 
15km-long pipeline. According to V. Savelyev, director of the 
chemical isotope plant, no cases of radioactive waste leaking to 
the surface have been noted throughout the period the plant has 
been operating. 
  Meanwhile, last fall a public environmental-technical expert 
study of the installation began. A preliminary conclusion on 
the results of the investigation into the radiological condition 
of the soil along the course of the pipeline has already been 
prepared within the framework of this study. The results have 
been described as ``conflicting.'' 
  Your IZVESTIYA correspondent has met with V. Chechetkin, 
leader of the field investigation and director of the regional 
center for radioecological studies. According to him, two major 
areas of radioactive contamination and eight localized spots 
have been discovered. At the same time, a contaminated sector 
of the Yenisey floodplain not far from the river bank is causing 
particular alarm. The streams and gullies located in this 
region, and also the surface washout, create favorable 
conditions for the migration of radioisotopes into the general 
water system. The nature of the contamination leads us to 
suppose that it may be due to ``seepages'' [prolivy] of liquid 
radioactive waste. 
  Chechetkin also indicates that the site of the installation 
on the side adjacent to the village of Bolshoy Balchug is 
unguarded. There are specially-built wells that anyone can use 
located at intervals of 100-150 meters. There are also 
organizations not directly involved in nuclear production 
located in the vicinity of the pipeline. All these constitute 
additional risk factors. 
  On the whole, it is obvious to the independent investigators 
of ``Severnyy'' that it should stop operating. More up-to-date 
methods should be used to recycle radioactive waste. 
<H5>  Yenisey's Nuclear Spoor </H5>
  In a climate of absolute secrecy, the lucid minds of the 
Soviet defense industry have been destroying the mighty Yenisey 
for over 30 years. Water from the great river -- the ``hub of 
Russia'' -- was cleansed of suspended particles and used to cool 
the radioactive parts of nuclear reactors, after which it was 
returned to the Yenisey. 
  Recently a number of expeditions have studied the state of 
the river. Radioactive contamination of the Yenisey floodplain 
can be traced from the point where waste has been discharged 
along the course of the river to the Yenisey Gulf; the 
contamination occurs in patches. Plutonium-238 and -239, 
cobalt-60, cesium-134 and -137, strontium-90, and other isotopes 
have all been found in riverbed sediment, algae, sections of 
river bank washed by floodwater, shoals, sandbars, and islands. 
Fish containing man-made [tekhnogennyy] radionuclides have been 
found both downstream of Krasnoyarsk-26 -- at distances of many 
hundreds of miles -- and upstream, in the vicinity of Greater 
Krasnoyarsk. The investigators caught one fish which positively 
``glowed'' at 580 microcuries per hour. 
  The plutonium content of the soil in some areas of the 
floodplain is tens of times higher than the total level of 
contamination. According to data presented by specialists from 
the Applied Geophysics Institute and the Krasnoyarsk Scientific 
Center of the Siberian Department of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences, the concentration of plutonium in riverbed sediment 
and this sort of soil is so large that chance wind-borne 
transfer of contaminated earth and inhalation of the dust by a 
human being would be equivalent to the maximum permitted annual 
intake of plutonium into the human organism. 
  The decades of the Cold War have poisoned this mighty river 
for a long time to come: Plutonium-239 has a half-life of 
24,000 years, and according to scientists, it remains dangerous 
for 10 times the length of this half-life, that is to say for 
240,000 years. 
  It makes no sense to blame anybody for the madness that has 
occurred. But it is hard to understand why the tradition of 
secrecy is being maintained to this day. Even now it is unclear 
how many curies of long-life radionuclides the combine has 
discharged into the environment. Information about plutonium 
contamination of the air, soil, and water remains confidential, 
despite the fact that data has been published in the United 
States showing how many tonnes of this deadly substance was 
produced by the combine, despite the fact that Siberian 
ecologists know these figures, and despite the existence of 
calculations about the possible amount of plutonium lost during 
production.... The nuclear scientists are refusing to release 
essential documents to the ecologists who are currently studying 
the state of ``Severnyy.'' 
  People should know what conditions they are living in, they 
are entitled to know where and where not to gather berries, go 
fishing, and graze cattle. The most dangerous areas should be 
marked and fenced off. At the very least, we should try to 
eliminate radioactive contamination from areas along the river 
bank and close to settlements. But most important of all, 
research work is currently being carried out and amendments are 
being made to the project to build the RT-2 plant at 
Krasnoyarsk-26. It seems that for the Ministry of Atomic Energy 
and Krasnoyarsk's nuclear scientists, the question of whether or 
not to go ahead with construction is not even on the agenda. 
Apart from their natural desire to preserve their cadres, no 
other arguments are basically being advanced.

   Smiling children skip along dirt
paths, kicking up radioactive dust. They throw stones in their
radioactive playground, then go home for contaminated meat and milk.
   Since cesium, strontium and plutonium descended on their
rooftops, gardens, farms and schools four years ago, the people of
this Byelorussian village and of scores more in the Ukraine and
Russia have been prisoners of Chernobyl.
   They are surrounded and continously bombarded by an enemy they
cannot see, smell or hear. They say their government and the world
have all but forgotten them.
   In Bartolomeyevka, another village, a warm and hearty woman
named Tatiana T. Kharshunova said: ``They did this to us, and we
had to live here. Not just for a month or two but four years. No
one paid attention to us.''
   She and her neighbors grow potatoes and barley in their gardens,
even though the radiation level is 40 curies, nearly three times
the danger level. They can recite the figures like scientists, but
do not seem fully aware of the threat.
   ``I'm as strong as a horse,'' Irina Y. Kovoleva said. She looked
down at her 14-month-old grandson in her arms and added: ``He's
strong, too.''
   The boy and his parents were scheduled to be evacuated the next
day.
   ``I'll cry when they leave,'' the grandmother said. ``The
cemetery is nearby, so I'll die and go there.''
   Nadezhda N. Dmitrochenko of the local governing council said she
tries to explain the dangers of radiation, but ``people still don't
know what this is. ... It doesn't glow and it doesn't whistle.''
   On April 26, 1986, an explosion and fire destroyed one of four
reactors at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Ukraine, 125
miles southwest of Noviye Gromyki.
   As the children of the village played on a sunny April day four
years later, chickens and cats darted among the green and brown
wooden huts.
   The only sounds were chickens clucking, dogs barking and the
distant roar of tractors plowing contaminated fields in the vast,
fertile plain traversed by a creek.
   The official death toll from Chernobyl remains at 31, but a
Soviet newspaper said last fall it had risen to 250. Scientists
still predict thousands of deaths will be traceable to the accident.
   After years of passivity, the people affected are speaking out.
   Residents of Gomel, the provincial capital, plan a strike and
demonstration Thursday, the anniversary, to protest official
handling of what the government newspaper Izvestia called ``the
greatest technological catastrophe'' in world history.
   Citizens of Kiev, the Ukrainian capital 80 miles south of
Chernobyl, also plan demonstratons. A telethon to raise money for
victims is scheduled in Moscow.
   Protesters demand that officials who concealed the extent of the
danger and delayed evacuating contaminated areas be brought to
trial. They want medical care for victims and supplies of
radiation-free food.
   About 70 percent of the Chernobyl radiation fell on Byelorussia
and contaminated one-fifth of the arable land, an area twice the
size of Massachusetts, where 2.2 million people live.
   Immediately after the accident, about 25,000 Byelorussians were
evacuated, but only last year did officials admit the full scope of
the contamination and decide to resettle more than 100,000 more.
The resettlement will take five years, and people eat and breathe
nuclear poison in the meantime.
   The program appears poorly run. Some evacuees are being
resettled on land that also is contaminated and the government is
building new homes, schools and offices in areas that are being
evacuated.
   Most families with young children have been moved out of Noviye
Gromyki since resettlement began Jan. 1.
   Those still waiting feel abandoned and frightened. They cannot
move on their own because housing must be found for them.
   ``We sit and cry,'' said Claudia A. Kostochka, 75, who was on a
bench with two other women, sobbing. ``They won't take us. We're
pensioners.''
   ``I lived almost a whole century here, raised a son and daughter
here. Two weeks ago they closed our store, so we're eating cabbage
and cucumber preserves from last year. We don't know whether it's
dangerous or not, but we have to eat.''
   A farmer said the milk from his cows was too radioactive to
drink, so he sells it to the government, which makes it into
butter. He said the butter was supposed to be safe.
   Many others interviewed said they drank the milk because there
was no alternative. As many more said they did not bother to have
their home produce checked at a local radiation laboratory.
   Soil and dust carry radioactive particles.
   The only paved surfaces in Noviye Gromyki are one street and the
grade school playground at No. 13 Lenin Street. Winds blow dust
from the dirt roads and fields onto the asphalt and the people, and
into their homes.
   Residents are warned not to gather firewood from the highly
radioactive forests nearby. Burning it makes their stoves into what
specialists have called ``mini-reactors.''
   Villagers are supposed to wash frequently, but they are allowed
only one bar of soap a month, the same as anyone else. Soap is
rationed in most of the country.
   Each household gets 30 rubles a month from the government to buy
uncontaminated food, but it is hard to find. Thirty rubles are
worth $49 at the official exchange rate, but much less in reality.
   In Vetka, a few miles south of Novoyi Gromyki, children are fed
``clean'' meals at High School No. 1 and the crumbling cement
floors are washed several times a day.
   Outside, their protection against radiation consists of paved
playground and a 6-inch-high concrete barrier to keep them off the
sidewalk where contaminated dirt falls from the roof. Students are
supposed to rinse their shoes in a pan of water at the school
entrance, but many don't.
   Several students said they ignored warnings and rode mopeds in
the forest. They complained of headaches and exhaustion, which they
blamed on fallout.
   To the list of ailments the Chernobyl generation suffers, school
principal Nikolai N. Shatilo added bloody noses, swollen thyroid
glands and vision loss. The radiation level at High School No. 1 is
two to three times normal.
   ``We can't provide normal conditions in school,'' he said.
``There's only one thing to do: take them to a clean zone. We must
save the children. They are our future.''
   One student said she was bitter because no one seemed to care,
not even the doctors who examine her class twice a year.
   A 16-year-old boy said: ``We're sick and tired of all the
checkups. What are they for? All they do is keep saying
everything's normal.''

<F P=106> [Article by Kjell Dragnes: "Wild Growth in the Wake of the </F>
Accident"] 
  [Text] Chernobyl/Kiev--"The zone"--it is only spoken of 
that way by those in the know--that restricted area 30 
kilometers in diameter around the power plant, has become a huge 
testing and research area. Six and one-half years after the 
explosion and the fire at the nuclear power plant--which began 
on 26 April 1986--the effects are being observed on people, 
animals, and plants. For researchers it has become a mecca. Here 
they hope to find answers to what man-made radioactivity does to 
the environment and those of us who live with the environment. 
  It is important to learn this, not just for the Ukrainians, 
but also for other countries with nuclear power and for 
countries without nuclear power. Because contamination knows no 
borders. The zone is uninhabited; 163,000 people were evacuated 
from the region. But beyond the zone people live. People live in 
Valdres in Norway, where there are places that are just as 
contaminated with radioactive materials as the soil and the 
woods in the vicinity of Chernobyl. 
<H5>  Berlin Blue </H5>
  The effects of this contamination could have been very 
great, 
in economic and health terms, if it had not been for Berlin blue. 
  "It might sound like boasting, but the fact is that the 
Norwegian initiative with Berlin blue is almost the only 
successful research project in Chernobyl, in Ukraine, in 
Belarus, and, not least of all, here in Norway," said Per 
Strand, a researcher at the Norwegian Radiation Protection 
Agency. Since 1990, and together with Brit Salbu and Knut Hove, 
professors at the University of Trondheim's College of Arts and 
Sciences [NLH], he has been working with Ukraine, Belarus, and 
Russia on the fallout from Chernobyl. 
  The pigment, which was first produced in Berlin in 1704, 
hence the name, contains a complex iron ion (FeIIFeII-(Cn)6) 
which has proven effective as a binder for radioactive cesium, 
Cs137. The first research on Berlin blue was carried out at the 
Radium Hospital in the sixties; later a method was developed 
using Berlin blue as an additive to blocks of salt lick and as a 
pre-additive. This was done at the Norwegian Agricultural 
College, which in 1991 tested tablets in Ukraine, Belarus, and 
Russia--with fairly remarkable results. 
  Berlin blue works in such a way that radioactive materials 
are not absorbed into the body or turn up in meat and milk. An 
absorption reduction of some 90 percent means that large 
contaminated areas can still be used by people and animals. 
  How important this is in economic and health terms can be 
illustrated by the following figures: 
  In Ukraine, more than 7 million hectares of ground have been 
contaminated by Cesium 137, so the radioactivity is over 1 curie 
per square kilometer (calculated another way: 37,000 becquerels 
per square meter). Today 2.6 million people live in this area. 
Between 1986 and 1991, Ukraine spent over 15 billion karbovanets 
to neutralize and reduce the effects of the fallout. Even if 
inflation is high and Ukraine's currency is still dropping in 
value, this is nevertheless a very major burden. 
  In addition, there are huge areas in Belarus, especially 
around Gomel. And areas in Norway. Norway is in fact the country 
outside the former Soviet Union that was the most affected, and 
will continue to be the most affected, by the fallout from 
Chernobyl. In Valdres, there are many areas where the 
contamination varies between 1 and 10 curies per square 
kilometer. 
  Norway is also especially vulnerable because we use 
wilderness areas for grazing to such an extent. A survey done by 
the NHL and the Radiation Protection Agency in Ukraine showed 
that on land that is farmed, plowed, and fertilized, the 
absorption of radioactive materials in plants is less. The type 
of soil is also important; the contamination of organic soil 
(soil rich in humus) is the worst; radioactive particles are 
more permanent in clayey soil. 
<H5>  Get By Cheaply </H5>
  By simply giving Berlin blue to domestic animals, absorption 
in meat and milk can thus be neutralized. The economic 
consequences are great. In Belarus alone, they would have to 
spend between 5 and 10 percent of the [gross] national product 
to neutralize the contamination; now they can get by with much 
less. 
  We are also doing that. If we had followed the international 
standards for the absorption of radioactive materials and not 
used any countermeasures, Norwegian agriculture would have lost 
between 1 and 2 billion kroner annually. Using Berlin blue, the 
radiation values are brought way down. Cost: around 100 million 
kroner. 
  The Norwegian research applies not just to reductions of 
absorption in animals. It also includes a project in which the 
aim is to study the mobility of radioactive materials in 
relation to the distance from a nuclear power plant where there 
have been emissions. The goal of this research is to learn more 
about what Norway could be exposed to if, for example, an 
accident were to occur at the Russian nuclear power plant on the 
Kola [Peninsula]. 
<H5>  Eight Thousand Dead From Radiation </H5>
  "We have seen many tears," said Vladimir Kholosha, the 
deputy 
minister at the Chernobyl ministry. "Tears because people had to 
leave their homes, tears because people died from minor 
illnesses. People's immune systems were so weakened by radiation 
that even `innocuous' diseases have become life-threatening." 
  Today there is hardly anyone who has an overview of what 
effect the radiation from Chernobyl has had on public health. 
Kholosha confirmed that about 8,000 people have died, and that 
it was due to large doses of radioactivity. In early September, 
the Ukranian national assembly, Verhovna Rada, approved a 
comprehensive program for the next two years and the period 
between now and the year 2000 to reduce the effects. But money 
is needed--scads of money--and Ukraine does not have it. 
  At the same time a major effort is under way, under the 
aegis, among others, of the UN and the EC, to survey public 
health conditions. A good six and one-half years after the 
accident, we are starting to see some of the consequences. In 
Ukraine and Belarus, infantile thyroid gland cancer has 
increased dramatically, a survey conducted by the World Health 
Organization, WHO, showed. Since 1989, 225 new cases have been 
reported in Belarus, 157 in Ukraine. Normally there would only 
have been two to three cases. 
  Ukrainian experts also think they are seeing more deaths 
from 
other diseases, among others of the heart, blood vessels, and 
the circulatory system, but inasmuch as there are so many 
factors that influence the development of such diseases, at the 
moment it is too early to suggest any connection. 
Regardless--the national assembly, Verhovna Rada, certainly 
stands by what it said when it states that the Chernobyl 
accident "will be seen as the worst tragedy in 20th century 
Ukrainian history, and will affect the lives of several 
generations of people." 
<H5>  Strange Evergreen Forest </H5>
  The needles on the fir trees do not look like ordinary 
needles--even if they come from the common fir, pinus 
silvestris. They are in different sizes. Some are long, others 
are short, some are growing in loops. From every growth point, 
where normally five branches would grow, here between six and 20 
grow. All the same, upon closer inspection, this green forest is 
not that normal. 
  "We can see changes in the pattern of growth," said Andrei 
Arkhipov, one of the researchers at the center in Pripyat. "But 
it is impossible to see whether there are genetic changes; for 
that, we have to have several generations of trees. The green 
forest of firs was sown with seeds from those trees that 
received the greatest radiation damage in 1986, and turned red." 
  Arkhipov is the son of Prof. Nikolai Archipov, one of 
Russia's greatest experts on the effects of radioactive 
contamination. For many years the elder Arkhipov conducted 
studies of the effects of the once unknown nuclear accident in 
Kyshtym in the Urals. Now the laboratory has been moved to 
Chernobyl. 
  The forest is just one of the research areas. In large 
greenhouses tests have been made on plants such as rape, lupine, 
oats, root crops, and vegetables to study the absorption of 
radioactive materials in the plants--and how this can be 
neutralized. 
  "The most effective countermeasure we have found to date is 
fertilization with potassium, which prevents the absorption of 
cesium. Applying lime is useful to reduce the absorption of 
strontium," Arkhipov said. The center has extensively mapped the 
contaminated area, which shows a spotty pattern. In some places 
the fallout can be great, just as it can be practically free of 
radioactive materials. The main goal of this research is to see 
how agricultural areas can be reused after a nuclear accident.

<HEAD>20 Gallons of Heavy Water Spills at Savannah River; Two Exposed to

   Twenty gallons of heavy water spilled at the
Savannah River nuclear weapons plant Wednesday, sending a plume of
radioactive tritium into the air, but there was no threat to
workers or area residents, officials said.
   Two workers at the Savannah River Site who were splashed with
the water received small doses of radidation, about the equivalent
of half a chest X-ray, officials said.
   Crews were unable to detect radioactivity at the plant or along
its boundaries, said Dennis Stevenson, manager of health protection
operations for Westinghouse Savannah River Co., which operates the
plant for the U.S. Department of Energy.
   Tritium is a highly radioactive gas used in the production of
nuclear warheads and is manufactured only at the Savannah River
plant.
   The spill occurred at 12:05 a.m. while two workers were
replacing a flange, or connecting joint, on water pipes to heat
exchangers on the K Reactor, one of three reactors at SRS shut down
for safety modifications in 1988.
   About five gallons of water runoff is expected when replacing a
flange, and officials said they were uncertain why 20 gallons was
in the pipe.
   Operations at the plant were back to normal less than eight
hours after the spill, and clean-up was expected to be completed by
the end of the day, said John Patterson, deputy director of
DOE-Savannah River Reactor Restart Special Projects Office.
   The spill was first declared an alert at 2:20 a.m. but was
downgraded to an unusual event at 5:41 a.m., the DOE said. An
unusual event is the lowest of four nuclear emergency classes.
   As the area where the spill occurred was ventilated through the
reactor stack, monitoring equipment detected the tritium release,
which triggered the alert, said Charles Peckinpaugh, deputy general
manager of reactor operations
   A small amount of tritium, 825 curies, was released into the
atmosphere, Stevenson said.
   Based on weather conditions, the projected radiation dose at the
plant boundary was .003 millirem, ``about one-one-thousandth of the
dose you would get from natural background radiation,'' he said.
   One worker was exposed to 10 millirem of radiation, the
equivalent of half the radiation emitted during a normal chest
X-ray, officials said. They said the second worker received about
the same amount of radiation but had no figures.
   About 100 other employees were in the reactor at the time, but
were not evacuated, officials said.
   Patterson said Westinghouse and DOE would conduct a joint
investigation of the incident.
   The K reactor is expected to be the first of the plant's three
reactors to be restarted once safety modifications are completed,
possibly before the end of the year.

Problems of Disarmament, Energy Development and Environmental 
Protection (Moscow Physics and Technology Institute): 
"Plutonium: New Aspects of National and International Security"] 
  [Text] A high-level U.S. delegation to include 
representatives of Congress and the Department of Energy will 
arrive in Russia in May to consult on the issue of shutting down 
nuclear reactors in the "closed" cities of Tomsk-7 and 
Krasnoyarsk-26. 
  This visit by American government experts is taking 
place within the framework of agreements reached between 
Chernomyrdin and Gore in December 1993 regarding the creation of 
a joint working group to study and develop a number of issues 
connected with nuclear arms reduction. During the May visit 
there are plans to: study opportunities for achieving greater 
transparency and irreversibility in nuclear arms reduction, and 
placing civilian plutonium and surplus military plutonium under 
monitoring; discuss the technical details of mutual inspections 
of sites where parts made of fissionable materials are stored; 
and discuss possible means of utilizing plutonium to prevent its 
accumulation. This is a multifaceted issue and involves not only 
technological aspects, but serious political aspects as 
well. 
  By the mid-1980's the nuclear arsenals created by the former 
Soviet Union and the United States during the Cold War totalled 
more than 60,000 nuclear warheads. Of that number, more than 
one-half belonged to the USSR. The process of nuclear 
disarmament begun by the two superpowers and the development of 
that process, in which the collapsed USSR's place has been taken 
by Russia, will result in a sharp reduction in the size of that 
arsenal. In compliance with the START I and START II treaties 
the total number of strategic warheads retained by each side 
must not exceed 3,500 by the year 2003. Taking into 
consideration unilateral pledges to reduce tactical nuclear 
weapons, over the next decade Russia and the United States will 
have to destroy several tens of thousands of warheads. The 
result will be a sharp reduction in the threat of nuclear war. 
  According to various estimates, the process of destroying 
nuclear warheads will result in Russia and the United States 
freeing up a total of approximately 900 metric tons of highly 
enriched uranium and more than 100 metric tons of weapons-grade 
plutonium (approximately 50 metric tons for each country). These 
two materials are the basis for the manufacture of nuclear 
detonation devices. It takes 3-5 kg of plutonium to make a 
single nuclear device, and three or four times that much highly 
enriched uranium. Therefore acquisition of these materials is a 
priority goal for states seeking to acquire nuclear weapons. 
  The existence of surplus fissionable materials presents a 
threat both to Russian and U.S. national security and to world 
security. Retention of those materials retains the possibility 
that they will be used to make nuclear weapons again, thereby 
undermining the irreversibility of nuclear disarmament efforts. 
The emergence of any crisis in Russian-American relations could 
quite easily provoke a resurrection of the nuclear arms race. 
Therefore the goal should be the permanent removal of these 
materials from the military realm. For Russia the situation is 
made more difficult by internal political instability, 
slackening of state monitoring functions, and a difficult 
economic and environmental situation. Consequently, for it the 
choice of the optimum means of utilizing (or destroying) surplus 
weapons-grade fissionable materials and monitoring them is a 
task of priority importance. 
  Highly enriched uranium (which consists primarily of the 
U-235 isotope) may be de-enriched by mixing it with natural 
uranium and then used in the production of fuel for the nuclear 
power industry. An agreement has been reached under which Russia 
will sell the United States uranium with an enrichment level of 
4 percent for the purpose of manufacturing fuel. Within the 
framework of that agreement 500 metric tons of Russian 
weapons-grade uranium made available through warhead elimination 
will be reprocessed over a period of 20 years. The value of this 
contract is in excess of $12 billion. A separate agreement also 
provides for mutual monitoring measures that will prevent Russia 
from using uranium that does not come from military sources and 
America from using the uranium for purposes not stipulated in 
the contract. Thus there are presently no technical or political 
obstacles to the utilization of weapons-grade uranium. 
  Plutonium is a different matter. Neither Russia nor the 
United States currently has any real means of destroying it or 
utilizing it. Realizing the nationwide scale of the plutonium 
issue and the fact that plutonium is one of the most closely 
guarded topics, decisions in regard to which are made by a small 
group of experts, I would like to direct public attention to 
this matter as well. 
  Plutonium is in the group of transuranium elements, and is 
number 94 in Mendeleev's periodic table of elements. It does not 
occur naturally on Earth, and was obtained by artificial means. 
The first samples were created by the Seaborg Group (United 
States) in 1941 by bombarding with neutrons a uranium nucleus 
with a mass number of 238. 
  Just like U-235, plutonium-239, when it interacts with 
neutrons, breaks down, releasing energy and neutrons, which are 
essential in maintaining a nuclear chain reaction. It is this 
characteristic that makes it a strategic material. It is used to 
produce nuclear weapons, and its small critical mass compared to 
U-235 makes it preferable as a source of nuclear detonation. 
  The toxic effect of plutonium on living organisms is due to 
the alpha particles formed when it decays. Alpha particles that 
enter living tissue destroy the tissue at the cellular level. 
The radioactivity of one gram of weapons-grade plutonium is 
approximately 0.7 curie. Therefore just 2 micrograms of that 
type of plutonium in the body of a human being weighing 70 kg 
could prove fatal. 
  Weapons-grade plutonium is produced in special industrial 
reactors with a low level of fuel combustion. These are 
graphite-water fuel-channel-type reactors with an output of 
around 2,000 megawatts. There were 13 such reactors in the 
USSR/Russia: five at Chelyabinsk-65, five at Tomsk-7 and three 
at Krasnoyarsk-26. According to various estimates, the former 
USSR had produced approximately 150 metric tons of weapons-grade 
plutonium. There are only three reactors still in operation -- 
two at Tomsk-7 and one at Krasnoyarsk-26 -- but they increase 
the quantity of weapons-grade plutonium, for which Russia no 
longer has any use, by two metric tons a year. 
  Plutonium can also be produced by any nuclear power plant 
operating on ordinary uranium fuel. But nuclear power plant 
reactors that have a high level of fuel burn-up produce 
energy-grade plutonium. Note that energy-grade plutonium can 
also be used to made a nuclear detonation device. 
  All the technological steps involved in obtaining plutonium 
are accompanied by the creation of a large quantity of liquid 
radioactive waste. The process of setting up radiochemical 
technology and the operation thereof result in radioactive 
contamination, among other things by plutonium, of huge areas 
where the radiochemical production facilities are located: the 
Mayak Production Association in Chelyabinsk Oblast, the Siberian 
Chemical Combine at Tomsk-7 and the Krasnoyarsk Mining and 
Chemical Combine at Krasnoyarsk-26. Restoring these contaminated 
areas will require a tremendous amount of work. 
  According to figures cited in American articles, the 
production of a single kilogram of weapons-grade plutonium 
involves the creation of four cubic meters of liquid radioactive 
waste with a radioactivity concentration of 2 Yez [expansion 
unknown] curies/cubic meter and a plutonium concentration of 
0.005 kg per cubic meter. Thus the former USSR's production of 
150 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium was accompanied by 
the creation of liquid radioactive waste containing as much as 
half a billion curies of radioactivity. A substantial portion of 
this radioactivity was pumped into underground clay strata (at 
Tomsk-7 and Krasnoyarsk-26). At the Mayak combine these wastes, 
totalling 570 million curies, are stored in steel containers. 
The explosion of one such container in September 1957 resulted 
in the release of 20 million curies of radiation into the 
environment and the radionuclide contamination of 23,000 sq. km. 
The population of that area was 272,000, more than one-third of 
whom were subsequently resettled. The current proposal is that 
the stored highly radioactive waste left over from the defense 
program be vitrified, yet at this time there is no reliable, 
functional vitrification technology. 
  Plutonium's strategic significance and extremely high 
radioactivity require a responsible approach to its storage and 
the selection of a means of utilizing it. Among the proposals of 
various means of utilizing weapons-grade plutonium there are two 
that are preferable from the current standpoint: use as fuel in 
nuclear power plants or vitrification along with the radioactive 
waste created during its production, with subsequent burial of 
the waste. 
  Both these proposed means do not destroy the plutonium as 
such, they merely shift it from the weapons-grade category to 
reactor grade. It is essential to note that the greater portion 
of the plutonium produced in the world as of the present time by 
energy-producing nuclear power stations--approximately 700 
metric tons--is contained in spent fuel. It is assumed that this 
fuel's high level of radioactivity serves as a sort of physical 
"self defense" and prevents the extraction of plutonium from it 
without highly developed technology. Vitrification also reduces 
weapons-grade plutonium to the standard for "spent fuel." 
  At the present time none of the proposed methods has any 
convincing scientific, technical or economic arguments to 
support it, therefore use of any one of them will require a 
preparatory period of at least 10 years. In this context 
cooperation between various organizations in the United States 
and Russia aimed at thoroughly studying all possible means of 
utilizing plutonium appears highly desirable. 
  It is worth noting that the choice of a means of utilizing 
weapons-grade plutonium will also be influenced by such factors 
as the adoption of a concept for the fuel-and-energy cycle. A 
number of countries--France, Belgium, Russia and until recently 
Great Britain, Japan and Germany--support the concept of a 
closed fuel cycle. But only France has made some progress with 
regard to the use of extracted plutonium to produce fuel. As of 
the present time Russia has extracted approximately 30 metric 
tons of energy-grade plutonium, which is stored at the Mayak 
combine. However, in contrast to France, Russia does not 
currently possess the ability to utilize it. 
  The utilization concept for weapons-grade plutonium drawn up 
by the Ministry of Atomic Energy presumes that it will be used 
as fuel. Within the framework of that concept there are plans to 
utilize either existing VVER-1000 reactors or the BN-800 [fast 
neutron] reactors that are under construction at the South Urals 
Atomic Power Station. It is possible that specially designed 
thermal reactors will also be used. 
  VVER-1000 reactors could be used to denature weapons-grade 
plutonium using a 30 percent MOX fuel charge (MOX fuel is made 
from a mixture of slightly enriched uranium and plutonium). 
However, extensive preliminary work will be necessary to assess 
the capabilities of reactor control and protection systems and 
to analyze the effects of possible accidents. Furthermore, 
Russia does not have an existing enterprise producing MOX fuel 
for the VVER-1000, and construction of the RT-2 complex at 
Krasnoyarsk-26 has been suspended. 
  Nor can the idea of using fast neutron reactors be 
implemented immediately, due to the lack of such reactors. The 
existing BN-600 reactor uses uranium fuel, and BN-800 reactors 
are still under construction. Complex 300 at the Mayak combine, 
designed to produce MOX fuel for BN-800 reactors, is currently 
in a state of 50 percent readiness. 
  The United States supports the concept of an open fuel cycle 
and currently rejects reprocessing, primarily for two reasons: 
1. reprocessing would encourage the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons; and 2. the use of uranium to produce fuel for power 
reactors is currently much more economical than the use of 
plutonium. 
  Although the United States does not preclude the possibility 
of reprocessing fuel in the future, at the present time it has 
no desire to signal that weapons-grade plutonium has any 
significance as an energy source, thereby giving the nuclear 
power industry hope of receiving additional government subsidies 
for the development and construction of a new generation of 
nuclear reactors. 
  Thus both countries will be forced to store their plutonium 
for a fairly long period of time. We should note that storage is 
an expensive undertaking. According to various estimates the 
cost of storing a single gram of plutonium is $1.00-2.00 per 
year. Moreover, Russia, according to statements by Ministry of 
Atomic Energy officials, does not possess an appropriate storage 
facility, creating difficulties both with regard to the warhead 
disassembly process and the implementation of reliable 
monitoring. The cost of building an appropriate storage facility 
is estimated at several hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Responding to requests from Russian officials, the U.S. Senate 
has passed a special act under which Russia will be allocated 
$400 million to help with disassembly of its warheads (the 
so-called Nunn-Lugar bill). However, this bill states that the 
money may be used only upon receipt of convincing evidence that 
Russia will not use the materials thus made available to produce 
new nuclear warheads, and that the United States will have the 
right to monitor the nuclear weapon dismantling process in 
Russia. Whereas the first condition seems quite reasonable and 
acceptable, the second has clearly discriminatory overtones and 
is unlikely to be accepted by Russia in that form. The solution 
might be an agreement on mutual monitoring. The primary argument 
in favor of that approach is the fact that agreements regarding 
mutual monitoring of nuclear arsenals will provide a solid 
political foundation upon which to strengthen the nuclear 
non-proliferation system and get the other nuclear countries 
involved in the nuclear disarmament process. However, 
achievement of a comprehensive agreement including provision of 
complete information on nuclear weapons arsenals, the full 
amount of fissionable materials produced and the process of 
nuclear weapons storage and destruction will require much time 
and could thus have an effect on the rate of destruction. 
Therefore it would be more appropriate to move toward that goal 
in stages by concluding a number of intermediate agreements on 
monitoring of newly produced weapons-grade plutonium, on a 
complete halt to such production, and on transfer, under 
bilateral monitoring, of a portion of the plutonium freed up by 
the process of warhead elimination. At the present time both 
sides are conducting consultations toward this end. Achievement 
of these agreements could create a good foundation for progress 
on the issue of monitoring the disassembly of warheads slated 
for destruction and in the direction of a full-scale exchange of 
data regarding nuclear arsenals. 
  One possible solution to the issue of a Russian storage 
facility could be to conclude a bilateral Russian-American 
agreement on the transfer of surplus weapons-grade plutonium in 
both countries to bilateral or international control under the 
aegis of the International Atomic Energy Agency. This would make 
it possible to resolve issues relative to the funding of its 
construction and create certainty about reliable storage and 
monitoring of surplus weapons-grade plutonium until such time as 
reliable means of utilizing it have been developed.

On Sept. 29, 1957, a radioactive cloud 10 kilometers across and carrying 11,000 
curies of strontium-90 spread over the towns of Kyshtym and Chelyabinsk in the 
Soviet Urals. An area larger than Connecticut was seriously contaminated. More 
than 10,000 residents were evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
The deadly cloud (one one-hundredth of a curie of strontium-90 is likely to 
cause death from bone cancer) was created when a storage tank containing highly 
radioactive wastes from plutonium production exploded. The tank's cooling 
system had failed and liquid wastes began to dry, leaving an explosive mixture 
at the bottom of the tank. Soon, runaway reactions produced the explosion. The 
tank's 3-foot-thick concrete cover was blown off. 
</P>
<P>
Could it happen in the United States? The Department of Energy doesn't want you 
to think so. But the answer is yes. Indeed, the more that is learned about the 
accident near Kyshtym, the more ominous are the dangers of a similar explosion 
occurring in eastern Washington state or South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Hanford, Wash., and Savannah River, S.C., are the sites of the country's two 
complexes that produce plutonium for use in nuclear weapons. About 100 million 
gallons of highly radioactive wastes are stored in 14 tanks at Hanford and in 
20 at Savannah River. 
</P>
<P>
The danger at Hanford stems from a chemical treatment applied to the wastes in 
the 1950s. That treatment, which was supposed to precipitate radioactive wastes 
to the tank bottom, made the mixture potentially explosive. 
</P>
<P>
At Savannah River, hydrogen and organic vapor generated by high-level 
radioactive wastes could lead to an explosion if the ventilation system failed 
for an extended time. A buildup of hydrogen reaching or exceeding the lower 
explosive limit has taken place at Savannah River on at least two occasions. An 
explosion there of a magnitude comparable to Kyshtym's could release an even 
greater quantity of strontium-90 and cesium-137 over areas that are much more 
densely populated than those contaminated in the Urals. 
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department's handling of this problem does not inspire confidence. 
It has misrepresented or ignored its own data, thereby failing to learn from 
the Kyshtym experience. For example, the department continues to downplay the 
risk of a tank explosion at Savannah River by citing only the probability of 
any given tank exploding. Since 20 tanks at Savannah River are at risk, 
however, the probability of an explosion occurring in at least one of them is 
considerably higher than the department's estimate. 
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department also claims, disingenuously, that even if a waste tank at 
Savannah River exploded, only a single gallon of the roughly 1 million gallons 
of radioactive material stored in the tank would become airborne. The Kyshtym 
data seriously undermine this estimate. Calculations we have performed suggest 
that a severe explosion in a single tank at Savannah River could release up to 
100 times the strontium-90 and cesium-137 that descended on the area around 
Kyshtym. Should that occur, large portions of South Carolina and Georgia may 
have to be evacuated and essentially written off for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the department commissioned a study of the explosive potential of the 
mixture resulting from the chemical treatment applied at Hanford in the 1950s. 
It disregarded the results of that study. Indeed, the Energy Department's own 
five-year waste-management plan does not even mention the possibility of a tank 
explosion at Hanford. Despite the promises of Energy Secretary James D. 
Watkins, this lack of scientific integrity is so institutionalized in the 
department that it cannot bring itself to address, much less redress, some of 
the most pressing and dangerous issues of radioactive-waste management. 
</P>
<P>
An independent agency must be created to manage the radioactive waste generated 
at nuclear facilities. Failing that, independent oversight and peer review of 
all Energy Department efforts in the field of waste management must be 
established.

   An Energy Department laboratory in Tennessee
lost a significant amount of radioactive tritium in a test shipment
between lab buildings, raising the possibility of foul play,
government records show.
   Ironically, the secret test was done as part of an internal
investigation into troubling discrepancies in the amount of tritium
shipped from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory at Oak Ridge, Tenn.,
to commercial buyers in recent years.
   Tritium supplies are classified by the government. The material
is produced in Energy Department reactors in South Carolina for use
in nuclear warheads, although small amounts are sold to domestic
and foreign companies. Commercial uses include the manufacture of
luminous lights and biological and energy research.
   No acceptable explanation could be found for the tritium lost in
the test shipment last year, according to an Oak Ridge report
released Wednesday by the Energy Department in response to a
Freedom of Information Act request by The Associated Press.
   The report, dated July 20, raised the possibility of theft but
said this could not be substantiated.
   Jim Alexander, an Oak Ridge spokesman, said Wednesday he did not
know whether the tritium in the test shipment has been recovered.
He said efforts to resolve the discrepancies in commercial
shipments dating back to 1985 were continuing.
   Based on information in the Oak Ridge investigation report, it
appeared about 2 grams of tritium were lost in the shipment between
lab buildings. That is about half the amount used in a single
nuclear warhead, according to private analysts.
   The lab is operated by Martin Marietta Energy Systems Inc. under
an Energy Department contract.
   Commercial shipments from Oak Ridge were suspended in July while
a joint team of experts from the Energy Department and the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission conducted an investigation. This group
reported on July 28 that it could not explain the discrepancies in
the commercial shipments, which amounted to about 5 grams.
   In August the department said it was resuming most shipments and
that it was reasonably sure the missing tritium had not been
diverted to making illicit nuclear weapons.
   The 2 grams of tritium lost in the test shipments was in
addition to the 5 grams missing from commercial sales.
   An internal Martin Marietta memorandum dated Jan. 16, 1989,
indicated that efforts to find the lost 2 grams of tritium were
delayed because one of the buildings involved in the test shipment
was shut down due to an ``unusual occurrence report.''
   The memo was released as an attachment to the Oak Ridge study.
It did not elaborate on the ``unusual occurrence'' but said
``corrective actions'' were under way.
   The tritium mystery began Aug. 11, 1988, when, as part of Oak
Ridge's attempt to find explanations for a series of commercial
shipment discrepancies, the lab loaded 28,615 curies of tritium _ a
little over 2.5 grams _ into a shipping container at one building
and sent it to another. The idea was to prove tritium could be
loaded and removed in a pure form.
   A curie is a standard measure of radioactivity.
   Some of the tritium was unloaded at the second building to take
samples, as planned. It was then reloaded and the entire container
sent back to the first building. This was done over a three-month
period. When the container was unloaded at its final destination
Nov. 14, 1988, only 6,364 curies of tritium were left, the report
said.
   This meant that about three-quarters of the original shipment _
or 2 grams of tritium _ was gone.
   The investigators said they could not find a solid explanation
for the disappearance. They found no evidence that the tritium was
released into a ventilation stack at either of the buildings, nor
that an incorrect amount of tritium was loaded into the container.
   They also dismissed the possibility that the container leaked.
   Another possible explanation was that another container loaded
with a smaller amount was inadvertently switched with the test
container. Investigators said this was unlikely, but that the
possibility would be checked further.

Eastern correspondent: ``The Eastern Shore Is Still 
Inhabited...'' 
  [Text] 
  Russia's Pacific coast is threatened by a general 
environmental disaster. Freighters and nuclear submarines 
belonging to the Pacific Fleet and loaded with liquid 
radioactive wastes are docked at seaports in the Far Eastern 
region. Furthermore, some of the vessels are in a dangerously 
dilapidated condition. The situation is extremely hazardous, and 
at this time there is no solution to the problem. That was the 
announcement made a few days ago by Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, 
administration chief of Maritime Kray. 
<H5>  MN Dossier </H5>
  There are only 10 areas in the Far Eastern seas where 
radioactive waste (both liquid and solid) is dumped. Just one of 
these, located in the Sea of Japan 105 nautical miles from 
Vladivostok, 80 miles from Nakhodka and 295 miles from Hokkaido, 
has over the past 20 years been the dump site for more than 
33,000 cubic meters of liquid radioactive wastes with a total 
radioactivity of 10,842 curies. In addition, 9,846 cubic meters 
of solid radioactive waste with a total radioactivity of 2,230 
curies has also been dumped there. At the same site the sea 
floor at a depth of 3,250-3,700 meters is littered with 1,689 
containers and 18 vessels filled with solid radioactive waste 
taken from the power units of nuclear submarines, five steam 
generators and 21 circulating pumps, which are not even in any 
sort of container whatsoever. 
  For many years the Pacific Fleet dealt with radioactive 
waste 
quite simply: it was all dumped at sea. After a recent 
international scandal in which daring members of the omnipresent 
Greenpeace organization located and announced to the whole world 
radioactive dumping by a Russian freighter in the Sea of Japan, 
central agencies have decreed an end to such operations. The 
extremely polluted Far Eastern seas, which are being turned into 
a radioactive dump, got a respite. Liquid radioactive waste is 
now being stored on shore. No one knows what to do with it. 
  The people of the Far East have been put in a difficult 
situation before by the military units based in their region. 
One need only recall the numerous accidents at sea and on land 
for which the Pacific Fleet has been responsible. Three years 
ago the fleet command attempted to carry out an unprecedented 
operation in Postovaya Bay near Sovetskaya Gavan: disassembly of 
reactors on board outdated nuclear submarines mothballed there. 
On orders from Admiral Gennadiy Khvatov, Pacific Fleet 
commander, the complex task of removing the reactors' 
radioactive nuclear fuel-containing cores -- a task that 
requires trained specialists and special conditions -- was to be 
carried out by the local garrison. But the sailors had never 
done that kind of work before, and the bay was not specially 
equipped for the job. The residents of Sovetskaya Gavan and the 
town of Vanino learned of the planned secret operation by 
chance. It cost them a great deal of effort to stop the military 
from going ahead with the operation. 
  Now there has been another emergency. The defenders of our 
maritime borders cannot utilize liquid radioactive waste, the 
inevitable by-product of nuclear submarine fleet operations. At 
any moment the coastline and all its inhabitants could take a 
drink of that waste. As they expanded the nuclear might of the 
Pacific Fleet military experts gave no thought to safe means of 
utilizing wastes and disassembling decommissioned submarines. 
Local residents' health and very lives were not taken into 
account. 
  Many very beautiful bays and gulfs along the Russian Pacific 
coast have long been inaccessible to people. They are literally 
occupied by military units. Crammed beyond all measure with 
military equipment, unique natural sites are a depressing sight. 
In some places decommissioned submarines have been sitting at 
anchor, aging, for years. Yet experts warn that decommissioned 
submarines should be decontaminated and components utilized 
immediately. Everything that presents a danger should be 
disassembled without delay and disposed of properly. After time 
has passed it is not only difficult to carry out such 
operations, but, depending on the technology, sometimes 
impossible. If, of course, the appropriate safety procedures are 
taken... 
  The creation of the Pacific Fleet, the largest and most 
powerful in the world, cost our country a tremendous amount. Now 
more substantial expenditures will be required to halt the 
destructive effect of this monster on our lives. Thus far the 
Russian Government neither sees nor hears this problem at all. 
  But the Americans have responded. Watching with alarm the 
Russian Far East, their troubled neighbor in the Pacific region, 
they have now become seriously worried. The Bablock-Wilcox 
Company, which specializes in supplying nuclear energy equipment 
to the U.S. Navy, has expressed a willingness to provide our 
navy with the most modern technology for the neutralization of 
radioactive wastes and utilization of nuclear submarines. Donald 
Ray, a company representative who visited Vladivostok a few days 
ago, reported that the U.S. Government, which supports the 
Bablock-Wilcox initiative, plans to allocate $10 million to 
implement it. Japanese specialists are also working on a program 
to help Russia set up special storage facilities for its nuclear 
materials. 
  Our military circles have always been very wary of advice 
from outsiders, particularly when it comes to foreign advisors, 
and they react very negatively to any interference in the area 
of their interests. However, today it appears that there is no 
other option than to cooperate with anyone who expresses a 
desire to help. 
  Russia's eastern shore is in great distress. It would appear 
that it is there that humanity has come to the final frontier, 
beyond which there lies nothing.

<LEADPARA>  PARTICIPANTS FROM the United States, the Soviet Union and Britain met recnetly
at the National War College for an annual discussion of security concerns.;   
Most of the topics were the expected fare: military reform in the Soviet
Union, security implications of the struggle between the union and the
republics and strategies for converting the defense establishment to the
civilian economy. Sandwiched among these was one surprise -- a session devoted
to "The Environmental Dimension of Security." The subject was introduced a
trifle apologetically by the American chairman, who feared his colleagues
might find the subject "soft."  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST POLLUTION  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Jessica Mathews, vice president of World Resources Institute, wrote this
article for the Washington Post.
Commentary  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The Americans did seem to find the topic far removed from their concerns.
They had little to contribute.;    The Russians, on the other hand, leaped to
the discussion with enthusiasm. Though they have more immediate worries --
their country's survival and the role of its military being more than a little
uncertain -- they have no difficulty accepting direct linkage of the words
"environment" and "security.";    Environmental trends;  For more than 40
years, national security for our two countries was defined strictly in terms
of the other's military capability and intentions. The term has since
broadened. Reflecting the importance of economic strength, the United States
created the post of undersecretary of state for economic affairs and a
comparable office on the National Security Council staff in the 1970s.;   
Much more recently, the contribution of environmental trends has begun to be
discussed outside -- but not inside -- the national security establishment. In
this respect, thinking (though not management) in the Soviet Union has
progressed further than it has here.;    One reason is that environmental
conditions in the Soviet Union's one-sixth of the planet are so appalling that
no one needs to explain the nature of the threats or the national interests
that are at stake. Some of them were described at the War College by Boris
Porfiriev of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.;    Nuclear contamination figures
prominently, beginning with the still mysterious accident at Kyshtym. Unknown
in the West for 20 years, the explosion's cause and consequences are still
unclear, though large amounts of radioactivity were released, thousands
evacuated and land permanently removed from production.;    Much worse was the
chronic dumping of radioactive waste in nearby Chelyabinsk at the site of the
USSR's first plutonium production facility. Over the years, vast amounts of
radioactivity -- more than 1 billion curies -- were released directly into
surrounding rivers and lakes. These connect with the Ob River basin, whose
waters may be spreading an environmental disaster over a much larger
territory.;    Chernobyl;  And then, of course, there is Chernobyl.;    Even
for this Gorbachev-era, non-military accident, the facts are elusive.
Porfiriev puts the number of those living in contaminated areas at 4 million,
much more than previous surveys. Five years later, the toll in polluted land,
cancers and radiation disease is still rising. Evacuations of more than
100,000 additional people are expected, and more than half a million people
are under permanent medical observation.;    Major Gen. I. Danilenko described
visiting the village where he grew up, which lies just outside the
30-kilometer evacuated radius around the plant. Villagers receive what the
bureaucrats call an "economic incentive" to stay there. They call it
"graveyard money.";    Even so, radioactivity is probably the least of the
Soviet Union's environmental woes. Industrial pollution is endemic. The
distinguished biologist A.V. Yablokov classifies 15 to 20 regions, in which
more than half of the USSR's population lives, as environmental crisis areas.;
   "Every third man in those regions has a cancer . . . and the average life
expectancy is four to eight years shorter than in the developed countries.";  
 Soil destruction;  Worst of all in long-term economic costs may be the
mismanagement and destruction of agricultural soils. The country's richest
prairie-like soils have lost half of their natural productivity. Erosion is
rampant.;    Major fisheries have been destroyed. Pesticide poisoning is
widespread. The list goes on and on, and all of today's sketchy statistics are
probably underestimates.;    That said, Porfiriev calculates that the cost of
pollution and natural resource degradation, including health costs but not
victim compensation, amounts to 15 to 17 percent of GNP.;    This is roughly
equal to, or perhaps greater than, the Soviet Union's disputed defense budget.
(The United States spends 12 percent of its GNP on health and 13 percent on
energy.) While I found Porfiriev's estimate to be staggering, none of the
Russians seemed surprised by it. Those I asked guessed it was too low.;   
Russians also have had more direct exposure than we to the transnational and
global environmental ills that cross militarily defended borders with
impunity. Because of how the winds blow, the Soviet Union is on the receiving
end of more air pollution than it exports. As any Canadian will tell you, in
the United States it is the reverse.;    Redefining U.S. national security
without the Soviet threat as its organizing principle is proving to be
difficult.;    We have no consensus yet on what our essential interests are,
and threats without enemies behind them don't seem very threatening. As the
national debate proceeds, we may find that we have something to learn from the
Russians, though it comes at a tragic cost to them and possibly to the world.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Contents Of Storage Tanks At Nuclear Reservation Sometimes A
Mystery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is a potentially explosive witches'
brew cooking inside 177 nuclear waste storage tanks at the Hanford
nuclear reservation.
   Surrounded by steel and concrete, buried under several feet of
earth, and roasting at temperatures of 140 degrees, the radioactive
slurry changes in ways that scientists cannot always predict.
   Scientists working for the U.S. Department of Energy concluded
that hydrogen gas trapped beneath the hard crust of the waste in 20
of the tanks could explode, releasing up to 3 million curies of
radiation from a single tank.
   The wastes are generated by nuclear weapons production.
   Hanford was created as part of the Manhattan Project to beat
Nazi Germany to the atomic bomb during World War II. The Department
of Energy, in a cost-cutting move, recently announced it is
shutting down the only federal reactor still operating in the
south-central Washington town.
   ``We've got good data on what went into those tanks,'' Don
Wodrich, a scientist with contractor Westinghouse Hanford Co., said
last week. ``But over the years, it blended together and mixed. Now
it's more complicated.''
   The insides of the tanks are far too lethal for human entry. All
scientists can do is monitor the temperature and vapors escaping
through filtered vents, and occasionally send a probe into the guck.
   But probes of the 20 suspect tanks have been stopped, because
scientists fear a spark could trigger an explosion.
   The explosion potential was announced March 23, along with a
unique admission that DOE really isn't sure how dangerous the
situation is. The agency said it will take until June to come up
with a solution plan.
   That has prompted criticism from Congress and a citizens'
watchdog group, who contend the department knew about the danger
years ago.
   The Energy Department have stated repeatedly that the explosion
risk is low, although they will not have a safety analysis
completed for two weeks.
   Spokesman Ken Morgan has said there is more danger to the public
from a gasoline truck than from the tanks, and called the
controversy the ``cold fusion'' of disasters, referring to the
highly disputed claim that the nuclear process known as fusion can
be created in an ordinary laboratory.
   That attitude infuriates Hanford critics.
   ``They don't fully accept their responsibility to protect public
health and safety,'' said Jim Thomas of the Hanford Education
Action League in Spokane. ``They should have been doing risk
analysis on this stuff years ago.''
   Energy Department officials insisted last week they became aware
of the explosion potential only in February, even though they
detected hydrogen in the wastes as early as 1983.
   Hanford Manager Mike Lawrence, in announcing the problem, said
he had become aware of the danger only the day before. If that is
the case, said Thomas, then Hanford apparently has major management
problems.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said a study prepared for the Energy
Department in June 1985 warned of potential problems with gases in
some Hanford tanks. That report examined only the liquid and solid
waste in the tanks, but said the gases should be addressed in
another study.
   Wyden said the 1985 report ``seems to contradict this whole
notion that the Energy Department didn't know anything about it.''
   The 1985 hydrogen study was a companion to another study on
whether ferrocyanide in some tanks could explode. The ferrocyanide
report was leaked to reporters last October.
   Under criticism for its handling of that issue, the Energy
Department decided to take a broader look at the explosion
potential in all Hanford tanks, and scientists discovered the
hydrogen problem in late February, scientist Wodrich said.
   The explosion threat is apparently not similar to the presumed
cause of a nuclear waste storage tank explosion in the Soviet Union
in 1957 that may have killed hundreds.
   Al Conklin of the state Office of Radiation Protection said the
Soviet explosion involved a different mixture of chemicals and a
lengthy breakdown of the tank's cooling system.
   The DOE is most concerned about one tank, called 101-SY, that
contains 1 million gallons of mixed radioactive waste. Some wastes
dumped into the tank in the 1970s contained organics, which are now
decomposing and giving off hydrogen gas. The organics were used to
separate radioactive strontium from other wastes before they were
stored.
   The most dangerous gases are those trapped in air pockets under
the hard crust. Scientists are unsure how much gas is beneath the
waste, although they credit the gas with raising the waste level by
up to 33 inches.
   Wodrich said DOE officials are confident the explosion risk is
low because the hydrogen gas has apparently existed in the waste
for years, and that new precautions are being taken to prevent an
explosion.
   In a briefing for state regulators, Wodrich said tank 101-SY was
completed in 1976 and is 75 feet in diameter and 35 feet tall. The
double-walled tank contains about 32 feet of waste.
   The tank also contains 8,000 gallons of water inserted in
1984-1988, when DOE made an unsuccessful attempt to reduce the gas
buildup by breaking through the crust. The crust develops from the
drying of the wastes.

<HEAD>Government Ignored Secret Pleas for Cancer Studies at Arms Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The agency that ran nuclear weapons production
in the 1940s rejected secret advice to study cancer risks for its
workers, even though it knew some were exposed to large doses of
radiation, documents show.
   Records of the Atomic Energy Commission also show that airborne
emissions of radiation continued at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation
in Washington state from the plant's start-up in 1944 until at
least the mid-1950s.
   The AEC was a predecessor to the Energy Department, which owns
all the government's nuclear arms factories.
   The government first acknowledged the Hanford problems publicly
in 1986, although much information about radiation releases there
is still classified as secret.
   On Thursday, a panel of health experts disclosed that one in 20
residents living near Hanford, on the Columbia River near Richland,
Wash., between late 1944 and December 1947 absorbed a level of
radiation equal to 1,200 times what the Energy Department now
considers a safe limit.
   The panel of independent health specialists said the releases of
radioactive iodine _ a byproduct of extracting plutonium from
uranium _ were serious enough to justify a study of potential
illnesses or deaths related to the emissions.
   The release of the report marked the first time the government
has publicly acknowledged that radiation releases from its nuclear
arms factories could have harmed human health.
   Yet the government was made aware shortly after the Hanford
plant began operating in September 1944 that airborne contaminants
posed serious health risks.
   In a March 1948 report, the radiation health and safety chief at
Hanford wrote that emissions of radioactive particles from the
plant's plutonium-processing buildings ``can produce radiation
damage.'' He also said that ``the theoretical possibility of injury
developing 10 to 15 years from now poses a serious problem.''
   The Atomic Energy Commission rejected a recommendation by its
biology and medicine advisory panel in early 1949 that studies be
conducted on possible links between cancer and Hanford workers'
exposure to radiation, AEC records show.
   The AEC records were cited in a December 1989 report by the
Democratic majority staff of the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee that recommended the Energy Department make public more
of its long-secret data on radiation releases at Hanford.
   The latest government admission of potential health hazards to
people near Hanford is part of an evolution of openness about
nuclear weapons operations.
   In a 1945 government report that revealed the existence of the
once-secret Hanford and other plants, an Army official involved in
the project wrote: ``Factors of safety used in plant design and
operation are so great that the hazards of the home and the family
car are far greater for the personnel than any arising from the
plants.''
   Gene Plock, who worked as an engineer at Hanford's
plutonium-processing buildings from 1946 to 1950, said in an
interview Friday that he and others in his work crew were informed
of the emissions problem in late 1946 _ months after it was
discovered by General Electric Co., which ran Hanford under a
government contract.
   Plock said he and some other workers then began wearing
protective masks.
   He said he recommended that military guards outside the building
also be informed, and that they be required to wear protective
masks. He said GE rejected his suggestion.
   ``Their response was, `No, let's not alarm them,''' he said.
   The Hanford study released Thursday contains the most specific
information known to the public about radiation releases at that
facility. Yet it tells only part of the story of accidental and
intentional emissions of radiation from Hanford.
   In addition to the radioactive iodine, significant amounts of
plutonium particles, ruthenium, americium and other potentially
cancer-causing products were released from processing stacks on the
560-square-mile plant in 1940s and '50s, according to AEC records.

From the Press Bulletin Issued in the Third Quarter"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Condition of the Atmosphere </H5>
  During this quarter it was observed that the atmosphere was 
polluted in Leninogorsk City in particular. This was connected 
with pollution by nonferrous metal industries and the occurrence 
of climatic conditions unfavorable for the dispersal of the 
city's air mass. 
  Dust: there was a great deal of dust in the air in Aqtaw 
City 
in particular. It was four times greater than permitted levels. 
At the same time, the amount of airborne dust was three times 
above permitted levels in the cities of Zyryan and Shymkent. In 
comparison to the third quarter of last year, there was no 
appreciable change during the third quarter of this year in 
conditions in these cities other than the accumulation of a 
great deal of dust in Aqtaw City. The administration of Aqtaw 
City is devoting attention to these facts and will carry out 
measures to prevent dust from spreading in the city. 
  Sulfur dioxide: This harmful substance is above permitted 
levels in Leninogorsk City (2.5 times), Oskemen City (two times) 
and Balqash City (1.5 times). By comparison with the third 
quarter of last year, it has been observed that sulfur dioxide 
has decreased in the air of Leninogorsk City. There have no 
appreciable changes in the other cities. 
  Carbon dioxide: in as much as it has accumulated at moderate 
levels, this harmful substance is not above permitted levels in 
Kazakhstan cities. It is at permitted levels in Petropavlovsk, 
Semey, and Oskemen cities where concentrations are greatest. By 
comparison with the third quarter of last year, heavy 
concentrations were observed in Semey City. There were no 
changes in the other cities. 
  Nitrogen dioxide: in half of the cities tested, levels of 
concentration were equal or less than permitted levels. The 
areas where concentrations were greatest were Oskemen City (1.8 
times above permitted levels), Almaty City, and Aktobe City 
(both 1.5 times greater). By comparison with the third quarter 
of 1992, the level of air pollution by nitrogen dioxide had 
increased in Oskemen but decreased in Pavlodar. The other cities 
remained unchanged. 
  Nitrogen oxide: Levels of this dangerous substance were 
noted 
in 10 Kazakh cities. On the average, levels of concentration 
were not above permitted levels. It was most concentrated in 
Oskemen City and levels there were about 70 percent of permitted 
levels. By comparison with the third quarter of last year, 
nitrogen oxide concentrations increased in Almaty, but decreased 
in Zhambyl. Quantities in other cities remained unchanged. 
  Phenol: this harmful substances was also observed in 10 
Kazakhstan cities. In Leninogorsk City it was four times above 
permitted levels, and three times in Temirtaw. Average amounts 
accumulating in Oskemen, Almaty, Zyryan, Qaraghandy, 
Petropavlovsk, and Semey were one-two times above permitted 
levels although concentrations in Pavlodar were at permitted 
levels. By comparison with the third quarter of 1992, phenol 
concentration levels had risen in Oskemen, Semey, and 
Qaraghandy, but there were no appreciable changes in other 
cities. 
  Formaldehyde: it was found in the air of nine cities. It was 
determined that in Zhezqazghan, Leninogorsk, and Almaty 
concentrations were six times above norms (permitted levels). 
Concentrations in Qaraghandy, Aqtobe, Zyryan, Oskemen, and 
Shymkent were four-five times above norms. In Petropavlovsk 
concentrations were twice norms. By comparison to the third 
quarter of last year, formaldehyde concentrations increased in 
Almaty, Zhezqazghan, Qaraghandy, and Oskemen and decreased in 
Zyryan and Leninogorsk. 
  Ammonia: this was observed in five cities. Shymkent was the 
city with the highest concentration, 3.5 times above norms. 
Aqtaw, Zhambyl, Qostanay, and Temirtaw were more or less at norm 
levels. By comparison to the third quarter of 1992, ammonia 
concentrations increased in Shymkent but decreased in Temirtaw. 
  Hydrogen floride: average concentrations of this substance 
were two times above norms in Aqmola City. Concentrations were 
at permitted levels in Zhambyl and Shymkent. By comparison to 
the third quarter of 1992, concentrations were up in Aqmola 
while concentrations were on the decline in Zhambyl. 
  Arsenic: concentrations in Leninogorsk and Oskemen equaled 
norms. 
  Chlorine: chlorine concentrations were not above permitted 
levels in Pavlodar, Oskemen, and Shymkent. 
  Pollution by airborne metals such as cadmium, nickel, 
copper, 
lead, and zinc was determined in 13 cities. In just Shymkent 
alone, lead concentrations were 1.5 times above norms. By 
comparison with the third quarter of last year, a decrease in 
lead pollution was observed in Balqash and Leninogorsk. 
Quantities of copper, nickel, cadmium and zinc in the air were 
at public health levels in all cities. 
<H5>  Water Pollution Levels </H5>
  Research carried out by units of the Kazakh Bureau of 
Climatic Research have shown that in the third quarter of the 
year water was primarily polluted with nitrogen and nitrates, 
oil products, metals (copper and zinc), and phenol. The quality 
of water in the Zhayyq [Ural], Nura, Ile, and Qaratal basins had 
improved compared to the same period last year. However, water 
pollution had become worse in a few places. The Yelek river in 
the vicinity of Algha City was polluted between the fourth and 
the sixth class; that is, it was considered very polluted. The 
flow of the Sherubay and Nura was polluted between the fourth to 
the fifth class. It was observed that water quality in Lake 
Balqash, in the Yertis Canyon, and in Toranghylyq strait of 
Syrdariya had deteriorated considerably. 
  It was not observed in the third quarter that the waters of 
the Zhayyq, the Syrdariya, Shu, Talas, Ile, Qaratal, Nura, 
Sarysu, Tobyl, and Yesil river basins and Lake Balqash were 
polluted above acceptable levels. 
  Facts regarding the pollution of water in the basin of the 
Yertis River were not presented in the third quarter. Due to 
fuel shortage, an analysis of its water chemistry was made at 
the end of the month but there has been not time to analyze the 
materials. 
<H5>  Radioactivity </H5>
  Radiation near natural sources in Kazakhstan was nine-15 
microcuries per hour, and 20-60 microcuries per hour at places 
where there were major layers on cliffs. Increased radiation was 
observed in Kokshetaw Oblast. There are a number of natural 
sources of Uranium there. 
  Contributing to the increase of radiation in Kazakhstan were 
the effects of nuclear tests carried out in Kazakhstan, the 
industrial activities, the Selebe and Chernobyl disasters, and 
the Lobnur Testing Area in China. At the same time radiation was 
connected with precipitation. 
  Since 1949 there were 510 nuclear explosions in Kazakhstan. 
Some 470 were in the Semey Testing Area, eight at Kapustin Yar 
(Ed.: according to other information it has been proved that 
there were 11 tests at Kapustin Yar, that is in the Oral Area), 
one in Aqtobe, 17 in Atyraw (at the Azghyr Testing Area), 17 in 
Aqmola, seven in Western Kazakhstan Oblast (Ed.: one may add in 
the above eight), three in Mangghystaw, three in Shymkent, one 
in Qostanay. The combined power of these explosions, that is 
radioactivity, was 12.9 million curies. Most of this was 
concentrated in the center (epicenter) of the explosions. We are 
currently researching the effects of this radioactivity on the 
environment. 
  It is possible that the technical activities of various 
industries spread radioactive pollution into the environment as 
well. For example, judging from preliminary information, uranium 
production and processing industries have accumulated 419 
million tons (252,000 curies) of radioactive waste. There are 
1.6 million tons (500 curies) in mining industries not producing 
uranium. It is estimated that there are 11.4 thousand units 
(32.6 thousand curies) in industries utilizing products produced 
by the "Izotop" Production Union and 12.3 million tons (12000 
thousand curies) of waste products at energy and experimental 
reactors. Based upon preliminary data, the total amount of 
radioactive waste is 233 million tons with a total radioactivity 
of 13 million curies. 
  Leaving aside nuclear explosions on the surface and in the 
air, highly radioactive substances producing 0.03-700 roentgens 
per hour have been lost and have remained unknown. It is well 
known that such sources were found in 1990 in Almaty and 
Qzylorda. They were found in 1991 at Almaty and in Kokshetaw, 
and in 1992 in Mangghystaw, at the "Ozenmunay" fence (not one 
group but four). Similar radioactive materials have been stolen 
from an oil plant in Atyraw Oblast. There has been observed 
contamination from radioactive sources due to the disintegration 
of storage containers at the Belogor Combine, at the Qaraghandy 
Metallurgical Combine, at the Mangghystaw Expedition. The fact 
that industrial radioactive substances used by oil producing 
plants have been turned over to the people, and that we have 
lost control over them, is extremely dangerous. Such pipes and 
hoses have been used at the "Khimik" and "Qurylysshy" companies 
in Mangghystaw Oblast, at the 58th Mobile Column of the Northern 
Kazakhstan Oblast Water Administration, and by garden crop 
producers in the area of Oskemen City. At the same time, it is 
well known that radioactive equipment was used on 40 occasions 
at the Zhanga Ozen fields, and on 21 occasions at the Zhetibay 
fields. The Republic of Kazakhstan chief procurator is looking 
into the fact that radioactive pipes were given to Taldyqorghan 
Oblast in 1992. 
  Dear reader! If you read this, you must be careful about 
receiving and using whatever you receive, from wherever it comes. 
<H5>  Now What About Our Food and Drink? </H5>
  State sanitary control organs in our republic have continued 
to test specially certified products (i.e., products having 
special permission) to prevent the spread of pesticides and 
nitrates into the environment and likewise to prevent harm to 
human health. Official services are carrying out an internal 
control (veterinarial, in the markets, botanical protection and 
planning-research stations in the fields). 
  Looking at some facts: contamination of food products with 
pesticides during the third quarter of 1993 increased somewhat 
(0.9 percent) over the same period last year. Pesticide residues 
were above republic averages in Kokshetaw and Taldyqorghan 
oblasts (respectively 5.4 and 4.6 percent). Pesticide residues 
have increased in milk products. It is alarming that harmful 
substances in milk products brought to factories in Almaty City 
from Almaty Oblast have not decreased. 
  Pollution of plant agricultural products prepared as food 
has 
remained unchanged. The figure was 3.2 percent for the third 
quarter of this year for the entire republic (compared to 3.1 
percent for the third quarter last year). This indicator is 
higher than the republic average in Northern Kazakhstan Oblast, 
10.5 percent, in Qyzylorda, 9.4 percent, in Eastern Kazakhstan 
Oblast, 8.2 percent, and in Aqtobe Oblast, 5.6 percent. Nitrates 
were especially noticeable in Zhambyl, Aqtobe, Eastern 
Kazakhstan, Northern Kazakhstan, Qaraghandy, and Kokshetaw 
Oblasts. 
<H5>  Some Measures To Protect the Environment </H5>
  Harmful substances issued into the air are decreasing 
primarily due to the decline of industrial production. On the 
other hand, they are increasing in Zhezqazghan, Pavlodar, and 
Almaty Oblasts. Since, during the nine months of the present 
year, the "Balqashmys" Production Union and the 
"Zhezqazghantustimetall" Corporation produced 83.2 thousand 
tonnes of pollution above what was allowed, the chief state 
inspector of the Republic made the decision to stop work at 
"Balqashmys" from 1 July. Only since then have the interested 
parties devoted attention to the problem of the processing of 
sulfur anhydrides and halting the production of pollution above 
norms. A fine of 3 billion rubles has been levied on the 
industry and 1.8 billion rubles has been paid. A complaint has 
been made to the government and to the Republic procurator's 
office. 
  The Shymkent lead plant has violated laws on the protection 
of the atmosphere. (As a result sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid 
vapor have increased excessively in the small Qazyghurt Rayon of 
Shymkent City.) The responsible workers have been punished and a 
fine has been imposed on them. The fact that the public raised 
the alarm allowed measures to be taken against the "Silikat" 
Corporation in Semey City. Since rubber was used to heat bitumen 
in the residential rayons of Oskemen City (when roofs were being 
tarred), the quality of the rayon worsened considerably. This 
method was prohibited at the request of the oblast environmental 
administration. 
  We note that in the process of testing measures were taken 
to 
reduce the issuing of harmful substances into the air at the 
Pavlodar Reinforced Concrete Plant, at Almaty Healing Center No 
1, at the Qaraghandy Metallurgical Combine, etc. 
  However, planned measures and the demands of inspectors were 
not always carried out. Work was ordered stopped at the 
Leninogor Polymetal Corporation on 21 September due to violation 
of environmental laws but this order was not carried out. The 
affair is now being prepared for prosecution by the procurator's 
office. 
  Land is being ruined, polluted, and mineralized in our 
republic. The Shalqar Agricultural Union in Aqmola Oblast has 
dumped trash wherever it wants. The "Aqtobemunay" Union has 
dumped residual fuel at drilling sites. The Qostanay 
Administration for Mechanized Work has obtained soil without 
permission; industrial wastes have been dumped on fertile land 
in Bozvyshen Rayon of Northern Kazakhstan Oblast, etc., etc. 
Fines have been levied as measures against violation of law. 
  Republic cities and urban settlements are still not 
adequately equipped with plumbing. Reservoirs to collect 
drainage water in Oral, Petropavlovsk, Qostanay, Zhambyl, and 
Pavlodar (Bylqyldaq) are overfull. Measures have not been taken 
by the Ministry of Energy and of the Fuel Industry to process 
drainage water at Ekibastuz, and at the Leninogor Thermo-center. 
For these and other deficiencies, the Qaraghandy No 1 Machinery 
Factory, the Taldyqorghan Kazakh-German Union (hide processing) 
Industry and others have been halted. Moreover, the case of the 
chief engineer at the Aqtobe Chrome Fittings Factory has been 
turned over to the procurator's office. 
  There has been no control exercised over the placement of 
wastes in Zhezqazghan, Pavlodar, Qyzylorda, Kokshetaw, Semey, 
and Eastern Kazakhstan Oblasts. 
  On 14 July, 1993, the Cabinet of Ministers issued a 
resolution on "Development of State Resources and National Parks 
in the Republic of Kazakhstan." According to this resolution, 
funds are to be allotted to them and facilitations for workers 
at natural reserves are foreseen. 
  The Ministry for the Environmental and Biological Resources 
has drawn up a "Scheme for the Development and Disposition of 
Republic of Kazakhstan Natural Reserve Resource Projects During 
the Period Up Until the Year 2005" and the scheme has been 
turned over to the Cabinet of Ministers. 
  Chiefs of oblast governments, in collaboration with the 
Ministry of the Environment, have been given until 1 January, 
1994 to produce other organizations out of reserves and national 
parks.

<HEAD>Hospital Believes Crate with Radiation Sent to Netherlands</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: new material throughout with crate thought to have been sent
back to Netherlands.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials at Georgetown University Hospital
believe missing radioactive material taken from the hospital was
sent back to the Netherlands, a spokeswoman said today.
   The hospital had been trying to locate a crate containing a
potentially fatal dose of radioactive iridium it believed was
accidentally taken from the hospital.
   But hospital spokeswoman Carol Fox said today that officials
found some documents on Wednesday that indicated the missing
radioactive material was picked up by the manufacturer on April 20.
   She said the paperwork indicated that the iridium had been sent
back to the Netherlands where it was supposed to have been returned.
   The hospital will be in contact with the manufacturer and hopes
to be able to confirm later today that the shipment is safe and on
track, King said.
   The radioactive iridium was protected by a blue, steel-jacketed
lead shield and is braced to keep it in the center of the crate.
   ``Assuming the source is still contained in the lead shield and
still packaged inside the crate, radiation exposure rates should be
minimal,'' said a hospital statement released Wednesday. ``If,
however, the source has been removed from the shielding, it
presents a potentially serious, possibly fatal, risk to anyone who
may handle it.''.
   The hospital said earlier the iridium was believed taken by a
courier on April 20 and a Georgetown radiation control officer
discovered what was believed to be a mistake 10 days later.
   The hospital notified the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that a
search for the crate failed.
   The square 18-inch crate bears a shipping label to Georgetown
University Hospital.
   The label on the crate also reads, ``Caution: Radioactive.
Handle Carefully, Iridium 192, 10 Curies, Transportation Index:
.6.''

<TEXT>     With this phase of our postwar history ended, the United States is now
tallying the cost. Ironically, Americans may have been the major victims. The
Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency recently
disclosed data on the handling of radioactive substances at nuclear weapons
facilities, especially plutonium production at Hanford, Wash.;    Radioactive
dumping;  The Hanford plant, besides contaminating the air, dumped radioactive
materials into the soil that ultimately reached the water supply, including
the Columbia River, where radioactive fish have been detected. The result was
that almost 250,000 people in Washington, Oregon and Idaho were exposed to
various forms of radioactive iodine, strontium-89, cesium-137 and other
radionuclides.;    Some children living downwind of the plant received
estimated thyroid radiation doses that can cause hypothyroidism and thyroid
cancer. Especially troubling is a recent disclosure that technetium-99 and
iodine-129 were found in soil samples. If you think Styrofoam boxes are a
problem, consider these radioisotopes, which will be around from 2 million to
160 million years.;    Making matters even worse is a recent Department of
Energy report that several radioactive-waste storage tanks at Hanford produce
combustible gases and pose an imminent risk of exploding. Similar problems are
thought to affect other nuclear weapons production, research and testing
facilities throughout the United States.;    The Department of Energy has
recently released data regarding radiation exposure to workers in nuclear
weapons plants and at test sites, affecting about 600,000 people. Other
civilian exposures occurred at or near sites in Washington, Nevada, Idaho,
Colorado, Georgia and Ohio.;    After 45 years, the burden of proof is
shifting from the victims to the government. As many as 2 million Americans
may have been exposed to radiation because of the nuclear arms race.;   
Certainly similar events have occurred in the Soviet Union. Claims of
radiation-related ill-health from Soviets living downwind of the Semipalatinsk
test site in Kazakhstan are remarkably similar to American "down-winders."
Also, the Soviet authorities recently released data confirming an explosion at
the Kyshtym nuclear waste storage site in the Urals in 1957; scores of towns
suddenly disappeared from official maps; a huge area remains contaminated. In
September, an explosion in a nuclear fuels plant at Ust-Kamenogorsk released
beryllium, a toxic non-radioactive chemical, over a large and densely
populated area.;    Solving the problems left by the nuclear arms race will
not be easy. Some estimates suggest that decontamination of nuclear weapons
production facilities and test sites and relocation of radioactive wastes may
require 10 to 20 years, with a cost exceeding $50 billion.;    But I believe
the most serious cost is further loss of credibility of the U.S. government in
nuclear issues. Americans feel betrayed. They feel they were exposed to health
risks in what they now perceive to have been a fruitless exercise. While this
notion is probably incorrect, it is impossible to prove that the nuclear arms
race was necessary to contain the Soviets, or that it ultimately led to the
collapse of communism.;    Public trust;  Can the government regain public
trust with these recent disclosures? Yes, but that is unlikely.;    Still, a
strategy might be to create a Cabinet-level department of nuclear affairs, to
oversee both military and peaceful applications, with close links to the
National Academies of Science and Engineering and other scientific
organizations.;    Such an agency might also help three important but flagging
projects: developing a next generation of advanced nuclear reactors, safe
disposal of high-level radioactive wastes and harnessing nuclear fusion.;   
This could help to restore public confidence in nuclear power, whose role in
global energy production might increase parallel to increasing concern
regarding global warming and use of fossil fuels.;    The Persian Gulf war
shows how dangerous is dependence on Middle East oil. Governmental direction
is badly needed.  </TEXT>

  [Abstract] An accident occurred at the Tomsk-7 
radiochemical plant on 6 April 1993. A container with 
approximately 20 m[.sup]3[/] exploded with the escape of 
uranium. A radioactive track with an area about 100 
km[.sup]2[/] was formed in the terrain. An initial 
reconnaissance was made for determining the general direction of 
transport and fallout of radioactive substances, followed on 
12-13 April by a detailed survey of the snow-covered terrain at 
1:100 000. The direction of the survey runs was virtually 
perpendicular to the axis of the radioactive track; each run was 
20 km long. A map shows the polluted area. The energy release of 
the radioactive products was estimated at 4700 R x 
km[.sup]2[/]/hour. The total quantity of radioactive products 
beyond the limits of the industrial site of the plant was 
estimated at 530-590 curies. It is shown that in the most 
polluted central part of the track with pollution levels 300 
R/hour or more the accumulated dose of gamma radiation from 
the radionuclides detected at the time of the survey 
(ruthenium-103, ruthenium-106, zirconium-95 and niobium-95) will 
not be more than 1 roentgen during the first year. During 
subsequent years there will be little gamma radiation from 
radioactive pollution. Figures 2.

<F P=106> [Ruslan Ignatyev report under the "Only in ROSSIYSKAYA </F>
GAZETA" rubric: "Sarcophagus for Submarine Komsomolets"] 
  [Text] Russian specialists and scientists have proposed a 
unique method of preserving the submarine Komsomolets which sank 
7 April 1989 in the Norwegian Sea approximately 180 miles 
southeast of Bear Island. Studies have been going on for 
several years, expeditions have been organized, and hundreds of 
options have been examined. As a result one option has been 
selected -- the best one. It involves the construction of a 
sort of sarcophagus. The Committee for Carrying Out 
Special-Purpose Underwater Operations has been tasked with 
coordinating the project. Its Chairman Tengiz Borisov 
familiarized the editorial office with this unusual project. 
  The nuclear submarine Komsomolets has now been lying on the 
bottom of the Norwegian Sea for almost five years. Today we can 
say that it was the pride of the former Soviet Union's Armed 
Forces. It was the only submarine of its kind in the world: 
The most up-to-date and most deep-water. The Komsomolets could 
dive to 1,000 meters, whereas an ordinary submarine could only 
go as far as 400 to 600 meters. The vessel had a multipurpose 
design. To use the language of military pilots, it could be 
deployed as a fighter and a ground-attack aircraft. The 
Komsomolets was to have destroyed missile-armed submarines and 
carrier strike groups composed of aircraft carriers and escort 
ships, and it could also direct long-range fire against onshore 
targets.... 
  This supersubmarine cost our state over 1 billion rubles at 
old prices (in present-day prices this is approximately 1 
trillion). However, the Komsomolets was in fact unable to serve 
the Motherland. During a routine patrol it caught fire and 
sank. A total of 20 conventional torpedoes and two fitted with 
nuclear warheads went down with it. The latter gave cause for 
concern because there was a danger they would contaminate the 
environment with radioactive substances. 
  The very first expeditions to the accident site confirmed 
the 
specialists' fears. The radiation situation in the vicinity was 
not good. A second set of studies backed up the previous 
findings with new information. In the final analysis, the 
situation at the site of the Komsomol wreck was such that all 
permissible norms had been exceeded many times over. This 
provoked a negative reaction from a number of countries. The 
decision was then made to raise the Komsomol. 
  A number of countries offered to help in formulating a plan 
to raise the submarine from the bottom of the Norwegian Sea. 
They included states such as the United States, France, Italy, 
and Sweden. Dozens of proposals were also put forward by our 
own scientists and designers. The special commission received 
plenty of interesting and promising options. For example, some 
specialists suggested using cryogenic technology. That is to 
say they planned to freeze the submarine and lift it in the form 
of a block of ice. Others insisted on dismembering the 
Komsomolets with a view to coaxing each part out of the watery 
depths separately. Still others sought a way out of the problem 
by using an enormous overhead crane. There were also, to put it 
mildly, one or two quite unrealistic plans. Thus some people 
tried to demonstrate that the vessel could be pumped full of a 
special foaming material which would turn into foam rubber and 
ensure the buoyancy of the submarine, which would then float to 
the surface of its own accord. Another very simple method would 
be to latch onto the Komsomolets with a kind of lasso and tow it 
toward the shore.... 
  Meanwhile the former USSR party leadership issued a decree 
tasking the appropriate organizations and departments with 
carrying out the work necessary to raise the sunken submarine. 
The aim was to establish the real reason for the wreck of the 
Komsomolets and to remove the torpedoes with nuclear charges. 
But there was a hitch, because the state lacked the funds to 
carry out an operation of this sort (at the time about $300 
million were needed). 
  However, expeditions to the bottom of the Norwegian Sea 
showed that it has also become impossible to raise the submarine 
from the technical point of view. This is why. 
  Using the manned deep-sea submersibles Mir-1 and Mir-2, it 
has proved possible to descend to the site of the sunken 
submarine. Here, at a depth of 1,700 meters, it is pitch black. 
The searchlights shining out of the portholes picked out a wall 
of "snow." It seemed as if a blizzard was raging at the bottom 
of the Norwegian Sea. Apparently there is a large accumulation 
of plankton in precisely this area. It hampered attempts to 
follow the planned route. The submersibles encountered a number 
of small and medium-sized fish along the way. 
  The specialists were able to determine the exact position of 
the submarine. It is lying atop a 40-meter-thick silt incline. 
Further on there is a precipice and an increase in depth. The 
Komsomolets is lying level on an even keel. The submarine's 
position encouraged the specialists to think that they could 
execute their plan to raise the vessel. 
  After a thorough examination of the submarine it became 
apparent that the inner hull was badly damaged. It has 
practically been blown in two in the vicinity of the forward 
compartment, even though the fire occurred in the stern. A 
study of video materials and a comparison of information 
obtained during the expedition showed that a powerful explosion 
had occurred on the vessel. This could have happened during the 
depressurization and flooding of the submarine or at the moment 
when it hit the bottom. This explosion damaged the submarine. 
  For the first time our specialists were able to go inside 
the 
Komsomolets using remote-control robots. A terrible picture 
unfolded before the investigators: Smashed flooring, decks, and 
all sorts of structures had formed massive obstructions. The 
submarine's systems, instruments, and equipment had been 
transformed into scrap metal. They were unable to find the 
bodies of any sailors. 
  Robots the size of large vacuum cleaners entered the 
Komsomolets through gaps in the hull and two open portholes. 
They reached the torpedo apparatus. They not only examined the 
forward cover assemblies enclosing the warheads, but also the 
tail sections of the torpedoes. The conclusions drawn by the 
specialists were very sorry indeed; the beryllium screens -- the 
neutron deflectors which are a design feature of the warheads 
and which prevent the plutonium from spreading -- were heavily 
corroded and partially destroyed. In the scientists' opinion, 
these screens will only last until the end of this year or the 
middle of 1995. They will no longer be in any state to hold 
back the radioactive material inside. As a result, a total of 
400 curies -- an extremely dangerous dose -- will leak into the 
environment. For the purposes of comparison, a total of 0.38 
curies was discharged into the water in the Far East. This led 
to an international outcry. Here, however, we are talking about 
a discharge 1,200 times more potent! 
  Basically, with every day that passes the nuclear warheads 
aboard the sunken submarine are being destroyed as a result of 
electrochemical corrosion on a large scale. While the 
Komsomolets was ablaze on the surface, military pilots 
photographed it from the air. These photographs show that the 
water around the submarine was literally boiling. These high 
temperatures caused the submarine's special coating to peel off. 
And owing to the difference in temperature between the inside 
and outside of the submarine, the vessel basically exploded. 
  Naturally, it is quite impossible to disturb or manipulate a 
heavy, cumbersome object weighing almost 10,000 tonnes and 
measuring 117 meters in length (with a diameter of approximately 
10 meters) in such a condition. Otherwise the hull would split 
in two and the protective structures of the torpedo apparatus 
would fall apart. It is impossible to guess in advance what the 
consequences of such an environmental disaster might be. This 
is why specialists have started to look for a way of 
neutralizing the Komsomolets that avoids having to bring it to 
the surface. 
Of all the suggestions they have received, the specialists 
from Arzamas-16, the "Rubin" Central Design Bureau, and the 
Committee for Carrying Out Special-Purpose Underwater Operations 
under the Russian Federation Government have picked the safest 
-- constructing a kind of sarcophagus in the submarine's nose 
section. Work on this project has been completed. It has been 
coordinated with a dozen ministries and departments and handed 
over to the State Environmental Expert Committee. 
  The initial plan was to construct an external sarcophagus. 
In other words, the intention is to cover the submarine's nose 
cone with concrete at a depth of 1,700 meters. But calculations 
have shown that on soft ground with a density of just 1.8, the 
Komsomolets could break up. It was then decided to construct an 
internal sarcophagus. But in this case it was assumed that 
special substances would be used -- sorbents capable of 
absorbing any plutonium that escapes. Eight such sealants were 
approved in a test during the latest expedition. They performed 
well. But specialists have chosen the very best. At the moment 
they are running them through yet more tests. 
  This summer a new expedition will set off for the sunken 
Komsomolets. Some 100 kg of sorbent will be pumped into the 
interior [mezhbortnoye prostranstvo]. After this all the 
hatches and cabins will be sealed. Constant environmental 
monitoring will be organized in the area. 
  The operation to construct the sarcophagus at the site of 
the 
accident and the wreck of the nuclear submarine Komsomolets is 
slated to take two months. The work will be financed by the 
Russian Federation Government.

   Safety improvements are needed to help prevent
accidents and protect operators at the Department of Energy's five
test and research reactors, the National Academy of Sciences said
Thursday.
   A report issued by the National Research Council, the academy's
operating arm, said ``DOE currently lacks a clear conceptual
framework for addressing safety issues at the reactors.''
   It said that because most of the reactors were designed many
years ago and since have been modified to operate at higher power
levels, ``prevention and mitigation of some potential accidents
rely heavily on the proper and timely response of reactor
operators.''
   ``In extreme cases, operators might have to act in the presence
of radiation or steam in order to prevent releases of radioactive
materials to the environment,'' the report said.
   At a minimum, it said, contractors running the facilities should
provide the capability to operate critical valves from remote
consoles outside the reactor confinements.
   Energy Secretary John S. Herrington said his department welcomed
the academy's safety review, which DOE had requested in May 1986.
It followed an October 1987 report dealing with safety at the
department's weapons production reactors.
   ``The NAS has again presented DOE with a very constructive
analysis of the issues relating to reactor safety. ... The
department has made structural, long-term changes in response to
previous NAS recommendations, and we will continue to do so,''
Herrington said.
   The five DOE test and research reactors examined in the NAS
report are the Advanced Test Reactor and the Experimental Breeder
Reactor II at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho
Falls; the Fast Flux Test Facility at the Hanford Federal Nuclear
Reservation near Richland, Wash.; the High Flux Beam Reactor at
Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, N.Y.; and the High
Flux Isotope Reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.
   The report concluded that safety oversight at the DOE reactors
currently is carried out by ``a fragmented collection of
contractors, operations offices and programmatic divisions in
headquarters.''
   ``The structure tends to disperse responsibility for safety and
seems to require decisions with safety consequences by
organizations that are divorced fro day-to-day safety
responsibility,'' it said.
   The test and research reactors operate at power levels of 60
megawatts to 400 megawatts, compared with the 1,000-megawatt levels
typical for commercial power reactors.
   However, the report cautioned that ``even the smallest of the
test and research reactors contain several million curies of
volatile radionuclides that must be controlled during an accident.''

OLD NUCLEAR DUMP OFF COAST IS A RELIC OF ERA OF NAIVETE IN TOXIC DISPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the black depths of the ocean near the Channel Islands lies a largely 
forgotten memento of the early nuclear age. It is low-level radioactive waste 
generated at Rockwell International's Santa Susana Field Laboratory and Canoga 
Park plants. 
</P>
<P>
For about a decade starting in the early 1950s, Atomics International, later 
part of Rockwell, dumped hundreds of drums of radioactive waste in 6,000 feet 
of water south of Santa Cruz Island. 
</P>
<P>
Today, precise information on the dump is hard to come by. Old U.S. government 
reports estimate that the dump received about 3,100 drums of waste containing 
108 curies of radioactivity -- apparently not a great concentration considering 
the diluting power of the sea. 
</P>
<P>
But it is not known if these numbers are accurate, or if all the dumping was 
recorded. Neither is it certain whether other government contractors disposed 
of waste at the site. Except for a limited survey in 1960, there has been no 
environmental monitoring of the Santa Cruz site by Rockwell or government 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Specific Studies 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we know, there have been no specific studies directed at that 
particular site to find out exactly what has been dumped there," said Diane 
Green, a park naturalist with Channel Islands National Park. 
</P>
<P>
"The Park Service . . . does have concerns for that site as well as any other 
toxic dumping site," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Larger radioactive dumps used during the same years have been studied, 
specifically those near the Farallon Islands off San Francisco and in the 
Atlantic Ocean. Although elevated radioactivity was found in bottom sediment 
near these dumps, no significant levels were found in samples of fish. Most 
researchers have concluded that too little radioactive material was dumped off 
the U.S. coasts during the '40s, '50s and '60s to create a human health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
The dumping was more of a dangerous precedent than a life-threatening event, 
said W. Jackson Davis, professor of biology at UC Santa Cruz and a leading 
critic of ocean disposal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Waste 
</P>
<P>
However, the dump may also be a special case because radioactive waste was not 
the only thing disposed of near Santa Cruz, the largest island in Channel 
Islands National Park. When Atomics International began the dumping, the Navy 
was already using the site to dispose of military waste. In fact, official 
nautical charts describe the site as a former "chemical munitions dumping area" 
-- saying nothing about radioactive waste. 
</P>
<P>
The radioactive waste dumping, authorized by the old U.S. Atomic Energy 
Commission, was variously estimated by Rockwell officials to have stopped 
between 1959 and 1962, when commercial land burial sites became available for 
low-level wastes generated at the Canoga Park plants and the Santa Susana Field 
Laboratory west of Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
"The ocean is awfully big," and ocean dumping was considered "a perfectly 
acceptable way to dispose of radioactive waste," said Marlin Remley, former 
chief of nuclear safety and licensing at Rockwell's Rocketdyne division, 
successor to Atomics International. "I don't know when it was decided that, 
'Hey, this is no good.' " 
</P>
<P>
Atomics International dumped low-level material, including liquids, 
contaminated wipes, gloves, glassware and other equipment. But the refuse 
included some highly dangerous plutonium, according to a paper delivered by 
company officials at an AEC symposium in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
Atomics International began the ocean dumping before moving to its plant at 
6633 Canoga Ave. at the end of 1955. Previously it disposed of waste from 
experiments at its plant in Downey, where the firm operated California's first 
nuclear power reactor, a tiny test model, starting in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
Although radioactive dumping by the United States virtually ended in 1962, it 
surfaced as a major environmental issue years later, leading to congressional 
hearings in 1976 and later. 
</P>
<P>
According to information compiled at the time, at least 27 Pacific, Atlantic 
and Gulf Coast sites were designated for low-level wastes, but the waste dumped 
near the Farallons and at three Atlantic Coast sites far exceeded the volume at 
all other sites combined. Virtually all environmental monitoring by the 
Environmental Protection Agency and other organizations has been done at these 
larger sites. 
</P>
<P>
Studies have found measurable radioactivity at each of the sites, but "we 
didn't find any significant uptake of radioactive materials in any of the fish 
we sampled," said Bob Dyer, chief of environmental studies for the EPA office 
of radiation programs in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Food Chain 
</P>
<P>
Similar conclusions have been reached by contract researchers for the 
California Department of Health Services, who have gathered fish samples near 
the Farallon Islands during the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the key thing you want to know," Dyer said. "You want to know whether 
it's going up the food chain and getting into man, and there's no evidence of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Dyer said that in 1960, an AEC contract research firm did a limited survey of 
the Santa Cruz dump and found no significant contamination. 
</P>
<P>
According to the paper delivered by Atomics International at the AEC symposium, 
wastes were put in cylindrical ice cream cartons, which were placed in 
55-gallon drums and sealed with concrete to make sure that they would sink to 
the bottom. About four times a year, the waste drums would be trucked to Long 
Beach for loading on a Navy barge. 
</P>
<P>
The price could not be beat. "No costs are involved since the dumping ground 
trip by the U.S. Navy is regularly scheduled for other purposes and ample space 
is available" on the Navy barge, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paid Overtime 
</P>
<P>
But Atomics International paid overtime to its maintenance workers, several of 
whom accompanied each voyage. They would ride in the tug until it arrived at 
the dump, then take a small boat back to the barge to roll the drums over the 
side. The trip to the dump and back could take more than 24 hours, and the men 
were paid for every hour at sea. 
</P>
<P>
James Youngblood of Santa Clarita, a retired Rockwell worker who went on two of 
the dumping trips, said this was a plum assignment and the men took turns 
because of the extra pay. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they enticed the maintenance workers, the blue-collar workers, with 
the overtime pay," said Eula Youngblood, his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"We just took it for granted it was a safe thing to do," said Junius Wheeler of 
Lake View Terrace, a former maintenance supervisor who helped prepare the drums 
for disposal. 
</P>
<P>
The volumes dumped may have increased after nuclear work shifted from Downey to 
Canoga Park sites and the Santa Susana lab, which have done extensive work with 
test reactors and nuclear fuel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Firm's Records 
</P>
<P>
Company memos, provided by Rockwell in response to questions about the ocean 
disposal, allude to at least 10 dumping trips in 1958-59, including the 
disposal in September, 1958, of 225 55-gallon drums along with contaminated 
boxes, tanks and conduits. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the company hired commercial haulers, but a problem arose with the 
private firms. Just as the operation involved old ideas of pollution control, 
so did it run afoul of throwback racial attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
During the overnight trips, private tug crews were reluctant to share their 
bunks with the Atomics International maintenance men, some of whom were black, 
according to George Borg, a former health physicist with the company. Borg said 
a tugboat captain told him, "The guys on board don't want to give up their 
bunks to anybody who's colored." As a result, he said, Atomics International 
resumed trips with the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
Another bad experience involved a private contractor hired to dispose of 
contaminated dirt around Santa Susana's experimental sodium reactor following a 
1959 accident that melted part of its nuclear fuel, Borg said. 
</P>
<P>
The contractor, Coastwise Marine Disposal Co. of Long Beach, accumulated more 
than 1,000 drums of radioactive waste from various generators without dumping 
it. Eventually the firm, which was cited by the AEC for excessive radioactivity 
at its Long Beach plant, dumped the wastes, including those from Atomics 
International, at another Pacific dump site about 215 miles west of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Burbank Firm 
</P>
<P>
This second dump site was used by another San Fernando Valley firm, Isotopes 
Specialties Co. of Burbank, in 1961, according to a report by the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission, successor to the AEC. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of follow-up monitoring of the Santa Cruz dump is not necessarily a 
problem, said Don Womeldorf, chief of environmental management for the state 
Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose the logical answer is that if we look in the areas where the 
greatest amount of dumping took place and find nothing of potential public 
health significance there, then one would conclude that the likelihood is much 
less of having problems where less material was deposited," Womeldorf said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Dyer also said he is not concerned about the Santa Cruz dump, he 
added: "If it hasn't been monitored since 1960, it would probably be useful to 
assure ourselves that there's no significant inventory of radioactive materials 
present in the site. . . . If the public wanted assurances, then it would be a 
good idea."

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksey Yablokov, adviser on questions of </F>
ecology to the president of Russia, by MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI 
observer Mikhail Shevelev; place and date not given: ``Leaders: 
Aleksey Yablokov''] 
  [Text] ``...I intend to resign. Rather, I am thinking 
about it very hard....'' 
  In the discussion the presidential adviser calls the Russian 
Government, as in the old days, the Council of Ministers, and he 
finds it difficult to remember the precise names of the 
instances and state posts. It is remarkable that four years of 
work in the highest echelons of power have not been enough to 
take the real bureaucrat out of him. 
  Shevelev: Do you intend to run for the Duma? 
  Yablokov: No. Out of considerations of principle. 
I am familiar with this work from the Union parliament and I do 
not find it especially interesting. 
  Moreover the Green Movement cannot count on a large number 
of 
seats in parliament now. I have the opportunity to analyze the 
president's mail and I see that this subject occupies 10th to 
12th place in importance...so we will have to join in a bloc 
with other parties, that is, get involved in politics. 
  I came to the president's administration to work as an 
adviser and I hope that I will be able to do some real work. And 
up until this spring I had not been disappointed. 
  Shevelev: And what happened in the spring? 
  Yablokov: I saw that I had no support behind me. 
The ministry of environmental protection came out in support of 
the program for the development of atomic energy. I said that it 
could not be adopted without an expert ecological evaluation, 
but in the cabinet meeting I was supported only by Minister of 
Justice Nikolay Fedorov. There are some things that cannot be 
done, there is a limit to compromise. 
  Shevelev: Does the problem lie only in your 
disagreements with the minister of environmental protection? 
  Yablokov: I think that what happened with him, the 
fact that he was not able to resist bureaucratic pressure, says 
something about the entire government. Is this really the 
government we dreamed about when Gaydar and Burbulis came? Did 
we need eight or nine deputy prime ministers with duplicate 
functions? Did it not turn out to be uncontrollable?... 
  Shevelev: Aleksey Vladimirovich, you are speaking 
as a person who intends to retire. 
  Yablokov: I intend to leave. Rather, I am thinking 
about it very hard...in the spring when I understood that I 
would not be able to get through the Council of Ministers I 
suggested raising these issues at the Security Council. For now 
an interdepartmental commission on questions of ecology has been 
created. If nothing happens here.... 
  Shevelev: ``Raise questions,'' ``interdepartmental 
commission''--this does not sound very inspiring.... 
  Yablokov: This is my last chance. Let us look. 
Yesterday, for example, at this commission they discussed what 
to do with the submarine Komsomolets. The direst predictions 
from four years ago are coming true. The plutonium has turned 
into a mushy mass and only the beryllium lining is keeping it 
from spilling out. 
  Shevelev: How long, in your opinion, will it hold 
out? 
  Yablokov: A year. 
  Shevelev: And what did your interdepartmental 
commission decide to do? 
  Yablokov: There were voices that said we should 
not get upset. But when it came to the question of who would 
sign such a decision--not to do anything--there were none who 
were willing. We will spend money now because otherwise, if the 
plutonium starts leaking, we will spend 10 times as much on 
fines alone. And we will also be blamed for others' 
pollution--we know the rules of this game--for example, the 
discharge of plutonium from the British nuclear power plant in 
Sellafield. 
  At the next session of the commission we shall be 
considering 
a document with this name: ``The Threat to National Security in 
Connection With Reduction of the Fertility of the Soil.'' Last 
month we considered technogenic accidents. Just think: Each day 
there are two large accidents in petroleum and gas fields, each 
week there is a serious accident on rail transportation, each 
month in industry, and every half year there is an accident like 
Tomsk-7 or the fire at KamAZ which cost us taxpayers hundreds of 
millions of rubles. 
  Shevelev: And in this situation you are thinking 
about retirement? 
  Yablokov: We are not in England or in Sweden. 
There they have significant nongovernmental organizations, for 
example, ecological ones, which will not allow the ruling party 
to make big mistakes. This is not fighting, but cooperation in 
administration. But here...if at that damned meeting on the 
development of nuclear energy I had not simply spoken with 
emotion--and I simply shouted there that this program must not 
be adopted--and if instead I had a well substantiated, well 
argued document...but under our conditions it is impossible to 
get such a document through state structures. 
  Shevelev: Why? 
  Yablokov: The system resists. For example, the 
program for the development of energy is now being considered. 
At best we will receive nuclear energy at the previous level, 
and at worst--on an even larger scale. And yet there are other 
possibilities! SU fighter engines use kinds of technical 
solutions that, if applied in gas turbine electric power plants, 
in three years and with $6 billion we could solve the problem of 
energy supply. And to bring our nuclear power plants up to the 
level of safety in the West, which we, gritting our teeth, will 
agree to do, will take, according to certain estimates, 160 
billion [no currency specified]. Everybody knows this including 
Yeltsin and Gaydar. They issued an order for Shumeyko to create 
a commission. It was created but it never met even once. I went 
to the president three times, I cannot do more. I am not an 
intriguer! 
  Shevelev: Does it seem to you that the resistance 
from the system is spontaneous or does it have a mercenary basis? 
  Yablokov: There are no mercenary interests. There 
are departmental ones. I cannot accuse the minister of nuclear 
energy of being concerned about his own pocketbook. The 
department is what is important to him. 
  Shevelev: But they are the same thing. Whoever has 
the bigger budget is the one who lives better. So we have not 
gone anywhere in the past five years? The word itself seems 
somehow archaic Sovietism--``departmentalism''... 
  Yablokov: Two years ago it seemed that everything 
would be different. I remember these government meetings; I 
participated in them. There were like-thinkers: Gaydar, 
Burbulis, the people who were at their side. And for some time 
they acted as like-thinkers. But then came bureaucratic life: A 
decree has to be adopted here, 50 salaries have to be added 
there, create a department here--and we had no antidote. Now so 
many decrees are being adopted it makes your head spin! The 
government made a resolution last year: The same department may 
not use natural resources and be in charge of their use. A week 
ago Zaveryukha, the deputy prime minister in charge of 
agriculture, put through a resolution on the creation of a Main 
Hunting Administration under his jurisdiction. And the way he 
did it! Even Yarov, who is responsible for natural resources in 
the government, did not know about it. And they lie at the same 
time! They said it was coordinated with the ministry for 
protection of the environment...it was not coordinated! So with 
relations like these I do not see a place for myself. 
  Shevelev: But you still have hope in the Security 
Council. 
  Yablokov: Perhaps they will take a different 
attitude toward its resolutions. 
  Shevelev: And do you have no hopes for the new 
forms of management? If the state is anti-ecology perhaps 
private capital will be more reasonable? 
  Yablokov: They have their own threats here, but 
there is a solution. The condition of the environment we have 
here existed in America, Japan, and Europe 30 years ago. And now 
people are swimming in the Rhine and trout have appeared in the 
Thames. They did it! How? The polluter pays, and not mythical 
fines but enough to reimburse the society for damages. Then 
there is payment for the utilization of nature. If there is no 
master of the land this means, in the first place, that you can 
pollute wherever you want to and, in the second place, nobody is 
responsible. And, finally, instead of writing complaints we must 
learn how to defend our rights in court. And we even have 
precedents. The socioecological alliance took the government to 
court for a resolution concerning the development of the nuclear 
power industry, and the Constitutional Court accepted it. And I 
know that the government started thinking. 
  But on the other hand we must copy nothing categorically. 
The 
average Swede or American consumes 60-70 times more energy 
resources than citizens of other countries do. If we, the 
largest country in the world, adopt this type of utilization of 
nature, the world will simply have no future. 
  Shevelev: Perhaps Greenpeace is right; they fight 
for this future using desperate, almost irrational actions. 
  Yablokov: Almost a year and a half ago I was in 
charge of the Soviet branch of Greenpeace--not everything is so 
simple here. Of course, desperate actions are necessary, but 
with respect to Greenpeace--and this is a powerful 
organization--there is reason to believe that certain interests 
are behind them. 
  On the one hand, there is the sincere enthusiasm of honest 
young people who are indeed taking a risk. For example, members 
of Rainbows of War--that is the Russian analog to 
Greenpeace--were simply beaten when they tried to stop work on a 
mine in Samarskaya Luka National Park. On the other hand, there 
is the suspicion that there is a great deal of money behind all 
this. 
  Shevelev: A way of eliminating competitors? 
  Yablokov: Perhaps. 
  Shevelev: But ultimately it was because of 
Greenpeace that we learned about the pouring out of radioactive 
wastes in the Far East. 
  Yablokov: A good example. You know the ecological 
significance of this discharge? None. The radioactivity was 0.38 
curies. Japanese nuclear power plants annually discharge 
hundreds of curies. The British and French--thousands of curies 
a year. Such is the scale of the event. 
  Shevelev: Why did our government have to take the 
blame for this? 
  Yablokov: Most likely they were afraid of a 
political outcry. But the people who made this affair 
public--they were highly professional. They must have known that 
radioactivity below one curie is not even considered pollution. 
But then you wonder why? 
  Shevelev: So the only result of all the hubbub 
were credits obtained to modernize and construct plants for 
processing radioactive wastes. 
  Yablokov: So it would seem. 
  Shevelev: Since our discussion has come around to 
the ecological movement, are you not disturbed by the fact that 
these organizations have frequently taken nationalistic 
positions? 
  Yablokov: I am. The ecological movements were the 
first manifestations of the opposition to be allowed. And what 
did they produce? Rigid, uncompromising nationalistic 
organizations in the Baltic, Moldova, Ukraine, and Armenia. The 
picture is similar in Russia. This makes me bitter because I 
have fundamental political differences with Rasputin who, like 
myself, is protecting Lake Baykal. But he is an absolutely 
sincere person and he speculates a very great deal...any 
argument of the nationalists: the birth rate is declining, the 
nation is dying out! But we should not juggle the facts: Even 
ten years ago all predictions said that we were proceeding 
toward these indicators. 
  Shevelev: You are a man of science. Were you 
willing to get involved in all this...politics? 
  Yablokov: Up until 1986 I could only dream about 
having the information that is available to me now. Now I regret 
the fact that I do not have time to interpret it. During the 
past four years I have accumulated unique experience in 
ecological activities in higher echelons of power. It would be a 
shame not to take advantage of it. 
  Shevelev: And has the perestroyka frenzy passed? 
  Yablokov: You know, my father died from cancer, 
and then my mother, and then my wife too. And among the causes 
of oncological diseases--70 percent are in the ecology, in the 
environment. I do not want my grandsons to die of cancer. For me 
politics is a personal issue.

the Russian Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety 
Central District, with introduction by LITERATURNAYA GAZETA 
special correspondent Kirill Belyaninov, published under the

<H5>  A Peaceful Atom for Every Home: Alas, This We Have Already </H5>
Achieved 
  I am sick and tired of it all. Of endless competition in the 
speed of printing documents fabricated by one political group in 
order to destroy another; of careful calculation of the arc of 
fire at the headquarters of hostile political groupings and 
pocket-size parties; the national pastime of watching the state 
of the liver of the also nationally elected president and of 
bringing in astrologers to tell us the dates and details of 
future coups. In the endless flak of arguments about how to 
conduct another revolution, we have somehow forgotten that there 
are far more real problems. 
  We have forgotten that in the Far East "friends and business 
partners" from North and South Korea will soon leave 
nothing--not even stumps--in centuries-old taiga; that 150 
companies from America and West Europe are flooding the country 
with toxic waste in exchange for Russian metal; and that, 
finally, because of our own negligence and indifference the 
threat of a new Chernobyl has become far more real than the 
threat of a coup. 
  I am sick and tired of it, because dozens of LITERATURNAYA 
GAZETA materials--and we wrote about it all: the "black market" 
in nuclear materials, the Western radioactive waste coming into 
our country, the catastrophic situation in the domestic nuclear 
power generation--did not elicit any response from our own 
government circles, which are busier attempting to reposition 
themselves in the shadow of the ruling chair. 
  I am sick and tired of it because the almost two-year-long 
struggle of Vladimir Kuznetsov, former Gosatomnadzor [Russian 
Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety] inspector, 
fired for his attempt to shut down 10 unsafe nuclear reactors, 
has not produced any results. Among the people he appealed to 
are the first persons in the Russian "ecological" establishment: 
presidential adviser A. Yablokov; Social-Ecological Union 
Chairman S. Zabelin... None of them supported Kuznetsov, while 
the truly horrible information he collected is still gathering 
dust in the safes of highest-level offices. 
  You need facts? There are many of them in the article V. 
Kuznetsov brought to the newspaper. Judge for yourself whether 
coup rumors are more important than something that affects our 
life. 
<H5>  Russia May Turn Into a Chernobyl </H5>
  Last year I had an honor my "colleagues" in the line at the 
employment agency could only dream about. Can you imagine an 
unemployed American being is invited as a consultant to the U.S. 
Senate, let alone the White House? Nevertheless, anything can 
happen in Russia, and an officially registered unemployed 
Russian may work for an equally official presidential adviser. 
There are numerous advantages to this method: If the finished 
report attracts the "highest attention," there is no need to 
introduce the author, who has not gained any status in the 
nomenklatura; in the event of failure, however, one may resort 
to a tried and tested remark: "Well, you know, we have to use 
the services of questionable characters, but after all, we do 
not get any support from ministries and agencies...." 
  This in itself would not be too bad--one can swallow 
personal 
insult if the information you collected literally crumb by crumb 
did indeed bring about at least some result. But time goes on, 
and nothing changes. Presidential advisers shove the material 
you prepared to the back of the desk drawer; ecological 
organizations of the Social-Ecological Union and Physicians of 
the World for Prevention of Nuclear War type shrug their 
shoulders helplessly; and ministerial bureaucrats simply dismiss 
the facts and figures they are shown. 
  It is easy to understand the reason for such attitudes. All 
the reports and memoranda are devoted to the activities of only 
one, albeit very impressive agency--the Russian Minatom 
[Ministry of Atomic Energy], which has always held the status of 
"sacred cow" in domestic industry. Nevertheless, let us try to 
sort out what is hidden behind the polished sign of the 
omnipotent ministry. 
  Radioactive waste disposal is perhaps one of the items at 
the 
top of the list of Russian ecological problems. 
  Existing capacities simply are insufficient, and the size 
and 
safety of storage facilities are limited, while construction of 
new ones involves immense expenditures of technical and monetary 
resources. At the same time, existing plans for dismantling 
nuclear arms and nuclear power generation systems far from 
always comply with the ability to safely store the resulting 
radioactive waste. At the end of 1992 the total area of 
contaminated land amounted to 52,263 hectares. Of them, 16 were 
recultivated over the year. According to official data of the 
Ministry of the Ecology alone, Russian Minatom enterprises have 
accumulated radioactive waste with a total emission power of 1.7 
billion curies, which are kept in 227 storage facilities, and of 
these, 81 have already been sealed. 
  If only the problem were limited to the number of storage 
facilities, though! At some enterprises the waste is kept in the 
open; most solid radioactive waste disposal sites do not meet 
elementary safety standards. And the system of handling solid 
radioactive waste in our country not only does not meet IAEA 
[International Atomic Energy Agency] standards but is contrary 
to the practice of developed countries. 
  The problems of enterprises whose names have been mentioned 
in the world press for many years--Mayak Production Association 
(Chelyabinsk-65) and Siberian Chemical Combine (Tomsk-7)--still 
have not been resolved. 
  In 1992 the maximum allowable discharge of strontium-90 at 
Mayak was exceeded by a factor of 1.8. The waste was dumped into 
the Techa river. At the same time, at the Siberian Chemical 
Combine norms of discharge of phosphorus-32 were exceeded by a 
factor of 1.14. The average annual concentration of this 
radionuclide in the Tom river was 2.9 times higher than the 
allowable level. 
  In 1993 serious accidents involving radiation occurred at 
both enterprises. Serious and very representative commissions 
visited the sites; tonnes of papers were written, but no 
particular conclusions were drawn from the events. Suffice it to 
mention that the already approved program of replacing equipment 
presenting nuclear danger at these enterprises is still not 
being implemented. 
  This, however, is just a concrete case involving only two 
nuclear facilities. Of much greater interest is something else: 
In February of this year the Russian Gosatomnadzor, known in the 
past for the extreme caution of its statements, suddenly 
subjected the state of the Russian nuclear complex to sharp 
criticism. Inspection of practically all domestic nuclear 
installations showed that "the state of nuclear and radiation 
safety in the Russian Federation as a whole cannot be called 
satisfactory. Numerous problems associated with the use of 
nuclear energy are being resolved extremely slowly and are not 
regulated by law..." 
  After such a serious statement, however, which for the first 
time indicated a split between Minatom and Gosatomnadzor, 
information came out which at first glance completely refuted 
the Federal Oversight's conclusions. The Rosenergoatom concern's 
vice president, B. Antonov, representing the main user 
organization, said that on the contrary, the safety of Russian 
AES's [nuclear power stations] has increased: There were 45 
fewer incidents at stations in 1993 than in 1992. 
  For a specialist this is a strange argument, to say the 
least. The decline in the number of incidents is not at all an 
indicator of AES safety. Last year a considerable number of 
AES's were operating at reduced capacity. This happened because 
of the considerably greater length of the repair season at power 
generators of all stations: electric power consumers simply did 
not pay their bills on time, and the AES's did not have the 
money to buy materials and component parts in the needed 
quantities. 
  In addition, controller-imposed restrictions on capacities 
(up to 23.9 percent, plus the restrictions introduced by the 
Federal Oversight--26.1 percent of the rated level) together 
produce a figure equal to a 50 percent loss in power generation 
output. The figures above confirm not only the thesis of 
Rosenergoatom's imperfect--to put it mildly--calculations and 
the resulting conclusion regarding the increased safety of the 
AES's, but also bring up a no less important question: Can it be 
that electric power produced by AES's at the old level of output 
is not needed by the Russian economy, which constantly complains 
about energy shortages? And what has caused these restrictions 
if, in the opinion of Minatom bureaucrats, everything is going 
so well in their industry? 
  Somehow, the No. 2 and No. 3 generators at the Balakovo 
station and the No. 5 Generator at the Novovoronezh station, 
which had been under long-term repair, as well as Balakovo's No. 
4 generator, which was recently brought on line, have 
disappeared from the list of AES's to be inspected. According to 
the results of last year, it was these stations' power 
generators, as well as those at the Kola AES, that were found to 
be the worst in terms of reliability and stability of operation. 
  In June 1993 a "medium-gravity incident" was registered at 
the No. 2 generator at the Balakovo AES--jamming of 11 
regulation devices in the control and protection system; at the 
Novovoronezh AES No. 5 generator in February last year there was 
an incident classified as "insignificant:" the water-chemical 
condition was off balance. At the Kola AES the incident was far 
more serious: As a result of a hurricane, high-voltage lines in 
the Kolenergo system were damaged, which resulted in the 
shutdown of all four of the stations' power generators. 
  As to work on increasing AES safety, this is not even on the 
agenda at this point. Actions in replacing technical channels at 
RBMK [high-power pressurized tube reactor] power generators and 
steam generators at power generators with VVER [water-moderated 
power reactor] reactors do not increase safety as compared to 
the design level--they only remove design faults discovered in 
the process of exploitation. Technical substantiation of safety 
factors at most power generators is still at the stage of 
development; there is no systematic substantiation of planned 
measures with respect to power generators' technical 
retrofitting and modernization. As to exploitation of all 
nuclear reactors and systems without exception, it is still 
being conducted in accordance with safety norms developed at the 
time they were built--that is, 15-20 years ago--and today does 
not even come close to modern standards. As to Minatom's 
contention that an IAEA commission that visited most AES's 
appraised their safety condition as satisfactory, this is no 
guarantee. The conclusions of various IAEA commissions are of a 
purely advisory nature and are not mandatory for compliance. 
  Nothing has changed since then, and our power generation 
industry is still ruled by the kilowatt-hour, not by safety. 
  Speaking of research nuclear installations, the situation 
with respect to them is even more difficult than that with 
nuclear reactors. The reason is not only the extreme 
obsolescence and physical wear and tear of the equipment and 
technological systems, but also the absence of practically any 
norms and safety systems. There is no normative-technical 
documentation; there is no statewide program of utilization of 
research systems, which would allow a definition of the 
necessary volume of work on these systems; there is no system 
for localizing accidents, and no simulator facility for 
personnel training. 
  The situation with respect to spent nuclear fuel at 
scientific research centers that use nuclear reactors is 
critical. In the NII [scientific research institute] of Atomic 
Reactors in Ulyanovsk Oblast, in the Physics and Energy 
Institute in Kaluga Oblast, and in the Kurchatov Institute in 
Moscow, facilities for storage of spent nuclear fuel are filled 
to 80-90 percent of capacity, while the technology for 
reprocessing it simply does not exist. 
  The practice of liquid radioactive waste disposal in the NII 
of Atomic Reactors simply does not have any analogues. Medium- 
and low-activity waste in Ulyanovsk Oblast is simply pumped 
underground into so-called "absorbing collector beds." As a 
result, more than 2 million cubic meters of waste with a total 
activity of 100,000 curies have already accumulated in 
underground storage. By law, however, waste disposal can be done 
only after it is "converted into solid explosion-, fire- and 
nuclear-proof form." In other words, waste must be converted 
into a form that ensures its reliable isolation in a geological 
medium. 
  Fifty years of operations of the Russian scientific center 
Kurchatov Institute produced an extremely difficult problem 
associated with rehabilitation of land set aside for temporary 
storage, and taking off line obsolete research systems. At the 
territory of the institute, which is located in the heart of the 
city of 9 million inhabitants, temporary storage--which, by the 
way, has remained "temporary" since the time it was built in the 
1940's--occupies an area of two hectares. It is estimated that 
it contains more than 200 tonnes of highly radioactive waste. 
  Normative documents, which have been at the development 
stage 
since 1989--nuclear safety rules for research reactors and many 
others--will not come out any time soon. The explanation is 
simple: The Kurchatov Institute is the leading scientific 
organization with respect to almost all Russian research 
reactors, and it is apparently not in its interests to introduce 
stricter safety regulations. This will require considerable 
financial investment and bringing the system to the required 
level or shutting it down. 
  The shortcoming and problems I have enumerated involve the 
activities of only one agency--the Russian Ministry of Atomic 
Energy, as well as of the structures it has set up. But even in 
the new political environment the methods Minatom utilizes for 
solving its problems remain the same old ones. As in the past, 
the atomic industry is trying to "twist the government's arm." 
Otherwise how can one explain the clamor recently raised by this 
agency in the press? (A good dozen newspapers published the 
outcry that nuclear stations are running out of fuel during the 
peak period of fall-winter demand, and soon nearly half of 
Russia will be without heat and light unless a number of 
decisive steps are immediately taken.) But the answer to this 
question is not that complicated: Having bungled things up once 
again, Minister V. Mikhaylov is trying to cover it up by 
grabbing a juicier chunk of state subsidies. It is no secret to 
anyone that both enterprises producing nuclear fuel and nuclear 
power stations are under the roof of one and the same agency, 
and therefore what we have is obviously an elementary 
miscalculation. Neither does Minatom's panicky tone fit with the 
recently signed agreement to sell nuclear fuel to the United 
States. If we cannot provide for ourselves, how can we talk 
about selling it to other countries? 
  Nothing will change unless in the nearest future a package 
of 
legislative acts is adopted on the use of nuclear power 
generation, and a state safety program is drafted and backed up 
by priority financing. 
  Without this first step, nothing will change. And who knows, 
perhaps in just another 10 years Russia will turn into a huge 
Chernobyl zone.

the Kolenergo system were damaged, which resulted in the 
shutdown of all four of the stations' power generators. 
  As to work on increasing AES safety, this is not even on the 
agenda at this point. Actions in replacing technical channels at 
RBMK [high-power pressurized tube reactor] power generators and 
steam generators at power generators with VVER [water-moderated 
power reactor] reactors do not increase safety as compared to 
the design level--they only remove design faults discovered in 
the process of exploitation. Technical substantiation of safety 
factors at most power generators is still at the stage of 
development; there is no systematic substantiation of planned 
measures with respect to power generators' technical 
retrofitting and modernization. As to exploitation of all 
nuclear reactors and systems without exception, it is still 
being conducted in accordance with safety norms developed at the 
time they were built--that is, 15-20 years ago--and today does 
not even come close to modern standards. As to Minatom's 
contention that an IAEA commission that visited most AES's 
appraised their safety condition as satisfactory, this is no 
guarantee. The conclusions of various IAEA commissions are of a 
purely advisory nature and are not mandatory for compliance. 
  Nothing has changed since then, and our power generation 
industry is still ruled by the kilowatt-hour, not by safety. 
  Speaking of research nuclear installations, the situation 
with respect to them is even more difficult than that with 
nuclear reactors. The reason is not only the extreme 
obsolescence and physical wear and tear of the equipment and 
technological systems, but also the absence of practically any 
norms and safety systems. There is no normative-technical 
documentation; there is no statewide program of utilization of 
research systems, which would allow a definition of the 
necessary volume of work on these systems; there is no system 
for localizing accidents, and no simulator facility for 
personnel training. 
  The situation with respect to spent nuclear fuel at 
scientific research centers that use nuclear reactors is 
critical. In the NII [scientific research institute] of Atomic 
Reactors in Ulyanovsk Oblast, in the Physics and Energy 
Institute in Kaluga Oblast, and in the Kurchatov Institute in 
Moscow, facilities for storage of spent nuclear fuel are filled 
to 80-90 percent of capacity, while the technology for 
reprocessing it simply does not exist. 
  The practice of liquid radioactive waste disposal in the NII 
of Atomic Reactors simply does not have any analogues. Medium- 
and low-activity waste in Ulyanovsk Oblast is simply pumped 
underground into so-called "absorbing collector beds." As a 
result, more than 2 million cubic meters of waste with a total 
activity of 100,000 curies have already accumulated in 
underground storage. By law, however, waste disposal can be done 
only after it is "converted into solid explosion-, fire- and 
nuclear-proof form." In other words, waste must be converted 
into a form that ensures its reliable isolation in a geological 
medium. 
  Fifty years of operations of the Russian scientific center 
Kurchatov Institute produced an extremely difficult problem 
associated with rehabilitation of land set aside for temporary 
storage, and taking off line obsolete research systems. At the 
territory of the institute, which is located in the heart of the 
city of 9 million inhabitants, temporary storage--which, by the 
way, has remained "temporary" since the time it was built in the 
1940's--occupies an area of two hectares. It is estimated that 
it contains more than 200 tonnes of highly radioactive waste. 
  Normative documents, which have been at the development 
stage 
since 1989--nuclear safety rules for research reactors and many 
others--will not come out any time soon. The explanation is 
simple: The Kurchatov Institute is the leading scientific 
organization with respect to almost all Russian research 
reactors, and it is apparently not in its interests to introduce 
stricter safety regulations. This will require considerable 
financial investment and bringing the system to the required 
level or shutting it down. 
  The shortcoming and problems I have enumerated involve the 
activities of only one agency--the Russian Ministry of Atomic 
Energy, as well as of the structures it has set up. But even in 
the new political environment the methods Minatom utilizes for 
solving its problems remain the same old ones. As in the past, 
the atomic industry is trying to "twist the government's arm." 
Otherwise how can one explain the clamor recently raised by this 
agency in the press? (A good dozen newspapers published the 
outcry that nuclear stations are running out of fuel during the 
peak period of fall-winter demand, and soon nearly half of 
Russia will be without heat and light unless a number of 
decisive steps are immediately taken.) But the answer to this 
question is not that complicated: Having bungled things up once 
again, Minister V. Mikhaylov is trying to cover it up by 
grabbing a juicier chunk of state subsidies. It is no secret to 
anyone that both enterprises producing nuclear fuel and nuclear 
power stations are under the roof of one and the same agency, 
and therefore what we have is obviously an elementary 
miscalculation. Neither does Minatom's panicky tone fit with the 
recently signed agreement to sell nuclear fuel to the United 
States. If we cannot provide for ourselves, how can we talk 
about selling it to other countries? 
  Nothing will change unless in the nearest future a package 
of 
legislative acts is adopted on the use of nuclear power 
generation, and a state safety program is drafted and backed up 
by priority financing. 
  Without this first step, nothing will change. And who knows, 
perhaps in just another 10 years Russia will turn into a huge 
Chernobyl zone.

  [Text] An official from Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry has 
denied writer Ales Adamovich's statement that a quantity of 
plutonium had been dumped into one of the Siberian lakes. 
  Vladislav Kotlov, a senior official at the Atomic Energy 
Ministry's press service, told Interfax that the statement of 
Adamovich, who said on Thursday that about a ton of plutonium 
was buried in a lake in Tomsk Region about 20 years ago, was 
absurd because a ton of that material costs billions of dollars. 
  Besides, Kotlov said, the Siberian Chemical Plant, situated 
in Tomsk Region, had been burying all its radioactive waste 
underground, though in an area with subsoil waters. This was 
confirmed by the Atomic Energy Ministry's press service, which 
said the buried waste had a total radioactivity of one billion 
curies. 
  Kotlov said laws were due to come out shortly banning the 
burial of radioactive waste underground in areas with subsoil 
waters. ``There are no guarantees that there will be no 
earthquakes in areas where burial sites are located, which may 
lead to the spread of radioactive substances,'' he said. 
  There are also underground burial sites near Krasnoyarsk 
(Siberia) and Dimitrovgrad (Ulyanovsk Region), Kotlov said. 
  Sources in the Ministry of Environmental Protection and 
Natural Resources, Gosatomnadzor (the State Nuclear 
Inspectorate) and the Tomsk Regional Environmental Committee 
told Interfax those bodies had no data to confirm the 
information of Adamovich, who said he had documents to prove his 
statement.

<F P=106> [From the ``Vesti'' newscast: Video report by L. </F>
Shesertkina, identified by caption] 
  [Text] [Shesterkina voice over video of truck 
emerging from reprocessing plant] The Russian Ministry of 
Atomic Energy, having examined the results of the operation and 
the state of all units of the complex for the vitrification of 
radioactive waste at the Mayak chemical combine, has authorized 
its continued operation. This furnace is the only one on the 
territory of the former USSR and the most efficient in the 
world, although this work is also done by Britain and France. 
Here industrial-grade plutonium for nuclear electric power 
stations is extracted from reprocessed nuclear fuel and the 
radioactive waste is vitrified and placed in storehouses. 
Beneath me are about 150 million curies of radioactivity 
rendered harmless from nuclear fuel used not only in Russia but 
also in Armenia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Germany, Hungary, 
and Finland. It is all too obvious that, having our own nuclear 
electric power stations, an inconceivable number of missiles, 
icebreakers, and submarines, we have accumulated such a quantity 
of weapons-grade and industrial-grade plutonium, whose decay 
takes 24,000 years, that we are doomed to conducting our own 
reprocessing. [video shows exterior, interior of

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Frolov under the rubric "Drama": "The </F>
Disappearance of the State Committee on Chernobyl Will Be a 
Shock Not Only to Its Supporters. 70 Percent of the Residents of 
`Contaminated' Areas Need Social Protection"] 
  [Text] It seems that in the near future the State Committee 
of the Russian Federation on Social Protection of Civilians and 
Rehabilitation of Territories Suffering from Chernobyl and Other 
Radiation Catastrophes, called simply Goskomchernobyl, will 
cease to exist. Along with other committees of a similar rank, 
it is a part of the GKChS [State Committee of the Russian 
Federation on Civil Defense, Emergency Situations, and Recovery 
from Natural Disasters]. Quite understandably, this disturbs the 
workers, although not all of them, of course. Not the workers 
but interested individuals, of whom there are many times more, 
are disturbed by one extremely significant aspect of this 
departmental cataclysm. The GKChS does not intend to take the 
administration of social protection under its "mantle." Thus 
the main function of Goskomchernobyl will atrophy to a 
significant degree--it will have to be performed by the Ministry 
of Social Protection, which has enough problems of its own 
without orphan children and the elderly. 
  Plenty has been said about the "Chernobyl" benefits and 
payment increments. It is clear that they are very costly and 
will continue to be costly. Experts of the Ministry of Finance 
think that in 1994 alone payments will exceed 1 trillion rubles 
[R]. Many are eager to raise a dispute over this material and 
financial aspect. Many fewer are willing to discuss the social, 
not to mention the psychological aspects. But workers of the 
Department for Studying the Medical and Psychological 
Consequences of the Disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power 
Plant of the State Scientific Center for Social and Judicial 
Psychiatry imeni Serbskiy think that as of the present moment 
these aspects are the main ones. The newspaper SEGODNYA has 
already written about the higher level of neurotic symptoms 
discovered by these researchers among the population of the 
contaminated areas, caused primarily by the extremely 
contradictory information about the scale of the danger. The 
masters Freud and Bekhterev back in their day noted that 
increased receptivity to suggestion and the preference of rumors 
over official information are typical of mass psychology. Under 
Soviet conditions it was quite predictable that these features 
would be hypertrophied and become a way of directing perception. 
Another thing was surprising: Despite expectations, in time the 
consequences of stress did not disappear, although none of the 
people residing in the affected territories could experience any 
apparent results from the action of small doses of radiation. 
Actually, it was the latter circumstance that contributed to a 
situation where stress became chronic. In this case the "Soviet 
consciousness" does not come into play. The same thing happened 
with Americans after the disaster at the Three Mile Island (TMI) 
power plant in 1979. One can understand why it was that six 
years later when a reactor in good repair was started up at 
Three Mile Island the indicators of alarm and depressive 
disorders there increased. 
  It is not so obvious but nonetheless a fact that the most 
diverse stress loads which have nothing to do with the radiation 
danger can just as successfully aggravate nervous disorders and 
all the quite physical ailments that go with them. In the 
opinion of the leader of the Department for Studying the Medical 
and Psychological Consequences, Galina Rumyantseva, social and 
economic factors are undoubtedly included among these 
"starters." It goes without saying, of course, that 
macroeconomics does not rank high among them. For example, it 
was discovered that mass deterioration of the psychological and, 
correspondingly, physical condition was brought about by delays 
in payment of wages, which are now commonplace. But one need be 
neither a medical expert nor a psychic to imagine the dynamic 
evoked by the abolition of compensatory payments. Incidentally, 
this has already begun. Benefits for people living on areas with 
background indicators of radioactivity of from 1 to 5 curies per 
square kilometer have been eliminated. The rest, whose future 
became uncertain, immediately started to feel worse. 
  There would hardly be any point to thinking about all that 
was said above outside the environment of psychologists and 
psychiatrists. Unfortunately, the consequences can (and this is 
precisely what happens most of the time) be outside their 
professional competence. There are 2.6 million Russians living 
in zones of radioactive contamination from the disaster at the 
Chernobyl nuclear power plant alone, and 2.2 million of them are 
receiving benefits and additional payments. Incidentally, the 
average level of wages in these regions was deliberately lowered 
since it was assumed that the additional payments, which now 
come to about four times the minimum wage, would serve as an 
additional source of income. And the level of health of the 
population cannot even be compared with that in the so-called 
"clean areas": Control studies showed that the incidence of 
vegeto-vascular dystonia and functional disorders are 10 times 
greater in Novozybkovskiy Rayon than in Tver, where out of every 
10,000 studied, only three were affected. 
  And so medical experts warn that abolishing the benefits 
will 
lead to a clear negative reaction. When it follows from this 
that millions of people will actually be "excluded" from life 
and more than 10 oblasts along with them, there is something to 
think about. Actually, there will be nothing unexpected in their 
behavior--almost from the very beginning of the Chernobyl saga 
these people were bearers of so-called rent psychology which, to 
be truthful, was imposed upon them. Its main feature is social 
passivity and a desire to place responsibility for their 
well-being on others. There is no need to go into detail about 
the possible consequences of such a world view: Practically 
every post-Soveticus manifests it to one degree or 
another or else has been fortunate enough to rid himself of it 
only in the recent past. Among the sufferers, access to benefits 
was a measure of success in life even irrespective of their 
actual value. For example, it would never occur to anyone that 
to send children to vacation in Australia--at the expense of 
their hosts, of course--would mean to give them at least another 
annual dose which they would receive during the flight. 
Incidentally, it would be naive to think that transoceanic 
voyages and foreign diagnosis are available to all residents of 
the contaminated territories. Near the rayon center of 
Novozybkovo there is a village called Zlynka. It is a rayon 
center too, although, according to testimony from people who 
have visited there, one gets the impression that the distance 
between it and Novozybkovo, which is visited by foreigners, is 
not 20 km but at least a half century. And our achievements if 
not at cleaning up then, as the physicians express it, in coping 
with the consequences of the disaster suffer from such contrasts 
as well. On the one hand there is our fairly successful policy 
of resettlement which, in the opinion of specialists in any 
case, surpasses similar actions taken in Belarus and Ukraine in 
terms of many parameters, and on the other--there is the absence 
for seven years in a row of reliable information on the doses 
received by the population. We still have not conducted an 
individual study of the residents. Of course, this is difficult 
work, but the majority of medical experts have no doubt about 
the need for it: It has repeatedly happened that on fairly clean 
territories there have been random people who have received a 
considerable dose of radiation. The prospects look fairly grim. 
It seems that only psychiatrists and psychologists have clearly 
formulated their ideas about them and, being specialists, in 
spite of the well-known Prutkov aphorism, they do not want to be 
one-sided like a gumboil and are hoping for cooperation from 
their colleagues. For example, endocrinologists, since increased 
pathology in this area is inevitable. It is too soon to close 
the question of the effects of small doses of radiation as 
well--thus for a long time allopathists have closed their eyes 
to the homeopathy but it still has not ceased to exist. 
  So far medical experts have been engaged in organizing a 
kind 
of assistance for which there was an obvious need. Some 70 
percent of the residents of the contaminated territories were in 
favor of organizing a sociopsychological service there. The 
first and, from all appearances, last center will begin to 
operate in the next three months. Funds have been allotted by 
Goskomchernobyl for a year--the center's subsequent destiny is 
unknown. But it is known that the network of such institutions 
for children has remained, as it were, in the planning stage. 
Incidentally, they, along with their mothers, are in the risk 
group. Also included are educators and local medical personnel. 
The latter, true, might be, as they like to put it, 
"compensated." But this can hardly be said about the majority of 
residents of "contaminated" rayons, who have perceived the 
disappearance of Goskomchernobyl as a loss of a protector. It 
seems that this time the supporters of shock therapy have 
allowed an overload.
