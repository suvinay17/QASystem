FT  16 MAY 92 / Special Report On Residential Property (7): Devon's cream on
sale at a reduced price - From cottage to estate this is a good time to buy
in wild and beautiful Devon
</HEADLINE>

DEVON is a county that rewards exploration on foot or on horseback; its
lanes, fashioned more for cart than for BMW, are ill-suited to cope with the
3.5m tourists who migrate there each year.
The county's coastline reflects a relentless, losing battle with the
Atlantic and the English Channel; ghostly remains of the fishing village of
Hallsands, near Salcombe, are testament to the unequal struggle.
Inland, above the fertile and tranquil river valleys, two features dominate
the county: Dartmoor, 365 square miles of ancient granite and gentler
Exmoor, 265 square miles with three 'turrets', Withypool Common, Winsford
Hill and Exmoor Forest.
It can be wet on Dartmoor: 100 inches of rain a year, more than three times
more than on the south coast. Exmoor usually has a more benign climate,
although a freak storm in 1952 caused the devastating flood in Lynmouth,
killing 31 people and destroying 100 houses and 28 bridges.
Lovers of these great national parks ride or stride across them. The really
adventurous journey round the entire boundary, earning the title 'bounders'
 -not a task for the faint-hearted.
The decline of mining has left tourism and agriculture as the county's main
sources of income. Visitors spent Pounds 813m in Devon last year.
The journey by road and rail is fast and easy; you really know the holiday
has started when the train thunders alongside the beach at Dawlish,
'birthplace' of Nicholas Nickleby and favourite holiday spot of Jane Austen.
For many, the call of the west gets louder with each passing holiday; soon
local estate agents will be bracing themselves for this year's round of
'agent-baiting' - people, bored with the beach, who are 'thinking of buying
a holiday home'. This year they will benefit from prices that have fallen by
as much as 45 per cent from the highs of four years ago.
There is now something for most pockets but the stuff of dreams does not
come cheap. The county has more than its share of retired people, many of
whom choose a cob cottage with a thatched roof and a stone plinth - 'a good
hat and a good pair of shoes', as the locals would say. At the last count
22.6 per cent of Devon's population was above retirement age, compared with
the UK average of 18.4 per cent. The figure would be higher if Plymouth were
discounted; a quarter of the population lives there.
At the last census in 1981 the number of second homes owned in Devon was
4,647, a rise of about 1,200 on the previous decade; and the number of
holiday letting units was 8,171. These figures rose sharply in the boom
years of the 1980s but it will be a few months before the exact number is
published in the new survey.
Devon is the third largest county in the UK. Its property opportunities are
many and varied. But all categories have suffered in the recession. Tim
Burrage, of Stags, reports a quickening of the market after a quiet winter,
although most interest was for town property.
'The country property market does not get into full swing until the early
summer; but the market is likely to remain sluggish until we have some
encouraging economic news and an end to forced sales and repossessions,' he
says. Curiously, falling house prices in counties closer to London have
damaged house sellers' prospects of achieving good prices in Devon.
James Wilson, of Wilson and Wilson, a company that specialises in finding
property, says: 'Buyers who hitherto looked at Devon can now afford to buy
in places that were formerly out of reach - counties such as Dorset,
Hampshire and Gloucestershire.'
However there are signs of life in the Devon housing market. Neil
McClintock, of Gribble Booth and Taylor, reports a 'storming start' to the
year, particularly at the lower end; and Andrew Viner, of Viner Carew, has
also seen an increase in inquiries and viewings, although most sales are
still to first-time buyers. Hambro Countrywide also reports an increase in
activity.
According to West Country House Search, based in Sherborne, the past 12
months alone has a seen a fall in prices of around 25 per cent; it is, says
the company, a good time to seek out that holiday or retirement home.
For those keen on equestrinism therer are many tempting properties on
Dartmoor and Exmoor.
Millerson, a new company formed by Geofrey Miller after his own Cornwall
company was absorbed into Hambro, specialises in property on Dartmoor and by
the Tamar, the river that separates Cornwall from Devon and the rest of
England.
He showed me a farm house with 19 acres close to Lifton, nine miles from
Tavistock, with views that would have been amazing had the previous owner
not erected an ugly (and definitely removable) modern barn. There were also
some fine traditional stone outbuildings; offers around Pounds 300,000 were
sought last year but a more realistic 'over Pounds 200,000' is now
suggested.
Millerson also handles Marystow Cottage, near Chillaton, a bright modern
home built on the site of a cottage that was destroyed by fire. Again the
views would make a city stockbroker's heart stop, and equestrians will drool
at the traffic-free lanes and bridleways that abound there. The price guide
is Pounds 235,000 but, as with all Devon property now, try an offer.
Stags, which has a wide range of property from little cottages, such as one
for Pounds 45,000 at Halberton, near Tiverton, up to large estates, has
several interesting equestrian properties; not least is Weatherham Farm,
close to Dulverton, on the Devon/Somerset borders. Again some work is
required, but with 13 acres, outbuildings and an annex this house, with its
access to Exmoor and unlimited riding, will not stay long on the market. A
price guide of Pounds 230,000 is given.
Several of the properties had that essential feature - a trout stream.
Typical of the Devon house is Lower Northcott Farm, thatched, with 12 acres
close to Cullompton. A price of Pounds 320,000 is sought. My choice for star
billing was a magnificent 14th century house three miles from Dulverton,
perfect except for some rather modern roof tiles; it has 14 acres on the
very edge of Exmoor and a price of more than Pounds 400,000 is sought.
Strutt and Parker has just sold two cottages, one buyer believing that the
market had reached its lowest point; he intends to let the property for two
years after which he will retire there. Dunsford Mill, at West Anstey, on
the southern fringe of Exmoor, with 29 acres and a barn with planning
consent, had a price guide of Pounds 200,000. Cubby Close, a Grade II
cottage on a long National Trust lease, in the Culm Valley, had been offered
for about Pounds 135,000.
There is everything the rider (or walker) could desire at Rudge Farm, at
Lustleigh, including direct access to the moor at Lustleigh Cleave. The
early 19th century house also has that other essential - a cellar. There are
20 acres, with indoor and outdoor schools, stables, outbuildings, a coach
house and thatched bothy. Knight Frank and Rutley suggests Pounds 325,000.
If you tire of mucking out and yearn for harbour views, with no garden to
worry about, there is Harbour Side, a charming little cottage in Hope Cove,
near Kingsbridge. Marchand Petit recently reduced the price of this little
two-bedroom bolt-to Pounds 85,000.

   Heavy rain swamped parts of Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska and Minnesota
on Thursday, causing flooding that closed roads and pushed rivers
to their flood stage and beyond.
   Parts of the old highway west of Salina, Kan., were closed by
flooding, and the Smoky Hill River at Elsworth was expected to
crest about 6 feet higher than flood stage.
   There was also flooding at Tescott, Kan., along a tributary to
the Saline River.
   Overnight rainfall up to 7 inches was reported across southwest
Iowa. The heavy rain caused widespread flooding of rivers and
streams.
   Up to 9 inches of rain since Wednesday morning brought the
Nishnabotna River out of its banks. The river crested more than 4
feet higher than flood stage at Randolph, Iowa, on Thursday morning.
   The crest at Hamburg, Iowa, was 11 feet higher than flood stage,
but almost a foot less than the record flood of May 27, 1987.
   The heaviest rain reported in Iowa was 9 inches at Randolph
between 7 a.m. Wednesday and 7 a.m. Thursday.
   Thunderstorms dumped up to 4 inches of rain Thursday in
southwestern Minnesota and the Twin Cities area, prompting flash
flood warnings. Basement and road flooding was reported in Redwood
Falls.
   Heavy thunderstorms dropped more than 5 inches of rain in parts
of southeast Nebraska, bringing another round of flooding to a
state pounded by severe weather and flooding in recent months.
   Early Thursday afternoon, rainshowers and thunderstorms were
scattered from central Arkansas into northern Minnesota; from
southeastern South Dakota across northeast Kansas; from southwest
Oklahoma across the Texas Big Bend; and along the central half of
the Texas Gulf Coast.
   Such storms also hit eastern Florida and southeast Georgia,
along the central and northern coast of North carolina, central
Montana, and from western Montana into northeast Washington state.
   Meridian, Miss. reached 65 degrees and broke the city's low
temperature record for the date. The previous record was 67, set in
1988.
   Boise, Idaho, cooled to 50 degrees and tied its record low for
the date, last reached in 1981; and Ely, Nev., also tied its record
low, 40, set in 1944.
   The nation's low temperature Thursday morning was 33 degrees at
Truckee, Calif.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55
degrees at Mullan, Idaho, to 100 at Palm Springs, Calif.

   Rain fell over much of the East on Friday, causing flooding in
West Virginia, and rain also fell over parts of the South and the
Plains.
   Showers and thunderstorms during the afternoon reached from New
York state and the southern half of New England across Florida.
   More than 3 inches of rain fell in two hours during the morning
in the mountains of eastern West Virginia, flooding roads, homes
and businesses and washing away young trout from a state fish
hatchery, authorities said.
   About 35 homes near Marlinton, W.Va., suffered minor damage,
said Pocahontas County emergency services director Richard Barlow.
   High water flooded part of a fish hatchery near Marlinton and
washed away about 30,000 fingerling trout, said Don Phares,
director the the state's trout hatchery program.
   In addition to the loss of fish and damaged pools, the flood
caused about $15,000 in damage to supplies and equipment, Phares
said. ``The garage has a foot of mud in it. We probably lost 2,300
pounds of trout food,'' he said.
   Heavy rain fell around Long Island Sound, between New York's
Long Island and Connecticut.
   Rainfalls of 4 and 5 inches on Long Island caused extensive
street flooding, the National Weather Service said.
   On the north side of the sound, streets and highways flooded
across Bridgeport, Conn., the weather service said.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
4.93 inches at Islip, N.Y., on Long Island; 1.31 inches at
Bridgeport; and 4.10 inches at Norfolk, Va.
   Showers and thunderstorms also extended over Louisiana, eastern
Texas and the Texas Gulf Coast, Oklahoma, western Iowa,
southwestern Minnesota, eastern South Dakota, central North Dakota,
eastern Nebraska, Wisconsin and southwestern Lower Michigan.
   Elsewhere, rain also fell over western Montana, Idaho and
northeastern Nevada.
   A flood crest that has been moving down the Wabash River in
Indiana for several days reached Covington at almost 4 feet over
flood stage, the weather service said.
   Advisories for high heat indexes _ calculated from a combination
of temperature and humidity _ were posted through Saturday over
much of Arkansas. Indexes reaching 105 to 110 were forecast over
all the state except the northeast section, the weather service
said.
   Tucson, Ariz., cooled to a record low of 65, one degree below
the previous record for the date.
   Friday's low for the Lower 48 states was 36 at Gunnison, Colo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 56 at
Salmon, Idaho, to 99 at Waco, Texas.

   Showers and thunderstorms covered large sections of the country
Friday and caused flooding from the central Plains to the central
Atlantic Coast.
   In the Ohio River town of Shadyside, Ohio, a flash flood caused
fatalities and left many missing or homeless. Gov. Richard Celeste
declared a state of emergency and National Guards were being sent
to the area.
   A wall of water near Lindsay in eastern Nebraska carried 18 cars
out of a parking lot, and flooding forced the evacuation of a
three-block portion of Platte Center. In southern Nebraska,
flooding closed underpasses near Grand Island.
   Flooding spread thorugh east-central and northeast Kansas and
over west-central Iowa. The Salyersville fire department in eastern
Kentucky was flooded with seven inches of water and roads were
closed. Flooding was also reported in West Virginia and Delaware.

   Storms spread rain from the Rockies to the East Coast on
Saturday, with locally heavy rain causing flooding in the Upper
Midwest.
   Many streams in Iowa were running high from several days of
heavy rain.
   Some streams in the Cedar River basin of northeastern Iowa left
their banks Friday, leaving thousands of acres of farm land under
water.
   The West Fork of the Cedar River at Finchford reached flood
stage on Saturday, and was expected to crest Sunday at 15 to 16
feet, the National Weather Service said. The agency predicted that
would put 20,000 acres of farm land under water. Some residential
flooding was expected at Waterloo, Cedar Falls and Vinton.
   Three days of heavy rain also made rivers rise in south-central
Minnesota, the weather service said.
   Urban flooding was reported in the Glencoe area, southwest of
Minneapolis, where 3 to 5 inches fell Friday night, flooding many
basements, the agency said.
   A motel basement wall collapsed, but no injuries were reported.
   ``The water just started to seep in slowly and then faster and
faster and then the wall just gave way,'' said Glencoe police
officer Tom Draper. ``It's basically just a big hole in the wall.''
   The Crow River was expected to crest at Delano, west of
Minneapolis, on Monday about 1{ feet above flood stage.
   In Texas, the Rio Grande was near flood stage Saturday southeast
of Presidio and rising. A flood warning was in effect into Sunday
over the Big Bend of southwestern Texas.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended over central and western
Montana, east-central Wyoming, southern South Dakota, Nebraska,
northern Kansas, Iowa, southern Minnesota and west-central
Illinois, with scattered precipitation over eastern Wisconsin.
   Showers and thunderstorms also spread from southwestern Texas to
southeastern New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle, along the Gulf of

   A widespread storm sprayed precipitation over much of the
central part of the nation Thursday, ranging from snow and freezing
rain in the North to flood-causing rain in the South.
   Freezing rain was a problem over much of the upper Mississippi
Valley, icing roads and breaking tree limbs and power lines in
parts of Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin.
   At midday, freezing rain, occasionally mixed with snow,
continued to fall from northeastern Minnesota across central
Minnesota and central Wisconsin.
   The freezing rain across Minnesota was expected to change to
snow during the night, accumulating to 1 to 3 inches by Friday
morning.
   Snow was scattered over the Nebraska Panhandle.
   Rain fell across western and southern Wisconsin and the
remainder of the southern two-thirds of Minnesota.
   Rain and occasional thunderstorms also reached across northern
Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, western South Carolina, western North
Carolina, northern Georgia, northern Alabama, southern Tennessee,
northern Mississippi, southern Arkansas and northern Louisiana.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to noon included 1.33
inches at Huntsville, Ala.
   Many rural roads in southwestern and central Arkansas were
flooded by locally heavy rain in overnight thunderstorms, and some
residents of low-lying areas of Little Rock had to evacuate.
   As much as 5 inches of rain fell in parts of central Arkansas
and nearly 7 inches fell in southwestern counties, the National
Weather Service said.
   Little Rock got 3.48 inches, a record there for any 24-hour
period in March.
   High wind caused scattered damage in western Tennessee, the
weather service said.
   In the Northwest, snow also fell on the Idaho Panhandle, and
rain was scattered along the coast of Washington.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 21 at

   Flood waters started to recede today in
northern India, and the government said at least 282 people have
died in the week of torrential rains.
   Indian newspapers put the death toll at 350.
   Hundreds of people remained marooned in villages and towns in
the central state of Punjab. The government feared the stagnant
muddy water could cause outbreaks of diarrhea and cholera.
   ``Punjab is most likely to be affected in an outbreak of
water-borne disease,'' said the official government spokesman, who
cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   At least 1,500 villages in the state were under water, said J.N.
Srivastava, an official at the Flood Control Center in Chandigarh,
the joint capital of Punjab and Haryana states. At least 70,000
people have been evacuated from the villages in boats and
helicopters, he said.
   The government said today that 282 people in Punjab and three
neighboring states have died during the floods, caused by
rain-swollen rivers bursting their banks.
   In the flooded areas in central Punjab, where at least 130
people have died, hundreds of people crowded onto small islands of
high land in villages along the Sutlej River.
   ``My entire family is perched on a tree,'' said Tara Singh, a
resident of the village of Kasabab. ``I have been moving from place
to place for the past two days to get a boat, but all in vain.''
   Singh, 45, said his wife, three children and sister took shelter
in the tree after the Sutlej overflowed into the village and
innundated their mud-and-brick house.
   The Sutlej is one of three major rivers in the state. All three
continue to flow above the danger mark.
   Another flood victim, Avtar Kaur, said no boats were available
to rescue her elderly father-in-law. ``He is bedridden and has been
on the roof of our house for the past four days,'' she said. ``He
stayed on the roof despite rains because the house was full of
water.''
   There was no rain in the region today, and a senior government
official in New Delhi said flood waters had begun receding in
Punjab, Haryana, Jammu-Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh states.
   The floods started on Sept. 21 after heavy rains caused rivers
in the region to overflow their banks. The rains continued through
Tuesday.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
floods had damaged 1.5 million tons of the summer crop, mainly in
Punjab, India's primary producer of rice and wheat.
   India had forecast a summer crop of 97 million tons.
   Floods caused by the summer monsoon are frequent in India,
Bangladesh and Nepal. In late August, monsoon-swollen rivers
innundated three-fourths of neighboring Bangladesh. Newspapers said
2,000 people died in the floods.

<HEAD>Heavy Rains Cause Flooding in Texas; Snowmelt Floods in Michigan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Torrential rains swept across eastern Texas on Wednesday,
bursting an earthen dam and causing widespread flooding. There was
flooding in northern Michigan, where melting snow filled rivers to
overflowing.
   In the Midwest, heavy snow fell from northeastern North Dakota
to northern Minnesota. Eleven inches of snow fell at Petersburg,
N.D.
   A low-pressure system that moved from south central to eastern
Texas produced powerful showers and thunderstorms, dumping heavy
rains overnight from eastern Texas into Louisiana and Arkansas.
   Over 14 inches of rain fell in 24 hours at Longview, Texas,
about 60 miles west of Shreveport, La. More than 12 inches fell at
Atlanta, Texas, and Chalk Hill, Texas, and more than five inches at
Texarkana, Ark.
   An earthen dam burst at Nix Lake, near Henderson, Texas, and the
floodwaters pushed a car off Texas Highway 43, killing a man. Other
people were left stranded in trees until rescuers arrived in boats.
   Numerous roads were closed across northeast Texas due to high
water. Across the border in Texarkana, Ark., some homes had 2 feet
of water inside and cars were washed off roads.
   As the thunderstorms moved eastward into Mississippi, between 2
and 3 inches of rain fell near the Mississippi River. Winds damaged
a house and toppled trees at Vicksburg, Miss., and similar damage
was reported elsewhere across Mississippi and Alabama.
   Flash flood watches were posted from Texas and Oklahoma to
Louisiana and Mississippi.
   Six counties in north-central Michigan declared states of
emergency as rivers topped their banks and runoff from melting snow
washed out roads.
   A flood watch also was posted for areas of New York state east
of Lake Ontario, where rainfall and melting snow were expected to
cause streams and rivers to overflow, as well as in parts of
northern New England.
   Rainfall also was expected to move into western Pennsylvania and
cause rivers to rise. A river flood watch was posted for Thursday
and Friday along the Allegheny, Clarion and upper Ohio rivers.
   Rain fell across much of the lower Ohio Valley.
   In the West, rain showers and snow showers were scattered over
the northern Intermountain region.
   Warm weather continued along the East Coast. Temperatures
climbed into the 80s from the Gulf Coast to the middle and southern
Atlantic Coast states.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 21
degrees at Duluth, Minn., to 93 degrees at Brownsville, Texas. The
nation's low was 15 degrees at Marquette, Mich.
   The forecast for Thursday called for scattered showers and
thundershowers from eastern portions of the southern plains to the
lower and middle Mississippi Valley, the Gulf Coast states, the
Ohio Valley, the Great Lakes and Atlantic Coast; rain over much of
the Pacific Northwest; and snow mixed with rain over northern New
England and upper Michigan.
   Highs were expected to be in the 30s from North Dakota to
northern Minnesota, northern portions of the upper Great Lakes, and
northern New England; the 40s and 50s from the Pacific Northwest to
the northern and central Rockies, South Dakota and Nebraska,
southern Minnesota and the middle Mississippi Valley, northern
portions of the Ohio Valley, southern portions of the upper Great
Lakes and all of the lower Great Lakes to the middle Atlantic
Coast; the 80s from Southern California to southern Arizona, Texas
except the panhandle, the Gulf Coast, Florida and southern Georgia;
the 90s over the desert Southwest; and in the 60s and 70s in much
of the rest of the nation.

drizzle, sleet and snow fell from Louisiana to New York state.
Light snow fell from Arkansas through Missouri and Illinois to
Indiana.
   A winter storm watch was posted for Monday for parts of northern
Vermont, upstate New York and the northern and western mountains of
Maine.

   Severe thunderstorms soaked much of the nation Thursday, while
the South and parts of the Plains still braced for the inundation
of rising rivers.
   Tornado watches were posted Thursday night for central and
eastern Pennsylvania, central and southeastern New York state, and
much of New Jersey.
   Warnings of gale force winds stood through the night for the
Great Lakes region and across the lower Great Lakes on Friday.
Winds reached 61 mph at Buffalo, N.Y.
   Flood watches were in effect for New York state, Vermont and New
Jersey. Heavy rain from strong thunderstorms could cause serious
local flooding problems.
   Major flooding continued on the lower half of the middle Red
River. The river is expected to stay at its crest at Coushatta,
La., through Friday, about 6{ feet above flood stage.
   Flood warnings continued for the Little River near and below
Rochelle, La., as well as along the Red River to where it joins the
Black River.
   Flood warnings remained along the Sabine, Neches, and Angelina
rivers in east Texas, as well as the Trinity and Leon rivers in
north Texas.
   Warnings also continued along the Wabash River from Mount
Carmel, Ill., to New Harmony, Ind. The river is expected to crest
about the middle of next week, at its highest stage since March
1985.
   Flooding extended along the Sangamon River from near Lake
Decatur, Ill., to the river's mouth.
   Recent heavy rains led to predictions of additional flooding on
the Black River at Pocahontas and Black Rock, both in Arkansas, and
on the St. Francis River at St. Francis, La. Flooding continued
along the White River in eastern Arkansas and the ouachita river
near the Arkansas-Louisiana border.
   The crest on the Missouri River was expected to be eight feet
over flood stage at Booneville, Mo., on Friday. The Cuive River was
seven feet over flood stage at Troy, Mo.
   Flooding has caused at least 13 deaths in Texas and one in
Oklahoma in the past three weeks, and millions of dollars in
damage. In Texas, 33 counties have been declared eligible for
disaster aid due to storms and flooding.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended across much of New England,
New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, and parts of
Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia

   The Raccoon River, swollen with recent rains, rose to record
levels and flooded parts of Iowa and Illinois, while Nebraska was
hit with hail the size of golf balls Saturday.
   Six inches of rain overnight brought the Raccoon River out of
its banks. The crest was expected to reach Van Meter in central
Iowa Sunday, nine feet above flood stage and slightly higher than
the record set in 1958. The river was expected to crest at Des
Moines, Iowa, near its 1947 record.
   Flooding closed a large number of roads and washed out bridges
in northeast and east-central Iowa and northwest Illinois. And
nearly 6 inches of rain left roads and basements flooded in
southwestern Minnesota.
   The Mississippi River was more than four feet over flood stage
at Red River Landing, La., and slightly higher than flood stage at
Donaldsonville, La.
   A tornado touched down during the morning west of Monroe, La.,
and thunderstorm wind gusts caused damage south of Ottumwa, Iowa.
Golf-ball size hail fell south of Chadron, Neb.
   Rainshowers and thunderstorms continued into the afternoon from
upper Michigan across Wisconsin, southeastern Minnesota, northern
Illinois, much of Iowa, northwest Missouri, northeast Kansas and
southeast Nebraska.
   There were showers and storms from western Oklahoma across
northwest and west-central Texas, and over southern Louisiana,
Mississippi, southwest Georgia and the northern portion of the

   Thunderstorms battered parts of Missouri and Kansas with heavy
rain, hail and high wind Tuesday, causing scattered lowland
flooding that closed streets, and rain later fell over much of the
Plains and into the Ohio Valley.
   As much as 7 inches of rain fell overnight at Elgin in extreme
southeastern Kansas.
   Cars were washed from flooded roadways during the morning near
Emporia, Kan., and there was local flooding near Concordia, Kan.
   There were a large number of reports of flooding in and around
Kansas City, Mo.
   ``We're soaked pretty good now,'' said Lyon County, Kan.,
Emergency Preparedness coordinator Steve Davis, who was watching
the Neosho and Cottonwood rivers. ``If we get more, it could be
bad. The rivers will rise.''
   From midnight until mid-afternoon, thunderstorms produced
three-quarter-inch diameter hail near Springfield, Mo.; hail an
inch thick at Stover, Mo., and near Norton, Kan., and Colby, Kan.;
and hail as big as golf balls near Hutchinson, Kan., and
Independence, Mo., the National Weather Service said.

   A storm dumped up to 22 inches of snow on the Great Plains,
snarling traffic and causing power outages, while heavy rain caused
flooding in which one person drowned and dozens of people had to
evacuate from Kansas to Mississippi.
   Tornadoes touched down in four east Texas towns Friday,
destroying at least two mobile homes, damaging dozens of homes _
some blown off their foundations _ and overturning cars.
   New Orleans and suburban Gretna both got eight inches of rain in
12 hours, the National Weather Service said. Three tornadoes
touched down in nearby Slidell, damaging homes and bn businesses
but causing no injuries, police said.
   About 150 people were evacuated from lowlying subdivisions in
Marrero, across the Mississippi River from New Orleans, said Paul
D. Connick, Civil Defense director in Jefferson Parish. One Marrero
woman drowned when her car turned off a flooded street into a
drainage canal, police said.
   In northwest Oklahoma, the storm dropped 22 inches of snow on
Goodwell and about 15 inches on Guymon. The Highway Patrol closed
roads and discouraged travel in the area.
   ``Everyone keeps saying when they come in, `April Fools' Day,'''
said Cindy Mitchell, who called the towering snow drifts outside
her Guymon auto shop a cruel joke.
   ``It's Oklahoma. But even for Oklahoma, it's a little extreme,''
said National Weather Service meteorologist Carl Szatkowski.
   In southwest Kansas, Rolla had 13 inches of snow, Johnson 10
inches and Liberal 6 inches. Most roads were closed west of Garden
City.
   ``There are times when you can't even see across the street,''
said Rayna Brown, a spokeswoman for the Stanton County sheriff's
office in Johnson, Kan.
   ``We have a blizzard, with no electricity and no heat,'' said a
Morton County, Kan., sheriff's dispatcher who refused to give his
name. ``The only thing I've got that works is a telephone.''
   A bus with 39 people aboard slid into a ditch in Syracuse, Kan.,
along with other vehicles on Friday, but no injuries were reported,
authorities said. A motel and high school gymnasium were filled
with stranded travelers.
   Rain-swollen rivers jumped their banks in northeast Oklahoma.
Flooding in Bird Creek forced the evacuation Friday night of about
20 homes and seven businesses in Skiatook.
   Water began spilling over the creek banks around noon Friday and
was rising at a rate of a foot an hour, said Skiatook Police
Officer Paul Floyd. The river was expected to crest today near 26
feet; flood stage is 21 feet.
   About 30 flood victims spent Friday night at a shelter in the
Skiatook Community Building, Red Cross officials said.
   In Chandler, Kan., about seven families were moved out of homes
because of rising water.
   ``They're kind of used to it,'' said Lincoln County Civil
Defense Director Mike Clarkson. ``They just kind of put things up
high on the lower floors and move out for a few hours.''
   Flooding washed two cars off a road in Fort Smith, Ark., where
many roads were closed and cars were nearly submerged.
   Heavy rain also swelled the Amite River in east-central
Louisiana, where minor flooding was expected today.

   Water from a swollen reservoir roared
through floodgates in an ever more powerful flow today as the first
flood crest reached the dam, threatening to swamp 200 square miles
of southeastern Texas.
   Parts of Arkansas flooded since May 1 were declared a disaster
area Tuesday by President Bush. On the Red River, which climbed
toward a 45-year high, National Guardsmen worked to shore up a
weakened levee protecting the town of Garland.
   In Louisiana, Gov. Buddy Roemer flew over flooded regions of his
state today to check out damage caused by the Red River. Col. Frank
Skidmore of the Army Corps of Engineers told him 700,000 acres of
farms and woods would be inundated by the muddy water.
   Elsewhere, heavy rain pelted water-logged central and southern
Illinois overnight, causing flooding that forced the evacuation of
several families in Vermilion and Macon counties.
   In Washington, the Federal Emergency Management Agency today
extended a presidential disaster area to four more Texas counties,
making a total of 33 counties eligible for government assistance
because of severe weather and flooding since April 15.
   The Trinity River in Texas was carrying flood crests from
torrential rain two weeks ago in the Dallas area and from heavy
rain last week upriver near Crockett. The first of the crests
crossed Lake Livingston today as the water flowed southward.
   ``This is the front end of it. This is just the beginning,''
said Liberty County emergency management coordinator Jim Mitchum.
   The water released from the Lake Livingston Dam flooded areas
where some 7,000 residents were warned to evacuate. It was the
worst flooding in Texas in 80 years.
   The Trinity River Authority released water at a record rate of
88,000 cubic feet per second Tuesday and today through the gates of
the dam.
   Discharges later today were likely to pass 90,000 cubic feet,
and the 100,000 level was expected by Monday, said Grady Manis, the
authority's southern region manager. He said that level was likely
to be sustained for six to eight days.
   Roads leading into more than 15 subdivisions in wooded areas
along the river in Liberty County were already covered with water.
   Although many homes probably will have some flood damage,
Mitchum said he does not expect entire subdivisions to be wiped out
by the heavy current.
   ``We will not be washed down the Trinity River into the Gulf (of
Mexico),'' he added.
   Manis said he expected the worst flooding on Monday.
   ``Below Lake Livingston Dam, there's about 990 square miles.
Maybe 20 percent of that is probably going to be underwater at the
height of this.''
   The area threatened is about 50 miles south of the dam and 60
miles northeast of Houston. Many residents heeded early warnings
and moved to higher ground. Some of those who chose to stay lost
their nerve and called for help.
   ``Now they've become frightened and they want out,'' said Jim
Mitchum, Liberty County emergency management coordinator.
   Heavy rain in past weeks also caused flooding in Oklahoma and
Kansas.
   The flooding has been blamed for one death in Oklahoma and 13 in
Texas, including a 25-year-old cleanup worker swept away Tuesday
near Texarkana.
   The Red River sent water deeper over Louisiana cropland today
but officials said it may have crested in Shreveport earlier and
lower than expected.
   The Red crested Tuesday at Shreveport at 34.5 feet, nearly a
foot below the crest initially predicted for today and 4.5 feet
above flood stage. The difference was attributed to better
absorption of water upstream and less than expected effects from
recent rain in Oklahoma and Arkansas.
   ``The worst is over, but we're not quite out of the woods yet,''
said Ernest Ethridge, chief meteorologist at the National Weather
Service in Shreveport.
   ``It's the worst flood we've had here in my lifetime,'' said
Rep. Jim McCrery, R-La., who toured the region.
   The water had forced 225 people out of their homes in the
Shreveport-Bossier City area of northwestern Louisiana. An
additional 135 were flooded out downstream in Rapides, Natchitoches
and Red River parishes.
   The Red River in Arkansas began to abate on Tuesday, and
officials said they could concentrate on cleaning up. In Kansas
City, daylong downpours caused creeks and rivers to overflow and
forced hundreds of people from their homes.
   ``We've been saying that this was going to be a truly
devastating flood, and it looks like it will be,'' said Judge
Dempsie Henley in Liberty County. ``We don't have any historical
data to compare what the damages and losses could be.''
   At the Rattlesnake Ranch in Houston County, part-owner and
manager John Merriwether estimated losses in cattle, homes, fences
and property will exceed $1 million. Statewide agriculture losses
have been put at $500 million.
   ``We lost cattle, but how many cattle, we don't know,'' said
Merriwether. ``Probably a lot of them are floating now.''

   United News of India said heavy rains in the western state of
Gujarat caused five rivers to burst their banks and maroon scores
of villages. At least 48 people drowned in the flooding, the news
agency said.
   Army helicopters were being used to ferry essentials to the
stranded villagers, it said. Road and rail traffic has been
disrupted.
   In the eastern city of Bhubaneshwar, officials said at least two
people were drowned on an island off the coast after heavy rains
caused floods.
   At least 140 people have died in India this year in floods
caused by the annual summer monsoons.

<HEAD>Rain Still Scattered Across the East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain and thunderstorms were scattered through the East this
morning after a day of storms that caused flooding in several states
and contributed to at least two traffic deaths in the Atlanta area.
   More than 2{ inches of rain fell in the Atlanta area Tuesday,
causing minor street flooding. About 30 miles to the southwest, the
Chattahoochee River was forecast to crest almost a foot above flood
stage today.
   Former Paulding County Commission Chairman Donald C. Watson was
killed and his wife injured when a 70-foot-tall oak tree toppled
onto their car as they were driving through the Kennesaw Mountain
National Battlefield Park in Cobb County.
   Elizabeth Farris was killed and her husband, former Fulton County
Commissioner Milton Farris, was injured when their car hydroplaned
into a moving van north of Atlanta, Fulton County police said.
   Heavy rains also exacerbated flooding in eastern and central
Alabama, where rainfall ranged from 2 inches to more than 5 inches
on Tuesday. The Tallapoosa River was expected to crest 8 to 9 feet
above flood stage at Milstead today.
   Fifteen to 20 families were evacuated from trailer homes in
low-lying areas of Tallapoosa County and floods destroyed half the
county's cotton crop, authorities said.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms continued this morning from
Florida to New England and the lower Great Lakes.
   Minor flooding closed some roads and bridges in western
Pennsylvania and eastern Tennessee Tuesday. Several dozen homes were
evacuated in Tennessee, and a rockslide closed the westbound lanes
of Interstate 40 near Rockwood. No injuries were reported.
   Thunderstorms produced large hail and damaging winds in Nebraska
and South Dakota on Tuesday evening. Storms continued in northwest
and southern Minnesota, eastern South Dakota and northeast Nebraska.
   Today's forecast called for widespread showers and thunderstorms
from the upper Ohio Valley through the Appalachians and much of the
Carolinas into the Florida Panhandle; scattered showers from New
England and along the Atlantic Coast into the Florida Peninsula;
scattered showers and thunderstorms across the northern and central
Plains into the eastern slopes of the northern and central Rockies;
and rain entering northwest Washington state.
   Highs were expected to be in the 80s or 90s across much of the
nation; in the 60s from northern Washington state across the
northern Rockies into the northern Plains; in the 70s from other
parts of the Pacific Northwest through to western and central
Nebraska and western and northern Minnesota, and from the eastern
Great Lakes into the central Appalachians; and between 100 and 110
degrees in southern portions of New Mexico, Arizona and California
and the California valleys.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 31 degrees at Yellowstone
Park, Wyo., to 94 degrees at Glendale, Ariz.

   Heavy rains caused flooding Wednesday in Tennessee, Kentucky,
Illinois and Indiana and flood watches were posted in a number of
other states.
   Nearly 9 inches of rain has soaked parts of western Kentucky
since Sunday, forcing hundreds of evacuations.
   In Frankfort, the Kentucky River had reached 4.6 feet above flood
stage by Wednesday afternoon, state officials said. The Barren River
was expected to crest about 5 feet over flood stage at Bowling
Green, Ky., on Thursday.
   Many small streams in southern Illinois and southern Indiana
flooded Wednesday morning. In Ohio, the Scioto River was flooding
and a flood warning was posted Wednesday for the West Virginia
counties of Cabell, Wayne and Mason.
   Flood watches remained in parts of Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana,
Illinois, Tennessee, Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas.
   In the southern Atlantic, a tropical disturbance sent heavy rains
and gusty winds toward Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The
hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, putting the tropical
disturbance well beyond the normal bounds of tropical weather.
   ``Of course, we've had hurricanes in March, but this is not at
that stage yet. It's still just an area of disturbed weather
associated with a low-pressure system,'' said Bob Sheets, director
of the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   Winter weather advisories were posted in parts of Illinois, New
York, Idaho, and Vermont. A snow advisory was posted in northeast
Washington state.
   Snow fell Wednesday in northern New England, northeast New York
state, Michigan, northern Indiana, central Illinois, the Dakotas,
eastern Montana, eastern Nebraska, Colorado and northern New Mexico.
There was freezing rain in parts of Oklahoma, Missouri, Pennsylvania
and New York state.
   Snowfall during the 6 hours ending at 1 p.m. EST included 2
inches at Burlington, Vt., and an inch at Bismarck, N.D., Buffalo,
N.Y., Chicago, Grand Rapids, Mich., Peoria, Ill., and Syracuse, N.Y.
   Rainfall during the same period included 1} inches at Fort Knox,
Ky., and almost an inch at Fort Campbell, Ky.
   Several cities in the South broke high temperature records for
the date including Augusta, Ga., 82; Cape Hatteras, N.C., 72;
Charleston, S.C., 81; Chattanooga, Tenn., 77; Greer, S.C., 74;
Huntsville, Ala., 74; Lynchburg, Va., 76; Mobile, Ala., 80; Norfolk,
Va., 79; Pensacola, Fla., 76; Roanoke, Va., 78; Richmond, Va., 82;
and Savannah, Ga., 82.
   The nation's low Wednesday in the Lower 48 was 29 degrees below
zero at Warroad, Minn.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 13
degrees below zero at International Falls, Minn., to 86 degrees at
McAllen, Texas.
   Thursday's forecast called for snow showers from north-central
Kentucky across central Ohio to west-central Pennsylvania. Snow was
expected to become rain from southern New England across Maryland
and west across the Appalachians, from northern Georgia across
Arkansas, Oklahoma and northern Texas. Showers and occasional
thunderstorms were to reach from southeast Texas across Louisiana,
southern Mississippi and central Alabama. Snow was to extend from
the northern Rockies across the Pacific Northwest and change to rain
along the northern Pacific Coast.
   Predicted high temperatures were: single digits from the northern
Rockies across North Dakota; single digits and teens over northern
Maine, Upper Michigan, Wisconsin across the upper Mississippi
Valley, South Dakota, northern Wyoming and western Montana; 20s and
30s from the central half of New England across the Ohio Valley, the
remainder of the Great Lakes, the middle Mississippi Valley, the
central Plains, Oklahoma, Texas, the remainder of the Rockies, the
Pacific Northwest and the northern coast of Washington; 40s and 50s
from southeast New York state across Delaware and Maryland, much of
Virginia, western Tennessee, Arkansas, northern Texas, southern
Rockies and the Pacific Coast from central Washington through
central California; 80s from southeast Louisiana across Florida.
High temperatures will generally be in the 50s and 60s in the
remainder of the nation.

   Record warm weather surging northward caused dense fog Monday in
which 52 vehicles crashed on a Wisconsin bridge, and runoff from
violent weekend thunderstorms caused flooding on the southern
Plains.
   Temperatures rose into the 60s as far north as North Dakota, and
Washington, D.C., posted a high of 87, the warmest on record for
any day in March. The early warmth threatened to make Washington's
cherry trees bloom too early for the annual Cherry Blossom
Festival, scheduled to begin April 1.
   In the West, northern Utah cleaned up after the heaviest snow of
the season. Following a spring-like Saturday with temperatures near
60, a storm dumped 10 inches of snow on the Salt Lake Valley on
Sunday, with about a foot of snow on ski resorts.
   ``Historically, March is a change-of-seasons month, so you have
a wide variety of weather,'' said Dewey Jobe, meteorologist with
the National Weather Service in Bismarck, N.D., which expected
highs in the 60s in the southeast and snow during the night in the
northwest.
   A teen-ager drowned after he fell into a raging creek in Texas,
a canoeist was missing on a swollen river in Wisconsin, and three
people were killed in the 52-vehicle pileup in Wisconsin.
   The unsettled weather on the southern Plains kept the space
shuttle Atlantis grounded at Fort Bliss, Texas, delaying its
piggyback flight back to Florida atop a Boeing 747, NASA officials
said Monday. The twinned craft landed Sunday for refueling.
   Dense fog caused by the warm air flowing over snow and frozen
ground was reported from North Dakota into Michigan, reducing
visibility to zero in places and delaying planes at airports.
   Visibility was ``just about down to zero'' at the time of the
accident on a bridge at Green Bay, Wis., said Police Lt. Roy
Johnson. In addition to the dead, hospital officials said 30 people
were treated.
   ``The catalyst was a three-car accident. How that happened I
don't know. From there it was a chain-reaction. It just piled up,''
Deputy Chief of Traffic Robert Kreuser said. ``In my 28 years of
service with the Green Bay police department, this is the worst
I've ever seen.''
   Elsewhere in Wisconsin, flooding was caused by a combination of
rain and rapidly melting snow, and frozen ground that prevented
water from soaking in. Fire department officials in the village of
Plover, near Stevens Point, had to sandbag some homes Sunday to
prevent flooding, and some roads remained under water Monday, said
village Clerk Emma Jane Lee.
   Up to 2{ inches of rain plus snowmelt also flooded homes in
several areas of Minnesota, including Minneapolis. Basement walls
collapsed in some homes. Cars were abandoned on Interstate 94 in
Minneapolis after they stalled in standing water, according to the
State Patrol.
   In Maple Grove, Minn., a canoeist was reported helping rescue
motorists stranded by high water.
   Authorities in the eastern Illinois city of Danville worked to
restore water service to some 55,000 customers after it was halted
by flooding that began Saturday. Schools and most restaurants
remained closed.
   Bismark, Alvin and north Danville areas along the North Fork
River had the most severe flooding, officials said. About 200
people had been forced from their homes and remained out Monday.
   Heavy thunderstorms battered parts of Texas, Oklahoma and
Arkansas and caused flooding Sunday and Monday.
   Flooding continued in parts of central and northeastern
Oklahoma, closing some highways, and at least a half-dozen schools
called off classes, officials say.
   Gilford Hopkins, assistant fire chief in Skiatook, Okla., said
that water from Bird Creek was ``up in and around'' about 60 homes
and 10 businesses.
   A police dispatcher in Guthrie said water got into about a dozen
businesses. In Bartlesville, about a dozen people sought shelter
Sunday when water creeped up to their homes.
   In Arkansas, the Ouachita River pushed past 39 feet early Monday
and stopped rising just in time to spare Camden from significant
property damage and evacuations, officials said. Four families were
evacuated.
   ``It was close for some of the houses. Some lacked six inches,
10 inches of getting water in their homes,'' said Niolan Spain of
office of emergency services.
   In southwestern Fort Worth, Texas, which received about 2 inches
of rain, several dozen residents were evacuated because a drainage
creek overflowed. Cars were fender-deep in water and mattresses
floated in flooded bedrooms at some residences.
   ``It happened so fast, you didn't have time to do anything,''
said Manuel Martinez, whose home was flooded.
   Fort Worth Meacham Airport recorded 4.55 inches of rain Sunday
and sections of Cooke County recorded 4 inches.

   Flooding in Iran swamped dozens of
villages in a province near the Afghan border and forced thousands
of people to flee, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported Saturday.
   No deaths have been reported, an unidentified official at the
prime minister's office told IRNA, monitored in Nicosia.
   Flood waters inundated 35 villages in Sistan-Baluchistan
province, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage to
farms, bridges, highways and buidings, he said.
   About 6,600 flood victims have been evacuated and military units
are still trying to rescue people from the inundated villages.
Boats, helicopters and an airplane worked around the clock to save
human lives, he said.
   The flood was caused by the unusual rise in the Hirmand and
Paryian rivers in southeast Iran, IRNA said. The report did not say
when the flooding began or what caused the rivers to swell.

   Rain and thunderstorms were scattered over the East Coast on
Thursday, while record heat returned to the Southwest with
temperatures above 100 degrees.
   An upper air disturbance moving through the middle Atlantic
Coast scattered showers and thunderstorms over eastern North
Carolina and Virginia.
   A thunderstorm at Cape Carteret, N.C., produced hail as big as
dimes and strong gusty wind. Dime-size hail also fell from a
thunderstorm in Onslow County, N.C.
   Thunderstorm wind gusts toppled trees and power lines at Castle
Hayne, N.C., with wind gusting to 53 mph at Wilmington, N.C.
   Rain combined with snowmelt over northern New England to swell
rivers and streams. An ice jam on the Connecticut River flooded a
highway in New Hampshire between Lancaster and Cushman, the
National Weather Service said.
   Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt also continued along the
Red River Valley along the border between North Dakota and
Minnesota. The Red River was 10 feet above flood stage at Fargo,
N.D., and was expected to crest nearly 20 feet above flood stage
Sunday or Monday.
   More flooding persisted in western Tennessee and northern
Alabama, where the Hatchie River was nearly 3 feet above flood
stage at Bolivar, Tenn.
   Cool, unstable air dominated over the Great Lakes and the Ohio
Valley. Showers developed across sections of Ohio and Indiana and
also extended from central Montana across eastern Nebraska and
central Missouri into western Kentucky.
   Record heat continued across the southern and central Pacific
Coast thanks to the action of an upper-level high pressure system
off the coast of southern California. By noon, Palm Springs,
Calif., had already reached 102 and downtown Los Angeles hit 100
degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 33
degrees at Ironwood, Mich., to 106 at Ontario, Calif. Thursday's
low for the Lower 48 states was 16 at Warroad, Minn.
   For Friday, scattered showers and a few thunderstorms were
forecast from Arkansas and Missouri across the Ohio and Tennessee
valleys, the lower Great Lakes and the Appalachians to the middle
Atlantic Coast and northern New England. Scattered showers also
were forecast from Washington state across the northern Rockies to
western sections of the Dakotas.
   Highs in the 30s were predicted from eastern North Dakota across
the northern half of Minnesota to northern sections of the upper
Great Lakes; in the 40s and 50s from much of the northern and
central Plains across southern Minnesota, the middle Mississippi
Valley, southern sections of the upper Great Lakes, the Ohio Valley
and the Appalachians to the northern and middle Atlantic Coast; in
the 80s over the northern half of California and western sections
of the Great Basin, and from the southern Rockies across central
and southern Texas, the western half of the Gulf Coast region to
southern Florida; in the 90s over the southern half of Florida; and
above 100 over the desert Southwest.

   Showers and thunderstorms that generated at least one tornado
were scattered over the eastern half of the nation Saturday, and
locally heavy rain caused flooding in the Southwest.
   Temperatures plunged to record lows from Michigan to Texas.
   Many showers and thunderstorms had developed by early afternoon
from New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania, Maryland, western
Pennsylvania and western New York state southward across Georgia
and Florida.
   A tornado touched down around noon at Preston, Md., and a storm
that might have been a tornado caused damage during the morning at
New Port Richey, Fla., the National Weather Service said.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
1.76 inches at Tampa, Fla.; 1.06 inches at Knoxville, Tenn.; and
1.06 inches at Mansfield, Ohio.
   Showers and thunderstorms also were scattered over central
Alabama, southern Mississippi, southern Arkansas, northern
Illinois, northeastern Iowa, western Lower Michigan and eastern
Wisconsin.
   Rain also was scattered from southern Nevada and western Arizona
across New Mexico, southwestern Texas and Colorado into the
Nebraska Panhandle.
   Locally heavy rain during the early morning along the arid lower
Colorado River Valley caused street flooding at Bullhead City,
Ariz., and near Needles, Calif., the weather service said, and left
an inch or two of water standing on roads between Lake Havasu and
Parker, Ariz.
   Heavy rain Friday over the headwaters of the Puerco River in New
Mexico caused high water along the river paralleling Interstate 40
in Arizona during the night.
   Record lows reported were 57 at Abilene, Texas; 51 at Amarillo,
Texas; 61 at Beaumont-Port Arthur, Texas; 63 at College Station,
Texas; 50 at Concordia, Kan.; 62 at Dallas-Fort Worth; 66 at Del

   The record lows at Amarillo, Houston, and Waco tied their
records for the whole month of July.
   Saturday's low for the Lower 48 states was 42 at Kearney and
Ord, Neb.
   Hot air settled in California's southern San Joaquin Valley.
Bakersfield had already heated to 101 by 9:30 a.m.
   On Friday, the heat hit the San Francisco area, with highs of
106 at Morgan Hill and 103 at Livermore, and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric
Co. experienced the highest demand for power in northern and
central California in the utility's 85-year history.

   A record flood crest on the rain-swollen Trinity
River surged southward toward the Gulf of Mexico today, threatening
to swamp rural areas along the way after devastating a Dallas
neighborhood.
   Emergency workers helped sandbag rising streams in Arkansas. A
reservoir on the Texas-Oklahoma line that flooded shoreline homes
reached a record height and began falling today, but high wind
threatened to cause more shoreline damage by kicking up waves.
   The death toll from the flooding caused by last week's
thunderstorms stood at six today, all in Texas. Twelve Texas deaths
have been blamed on weather in the past several weeks.
   The Red Cross in Texas counted 723 dwellings destroyed and more
than 2,000 damaged in the last two weeks by the state's most
serious flooding since 1908.
   Water from the Trinity stood several feet deep in the Rochester
Park area outside Dallas, and some houses were submerged. Flood
stage is 30 feet and the Trinity stood at 43.8 feet in Dallas early
today. More than 400 residents were evacuated last week.
   Alester Crumbley said this is the third time in a year his home
has been flooded. He moved back in two weeks ago after spending
$11,000 and several months rebuilding from two floods last year.
   ``I don't think I'll be able to do it again, I'm so deep in
debt,'' he said.
   North Texas has had 22.06 inches of rainfall in the first four
months of 1990, the most since 1922. As much as 7 inches of rain
fell within 24 hours in some areas in past days.
   Flooding continued in rural counties along the Trinity south of
Dallas, as high water washed out levees. At Trinidad, 60 miles
southeast of Dallas, the river was 47.5 feet deep Sunday, far above
the 28-foot flood stage.
   In Dallas, the Red Cross has opened shelters for evacuees since
heavy rain, flooding and tornadoes swept across North Texas a week
ago. Through the weekend, about 1,500 people had been sheltered and
more than 12,000 meals served, the Red Cross said.
   In Arkansas, the worst of the flooding was likely in the Little
Rock area on Tuesday, when the Arkansas River is expected to crest,
said Gary Talley of the state Office of Emergency Services.
   North Little Rock scaled back emergency personnel assigned to
flood-control tasks to give workers a rest before Tuesday.
   ``We feel like we're in pretty good shape, that we've done all
we can in expectation of the river rising another foot,'' said
North Little Rock Mayor Patrick Henry Hays. ``The sandbags are
doing what they're supposed to do. We feel like we've won that
battle.''
   The Arkansas was expected to rise to 27.5 feet today and reach
28 feet by Tuesday morning, 5 feet above flood stage.
   Downstream at Pine Bluff, the river reached 45 feet, its highest
level in 33 years, and forced more than 400 people from their
homes. Officials said a crest of 48 feet is expected Wednesday,
topping the 44.7-foot crest of 1973.
   On the Oklahoma-Texas line, Lake Texoma was expected to crest
today at about 644.76 feet, or almost 5 feet above the overflow
spillways. The lake topped the old record of 643 feet Saturday and
continued rising even though the Army Corps of Engineers was
releasing 145,000 cubic feet of water per second.
   ``The best estimate the (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) can give
you is it'll go down 3 inches per day,'' said Marshall County Civil
Defense Director John Martin.
   He said wind expected to blow at 15 to 25 mph today would kick
up waves that could erode foundations of buildings that are already
submerged, and push water up into homes that have been dry so far.
   A preliminary count Sunday found 83 homes in Marshall County
partially submerged by water from Texoma.
   Despite warnings of submerged power lines, floating propane
tanks, trees, docks and other obstacles, many sightseers toured the
lake by boat.
   In Dallas, U.S. Rep. John Bryant toured Rochester Park by boat
and came across one of the last flood victims awaiting rescue _ a
large dog atop a filing cabinet in several feet of water.
   Bryant's district is among the 16 counties declared disaster
areas by President Bush.
   Officials of the Federal Emergency Management Agency arrived on
Sunday to process claims for relief. About 500 requests already
have been received.

   Tornadoes battered central Kansas and swept through several
other states in the Midwest and the Rockies before stormy weather
eased Friday.
   In central Kansas, residents began cleaning up from nine
twisters Thursday that derailed a freight train, destroyed homes
and injured at least four people. Authorities estimated damage at
more than $3 million.
   Six tornadoes were reported in Wyoming, two hit Montana and one
touched down in South Dakota, the National Weather Service said. No
deaths were reported in any of the twisters.
   Four oil workers leapt from an oil rig near Bushton, Kan., and
tried to outrun an approaching tornado in a car. But the car was
tossed into a field and the four men had to be cut free, said
Barton County Sheriff Jim Daily.
   They were hospitalized in good condition Friday with cuts and
buises, he said.
   A twister derailed 88 of 107 cars on a Missouri Pacific Railroad
freight train just west of Bushton, about 160 miles west of Topeka.
None of the crew members was injured.
   Downed power lines forced officials to close an eight-mile
stretch of state Highway 4 between Claflin and Bushton for three
hours. Nolan Howell of Great Bend said he counted at least a dozen
demolished or seriously damaged farms between those two towns.
   Weekend forecasts for the tornado-stricken area called for
milder weather, with thunderstorms possible, the weather service
said.
   In Nebraska, more than an inch of rain and hail as big as golf
balls fell overnight on northern and eastern sections of the state.
   Rain runoff washed out some county roads and caused minor
flooding, said officials in Valentine.
   The break in the weather was welcomed in flooded areas of Texas,
Oklahoma and Arkansas.
   In Arkansas on Friday, six counties were added to the federal
disaster list, increasing to 31 the number of counties in which
residents are eligible for emergency assistance.
   Arkansas recorded its first flood-related death on Thursday.
Larry Johnson, 35, of Hot Springs, who had been in a coma since
Saturday night, died of injuries suffered when he was swept through
a drainage ditch while trying to rescue occupants of a car trapped
in high water.
   Flooding that began late last month has been blamed for 13
deaths in Texas and one in Oklahoma and hundreds of millions of
dollars in crop and property damage.
   On Friday, Trinity River Authority officials slowed the release
of water through the floodgates of the Lake Livingston Dam to
71,500 cubic feet per second, and expected to lower it further
during the weekend. Last week, releases hit a record 100,800 cfs,
causing flooding along the Trinity River downstream. One cubic foot
of water equals 7.5 gallons.
   In Louisiana, also hard-hit by recent floods, officials said
they expected rainwater flowing down the Black and Mississippi
rivers to spill over during the first week of June.
   Farmers in the Brouillette area of Avoyelles Parish hastily
brought in wheat harvests to beat the anticipated flooding.
   The overflow was expected to begin south of Alexandria in
central Louisiana on June 4, said John Barnhart of the Army Corps
of Engineers.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Hit The Plains, Flooding in Maine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms stretched across the Great Plains on
Friday, while heavy rains washed out roads and forced school
closures in Maine where residents braced for flooding along major
rivers.
   Record low temperatures, meanwhile, occurred Friday morning from
Missouri to Florida.
   Southerly winds spread showers and thunderstorms from eastern
portions of Texas and Oklahoma across central Kansas and central
Nebraska to portions of South Dakota and Wyoming.
   In Oklahoma, overnight rainfall from 1{ inches to 2 inches was
reported at Hobart and Fort Sill. Thunderstorms produced half-inch
hail at Laramie, Wyo., at midday.
   A low pressure system centered over New York and Pennsylvania
caused scattered areas of rain to fall from the upper Ohio Valley
and lower Michigan into New England.
   Heavy rainfall continued to plague Maine. Twenty-four hour
rainfall as of 2 p.m. EDT included about four inches at Portland
and Rumford.
   Some roads have been washed out in southwest Maine, where the
Presumpscot River was expected to reach all-time record levels. The
swift river was 2{ feet above flood stage Friday morning and rising
rapidly.
   A flood warning was also posted for the Kennebec, Androscoggin
and Saco rivers. Most major rivers were expected to crest between 6
a.m. and 3 p.m. Saturday.
   Schools in several areas were closed for the day and some
classes were dismissed early because of the worsening road
conditions.
   A low pressure system over Utah caused inclement weather in
parts of the West, with snow falling in central and western
Montana, the Yellowstone area of Wyoming and southeast Idaho. Four
inches of snow fell at Red Lodge, Mont.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 34
degrees at Lewistown, Mont., to 90 degrees at Miami, Fla.
   Miami had a record high temperature on Thursday and a record low
of 65 Friday morning. In the afternoon, the temperature climbed
back up to 91 degrees and surpassed the high mark of 90 degrees set
for May 12 in 1985.
   Other record Florida lows were in Fort Lauderdale (60 degrees;
61 in 1953); Hollywood (55 degrees; 65 in 1963); Miami Beach (65
degrees; 65 in 1944). Also registering record lows for the date
were Montgomery, Ala. (43 degrees; 45 in 1952); and Kansas City,
Mo. (40 degrees; 41 in 1979).
   Saturday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms across
much of the Great Plains and into portions of Missouri, Arkansas
and Louisiana; widely scattered showers and thunderstorms from the
northern and central Rockies into portions of the intermountain
region; and showers from the Great Lakes region and upper Ohio
Valley across the northern and central Appalachians to the northern
and middle Atlantic Coast. Showers will be most numerous over New
England, and from the eastern Great Lakes to the central
Appalachians.
   High temperatures were expected in the 50s in portions of the
intermountain region, across much of Montana and Wyoming, the
central Appalachians and in portions of Maine; in the 80s from the
desert Southwest across most of Texas and the Gulf Coast region to
Florida; and in the 60s and 70s elsewhere.

   Engineers opened floodgates wider Tuesday
to release a record flow of water from a flood-burdened reservoir,
and some downstream residents who had not already evacuated called
for help.
   Parts of Arkansas flooded since May 1 were declared a federal
disaster area by President Bush as National Guardsmen labored to
shore up a weakened levee protecting a small town from the Red
River, which continued its steady climb toward a 45-year high.
   In neighboring Louisiana, residents stacked sandbags around
homes near the Red River and some evacuated.
   ``It's bad,'' said Rep. Jim McCrery, R-La., who toured the
flooded regions. ``It's the worst flood we've had here in my
lifetime.''
   Elsewhere, creeks and rivers rose sharply in western and central
Missouri, including the Kansas City area, as thunderstorms
continued to dump heavy rain throughout the region. Many streets
were flooded and more rain was expected.
   Residents of low-lying areas along the Trinity River in
southeastern Texas braced for the worst as engineers at Lake
Livingston Dam cranked open the taps to release a record flow of
88,000 cubic feet per second to protect the dam from a record
flood. Releases of more than 20,000 cfs cause at least some
flooding below the dam.
   The river's crest was expected to reach the dam by Wednesday,
and releases could reach 100,000 cfs that day or Thursday, causing
the worst flooding in 80 years in the small communities downstream.
   Lt. Gen. Henry Hatch of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers flew
over the area Tuesday and said the Lake Livingston Dam appeared to
be working as planned.
   Meanwhile, Gov. Bill Clements asked federal officials to add
four more Texas counties to the 29 listed in a presidential
disaster declaration issued earlier this month because of flooding
and storm damage.
   Many residents of communities south of the dam heeded early
warnings and moved to higher ground, although there were last
minute stragglers who called for help as water covered the roads
out of their subdivisions.
   ``They chose to stay ... now they've become frightened and they
want out,'' said Jim Mitchum, Liberty County emergency management
coordinator, adding that people were helped by the early warnings.
   Flooding along the Trinity began two weeks ago in the
Dallas-Fort Worth area, forcing hundreds of people from their homes.
   The flooding and storms that caused the flooding killed 12
people in Texas and one in Oklahoma, and could cause up to $700
million in agricultural damage in Texas alone, officials estimate.
   In Arkansas, agencies differed on the numbers of houses affected
by flooding on the Arkansas and Red rivers. The state Office of
Emergency Services estimated 493 houses sustained some kind of
flood damage, said spokesman Gary Talley. Red Cross spokesman David
Threkelsen said their count stood at 337 but that surveys were
continuing.
   The president's disaster declaration makes federal funding
available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency to
supplement the recovery of residents and businesses in Crawford,
Faulkner, Jefferson, Little River, Perry, Pulaski and Sebastian
counties.
   The disaster declaration was requested last week by Gov. Bill
Clinton, who renewed the requested Tuesday, saying, ``devastating
flooding unprecedented in recent history continues to this day.''
   Clinton estimated that losses to public and private property
will exceed $20 million.
   Sandbagging continued in earnest on a weakened levee protecting
the town of Garland, Ark., from the Red River, said Talley. The
river had crested in the area, he said, but it probably will be
late Wednesday before it receded.
   National Guard Maj. David Lively said sandbagging along the Red
River could continue until the weekend.
   If the levee breaks near an Army Corps of Engineers' command
post at Garland, a town of about 600 people, ``we'll have time to
sound a horn and tell people to get out,'' said Lt. Bob Page of the
Miller County sheriff's office.
   In Louisiana, about 300 homes have been evacuated along the Red
River from Shreveport southward as the river climbed toward a
45-year high.
   Emergency workers ringed homes with sandbags in a low-lying area
of Shreveport, where the Red was expected to crest Wednesday at
34.8 feet, about 5 feet above flood stage. That will be higher than
a 1957 flood, but not a record.
   Water is expected to cover 600 square miles, including 200
square miles of cropland, said Maj. Jack Scherer of the Corps of
Engineers in Shreveport.
   Water continued to recede in southern and eastern Oklahoma but
additional localized flooding threatened an area of northern
Oklahoma after thunderstorms dumped more than 7 inches of rain
overnight on Elgin, Kan., a small town just across the
Kansas-Oklahoma line.
   That much water ``means some rises on some of the local creeks
and rivers but it's a situation where the rainfall is very
localized, so we really don't expect any widespread flooding,''
said David Andra of the National Weather Service in Norman, Okla.
   In Mississippi, the National Weather Service said the Leaf and
Bowie rivers should drop below flood stage by Wednesday, allowing
37 people who went to a Red Cross Shelter Monday at the University
of Southern Mississippi Sports Arena at Hattiesburg to return home.
   Hattiesburg received 7.97 inches of rain from Saturday night
through Tuesday morning.

   Showers and thunderstorms dampened much of the East and South
today, causing flood warnings or watches to be posted in various
areas.
   Flood warnings because of recent heavy rainfall were posted in
parts of western New York, and a break in a beaver dam caused part
of a road to be washed out at Otsego, N.Y.
   Threats of locally heavy rain from thunderstorms associated with
a weak tropical disturbance led to flood watches in southeast Texas.
   Showers and thunderstorms lingered this morning in southern New
England, eastern New York, eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
Maryland, central Arkansas, Florida and the Louisiana and Texas
coasts.
   North-central Oklahoma, south-central Kansas, northwest Colorado,
Wyoming and parts of Montana also were dampened by showers and
thunderstorms.
   In Alabama, Dallas County officials were preparing for the
possible evacuation of 100 families today with the expected cresting
of the Alabama River after more than a week of steady rainfall. The
river was expected to crest this afternoon at 49 feet, four feet
above flood stage.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
in the central Appalachians, the middle and southern Atlantic Coast,
much of the Gulf Coast and the southern Plains; and showers and
thunderstorms in northern parts of the Rockies and Plains and the
upper Mississippi and lower Missouri valleys.
   Predicted highs: 50s and 60s in the northern Rockies and western
parts of the northern Plains; 90s in the eastern half of the Gulf
Coast, the Tennessee Valley, southwest Texas, the southern Plains
and the interior valleys of California; 100s in the desert
Southwest; and 70s and 80s elsewhere.
   The nation's temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 38 degrees at
Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming to 90 at Phoenix.

   Roads flooded and rivers jumped their banks Friday as
slow-moving storms dumped rain on central and northeast Iowa.
Showers and thunderstorms fell elsewhere in the Midwest, as well as
sections of the East and the West.
   The Iowa River left its banks at Marshalltown, the Cedar River
threatened Waterloo and Cedar Rapids, and the Nishnabotna River in
southwest Iowa was still high as it tried to carry away rain that
fell Thursday.
   High water in creeks and streams continued to drain into the
Cedar, Iowa and Skunk rivers, and produced significant flooding.
   Heavy rainfall Thursday night caused flooding of many streets
and underpasses in Des Moines.
   Iowa rainfall between midnight and 11 a.m. EDT included more
than 3.66 inches in Mason City, 1.43 inches in Waterloo and 1.28
inches in Des Moines.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms fell from northwest and
south-central Texas to southeast Louisiana, northwest Oklahoma,
southeast and northwest Kansas, Nebraska and South Dakota, eastern
Colorado and parts of Montana, as well as New England.
   Showers and thunderstorms also extended over parts of Florida,
the South Carolina coast, Virginia, Delaware and Maryland.
   Ely, Nev., cooled to 40 degrees Friday morning, breaking the
low-temperature record for the date of 41 degrees.
Greenville-Spartanburg, S.C., tied its 65-degree low-temperature
mark.
   The low temperature for the Lower 48 states was 36 degrees in

   Showers and thunderstorms stretched across much of the nation
Monday, causing flooding in Texas and threatening more high water.
Flooding continued in northeastern Iowa.
   In western Texas, the town of Alpine received 2 inches of rain
between 4 a.m. and noon, flooding low-water crossings and railroad
tracks to the west.
   A flood watch was posted for the mountains of western Texas
between the Guadalupe Mountains and Big Bend.
   Summer rains caused major flooding over the weekend in the
northeastern Iowa town of Finchford on the west fork of the Cedar
River.
   The Red Cross set up an emergency shelter at junior high school
in nearby Cedar Falls, but no one had shown up by Monday afternoon.
   The flood's crest was expected to reach Waterloo, about 10 miles
downstream from Finchford, on Monday, and Cedar Rapids, about 50
miles from Finchford, on Thursday. But the National Weather Service
predicted flooding downstream would be less serious.
   Showers and thunderstorms fell Monday in sections of Texas, New
Mexico, Colorado, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Oregon, Lower
Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, Illinois, Alabama, Georgia and northwest
Florida. Scattered showers and storms fell over east-central and

   Heavy rain fell across much of the Southeast on Friday, causing
flooding in Florida and Georgia. In the Northeast, the record heat
wave held on but blowing snow obscured parts of the upper Midwest.
   At midday, showers and thunderstorms extended from southern
Louisiana across southern and central Mississippi, Alabama, the
northwestern two-thirds of Georgia, western South Carolina, western
North Carolina, eastern Tennessee, western Virginia, West Virginia,
the Maryland Panhandle, southwestern through central Pennsylvania
and eastern Ohio.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to noon included 3.6
inches at Milton, Fla.; 2.79 inches at Troy, Ala.; 2.4 inches at
Fort Benning, Ga.; 1.93 inches at Anniston, Ala.; 1.86 inches at

1.36 inches at Marietta, Ga.; 1.34 inches at Asheville, N.C.; and
1.03 inches at Bluefield, W.Va.
   That brought the total rainfall since noon Thursday to 10.63
inches at Mobile and 8.51 inches at Montgomery, Ala.
   Heavy rain closed schools and highways and sent rivers over
their banks in northern Georgia. And as much as 5 more inches of
rain was expected through Saturday as wet weather moves across the
region from the Gulf of Mexico.
   Polk County, Ga., police ordered the evacuation of a trailer
park on the edge of Cedartown, where 4.1 inches of rain fell.
Authorities in Chattooga County reported 16 secondary roads closed
by water and said they did not have enough warning signs to go
around.
   A series of northern Georgia floods beginning Feb. 10 resulted
in at least nine deaths.
   In southern Alabama, schools were closed in Mobile and highways
and homes were flooded.
   Alabama state troopers in Crenshaw County temporarily closed
U.S. Highway 29 between Brantley and Dozier after an earthen dam on
a 3-acre private pond broke. Several homes were evacuated south of
Foley because another dam burst on a private lake.
   No serious injuries were reported, but a Mobile police officer
suffered a leg injury when his patrol car was washed off a highway
into a utility pole.
   In the western Florida Panhandle, flooded roads also stranded
motorists in stalled cars and violent wind caused minor property
damage, authorities said. No injuries were reported.
   A child clinging to a bridge over a swollen creek was rescued in
the Cantonment area about 10 miles north of Pensacola, said Lt.
Keith Edmonson of the Cantonment Volunteer Fire Department.
   In Santa Rosa County, Fla., several roads were closed north of
Milton and a tornado reportedly damaged several trees at Milton,
but there were no injuries or damage to the building, said Peggy
Cheshire, a Civil Defense assistant.
   Friday's record highs, according to the National Weather
Service, were 78 at Atlantic City, N.J.; 76 at Baltimore; 65 at
Binghamton, N.Y.; 68 at Buffalo, N.Y.; 78 at Burlington, Vt.; 82 at
Newark, N.J.; 82 at New York; 71 at Rochester, N.Y.; 78 at
Syracuse, N.Y.; 70 at Worcester, Mass.; and 79 at Windsor Locks,
Conn.
   The heat wave began March 8, starting in Montana and Wyoming,
then spread east and south, followed by cooler air.
   Another part of the nation also had warmer weather Friday _
Barrow, Alaska, posted a record high of 27.
   More seasonable weather dominated the upper Midwest, where snow
fell over northwestern Iowa, eastern South Dakota, eastern North
Dakota and northern Minnesota. Rain fell across eastern Nebraska
and west-central through southwestern Iowa.
   Advisories of blowing and drifting snow were posted over
northeastern North Dakota and west-central and northwestern
Minnesota. Eight to 12 inches of snow fell across that region
Thursday.
   Wind gusted to 62 mph at Chadron, Neb., 59 mph at Rapid City,
S.D., and near 50 mph at Pierre, S.D., during the morning.
   Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr signed a request Friday that
tornado-ravaged south-central Nebraska be declared a federal
disaster area. Adj. Gen. Stanley Heng of the Nebraska National
Guard, who also heads the state Civil Defense, said the overall
damage could be over $10 million.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 24 at
Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 87 at Avon Park, FlA.
   Friday's low for the Lower 48 states was 4 above zero at

early today, causing flooding in parts of Minnesota and New Mexico.
   Rain fell in Minnesota and from southwest Iowa across southeast
Nebraska, Kansas, northwest Oklahoma, western Texas, New Mexico and
Colorado. Showers and thunderstorms also extended from southeast
Louisiana across the Florida Panhandle and along the Florida coast.
   Heavy rainfall caused flooding in Minneapolis and St. Paul, where
streets were covered by as much as a foot of water. The area
received more than an inch of rain in the six hours ending at 2 a.m.
EDT.
   Rains also caused street flooding near Hobbs, N.M.
   Storms dumped rain from northeast New York state into west
central New England, over the northern Pacific Coast and from
eastern Washington across northwest Montana.
   Hail the size of golf balls fell near Fort Ransom, N.D., and
thimble-sized hail fell near Beresford.
   Thunderstorm winds gusted to 70 mph at Hutchinson, Minn., and to
60 mph near both Primghar, Iowa, and Black Wolf, Kan.
   In Lincoln, Neb., an inch and a half of rain fell in 20 minutes
Monday.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms scattered

   Midwesterners mopped up or continued battling flood waters
Sunday after tornadoes, thunderstorms and flooding hit parts of the
region, killing an 11-year-old girl in Iowa and a railroad engineer
in Illinois.
   Tornadoes that roared through South Dakota and Nebraska on
Saturday left damaged or destroyed farm buildings and homes and
uprooted trees in their wake. Up to half a foot of rain fell on
already-sodden ground in Minnesota and Nebraska.
   In eastern Iowa, Clear Creek jumped its banks, closing a
two-mile section of Interstate 80 on Sunday. Flooding knocked out
water service to the small town of Manning in the western part of
the state.
   Damage to just the eastern Iowa cities of Bettendorf and
Davenport along the Mississipi River was $21 million, officials
estimated.
   Heavy rains caused the collapse early Sunday of the roof and
part of a wall at the K&amp;M Manufacturing sheet metal plant in
Marshalltown in central Iowa. No one was at the plant at the time,
and there were no injuries.
   Eight inches of rain have doused Iowa over the past week; some
parts of the state got more than 5 inches of rain in a matter of
hours, said forecaster Scott Truett of the National Weather
Service's Des Moines office.
   Weather service flood specialist Ed May said some rivers were
still rising but predicted there wouldn't be much more flooding
beyond farmland.
   ``It's not unusual to have flooding in June. June's a wet
month,'' he said. ``What's unusual is the extent. We've got almost
all of the rivers in two-thirds of the state above flood stage.
That's kind of rare.''
   Michaella Aguiler, 11, was killed when she was swept into a
culvert in the Davenport suburb of LeClaire on the Mississippi
River, authorities said.
   Gov. Terry Branstad declared seven eastern and central counties
disaster areas on Saturday, and sent the National Guard to help
sandbag low-lying areas as rivers and creeks overflowed. Guard
soldiers remained on flood duty on Sunday.
   Heavy rains lashed western Illinois on Saturday. Thirty-two cars
of an 88-car Burlington Northern freight train derailed when a
waterlogged embankment gave way near Morrison, killing the engineer
and injuring three other railway workers, officials said.
   Train workers were trapped in the engine because the locomotive
car they were in came to rest in about 15 feet of water and mud,
said a Whiteside County sheriff's dispatcher who refused to give
her name.
   The engineer was identified as Samuel Jiardina, 61, of La
Crosse, Wis. The injured were treated and released. Damage was
estimated at $2.1 million, including about 600 feet of damaged
track.
   Scattered thunderstorms pounded parts of northern and
west-central Illinois on Sunday night, but no damage or injuries
were reported.
   In southeastern South Dakota, a tornado hit so fast Saturday, it
knocked out power before warning sirens could be activated in most
areas. The twister left a nine-mile-long, three-mile wide trail of
destruction, but no injuries were reported.
   The tornado damaged 30 farms, five of them seriously, said Fire
Chief T.A. Mullinix in Beresford, 35 miles south of Sioux Falls.
One home lost its roof, Mullinix said. The twister also knocked
down power lines and several buildings and barns in Alcester 10
miles east of Beresford.
   Alcester Police Chief Kevin Booker said he got to activate
warning sirens for a few seconds before power was lost.
   Millinix estimated that damage could total at least $1.2 million.
   In northeast Nebraska, cleanup began Sunday in Madison following
a Saturday night tornado that caused widespread damage just hours
after 60 to 80 people had been evacuated from the other side of
town because of flooding, officials said. Accompanying torrential
rains caused widespread flooding throughout the northeast part of
the state.
   Part of the roof of the IBP Inc. meat packing plant in Madison
was torn off by the storm, said a woman who answered the plant's
phone. She wouldn't give her name.
   ``There are trees down everywhere, roofs off of houses all over
town, and gas lines ruptured,'' said Madison police Officer Mike
Bowersox. ``It moved right through the middle of town.''
   There were no reports of deaths or injuries in the community of
2,000 about 100 miles northwest of Omaha.
   Another tornado touched down farther north near O'Neill earlier
Saturday, damaging two farms, in Nebraska's fifth straight day of
severe storms.
   In the southern Minnesota city of Fairmont, heavy rains flooded
streets because sewers were unable to keep up as winds gusted to 60
mph, the weather service said.
   Flooding also hit the basement of Fairmont Community Hospital,
which had to be pumped out by the fire department, said a hospital
supervisor who refused to give her name. The water posed no threat
to patients, she said.
   ``It looked like hurricane winds for a while,'' the supervisor
said. ``It was really bending the trees.''

   A storm packing powerful winds swept across the Atlantic Coast
on Thursday, drenching an area from Maryland to New Jersey, while
temperatures climbed to record levels in the northern Plains.
   Rivers swelled to near flood stage in Indiana, Ohio and
Michigan, where basements in Delta Township, in south-central
Michigan, were flooded after heavy rain Wednesday.
   The storm produced a record wind gust of 172 mph Wednesday night
on Grandfather Mountain, in western North Carolina. Winds of 69 mph
and gusts to 115 mph were recorded Thursday morning.
   The mid-Atlantic states also had strong winds Thursday, with a
gust of 48 mph at Baltimore and 44 mph at Wrightstown, N.J. A gust
of 46 mph was recorded at Atlanta.
   Gale warnings were in effect for Atlantic coastal waters from

expected to crest at up to 3 feet above flood stage during the next
couple of days, causing flooding of lowlands and secondary roads.
Similar flooding was expected along the Kankakee River in northwest
Indiana.
   Warm temperatures prevailed in the Plains, where readings were
in the 70s and 80s in the Dakotas, eastern portions of Wyoming and
Colorado.
   Temperatures reached record highs in Duluth, Minn., 66; Fargo,
N.D.; 76; Minot, N.D., 80; Rapid City, S.D., 82; and Sioux City,
Iowa, 85. Records were tied in Aberdeen, S.D., 85, and Scottsbluff,
Neb., 82.
   To the northwest, a cold front sent temperatures in western
Montana down to the lower 40s. A winter storm watch for possible
heavy snow was in effect overnight for the mountains of
south-central montana.
   In the desert Southwest, temperatures were in the 80s and lower
90s by midday, and a wind advisory was posted for the deserts of
southern California and southern Nevada.
   A high-wind warning was in effect in extreme western Nevada,
where a gust of 61 mph was recorded at Reno late Thursday morning.
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 37 degrees at Mullan,
Idaho, to 92 degrees at Yuma, Ariz. The morning low was 21 degrees
at Yellowstone Park, Wyo.
   Friday's forecast called for rain from North Carolina across the
mid-Atlantic states to New England, showers and thunderstorms
scattered from the Dakotas across the Nebraska Panhandle and
southeast Wyoming to Colorado, rain and mountain snow in Wyoming,
southeast Idaho and Utah, rain and snow showers in Montana, and
scattered showers in southern Texas.
   Highs temperatures were expected to climb into the 80s from the
lower Mississippi Valley across the central and southern Plains to
the desert Southwest, into the 40s or 50s from North Carolina to
New England and across the central and northern Appalachians to the
Great Lakes, into the 40s and 50s from western portions of the
Dakotas to the Pacific Northwest and into the 60s or 70s elsewhere.

   Thunderstorms drenched West Virginia on Monday, generating floods
that washed out a bridge, and storms threatened to cause flooding in
Kansas and Texas. Showers or thunderstorms fell in much of the rest
of the country.
   The overnight storms that brought heavy rain to West Virginia
were part of a system stretching along the Ohio Valley. Three inches
of rain fell in Webster Springs, W.Va., and more than 2 inches fell
in Edray.
   Flood waters washed out a temporary construction bridge near
Bergoo in the eastern section of the state, and roads were flooded
near Persinger, Canvas, Nettie and Mingo.
   A flash flood watch was in effect for most of southern Kansas as
thunderstorms continued developing from southeast Kansas to central
Missouri.
   In central Missouri, overnight storms dropped more than 4 inches
of rain on Gravois Mills and 3} inches on Decaturville. Heavier
rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT included more
than an inch and a half at Cape Girardeau, Mo.
   In western Texas, showers and thunderstorms kept falling after an
early-morning thunderstorm that dumped nearly 2{ inches on Alpine
and nearly an inch at Marfa. A flash flood watch was in effect in
southwest Texas.
   Thunderstorms also struck sections of New England, New York and
Pennsylvania. Scattered showers and thunderstorms spread over the
eastern half of the Gulf Coast to Florida and the southern Atlantic
Coast, and over eastern portions of the Dakotas. Scattered showers
fell in Oregon, western Montana and northern Idaho.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 57
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 96 degrees in Cotulla
and Beeville, Texas, Phoenix and Meridian, Miss.
   The low temperature in the lower 48 states Monday morning was 29
degrees in Gunnison, Colo.
   The forecast for Tuesday called for showers and thunderstorms
from the upper Mississippi Valley to the upper Great Lakes region,
the Ohio Valley and the middle Atlantic Coast, with thunderstorms
most likely from Wisconsin to northern Illinois, Indiana, western
Ohio and West Virginia; scattered showers and thunderstorms from the
eastern half of the Gulf Coast to the southern Atlantic Coast and in
west Texas; showers across the Pacific Northwest; and strong, gusty
winds across the northern Rockies.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 60s and 70s in the
Pacific Northwest and along the California coast; in the 70s from
northeast Minnesota to much of the Great Lakes and northern New
England, as well as in sections of the central Rockies; the 90s from
the southern Atlantic Coast to the Gulf Coast, the Tennessee and
lower Mississippi valleys, the lower Missouri Valley, much of the
Plains and the inland valleys of central and Southern California;
more than 100 degrees across the desert Southwest along the Big Bend
of the Rio Grande in Texas; and in the 80s in much of the rest of
the nation.

   Rain fell across much of the nation today, encompassing the
central Plains, the Midwest and the East, while fair conditions
prevailed in the West.
   Hail the size of marbles fell Tuesday at Stover, Mo., and south
of Navarre, Kan. Golf ball-size hail hit near Millerstown, Ky, near
Munfordville, Ky., at Bridgeton, Mo., Villa Ridge, Mo.,
Campbellsville, Ky., Arnold Mo., Columbia Ill., and Wichita, Kan.
   Damage from wind gusts accompanying thunderstorms was reported
southwest of Louisville, Ky., and near Columbia and Troy, both in
Missouri.
   Winds gusted to about 70 mph at Denver and Marshall, Mo., to 65
mph at Trenton, Ill., and to 60 mph at St Louis and near Vandalia,
Mo.
   Winds also gusted to 61 mph at Guadalupe Pass between Carlsbad,
N.M. and El Paso, Texas.
   Showers and thunderstorms lingered late Tuesday in parts of the
Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, Washington state,
Montana, Oklahoma, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Arkansas, missouri,
Illinois, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Indiana,
Pennsylvania.
   Storms also extended from northeast New York state across
northern New England.
   Tornados killed a child, injured at least 14 others and damaged
scores of buildings in northern and western Oklahoma on Tuesday.
   Water from a swollen reservoir tumbled through floodgates in an
ever more powerful flow today, threatening to swamp 200 square
miles of southeastern Texas.
   Parts of Arkansas flooded since May 1 were declared a disaster
area Tuesday by President Bush as National Guardsmen worked to
shore up a weakened levee protecting a small town from the Red
River, which climbed toward a 45-year high.
   There was serious flooding along the little Blue, the Blue and
Platte rivers around Kansas City, Mo. Highways were closed by
flooding near Lees Summit, Smithville, and Independence, all in
Missouri.
   The little Blue was expected to crest as much as 26 feet higher
than flood stage.
   Flood warnings remained along the upper and middle reaches of
the Marais des Cygnes River in Kansas. The crest was expected to
reach Quenemo, Kan., Tuesday night, nearly 7 feet over flood stage,
and Pomona, Kan., today, about 2 feet over flood stage.
   Major flooding continued along the lower half of the middle Red
River basin. The river's predicted crest of about 7 feet higher
than flood stage at Coushatta, La., was expected to be higher than
the 1957 flood but about 2 feet lower than the record flood of 1945.
   A flood warning was posted for the little Miami River at
Milford, Ohio, and the river was out of its banks and flooding the
road near Loveland.
   Flooding also was reported at Greensurg, Ky., Tuesday evening.
   A few temperatures were unseasonably high. Records for the date
were set or tied in several cities, including Fort Myers, Fla, with
96 degrees, breaking the 95-degree record set in 1985.
   The nation's high temperature Tuesday _ 104 degrees _ was
recorded at Presidio and Lajitas, both in Texas.

<HEAD>Heavy Rain in Plains, Record Cold in Parts of Northeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The summer of 1988 took an uncharacteristic turn Monday as
thunderstorms dumped heavy rain on parts of the Plains and
overnight temperatures hit record lows in parts of the Northeast.
   Storms buffeted several Plains states with gusty winds and heavy
rain, helping to replenish some drought-sapped soil and causing
some isolated flooding in parts of Iowa.
   In northwest Iowa, Sioux Center recorded over 6{ inches of rain
overnight and Monday morning. The downpour pushed the Floyd River
at least 1 foot above flood stage in places and caused minor
lowland flooding. Several other locations in that corner of the
state reported at least 3 inches of rain by morning.
   ``It might help the lawns some,'' said Keith Hora, president of
the National Corn Growers Association. ``And the football fields
will be green. But the corn is history.''
   The rain should help late-maturing bean crops and activate
herbicides, preventing carryover chemical damage next season, Hora
said.
   Elsewhere in Iowa, Des Moines got an inch and two-thirds of rain
in the six hours ended at 2 p.m. EDT while Waterloo, Ottumwa and
Cedar Rapids had about 1\ inches. St. Cloud, Minn., recorded 1{
inches in the same period.
   Morning thunderstorm winds gusted to 63 mph at the Omaha, Neb.,
airport.
   Midday showers and thunderstorms also hit northeast Colorado,
northwest Kansas, eastern Nebraska, southeastern South Dakota,
Minnesota, Iowa, northwest Missouri, northeast Illinois and
Wisconsin.
   Showers and thunderstorms also remained over the Gulf Coast and
the northern half of Florida and along the Georgia and South
Carolina coast.
   Astoria, Ore., set a record high for the date with a reading of
78 degrees.
   Several other cities set cold records with their early morning
lows. Syracuse, N.Y., hit a low of 43 degrees; Youngstown, Ohio,
39; Boise, Idaho, 45. Harrisburg, Pa., tied its low of 50.
   Frost was expected Monday night in the Adirondack Mountains of
New York and the Green Mountains of Vermont.
   At 3 p.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 56 degrees at Crescent
City, Calif., to 103 degrees at Manhattan, Kan. The nation's low
Monday morning was 25 degrees at West Yellowstone, Mont.
   Tuesday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
Great Lakes to the Ohio Valley, and from southern Louisiana to
northern and central Florida. Showers and thunderstorms also were
expected over southeast Missouri and central Arizona.
   Highs were forecast to be in the 60s in eastern New England; in
the 70s from the rest of New England to the Virginia coast and
across the Great Lakes to northern Minnesota and North Dakota; in
the 70s and 80s along the California coast; and in the 80s from
western Pennsylvania to Georgia, in the Ohio Valley and most of the
middle and upper Mississippi Valley and central and northern
Plains, the southern Rockies, the upper Missouri Valley and
northwest Washington state.
   Highs were predicted to be near 100 degrees from north-central
Texas to southern Oklahoma and Arkansas, and over southwest Oregon;
and near 110 in the desert Southwest. Highs elsewhere were expected
to be in the 90s.

<TEXT>
   Heavy rains caused flooding in the lower Ohio Valley and the
Southeast on Sunday, but fair weather prevailed over much of the
central and western United States.
   Minor flooding from the Licking River was reported at Blue Lick
Springs, Ky. The river was expected to crest 3 feet above flood
stage late Sunday. The Salt River in Kentucky and rivers in
Tennessee also were forecast to go above flood stage.
   The Forked Deer River at Jackson, Tenn., was 2 feet above flood
stage and was expected to crest by early Monday. The Hatchie River
at Bolivar, Tenn., was over 4 feet above flood stage and was
expected to crest Monday, the National Weather Service said.
   The Tennessee River was 3 feet above flood stage at Florence,
Ala., where a highway underpass was covered with 2 to 3 feet of
water.
   But across much of the nation, temperatures were seasonable to
just above normal.
   Record temperatures for the date were set in Beaufort, S.C., with
78 degrees, and Portland, Maine, 49 degrees, while Charleston, S.C.,
tied a record with 77 degrees.
   Cold air was restricted to the northern Plains and central
Rockies, where readings were in the single digits and teens.
Oakland, Calif., set a record temperature for the date with 36
degrees, breaking the 37-degree mark set four years ago.
   Rain showers and drizzle were widely scattered along the southern
Atlantic coast from Georgia to eastern North Carolina. Rain also
fell along the central and northern Pacific coast.
   Snow fell over interior portions of Washington and Oregon.
Accumulations ranging from 6 to 14 inches were recorded in the
Cascade Mountains. Jackson Hole, Wyo., received 3 inches of snow.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 0
degrees at Warroad, Minn., to 84 degrees at Fort Myers, Fla., and
Daytona Beach, Fla. The low in the nation Sunday morning was 16
degrees below zero at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Monday, the forecast called for rain showers lingering along
the Atlantic coast from southeast Georgia to New York City. Snow
showers were to occur over much of central and southern New England,
New York state and Upper Michigan. Rain was expected over the
Pacific Northwest with snow occurring over higher elevations. Winds
were to continue to be strong and gusty along the east slopes of the
northern Rockies.
   High temperatures were to be in the teens in northern Minnesota
and northeastern North Dakota; in the 20s and 30s over the northern
and central intermountain region, the central Rockies, and from the
northern Plains across the the Great Lakes and the central and
northern Appalachians to New England; in the 60s over southern
California, southern Arizona, and from the Gulf Coast of Louisiana
east to the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina; and in the 70s and
80s over the Florida Peninsula. The remainder of the nation will
generally have high temperatures in the 40s and 50s.

   Flash floods turned streets into rivers in Hot Springs, Ark.,
and pushed lakes out of their banks, sweeping away cars and
stranding residents of lakefront homes on rooftops in yet another
onslaught of high water.
   The flooding followed thunderstorms that began Saturday
afternoon and brought up to a foot of rain and high winds to
central Arkansas by early Sunday morning. The water receded by late
morning, revealing extensive damage along this resort city's
central business district, authorities said.
   ``Cars have been completely immersed and washed away. We've got
a lot of shops and stores that are flooded,'' said police spokesman
Michael McCormick.
   The new floods brought misery to a different part of the region
from the rampage along the Arkansas, Trinity and Red rivers that
has caused hundreds of millions of dollars in losses and killed 13
people in the past three weeks in Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma and
Louisiana. Floodwaters continued to surge through southern segments
of that region Sunday.
   Floods eased in Missouri, Kansas, Illinois and Indiana. At least
two people died in Illinois, and authorities searched for a woman
missing in flooding in Missouri last week.
   In some parts of Hot Springs, the water had reached the tops of
parking meters before beginning to recede.
   The storms dumped up to 12 inches of rain in Garland and Hot
Spring counties Saturday night and early Sunday. The National
Weather Service said 2 feet of water was pouring over the top of
Remmel Dam at Lake Catherine.
   The storms also brought four tornadoes, including a twister that
destroyed one home, damaged another and destroyed a barn in nearby
Conway County. No injuries were reported. Hail pelted a number of
central Arkansas counties.
   Floodgates at the Remmel Dam and the Carpenter Dam upstream on
Lake Hamilton were fully opened to release water from the lakes
into the Ouachita River. ``They've all overflowed their banks,''
said Ralph Lee, assistant director of Garland County Office of
Emergency Services.
   Residents of low-lying areas in Garland County left their homes
and sought shelter at a National Guard armory and churches, Lee
said. He said there was no estimate available on the number of
people evacuated.
   ``The hardest hit areas are the ones closest to the lakes,'' Lee
said. ``A lot of the lakefront homes have been evacuated and the
ones who waited too late are on top of their homes.''
   Residents were still being rescued from rooftops by boat Sunday
morning.
   The floods caused power outages throughout Hot Springs, and
washed away a landmark 90-year-old iron bridge and at least eight
other bridges in the area.
   Gov. Bill Clinton declared Garland County a state disaster area
after inspecting flood damage in Hot Springs, making assistance
available to flood victims.
   The county was also added, along with Clay County, to a federal
disaster declaration covering 20 other counties hit by flooding,
said Ray Briggler of the state Office of Emergency Services.
   In southeastern Texas, tempers began flaring in flooded
communities along the Trinity River, where sheriffs' deputies were
keeping an eye on joyriders in boats and recreational vehicles.
   ``We've had a couple of incidents that haven't been bad, but
some of the teen-agers, they want to go out with their four-wheel
drives and things,'' said Liberty County sheriff's dispatcher Jo
Griffith. ``We go out and talk to them and tell them they're not
really helping.''
   Waves from boat wakes can cause more damage to flooded homes,
and property owners are angry, said Jim Mitchum of the Liberty
County emergency management office.
   Mitchum said 500 to 700 people per day were being fed from the
county's emergency mobile kitchen and about 60 people stayed at
emergency shelters overnight Saturday in Liberty County. At least
2,000 homes are in 15 to 20 subdivisions in the floodwaters' path,
but Mitchum did not have an estimate on how many actually are
flooded.
   Forty-nine families have not evacuated from subdivisions.
``They're staying in against our recommendation,'' Mitchum said.
   Closer to the Lake Livingston Dam, sheriffs dispatchers in San
Jacinto and Polk County said about 100 homes sustained flood
damage. Many are under water.
   Engineers Sunday were still releasing 100,800 cubic feet per
second of water through the dam, which remained a foot over flood
stage, the Trinity River Authority said. Usually, about 7,000 cfs
of water goes through the dam and 20,000 cfs is enough to cause
flooding.
   Engineers expected the 100,000-plus level to be sustained for at
least the next few days, Mitchum said.
   The Trinity at Liberty is expected to crest at 29{ feet, 5{ feet
above flood stage, by the end of next week and remain at that level
for at least several days, the weather service said.
   In east-central Louisiana, a dike built by hundreds of
volunteers at Vick was credited with saving 30,000 acres and about
300 homes from the raging Red. A similar dirt dike covered with
plastic was expected to protect 300 to 400 homes and 50,000 acres
of cropland.
   About 370 people in five northwestern Louisiana parishes have
had to leave their homes because of flooding by the Red. The river
is expected to crest about 7 feet above flood stage Monday at
Alexandria, and the weather service warned residents to be alert.
   Elsewhere:
   _ In Sioux City, Iowa, firefighters and public works crews
Sunday helped homeowners clean up from a flood by Perry Creek the
day before that left oozing mud several feet deep in parts of the
city. Three bridges remained closed and two may have to be rebuilt.
   Gov. Terry Branstad has declared the city a state disaster area.
   _ The search continued Sunday near Jefferson City, Mo., for a
woman who may have been swept away Thursday by floodwaters on the
Moreau River. The Mississippi River at St. Louis crested at 33
feet, 3 feet above flood stage, and was expected to drop 6 feet by
Tuesday.
   _ In southern Illinois, several homes in Lawrenceville were
evacuated because of the rising Embarras River, which was expected
to crest almost 11 feet above flood stage Sunday.
   _ Rivers continued dropping in southern Indiana. The weather
service predicted an end by Thursday to flooding that last week
reached the highest levels in more than 20 years in some places.
   Flooding on the White River late Friday washed away at least
3,000 feet of water lines in Petersburg. People in the
3,500-resident town were urged to boil water for drinking and
cooking, and water was brought in by tanker truck.

   Heavy thunderstorms and tornadoes crimped cleanup efforts on
Tuesday by Iowa and South Dakota residents who are still reeling
from weekend weather, and Nebraska reported its first fatality from
recent floods.
   After morning rains added 1 to 2 inches to watersheds of flooded
rivers, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad added 11 counties to 22 already
declared disaster areas. That brings the total to one-third of the
state's 99 counties.
   The National Weather Service said no appreciable additional
flooding was expected. Three deaths in Iowa have been blamed on the
most recent storms.
   Police in Des Moines asked employers to send workers home early
because storm sewers had backed up, clogging major streets leading
out of downtown.
   In the central Iowa town of Jewell, about 55 miles north of Des
Moines, a tornado struck the center building at South Hamilton High
School, where maintenance worker Don Strangeland recounted the
damage: ``I heard the roof just peeling off the school.''
   Just a little north of there in Webster City, another tornado
destroyed outbuildings and killed about 30 hogs on a 700-acre farm.
   ``Two months ago, we were concerned about the drought and now
here we are faced with major flooding,'' the governor said.
   Branstad said agricultural damage could be severe unless flood
waters recede soon. ``There's a considerable amount that's been
flooded, and it's getting very late as far as replanting,'' he said.
   Thunderstorms on Monday night also carried heavy rain across the
central and eastern part of South Dakota, where residents were
still cleaning up from Saturday night's violent weather.
   Cleanup efforts continued in the southeastern South Dakota towns
of Beresford and Alcester where a tornado swept through the area
causing more than $1 million in damage to 24 farms.
   In Alcester, neighbors spent Sunday and Monday helping each
other out, Police Chief Kevin Booker said. Residents with pickups
helped haul away trees that blocked up to one-third of the streets
in town.
   In the country, neighbors helped remove debris so farmers could
get back to their fields to replant crops torn up from the tornado
and high winds.
   A 77-year-old West Point, Neb., man was found drowned,
apparently the first person to die in flood waters that have
plagued northeast Nebraska for nearly a week. A relative found the
body 1{ blocks from the man's home, two miles south of West Point
near the Elkhorn River, said Cuming County Sheriff Larry Thiem.
   More storms ravaged south-central and northeastern Nebraska on
Monday night, causing authorities to ask residents of King Lake in
northern Douglas County to evacuate as the Elkhorn River reached
flood stage.
   Floods also struck further east.
   In Pennsylvania, thunderstorms moved throughout the state
saturating farmland, flooding basements and causing scattered power
outages, authorities said. No injuries were reported.
   The heaviest thunderstorms were reported in Rosencrans, Clinton
County, and Ohiopyle, Fayette County, the weather service said.
   About 200 McKean County residents were without power in several
small afternoon outages caused by lightning and downed power lines,
said Bill Manning, a foreman for Pennsylvania Electric Co.
   And in eastern Ohio, recovery efforts continued in the Ohio
River town of Shadyside, where flash floods last week killed 21
people.

   Flooding in Vermont destroyed a house, at least two bridges and
several highways on Saturday, and 85 mph winds wreaked havoc in the
Midwest.
   Much of the nation got wet. Showers and thunderstorms were
reported in Colorado, New Mexico, the Texas Panhandle, Kansas,
Missouri, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky,
Virginia, North Carolina and northern New England.
   Overnight heavy rain sent the Stevens Branch River at Barre,
Vt., over its banks. There was also flooding on the Winooski River
between Montpelier and Middlebury and at the Dog River at
Montpelier.
   Heavy rain caused several mudslides between Hancock and
Middlebury. In Plainsfield, flooding damaged or destroyed a house,
two bridges and several roads.
   In Iowa, there were numerous reports of thunderstorm winds and
damage. Gusts hit 85 mph at Carroll, 80 mph at Boone, 70 mph at
Perry and Urbandale and 60 mph at Adair. Hail up to an inch in
diameter fell.
   Near Ponca, Neb., hail and winds gusting over 60 mph caused
extensive crop damage.
   Thunderstorm gusts damaged trees and power lines near the
Wisconsin towns of Broadhead and Albany. Golf ball-size hail fell
in Avon, Ind.
   Heavier rainfall by 2 p.m. EDT included 3 inches at Mount
Washington, N.H.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 59
degrees at San Simeon, Calif., to 100 degrees at Needles, Calif.
   The low for the Lower 48 states was 35 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   Sunday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms in New
England, New Jersey, the northern and central Appalachians, the
lower Great Lakes region, the Ohio Valley, southern Illinois,
western Tennessee and Arkansas.
   Temperatures were expected to be much lower from the upper Great
Lakes to Illinois and the central Mississippi Valley.
   Highs were forecast in the 60s from upper Michigan to northeast
Minnesota and in the 70s for northern Illinois, the remainder of
the upper Mississippi Valley, Wyoming and northern California; in
the 80s in New England, New York, the Great Lakes, the lower Ohio
Valley, Missouri, Kansas, the Texas Panhandle, central Arizona,
Colorado, Montana, Washington and southern Californial; between 100
and 105 degrees in parts of Texas and near 110 degrees in the

   Flash floods swept through 50 villages
and drowned at least two people after heavy rains forced tributaries
of the Brahmaputra River over their banks, officials said today.
   The floods began Monday in the northern and eastern regions of
the country after monsoon rains swelled the rivers, Relief Ministry
officials said. They said at least 50 villages were flooded, and
rice crops were damaged.
   At least two people were washed away by rising water in the
Bandarban district 150 miles southeast of Dhaka, police in the area
said.
   Sangbad, a Dhaka-based newspaper, said at least 20,000 people
were marooned by the floods in the northern district of Rangpur. It
said they took refuge on high ground or roofs.
   Bangladesh, a low-lying country of 110 million people, is
criss-crossed by hundreds of rivers that form the deltas of the
Brahmaputra and the Ganges rivers. The summer monsoons usually cause
flooding.
   Last year, floods inundated about four-fifths of Bangladesh, and
at least 1,400 people were killed. At least 2.3 million people were
left homeless.

   Rain fell across the Atlantic states Tuesday, and thunderstorms
in the Carolinas caused flooding and spun off tornadoes.
   In South Carolina, strong wind and heavy rain forced the
evacuation of 20 families from a mobile home park, injured at least
five people and flooded some roads under several feet of water,
authorities said.
   North Carolina had at least two tornadoes and record amounts of
rain that swelled rivers to flood stage. The tornadoes caused no
injuries but one man was killed when his car went off a bridge that
was knocked out by a train derailed by flood-damaged track.
   Flooding also was reported at Dover, Pa., where Conewago Creek
was out of its banks, the National Weather Service said. Six roads
were closed by flooding in Carroll County, Md., and local flooding
was reported in Washington.
   In addition to the Atlantic states, rain and occasional
thunderstorms also spread over the upper Ohio Valley and the
northern and central Appalachians.
   Light rain was scattered across south-central Iowa, northwest
Missouri, southeast Nebraska and northeast Kansas.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT was 1.78
inches at Cape Hatteras, N.C.; 1.30 inches at Williamsport, Pa.;
1.28 inches at Virginia Beach, Va.; and 1.24 inches at New Bern,

   Tornadoes forced the evacuation today of about 20 residents in a
north central Ohio village and also were sighted in Wisconsin,
Florida, North Carolina, Illinois and Michigan.
   In rural North Woodbury, Ohio, a tornado destroyed an
undetermined number of houses and buildings Friday in the village
of about 75 people, said Morrow County Disaster Services director
Dick Williams.
   Tornadoes also were reported in South Mills, N.C.; Gull Lake,
Mich.; Sullivan, Wis.; Germantown Hills, Ill., and east of St.
Petersburg, Fla.
   Elsewhere, much of the nation endured thunderstorms, and hot,
humid conditions Friday. Thunderstorms produced three-quarter inch
diameter hail near Greensboro, N.C., and almost one-inch hail near
Huffman, Ala.. Hail the size of golf balls fell on Cottondale,
Ala., and Tuscaloosa, Ala.
   Damage from thunderstorm wind gusts was reported in Virginia,
northern and central North Carolina, northwestern South Carolina,
northern Georgia, northern Alabama, northern Mississippi, and
southwest Indiana.
   Heavy rain caused flooding in several Vermont locations and
Littleton, N.H. In Melbourne, Fla., 2.6 inches of rain fell between
5:30 and 6:30 p.m. Friday.
   In Wisconsin, the Fox River closed a county road near
Wrightstown, Wis., with 8 feet of water, and there were many of
reports of flooding in and around Green Bay, where 2.86 inches of
rain fell.
   Rain showers and thunderstorms fell Friday night from western
New York across Pennsylvania, as well as West Virginia, Virginia,
Maryland, Delaware, North and South Carolina, Florida, northern
Georgia, northern Alabama, central Mississippi, southern Arkansas
and Louisiana.
   Showers and thunderstorms also extended over Tennessee,
Kentucky, Ohio and eastern Indiana. Rain showers and thunderstorms
reached from lower Michigan across northwest Illinois, northeast
Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, eastern North Dakota, eastern
South Dakota and eastern Nebraska.
   Rain showers and thunderstorms were scattered throughout
northern Texas and from northwest Montana across the northern
Pacific Coast.
   The high temperature for the nation today was 118 degrees at
Laughlin, Nev. Temperatures climbed to 114 degrees in Beeville,

   Severe thunderstorms raked parts of the Midwest Saturday,
causing widespread flooding and at least two deaths in Iowa and
Illinois. Tornadoes destroyed five houses in South Dakota and
ripped through a Nebraska town.
   Hundreds of Iowans were forced to evacuate their homes when up
to 6 inches of rain fell over parts of the state, and roads and
bridges were washed out. An 11-year-old girl was killed when she
was swept into a culvert in the Davenport suburb of LeClaire on the
Mississippi River, Scott County authorities said.
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad declared seven eastern and central
counties disaster areas and sent the National Guard to help sandbag
low-lying areas as rivers and creeks overflowed.
   The Weather Service said more thunderstorms and heavy rain were
likely overnight as a front of moist, unstable air moved through
the upper Midwest.
   In South Dakota, a tornado ripped a nine-mile path through
Beresford, 35 miles south of Sioux Falls, damaging 30 to 50 homes,
said Beresford Fire Chief T.A. Mullinex. He said about five homes
were destroyed but no deaths or injuries were reported.
   In Nebraska, a tornado hit the northeastern town of Madison
Saturday night, causing widespread damage just hours after areas
had been evacuated because of flooding, officials said.
   Part of the roof of the IBP Inc. meat packing plant was torn off
by the storm, said a woman who answered the plant's phone. She
wouldn't give her name.
   ``There are trees down everywhere, roofs off of houses all over
town, and gas lines ruptured,'' said Madison police Officer Mike
Bowersox. ``It moved right through the middle of town.''
   He said there were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries in
the community of 2,000 about 100 miles northwest of Omaha. Another
tornado touched down further north near O'Neill earlier Saturday,
damaging two farms, in Nebraska's fifth straight day of severe
storms.
   Heavy rains also lashed western Illinois Saturday. A train
engineer was killed and three people were injured when a Burlington
Northern freight engine derailed at a washed-out bridge near
Morrison, Ill., authorities said.
   ``The train collapsed the weakened bridge and the two engines
with approximately 28 cars began a chain reaction collision,'' said
a Whiteside County sheriff's dispatcher. ``Workers were trapped in
the engine because they came to rest in about 15 feet of water and
mud from the swollen ditch.''
   The engineer's identity was not released. The injured were
treated at a hospital and released.
   In Iowa, scattered flooding was reported throughout the state.
Branstad declared Polk, Warren, Dallas and Jasper counties in
central Iowa and Johnson, Scott and Muscatine counties in eastern
Iowa disaster areas.
   Six inches of rain overnight brought the Raccoon River out of
its banks. The river was expected to crest at 22 feet on Sunday, 11
feet above flood stage. The crest was expected to reach Van Meter
in central Iowa Sunday, nine feet above flood stage and slightly
higher than the record set in 1958. The river was expected to crest
at Des Moines near its 1947 record.
   All roads between Des Moines and west Des Moines were blocked
except Interstate 235 and police were going door to door in
low-lying areas offering evacuation help.
   A thunderstorm packing winds of at least 80 mph struck the
Ottumwa area in southeast Iowa shortly after 2 p.m., damaging trees
and at least two homes and downing power lines.
   A new outdoor storm warning system failed when the weather
service asked officials to activate it after a tornado was sighted.
Ottumwa Police Sgt. Jim Clark said the failure apparently was
caused by an electrical power surge from intense lightning.
   Travel was considered extremely dangerous all over eastern Iowa.
   In Cedar County, motorists along Interstate 80 between Durant
and Stockton were trapped inside and on top of floating cars, a
State Patrol spokesman said.

   Mudslides caused by rivers swollen in the
summer monsoon killed 16 people and left thousands homeless in a
remote, hilly state, news reports said Monday.
   United News of India said 10 people and four soldiers were buried
in landslides Thursday in West Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh
state, about 900 miles east of New Delhi.
   Two people died Friday in the neighboring Bomdilla district in
floods caused by heavy rains since the monsoon came earlier this
month, the news agency said.
   It said the homeless are being cared for in relief camps in
Arunachal Pradesh and nearby Assam state, where the Brahmaputra
River had topped the danger mark.
   In neighboring Bangladesh, the River Gumti spilled over its
embankment and swept away thousands of mud-and-straw huts in about
100 villages, officials said Monday.
   About 50,000 people were left homeless, they said.
   The deluge inundated several thousand acres of crops in the
district, 55 miles southeast of Dhaka, according to a provincial
official who arrived in the capital Monday.
   Many people were marooned on roofs of houses and hundreds are
camped on roads and along unbroken portions of the embankment while
rain continued Monday, he said.
   Bangladesh, a low-lying country, is crossed by hundreds of rivers
that form the deltas of the Brahmaputra and the Ganges, the two
major rivers of the Indian subcontinent.
   Officials said Monday the two rivers will keep rising in the next
24 hours.
   Floods triggered by the summer monsoon are a seasonal disaster in
India, Nepal and Bangladesh.
   Last year, floods inundated about four-fifths of Bangladesh and
at least 1,400 people were killed. At least 2.3 million people were
left homeless.

   Thunderstorms moved across the nation's midsection Friday,
bringing heavy rains to already drenched areas of Kansas, Nebraska,
Iowa and Missouri.
   Showers and thunderstorms also increased along the Texas
coastline, southwest Texas and near the east coast of Florida.
   The season's first snowfall was reported Friday morning in the
Big Horn mountains of north-central Wyoming. Burgess Junction, about
30 miles west of Sheridan, reported 2 inches of snow.
   Thunderstorms over southeast Nebraska were part of a much larger
area of showers and thunderstorms extending from northern Kansas and
southern Nebraska, across southern Iowa and northern Missouri into
central Indiana.
   The area around Lincoln, Neb., where 3-5 inches of rain fell, was
particularly hard hit. The Holmes Park area of Lincoln was drenched
by over 8{ inches of rain Friday morning, causing flooding.
   In Ottawa, Kan., a construction trailer was flipped over by
strong winds during an isolated thunderstorm at the Ottawa Municipal
Airport. A worker inside the trailer was bruised but escaped serious
injury.
   Flash flood warnings were posted Friday night for parts of
Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa and northwest Missouri. Strong thunderstorms
passing through central Indiana caused street flooding in
Crawfordsville.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered across the central
Rockies and were spreading into the central high Plains. Golf
ball-size hail pelted Fort Carson, Colo., during a severe
thunderstorm Friday afternoon. Marble-size hail fell in Pueblo, Colo.
   Abundant sunshine, hot temperatures and high humidity prevailed
from the southern Plains and southern parts of Kansas and Missouri
to the mid- and southeast Atlantic Coast.
   Heavier rainfall during the 6 hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT included
2{ inches at Omaha, Neb., and over 2 inches at Lincoln, Neb..
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 44
degrees at Cody, Wyo., to 99 degrees at Phoenix. The low in the
nation Friday was 27 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   The forecast for Saturday called for showers and thunderstorms
from eastern sections of the central Plains to the Great Lakes and
northern parts of the Ohio Valley; scattered showers and
thunderstorms over the northern Rockies, northern Colorado and the
northern Plains; and scattered thunderstorms over the central and
eastern Gulf of Mexico coastline.
   Temperatures were expected to be unseasonably cool _ in the 50s
and 60s _ from the northern Rockies through the upper Mississippi
Valley; in the 90s from the southeastern states across the Tennessee
Valley, the lower Mississippi Valley to the southern Plains and
southern New Mexico and the interior valleys of central California;
and 100 to 105 degrees over the desert Southwest. Highs in the
remainder of the nation were expected in the 70s and 80s.

<HEAD>Monsoon Floods Kill 74 in India, Dislocate 500,000 in Bangladesh</HEAD>

   Heavy monsoon rains over the past week
in western and northern India have killed at least 74 people and
washed away hundreds of houses, news reports said Sunday.
   In neighboring Bangladesh, about 500,000 people were either
homeless or stranded because of floods.
   Press Trust of India said air force helicopters were dropping
food packets to marooned villagers in western Rajasthan state where
the rains caused the Jajori River to overrun its banks.
   The summer monsoon causes floods in many parts of the Indian
subcontinent every year. In Bangladesh, where two major rivers of
the subcontinent form a delta before emptying into the Bay of
Bengal, floods are a perennial problem.
   In 1988, at least 1,400 people died because of flooding in
Bangladesh.
