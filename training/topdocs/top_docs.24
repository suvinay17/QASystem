  [Text] Brasilia, 21 Mar -- Bolivian Foreign Minister 
Antonio Aranibar said here today that U.S. Vice President Al 
Gore is interested in knowing the positions of Bolivia, 
Argentina, and Brazil regarding the continental summit organized 
by U.S. President Bill Clinton for December in Miami. 
  Bolivia was the first country visited by Gore on his tour to 
these three countries. Aranibar met with the U.S. vice 
president during the eight hours he was in Bolivia yesterday 
before traveling to Buenos Aires, where he finds himself today. 
  Aranibar told EFE that Gore had expressed his wish to 
receive 
from the Latin American leaders "topics for the future 
inter-American dialogue," an initiative that demands appropriate 
preparation. 
  Gore also discussed drug enforcement with Bolivian President 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and other Bolivian personalities, 
although it was "not the central subject" of conversation, 
Aranibar said. 
  Following his visit to Bolivia, Gore is currently in Buenos 
Aires, from where he will travel to Brasilia, the last leg of 
his Latin American tour. He will stay in Brasilia for six hours. 
  The Bolivian foreign minister arrived today on an official 
flight from La Paz to attend a meeting of the foreign ministers 
of the Rio Group. The Rio Group is made up of 13 members: 
Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela, 
Paraguay, Uruguay, Mexico, Ecuador, Guatemala (representing 
Central America), and Trinidad and Tobago (representing the 
Caribbean). 
  The 48-hour Rio Group meeting began today at Itamaraty 
Palace, and is being held precisely to discuss positions for the 
summit organized by Clinton, and for a preliminary document 
prepared by experts from several governments and the Economic 
Commission for Latin America, ECLA, on "poverty, the neglected 
sectors, and unemployment." 
  Regarding the summit in Miami, Aranibar said that the 
countries of the continent must prepare "an agenda for the new 
world" which must include the main subjects that will dominate 
the inter-American dialogue in the next few years. 
  He also said that certain subjects connected with economic 
and social development, as well as regional integration -- 
including the possible membership of other Latin American 
countries to the North American Free Trade Agreement among the 
United States, Canada, and Mexico -- must also be included in 
the agenda. 
  According to Aranibar, the inter-American subjects for the 
Miami summit must include participative democracy, the struggle 
against corruption, the stability and solidness of the 
democratic institutions, and rational development.

LANDLOCKED Bolivia's 113 year-old dream of an exit to the Pacific is set to
become reality today when Bolivian and Peruvian presidents Jaime Paz Zamora
and Alberto Fujimori meet in the southern Peruvian port of Ilo to sign a
bilateral agreement.
Peru's President Alberto Fujimori has made an offer of free transit for
Bolivian products through a 'corridor' leading to Ilo from the Bolivian
frontier town of Desaguadero.
Under Mr Fujimori's proposal:
Bolivia would be permitted to import and export via Ilo with no customs
formalities - perhaps even using their own railway stock on the Peruvian
tracks;
Ilo would become a free zone with full industrial and commercial facilities;
and,
Bolivians could even purchase their own seaside residences in a new tourist
resort on Peruvian soil.
The Peruvian proposal has been enthusiastically greeted in Bolivia, which
has been landlocked since it lost territory to Chile in the 1879 War of the
Pacific.
In return for the concessions, Peru would gain access to the Atlantic, via
the network of roads and railways which link Desaguadero to the Bolivian
capital, La Paz, and thence to Brazil, Paraguay and northern Argentina.
Ilo, which is less than 300 miles from La Paz, hopes to lure lucrative
Bolivian trade away from the northern Chilean ports of Arica.
President Fujimori's plan gives priority to Ilo as the principal port for
Peruvian and Bolivian (and ultimately Brazilian) exports to the Pacific Rim
countries.
It is a deep-water port with good basic infrastructure but will require
further substantial investment and development.
Before leaving for Ilo, the Bolivian president called the meeting one of
'transcendental importance'.
'This is a signal to the rest of the continent,' he said, 'that there's a
new way of managing affairs.'

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (23): Looking east - and west - Sally
Bowen meets two Bolivian visionaries

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like President Sanchez de Lozada himself, two of Bolivia's most far-sighted
men are entrepreneurs who, after spending many years outside their native
land, have returned and succeeded in transforming a personal vision into
reality.
One is Mr Joaquin Aguirre, author, philosopher, playwright, businessman and
now the owner of Bolivia's only genuinely functioning port on the Paraguay
River: it bears his name, Puerto Aguirre.
'The Paraguay-Parana hidrovia (waterway) is to our continent what the
Mississippi is to the US,' he says, 'but over the centuries Latin Americans
have done everything possible to ignore it.'
Aguirre found plans for a river port and waterway already gathering dust in
the foreign ministry's archives when he was a young man.
Only after 30 years of globe-trotting - during which he built the gas
pipeline to Argentina, founded a supermarket chain in Colombia and patented
sugar made from bananas - did he return to Bolivia to explore the waterway
route in the mid-1970s.
Since 1983, Mr Aguirre says he has invested Dollars 10m in Puerto Aguirre
from his own savings and loans: other private entrepreneurs have put in
another Dollars 28m.
The 1986 World Bank report on the eastern lowlands of Bolivia, which gave
the green light - and initial credit - to soya farming in the zone,
described him as 'a man of vision, passion and action'.
Mr Aguirre, now in his seventies, believes integration will be achieved by
entrepreneurs rather than governments.
A permanent, five-country 'hidrovia' commission now exists and is already
moving ahead with waterway improvements.
This year, he says, his 'pipe-dream' Puerto Aguirre will move 200,000 tonnes
of cargo, mainly soya.
Like Mr Aguirre, Mr Julio Leon Prado made most of his money in other Latin
American countries over a 30-year period - chiefly in power transmission
lines and construction.
His many-tentacled Banco Industrial group is now Bolivia's leader in
financial services.
But Mr Leon Prado is a frontiersman at heart. Although he is nearly 70 years
old, in the past few years he has spearheaded Bolivia's booming soya
industry and is now the country's largest individual farmer.
'When I expanded to 2,000 hectares, they said I was crazy. But I told them,
if you need two tractors for 2,000 hectares, you need twenty for 20,000:
it's that simple.'
With yields of 3.2 tonnes a hectare, Mr Leon can match the world's most
productive soya farmers. He praises the Japanese settlers in the region east
of Santa Cruz for realising the land's rich potential:
'They revolutionised alised Bolivian agriculture, proving how fertile it
is.'
For Mr Leon, soya represents the future of Bolivia. 'It's a primary industry
and best of all, it's forever because it's sustainable. There's business
here for everyone.' He is lending money, supplying seeds, sharing technology
and weather reports with small farmers in a push to get a million hectares
of Bolivian lowlands under soya.
'That means 3m tonnes of beans a year, which is a point of no return,' he
says. Bolivian soya, plus the produce from south-west Brazil, will exert
irresistible pressure on governments and private companies to get adequate
transportation infrastructure in place.
'Joaquin Aguirre is one of Bolivia's great visionaries,' Mr Leon
acknowledges.
'But I think time will prove him wrong. I believe Bolivia's future lies
westwards, out through Peru to the Pacific.'

  [Text] La Paz, 22 Jun (LOS TIEMPOS) -- The metaphor about 
the "milk and the cow" was thoroughly explained today by 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, when he said that even if 
Bolivia gets a sovereign sea outlet -- it wants to take concrete 
steps on the sea issue with Chile -- it must also get several 
outlets on both the Pacific and Atlantic, with the full use of 
the port of Ilo in Peru as well as the Paraguay-Parana waterway 
and other ports in Argentina and Uruguay. 
  "Even though the sea outlet claim is a valid issue, though 
problematic and difficult, we want to make progress in all 
fields -- cultural, political, and economic -- in all fields 
related to our great effort to have a sea outlet on the Pacific 
and outlets through the waterway," said President Sanchez at a 
news conference held today to talk about the positive aspects of 
his tour of the United States and Colombia. 
  The controversial statement made by President Sanchez de 
Lozada after meeting with Chilean President Eduardo Frei 
prompted a wave of protests for an allegedly antipatriotic 
policy on the sea outlet issue. 
  This policy was denied today by President Sanchez de Lozada, 
who said that the talk with President Frei was from any point of 
view very positive, because the sea outlet issue will be debated 
during the Rio Group summit next September. 
  "We want to see concrete things, concrete steps to improve 
the Bolivian situation," said Sanchez de Lozada, who pointed out 
the work being carried out by Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori, whom, he said, was carrying out "concrete" work 
allowing greater binational contacts, one proof of which is the 
highway linking the port of Ilo with the Bolivian border. 
  The explanation given by President Sanchez de Lozada on the 
metaphor he used after meeting with President Frei was mainly 
related to the fact that Bolivia has to use other "outlets" to 
the Pacific and Atlantic, and these would be the port of Ilo in 
Peru and the Paraguay-Parana waterway, because Bolivia is 
entering a stage of economic and productive expansion for which 
it is necessary to seek ports for exports. 
  Sanchez de Lozada said: "Even if Bolivia gets a sovereign 
sea outlet -- and this is our great goal and struggle, which 
will not change in this government or in any other -- we must 
also find other ports that will not be Bolivian, but Chilean, 
Peruvian, and on the waterway of the River Plate Basin. In its 
projection abroad Bolivia must show that by negotiating with our 
neighbors we can get benefits without having direct ownership of 
those ports and their installations." 
  In this regard, President Sanchez de Lozada said there is a 
feeling of solidarity in the neighboring countries (Peru, 
Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay) which makes him believe that 
Chile will also enter a new stage of relations for mutual 
benefit. 
  Therefore, said Sanchez de Lozada, it is hoped that for the 
September meeting the Bolivian and Chilean Foreign Ministries 
will prepare a work agenda that will consider the issues 
dividing the two countries under a new spirit of friendly 
relations.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (7): Face-lift is overdue - Sally Bowen
examines the infrastructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After years of neglect, the vital 500km road link between the rich
agricultural flatlands of Santa Cruz and Cochabamba in the central
cordillera is being repaired. Along the highway, caterpillar trucks and
bulldozers - many belonging to Brazilian road-builders Andrade Gutierrez and
Odebrecht under Bolivian government contracts - are shovelling, levelling
and asphalting. Flood-damaged bridges are being re-fashioned; new ones
built.
The country's road system is getting a face-lift, and not before time.
Historically, according to Mr Lucio Paz, transport minister, Bolivia's road
and rail system has been the prime obstacle to national economic
development. Only 4 per cent of the country's 43,000km of roads is
asphalted; more than three-quarters are virtually unusable for six rainy
months each year.
Now that Bolivia's development plans hinge on becoming a strategic hub for
the South American continent, transport is a high priority. The ministry's
ambitious brief is to build 2,700km of roads within the next five years - at
an estimated cost of Dollars 1.9bn - as well as improving and asphalting
many of the existing land connections.
'Our road communications are a hundred years behind our telecommunications,'
says Mr Paz. 'Unless we can make a dramatic leap forward, investors simply
won't come to Bolivia.' Road improvements could cut high Bolivian transport
costs by as much as 50 per cent, he says.
Underlining this message is the rapidly improving condition of the road
between Chile's port of Arica (presently the principal route for Bolivia's
imports and exports) and La Paz. By late next year, travelling time will
have shrunk from as much as six days in bad weather conditions to six hours.
With the decline in relative importance of minerals transportation, and the
boom in soya and other agricultural exports, roads rather than railways have
become the focus of attention for Bolivia's planners. Officials hope to
leave the new investor-operator of soon-to-be capitalised state railways
company Enfe to resolve the problems of upgrading, boosting standards and
investing in the vital 'missing link' between Santa Cruz and Cochabamba.
But road-building is costly. One Bolivian kilometre can cost Dollars 300,000
on the flat eastern plains and Dollars 1m or more on a mountainous stretch.
The government has some Dollars 280m in its present annual budget for roads,
'but we need to find new sources of financing construction,' says Mr Paz.
One plan is to hive off as concessions certain potentially profitable
sections to private companies which would build, collect tolls and maintain
highways.
Bolivia's rugged terrain means that efficient air links are essential. Many
of the 37 airports are rudimentary: only 10 have tarmac and just two (La Paz
and Santa Cruz) are classified as international. By the end of 1996, the
government plans to have 17 more provincial landing strips surfaced and
their infrastructure improved.
The government of Japan, meanwhile, is donating Dollars 30m to re-equip the
capital's El Alto airport, extend the runways, upgrade lighting and improve
communications and traffic control systems. Japan has also helped out with
road-building equipment and seven bridges to link primarily Japanese
agricultural colonies in Santa Cruz department to main highways.
'We're knocking on everyone's door for financing,' says Mr Paz. He has
Dollars 12m in the bag from the Inter-American Development Bank to upgrade
the road link from La Paz to the Peruvian frontier at Desaguadero, thus
opening up access to the as-yet undeveloped free port facilities and coastal
strip granted by Peru to Bolivia in Ilo.
In the other direction, an international tender will soon be sought for
upgrading the 640km dirt road eastwards from Santa Cruz to San Matias on the
Brazilian border.
This will open the way for thousands of tonnes of soya beans from the Mato
Grosso in south-west Brazil to cross the continent through Bolivia for
eventual shipment to Asia through Peruvian or Chilean Pacific seaports.
Also arousing the enthusiasm of top-level politicians and planners is the
so-called 'hidrovia', a 2,700km Paraguay-Parana waterway system which
provides a link between landlocked Bolivia's Puerto Suarez, a river port on
the frontier with Brazil, and the River Plate estuary.
Initial investment - in dredging the shallow upper reaches and providing
proper signalling so that barges may also move cargo by night  - is
estimated at about Dollars 11m. These improvements, say analysts, will cut
transport time in half and slash the high costs (between Dollars 15 and
Dollars 18 a tonne) between Bolivia and Buenos Aires. Financing has already
been offered by the IADB and the UN Development Programme.
A totally new port is also planned at Puerto Busch, on the Paraguay river
and some 140km south of existing Puerto Suarez. The state will build the
road, say government officials, and leave private enterprise to develop port
facilities. The European Union, and in particular the Belgian government,
has offered assistance.

  [Text] Colonia de Sacramento, Uruguay, 17 Jan (EFE) -- The 
presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay today 
agreed to integrate Bolivia as an observer country in all the 
meetings of the work subgroups of the Common Market of the South 
(Mercosur). 
  The decision was made during the fifth Mercosur summit, 
which 
ended in the city of Colonia, after a formal petition made by 
Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada. 
  Presidents Carlos Menem of Argentina, Itamar Franco of 
Brazil, Juan Carlos Wasmosy of Paraguay, and Luis Alberto 
Lacalle of Uruguay issued a public declaration expressing their 
satisfaction with the Bolivian Government's desire to extend and 
strengthen its ties with Mercosur. 
  The declaration states: "They thus considered it appropriate 
to respond to Bolivia's petition by inviting its representatives 
to participate, as observers, in the meetings of the work 
subgroups." 
  The presidents also state that "within the framework of 
Bolivia's petition, agreements with Bolivia will be prioritized 
with the perspective of its future total participation in 
Mercosur." 
  President Sanchez de Losada attended the summit as an 
observer and in his speech he stressed his country's interest in 
Mercosur without forgetting other integration agreements Bolivia 
has signed. 
  Technically, Bolivia cannot join Mercosur because it already 
belongs to the Andean Pact, but it can associate with it through 
a free market system. 
  The Bolivian president said before his colleagues that "we 
must recognize that we have failed" in Latin American 
integration "given the lack of political will to eliminate 
borders that are presently more in the minds of our countries' 
leaders than in geography." 
  Sanchez de Losada added: "Our peoples have always considered 
themselves brothers and sisters within a great Latin American 
family. In this process of attaining an ideal, we have fallen 
and risen many times, but we are learning." 
  "With past experience and the demands of our current times, 
we Latin Americans are taking more seriously the challenge of 
integration, and Mercosur is proof of this," he added. 
  "We Bolivians are convinced that efforts like Mercosur, the 
Andean Pact, and the Group of Three have the common objective of 
making progress toward a greater and broader integration," he 
stated. 
  Sanchez de Losada concluded by saying: "Bolivia plays a role 
in this process by being a point in common and a contact among 
regional groups. We are willing to play the role that 
corresponds to us given our continental vocation, our deep 
integrationist will, and our presence in the River Plate, 
Andean, Amazon, Pacific, and Atlantic areas."

  [Text] Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay, 17 Jan (EFE) -- 
Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, speaking about 
Latin American integration today, said: "We have failed and we 
must recognize it in our lack of political willingness to 
eliminate borders because they exist more in the minds of our 
countries' leaders than in geography." 
  Sanchez de Lozada spoke before his Argentine, Brazilian, 
Paraguayan, and Uruguayan counterparts to thank them for the 
invitation to participate as an observer in the fifth Mercosur 
[Common Market of the South] summit. The Bolivian president 
said: "Our peoples have always considered themselves brothers 
and members of a greater Latin American family. In this process 
of advancing behind an ideal, we have fallen and risen many 
times, but we are learning." 
  "The new international reality has a dizzying dynamism. The 
EC is practically a reality. There are new and powerful 
economies in Asia and the Chinese giant seems to be awakening," 
Sanchez de Lozada said. 
  "With our past experiences and the demands of the world 
today 
we, Latin Americans, are taking the challenge of integration 
more seriously, and Mercosur is proof of that," Sanchez added. 
  "We, Bolivians, are convinced that undertakings such as 
Mercosur, the Andean Pact, or the Group of Three have the common 
objective of advancing behind a larger and broader sub-regional 
integration ideal, which will be followed by a regional and then 
a continental integration process," the Bolivian president said. 
  "We congratulate ourselves for the implementation of NAFTA 
not only because it represents an important step forward in the 
economic relations of friendly countries, but also because 
Mexico's participation establishes new and promising terms for 
our intercontinental economic and trade relations." 
  Sanchez stressed: "We must direct all our integration energy 
toward convergence and direct all our bilateral and subregional 
efforts toward a regional economic area." 
  The Bolivian president said this integration must be based 
on 
three basic pillars: free trade with productive investment, 
international equality, and social well-being "because the 
economy must serve man and not simply the statistics." 
  Sanchez de Lozada said: "Bolivia has a role in this process 
of articulation and contact. We are ready to play our role in 
American integration. We have a deep belief in integration and 
we will play our role in the River Plate area, or the Andean, 
Amazon, Pacific, or Atlantic regions." 
  Sanchez de Lozada concluded by saying: "Bolivia is a 
privileged country in the Latin American region because of its 
geographical position, its clarity, the continuity of its 
economic policy, and, above all, because of its unfailing 
integrative political will."

   Here are some facts and figures on Bolivia:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Bolivia is landlocked in the heart of South America
and is roughly the size of Texas and Arkansas combined. It is is
divided into three distinct geographical regions: the highlands,
the mountainous valley regions and sub-tropical lowlands. Major
cities such as La Paz, Oruro and Potosi are part of the Andes
mountain range. The lowlands include the vast savannas and
impenetrable jungles of the Beni, Pando and Santa Cruz departments,
which are traversed by thousands of miles of rivers that feed into
the Amazon.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ Bolivia's 6.9 population is largely made up of
people of Quechua and Aymara Indian origin. Although Spanish is the
official language, Quechua and Aymara are widely spoken in rural
areas and in major cities. In the tropical regions, Guarani and
other native languages are also spoken. The population is largely
Roman Catholic, although Indian farmers maintain a mixture of
Catholic and Indian beliefs that include worship of a goddess of
the earth. The last two decades have seen a significant migration
of Quechua and Aymara farmers to the lowland regions, including
areas that produce sugar cane, coffee and coca leaf, which is
processed into cocaine.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE HISTORY _ Aymara and other Indian cultures, which predate by
several centuries the Inca conquest of Bolivia, established an
elaborate system of government and built the city of Tiwanacu with
its vast irrigated fields and elaborate stone and ceramic figures.
The Incas conquered the highlands and some of the lowland regions
of Bolivia in the 13th century. The Spanish conquerors took over in
1538. Bolivia, which is named after its liberator Simon Bolivar,
became independent from Spain in 1825 and separated itself from
Peru. In a series of wars over the next century, Bolivia lost its
Pacific coast to Chile, part of its Amazon to Brazil and some of
its southern territory to Paraguay.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Bolivia has a free market economy that has begun
to see stability. In 1985, tough austerity measures were used to
control hyper-inflation, which had soared to 23,000 percent.
Inflation has plunged to 15 percent and the government estimates
that the economy will grow by 3.5 percent in 1989. Bolivia seeks
foreign investors interested in mining, petroleum exploration and
agriculture. Bolivia is still heavily dependent, however, on
cocaine trafficking, which brings in an estimated $200 million to
$300 million a year and provides a livelihood to 300,000 Bolivians.
Natural gas, which earned $214 million in exports last year, has
supplanted minerals as the main source of export earnings, which
totalled $600.5 million in 1988. Mineral exports amounted to $196
million in 1988.

   THE CULTURE _ Bolivia has a rich and dynamic culture rooted in
its Indian heritage. Aymara and Quechua Indians make exquisite
weavings and outfits and have elaborate rituals and festivals that
date to pre-Colombian times. The rich cultural diversity is
manifest during carnival in the mining city of Oruro and Gran Poder
in La Paz when thousands of dancers wearing elaborate masks and
outfits pay homage to patron saints. Bolivia also has a rich
musical and visual arts tradition.

  [Excerpt] Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada 
arrived at Silvio Pettirossi international airport this morning. 
He said: "During this visit we will close agreements that will 
be remembered for a long time." Sanchez de Lozada was 
accompanied by his wife and a large entourage of businessmen. He 
was received by President Juan Carlos Wasmosy. According to 
Sanchez de Lozada, natural gas and the two countries' road 
connection will top the presidents' agenda. 
  The Bolivian president said it was an honor and a great 
satisfaction to be in Asuncion. 
  "I think this will be a historic visit. We will achieve many 
things, and we will reach agreements that will be remembered for 
a long time," Sanchez said after the protocol ceremony and still 
on the landing strip. 
  Regarding the agenda's main issues, Sanchez de Lozada said 
the two presidents will talk about the sale of Bolivian gas to 
our country and full integration through a paved highway 
crossing Paraguay's Chaco region, "creating a single heart for 
the entire continent." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar yesterday 
announced that President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada will travel 
to Colombia on 14 June to attend the Fourth Ibero-American 
Summit, which is to be held in Cartagena. 
  This will be the first time Sanchez de Lozada will attend 
this forum, at which 23 presidents and chiefs of state from the 
continent and Spain meet every year. The summit will last two 
days. 
  This year the main subject of the summit will be regional 
trade and democracy. The first meeting was held in Guadalajara, 
Mexico. Four years ago Bolivia was represented by Jaime Paz 
Zamora, who was president at that time. 
  Aranibar also announced that Bolivia will send a 
representative to an international meeting to be held next week 
within the framework of the OAS annual forum, where countries of 
the continent will assess the progress made in the struggle 
against drug trafficking and the cooperation between countries 
to face this crime.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (3): A healthier footing - Trade and
foreign policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The accelerating process of opening Bolivia up to international markets,
started in 1985, is beginning to bear fruit. A combination of
entrepreneurial thrust and bilateral free trade agreements has helped close
the yawning 1993 trade gap. Now, in 1994, growing non-traditional exports
are helping put Bolivia on a healthier footing with trading partners.
'Bolivia adopted market-oriented reforms and low import tariffs earlier than
any Latin American country except Chile,' says Mr Carlos Morales, trade and
industry minister. 'It's been tough for businessmen but they now realise
that, with a small domestic market and low per capita income, we must export
in order to produce.'
Official figures show revenue from non-traditionals - principally soya
beans, gold jewellery and textiles - jumped 83 per cent in first half of
1994 compared with the same period last year. By year's end, the trade
ministry estimates, non-traditionals could earn Dollars 400m, approaching
half of all export revenue.
Last year, almost 40 per cent of Bolivia's trade was with other Latin
American countries. The European Union accounted for 28 per cent - mainly
traditional mineral exports - and the US for 24 per cent. High transport
costs mean Bolivia's present exports to Asia are a slim 8 per cent -
products are mainly natural-resource based with little value added.
The US has become the main market for Bolivia's non-traditional exports.
Under the Andean Trade Preference Act - instituted during the presidency of
Mr George Bush to help support alternatives to illegal drugs trafficking -
some 6,000 Bolivian products can enter the US free of duty.
Although landlocked, Bolivia has the advantage of sharing borders with many
countries. Under the Paz Zamora administration, Bolivia started negotiating
a series of bilateral trade accords with neighbours and other Latin American
countries. These initiatives have been stepped up under President Gonzalo
Sanchez de Lozada.
'The adoption by the Andean Pact countries of market-oriented economic
policies has been good news for Bolivia,' says Mr Morales. Peru is Bolivia's
chief customer within the Pact, buying Dollars 42m in Bolivian
non-traditional goods (mainly soya and its derivatives) in first-half 1994 -
nearly a quarter of the total exported and 63 per cent more than for the
first six months of 1993.
Boosting the chances of closer integration with Peru is the 1992 agreement
which granted Bolivia rights to an industrial free trade zone and a 5km
strip of desert coast near the southern Peruvian port of Ilo. In return,
Peru won access to Bolivian river port facilities in Puerto Suarez, on the
borders of Brazil, with an outlet to the Atlantic.
Bolivia, however, is in pursuit of the largest possible number of trading
partners. It is particularly attracted to the Mercosur group of countries
comprising Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. Bolivia was granted
'observer status' last December.
'We see ourselves as a hinge between the Andean Pact and Mercosur,' says Mr
Morales. 'We believe in a larger trade area and we're negotiating
aggressively within the vision of Mercosur.'
In January and March this year, Bolivia signed preliminary free trade
agreements with Paraguay and Brazil to complement its existing accords with
Argentina and Uruguay. These are seen as essential, if limited, first steps
in fulfilment of the ambition to join Mercosur.
A landmark trade accord with Chile, signed in April 1993, has so far proved
disappointing. La Paz businessmen claim that Chile is blocking Bolivian
exports by over-rigidly applying non-tariff regulations while swamping the
Bolivian market with Chilean consumer goods. Re-negotiations in October,
however, should give Bolivians a chance to level the trade score.
Bolivia's most recent trade accord was signed with Mexico in September,
allowing for phasing in of total free trade within 15 years. However, 98 per
cent of all products will be traded tariff-free within 10 years and a
significant portion immediately.
Trade between the two countries is small - worth less than Dollars 20m in
1993 - and weighted in favour of Mexico. But Bolivians expect exports of
wood, alpaca textiles and gold jewellery to expand fast. Government
officials estimate that bilateral trade will jump to Dollars 50m in year
one.
Meanwhile, Bolivia is also starting to see benefits from its five free trade
zones established from 1991 onwards. Their objective is to cut incentives
for the flourishing contraband business which for years has sliced into
state revenue from import duties and value-added tax.
Mr Oscar Ewel, general manager of GIT, the company which holds the 40-year
concessions for the La Paz and Santa Cruz free trade zones, estimates that
some 60 per cent of the Dollars 400m or so imported into Bolivia via Chile's
free port of Iquique is smuggled. Mr Ewel believes that illegal goods
entering Bolivia from Brazil via Santa Cruz account for Dollars 300m of a
total of some Dollars 420m.
GIT (part of the Banco Industrial-ICE group) has invested Dollars 8m in La
Paz free zone infrastructure to date. Some 350 Bolivian companies are now
regular users and GIT expects to handle in excess of Dollars 100m this year.
With a standard 10 per cent import duty and 13 per cent sales tax, GIT is
collecting some Dollars 25m for the Bolivian customs.
In a late October initiative, the La Paz free trade zone inaugurated a
direct import service 'to help formalise the informal trader who spends
under Dollars 2,000 at any one time,' says Mr Ewel.
Those buying through the free trade zone will receive and supply proper
invoices, an innovation for the street-sellers of La Paz and their
customers.
Santa Cruz's free trade zone started operating in January. This year it will
handle some Dollars 30m in merchandise, not yet making much of a dent in
contraband from Brazil. Smaller free trade zones have also been set up under
concession in the cities of Cochabamba, Oruro and Puerto Aguirre.
Still pending is reform of Bolivia's customs service which is scheduled for
privatisation in the near future.

   If there's a deep black hole in South America,
Bolivia has been in it. But now, as some of its more advanced
neighbors might be on the verge of falling in, Bolivia may be
coming out. The light at the top offers hope for the poorest
country on the continent but it's still only a glimmer. This is one
in a series of periodic reports by The Associated Press on the
economic, social and political turbulence that has turned South
America into a continent in crisis.

<NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A remarkable economic turnaround and a
newfound political stability are giving hope to the South American
country that perhaps most needs it.
   But despite Bolivia's visions of a brighter future, its present
remains bleak:
   _Of every 10 workers, two can't find jobs and one has turned to
the illegal cocaine business.
   _One of every 10 newborns doesn't survive infancy _ the worst
rate in the Americas.
   _Of every 1,000 Bolivians, 14 die each year. That's nearly
double the South American average.
   The new leadership that will grapple with the country's grave
problems won't be known until at least Aug. 4, when Congress
convenes to choose a new president. In a general election May 7,
all candidates fell short of the absolute majority needed for
direct election, so the legislature must pick from the top three
finishers: Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, the former dictator Hugo
Banzer Suarez and Jaime Paz Zamora.
   All three have pledged, however, to stick with an economic
program that transformed Bolivia from South America's most chaotic
nation into what some are calling a Third World model.
   Bolivia has had 76 governments since independence from Spain in
1825 _ half of them de facto military governments and the other
half democratically elected.
   From 1978 to 1982, its 6.9 million people _ many of them
descendants of an Indian culture that predated Inca conquests in
Bolivia by several centuries _ saw eight changes of government.
They included three bloody military coups.
   Democracy was re-established in 1982, but the government of
then-President Hernan Siles Zuazo proved unable to reverse an
economic tailspin and an inflation rate that soared to an
inconceivable rate of 23,000 percent a year.
   A 10-million peso note shrank in value to $5, and the Central
Bank confessed to not a penny in reserves.
   When President Victor Paz Estenssoro was elected to replace
Siles Zuazo in 1985, he declared simply but dramatically: ``Bolivia
is dying on us.''
   His government prescribed a drastic cure: a 95-percent currency
devaluation, an end to subsidized prices and a 10-fold increase in
the price of gasoline, and the layoff of 35,000 state tin miners
and other government employees. While public spending was slashed,
an effective new tax system brought in additional revenues.
   The new program was put to an immediate test when world market
prices for tin and oil, the country's main exports, plunged
drastically. The plan nonetheless took hold.
   Inflation dropped and leveled off at about 10 percent a year _
among South America's lowest rates. In 1987 and 1988, the country
enjoyed modest but steady economic growth for the first time in
many years.
   Once-scarce foreign investment is picking up, as is foreign aid.
Some factories and new homes and office buildings are going up.
With new tax revenues, the government is paving streets and
painting public buildings.
   ``Bolivia is a country that has made a complete turnaround,''
U.S. Ambassador Robert Gelbard said in an interview. ``It has
reversed the trend toward economic collapse and established the
base for recovery.''
   Gelbard said he expects the recovery to continue no matter which
of the three candidates is chosen president, since each is
committed to the program.
   ``I'm very optimistic.''
   Fernando Mendoza, World Bank representative in Bolivia, said the
Bolivian program ``represents a very important example for Latin
America and other countries that are passing through a similar
situation.''
   While such countries as nearby Brazil and Argentina try to
entangle themselves from foreign debt, Bolivia, because of its
poverty, is under less pressure from foreign creditors.
   Unlike other debtor countries, Bolivia owes most of its
$4.2-billion foreign debt to governments or international
assistance agencies, which have been more willing to reschedule
payment.
   Commercial lenders have virtually written off the $700 million
Bolivia owes them, and has allowed the government to buy half of it
back at 11 percent of its face value.

  [Text] Rocio Bernal, chief editor of Channel 7, has 
prepared an important report summarizing the main aspects of the 
meeting between Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and 
Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem in Buenos Aires: 
  [Begin Bernal recording] I have important news from 
Argentina. An important energy agreement was signed by President 
Sanchez de Lozada and Argentine President Carlos Menem. The main 
aspects of the agreement are the sale of 6.1 million cubic 
meters of natural gas per year at an initial price of $1.21 per 
cubic meters until 1996. As of 1996, the price will be increased 
annually based on international prices. For the first time 
Bolivia will sell gasoline to Argentina. This will allow Bolivia 
to obtain an income of $4 million a year. Regarding light crude 
oils, the cubic meter will be sold to Argentina at $162.50 
delivered at the Palmasola plant. 
  The official Bolivian mission that went to Argentina headed 
by President Sanchez de Lozada also was able to obtain an 
investment of $5 million for the next two years as of the 
agreement's signing. An investment of $15 million for the next 
four years also was obtained. The contract signed with Argentine 
Government Oil Deposits is an important step for the country's 
benefit, and from the quality and quantity viewpoint it is 
better than the previous contract. President Sanchez de Lozada 
expressed by phone his complete satisfaction with the result of 
his visit to Argentina because the No. 1 issue, the sale of 
natural gas to Argentina, was excellent for Bolivia after 
difficult negotiations. 
  Also, the presidents of Argentina and Bolivia reviewed 
international, regional, and bilateral issues within the 
framework of cordiality and friendship. They pointed out the 
excellent level of relations between the two governments, and 
verified the importance of the issues discussed during the 
recent visit of the Argentine foreign minister to Bolivia 
included in the La Paz Joint Declaration on 22 December 1993. 
  With the purpose of pointing out the positive results of the 
current visit, the presidents signed a joint declaration that 
says they reaffirmed their commitment to contribute to the 
consolidation of democracy in the continent as the essential 
basis for keeping peace and developing social justice to protect 
human rights and implement economic development. 
  The two presidents agreed that the invitation made by the 
four Mercosur [Common Market of the South] countries to Bolivia 
to have government representatives participate as observers in 
the meetings of subgroups will contribute to strengthening the 
mechanisms of appropriate relations for joining the Mercosur 
integration process. 
  Regarding the Bolivian maritime claim, which is one of the 
main components of Bolivian foreign policy, the Bolivian 
president expressed his satisfaction over the possibilities now 
existing for sincere dialogue among all the parties involved. 
  The two presidents also expressed their conviction that the 
14th meeting of the Intergovernmental Committee of the 
Paraguay-Parana Waterway to be held in Formosa [Argentina] from 
21 to 25 March will strengthen cooperation between the states on 
the waterway program and will be progress in studying the 
related issues that will facilitate regional integration. 
  Within the framework of economic cooperation between the two 
governments, the Argentine Government gave Bolivia the 
equivalent of $84 million, of which $54 million is for local 
projects and will be disbursed from April to December. The 
remaining $30 million will be used to finance Argentine and 
Bolivian goods, installations, and equipment for a broad health 
program in the border regions of Argentina and Bolivia. To this 
effect, the two countries' health officials will prepare the 
adequate projects of basic infrastructure and health. Within 60 
days, a trade agreement will be signed establishing free 
transit, without tariffs or other types of fees, on goods 
between the two countries. This is for the competitive 
fabrication in Bolivia of products for the Argentine and 
Bolivian markets, for exporting to third countries, and for 
offering incentives for the investment of Argentine and Bolivian 
capital to this effect. The two presidents expressed their 
satisfaction with the signing of the agreement on reciprocal 
promotion and protection of investments. 
  Upon concluding his state visit, constitutional Bolivian 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada thanked Argentine President 
Carlos Saul Menem for his expressions of sympathy and friendship 
and for the warm hospitality of the Argentine Government and 
people. [end recording]

FT  04 AUG 92 / World Trade News: South America may go back to its trade
roots - John Barham on plans for a five-nation water corridor on the
continent's second largest river system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONQUISTADORES, explorers and traders once used the rivers of South America
to penetrate, subdue and settle the continent's heartland. But today the
rivers which form some of the world's greatest navigable waterways are
underused and vast regions of the interior isolated and impoverished.
But there are signs that the Parana-Paraguay rivers, which together form
South America's largest river system after the Amazon, could become an
important trade corridor linking the distant, landlocked interior with
seaports at the River Plate estuary.
Developing the rivers' transport potential should be easy because there are
few physical or natural obstacles to traffic. But petty national jealousies
and suspicions have held up progress for years.
The five countries through which the rivers flow - Argentina, Bolivia,
Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay - agreed in June to sweep away bureaucratic
restrictions that blocked trade and navigation.
Next, they plan to hire consultants to study how the 3,442km waterway, known
as the Hidrovia (Waterway), can be made into a low-cost artery navigable day
and night all year round. This first stage of engineering and environmental
consulting work will be financed by the United Nations, the European
Community and the Inter-American Development Bank.
Officials say an initial studies show that a few relatively cheap and simple
engineering projects estimated at Dollars 240m (Pounds 125.6m) would ensure
the Hidrovia's navigability. These costs would be borne by governments.
A further series of investments of about Dollars 740m needed to upgrade
ports and buy barges would be made by the private sector. Officials say it
would take about 10 years to make the Hidrovia fully operational and put the
total bill at Dollars 1.5bn-Dollars 2bn.
Mr Edmundo Soria, Argentina's transport secretary, said: 'We don't want
grand Pharaonic projects. We will be very careful with the projects we carry
out and restrict the state's financing to the minimum possible.'
The Hidrovia project is part of a wider trend towards greater political
co-operation, economic integration and free markets that is sweeping Latin
America. Other privately-financed infrastructure projects being studied
include a 45km bridge across the River Plate, a motorway linking Montevideo
and Porto Alegre in southern Brazil and a Dollars 200m gas pipeline
connecting gas fields in Patagonia with Chile.
At the moment, the rivers are only partly navigable. Still, Argentina uses
river ports on the Parana to ship a quarter of its exports and Paraguay
imports most of its fuel along the Paraguay river. But the Paraguay is only
navigable on average for about six months of the year above the capital
Asuncion.
Mr Jesus Gonzalez, Argentina's director of port construction and waterways,
says the potential economic benefits are clear: 'In Brazil's centre-west
there are 6m hectares of land ready for cultivation. But to take one tonne
of soyabeans to port costs Dollars 56 now. With the Hidrovia, transport
costs would fall to about Dollars 18 a tonne.' Also, Bolivia's
under-developed eastern regions have potentially rich agricultural land and
contain promising mineral deposits that would only become economically
viable with a cheap and efficient transport system.
A preliminary feasibility study found that while 4.3m tonnes were shipped
along the river in 1987, cargoes could reach 21m tonnes a year by the turn
of the century. It estimates an internal rate of return of between 16 per
cent and 23 per cent for the Hidrovia investments.
Although the impact of the Hidrovia would be felt mainly in the heart of the
continent, ports on the River Plate estuary would also benefit. Nueva
Palmira in Uruguay is expected to become the main transhipment centre. It is
expected to handle 7m-9m tonnes of cargo a year by 2000.
Planning is the easy part. But the hard decisions on who is to pay for the
project and how the money is to be raised have yet to be taken. The
Argentines are insisting that the private sector pay for most of the work in
exchange for the right to charge tolls or build private ports.
The Brazilians, who must carry out the costliest projects, say the state
will probably have to play a leading role. For their part, the smaller,
poorer countries balk at the sums involved.
Then there is the problem of the environment. That means more than just
curbing water pollution by barges or preventing damage of riverbanks by the
vessels' wakes. Brazil's Pantanal marshes, the world's largest wetlands
which lie along the Paraguay, must also be protected.
There is also a risk that the Hidrovia would attract large populations to
barren regions and that intensive farming and mining damage ecosystems.
There is also a danger that the Hidrovia could become a smuggling corridor
for Bolivia's cocaine cartels.

  [Text] In a joint declaration Paraguayan President Juan 
Carlos Wasmosy and Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada 
last night described the Pilcomayo River and the areas around it 
as a decisive factor in promoting integration among Argentina, 
Bolivia, and Paraguay, and decided to invite Argentine President 
Carlos Saul Menem to a meeting with a view to seeking formulas 
that would be instrumental in jointly undertaking mutually 
beneficial development projects. 
  Paraguay and Bolivia also stated that they are committed to 
fighting the drug trade, and agreed to hold permanent 
consultations between senior officers of their two countries. 
The Paraguayan Government supports "the search for a negotiated 
agreement" to provide Bolivia with an outlet to the Pacific 
Ocean. Sanchez de Lozada has characterized this goal as "an 
unrenounceable right of the Bolivian people." 
  In the joint declaration, which was signed at Lopez Palace, 
Wasmosy and Sanchez de Lozada attached special significance to 
the Pilcomayo River, but did not go into detail. They agreed, 
however, to invite President Menem to a joint meeting to 
undertake joint projects. They have not set any specific date 
for this meeting. They have also acknowledged that the abuse of 
and illegal trade in narcotics and dangerous substances are a 
serious threat to the health and well-being of all peoples, and 
noted that all nations must assume their share of responsibility 
in fighting this scourge at every level and in all of its forms. 
They reiterated their commitment to fighting the drug trade, 
and agreed to urgently implement bilateral actions. 
  To strengthen friendly relations and cooperation between 
their two countries, they have decided -- based on a proposal 
from the Bolivian Government -- to hold consultations between 
senior officers of their respective Armed Forces, through 
periodic meetings to be held at least once a year, alternating 
in Bolivia and Paraguay. 
  Regarding the gas pipeline, Wasmosy and Sanchez de Lozada 
emphasized the work of the energy technical commission that is 
studying the sale to Paraguay of Bolivian natural gas through 
the gas pipeline project, of liquefied gas, and of gasoline. 
They conveyed their desire to have the project implemented as 
soon as possible with the participation of the private sectors 
of both countries. 
  They also expressed their satisfaction over the progress and 
consolidation of the democratic system both in the world and 
within the region. They regard this as a guarantee for the full 
exercise of human rights and a necessary condition for achieving 
socioeconomic development. 
  They also mentioned the efforts made to find formulas that 
would enable Bolivia to gradually move closer to and join 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. 
  They agreed on the need to strengthen the Agreement on 
Coordination and Cooperation among Bolivia, Paraguay, and 
Uruguay (Urupabol), which was reactivated on 16 October 1993, 
and emphasized the consultations taking place among the three 
countries with a view to holding, as soon as possible, a meeting 
of their three foreign ministers. 
  Among other points, President Wasmosy informed his Bolivian 
counterpart that the Paraguayan Government is studying a project 
to build a dam in Bahia Negra to check the Paraguay River water 
flow. He noted that this project will generate a development 
process in vast areas in the region, will make the river 
navigable along its entire course, and will decrease ecological 
risks. 
  They also stated that it would be useful to improve customs 
monitoring at their common border. A customs office will be set 
up in General Garay. Sanchez de Lozada stated that the goal of 
obtaining a sovereign outlet to the Pacific Ocean is a 
fundamental topic in Bolivian foreign policy, and "an 
unrenounceable right of the Bolivian people." Wasmosy voiced 
his government's unwavering support in the search for a 
negotiated agreement on this issue.

  [Excerpts] In a joint declaration Paraguayan President Juan 
Carlos Wasmosy and Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada 
last night described the Pilcomayo River and the areas around it 
as a decisive factor in promoting integration among Argentina, 
Bolivia, and Paraguay, and decided to invite Argentine President 
Carlos Saul Menem to a meeting with a view to seeking formulas 
that would be instrumental in jointly undertaking mutually 
beneficial development projects. 
  Paraguay and Bolivia also stated that they are committed to 
fighting the drug trade, and agreed to hold permanent 
consultations between senior officers of their two countries. 
The Paraguayan Government supports "the search for a negotiated 
agreement" to provide Bolivia with an outlet to the Pacific 
Ocean. Sanchez de Lozada has characterized this goal as "an 
unrenounceable right of the Bolivian people." 
  In the joint declaration, which was signed at Lopez Palace, 
Wasmosy and Sanchez de Lozada attached special significance to 
the Pilcomayo River, but did not go into detail. They agreed, 
however, to invite President Menem to a joint meeting to 
undertake joint projects. They have not set any specific date 
for this meeting. They have also acknowledged that the abuse of 
and illegal trade in narcotics and dangerous substances are a 
serious threat to the health and well-being of all peoples, and 
noted that all nations must assume their share of responsibility 
in fighting this scourge at every level and in all of its forms. 
They reiterated their commitment to fighting the drug trade, 
and agreed to urgently implement bilateral actions. 
  To strengthen friendly relations and cooperation between 
their two countries, they have decided -- based on a proposal 
from the Bolivian Government -- to hold consultations between 
senior officers of their respective Armed Forces, through 
periodic meetings to be held at least once a year, alternating 
in Bolivia and Paraguay. [passage omitted]

<HEAD>Pope Expected To Denounce Drugs, Poverty In Ninth Trip To
Continent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II starts his ninth trip to
South America on Saturday, a visit expected to focus on the
pontiff's campaign against drugs and poverty in the overwhelmingly
Roman Catholic continent.
   John Paul's 12-day itinerary will take him to Uruguay and Peru,
both for the second time, to impoverished Bolivia, high in the
Andes, and to a meeting in Paraguay with strongman Gen. Alfredo
Stroessner.
   The tour, John Paul's 37th foreign pilgrimage since he became
pope nine years ago, is a sign of the importance the Vatican gives
to an area expected to include half of the world's Roman Catholics
by the end of the century. The trip also leaves Cuba as the only
major country in the region not visited by the Polish-born pope.
   It will be a new test of the fitness of John Paul, who will turn
68 while in Paraguay on May 18. In addition to keeping to his usual
grueling schedule and delivering 60 speeches, he will make two
stops in the 2{-mile-high altitudes of Bolivia.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said the pope's doctors
advised him to consider slowing down his pace at that altitude but
that John Paul replied: ``How can I do that?''
   The pope's first stop is Uruguay, considered the most secular
country in the region.
   John Paul then makes a five-day tour of Bolivia that will
include a stop in Santa Cruz, an eastern city where cocaine
traffickers are said to operate with near impunity.
   A U.S. congressional committee recently accused Bolivia, Peru
and Paraguay of failing to give the United States full cooperation
in the war on drugs. The House Foreign Affairs Committee voted to
impose aid sanctions. The legislation was considered unlikely to
pass before a May 13 deadline.
   The pope, who on his 1985 trip to Peru noted that Andean natives
have traditionally used coca leaves to ward off fatigue and hunger,
is expected to denounce the international problem of cocaine
smuggling.
   In a special edition on the upcoming trip, the Vatican newspaper
called Bolivia ``one of the most tormented countries'' in South
America because of its economic and social problems and said that
drug trafficking was ``eroding and polluting'' all levels of
society.
   After Bolivia, the pope travels to the Peruvian capital of Lima
to deliver the closing address to a regional religious conference.
   Church officials said that from his jet window as he nears
Lima's airport, the pontiff will be greeted with ``Papa Paz,'' _ or
``Pope Peace'' _ a giant sign made of white flowers set in a
25-acre potato patch.
   The greeting is a play on words, since ``papa'' is the Spanish
word for both pope and the potato. Officials said the pope, who
speaks Spanish fluently, will readily understand the message.
   Church officials expect about 2 million people to attend Mass in
a seaside field with a 115-foot illuminated cross.
   In Paraguay the pope is scheduled to meet with Stroessner on May
16, when he arrives in the capital of Asuncion.
   Stroessner, who came to power in an army coup in 1954, was
recently re-elected to an eighth presidential term with an
officially announced 88.6 percent of the vote. Opposition
politicians claimed the election was rigged.
   During his visit to Chile in 1987, John Paul came under
criticism for meeting with the country's authoritarian ruler, Gen.
Augusto Pinochet.
   The Vatican bristles at any suggestion that such meetings imply
the pope's support for a particular person or policy.
   ``He (the pope) doesn't consecrate any person or system,'' said
Navarro. ``He goes to visit the people.''
   The pope is scheduled to return to Rome on May 19.

  [Text] Colonia, 17 Jan (EFE) -- A series of differences 
were revealed on 17 January in the first results of a meeting 
the presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia, and 
Uruguay held to give political support to the Parana and 
Paraguay Rivers "waterway." 
  Carlos Menem, Juan Carlos Wasmosy, Itamar Franco, Luis 
Alberto Lacalle -- the presidents of Argentina, Paraguay, 
Brazil, and Uruguay -- are in Colonia, 180 km from Montevideo, 
attending the fifth Common Market of the South [Mercosur] 
summit, whose agenda centers around resolution of discrepancies 
for implementation of a common market. 
  Bolivia, which is not a Mercosur member, is being 
represented 
by its president, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, who is attending as 
an observer. This country has been considered part of the River 
Plate Basin in the "waterway" project, which will give Bolivia 
its longed- for access to the sea. 
  Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu told journalists 
that 
"the waterway will be included as a topic in the final 
declaration" of the fifth summit, which will end this evening, 
but did not report on the project's difficulties. 
  The common channels that Argentina and Uruguay -- the two 
River Plate coastal nations -- have under the terms of the River 
Plate Treaty have been used so far to reach the sea from the 
Paraguay and Parana Rivers. 
  But an Argentine initiative to build a private channel 
within 
its territorial waters through a public works concession to a 
private party, a project that will be financed through tolls, 
has created displeasure among the system's partners. 
  Uruguay has conveyed to Argentina its concern over the Mitre 
channel, which is the name of the Menem government's 
privatization project. 
  This channel will join the Argentine port of Rosario on the 
Parana River with the Atlantic Ocean. This will eliminate the 
Uruguayan port of Nueva Palmira as the river's final port, where 
Paraguay and Bolivia have been allowed to operate duty-free 
warehouses. 
  Uruguay also is concerned that the deepening of the new 
channel in Argentine territory will displace the channel the two 
countries share in Martin Garcia. 
  River navigation experts also have voiced their concern 
about 
the Mitre channel, which could force Uruguayan ships to pay 
tolls to the enterprises awarded the construction of Argentine 
public works, even for navigation to Uruguayan ports on the 
Uruguay River.

   With the military back in the barracks
practically everywhere in South America, civilian government and
democracy will be put to the test in six countries this year. The
outcomes could signal the continent's future course. This is
another in a series of periodic reports by The Associated Press on
the economic, social and political turbulence that has turned South
America into a continent in crisis.

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South America's social and political
fabric, loosely woven at the best of times, is fraying in these
most difficult times.
   From bloody protests in Venezuela to disruptive strikes in
Brazil to spreading guerrilla influence in Peru and Colombia, the
symptoms of widespread discontent are making themselves
dramatically evident in this year of crucial elections in a half
dozen countries. Wracked by crushing indebtedness and recession for
seven years, the continent that began the 1980s in the flush of a
democratic rennaissance is ending the decade weary and frustrated.
   Few foresee doom, but many warn of a deepening gloom that could
become politically explosive.
   ``The misery, the depressing conditions of life, the lack of
food, housing, health, training, education, and jobs create a
culture dish that can be exploited by `ultras' and extremists of
whatever tendency,'' Argentina's President Raul Alfonsin recently
warned in Buenos Aires.
   President Jose Sarney of Brazil sees extremists on the left
gaining ground.
   ``Democracy is losing ground in Latin America because the
solution it has presented do not attend national problems,'' he
said in an interview with The Associated Press in late March. ``We
offer pessimistic solutions, and the parties of the left optimistic
ones.''
   In 16 days in May, three countries _ Paraguay, Bolivia and
Argentina _ will elect new presidents. Three others _ Uruguay,
Brazil and Chile _ will do so by year's end.
   It should be a time of renewal and democratic reaffirmation, but
there's no sense of celebration. At best, there's a feeling of
having held off defeat.
   ``The democracies, one way or another, have managed to
survive,'' said Jose Joaquin Brunner, academic coordinator at the
Santiago-based Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, he said the simple
fact that elections were being held is a sign that all is not bad.
   ``It wasn't a given that the new democracies were going to
become strong quickly.''
   He added, however, that the combination of tender democratic
institutions and an economic crisis ``is a very explosive mixture.''
   Since 1978, a by-and-large moderate political leadership has
directed the transition from military dictatorship to democracy in
Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. It has taken
the unpopular path of austerity, curbing imports and limiting
spending on public services, in wrestling with South America's
foreign debt of $277 billion.
   The social cost has been high. Public hospitals and schools are
understaffed and in disrepair, their paint peeling and their
equipment antiquated or simply broken down. Overworked
state-hospital doctors in Brazil make the equivalent of about $130
a month; in Peru about half that. University professors commonly
hold two or three jobs to make a subsistence wage in most
countries. High-paying employment is hard to find, and stories of
architects and physicists driving taxis now are common.
   Even in Venezuela, whose oil wealth kept it immune to the
economic ailments afflicting its neighbors, real wages are slumping
dramatically and there is a growing shortage of basic consumer
goods, with supermarket shelves empty for the first time in 30
years.
   It was an increase in bus fares and the prices of some basic
consumer needs that set thousands to rioting across Venezuela in
late February; by official count 276 people were killed and
thousands injured, but unofficial accounts put the death toll at
300 to 500.
   The political cost of the economic and social unrest in South
America overall is likely to be seen in the upcoming elections.
Incumbent leaders and their parties are behind in the polls in
several countries, including Argentina and Bolivia. Presidents
Sarney of Brazil and Alan Garcia of Peru are beseiged by critics.

FT  18 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Brazil-Bolivia pipeline block - A look at
stalled negotiations for a Dollars 1.8bn natural gas project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To the president of Bolivia, Mr Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, it seems simple.
His country has a huge surplus of natural gas, while its neighbour, Brazil,
has an impending energy shortage. Pumping cheap gas to Brazil's industrial
south should therefore make everybody happy.
But, as Mr Sanchez de Lozada has discovered during negotiations in Brazil
this week, contracts involving natural resources and sovereignty over
infrastructure are rarely straightforward. Although both sides agree that
the Dollars 1.8bn pipeline will eventually go ahead, arguments about
shareholdings in the project and the volumes to be pumped threaten to delay
the venture further.
'The project is of the highest importance to Bolivia but no bank is going to
finance it unless they can see the pricing and volumes are right. This is
not a question of brinksmanship or who wins,' he says.
Brazil and Bolivia have long talked of building a gas pipeline but
negotiations only began in earnest in 1991, when a Brazilian study concluded
that gas was more efficient and environmentally sound than other energy
sources, and could reduce oil imports by at least 100,000 barrels a day.
As such, it seemed to offer a solution to Brazil's looming energy shortage.
About 95 per cent of the country's electricity comes from hydroelectric
power stations. But these take up to 10 years to build and the government's
economic problems have halted construction at many stations.
'If the country grows at 4 per cent a year - not fast for Brazil - in three
years we will reach capacity. Gas would be an alternative for this 'black
hole' between the finishing of the halted plants and opening of new ones,'
says Mr Eugenio Mancini Scheleder at Brazil's mines and energy ministry.
The two countries agreed in February last year to build a 3,400km pipeline
between Santa Cruz in Bolivia and Brazil's industrial capital Sao Paulo.
Brazil was to begin by buying 8m cu m of gas daily, rising to 16m cu m
within seven years.
Then the problems started, first over pricing. Brazil said the cost to its
consumers of imported gas had to compete with subsidised electricity prices,
thereby undermining Bolivia's profit margin. Petrobras, Brazil's oil and gas
monopoly, took a particularly aggressive stance in the negotiations, arguing
that Bolivia, one of Latin America's poorest countries, badly needed the
project to earn foreign exchange and that Brazil was Bolivia's only
potential customer on the continent.
The biggest row, which President Sanchez de Lozada and Brazil's President
Itamar Franco have been trying to defuse this week, is over shareholdings.
Brazil's constitution assures Petrobras a monopoly over the production and
import of oil and natural gas in Brazil. Petrobras believes this means it
should hold 51 per cent of the shares in the Brazilian portion of the
pipeline, easily the largest section. Meanwhile, both sides have agreed that
they will take small, symbolic stakes in each other's pipeline.
In what might have been a bid to head off further debate over shareholdings,
Petrobras announced at the weekend that it would work with BTB, a joint
venture between BHP, Tenneco and British Gas, on the project, with BTB
holding a significant but as yet undefined shareholding.
However, President Sanchez de Lozada this week arrived in Brazil saying
Bolivia wanted a 49 per cent stake in the pipeline, instead of the 4 per
cent Petrobras allegedly offered. 'We have the gas, they have the market. It
should be parity,' he says.
Bolivia seems to have raised its shareholding demand as a negotiating tactic
to persuade Brazil to increase the volumes of gas it will buy. Bolivia needs
the extra money to develop its gas fields and reserves.
Negotiations about the shareholdings were continuing yesterday, the closing
date for the original contract, at presidential level. A compromise is
likely, even if the sides only agree at this stage to delay a decision but
extend the contract. 'The pipeline is too good for too many people for
either side to walk away,' according to a member of BTB.
But the arguments have highlighted how much work still needs to be done
before construction can begin. Under the original contract, financing was
meant to be in place by now. But discussions with banks and international
agencies has so far been preliminary because of delays and confusion over
the project's structure. Detailed feasibility studies and market testing
have not yet started, even though Brazil wants to begin construction in the
third quarter of next year. To do so, financing needs to be in place by the
middle of next year: a target which is described as 'aggressive if not
impossible' by another BTB member.
Brazil says the main part of the project needs investment of Dollars 1.4bn,
of which Dollars 600m will be in equity and Dollars 800m in debt finance.
Raising that much money should not be difficult, given the project's
environmental advantages and importance to Bolivia. But the wrangling is
unhelpful, particularly after the World Bank hinted it was unhappy lending
to a project where the state-owned - and autocratic - Petrobras was a
majority shareholder.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Bolivian President Gonzalo </F>
Sanchez de Lozada by an unidentified EL PAIS reporter during his 
visit to Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay for the Common Market 
of the South, Mercosur, summit on 17 January] 
  [Text] [EL PAIS] You have often said that Bolivia is trying 
to be like "Dona Flor and her two husbands" [reference to novel 
by Brazilian writer Jorge Amado]. What exactly does that mean? 
  [Sanchez de Lozada] Well, I said that because, above all, 
Bolivia has three destinies: one linked to the River Plate 
region, another to the Amazon River region, and the third to the 
Pacific Ocean. I think that beyond this remark, our presence 
here in Uruguay is the result of our belief that our destiny 
linked to the River Plate region is the strongest one. Our 
immediate and future realities are closely linked to the 
Parana-Paraguay River Waterway. We hope that, based on 
agreements reached between Uruguay and Argentina, these two 
countries can establish with the others that will join them in 
this waterway an organization that can integrate them all. For 
Bolivia, this waterway represents an outlet to the sea. It will 
protect the eastern region of our country, where there is great 
potential in the exploitation of iron, gas, and soybeans. In 
this regard river transportation is really decisive. Our 
presence and closeness with Mercosur becomes, therefore, a 
priority. Just like Dona Flor, we would like to have two 
husbands (Mercosur and the Andean Pact). It seems, however, 
that our priority is Mercosur. This is why we want to hold 
bold, but prudent, talks. We want to become part of the 
locomotive instead of waiting to be run over by it. We believe 
that the locomotive is here, that it is the critical argument 
that will allow us to negotiate with the other economic blocs. 
In addition to that, our destiny is closely linked to this 
river basin that permits everything to become a unity instead of 
a diversity. 
  [EL PAIS] Why do you link the waterway to the River Plate? 
Institutionally, they are two different things. 
  [Sanchez de Lozada] It is very hard to separate a tree from 
its roots. The whole thing begins here. We can separate the 
two things, but we believe that our concept of fresh water and 
cheap, effective transportation is a way of reaching the other 
parts of the world. It is the destiny of all countries, 
particularly the landlocked ones, to find a sea outlet. This 
cannot be done unless we join the River Plate system. This is 
not an imposition, but it seems to apply. In addition, 
Argentina and Uruguay had to overcome several difficulties, and 
needed a lot of time before achieving the experience they now 
have. A joint administration is the first step toward achieving 
an administrative system similar to those prevailing in several 
other international river systems. It would be an 
administrative support to this exceedingly complex system. 
  [EL PAIS] Does Paraguay agree to this position? 
  [Sanchez de Lozada] Yes, I believe it does. We are very 
close to Paraguay. Our relations have changed very much after 
decades of susceptibilities and clashes resulting from the Chaco 
War. In this radical change, the Bolivian and Paraguayan 
leaders are reaching a level of relations that had already been 
achieved by our peoples. I also believe that our landlocked 
situation strongly unites us as a result of our geographical and 
socioeconomic realities. 
  [EL PAIS] You talked about the possibility of seeking a way 
of integration between Bolivia and Mercosur through a free trade 
zone. In this regard what could be obtained, taking into account 
that for five years Bolivia cannot become a Mercosur member? 
  [Sanchez de Lozada] ...No, in 1996... but if there is the 
political will, we could become a member tomorrow. If there is 
consensus, an exception could be made. This is what we seek: 
By being an observer, we are linked to Mercosur; it is a bit 
uncomfortable, but we are linked to it. Seeking a free trade 
zone is like supporting Mercosur; although it is still not a 
common market, it has no tariff. Therefore, it is a bit like 
getting to the point where the other countries already are. And 
as an observer, it is watching the negotiations for a free trade 
agreement, trying to find the political, juridical, and economic 
conditions to become a full member. But we must move with great 
prudence and care, because we have other relations and 
commitments. I came here above all seeking the political will of 
the four countries to make Bolivia become a Mercosur member, 
seeking a greater commitment. I believe there is a will; 
otherwise I would have not been invited. But there is still a 
long way to go. It is a way to open the path. 
  [EL PAIS] Is your visit to Uruguay next March related to 
this 
issue? 
  [Sanchez de Lozada] It has to do with this issue, but also 
with the relations with Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, which 
are very important to us. 
  [EL PAIS] Another issue proposed by Bolivia is the revival 
of Urupabol [Permanent Joint Commission of Uruguay, Paraguay, 
and Bolivia]. What use would you have for this group, which in 
some ways already failed during the decade of the sixties? 
  [Sanchez de Lozada] Yes, it failed because that was another 
time. I see the time as being very appropriate now, because it 
involves three small countries. Uruguay is in another stage of 
its socioeconomic development, just like Paraguay and Bolivia. 
But if these countries unite, they can make a greater impact 
under current conditions. I believe this is like a hand with 
five fingers. And the three of us have to face the pressures 
from Brazil and Argentina. Although the situation has changed, 
the relative size of our countries make us feel united in many 
ways, and there is also a lot of affinity and closeness on 
international issues. There are historical interests, and 
therefore it is a great advantage to have a common area. This 
is something very informal, thank God, it is a wish, but 
sometimes that is the most effective. Sometimes a friendship is 
more valuable than an event. 
  [EL PAIS] Your country has in the Andean Pact a special 
treatment on tariffs. Would Bolivia be willing to accept 
integration into a group like Mercosur, in which high tariffs 
are proposed for some products to protect an industry? Would 
your country be willing to join even when it has always enjoyed 
low tariffs? Would it pay that price? 
  [Sanchez de Lozada] We will see about paying the price. What 
we want is to participate, and to convince the large nations 
that high tariffs are a way of guaranteeing that their 
industries will never be competitive. We are not dogmatic, but 
a very poor country like Bolivia has come to the conclusion that 
protectionism stops the absorption of advanced technology. 
Because it is only human nature -- when a businessman is 
protected, he will not seek competition. And one of the reasons 
why we want to participate is because we believe that sometimes 
logic, explanation, and experience have a great deal of 
influence, especially in countries which are facing very 
powerful sectors. It is like the case of an angel speaking in 
one ear and the devil speaking in the other, but one must 
listen. The exchange of experience is obviously important; if 
one wants something valuable an effort must be made to get it. 
But I believe one of the reasons why we want to participate 
fully in Mercosur is because this process could stop. Bolivia 
cannot force anybody, but it may have ideas for the future to 
help this process come to a happy conclusion. 
  [EL PAIS] From your point of view as Bolivian president, 
what 
is the future of the Andean Pact? Apparently there is a bloc 
that functions well; Venezuela and Colombia, and the rest were 
left behind. 
  [Sanchez de Lozada] Yes, this is a complex situation. 
Remember that for various reasons our activities and attention 
have been especially dedicated to Chile and to Mercosur. We are 
planning to start in the next few months to look at the real 
situation of the Andean market. What happened is that the 
domestic political struggle is so intense that I am only now 
beginning to look at the world and the context in which the 
country is living since I was inaugurated. Based on the 
activities in which we are involved, we know there is a long way 
to get there. But we are trying to get closer to Mercosur 
because we believe it is more valid and hopeful. 
  [EL PAIS] And how do you see the "Amazon Initiative" started 
by Brazil? 
  [Sanchez de Lozada] Brazil believes that this should be 
enlarged, and that impulse should be given to a Latin American 
free trade common market. But we believe this will not occur 
until a locomotive exists. And the locomotive is Mercosur. 
  [EL PAIS] How are current relations between your country and 
Chile? 
  [Sanchez de Lozada] I believe substantial changes have 
occurred. My visit to Santiago, Chile, last October was very 
important. Bolivia and Chile are changing a lot, and we do not 
know what that means. But they are no longer the countries they 
were. It is an irony, but sometimes countries change more 
quickly than their leaders. We are carrying out polls in 
Bolivia and Chile, and it seems that our people have left us 
behind. We continue to look at the past, and they are looking 
at the future. But sometimes deep inside people there are still 
attitudes that only time will change. But we see changes among 
people, such as Frei's election, and my election, representing 
countries that are changing. Perhaps this means that problems 
that had no solution will have one now, but I cannot guarantee 
anything. One should be careful. 
  [EL PAIS] Are there still talks on the issue of diplomatic 
relations between Bolivia and Chile? 
  [Sanchez de Lozada] I would say not. Some people in Chile 
and Bolivia believe that the best of relations is not to have 
relations, and there are other people who believe it is very 
difficult to fight with someone if no relations exist. I 
believe relations could be established very soon, or they could 
be delayed. We want the steps to be taken to be not only 
symbolic, but truly effective. We are not putting forward 
conditions or demands, but want to move with boldness, but at 
the same time prudence.

  [Text] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada believes all 
alternatives must be sought for a sea outlet. He said this when 
he arrived in our country after participating as a guest 
observer in the fifth summit of Mercosur [Common Market of the 
South] countries. 
  As soon as he disembarked from the airplane, President 
Sanchez de Lozada said the remarks he made in Colonia were 
misinterpreted. In Colonia, he pointed out that Bolivia had 
finally discovered its sea outlet through the waterway and that, 
referring to the Pacific Ocean alternative, we had been looking 
in the wrong direction: 
  [Begin recording, in progress] ... in a wrong way. It was an 
ironic, allegorical sentence, saying that, through the waterway, 
we may hint at a sovereign outlet in a multinational way because 
we would be using a Bolivian port through which we would 
directly reach the Atlantic Ocean. 
  Now then, this does not mean, as some people wanted to 
interpret, that we have neglected our Amazon or Pacific destiny. 
We have not neglected our Pacific reality, the necessity of 
linking part of Bolivia, all of Bolivia, with the Pacific ports 
and the Amazon region. That is another sea outlet. [end 
recording] 
  For the president, the outlet to the Atlantic Ocean through 
the waterway is of great economic importance to our country 
because agricultural products, raw materials, and even 
manufactured products may be exported. 
  Concerning Mercosur's acceptance of Bolivia as a guest 
observer, journalists asked the president if this would entail a 
departure from the Andean Pact: 
  [Begin recording] We must talk with the Andean Pact people 
and see if there is a way of approaching Mercosur without losing 
contact with that Pacific bloc. 
  These are things that we must view wisely, but our policy is 
very effectively and very resolutely aimed at becoming a 
Mercosur member. [end recording] 
  The president also mentioned that a tripartite agreement 
among Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia has been reached to 
resolve the Pilcomayo River's environmental problems.

  [Excerpts] Bolivia and Paraguay have signed a letter of 
intent that can open prospects for selling gas to that country. 
This important document was signed during the visit Paraguayan 
Foreign Minister Luis Ramirez Boettner is paying to Bolivia. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Bolivian foreign minister and his Paraguayan counterpart 
today signed a major document of understanding that determinedly 
supports the construction of a gas pipeline between Puerta 
Grande, Bolivia, and Asuncion, Paraguay, for supplying Bolivian 
natural and liquefied petroleum gas to that nation. 
  [Begin Ramirez Boettner recording] I believe the work we did 
yesterday afternoon and today to prepare for the visit Bolivian 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada will pay to Paraguay on 14 
and 15 March has been very fruitful. 
  Among the issues we addressed -- because we addressed 
several 
issues -- one of the more important is the one dealing with the 
energy problem, that is, the possible sale of Bolivian gas to 
Paraguay. [end recording]. 
  In addition to the Bolivian president's visit to Paraguay, 
other major issues were considered like economic 
supplementation; a tripartite agreement on the Pilcomayo River 
by Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia; the Paraguay-Parana 
waterway; and the Trans-Chaco Highway. 
  Concerning the sale of gas to Paraguay, the price and volume 
will be decided at a meeting of specialists from Bolivian 
Government Oil Deposits and a Paraguayan private enterprise. 
  The construction of the gas pipeline will be totally 
financed 
with private capital. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The meeting that had been scheduled for 20 March in 
Formosa, Argentina, among Paraguayan President Juan Carlos 
Wasmosy, Argentine President Carlos Menem, and Bolivian 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has been postponed. The 
decision was prompted by the fact that Sanchez de Lozada could 
not attend the meeting, because he is scheduled to meet in La 
Paz with U.S. Vice President Al Gore on that day. 
  The three presidents had been scheduled to meet on 20 March 
to discuss the Pilcomayo River issue. Yet the above problem has 
forced a postponement of the "minisummit" to a later date. 
  During Sanchez de Lozada's recent visit to Asuncion, 
Bolivian 
Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga noted that the Formosa 
presidential summit might be postponed. It was confirmed 
yesterday at Lopez Palace that the meeting has in fact been 
postponed.

Bolivian poll give Sanchez de Lozada clear lead

<TEXT>
MR Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, a US-raised mine company owner, looks set to
be the new president of Bolivia, after the most peaceful elections in the
country's history, held on Sunday.
Unofficial results gave him a clear lead of almost 14 percentage points. His
Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) won 35 per cent of the vote,
against 21.1 per cent for the ruling Patriotic Accord (AP) led by a former
military dictator, ex-General Hugo Banzer.
Claiming victory yesterday, Mr Sanchez said: 'The people have voted for
change.'
However, the final outcome will emerge from a secret vote by Congress on
August 6. Projections of the results of the congressional elections, also
held on Sunday but not to be confirmed for 20 days, gave Mr Sanchez's party
69 of the 79 seats required for a majority. He will need a deal with one of
the 12 smaller parties.
Despite administrative problems, which have delayed voting in some areas
until next Sunday, the election proceeded smoothly under the supervision of
a new and independent electoral court.
The results confounded pollsters, all of whom had predicted a very close
contest. Mr Jose Gramunt, head of FIDES, the Bolivian news service,
described it as 'the best possible outcome'. He attributed the success of Mr
Sanchez to disillusion with the government, as well as to his choice of Mr
Vctor Hugo Cardenas, an indigenous politician, as his vice-presidential
running-mate. This made a contrast with the European-descended minority,
which provides most of Bolivia's politicians, and attracted many rural
voters.
Mr Sanchez is well-respected abroad as the author of a stabilisation plan in
1985 which reduced inflation from more than 24,000 per cent a year to 15 per
cent.
Bolivia now has one of the lowest inflation rates in South America, at 9 per
cent, but is also the continent's poorest country and has considerable
fiscal and balance-of-payment problems.
Mr Sanchez being pledged to continue the country's free market policies and
austerity programme, his victory was welcomed by the business community.

  [Text] Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada on 16 
March ratified in Buenos Aires his country's desire to join the 
Common Market of the South [Mercosur], which includes Argentina, 
Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay. The Bolivian president is here 
on an official visit, and during his first meeting with Carlos 
Menem he discussed the signing of several bilateral agreements. 
He also began discussions to obtain a measure of exception that 
will allow Bolivians who reside here to obtain their residence 
documents. 
  "For Bolivians, Argentina is practically their second 
fatherland. Thousands of Bolivians reside in Buenos Aires and 
throughout Argentina and contribute toward this country with 
their work," Sanchez de Losada said on his arrival in the 
country. 
  Regarding the possibility of joining Mercosur, the Bolivian 
president said: "I have very much wanted to approach Mercosur 
because we are a part of the Pacific's Amazon Basin, but we also 
belong to the River Plate Basin." But a diplomatic source 
indicated that the possibility is very remote and could only 
happen within the framework of a Brazilian initiative to create 
a giant South American common market. 
  Moreover, the agenda's main topic is the signing of an 
agreement that will permit the free exchange of gas, oil, and 
their by-products with an eye on bilateral integration in the 
energy sector. Argentine credits for the prevention of cholera 
in border areas is also an agenda topic.

<F P=106> ["jtr"-signed report: "Striving for Latin American </F>
Integration"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 30 May -- Bolivia's government wants to work 
toward making Latin America one, single, free trade zone in the 
medium-term. This association should then be integrated into 
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Bolivia's Trade 
and Industry Minister Carlos Morales said in Bonn. 
  "We want to make use of our Andes Group presidency this year 
to get on with Latin American economic integration," Morales 
said. That is why at the next Andes Group summit (including 
Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela) in September, the 
presidents of the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] 
countries, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay will also be 
invited. 
  The heads of state are planning a joint preparation of the 
all-American conference in Miami in December, which will be 
attended by government representatives from Canada, the United 
States, and Central and South America. Political and economic 
cooperation as well as the fight against drug dealing will be on 
the agenda. 
  Prior to that, on the occasion of the soccer World Cup 
opening match between Germany and Bolivia in Chicago, Bolivian 
President Sanchez de Lozada wants to discuss Latin America's 
future relations with the United States and the European Union 
[EU] with Chancellor Kohl and President Clinton. 
  For Morales, Latin America's integration within NAFTA is a 
long-term objective; "before that, we Latin Americans will have 
to do our homework." This means that each country has to 
stabilize and open up its economy. Therefore, since 1986, his 
country has gradually lowered its customs duties to 5 percent 
for capital goods and 10 percent for consumer goods. It is also 
important that the Mercosur countries quickly agree on common 
external duties. The line of conflict runs between Argentina 
and Brazil advocating comparatively high import duties on the 
one hand, and Paraguay, calling for a much lower import duty on 
the other. 
  Once Mercosur and the Andes Pact have stabilized, they are 
to 
be merged step by step, Morales said. "The Latin American free 
trade zone has to come into existence within the next 10 years, 
otherwise we will be helplessly facing a world of integrated 
blocs." The minister is convinced that the U.S. Administration 
prefers talking to a unified region to talking to individual 
countries. An exception to that is economically successful 
Chile, the next candidate to be accepted into NAFTA, Morales 
said.

  [Text] La Paz, 9 Jun (EFE) -- The Bolivian Foreign Ministry 
confirmed today that Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada and Chilean President Eduardo Frei will meet within the 
framework of the Fourth Ibero-American summit to be held in 
Cartagena, Colombia. 
  The Bolivian Foreign Ministry reported that the two heads of 
state, who will attend the Fourth Ibero-American summit on 14 
and 15 June, will take the opportunity to hold an informal 
meeting. 
  This will be the second time Sanchez de Lozada and Frei have 
met since August 1993; the other time was during Sanchez de 
Lozada's inauguration. 
  The Bolivian president took advantage of another 
international meeting, the Rio Group meeting in Santiago, to 
meet with Chilean President Patricio Aylwin and then Chilean 
President-elect Eduardo Frei. 
  Bolivia and Chile have had no diplomatic ties since 1962 -- 
except for a brief three-year period (1975-78) -- as a result of 
a territorial dispute and Bolivia's demand for a sovereign sea 
outlet to the Pacific across land that has belonged to Chile 
since the 19th century. 
  The Bolivian Congress authorized Sanchez de Lozada to travel 
to Colombia to attend the Ibero-American summit which will be 
attended by the heads of state from Latin America, Spain, and 
Portugal. The summit will be held in Cartagena on 14 and 15 
June. 
  Congress also authorized Sanchez de Lozada to travel to the 
United States, where he will attend the opening game of the 
World Soccer Cup at Soldier Field in Chicago; Bolivia will play 
Germany on 17 June.

  [Excerpt] After arriving in our country to settle the 
details, Bolivian Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Gumucio announced 
that Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada will make an 
official visit to Peru. According to the Bolivian official, the 
Bolivian president will arrive in Lima on 5 July. Diplomatic 
sources indicated that Sanchez de Lozada's visit will be an 
opportunity to promote mutual cooperation and integration. 
  The confirmation of such an important visit was made by the 
Bolivian vice foreign minister at a time when there is a lot of 
interest in Peru to increase trade ties that began with the 
installation of an industrial free zone in the port of Ilo. 
  The Foreign Ministry has also reported that President 
Alberto 
Fujimori has officially invited Colombian President Cesar 
Gaviria to visit the country. In a letter he sent to Gaviria, 
Fujimori highlights the close ties that unite the two nations. 
The invitation was made as a result of the visit Fujimori made 
to Bogota in February. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The Chilean Government has indicated that it is 
fully prepared to begin a "new era" of relations with Bolivia by 
evaluating positively Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada's most recent remarks about not tying any future step 
toward the resumption of diplomatic relations to the beginning 
of talks on Bolivia's lack of a sea outlet. 
  It has been explained, however, that the positive reaction 
of 
the Chilean Government does not imply that diplomatic relations 
will be resumed immediately. 
  Chilean politicians stated that Sanchez de Lozada's 
statement 
was "very positive" and praised the president's modern and 
daring approach. 
  Both government and political circles, however, agree that 
the remarks of the Bolivian president should be taken prudently 
bearing in mind that there are people in Bolivia whose position 
toward Chile and what they call "Bolivia's landlocked situation" 
is very hard and inflexible. [passage omitted] 
  Foreign Relations Under Secretary Rodrigo Diaz Albonico 
said: 
"We were very happy to hear what Bolivian President Gonzalo 
Sanchez de Lozada had to say." 
  Jorge Pizarro, speaker for the foreign relations committee 
of 
the Chamber of Deputies, believes that Sanchez de Lozada's 
remarks "are extraordinarily positive and reflect that the 
Bolivian president has a modern and daring approach to what 
relations between the states should be as far as the process of 
integration is concerned, in order to further the social and 
economic development of our peoples." 
  Experts in Bolivian-Chilean relations believe that rather 
than a change in Bolivia's foreign policy, there is a new and 
promising approach, confirmed by the fact the Sanchez de Lozada 
attended the Rio Group presidential summit in Santiago last year. 
  "After what Sanchez de Lozada said, it is assumed that this 
so-called `new approach' will lead Bolivia to begin talks aimed 
at reestablishing diplomatic relations in the not too distant 
future," the experts said. 
  Despite the remarks of the Bolivian president, the sources 
are not sure whether Bolivia's strategy is to resume relations 
and immediately tackle the sea outlet issue or to deal with both 
issues simultaneously. 
  Chile does not acknowledge any pending issues between the 
two 
countries on the grounds that there are treaties in effect, 
especially the 1904 treaty, which establish the current border 
between the two countries. Thus, Chile did not accept any 
conditions when the resumption of ties was proposed in the past. 
  The Foreign Ministry under secretary pointed out that the 
Bolivian president used the expression "new era" which is the 
same one Diaz Albonico used when he went to La Paz last year. 
The under secretary said that this was highly significant. 
  As to Bolivia's new willingness to approach the resumption 
of 
diplomatic ties without first tackling its so-called "landlocked 
situation," Albonico said that Sanchez de Lozada's words should 
be studied carefully. 
  He added, however, that the remarks of the Bolivian 
president 
augur a change in the political relations between the two 
countries, that may free them from past problems.

BRAZIL and Bolivia yesterday finalised an accord - first mooted in 1938 -
for a Dollars 3bn project to build one of the world's largest gas pipelines
amid considerable uncertainty over the financing.
Brazil's President Itamar Franco flew to the Bolivian town of Cochabamba to
sign the protocol to begin work on the 3,400km pipeline to supply Bolivian
gas to the main industrial centres of Brazil.
The first large project of Mr Franco's government, it aims to reduce the
country's almost total dependence on oil from the Middle East. It was hailed
by Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's foreign minister, as a solid
achievement for the government.
But it is unclear how funds will be raised for such an ambitious project.
Bolivia is one of the continent's poorest countries and Brazil continues to
wallow in economic crisis; its access to multilateral financing has been
inhibited by the collapse of its last accord with the International Monetary
Fund.
Negotiations are under way with the World Bank and private sector but a
Foreign Ministry spokesman said yesterday: 'We have not yet decided such
technical points as finance.'
The pipeline will transport daily 8m cubic metres, rising to 16m cu metres,
of natural gas from Santa Cruz de la Sierra in southern Bolivia to the six
principal cities of southern Brazil.
While diversifying Brazil's energy grid it will also reduce pollution and
save money; the price agreed is equivalent to Dollars 6 per barrel.
The pipeline will provide an important source of new income for Bolivia,
which is trying to reduce its dependence on tin and coca leaf. Previously
all its gas was sold to Argentina.
The signing of the accord is an important victory for the Sao Paulo business
community which has long been lobbying for it against heavy opposition from
Petrobras, the state oil company which fears its monopoly will be
threatened.
On the eve of Mr Franco's departure for Bolivia, Petrobras officials were
still trying to turn him against the idea, arguing it would be better to buy
from Paraguay.

  [Text] Brasilia, 20 Mar (EFE) -- The foreign ministers and 
government delegates of the 13 Rio Group countries on 21 March 
will open in Brasilia a 48-hour meeting that will serve to sound 
out their preferences in the election of the next OAS secretary 
general. 
  The meeting will be held on the eve of the 27 March vote in 
Washington, at which the continent's 35 foreign ministers will 
choose the replacement for Brazilian diplomat Joao Baena Soares 
as OAS secretary general. 
  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli -- who is 
one of the three candidates for the post -- will attend the 
three work sessions of the ministerial meeting, which will be 
held on 21 and 22 March at Itamaraty, the Brazilian Foreign 
Ministry headquarters. 
  The other candidates are Colombian President Cesar Gaviria 
and Costa Rican Foreign Minister Berns Niehaus. 
  Even though it is not on the meeting's agenda, the OAS 
secretary general's election will be discussed in the corridors 
and even during formal sessions, which are flexible and during 
which any delegate can raise an issue, diplomatic sources told 
EFE. 
  Brazil, the country that hosts the meeting in its capacity 
as 
holder of the annually rotating secretariat of the most 
important Latin American political forum, supports Gaviria and 
is confident he will win, a high-ranking Itamaraty official told 
EFE. 
  Gaviria should win, despite the fact that "the situation has 
not yet reached a definitive status," he said. 
  The majority of Rio Group countries that referred to the 
matter -- Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Brazil, Peru, and Mexico 
-- support Gaviria. 
  The Costa Rican candidate has assured that he has the 
support 
of the Caribbean and Central American bloc, while the Venezuelan 
candidate has called on his two opponents to hold a television 
debate to be aired to the entire continent for the purpose of 
outlining their positions toward the OAS. 
  The winner of the 27 March vote will be installed during the 
OAS general assembly to be held from 5-10 June in the Amazon 
city of Belem do Para (northern Brazil), the hometown of Baena 
Soares, a former Brazilian deputy foreign minister who has held 
the OAS secretariat for two consecutive five-year periods since 
1984. 
  The Rio Group ministers and government delegates will 
address 
various international issues dealing with commerce, disarmament, 
UN bylaws' reform, the environment, the antinarcotics fight, 
democracy, human rights, and initiatives to end the military 
regime in Haiti. 
  They also will exchange views and seek a consensus on the 
position of Latin American governments on a continental summit 
called by U.S. President Bill Clinton for December in Miami. 
  The ministerial meeting will coincide with the official 
visit 
of 5.5 hours that U.S. Vice President Alberto Gore will pay to 
Brasilia on 21 March with the objective of promoting the 
continental summit with Brazilian President Itamar Franco. 
  Gore today began in La Paz a short tour of Latin America 
that 
will include stopovers in Buenos Aires and Brasilia. 
  Meanwhile, Trinidad and Tobago Foreign Minister Ralph Maraja 
and Jorge Gordillo, one of Peru's deputy foreign ministers, 
already have arrived in Brasilia to attend the Rio Group meeting. 
  Foreign Ministers Celso Amorim (Brazil), Antonio Aranibar 
(Bolivia), Miguel Angel Burelli (Venezuela), Luis Ramirez 
Boettner (Paraguay), Manuel Tello (Mexico), Gladys de Vielman 
(Guatemala), Carlos Figueroa (Chile), and Sergio Abreu (Uruguay) 
have confirmed that they will attend. 
  Other delegations scheduled to arrive today or on 21 March 
will be headed by Argentine Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando 
Petrella and Colombian Deputy Foreign Minister Andelfo Garcia, 
while Ecuador will be represented by its ambassador in Brasilia, 
Cesar Valdivieso.

   Governing party candidate Gonzalo Sanchez
de Lozada today claimed an upset election victory over former
military dictator Hugo Banzer Suarez, but the congress will have
final say over who becomes president.
   Neither candidate appeared to have won more than 50 percent of
the vote in Sunday's election so, by law, the new congress will
choose the president.
   Nevertheless, Sanchez de Lozada's surprising finish provided a
kind of public endorsement of the government's conservative,
free-market economic program, which has included severe austerity
measures.
   It also was expected to help ensure continuity in this
impoverished country's U.S.-financed war on cocaine production and
trafficking.
   All 27 Senate and 130 House of Deputies seats were also up for
election, but officials said there would be no clear indication on
how each party had fared until later today.
   No official figures were available and the tally was expected to
take nearly three weeks to complete as votes arrived from remote
parts of the landlocked, largely undeveloped South American country.
   An independent television station, the Bolivian Television
Association, said Banzer of the center-right Nationalist Democratic
Action party led with 27.7 percent of the vote to 27.3 percent for
Sanchez de Lozada of the Conservative Revolutionary Nationalist
Movement.
   It based its computerized projections on a tally of 851,437
votes of the estimated 1.8 million cast nationwide.
   The station said, however, that Sanchez de Lozada was projected
to eventually pull ahead a percentage point when the rural vote
came in. Banzer was strong in cities, which reported their returns
quickly,. Sanchez de Lozada was counting on a big vote from the
countryside.
   Sanchez de Lozada's campaign manager, Andres Petricevic, said
his party projected a victory with 29 percent of the vote to 27
percent for Banzer.
   Late Sunday, Banzer's party refused to concede defeat but said
it would respect the ``will of the people.''
   Jaime Paz Zamora of the Social Democratic Movement of the
Revolutionary Left was running third with 204,717 votes or 22.3
percent. Six other contenders trailed far behind.
   The new congress convenes on Aug. 4 and will have two days to
select the president, whose inauguration to a four-year term is
scheduled for Aug. 6.
   Banzer, 62, had sought victory by a margin of 5 percentage
points or more to oblige congress to respect the popular vote and
name him president. He finished first in the 1985 election with
28.6 percent but congress picked the runner-up, Victor Paz
Estenssoro, who had 26.4 percent.
   The 81-year-old incumbent is retiring after a tumultuous career
that spanned half a century and included three periods as president.
   Sanchez de Lozada, 58, said on the eve of the election that he
felt confident of being picked president if he finished first or a
close second. A wealthy mine owner, he was educated in the United
States and has a philosophy degree from the University of Chicago.
   Most opinion polls showed Banzer as the front-runner this year
and he was confident enough to say his party would back whomever
finished first. He called on other parties to do the same but,
trailing in the polls, they declined.
   The vote took place in a holiday-like atmosphere, with a calm
and order remarkable for what once was the continent's most
politically volatile country. Since the turn of the century there
have been 13 coups; with nine governments between 1978 and 1982.
   Some irregularities were reported, including the arrest of three
people who carried several different identity cards and apparently
planned to vote several times. There also were reports that some
voters were given already marked ballots, but foreign observers
said they had no initial indications of widespread fraud.
   Paz Estenssoro said upon casting his ballot that the elections
would help lead Bolivians to political maturity. ``The important
thing is to consolidate democracy,'' he said.
   He launched a severe economic program when he took office in
1985 to halt economic chaos, including an annual inflation rate of
23,000 percent.
   The austerity measures included laying off 35,000 state miners
and other public workers, a tenfold increase in the price of
gasoline and a 95 percent currency devaluation.
   Banzer, Sanchez de Lozada and Paz Zamora pledged to maintain the
program, which has cut inflation to 15 percent a year and
contributed to some small economic growth for the first time in a
decade.
   In addition, they all vowed to continue the government's battle
against cocaine production and trafficking. The United States
provides about $55 million dollars a year for the efforts, which
include programs to reduce coca leaf cultivation in Bolivia's
jungles.

FT  14 JUL 93 / Business and the Environment: Battle for the heartland of
South America - Plans to create a 3,400km waterway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rivers of South America have been largely untravelled since they were
used by conquistadores, explorers and traders to settle the continent's
heartland. Now, once again, the peace may be about to be disrupted.
Plans are under way to transform the Paraguay and Parana rivers into a
3,400km waterway that would link the often impoverished interior with
seaports at the River Plate estuary. The waterway would be quick, easy and
cheap to create.
The governments of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, whose
territory the rivers flow through, are seeking international finance to set
up the waterway, known as the Hidrovia. It could become one of the region's
biggest development projects since the construction of the Itaipu dam in the
1980s.
Predictably, the project has met with hostility from environmentalists.
Argentine and US scientists said in a recently published study that the
Hidrovia could threaten the environment. They also doubted its economic
viability. The report, produced by Wetlands for the Americas, a conservation
group, and supported by the prestigious Woods Hole Research Institute in the
US, warns of water pollution from spills of oil and chemical cargoes.
River life, wildlife and the surrounding land would be affected by the
increased river traffic and the civil engineering projects required to make
the rivers navigable.
The main threat, says the report, is to Brazil's vast Pantanal marshland.
The 200,000 sq km Pantanal not only supports a rich diversity of wildlife,
but acts as a gigantic sponge, regulating water levels in the Paraguay
river. Damaging the Pantanal's sponge function 'may result in an overlap of
the peak flooding period in both the Parana and Paraguay rivers, which can
increase the risk of both catastrophic rises and extreme lows in water level
along the middle and lower Parana River'.
Changes in the region's hydrology would exacerbate alterations already
caused by the large Itaipu dam and add to potential impacts caused by other
dams under construction on the Paraguay and Parana Rivers.
The Hidrovia could also cause further problems. 'It is very likely that the
greatest environmental impacts caused by the Hidrovia will be indirect,
given the rapid development process that may follow the starting of the
operations in the waterway,' the report says.
Better transport would inevitably increase human occupation and bring
environmental disruption. This could also lead to an expansion of diseases
such as malaria, dengue and yellow fever and the spread of water-borne
diseases.
The Hidrovia would help bring vast new areas of land under cultivation in
the heart of the continent, replacing native vegetation. This could increase
soil erosion and the silting of rivers. Increased use of agrochemicals would
damage river life. Industrial mining and gold wildcatting, which already
threaten the Pantanal, could also increase.
The authors attack as superficial a previous economic feasibility study
carried out by Brazilian consultants which estimated the Hidrovia's rate of
return at 16-23 per cent. This report has been used by governments to
support the Hidrovia's viability. But Wetlands for the Americas claims that
the benefits are overstated and environmental costs are not taken into
consideration.
Without attempting a detailed estimate of these costs, the Wetlands report
says the economic benefits are probably significantly less than claimed and
could even be negative.
However, Jesus Gonzalez, the Argentine government official on the Hidrovia's
executive committee, recently promised a full-scale environmental impact
study, and said the project would be shelved if the potential damage were
too high. This is in keeping with greater government sensitivity to the
environment throughout the region. Governments are under pressure from
industrial countries, lending agencies and to some extent their own
populations to protect the environment. The Inter-American Development Bank
is financing environmental consultants to carry out impact studies.
However, experience in Latin America has shown that government assurances to
safeguard the environment must be treated with scepticism.
The Wetlands' report is only an opening shot in a battle between
environmentalists and a powerful development lobby of farmers, international
lending agencies, big business and governments that is likely to become
increasingly bitter.

   Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada of the
governing party and Hugo Banzer, a former military dictator,
claimed victory Monday in a close presidential race, and Congress
will choose the winner.
   Officials said the outcome of Sunday's presidential and
congressional elections were an endorsement of the government's
economic austerity program, which both Banzer and Sanchez de Lozada
supported.
   Since none of the nine presidential candidates got a majority,
the new Congress will convene Aug. 4 to elect Bolivia's 77th
president, who will inaugurated two days later for a four-year term.
   ``The tendencies are clear,'' Sanchez de Lozada told a news
conference Monday. ``I will be the next president of Bolivia, and
my primary goals will be social programs and economic stability.''
   Jaime Cespedes, a spokesman for Banzer, claimed victory for his
party and said: ``We will not accept the victory of Sanchez de
Lozada because the only victory acceptable is that of the electoral
court. There is evidence to indicate fraud and the annulment of
votes favorable to Banzer.''
   Foreign observers who visited voting places throughout the
country reported some problems that appeared to stem from the
ignorance of rural electoral officials, but said they found no
evidence of widespread fraud.
   U.S. Ambassador Robert Gelbard told journalists his office
monitored the vote in eight cities and found only minor
irregularities. He called it ``one of the most impressive Latin
American elections in contemporary times.''
   The electoral college is to present its final tally May 28.
   Bolivia's constitution requires Congress to choose the president
when no candidate gets a majority. The 27 seats in the Senate and
130 in the House of Deputies will be divided among the parties
according to the number of votes they received in each electoral
region.
   A projection by the private Bolivian Television Association said
Sanchez de Lozada's government party would gain four Senate seats
to 13 and Banzer's party would lose four, leaving it with five
members.
   It said Sanchez de Lozada would have 38 seats in the new Chamber
of Deputies, maintaining the current two-seat advantage over the 36
of Banzer's party.
   Eight other parties would share the rest of the seats.
   According to the Television Association's tally of 1,059,305
votes, an estimated 60 percent of those cast, Banzer and his
center-right Nationalist Democratic Action led with 284,028 votes,
or 26.8 percent, and Sanchez de Lozada of the conservative
Revolutionary Nationalist Movement was a close second with 279,385,
or 26.4 percent.
   Jaime Paz Zamora of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left was
third with 233,568 votes, or 22.1 percent, it said.
   The projection said Sanchez de Lozada probably would pull ahead
of Banzer by one or two percentage points when the vote came in
from rural areas, where early returns showed him with a solid lead.
That would put Sanchez de Lozada, 58, in a good position to win
congressional approval.
   Banzer, 62, seized power in 1971 and was forced out in 1978. He
said before the elections that all candidates should support the
one who won the most votes.
   Information Minister Herman Antelo told The Associated Press on
Monday: ``In the name of President Victor Paz Estenssoro, I would
like to express satisfaction for the form and results of the
election. Independently of who is the winner, more than two thirds
of the population has given its endorsement to the government's
economic policy and the need to continue with it.''
   The 81-year-old incumbent is retiring after a career that
spanned half a century and included three periods as president.
   Sanchez de Lozada, a wealthy mine owner, was educated in the
United States and has a philosophy degree from the University of
Chicago.
   Voting was calm and orderly in what once was the continent's
most politically volatile country. Since the turn of the century
there have been 13 coups, with nine governments between 1978 and
1982.

   In the 1970s, banks overflowed with money to
lend and South Americans were ready to borrow it. Today the South
Americans struggle just to pay the interest on the loans, let alone
the principal. Foreign debt is emptying South America's pocketbook.
This is another in a series of periodic reports by The Associated
Press on the economic, social and political turbulence that has
turned South America into a continent in crisis.

   Across South America, the crushing burden of foreign debt piled
up largely by military governments no longer in power is stifling
economies, stirring unrest in the masses and threatening fragile
democracies.
   Some leaders see the crisis as an opening for radical populists
with radical solutions _ debt moratoriums or outright repudiation
of debt, for example _ and, in turn, the possibility of military
rule once more.
   Foreign debt is likely to be a major issue in presidential
elections this year Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Bolivia and
Uruguay.
   Compounding the debt problem, however, are factors that have
pervaded South American nations long before they went on a
borrowing binge _ mismanagement, corruption, and accumulations of
vast wealth in cities while hand-to-mouth poverty and illiteracy
persisted in the countryside.
   Colombia and Peru face the additional burdens of guerrilla wars
and the illegal cocaine trade.
   Ten South American nations owe a total of $277.4 billion,
according to compilations of the Economic Commission for Latin
America, and repayments are taking a heavy toll on their economies
and the livelihood of their peoples:
   _ Five years ago Brazilians could buy a cookstove for what it
costs them now to buy a kilo of black beans; inflation has soared
to 1,000 percent yearly and the cruzado currency has been devalued
by a factor of 1 million.
   _ In Colombia, Peru and Bolivia efforts to cope with mounting
debts have opened the way to a $10-billion cocaine trade that feeds
the starved economies with hard currency and provides jobs for the
unemployed. Drug money threatens to erode accepted economic and
political systems.
   _ In Argentina, once one of the world's wealthiest nations, the
$80 billion gross domestic product has stagnated for a decade and
the value of the austral currency steadily declines.
   _ In Venezuela where oil once brought wealth, poverty is rising
fast: a survey of 2.3 million families in 1981 by the Latin
American Institute of Social Research showed 22 percent were poor;
its survey of more than 3 million in 1987 showed the rate had risen
to 54 percent. Three days of rioting over price increases in late
February and early March left 276 people dead and more than 1,000
injured and conditions remain tense.
   ``The riots were the result of a crisis that can be written in
capital letters _ the foreign debt,'' said Carlos Andres Perez,
Venezuela's president.
   ``A debt paid with misery is a bill that will eventually be paid
with democracy,'' said President Jose Sarney of Brazil, which has
the highest of the Third World's foreign debt, $115 billion.
   ``Democracy is losing ground in Latin America because the
solutions it has presented do not attend national problems. We
offer pessimistic solutions, and the parties of the left optimistic
ones.''
   Said Argentina's President Raul Alfonsin: ``The misery, the
depressing conditions of life, the lack of food, housing, health,
training, education, and jobs create a culture dish that can be
exploited by `ultras' and extremists of whatever tendency.''
   Foreign debt has become increasingly politicized on the
continent.
   It is a top issue in the election campaigns in Brazil and
Argentina, where leftist or populist candidates are front-runners.
   They began entering the picture as governments cut wages and
subsidies on basic goods and services to meet creditor demands for
economic austerity. The cuts resulted in sharply reduced living
standards on top of stalled economic growth.
   A plan announced in March by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady acknowledges for the first time that the Third World's debt
may not be payable.
   Though still sketchy, Brady's proposal to eliminate 20 percent
of debt marks a distinct turn from the Reagan administration's
policy of piling new loans on old.
   Banks, too, now recognize that only debt relief will avoid
explosive social unrest and guarantee at least partial payment.
   ``Voluntary debt reduction is a necessary part of any future
debt strategy,'' said William Rhodes, head of the Citicorp
debt-restructuring committee.
   Most South American governments have long cried for creditors to
share responsibility for the lending bonanza of the 1970s, when
most of their debt was accrued by military governments without
popular mandates.
   They argue that banks, flush with petrodollars from the 1973 oil
crisis, were looking for ways to invest. Latin American nations,
which were posting 4 to 5 percent growth rates and hadn't defaulted
on a debt since the 1930s, seemed a good prospect.
   But many experts now say the banks took undue risks, failing to
verify how the money was spent and ignoring repayment
possibilities. Money was lent at floating interest rates, which in
the 1970s were at a low of 1 percent.
   Though much of the borrowed money was used for important
development projects such as roads, airports and hydroelectric
dams, much more was wasted.
   The Brazilian military government spent an estimated $20 billion
on a program to build 10 nuclear plants by 1980. But only one has
been built _ a plant nicknamed ``lightening bug'' because it shuts
down so often _ and parts for three others rust in warehouses.

<F P=106> ["Text" of address by Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio </F>
Aranibar Quiroga to the 24th OAS General Assembly in Belem do 
Para, Brasil -- released by the Bolivian Foreign Ministry 
Diplomatic Information General Directorate in La Paz on 8 June] 
  [Text] "Bolivia is immensely grateful to the Inter-American 
community for its support over our just claim to a sea outlet as 
expressed in 11 resolutions issued by the OAS General Assembly. 
This support constitutes an OAS political and diplomatic legacy 
toward our most important international dispute, which is yet 
unresolved and which undermines our morale and our economic 
development. The sea is an essential part of Bolivia's material 
and spiritual integrity. We need a solution to this problem, 
and we are obliged to find it. 
  "The community of the Americas has unequivocally recognized 
the need for the two involved countries to achieve a peaceful 
and friendly solution to the landlocked situation Bolivia has 
endured since it lost its sea coast during the Pacific War. 
This negotiation at the OAS level does not conflict with 
bilateral or trilateral discussions on this issue, nor with 
inevitable direct negotiations on the maritime issue. On the 
contrary, they are in line with the friendly spirit that must 
reign in hemispheric relations. It is only normal for nations 
of the Americas to be concerned and to urge those countries 
involved in unresolved conflicts to find friendly solutions. 
  "Was it not the support of the countries of the Americas 
which paved the way for achieving the Torrijos-Carter agreements 
through which Panama regained its sovereignty over the Panama 
Canal? Was it not the support of the international community 
which led to peace between Palestine and Israel? Was it not the 
support of the international community which helped to 
definitely eradicate apartheid in South Africa? 
  "I believe we are all obliged to build a peaceful, friendly, 
and secure region for our children. 
  "Although the future seems bright, both Chile and Bolivia 
are 
determined to establish conditions and measures of mutual trust 
and tolerance, and despite renewed appeals by the OAS General 
Assembly, it is obvious that the governments directly involved 
have been unable to achieve a suitable satisfactory solution. 
  "The international scenario has witnessed changes and 
advancements at the end of this century which seemed utopian a 
few years back. Ideological and racial barriers, and conflicts 
between nations are giving way to agreements that honor justice, 
solidarity, and international peace. 
  "In view of this why should countries tied by a common 
heritage be unable to achieve agreements that will restore 
Bolivia's original status as a Pacific rim country, and 
definitely heal old wounds? 
  "There is no legal argument in the world that can override 
the deep feeling of a nation that tells our governments to end 
their defensive and negative positions, and formal speeches for 
the sake of creative measures that will allow the establishment 
of ethical international relations. 
  "We believe in integration and in the complementation of 
countries with common interests that are able to ban chauvinism 
and misunderstandings for the sake of uniting their efforts and 
overcoming the challenges of a future filled with uncertainties, 
in which the one single enemy is the poverty of our countries. 
  "Latin America is living in an era of democracy and cohesive 
cooperation that demands a consensus. A new mentality of trust 
and credibility is taking hold in the region. A mentality in 
which neighbors do not look upon each other as potential 
antagonists. One in which the creative force of our countries 
is surging. One in which there is a clear awareness that the 
countries of the region are one family and that they must unite 
under the new breezes sweeping through contemporary history. 
  "We must support each other, without impositions or 
exclusions. We must engage in common undertakings, encourage our 
reciprocal knowledge, promote the rapprochement of our 
societies, strengthen our cultural ties, and tear down the 
fences of misunderstanding, prejudice, dogmas, and 
insensitivity. This is definitely the state of mind with which 
we must welcome the next century. 
  "Not so long ago, as a result of the new mentality upheld by 
their respective administrations, and by overcoming Chaco War 
grievances, Paraguay and Bolivia were able to achieve a 
long-sought historic rapprochement. Current ties and friendly 
relations bind today the two countries which optimistically seek 
excellent rewards from trade, road interconnections, the 
Paraguay-Parana waterway, the Pilcomayo river, and other 
similarly important projects. Bolivian-Paraguayan ties 
constitute a model for Latin America and an example that should 
be followed. 
  "For the good of the Latin American community, the same is 
occurring among other countries in the region where neighboring 
countries which, until recently were faced with what seemed 
insurmountable rivalries, have resolved long-standing border 
problems in an exemplary manner, achieving an excellent level of 
ties. 
  "Recent developments allow us to view with prudent optimism 
Bolivian-Chilean ties. Meetings between high-ranking government 
officials have been cordial. During President Gonzalo Sanchez 
de Lozada's trip to Santiago, Chile, on the occasion of the Rio 
Group presidential summit, several meetings were held between 
the Bolivian and Chilean presidents. The preponderant role the 
Catholic Churches of Chile and of Bolivia have played in this 
process is also worthy of mentioning. It is clear, however, 
that despite all auspicious circumstances that have been 
discussed, Bolivia continues to suffer the consequences of its 
landlocked situation. This is undoubtedly one of the most clear 
obstacles in the path of full integration in the Americas. 
  "I am certain that all the countries represented here hope 
to 
see noble gestures from the countries involved and, by the next 
OAS General Assembly, bear witness to a solution to this issue. 
  "The challenge facing the new administrations of Bolivia and 
Chile today is to build together a future of peace and 
cooperation. There is no better inspiration to achieve this goal 
than the conviction expressed by the great Chilean Poet Vicente 
Huidobro who said: `As a Chilean and as a human being, I believe 
and assert that we must negotiate with Bolivia as soon as 
possible and that the two countries should and must resolve the 
serious issue involving Bolivia's outlet to the sea fraternally 
and with generosity.'"

<TEXT>
   From the heights of the Andes to the
tropical lowlands, Pope John Paul II has carried a message of
self-reliance and prodded Latin Americans to take the initiative in
solving their deep social and political problems.
   From combating drug trafficking and corruption to stemming the
``brain drain,'' the pope has argued that it is up to the people
themselves to do battle.
   Addressing a Mass on Saturday in the Amazon basin city of
Trinidad, the pope insisted that ``constant, intense, honest and
efficient work by everyone'' was needed to overcome poverty.
   ``We can't expect everything from outside,'' he said.
   The 12-day tour of Uruguay, Bolivia, Peru and Paraguay is John
Paul's ninth pilgrimage to a region he calls ``the continent of
hope.''
   Many people along his route have hoped for his help and
blessings. About 20 women occupied a Roman Catholic church Saturday
in Lima, Peru, to ask the pope to intercede for leftist rebels held
in prison.
   The group occupied the Sacred Heart of Jesus Church, 12 blocks
from a seminary where the pope was to speak Sunday. Witnesses told
reporters that police took the protesters away in vans. Police
confirmed the incident but said they had no information on arrests.
   John Paul was scheduled to meet there with priests, nuns and
seminary students, as well as celebrate an open air Mass and close
a conference of Latin American bishops, before moving on Monday to
his last stop in Paraguay.
   The Vatican estimates that half the world's Roman Catholics, who
now number 860 million, will be living in Latin America by the turn
of the century.
   The pontiff has been greeted here by wildly enthusiastic crowds.
Entire cities have turned out to see him. Schoolboys have run after
his popemobile in motorcades, and schoolgirls have screamed as if
he were a rock star as he entered a stadium for a youth rally.
   The pontiff has avoided blaming the Latin American people for
their difficulties. At a Mass Friday in tropical Santa Cruz,
Bolivia, for example, he lamented the region's ``excessive
economic, technological, political and cultural dependence.'' In a
social encyclical issued in March, which he often has cited here,
the pope blamed many of the Third World's problems on the East-West
superpower rivalry.
   Meeting with unemployed miners in the high Andean city of Oruro,
Bolivia, and later addressing a Mass in Santa Cruz, the pope
deplored both the excesses of free-market capitalism and Marxism.
   But he also said in improvised remarks in Santa Cruz that the
key for Latin Americans in resolving East-West, left-right
divisions is found ``here, in your human, social and Christian
realities.''
   Drug trafficking emerged as a major theme as the pope visited
eastern Bolivia, where cocaine barons ship narcotics to consumers
in the United States and Western Europe.
   John Paul, while flying to South America, told reporters it was
unfair to punish only poor South American countries for drug
trading. But he challenged his audiences in Bolivia to take on the
traffickers, declaring that the rampant corruption was destroying
their society.
   The pope insisted that an answer lay in following ethical,
Christian values _ not public and private immorality.

  [Text] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada's government 
yesterday confirmed its inflexible will to overcome our 
landlocked status, 115 years after losing the port of 
Antofagasta. 
  A Foreign Ministry communique notes: "The policy of 
recovering Bolivia's sea outlet follows the world 
democratization, trade opening, cooperation enhancement, and 
true integration processes." 
  The communique adds: "Bolivia's access to the Pacific Ocean, 
through a free, sovereign, and useful outlet, through diplomatic 
procedures, is a priority for our country and our government. 
It is supported by the hemispheric community." 
  The then-Bolivian port of Antofagasta was seized on 14 
February 1879 by the Chilean Army, thus initiating the "War of 
the Pacific;" a military conflict that involved the Republic of 
Peru and ended in the loss by Bolivia of the Littoral Department 
to Chile. 
  The national territory's amputation was consummated through 
a 
Peace and Borders Treaty signed under Chilean pressure in 1904 
which sentenced Bolivia to become a landlocked country. Various 
attempts to negotiate a revision of the treaty have failed due 
to the Chilean unswerving refusal to consider Bolivian 
aspirations. 
  Diplomatic relations between the two countries have been 
severed since 1962, apart from a brief interval during the 
government of former de facto President Hugo Banzer. 
  The Foreign Ministry notes that the sea recovery claim will 
remain unchanged in all international forums. 
  The Foreign Ministry says: "We are committed to pursue, at 
the appropriate forums and based on a national consensus, the 
appropriate actions to favorably resolve Bolivia's sea claim, 
thus implementing justice in international relations and an 
effective Latin American fraternity."

<F P=106> [By Manuel Robles Sosa] </F>
  [Text] La Paz, 13 Jun (PL) -- The Ibero-American Summit 
being held this week in Cartagena de Indias should serve to 
consolidate that international forum, according to Bolivian 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada. 
  The chief of state made this statement in an interview 
granted to PRENSA LATINA before beginning an overseas tour that 
will include his participation in the Ibero-American Summit. He 
described the summit as important to help the member-countries 
coordinate their policies, adding that it will serve as a 
fitting venue for the presidents to discuss topics that interest 
them. 
  [Robles] Mr. President, what are your expectations regarding 
the Fourth Ibero-American Summit? What do you think the 
summit's priorities should be? 
  [Sanchez] Regarding the Ibero-American Summit, I must note 
that it is a meeting whose importance is undeniable to the 
extent that it will permit the definitive consolidation of this 
international forum and will serve as a hub for relations among 
member-countries. 
  In keeping with modern times, the most important topics will 
deal with the implementation of the most dynamic mechanisms of 
commercial exchange and regional and subregional integration. 
At the same time, such mechanisms could serve as the means to 
aid the various countries in their struggle to consolidate their 
internal development and to strengthen the social policies that 
will improve the living standards of the people. 
  [Robles] What is your assessment of the Ibero-American 
summits held so far? Do you think they have met expectations? 
  [Sanchez] The preceding summits were highly significant, 
because for the first time we set up a mechanism for 
Ibero-American relations. In this area, we can stress two 
principal achievements: 
  A. Following its inception, policies are now coordinated 
among member-countries, and cooperation and integration among 
the countries have improved, both on the bilateral and 
multilateral level. 
  B. Attendance at these summits is significant, considering 
that the presidents avail themselves of such meetings to discuss 
topics that are of particular interest, especially on the 
bilateral level. 
  Also, I must note, that on this occasion the meeting will 
broach the problem of the native and Indian peoples of the 
continent. This demonstrates that important progress has been 
made in identifying the new social problems and permits 
consolidating and strengthening the democratic processes in the 
region. 
  [Robles] Considering the importance your administration 
attaches to international cooperation, what are your 
expectations regarding the Ibero-American Summit is this area? 
  [Sanchez] This Ibero-American Summit must attempt to 
strengthen the objectives outlined in previous summits and also 
render a renewed impetus for regional integration, through the 
analysis of topics such as trade, sustained development, and 
cooperation, seeking to alleviate the existing social problems. 
  [Robles] Some time ago your government announced a 
diplomatic 
plan of action aimed at decriminalizing the international trade 
of the coca leaf. Will you broach this option at the 
Ibero-American Summit? 
  [Sanchez] At the next summit, the Bolivian Government will 
present findings to the rest of the countries that demonstrate 
the process of structural reforms undertaken and the new views 
to be implemented in terms of efforts against drug trafficking. 
  [Robles] How do you view Latin American integration, its 
progress, and perspectives? 
  [Sanchez] Latin American integration is at a stage of 
complete development, seeking to consolidate its main mechanisms 
by reviewing and updating them. This new view includes a common 
perception on the viability of open regionalism, whereby 
countries that conform to different mechanisms will encounter 
fewer obstacles in negotiating with similar regional groups, 
thereby fulfilling the principal goal of overseeing Latin 
American regional integration, ensuring its flexibility, and 
seeking to include all of the nations in their unity proposal. 
  [Robles] Considering the priority that your government 
assigns to integration with its neighbors, could you give us 
your views in this regard? 
  [Sanchez] Bolivia attaches particular importance to regional 
and subregional integration, because it is believed that this 
policy will jointly promote the internal development of the 
member-countries and of the diverse economic coordination 
mechanisms. 
  [Robles] Mr. President, what means do you see for merging 
the 
existing subregional blocs into a vast integrated framework? 
Should this merger be based on pluralism? 
  [Sanchez] Undoubtedly, pluralism has become one of the key 
elements of Latin American integration. Since the creation of 
the Latin American Integration Association in 1980, our 
countries have considered the final goal of regional 
coordination policy to be the formation of a single continental 
bloc. This will be possible to the extent that democratic 
systems are consolidated in our countries, which supposes the 
active practice of pluralism, both internally within each 
country and in its foreign relations. 
  [Robles] What are the achievements, the biggest problems, 
and 
the tasks faced by your administration? How are you coping with 
the social problems faced by your government? 
  [Sanchez] My administration finds itself at a very 
significant point in Bolivia's history. The reforms we are 
implementing are of a structural nature. At this moment in 
time, we are focusing on the capitalization laws, the education 
reforms, and reforms dealing with the people's participation. 
Our final goal is to consolidate democracy, improve the 
Bolivian people's standard of living, and last, make tangible 
our desire to achieve the country's overall development. We are 
seeking all of this within a framework of a renewed concept of 
overall and sustained human development based on economic 
growth, social justice, participative democracy, respect of the 
environment, and international solidarity.

  [Text] Chilean Foreign Minister Enrique Silva Cimma this 
afternoon disclosed Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada's official response to the invitation conveyed to him by 
Chilean President Patricio Aylwin to attend the Chilean 
presidential inauguration. 
  Sanchez de Lozada says that it is not still advisable for a 
Bolivian president to attend an official ceremony. He added 
that his wife Ximena Iturralde de Sanchez de Lozada will 
represent him. 
  Silva Cimma read to the press Sanchez de Lozada's reply: 
  [Begin Silva Cimma recording] He says that for reasons that 
are not beyond President Aylwin's illustrious acknowledgement, a 
visit by a Bolivian president to Chile to attend an official 
ceremony is not yet advisable. He has, however, empowered his 
wife, Mrs. Ximena Iturralde de Sanchez de Lozada, to represent 
him as a proof of his consideration and personal esteem toward 
their excellencies President Aylwin and President Frei Ruiz 
Tagle. [end recording] 
  Sanchez de Lozada also conveyed thanks for the invitation 
conveyed to him by his Chilean counterpart Patricio Aylwin, and 
wished the best success to future President Eduardo Frei 
Ruiz-Tagle. 
  Silva Cimma said it is not suitable to speculate on this 
response which, according to him, does not affect bilateral 
relations. 
  [Begin Silva Cimma recording] I hope this letter will not 
lead to speculations, considering that the reply to the 
invitation was made in a very delicate way and in terms that I 
think are self- explanatory. Therefore, I am simply announcing 
the official report, and that is it. [end recording] 
  Diplomatic relations between Chile and Bolivia were 
disrupted 
after the Pacific War of the last century, when Bolivia lost its 
outlet to the Pacific Ocean.

  [Excerpt] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada arrived on

this pact. Nevertheless, we would like to become a hinge and 
actually be received by this agreement. If there is such a 
political will, it would be something good, but we will wait for 
this to become official. If it becomes official, we will

  [Text] Lima, 26 May (EFE) -- Today, the presidents of 
Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela reasserted their 
commitment to the integration process of the Andean Group (GRAN) 
or Cartagena Agreement on the occasion of its 25th anniversary. 
  The five presidents expressed their support for the Andean 
integration process in separate communiques issued here today by 
the Cartagena Agreement Board (JUNAC), the GRAN's technical and 
executive body. 
  Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada stated the 
common problems affecting Andean countries are the basic factor 
in their unity. He added: "More than ever before, the 
challenges and hopes the Andean Group represents still prevail." 
  Sanchez de Lozada stated: "With our creativity and effort, 
we still must strive to achieve a better life for our countries." 
  His Colombian colleague, Cesar Gaviria, stated on the 
occasion of GRAN's 25th anniversary, "we have to rejoice over 
the implementation of this idea that has made a great 
contribution to the unity of our countries." He added: "Today, 
trade is the great force behind economic development, 
integration, and the well-being of nations." 
  Gaviria asserted that in these two and a half decades, GRAN 
faced difficulties "because the prevailing protectionist 
practices undermined commercial and integration processes." 
  He added: "Today we hope the Andean Group will develop. We 
also hope to establish a common export tariff, although we are 
aware this does not constitute a goal in itself but a means for 
achieving a free trade zone throughout the entire continent of 
the Americas." 
  Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen stressed the 
"integrating tradition" of GRAN members and reasserted his 
country's support for "the Andean integration process." 
  Duran-Ballen stated the Andean Group faces the immediate 
challenge of establishing an Andean free trade zone and helping 
Andean countries achieve "a level of modernization and 
proficiency that will allow them to achieve a definitive and 
advantageous presence in the international market." 
  Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori stated that his country 
shares with other Andean countries "a profound integrationist 
spirit." Fujimori explained that Peru temporarily withdrew from 
GRAN's economic process from August 1992 to April 1994 because 
of the serious domestic crisis his country was experiencing. 
  He added that today, Peru has been able to achieve economic 
stability and has reassumed "with great enthusiasm, the noble 
task we assumed with our Andean brothers a quarter of a century 
ago." 
  After noting that businessmen were skeptical about the 
Andean 
Group's success when it was implemented, Rafael Caldera, the 
president of Venezuela, which joined the Andean Group 23 years 
ago, praised the fact that private business has become the most 
important integration force. 
  Caldera added: "The celebration of the anniversary of one of 
the most effective and auspicious Latin American integrationist 
movements constitutes an auspicious event not only for its 
members but for all developing countries."

  [Text] Yesterday, the Paraguayan, Bolivian, and Uruguayan 
foreign ministers relaunched Urupabol [Permanent Joint 
Commission of Uruguay, Paraguay, and Bolivia] -- 12 years after 
it disappeared -- as a way to strengthen the physical 
integration of the three countries. 
  After two days of meetings, at 1230 yesterday, Paraguayan 
Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner, Bolivian Foreign 
Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga, and Uruguayan Foreign 
Minister Sergio Abreu Bonilla signed a joint declaration at the 
Foreign Ministry in Asuncion. 
  The ministers asked that the Agreement for River 
Transportation through the Paraguay-Parana Waterway be ratified 
by all member countries as a way to strengthen physical 
integration. Argentina and Brazil have yet to ratify the 
document. Paraguay, Bolivia, and Uruguay have already ratified 
it. 
  In the joint declaration, the foreign ministers express the 
need for a more significant participation of companies from the 
three Urupabol member countries in the implementation of the 
various Paraguay-Parana Waterway projects. The ministers agree 
that NAFTA is an important step forward for the creation of a 
broadened economic space in the hemisphere. 
  Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu Bonilla stressed 
that 
the relaunching of Urupabol -- which disappeared in 1982 -- does 
not seek to upset the influence of Argentina and Brazil, the two 
powerful Mercosur [Common Market of the South] member countries. 
The idea is to complement and compare interests, Abreu said. 
  The Paraguayan and Bolivian foreign ministers said they were 
pleased with the Uruguayan offer to use Uruguayan port 
facilities to take their products to the Atlantic Ocean.

  [Excerpt] Belem, Para (Brazil), 7 Jun (EFE) -- During a 
speech to the 24th OAS General Assembly on 7 June, Bolivian 
Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga stated that the 
Bolivian Government hopes that this year it will start holding 
talks with Chile on the problem of Bolivia's land-locked 
situation. 
  Aranibar said: "We believe there are new conditions to 
tackle 
the issue of our aspirations to an outlet to the sea." He 
reported that the presidents of both countries will discuss the 
issue during the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of heads of 
government and state to be held in the Colombian city of 
Cartagena de Indias on 14-15 June. 
  The Bolivian foreign minister asserted that "in the course 
of 
the meetings that (Bolivian) President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada 
held with Chilean presidential candidates before the elections, 
including then-candidate Eduardo Frei, he sensed that Chile was 
more willing to discuss that issue." 
  Bolivia's land-locked situation was on the agenda of the 
24th 
OAS General Assembly, which was inaugurated in Belem, a city in 
Para State in the Amazon, on 6 June. This issue was discussed 
by the foreign ministers of the two countries involved. 
  This question has been included on the agenda of all OAS 
General Assemblies since 1979 at the request of Bolivia and 
despite the fact that Chile has always objected to it. The 
Bolivian claim has been endorsed in the last few years by 11 OAS 
resolutions. 
  In his address to the foreign ministers and chiefs of 
delegations of the 34 OAS member countries, the Bolivian foreign 
minister asserted that his country has the right to ask the 
international community to discuss Bolivia's possibility of 
having an outlet to the sea and to give it the same treatment as 
the cases of Palestine, South Africa, and Haiti. 
  Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa Serrano stated that 
his country's stance is based on respect for the principle of 
nonintervention and faithful compliance with the treaties on 
that matter. He said: "We would like once again to insist at 
this meeting on the legal arguments that prove that our claim is 
valid." [passage omitted]

<P>
In the South American war against cocaine traffic, Colombia is only one of many 
strategic theaters where traffickers enjoy a big advantage over anti-drug 
forces. Even if authorities could win the battle in Colombia, they could still 
lose the war. 
</P>
<P>
New U.S. aid for South America, proposed this week by President Bush, is 
unlikely by itself to improve bleak prospects for stopping cocaine at its 
origins. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews over the past several months, numerous officials near the front 
lines of the South American war have underlined a common concern: The 
continent's rugged geography, weak institutions and needy peoples give cocaine 
traffickers almost unlimited opportunities for exploitation. Despite 
enforcement crackdowns like the current one in Colombia, officials agree, South 
American cocaine traffic will probably thrive as long as there are 
multibillion-dollar markets for the illegal product in the United States and 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"I see law enforcement as buying time for demand-reduction programs in the 
United States to take hold," one Drug Enforcement Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
The Colombian blitz against traffickers by President Virgilio Barco Vargas 
began Aug. 18, the same day that assassinations of a leading presidential 
candidate and the police commander in Medellin triggered public outrage over 
violence by the Medellin drug cartel. 
</P>
<P>
How long the enforcement campaign keeps its momentum depends in part on how 
long the public outrage lasts, many Colombian analysts say. The storm might 
well blow over if the Medellin traffickers adopt the more discreet tactics of 
the rival Cali cartel, which favors bribery and useful connections over 
assassinations and terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
If President Barco's battle results in a temporary reduction of cocaine moving 
out of Colombia, that might even be profitable for Colombian traffickers. 
Assuming that a curtailed supply could not meet U.S. demand, the shortage would 
force up drug prices and profits. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole interdiction theory is based on economic fallacies," a European 
diplomat said. "If you stop a ton, what you actually do is put up the price of 
cocaine. The Medellin cartel certainly doesn't suffer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Others in the Wings 
</P>
<P>
Any traffickers caught and convicted in the Colombian crackdown would enjoy no 
windfall profits, of course. But even if some of the cartel kingpins were 
arrested, they would soon be replaced from the ranks of middle-level 
traffickers, some officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Others contend that the imprisonment of major traffickers will dissuade 
would-be drug lords from expanding. But in a continent where most people are 
poor, it is hard to calculate how many will risk their freedom for the lure of 
easy millions. 
</P>
<P>
Should the battle rage on, and should the Colombian government eventually win, 
the control centers of cocaine trafficking undoubtedly would shift to other 
South American countries. Colombia has nothing that is essential for the 
production and smuggling of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason why they couldn't do it somewhere else," the European 
diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 80% of all cocaine that reaches the United States is refined in Colombia, 
but less than 20% of the coca leaves used in the refining process are grown 
here. Increasing amounts of cocaine hydrochloride, the purest form of the drug, 
are already being produced in Peru and Bolivia, where most coca leaves are 
grown and where traffickers would be eager to fill any temporary gap in the 
flow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eyes on an Opening 
</P>
<P>
Bolivian traffickers have long been looking for the kind of opening that the 
crackdown on Colombian traffickers might provide. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bolivians are getting tired of getting the short end of the stick with the 
Colombians," a DEA agent in Bolivia said. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush's anti-drug proposal includes $260 million in additional foreign 
aid, the first installment in a $2-billion plan for fighting cocaine production 
in Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. But increased enforcement pressure in all three 
countries cannot dry up production, because Brazil and Venezuela are also 
beginning to make cocaine hydrochloride. 
</P>
<P>
Enforcement officials in Colombia often say that the only way to control the 
traffic in South America is to eradicate coca and replace it with legal crops. 
And that is what U.S. policy is aiming for. 
</P>
<P>
In both Peru and Bolivia, however, officials admit that farmers are planting 
new coca bushes faster than old plants can be pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
One problem with eradication is political. Governments seem reluctant to 
provoke the hostility of hundreds of thousands of peasant farmers by taking 
away their best means of livelihood. Leftist opposition parties in both 
countries capitalize on the eradication programs, contending that the 
authorities are siding with U.S. imperialism against popular interests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Economic Impediment 
</P>
<P>
The sensitivity of the "imperialism" issue also makes it unlikely that South 
American governments will invite substantial contingents of U.S. security 
forces to join the fight. 
</P>
<P>
But the main impediment to eradication is economic. Farmers cannot come close 
to making as much money on fruit, vegetables, coffee or other legal crops as 
they make on coca. Some government officials argue that in the long run, the 
only way substitute crops can become nearly as profitable as coca is for the 
United States and other consumer countries to guarantee their purchase at 
attractive prices. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say that coca crop substitution can be effective if farmers 
receive technical and financial aid for efficiently producing substitute crops 
while enforcement efforts effectively drive off drug buyers, making it hard for 
farmers to sell leaves or semi-refined cocaine paste at a profit. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, that kind of enforcement has not succeeded for any sustained 
period. The jungle regions where coca is grown in Peru and Bolivia are 
extensive and difficult to patrol. Peasants help keep security forces out of 
some coca-growing zones, and in Peru's coca-rich Huallaga River Valley, 
guerrillas make penetration doubly difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are no guerrillas in Bolivia's main coca-growing region, the 
Chapare, officers of the anti-narcotics police have been notorious for taking 
bribes from traffickers. The low pay of officials in general, and the fragility 
of institutional controls, make corruption a major enforcement problem anywhere 
in South America where traffickers deal in huge sums of money. 
</P>
<P>
If the cultivation of coca in Bolivia and Peru could somehow be stopped, it 
could be expanded in neighboring countries. In the past, coca has grown well in 
Ecuador. Colombia currently produces tens of thousands of acres and has the 
potential for much more. 
</P>
<P>
"If they were really to do a good job of eradication in Bolivia, my guess is 
that there would be a significant increase in coca production here," a DEA 
agent in Colombia said. 
</P>
<P>
And in the vast Amazon region of Brazil, a variety of coca called epadu is 
becoming widespread. The dense Amazon forest could hide enormous quantities of 
epadu if traffickers found it necessary to use the region as a major source of 
raw material. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil, as large as the United States without Alaska, also offers infinite 
possibilities for trafficking routes. Many are already in use. Large 
hydrochloride laboratories have been uncovered in remote places in the 
Brazilian interior, and big shipments of cocaine powder have been seized coming 
from Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Potential 
</P>
<P>
One DEA official in Brazil said the country has the potential to be a major 
producer of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that yet, but it's on the way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators say that, increasingly, cocaine routes also go through Venezuela, 
Paraguay, Ecuador and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
"When the police do manage to plug up a route for export, the bad guys quickly 
have two or three alternative routes," an American diplomat in Bogota said. 
</P>
<P>
A diplomat from another drug-consuming country draws what he calls an 
inevitable scenario starting with tough enforcement pressure in Colombia, a 
decline of trafficking through this country and a progressive displacement of 
hydrochloride production to Bolivia, Peru, Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see the inevitable historical drift of cocaine production down the cone 
of South America," the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, he emphasized, the outcome of the South American cocaine war will 
depend on U.S. and European programs for discouraging consumption.

  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 17 Mar (NA) -- President Carlos 
Menem and his Bolivian counterpart, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, 
today analyzed, among other subjects, the probable granting of 
Argentine credits for environmental sanitary projects on the 
common border area between the two countries for the purpose of 
preventing the spread of cholera, the situation of illegal 
Bolivian immigrants in Argentina, the struggle against drug 
trafficking, and the projections of Mercosur [Common Market of 
the South]. 
  Sanchez de Lozada today arrived in Argentina on an official 
48-hour visit with the objective of signing an agreement on 
plant and animal sanitary controls and an agreement on 
investment promotion and guarantees. 
  President Menem and Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella received 
the Bolivian president at 1020 today in Metropolitan Airport's 
military section. 
  After the welcoming protocol, City Council President Juan 
Trilla, from the Radical Civic Union, gave the Bolivian chief of 
state the keys to the city. 
  During a brief news conference after the ceremony, Sanchez 
de 
Lozada said one of the subjects he would discuss with Menem is 
the situation of some of his fellow countrymen living illegally 
in Argentina. 
  He added: "The control of drug trafficking is very 
important, 
and with the aid of Argentina and the international community we 
will be able to stop this problem." [passage omitted] 
  Regarding drug trafficking control, Sanchez de Lozada said: 
"It is a very important subject, and we will speak about the 
Bolivian criteria to ask Argentina and the international 
community for help to put an end to this phenomenon, which is 
something we cannot stop." 
  He added that the future of Bolivia "depends a lot on what 
is 
going on in Argentina, on the possibility of increasing 
exchange, and on a rapprochement" between the two countries.

  [Text] Bonn, 26 Apr (EFE) -- Bolivian Foreign Minister 
Antonio Aranibar Quiroga today ended his stay in Bonn, the main 
phase of his three-day visit to Germany. During his visit to 
Bonn, Aranibar encouraged German business people to invest in 
Bolivia. 
  Aranibar, who had a chance to address a large audience of 
private German business people during a meeting at the 
Confederation of German Industry and Commerce Chambers, tried to 
interest business people in a series of privatization projects 
and some significant industrial projects. 
  During a news conference this afternoon, Aranibar explained 
that he had told his audience about the capitalization project 
involving some public enterprises in the natural gas and oil, 
electric power, telecommunications, railway, smelting, and air 
transportation fields. 
  The German business people also showed great interest in the 
plan to build a gas pipeline between Santa Cruz central Bolivia 
and Sao Paulo, Brazil. This represents a "megaproject" for 
Bolivia and is necessary for Brazil's energy supply system. 
  The Germans also were interested in the plans for Ilo, the 
Peruvian town on the Pacific coast where Bolivia, after an 
agreement signed with the Peruvian Government, intends to build 
an industrial and tourism free zone and hopes to turn it into an 
important port for the shipment of its exports. 
  Aranibar, who believes the Germans are the right people for 
this project due to their experience and technology, also will 
show the plans for Ilo port to business people in Berlin, with 
whom he will meet on 27 April in the morning, and especially to 
those in Hamburg, the great hanseatic town and German port, 
where he will end his visit that same afternoon. 
  During his two-day visit to Bonn, Aranibar had a tight 
agenda 
that ended on 25 April with a meeting with his German 
counterpart, Klaus Kinkel, with whom he signed a financial 
cooperation agreement for 50 million German marks ($30 million), 
earmarked for potable water and sewage infrastructure projects, 
as well as for the preservation of natural resources. 
  Aranibar announced that the German-Bolivian Joint Commission 
will meet next July in Germany to establish the framework for 
future cooperation between the two countries, among them 
cooperation for the institutional consolidation of the recently 
created La Paz Justice Ministry. 
  According to the minister, during all the meetings held in 
Bonn with politicians, legislators, representatives of 
organizations or business people he found great interest and 
understanding for the efforts toward political and economic 
reform in Bolivia.

FT  11 SEP 93 / Despatches: The navy lark - Christina Lamb on the
aspirations of Bolivia's landlocked sailors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPTAIN Luis Aranda is the proud commander of the fleet of the fourth base
of the Bolivian navy. But the only ships at his command are those he makes
at home from matchsticks, along with a motley flotilla of five small metal
ferry and patrol boats that are gently rusting in the waters of Lake
Titicaca. Aranda's 150-strong division spends most of its time raising
chickens and cultivating prize tomatoes. The reason: Bolivia may have a
navy, but it has no sea.
Bolivia has been landlocked since losing the War of the Pacific against
Chile in 1879. From the moment one arrives in the Andean city of La Paz it
is evident that neither the rarified air nor the passage of years have
served to quell passions; indeed, the issue is a national obsession.
A plaque at the airport asserts that Bolivia is a maritime nation.
Bright-coloured stickers in taxicab windows scream 'The Sea Belongs to Us -
To Recapture it is Our Duty.' Newspaper editorials rail almost daily at
Chile's mulishness in refusing to relinquish the land that blocks Bolivia
from the Pacific coast.
El Mar Boliviano is a primary school set-textbook crammed with pictures of
crashing waves described as 'our sea.' Statues in otherwise peaceful town
centres depict demonic Bolivians bayoneting hapless Chileans above the
inscription: 'What once was ours will again be.'
'We're the only landlocked nation in the world', is a frequent complaint
from locals, blaming Bolivia's glaring poverty on its lack of coastline.
They will not listen if one points out other examples of sea-less nations
such as Switzerland, Austria, Paraguay.
Bolivia is certainly one of the world's most unfortunate or misguided
nations. Once the second largest country in Latin America, it has lost
territory to almost all its neighbours in wars. But it is the loss of the
sea that really rankles. At every international conference Bolivia raises
the issue, demanding its land back, and Chile always says No. On March 23
every year a Day of the Sea is held to mourn the loss, and 30 years ago the
navy was re-established to show that Bolivia would never yield.
A smart 10-storey building was recently constructed to house the high
command of the 8,000-strong navy and its two-ship fleet. On the top floor
sits the commander-in-chief himself, Admiral Miguel Alvarez. Surrounded by
pictures of ships on the high seas, he booms: 'The sea is in the soul,
spirit and heart of every Bolivian. Everyone.'
Admiral Alvarez believes that with the end of the cold war it is time to
solve territorial disputes such as that between Bolivia and Chile. 'We have
great hopes from the new world order and will raise this issue at every
forum until we get a satisfactory resolution reintegrating the land which,
by historic, geographic and legal right, belongs to this country.'
He thinks Britain should take a lead in this process, claiming that British
merchants in Chile, seeing the value of nitrates in Bolivia, inspired and
funded the Chilean invasion of the Bolivian port of Antofagasta. Apparently,
during Queen Victoria's reign, maps of the region were printed in Britain
omitting Bolivia altogether - clear proof of conspiracy.
In the meantime, as he waits for Britain to get its act together, the
admiral sees nothing incongruous about being commander-in-chief of a navy
which has no sea. He admits a certain envy for neighbouring maritime nations
such as Argentina, Peru and Brazil, on whose charity he relies to allow his
forces to practise. If they are lucky, Bolivian naval cadets go to sea once
a year.
Out at the fourth naval base of Tiquina on Lake Titicaca, Capt Aranda says
his men are ready to take to the high seas at any time.
While they are waiting for the great day, the Bolivian navy is giving a
useful lesson to the rest of the world in how to utilise an idle military.
Capt Aranda's men patrol the lake looking for Sendero Luminoso guerrillas in
hiding from Peru, and his colleagues in the Amazonian naval bases chase
narco-traffickers.
But most of the time the men of the fourth base are engaged in raising
chickens, growing vegetables and planting trees to replace those removed by
locals. 'Perhaps you might think it a little strange to see a navy growing
vegetables', says the captain as he shows off a splendid selection of
lettuces and tomatoes, 'but armed forces should adapt to the necessities of
the situation. It's our duty to contribute to the development as well as the
defence of the country.'
