<LEADPARA>  EVERY actor in a long-running weekly series, sooner or later, wants a change
of pace, a chance to break away from playing the same character week after
week, an opportunity to use skills that otherwise might wither away from
disuse.;   So far, this month has been loaded with TV-series stars "breaking
away" through made-for-TV movies: Roseanne Arnold of "Roseanne" taking a
breather from the Conner household by playing a single mom in "Backfield in
Motion"; Michelle Lee of "Knots Landing" stripping off her makeup to be a
distraught mother in "My Son Johnny"; Susan Ruttan of "L.A. Law" playing a
murderous nurse in "Deadly Medicine"; Betty White of "The Golden Girls"
playing a romantic lady on a last fling in "Chance of a Lifetime"; Judith
Light of "Who's the Boss?" poisoning her husband for his insurance money in
"Wife, Mother, Murderer"; and sitcom stars Steven Weber of "Wings" and Mary
Page Keller of "Baby Talk" teaming up for an anguishing drama tonight,
"Deception: A Mother's Secret."  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  DEAD AND ALIVE; Sunday night at 9 on  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     But nobody has broken away from his usual image with any greater success
than Tony Danza, the lovably goofy housekeeper of "Who's the Boss?" He'll stun
his fans this weekend as a small-time killer on the lam in ABC's "Dead and
Alive," tonight at 9 on Chs. 7 and 11.;   In this harsh, unsettling and
uncompromising crime docudrama, Danza isn't just getting in a little "r&amp;r"
from the series grind. What he's doing is slapping the Hollywood establishment
wide awake to his potential as a dramatic actor by delivering a powerful but
impressively contained performance that proves he's ready for a whole new kind
of star venue.;   Danza plays Gus Farace, a real-life Staten Island hood who
made the awesome mistake of killing a federal undercover drug agent during a
street transaction that went bad in 1989.;   The movie begins with that tense,
bloody sequence, then turns into a grim two-hour chase film that has the feel
of "Odd Man Out" with a heavy overlay of "GoodFellas," as Farace attempts to
elude not only an army of converging law enforcement officers but also teams
of hit men from his own mob family.;   Portrayal digs deep;   Rather than play
this low-life as a folk hero, Danza peels Farace down to his essence: a
vicious sociopath whose uncontrollable fear and pathological suspicion of
everyone finally turns him into a mad dog at bay.;   With Danza's dazzling
performance as its core, "Dead and Alive" becomes a brilliant docudrama that
sets out to expose the soul-dead heart of the current Mafia. The mobsters we
see aren't the feudal barons of the "Godfather" films or the psychopathic
pranksters of "GoodFellas," but a collection of icy pragmatists who realize
the only way to get the federal heat off their operations is to "whack" one of
their own before he makes a deal to save his skin.;   It was a brilliant
strategy worked out by Asst. U.S. Attorney Charles Rose, played by Ted Levine,
the serial killer from "The Silence of the Lambs." Rose led the search for
Farace. He reasoned that the only way to flush Farace out of hiding was to
hassle his mob brethren so badly that their moneymaking activities would be
disrupted enough to make them turn the fugitive in.;   That isn't exactly the
way it worked out, but the strategy did turn the mob against a "soldier" who
had become a liability, making Farace more and more desperate as the law drew
its dragnet closer to him, and one friend after another was either "offed" by
his former mob allies or, worse, sent to kill him in order to save their own
lives.;   This isn't a movie for the squeamish. In one sequence, mob goons
blow off a man's elbow to convince him they mean business. The bloody finale
is a stomach-churner.;   Danza's fans also may be bothered by what they see.
In his seven seasons on "Who's the Boss?", Danza has become a sex symbol to
millions of women, the handsome, good-natured hunk of many female dreams. In
"Dead and Alive," he's the stuff of nightmares. With his hair cut short and
his tattoos showing, Danza looks incredibly menacing. His hoodlum personality
is even more intimidating.;   Critics, take note;   In one sequence, Farace is
wearing a long blond wig as a disguise while hiding out in a girlfriend's
apartment in Yonkers. When a pal slips and calls him by his real name, Farace
goes psycho and heaves everybody out of the joint. There isn't a trace of the
old Tony Danza in that explosive scene.;   In another, the coldblooded Farace
warns a friend what will happen if he betrays him: "You'll never hear the
hammer click!";   In still another, the paranoid Farace sees the manhunt for
him come up on the "America's Most Wanted" TV series. Farace is convinced they
don't put stories on that show unless they already know where the fugitives
are hiding out. Panicked, he calls up the TV show from his hideout and tries
to bully the operator into admitting they're setting him up.;   Though Danza
has done a few dramatic roles, none has been in this league. His tightly
reined, credible performance ought to permanently stifle the critics who still
consider him nothing but an ex-prizefighter who lucked into a simple-minded
comedy role on a sitcom that became an enormous hit ("Taxi"), then parlayed
that into a career playing an amiable lout on "Who's the Boss?";   The Tony
Danza on display in "Dead and Alive" is an accomplished actor capable of
tapping his own roots in the streets of Brooklyn for the inspiration to
deliver a performance that blows you away like a blast from a Magnum and
resonates with the ring of truth.;   That's the best reason to watch this
intense docudrama, a worthy addition to the growing list of films about the
complex workings of America's criminal empires. (box)  </TEXT>

<NOTE>Snoops</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   CBS' ``Snoops'' stars Tim and Daphne Maxwell Reid, late of
``Frank's Place'' as TV husband-and-wife in this hour comedy-drama
set in Washington, D.C. He is a noted professor of criminology at
Georgetown University. She is a protocol officer with the State
Department. Together, they solve matters of international intrigue
and just plain, old crimes. ``Snoops'' goes up against NBC's
bikini-clad ``Baywatch'' on Fridays.

<NOTE>Island Son</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Miniseries regular Richard Chamberlain returns to series
television, once again as a doctor _ he played ``Dr. Kildare'' in
the 1960s _ in CBS' ``Island Son.'' Who wouldn't have been lured
back to the weekly grind with a show set in Hawaii? Chamberlain
plays Daniel Kulani, a doctor at a large Honolulu hospital, who was
adopted at birth by a native Hawaiian couple and has a Hawaiian
businessman brother. Little is known about the show, but one of the
co-executive producers, Nigel McKeand, wrote for ``The Waltons'' and
``Family.'' ``Island Son'' goes up against NBC's ``Midnight Caller''
and ABC's ``thirtysomething'' on Tuesday.

<NOTE>Rescue 911</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   CBS will try to match NBC's success with ``Unsolved Mysteries''
by launching its own ``reality-based'' series, ``Rescue 911,''
featuring graphic re-creations of actual emergency calls. It is too
graphic for its early time period on Tuesday.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Free Spirit</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The most unlikely sitcom of the new season is ABC's ``Free
Spirit,'' starring Corinne Bohrer as Winnie the Witch, housekeeper
to a stern single dad and his three young children. This one will
need a magic wand. One of the co-executive producers' credits
include ``Diff'rent Strokes'' ``Women in Prison'' and ``Facts of
Life.'' ``Free Spirit'' should be a free agent soon. It goes up
against CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote'' and NBC's ``Sister Kate'' on
Sundays.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Living Dolls</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Another ABC sitcom looks a little more promising. ``Living
Dolls,'' about four young models sharing a New York apartment, is
something of a spinoff of ``Who's the Boss?'' Tony Danza and Alyssa
Milano will make occasional guest appearances. Michael Learned
(``The Waltons'') plays a former model who serves as the girls' den
mother. ``Living Dolls'' goes in on Saturday after ``Mr. Belvedere.''
</TEXT>
<NOTE>The Young Riders</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Also a possibility is ABC's new Western ``The Young Riders,'' the
story of the young men who rode Pony Express. The cast is a passel
of newcomers, except for Josh Brolin. Creator-supervising producer
Ed Spielman also created the 1970s Eastern Western ``Kung Fu.''
``The Young Riders'' gets the Thursday time period opposite NBC's
comedies, but with its kid-appeal, it might last long enough to see
the sunset.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Mancuso, FBI</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   NBC is rounding out its all-new Friday lineup with two shows
derived from successful TV movies of last season. Robert Loggia
reprises his role as the rough-edged FBI agent Nick Mancuso that he
created in the political thriller ``Favorite Son.'' ``Mancuso, FBI''
looks like a good bet as a politically sophisticated crime drama
that could attract a cult following, a la ``Wiseguy.''
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Baywatch</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Starting out Friday is ``Baywatch,'' a silly lifeguard drama that
the alarmists among us can take as more evidence that civilization,
as well as the beach, is eroding. Watch. It'll be a hit. The rerun
of last season's movie was in the top 10 in the Nielsens. David
Hasselhoff (``Knight Rider''), Parker Stevenson (``Hardy Boys''),
and former Miss Universe Shawn Weatherly (``OceanQuest'') star as
the scantily clad protagonists. Here's irony for you: This is the
only show on the schedule from ballyhooed GTG Entertainment, the new
production company established by Grant ``Quality Television''
Tinker, former chairman of NBC.

   Comedian Bob Hope has decided after
all that he will travel to the Persian Gulf to stage Christmas
shows for U.S. troops, but he'll change his act to make it
acceptable to Arab censors.
   ``How am I going to go without the girls? I'd hate to think I
was the only pretty face there,'' Hope said Monday night at
dedication ceremonies for the downtown Long Beach-Bob Hope USO.
   For decades, Hope has been accompanied on his Christmas season
tours by a platoon of starlets and Hollywood beauty queens. In
Saudi Arabia, the 87-year-old comedian will be forced to change the
routine.
   The announcement Monday reversed Hope's earlier position on a
performance in the Middle East. Hope wouldn't say Monday why he
changed his mind, but he was sharply criticized for saying in
August he had no plans to travel to Saudi Arabia.
   ``Palm Springs is my desert,'' he had said. ``The only way I'm
going to the desert is going to Palm Springs.''
   During the dedication ceremony, Hope poked fun at military
spending and the radar-evading B-2 stealth bomber.
   ``The U.S. government paid $70 billion for something that fles
in, bombs undetected and flies out. I've been doing that for
years,'' Hope quipped.

   NEW ORLEANS (AP) - Actor John Goodman has agreed to become the
first celebrity Santa Claus in a Christmas parade down Canal
Street.
   ``We hope this will be the beginning of celebrity Santas every
year,'' said Mickey Barthelemy, wife of Mayor Sidney Barthelemy and
president of Christmas in New Orleans Inc., the non-profit group
sponsoring the Dec. 9 parade.
   The blue-collar husband on the hit sitcom ``Roseanne'' has been
in and out of New Orleans since first visiting on a fraternity
junket in 1972. He says he hopes to own a home in the city one day.
   Goodman met his wife, Annabeth, in New Orleans while he was
working on the movie ``Everybody's All-American'' in 1987. The
couple married there about a year ago.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Two singers and three pianists took turns
rendering ``All of Me,'' Gerald Marks' most famous composition,
during the composer's 90th birthday party.
   Maxene Andrews sang first, then Gogi Grant sang a version with
lyrics written especially for the party Monday night.
   Cy Coleman, Marty Napoleon and Billy Taylor each played the song
separately before all three took the bench to finish with a
six-handed version.
   When Marks took the stage, he spoke of the foibles and triumphs
of his 75-year songwriting career and sang some of his little-known
works, including ``North Dakota,'' the first song he ever wrote.
   Marks also sang a comedy song he claimed lyricist Mitchell
Parish wrote during the War of 1812, but Parish actually was born
in 1900 - only a couple of months before Marks.

   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A chance encounter in a dry cleaning shop
landed a starring role in ABC-TV's ``Who's The Boss?'' for a
5-year-old New Jersey boy.
   ``When I found out I got the role, I was so excited that I could
have exploded,'' Jonathan Halyalkar said.
   Jonathan, from the town of Ramsey, has been filming episodes in
Los Angeles since July.
   He plays Billy, a foster child of TV characters Tony Micelli and
Angela Bower, played by Tony Danza and Judith Light.
   A man married to a Teaneck talent agent discovered Jonathan 1{
years ago.
   Jonathan's mother, Carolyn, was dropping off clothes at a dry
cleaner when her son struck up a conversation with the man, who was
impressed and told his wife.
   Jonathan's character was written into the show after Alyssa
Milano - who has played Danza's TV daughter since the show went on
the air in 1984 - announced she was leaving at the end of the
season.
   ``Working with Tony Danza is a piece of cake,'' Jonathan said.

   Tony Danza is Gus Farace, the minor New York hoodlum whose
murder of an undercover narcotics agent made him the target
of a major manhunt. Both the police and the underworld wanted
Farace, the cops because of what he had done to one of their
own, the mob because the lawman's murder had brought intense
pressure down on Farace's Mafia colleagues. An interestingly
layered two hours, the film has a certain urbanity and style.
It's also a relief to see Tony Danza as something other than
the golden-hearted nitwit of the sitcoms, though every now
and then the creepy softness of his sitcom personality pops
up here, too. We get to see more of Mr. Danza's estimable
torso than is absolutely necessary, but he makes a quite
convincing Farace.
   -- 9-11 p.m. EST, on ABC.
                                                                                                       

                   Deception: A Mother's Secret
                                                                                                       

   The weight of sentimentality hangs heavy on the first part
of this film about a devoted father who tries to adopt his
dead wife's son. That, however, doesn't prevent the story
from growing on a viewer, as the husband discovers the truth
about the boy. Thanks to Steven Weber's skillful portrayal of
the father, and Robert Gorman's wrenching performance as the
boy, the film is, by the end, a tale that should wring tears
from all but the stone-hearted.
   -- 9-11 p.m. EST, on NBC.

   What's left to say about rape this TV season? The answer
is plenty, and there's always room for more, given the
network's evidently bottomless attraction to this theme. In
this fact-based movie, a mother hunts for her daughter's
rapist, a saga that may well have been more interesting in
life than it turns out here. Meredith Baxter, who never
looked grimmer, portrays the revenge-seeking mother, whose
obsession is fueled by her own memories of an unhappy first
marriage in which her husband made her feel degraded. Two
tales of male oppression are, needless to say, better than
one. The rape victim's boyfriend, an unemancipated lout, is
also on hand, enlarging the circle of oppressors to three,
but who's counting? The mother's hunt for the rapist ends
unsurprisingly. That there emerges, from all this flapdoodle,
any effective drama at all (as there does in the
mother-daughter scenes) is the real surprise.
   ---9-11 EST, on NBC.

                   Breaking the Silence
                                                                                                       

   This is "L.A. Law" with psychosexual trimmings -- an epic
about a star attorney with a frightful past that features
sleaze, psychosis, incest, child molestation and sundry
similar prime-time attractions. Gregory Harrison is
effectively -- if unintentionally -- unappetizing as the
lawyer who must navigate his way through this dark world and
wide, under the weight of his aberrations. For someone with
two hours to annihilate, this could be just the thing.
   -- 9-11 EST, on CBS.
                                                                                                       

                      Sunday, Dec. 1
                     She's Been Away
                                                                                                       

   By far the best Masterpiece Theatre offering of the
season, this is also Dame Peggy Ashcroft's last and mostly
brilliant performance. A drama of an aged woman coming out
into the sun -- and also into the modern hell of noise and
ugliness -- after 60 years in a mental institution, it is a
work of surpassing power and, at least up to the end, of
subtlety. Too bad its creators saw fit to turn so delicate
and cutting a film into a kind of female buddy movie at the
finale, with Dame Peggy's character, Lil lian, tearing off
with her nephew's embittered wife on a British version of
Thelma and Louise's spree. This piece of agitprop is
particularly gross, coming as it does on top of a nuanced and
wonderfully tense hour and three quarters, in which Lillian
is reintroduced to the world by a dutiful nephew. Dame
Peggy's character is an unyieldingly hard and tough portrait,
notwithstanding numerous muddling efforts in the script to
portray insan ity as a form of romantic rebellion. James Fox
is splendid as the decent nephew, all briskness and certitude
under the thickest of skins. Geraldine James is better still
as his complicated and brooding wife.

The fall season doesn't just mean flashy new programs and splashy specials all 
vying for viewers' attention. The networks have countless changes up their 
sleeves for returning series, in order to bring back old viewers and, perhaps, 
capture some new ones. 
</P>
<P>
Here are changes for some of the networks' returning series: 
</P>
<P>
ABC 
</P>
<P>
"America's Funniest Home Videos" -- The surprise hit of 1990 will offer three 
grand prizes of $100,000 each for the best video entries. 
</P>
<P>
"China Beach" -- The Emmy Award-winning Vietnam War drama moves to a new time 
in its fourth season, to Saturdays at 9 p.m. Also, the series will shift back 
and forth in time, with the opener taking place in 1985. A major character will 
lose a leg. Marg Helgenberger, who plays the cynical prostitute K.C., is 
pregnant in real life and her pregnancy will be written into the show. 
</P>
<P>
"Doogie Howser, M.D." -- Markus Redmond joins the cast as Raymond Alexander, 
a.k.a. "Z-Man." A teen-age gang member, Raymond, held Doogie (Neil Patrick 
Harris) hostage in a convenience store last year. Doogie will get him a job as 
a hospital orderly. 
</P>
<P>
"Family Matters" -- Steve Urkel (Jaleel White) accidently burns down his former 
job site, Leroy's. Out of the ashes, though, comes Rachel's Place, which will 
become an important hangout and a new focal point for the series' regulars. 
Rachel (Telma Hopkins) will become an excellent businesswoman. 
</P>
<P>
"Full House" -- Jessie (John Stamos) and Rebecca (Lori Laughlin) will announce 
their engagement on the fourth season opener. Danny (Bob Saget) will yearn for 
a permanent relationship after being a widower for three years. He will meet 
the perfect woman who has a 10-year-old son, also known as "the child from 
hell." 
</P>
<P>
"Growing Pains" -- Ashley Johnson, the current Little Miss America, joins the 
Seaver household in the sixth season of the comedy as Chrissy Seaver, the 
youngest member of the family. The series moves to 8:30 p.m. Wednesdays. 
</P>
<P>
"Head of the Class" -- In the comedy's fifth season, Scottish comedian Billy 
Connolly joins the cast as an Oxford-educated history teacher from Scotland who 
replaces Charlie Moore (the departed Howard Hesseman). The sitcom moves to 
Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Life Goes On" -- Patti LuPone is pregnant in real life and will be pregnant on 
the dramatic series. 
</P>

<TEXT>  (box) WIFE, MOTHER, MURDERER; Sunday night at 9, Chs. 7, 11; (box) THE RETURN
OF ELIOT NESS; Sunday night at 9, Chs. 4, 8;   WITH the World Series out of
the way and no cataclysmic international events scheduled, the networks are
bringing out their conventional weapons this weekend for the kind of outright
warfare we've all come to expect on a Sunday night during the November ratings
sweeps.;   ABC, CBS and NBC all will unleash first-run made-for-TV movies
against each other Sunday night at 9, each starring a popular TV name with a
high recognition rating and each based, sort of, on true stories.;   The best
of the lot is CBS's "My Son Johnny," which features a devastating performance
by Michele Lee of CBS's "Knots Landing" as the mother of a modern Cain and
Abel. The show also has dynamite turns by Rick Schroder and Corin Nemec as the
sons who hate each other.;   If you have a tough time picking a favorite, let
me help out: This is one of the best movies of the TV season. You won't get
acting any better all year long.;   Far less interesting, because it's about a
person you won't be able to stand, is ABC's "Wife, Mother, Murderer," the true
story of Marie Hilley, who blithely poisoned her husband and her daughter,
eluded police for years, faked her death, then posed as her twin sister so
convincingly that she duped her own husband.;   Though you'll be fascinated by
the offbeat performance of Judith Light of "Who's the Boss?" as murderous
Marie, you may need to bathe a few times after seeing this film.;   Finally,
there's Robert Stack of NBC's hit "Unsolved Mysteries" series, reprising the
role that made him a TV star several decades ago, in "The Return of Eliot
Ness," which tells how the aging Ness came out of retirement in 1947 to avenge
the murder of a former colleague by the gangsters who took over Al Capone's
Chicago crime empire.;   This movie isn't as bad as it sounds, but it
stretches credibility the way Charles Durning stretches his belt loops. (Since
Durning is in the movie, you can see for yourself.) If you still have a soft
spot in your heart for Stack's old "The Untouchables" series, this may be hard
to resist.;   For me, though, the irresistible one is "My Son Johnny," the
heartbreaking story of a tough, almost psychotic older brother (Schroder) who
has constantly beaten up on his younger brother (Nemec) since childhood, with
the tacit approval of his old-fashioned mom (Lee), who believes it's natural
for brothers to scrap, and it makes men out of them.;   Ultimately, though,
the mother is forced to face her own guilt when one of her sons winds up dead
and the other on trial for murder.;   Lee plays her role sans makeup and with
an ethnic dialect. It's an incredible turn for her after so many years in
"Knots Landing" and so few opportunities to show her other dimensions as an
actress.;   She's backed up by two of TV's best young actors. Schroder, the
former child star of movies such as "The Champ" and TV's "Silver Spoons"
sitcom, is now a mature 21 and has developed into a superb dramatic actor.
This vengeful, violent, sadistic role will stun his fans.;   It also may bowl
over fans of Corin Nemec, who know him only from his Fox sitcom, "Parker Lewis
Can't Lose," to see him vanish completely into the persona of the tormented,
moody Anthony. It's his best work since he starred in the miniseries "I Know
My First Name is Steven.";   Fine acting also is the main attraction of "Wife,
Mother, Murderer," in which the generally sunshiny and attractive Judith Light
plays a tawdry and amoral woman we finally believe is capable of any evil.;  
After watching Light with David Ogden Stiers in a gross bathtub scene, her
fans may stop longing for her to finally get it on with Tony Danza in "Who's
the Boss?" Frankly, I found her performance a hoot and quite clearly the only
reason to watch this otherwise sick-spirited film.;   Finally, there's "The
Return of Eliot Ness," which isn't likely to satisfy the craving so many of us
had for a sequel to Brian DePalma's big-screen version of "The Untouchables."
Robert Stack isn't Kevin Costner, nor is the stunt man who doubles for him in
so many scenes.;   In this fanciful tale, Ness teams up with the son (Jack
Coleman) of his murdered pal to track down the killers. He needs to because
the son is a cop, and Ness is a retiree. At first, the son is reluctant
because he has swallowed the mob-planted story that his dad was on the take.; 
 "He wasn't on the take, son," growls Ness. "He was untouchable!";   Actually,
it's kind of fun to see the 1947 hoods' reaction to Ness when he introduces
himself around town. Naturally, most of them thought he was either dead or
hosting a reality crime show somewhere. They're not used to meeting legendary
lawmen in the flesh.;   Ness also shoots up a good deal of Chicago, badge or
no badge. This time the bad guys use bazookas as well as tommy guns, but
they're still no match for the deadeye dick with the deadpan stare. When he
survives a well-orchestrated hit in a hotel lobby, he seems too lucky to be
true.;   But when he tells gang moll Lisa Hartman that "easy eyes and easy
women don't work on me," you know he's still as trustworthy as he was before
they sent him to that nursing home or wherever the heck he's been for the past
30 years.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  FOR those who get so bored with network television that they stop watching the
new season by December, there may seem to be even more new shows than
advertised this fall.;   That's because each of the networks has given fall
berths to a number of "early starters," shows introduced in the last few
months of the past TV season that did well enough to earn commitments for a
full season.  </LEADPARA>

starring Mayim Bialik as a teen TV star trying to grow up normal.;   "Northern
Exposure" (CBS), a whimsical drama about a young urban doctor who's now
practicing medicine in a remote Alaskan community. It actually began in the
summer of 1990 but turned hot when it got a second tryout last spring.;  
"Dinosaurs" (ABC), a sitcom starring "animatronic" puppets, which takes place
in prehistoric times, when dinosaurs lived in housing tracts.;   "American
Detective" (ABC), a "reality" show in which the cases of real-life police
detectives are recounted with mostly real sequences videotaped as they
happened.;   "Expose" (NBC), a tabloid-style news show that goes after major
stories.;   "Baby Talk" (ABC), a sitcom about a baby who "thinks" in the voice
of Tony Danza. Originally on the 1990 fall schedule, it was delayed until
mid-season due to a last-minute cast change.;   "Sisters" (NBC), a one-hour

<LEADPARA>  TONY Danza has closed a long-term, multifaceted deal with Columbia Pictures
that will be announced next week.;   His Katie Face Productions, Danza says,
will develop and produce movies (one in the works is autobiographical), TV
programs, a children's television show -- and a reality series that's
particularly close to his heart. He says of the latter: "It's a show that will
offer assistance to inner-city kids and chronicle their progress."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Danza, who's just starting what he says will be his final season of "Who's
the Boss?" says that ABC has already expressed interest in the reality show he
terms, "The only thing that really excites me right now.";   FROM THE INSIDE
LOOKING OUT: While Goldie Hawn is busy making "House Sitter" with Steve
Martin, her production partner Anthea Sylbert is busy putting together the
next project for their company. It's called "Mrs. Faust," it's to be made for
Disney, and it will have Hawn playing a woman who almost sells her soul to the
devil. Hawn wraps "House Sitter" in November, and might squeeze in a
big-screen acting assignment before "Faust," says Sylbert. She also says their
long-planned "Babe West" project is not making any progress, that studios
"can't seem to deal with Vietnam." "Babe West" would have Goldie playing an
entertainer who goes to Vietnam to perform for the troops, "rather an amoral
story -- but a great one," says Sylbert. "Someday we'll get it made. I vow!"; 
 INDUSTRY EYE: Director Arthur Hiller plans to take a much needed break when
he finishes post-production on John Goodman's "The Babe." Because of Goodman's
series commitment to "Roseanne," says Hiller, "we had only limited time with
him, so I've been working around the clock." Hiller segued directly to "Babe"
shooting from the feature film "Married To It," which debuts Sept. 27. After
"Married To It," he wanted a break, but says that when he read the script for
"The Babe," "I just couldn't say no.";   PERSON TO PERSON: Gena Rowlands is
keeping busy. Just a few months after she completed the CBS TV movie "Face of
a Stranger" with Tyne Daly in Seattle, she's returned to that region to
co-star with Holly Hunter in TNT's three-generation family drama "Crazy in
Love." When "Crazy" is completed next month, she'll return to the business of
distributing the five features of her late husband, John Cassavetes, that she
owns ("Shadows," "Faces," "Woman Under the Influence," "Killing of a Chinese
Bookie" and "Opening Night"). Rowlands reports that undertaking is "going very
well" and now involves frequent trips to Europe.  </TEXT>

<HEADLINE>  'WHO'S THE BOSS' STAR TRIES NOT-SO-LIGHT ROLE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>  AFTER more than seven years of the hit comedy series "Who's the Boss?,"
viewers have come to know actress Judith Light. Now it's time to see if
they're ready for Judith Dark.;   They'll find out Sunday night, when Light
takes her most daring leap yet off the ledge of sitcom security to play an
evil, soulless real-life murderer -- a woman so radically different from the
cheerful, sophisticated and caring Angela Bower of "Who's the Boss?" that
thousands of startled viewers may call the network to find out if that was
really Light.;   The vehicle is a TV docudrama called "Wife, Mother,
Murderer," in which Light plays Marie Hilley, a diabolical Alabama woman who
poisoned her husband and daughter for insurance money and led a bizarre double
life while hiding out from suspicious authorities.;   "Lots of people want to
know why I would play a character like that, why we'd want to show that to
people," Light said in her dressing room after rehearsing with the cast of her
ABC sitcom. "But until we see it, we can't stop it.";   Light says the show is
of value because it allows viewers to see how far a charming sociopath can go
and how much damage she can do by just taking advantage of people's goodwill
and willingness to trust an attractive woman.;   More personally, though,
Light found herself fascinated by the complexity of Hilley's character and was
hungry for a really challenging part.;   "I'd never played anyone like that --
which is why it was so difficult," Light said. "I think she was a consummate
actress. I don't have to be comfortable playing someone who's not likable, but
I found out Marie was very likable in many ways. She was charming and had
slept with a lot of people in town, so she wasn't unattractive. But she used
people for her own means.";   Light studied mounds of court transcripts, read
scores of newspaper accounts and talked with two people who knew Hilley well:
her daughter, Carol, who survived her mother's attempt to kill her, and Lt.
Gary Carroll, the police officer who handled her case.;   "Carol's a pretty
incredible gal," said Light. "She doesn't like to talk about it much, but you
get the gist of things.";   A life of pretense;   As for Carroll, Light found
his stories about Hilley very useful in penetrating the woman's psyche.;  
"When he arrived at her house to question her for the first time, he found it
impeccably clean," Light said. "She had baked cookies for him and had the
Bible open on the table. This was a sociopath in every sense of the word.";  
Playacting was fundamental to Hilley's personality. In her most outlandish
escapade, she faked her own death, then pretended to be her own twin sister.
She even fooled her second husband. That gave Light yet another chance at
displaying her virtuosity, creating subtle differences between the real Marie
and her make-believe sister.;   Light got so far into the character that she
says it took her at least a month to get Hilley out of her system after
filming stopped. As souvenirs, she keeps pillows in her dressing room that
have slipcovers made from her Marie Hilley costumes, a gift from the costume
people on the picture.;   Though the script doesn't try to explain why Hilley
was the way she was, Light researched her so thoroughly that she thinks she
may have the answer.;   "I believe she grew up without discipline," she said.
"There was no one to stop her; so she pushed and pushed against society until
society became a parent and punished her by putting her in jail. Even then,
she manipulated the warden and got out on a furlough. It wasn't until her
death that she actually was stopped.";   Though she's well aware some fans may
prefer seeing her in safe romantic-comedy roles, Light is confident her large
following is willing to go along with her on her occasional adventures in Risk
City, even one as revolting as this.;   "My audience is very faithful to me,"
she said. "They know I'm an actress. They don't write letters to me that
start, 'Dear Angela.' They welcome my doing something different, so I don't
think this role will be problematic for them.";   Still, it may be hard for
viewers to see Light as quite the same loving mom on "Who's the Boss?" after
watching her feed arsenic to her only daughter on "Wife, Mother, Murderer."
And it may be tough to keep going along with her romantic but wholesomely
proper relationship with live-in housekeeper Tony Micelli (Tony Danza) on the
sitcom after seeing her bathtub scene with her overweight lover in Sunday's
movie.;   Doesn't want to be typecast;   Yet Light feels it's a chance she
must take since she wants to keep surprising people, especially the people who
decide which actors can handle which roles. Now in her eighth season with
"Who's the Boss?," she's grateful for all it has done for her career, but
doesn't want it to be all she does from here on.;   "I think I know why people
typecast you," she said. "By pigeon-holing you, they understand you better. I
have a lot of empathy for that, even if I don't like it.";   Light first ran
into typecasting when she left the daytime drama "One Life to Live," where she
won two Emmys as Karen Wolek, and came to California to seek the wider
prime-time audience.;   "They said, 'We know she can be dramatic, but can she
be funny?"' she recalled. "Then I was funny, and they said, 'But can she be
dramatic?' ";   That was a harrowing period for Light, who quickly landed a
guest role on "St. Elsewhere" and then didn't work again for eight months.;  
"I kept asking everybody, angrily, what I was doing wrong," she said. "The
truth is: I was afraid I wasn't going to make it, and I was covering up my
fear with anger.";   Her next part turned out to be the Angela role in "Who's
the Boss?," an immediate hit. It gave Light her first real chance to be both
funny and stylishly sexy for a nationwide audience. It also began eight years
of public pressure for Angela and Tony to "get together" in all senses of the
word. It finally happens this season, as they head for the altar.;   Light
broke into prime-time dramatic roles when her agent convinced ABC she could be
credible as the heartbroken but determined mother of youthful AIDS-victim Ryan
White in a 1989 TV movie. It has been easier for her to land offbeat roles
like Marie Hilley ever since.;   That may be important in the future, when
"Who's the Boss?" reaches the end of the line. Moved to a new night this fall
-- Saturdays at 8 -- the series has slipped in the ratings. Many feel it will
end this season with Angela and Tony finally settling into marriage.;   "It's
not over till the fat lady sings," Light responds. "I think this series will
have life in it even after Angela and Tony are 'doing it.' There's enough
juice left in the characters for people to want to see them after they're
married. Anyway, I'm not like those actors who say they can't wait to get out
of their series. That's like ignoring the breast that's feeding you. I like
doing other things, but I'm very grateful for what's on my plate."  </TEXT>

series that is the latest of the producer's breakthrough efforts, which have 
included "Hill Street Blues" and "L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, ABC finally found a companion show for its hit series "America's 
Funniest Home Videos." It is "America's Funniest . . . Part II," described as a 
"cross-country comedy tour" that seeks out people telling jokes, doing 
impersonations and demonstrating "their unique talents." Both shows are from 
producer Vin Di Bona, and they each finished among the top three programs in 
last week's national TV ratings. 
</P>
<P>
In scheduling six new series -- four comedies and two dramas -- that make up 
four hours of new programming, ABC also canceled several other series that 
attempted the unusual. "Brewster Place," which stars Oprah Winfrey in a 
half-hour drama about an inner-city black community in the 1960s, did not make 
the fall lineup. Nor did "Anything But Love," a witty romantic comedy starring 
Jamie Lee Curtis and Richard Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
ABC previously yanked "Elvis," a critically praised ratings failure about the 
early days of Elvis Presley's career. Another praised series, "The Marshall 
Chronicles," a Woody Allen-ish comedy about a teen-age boy's adventures in New 
York City, did not make the fall lineup either. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the steadily sinking ratings of "Twin Peaks," which attracted only 17% 
of the national audience last week, ABC was virtually certain to bring back the 
show because of the phenomenal praise from critics and word-of-mouth generated 
by the show. 
</P>
<P>
"China Beach," which stars Emmy-winner Dana Delaney, reportedly was a closer 
call, but ABC has been under pressure to renew the series by the grass-roots 
organization Viewers for Quality Television, among other admirers. 
</P>
<P>
ABC clearly is trying to make an event of the weekly outings of "China Beach" 
and "Twin Peaks" by pairing the two shows back-to-back from 9 to 11 p.m. 
Saturdays. However, they also will run up against NBC's all-powerful Saturday 
comedy lineup that includes "The Golden Girls," "Empty Nest" and the new Carol 
Burnett series, "Carol &amp; Company." 
</P>
<P>
Beside "Cop Rock" and "America's Funniest . . . Part II," ABC's new fall series 
are: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Baby Talk," a comedy based on the hit movie "Look Who's Talking"' and 
starring Connie Sellecca as a single mother trying to raise her child and find 
him a perfect father. The baby's thoughts will be expressed by Tony Danza, star 
of "Who's the Boss?," which will precede "Baby Talk" on Tuesdays. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Married People," a sitcom about three generations of couples who share a 
New York brownstone. The cast includes Bess Armstrong, Jay Thomas, Ray Aranha 
and Barbara Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Going Places," a comedy about four young people who move to Los Angeles to 
work on a "candid video" series. Astonishingly, "Going Places" gives producers 
Tom Miller and Bob Boyett four half-hour sitcoms that will run back-to-back on 
ABC's Friday schedule. The others are "Full House," "Family Matters" and 
"Perfect Strangers." The cast of "Going Places" includes Heather Locklear and 
Jerry Levine. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Gabriel's Fire," an hour drama starring James Earl Jones as an ex-convict 
who becomes an investigator for a defense attorney (Lalla Robins) who gets him 
released from jail. 
</P>
<P>
ABC also renewed another prestigious series with less-than-spectacular ratings, 
"Life Goes On," which deals with a family that has a son (Chris Burke) with 
Down's syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
But the network's casualties included the "ABC Saturday Mystery Movie," a 
rotating series that included Peter Falk in a revival of "Columbo," Burt 
Reynolds in "B.L. Stryker," Telly Savalas in a new version of "Kojak" and 
Jaclyn Smith in "Christine Cromwell." Reports were that "Columbo," the most 
successful of the shows, might return as a series of specials. 
</P>
<P>
Also dropped from the fall schedule were "Equal Justice," an admired series 
about a group of young prosectors, and "Head of the Class," a successful sitcom 
-- but ABC said both shows will continue in production as backup entries. 
</P>
<P>
Other ABC series failing to return from this season are "Capital News," "Free 
Spirit," "Living Dolls," "Mr. Belvedere," "Mission: Impossible," "H.E.L.P.," 
"Homeroom," "Just the Ten of Us" and "Sunset Beat." 
</P>
<P>
Along with "Twin Peaks," "Cop Rock" clearly marks an attempt by ABC to present 
a new kind of television. The music for the pilot was written by Randy Newman, 
and the network describes the series as "part opera, part rock concert and part 
intense drama." It will be broadcast from 10 to 11 p.m. Wednesdays, and the 
cast includes Ronny Cox, Barbara Bosson, Larry Joshua and Annie Marie Bobby. 
</P>
<P>
In "Cop Rock," Los Angeles police deal with "the constant trial of street 
crime," says ABC. A description from Bochco's office Monday said that the show 
"uses musical scenes as it follows the activities of the Los Angeles Police 
Department and its interactions with the city's political and criminal justice 
systems." 
</P>
<P>
With "Twin Peaks," ABC has attracted the young audience desired by sponsors and 
is presenting the unique vision of one of the world's hottest directors, David 
Lynch. Known for such films as "Blue Velvet," "Elephant Man" and "Eraserhead," 
his latest motion picture, "Wild at Heart," on Monday won the Golden Palm award 
at the Cannes film festival. 
</P>
<P>
The mixture of humor and horror in "Twin Peaks," which has revolved around the 
murder of a young woman in a small town in the Northwest, has been hailed as a 
TV work that looks like no other. Seen in the past on Thursdays, the season 
finale will be broadcast Wednesday at 10 p.m., and ABC obviously hopes the 
renewal of the series -- and interest in whether the murder will be solved -- 
will attract a large audience and build the audience in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
An ABC spokesman said that "Twin Peaks" has become "almost symbolic" of what 
the network's entertainment president, Bob Iger, "wants to bring to the 
company. It represents a whole new look for a particular program." 
</P>
<P>
Here is the night-by-night schedule: 
</P>
<P>
Sunday: "Life Goes On," "America's Funniest Home Videos," "America's Funniest . 
. . Part II," "ABC Sunday Night Movie." 
</P>
<P>
Monday: "Monday Night Football," "MacGyver." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday: "Who's the Boss?," "Baby Talk," "Roseanne," "Coach," 
"thirtysomething." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday: "The Wonder Years," "Growing Pains," "Doogie Howser, M.D.," "Married 
People," "Cop Rock." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday: "Father Dowling Mysteries," "Gabriel's Fire," "PrimeTime Live." 
</P>
<P>
Friday: "Full House," "Family Matters," "Perfect Strangers," "Going Places," 
20/20." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday: "Young Riders," "China Beach," "Twin Peaks."

   "The Famous Teddy Z," a sitcom premiering tonight, is expected to be one of the hottest new shows on CBS this season. 
The pilot is funny and well-written, but there's another reason "Teddy Z" got on the air: CBS wanted Hugh Wilson, and Columbia Pictures had him. 

   Two seasons ago, CBS canceled Mr. Wilson's critical hit "Frank's Place" because of anemic viewership. 
But the CBS Inc. unit didn't want to lose the talent of Mr. Wilson, a writer and producer who had created such hits as "WKRP in Cincinnati," so it gave him a "commitment," or a promise to air another of his efforts in the future. 
In the meantime, Columbia Pictures Television wooed Mr. Wilson away from another studio with an exclusive multimillion-dollar contract. 
That meant CBS had to make a deal with Columbia to get a show for the fall that would be produced and written by Mr. Wilson. 

   In the next several weeks, 25 new shows will premiere on the three major networks and News Corp.'s Fox network. 
Many came to fruition because producers were able to fit a complicated mix of trendy concepts (comedy is hot this year), network-writer relationships and favors into the holes each network needed to plug. 

   Columbia Pictures Television is this season's big-league studio with the most new series, a total of five. 
To bring in those winners, it vied with a half-dozen major studios and a few strong independent producers to anticipate the networks' needs. 
A look at the genesis of Columbia's five winners provides a peek at the process by which programs get on the air and how a studio can rise to the top in television. 

   In recent years, the television unit of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. has followed a strategy of emphasizing comedy over drama and pursuing veteran hit-making writer/producers, like Hugh Wilson, with juicy contracts. 
Just as importantly, Columbia never loses sight of the fact that the big money in TV production comes from selling reruns for syndication. 
As a result, it avoids presenting a series concept to a network that is topical or gimmicky and thus might have too short a shelf-life, regardless of whether critics would applaud its freshness. 

   Columbia's winners this season demonstrate how it was able to mobilize its stable of writers, producers and actors to serve the networks' very specific needs. 
Take "Living Dolls," an ABC series about four teen-age girls modeling in New York, the kind of low-concept show critics get sniffy about. 

   ABC had decided that first-place NBC was winning Saturday nights "by default," getting no competition for its successful comedies, says Ted Harbert, executive vice president, prime time, for the ABC Entertainment unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. Specifically, ABC wanted comedies that would appeal to the kind of people who stay home Saturdays, and hoped for that rarity, a show that appeals to both young viewers and mature ones. 

   Columbia had attracted such a "bi-modal audience" with the long-running "Facts of Life." 
Knowing that ABC liked the idea of young models, the studio turned to Ross Brown, a writer under contract who had worked on "Facts of Life" as well as ABC's popular "Who's the Boss?" 
Mr. Brown was made head writer and executive producer on "Living Dolls" and told to make the show a "planted spinoff" of "Who's the Boss?" 

   Spinoffs are created when a sidekick from a hot show becomes a central character for a new show, as "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" begat "Rhoda." 
In this case, ABC and Columbia decided to run a special episode of "Boss," now in its sixth season, in which the daughter of character Tony Micelli (Tony Danza) befriends another girl who is about to become a model. 
That hastily planted character will turn up four nights later on "Living Dolls," and ABC can always have Tony and daughter visit her in future episodes. 
This may seem uncreative, but ABC's statistics-keepers know that fewer viewers than ever bother to try new shows and such a ploy may help. 

   "Free Spirit," a show about a pretty witch who plays housekeeper to a divorced attorney and his kids, is another frothy comedy. 
ABC liked the idea but rejected the first script, written by a playwright under contract to Columbia. 

   Columbia ordered a quick rewrite from a writer with another studio, and once the pilot was accepted, assembled a staff of writers from within Columbia's ranks. 
One key was the right actress to play Winnie, the witch, and Columbia went for Corinne Bohrer, whom ABC happened to have in a "holding deal." 

   "There is no guarantee a network will put on a show just because you use an actor they're holding," says Scott Siegler, president of Columbia Pictures Television. 
"But they liked the pilot, and I think Corinne is the perfect cross between Elizabeth Montgomery {of "Bewitched"} and Goldie Hawn." 

   "Peaceable Kingdom," about a gutsy woman zookeeper who lives right on the zoo grounds with her kids and pet seal, is another one of those warm-hearted family shows that make critics cringe. 
But, says Kim LeMasters, head CBS programmer: "We needed a lot of new programs at 8, and we thought this show could really help us out. 
We liked the concept when it was developed, but we were afraid it could be a little soft. 
We told Columbia it needed marquee value, somebody like Lindsay Wagner with whom they had a holding deal, and that's exactly who they got." 

   Finally, Columbia is on the air with "Hardball," a joint production with NBC, which wanted the kind of male, action/adventure show that would attract young men on Friday nights the way "Miami Vice" once did. 
A script was written by an NBC Productions staffer, but NBC wasn't satisfied and thought of Frank Lupo, whose many successes included one that helped change NBC's fortunes, "The A-Team," and who had moved to Columbia. 

   "Hardball" is a buddy show about undercover cops that teams a cocky, longhaired younger man with a bull-headed, paunchy older guy. 
Columbia had long been trying to corner actor John Ashton after such films as "Beverly Hills Cop," and he got the part of the older cop. 
NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., was keen on hiring a strong-jawed young actor named Richard Tyson, who is already being promoted as the season's new sex symbol. 

   Getting all these shows on the air, though, doesn't mean money in the bank for Columbia. 
The amount networks pay toward production costs has stayed flat in recent years while the costs have escalated, so a studio can be out millions of dollars with no payback if a show doesn't last long enough to be syndicated -- and only about 9% survive that long. 

   Gary Lieberthal, chairman and chief executive of Columbia Pictures Television, says that a popular sitcom starting now could pile up $25 million in deficits over four years, which is how long Columbia waits before it tries to sell a series to TV stations. 
However, he says, the syndication revenue for that show could exceed $100 million over four more years, the kind of bonanza that keeps studios going. 
He also claims that Columbia is so good at nursing shows along, keeping plot lines and characters fresh, that it manages to keep more than 30% of its shows on long enough to syndicate. 

   In fact, says Mr. Lieberthal, one of the main reasons Columbia wanted to do "Living Dolls" is that it's "the kind of show local stations would want to run at 5 p.m. in reruns. 
If we're right and it lasts, it's very good business."

<LEADPARA>  PERSONALLY, if it were up to me, I wouldn't even bring up the incident because
it's just sounds like name-dropping.;    But you know how it is. You're
standing there and all of a sudden you notice someone staring at you.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL, CELEBRITIES ARE JUST
LIKE US  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cowherd is a columnist for the Baltimore Evening Sun.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Then pretty soon another person is staring, and another and another and
another, until there's maybe . . . let's see, one, two, three -- 500 or so
people gawking at you.;    Finally someone from the crowd approaches
hesitantly and asks: "Excuse me, but isn't that the guy from "Gilligan's
Island" behind you?";    So that's pretty much how it went privacy-wise when I
found myself on a harbor cruise not long ago with three members of the old
"Gilligan's Island" TV sitcom: Bob Denver (who played Gilligan), Dawn Wells
(Mary Ann) and Russell Johnson (the Professor.);    The cruise was a
promotional stunt by a local radio station, allowing the local riff-raff to
rub elbows with celebrities, which I have done many times in the past (we'll
get to that in a minute).;    Now, I know what you're thinking. You're
thinking: Wow, Gilligan and Mary Ann and the Professor! How'd they get three
show biz heavyweights like that together?;    Beats me. Paid them lots of
money, I guess. Anyway, Gilligan and Mary Ann looked great and the Professor
looked, well, sort of great but also sort of -- older. Then again, don't we
all.;    Bob Denver, by the way, was as nice as can be. We really hit it off.
At one point in the cruise he turned to me -- I'll never forget this, we were
standing starboard, or maybe it was aft -- and he said: "Waiter, can I get a
Diet Coke?";    And I said -- well, never mind what I said. If the supermarket
tabloids get a hold of that conversation, they'd have a field day. Suffice it
to say that the next time he turned around, Bob Denver had an ice-cold Diet
Pepsi in front of him, which he graciously accepted when informed there was no
Diet Coke.;    It reminded me of a conversation I once had with Mick Jagger
(here come the good stories) in a hotel in New York some years ago.;    The
occasion was a luncheon for a professional soccer team that I covered for a
local newspaper and that Jagger, an ardent soccer fan, followed with
interest.;    Anyway, midway through the luncheon, I went out into the hallway
to make a phone call. And who should I see lurching toward me but Mr. Rolling
Stones himself!;    Well. You talk about your Kodak Moments. I had to pinch
myself. Apparently, Mick had had a couple of cocktails. (I know, I know --
Mick Jagger? Booze? Hard to believe.) As soon as he spotted me, his eyes lit
up and he said -- this was unbelievable -- "Where's a bloke take a pee around
here?";    Admit it, the man has star quality. And that's something you're
born with, if you ask me.;    So I said (oh, you'll love this): "Down this
hall until you come to the elevator, and it's the first door on your right."; 
  With that, Mick stumbled off with a wave of his hand. Me, I had tears in my
eyes, the moment was so touching. Mick, he's the greatest.;    Then again, so
is Tony Danza. Oh, yeah, I met him, too. Well, I didn't actually meet him, at
least not in the sense where you're formally introduced and shake hands and
all that.;    What happened was, I was out in Las Vegas covering a fight. And
one day I was standing in front of my hotel when who do I notice standing next
to me but Mr. Tony Danza.;    Mr. Danza -- oh, hell, Tony -- broke the ice
first. Pressing a $5 bill in my hand, he said: "The silver Mercedes in the
second row.";    God, it was a beautiful car! Black trim, red leather
interior, no furry dice hanging from the rearview mirror, either.;    I had a
little trouble getting the damn thing into first gear -- had to bang it pretty
hard, even with the clutch down -- but what's a new transmission to a big star
like Tony Danza?;    Maybe what I'm trying to say is that these celebrities
are just like you and me, except they're a hell of a lot richer, a lot
better-looking, live in nicer homes and have servants at their beck and call
while we break our backs for 12 hours in some dreary sweatshop and come home
to a gloomy, roach-infested apartment where we end the day eating a tuna melt
and Sprite off a tray table while watching "Jake and the Fat Man.";    Boy,
that burns me up.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  TELEVISION; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  NEW television shows based on hit movies are supposed to be especially blessed
because most people already know what they're about and don't have to be
bludgeoned into tuning in for at least a sample look.;    Now I'll tell you
about one that not only wasn't blessed, but might even have been cursed.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  'BABY TALK': IT WAS DEFINITELY TIME FOR A
CHANGE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Television  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     It's called "Baby Talk." You may have seen it around the halfway mark of
the past TV season -- and lived to regret it. Nestled among the four "TGIF"
comedies on ABC's Friday night lineup, it collected a huge pile of bad
reviews, but not many fans who couldn't face life without it.;    At first,
"Baby Talk" seemed a surefire hit. It was under the care of Ed. Weinberger,
one of TV's most successful writer-producers, whose hits date back to "The
Mary Tyler Moore Show." It also starred Connie Sellecca, a well-known TV star
from ABC's popular "Hotel" drama series. And it was based on one of 1989's
biggest hit movies, "Look Who's Talking.";    But trouble nipped at its heels
from the start.;    First, Columbia, the studio behind it, decided not to call
it "Look Who's Talking." They feared it would confuse people to have a TV
series by that name while "Look Who's Talking, Too," the movie sequel they
brought out last summer, was still playing in theaters.;    So they blew the
advantages of having a "pre-sold" title.;    Then, just before "Baby Talk" was
due to go into production, Sellecca left. It was, the network said, a mutual
decision. Nobody wanted Sellecca playing the unwed mom of a baby who "thinks"
with the voice of Tony Danza, including Sellecca.;    Without a new star to
stand in for Sellecca, Weinberger couldn't deliver the show on time, and ABC
had to remove it from the fall lineup.;    Then, when Weinberger hired former
"Newhart" star Julia Duffy to take over the role, all the scripts had to be
revised. Sellecca is tall, dark and dramatic and Duffy is short, blond and
comedic.;    Nor was it helpful that Duffy soon learned to hate her role. Once
the reviews came in and a critics' poll named it worst show of the season, she
wanted to crawl into the baby's cradle and pull its blanket over her head. She
wanted out, out, out.;    Normally, that's where my story would end. "Baby
Talk" was getting bad reviews, slightly better than mediocre ratings and was
about to lose its star for the second time. Nothing about it was working.
Everything pointed to cancellation.;    So, guess what? Come Friday, Sept. 20,
at 9:30 p.m., "Baby Talk" will have its season premiere. If we're lucky, none
of us will recognize it.;    Gone are Weinberger, Duffy and everybody else in
the cast except Paul and Ryan Jessup, the twin babies who share the role of
little Mikey. (Danza returns as the baby's voice.) The setting will shift to
an apartment building in Brooklyn Heights and the story won't stop so often to
let us "hear" Mikey's thoughts.;    Mary Page Keller, who last season played a
single mother on ABC's "Life Goes On," will take over the role of Mikey's mom,
Maggie, and Scott Baio ("Happy Days," "Joanie Loves Chachi") will play her new
boyfriend, James, a young musician/composer who lives next door.;    For all
practical purposes, it's a completely new show, but with two leads who more
closely resemble the stars of the original movie: Kirstie Alley and John
Travolta.;    That's fine with new producers Bernie Orenstein and Saul
Turteltaub ("Kate &amp; Allie," "Sanford &amp; Son"), who didn't care for the show
last season. Neither did Baio, for that matter. Keller, mercifully, never saw
it.;    So why is something called "Baby Talk" coming back? My best guess is
it avoided disaster by having a concept ABC still had faith in and so-so
ratings, mostly due to the protected time slot it had behind three consecutive
hits.;    The new producers hope to take better advantage of that same
protected time slot by concentrating more on the budding romance between
Maggie and James, less on the wisecracks from the baby's brain.;    "We found
that the characters in the last version of the show were not very realistic,"
said Turteltaub at a recent meeting with the press to discuss the show's
overhaul.;    Turteltaub and Orenstein didn't like the idea of two workmen
practically living round the clock in Maggie's house, nor her constantly
leaving her baby with those two clowns while she went out.;    Instead, they
want the new "Baby Talk" to be more like the movie, with Maggie searching for
a father for her child and gradually realizing the guy next door is her ideal
choice.;    Though some viewers may be surprised to find the same baby living
in a new apartment with a new, dark-haired mom this fall, so far there's no
plan for any on-screen explanation of why Maggie looks like a different
person.;    "We thought of a lot of ways to do it," said Orenstein, "like
opening with Mary Page Keller just taking the bandages off and saying: 'I hope
I haven't changed much.' I don't know what we'll do. I don't think America
really cares.";    That may be the one part they've got right so far.  </TEXT>

   ABC's baby boomer shows, the 1980s
ensemble drama ``thirtysomething,'' and the 1960s nostalgia comedy,
``The Wonder Years,'' won as best series Sunday night at the 40th
annual Emmy Awards.
   Tyne Daly won her fourth Emmy as lead actress in the police
drama ``Cagney &amp; Lacey'' and Michael J. Fox of ``Family Ties'' won
his third as lead actor in a comedy series.
   Richard Kiley was picked as best lead actor in a drama for the
canceled but acclaimed series ``A Year in the Life,'' and he
chastised NBC for the ``corporate myopia that killed a fine show.''
   John Larroquette won his fourth straight Emmy as best supporting
actor in the comedy ``Night Court.''
   Beatrice Arthur joined her two ``Golden Girls'' co-stars,
previous winners Rue McClanahan and Betty White, in picking up the
Emmy for best actress in a comedy series. Estelle Getty, who plays
the feisty matriarch on the NBC series, won as best supporting
actress.
   The award for best supporting actress in a drama went to
Patricia Wettig, the struggling young mother with a rocky marriage
on ``thirtysomething.'' The new serio-comic series about people in
their 30s struggling through the 1980s won four Emmys.
   ``The Wonder Years,'' another new show last season, is a grown
man's recollection of coming of age in the 1960s.
   Larry Drake picked up an award for best supporting actor in a
drama series for his sensitive portrayal of a mentally retarded
office boy on ``L.A. Law.''
   His award and an editing Emmy were the only honors won by ``L.A.
Law,'' which led all shows with 19 nominations and was last year's
big winner.
   No one series or network dominated the awards, dominated in
recent years by NBC. ABC won 21, CBS won 20, and NBC won 19. The
Public Broadcasting Service won seven and Home Box Office, in the
first year cable networks were eligible, won three. Syndicated
shows also won three.
   The most Emmys _ five _ were won by a special ``Julie Andrews
... The Sound of Christmas.''
   CBS' ``Irving Berlin's 100th Birthday Celebration'' won the
award for best variety special, beating out NBC's David Letterman,
Fox's Tracey Ullman and the Smothers Brothers on CBS.
   ``The Murder of Mary Phagan,'' NBC's fact-based story of a
businessman wrongly convicted and lynched for the murder of a
13-year-old girl won as best miniseries.
   Best lead performances in a miniseries or special went to Jason
Robards in NBC's remake of ``Inherit the Wind,'' and Jessica Tandy
for ``Foxfire: Hallmark Hall of Fame'' on CBS. She played a
backwoods widow coming to terms with the death of her husband,
played by Miss Tandy's real-life husband, Hume Cronyn.
   British actress Jane Seymour's portrayal of Maria Callas on
ABC's ``Onassis: The Richest Man in the World,'' won her an Emmy
for best supporting actress in a miniseries or special. John Shea
won the supporting actor award in that category for his role in
ABC's ``Baby M,'' as William Stern the natural father in the New
Jersey surrogate mother court case.
   Writing awards went to ``thirtysomething,'' CBS' ``Frank's
Place,'' and ``Jackie Mason on Broadway'' on HBO.
   Directing Emmys went to NBC's now-canceled drama ``St.
Elsewhere,'' ABC's comedy ``Hooperman,'' the CBS miniseries ``The
Attic: The Hiding of Anne Frank, General Foods Golden Showcase,''
and the public TV special ``Celebrating Gershwin: Great
Performances.''
   Robin Williams won an Emmy for ``ABC Presents a Royal Gala.''
   ``Now I am officially overwhelmed!'' said Larroquette, who
picked up his fourth-straight award for his portrayal of a
skirt-chasing assistant prosecutor on the NBC comedy spoof of the
legal system. He jokingly thanked the Emmy voters for their
``magnanimous generosity and their keen eye for talent.''
   ``I didn't expect this to happen this time,'' said the newlywed
Fox, who won three years in a row for playing the up-and-coming
yuppie Alex Keaton on ``Family Ties.'' ``I can't be any happier
than to say, `I thank my wife, Tracy.'''
   Ms. Daly, whose co-star Sharon Gless won in the category last
year, was not present to pick up her statuette for her portrayal of
Detective Mary Beth Lacey in the series that almost was canceled in
its first season in 1982 and won't be returning next season.
   Sunday night's show on Fox Broadcasting reunited oldtime
co-stars Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke, and William Shatner
and Leonard Nimoy of ``Star Trek,'' as presenters of the Television
Academy of Arts and Sciences Awards.
   Other presenters during the ceremony at the 3,000-seat Pasadena
Civic Auditorium included Fox, Danny DeVito, Tracey Ullmann, Ms.
Gless, Penny Marshall, Garry Shandling and Alf. There was no single
host this year.
   Executive producer Lorne Michaels, the creator of ``Saturday
Night Live,'' was brought in by the academy in hopes of enlivening
the Emmy show, which most critics considered a four-hour yawn last
year.
   ``This show won't take itself too seriously,'' Michaels said.
   To that end, it featured a ``designated acceptor'' for absent
winners _ actor Tony Danza. He was kept busy throughout the night
as others winners were not present, and after a half-dozen walks to
the stage, he cracked: ``Now I'm mad; where are these people?''
   To add to the merriment, Michaels enlisted ``Saturday Night's''
Nora Dunn and Jan Hooks as the ``Sweeney Sisters.'' They gave
mockish versions of television theme songs and trooped the stellar
audience squealing at the celebrities.

   Last year the Emmy telecast received its lowest rating on
record. That was the first time the Emmys had not been presented on
ABC, CBS or NBC. Fox outbid the big three networks and entered into
a three-year contract.
   For the first time this year, programs broadcast on cable were
eligible, as long as they were available to 50 percent of the
nation's population. Five cable networks managed to collect 21
nominations among them, compared to 114 for NBC, 87 for CBS, 75 for
ABC, and 27 for PBS.
   The Emmy telecast, which normally is scheduled for late
September, was earlier this year to avoid competing with the
Olympic Games, said academy spokesman Murray Weissman.

<LEADPARA>  CBS is lining up a stellar list of names for its "Stompin' at the Savoy.";  
We've learned that Lynn Whitfield, Jasmine Guy, Vanessa Williams and Mario Van
Peebles are set to star in the musical drama based in Depression-era Harlem --
and that "Dream Girl" Jennifer Holliday is reportedly in negotiations for a
singing-only portrayal of a young Ella Fitzgerald.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  SAVVY LINEUP FOR CBS'S 'SAVOY'  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  The Grapevine  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "Savoy" is being rushed toward a Jan. 6 production start -- and what a rush
it is. With the network hoping to have the elaborate project ready for spring
airing, producer Richard Maynor and director Debbie Allen aren't getting much
time for holiday cheer. Casting is still under way. Rights to vintage songs
are still being cleared. The crunch of activities is toughest on Allen, who's
been battling the flu while juggling work on her "A Different World" series
with a whirlwind of "Savoy" activities -- including a quick location-scouting
trip to North Carolina. (She's also taking a bit part in the telepic -- as a
hooker.);   SOMETHING NEW: ABC has given a green light to Tony Danza for
production of a reality show pilot to be made by his Katie Face Productions.
As the "Who's the Boss?" hunk has explained the reality offering he hopes to
see as a weekly show, "It'll offer assistance to inner-city kids and will
chronicle their progress." Danza, who considers this the final year for the
7-year-old "Boss," has been talking about serving as narrator of the reality
program. The pilot is expected to shoot in early '92.;   PUTTING ON HIS ACTING
GLOVES: Former heavyweight boxing champ James "Buster" Douglas is in
Vancouver, British Columbia, to film an episode of Stephen J. Cannell's
syndicated "Street Justice" series, which stars Carl Weathers and Bryan
Genesse. In his first acting role, Douglas plays a prison inmate hired by the
mob to kill a friend of Grady's (Genesse) who was recently sent to prison.
Douglas is donating his salary from the show, scheduled to air in February, to
the Lula Pearl Douglas Foundation. He founded the non-profit charity
organization dedicated to helping inner city youth in memory of his mother,
who died two weeks before his February '90 championship bout with Mike Tyson.;
  SNOWBOUND?: Though the casting sign is still lit for "Aspen" and there are
reports that the big-screen story of two ski instructors will roll in
February, producer Leonard Goldberg says "all that has been premature" -- and
that he doesn't even know if the drama will get made.;   From Liz Smith in New
York; I DON'T care what director Tony Bill is telling other columnists. He and
MGM-Pathe wanted Madonna to test for "Baboon Heart." All that's happened since
then is that they reluctantly backed down from their demand after Madonna
refused.;   So it did indeed look as if she would do the movie after getting
her way. But now I hear again she is out of this project, which is to star
Billy Baldwin.;   HERE'S ANOTHER departure from conventional wisdom. Word had
been going around that Bruce Willis and his movie career are all washed up.
Rumor had it that his latest, "The Last Boy Scout," would never pull Bruce's
"Bonfire of the Vanities" and "Hudson Hawk" flops out of the fire. And all
this stuff started before anyone had even seen the new movie.;   Well, I went
to see "The Last Boy Scout" at a sneak preview, and the audience went wild!
This picture is a combo of "Die Hard," "Beverly Hills Cop" and "Lethal
Weapon," and you can add all their sequels, too. I don't see how "The Last Boy
Scout" can fail -- it has the requisite action, violence, cynicism, alienated
people, proper villains, and it has Willis in his Humphrey Bogart phase. Not
bad.;   OK -- so Vanilla Ice's movie, "Cool as Ice," which was supposed to
turn him into "the new Elvis," didn't exactly set off a box-office inferno.
Still, the great white rapper has obviously saved his pennies. Ice recently
closed a deal on an estate on Miami Beach's exclusive Starr Island, where a
"small cottage" runs in the million-dollar range.;   As his neighbor, Ice will
have superstar pop/salsa queen, Gloria Estefan -- just three doors down. Maybe
Estefan can give Ice some tips on how to handle a big career, once you have
one.  </TEXT>

   If you didn't know better, you'd swear it was
this TV season, not last year's, suffering from the creative woes of
a writers strike.
   The 1989-90 season that officially begins Sept. 18 offers
witches, nuns, inner-city teachers, cute families and buddy cops.
   Very little here hasn't been seen before.
   Alarmingly, there are fewer exceptions to the rule that network
fare must strive to reach new depths of mediocrity. This isn't going
to help the networks stem the audience erosion that has plagued them
in recent years. Who wouldn't rather rent a movie that be stuck with
``Baywatch?''
   In seasons past, previewing the fall shows generally revealed a
few that broke the same-old-stuff mold _ the ``Frank's Places'' and
``Miami Vices'' and ``Hill Street Blueses.''
   Most of this year's new shows range from dismal to mediocre _ BUT
...
   ABC does have the admirable ``Life Goes On,'' a wry and realistic
family drama whose cast includes a real-life Down's syndrome actor
playing a teen-age son who has the condition.
   And CBS has ``The Famous Teddy Z,'' a sophisticated, inside-show
business comedy starring Jon Cryer (``Pretty in Pink'') as a
mail-room nobody instantly elevated to high-powered agent. It was
created by Hugh Wilson, who was owed one by CBS after the network
canceled his critically acclaimed ``Frank's Place.''
   Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner, producers of the hits ``The Cosby
Show,'' ``Roseanne'' and ``A Different World,'' will try to do it
again with ``Chicken Soup,'' on ABC, starring stand-up comic Jackie
Mason as a nice Jewish man having an affair with his Catholic
neighbor, played by Lynn Redgrave.
   And CBS has ``Major Dad,'' a sitcom starring the bankable Gerald
McRaney (``Simon &amp; Simon'') as a macho, right-wing Marine trying to
adjust to married life with a liberal wife (Shanna Reed) and three
step-daughters.
   NBC could break some ground with the political crime drama
``Mancuso, FBI,'' starring Robert Loggia as the burned-out FBI agent
he played in the provocative miniseries ``Favorite Son.''
   And no one can accuse ABC's ``Doogie Howser, M.D.'' of
copy-catting. The half-hour ``dramedy,'' from Steven Bochco (``L.A.
Law,'' ``Hooperman'') revolves around a 16-year-old boy wonder who
is a physician.
   Otherwise, the fall lineup looks like rehashes, also-rans and
sleep aids.
   NBC had little room for improvement, having already pummeled ABC
and CBS for four seasons. But in its effort to seek the perfect
prime-time schedule it has deigned to do some minor tinkering,
adding five new shows. ABC and CBS added nine and eight,
respectively.
   There's NBC's ``Sister Kate,'' starring Stephanie Beacham, former
glamour girl on ``Dynasty,'' who is surprisingly well-cast as a
crotchety nun with a passel of precious urchins.
   ``Nutt House'' is mindless slapstick about an ill-run New York
hotel, starring Harvey Korman and Cloris Leachman. It comes from Mel
Brooks, who teamed with wunderkind Alan Spencer, creator of ``Sledge
Hammer!'' It is paired with ``Night Court,'' which looks like
educational television by comparison.
   What would society do without a network hour devoted to the
emotional involvements of scantily clad lifeguards? NBC has met the
challenge with ``Baywatch,'' sadly the only show on this season from
Mr. Quality Television, Grant Tinker's company.
   Do you miss ``Miami Vice?'' NBC replaces it with another
buddy-cops show. This time, it's old cop-young cop and called
``Hardball.'' Not as much style as ``Vice,'' but good character
possibilities.
   Third-place CBS, which has the greatest need for breakout shows,
has settled instead for a bottom-of-the-barrel ratings ploy,
``Rescue 911,'' a graphic ``reality-based'' show about emergency
calls. It is a throwback to the early days of last season when the
writers strike crippled production of fiction shows and the networks
had to stoop to stuff like this. This season, CBS is putting it on
by choice.
   CBS' ``Island Son'' lured perennial miniseries star Richard
Chamberlain back to series television with a Hawaii locale and a
role as a doctor. It wasn't available for pre-season scrutiny.
   ``The People Next Door,'' a sitcom about a cartoonist and his
family, relies on special effects and apparently hopes to capitalize
on the success of ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit.'' It's an ambitious
attempt, but doesn't work.
   ``Wolf'' stars Jack Scalia in another version of the discredited
cop who becomes a private eye and tries to clear his name. There's
nothing to help viewers pick this one out of a lineup.
   CBS' ``Peaceable Kingdom'' stars the durable Lindsay Wagner as a
remarkably boring zoo administrator. The cheetah is a better actor.
   Stephen Cannell (``Wiseguy,'' ``Hunter'') has a third network
show, ``Top of the Hill,'' starring William Katt (``Greatest
American Hero'') as a long-haired surfer who takes over his ailing
father's congressional seat. Civics 101 was more riveting.
   ``Snoops'' is a screwball mystery-comedy starring Tim and Daphne
Maxwell Reid, former stars of ``Frank's Place.'' He is a professor
of criminology, she is a protocol officer. Nothing was available for
pre-screening, but these are likable stars.
   ABC's ballyhooed deal with Bochco has yielded the questionable
but competent ``Doogie Howser,'' starring Neil Patrick Harris as the
16-year-old genius with a medical license.
   CBS made a little headway with the Western ``Paradise'' last
season. ABC, perhaps inspired more by the success of CBS' ``Lonesome
Dove,'' adds another of the long-missing Western genre, ``The Young
Riders,'' about the Pony Express. It needs better writing.
   ABC has two innocuous spinoffs. From ``Who's the Boss?'' comes
``Living Dolls,'' a sitcom about four teen-aged models sharing an
apartment in New York. Michael Learned stars as their den mother.
The other is ``Family Matters,'' a black family sitcom centered on
the extended family of acerbic elevator operator, Harriette, of
``Perfect Strangers.''
   A writer-producer spun off ABC's ``Head of the Class'' to create
a black ``Welcome Back, Kotter'' in the new ``Homeroom.''
   In ABC's ``Free Spirit'' a housekeeper who's a witch goes to work
for a single father. What comic possibilities!
   To recap, CBS has two good bets in ``Major Dad'' and ``Teddy Z,''
both joining the reasonably successful Monday comedy lineup. But
they'll likely be moved to other nights.
   ABC's ``Life Goes On'' deserves a break and might get one. It's
in a time period opposite the top-10 ``60 Minutes'' and isn't
expected to do boffo numbers, so it might stay around a while.
Critical response should help it.
   ABC's ``Chicken Soup'' is an acquired taste, but it has a cushy
time slot, behind ``Roseanne.'' Hey, a lot of people think Jackie
Mason is very funny.
   Likely goners, due to low quality and-or tough competition,
include ``Homeroom,'' ``Peaceable Kingdom,'' ``Wolf'' and ``Free
Spirit.''
   ``Nutt House'' could get a cult following of over-medicated
viewers, but don't bet on it.
   The rest of the pack merit little more than a shrug.
   So there you have one of the reasons that almost two-thirds of
homes with televisions also have cable and why a third of viewers
opted for something other than network programs last season.
   This season, those people will pay their cable bills happily.

9 p.m., Chs. 5, 10, 46.;  A RECONSTITUTED yuppie and her talking baby, a
Soviet stand-up comic in Idaho, a family shattered by a brutal crime and a
look back at a musical-film legend -- they're all on the TV menu this
weekend.;    As Yakov Smirnoff would say, "America, what a country!";    No,
they're not all great viewing, but there's more good than bad, particularly in
PBS's delightful "Fred Astaire Songbook" and the Showtime pay-TV network's
hilarious "Yakov Smirnoff from Moscow . . . Idaho.";    But first let's deal
with ABC's "Baby Talk," the long-awaited -- or long-dreaded, depending on your
orientation -- TV version of the hit movie "Look Who's Talking." It "previews"
tonight at 8:30 (Chs. 7, 11, 13), then moves to its regular time slot
(9:30-10) next Friday for its formal premiere.;    "Baby Talk" was supposed to
be on the fall lineup, but was yanked when its original star, Connie Sellecca,
had a falling out with the network and was replaced. By the time ABC settled
on Julia Duffy, the snooty Stephanie from "Newhart," it was too late for
fall.;    Duffy's new character, Maggie, isn't a spoiled yuppie this time.
Instead, she's a lively single mom with a baby who "thinks" his dialogue in
the voice of Tony "Who's the Boss?" Danza.;    As the producers of "Look Who's
Talking" discovered when last year's sequel bombed, this is a concept that
gets old really quickly. In fact, it's obvious the series has no future once
baby Mickey (played by twins Paul and Ryan Jessup) starts learning to talk for
himself.;    Still, there are quite a few good snickers in tonight's show,
particularly when Mickey meets up with Danielle, the infant daughter of
Maggie's boyfriend, and starts hitting on her.;     "I love pink," says
Danielle, who's dressed in it. "It makes me feel so feminine. I hope I'm a
girl.";    "I hope so, too," says the leering Mickey, who gets so excited that
Mom has to change his diaper.;    Yes, a little of this goes a long way, but
I'll be happy to suffer through a few more half hours for a few snickers and a
lot of Julia Duffy.;    Much more to my taste is PBS's "Fred Astaire
Songbook," a special in the regular "Great Performances" series. It plays
Saturday night at 8:30 on Ch. 54.;    Hosted by Audrey Hepburn, Astaire's
co-star in "Funny Face" (1957), the special approaches the late, great dancing
star primarily as a singer for whom some of the country's legendary
songwriters penned some of their best songs.;    They knew what they were
doing, too, as the liberal selection of film clips aptly demonstrates. We see
Astaire singing Gershwin's "A Foggy Day" and "They Can't Take That Away From
Me," Berlin's "Isn't This a Lovely Day" and "Easter Parade," and dozens more
from Cole Porter ("Night and Day"), Jerome Kern ("Lovely to Look At"), Johnny
Mercer ("One for My Baby") and many others.;    The show also is stuffed with
rare footage -- including a rejected version of "I Wanna Be a Dancing Man"
from "Belle of New York" -- and oddities from early TV, including Astaire's
somewhat rumpled 1958 gig on "The Oscar Levant Show.";    Lots of anecdotes
also flow from people who knew Astaire, including songwriter Burton Lane, who
wrote a song at age 17 that he dreamed Astaire someday would sing.
Miraculously, Astaire not only sang Lane's "You're All the World to Me" in the
1951 film "Royal Wedding" but turned it into an immortal movie moment by
making it his renowned "dancing on the ceiling" number.;    We even get to
hear Astaire singing the hit tune he wrote with Johnny Mercer, "I'm Building
Up to an Awful Letdown," in a tape from an early "Dick Cavett Show.";    His
secret for putting across a song, most of the experts agree, was simplicity:
He sang the lyrics in an almost conversational manner. He was so good at it,
in fact, that you might even forget he could dance, too.;    An hour later, at
9:30, Showtime brings on another outstanding entertainment: Soviet emigre
comic Yakov Smirnoff, taped during a performance at the University of Idaho --
in Moscow.;    Though Smirnoff still gets lots of laughs by comparing life in
the Soviet Union to life in the United States, that's no longer his whole act.
He does an extended segment on parenthood -- he's a new father -- and even
takes questions from the crowd and turns them into fodder for his act.;    But
his glasnost-era gags really had me rolling on the floor. Item: His uncle
writes that glasnost has so changed Soviet life that you can even walk up to
the Kremlin wall and urinate. Of course, you can't unzip your pants, but still
. . .;    Smirnoff also shows us some funny -- and even touching -- scenes
from his recent real-life return to Moscow, including a visit to his original
home. Will he someday take his American-born daughter, Natasha, to see her
ancestral land?;    "Yes, if she has any behavior problems," he says. "Couple
of days in Soviet day-care center will straighten her right out.";    Finally,
there's the grim CBS movie, "Aftermath: A Test of Love," which turns up Sunday
night at 9 (Chs. 5, 10, 46). It's the true story of what happened to an
American family after a violent crime kills the mother and leaves one of the
children brain-damaged and fighting for life.;    Frankly, it was way too grim
for me, particularly the horrifying scenes where armed robbers force the
victims of a holdup to drink drain cleaner before shooting them in the head.; 
  But "Aftermath" is worth watching for one overwhelming reason: a towering
performance by Richard Chamberlain in a real change of pace from his usual
heroic roles. Here he's a middle-aged, grieving father, trying to cope with
the death of his wife (Michael Learned) and the tragic injuries to his teen
age son (Dennis Heames).;    Chamberlain has never been so moving -- or
vulnerable -- than as the guilt-ridden father who has to hold his family
together after making them a lower priority in his life for way too long.;   
It may not be the most cheerful way to end an otherwise uplifting TV weekend,
but it might be the show that sticks longest in your memory afterward.  </TEXT>

   Now that the networks have announced their fall
schedules, let the trend-noting begin.
   Even though Nielsen figures show viewers are becoming
increasingly disenchanted with network television, the networks
seem to think what audiences want to watch on TV is TV. Four
comedies slated for next season are set in the wacky world of
television:
   _``TV101'' on CBS, from GTG Entertainment, Grant Tinker's new
production company, is about a journalism teacher (Sam Robards) who
returns to his high school alma mater to teach the kids about TV
reportage.
   _``Studio 5B'' on ABC is set in the morning news show milieu,
the title a reference to Studio 3B from which NBC's ``Today'' show
originates.
   _``Murphy Brown'' on CBS stars Candice Bergen as a barely
coping, high-profile TV news personality recently released from the
Betty Ford Clinic.
   _``A Fine Romance'' on ABC features Anthony Andrews and Margaret
Whitton as a divorced couple who continue as co-hosts of a
television show.
   Gone are ``dramedies'' for the most part. ABC canceled ``The
`Slap' Maxwell Story,'' and NBC is expected to drop ``The Days and
Nights of Molly Dodd'' after its current run. But CBS is holding
onto ``Frank's Place,'' perhaps the best new show last season, as a
midseason returnee. ``Hooperman'' on ABC was the only real success
of the four that premiered last fall.
   Gone is ``St. Elsewhere,'' itself a trend marking the end of an
era.
   Back are old standbys and tried-and-true troupers. Mary Tyler
Moore is back on CBS in a new comedy, as is her one-time co-star
Dick Van Dyke in a separate show. Peter Falk returns as ``Columbo''
on ABC in a rotating series that also features Burt Reynolds as a
private eye.
   There will be more so-called ``tabloid TV.'' NBC makes a regular
series out of its popular ``Unsolved Mysteries'' specials. ABC
offers ``Incredible Sunday,'' a remake of ``That's Incredible.''
   There are two movie spinoffs: NBC's ``Baby Boom'' casts Kate
Jackson (``Scarecrow and Mrs. King'') in the role Diane Keaton
created in the movie of the same name about a high-powered
executive who inherits an infant. CBS has Patrick Cassidy and
Melora Hardin playing the Patrick Swayze-Jennifer Grey roles in
``Dirty Dancing.''
   History offers no encouragement for these two. The last time a
movie spinoff was a big hit was ``Alice,'' the long-running sitcom
based on the movie ``Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.'' ``Starman''
premiered in 1986, but only lasted a season. This season's
``Supercarrier,'' a thinly veiled version of the hit movie ``Top
Gun,'' soon sank.
   There are a more families next season, but the ``The Cosby
Show'' won't have to worry about competition from other typical,
nuclear families in the neighborhood. TV likes one-parent
households.
   This season, moms fared poorly:
   _``Full House,'' mother dead;
   _``My Two Dads,'' mother dead;
   _``Valerie's Family,'' mother dead;
   _``I Married Dora,'' mother dead.
   Next season's families are missing moms and dads through
combinations of death and divorce and selfishness.
   _``Baby Boom,'' mother single;
   _Mary Tyler Moore's show, mother divorced;
   _``Close to Home,'' mother off finding self;
   _``Dear John,'' husband divorced;
   _``Empty Nest,'' mother dead;
   _``The Robert Guillaume Show,'' father divorced;
   _``Paradise,'' children inherited, sister dead.
   NBC, which was accused by some critics of playing it safe with
its fall schedule, seems to have created two new categories:
   _``Tattinger's'' establishes the
romance-comedy-drama-set-in-popular-New York-restaurant genre; and
   _``Midnight Caller'' creates an
ex-cop-turned-late-night-radio-talk-show-host formula.
   It isn't hard to predict the hits among the new shows _ just
look at what NBC put in its Thursday and Saturday lineups: ``Dear
John'' starring Judd Hirsch follows ``Cheers'' on Thursday; ``Empty
Nest'' with Richard Mulligan is spun off and follows ``Golden
Girls'' on Saturday.
   And ABC is giving ``Rosanne,'' a sitcom starring the
wisecracking comic Roseanne Barr, a space in its successful Tuesday
night lineup.

   Elsewhere in television:
   EMMY NIGHT LIVE _ Lorne Michaels, executive producer of NBC's
``Saturday Night Live,'' has signed to produce the 40th Annual Emmy
Awards on Fox. The celebration of television excellence airs live
Aug. 28, for the second year on the fledgling network. Fox hopes
Michaels will infuse the overlong, often leaden event with some
wit. Michaels himself has won six Emmies. ...
   STARS' FAVORITE SOAPS _ Bette Davis loves ``As the World Turns''
and ``Guiding Light,'' Sammy Davis watches ``Ryan's Hope'' and
``General Hospital'' every day, Carol Burnett made an appearance on
her favorite daytime drama, ``All My Children,'' and Aretha
Franklin adores ``The Young and the Restless.'' These soap-lovers'
confessions are contained in the June 28 issue of Soap Opera
Digest, which goes on to reveal that Crystal Gayle watches
``Another World'' along with the guys in her band and that Nancy
Culp, who played Miss Hathaway on ``The Beverly Hillbillies,'' is a
``Santa Barbara'' addict.

<HEAD>Man Accused of Bothering Child TV Star Dies After Drinking
Pesticide</HEAD>

   A man accused of mailing sexually explicit
letters to the child star of the ``Who's the Boss?'' television
show died 11 days after drinking a pesticide, authorities said
Saturday.
   A postmortem examination determined that Mark A. Budman, 28, of
Carson died of pneumonia and respiratory failure caused by
malathion poisoning, said David Campbell, coroner's supervising
investigator.
   Campbell said Budman's death was a suicide.
   Budman was pronounced dead Thursday at Harbor-UCLA Medical
Center in Torrance, said Sheriff's Deputy Patrick Hunter. Budman
was admitted to the hospital's intensive care unit July 8 after
drinking malathion, Hunter said.
   Budman had previously tried to kill himself, authorities said.
   The man drank a quart of malathion, said Deputy City Attorney
Alice Hand, who was prosecuting Budman in connection with
harassment of actor Danny Pintauro.
   The prosecutor said Budman was charged June 7 with two
misdemeanor counts of sending ``bizarre letters featuring sexual
acts,'' to Pintauro, who plays Jonathan Bower on the ABC-TV show
starring Tony Danza. On the series, Danza plays housekeeper to
executive Angela Bower and Jonathan, her teen-age son.
   Letters and cassette tapes were sent to the young actor from
March 1 to May 31, the prosecutor said. A warrant was issued after
Budman failed to appear for a July 12 court date.
   Malathion is a commonly used pesticide available at most garden
shops, hardware stores and nurseries.
   State agriculture officials have been spraying a syrup laced
with malathion over parts of Southern California periodically for
nearly a year in an effort to wipe out a Mediterranean fruit fly
infestation.
   The spraying has prompted angry protests from residents
complaining about the potential risks to public health, and several
cities have tried unsuccessfully to halt the nighttime helicopter
missions.
   Agriculture officials maintain that the pesticide is diluted to
such small amounts that the aerial application is safe.

   Tony Danza, the former professional boxer who

   ``I don't deserve this, when I see all the talented people out

kid from New York, I couldn't resist my name in the sidewalk.''
   Danza gained fame as an aspiring boxer moonlighting as a cabbie

   Hollywood stars today are ``sort of a strange
breed'' who really don't know how to dress well, says Rodeo Drive
dress shop owner Herbert Fink.
   ``Some of them reach stardom very quickly. Quite often they're
from small, unsophisticated areas, so they really have no idea of
how to dress. They wear the wrong colors, the wrong styles. They
have all this money and they almost don't know how to spend it,'' he
said in this week's TV Guide.
   ``Dynasty'' designer Nolan Miller agreed. Asked to name six
Hollywood women with class and taste, Miller could only come up with
two from his show: Diahann Carroll and Linda Evans.
   ``All you have to do is catch a plane to see how far fashion has
gone downhill,'' he said. ``You see actresses in jogging suits.''
   But ``Wheel of Fortune'' co-host Vanna White said fans prefer the
casual look.
   ``They think I'm a real person,'' she said. ``I mean, I wear nice
sweats. I'm presentable. And I think it's great because stars are
humans, just like everybody else.''

   Prince Charles is taking his campaign for more
sensitive building design into the book stores with the publication
of ``A Vision of Britain, A Personal View of Architecture.''
   Royalties from the book, based on the Prince of Wales' recent
television program on architecture, will be given to his Charities'
Trust along with a $543,000 advance.
   Doubleday U.K., a division of the Transworld Publishers Ltd.,
said it will publish the hardcover book in Britain in March. It also
will be released in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United
States.
   In the Oct. 29 TV documentary, which he wrote himself and
appeared in, Prince Charles said some urban developers were
inflicting ``terrible damage'' on city landscapes.
   The 40-year-old heir to the British throne said they should
listen more to the views of ordinary people and what they wanted
when building the nation's inner cities.

   It's only a series of simple ``hellos,'' but
when the greeters include President Reagan, Rajiv Gandhi and Prince
Charles among others, two Nebraska brothers think it can add up to
world peace.
   ``I guess when you get the heads of states of 100 countries
together on anything you have really accomplished something,'' said
Michael McCormack, who along with his 31-year-old brother, Brian,
started World Hello Day 15 years ago.
   More than 100 world leaders have passed along greetings of
``hello'' and peace this year, including Reagan, Prime Minister
Gandhi of India and Israeli President Chaim Herzog, McCormack said
Monday.
   McCormack, 36, was attending Harvard University in 1973 when he
and Brian started World Hello Day in response to the growing tension
in the Middle East.
   Others who have participated in World Hello Day include Pope John
Paul II, Mother Teresa, Bishop Desmond Tutu, Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa, the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, Costa Rican
President Oscar Arias Sanchez, Queen Elizabeth II and former
Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.

his theatrical debut at Duke University as a man who turns into an
insect in Franz Kafka's horrific novella, ``The Metamorphosis.''
   Ron Kumin, Duke's drama administrative director, said he was
approached by producers of the pre-Broadway production because
Baryshnikov wanted a ``less traditional, more relaxed'' setting for
his dramatic debut.
   Baryshnikov, whose film credits include ``The Turning Point'' and
``White Nights,'' will make his stage debut Feb. 3. Performances of
the play, co-produced by Roger Stevens and Lars Schmidt, will run
through Feb. 25, Kumin said this week.

   Arizona Attorney General Bob Corbin, sporting a
four-day growth of beard, mounted a horse to play a role in the
television series ``Unsolved Mysteries.''
   Corbin's hobby, searching for the Lost Dutchman gold mine in the
Superstition Mountains, led to the role in a segment about the death
of Walt Gassler, who may have discovered the 19th-century mine.
   Corbin and a friend, Tom Kollenborn of Apache Junction, were
filmed last weekend making a mock search for the mine, which
included a visit to a re-creation of Gassler's camp.
   The segment is tentatively scheduled for broadcast in February.

   Yes, those creative geniuses who come up with
network television shows have been working overtime to create
fascinating new concepts that will cause you, the loyal network
television viewer, to ignore cable movies, sportschannels and
videocassette rentals and race over hot coals, if necessary, in
order to watch the local network affiliate of your choice.
   Only kidding. Despite proof that their audiences are tuning out,
the networks apparently feel compelled for 1989-90 to cling to
tired premises and spinoffs.
   They apparently hope these will miraculously entice viewers, who
come to the screen for reasons that, despite endless research and
discussion, seem to completely evade network executives still
baffled that ``Lonesome Dove'' won its time period against ``The
Sex Tapes.''
   Oh, but how can you say that? Just look at this innovation on
tap for next season:
   ABC has ``Free Spirit,'' a show about a housekeeper who's a
witch. Now, that's quality entertainment! When's the last time you
saw a television show about a witch? Well, 1972. ``Bewitched.'' Of
course, that was a good 17 years ago, and 17 years is a long time
to go without a show about a witch.
   CBS has ``Wolf.'' This is a show about a cop who was framed and
forced off the force and now works as a private investigator and
hopes to clear his name. Hmmm, sounds suspiciously like ``Private
Eye'' on NBC two years ago.
   Then NBC has ``Sister Kate.'' This is a show about a nun. Yeah,
yeah, ``The Flying Nun,'' 1970. But this is different. This a nun
with an attitude. Sally Field was a cute nun. Very different show.
   Then there's ``Nutt House'' on NBC, a wacky Mel Brooks comedy
about a bunch of madcaps who run a hotel. Sounds a little like
``Fawlty Towers''? Who cares? Nobody watches British TV over here.
   Well, CBS has ``Rescue: 911,'' where you get to see real-life
rescues, so unlike the real-life arrests on ``COPS,'' or
re-creations of real-life crimes on ``Unsolved Mysteries'' and
``America's Most Wanted.'' These are rescues, see?
   ABC's ``Homeroom'' is about an inner-city teacher who uses humor
to get through to his students. ``Welcome Back, Kotter''? No way.
Teacher's name is Harper.
   NBC's ``Baywatch'' is a really unique show about lifeguards.
Oops, even NBC is pushing this show as a reincarnation of
``CHiPs.'' Never mind.
   NBC also has ``Hardball,'' about two cops who are mismatched
partners but eventually form a bond. It goes into the old ``Miami
Vice'' time period. No, no, no, this is not a white cop-black cop
deal. This is old cop-young cop.
   Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner are putting yet another standup
comic in a prime-time sitcom. This time it's Jackie Mason in ABC's
``From This Moment On.'' Well, it is hard to argue with success.
Carsey-Werner's other comics in sitcoms are Bill Cosby and Roseanne
Barr. So it worked _ twice.
   Then there's ABC's ``Living Dolls,'' a spinoff of ``Who's the
Boss?'' And ABC's ``Family Matters,'' a spinoff of ``Perfect
Strangers,'' and NBC's ``Mancuso, FBI,'' a spinoff of the
miniseries ``Favorite Son.''
   As usual, like grass sprouts working their way up through the
concrete, there are a few unusual-sounding shows on the schedule:
   ``Life Goes On'' is about a family with an 18-year-old Down's
syndrome son and stars an actor who has Down's syndrome. It's on
ABC, which put on the unique ``thirtysomething'' last season.
   Hugh Wilson, who created the wonderful ``Frank's Place'' _
canceled, of course, by CBS _ has a new CBS comedy, ``The Famous
Teddy Z,'' about a hot-shot young Hollywood agent.
   ``Frank's Place'' stars Tim and Daphne Reid also found a place
in the new CBS schedule in ``Snoops,'' an hour comedy-mystery that
draws intelligent inspiration from Nick and Nora Charles.
   Steven Bochco (``L.A. Law,'' ``Hooperman'') has a show for ABC
about a 15-year-old medical intern, ``Doogie Howser, M.D.'' It
sounds ridiculous, but you can't say it's been done before.

   Elsewhere in television:
   DALLAS, THE MISSING MINUTES _ ``Dallas'' fans not amused that
``CBS Evening News'' anchor Dan Rather was an uninvited guest star
on last week's season finale can catch the scenes that were
pre-empted for live coverage from China when CBS presents ``Dallas:
The Missing Minutes'' tonight, a 3{-minute capsule synopsis of the
missing parts. Those on the West Coast didn't miss the minutes and
won't get to see the 3{-minute version. ...
   GOOD-BYE GILDA _ ``Saturday Night Live'' host Steve Martin paid
emotional homage to Gilda Radner on the season-ender last week.
Instead of the usual monologue, Martin introduced a tape of their
1978 classic sketch, a fantasy dance sequence that paid tribute to
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, but was set in the shallow and
distinctly un-romantic setting of a '70s discotheque. After the
tape was over, Martin said, ``Whenever I see that tape, I can't
help thinking how great you looked _ and how young I was. Gilda,
we're going to miss you.'' The show went on as usual, except that
bandleader G.E. Smith, Radner's ex-husband, wore a black armband.

RICK DU BROW: HOLIDAY SEASON A TV PARADISE FOR FILM BUFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By RICK DU BROW

<TEXT>
<P>
TV or not TV. . . . 
</P>
<P>
RETAKES: It's movie-buff heaven on TV during the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
For the next few weeks, old and new classics will pour forth -- for example, 
"From Here to Eternity," on both cable's TBS and KCOP Channel 13. 
</P>
<P>
TBS offers the film -- with Montgomery Clift, Burt Lancaster, Deborah Kerr, 
Frank Sinatra and Donna Reed -- on Dec. 27. 
</P>
<P>
It's part of a weeklong TBS package that also includes "Sergeant York" on 
Monday, "Casablanca" on Christmas and "On the Waterfront" on Dec. 26. 
</P>
<P>
KCOP, meanwhile, airs "From Here to Eternity" at midnight on New Year's Eve as 
the first entry of a commercial-free day of top films, ending with Jack 
Nicholson in "Chinatown." 
</P>
<P>
Then there's "My Left Foot," with Daniel Day-Lewis' Academy Award-winning 
performance, which turns up on Cinemax on Thursday, Christmas Day and Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
And you can also catch Judy Garland in "Meet Me in St. Louis" Thursday at 5 
p.m. on TNT. 
</P>
<P>
VCR owners -- on your mark. 
</P>
<P>
MODERN TIMES: With KTTV Channel 11 airing the Rose Parade without commercials, 
and KCOP offering its sponsor-free film festival, New Year's Day is a fine 
example of the impact of cable and VCRs on traditional TV. 
</P>
<P>
BOX OFFICE: NBC's 83rd-place rating with a documentary about Robert Redford 
showed again that movie stars may be swell on TV in motion pictures, but they 
don't draw much in television projects. TV creates its own stars. 
</P>
<P>
HEAVY: Not many performers captured the spirit of film noir more than the 
wonderful Mike Mazurki, who died the other day but remains unforgettable as the 
pathetic goon Moose Malloy in the 1944 Philip Marlowe tale "Murder, My Sweet." 
Catch it when it's rerun. 
</P>
<P>
DRAWING BOARD: Tough guy Ray Sharkey in a sitcom? Intriguing. He's made an ABC 
pilot for a backup series tentatively called "The Ray Sharkey Show," playing a 
street hustler who makes a death-bed promise to his father to take care of the 
family, running a grocery. "He's very imposing, very close to the character," 
says creator Ed. Weinberger. 
</P>
<P>
TWIST OF FATE: We were shocked -- shocked -- to see Josie (Joan Chen) suddenly 
become a virtual slave to Catherine (Piper Laurie) on Saturday's "Twin Peaks." 
Don't fall for all the cult malarkey that you have to see every minute of "Twin 
Peaks" to really enjoy it. We watch it just when we can, and it's a hoot any 
old time. 
</P>
<P>
THOUGHT FOR THE DAY: After Madonna's "Nightline" interview, the Jay Leno camp 
was wondering: "What's next -- a Persian Gulf special on the 'Tonight' show?" 
</P>
<P>
CHECKERBOARD: NBC's upcoming move to sandwich "Night Court" and "Seinfeld" 
between "Unsolved Mysteries" and "Hunter" on Wednesdays looks good on paper. 
And who could ask for more perfect continuity than comedian Jerry Seinfeld 
leading into Fred Dryer of "Hunter"? 
</P>
<P>
MOVING TARGET: Does NBC's planned move of "Dear John" to Saturdays at 10:30 
p.m., replacing "American Dreamer," mean that the network feels the Judd Hirsch 
sitcom has just about run out of steam? 
</P>
<P>
DECISIONS, DECISIONS: Foolish of CBS to cancel its Charles Kuralt-Lesley Stahl 
late-hour entry, "America Tonight," as of Jan. 18. It wasn't doing that badly 
in the ratings considering CBS' late-night, station-clearance problem. And CBS' 
11:30 p.m. replacement against "Tonight" and "Nightline," starting Jan. 21, is 
a group of action-adventure series -- the same formula that flopped before. 
</P>
<P>
TYPECAST: Really, Anita Morris is much too good to be stuck in another of those 
routine sex-bomb roles in which she turned up in CBS' "WIOU." 
</P>
<P>
VALUES: Now, let's see, local TV has plenty of room for "Inside Edition" and "A 
Current Affair," but there's no place for "Teen Talk," the prize-winning series 
canceled by KCAL Channel 9. Well, there should be. It'll only bring honor to 
whoever picks it up. 
</P>
<P>
RESEARCH: The 50-and-over crowd has latched on to NBC's strong Tuesday lineup 
of "Matlock," "In the Heat of the Night" and "Law and Order," which could turn 
out to be the network's most successful new series. 
</P>
<P>
DOUBLE TAKE: "Matlock" star Andy Griffith turns up in his old life Christmas 
Day -- on another channel -- when TBS launches the first of its fully restored 
episodes of "The Andy Griffith Show." The episode, "The Christmas Story," which 
co-stars Don Knotts, airs at 3:35 p.m. Other shows from the 1960-68 series will 
be rerun for a month starting New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
SILVER LINING: CBS, looking for some good news, must have taken heart from how 
well its two recent "Face to Face With Connie Chung" specials did in the 
ratings. Even the one on Thanksgiving night, when viewers usually tune out, 
scored nicely. 
</P>
<P>
SLEUTH: Great premise: 1930s private eye does research for famous writers like 
Hemingway and Faulkner for their Hollywood scripts. Fiction, of course. Arts 
&amp; Entertainment is doing it as a series, with Tony Peck (Greg's son) as the 
detective. 
</P>
<P>
DROPOUTS: No network scored big this fall, but NBC hollered loudest about its 
new shows, so it must be shaken by the fast flop of such entries as "Ferris 
Bueller," "Parenthood," "Working It Out," "The Fanelli Boys" and "Hull High." 
</P>
<P>
TURNABOUT: Would you believe that NBC, once the cutting-edge network, now is 
third behind ABC and CBS in drawing the pivotal young audience of men between 
18 and 49? 
</P>
<P>
BEING THERE: "I know how to do anything -- I'm a mom." Roseanne Barr in 
"Roseanne."

Say good night, Gracie. . . .

<LEADPARA>  NO MATTER how hard it tried, CBS never could make a TV star out of Michael
Keaton. So he went out and became one of the biggest stars in the movies
instead.;    Believe it or not, CBS tried five times to make Keaton a TV star
and blew it every time.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  SOME OF OUR BIGGEST STARS TURNED TV FAILURE
TO FILM SUCCESS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Television  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     They put him in the 1977 sitcom "All's Fair," with Richard Crenna and
Bernadette Peters, but it died young. Then CBS featured him in "Mary," the
flop 1978 comedy-variety series built around Mary Tyler Moore. He stayed on
when it turned into a 1979 sitcom hybrid called "The Mary Tyler Moore Hour,"
which also bombed. Still, CBS had faith and co-starred Keaton with Jim Belushi
in "Working Stiffs," a 1979 sitcom that barely lasted a month.;    Finally,
CBS gave Keaton one more shot as the star of his own sitcom, "Report to
Murphy," in which he played a young parole officer. It lasted about six weeks
in 1982 -- the same year he appeared in his first hit movie, "Night Shift,"
and learned his personal yellow brick road led to the big screen.;   
Ironically, "Night Shift" was made by a big TV star (Ron Howard), who was
trying, successfully, to become a big movie director, and starred a big TV
name, Henry "Fonzie" Winkler of "Happy Days," who was trying, unsuccessfully,
to become a big movie star.;    Further irony: "Night Shift" also featured
then unknown Shelley Long, whose "Cheers" went on the air later that year and
made her into a big TV star. She has been trying ever since to do what Keaton
has done with mega-hits like "Batman" and "Beetlejuice": make it really big in
movies.;    Most movie fans know that most of today's big movie stars were TV
stars first -- from Clint Eastwood ("Rawhide") to Bruce Willis
("Moonlighting"), from Goldie Hawn ("Laugh-In") to Robin Williams ("Mork &amp;
Mindy").;    But the truth is, TV has many Michael Keaton stories to hush up.
He wasn't the first actor whose career was bungled by TV star-makers. He won't
be the last.;    Here are 10 other examples that shouldn't fill the networks
with pride:;    1. Kim Basinger. Keaton's "Batman" co-star is one of the
screen's reigning sex queens, but she never made it big in TV. ABC gave her a
series lead in 1977 as a rookie cop in "Dog and Cat." It lasted just three
months. NBC tried next, casting her in the 1979-80 TV series version of "From
Here to Eternity." The same role won Donna Reed an Oscar in the 1953 movie. It
did nothing for Basinger, who needed showy roles in big-screen films such as
"Never Say Never Again," "Nadine" and "No Mercy" to become a really big star.;
   2. Patrick Swayze. During two months in early 1983, Swayze, the star of
last year's box-office sensation "Ghost," was the star of ABC's weekly series
"Renegades," playing the leader of a street gang who helped fight crime.
Nobody noticed. ABC tried again, featuring Swayze in its two 12-hour "North
and South" miniseries in 1985-86, but Swayze stayed unknown until he
quick-stepped to movie stardom in "Dirty Dancing" (1987). ABC quickly replayed
the miniseries and took credit for making him a star. We know better, don't
we?;    3. Michelle Pfeiffer. The Oscar-nominated star of "The Fabulous Baker
Boys" is one of today's most respected movie actors, but she was just window
decoration in ABC's 1979 sitcom "Delta House," playing a character called "the
bombshell." A year later, ABC was still pushing her looks in the short-lived
crime series, "B.A.D. Cats." When Pfeiffer turned to the movies, meaty roles
in "Scarface," "The Witches of Eastwick" and "The Russia House" proved she was
more than a pretty face.;    4. Debra Winger. Would you believe the star of
"Terms of Endearment," "An Officer and A Gentleman" and last year's "The
Sheltering Sky" once played Lynda Carter's sister, Drusilla, the Wonder Girl,
on ABC's "Wonder Woman"? That's about all TV had to offer her, so she left for
the big screen.;    5. Melanie Griffith. It may be hard to imagine anyone from
the cast of ABC's "Carter Country" earning an Oscar nomination, but Griffith
did for 1989's "Working Girl," moving into the front ranks of movie stars. She
was cub reporter Tracy Quinn in the 1978-79 season of "Carter Country," but
probably would prefer not to remember that "big break.";    6. Alec Baldwin.
The star of "Marrying Man," "Miami Blues" and "The Hunt for Red October" was
given the big buildup at CBS in 1983 as a young doctor in "Cutter to Houston."
Surely you remember that one? CBS dipped him briefly into "Knots Landing" the
next year, but Baldwin finally escaped to the movies.;    7. Richard Dreyfuss.
The star of the current "What About Bob?" has been a movie star so long that
most of us can't remember him in NBC's 1964-65 flop, "Karen." But it was ABC
that blew his real bid for TV stardom: He played the lead role of Capt.
Yossarian in the pilot for a TV version of "Catch-22," but ABC didn't like it
and decided against a series. That was cool with him. He made his first big
movie hit, "American Graffiti," that year and went on to blockbusters like
"Jaws" and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and won an Oscar for "The
Goodbye Girl" (1977).;    8. Richard Gere. The star of "An Officer and a
Gentleman" and last year's bonanza, "Pretty Woman," had a chance to go big in
TV when he starred as State Police Trooper Walter Spenser in "Strike Force,"
the 1975 pilot for a weekly series. NBC decided against the series; so Gere
had no choice but to become a movie star.;    9. Geena Davis. NBC really
wanted to make Davis a star but couldn't get anybody to watch her in 1983's
"Buffalo Bill" or her own short-lived 1985 series, "Sara." The movies were
more rewarding, starting with her first big hit, "The Fly" (1986), followed by
her Oscar-winning role in "The Accidental Tourist" (1988) and her current
movie, "Thelma &amp; Louise.";    10. Meg Ryan. The star of "When Harry Met Sally"
and "Joe vs. the Volcano" went unnoticed as Dana Carvey's girlfriend in NBC's
Mickey Rooney sitcom "One of the Boys" (1982). ABC did worse, losing her in
the cast of an awful 1985 western called "Wildside." So she headed for the big
screen.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Fox Broadcasting Co. takes dead aim this fall at
NBC's Thursday night dominance, pitting America's most alienated TV
family, ``The Simpsons,'' against the blithe Huxtables of ``The
Cosby Show.''
   ``We believe you have to take risks,'' Peter Chernin, Fox's
entertainment chief, told advertisers Tuesday in previewing the
fall lineup. ``We don't think you can play it safe any longer in
the current network environment.''
   CBS unveiled nine new series after three straight third-place
seasons in prime time. Two are hourlong action dramas, ``The
Flash,'' about the superfast crimefighter from the comic pages, and
network TV's first environmental action show, ``The Green
Machine,'' in which the heroes fight polluters.
   Chernin announced nine new series in Fox's move from three to
five nights of prime-time programming. To make room, Fox cut its
original series, ``21 Jump Street,'' as well as ``Alien Nation,''
``Booker'' and ``The Outsiders.''
   ``The Simpsons'' will take on ratings giant ``Cosby'' on
Thursday night, followed by ``Babes,'' a sitcom about three large
sisters who share a cramped New York apartment and Zip Code dress
sizes.
   Then, at 9 p.m. Eastern time, Fox goes for the younger viewer
with ``Class of Beverly Hills,'' the story of Midwestern teen-age
twins who confront the issues of growing up in the surreal, monied
ambience of Beverly Hills High.
   CBS Entertainment chief Jeff Sagansky, announcing his first full
schedule since he was hired last fall, overhauled all nights except
Tuesday and Sunday, giving the network four nights of comedies.
   CBS' roster includes five new hourlong series; four new sitcoms
and a comedy once on NBC, ``The Hogan Family.'' It also has a movie
package of such hits as ``Born on the Fourth of July'' and ``Do The
Right Thing.''
   Low-rated ``Saturday Night With Connie Chung'' moves to Mondays
as ``Face to Face With Connie Chung,'' but CBS dropped the Vietnam
War series ``Tour of Duty,'' ``Falcon Crest,'' ``The Famous Teddy
Z,'' ``City'' and ``Sydney.''
   Sagansky said the Western ``Paradise'' may be renewed.
``Wiseguy'' is in backup status, he added. Ken Wahl would return in
the first few episodes, then be succeeded by Stephen Bauer as a new
undercover agent.
   CBS' new sitcoms are the movie spinoff ``Uncle Buck,'' the
blue-collar ``Lenny,'' ``Four Alarm Family,'' about a widowed
firefighter with four kids, and ``Evening Shade,'' starring Burt
Reynolds as an ex-football star who moves his family back to the
small Arkansas town of his boyhood.
   Edward Woodward of CBS' late ``The Equalizer'' will return in
the hourlong ``Over My Dead Body'' as a crime novelist paired with
a young obituary writer.
   CBS' other new hourlong entries are ``WIOU,'' a drama about the
cutthroat world of local TV starring John Shea, and ``The
Hammersmiths,'' a drama with Lucie Arnaz about three generations of
a family.
   Fox offers ``American Chronicles,'' a half-hour documentary
series by Mark Frost and David Lynch, creators of ``Twin Peaks,''
and an hour series of various video projects, ``Fox Video Hour.''
   Fox's other new hour show is ``D.E.A.,'' which mixes documentary
and drama about the exploits of the Drug Enforcement Administration.
   On Monday's ``Fox Night at the Movies'' the fourth network will
combine theatrical and made-for-TV movies aimed at younger viewers.
   ``We think we're in a real real dogfight out there,'' Chernin
said. ``We think we're in competition not only with the other
netwroks, but also with cable, VCRs, Nintendos and every other
leisure time activity. We've got to go out there and kick and
scream to get viewers.''
   Fox will anchor its Sunday schedule with ``True Colors,'' a
sitcom about interracial marriage that Chernin called ``Fox's
answer to `The Brady Bunch.''' It stars Nancy Walker as an acerbic
mother-in-law.
   It will be followed by ``Parker Lewis Can't Lose,'' high school
adventures with Dobie Gillis and Ferris Bueller overtones; the
sketch comedy of ``In Living Color;'' comedian Chris Elliott in
``Get a Life'' as a 30-year-old newsboy; the miserable Bundy family
of ``Married ... with Children,'' and ``Good Grief,'' about two
brothers-in-law who operate the family mortuary.
   Fox will close Sunday night with ``Against the Law,'' a
courtroom drama starring Michael O'Keefe as ``television's first
gonzo, rock 'n' roll lawyer,'' Chernin said.
   Fox has 129 affiliates, compared with more than 200 each for
CBS, NBC and ABC, but isn't considered a network by the Federal
Communications Commission.
   It is expanding this fall under a one-year FCC waiver that lets
it broadcast 18{ hours a week of prime-time programming without
being subject to restrictions that bar CBS, NBC and ABC from the
lucrative syndication business.

<HEADLINE>  WHY DOES TV HAVE IT OUT FOR ITALIANS?  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Television  </MEMO>
<TEXT>   I WONDER what the Italians ever did to television. Because television has
certainly been taking its revenge on them ever since.;    This has been going
on so long that most viewers probably take it for granted. I did until I got a
call the other day from a reader who asked, "Why do they make Italians look so
bad on TV?";    I don't know, I told her. I guess they want to keep up with
the movies.;    Seriously, the complaint about the movies is that they make
all Italians look like mobsters. On television, they just make them look
stupid.;    Of course, TV makes almost everyone look stupid. I guess the
thinking is that we'll all feel better about ourselves if we watch people who
are dumber than we are.;    But television seems to go out of its way to make
that point when it comes to Italians.;    It's happening again with a summer
sitcom on ABC called "The Man in the Family" (9:30 Wednesdays, Chs. 7, 11,
13), not to be confused with the equally dumb but non-ethnic "Family Man" on
CBS.;    If you haven't had the misfortune of running across "The Man in the
Family" yet, all you've missed is another raucous Italian family yelling at
each other and plodding through life.;    If you saw "The Fanelli Boys" or
"Top of the Heap" this season or dreck like "The Montefuscos" long ago, you've
seen "The Man in the Family.";    The drill here is that Dad dies before the
first commercial, and sonny boy (Ray Sharkey) comes back to run the family
deli and get bossed around by his mom and sister, when he isn't listening to
his dumber-than-dirt pals and their harebrained schemes.;    Sitcom Italian
women are always bossy. Sitcom Italian men are always loud and scheming. The
number of dimensions for either is usually two.;    Now, Italians aren't the
only cardboard characters on TV, but there are probably more cardboard Italian
families on the tube than there are of any other ethnicity.;    I'm not sure
why, but an Italian friend is probably right when he points out that there's
no Italian B'nai B'rith or NAACP. What organized protests there have been were
usually focused on the recurring mob stereotypes.;    It is easier,
apparently, to construct a realistic yet humorous view of Italian-American
home life in a one-shot movie such as "Moonstruck" than in a continuing TV
series. I say that because the former has been successfully done, and the
latter hasn't.;    Oh, sure, there have been good Italian characters on TV.;  
 Columbo was one of them, even if he was played by Peter Falk, who is Jewish.;
   "Petrocelli" was about an Italian lawyer so good even Archie Bunker, whose
legal preference was for folks named Cohen, might have felt he was in good
hands, though he would have mispronounced the barrister's name.;    Vinnie
Terranova on "Wiseguy" was another multi-dimensional character who happened to
be Italian. So were Robert Blake's "Baretta" and Tony Musante's "Toma.";   
Back in the '70s, Vincent Gardenia's Frank Lorenzo on "All in the Family" and
Richard Castellano's Joe Girelli on "The Super" were two fellows who made you
laugh without making you cringe, no matter what your ethnicity.;    On the
other hand, Castellano's "Joe and Sons" a few years later was hideous in its
stereotypic portrayals, despite his best efforts.;    Sometimes even
stereotypes can seem funny instead of offensive, if well done. The Italian
friend I mentioned earlier cracks up at the mere mention of Mr. Bacciagalupe,
who was as stereotypic an Italian vegetable vendor as you could imagine, on
the "Abbott and Costello Show" in the early '50s.;    "You were just assaulted
by Mr. Bacciagalupe," my friend recalls. "He was so funny you couldn't be
offended, because you were paralyzed with laughter.";    My pal hasn't been
laughing much lately at people with names like his on the tube. Paralyzed by
the stupidity of it all might be a better description for his reaction to "The
Man of the Family.";    Maybe next season, which coincides with the 500th
anniversary of one of Italy's most famous son's journey to the New World,
television might wise up and give us Italians we can laugh with, instead of
at.;    In the meantime, perhaps the best defense for all of us against sludge
like "The Man in the Family" is to change the channel.;    Or possibly to go
on vacation, which I'm doing at this very moment. See you in August.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   The late Fred Allen once described a radio
network executive as a man in charge of turning molehills into
mountains.
   In television, they do it in reverse.
   ``The Wizard of Oz'' is coming to television this fall as a
Saturday morning cartoon. ``Look Who's Talking'' will debut on the
small screen as ``Baby Talk,'' with Tony Danza providing the baby's
grown-up voice.
   Television apparently has no qualms about ripping off the film
industry. Heck, TV will even make an entire series from a song.
Remember ``Harper Valley PTA?'' Not the one on the radio sung by
Jeannie C. Riley. The one on NBC starring Barbara Eden.
   This cloning of sorts has been going on for at least a decade.
But this season the trend has reached new proportions as network
executives raid the big screen with a vengeance.
   There are nearly a dozen shows on the Big Three fall schedules
that come directly from film. This might lead a normal person to
assume these hybrids fare well with television audiences.
   They don't.
   Most of them fail, some of them embarrassingly. ``Tales of the
Gold Monkey,'' an unabashed rip-off of Indiana Jones, lasted one
season on ABC in 1982.
   That was nothing, however, compared to the rush by all three
networks to imitate the raunchy success of ``Animal House'' in 1979.
   CBS' ``Co-Ed Fever'' lasted one episode. NBC's ``Brothers and
Sisters'' ran for 2{ months. ``Delta House'' on ABC made it for
three months before getting the hook.
   The undisputed success story in this ever-growing genre of
television is ``M-A-S-H,'' whose finale was the most-watched
telecast in TV history. ``The Odd Couple'' was successful on ABC
and ran for five seasons, but nothing has ever come close to
duplicating the 11-year success of ``M-A-S-H.''
   If movies don't translate well into TV, why do network
executives continue to do it?
   Well, they say, television is a crap shoot, period. Might as
well try something already familiar to viewing audiences.
   Take CBS, for example. ``Bagdad Cafe,'' a spring series, has
been renewed for fall. ``Uncle Buck,'' taken from John Candy's
slapstick, gross comedy film, is a new fall show. ``Big'' is in the
spring line up. ``Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure'' will become
a Saturday morning kid show come September.
   ``Although the failure rate is very high,'' said Peter
Tortorici, senior vice president for CBS planning and scheduling,
``in the game that we play in network television, the failure rate
for everything is very high. Eighty to 90 percent of everything you
try doesn't work.''
   Other past CBS efforts have included ``House Calls'' (1979 to
1982), ``Private Benjamin'' (1981 to 1983), ``Seven Brides for
Seven Brothers'' (one season) and ``Bad News Bears'' (two seasons).
   At NBC this year, ``Working Girl'' was fired, although it will
play through the summer. Last year's ``Baby Boom,'' starring Kate
Jackson in Diane Keaton's film role, likewise didn't pass probation
and was canceled. In 1981, ``Walking Tall,'' starring Bo Svenson as
Sheriff Buford Pusser, lasted six months.
   ``They don't succeed for the same reasons that other shows
don't,'' said NBC senior vice president of series, Perry Simon.
``Either the writing isn't good or the chemistry between the
characters isn't enough.''
   ``The trick to this,'' Simon said, ``is to be able to
distinguish between a feature film and how it will translate into a
television series.''
   Meaning the movie must provide enough fodder for a weekly show.
And the actors, who often must fill the shoes of box-office stars,
must be able to make the role their own.
   Currently, NBC has just about the only successful
film-turned-television series. ``In the Heat of the Night,''
starring Carroll O'Connor and Howard Rollins in the roles created
by Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier, has become a sure bet for the
peacock network.
   ABC has not been fond of turning films into TV shows, said Stu
Bloomberg, executive vice president for primetime.
   ``I've actually shied away from them,'' Bloomberg said. ``This
is the first year that we're doing them.''
   Well, not really. ABC did ``Delta House,'' remember? And
``Breaking Away'' in 1980 and ``9 to 5'' in 1982, all of them
ratings losers.
   ABC has ``Baby Talk'' in the fall. On the spring schedule for
next year is ``True Believer,'' starring Treat Williams in the role
played on the big screen by James Woods.
   ``The feature (film) makes such an impression, it's hard to get
people to star'' in a television version, Bloomberg said. ``No one
wants to be the television Tom Hanks.''
   Hank's role in ``Big,'' by the way, has yet to be cast by CBS.

<HEAD>`Brady Christmas' Gives CBS Second Place</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS got a ``A Very Brady Christmas'' gift when
the reunion movie featuring the 1970s sitcom family was No. 2 in the
A.C. Nielsen Co. television ratings, giving CBS its first week out
of third place this season.
   NBC firmly won the week anyway, and ``The Cosby Show'' was the
No. 1 show last week.
   As of Saturday, CBS was still in third place in the Nielsens, but
Sunday's ``A Very Brady Christmas'' was the highest-rated
made-for-TV movie so far this season, with a rating of 25.1 and a 39
share, and boosted CBS into second place. The sitcom ``The Brady
Bunch'' ran on ABC from 1969-1974 and has a cult following in reruns.
   ``The Cosby Show'' had a rating of 25.9 and a 42 share. The rest
of the top 10 were: ``A Different World,'' NBC; ``Cheers,'' NBC;
``Roseanne,'' ABC; ``Who's the Boss?'' ABC; ``Golden Girls,'' NBC;
``L.A. Law,'' NBC; ``Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS; and ``Dear John,''
NBC, tied with ``60 Minutes,'' CBS.
   Each rating point represents 904,000 homes with television. The
share is a percentage of sets in use.
   NBC won the week ending Dec. 18 with an average prime-time rating
of 15.4. CBS had a 13.1 and ABC an 11.8.
   ``ABC World News Tonight'' was the top-rated news show last week,
with an average rating of 11.0 and a 20 share. ``NBC Nightly News''
had a 10.9 and 20, edging the ``CBS Evening News,'' which had a 10.7
and 19.
   The only other new holiday movie last week, NBC's nostalgic
``I'll Be Home for Christmas,'' also did well, ranking 15th.
   CBS' ``Wiseguy'' came in 32nd, apparently getting a boost from
guest star Jerry Lewis, who will appear in a continuing storyline
for several episodes of the crime drama.
   NBC's constroverial episode of ``Midnight Caller,'' about a San
Francisco man with AIDS purposely engaging in high-risk sex, ranked
33rd, doing no worse or better than it has so far this season. AIDS
organizations and gay-rights groups had protested the episode,
saying it promoted antagonism against AIDS victims.
   ABC's touted exercise in kiddie glasnost, ``Free to Be a
Family,'' a joint U.S.-Soviet broadcast, ranked 58th.
   The lowest-rated network shows of the week were: ``Davy
Crockett,'' ``Mission Impossible,'' ``Moscow Circus,'' ``Annie
McGuire,'' ``West 57th,'' ``Simon &amp; Simon,'' ``TV101,'' ``Murphy's
Law,'' ``Knightwatch'' and ``Burning Issues.''

   CBS, trying to battle back from three seasons as
third in evening TV ratings, said Tuesday it will have nine new
series next fall. Fox Broadcasting said it'll go to a
five-night-a-week schedule.
   Fox also said it is moving the hit ``The Simpsons'' to head-on
Thursday competition with NBC's ``The Cosby Show.''
   And Fox's shows will air on Thursdays-through Mondays. It had
been expected to add Wednesdays and Fridays to its current
Saturday-through-Monday lineup.
   Fox, which also said it would air a new Sunday sitcom about an
interracial marriage called ``True Colors,'' announced nine new
series. To make room, it axed one of its original series, ``21 Jump
Street,'' and such others as ``Alien Nation,'' ``Booker,'' and
``The Outsiders.''
   CBS' new lineup, which includes a comic-book hero and an action
series whose heroes fight polluters, was described by CBS
Entertainment president Jeff Sagansky as a starting move in the
network's road to ratings recovery.
   ``This is a strong first step in the process of rebuilding our
prime time lineup,'' said Sagansky. The schedule, his first full
one since CBS hired him last fall, revamps all nights but Tuesday
and Sunday.
   It also gives CBS four nights of comedies.
   The goal, he told CBS affiliates in a closed-circuit hookup, is
to attract younger viewers and more family viewing in the 8 p.m.
EDT time period.
   Speaking with reporters here later, he discounted suggestions
that CBS' new schedule is not as unconventional as ABC's and CBS'.
   It's the way a show is done, not the idea for it, that makes it
succeed, he said: ``What makes a show unconventional is the way
it's executed, not cops singing or whatever is behind `Twin Peaks.'
''
   CBS' roster includes five new hour-long series; four new sitcoms
and a comedy once on NBC, ``The Hogan Family.'' It also has a
pre-cable movie package of such hits as ``Born on the Fourth of
July'' and ``Do The Right Thing.''
   The low-rated ``Saturday Night With Connie Chung'' will move to
Mondays with a different format and name _ ``Face to Face With
Connie Chung.'' Two test runs of the new version got high ratings
during the May ratings sweeps.
   But CBS axed the Vietnam War series ``Tour of Duty,'' the
venerable ``Falcon Crest,'' whose demise was announced last week,
and such far newer ones as ``The Famous Teddy Z,'' ``City'' and
``Sydney.''
   However, Sagansky said ``Paradise'' may be renewed. ``Wiseguy''
now is in backup status, he added, with Ken Wahl to return in the
first few episodes, then be succeeded by Stephen Bauer, who would
play a new undercover agent.
   CBS' new sitcoms are the movie spinoff ``Uncle Buck,'' the
blue-collar ``Lenny,'' ``Four Alarm Family,'' about a widowed
firefighter with four kids, and ``Evening Shade,'' starring Burt
Reynolds as an ex-football star who moves his family back to the
small Arkansas town of his boyhood.
   Edward Woodward of CBS' late ``The Equalizer'' will return in
the hour-long ``Over My Dead Body'' as a burnt-out novelist paired
with a young obituary writer played by Jessica Lundy.
   CBS' other new hour-long entries are ``The Flash,'' based on the
comic book crime-fighter; ``WIOU,'' about the cutthroat world of
local TV, and ``The Hammersmiths,'' a family drama with Lucie Arnaz.
   There also will be ``The Green Machine,'' the first network
drama in which the good guys battle those who would harm planet
Earth.
   In addition to ``True Colors,'' Fox's other sitcoms are ``Parker
Lewis Can't Lose,'' about high school life; ``Get a Life,''
starring Chris Elliott as a 30-year-old newspaper delivery boy;
``Good Grief,'' about undertaking; and ``Babes,'' about three
sisters in a cramped New York apartment.
   There also is a half-hour serious series, ``American
Chronicles,'' by Mark Frost and David Lynch, creators of ``Twin
Peaks,'' and an hour series of various video projects, ``Fox Video
Hour.''
   The other new hour-long series are ``Class of Beverly Hills,''
about a Midwestern family moving to Southern California;
``D.E.A.,'' about exploits of the Drug Enforcement Administration,
and ``Against the Law,'' about an unconventional trial lawyer.
   Fox also added a two-hour Monday movie night, ``Fox Night at the
Movies.''
   Fox says it has 129 affiliates, compared with the more than 200
each of CBS, NBC and ABC. But it isn't officially considered a
network yet by the Federal Communications Commission.
   Its expansion this fall was made possible by a one-year FCC
waiver that lets it broadcast 18{ hours a week of prime-time
programming without being subject to restrictions that bar CBS, NBC
and ABC from the lucrative syndication business.

<TEXT>  The Adventures of Mark; and Brian; NBC, Sundays, 7-7:30 p.m.; (star)(star);  
This show is built around real-life Los Angeles radio personalities Mark
Thompson and Brian Phelps, two "irrepressible" characters whose antics border
on the outrageous techniques of "shock radio." Each week they'll live out
their personal fantasies, such as becoming trapeze artists in a circus or
performing in concert with the Temptations. Previews this Monday and Thursday
nights at 8:30; premieres next Sunday.; Best of the Worst; Fox, Saturdays,
9:30-10 p.m.; (star) 1/2;   This "reality" show concentrates on real-life
stuff that's so bad it's funny -- or at least ought to be. Like the singing
career of William Shatner. Already premiered.; Brooklyn Bridge; CBS, Fridays,
8:30-9 p.m.; (Not available for preview);   Gary David Goldberg, creator of
"Family Ties," takes us back to Brooklyn, N.Y., circa 1956, for this nostalgic
situation comedy about an extended family at a time when an American era was
changing. Starring Marion ("Happy Days") Ross. Premieres Sept. 20 at 8 p.m.
with a special one-hour episode. Moves to its regular time slot Sept. 27.; The
Carol Burnett Show; CBS, Fridays, 9-10 p.m.; (Not available for preview);  
NBC didn't want Burnett's "Carol &amp; Co." half-hour show back this fall, despite
reasonable ratings; so Burnett was snapped up by CBS, which will offer her in
a new comedy/variety show with a new ensemble, hoping for a repeat of her
original success on the network a decade ago when her hour was one of TV's
most popular. Premieres in October.; The Commish; ABC, Saturdays, 10-11 p.m.;
(star)(star);   Michael Chiklis, who played the late John Belushi in the movie
"Wired," is big-city police commissioner Tony Scali, a rough-edged but likable
human dumpling who sings operatic solos while shaving. Naturally, he has a
warmly human "hands-on" approach to police work. Theresa Saldana co-stars as
Tony's wife, Rachel, in this character-oriented, action drama from Stephen J.
Cannell ("Hunter," "Wiseguy"). Premieres Saturday, Sept. 28, at 9 p.m. with a
two-hour episode, then moves to its 10 o'clock slot Oct. 5.; Drexell's Class;
Fox, Thursdays, 8:30-9 p.m.; (Not available for preview);   Call it
"Kindergarten Cop: The Next Generation." Dabney Coleman, the guy you loved to
hate in "Buffalo Bill" and "The 'Slap' Maxwell Story," returns as Otis
Drexell, who agrees to teach a fourth-grade class instead of going to prison
for tax evasion. Premieres Sept. 19.; Eerie, Indiana; NBC, Sundays, 7:30-8
p.m.; (star)(star)(star);   This fantasy series takes place in the weirdest
town in the United States -- yep, it's even weirder than Twin Peaks -- where
13-year-old Marshall Teller (Omri Katz) and sidekick Simon Holmes (Justin
Shenkarow) can't seem to convince their folks anything weird is going on.
Funny, bizarre and frequently directed by "consultant" Joe Dante ("Gremlins,"
"The Howling"). Premieres next Sunday.; FBI: The Untold Stories; ABC,
Thursdays, 9-9:30 p.m.; (star)(star);   Pernell Roberts ("Bonanza," "Trapper
John, M.D.") hosts and narrates this latest fact-based series drawn from FBI
files. News footage and even interviews with the real officers and criminal
suspects are supplemented with dramatic re-enactments. Premieres Sept. 26.;
Flesh 'n' Blood; NBC, Fridays, 9:30-10 p.m.; (star)(star)(star) 1/2;  
Baltimore D.A. Rachel Brennan (Lisa Darr) wants to locate the mom who gave her
up for adoption years ago but, instead, discovers the brother she didn't know
she had -- Arlo Weed (David Keith), a hillbilly con man, who brings along his
two kids and moves in with her. Wild and funny. Previews Thursday, Sept. 19,
at 10 p.m. Premieres Sept. 20.; Good and Evil; ABC, Wednesdays, 10:30-11 p.m.;
(star)(star);   If you notice familiar traces of "Soap" on this absurdist
sitcom, blame it on creator Susan Harris, who also dreamed up that legendary
1970s sitcom. Margaret Whitton is the "good" sister, a widow being courted by
a clumsy blind man as well as the two-timing boyfriend of her sexy "evil"
sister, Teri Garr, whose own husband, long believed dead, is thawing out after
four years in an ice crevasse. Goofy, mean-spirited, but frequently funny.
Premieres Sept. 25.; Homefront; ABC, Tuesdays, 10-11 p.m.; (star)(star)(star);
  Men returning from overseas duty in World War II try to resume their lives
in a small Ohio town in 1945 in this drama series that explores today's issues
through the perspective of yesterday. Featuring a large ensemble cast, mostly
newcomers. Not a soap opera, though it comes from David Jacobs, the creator of
"Dallas," and the current producers of "Knots Landing," Bernard Lechowick and
Lynn Marie Latham. Premieres Sept. 24 at 9:30 with a 90-minute episode, then
moves to its regular 10 o'clock berth Oct. 1.; Home Improvement; ABC,
Tuesdays, 8:30-9 p.m.; (star)(star)(star);   Stand-up comic Tim Allen brings
his "tool talk" and Robert Bly-style, pro-male routines to TV in the role of
Tim Taylor, host of a cable-TV do-it-yourself show along the lines of PBS's
"This Old House." Co-starring Patricia Richardson as wife Jill, who undermines
his status as America's "manly man" of the '90s. Premieres Sept. 17.; I'll Fly
Away; NBC, Tuesdays, 8-9 p.m.; (star)(star)(star) 1/2;   This one-hour drama
from the creators of "St. Elsewhere," "A Year in the Life" and "Northern
Exposure" takes place in the American South in the mid-1950s, just as the
civil rights era was beginning. Forrest Bedford (Sam Waterston) is a
principled lawyer, trying to raise his three kids in turbulent times with the
help of his troubled black housekeeper, Lilly Harper (Regina Taylor). Previews
Oct. 7 with a two-hour special and moves into its regular one-hour time slot
Oct. 8.; Herman's Head; Fox, Sundays, 9:30-10 p.m.; (star)(star)(star);  
William Ragsdale is Herman, an ambitious young man struggling to get ahead in
the corporate world. But this innovative sitcom also takes us inside his head,
which is peopled with imaginary characters. Premieres tonight.; Man of the
People; NBC, Sundays, 8-8:30 p.m.; (star)(star)(star);   James Garner shines
in his first sitcom, playing con artist Jim Doyle, who's appointed to fill out
his ex-wife's unexpired city council term and winds up serving the people
while trying to bilk the city. Co-starring Corinne Bohrer, Kate Mulgrew,
George Wyner. Very promising. Premieres next Sunday.; Nurses; NBC, Saturdays,
9:30-10 p.m.; (star)(star);   The prolific Susan Harris ("Soap," "Golden
Girls") wasn't content to create just ABC's "Good &amp; Evil" this season. She
also concocted this ensemble comedy about five nurses in a big-city hospital.
Lots of sarcasm, especially from perpetually P.O.-ed Stephanie Hodge as the
recently divorced nurse, Sandy. Premieres Saturday.; Pacific Station; NBC,
Sundays, 8:30-9 p.m.; (star)(star);   This low-brow "Barney Miller" is an
ensemble comedy in a police precinct in wacky Venice, Calif. It's anchored by
the skilled Robert Guillaume ("Benson"), who plays a veteran detective saddled
with a new partner (Richard Libertini) fresh from a psychiatric ward. Also
stars Ron Leibman ("Kaz") as a womanizing detective and Ken Epstein ("Grand")
as their incompetent captain. Marginal. Premieres next Sunday.; Palace Guard;
CBS, Fridays, 10-11 p.m.; (star) 1/2;   Master hotel thief Tommy Logan (D.W.
Moffett) is hired by hotel magnate Arturo Taft (Tony LoBianco) to be a
security adviser for the Palace hotel chain. But Tommy has to work with
public-relations woman Christy Cooper (Marcy Walker), a former B-movie queen.
Producer Stephen J. Cannell wants this to be fast and sexy, but it works like
"Moonlighting" on a night with no moon. Premieres in October.; Princesses;
CBS, Fridays, 8-8:30 p.m.; (star) 1/2;   Call it "Golden Girls: The Early
Years." Three single women -- dithery Julie Hagerty, sneery Fran Drescher and
hoity-toity ex-princess Twiggy Lawson -- mistakenly lay claim to the same
Manhattan apartment, then agree to share it and their comic adventures. From
Barry Kemp, creator of "Newhart" and "Coach." Not irresistible. Premieres
Sept. 27.; Pros and Cons; ABC, Thursdays, 8-9 p.m.; (Not available for
preview);   This is a heavily overhauled new edition of last year's "Gabriel's
Fire." Gabriel Bird (James Earl Jones) moves to L.A., where he teams up with
Mitch, a seedy private eye played by Richard Crenna. Landlady Josephine (Madge
Sinclair) also leaves Chicago to keep Bird company. The new show is expected
to be funnier, less dour. Premieres Sept. 26.; P.S. I Luv U; CBS, Saturdays,
10-11 p.m.; (star);   Producer Glen Larson has teamed Connie Sellecca (as a
beautiful con lady) with Greg Evigan (as a tough New York cop) in a ridiculous
action show about an unmarried couple forced to pose as husband and wife,
while they hide out from Mafia hit men in Palm Springs, where they work for
Palm Security Investigations (PSI). Just as awful as it sounds, maybe even
worse. Previews next Sunday at 9 as a two-hour movie; premieres Sept. 21.;
Reasonable Doubts; NBC, Fridays, 10-11 p.m.; (star)(star) 1/2;   Oscar-winner
Marlee Matlin ("Children of a Lesser God") becomes the first hearing-impaired
actor to star in a weekly TV series. She plays Tess Kaufman, a shrewd
assistant D.A., who's teamed with police detective Richard Brandt (Mark
Harmon) because he knows sign language. Their growing relationship offers the
only promise for an otherwise routine law-and-order melodrama. Previews
Thursday, Sept. 26, at 10. Premieres Sept. 27.; Roc; Fox, Sundays, 8:30-9
p.m.; (star)(star)(star);   Charles Dutton, star of Broadway's "The Piano
Lesson," plays garbage collector Roc Emerson in this promising series about a
black family. Already premiered.; Royal Family; CBS, Wednesdays, 8-8:30 p.m.;
(star)(star)(star);   This isn't about the Windsors of Buckingham Palace but a
black family in Atlanta. Redd Foxx is just-retired mailman Al Royal, and Della
Reese is his sarcastic wife, Victoria. They're trying to cope with their new
semi-permanent guests -- their husband-less daughter and her three young kids.
Some riotous rancor. Premieres Sept. 18.; Sibs; ABC, Wednesdays, 9:30-10 p.m.;
(Not available for preview);   Sibs is short for siblings, which, in this
case, means three sisters (Marsha Mason, Margaret Colin, Jami Gertz) whose
comic relationships form the story line for this ensemble piece from the
producers of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," "Taxi" and "The Simpsons." Also
starring Emmy-winner Alex Rocco ("The Famous Teddy Z"). Previews Tuesday,
Sept. 17, at 9:30; premieres Sept. 25.; Step by Step; ABC, Fridays, 8:30-9
p.m.; (star)(star)(star);   This unlikely sitcom pairs comic actress Suzanne
Somers ("Three's Company") with Patrick Duffy ("Dallas"), who's trying his
first sitcom role. They're newlyweds whose kids from their earlier marriages
don't get along at all. Surprisingly likable. Premieres Sept. 20.; Teech; CBS,
Wednesdays, 8:30-9 p.m.; (star);   Ugandan comic Phill Lewis stars as the
music teacher who leaves rough South Philly for a job teaching obnoxious white
boys in a private boarding school. Lots of obnoxiousness but few laughs.
Premieres Sept. 18.; The Torkelsons; NBC, Saturdays, 8:30-9 p.m.;
(star)(star)(star)(star);   This could be the season's most pleasant surprise:
a sitcom about a poor Oklahoma family held together by a hard-working,
eccentric mom (Connie Ray) and viewed from the perspective of a dreamy
14-year-old (Olivia Burnette), who may be the season's brightest new star.
Utterly charming. Premieres Sept. 21.; The Ultimate Challenge; Fox, Fridays,
9-10 p.m.; (Not available for preview);   Mike Adamle and Heather Thomas are
the co-hosts of this stunt-oriented "reality" show, which promises to be a
bastard child of "That's Incredible!" It's just the thing for those who can't
wait to see somebody bungee-jump off the Empire State Building. Premieres
Friday night. (box)  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Rapper, `Spy' Magazine Series Potential New Shows for NBC</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NBC, heading for its fifth consecutive season as
first in the prime-time ratings, is considering a new comedy series
featuring rap singer Fresh Prince and a show based on the satirical
magazine Spy.
   ``We're number one and we intend to stay there,'' NBC
Entertainment president Brandon Tartikoff said Thursday.
   The fall schedules for NBC and its rivals won't be set and
announced until May, but Tartikoff unveiled his development roster
to whip up advertisers' enthusiasm for potential projects.
   CBS and ABC held similar sessions Wednesday.
   NBC's list of prime-time hopefuls, some of which will get a
spring and summer tryout, include a Quincy Jones comedy series with
the rap-music star, a comedy based on the ``Archie'' comic strip
and a new version of the gothic soap opera ``Dark Shadows.''
   Also on the list of prospects are two comedy specials. One,
``The Jackie Bison Show,'' would be a cartoon spoof of show
business and star the first bison ever to host its own TV show.
   The other, a TV version of the satirical magazine Spy, will get
its first on-air shot April 18. The theme will be ``How to Be
Famous.''
   Tartikoff, who spoke to advertising representatives at NBC
offices in Burbank, told reporters afterward he thought that two of
NBC's top money-earners, Bill Cosby and Johnny Carson, would be
back next season.
   The Burbank meeting was shown at NBC offices in New York on a
closed-circuit line.
   NBC is renegotiating a contract that would return the hit ``The
Cosby Show'' for a seventh season, Tartikoff said. He didn't
elaborate on what the renegotiations involved.
   Talks also are under way with Carson, host of the ``Tonight''
show since October 1962. ``We fully expect that Johnny will be
back,'' Tartikoff said.
   NBC, which earlier renewed ``Dear John,'' said it was renewing
five other series _ ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' ``Empty Nest,''
``Midnight Caller,'' ``Quantum Leap'' and ``In the Heat of the
Night.''
   In earlier presentations in Los Angeles, third-place CBS said it
had 23 series pilots under consideration, while ABC's roster of
hopefuls showed 13 comedies, 15 hourlong dramas and two half-hour
dramas.
   Under consideration at NBC are 13 dramas, 17 comedies and nine
miniseries.
   The CBS comedy pilots include ``Sunday Dinner'' from producer
Norman Lear, whose sometimes controversial sitcoms were mainstays
of CBS in the 1970s, and ``Steel Magnolias,'' a small-screen
version of the hit movie of the same name.
   ABC's possible series include Stephen Bochco's one-hour ``Cop
Rock,'' which juxtaposes music and crime-fighting, and a sitcom,
``Dr. Ruth's House,'' starring the veteran dispenser of sex advice,
Dr. Ruth Westheimer.

<MEMO>  Television  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The NBC news president mentioned her last name not once, but twice while
being interviewed by Ted Koppel on the ABC show, which began with one of that
network's vice presidents explaining why its policies prohibited revealing the
name.;    All of which allowed "NBC Nightly News" executive producer Steve
Friedman to go on a New York radio show the next day and say his network
wasn't the only one giving the woman's name -- ABC had done it on "Nightline,"
too.;    He didn't say, of course, that the reason you heard her name on ABC
was that his boss had uttered it.;    Why didn't he say that? No one asked
him.;    Sure, Steve. No one asked the woman if they could use her name,
either, and that's the whole point.;    Interesting, isn't it, that in this
whole debate, none of the voices we hear coming from the networks are women.; 
  The reporter on the original NBC story was Lisa Myers, but she wouldn't say
how she felt about it in a phone call to her the day after the piece ran.;   
HERE'S THE LAW -- Yes, yes, "L.A. Law" will be back with a new episode next
week. The resurrection of Rosalind was just a two-week thing necessitated by
trying to stretch the 22 original episodes into the Nielsen sweeps in May,
which, because of Memorial Day, start April 25.;    The sweeps end May 22,
which is why the last "L.A. Law" of the season is set for May 16.;   
Stretching for sweeps is also why so many other shows have been in reruns the
last couple weeks as well. Now you know.;    HERE'S THE BOSS -- Do you also
know what the longest-running entertainment show on ABC is? No, not "Twin
Peaks," whose many appearances and re-appearances only make it seem like it's
been on forever.;    Actually, the correct answer is "Who's the Boss?," which
has just been renewed for an eighth season. The only comedy around longer is
"Cheers," which will come back for a 10th season on NBC next fall. With the
cancellation of "Dallas," the only drama with a longer run will be CBS's
"Knots Landing.";    It also means that "Who's the Boss?" will make it at
least twice as long on the same network as Tony Danza's first show, the
infinitely better "Taxi.";    Maybe that's why ABC's slogan (or any of the
other network's) has never been, "Quality is Job One.";    ANOTHER ONE BITES
THE DUST -- The quality of CBS News continues to drop with the ham-fisted cuts
going on.;    Joan Snyder, the first female field producer in CBS history, got
the ax as part of the ongoing layoffs that will hit about 120 staffers across
the ever-shrinking news department.;    She is now a producer for "Sunday
Morning," but in her 30 years at the network, she wrote for such luminaries as
Walter Cronkite, Mike Wallace and Harry Reasoner, in addition to paving the
way for the women who followed her by becoming a producer in 1967.;    The way
things are going at the networks these days, better to be an inexperienced
rookie with a puny paycheck than someone who actually knows what he or she is
doing and is paid accordingly.;    LOCAL STUFF -- You may have noticed KRON
(Ch. 4) has new graphics and a new logo in a bright red circle. I guess Red
Ball Movers wasn't using theirs any more. . . .;    KOFY (Ch. 20) has started
simulcasting in Spanish, carrying "Little House on the Prairie," "The A-Team,"
"Bonanza" and "Small Wonder" in two languages.;    Only those who have a
stereo TV can get the shows in Spanish, however, by pushing the secondary
audio programming button. . . .;    For those of you in a buying mood, the
KTEH (Ch. 54) auction got under way Friday and will run through next
Saturday.;    Somewhere in the neighborhood of $850,000 worth of goodies has
been donated by local merchants and individuals. The money raised accounts for
nearly 10 percent of the station's operating budget.;    Last year's auction,
which brought in $368,000, was the 12th largest in the public broadcasting
system and won PBS's National Auction Achievement Award. Station officials say
the goal this year is $425,000.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>ABC's `Roseanne' Eases NBC's `Cheers' Out of First Place</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   ABC's ``Roseanne'' took first place last week
in the Nielsen ratings, switching places with NBC's ``Cheers'' in
their summer seesaw rivalry as sitcoms dominated prime-time viewing.
   Eighteen of the 20 highest rated shows were comedies. The only
non-comedies were the movie pilot for NBC's ``Baywatch,'' tied for
seventh, and the CBS movie ``Tricks of the Trade,'' in 12th place.
   Roseanne Barr's sitcom in which she and John Goodman play a
working class couple was the success story of this past season.
Another working class couple, Al and Peg Bundy of Fox Broadcasting's
``Married...With Children,'' also have done well this summer.
   That show, which stars Ed O'Neill and Katey Sagal, finished ahead
of all network competition this past Sunday, and tied for 17th place
with NBC's ``Empty Nest.'' Its 13.4 rating is the highest ever for a
Fox show.
   The Fox show and ABC's ``20-20'' were the only original
productions in the top 30 for last week.
   NBC was first in the A.C. Nielsen Co. survey for the 62nd
consecutive week with an average rating of 11.4. ABC had 9.7 and CBS
9.6.
   NBC was first for the season to date from Sept. 19, with 14.5, to
ABC's 11.7 and CBS' 11.6.
   Each rating point is the percentage of the estimated 90.4 million
homes with televisions in the United States.
   This summer, Fox made its first ratings breakthrough after a long
period at the bottom of the ratings. Shows such as ``Married...With
Children,'' ``America's Most Wanted'' and ``Totally Hidden Video''
have all climbed out of the cellar.
   Fox's ``Open House,'' a new version of ``Duet,'' made its debut
last week in 47th place, ahead of the second part of the ABC Sunday
movie, ``The Gladiator.''
   Here are last week's top 10: ABC's ``Roseanne,'' NBC's
``Cheers,'' NBC's ``A Different World,'' NBC's ``The Cosby Show''
and ``Dear John'' tied, ABC's ``The Wonder Years,'' NBC's
``Baywatch: Panic at Malibu'' and ABC's ``Who's the Boss?'' tied,
ABC's ``Mr. Belvedere,'' NBC's ``Night Court.''
   CBS had only three shows in the first 20: ``Tricks of the
Trade,'' ``Designing Women'' 13th and ``Murphy Brown'' 14th.
   The NBC summer comedy ``FM'' dropped from its fifth place
premiere to 37th for a tie with CBS' ``Newhart.''
   NBC's occasional magazine show, ``Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow,''
was 32nd. ABC's weekly ``PrimeTime Live'' was 46th.
   ``The CBS Evening News'' was first among the evening news shows
with a rating of 9.7. ABC had an 8.5 and NBC 8.0.

<LEADPARA>  WHEN ABC's "Happy Days" began its phenomenally successful run on the network
in 1974, you had to be extra alert to catch a glimpse of Henry Winkler as a
greasy biker named Arthur Fonzarelli.;    But by the time "Happy Days" went
off the air 10 years later, Winkler was the unquestioned star of the show, and
"The Fonz" was such a part of Americana that his leather jacket was presented
to the Smithsonian Institution.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  SECOND BANANA REPUBLIC
SUPPORTING ACTORS CAN TAKE OVER THE SHOWS
THEY SUPPORT. HERE ARE 10 OF THE BEST.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Winkler's Fonzie remains a classic example of a supporting character
becoming so crucial to the popularity of a TV show that it was no longer
possible to imagine the show without him.;    Of course, second bananas rarely
"come forward" to take over a show, but it does happen. As a matter of fact,
it happened in 1988, when Jasmine Guy's spoiled Southern student, Whitley
Gilbert, suddenly came forward in the premiere season of NBC's "A Different
World" to obscure Lisa Bonet, who was supposed to be the star of her own
series when her Denise Huxtable character was spun off from NBC's "The Cosby
Show.";    By the second season, Bonet had left the show to have a baby and
eventually took Denise back to "The Cosby Show." Guy's Whitley character, now
much more likable and considerably less spoiled, remains the primary focus of
"A Different World.";    A similar phenomenon now seems to be taking place on
ABC's "Family Matters," where nerdy neighbor Steve Urkel, played by
trumpet-voiced 14-year-old Jaleel White, has come forward to take the
spotlight away from all the original cast members after a one-time guest
appearance last season blossomed into a regular role.;    Most of the time,
though, supporting characters know their place in a series and stay there. But
TV's most skillful second bananas can make those secondary characters so
essential to the overall appeal of a show that they become indispensable, the
way Ken Osmond's Eddie Haskell was in "Leave It to Beaver" or Bob Denver's
Maynard G. Krebs was in "The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis.";    Here's my
personal list of the 10 best second bananas now working in network shows,
playing characters I can't imagine their shows doing without:;    (box)
Katherine Helmond's Mona Robinson in ABC's "Who's the Boss?";    Helmond's
Mona is surely TV's most mischievous mother, a libidinous lady who's not only
always ready for a good time, but also seems to be having one playing this
sexy scamp.;    (box) Estelle Getty's Sophia Petrillo in NBC's "The Golden
Girls.";    Getty was little known to the TV audience when she started playing
Bea Arthur's tactless live-in mom and second banana to three established TV
stars -- Arthur, Rue McClanahan and Betty White -- five seasons ago. Now; For
page 8C; Getty has an Emmy and a host of fans who think she steals the show
from her famous co-stars.;    (box) Meshach Taylor's Anthony Bouvier in CBS's
"Designing Women.";    Stealing scenes from four stars as polished as Dixie
Carter, Delta Burke, Annie Potts and Jean Smart isn't easy for a minor
character who began way in the background, but that's what Taylor does each
week as the kind-hearted, colorful ex-con. Originally just a delivery man
intended as a one-laugh walk-on each week, Anthony is now a partner in the
women's design studio, surely a tribute to Taylor's growing value to this hit
show.;    (box) Jerry Van Dyke's Luther Van Dam in ABC's "Coach.";    People
now can forget Van Dyke starred in what most critics consider the worst sitcom
in TV history: "My Mother, the Car." His lonely, dim-witted Luther, the
incompetent assistant coach, is a brilliant concept brilliantly played by this
long underrated comic actor.;    (box) Max Casella's Vinnie Delpino in ABC's
"Doogie Howser, M.D.";    Casella's inspired work as teen hustler Vinnie, best
pal to prodigy physician Doogie, is so good that it's easy to picture Vinnie
in a show of his own, scoring with "chicks" and setting up deals to make sure
he can afford them. His skill is even more obvious when you realize Casella is
a mature young man in his mid-20s, just pretending to be a 17-year-old.;   
(box) Robert Pastorelli's Eldin Bernecky in CBS's "Murphy Brown.";   
Conceived as little more than a running gag -- the house painter who can't
seem to finish the job -- Eldin has become a key regular on this hit show,
providing celebrity news star Murphy (Candice Bergen) a way to get in touch
with the real world each week. Pastorelli has turned Eldin into a refreshingly
direct, engagingly warm, blue-collar philosopher. Many think his bear-like
Eldin might be a good mate for Murphy, if she ever decides to try matrimony
again.;    (box) David Leisure's Charley and Park Overall's LaVerne in NBC's
"Empty Nest.";    When this sitcom began three seasons ago, most of the
attention went to star Richard Mulligan and the actresses cast as his two
daughters, Kristy McNichol and Dinah Manoff. But Leisure, the former "Joe
Izuzu" of TV commercials, and newcomer Overall quickly elbowed their way into
the front row with fans. Leisure's sleazy Charley, the neighbor who spends
more time in your refrigerator than his own, and Overall's quick-witted,
Southern-fried nurse LaVerne are people "Empty Nest" can't do without.;   
(box) Laurie Metcalf's Jackie Harris in ABC's "Roseanne.";    Metcalf's
Jackie, unmarried sister to Roseanne Conner (Roseanne Barr), is a rare sitcom
creation: A well-rounded character who's shown us her wretched, forlorn side
as often as her fractiously funny side. Metcalf's crisp comedy timing and her
skill at conveying Jackie's vulnerability help give this show the bite that
lifts it above the ordinary.;    (box) Beverly Archer's Alva "Gunny" Bricker
on CBS's "Major Dad.";    Archer's deadpan delivery and de-sexed military look
as Gunnery Sgt. Bricker help make her the best anti-femme TV character since
Nancy Kulp's classic Jane Hathaway in "The Beverly Hillbillies." Funny thing
is, "Gunny" turns into a bunny when she's out on a date, and the talented
Archer revels in throwing us that occasional change-up.  </TEXT>

RICK DU BROW: A DRY, TRITE SEASON THREATENS NETWORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The good news is that Vincent is back. When CBS announced Thursday that the 
noble man-creature would return Dec. 12 in "Beauty and the Beast," thousands of 
viewers who wrote the network protesting the dropping of the show from the fall 
schedule must have felt a satisfying surge of power. 
</P>
<P>
Any network that offers Candice Bergen in "Murphy Brown" and Ron Perlman as the 
literate, romantic "beast" named Vincent can't be all bad. 
</P>
<P>
But then there is the bad news. The Mad Hatter seems to be taking part in 
program decisions at CBS, and maybe all of the Big Three networks should seek 
out a quiet weekend retreat where their executives can contemplate the nature 
of the universe, the meaning of it all and whether they'd like to stay in 
business. It's not certain anymore, you know, in the new world of TV 
alternatives, especially after disasters like this fall's network season. 
</P>
<P>
Back to CBS. There was no surprise in Thursday's cancellation of "Peaceable 
Kingdom," which stars Lindsay Wagner as a zoo director. It was stillborn and 
disappears Dec. 6. Nor was it shocking that another lemon, "Island Son," in 
which Richard Chamberlain plays a doctor, was yanked so that CBS could 
reschedule it. But now hear this: 
</P>
<P>
Just days ago, CBS gave "Wolf," a detective show with Jack Scalia, a 
full-season pickup. Yet suddenly, the network has put the show "on hiatus" -- 
it finished 79th in this week's ratings and drew only 9% of the national 
viewing audience. 
</P>
<P>
All right, anybody can make a mistake. But as this month's key ratings sweeps 
head for the finish line Nov. 29, the new TV season is adding up to one big 
mistake -- a succession of flops that seems to have long-range implications 
about the ability of the Big Three to hold their fast-declining audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Who would think, for instance, that top-ranked NBC, the 800-pound gorilla of 
network TV, would be running scared? Well, it certainly seems to be. NBC went 
0-for-5 in the ratings with its new series this fall, including the sitcoms 
"Sister Kate" and "The Nutt House." It's the worst start for new NBC series 
since 1983, when the network's freshman shows went 0-for-9. 
</P>
<P>
But the difference is that NBC was gambling back then, driving for the top. 
Consider how a flop like the Steven Bochco drama "Bay City Blues" now seems way 
ahead of its time with its baseball setting that's been turned to great success 
in motion pictures such as "Field of Dreams" and "Bull Durham." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, NBC played it safe this fall with its new series, which also 
included the cop shows "Hardball" and "Mancuso FBI" and the lifeguard tale 
"Baywatch." But why should the powerful No. 1 network run scared? Could it be 
because it knows its owner, General Electric, doesn't have the same tolerance 
for failure as its former parent company, RCA, and wouldn't hesitate to sell 
off the network if it slipped to the bottom of the ratings? 
</P>
<P>
But playing it safe is dangerous strategy for NBC. Some of the hits that have 
carried the network through the decade -- such as "Cheers" and "The Cosby Show" 
-- are aging, if still powerful. They won't be around forever, and the network 
has to develop other blockbusters to compete in the new era of TV. 
</P>
<P>
Winning against just CBS and ABC isn't where it's at anymore. The enemy now is 
VCRs, cable and independent stations, and in that sense NBC's all-powerful 
status may be more precarious than imagined. 
</P>
<P>
CBS is surely no threat to NBC or anybody, except itself. Once the proud king 
of the airwaves -- home of "All in the Family," "MASH," "The Mary Tyler Moore 
Show" and "I Love Lucy" -- CBS has a hard time doing things right these days. 
"Murphy Brown" has very nearly saved the network's reputation as a creative 
entity, and there are a few continuing hits such as "60 Minutes" and "Murder, 
She Wrote." But that's just about all she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
No new CBS series this season has really worked out as hoped. The network's big 
experiment -- six consecutive sitcoms on Monday, backed by enormous promotion 
-- has yielded disappointing ratings. The critical lead-off show, "Major Dad," 
could do no better than 36th place in the latest national rankings. Another 
touted new Monday sitcom, "The Famous Teddy Z," has failed to excite the 
nation. Even "Murphy Brown," the centerpiece of the six-sitcom lineup, has a 
struggle on its hands -- it came in 35th last week. 
</P>
<P>
Add to this the aging of CBS' one-time backbone -- soaps such as "Dallas" (40th 
last week) and "Falcon Crest" (54th). And add to that the fact that CBS 
traditionally has the grass-roots audience, but 45% of television's viewers now 
are concentrated in the 23 major urban markets as measured by the Nielsen 
ratings -- with Tampa, Fla., and Cincinnati joining the list a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
ABC, meanwhile, is an interesting case. Although second in the ratings, it 
seems more secure than first-place NBC -- possibly because it is the only 
network still owned by a broadcaster, Capital Cities Communications, and also 
because billionaire Warren Buffett has pledged his voting stock to the company, 
even if he should die. 
</P>
<P>
The sense of security may well be a subtle factor in ABC's notably unique 
series during the last few seasons -- by far the most original new shows on any 
network: "The Wonder Years," "thirtysomething," "China Beach," "Moonlighting," 
"Roseanne" and "Life Goes On." 
</P>
<P>
This season, ABC is within striking distance of NBC in the ratings. And if 
ABC's two planned prime-time series starring Oprah Winfrey and Dr. Ruth catch 
on, the network could make a real run for the top spot within several years. 
</P>
<P>
NBC, meanwhile, has series with Alan Alda and Carol Burnett in the works, and 
it definitely needs another breakout hit like "L.A. Law" or "The Golden Girls" 
to regenerate itself creatively. 
</P>
<P>
It's later than the networks think. A few more barren new seasons like the 
current one and the images that CBS, NBC and ABC built in TV's first 50 years 
will fade away and become irrelevant. That was then and this is now.

   ABC's ``The Women of Brewster Place'' starring
Oprah Winfrey outbattled ``Return of the Jedi'' and ``The Wizard of
Oz,'' but NBC extended its hold on No. 1 to 39 weeks, one week short
of the record.
   ``We've waited a long time for this week,'' Gerry Jaffe, NBC vice
president for research projects, said Tuesday as the network moved
ahead of its longest run at the top of the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings.
CBS set the record of 40-consecutive weeks 26 years ago.
   NBC's victory came even though ABC's ``Roseanne'' finished at the
top of the Nielsens, ahead of NBC's popular ``The Cosby Show.'' The
shows finished in the same order, one-two, the previous week.
   NBC won the week that ended Sunday with an average prime-time
rating of 15.4. ABC had 13.1 and CBS 12.7. NBC leads in the
season-to-date averages with a 16.1, to ABC's 12.9 and CBS' 12.6.
   The first installment of the miniseries ``Brewster Place''
finished third. It was broadcast Sunday, opposite ``The Wizard of
Oz'' on CBS and the first network showing of ``Jedi.'' ``The
Wizard'' finished in 14th place and ``Jedi,'' which was shown on
NBC, finished 31st.
   ``Roseanne,'' the sitcom starring Roseanne Barr, got a 38 share
to Bill Cosby's 39, but had a rating of 26.1 to Cosby's 24.2. Each
rating point represents 904,000 households with televisions. The
share is a percentage of sets in use.
   After ``Brewster Place,'' here is the rest of the top 10:
``Different World,'' NBC; ``Cheers,'' NBC; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS;
``Wonder Years,'' ABC; ``Golden Girls,'' NBC; ``Who's the Boss,''
ABC. The 10th spot was shared by NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' which
shot up from 22nd place, and ``Anything But Love,'' the ABC sitcom
starring Jamie Lee Curtis that debuted at No. 7 the previous week.
   In news ratings, CBS and ABC each finished with 10.4; NBC had a
9.6.

   ``Live-In'' star Chris Young is CBS's great young
hope to become a teen TV heartthrob like NBC's Jason Bateman of
``The Hogan Family'' and ABC's Kirk Cameron on ``Growing Pains.''
   CBS, in need of younger viewers, has two new family sitcoms
premiering Monday that are designed to lure them.
   ``Live-In'' just might entice teen-agers, if CBS can get them to
tune in to begin with. The network hasn't fared well in the
half-hour comedy area, and its kid-appeal, high-school drama ``TV
101'' has been passed over in the ratings.
   The new shows will move into the time periods vacated by
``Newhart'' and ``Kate &amp; Allie,'' which move to later in the night,
replacing ``Almost Grown,'' which is on hold.
   ``Live-In'' has two appealing young stars (Young and Lisa
Patrick), a likable sitcom family, sprightly writing and enough
daring to avoid yawn inducement in teens long jaded by sexually
exploitative films. It airs opposite NBC's kid-appeal hit ``ALF.''
   Preceding ``Live-In'' is ``Heartland,'' a farm family sitcom
that's kind of a ``Little `Roseanne' on the Prairie.'' It's opposite
``The Hogan Family.''
   CBS is hoping Young will have the same teen appeal as Bateman and
Cameron. He plays Danny, a typically girl-crazy kid who can't
believe his luck when his parents hire a charming Australian au pair
girl, Lisa (Patrick), to care for their infant daughter.
   Lisa trots around in crop tops and miniskirts, but expertly fends
off the advances of Danny and his obnoxious friend, Gator
(Lightfield Lewis), who shows up the morning after she has moved in
and sensitively queries Danny, ``So, d'ya boff her yet?'' To placate
those who aren't enchanted by simple-minded sex jokes, good sense
ultimately triumphs over the kids' rampant lust.
   Hugh Maguire plays good-natured dad, proprietor of a sporting
goods store. Kimberly Farr is Supermom, filled with angst at
returning to work and leaving her baby in the hands of a stranger.
``I'm all set,'' she declares. ``I've got my briefcase, my Wall
Street Journal, my breast pump.'' David Moscow is the suitably
baffled younger brother.
   Robert Sternin and Prudence Fraser created the series and wrote
the pilot, one of the better ones of the season.
   ``Heartland'' stars Brian Keith as curmudgeonly B.L. McCutcheon,
who lost his farm to the bankers and had to move in with his
daughter, Casey (Kathleen Layman), her farmer husband Tom (Richard
Gilliland) and their three kids. Teen-aged Johnny (Jason Kristopher)
dreams of living an urban existence in glittery L.A., while his
brother Gus (Devin Ratray) rhapsodizes about his pet pig. Daisy
Keith plays their adopted Vietnamese daughter, but she doesn't have
a lot to do in the pilot.
   Not unlike blue-collar family in ``Roseanne,'' they struggle
against financial realities with humor.
   The pilot relies too much on one-liners, but there's something
endearing about a comedy that even dares to occasionally mention God.
   In the pilot, the family has to bring in the wheat crop without
their broken-down combine before a fierce storm blows in. They do
and it does, bringing with it a tornado. When they emerge from the
basement to see if their home is standing, Tom declares, ``It's
still here, but there's a dead witch under the house and
everything's in color!''
   B.L. is supposed to be a kind of Archie Bunker of the Plains, but
he's too sweet to take seriously. B.L. and Tom carp at each other,
but beneath it all have a begrudging mutual respect. There's a nice
moment When Tom tries to tell B.L. he appreciates the way B.L. stood
up to the smarmy finance man who's trying to buy Tom's farm.
   Good-hearted ``Heartland'' is produced by Tony Thomas, Paul Witt
and Don Reo, who is also the writer.

   Elsewhere in television:
   MORE THAN NOSTALGIA _ ``Making Sense of the Sixties,'' a six-part
series to air on public television in 1990-91, begins production
this month. Says co-executive producer Ricki Green, ``This is not an
exercise in nostalgia. We have promised PBS and CPB (Corporation for
Public Broadcasting) a serious examination of the decade, one that
explains how the '60s influenced who we are in the '80s and '90s.''
...
   JUST AS WE SUSPECTED _ So who's taping all these shows on VCRs?
Families with kids and money. According to Nielsen Media Research,
84 percent of VCR households have incomes of over $40,000 a year, 73
percent have members with four years of college, 76 percent have
more than four members of the family, and 74 percent have kids
between the ages of 6 and 17.

this a few months ago, but the Chicago Cubs are planning to talk with pitcher
Rick Sutcliffe this week about a contract extension.;   Sutcliffe is making
$2.175 million this season and is eligible to become a free agent in October.
The Cubs had hesitated to discuss the future with him because of his long
struggle from shoulder surgery in May 1990, but in his nine starts since Aug.
6, the 35-year-old right-hander is 3-1 with a 2.21 ERA. Sutcliffe has been
with the club since 1984, second in seniority to Ryne Sandberg, and there
would be an uproar if he's let free.; WHO'S THE BOSS?; TV actor Tony Danza is
one of Tommy Lasorda's 74 million or so closest friends, so the Dodgers'
manager let him be a guest batboy Sept. 21. The Dodgers won a ninth-inning
thriller, so players asked him to return the next day for good luck. Danza
obliged, taking care of the bats and smelly socks.;   N.L. President Bill
White heard about this and showed Lasorda who's the boss, fining him $500 for
having an outsider in the dugout during a game. For comparison, Cincinnati
pitcher Norm Charlton was fined $1,000 for admitting that he tried to hit
Dodgers catcher Mike Scioscia in the head with a fastball.  </TEXT>

<HEADLINE>  DIRECTOR'S CHAIR IS UNEMPLOYMENT HEDGE FOR
STARS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Television  </MEMO>
<TEXT>   HARDLY anyone looks at the director's credit on a TV sitcom, but one name
might catch your eye as it zips by in the opening moments of tonight's episode
of CBS's "The Family Man": Mark-Linn Baker.;    That's right, it's the same
Mark-Linn Baker who plays dippy Larry on ABC's "Perfect Strangers." You
wouldn't expect him to be able to direct you to the men's room, right?;    So
maybe you happened to spot the director's credit in last week's episode of the
same sitcom: Scott Baio.;    That's no mistake either. He's the same Scott
Baio who used to go by the name Chachi on "Happy Days" and its spinoff,
"Joannie Loves Chachi." He seems marginally better suited to the job of
director. After all, wasn't his last TV series called "Charles in Charge"?;   
What's going on here?;    Actually, nothing that unusual. Off-camera, Baker is
much more ambitious and intelligent than the character he plays, while Baio is
much more serious and sophisticated than you'd believe from his boyish TV
roles. Both are veterans of years in sitcoms, guys who know the score when it
comes to TV comedy.;    That's why they're wisely developing their
behind-the-camera skills, perhaps preparing for that day when acting jobs may
be harder to come by and no longer creative enough to satisfy them.;    Though
Baker is still the star of a hit series and Baio remains in demand as an
actor, they're both following a well-worn trail in television that frequently
leads to even more success for sitcom stars.;    Here are some examples of
other TV sitcom stars who branched out into directing and did even better:;   
(check) The late Jerry Paris, best known as Rob Petrie's next-door neighbor,
Jerry Helper, on "The Dick Van Dyke Show," turned director in the late 1960s
and rarely acted again. He was the regular director of one of TV's
longest-running hits, "Happy Days," and did a number of feature films,
including "The Grasshopper" with Jacqueline Bisset, "Never A Dull Moment" with
Van Dyke, and the second and third "Police Academy" sequels, both huge hits.; 
  (check) Rob Reiner, the former Mike "Meathead" Stivic of "All in the
Family," first dabbled in TV directing, then switched to features in the 1980s
with a series of hits from "This is Spinal Tap" and "Stand by Me" to "The
Princess Bride," "When Harry Met Sally" and last year's "Misery.";    (check)
Penny Marshall, Reiner's ex-wife, left the role of Laverne DeFazio on "Laverne
&amp; Shirley" to try directing. After a couple of false starts, she hit it big
with "Big" and last year's "Awakenings" for the big screen.;    (check) Ron
Howard, one of several "Happy Days" alumni who turned to directing, learned
his craft by keeping his eyes open during his many years as a juvenile actor
and breaking into features with the 1977 exploitation film "Grand Theft Auto."
Now he's one of Hollywood's most important directors after hits like
"Splash!," "Cocoon," "Gung Ho," "Parenthood" and the current "Backdraft.";   
(check) Bill Bixby, the former star of "The Courtship of Eddie's Father"
sitcom, began shifting to directing in the 1970s with a series of TV pilot
episodes and made-for-TV features like "The Barbary Coast" and "Three On a
Date." He even directed himself in the last two "Incredible Hulk" movies.;   
(check) Alan Alda, star of the long-running "M(*)A(*)S(*)H" series, directed
many episodes of his own series and successfully switched to feature films in
the 1980s with "The Four Seasons," "Sweet Liberty" and, most recently,
"Betsy's Wedding.";    (check) Richard Benjamin, the star of TV's "He and She"
series, edged into directing in the 1970s and scored a big hit with his first
feature film, 1982's "My Favorite Year" (which starred Mark-Linn Baker). Now
primarily a director, he has done such films as "City Heat" with Clint
Eastwood and Burt Reynolds and "The Money Pit" with Tom Hanks and Shelley
Long.;    (check) Jackie Cooper, the former movie child star, became a TV
comedy star with his 1959-62 CBS sitcom "Hennesey" but soon earned a
reputation as one of the best directors of comedy pilots. Though he still
acts, Cooper is mainly a director of TV movies such as "Rosie: The Rosemary
Clooney Story" and "Rainbow.";    (check) Danny DeVito, though still a top
comedy star, has established glowing credits as a director since he made his
first TV movie, "The Ratings Game," for cable's Movie Channel in 1984. Among
his hits: "Throw Momma From the Train" (1987), "War of the Roses" (1989).;   
Making good on that first directing break isn't easy, but heads-up actors such
as Baker and Baio know it's worth the effort, because there's no predicting
how long their starring days will last.;    Maybe that's why Michael J. Fox,
"Family Ties" sitcom star turned movie star ("Back to the Future I, II &amp;
III"), just broke into directing with an episode of HBO's "Tales from the
Crypt." You never can tell when that credit may come in handy.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  QUESTION: Can you please tell me if ALF of the series of the same name is a
real small person, a robot or an animated puppet?;    ANSWER: "ALF" is a
combination of special effects and mechanical wizardry that involves many
people. To this day, the producers refuse to divulge the secrets of his
operation. In fact, they still insist that their publicists say that ALF
really is an alien when asked this question.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Q: Are there any plans to make a sequel to "The Sound of Music"?;    A:
There have been lots of plans (including a von Trapp family movie by producer
Michael Viner) but nothing is close to being executed. This is at least in
part because of legal complications with rights owned by the estate of Oscar
Hammerstein (who with Richard Rodgers composed the musical). The remaining
real-life von Trapps own and operate a family lodge in Stowe, Vt. There Maria,
wearing her familiar Swiss costume, gladly signed autographs until her death
in 1987 at the age of 82.;    Q: I am a big fan of Alyssa Milano (Samantha) of
the sitcom "Who's the Boss?" Can you tell me if she has played in any movies?;
   A: The 18-year-old actress's first feature film was "Old Enough," which won
awards at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival, after which she co-starred with
Arnold Schwarzenegger in "Commando" and with Sir John Gielgud in "The
Canterville Ghost." Right now she is in production on a comedy tentatively
titled "Coed" with Jonathan Silverman and plans to begin work in February on a
Spanish movie titled "Of Love and Shadows." Making "Coed" means juggling time:
"Boss" by day, "Coed" nights and weekends, with her senior year of high school
sandwiched in-between.;    Q: I loved Sage Stallone in "Rocky V." Could you
please tell me more about him?;    A: The older of Sylvester and ex-wife Sasha
Stallone's two sons, 14-year-old Sage is a film fan who takes and edits his
own home movies. He's an exercise enthusiast and also enjoys skiing, music,
reading, travel and cars. Younger brother Seargeoh, 11, is autistic, which has
led the rest of the Stallone family to involvement in fund-raising activities
on behalf of autism research.  </TEXT>

   ``Twin Peaks'' returns to ABC's fall schedule
despite slipping ratings in a ``bold experiment'' to lure viewers
back to the tube on Saturday nights, the network's entertainment
chief says.
   ``When you think about it, the idea grows on you,'' Robert A.
Eiger told a gathering of network advertisers Monday.
   ``One, there are a lot of young adult viewers home on Saturday
night with nothing to watch so they go out and rent videotapes. And
two, we think this show can prosper when we move it away from that
real tough `Cheers' competition on Thursday night.''
   NBC, revealing its fall schedule later in the day, went for the
laugh track with six situation comedies among nine new shows. That
makes 17 sitcoms on NBC next fall, its most ever.
   ABC opens its Saturday night gamble with the Western ``Young
Riders,'' followed by the critically praised Vietnam series ``China
Beach'' and then ``Twin Peaks,'' the moody drama created by film
director David Lynch.
   ``We're going for the gold with three special programs in an
all-out attempt to change the perception of Saturday night
television,'' Eiger said.
   ``Twin Peaks'' will debut with a two-hour movie and will take
less of a serial approach, more akin to ``Hill Street Blues,'' he
said.
   NBC's hourlong series are ``Signs of Life,'' a
patient's-eye-view ``reality'' program about medicine; ``Law and
Order,'' about criminal justice from arrest through trial, and the
musical comedy ``Hull Street High.''
   The network, which just won the prime time ratings for the fifth
consecutive season, renewed ``Grand,'' ``Wings'' and ``Carol &amp;
Co,'' but axed 4-season-old ``ALF,'' ``227,'' ``Baywatch,'' ``My
Two Dads'' and `Mancuso FBI.''
   Two of NBC's new sitcoms are based on movies, ``Parenthood'' and
``Ferris Bueller.'' The others are rap-driven ``Fresh Prince of Bel
Air,'' ``The Fanelli Boys'' and ``Working It Out,'' which co-stars
Jane Curtin, formerly of CBS' ``Kate &amp; Allie,'' playing a divorced
person.
   ABC, with six new shows, also offers a musical hour in Steven
Bochco's ``Cop Rock,'' an intriguing combination of police action
and Randy Newman's music reminiscent of the PBS hit ``The Singing
Detective.''
   ABC dropped six low-rated series: ``Elvis,'' tales of the King
when he was a youth, ``Brewster Place,'' with Oprah Winfrey,
``Capital News,'' ``The Marshall Chronicles,'' `H.E.L.P.'' and
``Sunset Beat.''
   CBS' schedule may come out later this week or early next week, a
spokesman said. Fox Broadcasting said it will release its lineup
May 29.
   ``Twin Peaks,'' a tangled saga of sex, lies and death in the
Northwest, was this season's most talked-about series. It started
strong on April 8, winning with a 21.7 rating, but has lost more
than 50 percent of its viewers.
   Its season finale Wednesday should have high ratings because it
resolves the murder of high school beauty queen Laura Palmer, a
mystery that prompted ``I Killed Laura Palmer'' T-shirts in
California.
   Last Thursday's show gave the series its lowest Nielsens to date
_ a 10.6 rating and a 17 percent audience share. Each ratings point
represents 921,000 homes.
   Other ABC renewals include the high-rated ``Roseanne'' and
``thirtysomething,'' ``Life Goes On'' and ABC News' ``PrimeTime
Live'' and ``20-20.''
   Three of the new series on ABC's roster are sitcoms _ ``Baby
Talk,'' based on the hit movie ``Look Who's Talking''; ``Going
Places,'' about four young adults in Los Angeles working on their
first TV show _ a ``candid videos'' series; and ``Married People,''
about three generations of couples sharing a brownstone in New York.
   Capitalizing on its top-rated ``America's Funniest Home
Videos,'' ABC also will have ``America's Funniest ... Part II.''
   James Earl Jones, whose ``Paris'' police series on CBS flopped a
decade ago, will try again in a new hourlong ABC series,
``Gabriel's Fire,'' playing an ex-convict working as a private
investigator for a defense attorney.

<TEXT>
   Saturday, Oct. 17, 8 p.m.-conclusion EDT, on ABC: The first game of the 1987 World Series. 
This year's Series may not be as exciting as last year's, but it will probably beat the football season! 

   Weekly, beginning Oct. 19, various times, on PBS (check local listings; Wednesday, Oct. 21, 6-6:30 p.m. EDT, on WNET): "Rockschool." 
Don't worry if your kids get hooked on this 24-part series about rock music. 
Hosted by Herbie Hancock, it will teach them something about music theory, craft and technique -- to say nothing of high-tech instrumentation. 
It's so interesting, you might get hooked, too. 

   Monday, Oct. 19, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on NBC: "Strange Voices." 
One of the facts of life not dealt with on the sitcom "Facts of Life" is schizophrenia. 
In this TV movie, a regular on that sitcom, Nancy McKeon, plays a mentally ill college student. 

   Wednesday, Oct. 21, various times, on PBS (PBS dates and times vary, so check local listings): The year's first "Mark Russell Comedy Special." 
The Washington-based political satirist says, "This is my busy season . . . if I owned a department store, it would be five days before Christmas." 

   Wednesday, Oct. 21, 10-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Legacy of the Hollywood Blacklist." 
What do we learn from this film? 
That late-1940s anti-communism was just "paranoia"; that the Hollywood 10 were just "progressives"; and that PBS favors the manipulative ideologues of the left over those of the right. 

   Thursday, Oct. 22, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on A&amp;E (repeated at 1 a.m. and on Oct 25): "Baryshnikov: The Dancer and the Dance." 
This British-made documentary takes an intimate look at ballet's monarch. 

   Friday, Oct. 23, 8-10 p.m. EDT, on A&amp;E (repeated at midnight and on Oct. 24); "After Pilkington." 
This dark, subtle film is too psychological for a murder mystery, too intricately plotted for a love story. 
British playwright Simon Gray has a gift for making us care for unlovable people. 

   Friday, Oct. 23, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "David Gordon's Made in U.S.A." 
If you crave more Baryshnikov, tune in for this innovative "Great Performances" premiere, featuring avant-garde choreography by Mr. Gordon, direction by Don Mischer (who staged the Emmy-winning Tony Awards), and graphics by video artists John Sanborn and Mary Perillo. 

   Saturday, Oct. 24, 10-11 p.m. EDT, on HBO (repeated Oct. 27, 30 and Nov. dates TBA): "HBO World Stage: Billy Joel From Leningrad, USSR." 
That's right, folks -- Leningrad, back in the U.S.S.R., not Leningrad, Maine. 
Don't miss the first no-holds-barred American rock concert in the Soviet Union, made possible by the General Exchanges Agreement signed at the 1985 Geneva summit. 
Joel's much-publicized public tantrum not included. 

   Sunday, Oct. 25, 3:30-6 p.m. EST, on ABC: "The McDonald's Basketball Open." 
More dizzying cultural exchange. 
Having already played Tracer Milan, the Italian team that currently holds the European championship, the Milwaukee Bucks will go on to represent the NBA against the Soviet National Team. 

   Sunday, Oct. 25, 9-11 p.m. EST, on NBC: "Bay Coven." 
Avoid quiet New England villages! 
According to this movie with Pamela Sue Martin (formerly of "Dynasty"), the witch hunters of the 17th century didn't finish the job. 

   Monday, Oct. 26, 9-11 p.m. EST, on NBC: "Deep Dark Secrets." 
Avoid country inns! 
This second pre-Halloween hair-raiser is about the young co-manager of such an establishment, who discovers the shocking truth about her partner/hubby. 
Out-in-the-sticks thrillers must attract "Dynasty" graduates; this one stars Pamela Bellwood.

   Tracey Ullman dubbed it ``the hippest Emmys,''
and, oh, was it. Next year they'll probably just call it, ``So It's
the Emmy Awards _ See If We Care.''
   But this was, in fact, the 40th Annual Emmy Awards, so it was
kind of two-faced, alternately glib and cynical, then mushily
nostalgic over clips of Ozzie and Harriet, Jimmy Durante, Jack
Benny and Rochester, Lucille Ball and Jackie Gleason, among dozens
of others, flickering reminders of the days when we weren't so hip.
   This year's executive producer, Lorne Michaels of ``Saturday
Night Live,'' gamely attempted to salvage the event from tedium and
for the most part succeeded. It was 40 minutes shorter and
infinitely more entertaining than the rambling four hours last year.
   Instead of the embarrassingly bad musical number that has opened
awards shows past, Sunday night's show opened with a musical number
that was bad on purpose _ Jan Hooks and Nora Dunn doing their
wonderfully lame lounge act, the Sweeney Sisters from ``Saturday
Night Live.'' During a bad medley of TV theme songs, they roamed
the audience, gaping at the celebrities who squirmed and simpered
uncomfortably.
   Michaels' thinly veiled homage to his own show _ the band was,
of course, led by SNL's G.E. Smith _ occasionally rivaled even the
Fox Broadcasting Co.'s level of self-promotion. This is the second
year Fox has carried the Emmys.
   In between plugging their Fox shows, co-presenters Ullman and
Garry Shandling discussed the Emmys.
   ``This is the hippest Emmys I've ever seen,'' Ullman said.
   ``Oh, these are the real Emmys. I thought this was just another
`Saturday Night Live' skit,'' replied Shandling, displaying hipness
squared.
   Some winners even got in on the too-hip act. John Larroquette,
who picked up his fourth Emmy for best supporting actor in ``Night
Court,'' noted wearily, ``Now I am officially overwhelmed.'' He
thanked the academy for its ``generosity and keen eye for talent.''
``A little anti-humility joke,'' he over-explained.
   Michaels dispensed with the co-host concept, instead having
co-presenters engage in dialogues that were sometimes _ gasp _
funny. Kirstie Alley (``Cheers'') enthused over co-presenter John
Lithgow's acting ability, especially his Broadway performance in
``M. Butterfly.'' Lithgow replied in perfect halting perplexity,
``This is very embarrassing Kirstie, but ... I'm not exactly sure
what you do.''
   Robin Williams, not even safe on videotape, paid a hilarious,
crazed, tasteless tribute to cable programming. Cable shows were
eligible for Emmys this year for the first time.
   Tony Danza was the ``designated acceptor,'' a new comic device
that allowed him to pick up Emmys for those who were too hip to
even be at the ceremony. When John Shea won for supporting actor in
``Baby M,'' Danza rushed up to accept the statuette, gushing, ``I
didn't prepare anything! I didn't think he was going to win!''
Later, after his third or fourth time, Danza noted intelligently,
``This was funny the first couple of times, but I'm outta
material.''
   There were moments immune from sneering. Larry Drake received a
warm ovation when he was named best supporting actor in a drama for
his sensitive portrayal of the retarded office assistant on ``L.A.
Law.''
   There was an ovation for co-presenters Mary Tyler Moore and Dick
Van Dyke, who played Rob and Laura Petrie on ``The Dick Van Dyke
Show'' in the 1960s. Van Dyke nudged Moore into spouting in her
trademark quaver, ``Oh, Rob!''
   Richard Kiley, who won best lead actor in a drama, brought the
proceedings back to reality when he complained about NBC having, in
fact, canceled his critically praised show, ``A Year in the Life.''
   Michaels brought out some unexpected co-presenters, such as
``Head of the Class'' star Robyn Givens and her heavyweight hubby
Mike Tyson, and newsies Sam Donaldson and George F. Will.
   Hip magicians Penn and Teller presented the wrap-up of the 44
technical awards given out Saturday.
   In perhaps a metaphor for the night, Penn Jillette promised to
drop a Maytag washing machine on his partner if the audience paid
attention to the awards.
   Teller escaped unharmed. So did the Emmys.

   Old Faces and Concepts Return to Tube

   Once a year, every year, TV's premiere week rolls around.
I think of it like the holiday season. There are all sorts of
new programs, like gift-wrapped boxes sitting under the tree,
and every one is a chance for something really good. Well,
this week a new TV season begins, but all you'll find in
these boxes are hand-me-downs -- beatup sweaters and
out-of-date ties.
   The stars of the 1991-92 season are the old standbys --
James Garner, Carol Burnett, Redd Foxx -- and the concepts
are just as faded: cops, lawyers, and families with living
rooms. In fact, everyone's moving back into the living room
this year. A divorced daughter and her kids move back on "The
Royal Family" (CBS, Wednesday, 8 p.m. EDT), a long-lost
brother on "Flesh 'n' Blood" (NBC, Friday, 9:30 p.m.), a
sister on "Sibs" (ABC, Wednesday, 9:30 p.m.), returning GIs
on "Homefront" (ABC, Tuesday, 10 p.m., starting Sept. 24).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This all makes sense, because you might say that the
networks themselves are moving back into the living room.
Last year, like intrepid teens, they went out into the wide
world of experimentation. They played around with offbeat
concepts like "Twin Peaks" and "Cop Rock," and by their
standards, they failed miserably: There were no hits last
season, and advertising revenues have been dropping. Small
wonder the networks have decided to come back to the cozy
security of the living room -- the known and safe haven of
sitcomland -- to curl up on the family sofa.
   The show that epitomizes this backward-think is "Step by
Step" (ABC, Friday, 8:30 p.m.). The stars, Patrick Duffy and
Suzanne Somers, are recycled from "Dallas" and "Three's
Company," respectively. Then there's the concept. It's the
story of a single mother with three children. And it's the
story, of a man named Duffy, who was busy raising three kids
of his own. They were four kids, living all together, yet
they were all alone. Till the one day when the lady met this
fellow, and they knew that it was much more than a hunch.
That this group would somehow form a family, and that's the
way they all became the Brady Bunch. The Brady Bunch . . .
oops.
   With its two parents and its six kids, "Step by Step" may
seem exactly like "The Brady Bunch," but actually, there's a
1990s twist: The two sets of kids don't really like each
other] Well, maybe that was in "The Brady Bunch" too. I can't
remember. But this one definitely doesn't have a housekeeper
named Alice.
   Instead, it's got food fights and jokes about zits and
cute kids making snide remarks. Plus it's got lines like, "I
know I'm not your mother, but I would really like to be your
friend."
   And it has sex.
   In fact, this whole season seems to be oozing sexuality.
People are pawing at one another, rubbing up against each
other, taking off their clothes at the slightest provocation.
From "Step by Step" to "Roc" (Fox, Sunday, 8:30 p.m.) to
"Home Improvement" (ABC, Tuesday, 8:30 p.m.), everyone's
talking trash and getting primed to hop into the sack. The
middle-aged folks are going for it on "Sibs." The old folks
are going for it on "The Royal Family." I can't tell if this
is a good sign or a bad sign, but it's definitely a trend.
   And speaking of trends, the most interesting one this
season is how many shows are striving to be politically
correct. Call it the PC season. Blacks, women, the poor, even
the deaf -- they all get to speak out against oppression. On
"Homefront," women get booted out of jobs by returning male
GIs; on "Teach" (CBS, Wednesday, 8:30 p.m.), a black music
teacher in an all-white prep school is told he wouldn't even
have his job if they didn't need a token; on the sitcom "The
Torkelsons" (NBC, Friday, 10 p.m.), a dirt-poor Okie family
must struggle to hold off the reposessors; and "Reasonable
Doubts" (NBC, Friday, 10 p.m.), stars hearing-impaired
actress Marlee Maitlin. At least the networks are trying. But
unfortunately, all they've been able to prove so far is that
they're able to make minorities look just as foolish as
everyone else.
   There is one exception, a show that's more than just PC.
It's a one-hour drama called "I'll Fly Away" (NBC, Tuesday, 8
p.m., starting Oct. 8), and I think it will be one of the
very best of the new season. Set against the volatile decade
when the civil rights movement was just beginning, it's the
tale of a Southern district attorney (Sam Waterston) raising
his three kids with the help of a black housekeeper (Regina
Taylor).
   Of course, "I'll Fly Away" owes a clear debt to "To Kill a
Mockingbird," but whatever the inspiration, it offers a
special sensitivity in both its writing and its acting, a
subtlety rarely seen on weekly TV. In a world of black and
white, no one is painted black or white. Catch it fast,
because this excellent program is just the kind of show that
might get canceled very soon.
   In almost every way, "I'll Fly Away" is swimming against
the tide. It's a one-hour drama trying to survive in a season
of half-hour sitcoms, a season with laugh tracks all around
the dial. In fact, posterity may well record 1991-92 as the
great reflowering of the sitcom. Rarely have there been so
many, and rarely have they been done better. The form's great
practitioners (James L. Brooks, James Burrows, Susan Harris,
Gary David Goldberg, Stan Daniels) have returned, and notable
actors like David Keith, Marsha Mason and the Broadway cast
of "Piano Lesson" have been enlisted.
   This means that the networks will be all the more shocked
when these terminally silly programs do nothing to halt the
steady erosion of viewers. When their best shot -- the old
tried and true -- doesn't work, things should get pretty
interesting around the networks. There'll be some real drama.
   In the meantime, this season does offer a couple of
programs that look to the future instead of the past,
programs with a little inventiveness: "Herman's Head" (Fox,
Sunday, 9:30 p.m.) and "Eerie, Indiana" (NBC, Sunday, 7:30
p.m.). You won't mistake either for high art, but both have a
sense of fun and imagination. And both will be written about
in future columns.

   Katherine Helmond's juicy role as the hip
mother with the swinging lifestyle was an afterthought when the hit
ABC comedy ``Who's the Boss?'' was being created, the actress said.
   ``The show was originally written for two sisters, one a working
woman and one with lots of children,'' said Helmond. ``One was a
go-getter, the other was very domestic.
   ``But they found that combination never clicked. They read a lot
of young ladies. But they felt it turned out to be kind of sour
grapes. Each sister seemed a little envious of the other. No matter
how many times they rehearsed it, they couldn't make it funny.''
   It finally occurred to the producers to give Judith Light a
mother as a sparring partner. Tony Danza stars as an ex-boxer who
becomes a housekeeper.
   ``When my name came up at a casting session I was doing a play
in San Francisco,'' said Helmond, who plays Mona Robinson. ``I
asked them, `What are you looking for?' They said a mother who
causes trouble, but in a funny way. I said she'd have to be someone
underfoot all the time. I got ideas from my grandmother who lived
with us. She was very funny, very even-handed and right in the
middle of everything. A big, strapping Irish woman with red hair,
one of those Texas women who says whatever she thinks.''
   The pilot for ``Who's the Boss?'' created a triangle of three
totally different people.
   ``But somehow, that triangle works,'' she said. ``This man who
takes care of the house, a highly successful woman who can't do a
thing at home and her mother. I think a lot of families today are
made up of different elements. Two divorced women living together,
two fathers. I think the cost of living today has contributed to
these kind of made-up families.''
   Helmond grew up in Galveston, Texas, and got her early dramatic
training in Houston and Dallas. She moved on to New York, where she
was nominated for a Tony for her performance in Eugene O'Neill's
``The Great God Brown'' in 1973. She was in numerous other
productions, but she's best known for her role as Jessica Tate in
the satirical comedy series ``Soap.''
   Her latest movie is ``Shadey,'' made in England, but she's also
been in ``Time Bandits,'' ``Brazil,'' ``Overboard,'' ``Family
Plot,'' ``The Hindenburg'' and ``The Baby Blue Marine.''
   She is married to sculptor David Christian, but lately he has
also taken up writing. He recently adapted a short story by
Somerset Maugham for a TV film to be called ``Plain Jane.''
   ``He had to update it,'' she said. ``We didn't realize how
difficult it would be to get the rights. It took 18 months because
there are so many heirs. And the British don't move very fast.
   ``I'll play Jane. I think we may do it in Texas because we'd get
some help there. Jane's a woman who goes through a total
metamorphosis. She changes as does the world around her. She
becomes a woman who can live in the world.''
   Her husband started writing when she enrolled in the women's
directing program at the American Film Institute. She needed a
project immediately, so he adapted a Raymond Carver short story.
Her film ``Bankrupt'' is one of six films from the course that was
selected to be shown on the Arts &amp; Entertainment Channel.
   She and Christian own homes in Los Angeles and Long Island and
have apartments in New York and London.
   ``We've just gone through remodeling our home here,'' she said.
``It was a 1932 house, and all the wiring and plumbing had to be
redone. The city building inspector gave it approval the other day.
It took two years. We're giving a big party for all the workers and
our neighbors, who also had to put up with all the inconvenience.
   ``Our London apartment is in an old neighborhood near Baker
Street. I love going to the fishmonger, the greengrocer, the
bakery. You have to bring your own plastic bags. The first time,
they asked me if I had any plastic. I thought they meant a credit
card.''

<LEADPARA>  IF PERPETUALLY neurotic stand-up comic Richard Lewis didn't have a starring

reason to visit his psychiatrist.;   How else could he face life? Doesn't
every successful stand-up have a sitcom by now?  </LEADPARA>

COMEDIES
COMIC ACTORS? PLEASE STAND-UP  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     Think about it:;   Bob Saget and Dave Coulier have ABC's "Full House," and
other ABC shows they host separately -- Saget's "America's Funniest Home
Videos" and Coulier's "America's Funniest People.";   Roseanne Barr has ABC's
"Roseanne." Jerry Seinfeld has "Seinfeld," Woody Harrelson has "Cheers" and
Marsha Warfield has "Night Court," all on NBC. Pam Stone is a regular on ABC's
"Coach," which stars Craig T. Nelson, who started out as a stand-up.;   And
there is, of course, TV's current granddaddy of stand-up, Bill Cosby of NBC's
"The Cosby Show.";   Although stand-up comics have been finding homes in
sitcoms since TV began, a deluge is now in progress. Any stand-up with any
kind of following now seems to be getting an invitation to join a sitcom.;  
Next month, for example, Tim Allen brings his handyman/philosopher persona to
ABC as the star of "Home Improvement" on Tuesday nights at 8:30.;   Also
arriving this season are wacky Jeff Altman and smoky-voiced Stephanie Hodge in
NBC's "Nurses" on Saturday nights at 9.;    Meanwhile, back at the raunch; Due
later in the season is raunchy Sam Kinison, whose "Charlie Hoover" is a backup
show for the Fox schedule.;   Still on hand is San Jose's Kevin Pollak, whose
"Morton &amp; Hayes" is finishing a CBS summer run on Wednesday nights at 8:30.;  
And returning this fall after a long absence from prime time is the legendary
Dirty Old Man of stand-up, Redd Foxx, who will star in CBS's "The Royal
Family" on Wednesday nights at 8.;   There's a good reason for the stand-up
stampede: Most of these comics already have a following among the young adults
network advertisers most want to reach.;   Another reason: Most situation
comedies are filmed or taped in front of a live audience, and many producers
of comedy shows feel stand-up comics fit perfectly into such an environment.; 
 "They have all this experience working in front of audiences, like the old
vaudevillians," said producer-director Rob Reiner, whose company produces
"Morton &amp; Hayes" and "Seinfeld.";   Reiner worked as a sitcom actor for years
-- he was Mike "Meathead" Stivic in the classic "All in the Family" -- and
knows an experienced stand-up has an edge over a movie-trained actor when
breaking into the sitcom field.;   "They've learned what's funny by playing in
front of a live crowd," he said. "That's the best training ground you can
have.";   Still, it's not automatically easy for every stand-up to break into
acting with an ensemble of other performers, speaking lines written by someone
else, especially if they're used to standing out there alone, performing their
own material.;   "It's a bit of a problem," says Seinfeld, who usually writes
his own material from personal experiences but now has three other writers
turning out lines for his sitcom character. "I always have to change them into
my rhythm to feel comfortable.";   In contrast, Lewis, whose show will be on
opposite Seinfeld's this fall, has adjusted to delivering other people's lines
and now enjoys the relief from his stand-up work.;   "It's certainly nice to
be on stage with some people," he said. "When you do stand-up, which is pretty
courageous for anybody, you live and die by your own jokes.";   Stop me if
you've heard this; Coulier of "Full House" says a major adjustment was
learning how to play to the same live crowd with the same jokes for all the
retakes sitcom work requires. Newcomer Allen is now trying to learn the same
lesson.;   "What's odd is to do it several times to the same crowd," said
Allen.;   It was unnerving, he said, to do your line, get a big laugh from the
studio audience, then learn you'd have to do it again because the lighting
wasn't right.;   "I can't do it again. These people just saw this," Allen
protested at first. Now he's trying to accept doing gags over and over for
fewer laughs, although he admits, "That's taken some time getting used to.";  
For Lewis, there was some trouble learning how to apply the technique he'd
learned over a decade of stand-up comedy in an environment where you have to
hit your marks for the cameras and wait for line cues.;   "As a stand-up, I'm
basically myself -- unfortunately," he said. "But when you do a show as an
actor, you have to listen. You're part of an ensemble.";   Some TV producers
believe stand-ups become, by necessity, good actors in order to work
successfully in front of crowds, so the transition to working with others
shouldn't be hard for them.;   Fed up with stand-up; "We didn't go out looking
for stand-up comics," explained writer-producer Susan Harris, who gave Billy
Crystal his first big TV break with a role on her "Soap" and now has cast two
stand-ups, Altman and Hodge, in her "Nurses.";   Instead, said Harris, she
pays attention to basic acting skills, not the venue in which her cast members
have been demonstrating those skills most recently.;   That's fine with Hodge,
who, like many stand-ups, was trained first as an actor and only took up
stand-up comedy to "gain maturity, life experience and a little more courage
and a lot more confidence than I had at the time.";   Hodge, in fact, hopes
"Nurses" clicks, so she can leave stand-up behind.;   "It's a bizarre
lifestyle," she said, "because you're extraordinarily creative for small
spurts of time, and the rest of the time you feel like this sort of lump,
alone in a bad hotel where no one really cares.";   Lewis shares Hodge's
desire to move away from stand-up, but for different reasons. After rising to
the top of the stand-up heap -- he once played Carnegie Hall to a sellout
crowd -- he's not sure it can satisfy him creatively much longer.;   "I've
done it," said Lewis. "I don't mean to sound like a prima donna, but I have 10
or 12 cassettes on the market. I've done 50 Lettermans. After you play
Carnegie Hall, there's a point where you say you're not going back to those
clubs and work out every night. I don't need to. Now I'm more interested in
acting and writing movie scripts.";   Though Lewis is in a successful show and
has begun to get big roles in feature films, he's still not the kind of
overnight ratings sensation Barr was for ABC. Few stand-ups are so lucky. And
they certainly don't come with money-back guarantees.;   And boy, are my jokes
tired; Among the more recent failures: CBS's 1990-91 flop "Lenny," starring
blue-collar comic Lenny Clarke, and Jackie Mason in ABC's "Chicken Soup" the
year before.;   Yet TV history is loaded with stand-up stars who were
enormously successful in sitcoms -- such as Crystal, Don Adams, George Gobel,
Freddie Prinze, Jimmie Walker, Gabe Kaplan, Robin Williams -- and even a few
who became TV legends, such as Red Skelton, Danny Thomas and Bob Newhart.;  
"There are a great many stand-up comedians they've tried to write sitcoms for
and failed," says TV producer Greg Antonacci, who's doing Foxx's new show.
"What's important is that the persona fit the character.";   Seinfeld agrees
"absolutely." His NBC series is so closely patterned after his own life that
it even includes his club stand-up routines each week. The only difference
between the TV Jerry and the real Jerry, says Seinfeld, "is that he doesn't
have a sitcom yet.";   Seinfeld says he's a student of his craft and knew it
would be a great mistake for him to play a different kind of character in a
sitcom.;   "It took me 15 years to figure out what people think is funny about
me," he said.;   Most of the younger stand-ups now working in sitcoms also
believe it's fatal to veer too far from their stand-up persona. Coulier, for
example, is able to use the "funny noises" that made him a stand-up smash to
amuse the youngsters he works with in "Full House." ABC has built Allen's
"Home Improvement" around his "men are pigs" routine as a pro-male handyman
version of Robert Bly. Hodge's "Nurses" character is just as "angry" as her
stand-up character.;   Standing in sharp contrast, though, is Foxx, whose
legendary stand-up status came from blue material he couldn't use in his big
NBC hit, "Sanford and Son." Today, Foxx's stand-up material seems soapy clean
in contrast to what the youngsters are doing.;   "Every comedian on Earth is
dirtier than me now," he said.;   If a stand-up star also becomes a sitcom
star, the TV series almost always broadens the appeal of the comic whenever he
or she does the stand-up act again. Coulier and Seinfeld, for instance, now
play to huge crowds after years in front of modest ones.;   But for some,
sitcom success means an end to stand-up work and a transition into full-time
acting in TV or movies. Altman of "Nurses" says that won't happen to him, no
matter how well the show does.;   "It's something you do because you're nuts,
and you have to find some sort of venue that will take you," he said. "The
stage of stand-up comedy is that place. If I never did another club again, I
would still go up to the Comedy Store or the Improv and get up on stage,
because I can't not do it."  </TEXT>
