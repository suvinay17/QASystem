<HEAD>Computer Analysis Finds `Brushy Bill' Not Billy the Kid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LINCOLN, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group that defends the legend of Billy
the Kid says a computer photo analysis indicates a Texan nicknamed
``Brushy Bill'' who died in 1950 probably wasn't the famed outlaw,
as he had claimed.
   The computer tests compared a photograph of Ollie L. ``Brushy
Bill'' Roberts, who died in Hico, Texas, a week short of his 90th
birthday in December 1950, and a tintype of William Bonney, who
died at age 21 on July 14, 1881.
   Most people, including a coroner's inquest jury at the time, say
Bonney was Billy the Kid and he was shot to death in Fort Sumter,
N.M., by Lincoln Sheriff Pat Garrett.
   But Hico has its share of Brushy Bill believers who maintain the
Kid escaped, perhaps with official help, to survive to a ripe old
age in Texas.
   Billy the Kid was one of the primary players in the bloody
Lincoln County War of the late 19th century. Now, the Lincoln
County Heritage Trust is watching out for the Kid's legend, and it
initiated the photo project.
   Trust director Robert L. Hart said Friday the computer tests
were based on a similarity index of 25 landmarks on the faces.
   The computer also matched Billy to a database of 150 people from
both sexes and many racial groups, Hart said, to show how many
people in the sample, if any, were closer in appearance to Billy
than was Brushy Bill.
   From the 25 landmarks of the face the computer mathematically
derives a single number _ the index of similarity.
   If Brushy Bill and Billy the Kid were the same man, Hart said,
``then in the comparison, Billy is No. 1 and Brushy should come out
No. 2.''
   ``When the comparison was run, Brushy Bill was No. 42.
   ``That means there were 40 other individuals who look more like
Billy the Kid than Brushy does. In short, Brushy doesn't look very
much like Billy the Kid at all,'' Hart said.
   Hico Justice of the Peace Bobby Hefner, a Brushy Bill buff, said
Friday the computer study means nothing.
   ``I don't accept the tintype as being Billy the Kid at all,''
Hefner said in a telephone interview from his Hico home. ``On the
other hand, I don't accept the study. You let me program my
computer, and I guarantee Brushy Bill'd be number one.''
   But Clyde Snow, an Oklahoma forensic anthropologist known for
his work on the remains of Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele, said
the computer looks at photographs in a less subjective way than
people do.
   ``As far as Brushy Bill Roberts is concerned, the weight of the
evidence is to the point that if there were a court case, we'd be
willing to go in and say beyond a reasonable doubt the two
photographs are not photographs of the same individual,'' Snow said.
   Hart said the Brushy Bill comparison is the only one that has
been done. But the project plans to look at a dozen or so other
photographs, including pictures of two other claimants, John Miller
of Ramah, N.M., and Walking Henry Smith, and photographs believed
to be those of Billy taken at other times.
   That could take a couple of years.
   Hart called the project a ``marriage of history and technology.''
   ``Historians don't seem to be able to solve the problem of
whether Brushy Bill and Billy the Kid are the same person,'' and
bringing in science was another way to answer the question, he said.
   The photographs, one from a Las Vegas, N.M., collection and the
other owned by a San Francisco family, came to light after the
project began last year.
   Hefner, 54, agreed research would continue into the legend of
Billy the Kid.
   ``The old Texas Rangers had a saying that no one can stand up to
a man that's in the right and keeps on a-comin'. And that's my
approach to this,'' Hefner said. ``I'm in the right. I've enough
evidence in hand to convince anyone that doesn't have a prejudice.
   ``I never met old Brushy,'' he said. ``Maybe it's my sense of
fair play, of being justice of the peace: I want justice done for a
local man. I'd like to see it on through to a just conclusion.''

<TEXT>
   Gov. Garrey Carruthers has rejected a
writer's request that Billy the Kid be pardoned for his role in the
1878 shooting death of Sheriff William Brady.
   A letter is being prepared telling Las Cruces author Opal Lee
Priestley of the governor's decision, B.J. Wagner-Adam, the
governor's administrator of pardons and extraditions, said
Thursday. Ms. Priestley is the author of ``Billy the Kid: The Good
Side of a Bad Man.''
   Hundreds of living people have clemency cases pending with just
six months left in the Carruthers administration, said Ms.
Wagner-Adam said.
   She said a full investigation of all facts surrounding the case
would be impossible because it happened so long ago.
   ``There's such a volume of information out there and so much we
don't know,'' she said.
   The writer contended that the Kid was denied a fair trial.
   ``It was generally considered by those who attended the trial
that he got token representation, and it was a foregone conclusion
he would be found guilty,'' Ms. Priestley said. ``There was not
much doubt the cards were stacked against him.''
   He escaped after the trial, killing two Lincoln County deputies.
Ms. Priestley said perhaps hundreds of people knew where he was
after that but would not betray him for a $500 reward.
   ``And $500 in those days was a fortune,'' Ms. Priestley said.
   The Kid, whose real name was said to be William Bonney or Henry
McCarty, was shot to death in Fort Sumner, N.M., by Lincoln County
Sheriff Pat Garrett in 1881.

<TEXT>
<P>
The nation was stunned in spring, 1881, when a 21-year-old condemned outlaw 
blew away two deputies at the old courthouse here, stole a horse and rode off 
into the rugged Capitan Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Just three months later, Henry McCarty, a.k.a. Billy the Kid, was dead, shot 
down by Sheriff Pat Garrett in the darkened bedroom of a Ft. Sumner ranch 
house. 
</P>
<P>
The Kid has yielded none of his claim on the popular imagination 109 years 
after meeting his violent end. Yet he remains as elusive to would-be 
interpreters as he was to the lawmen of his day. 
</P>
<P>
Scholars in recent years have sought to set the record straight, separating the 
historical Kid from the extravagant legends that grew up around him. 
</P>
<P>
But serious historians must contend with a multitude of movies and novels that 
continue a long, if tarnished tradition of using the Kid's exploits as the 
basis for spinning a profitable yarn. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very much alive, much more so than most of us will be after we're gone," 
says Paul Andrew Hutton, a history professor at the University of New Mexico 
who has studied books and films about the Kid. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 films somehow have included the Kid, including the likes of John 
Wayne's "Chisum"; "The Outlaw," with Jane Russell, and "Bill and Ted's 
Excellent Adventure," in which time-traveling high school students meet the 
outlaw to prepare for a history quiz. 
</P>
<P>
Recent novels on the subject include Larry McMurtry's "Anything for Billy" and 
N. Scott Momaday's "The Ancient Child." 
</P>
<P>
While interest in the Kid has waxed and waned over the years, his cinematic and 
literary portrayals tend to reflect the times in which they are produced, 
Hutton says. 
</P>
<P>
The first films about the Kid, made in the 1930s, rendered him a 
Depression-era, monopoly-busting idealist. By 1972, when "Pat Garrett and Billy 
the Kid" debuted, the Kid had become a violent, if charming anarchist. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, the films "Young Guns" and the soon-to-be-released sequel, 
"Young Guns II," starring Brat Pack actors Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland 
and Lou Diamond Phillips, have breathed new life into the Kid's legend, even as 
they have cast him in a new light, Hutton says. 
</P>
<P>
"During our own time, he's sort of a hip young gang leader -- the Crips come to 
New Mexico," Hutton says. 
</P>
<P>
Historian Robert M. Utley, whose 1989 book, "Billy the Kid: a Short and Violent 
Life," has sold briskly, counts the Kid among those "rare flexible characters 
who can be whoever you want them to be." Indeed, there is not even agreement 
about the Kid's real name, which many had believed to be William Bonney but 
which Utley has established through records to more likely be McCarty. 
</P>
<P>
Utley has sorted through the myths about the outlaw, whom he has come to view 
as a likable, clever post-adolescent who easily lost his temper and acted 
impulsively. The Kid's resort to violence was not unusual for the times, Utley 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not the premiere outlaw he has been portrayed in legend," Utley says. 
The Kid, like other rootless drifters living on a lawless frontier, made do 
primarily with gambling and occasional cattle rustling, Utley says. 
</P>
<P>
By Utley's count, the Kid definitely committed only four killings and may have 
joined in up to six others. Legend has long held that he killed 21 men. 
</P>
<P>
The Kid found notoriety during the brief, bloody Lincoln County War of 1878, 
which had its roots in a contest between Englishman John Tunstall and local 
businessmen J. J. Dolan and L. G. Murphy for the right to sell provisions to a 
nearby Army post and Indian reservation. 
</P>
<P>
Tunstall's murder led to a series of revenge killings between his followers, 
known as the Regulators, and the Dolan-Murphy forces. 
</P>
<P>
In following months, the Kid joined other Regulators in the ambush slaying of 
Sheriff William Brady and led a daring escape from a burning house following a 
five-day siege. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually caught and convicted of Brady's murder, the Kid was jailed on the 
second-floor of the courthouse, awaiting execution, when he shot down two 
guards and made his getaway on April 28, 1881. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett, an acquaintance of the Kid's, ran him to ground at Pete Maxwell's 
ranch a few months later, on July 14. 
</P>
<P>
The Kid's legend began to take shape when territorial newspapers dubbed him 
Billy the Kid in the wake of his jailbreak. 
</P>
<P>
A year after the Kid's death, Garrett and ghostwriter Ash Upson published an 
"Authentic Life of Billy the Kid," a heavily embroidered tale that tainted most 
subsequent writing about the outlaw. 
</P>
<P>
In 1926, Chicago newsman Walter Noble Burns revived interest in the Kid when he 
wrote "The Saga of Billy the Kid," portraying him as an Old West Robin Hood. 
</P>
<P>
In Lincoln, where descendants of Sheriff Brady and other participants of the 
war still reside, questions about the Kid's conduct and who wronged whom during 
the deadly conflict are of more than academic interest. 
</P>
<P>
The village's three dozen or so adobe buildings, lining a quiet, 
juniper-studded canyon along the Rio Bonito, are little changed since the last 
century. Through the Lincoln County Heritage Trust, residents have established 
a walking tour and several museums that explore the area's rich history. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Ft. Sumner, a ranching town on the Pecos River 90 miles to the 
northeast, no garish billboards advertise the Kid's exploits. In fact, Lincoln 
has established an historical district that restricts all home remodeling and 
construction in the interest of authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of fraud in this business," says trust director Robert Hart. 
"There are lots of people trying to sell something." 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of "Young Guns," and seeking to promote serious scholarship about 
the Lincoln County War, Hart got the trust to sponsor a computer study of old 
photographs thought to be of the Kid. The trust holds in its collection the 
only authenticated photo of the outlaw, an 1879 tintype taken while he was at 
Ft. Sumner. 
</P>
<P>
The project, scheduled for completion in 1991, has already demolished the late 
Ollie "Brushy Bill" Roberts' claim to be the Kid. Roberts, who died in 1950 in 
the West Texas town of Hico, maintained Garrett had shot the wrong man. A 
computer comparison of Brushy Bill's and the Kid's facial features found few 
similarities, but that hasn't persuaded a small number of Brushy Bill 
die-hards, Hart says. 
</P>
<P>
Hart agrees with Utley's explanation for the public's continued fascination 
with the Kid: "You've got 180 degrees here," Hart says. "You've got Billy the 
angel and Billy the demonic killer."

<TEXT>
   A retired historian-author who has been
trying to prove that a Texan who died in 1950 was really Billy the
Kid said he'd like to see the identity decided by a federal court.
   William A. Tunstill said a recent photographic study comparing a
tintype of Billy the Kid and pictures of Ollie L. ``Brushy Bill''
Roberts failed to put the isue to rest.
   The study, part of a broader study undertaken by the Lincoln
County Historical Trust, concluded 41 other people in the
comparison looked more like Billy the Kid than ``Brushy Bill'' did.
   Roberts, who died in Hico, Texas, a week shy of his 90th
birthday in December 1950, had claimed to be the legendary New
Mexico outlaw. Most people, including a coroner's jury of the time,
say Sheriff Pat Garrett shot Billy the Kid to death in Fort Sumner,
N.M., on July 14, 1881.
   ``Brushy Bill died a Christian, but I'm not sure of those who
accuse him (of lying),'' Tunstill said.

<HEAD>Val Kilmer Plays a New Version of Billy the Kid</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Val Kilmer is well aware that he's part of a
long line of actors who have played the legendary outlaw Billy the
Kid.
   ``I think even James Cagney played him,'' said Kilmer.
   Actually, Cagney is one of the few who never played Billy the
Kid. Cagney was in ``The Oklahoma Kid,'' ``The Frisco Kid'' and
``The St. Louis Kid,'' but he never played Billy the Kid.
   Kilmer, best-known for his roles as Madmartigan in the George
Lucas myth-fantasy ``Willow'' and as the hotshot pilot Iceman in
the Tom Cruise hit ``Top Gun,'' turns in an intriguing performance
as William H. Bonney in the new Turner Network Telvision cable
movie ``Gore Vidal's Billy the Kid,'' premiering Wednesday.
   This latest retelling of the events of the Lincoln County war in
the New Mexico Territory and Billy's slaying at the age of 21 by
Sheriff Pat Garrett in 1881 is Vidal's attempt to make good on the
skewed vision of Bonney contained in the 1958 film ``The Left
Handed Gun.'' Based on a teleplay by Vidal, it starred Paul Newman.
   Others who have played Billy the Kid include Johnny Mack Brown,
Roy Rogers, Robert Taylor, Audie Murphy, Bob Steele, Buster Crabbe,
Kris Kristofferson, and Jack Buetel in ``The Outlaw,'' which
shocked in 1943 because of Jane Russell's cleavage. Most recently,
Bonney was played by Emilio Estevez in ``Young Guns.''
   ``Most writers find their finds in other mythical renditions of
the subject,'' said Kilmer. ``Gore is quite passionate about this.
He got squeezed out as producer of `The Left Handed Gun.' Actually,
Billy used both hands.
   ``I have a special interest, too, because my grandfather came
from Tennessee to mine gold in New Mexico when Lincoln County was
still wild. Once five men rode up to their mine, and my
grandfather's friends opened fire and killed them all.''
   If the new film doesn't beatify Billy, it does portray him as
immensely sympathetic. His story has been open to many
interpretations. Bonney's legend began when he was still alive and
was idolized as the epitome of the Western hero. Others considered
him a common cattle thief and psychopathic killer.
   Canadian Duncan Regehr plays Pat Garrett. The movie also stars
Wilford Brimley as New Mexico's territorial governor, Lew Wallace,
Ned Vaughn and Patrick Massett as Billy's young gang members, Julie
Carmen as his love interest and Michael Parks as a corrupt
prosecutor. Rene Auberjonois (``Benson'') has an offbeat role as a
poet-drunkard who shows up occasionally to comment on the tragedy
of Billy's life.
   ``What Billy represented and the reason for Gore's passion for
the character is that he had a force and a spirit that articulated
very dramatically that part of our history,'' said Kilmer. ``The
view of Billy as a psychopath is a prejudicial account based on Pat
Garrett's book.
   ``Billy was intelligent. He read history. His myth was very
powerful during his own life. You'd have to look at today's rock
stars for a comparison to the idolization he enjoyed. Pat Garrett
represented progress. Billy didn't want things to change, but he
did stand for something. He only became an outlaw, because they
tricked him into believing he would get amnesty (for the revenge
killing of a sheriff) from Gov. Wallace. Billy had a legitimate
cause.''
   Kilmer said he ``prayed real hard'' for the role, having been
disappointed when he missed out on the part in ``Young Guns.''
   ``Billy represents one man fighting alone. He was passionately
loyal to his friends and unrelenting against his enemies,'' he said.
   Kilmer is currently filming ``Kill Me Again'' in Nevada with his
wife, Joanne Whalley-Kilmer, who plays Christine Keeler in
``Scandal.''
   Like his cousin, the late Joyce Kilmer, famous for the poem
``Trees,'' Kilmer also writes poetry.
   ``I had a book of poetry published last year,'' he said. ``I
have a lap-top computer and I was compiling it and writing it in my
trailer during `Willow.' I'd write while I was in my muddy armor.''

OAKLAND BALLET'S 'BILLY THE KID' AT PEPPERDINE 
</P>

<P>
True, 'Billy the Kid" is a beloved icon of Americana. But that doesn't keep it 
from resembling a stylized puppet show. Especially when the stage, a perfect 
jewel-box setting like that of the Smothers Theatre at Pepperdine University in 
Malibu, cannot provide resonating space for the landmark dance semaphores that 
the late Eugene Loring originated 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
It was to this otherwise ideal platform that the Oakland Ballet brought its 
1976 production of "Billy" on Saturday, staged by the choreographer. Again, one 
had to marvel at his invention no less than his intent. 
</P>
<P>
But when Loring's gallery characters of the old West push across the plains to 
meet their destiny, they need a frame large enough to give dimension to their 
pronounced gestures, so clearly symbolic. And when Copland's miracle score, 
with its long lines of wistful tenderness, suggest distance and solitude, we 
want to see what we hear. 
</P>
<P>
The cast compensated, however. In the title role Michael Myers went from the 
truly bereft and horrified youngster who watched as his mother was shot down to 
the defensive outlaw forever marked by that attack. He made Billy Cagneyesque 
-- a small tough-guy, quick to retaliate. 
</P>
<P>
Towering above him was the square-jawed Ron Thiele as the friend, Pat Garrett. 
The size difference between them lent their eventual enmity a touch of pathos 
and underscored Billy's tragic alienation. Michael Lowe, as Alias, met his 
multi-character challenge convincingly and Patti Owen, in the Mother/Sweetheart 
roles stressed simplicity over preciousness. 
</P>
<P>
Other items showed the company to conventionally balletic advantage -- strong, 
supple, fluent and expressive.DONNA PERLMUTTER

KOLPIN IN 'BILLY THE KID' AT UCI FACULTY CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Joffrey Ballet, Dance Theatre of Harlem and Oakland Ballet each brought 
authoritative productions of "Billy the Kid" to Southern California in the past 
six weeks. But all too often, the leading dancer in Eugene Loring's 1938 
morality tale seemed miscast: Billy the Hunk, Billy the Prince, Billy the 
Weird. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Kid finally arrived: Alexander Kolpin of the Royal Danish 
Ballet, appearing as a stellar guest in a 50th anniversary staging at Loring's 
former home base, the Fine Arts Village Theater, UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Short, slender and coltish (he turned 24 Thursday), Kolpin not only looked 
ideally youthful, he danced with the hyperkinetic propulsion of a teen-ager in 
a big hurry. Moreover, he provided a number of sharp insights about the 
character's immaturity: Billy's intent, childlike fascination with the death of 
his victims, for instance, or his sudden pangs of loneliness just before the 
final encounter with Pat Garrett. Meet the Wild West's rebel without a cause. 
</P>
<P>
Kolpin had never danced the role anywhere until Wednesday, and inevitably there 
were unfinished details. However, his performance was obviously world class in 
its originality, eloquence, technique and sense of style. UCI students danced 
all the other roles, but their inexperience showed less in this gesture-based 
story ballet than in other pure-dance vehicles on the program. 
</P>
<P>
For the occasion, Patricia L. Whiteside -- who also supervised Donald 
Bradburn's staging of "Billy" -- mounted a production of Loring's last ballet, 
"Time Unto Time." 
</P>
<P>
Created in 1980 (two years before Loring's death), it resembled "Billy" in its 
imaginative expansion of realistic gestures into formal dance motifs, in its 
emphasis upon processional movement and individuals set against a corps, in the 
theme of a collective destiny. 
</P>
<P>
Danced to Bartok's Music for Strings, Percussion and Celeste, it developed this 
premise through situational rather than narrative structures: episodes for up 
to 15 dancers expressing wild anguish and equally desperate hope. A brooding, 
masterfully crafted work, it deserves to be better known. 
</P>
<P>
The evening also offered a shaky but promising run-through of Bournonville's 
"Flower Festival" pas de deux and two works by faculty choreographers: "Sing, 
Sing, Sing" (Donna France's slick, Broadway-style tap extravaganza to music by 
Duke Ellington) and "Nightfall" (Dianne Howe's weighty study of layered, formal 
choric motion to an original score by Paul Hodgins). 
</P>
<P>
The most accomplished of the student dancers included Eileen Ordonez (the 
Mother/Sweetheart in "Billy"), Erin Holmes (the leader in "Time Unto Time") and 
Peter Duerr (prominent in both Loring ballets). Canned music accompanied all 
the dances except "Nightfall." The program continues through Saturday. LEWIS

THE FILM: "Young Guns II" 
</P>
<P>
THE SCENE: Billy the Kid, played with gusto by Emilio Estevez, is chased across 
the New Mexico desert by Pat Garrett (played by William Petersen), formerly a 
cattle-rustling compatriot and now a well-dressed sheriff. It's the same old 
story with a sex-appeal spin. Billy's accompanied on this chase to the death by 
his band of Regulators -- Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Christian 
Slater (pictured), Balthazar Getty and Alan Ruck. They are the Team 
Testosterone. Their down-and-dirty appeal is enhanced by Dean Semler, the 
director of photography, who knows a few things about heroically depicting 
renegades, having done the "Mad Max" trilogy, and backed with songs by Jon Bon 
Jovi, who is no slouch when it comes to stirring young women into a fever of 
lust. 
</P>
<P>
THE LOOK: Estevez, Getty and Ruck are dressed prairie style -- bowler hats, 
lumpy wool pants, suspenders, muslin shirts and worn-out boots. Slater's 
character is an aspiring outlaw, Dave Rudabaugh, who would like the same 
notoriety as the Kid. He makes up for his lack of billing by strutting around 
in bad guy-black suede pants and a Stetson (pictured). Sutherland's Doc 
Scurlock wears a period tweed suit that evolves from natty to nasty as his 
character declines from poet and teacher to desperate gunslinger. Phillips as 
Chavez y Chavez wears an ethnic mix that reflects the character's 
Mexican-Indian heritage -- ponchos, feathers and a shearling vest that looks 
decidely as if it was tanned at home, in the tepee. 
</P>
<P>
The fashion victim of the film is Pat Garrett. He is given 50% of his bounty 
payment for capturing the Kid up-front and the first thing he does with his 
new-found wealth is buy new clothes. And such splendid clothes he buys: a black 
ottomon overcoat and a pinstripe three-piece suit. The vest even has jeweled 
buttons. Costume designer Judy Ruskin explained his peacock style, saying: "In 
my research, I found Pat Garrett was quite a fashion plate. He was always very 
well dressed and incredibly vain." 
</P>
<P>
THE LABELS: Ruskin had almost all of the wardrobe for the principals custom 
made, although some of the accessories were bought off the rack. Estevez's 
suspenders are from Perry Ellis Menswear and Getty's are from Cole-Haan. The 
black cowboy hat that Christian Slater wears carries the Outback Trading Co. 
label. Estevez's long-john shirt was also bought and then customized with a 
muslin placket for period authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
THE PAYOFF: So what if "Young Guns II" is a heavy-metal version of the 48-times 
told tale of Billy the Kid? These guys are a visual delight. GAILE ROBINSON

'BILLY THE KID,' JOFFREY STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, Times Dance Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "Billy the Kid," "Rodeo" and "Appalachian Spring" -- those enduring American 
dance milestones with classic Aaron Copland scores -- there are moments when 
the troubled central characters gaze across the frontier and all their 
yearnings, feelings of isolation, even their futures are reflected back in 
music of profound tenderness. 
</P>
<P>
This moment of expectancy and resignation is gloriously realized by Glenn 
Edgerton in the problematic new staging of "Billy the Kid" by the Joffrey 
Ballet, a staging introduced to local audiences Tuesday on a mixed bill at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
Edgerton has always been a notably thoughtful, imaginative dancer. And though 
his portrayal of Billy is otherwise multilayered and sharply defined, there are 
times when he wisely does nothing more than let the music flow over him, 
allowing Copland to express what Billy cannot. 
</P>
<P>
In this ballet, music is landscape, character, destiny -- so the dancer who can 
absorb it, make it his subtext, becomes the mythic outlaw in a way that can't 
be explained by acting alone. Edgerton understands: He is eloquent just 
listening. 
</P>
<P>
In "Billy the Kid," Eugene Loring told deeper truths than Agnes de Mille in 
"Rodeo" and aimed for a wider scope than Martha Graham in "Appalachian Spring," 
but, 50 years after its creation, his choreography seems most remarkable for 
its daring stylization -- its way of enlarging documentary details of behavior 
into bold social statements. 
</P>
<P>
Against Jared French's formal frieze of cacti, the ballet often looks like a 
'30s poster or mural come to life -- though, unfortunately, Patrice L. 
Whiteside's Joffrey production is often stronger on specifics of movement 
design than on dramatic thrust. We see Loring's innovations in stance and 
vocabulary lovingly reproduced, but somehow they seem disconnected from a 
dynamic concept. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the familiar American Ballet Theatre production, for example, the 
celebrated winning-of-the-West procession that opens and closes the ballet 
looked curiously static on Tuesday: full of the meticulously etched gesture and 
mime that ABT usually smudges, but utterly lacking in forward momentum. It's as 
if Manifest Destiny had bogged down somewhere east of Topeka. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was always the sensitivity and sardonic power of Edgerton -- 
though, ironically, he was not originally announced to dance the Tuesday 
performance (due to a scheduling error). 
</P>
<P>
As Alias, a composite of Billy's victims, Peter Narbutas deftly created a 
gallery of intriguing character sketches and, in the dual role of Billy's 
doomed mother and dream-sweetheart, Jodie Gates neatly balanced down-to-earth 
authority against otherworldly lyricism. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, Douglas Martin seemed pretty vacant as Pat Garrett (is that final salute 
to the former friend he has just murdered sincere, ironic or merely staged by 
Whiteside?). John Miner conducted with an emphasis on lush sonorities, but also 
with some odd tempos. 
</P>
<P>
The program (opening night of a seven-performance engagement in Segerstrom 
Hall) also included two company staples choreographed in the late 1970s: Paul 
Taylor's satiric "Cloven Kingdom" (originally created for Taylor's modern-dance 
ensemble) and Gerald Arpino's showpiece "Suite Saint-Saens." 
</P>
<P>
Using courtly music by Corelli interrupted by bursts of antic percussion 
composed by Henry Cowell and Malloy Miller, "Cloven Kingdom" contrasts elegant 
social pretense with galvanic, animalistic impulse. 
</P>
<P>
We're in a ballroom, we're in a disco, we're in the zoo. But we also may be on 
Parnassus as well, for who are those four women in their geometric, mirrored 
headdresses except Muses inspiring new and strange permutations in the group 
rituals? A very quirky work, full of defiantly idiosyncratic movement. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, "Suite Saint-Saens" is a very slick collage of bravura classical 
step-combinations, sequenced for a kind of random, impersonal dazzle. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen dancers constantly zoom through dappled light, punch out a virtuoso 
stunt and then leave as others arrive. You never have to worry about what it 
means and it only begins to bother you if you really like these dancers -- if 
you enjoy watching Leslie Carothers or Carole Valleskey or Edward Stierle and 
wish that Arpino was using them as artists rather than exclamation points. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, for the record, the Joffrey danced "Suite Saint-Saens" splendidly on 
Tuesday. Indeed, this may be the best company in the world at dignifying 
neoclassical kitsch. But, then, it's had more practice.

   Today is Saturday, July 14, the 195th day of 1990. There are 170
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On July 14, 1789, the French Revolution was in full swing as
citizens of Paris stormed the Bastille prison and released the
seven prisoners inside.
   On this date:
   In 1798, Congress passed the Sedition Act, making it a federal
crime to publish false, scandalous or malicious writing about the
United States government.
   In 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry relayed to Japanese officials a
letter from former President Fillmore, requesting trade relations.
   In 1881, outlaw William H. Bonney Jr., alias Billy the Kid, was
shot and killed by Sheriff Pat Garrett in Fort Sumner, N.M.
   In 1921, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were convicted in
Dedham, Mass., in the killing of a shoe company paymaster and his
guard. Sacco and Vanzetti were executed six years later.
   In 1958, the army of Iraq overthrew the monarchy.
   In 1966, eight student nurses were murdered by Richard Speck in
a Chicago dormitory.
   In 1976, Jimmy Carter won the Democratic presidential nomination
by an overwhelming margin at the party's convention in New York.
   In 1978, Soviet dissident Anatoly Shcharansky was convicted of
treasonous espionage and anti-Soviet agitation, and sentenced to 13
years at hard labor. Shcharansky was released in 1986.
   In 1983, two members of Congress, Illinois Republican Daniel
Crane and Massachusetts Democrat Gerry Studds, admitted having
sexual relations with congressional pages, and were later censured
by the full House.
   Ten years ago: The Republican national convention opened in
Detroit, where nominee-apparent Ronald Reagan told a welcoming
rally he and his supporters were determined to ``make America great
again.''
   Five years ago: Doctors at Bethesda Naval Hospital said
President Reagan was making a spectacular recovery from major
abdominal surgery to remove an intestinal growth that proved to be
cancerous.
   One year ago: Leaders of the seven richest nations opened a
summit in Paris, which was also celebrating the bicentennial of the
French Revolution with pomp and pageantry.

   Lou Diamond Phillips was thrown and
dragged by a horse during filming of ``Young Guns 2,'' and suffered
a broken arm that required 2{ hours of surgery, his publicist said.
   The Philippine-born actor, best known for his roles as singer
Ritchie Valens in ``La Bamba'' and as a defiant math student in
``Stand and Deliver,'' took the fall Friday evening when a noise
startled the horse, said publicist Eddie Michaels.
   Phillips, 28, was dragged across the former set of
``Silverado,'' which is being used in the ``Young Guns II'' sequel,
Michaels said.
   Phillips was airlifted to the University of New Mexico Hospital
in Albuquerque, where he underwent 2{ hours of surgery, Michaels
said. In addition to his broken arm, he suffered a gash on his knee.
   ``He was hurting a little bit but everything was real good as
far as his emotional state,'' Michaels said.
   The film is near the end of production and scenes that don't
require Phillips will be shot first, Michaels said.
   ``He won't be able to do anything for a while, but they'll do
everything they can around him at this point,'' he said.
   Cerrillos, a hamlet about 10 miles west of Galisteo, has been
transformed to represent old Lincoln, N.M., the scene of the bloody
Lincoln County War where Billy the Kid gained notoriety in the late
19th century.
   The ``Young Guns'' movies are based on the Billy the Kid story.
Phillips plays a half-Indian friend of Billy the Kid, played by
Emilio Estevez.
   Galisteo is about 20 miles south of Santa Fe.

   Corey Feldman, who is facing drug possession
charges, has thanked his fans for their support and urged them to
resist drugs.
   The 18-year-old actor is to be arraigned April 4 on two felony
counts of possession. Each count carries a maximum penalty of four
years in prison.
   Authorities said 25 balloons of heroin and cocaine were found in
his car during a March 9 traffic stop. He was released on $5,000
bail the next day.
   ``Corey wants to tell everyone who has been nice enough to wire
and call to keep the faith in him and in God and to stay away from
drugs in any way,'' his publicist, Michael Levine, said in a
statement Friday.
   Feldman has appeared in such films as ``Stand by Me,'' ``The
Goonies,'' ``Dream A Little Dream'' and ``The 'Burbs.''

   Jeff Conaway, who played the role of an
aspiring actor on the TV series ``Taxi,'' has been charged with
felony drunken driving after his car allegedly sideswiped and
injured a bicyclist.
   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office charged
Conaway on Friday with two counts of drunken driving and a
misdemeanor charge of giving false information to a police officer,
said deputy district attorney Allan S. Tyson.
   Prosecutors allege Conaway, 39, was speeding on a city street
when his sports car sideswiped bicyclist Farid Farhan, 31. Farhan
suffered a broken leg and a head wound needing 15 stitches in the
Feb. 23 accident.
   Tests indicated Conaway had a blood alcohol content of .15, or
nearly twice the state legal limit of .08, authorities said.
   Conaway was released on $2,500 bail, and is to be arraigned
April 5.
   He portrayed Bobby Wheeler, a frustrated actor waiting for his
big break. He left ``Taxi'' in 1981, about a year before the show
was canceled. Conaway also co-starred in the 1978 movie ``Grease''
with John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.

   Country singer Rose Maddox is staging a
concert April 1 to benefit her granddaughter, who fell into a coma
after being knocked down by a car last month but recently regained
consciousness.
   Maddox said she will perform with her band, Foggy Notion, and
three other groups at a benefit in nearby Medford to cover medical
expenses for 15-year-old Kelli Lynn Hale, whose family has no
medical insurance. The girl was struck by a car when she ran across
the street while looking for her cat.
   Maddox's career has spanned more than a half-century and earned
her induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville,
Tenn.
   The girl is making a steady recovery at a Medford hospital, said
Maddox.

   Jaime Escalante, the high school math teacher
whose career was profiled in the movie ``Stand and Deliver,'' says
he has changed his mind about leaving Garfield High School.
   The 59-year-old calculus instructor decided to remain for
another two years after receiving more than 500 letters and
telephone calls from former students and supporters.
   ``Everything is cool now,'' he said Friday. ``For the time
being, I will stay here. This is where I belong and the kids
appreciate what I do.''
   Escalante has taught at Los Angeles schools for 16 years. Last
month, he said he would resign because of frustration with parents
who in his view do not value academic achievement and a lack of
administrative support.
   One reason he is staying is the National Science Foundation
program he supervises at East Los Angeles College, he said. The
program teaches accelerated mathematics, science and English, and
trains teachers in Escalante's own methods.
   ``If I left the (high) school, I would lose my recruitment
network,'' Escalante said.
   Escalante said he had received several job offers over the past
three weeks, including unspecified opportunities in education
offered by President Bush and Gov. George Deukmejian.
   He received widespread attention in 1982 when all 18 of his
calculus students at an inner-city school passed national advanced
placement exams for college credit, and test administrators
challenged the results. Twelve students took the test a second time
and passed. The episode was portrayed in ``Stand and Deliver,''
starring Edward James Olmos as Escalante.

   Today is Friday, July 14, the 195th day of 1989. There are 170
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   Two hundred years ago, on July 14, 1789, citizens of Paris
stormed the Bastille prison and released the seven prisoners inside,
in the symbolic climax of the French revolution.
   On this date:
   In 1798, Congress passed the Sedition Act, making it a federal
crime to publish false, scandalous or malicious writing about the
United States government.
   In 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry relayed to Japanese officials a
letter from former President Millard Fillmore, requesting trade
relations.
   In 1881, outlaw William H. Bonney Jr., alias ``Billy the Kid,''
was shot and killed by Sheriff Pat Garrett in Fort Sumner, N.M.
   In 1921, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were convicted in
Dedham, Mass., in the killing of a shoe company paymaster and his
guard. (Sacco and Vanzetti were executed six years later.)
   In 1958, the army of Iraq overthrew the monarchy.
   In 1966, eight student nurses were murdered by Richard Speck in a
Chicago dormitory.
   In 1976, Jimmy Carter won the Democratic presidential nomination
by an overwhelming margin at the party's convention in New York.
   In 1978, Soviet dissident Anatoly Shcharansky was convicted of
treasonous espionage and anti-Soviet agitation, and sentenced to 13
years at hard labor. (Shcharansky was released in 1986.)
   In 1982, the National League scored a 4-1 victory over the
American League in Montreal for its 11th straight All-Star triumph,
and 19th in 20 years.
   In 1983, two members of Congress, Illinois Republican Daniel
Crane and Massachusetts Democrat Gerry Studds, admitted having
sexual relations with Congressional pages, and were later censured
by the full House.
   In 1986, a federal judge in Los Angeles sentenced Richard W.
Miller _ the only FBI agent ever convicted of espionage _ to two
life terms plus 50 years in prison for spying for the Soviet Union.
   In 1987, the National League took 13 innings to defeat the
American League, 2-0, in the 58th All-Star Game in Oakland, Calif.
   Ten years ago: President Jimmy Carter ended his 10-day domestic
summit at Camp David, Md., and returned to the White House to
prepare a speech for the next evening.
   Five years ago: New Zealand's Labor Party, led by David Lange,
won a landslide election victory, ending conservative Prime Minister
Robert Muldoon's nine-year tenure.
   One year ago: Speaking before the U.N. Security Council, Iranian
Foreign Minister Ali-Akbar Velayati denounced the U.S. downing of an
Iranian jetliner over the Persian Gulf on July 3 as ``a barbaric
massacre.'' Vice President Bush replied that the USS Vincennes had
fired in self-defense.

MUSIC AND DANCE / CHRIS PASLES: FEW IN 'BILLY THE KID' AUDIENCE KNEW OF 
DANCER'S PAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few in the audience who saw Alexander Kolpin dance the title role of Eugene 
Loring's "Billy the Kid" for the first time last week at UC Irvine knew the 
physical pain he was in. 
</P>
<P>
A muscle tear and stress fracture in the shin that he endured for almost a year 
and a half finally sent the principal dancer and rising star with the Royal 
Danish Ballet to the operating room in May. 
</P>
<P>
It also knocked him out of a tour with some of his Danish colleagues who will 
appear Sunday at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Kolpin's doctor had allowed him to dance Billy because the role does not 
require the airy jumps and intricate foot-beats characteristic of the Danes' 
Bournonville style. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been quite painful and still is and it swells a lot," Kolpin said in a 
recent interview. He said he was "on a lot of (pain) pills" while dancing at 
UCI, but otherwise was all right. 
</P>
<P>
He said he needed to dance to find out if the corrective surgery would "hold or 
not hold." 
</P>
<P>
"Also, it's very mental. You get scared, so you block. What happens after 
having an injury for so many months, you just start living with the pain and 
the fear. So you really cannot judge when it hurts and when it's sore. It's 
really scary. 
</P>
<P>
"At some point, you have to get beyond being frightened of doing anything. 
Yeah, I'm frightened. Whenever I feel just a little thing, (I think), OK, now 
the whole thing is going to break again." 
</P>
<P>
Although the surgery is now behind him, Kolpin anticipates "a lot of pain for 
the next year and swelling of the bone and all that." 
</P>
<P>
Kolpin, who turned 24 on Thursday, paused long and thoughtfully before 
answering what it was like to work with the UCI students. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult," he said. "They have been so nice, really very, very nice. 
It's always hard, because you see, if I go and dance with the Boston Ballet, a 
professional company, you pull each other up. But for me, I don't really have 
so much support in the other dancers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not talking about (their) not being engaged in it. But they're not at a 
very high technical level." 
</P>
<P>
Kolpin, however, thought it was his duty to interact strongly with them. 
</P>
<P>
"If you come and do a pas de deux, it's no problem," he said. "But if you come 
and do a ballet like this, you have to relate to the persons who are there on 
stage or else it's not going to work. I'm just going to seem out of place. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the most important thing -- to relate to the people that you dance with 
on stage. . . . Art is not personal exposure and showoff of yourself." 
</P>
<P>
That was a lesson he tried to convey to the students who danced the pas de deux 
from Bournonville's "Flower Festival in Genzano" on the program. 
</P>
<P>
"Those dancers very much danced to the audience, and I said, forget that. This 
is not a Russian pas de deux, (in which) one comes in and dances and runs out. 
. . . This is a pas de deux, which means step for two. So you're dancing for 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
"You're just lovers taking a walk in the woods. You dance for your lover. . . . 
'Oh, you look so gorgeous, now I want to dance for you. You look beautiful. We 
cannot stop it.' That's what I tried to get the idea for them. . . . The 
audience just happens to be there that night." 
</P>
<P>
Such an attitude does not rule out the unexpected, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe it's very exciting when you go on stage and unpredictable things 
happen," he said. "I really get excited by chance." 
</P>
<P>
Several such "chances" happened on opening night. 
</P>
<P>
A left-hander, he made the mistake of stealing the jailer's gun with his right 
hand, then shooting him with his left. So he had to improvise a quick change to 
account for the difference. Few people noticed. 
</P>
<P>
He also got ahead of the music in his first solo, he said, and simply doubled 
Billy's quick back-and-forth paranoid turns. 
</P>
<P>
When one of the other characters couldn't make his entrance on time because he 
was still adjusting his costume, Kolpin had to improvise by riding around the 
stage a few extra times, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another improvisation included kissing one of the Mexican Girls after they 
shielded him from a posse. 
</P>
<P>
"All that (improvisatory) stuff -- that makes the ballet move, that makes it 
live, that makes it exciting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kolpin was 11 when he decided to follow his sister to a dance class. "I just 
went to watch one day, and I thought it was strange there were no boys," he 
said. "So I said to my mother that I wanted to attend the classes." 
</P>
<P>
A year later, his teacher recommended that he audition for the Royal Danish 
Ballet. But his parents weren't sure that he was serious enough and recommended 
another year of study. By then, although he had passed the company's age limit 
of 11 for its school, his teacher, once a principal with the Danes, worked out 
an arrangement, and after a while he was accepted into the school. 
</P>
<P>
"What was so nice for me was I had no ambitions when I started," Kolpin said. 
"I just thought it was nice to move. I was crazy about moving and using my 
body, whatever it was -- soccer, running. I've always been very energetic. And 
very hyper. I am very hyper." 
</P>
<P>
He became a principal dancer 18 months ago and was injured shortly afterward. 
Being a member of the Danish Ballet gives him job security, however. 
</P>
<P>
"In New York, if somebody gets an injury, well, you're just history, you're 
out," he said. But his status with the Danes would allow him a retirement 
pension if his injury would sideline him permanently, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, that does not appear to be the case, and he has begun discussing a 
possible return to UCI next summer to stage and dance in the third act of 
Bournonville's "Napoli," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Kolpin said he does not eat, sleep and breathe ballet. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm not at the company, I do so many other things. I read and I surf and 
I like to listen to music. And I like to build things. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important when you're a dancer, you shouldn't go home and sit and 
read your Dance Magazine and do your slippers and talk with your ballet friends 
and watch the ballet video because you're just going to die. Your art is going 
to dry up very slowly."

   Film: Dustin Hoffman as a '30s Gangster
   ----
   By Julie Salamon

<LP>
   The novelist E.L. Doctorow sees history as the interplay
of fact and magic. He builds his novels mixing what he's read
about the past with what his imagination senses might have
taken place. So when he decided to write about the Jewish
American gangsters of the 1930s in "Billy Bathgate," he
created a magical kid to narrate his story.
   His Billy, writing from the point of view of a grown man
remembering his past, was infatuated by Dutch Schultz, saw
him as his ticket out of the Bronx and on to the American
dream. Told as reminiscence, Billy's story of hope and
disillusionment has a nostalgic tone. He's recalling himself
as a poor young man blessed with all kinds of gifts, a kid
with luck who eventually understands that he's spent his
cunning charm winning over an evil man who isn't glamorous at
all. Billy never lets on how he's chosen to use that life
lesson, for good or for bad.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Director Robert Benton and screenwriter Tom Stoppard have
remained faithful to the idea behind the Doctorow book and
yet somehow lost its spirit. The production design is
stately, the actors are intelligent and so is the script.
Despite the obvious care and thought that went into it -- or
maybe because there was too much of it -- the movie feels
mummified, like an expensive apartment that's been put
together by an expensive interior decorator. It's all very
beautiful and very tasteful, but no one seems to live there.
   The problem is that Billy is and isn't the main character.
In the book, he comes alive as he filters his impressions of
Dutch Schultz and his henchmen. Though it takes quick wits
and guts for him to insinuate himself into Schultz's inner
circle, he watches and learns and manages to stay out of the
line of fire.
   The problem this poses for the film makers, which they
never really solve, is that Billy frequently seems like an
unnecessary extra that the camera keeps turning to for
reaction shots. The fault doesn't lie with Loren Dean, the
winning young actor who plays Billy. He has the face and the
sensibility of the kid Billy was, or thinks he was -- the
naive bravado and earnestness. His face makes you want to
understand that Billy isn't a rebel at all. He's climbing on
board Schultz's murderous enterprise with a sense of purpose.
This is the way up and out.
   But the face isn't enough. The dark undercurrent in
Billy's behavior never really emerges. Too often we watch him
watching without the benefit of seeing what he is thinking.
The film makers rely too much on his face, just as they rely
too much on the sleek production design. Everything's too
respectable. Even Mark Isham's music lacks the composer's
characteristic jazzy feel. The score is so lushly jaunty that
Billy's story sometimes feels like a straightforward telling
of Horatio Alger in gangland.
   The movie opens with Billy jumping onto a tugboat carting
Bo Weinberg out to sea, his feet stuck in cement. Billy
watches in horror as Schultz quietly sentences his former
close friend to death and drags away his girlfriend. Bruce
Willis's Bo looks appropriately stricken, and everything is
set for a gripping start.
   But the camera turns to Billy watching Bo and the
immediacy is dispelled right from the start. Weinberg seems
to be an apparition and so does his misery. Then the picture
flashes back to Billy's first meeting with Schultz in the
Jewish Bronx of the '30s.
   It's pleasant to look at the film maker's re-creation of
the Bronx -- both the bustle of the streets as well as the
satiny interiors of Dutch's nightclubs downtown. But the
exterior perfection soon wears thin. It's a kind of
coffeetable-book film making.
   In the book, Dutch Schultz wasn't so much a person as an
idea -- Billy's idea of success (and a metaphor for
capitalism run amok). Dustin Hoffman adds flesh to the idea
-- and much blood, when Dutch erupts periodically in fits of
rage. He isn't operatic, like Robert De Niro's Al Capone in
"The Untouchables." He should be even scarier, a
mild-mannered nebbish who casually beats someone's head in
when he's displeased. It's a subtle and thoughtful
performance, maybe too subtle. Mr. Hoffman's Dutch melts into
the atmosphere.
   The movie comes to life in the middle, when Nicole Kidman
takes center stage. Ms. Kidman, the Australian actress best
known here as Tom Cruise's wife, is just wonderful as Drew
Preston, the rich married woman who amuses herself by having
affairs with gangsters. She slips easily from Bo's bed to
Dutch's, but saves her real energy for Billy.
   Ms. Kidman gets across the boredom that makes Drew ready
for anything. She's young but not girlish. She's Billy minus
the innocence. When Schultz moves his entourage to Saratoga
while he waits to fight a tax evasion charge in a friendly
court, the focus turns on Drew. In these scenes the story
takes on the mischief and menace that is missing everywhere
else, mainly because Billy is doing something rather than
watching.
   Oddly enough in this grandly conceived production, the
picture gets its basic resonance in a simple way, from a
minor character, Otto Berman the bookkeeper (Steven Hill),
who masks his evil with a veneer of niceness and honor. This
marvelous actor captures the book's play of dark and light
better than anyone or anything else.
   ---
   VIDEO TIP: Robert Benton had a far more interesting take
on gangsters when he co-wrote "Bonnie and Clyde" in 1967,
before gangster lore had been stultified into a film cliche.

<LEADPARA>  A modern-day Billy the Kid wanted for alleged kidnapping and cattle rustling
is back on the loose after he and two other men escaped from the Santa Cruz
County Jail on Friday night.;    A statewide search was mounted Saturday for
Brett Miller, 26, who along with John Bolander, 35, and Danny Atkinson, 22,
scaled a 15-foot wall and tore through a chain-link fence to break out of the
jail.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  OUTLAW, TWO OTHERS ESCAPE FROM SANTA CRUZ
JAIL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Miller, whose rap sheet goes back to his days as a young Watsonville
outlaw, was being held for violating probation. He also is charged with
kidnapping a bank manager in San Luis Obispo County and a host of cattle
rustling counts in the San Joaquin Valley. It was Miller's second escape from
the jail and at least his third from custody.;    Bolander, a Scotts Valley
resident, was being held in a child-molestation case. Atkinson, of Santa Cruz,
faces a weapons charge.;    The three men escaped at about 5:55 p.m. during
the evening meal from an enclosed patio area in the jail, said Sgt. Craig
Little of the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Department.;    The prisoners scaled
the patio wall, probably by helping each other, Little said. They then tore
through an overhead chain-link screen and scrambled across a roof and over a
perimeter fence, setting off a detector alarm on the fence.;    The men were
last seen by a security camera running north along the San Lorenzo River.
Members of the sheriff's department and the California Highway Patrol combed
the river through the night.;    Miller, who Little said was "somewhat of an
escape risk," had been placed under maximum security. Little said he was not
aware of any connection between Miller and the other escapees, and that the
three had not been placed close together in the jail.;    Miller, who grew up
in Watsonville and had been living under an assumed name in a trailer near
Santa Margarita in San Luis Obispo County, was picked up last month by
deputies who wanted to talk to him about the probation violation, the
kidnapping and the cattle thefts.;    The San Luis Obispo County posse found
Miller hidden under the lid of an almost-full water tank sunk in the ground
near his trailer.;    Sheriff's detective Mike Sheridan said Miller and some
associates were wanted in connection with the April 12 kidnapping of Rita Kaye
Roy, 47, of Templeton. He said the woman, operations manager of the Bank of
America branch in Atascadero, was robbed of her bank keys, then was freed in a
remote area, where she walked to a farmhouse and notified authorities.
Sheridan said Miller and his gang had planned on robbing the bank.;    The
cattle rustling, said a Merced County sheriff's investigator, involved calves
stolen late at night from dairies in Stanislaus and Merced counties and sold
at livestock markets around the state.;    In Santa Cruz County, Miller's
criminal history stretches back almost a decade. He once was charged with
conspiracy to kidnap the manager of a Watsonville bank, and with attempting to
extort $500,000 from a prominent Watsonville family.;    In a plea bargain in
that case, Miller entered a guilty plea to the extortion attempt and to
conspiracy to commit robbery, a charge stemming from the alleged plot to
kidnap the banker -- the same scheme Miller is charged with in the San Luis
Obispo kidnapping.;    Miller was sentenced to 12 years in prison on those
charges and several other felonies, including assault. Under state guidelines,
the actual sentence was more like 4 1/2 years, Santa Cruz County District
Attorney Art Danner said.;    "We tried to put him away for as long as we
could," Danner said. "Our prediction, which has proven true, was that he was
going to commit more crimes at every opportunity.";    One deputy recalled
that Miller kept a flock of illegal fighting cocks in a motor home parked in
Watsonville, and once was found in a Southern California motel room with an
arsenal of assault weapons and the body of a friend who had overdosed on
drugs.;    "The kid's a classic," Tony Salatich, a lawyer who defended Miller
in his earlier kidnapping and extortion cases, has said. "I think he sees a
movie of himself running in his head. He sees himself as being somewhere
between Billy the Kid and Bonnie and Clyde.";    Miller first escaped from the
Santa Cruz County Jail in 1986, where he was being held on an extortion charge
and where he set his mattress on fire. He also disappeared from a sheriff's
van at the Watsonville courthouse annex the previous year.;    And as a youth
wanted on several warrants, he fled pursuing officers by jumping into the
Pajaro River.  </TEXT>

   Aaron Copland, the immigrants' son from Brooklyn
who used jazz rhythms of the South, folk songs of Appalachia and
cowboy tunes of the prairie to create classical music that was
unmistakably American, has died at 90.
   The composer, who lived in Peekskill, died Sunday at Phelps
Memorial Hospital in North Tarrytown of pneumonia. He had suffered
two strokes recently.
   The ``dean of American music'' created such classics as
``Appalachian Spring,'' ``Rodeo,'' ``Billy the Kid'' and ``Lincoln
Portrait.'' Leonard Bernstein once called Copland's 1942 orchestral
composition ``Fanfare for the Common Man'' the ``all-time top of
the hit parade in American music.''
   The son of Eastern European immigrants, he strove to be more
American than most Americans and sought to focus the international
spotlight on his fellow American composers.
   ``He put American music on the map. He decided that there should
be an American sound, a place for the American composer,'' Vivian
Perlis, who collaborated with the composer on his 1984 memoir,
``Copland,'' said Sunday.
   Copland wrote two operas, six ballets and eight film scores,
including his Oscar-winning music for William Wyler's ``The
Heiress'' in 1948.
   He won a Pulitzer Prize in 1945 for the ballet ``Appalachian
Spring,'' based on a Shaker melody played by a clarinet. It was
choreographed by Martha Graham.
   His ballets ``Billy the Kid'' in 1938 and ``Rodeo'' in 1942 make
use of cowboy tunes and folk songs.
   Other works included the score for ``The Red Pony,'' the 1949
movie based on the novel by John Steinbeck, and ``Lincoln
Portrait,'' music performed with narration inspired by the writings
of Lincoln biographer Carl Sandburg.
   The Jewish boy from New York who learned to write
cowboy-inspired classical music didn't even travel to the West
until he was 28.
   ``I preferred to imagine being on a horse without actually
getting on one!'' he once said.
   William Schuman, who with Bernstein and Copland formed what
Schuman called a triumvirate of American composers, said, ``Copland
believed in the validity of American music, that we were not
inferior to our European cousins.''
   ``He created the American sound in symphonic music,'' said
Schuman.
   Both Bernstein and Copland ``wanted to incorporate popular music
into concert music. They always wanted the music to be in contact
with people,'' said composer Elliott Carter.
   Copland's storekeeper parents initially were reluctant to pay
for music lessons. ``My parents were of the opinion that enough
money had been invested in the musical training of the four older
children, with meager results,'' he recalled.
   But his persistence prevailed, and Copland eventually studied in
Paris with Nadia Boulanger and sold a composition, ``The Cat and
the Mouse,'' for $32.50.
   ``To finally see my music printed means more to me than any
debut in Carnegie Hall,'' he wrote home.
   In 1925, Boulanger, on organ, premiered ``Symphony for Organ and
Orchestra'' in New York as part of her U.S. debut.
   Afterward, Copland recalled, conductor Walter Damrosch addressed
the audience: ``Ladies and gentlemen, I am sure you will agree that
if a gifted young man can write a symphony like this at 23 ...
within five years he will be ready to commit murder.''
   With such jazz-inspired creations as ``Piano Concerto'' in 1926,
Copland once recalled, ``I felt I had gone to the extreme of where
jazz could take me, the audiences and critics in Boston all thought
I had gone too far.''
   During a trip to the West, Copland heard the piece being hissed
during rehearsal and again in concert at the Hollywood Bowl.
   But he forged on, experimenting with even more complex rhythms.
   ``Symphonic Ode,'' which premiered in 1932, was so difficult
conductor Serge Koussevitzky told Copland it took an hour to
rehearse three bars.
   Then, in 1936, Copland did a musical about-turn - to a simpler,
folk-based style in ``El Salon Mexico,'' inspired by a visit to
Mexico City. The work was followed in 1942 by ``Rodeo,'' which
launched Agnes DeMille's dancing career.
   Copland, who never married, is survived by several nieces and
nephews.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

<DESCRIPT>  MAN; ESCAPE; SANTA-CRUZ; COUNTY; JAIL  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Watsonville desperado Brett Miller, who escaped from the Santa Cruz County
Jail last June, left his calling card in Healdsburg a few weeks later,
according to authorities.;    Miller, 26, whose lengthy rap sheet includes
charges of kidnapping, robbery, cattle-rustling and extortion,  apparently
tried to rob a bank in the Sonoma County town on July 30. The unsuccessful
holdup attempt closely resembled at least two other bank robbery schemes --
neither of which paid off -- hatched by Miller.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  OUTLAW LINKED TO HOLDUP BID
ESCAPEE IDENTIFIED BY BANK EMPLOYEE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     According to Healdsburg police, Miller and another man broke into the
Security Pacific National Bank branch sometime during the night and were on
hand when the first employee arrived on July 30. The woman was confronted by a
man carrying a pistol, said Detective Kevin Young.;    Bank procedure calls
for the employee unlocking the bank to signal her fellow workers, waiting
outside in a parking lot, that everything inside is OK, said the detective.
But when Miller allowed the woman to go to the bank door, she waved --
signaling her co-workers that something was wrong.;    Two bandits escape from
police;    While another employee ran to a nearby telephone, a co- worker
pulled the woman from the bank, Young said. Meanwhile, the two bandits inside
fled through the back door and escaped from police, who arrived on the scene
about a minute later and began a search of the neighborhood.;    Miller's name
was linked to the attempted stickup in Healdsburg after the bank employee and
a police artist came up with a drawing of the man who had held a gun on her. A
San Luis Obispo County detective, who read a Teletype message about the failed
robbery attempt, sent a photo of Miller to Young.;    "The resemblance to the
man in the drawing was startling," Young said. He said the woman subsequently
identified Miller from a photo lineup.;    It was not Miller's first
successful attempt to elude the law.;    He has escaped from Santa Cruz County
Jail twice, most recently on June 14, when he and two other men, now back in
custody, scaled a 15-foot-high wall and tore down a chain-link fence before
vanishing. Another time, he fled from a sheriff's van at the courthouse annex
in Watsonville. As a youth, Miller escaped officers seeking to arrest him on
several warrants by fleeing into the Pajaro River.;    Modern-day Billy the
Kid;    Miller, who apparently fancies himself a modern-day Billy the Kid, was
being held on charges involving cattle-rustling and an attempted bank robbery
in Atascadero at the time of his most recent escape in Santa Cruz. He had been
apprehended near his trailer home in San Luis Obispo County after being fished
out of a cistern by deputies on his trail.;    They wanted him for the
kidnapping of a Templeton woman who was operations manager for the Bank of
America in Atascadero. According to authorities in San Luis Obispo, Miller was
suspected of taking bank keys from the woman, then freeing her in a remote
area. She walked to a nearby farmhouse and phoned the sheriff.;    The
cattle-rustling charges grew out of the thefts of calves in Merced and
Stanislaus counties. Young also said Miller is suspected of trying to sell
stolen cattle in Sonoma County.;    In a Watsonville case, Miller was
convicted after being charged with conspiring to kidnap the manager of a local
bank and of attempting to extort $500,000 from a prominent Pajaro Valley
family.  </TEXT>

Do the characters from Westerns have a life off-screen? Not just the easy ones, 
Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson, the hanging Judge Roy Bean and Billy the Kid and 
Pat Garrett -- everyone knows they really lived, before myth wrapped round them 
like kudzu. 
</P>
<P>
But how about "Red River's" Matthew Garth and "The Searchers' " Ethan Edwards; 
how about Ransom Stoddard and Tom Doniphon and Liberty Valance from "The Man 
Who Shot Liberty Valance," or James Averill and Nate Champion from "Heaven's 
Gate"? Screenwriters created them; actors inhabited them; directors browbeat or 
cajoled them into their particular vision. Did they fade away when the 
projectors stopped? 
</P>
<P>
Not for David Thomson. To him they are as real as John Wayne's sweat-stained 
Stetson, and their women are too. So for "Silver Light," Thomson's intricate, 
hypnotic history/romance about the Old West and how we have come to perceive 
it, he dips into the pool of common movie experience and into his own 
imagination equally, ladling out characters who are a brash mixture of both. 
</P>
<P>
Thus one of the pillars of his story is Susan Garth, who in the 1950s is 80 
years old, a possibly great undiscovered photographer. It is her memories that 
carry the narrative back to the 1860s. She lives in splendid isolation at 
Arizona's Canyon de Chelly, near Monument Valley, the most movie-exploited land 
in the world. And although no one will be blamed for reading a little of 
Georgia O'Keeffe into Susan Garth's character, she is actually the daughter of 
the movies' Matthew Garth, forever and indelibly Montgomery Cliff in "Red 
River," and he will become a central character on these pages as well. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is Susan Garth's lifelong friend, Bark Blaylock, wholly created by 
Thomson. He's a journalist, writer, young witness to the death of Billy the Kid 
and part-time technical adviser on Hollywood Westerns, who may have been the 
son of Wyatt Earp. Or Bat Masterson. Or the cowboy "Curly Bill" Brocius. All of 
them real enough Westerners. 
</P>
<P>
Nora Stoddard, the provocative, prescient young Santa Fe museum curator who 
discovers Susan Garth, seems to be at the book's center. Much of the 
present-day story is concerned with the attraction that springs up between the 
well-born Nora and James Averill II, the 50-year-old, casually philandering 
Eastern philanthropist who heads the Averill Foundation, to which Nora applies 
for backing of a show of Susan Garth's work. 
</P>
<P>
(And if the first James Averill was played by Kris Kristofferson in "Heaven's 
Gate," Nora carries an equally heavy movie heritage. Her father was the late 
Sen. Ransom Stoddard, a.k.a. James Stewart, who did or did not shoot Liberty 
Valance in the movie of nearly the same name.) 
</P>
<P>
To Thomson's wide-ranging, sometimes arcane cast of film characters throw in 
Charles Ives, on the occasion of the first performance of his "Three Places in 
New England"; Willa Cather; alto-sax great Wardell Grey and Erich von Stroheim, 
hard at work on "Greed" in the furnaces of the desert. 
</P>
<P>
This technique, mixing and matching real and fictional characters, has been a 
staple of E. L. Doctorow's; Gore Vidal pioneered a similar sort of legerdemain 
years ago, but Thomson's movie-critic credentials lead him to draw primarily 
from films. He played a simpler version of this game once before, with 
"Suspects." There he prowled in and out of the lives of more than 80 movie 
characters, filling in details of their lives off-screen with the fevered 
imagination of an over-the-moon movie buff. 
</P>
<P>
"Silver Light" is more ambitious than "Suspects," harder to sustain, with a 
panoramic narrative that whips us back and forth in time. For the most part 
it's done dexterously, although when one of the characters, referring to some 
mischief Wyatt Earp is up to, says, "I believe he has done for some of those 
boys. There are bodies in the corral," there is an almost irresistible impulse 
to shout, "OK!!" if only to show that we're paying attention. 
</P>
<P>
The writing, admittedly, strays into the purple and the unintentionally silly 
at moments: Averill with Nora in bed, "looking down on the closed eyes of Nora 
Stoddard, and on the hills of her, all blindly witnessing him," or 15-year-old 
Sally Averill hearing her first Charlie Parker, live, in 1950: "She cannot stop 
moving to the music, keep up, keep on, the beat, bop. She notices that her body 
keeps the bass time . . . while her fingers and her hands are playing out the 
notes of the saxophones and the vibraphone." Busy girl. 
</P>
<P>
However this is more than balanced by the book's Byzantine and eventually 
seductive design and characters, so deftly and imaginatively interwoven that 
finally there is nothing left to do but surrender to them. 
</P>
<P>
To the astringent Susan Garth, and Thomson's wonderful sequence in an abandoned 
silver mine in which her own image imprints itself on a piece of silver left 
behind by a miner -- and photography as her calling is as deeply imprinted on 
the young girl. 
</P>
<P>
To a masterly thunderstorm sequence, after which young Bark Blaylock fords the 
Pecos river on horseback. 
</P>
<P>
And to a picaresque subplot about Jack Chance, a sweet-natured young 
middleweight managed by Blaylock, who must be goaded to anger to fight, and 
Bark's scheme to get him mad by flirting with Chance's widowed mother. One can 
put up with a bit of purple, when the rewards are this good. 
</P>
<P>
Sensibly, the novel doesn't demand that we have the author's passion for its 
movies, or even know all of them. (The discovery of an index at the end of the 
book to every film character was an enormous relief.) Obviously it makes a 
novelist's job easier when a character is called Ethan Edwards, and when John 
Wayne shimmers to mind, doggedly searching through the years for a child 
carried off by Comanches. 
</P>
<P>
But if "The Searchers" isn't in our memory banks, "Silver Light" still works. 
Thomson remains true to Ethan Edwards, or to Wayne's image of him as stamped by 
John Ford, who will flicker into the story briefly too, as one of two 
curmudgeonly directors, "Jack" and "Howard" (Hawks). 
</P>
<P>
Curious, Thomson follows "The Searchers' " characters after the film leaves 
them. What would have happened to Deborah, the young woman Ethan Edwards 
rescued after more than a decade with the Comanches, half-deranged with not 
knowing what people she belonged to. The book imagines Deborah's later child, 
beautiful, headstrong and not a little spooked by her mother's history. This is 
Sharon Pawley, who will become the love of both Bark and Susan's life, a 
natural magnet for a movie camera and the star of Bark's primitive version of 
"Tess of the D'Urbervilles," shot in 1915 in Northern California, with none 
other than Susan Garth behind the camera. 
</P>
<P>
Can't remember that silent film? Ah, that's because of the chicanery of Noah 
Cross, decades before his appearance in "Chinatown," in the person of John 
Huston. It's another of the interlocking bits that makes "Silver Light" the 
treasure hunt that it is. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing predictable about the book is that it won't make a great movie. 
It already has -- about a dozen of them.

complicated, basically. . . . You want to get down the hill without falling
down."  </CAPTION>
<DESCRIPT>  SKIING; GUIDELINE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  AT 48, Billy Kidd is one of the premier ski instructors in the country. His
clientele in Steamboat Springs, Colo., has ranged from former rodeo star Larry
Mahan to Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca.;   Kidd, silver medalist in the men's
slalom in the 1964 Winter Olympics, took time recently to give some
suggestions on how skiers can improve.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Venture  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  KIDD OFFERS HIS TOP 10 TIPS FOR BETTER SKIING  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Venture -- Celebrating the Active Life  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Kidd's top 10 recommendations:;   1. Take lessons -- True, it might be
self-serving, but Kidd was steadfast. "Most people, intermediates or better,
think lessons are only for beginners," he said. "Well, Jack Nicklaus has his
coach, and so does Jimmy Connors. The top athletes all do. If you want to
improve, it's nice to read how in newspapers. But also take lessons.";   2.
Round off turns -- That's why Alberto Tomba and Marc Giardelli fly down the
hills, Kidd said. There's a lesson there for everyone. "The No. 1 way to
improve your skiing -- if you're a first-time skier or you're close to making
the U.S. ski team -- is to make rounder turns," Kidd said. "No matter how well
you ski now, you can still work on rounding out your turns. If you do that,
you use less energy, you're less likely to fall down, you carve turns
better.";   3. Think circular -- "Think of a turn as part of a circle," he
said. "As you go around the circle, put all your weight on your outside ski,
the one on the outside of the circle.";   4. Keep feet flexible -- Austrian
skiers in the 1950s kept their feet close together, but Frenchman Jean Claude
Killy punctuated the '60s with less-restrictive feet placement. "By keeping
your feet apart, and by getting all that weight on the outside ski, and by
purposely lifting the inside ski in order to do it -- all that makes you hold
much better on ice," Kidd said.;   5. Avoid too much shoulder rotation on
turns -- "When you (do that), you can't make the next turn back in a hurry
because you've locked up," Kidd said. "Watch good mogul or slalom skiers, who
have to make one turn every second for 60 seconds. They don't turn their
shoulders. It's too slow. So keep your shoulders facing straight downhill and
just turn your feet.";   6. Plant pole and turn -- "If you train yourself to
always start your turn with a pole plant, that's the physical and
psychological beginning of your turn," Kidd said. "Watch really good bump
(mogul) skiers. The way they time their turns is with the pole plant. You say,
'I want to start my turn here, and then you plant your pole. Then right here,
and you plant your pole. And here. And here.";   7. Be patient -- Meaning,
among other things, that you shouldn't rush your turns. "Most beginners and a
lot of intermediates rush their turns at the beginning," Kidd said. "Then you
make your skis skid, and you have trouble on ice, and you hit a frozen clump
of snow and you're upside down.";   8. Curtail upper-body movement -- "If you
want to turn quicker, try to keep your upper body very quiet, so you use your
skis and feet and knees to turn your skis," Kidd said. "As an intermediate
skier, if you want to keep your balance better, and keep your upper body
quiet, keep your hands out to the side like a tightrope-walker.;   "If you
watch Franz Heinzer winning the gold medal in the Olympic downhill, he's
fighting to keep his hands out in front to decrease wind resistance. But when
the going really gets rough, when he's just thinking about survival, his hands
go right out for balance, just like a tightrope walker.";   9. Use knees to
edge on ice -- If you edge too much with your hips, down you go, Kidd said.
"If you put your skis on edge by rolling your knees over into the hill,
because of stiff boots your skis will go off on edge and you can hold on ice,"
he said. "If you do that, and your skis slip on the snow, you'll skid right
along with them, but you won't fall down.";   10. Simplify and enjoy -- "I try
to tell people to keep skiing really simple," Kidd said. "It isn't that
complicated, basically. You want to get down the hill without falling down.
That's what Franz Klammer wants to do.;   "To do that, keep it simple. Just
think about your hands and keeping them out to the side for balance. Keep them
forward and that'll help round your back and bend your knees. Start your turn
with a pole plant, and that's it."  </TEXT>

   It's a late-summer film festival for the
Sheen brothers, with Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen starring in
three films, including one together.
   The two sons of Martin Sheen co-star in Epic Productions' ``Men
at Work,'' which Emilio also wrote and directed. He repeats his
role as Billy the Kid in Fox's ``Young Guns II,'' and Charlie plays
a hot-shot commando in Orion's ``Navy SEALS.''
   Their father changed his name from Estevez to Sheen. Emilio
chose to use the family name in his career.
   The brothers are a strange pair for brothers. Estevez, 27, is
blond, with Spanish-looking features, reflective, serious; Sheen is
taller, dark, more impulsive. Are they truly brothers?
   ``As far as we know,'' said Charlie Sheen in a joint interview.
``But anything can happen.''
   ``I've seen baby pictures of us together,'' said Estevez. ``We
lived in the same house.''
   Who beat up on whom during their Malibu childhoods?
   ``I think we beat each other up pretty equally,'' Estevez said.
``Mine was more of a mental torture on Charlie; I terrorized and
teased him just about all the way around the world (they traveled
to their father's locations). Physical confrontations were few but
memorable.''
   ``Of the Ali-Foreman caliber,'' Sheen said.
   Sheen checked into a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center for
a month on Aug. 9. His publicist, Jeff Barnard said he was
suffering from extreme exhaustion from filming two movies
back-to-back.
   In ``Men at Work'' the brothers play a couple of garbagemen who
find a body in the trash and become involved in a plot of murder
and environmental poisoning. Estevez traces the film's beginnings
to a sleepless night at his Santa Monica apartment in 1984. Hearing
the trash truck outside his window, he started devising a script.
   The project stagnated at a studio for a year until Estevez could
rescue the script. Fifteen drafts later, he made the deal with
Epic. The budget was definitely not in the ``Die Hard 2'' category.
   ``We made it for what is considered by the studios a low-budget
standard,'' Estevez said.
   How low? About half of the industry average of $18 to $20
million.
   Such a budget doesn't allow for Charlie Sheen's $1 million-plus
salary. He dodged the issue: ``I don't like to discuss cash, but
they were very generous.''
   Four years ago, Estevez wrote, directed and starred in
``Wisdom,'' becoming the youngest to perform all three functions in
a major film. It failed to find an audience.
   ``If I learned anything on the first picture, it was to really
open myself up, to include everybody in a community effort,'' he
said. ``If Charlie has an idea or if the crafts-service guy has an
idea, they both come from a place of wanting to make the movie
better. I didn't approach it that I was paranoid and they wanted to
take my movie away from me.''
   ``Oh, he'd listen to me _ if it was a good idea,'' added Sheen.
``I came up with some stinkers now and then, and they didn't make
the movie. They all can't be winners.''
   Did the brothers work well together?
   ``Absolutely,'' assured Estevez. ``You get there on the set and
there's 100 people. They all have a job to do, you have a job to
do.''
   ``You had three jobs to do,'' said Sheen.
   ``Right,'' said Estevez. ``There really wasn't time for any
shenanigans.''
   ``That doesn't mean we didn't have a good time making this
thing,'' his brother said.
   ``We had a lot of laughs. It's tough, though, making a film. My
days were running 18-19-hours. A director maybe gets four or five
hours' sleep.''
   About ``Navy SEALS,'' Sheen commented: ``A long shoot, 16 weeks,
eight in Virginia Beach, the remaining eight in Spain. Very
physical picture. Very dangerous picture. But a lot of time, I had
a great time playing that role. I got to create some situations as
opposed to just reacting to them.''
   He also appeared in ``Young Guns'' but missed the sequel.
   ``We left Charlie back at Blazer's Mill, where the historical
figure was killed. So he didn't follow us,'' Estevez said.
   ``I had no concern about doing this sequel. I felt the second
half of the Billy the Kid story had been left blank, and I wanted
to fill it in. It's a great character for an actor to play.
   ``Also, Charlie's got a pretty good body count in the films he's
done. I had to catch up. He's got 32, and now I'm up to 16 or 17
confirmed kills. So I'm working on it.''

OF CHILES, CACTI, AND FIGHTING COCKS NOTES ON THE AMERICAN WEST BY FREDERICK 
TURNER (BERKLEY/NORTH POINT PRESS: $19.95; 211 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Paul Jordan-Smith, Jordan-Smith is a free-lance writer.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were several good reasons for reading this book, one of which, to anyone 
with a love of the spice of life, is paramount: a first-rate recipe for "Basic 
Texas Red" chili. As Frederick Turner points out in his chapter, "A Lot Like It 
Hot," one must be careful to distinguish between chile, which is the pepper, 
and chili, which is the dish you make from chiles; that, however, is the least 
of the informative tidbits about chiles and chili that can be found here. 
</P>
<P>
Turner, whose book "Spirit of Place," published earlier this year, touched but 
briefly on the American West, here turns his attention completely to the spirit 
and place of that expanse whose peculiarities, stark drama and absence of 
visible boundaries altered the consciousness of so many of its immigrants. 
Mustangs, saguaros, the lives of cowboys and Indians (at least as seen by white 
eyes), the Gargantuan proportions of the Czech beseda in Deming, the Horatio 
Alger rise of the Basque sheepherders, cockfighting, Billy the Kid: One cannot 
say: "It's all here," because the legends are endless, but this is as good a 
place as you are likely to find from which to begin a revisitation of the 
American West. 
</P>
<P>
Of course there are changes from "the olden days." Government management (or 
mismanagement, which amounts to the same thing) has wrought ecological 
endangerment everywhere one cares to look. Nor has the situation been markedly 
improved by the well-meaning intervention of environmental groups, equally 
devoted to management though on terms somewhat different than those of the 
local ranchers and farmers. 
</P>
<P>
It would be too easy to devote an entire book to the disasters of a overly 
managed land; it would be too easy to ignore such things altogether also, and 
Turner does not skirt the issue in his essay on the plight of the mustangs. It 
is not an easy issue: The Bureau of Land Management was pretty clearly rendered 
absurd by the Reagan Administration, but the claims -- and worse, the methods 
-- of the environmentalist groups are equally open to criticism. The vast herds 
of wild horses that once roamed the West are severely diminished -- but were 
their huge numbers such a good thing for them? 
</P>
<P>
Government and special-interest groups are not the only instigators of change. 
Boosterism has sufficiently obscured enough of history to leave the story of 
Billy the Kid eternally ambiguous, and the American consciousness itself has 
suffered changes in the passage of time. The festival celebrating the Czech 
community in Deming, N.M. -- that has taken place for nearly 60 years -- may be 
seeing its last days as new generations lose interest in producing klobase, the 
Bohemian sausage of pork and beef that is the staple of the beseda. But the 
tourism that it inspires may be sufficient to keep the custom alive, though the 
intimacy of the earlier gatherings has long been forsaken. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Czechs, the Basques have witnessed change: The way of these remarkable 
sheepherders, who steadily extracted pasturage from the most unlikely places 
(such as the Great Basin of eastern Oregon), has eroded, but without much 
regret. That way was too lonely, too cut off from the mainstream to long 
survive. Yet there are some regrets: The decline of one way of life is seldom, 
if ever, isolated from the culture from which it sprang. When a generation 
begins to think in the language of its surrounding culture, the mind set of the 
mother tongue is doomed. 
</P>
<P>
Turner is at his best when writing about people, and his chapter, "Buying the 
West -- and Selling It: Two Versions," is clearly the best piece in the book. 
There he describes the quintessentially wild Western lives of two gifted 
adventurers: James Willard Schultz, who lived among the Blackfeet, marrying a 
Pikuni woman, and wrote "My Life as an Indian"; and the French-Canadian artist 
and writer Joseph-Ernest-Nephtali Dufault, who lived as a cowboy and was better 
known to us all as Will James, the author of "Smoky" and "Lone Cowboy." 
Schultz's and James' stories are as Western as sagebrush, and Turner serves 
them well with intimacy, simplicity and affection. Will James appears little 
known to younger generations, but to my own and that of my parents, his books 
and paintings made the Old West live. It is good to see him remembered so 
fondly. 
</P>
<P>
Turner's American vision is alive: We see through his words. He has found his 
voice, but it is still a question whether he has discovered what he needs to 
say with it. The West is a strongly delineated place in outward form, and this 
can sometimes produce a deceptive impression of depth in those who write about 
it. "Spirit of Place" was a fine book, and this is a good one too, but they are 
not the best that we could receive from Turner, given his abilities. A broad 
vision is not enough; it needs to go deeper. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, try the chili.

<TEXT>     Twenty-six people died violently there in the late 1880s -- including five
people in one day, according to local legend. Bullet holes pock the dining
room ceiling. Records show that gunfights claimed the most victims, although
there were a few stabbings, too.;   The hallway upstairs is lined with the
pictures and names of famous Wild West figures who stayed at the St. James,
including Billy the Kid, Pat Garrett, Bat Masterson, Tom "Black Jack" Ketchum,
Doc Holliday and Buffalo Bill Cody.;   Loree, a former co-owner, no longer
works here. But one night in 1986, she says, she showed Room 18 to Dr. Kenneth
Wright of Fresno and encountered a not-so-friendly ghost.;   "Swirling --
that's too gentle. He was raging," Wright, a gynecologist, said by telephone
from Fresno.;   "It came down at me and passed me on my right and I felt like
I was being struck at," Loree says. "I indeed fell to my knees. . . . I got
back up and at that point it came back at me and knocked me back to my knees
and went up to the corner (of the room) and continued spinning.";   Room 18,
closed to the public, is hardly bigger than a walk-in closet. It holds a dusty
oak bed frame without a mattress. Dozens of dead flies are scattered on a
window sill.;   "We've never had anybody sleep in here -- not with the things
that are going on," said owner-manager Ed Sitzberger.;   Sitzberger keeps
talking birds in the lobby of the 120-year-old hotel and 15 smaller birds in a
coffee shop aviary. He says two birds dropped dead after he showed Room 18 to
five people in 1987.;   Chefs and bartenders report that food and crockery
disappears from under their noses and glassware floats and shatters.;   The
most recent incident occurred last month, as three people came to the front
door. The first two got in, then the deadbolt snapped shut in front of the
third, Sitzberger says.;   Despite its lurid history, the St. James remains an
elegant territorial-style adobe landmark in this rustic northern New Mexico
village. "We have a Halloween party every year," says Sitzberger, who has
owned the place since 1985. "We have a costume contest . . . and we scare the
kids to death" in the hotel's "haunted hallway.";   The Lodge in Cloudcroft,
200 miles south of Albuquerque, also sees its occupancy surge around
Halloween, thanks to a friendly apparition named Rebecca. In the early 1930s,
Rebecca, a chambermaid, was reportedly murdered there by a jealous boyfriend.;
  "We get a lot of unexplainable incidents -- telephones that ring . . . water
turning on at various times of the day and night," Lodge manager Catherine
Cullers says.;   And to those skeptics who say ringing telephones and dripping
faucets are not exactly inexplicable, Cullers responds: "We have a lot of
people who reportedly have woken up in the middle of the night and seen
Rebecca. She's red-headed, young, good looking and very nice. She never does
any bad things."  </TEXT>

   Aaron Copland, the pioneering
composer who used folk songs and jazz in writing plainspoken
classics such as ``Appalachian Spring,'' ``Lincoln Portrait'' and
``Billy the Kid,'' died Sunday at age 90.
   Copland, who lived in Peekskill, died at Phelps Memorial
Hospital in Westchester from pneumonia with respiratory failure
following two recent strokes, hospital spokeswoman Ann Marie
Treanor said Sunday night.
   Admired by colleagues as the ``dean of American music,'' Copland
was a major force in gaining international recognition for the
nation's 20th century composers. His honors included a Pulitzer
Prize, a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Guggenheim Foundation's
first music fellowship and an Oscar.
   Vivian Perlis, with whom he wrote his memoir, said Copland ``had
the unusual ability to reach a wide audience and at the same time
he composed some of the masterworks of the century that were highly
respected by other musicians.''
   She added: ``He put American music on the map. He decided that
there should be an American sound, a place for the American
composer.''
   Among his better known works were the score for ``The Red
Pony,'' the 1949 movie based on the novel by John Steinbeck, and
``Lincoln Portrait,'' music performed with narration inspired by
the writing of Carl Sandberg.
   Other noted pieces included ``Fanfare for the Common Man,''
written in 1942.
   ``He was the composer who would lead American music out of the
wilderness,'' the late Leonard Bernstein wrote in High Fidelity
magazine for the occasion of Copland's 70th birthday. ``He was The
Leader, the one to whom the young always came with their
compositions.''
   Composer William Schumann said he, Copland and Bernstein were
close friends for many years and formed a ``triumvirate'' among
American composers.
   ``I think Aaron created the American sound in symphonic music,''
Schumann said. ``He has not only been for a half-century the
pre-eminent American composer, but a remarkable force as an
influence with younger composers.''
   He added: ``Copland believed in the validity of American music,
and that we were not inferior to our European cousins.''
   Copland wrote two operas, six ballets and eight film scores,
including his Oscar-winning music for William Wyler's ``The
Heiress'' in 1948. He was a pianist, conductor, author and
educator, guiding numerous musicians including Bernstein.
   Copland won his Pulitzer and the New York Music Critics Circle
Award in 1945 for ``Appalachian Spring,'' which he wrote for Martha
Graham to accompany her choreography based on a Hart Crane poem.
Among the composition's most famous themes: a Shaker melody played
by clarinet and followed by five variations.
   His ballets ``Billy the Kid'' and ``Rodeo'' also combined cowboy
tunes and folk songs with original themes.
   Despite his success, Copland stopped composing after 1967,
spending much of his time at his home and directing recordings of
his works.
   One reason for his decision to stop composing was the rejection
by young composers of his ``Inscape,'' his first attempt at the
highly structured, atonal 12-tone system.
   Born Nov. 14, 1900, Copland was the youngest of five children.
His parents, immigrants from Eastern Europe, owned a neighborhood
department store in Brooklyn.
   Copland's maternal grandfather, Aaron Mittenthal, moved to
Dallas and opened a dry goods store there in the 1870s. According
to Copland family lore, Jesse James' brother, Frank, worked in the
store, attracting customers but stealing the profits, forcing
Mittenthal to eeturn to New York.
   Perlis, co-author of his 1984 memoir ``Copland,'' suggests that
lineage is one reason a Jewish boy from Brooklyn could write cowboy
music, though he did not travel to the West until he was 28.
   Copland provided his own explanation: ``I preferred to imagine
being on a horse without actually getting on one!''
   His first work was a song composed at about age 8 for his
mother. About three years later, he gave up after two pages of
``Music for opera, Zenatello, Act I.'' His first complete work was
a song, ``Lola,'' written at age 14.
   But Copland's parents were reluctant to pay for music lessons.
   ``My parents were of the opinion that enough money had been
invested in the musical training of the four older children, with
meager results,'' he once recalled.
   Copland's persistence prevailed. At 16, he began harmony lessons
with Rubin Goldmark, who taught another Brooklynite, George
Gershwin.
   In 1920, Copland was the first to be accepted to the French
government's summer music school for Americans at the palace of
Fontainbleau. He studied harmony in Paris with Nadia Boulanger, and
sold a composition, ``The Cat and the Mouse,'' for $32.50.
   ``To finally see my music printed means more to me than any
debut in Carnegie Hall,'' he wrote home.
   Copland was part of a talented group of Americans who studied
with Boulanger, including Virgil Thompson, Walter Piston, Roy
Harris, David Diamond and Elliott Carter, who remembered Copland on
Sunday night as being ``extremely helpful to his musical
colleagues.''
   The brightest musical light in Paris when Copland was there was
Igor Stravinsky, whose pounding, primitive ballet ``The Rite of
Spring'' caused a riot at its 1913 premiere.
   Copland was struck by Stravinsky's use of Russian folk material:
``I have no doubt that this strongly influenced me to try to find a
way to a distinctively American music.''
   In 1923, Boulanger introduced Copland to Serge Koussevitzky, who
would take over the Boston Symphony Orchestra the next year.
Copland played his ``Cortege macabre'' on the piano, and composer
Serge Prokofiev, who was also at the house, blurted out ``Too much
bassi ostinati.''
   However, Koussevitzky promised to conduct the piece in Boston,
and asked Copland to compose an organ concerto for Boulanger. A
shaken Copland later asked his teacher, ``Do you really think I can
do it?''
   ``She pointed a finger at me. `You can do it.' And when
Mademoiselle said, `You can do it,' that was the end of the
discussion,'' Copland recalled.
   Copland returned to New York in 1924 to complete the ``Symphony
for Organ and Orchestra,'' which Boulanger premiered in New York in
1925 at her U.S. debut.
   Afterward, Copland recalled, conductor Walter Damrosch addressed
the audience: ``Ladies and gentlemen. I am sure you will agree that
if a gifted young man can write a symphony like this at 23 ...
within five years he will be ready to commit murder.''
   Copland laughed along with the audience, but for years Damrosch
worried whether the composer understood he was joking.
   The same year, Copland won the first Guggenheim Fellowship in
music, worth $2,500.
   Koussevitzky commissioned Copland's ``Music for the Theatre,''
and introduced his ``Piano Concerto,'' both jazz-inspired
compositions.
   The concerto, written in 1926, used frequently changing rhythms.
``I felt I had gone to the extreme of where jazz could take me, the
audiences and critics in Boston all thought I had gone too far,''
Copland recalled.
   In 1928, during his first trip to the West, Copland heard the
piece hissed during rehearsal and again in concert at the Hollywood
Bowl.
   His 1942 ``Rodeo'' launched Agnes DeMille in her dancing career.
   Copland also helped organize Cos Cob Press, which published
music of composers rejected by established publishers. He founded
the Young Composers' Group, which helped Thompson, Bernard Herrmann
and others.
   Copland never married and left no survivors.
   An old friend, the late playwright Harold Clurman, once told
Perlis that ``the only ambition I ever heard him remark on was, `I
want to be remembered.'''

NEW PRINCIPALS IN HARLEM TROUPE'S 'JOHN HENRY'

Two attractive young Dance Theatre of Harlem soloists took over the charismatic 
principal roles in Arthur Mitchell's dance drama "John Henry" on Sunday 
afternoon at Pasadena Civic Auditorium. Each gave a likable performance that 
ultimately proved too soft to galvanize the masses in this saga of a 
steel-drivin' man and his indomitable wife. 
</P>
<P>
More credible as lovers than leaders, both Hugues Magen (John Henry) and Lisa 
Attles (Polly Ann) looked their best in the slinky, hip-rolling mating duet. 
Elsewhere, Magen projected great dignity as the ultimate working-class hero, 
but he only approximated the heroic bravura of the solos defining the 
character's prowess and legendary domination over the steam drill. 
</P>
<P>
A delightful tease in her entrance solo, Attles always danced vivaciously but 
didn't achieve much depth or authority. Admittedly, Mitchell sweetens the 
character compared to some of the classic folk ballads (for instance, we never 
see her driving steel "like a man"). But the moment when she changes mourning 
into celebration should have more spiritual power than it did Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
New casting for "Serenade" found Karen Brown intense but far from ideal in 
classical line as the fallen, abandoned ballerina, and Augustus van Heerden 
undistinguished as her first partner. However, Stephanie Dabney and Ronald 
Perry brought impressive technical suavity and emotional weight to the episode 
involving the "winged" woman and her "blind" consort. Cassandra Phifer danced 
capably as the leader in the apotheosis. 
</P>
<P>
In "Billy the Kid," Christina Johnson's limpid, serenely executed solos as the 
Sweetheart created implications more poignant than the ballet's scenario. 
Contrary to the synopsis, Billy can't be dreaming of a former sweetheart, for 
he never would have known this kind of woman. She's pure fantasy -- a mirage of 
the purity totally beyond his reach.LEWIS SEGAL

BILLY KIDD, JIMMIE HEUGA GAVE U.S. SKIING A BOOST IN '64

<P>
Billy Kidd's first reaction was, "Oh no, I didn't win the race." Jimmie Heuga 
said he took his gloves off and threw them down on the snow in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
The date was Feb. 8, 1964, the place Innsbruck, Austria. And moments after 
their initial disappointment subsided, both men realized that they had just 
made history, of a sort. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only had we won the first Olympic medals in men's Alpine skiing for the 
United States," Kidd said here Wednesday -- 25 years to the day later -- "but 
we had drawn the attention of the world and established the credibility of U.S. 
skiing." 
</P>
<P>
Kidd, with the fastest second run of the men's slalom, took the silver medal in 
that final race of the '64 Winter Games, and Heuga came out of the 
second-seeded group to earn the bronze. Pepi Stiegler of Austria won the gold 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't win," said Heuga, who now lives in the Vail Valley. "But we had done 
something that no other American male ski racers had ever done in the Olympics. 
It was a very special time, especially for the men, and it was definitely a 
team effort, with a common sense of sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the two longtime friends went skiing again between races of the 
1989 World Alpine Ski Championships. This time, Kidd beat Heuga down the slope 
again, but Jimmie has avalid excuse -- not that he would use it. 
</P>
<P>
Heuga, 44, has had multiple sclerosis since 1967, and fighting the disease has 
become the focal point of his life, along with skiing. He now heads the Jimmie 
Heuga Center, a nonprofit scientific research organization in Vail. 
</P>
<P>
Kidd, 43, who is director of skiing at Steamboat Springs, Colo., has written 
three books on skiing and does commentary for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
They each had success in racing after 1964: Kidd won the combined gold medal in 
the 1970 world championships at Val Gardena, Italy, and Heuga won the Arlberg 
Kandahar in 1967, when he also finished third in the World Cup giant slalom 
standings. But that Olympic slalom in '64 was the big breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until Innsbruck," Kidd said, "only our women skiers were being taken 
seriously, and we didn't even go to Europe in the winter of 1962-63. We stayed 
home in North America, and some of the Europeans came over and took part in our 
races. We figured that this would help us get some points to boost our seedings 
when we did go over the next winter. But the European ski officials disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob Beattie was the ski coach at the University of Colorado then, and he was 
named the first full-time U.S. Olympic Alpine coach. We arrived in France 
around Thanksgiving of '63 and trained with the French team, which was then No. 
1 in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"But when we began racing, we had starting numbers down in the 40s, 50s and 
60s," Kidd said. "In those days, especially, it was impossible to win if you 
had so many racers chewing up the course ahead of you." 
</P>
<P>
Beattie, who is also at Vail as an ESPN commentator, argued with the 
International Skiing Federation (FIS) officials and, with the help of some 
impressive results by Kidd, Heuga, Buddy Werner and Chuck Ferries, finally got 
his racers better starting numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Kidd said, Americans were considered second-rate skiers. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember that Christmas, two months before the Olympics," Kidd said. "We 
didn't have enough money to come home, so we stayed in Europe over the 
holidays. One afternoon, we had tea with the ski-school director at St. Anton, 
Austria, a crusty old fellow. He asked me politely how I thought I might do in 
the Olympics. I said that I hoped to win a medal, and he roared with laughter. 
</P>
<P>
"Subconsciously, I guess, this just made me more determined. 
</P>
<P>
"But then at Innsbruck, I drew No. 1 for the downhill, and I remember standing 
in the starting gate, 2 minutes away from a 60-m.p.h. run down a chute of sheer 
ice, with 50,000 people watching on the course, TV cameras trained on me and 
Nikons all over the place. My knees were barely holding me up, and I was having 
trouble breathing. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a classic case of stage fright. I made a mistake about four gates into 
my run and wound up 16th. I was so angry with myself that I was determined 
never to have stage fright again. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten days later, by the second run of the slalom, I was a different person. My 
parents were there, and they said people were screaming for me, because I had a 
chance to win the race, but I didn't hear them. I was concentrating so 
completely that all I could hear was my (ski) edges on the ice, trying to find 
out if I was skidding or carving my turns." 
</P>
<P>
He was sixth after the first run but had the fastest second run and finished 
only 0.14 of a second behind Stiegler. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I at least had the bronze, if Jimmie, who was still to come down, got 
either the silver or gold," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Heuga was third after the first run, and Kidd said he had never seen a racer 
more relaxed in the starting gate. 
</P>
<P>
"He was standing up there," Kidd said, "and some girls along the course shouted 
out that they were from the University of Colorado, too, and Jimmie started 
carrying on a conversation with them, like he was just out enjoying an 
afternoon of skiing. But as soon as he started down the course, he shut 
everything else out and concentrated totally on the race." 
</P>
<P>
Said Heuga: "I knew I had a chance for a medal, but I felt kind of funny 
because I thought Buddy Werner deserved one more than me. When I came through 
the finish and knew that I had the bronze, the first person to rush over and 
embrace me was Werner. Buddy was just happy for the whole team." 
</P>
<P>
Werner, who was killed shortly thereafter in an avalanche, finished eighth, and 
Heuga said: "I had mixed emotions after the race. First, I was disappointed 
that I hadn't skied fast enough for the gold; then I realized that the bronze 
wasn't so bad, after all, and I was proud for the United States, and finally, I 
was uneasy because I felt that Buddy really should have gotten a medal instead 
of me." 
</P>
<P>
Heuga was 0.25 of a second behind Kidd, and both of their runs were called by 
Jim McKay of ABC, which was televising its first Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of a watershed," Kidd said. "Those were the last Olympics for 
wooden skis and leather boots -- we were using the new metal skis in downhill 
but not in the technical events. And interest in skiing really took off in the 
United States right after that." 
</P>
<P>
Kidd went on to win the world professional ski-racing championship in the 
spring of 1970, after his gold medal at Val Gardena. The next year, he lost the 
pro title to Spider Sabich, by 0.007 of a second, and since then has been 
affiliated with Steamboat, about 50 miles from here. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing I try to do," Kidd said, "both in my racing camps and my free 
clinics that I give at noon each day when I'm there, is to tell skiers to watch 
the best racers in the world, on TV or in person. This will make anyone a 
better skier. Racers also want to get down the hill without falling, and you 
can learn from them, no matter how well you ski." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his books, Kidd has produced a video, "Billy Kidd's Ski Racing," 
which he said, naturally, can benefit all skiers, not just racers. 
</P>
<P>
Kidd was recently divorced, after a 12-year marriage, and has two sons, 11 and 
9, and a daughter, 5. 
</P>
<P>
Heuga, who married his first wife in Geneva shortly after the 1968 Winter 
Olympics at Grenoble, France, was divorced three years later, just a few months 
after he was diagnosed as having MS. 
</P>
<P>
"I started having vision problems as early as the spring of 1967," Heuga said, 
"and I was feeling some numbness in my legs, but it would come and go. I 
started seeing an ophthalmologist and other specialists, but it took them until 
September of '70 to figure out that it was MS." 
</P>
<P>
Heuga, who grew up in Squaw Valley, Calif., spent the next decade or so as 
director of skiing at the Bear Valley resort in the Sierra, and working for a 
ski equipment company. 
</P>
<P>
"Then," he said, "I became kind of a hermit in Connecticut. And I spent the 
time forming my thoughts on how to live the rest of my life and developing my 
own fitness program." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Heuga was giving his ideas to others, and he found himself speaking to 
more than 70 chapters of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. 
</P>
<P>
His theme: "You don't have to sit and wait fatalistically for a miracle cure to 
come along. You can take charge of your own life and live it to the fullest." 
</P>
<P>
Heuga, who has a problem with his balance, walks with the aid of a cane, swims 
almost daily, and skis as often as possible. "I've been on the hill 18 days so 
far this winter," he said. "Last year, I skied 44 days." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, with the help of a $10,000 grant from the Vail Valley Foundation, 
Heuga founded the Jimmie Heuga Center here. He soon raised another $60,000 from 
various charitable events and was on his way. The center's 1989 budget is 
$900,000. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 22 ski resorts in North America help by playing host to his Jimmie 
Heuga Express, in which three-skier teams raise money by skiing as many 
vertical feet as possible on a given weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Heuga has also received financial aid or encouragement from Martin Davis, 
president and chief executive officer of Gulf-Western; Dr. Robert Slater of the 
National MS Society, and former President Gerald R. Ford and his wife, Betty. 
</P>
<P>
"The Boston chapter of the MS Society helped publish my program in a book 
titled, 'Maximizing Your Health,' " Heuga said. "Following the program may not 
affect one's condition, but it can affect his or her health and help to make 
life more enjoyable." 
</P>
<P>
At his center, Heuga has a staff of 40 professionals. It offers 5-day seminars 
for groups of 25 each and has a 10-month waiting list. Heuga said: "We show 
those who are physically challenged, not just with MS but with other 
conditions, how they can deal with the uncertainty in their lives, uncertainty 
that can lead to self-doubt and then to a loss of self-esteem. We try to give 
them the motivation to regain control of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Heuga seems to be dealing nicely with his own life. He married the former 
Debbie Dana two years ago, and they expect their first child July 21. 
</P>
<P>
But he says he still hopes to beat Billy Kidd to the bottom of the hill some 
day.

<TEXT>     Twenty-six people died violently there in the late 1880s -- including five
people in one day, according to local legend. Bullet holes pock the dining
room ceiling. Records show that gunfights claimed the most victims, although a
few were stabbed.;   The hallway upstairs is lined with the pictures and names
of famous Wild West figures who stayed at the St. James, including Billy the
Kid, Pat Garrett, Bat Masterson, Tom "Black Jack" Ketchum, Doc Holliday and
Buffalo Bill Cody.;   Loree, a former co-owner, no longer works here. But one
night in 1986, she said, she showed Room 18 to Dr. Kenneth Wright of Fresno
and encountered a not-so-friendly ghost.;   "Swirling -- that's too gentle. He
was raging," Wright, a gynecologist, said by telephone from Fresno.;   "It
came down at me and passed me on my right, and I felt like I was being struck
at," Loree said. "I indeed fell to my knees. . . . I got back up, and at that
point it came back at me and knocked me back to my knees and went up to the
corner (of the room) and continued spinning.";   Room 18, closed to the
public, is hardly bigger than a walk-in closet. It holds a dusty oak bed frame
without a mattress. Dozens of dead flies are scattered on a windowsill.;  
"We've never had anybody sleep in here -- not with the things that are going
on," owner-manager Ed Sitzberger said.;   Sitzberger keeps talking birds in
the lobby of the 120-year-old hotel and 15 smaller birds in a coffee shop
aviary. He says two birds dropped dead after he showed Room 18 to five people
in 1987.;   Chefs and bartenders report that food and crockery disappears from
under their noses and glassware floats and shatters.;   The most recent
incident occurred last month, as three people came to the front door. The
first two got in, then the deadbolt snapped shut in front of the third,
Sitzberger says.;   Despite its lurid history, the St. James remains an
elegant territorial-style adobe landmark in this rustic northern New Mexico
village.  </TEXT>

MARTIN OUT OF CHARACTER AS 'BAD-BOY' IN 'ILLUMINATIONS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Douglas Martin is a handsome and technically accomplished young dancer whose 
height and partnering prowess alone would justify his prominence during the 
current Joffrey Ballet season at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
However, casting him in the stellar "bad-boy" roles of the repertory -- first 
Billy the Kid last week and, on Sunday afternoon, the Rimbaud character in 
Frederick Ashton's "Illuminations" -- forces Martin way out of his depth as an 
actor. 
</P>
<P>
He works hard to conquer all the movement challenges and knows how to hold 
attention through sheer presence, but something fundamentally decent in his 
nature undercuts every attempt to seem venal. 
</P>
<P>
When he throws himself on top of the character called Profane Love (a rather 
aimlessly jittery Julie Janus), this Rimbaud arches his back all right, but it 
isn't sex, it's choreography. Significantly, Martin's best moment in the ballet 
is his disgusted final rejection of her. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing Daniel Baudendistel in "Lacrymosa" on Sunday night, Martin broods 
superbly -- coming between Jodie Gates and Edward Stierle in a portrayal of the 
enigmatic man in black that suggests hidden depths. But, for now, both "Billy" 
and "Illuminations" are better served with other Joffrey casts. 
</P>
<P>
Several new "Cotillon" principals interacted well with previously reviewed 
artists on Sunday afternoon. Charlene Gehm made an elegant-unto-brittle 
Mistress of Ceremonies: perfect for a ballet with lots of secrets under the 
fancy-dress vivacity. Cameron Basden danced the Young Girl's friend with an 
effective, carefree attack. However, Janus looked strained and listless as the 
glamorous predator in the "Hand of Fate" pas de deux -- another Joffrey dancer 
who's no good at being bad. LEWIS SEGAL

   Videos reviewed this week: ``Young Guns,'' ``Five Corners,''
``Midnight Crossing.''
   
   ``Young Guns'' (Vestron Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98. Rated R)
   
   As almost everyone knows, William Bonney probably was as twisted
a psychopathic little geek as ever crawled out from under a rock.
   Adenoidal, visibly retarded, stumpy-legged and physically dirty,
Billy the Kid was glorified by the penny press of his day as a
clean-limbed, resolute pistol fighter who killed by the Code of the
West. My, how we've changed.
   ``Young Guns'' casts a twitchy Emilio Estevez as Billy, with
nattering sidekicks Kiefer Sutherland, Charlie Sheen, Casey
Siemasko, Lou Diamond Phillips and Dermot Mulroney. Terence Stamp
phones in his part as a smarmy British rancher and Jack Palance
plays Jack Palance, his bad-guy antagonist in New Mexico's Lincoln
County war of 1878.
   Guns roar. Ricochets whine. Sutherland murmurs. Estevez whines.
Palance smirks, having picked up another payday. Suffocatingly
directed by Christopher Cain, written by John Fusco, it makes you
want to run out and rent ``The Wild Bunch.''
   The movie's greatest moment is Brian Keith's cameo as a tough,
coarse, filthy bounty hunter who comes within an ace of blowing our
boy heroes off the planet. For a second the movie opens up and shows
signs of life.
   False alarm.

   ``Five Corners'' (Cannon Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R)
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   Writer John Patrick Shanley, who took viewers to the sweet
streets of Brooklyn in ``Moonstruck,'' moves to the mean streets of
the Bronx in 1964 with ``Five Corners.''
   Unlike ``Moonstruck,'' this 1988 movie was no hit.
   But both Shanley products have an appealing fairy-tale feel with
their roots squarely planted in the mundane.
   Jodie Foster is lovely as Linda, a tough young woman frightened
at the release of a man sent to prison for trying to rape her. John
Turturro is truly terrifying as Heinz, still obsessed with Linda.
Tim Robbins (``Bull Durham'') plays Harry, Linda's savior, who after
his policeman father is killed becomes profoundly affected by the
work and words of Martin Luther King Jr.
   The characters' paths cross in a neighborhood of violence and
poverty. Some escape into a private fantasy world, others by
leaving, like Harry who plans to go South to register black voters.
Heinz cannot escape, and Turturro makes you feel how penned in his
character feels.
   There are drugs and pointless vandalism, penguins in a fountain,
a St. Bernard named The Buddah, dark humor and, mostly, people just
trying to get by in a world that shouldn't be so tough.
   ``Five Corners'' is eccentric and engaging, and above all worth
watching. But the end is less than satisfying, as a world lacking in
peace and order is tied up a little too neatly by the credits.

   ``Midnight Crossing'' (MCA Home Entertainment. VHS-Beta, $89.98.
Rated R)
   
   Flashback: Castro is coming out of the Cuban highlands and
Batista's casino operators are moving their cash out of the country.
Somehow a bunch of U.S. Navy men get hold of $2 million of it and
stash it on this island, see?
   Cut to the present: Daniel J. Travanti was one of the sailors.
The other one who knew where the treasure is has died, so Travanti
wants to go back and get it. (Why did they wait 20 years? Good
question.)
   Travanti's wife, played by Faye Dunaway, is blind, sort of. (``I
specialized in eye diseases. So how did I get glaucoma?'' Good
question.)
   He charters the yacht of his suspiciously deceased shipmate's son
(John Laughlin), whose perky, pouty wife (Kim Cattrall) works in
Capt. Frank Furillo's insurance agency. (Why? Good question.)
   By this point you've sunk 45 minutes in this sucker and nothing's
happening.
   Wait a second! ... Hey, isn't this the perfect bunch to erupt in
jealousy, lust, murderous intrigue and pistols and spearguns and all
kinds of neat-o, bloodiness played out beneath a cruel, cruel
Caribbean sun? Good question!
   Travanti sleepwalks through his role. Dunaway is at her most
brittle, shrewish and shrill. The juve leads are bland as custard.
Phony tension, childish intrigue, unbelievably stupid plot tricks.
Worse, the venerable Ned Beatty is written into the plot _ and just
as quickly written out.
   How did all these clever, handsome people make this bad movie?
Good question.

   Bob Hope says he wrote about his life to beat his
kids to the job.
   ``Look what happened to Bing Crosby, Bette Davis, Joan
Crawford,'' he quipped at a bookstore here Tuesday while signing
copies of his autobiography, ``Don't Shoot, It's Only Me.''
   Hope, 87, wrote the book with Melville Shavelson, one of his
comedy writers since 1938.
   The legendary comedian says he does not worry about death.

   Magic Johnson helped Michigan State
University win a college basketball title 11 years ago. Now, he
would like to help run the school.
   Michigan Democratic Party officials suggested Johnson run for a
seat on the board of trustees for the East Lansing school.
   Johnson, who led the Los Angeles Lakers to five National
Basketball Assocaiton championships, said in a statement Tuesday
that he was ``very interested.''
   Johnson, 30, would return next week to his hometown of Lansing
to re-establish residency and register to vote, said Joel Ferguson,
a Democratic Party activist.
   To run for the board, Johnson must be a resident for at least 30
days and be nominated by the Democratic Party at its state
convention Sept. 8-9 in Flint.
   Gov. James Blanchard hopes Johnson's candidacy would attract
voters to the polls for the Nov. 6 election, in which Blanchard is
seeking his third term.

   Sonny Crockett shot bad guys by the score
on ``Miami Vice.'' Don Johnson, who portrayed the hip undercover TV
cop, says it's harder to shoot par amid scores of fans.
   More than a thousand fans swarmed the Country Club of Jackson on
Tuesday for a glimpse of the actor, who played in a pro-celebrity
golf tournament to benefit a local hospital. Organizers credited
him with doubling the size of the gallery to about 3,000.
   Pro golfer Kenny Perry, who was paired with Johnson, basked
happily in the actor's reflected glory.
   ``I didn't realize I had this many fans in Jackson,'' said Perry.

   Actor Emilio Estevez agrees the movie western
``Young Guns,'' dismissed by critics as a Brat Pack-on-horseback
charade, was a career misstep.
   So why the sequel ``Young Guns 2'' opening this week?
   ``I have been a fan of the western movies since I was a little
kid and I did `Young Guns' in the hope that it would help bring
back the western,'' Estevez, 27, said in an interview this week.
   ``John Fusco wrote a magnificent script, but then it was turned
into what I call Hollywood's first heavy-metal western. It was just
an excuse for a personality piece featuring all these young actors,
and I was very disappointed.''
   Fusco also wrote the script for the sequel, but this time
there's a different director and a bigger scope, Estevez said.
   ``This one has a wide-screen look with a big, glorious musical
score, and the most accurate depiction of Billy the Kid of any film
ever made on him,'' he said.
   ``Young Guns 2'' is the 43rd movie about the legendary gunman.

   Former comedian Dick Gregory has told a federal
court he can't afford to repay an old friend $105,000 because he
has other debts totaling more than $1 million.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Harrington ordered Gregory to submit
a financial affidavit by Friday.
   Gregory, 58, of Plymouth, borrowed $40,000 in 1979 from Frank
Nicholas II. Nicholas sued Gregory in 1987 to recover the loan plus
interest, bringing the debt to $105,000.
   Nicholas urged the court to find Gregory in contempt. However,
Gregory said in court Monday that he can't repay the debt because
he also owes more than $1.2 million to the Internal Revenue
Service, American Express, banks and other creditors.

FT  22 JUL 94 / Arts: Clash of the piano greats - The start of a concert
tour that brings together two of rock's giants, Elton John and Billy Joel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK LIPSIUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Billed as the battle of the great piano rockers, the 24-date Billy Joel  -
Elton John US stadium tour brings together two confident superstars ambling
through 20 years of their repertoire.
The four-storey high set depicting the American War of Independence with
Redcoats and tricorned Americans conveys less of the regal atmosphere than
the shield atop the proscenium with the legend 'Heart and Soul' flanked by
the British lion and American eagle.
The paired grand pianos on-stage at Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium, where
the tour started with three shows, were closer together than the two
performers, despite a warm embrace at the start.
Elton John acted the shy guest, putting lusty lungs behind the songs with
little audience eye contact. He had been invited to join the show by Joel,
ostensibly after a decade-long courtship, but the dual billing was timed to
coincide with a crowded summer of superstar stadium tours by Pink Floyd,
Barbra Streisand and the Eagles, as well as the packaged events Woodstock
'94 and Lollapalooza (in its fourth year as a Woodstock for alternative rock
acts).
John started with his first hit, 'Your Song', followed by Joel singing
'Honesty'. John did Joel's 'New York State of Mind' saying that they had
agreed to sing one of each other's songs. This made Joel sound insincere in
his effusive intro to John's 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road'.
When they took their turns separately, they sang truncated but generous sets
of their greatest hits. Returning together for the finale, they moved beyond
the predictable with an oldies medley and a duet of the Beatles' 'Hard Day's
Night'.
John used to make his body reverberate with the intensity of his fingers
pounding the keyboard. In this concert the piano still pounded out jangling
harmonies, but his expression was placid. His range of emotion was embodied
in a modest costume change from a loose grey suit to a white linen jacket
and finally a blue satin jacket. Even his spectacles were modest
yellow-tinted half-frames. It was positively demure by Elton's standards.
John got the audience to their feet with 'Philadelphia Freedom', but the
20-to-50-year-old crowd sat for the rest of the hour-long set, which
included his current number-one hit from The Lion King, 'Can You Feel the
Love Tonight', performed like a music video to the film's animated sequence.
The camera caught him at his most animated during 'Baby, You're the One'
gesticulating to his crew to turn his monitor down.
Joel was far more the showman. He soon removed his loose-fitting grey suit
jacket and rolled up the sleeves of his black T-shirt, swinging the
microphone stand as he strutted across the stage.
His good spirits seemed only spurred on by a sudden crisis when his drummer,
who had been food poisoned, left the stage. Joel quickly filled in with
John's drummer, whom he instructed before each song - back to the audience,
arms flailing.
Joel reached deep into his repertoire for songs such as 'Billy the Kid', but
he kept the audience on their feet singing the words.
These were obviously Billy Joel fans, happy to get a look at Elton John and
have a 3 1/2 -hour performance from the two piano rocking greats, but they
were there for the one whose finale 'Piano Man' sent them out singing into
the sweltering summer night.

<HEAD>Gene Barry Reprises Bat Masterson on `Paradise'</HEAD>

   Tarnation, thar's Bat and Wyatt and young
Maverick and The Rifleman's son and a whole passel of Western stars
on the two-hour season premiere of ``Paradise'' on CBS.
   ``I was very excited about playing Bat Masterson again after 25
years,'' said Gene Barry, who comes to the rescue of Ethan Allen
Cord (Lee Horsley) with Hugh O'Brian returning as Wyatt Earp.
   The two-hour show on Sunday is a roundup of old Western stars.
Barry played the cane-carrying dandy in NBC's ``Bat Masterson'' from
1959 to '61. O'Brian was the Dodge City marshal on ABC's ``The Life
and Legend of Wyatt Earp'' from 1955 to '61.
   The Western also stars Jack Elam of ABC's ``The Dakotas'' in 1963
and NBC's ``Temple Houston'' in 1963-64; Johnny Crawford, who was
Mark McCain on ABC's ``The Rifleman'' from 1958 to '63; Charles
Frank, who was on CBS' ``The Chisholms'' in 1979 and CBS' ``Young
Maverick'' in 1979-80; and Charles Napier of NBC's ``The Oregon
Trail'' in 1977 and CBS' ``The Outlaws'' in 1986-87.
   The cast gives new meaning to Old West. The exception is John
Schneider of ``The Dukes of Hazzard.'' He's along for the ride by
horse instead of gravel-spraying roadster, playing Sheriff Pat
Garrett, the man who killed Billy the Kid.
   In ``Paradise,'' the ``over the hill gang'' comes to the rescue
after Horsley is thrown into jail on trumped-up murder charges.
   ``We're a little clumsy at what we did so well 30 years ago,''
says Barry, 67. ``I hope to see it come off because there could be a
future in Bat and Earp. It's a love-hate relationship, like between
Quirt and Flagg in `What Price Glory.' Two old guys who fight and
carry on. I've always felt there's a movie in it.''
   Although Bat Masterson and Wyatt Earp both operated in Dodge
City, the twain never met on television, since they were on
different networks.
   ``I would have had him on my show,'' Barry said. ``He had his own
Bat Masterson. But he guarded his show with his Buntline Special.''
   Barry also stars in the NBC movie ``Repeat Performance,'' which
will be telecast in December.
   The movie, a remake of a 1947 film, stars Connie Sellecca as a
woman who kills her husband at midnight on New Year's Eve and
discovers she can relive the previous year. She knows what's ahead,
but can she change the climax?
   Barry plays her business manager, and the story is told through
his eyes.
   The remake Barry is pressing hardest for is ``Burke's Law,'' the
ABC series (1963-66) in which he played a millionaire homicide
detective who drove to the murder scene in a Rolls-Royce. He hopes
to see it turned into a series of movies similar to ``Perry Mason.''
   Barry also starred in ``Name of the Game,'' in rotation with
Robert Stack and Tony Franciosa on NBC from 1968 to '71.
   He recalled that when ``Bat Masterson'' first came up 30 years
ago he didn't want to do it.
   ``Then someone said he wore a derby hat and carried a cane,'' he
said. ``That appealed to the actor in me. If it hadn't been for that
I would have turned it down. I didn't want to be tied down doing a
Western. I went to wardrobe and found the hat and cane and an
elegant swallowtail coat and shiny black boots.
   ``I looked at myself in the mirror and I knew exactly how to play
this man. The costume dictated my performance. It changed my life.
Every role I've done since has been a guy who looked good in
clothes.''
   It was his stint on Broadway as Georges in ``La Cage aux Folles''
that he calls ``the highlight of my life.'' He was in New York for
three years and then spent another year on the road in the French
farce about a gay couple pretending to be straight for the sake of
Georges' son, his fiancee and her parents.
   ``When the role came up it wasn't a surprise because every year
I'd do a play or take off with my one-man musical revue, `Gene Barry
In One,''' he said. ``I'd try to get back to New York for a musical
now and then. That was my `Repeat Performance.' That's where I
started, on the musical stage.''

<TEXT>
THE loons, the loons] You old poop] Oh, look at you] Remember Katharine
Hepburn and Henry Fonda in the 1981 film? Well, here is the stage original,
at London's Richmond Theatre, and here are real-life husband-and-wife team
Googie Withers and John McCallum. On Golden Pond enables two ageing actors
to be relentlessly adorable all evening long - a pursuit in which they
involve anyone else who passes by.
The scene is the Thayers' summer house in Maine, and out there through the
windows is Golden Pond. (The name is presumably mixed from two real New
England lakes - Goose Pond and Walden Pond. Julian Saxton's set catches the
luminous look of the water and the architecture of such a house to
perfection.)
Over there in the water, the loons call; the loons mate. Meanwhile, indoors
Norman Thayer is getting older and Ethel is coping gamely with his loss of
memory. ('You old poop.')
He is difficult in one adorable way, and she is practical in another
adorable way. Their childless, no-longer-young daughter, Chelsea, arrives
('Oh, look at you]'), and every stereotypical failure of communication
between father and daughter pops to the surface. However, Chelsea - her
parents' daughter - knows also how to be adorable. And she has at last found
Mr Right, and has brought along both him and his 13-year-old kid Billy.
Billy fits right in, for he too is non-stop adorable.
Norman teaches Billy to fish, Ethel picks berries, the loons keep up their
bit. Chelsea marries Mr Right, Norman recovers from an angina attack, the
months pass, and everything in the world of nature helps everyone in this
great big lovely learning process: How To Stay Adorable Till Death Us Do
Part.
On Golden Pond - in whatever version - is not the place to look for good
acting. It is just a vehicle for determined loveableness, and - thanks to
Christopher Renshaw's direction and the script's surefire sentimentality -
everyone rides it for all it is worth. Julia Foster is charming as the
daughter, though she overdoes the winsomeness. Matthew Hearne is duly sweet
as Billy.
Most of the play has Norman and Ethel alone together, and these scenes are
the gooiest. John McCallum is fine as Norman once he has settled into brisk
speech, but otherwise he plays a distracted old dear by exaggerating one or
two obvious shticks - isolating his vowels and letting them slide away like
toboggans.
The best fun is to watch Googie Withers. She retains the same arched brows
and mobile lips that made her famous 40 years ago. Her figure is even more
Edwardian today and her voice is now a husky baritone.
But, whereas she used to be dark and sultry, now she is a model of bright,
no-nonsense energy. She is the person least obviously engaged in tugging the
heartstrings, and her Ethel is the most nearly three-dimensional character.

UNCOMPROMISING WORK BY JOFFREY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cultural reclamation at its most enlightened, the Joffrey Ballet's Diaghilev 
program has always been important for both its renewal of early 20th Century 
masterworks and for making the company itself indispensable to contemporary 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, however, the program has evolved from naive celebrations of 
Leonide Massine to a survey of the roles danced by Vaslav Nijinsky and on to 
the current fascination with the choreography of both Nijinsky and his sister, 
Bronislava Nijinska. 
</P>
<P>
Adding Nijinska's "Les Noces" (1923) to Nijinsky's "L'Apres-midi d'un Faune" 
(1912) and "Le Sacre du Printemps" (1913) -- as the company did at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion on Friday -- raises profound questions about the meaning of 
classicism, virtuosity and our own rather diminished expectations at most 
ballet performances. 
</P>
<P>
Set to yet another of Igor Stravinsky's groundbreaking scores, "Les Noces" 
looks at the social rituals and relationships of a Russian peasant wedding 
through a hyper-mechanized sensibility -- as if the subject were a factory. 
</P>
<P>
Braiding is a major theme, with the bride's hair stretched across the entire 
stage -- and with various groups weaving themselves into impenetrable 
architectural masses. There are also Nijinsky resemblances galore: intense 
group jumps-in-place, with the feet tucked up, straight from "Sacre," as well 
as the concept of individuals cruelly isolated from the social order they 
perpetuate. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Nijinska both validated and extended her brother's controversial 
innovations, and "Les Noces" presents them at their most uncompromising. 
Spectacular group dancing is the attraction here, but Julie Janus (the Bride) 
and Daniel Baudendistel (the Groom) make effective Chosen Ones while Deborah 
Dawn and Joseph Schnell nearly dance themselves to death as their friends. 
</P>
<P>
Irina Nijinska (the choreographer's daughter) and Howard Sayette have staged 
the work with meticulous regard for its astonishing rhythmic force, and the 
original designs by Natalia Goncharova have been carefully reproduced under the 
supervision of John C. Gilkerson. Finally, a phalanx of pianists, vocal 
soloists and choristers (members of the Los Angeles Master Chorale) give 
Stravinsky equal care. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, under Allan Lewis, the score sounds far more powerful than the reduced 
orchestration of the mighty "Sacre" adopted for reasons of economy. However, 
the "Sacre" dancing is always a wonder, with Beatriz Rodriguez more than ever 
brilliant at defining layers of pain and terror in the final solo. In "Faune," 
Tyler Walters offers an intelligent, boldly projected performance of the 
Nijinsky role without ever yielding to the impulse behind the movement. John 
Miner conducts. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, company artistic director Gerald Arpino abruptly resigned and 
prohibited the company from dancing his ballets as of May 4. On Saturday, 
however, two familiar Arpino works graced the Joffrey program -- and executive 
director Penelope Curry said "we're performing the dances with his permission," 
though she declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
The woozy "Round of Angels" (to Mahler) found Valerie Madonia and Baudendistel 
newly cast as the central couple -- each of them accomplished but not yet as 
free as their predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
The rock platitudes of "Trinity" (music by Alan Ralph and Lee Holdridge) 
inspired a blazing performance from Edward Stierle, a classy one from Jodie 
Gates and an unexpectedly playful one from Edward Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
Due to the knee injury of Tom Mossbrucker, the previously reviewed "La 
Vivandiere" Pas de Six replaced Arpino's "L'Air d'Esprit," and Douglas Martin 
danced the title role in Eugene Loring's "Billy the Kid" a day earlier than 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Danced at heroic scale, Martin's moody interpretation of Billy had plenty of 
magnetism and a ruthless efficiency in killing -- but not much of a sardonic 
edge. Walters made a convincing Garett, but Gates looked labored and all too 
corporeal as the dream-sweetheart. Miner conducted the much-loved Copland score 
capably.

<TEXT>
   You'd never catch Rambo attending a writers' convention, but writers often tag along with fighting men, and when they do, the results vary. 

   On the plus side there is Larry McMurtry's latest, "Anything for Billy" (Simon &amp; Schuster, 382 pages, $18.95), about a middle-aged Philadelphia novelist who skips out on his wife and nine daughters to roam the Wild West with Billy the Kid. 
Billy is the first myopic, manic-depressive gunfighter I can remember reading about. 
He bounces across the dusty hamlets of the Southwest, sometimes happy, sometimes low, shooting off his gun -- and occasionally hitting somebody. 
Billy is no marksman owing to his eyes, which water up when he tries to aim, but he doesn't skimp when it comes to using ammunition. 

   He is a casual killer -- he kills children and bystanders with neither a first nor second thought. 
He also is a child himself, and when he is up he's a playful colt. 
Saints and sinners alike find him irresistible. 
One of the saints is the writer Ben Sippy, who is moth to Billy's flame. 

   In principle, I'm against this book. 
Ben Sippy is modernity, a hapless world-weary writer going through a midlife crisis. 
Striking the Prufrockian pose, he worries about his decaying body, the romances he passed up as a youth, the timidities of his life. 
Everybody else rides around on a horse; he's kvetching about his finicky mule. 
Everybody else is a gunman; he faints at crucial moments. 
They worry about flying lead; he's got angst. 
It's as if a Saul Bellow protagonist trotted out to narrate Custer's last stand. 

   The pioneers had it rough enough; they didn't need some schlemiel moping around -- some exile from the 20th century making a joke out of Western lore. 
Nevertheless, Mr. McMurtry is such a beguiling storyteller one is willing to rise above principle and like this book. 
"Anything for Billy" is pure pleasure, though if some committee to preserve the integrity of the Western is working up a petition against the book I'm willing to sign.

   On the minus side of writers tagging along with gunslingers, there is Leon Uris's "Mitla Pass" (Doubleday, 435 pages, $19.95), about a writer who tags along with the Israeli paratroopers as they drop behind enemy lines during the 1956 Sinai War. 
Actually, it is exciting to read this book: Perhaps never before has an accomplished author written a book this terrible -- it's nice to be on hand, if only for the sake of history. 

   "Mitla Pass," which seems to have taken its inspiration from some of the truly awful miniseries of the past, spans the globe in order to come to terms with Big Issues, such as war, literature, the sexual revolution, immigrant roots, Judaism, the Holocaust, communism, Hollywood glitz, success, poverty and the American dream. 
This book is way up there on the Socially Redeeming Scoreboard. 
There's also a lot of sex. 

   Let's sample a single page for a sip of Mr. Uris's gift for hackneyed dialogue. 
On page 44, a young woman is talking marriage to her mom, "Things are different with me and Gideon. 
This is going to be a two-career family," Mr. Uris has her declare, sociologically. 
But Mom just doesn't understand (she's pre-Donahue, after all): "I'm just a plain old Navy wife. 
My career is my man and that's been more than enough for me." 

   Toward the bottom of the page, the bride-to-be gets a letter from Gideon's father, who is Jewish. 
If you punch the words "Jewish" and "prospective daughter-in-law" into your Hackneywrite computer program, you wind up with a sentence very much like the one Mr. Uris puts in the letter: "Enclosed are the recipes to make gefilte fish, matzo brie, borscht, gadempta fleysh, tsimmis, etc. when we meet personally I'll give you a test." 

   With so many books to his credit, you'd think Mr. Uris could at least be craftsmanlike. 
This is depressing.

   If you read only one Albanian novel this month, make sure it is "Doruntine" (New Amsterdam Press, 180 pages, $15.95), by Ismaile Kadare, translated by Jon Rothschild. 
This is a eerie mystery, set in a superstitious medieval Albanian town. 
A daughter has been married off to a distant village, away for three years and out of touch, when one night she reappears. 
She tells her mother that it was her brother Constantine who brought her back. 
Her mother tells her that Constantine is dead, as are her eight other brothers, killed in a war since the wedding. 
Each tale sends the other into shock. 
Both mother and daughter die. 
Was Constantine resurrected? 
The church authorities are concerned. 
Tales of black magic arouse the people. 
The constable must solve the puzzle. 

   "Doruntine" is exciting for the mystery. 
But its most compelling feature is its medieval setting. 
Mr. Kadare evokes a world in which information does not travel, in which nature is mysterious and menacing, and in which people live in a world of dark, batlike terror.

   Hodding Carter has been writing a Viewpoint column for the Journal since the end of 1980, sometimes chiding, sometimes raging at the Reagan era. 
His best Journal columns have now been collected into a single volume, "The Reagan Years" (George Braziller, 202 pages, $17.50).

<HEAD>Prosecutor Questions Cancellation of Martin Autopsy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FLIPPEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PORT CRANE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An autopsy on former New York Yankee
manager Billy Martin was canceled Tuesday at his family's request,
and a prosecutor said that could make it harder to charge the
driver of the truck in which Martin died.
   The Broome County sheriff's department reported slow progress in
investigating the Christmas night accident that killed Martin, 61,
and injured a longtime friend, William Reedy of Detroit, who was at
the wheel of Martin's pickup.
   Sheriff Anthony Ruffo said it would be another day or two before
the alcohol level in Reedy's blood was confirmed through laboratory
tests.
   Reedy was charged Christmas night with a misdemeanor charge of
driving-while-intoxicated and faces a fine of up to $1,000 and a
year in jail.
   Authorities said the pickup skidded off an icy road Monday
evening in front of Martin's 148-acre farm near Binghamton, 150
miles northwest of New York City. Neither man was wearing a seat
belt, authorities said.
   Ruffo said the accident happened at a hairpin curve that has a
history of accidents.
   Icy, slippery roads and Reedy's unfamiliarity with the area were
believed to be factors in the accident, Ruffo said. He said the
speed limit on the road was 55 mph, but did not know how fast the
truck had been going.
   Mechanical failure of Martin's four-wheel-drive pickup was ruled
out, the sheriff said. ``The truck checked out fine,'' he said.
   An autopsy scheduled Tuesday was canceled at the request of
family members, said Michael Doll, spokesman for Wilson Memorial
Hospital in Johnson City.
   Broome County District Attorney Gerald Mollen said he hoped to
persuade County Coroner Patrick Ruddy to conduct an autopsy in
spite of the family's wishes in order to pinpoint the exact cause
of Martin's death.
   But Ruddy said an autopsy would reveal little that an external
examination did not.
   ``He died, basically, of a fractured neck,'' Ruddy said. ``The
chest X-ray was reasonably intact, belly was normal, blood count
was normal. It's all in the neck area.''
   Reedy, owner of Reedy's Bar near Detroit's Tiger Stadium,
suffered a broken hip and possible broken ribs in the accident. He
was listed in fair condition Tuesday at the Upstate Medical Center
Hospital in Syracuse.
   Reedy said he and Martin had gone to a store and then stopped
for a quick drink at a Binghamton bar, said Deputy Steve Glanville.
   Mollen said it would be ``days, at least'' before he decides
whether to charge Reedy with anything more serious than driving
while intoxicated, such as manslaughter.
   The lack of an autopsy would not preclude further charges,
Mollen said.
   Martin purchased the farm in September 1988, three months after
he was fired by Yankee owner George Steinbrenner for the final
time. He said he was attracted to the area for its fishing and
quiet surroundings.
   The feisty Martin made a good name for himself by narrating the
Binghamton Symphony Orchestra's production of ``Billy the Kid'' and
speaking at a local girls' softball league dinner, but he and his
wife, Jill, were also in the news for confronting a group of
children riding horses.
   Mrs. Martin and an unidentified man with a gun chased the youths
off the land, saying they were destroying property and setting
fires, and Martin confronted the manager of the stable that
organized the ride. The stable said it had negotiated an easement
with the previous owner of the land.
   The Internal Revenue Service last summer placed a $35,562 tax
lien on the property, reportedly to cover an alleged underpayment
on Martin's 1987 income tax return. Laurie Ruffino, an IRS
spokesman in Buffalo, said the lien had been paid recently.
   In addition to Martin's wife, survivors include one son and one
daughter, both from previous marriages.
   Funeral services were not immediately announced.

   Audrey Hepburn's recital from the diary of
Anne Frank gave a wondrous glimpse into the young Holocaust
victim's ``hopes, her youthful dreams, her reality,'' composer
Michael Tilson Thomas said.
   The 60-year-old actress, who is goodwill ambassador for the
United Nation's Children's Fund, read from the diary in the first
of four ``Concerts for Life'' Monday night to benefit the world's
needy children.
   The diary chronicled the Jewish girl's feelings as she and her
family hid from the Nazis for two years in the attic of an
Amsterdam office building. Published in 1947, it later was made
into a play and then a movie. Miss Hepburn turned down both roles,
saying they were too emotional upsetting.
   ``I couldn't deal with it, I could not exploit her,'' said Miss
Hepburn, who lived in Holland during World War II and was the same
age as Anne Frank.
   Miss Hepburn finally relented by collaborating on Thomas'
musical tribute, ``From the Diary of Anne Frank,'' which premiered
before an emotionally charged audience of 2,400 at the Academy of
Music.
   ``This is certainly one of the best experiences of my life,''
Miss Hepburn said. ``The words of Anne Frank have lived this long;
and in this music, they will live forever.''
   ``It was as if you were listening to Anne Frank, her hopes, her
youthful dreams, her reality,'' Thomas told reporters.
   Other concerts are planned for Wednesday in Chicago, Friday in
Houson and Sunday at the United Nations.

   Lou Diamond Phillips has been released
from the hospital where he was treated for a broken arm. The actor
suffered the injury after being thrown and dragged by a horse on
the movie set of ``Young Guns 2.'' The Philippines-born actor
received at least 20 floral arrangements, dozens of get-well cards
and phone calls from fans during his weekend stay at University of
New Mexico Hospital.
   Spokeswoman Gail Sutton said Phillips, 28, left the hospital
Monday evening. A gunshot startled the horse Phillips was riding
Friday on a movie set near Galisteo, 20 miles from Santa Fe. His
fractured right arm required 2{ hours of surgery.
   Phillips, best known for his roles as singer Ritchie Valens in
``La Bamba'' and as a defiant math student in ``Stand and
Deliver,'' was returning home Tuesday to Los Angeles, said his
publicist, Eddie Michaels.
   Ms. Sutton said telephone calls to Phillips were carefully
screened, but a few who falsely claimed to be relatives got
through. ``A couple of little kids dropped off cards,'' she said.
   Phillips is playing Jose Chavez y Chavez, a friend of Billy the
Kid, in the ``Young Guns'' movies. Emilio Estevez plays the Kid.

   A judge ordered Billy Barty to pay one of his
former writers $1,300, and the diminutive actor was jubilant.
   The 65-year-old Barty, who has starred in such films as
``Rumpelstiltskin'' and ``Willow,'' said he was happy with Monday's
ruling because he didn't have to award 10 percent of future
syndication profits for his show ``Short Ribbs'' to writer-producer
Bill Winckler.
   ``It went fine, it went very good, I was very pleased at the
judge's decision,'' Barty said being ordered to pay Winckler $1,300
in disputed salary and $28 in court costs.
   Barty said the publicity hadn't hurt his career.
   ``This has gotten about as much publicity as Zsa Zsa and I
didn't even slap anybody,'' he said. ``But I wouldn't slap anybody.
I'd hit them in the knee.''
   Winckler, who sued Barty in small claims court for $2,000, said
he also was satisfied.
   ``I would have liked to have had my 10 percent of the show, too,
but I'm not overly upset about it because I don't know how
marketable the show is now,'' he said.
   Thirteen episodes of ``Short Ribbs,'' described as a ``Saturday
Night Live'' for ``Little People,'' were televised last fall on
Orange County-based cable station KDOC.
   Winckler, a writer for television cartoons, said he agreed to
the relatively paltry fee of $100 per episode because he figured he
stood to make a good deal more with 10 percent of the syndication
fee. But he said Barty wouldn't pay him anything after the two fell
out over creative differences.

   Bill Demby, a Vietnam War veteran who lost
both legs in a rocket attack in 1971, tells youngsters that his
disabilities don't stop him from enjoying life to the full.
   The former army private features in a television commercial by
Du Pont, which manufactures a plastic used in his artificial legs.
He travels around the country, often to cities with Du Pont plants,
to offer hard-earned advice to high school students.
   ``I hope kids can find something in my story that will help them
out when times get hard,'' he said during a visit Monday to Omaha
Northwest High School. ``Maybe when they see my life, they'll
realize that they're not so bad off.''
   Demby said he cannot run as fast as before, nor can he jump as
high.
   ``But I get out there and play,'' he said, ``and if you give me
half a chance, I'll burn the nets off you.''
   After returning from the war, Demby said he fell into a cycle of
drug and alcohol abuse until, one night in a bar, a friend told him
``You don't need this.'' Since then, Demby said, he has made a
slow, steady recovery.
   ``Sometimes you've just got to kick yourself in the rear and get
going,'' he said.

   The American Museum of Natural History has
decided that three heads are better than one when it comes to
dinosaurs.
   The museum has revised its opinion of what the head of an
apatosaurus _ commonly known as a brontosaurus _ looked like.
   But because the museum's 17-foot-tall, 66-foot-long apatosaurus
skeleton was assembled in 1905 and contains bones that are 140
million years old, it was too fragile to withstand a head transplant.
   So the museum has created an exhibit featuring three heads. One
is a copy of the head now on the apatosaurus skeleton, another is a
model that scientists now believe more closely resembles the
apatosaurus' real head, and the third is the head of a close
relative of the extinct beast.
   ``We may have to change our minds again once we find a skeleton
with a skull attached, but we think this is the most likely guess
based on the available evidence until we actually find a complete
skeleton with a skull attached,'' said Lowell Dingus, exhibit
coordinator.
   No one has ever found an apatosaurus skeleton with a skull
attached. The skull created for the 1905 model skeleton was based on
that of a dinosaur believed to be close kin, a camarasaurus.
   Since then, paleontologists have changed their minds about the
apatosaurus' likely relatives. A paper published in 1978 argued that
the diplodocus was a closer kin than the camarasaurus, implying the
apatosaurus had a longer, sleeker head than had been believed.
   When the museum tried to behead its apatosaurus in preparation
for a new skull, ``it sent vibrations down the skeleton and a couple
of the ribs fell off and broke,'' Dingus said.

   A 7-year-old who can't get enough baseball
figured a way to get neighborhood kids to come out to his local
sandlot. He bribed them with soda pop.
   ``I like baseball a lot,'' Billy Green said Tuesday. ``I played
little league for Bartonville `Little Dream Hut' this summer. But
the season's over now. I didn't have anyone to play with.''
   He tried to interest some ``big kids'' in a game, but they turned
him down because they considered him too small.
   Not to be deterred in his quest for one last game before he
enters third grade Aug. 24, Billy decided to up his offer.
   With the help of his 10-year-old sister, Angie, Billy passed out
hand-lettered fliers: ``Baseball Game, Held By Billy Green at
Pleasant Vallay School, Friday, Aug. 11, 1989. 3:00.''
   The key to the flier was the fine print at the bottom: ``Water
and cups supplied. Also Coke, 7-Up and Root Beer. Bring your bats,
gloves and balls!''
   Billy stuck fliers under doors in the neighborhood, and got more
than a dozen boys and girls ages 7 to 14 to turn out.
   ``Some of the big kids are kind of lazy,'' Angie said. ``You kind
of need a bribe to get them to play.''
   The game had a story-book ending as well. Billy doubled and his
team won, 5-1.

   Southfork Ranch can claim a real Ewing now.
   Cheryl Lee McClanahan gave birth to the first baby born at the
ranch on Sunday. So she decided to make a concession in naming her
10-pound baby boy: Tory Lee Ewing Crick.
   ``We couldn't fit in J.R.,'' Ms. McClanahan said.
   The Dallas woman was a week away from her expected delivery date,
but she decided to accompany her fiance, Chase Crick, to the ranch
just east of Parker. Crick had won a two-day stay at the ranch,
where exterior scenes for the ``Dallas'' television series are shot.
   When she realized she was about to give birth, she called a
midwife who helped her deliver the child.

<HEAD>Dance Theater of Harlem Premieres New Arthur Mitchell Work</HEAD>

   After captivating audiences in the Soviet Union
with its magical retelling of the ``Firebird'' and other ballets,
the Dance Theater of Harlem has returned home as part of the First
New York International Festival of the Arts.
   The 20-year-old company opened Tuesday night at City Center
Theater with the world premiere of Arthur Mitchell's ``John
Henry.'' Using various versions of the American folk tune by the
same name, and traditional gospel hymns and spirituals, the dance
retells the legend of the ``steel-drivin' man'' and the times in
which he lived.
   As artistic director and co-founder of the youthful dance
company, Mitchell has staged an energetic dance that utilizes
modern ballet moves and steps with a folk flavor _ there's even a
Texas two-step thrown in.
   Eddie J. Shellman, whose barrel turns and leaps have made him a
stand-out in the company, portrays John Henry. He is a strong
dancer, whose forcefulness does not obliterate his grace. He is
partnered well with Yvonne Hall, who dances the part of John
Henry's perky girlfriend.
   Theara Ward, a young dancer who has a wonderful technical
astuteness in neoclassical ballets, stretches her style as John
Henry's mother. Her moves, though sustained, are nevertheless in
the folk tradition. Lowell Smith is the father.
   Mitchell has placed his musicians, singer and conductor on
stage, which is just fine and supports the folkiness of the piece.
However, when he adds youngsters who gather around to hear Leon
Bibbs sing the legend of John Henry, the stage becomes somewhat
cluttered and some of the dancers and moves are hidden.
   The Dance Theater of Harlem prides itself on preserving American
dance repertory, and does an excellent job of presenting works that
otherwise would disappear because they are not performed. The
company also is good at demonstrating a variety of styles and moods
from the classical ``Swan Lake'' to the neoclassical ``Serenade''
to the contemporary and ethnic ``Dougla.''
   ``John Henry'' is a good addition to the company's repertory,
but it is not necessarily one of its strongest works.
   ``John Henry'' was commissioned by the arts festival, and
Mitchell said it was a tribute to actor-singer-writer Paul Robeson,
``who was a kind of American folk hero, and to John Henry who is an
Amercan folk hero.''
   The company also performed Eugene Loring's ``Billy the Kid,''
with music by Aaron Copland, and the very lyrical ``Serenade,'' a
work choreographed by the late George Ballanchine in 1934 to
Tchaikovsky's ``Serenade for Strings.'' It was the first work
created by the great ballet master in America.
   Mitchell was a principal dancer with Balanchine's New York City
Ballet.
   The company last appeared at City Center in 1984 and made its
Metropolitan Opera House debut in 1985. It toured in Moscow,
Leningrad and Tbilisi, the home of Ballanchine's brother, Andrei
Balanchivadze, in May and June.
   The Dance Theater of Harlem performs at City Center through July
3. The second program includes Michel Fokine's ``Polovetsian Dances
From `Prince Igor,''' originally created for the second act of
Borodin's opera; Valerie Beattis' ``Streetcar Named Desire''; and
John Taras' stunning ``Firebird,'' set to the original Igor
Stravinsky score.

   When they found 11-year-old Billy Ruff
hanged from the big maple tree he loved to climb, innocence died in
the hearts of his brothers and sisters.
   They saw his killer everywhere, in anyone. The surviving Ruff
children _ five living when Billy died 33 years ago, three born
later _ lived with a fear so deep it darkened every waking moment,
terror inspired by a real-life bogeyman who preyed on happy,
fresh-faced kids who loved raisin cookies and baseball.
   Kids like Billy. Kids like them.
   ``All of us, at one time or another, didn't think we'd reach the
age of 11,'' said Tim Ruff, who was 3 when Billy died.
   Then one day three years ago, Christopher Ruff glanced up at the
bulletin board in the police station where he worked and into the
face of the man who killed the brother he never knew.
   ``Mom and I knew, as soon as I called her,'' said Chris, at 24
the youngest Ruff, born eight years after his brother's death and
two months after his father's. ``We both started to shake and say,
`This is it.'''
   Last Monday, he saw the man again _ in Albany County Court,
where he was sentenced to life in prison for Billy's murder.
   It was not murder, however, that put Billy's killer on a wanted
poster; it was a sex abuse charge involving a girl about Billy's
age. The awful secret his family had hidden was that Billy Ruff had
been sodomized before he died.
   ``This sort of thing wasn't spoken about,'' Mildred Ruff said,
sitting in her living room surrounded by six of her children.
``People wouldn't talk about child molesting. It was a hush-hush
thing.''
   Smith Avenue, in the northwestern suburb of Albany where the
family lived, was a street full of children in a rural landscape of
fields and trees the day Billy Ruff disappeared.
   He was last seen at 4:30 p.m. Saturday, Aug. 31, 1957, his
pocket full of raisin cookies, in his hand a length of frayed
clothesline he planned to use to steer a homemade go-cart.
   He didn't show up for dinner. Mrs. Ruff remembers wrapping his
plate of lamb chops, boiled potatoes and corn on the cob in wax
paper and putting it in the fridge. At 9 p.m., she called her
husband at work, and he began a search that lasted until dawn.
   In her fitful sleep that night, Mrs. Ruff had a dream or a
vision, she wasn't sure which: ``I saw Billy, on his knees, hanging
by a rope.''
   That's the way he was found the next day by a friend's daughter
_ hanged with his own clothesline in a densely wooded lot where all
the kids played, and played for years after.
   Police interviewed hundreds of people. ``They didn't care how
many hours they put in,'' said Raymond Rasmussen, one of the first
state police detectives put on the case. ``We got to feel very
close and very compassionate for the family and what they'd been
through.''
   What they could not know was that the killer was there, among
them; then, in the noise and confusion of grief and of police work,
he was gone.
   ``The night of the wake, a priest friend of ours said it may
take 20 years, but nobody can keep this thing to themselves,'' Mrs.
Ruff said. ``And I said, if it takes 20 days, I'll lose my mind.''
   Instead, she found strength and faith, enough to last her family
through Billy's death, the death of her husband eight years later,
and her own current fight with cancer. For years, she carried in
her apron pocket a rosary her husband had given her. The black
beads wore to brown from constant fingering.
   Twenty days became 20 months. The investigation died down. The
police stopped coming by with mug shots of child molesters.
   Seven years passed. The police came around one last time to tell
the family a forensics expert had decided Billy's death was
accidental. His family scoffed; they knew the truth would surface,
a belief that never wavered as 10 years became 20, then 30.
   ``We know what it's like to have a lot of unanswered
questions,'' said John, born four years after Billy's murder. ``But
in the back of our minds, there was always the hope.''
   There was also fear _ of the dark, of being alone, of getting
too close to people.
   ``Everybody grew up with a paranoia,'' Chris said. ``We couldn't
have a normal childhood because we were so damn scared. There's not
one time we can walk into an empty house and feel safe. Not one of
us.''
   Regina, the oldest, 13 when Billy died, and Tommy, who was 5,
told their mother they knew there was a bogeyman because he got
their brother. All the Ruffs _ Regina, Tom, Tim, Joe, Lisa, Jay,
John and Chris _ worried he was out to get another of them.
   ``We'd stand at the window, stand there and watch when people
weren't home on time,'' said Lisa, who was 8 months old when Billy
was murdered. ``I remember standing at my bed in the back bedroom,
looking out the window and knowing I was doing the same thing as
Mom was. We were always scared.''
   The fear became something they lived and breathed. In time, they
would pass it on to their spouses, to their children.
   ``I was terrorized by nightmares most of my life,'' Regina wrote
in a recent letter to her mother. ``I had to force myself to go
anywhere. I was afraid of the dark and of the daylight.
   ``All this destruction, all this fear _ and I am only one of
eight. Multiply the damage to me by every other life this touched.''
   While Billy's brothers and sisters struggled with demons, his
killer was finishing a stint in the Air Force and spending short
periods as an Albany police officer and an ironworker. He married
three times and fathered two children by a fourth woman. In the
1970s he wandered the streets, a homeless alcoholic.
   ``I think he was a man that had this on his mind all that
time,'' Rasmussen said. ``Maybe that caused him to become what he
was.''

JOFFREY IN ARPINO'S 'VIVA VIVALDI' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, Times Dance Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Viva Vivaldi" is one of Gerald Arpino's strangest and most fascinating Joffrey 
Ballet showpieces. Created in 1965 and revived this season, it contains duets 
of great originality as well as group passages just as slick and empty as 
Arpino's recent output. A real back-to-the-future oddity. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, it's curious that Arpino made a Spanish-style divertissement from 
the Venetian composer's Concerto in D for violin, strings and cembalo. And 
those two moody, intimate duets -- each of them ornamented by three subsidiary 
dancers -- are puzzling too, structurally and spatially, very imaginative but 
expressively enigmatic, even private. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the first duet involved 
Elizabeth Parkinson and Ashley Wheater along with three male soloists, while 
the second featured Julie Janus and Tom Mossbrucker plus three women. But the 
formal parallels soon dissolved as each sequence developed its own pattern of 
principal and group interaction and its unique emotional implications. 
</P>
<P>
In the two bravura sections, however, (one dominated by Jodie Gates and Carole 
Valleskey, the other by Edward Stierle and Carl Corry), we saw what has become 
Arpino's M.O.: high-velocity, hard-sell step combinations imposed at random on 
cast and score. And here the ballet blurred into all the generalized 
neoclassical bonbons to come, and they into one another. Let's see, there's 
"Suite Vivaldi" and "Viva Saint-Saens," "Italian Rain" and "Light Confetti," 
"Reflections of Angels, and "Ketten-something" . . . 
</P>
<P>
All the dancing had flair and charm, but Mossbrucker was the major surprise: 
unexpectedly somber and even self-absorbed. A sense of mystery always makes an 
artist interesting, but the quality can be startling when combined with 
all-American surfer-boy looks. If the underwater fantasy "Sea Shadow" (Tuesday) 
depended on this juxtaposition, "Viva Vivaldi" showed Mossbrucker sustaining it 
in a non-dramatic context and making it doubly compelling. 
</P>
<P>
Allen Lewis conducted stylishly, with guitarist Stuart Fox and violinist 
Kenneth Yerke the capable soloists. Completing the program: Paul Taylor's 
"Cloven Kingdom" and Eugene Loring's "Billy the Kid," both reviewed during the 
Joffrey Ballet's recent engagement in Costa Mesa.

<HEAD>`Ghost' Reappears in First Place</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Ghost,'' the Patrick Swayze thriller, has
proved a strong presence at the box office, landing in first place
for the third time.
   Not even ``Dick Tracy'' or ``Die Hard 2: Die Harder'' has been
No. 1 for more than two weeks during a summer that has failed to
produce a blockbuster.
   ``No one would have picked `Ghost' as a top summer picture,''
said John Krier of Exhibitor Relations Co. ``But there it is.''
   ``Ghost,'' about the return of a murdered man's spirit to
protect his lover and solve his own slaying, also stars Demi Moore
and Whoopi Goldberg. It took in $10.2 million at the box office
last weekend.
   ``Presumed Innocent,'' the Harrison Ford courtroom drama about a
prosecutor charged with murdering a former lover, earned $10.1
million and traded places with ``Ghost'' after bumping it from
first place the week before.
   In third with $8 million was the debut of ``Young Guns II,'' a
sequel starring Lou Diamond Phillips, Emilio Estevez, Kiefer
Sutherland and Christian Slater. It is a retelling of the fight
between Billy the Kid and lawman Pat Garrett.
   ``Problem Child,'' despite universally bad reviews, remained in
the top five for its second week, delivering $6.8 million in ticket
sales.
   In fifth place was creepy-crawly ``Arachnophobia,'' capturing
$5.9 million.
   ``Die Hard 2: Die Harder'' sixth with $4.8 million.
   Director Spike Lee's ``Mo' Better Blues'' opened in limited
release and sold $4.3 million in tickets for seventh place. The
movie stars Denzel Washington as a jazz trumpeter playing notes
when not pursuing two women.
   Gone from the top 10 were two of the most touted movies of the
summer, ``Days of Thunder'' and ``Dick Tracy,'' which earned
slightly over $1 million, enough to put it in the six-digit
category with $101 million in earnings over eight weeks.
   ``Days'' earned $2.6 million, and with a total of $73.7 million,
seems hard-pressed to pass the $100 million mark.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Sunday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.
   1. ``Ghost,'' Paramount, $10.7 million, 1,766 screens, $6,115
per screen, $69.1 million, four weeks.
   2. ``Presumed Innocent,'' Warner Bros. $10.1 million, 1,380
screens, $7,374 per screen, $28.3 million, two weeks.
   3. ``Young Guns II,'' 20th Century Fox, $8 million, 1,770
screens, $4,530 per screen, $11.8 million, one week
   4. ``Problem Child,'' Universal, $6.8 million, 1,768 screens,
$3,870 per screen, $22.1 million, two weeks.
   5. ``Arachnophobia,'' Disney, $5.9 million, 2,005 screens,
$2,975 per screen, $34.1 million, three weeks.
   6. ``Die Hard 2: Die Harder,'' 20th Century Fox, $4.8 million,
1,946 screens, $2,475 per screen, $95.6 million, five weeks.
   7. ``Mo' Better Blues,'' Universal, $4.3 million, 544 screens,
$8,065 per screen, $4.3 million, one week.
   8. ``Ducktales,'' Disney, $3.8 million, 1,549 screens, $2,499
per screen, $3.8 million, one week.
   9. ``The Freshman,'' Tri-Star, $3.4 million, 1,044 screens,
$3,295 per screen, $10.1 million, three weeks.
   10. ``The Jungle Book,'' Disney, $2.7 million, 1,478 screens,
$1,868 per screen, $31.7 million, four weeks.

<TEXT>     They don't make Orson Welleses anymore. Welles was a prodigy. At the age of
10 he gave public lectures on the history of art. At 23 he was one of the most
famous radio personalities and actors in the country, making the cover of Time
after the notorious War of the Worlds broadcast in 1938. Welles produced
Citizen Kane in 1941. Some reasons for the film's greatness:;    1. "It is one
of the few films ever made inside a major studio in the United States in
freedom -- not merely in freedom from interference but in freedom from the
routine methods of experienced directors," writes Pauline Kael in The Citizen
Kane Book.;    2. There's nothing stuffy about it. Early on, we see the neon
sign of the El Rancho cabaret, and then we slowly travel across the
dilapidated roof and pass down through the skylight to the interior, where the
boozing Susan Alexander Kane is talking to a reporter. Later, the shot is
repeated in the same order, but this time when we reach the skylight we see
that it is broken -- by the camera, presumably. It's a gag!;    3. The movie
is a devastating portrait of a powerful person, William Randolph Hearst, the
tycoon of yellow journalism, who almost managed to stop the film's release.
Welles never again was given carte blanche to make a film. He exiled himself
to Europe and, despite a few triumphs such as Touch of Evil, eventually became
most famous as a funny fat man and a spokesman for Paul Masson Wine.;  GUESS
AGAIN; IF DANCES WITH WOLVES WINS THE OSCAR FOR best picture, it will be the
first Western to win since Cimarron won the 1930-31 Oscar. What famous Western
character did Warner Baxter play when he won the best actor Oscar for In Old
Arizona, in 1929?;    A. Billy the Kid; B. Buffalo Bill; C. The Cisco Kid; D.
Wyatt Earp; E. Jesse James (Answer below).; ANSWER: C.  </TEXT>
