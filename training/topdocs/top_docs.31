   PITTSBURGH -- John Bassler is an expert at CPR, or
cardiopulmonary resuscitation. So, when his two-year-old
Heidi stopped breathing after accidentally choking on a ball,
Mr. Bassler immediately started blowing air into her nose.
   Nose? Isn't CPR normally done by mouth?

<TEXT>
   Not with Heidi; she's a dog. A big dog for that matter,
all 80 pounds of her.
   Heidi, a Belgian sheepdog Malinois, is among the growing
number of creatures that owe their continued existence to pet
CPR, a technique that uses human-CPR methods on animals.
   The human-CPR technique remains much the same for pets,
except for one big difference. Because a pet's mouth is hard
to seal with a human mouth, air is blown into an animal's
lungs through the nose.
   And, for those who might feel queasy at the prospect of
going lip to nostril with a pet, there is a even a nose mask
that's part of a pet-CPR kit.
   "People who have pets have a bond, a relationship, with
them, so they don't feel quite as gross," says Cecilia
Meshelany-Skinner, chairman of Philadelphia-based Animal
Health Foundation Inc. The foundation, which began courses in
pet CPR in April 1990, has taught nearly 400 people.
   Veterinarians learn animal-CPR techniques in school, but
courses for the lay person are a recent phenomenon. Aimed
mostly at members of kennel clubs, petshop owners and police
canine squads, petCPR courses are also attracting individual
pet owners. And, come September, Ms. Meshelany-Skinner plans
to take her technique to a much wider audience with a
half-hour pet-CPR televison program scheduled to air
nationally on cable TV.
   The technique, while very effective on dogs and cats, is
less so on larger pets. So, while ponies and colts are okay,
a horse is a definite no-no. "It's extremely difficult to
resuscitate by blowing into a horse's nose," Ms.
Meshelany-Skinner says.
   What about pet birds? "You could, but they are fragile. I
doubt if you could do closed-chest CPR," she says, referring
to pressure applied to a victim's rib cage to revive the
heart.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Bassler, who is a city canine officer,
isn't savoring the thought that he may have to administer pet
CPR in the future. "My lips didn't quite touch Heidi's nose,
but I hope I will never have to do animal CPR again," he
says.

<HEAD>Heart Resuscitation in Nursing Homes Works Only Rarely, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nursing home residents whose hearts have stopped
are so rarely helped by cardiopulmonary resuscitation that perhaps
homes should not even offer to try it, researchers suggest.
   Failing that policy change, residents who want to avoid
resuscitation should get their doctors to record that wish in their
medical records and should legally appoint somebody to speak for
them, said researcher Dr. Thomas Finucane.
   Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, called CPR, involves forceful
thrusts to the chest and blowing air into the mouth.
   That amounts to a ``meaningless assault'' when performed on
nursing home residents who have only a tiny chance of benefit,
researchers said. And it imposes costs, such as the nursing time
taken from other areas of patient care, they said.
   Moreover, the community of residents may be disrupted by ``this
generally futile, violent event, often inflicted on a frail and
failing neighbor.''
   Finucane practices geriatric medicine at the Francis Scott Key
Medical Center in Baltimore and is on the faculty of the Johns
Hopkins School of Medicine. He and his colleagues discuss the issue
in the March issue of the Journal of the American Geriatrics
Society.
   They checked hospital and ambulance records for nursing home
residents older than 65 who underwent CPR and then were taken to a
hospital.
   Results showed that 102 of 117 were pronounced dead in the
emergency room and 13 others died later in the hospital. Only two
survived hospitalization, one of whom died two weeks after release,
and the other eight months after.
   ``We conclude that the benefits of cardiopulmonary resuscitation
initiated in nursing homes are extremely limited,'' the researchers
wrote.
   Even if a patient is resuscitated, he is likely to be in pain
from broken ribs and may suffer brain injury from the period his
brain lacked oxygen, Finucane said in a telephone interview.
   Currently, nursing homes generally require that CPR be attempted
on all residents unless a specific order to the contrary is
written, researchers said.
   In principle, Finucane said, a do-not-resuscitate order can be
written after the doctor discusses CPR with his patient, if the
resident can participate, and the family.
   ``What actually happens is, in many, many cases, no one ever
talks to the family about it. And when you do talk to the family
about it, many times the family is extremely conflicted,'' Finucane
said.
   ``The family feels terrible because they're putting their
relative in a nursing home,'' and now the doctor is essentially
asking about letting the relative die. ``They feel this intensifies
the abandonment in some way. So one common thing is that families
make very unrealistic requests to resuscitate patients.''
   As for a request for CPR by the nursing home resident himself,
Finucane compared it to a patient asking for repeated futile cancer
surgeries or for all the blood in a blood bank, even if the blood
type does not match.
   A better approach might be not to do CPR unless the patient or
family signs a form asking for it, he said. Yet, some family
members may do so unrealistically, ``and then there will be
unprotected older people who will undergo meaningless violence,''
he said.
   So he said he ``reluctantly'' favors simply not offering CPR,
even though that removes the option of informed consent to the
procedure, and the chance of reviving the few people who would
benefit.
   ``It's a tradeoff,'' he said. ``It is a flawed proposal, but I
believe it is the best on the menu right now.''
   Ethicist Bart Collopy of The Third Age Gerontology Center at
Fordham University in New York, said the new work raises ``a
crucial question. Just from a medical viewpoint, the notion of
routinely pursuing futile treatment is quite dubious.''
   Collopy said he would prefer that CPR be included as part of a
discussion of an overall care plan with the resident and family.
Failing that, he suggested that decisions on CPR be made
individually. Denying CPR to older people as a group might
encourage similar blanket denials of other treatments, he said.
   The key question he said, is whether CPR would give nursing home
residents a benefit ``by their definition, not our definition.''

   Pet shop owner Patricia Lopes says she
doesn't mind kissing dogs, but she'd rather not perform
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation again.
   ``All I thought about was what do I do with the tongue,'' Lopes
said Tuesday after reviving a greyhound with cardiopulmonary
resuscitation.
   Lopes, who runs a pet grooming store, said she had just finished
bathing and clipping the toenails of Escape, a 13-year-old retired
racer, when the dog collapsed Saturday.
   She heard a thud and turned to find the dog sprawled out on a pet
table, tongue hanging out and eyes rolled back.
   When she could find no pulse, Lopes said she assumed the dog had
had a heart attack and began CPR _ a procedure designed to restore
normal breathing and heartbeat.
   Lopes pressed on the dog's chest and cupped her hands over the
dog's mouth to breath air into its lungs.
   ``After a few minutes, I heard a cough and then a gurgle. I
continued working on her until she could breathe on her own,'' said
Lopes,
   ``Now it seems funny, doing mouth-to-mouth with a dog. At the
time, though, I was only thinking about how to keep the dog alive,''
she said.
   Lopes said she took a CPR course after a friend developed heart
problems, and it was the first time she put her training to use.
   The dog, owned by Roger Roy of Acushnet, is recovering at home
and is being treated with nitroglycerin, Lopes said. Tests showed
Escape's heart suffered some damage, she said.
   Escape's veterinarian, Ted Sherman of Fairhaven, said it is
difficult to say whether Ms. Lopes' actions saved the dog's life or
whether the heart resumed beating on its own.
   Sherman called Ms. Lopes' response admirable but cautioned
against untrained people performing CPR on animals. He said the best
thing to do is call an animal hospital.

Emergency workers who were trying to save an 80-year-old man's life after a
heart attack accidentally contributed to his death, the Ventura County Medical
Examiner's office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Joseph W. Brockmann died after emergency medical workers crushed his ribs and
tore his heart while trying to revive him with cardiopulmonary resuscitation,
according to an autopsy by Assistant Medical Examiner Ronald L. O'Halloran.
</P>
<P>
Two Ventura firefighters had administered CPR on Brockmann after the car he was
driving crossed into oncoming traffic and collided with another car on East
Main Street in Ventura, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
Brockmann continued to receive CPR at Ventura County Medical Center, where he
was pronounced dead nearly two hours after the Tuesday morning accident.
</P>
<P>
"Somebody tried to save his life, and during the process there was a tear in
his heart," O'Halloran said.
</P>
<P>
O'Halloran said Brockmann, who had been suffering from heart disease, had a
heart attack before or during the accident and that he probably would have died
from the accident. Brockmann, who also suffered broken ribs during the CPR
efforts, had Paget's disease, which makes bones brittle.
</P>
<P>
CPR, an emergency procedure that involves applying pressure to the chest to
keep blood pumping to the lungs and brain, is used as a last-ditch measure to
revive heart attack victims.
</P>
<P>
Medical and emergency officials say it often results in broken ribs and bones
but rarely is the primary cause of death.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the heart attack, O'Halloran said, "His chances of surviving were
almost zero."
</P>
<P>
"It was listed as a natural death; the underlying cause of death was a heart
attack," O'Halloran said. Brockmann was wearing his seat belt when the accident
occurred, Ventura police Lt. Don Arth said. Police are continuing to
investigate the cause of the accident, he said.
</P>
<P>
Coroner's officials would not release the name of the emergency workers who
administered the CPR to Brockmann.
</P>
<P>
Doug Carriger, Ventura Fire Department operations chief, said the two
firefighters who administered aid to Brockmann at the accident scene were
convinced it was the only way to save the man's life. Brockmann's heart had
stopped and he was not breathing, he said.
</P>
<P>
"When CPR was initiated, the man was clinically dead," Carriger said. The two
firefighters followed proper procedures under the direction of a paramedic who
had been dispatched by Courtesy Ambulance Service, Carriger said.
</P>
<P>
CPR continued while Brockmann was taken to the hospital and was resumed by
emergency room workers at Ventura County Medical Center, Carriger said.
</P>
<P>
Barbara Brodfuehrer, administrator of the county Emergency Medical Services,
which oversees training for ambulance crews and firefighters, said all Ventura
firefighters receive extensive training to administer CPR.
</P>
<P>
CPR is commonly used by paramedics and firefighters to save accident victims'
lives, but they know it carries some measure of risk, she said.
</P>
<P>
Brockmann's son said the family did not blame emergency medical workers for the
death.
</P>
<P>
"It's emergency work, and it's a desperate measure for a desperate situation,"
said Brockmann's son, Joseph Brockmann Jr. "I want to emphasize that there is
no anger, and I want to find the fireman who did it and make sure he
understands that."
</P>
<P>
The elder Brockmann had worked with the New York Telephone Co. before moving to
Ventura nearly 10 years ago, Brockmann's son said.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Brockmann Sr. had prepared for emergencies by placing a list of
emergency phone numbers next to his bed, with the request "Use No Heroic
Measures" written at the top.
</P>
<P>
"As much as it hurts to have him gone, it's not the tragedy people may make it
out to be," Brockmann Jr. said. "The coroner felt if he would have lived, he
would have been in real bad shape."

<HEAD>Study Suggests CPR Should Be Dropped For Some Patients</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Doctors should explain to the elderly and to
gravely ill patients in the hospital that if their hearts stop,
reviving them with CPR will probably buy them little time and may
be traumatic, researchers say.
   One-third of Americans who die in hospitals undergo
cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, at some time. The procedure
is futile for some patients and should be eliminated for them,
research suggests.
   ``The point is, to give informed consent, you need to know what
the outcomes are going to be or the chances are,'' said Dr. George
E. Taffet, who led a study of 399 CPR procedures at a Houston
Veterans Administration Hospital over a one-year period.
   Patients should be informed about their survival chances before
they decide whether to be candidates for the ``physically and
emotionally traumatic procedure,'' Taffet said.
   Of 77 CPR efforts in patients 70 years or older, 24 percent were
successful, but none of the patients lived long enough to leave the
hospital, he and his colleagues reported in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   Younger patients were involved in 322 CPR efforts, but outcomes
were poor in patients who had cancer, most of whom had spreading
cancer, and in those with sepsis, or blood infections, the study
found.
   Among the 89 with cancer, CPR succeeded 37 percent of the time,
but none of the patients survived to be discharged, and in the 73
patients with sepsis, CPR worked 45 percent of the time, but only
one patient made it home, the researchers reported.
   ``We want to make absolutely clear we are not recommending CPR
be withheld from all patients over 70. ... Age itself is really
only a marker. It should be a flag to the physician that this
should be discussed with the patient ... before a crisis occurs,''
Taffet said.
   A separate article in the Journal argued in favor of allowing
doctors to withhold CPR for nursing-home patients, without the
patient's or family's consent, if the physician believes the effort
would be futile.
   Dr. Donald J. Murphy of Harvard Medical School in Boston said
doctors should be able to issue do-not-resuscitate orders on their
own authority for patients who are very old, chronically ill or
severely demented.
   He argued that the procedure ``is rarely effective, and in many
cases futile in this population.''
   Most informed patients in long-term care institutions do not
want resuscitation, he said, adding that ``physicians are not
required to provide or discuss useless therapy with patients'' and
``recent court cases support the withholding of useless therapy.''
   Murphy said his experiences with patients support his view. He
said after providing them with detailed information about their
conditions, CPR and the intensive-care experience afterward, 23 of
24 opposed resuscitation.
   But other doctors said the patient should still participate in
the decision.
   ``It's their own life. It's the end of their own life,'' said
Dr. David L. Schiedermayer of the Center for the Study of Bioethics
at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.
   ``If they don't get CPR they are going to die. If they do, they
still may die but they may live,'' he said in a telephone interview
Thursday. ``We don't know. We can't predict 100 percent.''
   The government has estimated that 370,000 to 750,000 hospital
patients undergo CPR annually, Schiedermayer said. No one knows how
much each procedure costs, but equipment, staff time and the
necessary hospital-intensive care afterward would put the figure in
the thousands of dollars, he said.
   CPR performed in the hospital may involve equipment and drugs
not used when the procedure is performed on an emergency basis
outside a hospital.

   A 74-year-old man suffered a heart attack
while practicing life-saving techniques in a cardiopulmonary
resuscitation course, but was revived by his instructors.
   Melvin Bishop' eyes rolled up and he fell over while compressing
the chest of a practice dummy during the CPR class Saturday at the
Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. building, instructor Len Heroux said.
   Finding no pulse, Heroux began performing the same compression
technique Bishop had been practicing.
   Heroux was joined by Carl Ireland, another instructor, who
performed compression while Heroux blew air into Bishop's lungs.
They regained a pulse, then lost it again.
   The instructors were joined by Anthony K. Scierka, director of
field operations for L&amp;M Ambulance Corp. and Professional Ambulance
Service, who was at the site demonstrating his paramedic equipment.
   Scierka put a cardiac monitor on Bishop and determined he had
ventricular tachycardia _ an irregular heartbeat that keeps the
heart from pumping blood _ and gave Bishop's heart an electric
shock with a defibrillator.
   As about 20 stunned students looked on, Bishop's heart began
pumping. He soon regained consciousness and began talking, smiling
and thanking his rescuers.
   Bishop was given medicine intravenously and taken to Hartford
Hospital, where he was listed in stable condition.
   Dr. Ronald H. Pariser, Bishop's cardiologist, said Bishop told
him he wanted to learn the technique because ``he didn't want to
have to stand there helpless'' if someone collapsed.

   CPR by paramedics saves almost as many elderly
heart-attack victims as it does younger ones, and should not be
abandoned for older people in an effort to eliminate useless
procedures, a study concludes.
   Some previous research of cardiopulmonary resuscitation has
suggested the elderly may derive negligible benefit from attempts
to revive them after out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Survival
rates in those studies were as low as 1 percent.
   But a five-year study in Seattle showed that 10 percent of
cardiac-arrest patients over age 70 who received CPR from
paramedics survived not only long enough to get into the hospital,
but also long enough to go home. That compared with a 14 percent
survival rate in younger victims.
   In the study period, which ended in March 1988, paramedics
treated 1,407 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests among people age 70
or older, and 27 percent of the victims lived long enough to get
admitted to a hospital.
   During the same period, paramedics treated 1,624 younger
patients for out-of-hospital arrests, and the survival rate to
admission was 29 percent, said researchers led by Dr. W.T.
Longstreth Jr. of Harborview Medical Center in Seattle.
   A total of 140 elderly patients survived after being released,
as did 223 younger patients, the researchers reported in
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Paramedic CPR worked best on heart attacks marked by ventricular
fibrillation, a rapid, uncoordinated and ineffective heartbeat
caused by haywire electrical impulses in the lower heart chambers,
the researchers said.
   The study's conclusions don't apply to patients who have heart
attacks inside hospitals because those patients are much more
likely to have other illnesses that reduce survival.

REAL HEART ATTACK OCCURS DURING CPR CLASS

When Cora Manor began moaning and clutching at her chest during an American Red
Cross first-aid class Tuesday, some fellow students momentarily wondered if she
was feigning symptoms as part of the course.
</P>
<P>
"My first instinct was that they'd planted her in the class to see how we'd
react," said Glenn Emerson of Torrance, who was seated next to Manor.
</P>
<P>
But the students and their instructor quickly recognized that Manor was
seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
"She went, 'The pain! The pain!' and I realized something was wrong," said
Bonny La Monica, a registered nurse and the volunteer instructor of the class
at the Del Amo Fashion Center in Torrance.
</P>
<P>
Manor, 56, of Carson, had suffered a heart attack from a ruptured aneurysm in
her aorta. Her doctor said Thursday that quick action by the class in
recognizing the seriousness of her symptoms helped save her life.
</P>
<P>
At first, La Monica said, she thought Manor was hyperventilating or
experiencing a muscle spasm, but soon she realized it was more than that.
</P>
<P>
"I tried to get her to listen to my voice and breathe slowly," La Monica said.
"She was kind of fading in and out for a while."
</P>
<P>
La Monica took Manor's pulse and others took her blood pressure. The instructor
said she decided to call for an ambulance "when I could see she was not
responding, and her consciousness level was going down."
</P>
<P>
"She was just blessed at being at the right place at the right time," said
Manor's daughter, Theresa Guidroz.
</P>
<P>
At the time, the class was learning cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, a
method of external heart massage.

"Most people with ruptured aneurysms like that don't make it," said Dr. Ramon
Cukingnan, a cardiac surgeon who operated on Manor on Tuesday night at Little
Company of Mary Hospital in Torrance. Manor remained in the hospital's cardiac
surgical unit Thursday evening, her condition listed as critical.
</P>
<P>
"If this had happened at home, if there was nobody at home or some
inexperienced people, there would have been a little bit of delay," Cukingnan
said, and getting immediate medical attention is critical in such cases.
Training people to recognize symptoms and respond quickly "is why we all feel
the CPR course is a very good course for lay people," he said.

Manor was taking the class to update the CPR certification required of foster

"Now you have this information, but I hope you don't ever have to use it."

   For the second time in her career,
flight attendant Nancy Holt has given cardiopulmonary resuscitation
to save a stricken passenger.
   This time, John D. Farmer Jr., 62, of Jacksonville had run to
catch his flight Monday from Atlanta to Jacksonville and arrived at
the plane just before it began taxiing from the gate at Atlanta's
Hartsfield International Airport.
   He asked if he could sit in the first-class section until he
caught his breath, Ms. Holt said. Noting his heavy breathing and
gray color, Ms. Holt asked if he wanted oxygen.
   ``He said yes, took a few breaths and toppled over,'' she said.
The plane was taxiing toward the runway at the time.
   ``That man weighed over 200 pounds,'' said John Fors, an Atlanta
businessman who was aboard the plane. ``That 110-pound lady pulled
him off the seat and began CPR.''
   Ms. Holt, who has worked for Delta Air Lines for 10 years,
remembers wondering as she pulled Farmer to the cabin floor how she
would move him.
   ``I got the strength from somewhere,'' she said. ``I put him on
the floor and he was dead; there was no pulse and no breath.''
   In the meantime, Ms. Holt's supervisor called rescue personnel
at the airport.
   An unidentified doctor aboard the plane assisted her in
continuing CPR, Ms. Holt said. Paramedics revived the man, however,
Ms. Holt said.
   ``He was clinically dead,'' said Mark Johnson, an Atlanta Fire
Bureau paramedic. ``We helped save his life,'' but he stressed that
Ms. Holt's quick action was primarily responsible.
   ``That person deserves equal praise or more.''
   Farmer told Johnson he had been discharged from a hospital just
five weeks ago with a heart problem and had exerted too much effort
trying to catch the plane.
   About eight or nine years ago, Ms. Holt revived a passenger who
had suffered a heart attack aboard a Delta flight, she said.
   CPR proficiency is part of flight attendant's training, she
said, and ``you never forget it.''

<HEAD>Machinery Keeps Blood Flowing After Cardiac Arrest</HEAD>

   A device that takes over the function of the
heart - pumping oxygenated blood throughout the body - could more
than double the number of people who survive sudden cardiac arrest,
researchers say.
   In its first human test, the pump kept blood flowing through one
woman for 15 hours until doctors got her heart working properly
again.
   ``Had they not gotten approval ... to use this machine, I can
question whether I'd be alive,'' said Sharon Wilczynski, 29, who
survived her heart attack although she was clinically dead several
times during the ordeal.
   ``What else could they have done?'' she asked.
   About 10 percent of people who suffer sudden heart attacks
survive. The pumping device could save an additional 10 percent to
15 percent, Dr. Samuel Tisherman of the University of Pittsburgh
Medical School said Thursday.
   ``This is just the beginning in new vistas in resuscitation,''
Tisherman said.
   The device adds oxygen and heats the blood outside the body
before pumping it back inside. It is called an emergency
closed-chest cardiopulmonary bypass. It is designed for use after
the failure of manual resuscitation methods, commonly known as CPR.
   ``If CPR doesn't work within a few minutes, we normally are
dealing with a hopeless situation,'' said Dr. Peter Safar, who
developed CPR and directs the university's International
Resuscitation Research Center.
   The equipment assembled by Pitt researchers is a smaller version
of heart-lung machines that sustain patients during open heart
surgery, Safar said. It consists of an oxygenator, oxygen tank,
pump, heat exchanger, battery pack and several feet of tubing.
   Two plastic tubes are inserted into a patient's femoral artery
and vein at the groin area. Blood flow is maintained so the brain
and other vital organs are not damaged while attempts are made to
restart and stabilize the heart.
   Although paramedics reached Miss Wilczynski within five minutes
of her attack on July 26 and administered CPR, her heart beat only
intermittently and stopped before she reached Presbyterian
University Hospital's emergency room.
   She was hooked to the bypass machine within 50 minutes.
   After two hours, her heart was beating but unstable, so doctors
let her sleep while the machine maintained blood flow. The next day
her rested heart stabilized.
   Tests indicate she suffered no brain damage.
   ``We went to my sister's recently and passed a funeral
procession,'' Miss Wilczynski said from her home in Coraopolis.
``It was an odd feeling, like `there but for the grace of God go
I.' ''

PERSONAL HEALTH: NEW STUDY SHOWS THAT, FOR ELDERLY, RESUSCITATION USUALLY
FAILS, AND MAY EXTEND SUFFERING
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The elderly man has collapsed in the street. He isn't breathing and his
heartbeat is erratic. One bystander rushes off to call paramedics, while
another begins the lifesaving technique he learned in a weekend class,
cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
</P>
<P>
This steady external massage of the chest, alternated with forcing air into the
lungs, may help the old man. If he is lucky, his heart and lungs will start
working again and after a few days in the hospital he'll be sent home.
</P>
<P>
But, if he is not so lucky, CPR will doom him to spend days, weeks or months in
a hospital's intensive care unit -- where he will die anyway. Or if his brain
was deprived of oxygen for too long, he'll leave the hospital in a coma or
demented.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a study published in today's Annals of Internal Medicine puts some
numbers on this tragic twist of fate that doctors say is all too common.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Life-Saving Statistics
</P>
<P>
The Massachusetts study of 503 people over age 70 who received CPR found that
112 of them were revived initially, but only 19 lived to leave the hospital. Of
those, eight were well enough to go home. The rest faced a future in a nursing
home or a rehabilitation hospital; two were severely debilitated, one in a
vegetative state and the other severely demented and totally dependent.
</P>
<P>
These results point out what some doctors have been saying as CPR approaches
its fourth decade of widespread use: That a technique that is routine in
hospitals and on the street is medically inappropriate, even inhumane, to
deliver to some patients, many of them elderly.
</P>
<P>
Across the country, doctors, bioethicists, hospital administrators and
patients' rights groups are tackling this issue, trying to figure out when "do
not resuscitate" orders should be issued and who should be involved in making
the decision.
</P>
<P>
"It's basically the Golden Rule," said Dr. Donald J. Murphy, assistant
professor of health sciences at George Washington University in Washington,
D.C., and principal author of the study published today.
</P>
<P>
"How can we so willingly resuscitate an 80-year-old woman who's trying to die
at home when the vast majority of health-care providers who are aware of the
implications of CPR would refuse that treatment for themselves?" Murphy asked.
</P>
<P>
Ideally, CPR should be started within five minutes of the time that breathing
and the heartbeat stop, to prevent irreversible damage to the brain and nervous
system from lack of oxygen. Damage seems to occur more easily in the elderly,
doctors say, though no one is sure if age itself or the illnesses that
accompany aging are to blame.
</P>
<P>
Firmly planted at one extreme in the "do not resuscitate" debate, Murphy takes
the controversial stance that doctors should issue DNR orders for certain
patients in nursing homes and hospitals without consulting either the patients
or their families. Doctors are under no obligation to inform patients about
medical therapies that are futile, he wrote in an October article in the
Journal of the American Medical Assn.
</P>
<P>
The idea is being talked about so much in the medical community that the
prestigious bioethics think tank, the Hastings Center, is including a
discussion of it in an educational program it is developing for hospital
officials, said Dr. Kathleen Nolan, associate for medicine at the center.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of clinicians agree with him because I think he speaks for their desire
to avoid giving useless care," Nolan said of Murphy. "Clinicians do hate to
fail, and (CPR on extremely ill patients) sets them up for failure. I think
they also don't like talking about these issues with people. But within the
bioethics community there's much greater resistance to the notion."
</P>
<P>
Nolan is among those who concur with Murphy that CPR is being done on too many
people, but who disagree with his proposed remedy. They say doctors of
seriously ill patients should talk to them or their families about the minimal
chances for a successful resuscitation, and let the patients or families
decide.
</P>
<P>
"CPR should be less frequently used but it should be less frequently used
because patients have assumed more of a role in their own care," Nolan said.
"What I would like to see is for people to have more control of all medical
interventions at the time of the death."
</P>
<P>
Survival after resuscitation for all age groups is not as good as might be
expected after more than 20 years of promotion of it by the American Heart
Assn. and the American Red Cross. In the 1987-88 fiscal year alone, the Red
Cross certified 2.5 million Americans to perform CPR.
</P>
<P>
In hospitals, where the chances of being revived by CPR are greatest, the
procedure is performed on one-third of the patients who go into cardiopulmonary
arrest. Ten percent of these people receiving CPR survive to leave the
hospital. Two percent of the survivors are left in a persistent vegetative
state.
</P>
<P>
Overall, it is the otherwise healthy victims of traffic, drowning or other
accidents who are among the few CPR recipients who eventually can go on to lead
normal lives.
</P>
<P>
Paramedics and emergency room doctors know from experience as well as research
that, for an elderly patient from a nursing home, revival by CPR will most
probably doom the patient to days or weeks in an intensive care unit, after
which he will die anyway. Yet half of the in-hospital CPR attempts in this
country are done on people older than 65.
</P>
<P>
Murphy said that his own experience talking about CPR with about 200
nursing-home patients in Boston found only two who wanted to be resuscitated --
a concentration camp survivor and a former professional boxer.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Best Interest
</P>
<P>
For that other 198, he says, performing CPR on them not only would go against
the patient's best interest but also would fill scarce critical-care beds with
people who have virtually no chance of surviving.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, even those who acknowledge this problem are largely unwilling to
abandon resuscitation attempts without getting a patient's or a family's
consent.
</P>
<P>
"As more and more elderly patients with chronic illnesses and severe dementia
fill beds in long-term care facilities in the decades ahead, the problem may
become monumental. . . . (But) until we reach a public consensus about how to
deal with these very difficult issues, individual clinicians and institutions
should continue to separate concerns about patient welfare from broader social
and economic policy issues," wrote Dr. Stuart J. Youngner of Case Western
Reserve University in a response to Murphy's October article.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Paul Miller, a Covina physician and vice chairman of the CPR Committee of
the American Heart Assn., said that the association's first booklet on CPR
promoted it only for use in "sudden unexpected death." With that as the
standard, roughly half of all CPR attempts in the late 1960s and early 1970s
gave good results, he said.
</P>
<P>
The nose dive in success rates since then is a result of it being done to
virtually everyone, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Hockberger, director of emergency medicine at L.A. County
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, said resuscitation is attempted on all emergency
patients there unless doctors know that the patient doesn't want it, has a
terminal, incurable disease or is in a chronic vegetative state.
</P>
<P>
But emergencies by definition often don't let a doctor know such information,
and a doctor can't tell just by looking at someone that CPR won't work well,
Hockberger said. "When you haven't been breathing for 15 minutes, you don't
look good even if you're 35 years old," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The very nature of resuscitation is that if it's going to be useful at all,
it's got to be started within the first three or four minutes of the time the
heart stopped, and that doesn't give you a whole lot of time to investigate all
of these possibilities," Miller said.
</P>
<P>
"Our job is to preserve life. If you're going to err in one direction or
another, I think most of us feel that we'd rather err on the side of trying to
save a life, knowing that sometimes it may have been somebody who was not a
good candidate," he said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Influencing the Debate
</P>
<P>
One also has to be careful about "ageism" influencing the debate with
assumptions that just because someone is old, they must be infirm, doctors
said.
</P>
<P>
"It becomes a question of which elderly," Miller said. "I'm concerned about
putting an absolute age limit on it."
</P>
<P>
"The real question is whether CPR does any good or not," said Dr. Marshall
Morgan, director of emergency medicine at UCLA Medical Center. "Of these 500
people that were attempted to be resuscitated, 10 of them are at home. Ask one
of those 10: Would they be happier if nobody had tried to resuscitate them?
It's a matter of whether the glass is half full or half empty."
</P>
<P>
The most responsible solution to futile CPR attempts, many believe, is for
physicians to talk to their elderly or chronically ill patients in advance
about just how far doctors should go to save their lives.
</P>
<P>
Murphy said he believes that for the most part that won't happen, because
doctors and families are uncomfortable talking about such issues.
</P>
<P>
But patients, too, can bring up the subject, and they ought to, said Sandra
Sweeney, manager of special projects for the American Assn. of Retired Persons.
</P>
<P>
"We would encourage people to discuss this sort of thing with their doctors and
with their families," Sweeney said. "We would encourage them to think through
what their own feelings are about these life-and-death issues. They should
really be very specific: 'I don't want a respirator, but I do want food and
hydration.' "
</P>
<P>
The living will, which specifies a person's health-care preferences but
generally applies only if the person is terminally ill, is recognized as
legally binding in 40 states. (The 10 that don't have living will laws are:
Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota.)
</P>
<P>
If a person feels strongly that CPR and all other medical measures should be
taken to preserve life, that too can be specified in a document known as a
durable power of attorney, Sweeney noted. This option is available in all
states and is applicable also in non-life-threatening situations such as
incapacity caused by a stroke, she said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RESULTS OF RESUSCITATION
</P>
<P>
Despite the advent of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), 400,000 to 600,000
persons die every year in the United States from sudden cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
CPR was first described in medical literature in 1960. Since then it has become
standard therapy delivered by emergency medical personnel and informed
bystanders.
</P>
<P>
Among the general population, its success, defined as the patient leaving the
hospital alive, has been reported as high as 30%, but generally it was about
10%.
</P>
<P>
Among the elderly and some extremely ill persons (such as those with pneumonia
or kidney failure), studies show the success rate of CPR is almost nil.
</P>
<P>
A study published today in the Annals of Internal Medicine considered 503
patients age 70 or older who received CPR. Results of the study:
</P>
<P>
Initial survivors -- 112 (22%) Survivors discharged from hospital, only two of
whom had cardiac arrests outside the hospital -- 19 (3.8%)
</P>
<P>
Survivors with no physical or mental damage -- 9 (1.8%)
</P>
<P>
Survivors severely demented or totally dependent -- 2 (0.4%)
</P>
<P>
Successful resuscitation attempts on elderly patients are extremely rare if:
The cardiac arrest occurred outside a hospital . . .
</P>
<P>
or the patient had several acute or chronic health problems . . .
</P>
<P>
or the resuscitation attempt lasted more than 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The elderly, and anyone else who feels strongly about what kind of medical
procedures should be used on them, are advised to take steps in advance of
illness to assure their wishes will be met.
</P>
<P>
A free booklet on such issues, "Tomorrow's Choices," is available in single
copies from the American Assn. of Retired Persons, Fulfillment, 1909 K St. NW,

<LEADPARA>  Two people's lives have been saved in Santa Clara since January when the fire
department purchased two new devices to jump start a stopped heart using
computer controlled electrical shocks.;    Firefighters say they would like to
see the devices, called defibrillators, in fire stations throughout the city
and the county.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  HEART DEVICES SAVE 2 LIVES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The machine, which can help restore a heartbeat and flow of blood to the
brain through an electrical shock, has been used 10 times in the past three
months, saving two lives. It is used only in cases of full arrest, where the
victim is skirting death. At those times it can be the only thing to save
them.;    "This is a pilot program and we will evaluate it after six months,"
said city spokeswoman Carol McCarthy. "It's a large expenditure. We're glad
they are saving lives. If we find that they are effective, we will look at
getting more from the budget process.";    First for fire engines;
Defibrillators have been used in county ambulances, but these are the first
put in the city's fire engines. Greg Phillips, a training officer with the
department, said that could be where they are most effective.;    "A lot of
people in the city don't realize that the fire department comes to all medical
calls whenever they dial 911," he said. "These days the majority of our calls
are for medical help.";    Fires, chemical spills, gas investigations, wires
down -- the things normally associated with calls to the fire department --
today amount to only around 35 percent of its calls for service, said
Phillips. The rest are medical calls, with as many as half of those for heart
problems.;    Emergency call; One of those calls was from friends of a
60-year-old San Jose woman, Germania Almeida, who was stretched out on the
floor of their house in the middle of a cardiac arrest. Her heart was beating
so fast it wasn't pumping blood, according to a report.;    Within three
minutes a fire engine crew with a defibrillator was at her side and after two
shocks from the machine, her heartbeat and breathing returned to normal.;
"Most likely she would be dead if not for that," said Phillips.;    Despite
its proven successes, many public safety departments have been slow to
popularize the machines. For one thing, at $5,000 each, they are expensive.
There is also the cost of training officers to use them. And some firefighters
are reluctant to try a new technology that is so far removed from their
original job description.;    Some of the cities that have defibrillators keep
them with emergency medical ambulances, something that Phillips said wouldn't
be as effective in Santa Clara as giving them to fire crews.;    Fire engines
are often first to a call, he said, because there are 10 fire stations spread
throughout the city of 93,000, while there are only two paramedic ambulances.
In a case where every second counts, he said, it is best to have the machines
where they will reach a victim quickly.;    The machines are most effective if
used in the first four minutes of an arrest, said Phillips. Officials with the
American Heart Association say that as many as 60 percent of the 300,000
Americans who die from cardiac arrest each year could be saved with early
defibrillation.;    Some experts suggest that before trying manual
cardiopulmonary resuscitation, those near a victim should first call for help.
Currently, CPR training suggests starting CPR and then calling for help.;
Knowing that fewer than 1 percent of those whose hearts have stopped are
revived by CPR alone, officials in the American Heart Association have been
debating whether CPR training should switch to a "phone first" philosophy.;
"There is little doubt in my mind that the more defibrillators we have the
better," said Dr. David Yoon, chief of the emergency department at Kaiser
Permanente Medical Center.  </TEXT>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It won't fit in a doctor's bag but the lowly
household toilet plunger has proved its medical mettle.
   A doctor says a San Francisco heart patient was revived twice by
family members who reached for the plumber's helper.
   Dr. Keith G. Lurie of the University of California-San Francisco
Medical Center related the incidents in a letter in today's Journal
of the American Medical Association.
   He said a 65-year-old man with severe heart disease collapsed
while watching television one evening. His son, poorly trained in
cardiopulmonary resuscitation, tried unsuccessfully to revive the
man by mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and chest compression.
   Lurie said the son then remembered that his mother had
resuscitated her husband six months earlier with a toilet plunger.
So the son got the plunger and used it to plunge his father's chest
for 10 minutes until paramedics arrived.
   By that time, the patient had begun to move and breathe on his
own, Lurie said.
   The doctor speculated that the plunger delivered a ``precordial
thump,'' just as medical experts would have, and served as an
effective chest compressor.
   Lurie said the plunging also may have helped draw air into the
patient's lungs.
   He said the son suggested that toilet plungers be placed next to
all beds in the hospital's coronary care unit.
   ``We recommended that he take a basic CPR course but had to
admit it's hard to argue with success,'' Lurie wrote.

  [Text] The OAS International Human Rights Commission
described to President Ramiro de Leon Carpio during a meeting
held last night at the presidential palace the need for the
withdrawal of all military detachments located in areas where
the Communities of Resistant People (CPR) have settled. The
meeting was held following the conclusion of an OAS visit that
lasted several days to the areas in conflict.
  Leo Valle Lanza, president of the international commission,
indicated they had received reports from the CPR settlers on
harassment by Army soldiers, mined camps, and restrictions
placed on their movements. "It is obvious that as a result of
the proximity of the combat areas, there could be guerrilla
movements, but this does not necessarily imply the CPR are
cooperating with the subversives," Valle Lanza added.
  "The only thing they want is to be recognized as a civilian
population and for their most basic rights to be respected,"
noted the international official who also indicated President de
Leon Carpio had confirmed his intentions to respect those
rights. This is why the OAS delegates consider the
demobilization of the military detachments near the CPR a top
priority. Nevertheless, they received Defense Minister Mario
Rene Enriquez' assurance that no military operation are being
carried out in those areas.
  The international commission was made up of Valle Lanza,
David Padilla, Elizabeth Houppert, and Osvaldo N. Kreiner. The
commission was accompanied by Fernando Alvarez Guadamuz who
indicated they had visited Xalbal, Cantabal, Cuarto Pueblo, San
Francisco Los Angeles, San Luis, and La Esperanza; they also
spoke to the soldiers of the nearby detachments.

POOL OFFICIAL HAS STROKE AFTER ONE MAN DROWNS

In a tragic chain of events Friday, an Irvine man died after losing
consciousness at the bottom of a community swimming pool and during the ensuing
commotion the manager of the pool collapsed from a near-fatal stroke.
</P>
<P>
About 50 people were swimming and playing in the Olympic-size pool when the man
disappeared under 9 feet of water. Many of the people were young children
participating in summertime swimming classes. It took a few minutes for the
stricken man to be rescued, police said, party because other pool-goers at
first thought he was swimming underwater.
</P>
<P>
The man, identified by police as Dinh Quan, 54, was pronounced dead on arrival
at College Hospital Costa Mesa after the 4:25 p.m. incident at the Village Park
Recreation Center pool in the 4500 block of Michelson Drive.
</P>
<P>
The pool manager, identified by police and relatives as Mary Hatt, 45, of
Irvine, was listed in critical condition at Healthcare Medical Center of
Tustin. Her husband, Daryle Hatt, who was at the pool at the time, said late
Friday that his wife had suffered a stroke and was not responding to treatment.
</P>
<P>
Hatt said that his wife was on-site manager of the pool, which is operated by
the Village Park Homeowners Assn. in the University Park section of Irvine. The
pool is open to members and guests of the 636-home association.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of Quan declined comment when reached at the College Hospital
emergency room.
</P>
<P>
An autopsy was to be conducted on Quan to determine the cause of death, Rodgers
said. According to witnesses at the scene, Quan had been at the bottom of the
pool for at least four minutes, police said, and was registering no pulse when
rescuers pulled him out.
</P>
<P>
"You could just see that he was full of water," said Alex Abshier, a swim
instructor who dove down to retrieve the stricken man. "He was all bloated and
blue."
</P>
<P>
According to Police Sgt. Ron Flathers, one swim student was practicing in the
deep end of the pool when he noticed a man lying face-down on the bottom in the
deep section.
</P>
<P>
At first, Flathers said, the student thought the man was holding his breath,
but then realized something was amiss. The student yelled for Abshier to help.
Abshier, who was teaching a child at the shallow end of the pool, said he swam
over immediately as a lifeguard sitting in a tower also ran to help.
</P>
<P>
"I saw him lying there so I carried him up to the top of the surface," said
Abshier, 20, an Irvine resident and UC Irvine student. "The lifeguard ran
around the deck and helped me pull him out of the water. I yelled for someone
to call 911. Then I began CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) and
mouth-to-mouth. But he wasn't breathing at all. He had no pulse."
</P>
<P>
While the rescue efforts were under way, witnesses said Hatt was excitedly
telling everyone to get out of the pool. Suddenly, Flathers said, she began
experiencing severe breathing problems and sat down on a lounge chair near the
stricken Quan. Signy Peck, 19, a swim coach from Irvine who happened to be
nearby, said Hatt appeared to be crying and was perspiring heavily.
</P>
<P>
"She looked very upset," Peck said. "I asked, 'Are you OK, Mrs. Hatt?' She
turned away and kind of collapsed."
</P>
<P>
While trying to revive Quan, Abshier said he remembers hearing Peck yelling
that a woman needed CPR.
</P>
<P>
"It was really scary," Abshier said. "I was thinking, 'What is going on?' "
</P>
<P>
It took Irvine police and paramedics between three and five minutes to arrive
after being called, witnesses at the pool said. In the meantime, Peck and a
friend visiting from Boston, Sarah Selder, 19, tried to revive Hatt. They took
turns applying mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and checking her pulse.

<HEAD>New Devices Could Save Many Cardiac Arrest Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New, easy-to-use heart shock machines are a
``very, very important advance'' that improve the odds of saving
many of the 400,000 Americans who die each year of cardiac arrest,
researchers reported today.
   Researchers in Seattle found that giving the devices to
firefighters allowed them to revive heart victims who would have
died if care were left to paramedics who arrived just minutes
behind them.
   ``There is no question that this is a very, very important
advance in treating prehospital cardiac arrest victims,'' said Dr.
Donald D. Brown, who has worked with the devices at the University
of Iowa.
   The machines cost between $4,000 and $7,000 and are highly
sophisticated versions of the defibrillators, which doctors and
paramedics have used for decades. But unlike their forerunners,
these devices are so automated they require little training to
operate.
   When attached to the chest of someone who has collapsed, the
device will check the victim's heart and deliver a shock if it
finds cardiac arrest, a disastrous interruption in the heart's
blood-pumping rhythm. If given soon enough, the shock almost always
restarts the stalled heart.
   Dr. W. Douglas Weaver of Harborview Medical Center in Seattle,
who directed the study, recommended that the devices be available
in police cars, fire trucks, ambulances, office buildings, stadiums
and anywhere crowds gather.
   ``Many communities that have not been able to deliver definitive
care to cardiac arrest victims will be able to do so with the
advent of this new technology,'' Weaver said in an interview.
   Weaver's work was published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Jeremy N. Ruskin of
Massachusetts General Hospital called cardiac arrest ``the most
important public health problem in the United States.''
   The Seattle results with the automatic defibrillator ``provide
strong support for its use by those first on the scene,'' he wrote.
   ``Their conclusions are very important and very valid,'' said
Dr. Philip Podrid of Boston University Medical Center. ``This is an
electrical problem. It requires immediate response and definitive
therapy.''
   During cardiac arrest, the heart suddenly stops pumping blood
due to a disruption in its electrical signals, and the victims
falls unconscious. Unless the heart starts beating within four to
eight minutes, brain damage or death are likely.
   Most victims have not had heart attacks. So if their heartbeat
is restored quickly, they often live for years without permanent
heart damage.
   Frequently the first to respond to cardiac arrest are
firefighters or police, who administer cardiopulmonary
resuscitation but not electric shocks.
   ``You can do the best CPR in the world, and unless you can
deliver a shock in that eight-minute window, the likelihood of
survival goes down dramatically,'' Weaver said.
   In the study, Seattle firefighters were given four hours of
training in use of the new defibrillators. Firefighters who arrived
first to treat someone gave shocks to 276 patients, while 228
others got only CPR until paramedics showed up a few minutes later.
Thirty percent of those treated first by the firefighters survived,
compared with 17 percent of those given shocks by later-arriving
paramedics.
   Just how many people would be saved if the devices were widely
available is unclear. However, Weaver estimated that in communities
where only 5 percent or 10 percent of cardiac arrest victims are
saved, the devices might raise survival to 25 percent, and in areas
with more sophisticated emergency services, a third or a half might
be saved.

GATHERS: LESSON OF THE HEART;
</P>
<P>
SUDDEN DEATH: MORE PEOPLE DIE OF HEART-RHYTHM DISORDERS THAN CANCER. FINDING
AND TREATING HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS IS A PRIORITY FOR THE '90S.
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David S. Cannom, David S. Cannom is an electrophysiologist at the Hospital
of the Good Samaritan in Los Angeles, president of the Los Angeles affiliate of
the American Heart Assn. and a member of the Coalition for the Prevention of
Sudden Cardiac Death.
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If any good is to come out of the Hank Gathers tragedy, it will be in helping
to prevent such a premature ending to other lives, whether young or old.
</P>
<P>
The problem of sudden and unexpected death caused by cardiac arrhythmias is a
huge public-health issue. The American Heart Assn. estimates that 400,000
Americans will die this year in the United States of a lethal heart-rhythm
disorder -- more than will die of cancer and roughly half of the 700,000 annual
deaths from cardiovascular causes.
</P>
<P>
Yet the American public knows little about sudden death and, to some extent,
that is also true within the medical profession.
</P>
<P>
Which types of structural heart disease -- disease of the heart muscle and
coronary arteries -- are most commonly associated with serious heart rhythms?
Most such conditions are diseases of men and women more than 35 years of age
and not of young athletes. By far the most common cause of sudden death over
age 35 is coronary artery disease. In patients dying suddenly under age 35,
congenital heart disease -- heart disease present from birth -- is the most
common cause.
</P>
<P>
Which are the high-risk groups of patients? Experts estimate that approximately
25% of all patients experiencing a heart attack -- which doctors call a
myocardial infarction, usually caused by a clot in the narrowed coronary artery
-- have sudden death as their first and only symptom. In retrospect, such
patients have often had vague complaints but were unaware of any heart trouble
until they abruptly fibrillated and died. This group numbers hundreds of
thousands of patients a year. A typical victim is the 45-year-old jogger who
keels over on his Saturday morning run and dies.
</P>
<P>
We cannot yet specifically screen this group of patients in terms of
sudden-death risk. The best we can do is screen for risk factors associated
with early coronary disease, including high cholesterol, cigarette smoking and
high blood pressure. We know that if we can lower or eliminate coronary
disease, the risk of sudden death will be lowered as well. Large numbers of
people without symptoms -- asymptomatic individuals -- must be screened if we
are to identify a sizable high-risk population, much less prevent any but a few
sudden deaths. More specific non-invasive screening and preventive techniques
for sudden death are necessary to help this large population of completely
asymptomatic patients. Although sudden death rates in this group are falling,
much remains to be done.
</P>
<P>
Groups with a statistical risk of sudden death, higher than among the
asymptomatic people, have been clearly identified over the past decade. A
patient who experienced a prior heart attack has a 6% risk of death in the
first year of recovery; half these deaths are sudden. The risk of death rises
steeply if the heart attack was large or associated with serious ventricular
rhythm disorders. Former Commissioner of Baseball A. Bartlett Giamatti was such
a sudden-death victim.
</P>
<P>
Most cardiologists aggressively screen patients after a heart attack for both
serious arrhythmias and extensive muscle damage, using a combination of
invasive and non-invasive testing to identify the high-risk patient.
Considerable controversy still exists, however, about which treatment is best
to prevent subsequent sudden death. Large population studies, such as the
highly publicized Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST), help teach us
which medicines, if any, best control abnormal heart rhythm.
</P>
<P>
The highest-risk patients are those who have survived a previous cardiac arrest
or have required an electrical cardioversion. Patient groups with up to a 40%
one-year risk of recurrent cardiac arrest can be identified. Such patients are
aggressively treated in most centers with implantable defibrillators or
open-heart procedures to correct the arrhythmia. Most progress of the last
decade has been made with such patients. If appropriately treated, such
patients can have their one-year risk of sudden death reduced to about 1%.
While highly visible, this patient group nonetheless represents only a small
percentage of the total number who will die suddenly this year.
</P>
<P>
Other heart conditions associated with an increased incidence of sudden death
include cardiomyopathy, mitral valve prolapse, the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW)
syndrome and the long-QT syndrome. The latter two conditions are rare, although
of great interest to cardiologists as models of electrical short-circuits in
the heart. Mitral valve prolapse is commonly diagnosed but rarely causes sudden
death. Cardiomyopathy, or primary heart muscle disease, is usually acquired
following a virus infection. Hank Gathers' post-mortem examination showed such
a diffuse cardiomyopathy.
</P>
<P>
About half the athletes who die suddenly have a different kind of muscle
disease called a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Such hearts are always thick and
"muscle-bound," either in part or all of the cardiac structure. However, such a
condition does not spell a potential episode of sudden death unless coupled
with a serious ventricular rhythm disturbance.
</P>
<P>
There is no agreement on how to screen young athletes for potential risk of
sudden death if they are truly asymptomatic. Mass screening programs involving
physician examinations and non-invasive testing are not cost-effective. As many
as 200,000 asymptomatic competitive athletes under 30 need to be thoroughly
screened to identify one potential sudden death victim.
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the Gathers case is typical of what we know about the
sudden-death victim. He had a history of a skipping, rapid pulse. He had
blacked out during a basketball game in December but quickly revived. Such a
symptom is a red flag of concern in any age group.
</P>
<P>
Subsequent testing by experts in heart-rhythm disorders identified irregular
beats originating from the lower portion of his heart as the cause of the
blackout. He was given specific medication to treat the irregular rhythm; there
was an implication that if he took the medication he would be protected from
serious problems. The medicine, a beta blocker, slowed his enormous talents --
and he may have cut back on the drug. He then collapsed during a game in March
and could not be resuscitated. The triad -- loss of consciousness in the
presence of serious extra heart beats and known muscle damage -- identified him
as being at high risk, no matter what his age group or underlying cardiac
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
The other cornerstone of sudden-death prevention -- in addition to detection
and treatment of the high-risk patient -- is cardiopulmonary resuscitation --
CPR. The American Heart Assn. and Red Cross teach thousands of volunteers each
year how to perform CPR. Citizen CPR in conjunction with a rapid-response
paramedic system can successfully resuscitate a high percentage of patients who
collapse from cardiac arrhythmias. In cities such as Seattle and Miami, where
paramedics respond quickly and half the citizenry knows CPR, up to 30% of
sudden-death victims will be resuscitated and eventually discharged from the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Sadly, resuscitation did not occur in the gymnasium when Hank Gathers had his
serious arrhythmia. Such missed opportunities are repeated in shopping malls,
city streets and homes of heart patients 1,000 times each day in this country.
</P>
<P>
The next decade will see cardiologists further cut the sudden-death toll. More
patients with the combination of serious arrhythmias, symptoms and known heart
disease will be referred for treatment. More effective, less-toxic medications
will be developed. Better implantable devices will be perfected. Large
population studies will tell us which patients need the most aggressive
treatment and which need only reassurance. More citizens will learn and
practice CPR, perhaps in a simpler form.
</P>
<P>
If Gathers' death has helped alert us to the scope of the problem and its
prevention, then the tragedy will have served some human purpose.

<HEAD>Red Cross Launches Campaign To Prevent Child Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Red Cross launched a national
campaign Wednesday aimed at preventing child deaths from choking,
suffocation and drowning.
   The Infant and Child CPR Campaign encourages parents,
grandparents, baby sitters and other care-givers to learn how to
handle breathing emergencies in infants and children.
   Actress Lynda Carter, who has an 18-month-old boy, lent her name
to the campaign.
   ``There's a lot a parent can do before the ambulance arrives,''
said Robert Burnside, director of health services for the American
Red Cross.
   The Heimlich maneuver, however, is not among them.
   That method of using abdominal thrusts to dislodge obstructions
in the breathing passages works on choking adults but does more
harm than good when used on a baby, Burnside said.
   A choking baby needs to be held in a certain way and be given a
series of blows to the back and thrusts to the chest to restore
breathing, he said.
   The technique taught in the American Red Cross Infant and Child
CPR course was highlighted in a segment of the CBS daytime drama
``The Young and the Restless'' Wednesday when a choking emergency
occurred to a young child.
   Besides choking emergencies, the seven-hour Red Cross course
teaches mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing, cardiopulmonary
resuscitation and injury prevention.
   Thousands of children who die from choking, suffocation and
drowning could be saved if more adults knew how to respond to the
emergencies, Burnside said.
   Choking and suffocation are leading causes of accidental deaths
in children under 1 year old, according to the Johns Hopkins
University Injury Prevention Center.
   Among children ages 1-4, drowning is the second leading cause of
accidental deaths after motor vehicle accidents.

   A small boy who nearly drowned in
his family's backyard Jacuzzi in January died after a second
accident in which he fell into the family pool.
   Charles Jacob Greenlees, 2, was found floating in the pool
Wednesday by a baby sitter.
   The boy had been left alone for about five minutes and toddled
across the fenced front yard of his home, opened a screen-door
latch to the rear patio and fell in the pool.
   An hour later, he was pronounced dead at Martin Memorial
Hospital, about 140 miles north of Miami, despite efforts by his
baby sitter and rescue squads to revive him.
   In January, the child had been saved when his mother, Sharon
Greenlees, gave him cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   Greenlees, who teaches CPR for the American Heart Association,
said after the close call that she hoped her the near-tragedy would
encourage all parents to take CPR training.

13-YEAR-OLD MAKES VALIANT BUT FUTILE EFFORT TO SAVE A LIFE

An elderly Tierrasanta woman died Sunday, despite the efforts of a 13-year-old
girl who performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation while receiving instructions
over the telephone from a 911 dispatcher.
</P>
<P>
Jessica Dale, whose father is a radioman on the aircraft carrier Independence,
was selling magazine subscriptions near her home in the Murphy Canyon military
housing complex at 3:20 p.m. when she knocked on the door of a house on Fino
Drive, a San Diego Fire Department spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
Jessica heard the television on and looked through the screen door to see a
76-year-old woman lying unconscious on the floor, the spokeswoman said. The
woman's name was being withheld pending notification of her relatives.
</P>
<P>
Jessica said an 8-year-old friend with her became frightened and ran home, but
that she went inside and called 911.
</P>
<P>
"I thought she had just passed out, so I patted her hand to try and wake her
up," Jessica said. "But she wasn't moving . . . "
</P>
<P>
With the emergency dispatcher instructing her, Jessica said, she pulled a piece
of apple from the woman's mouth and performed CPR, which she had never done
before.
</P>
<P>
"She wasn't breathing and she was bleeding (from striking her head when she
fell) and tangled in her walker, so I couldn't get her turned over right away,"
Jessica said.
</P>
<P>
Paramedics and police arrived two minutes later and took over the life-saving
efforts, but the woman, who regained a pulse in the ambulance, died of cardiac
arrest at Sharp Memorial Hospital, the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
Paramedics were so impressed with Jessica's maturity and calm behavior in
performing CPR that they nominated her for a Fire Department lifesaving award,
the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm still shaking," Jessica said six hours after the incident. "I was thinking
only about trying to help her."
</P>
<P>
Jessica's mother, Mary, said she was not surprised by her daughter's actions.
</P>
<P>
"She is very assertive and aggressive and eager to help," Dale said. "I told
her God wanted her to be there for a reason, to try to help that woman."
</P>
<P>
Jessica, who attends Gasper DePortola Junior High School, was visibly shaken
when police took her home after the incident, but Dale said the kind words of
police, paramedics and the elderly's woman's daughter and grandson, who also is
a paramedic, had reassured her daughter.
</P>
<P>
"I think she needed to know that she did her best," Dale said. "She is very
upset the woman died, but she knows she did all she could."

  [Text] Yesterday, Vice President Arturo Herbruger Asturias
denied any possibility that the government and the Army are
planning an offensive against residents of the Communities of
Resistant People (CPR). "The Defense Ministry has already denied
such accusations. It clearly stated that there will not be
unreasonable actions against them or that there will be any
persecution," he added.
  In paid advertisements, CPR members claim that since 10
February, there have been "large military mobilizations"
apparently aimed at subjecting them to military control,
preventing them from rebuilding the Ixcan Grande Cooperative,
and stopping more refugees from returning.
  Herbruger noted that far from organizing acts to intimidate
or affect these people, the government is involved in efforts to
protect them.
  Deputy Foreign Minister Bernardo Arevalo also said the
members of the OAS Inter-American Human Rights Commission
(CIDH), who recently visited these communities, did not tell the
Foreign Ministry about similar complaints. Arevalo said that in
the letter requesting permission to visit the CPR's, the CIDH
did not mention this as a motive and only limited itself to
saying that it wanted to observe the reintegration of refugees
into the communities process.

   Mary Bea Porter couldn't save her golf
game, but she made a much more important save _ the life of a
3-year-old boy.
   Porter was trying to qualify for next week's LPGA tournament
when she jumped a 6-foot fence and revived the boy, who almost
drowned Wednesday in a backyard pool bordering the Moon Valley
Country Club course.
   Porter, 38, said she was lining up her second shot on the 13th
fairway when she saw Jonathon Smucker face down in the water. The
child's father, Christian, jumped into the pool fully clothed and
pulled out his son.
   ``But when I saw the father begin to shake the child and yell at
his wife (Anna) if she knew CPR, I knew that we were in trouble,''
said Porter, who added that she had no previous experience in
cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   Porter said her caddy, who also didn't know CPR, helped her jump
the fence and she approached the father, who handed her the child.
   ``I thought he was dead. He was turning grey,'' she said. ``I
knew I had to do something. ... So I threw him on the ground,
reached in and cleaned out his mouth, moved his tongue to the side
and blew.''
   Finally, she said, she saw ``his little lungs inflate.''
   The child was crying in Porter's arms by the time paradmedics
arrived. He was in good condition Thursday at St. Joseph's Hospital
and Medical Center. The boy was visiting Phoenix from Ronks, Pa.,
with his parents.
   ``There is no doubt in our minds that Porter saved his life,''
said Fire Department spokesman Steve Jensen.
   And the golf game?
   Porter, who has won $50,000 in 15 years on the ladies pro golf
tour, bogeyed two of the next three holes, finished the round at 76
and missed qualifying for the Standard Register Turquoise Classic
by three shots.
   Still, she said, ``I feel like I just won a million
tournaments.''

   Passenger deaths during airline flights are
extremely rare, but crews are not adequately prepared and medical
equipment aboard airliners is insufficient to deal with the
problem, researchers conclude.
   ``Airlines simply can't count on doctors being aboard flights,''
said Dr. Richard Cummins, one of five authors of a study published
in Friday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   ``They should take a look at the duration of the flight, the
number of passengers aboard and determine what additional measures
are needed,'' added Cummins, an associate professor of medicine at
the University of Washington at Seattle.
   An average 72 passengers die during flights each year, which
researchers called ``a vanishingly small rate'' of three deaths per
10 million passengers.
   The study reviewed deaths reported from 1977 to 1984 to the
International Air Transport Association, which has 120 members and
carries 50 percent to 60 percent of the world's scheduled
international and domestic air traffic.
   Researchers concluded that 56 percent of the deaths appeared to
be heart-related.
   Nearly two-thirds of the deaths during flight involved men,
whose average age was 54. Doctors aboard the aircraft came forward
to offer assistance in 43 percent of the deaths, the study found.
   Researchers concluded, however, that programs are needed to
train flight attendants in the skills of basic cardiopulmonary
resuscitation and the use of automatic external defibrillators, the
electric-shock ``heart starters,'' said Cummins.
   ``They are not part of the on-board medical kits now, and we're
not advocating they be added to every flight,'' he said. ``But some
flights should have them.''
   ``If flight attendants can be trained to open airplane doors in
an emergency, they can be trained to operate a defibrillator,'' he
said. ``And the machine provides a simple way to diagnose many
kinds of cardiac arrest.
   William Jackman, spokesman for the American Transport
Association, a trade organization representing U.S. airlines, said
flight attendants on most major carriers already receive training
in CPR skills.
   Earlier this week, Delta Air Lines attendant Nancy Holt used CPR
to save a stricken passenger for the second time in her career. A
man collapsed just after boarding her plane in Atlanta and an
unidentified doctor on board helped her until paramedics arrived at
the airport.
   CPR proficiency is part of flight attendants' training, Ms. Holt
said, and ``you never forget it.''
   Jackman noted the Federal Aviation Administration did not
include defibrillators in its August 1986 guidelines on mandatory
equipment for airline medical kits. Those guidelines are scheduled
for review this summer.
   ``Basically, our policy has been to land as soon as possible,
and in this country, that means no more than 20 or 30 minutes no
matter where you are,'' said Jackman.
   ``Crews call ahead for medical teams at the runway and, once on
the ground, we're certain that experienced, capable doctors are
providing treatment,'' he added.
   ``And we just can't ask flight attendants to diagnose an ailment
... to know the difference between a heart attack and say, a
diabetic one,'' said Jackman.
   Cummins countered that a delay of 20 minutes or longer could
prove fatal in instances of sudden cardiac arrest.
   ``The law doesn't obligate the airlines,'' Cummins said, ``but
it's time they started taking responsibility in some of these
emergencies.''

PHONE ADVICE SAVES BABY WHO FELL IN POOL

<TEXT>
<P>
The 911 emergency call about 1 p.m. Sunday came to Jonathan Wilkes, 31, a fire
dispatcher in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
"The mother's voice was hysterical," Wilkes said. "The first thing she said
was: 'My daughter is drowning!' "
</P>
<P>
The victim was a 14-month-old girl who had fallen into a swimming pool at her
home on North Garland Lane in Anaheim. As Wilkes talked to the mother,
verifying the address, his partner at the dispatch center, David Paschke,
notified the paramedic station closest to the child's home.
</P>
<P>
Wilkes tried to calm the mother. Over the phone, he gave her step-by-step
instructions on how to try to revive the baby with cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR). The effort succeeded. Wilkes, over the telephone, could
hear the baby, who had not been breathing, begin to cry about 2 minutes after
Wilkes told the mother what to do.
</P>
<P>
About 3 minutes later, the Anaheim Fire Department paramedics arrived at the
house. "I was afraid we'd get there and find a child drowning victim," said
Anaheim Fire Capt. Alex MacLean of Engine 5. "Instead we found a baby that was
breathing and crying and screaming. It looked to me like the baby was going to
be fine."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Baby's Condition 'Good'
</P>
<P>
Doctors later agreed. The baby, Tiffany Eichmann, first was taken to Kaiser
Permanente Anaheim Medical Center and then was transferred to Childrens
Hospital of Orange County in Orange for observation. A spokeswoman at Childrens
Hospital said Sunday night that the baby's condition was "good" and that she
did not require treatment in the intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
Fire Department officials on Sunday credited dispatcher Wilkes with being the
hero in the lifesaving drama. Noting that minutes -- sometimes even seconds --
can make the difference between death or brain damage in a near-drowning
episode, the fire officials said Wilkes' calm, quick action saved Tiffany.
Department officials said they did not have the names of Tiffany's mother or
other relatives.
</P>
<P>
"Jonathan did a fantastic job," said his supervisor, lead dispatcher Diane
Boyles. "We've just completed training for our personnel as emergency medical
dispatchers and that means they can give instructions over the telephone." She
added that Wilkes' telephone work on Sunday showed the benefit of such
upgrading for fire dispatchers.
</P>
<P>
Fire Capt. MacLean said, "This is a fairly new thing for our dispatchers and I
think it shows what can be done. Any time a child is saved from a drowning, it
definitely is a good job."
</P>
<P>
The dispatcher, Wilkes, downplayed his role during an interview Sunday
afternoon. But he said he was pleased that his training could be put to good
use. Wilkes is a dispatcher for Net 4, a communications center in Anaheim that
handles calls for the fire departments in Anaheim, Orange, Garden Grove,
Fullerton and Buena Park. The Net 4 dispatchers completed upgrading to
"emergency medical dispatcher" status last month following several weeks of
training, Boyles said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calming the Mother
</P>
<P>
Wilkes said he used his training to try to get quick help to the baby on Sunday
afternoon, as the paramedics were en route. The first step, he said, was
calming the mother down.
</P>
<P>
"I told her the paramedics were on the way, and she became very calm," he said.
"I then asked her to bring the child inside the house. The baby was brought
inside, and she told me she put the child on a counter in the kitchen next to
the phone.
</P>
<P>
"I asked her if the child was breathing and she said 'no.' So I said we would
go into CPR. I told her to try to establish an airway for the child to breathe.
After she got the baby positioned, I heard the child make a gurgling sound. I
told the mother to turn the child's head to allow the water to get out.
</P>
<P>
"She did this, and then I heard the baby make a coughing sound. Then there was
the sound of her screaming and crying. I told the mother to let the baby cry --
that it was a way of getting oxygen into those lungs."
</P>
<P>
Wilkes said clearing the child's airway and getting the water out proved to be
all that was needed. He said the mother did not need to use CPR chest pressure
on the infant.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Floating in Pool
</P>
<P>
Wilkes said the baby girl apparently fell into the house's swimming pool
shortly before 1 p.m. and was found floating face down.
</P>
<P>
MacLean, who was among the firefighters and paramedics who went to the scene,
said that an older man, who he guessed to be the child's grandfather,
apparently jumped into the pool with his clothes on to pull the baby out of the
water.
</P>
<P>
The mother, who is about 25, and other family members declined to talk about
the incident.
</P>
<P>
Wilkes praised the mother's response to his telephone instructions. "She was
very responsive to my instructions, and she followed them exactly," he said.
"She told me, after it was all over: 'Thank you very much for your help.' "
</P>
<P>
Wilkes is a graduate of Rancho Santiago College's emergency medical technician
program. He is a reserve fire inspector for the Anaheim Fire Department, in
addition to his dispatcher work for Net 4. He also serves as a part-time
firefighter in Riverside County, where he lives in the city of Riverside with
his wife and children, ages 12, 9, and 2.
</P>
<P>
"Having three children of my own, I have a certain amount of empathy dealing
with a call like this," he said. "After you get off the line, you tend to think
of your own personal family."

happy ending to Murphy the schnauzer's weekend adventure. On Monday, he was
playing dead. Friday night, he wasn't playing.;   It all began when
10-year-old Chris Ullian heard 2-year-old Murphy gagging and breathing hard.;
 His mother, Marcia, a nurse, thought the dog was choking and reached in his
mouth. She tried the Heimlich maneuver. Neither worked.;   By then Murphy was
foaming at the mouth and shaking violently. The family drove to the Palm Beach
County Animal Medical Clinic.;   The dog stopped breathing en route.;   "I've
done CPR on humans but never on a dog," Marcia Ullian said. "That was a pretty
dead dog.";   She held one hand over the dog's nose and blew into his mouth.
Then she pumped up and down on his chest. His labored breathing resumed.;
Veterinarian Wendy Weil said that from the purplish-brown color of the dog's
mouth, she knew the dog had bitten or licked a poisonous Bufo marinus toad.;
After three hours and massive doses of drugs, Murphy responded.;   "When we
went to pick him up the next day, he was sitting up with his tail wagging,"
Marcia Ullian said. "But he was stoned, definitely stoned."  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  THE story is familiar: The 18-month-old girl had been napping on the couch.
The day care home operator left the room for a few minutes and came back to
find the couch empty, the patio door open and the little girl floating
unconscious in the pool.;    This incident in Orange County was one of four
drownings in the past two years in family day care homes in California,
according to the California Children's Lobby. Other children have been saved
but suffered brain damage. In some cases the day care providers had no
training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  MAKING DAY CARE SAFER
REQUIRING THE PROVIDERS TO BE TRAINED IN
FIRST AID IS JUST COMMON SENSE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     It's only common sense to get CPR training if you're going to take care of
children in your home and you have a swimming pool or spa. Even in
well-supervised homes, gates can be left open, fences can be scaled, children
can figure out locks in the time it takes to change a diaper or warm a
bottle.;    Even without a pool, the danger of accidents exists. Children can
drown in a wading pool, a toilet. They can choke on a grape, crack their heads
on the pavement.;    Yet aside from common sense, there is nothing requiring
licensed day care operators in California to seek training.;    A bill before
the state legislature would require licensed home day care operators to have
15 hours of training in CPR, first aid, and other safety techniques. Day care
centers would be required to have at least one trained staffer on duty. The
training is available at minimal cost from the American Red Cross, the
American Heart Association, community colleges and adult education programs.;
  AB 962, introduced by Dede Alpert, D-San Diego, is supported by day care
operators and children's advocates. It has passed the Assembly. Yet if it
passes the Senate, Gov. Pete Wilson has threatened to veto it. He says it
would be a hardship on the operators and would discourage them from applying
for licenses.;    Ironically, earlier this month Wilson signed a bill making
CPR training a certification requirement for school teachers. Surely if it is
important to protect school-aged children, it's just as important to protect
their little brothers and sisters.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Parents Settle Over Daughter's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parents of a 4-year-old who died after a
swimming lesson described as strenuous have settled a lawsuit
against instructors and a beach resort for nearly $1 million.
   ``We still can't believe it happened,'' said Patricia Myers, who
watched at poolside while instructors huddled over her daughter,
Amber Nicole Myers, after she lost consciousness during a 50-yard
swim.
   Amber was taking a swimming lesson in August 1987 from George
Symons and Michael Hatton at the Tides Hotel and Bath Club Resort
in North Redington Beach.
   According to the lawsuit, Hatton made her swim two laps in the
75-foot pool. During the second lap the child, who had tearfully
complained of fatigue, lost consciousness and stopped breathing
with an instructor only a couple feet from her.
   The mother of another child in the class and an instruction
performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation until paramedics arrived,
but Amber never breathed on her own again and was placed on life
support equipment. She was removed from the equipment eight days
later and died.
   Patricia and Stephen Myers filed suit against the instructors
and Gulf Beach, which owns the resort, alleging negligence. They
settled Monday for $950,000.
   The couple said they will wage a personal campaign for state and
national laws requiring instructors and lifeguards be certified in
lifesaving skills and CPR.
   Brian Harrington, attorney for the resort and the instructors,
said the instructors were certified in lifesaving and CPR, more
qualified than was required by either U.S. Swimming, a sanctioning
association, or Florida law.
   The last thing Mrs. Myers remembers is Amber asking: ``Mommy,
how much longer is class? I don't want to swim the long way.''
   ``I'll always have a problem with that,'' Mrs. Myers, 32, said
through tears.
   Family attorney Bob Carroll said the couple decided to settle
rather than take the matter to court this week because of the
stress a trial would bring. ``They would have been reliving this
thing 1,000 times.''
   Harrington said the hotel is looking at the swim program to see
if changes need to be made. Hotel management ``wanted to get all
this over and done with first,'' he said.
   Harrington denied there were serious flaws with the program.
``If it were so deficient, how did it function for 35 years,''
teaching 8,000 to 10,000 swimmers in three generations, without
another death, he asked.

<TEXT>     "I was lecturing at the time and heard two gagging groans," teacher Marion
Patterson said in a memo to President Tom Clements. "I looked up to see Mr.
Macres slump.";    Kieran Kelley, along with Wayne Cretin, revived Macres'
heart. "He kind of dropped something and it caught my attention," Kelley said.
"I looked over there, and suddenly he leaned back into his chair and grabbed
his chest. I knew right away that he was having a heart attack. . . .;    "He
hardly had any pulse at all. . . . I checked out his breathing; he wasn't
breathing. I checked for his heartbeat; . . . it wasn't beating.";    After
about 10 minutes of CPR, "he was gasping, and we knew that we got him back,"
Kelley said. Los Altos firefighters arrived shortly after and used a
defibrillator on the victim.;    Macres, 65, was taken to El Camino Hospital,
where he was listed Wednesday in critical condition, a hospital spokeswoman,
Jean Altman, said.;   FARM RECONSTRUCTION: Stanford University trustees this
week said OK to plans to repair three major structures that were hit hardest
by the Loma Prieta tremors. About $38 million will be used to fix the Memorial
Church, the Graduate School of Business and the Museum of Art. A small portion
of the money will be earmarked to reinforce Building 2-560 to meet state and
county earthquake standards.;    The projects will be paid for by gifts,
reimbursements from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and money from the
University Earthquake Facilities Reserve.;  STAND AND TALK: Jaime Escalante,
the famed calculus teacher from Garfield High School in Los Angeles, will give
a couple of motivational speeches at Foothill College later this month.;
Escalante, the subject of the film "Stand and Deliver," became headline news
when he successfully motivated his students to rise above the obstructions of
their inner-city surrounding and learn to thrive academically. His students
went on to do extremely well in calculus exams.;    The talks will be from
9:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. in the college's Main

A 3-year-old girl who was revived after wandering outside and being found
clinically dead in a snowdrift was well enough Thursday to sit up in her
hospital bed and fuss at her nurses.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Children's Hospital said that Brittany Eichelberger was alert,
suffering from frostbite of her hands and toes and congestion in her lungs.
</P>
<P>
"When we first took her to the hospital, I didn't think she had a chance
because she just looked so bad," said Brittany's mother, Melinda Eichelberger,
20. "Now, she's fighting with the nurses, telling them to get away."
</P>
<P>
The blond, blue-eyed child was found lifeless in the snow early Monday,
apparently several hours after she had wandered outside her Elkins, W. Va.,
trailer home, wearing only her underwear and a T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
Eichelberger speculated that the child was enchanted by the snow and ran
outside to build a snowman for her grandfather.
</P>
<P>
Brittany is breathing and eating on her own, Dr. Shekhar Venkataraman, her
physician, said. Frostbite could cause her to lose the tips of her fingers and
toes, and it will be "some time" before doctors determine if there has been any
brain damage, he said.
</P>
<P>
Doctors estimated that Brittany had been outside for two to three hours. Her
temperature had dropped to 74 degrees, causing her heart to stop -- apparently
minutes before her mother found her.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of oxygen, the severe cold helped preserve her brain function,
Venkataraman said.
</P>
<P>
Eichelberger and her fiance, Steve Robinson, found Brittany about 10 yards from
the home. A neighbor, Paul Owens, administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation
until paramedics arrived.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Davis Memorial Hospital in Elkins continued CPR for 3 1/2 hours
until Brittany's temperature rose. They also began warming the girl by wrapping
her in blankets, exposing her to warm lights and pumping a warm saline solution
into her stomach.
</P>
<P>
She was flown to Pittsburgh Monday evening. Her mother said Brittany was able
to speak to her Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Her voice was real hoarse, but I was excited. I was afraid she wasn't going to
be able to talk," Eichelberger said. "She says 'no,' 'mommy,' 'get' and 'stop.'
"

South Carolina coach Joe Morrison's vital signs were normal moments before he
collapsed in a shower after suffering a massive and fatal heart attack,
according to the doctor who examined the coach.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Peele, an orthopedic consultant for the Gamecock football team, was
called to examine Morrison by Gamecock trainer Terry Lewis after Morrison had
trouble cooling down after playing racquetball at Williams-Brice Stadium.
</P>
<P>
"I came over and looked at his heart and checked his blood pressure, and he
didn't have any complaints of chest pains," Peele said Monday night. "They all
were normal.
</P>
<P>
"I went out to a phone to talk it over with his cardiologist," he said. "Before
I got back, he collapsed."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CPR Administered
</P>
<P>
Peele said he and Lewis began performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on
Morrison, 51, who was rushed to Providence Hospital, where he was pronounced
dead at 9:03 p.m. on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Peele said he examined Morrison about an hour after the coach finished his
weekly racquetball games.
</P>
<P>
"He had no complaints of chest pains," Peele said during a telephone interview.
"His cardiologist didn't think it was probably significant since he had had
chest pains in 1985."
</P>
<P>
Morrison had a history of heart problems and had been hospitalized in the past
for that condition. He underwent surgery for the removal of a blockage in a
coronary artery in March, 1985.

DROWNING IS THE NO. 1 CAUSE OF CHILD DEATHS UNDER AGE 5
</P>

<P>
Jason Pocock's mother was on the telephone. It was only for a moment, but it
gave the 2-year-old Vista toddler time to slip out of the house, climb over
two, 3-foot high gates, lift the cover of the family hot tub and fall in.
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Pocock does not remember how long she was on the phone before she
noticed Jason wasn't where he was supposed to be that evening last December,
but she said she can never forgot how she found him.
</P>
<P>
"I saw the hot tub cover was half open. I didn't even want to admit he could be
in there," Pocock recalled. "When I found him, he was unconscious, he was blue,
he was choking because he aspirated water, and I couldn't find a pulse."
</P>
<P>
Pocock immediately began performing infant cardiopulmonary resuscitation on
Jason, a procedure she had learned at Tri-City Medical Center when her son was
born with respiratory problems. She simultaneously reached for the portable
phone she always kept pool-side and dialed 911.
</P>
<P>
Those two things -- Pocock's knowledge of CPR, and the quick access to a
telephone -- saved Jason's life. Within a couple of breaths, Pocock had her son
breathing on his own, and the paramedics arrived soon after, whisking Jason
away to be taken by Life Flight to Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Jason spent two days and two nights in Children's before doctors pronounced him
well enough to return home to his parents. He is one of the lucky ones.
</P>
<P>
Still, the danger hasn't really passed.
</P>
<P>
As soon as Jason came home from the hospital, he wanted to go back in the
water. Doctors told Pocock that many near drowning victims are repeat
offenders.
</P>
<P>
"I have always watched Jason, but now I watch him like a hawk," Pocock said. "I
have a vision of my son so close to death, and to me, I don't need anymore
warning. That image will always be with me."
</P>
<P>
Drowning is the leading cause of death for children under the age of 5. It also
is 100% preventable.
</P>
<P>
However, since the beginning of this year, 11 children under the age of 14 have
already died in pool and spa accidents around the county. Drowning deaths last
year totaled 37, according to the county coroner's office.
</P>
<P>
Drownings are also very age- and sex-specific, said Bob Olander, a member of
the National Drowning Prevention Network and general manager of Protect A Child
Pool Fence Co. More than 90% of child drowning victims are between 1 and 5
years old, and 70% of those are 2-to 3-year-old males.
</P>
<P>
Drownings can occur in less than two minutes and in less than a puddle.
Recently, in San Diego County, a child drowned in a bucket of cleaning
solution.
</P>
<P>
"It only takes 2 inches of water and a few moments for that tragedy to happen,"
said Linda Gilstrap, community education coordinator for the Water Safety
Coalition in San Diego. "If I hear one thing from these parents, I hear, 'I
only left for a minute,' 'I just went to answer the door.' "
</P>
<P>
"It can't be emphasized enough, never ever leave your child alone," Gilstrap
said. "That one second you leave them alone, you could be left with a lifetime
of tragedy."
</P>
<P>
Safety advocates often disagree on what drowning prevention measures work best,
but they do agree that not just one, but several layers of protection are
needed. The most important one is always close supervision.
</P>
<P>
"Fences, covers, alarms, locks on sliding glass doors, these are things that
can buy you precious moments in a recovery of a child who has gotten into a
pool," Gilstrap said. "But, even if you have them, don't be overconfident. You
still have to maintain the attitude that this is only going to help, but it
will not prevent an accident."
</P>
<P>
Olander said families who are considering installing a pool should wait until
their children are over 5 years old. Gilstrap said education and public
awareness are the only line of defense.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FENCING
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, all pool owners who live on less than an acre of land are
required to have a fence surrounding their property but not necessarily around
their pool. However, considering that most drowning victims are children who
die in their own pool or spa, a fence around the property offers no real
protection except for neighborhood children.
</P>
<P>
There are many types of fencing materials on the market, but some are
definitely not appropriate where child safety is concerned. Chain-link and wood
fences are not considered safe because they can be easily climbed, even by a
5-year-old.
</P>
<P>
Wrought iron is a popular choice for safety fencing, but it should meet some
specific requirements. Slats should be vertical and at least 5 feet high.
Because the head of an average 5-year-old is about 4 inches wide, slats should
be placed less than 3 3/4 inches apart to prevent a child from squeezing his
head through. Slats should also be free of any ornamentation that a child might
be able to climb.
</P>
<P>
A wrought iron fence, which can be installed in less than a day, averages about
$12 per foot, with gates starting at about $75.
</P>
<P>
Another type of fence that was designed strictly with toddler safety in mind is
the nylon mesh fence. The tightly woven nylon looks like a screen door -- it is
transparent -- but is a thousand times thicker.
</P>
<P>
Packaged in 12-foot sections that are wound like a bolt of cloth, the mesh
fence comes 3 1/2 or 4 feet high. The sections are stretched over aluminum
poles that are placed at 3-foot intervals around the pool and drilled 3 inches
into the ground. This prevents anything or anyone from slipping or crawling
underneath the mesh.
</P>
<P>
The fence has no gate to contend with because each 12-foot section is chained
together with safety latches. Two hands are required to unfasten these latches,
and then a panel of the fence is simply folded back to allow access to the
pool.
</P>
<P>
The fence is set back 18 inches from the pool edge.
</P>
<P>
The mesh fence has the added benefits of being weather-resistant, impervious to
rips and snags and easy to dismantle. It can be taken down in less than 10
minutes to accommodate pool parties where children aren't present. Its smooth,
tight weave doesn't provide a foothold for tiny feet, and it is soft enough not
to injure a small child who might fall against it.
</P>
<P>
The average cost of a nylon mesh fence, which can be installed in one day,
ranges from $1,000 to $2,000.
</P>
<P>
The safest fence is the fence that encloses the pool entirely. To minimize
traffic in a pool area, fencing should be as close as 24 inches off the edge of
the pool. A fence should also have a gate that opens outward so a child pushing
against it will close it. However, it is not wise to assume that a child will
push instead of pull. The safest gate is one that requires an adult to
physically lock and unlock it each time it is used. Any latching mechanism
should be on top of the gate out of a child's reach.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
POOL AND SPA COVERS
</P>
<P>
There are no state or federal laws regulating the safety specifications of pool
and spa covers. In fact, there are many types of solar and manual covers that
don't attach to the sides of a pool and can actually be death traps. Not only
is a child who slips underneath a cover unseen by a potential rescuer, the
cover prevents the child from being able to climb out of the water.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Consumer Product and Safety Commission established criteria for
a safety cover. A true safety cover must be able to support the weight of two
adults and one child, and be able to attach to the perimeter of the pool to
prevent anyone from slipping underneath. Safety covers must also be equipped
with an automatic pump that drains off any rainwater that may collect on top.
</P>
<P>
Most safety covers fit regular and irregular-shaped pools and operate manually
or automatically. A motorized cover operates on a two-track system and extends
the length and width of the pool when closed and recedes almost completely when
open. Because an automatic cover is activated by just the turn of a key or the
push of a button, people tend to use them more often. With a manual system, the
cover is both opened and closed by a hand crank or is snapped on and off.
</P>
<P>
Safety covers are made of many materials, but the strongest and most popular is
vinyl laminated over a polyester mesh.
</P>
<P>
A fully automatic safety cover ranges in price from $5,000 to $6,000 and can be
installed in a day. A manual cover ranges from $2,000 to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
For spas and hot tubs, safety advocates suggest a hard cover that physically
clips to the ground and is equipped with child-proof locks. The Admiral
Aluminum spa cover can support up to 300 pounds, locks with a special key, and
is a popular model sold by most spa dealers. A custom-made cover costs $400 to
$600.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ALARMS
</P>
<P>
There are three types of pool alarms on the market, but safety advocates
recommend their use only as a backup to other layers of protection. Pool alarms
float on top of the water and sound a loud signal when they detect movement on
the water's surface. This kind of alarm is extremely sensitive, however, and
one of its drawbacks is that it is frequently triggered by wind or leaves
falling into the pool.
</P>
<P>
A new alarm on the market is one that detects movement below the water's
surface. These do not sound every time the wind blows, but sometimes they don't
sound at all, even when a relatively heavy object, such as a child, falls into
the water.
</P>
<P>
A third kind of alarm is a water-sensitive bracelet that is worn by the child.
When the bracelet gets wet, an alarm goes off. Safety advocates say there have
been some manufacturing problems with these aquatic sensors, and they should
not be considered reliable protection.
</P>
<P>
Pool alarms range from $80 to $150 and can be installed in one day.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LOCKS
</P>
<P>
More than 80% of all drownings occur after the child was last seen in the house
and where the window of opportunity was less than 10 minutes, said Bob Olander
of Protect A Child Pool Fence Co.
</P>
<P>
"Typically what happens is a child will slip out of the house through a door
that the parent or guardian assumes is locked, get into the back yard and head
straight for the pool," he said.
</P>
<P>
All exits leading to the pool or spa -- sliding glass doors and windows
included -- should be secured with a deadbolt or child-proof locks. These locks
should be up high and out of reach of a child.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SWIMMING LESSONS
</P>
<P>
Parents are lulling themselves into a false sense of security if they think
swimming lessons are a measure of safety for their children under 3 years old,
said Linda Gilstrap of the Water Safety Coalition. When young children fall
into a pool or spa, they are stunned and have little if any ability to deal
with a crisis like that, she said. However, children over 3 years old do
benefit from swimming lessons and are more likely to retain the information,
Gilstrap said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TIME SAVERS
</P>
<P>
Even under the best conditions -- with all the barriers in place -- the worst
scenario can and sometimes does happen. But there are still some added measures
that can be taken to save a child once he or she has fallen into the water.
</P>
<P>
A phone installed near the pool area can save precious seconds in calling for
help. The time saved could mean the difference between life and death or severe
brain damage.
</P>
<P>
All members of the family should know cardiopulmonary resuscitation. One parent
knowing CPR is not enough, as Cheryl Pocock attests.
</P>
<P>
"My husband knows adult CPR and is very comfortable with it, but he wasn't home
when Jason fell in the hot tub," Pocock said. "If one adult knows CPR, it's
still not enough. Anybody who watches kids should have to know it."
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross and many local hospitals offer CPR classes for little or no fee.
Depending on the age of the children in the home, parents should learn infant
or child CPR because the technique vastly differs from adult CPR. Infant CPR is
for children ages 0-3 years, and child CPR specifically covers children ages
3-9 years. Most classes take eight hours and, once trained, parents should take
a refresher course every year.
</P>
<P>
Drowning-Prevention Tips for Families With Pools
</P>
<P>
Kid-proofing your pool means constructing several layers of protection
</P>
<P>
SAFETY COVERS
</P>
<P>
1. A child can slip unnoticed under a normal solar cover. A safety cover, on
the other hand, attaches in some way around the perimeter of the pool. The
cover should be strong enough to support the weight of at least two adults.
Since a child can drown in as little as two inches of water, some kind of
pumping device is needed to remove rain or sprinkler water that collects on the
cover's surface.
</P>
<P>
2. Enclose the pool completely -- most drownings occur when children wander out
of the back door of their own house. The fencing should be made if plain
wrought iron -- children can use embellishments for climbing. Fencing should be
at least five feet high; bars should be no less than four inches apart. Gap
where fence meets garden wall should not be wider than four inches. Include as
little as possible within the fencing. Access to bar-becue pit, pool supplies,
etc. increase adult traffic, thereby increasing the odds of the gate being
accidently left open.
</P>
<P>
3. Gates should open outward and should be self-closing and self-latching
beyond a child's reach.
</P>
<P>
AUXILIARY SAFETY
</P>
<P>
4. Secure all doors leading to the pool area with childproof locks and latches.
Inexpensive sound alters, available at hardware stores, give off an alarm when
a door is opened.
</P>
<P>
5. A telephone extension in the patio area can save precious seconds during an
emergency.
</P>
<P>
6. Learn CPR.

A HARD LESSON: WATER, CHILDREN DON'T MIX

Kevin Wood Jr. was down to one egg.
</P>
<P>
An Easter egg hunter of enormous talent, he searched and searched -- and then
pounced.
</P>
<P>
He had it. He smiled. His basket was full. He was as content as a 2-year-old
can be.
</P>
<P>
Two minutes later, he was nearly dead.
</P>
<P>
His uncles and aunts found him floating face down in the pool, his body an ugly
blue, bobbing just out of reach of the tennis ball he had chased into the
water.
</P>
<P>
"He was only out of sight for a few moments," said his father, Kevin Wood, a
Marine sergeant whose voice cracked as he spoke. "He was always laughing, full
of life, getting into things."
</P>
<P>
The mean season for children and water is under way.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen San Diego-area children who had nearly drowned or had drowned have
been taken to Children's Hospital this year -- 13 in March and April alone --
and local health officials have begun the annual summer campaign to promote
water safety and cardiopulmonary resuscitation lessons.
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, juvenile drownings decreased slightly in recent years, but
the death rate is up early this year, according to the county medical
examiner's office.
</P>
<P>
Six area children under age 14 have drowned so far in 1990, compared with 8
deaths in 1989, 12 in 1988, 18 in 1987, and 15 in 1986.
</P>
<P>
The number of children who nearly drown each year -- many of whom suffer
permanent brain or lung damage -- was not available, but it is estimated that
for every drowning, 10 children are hospitalized from water incidents.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is children should never be left alone -- for even a few
seconds -- around any water," said Mark Morelli, a spokesman for Children's
Hospital, which treats the more severe cases. Last year the hospital handled 52
children who had drowned or nearly drowned.
</P>
<P>
Area hospitals and other groups will conduct safety programs and classes this
summer at schools, parks, beaches and other areas.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, an average of 330 children drown and an additional 4,200 nearly
drown each year, according to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Consumer Products Safety Commission. Most are male and between the ages of 12
months and 35 months.
</P>
<P>
Family back-yard pools account for 65% of the drownings. More than
three-fourths of the victims were seen in the house by an adult less than five
minutes before the accident.
</P>
<P>
"I can give you all the statistics you want, but the point is that anybody with
a pool must be committed to vigilance (in supervising children)," said Jack
Eden, a spokesman for the federal safety commission. "It can happen to anyone.
Turn your back for a moment. Parents better believe it."
</P>
<P>
Drowning in residential pools remains the leading cause of death among children
under age 5 in California, one of only four states where water kills more
children than fire, according to the commission.
</P>
<P>
"These accidents have happened in pools, spas, bathtubs, buckets, but they are
preventable," Morelli said. "We have to convince parents that it can happen to
anyone."
</P>
<P>
Most drownings and near drownings occur when a child falls into a pool or spa
or is left alone in a bath tub, according to health authorities. Infants can
drown in an inch of water. An 11-month-old Vista baby drowned in April after
falling head-first into a bucket of water.
</P>
<P>
In April, Michelle Sallee of Chula Vista left her 13-month-old daughter
Brittany in a few inches of water in the bathtub for 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
"She was face down when I came back," Sallee said. "She wasn't breathing. Her
lips were blue. I threw her on the floor and started CPR."
</P>
<P>
Brittany suffered no permanent damage, but the experience convinced Sallee to
encourage other young mothers to be especially watchful around water.
</P>
<P>
"I thought nothing like that can happen to my baby, but it was just like that,"
Sallee said, snapping her fingers.
</P>
<P>
Water safety tips include:
</P>
<P>
* Never leave children alone around water, even those who have taken swimming
lessons.
</P>
<P>
* Never rely on flotation devices.
</P>
<P>
* Keep pool and spa areas locked.
</P>
<P>
* Teach children water safety habits, including no pushing, dunking or diving
into unknown bodies of water.
</P>
<P>
* Enroll children older than 3 in swimming lessons.
</P>
<P>
* Learn CPR.
</P>
<P>
* Teach children how to dial the 911 emergency phone number.
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said the Wood family's situation involved the two most
common factors in child drowning or near drownings: Adults were present and the
child was out of sight for only moments.
</P>
<P>
"His aunt had him by the hand and they started to go into the house," said
Wood, 31, of Escondido. "He follows her like a puppy and she assumed he
followed her into the house, but he slipped away for only a couple minutes.
That's all it took."
</P>
<P>
Young Kevin is in critical condition in the intensive care unit at Children's
Hospital. He apparently escaped brain damage, but he contracted pneumonia and
remains on a ventilator.
</P>
<P>
It is too soon to know if Kevin suffered permanent respiratory damage or when
he might breathe without the ventilator, said Dr. Bradley Peterson, director of
the hospital's intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
"It can take weeks, months, before we know," Peterson said. "The waiting is the
hardest part for the parents. They go through hell."
</P>
<P>
Wood and his wife, Myrna, visit their son nightly.
</P>
<P>
"The waiting is frustrating. We feel helpless," Wood said. "Like my wife says,
she has a real heavy heart."
</P>
<P>
Wood urged other parents to heed the warnings about children and water.
</P>
<P>
"You know the old saying: It only happens to the other guy. Well, it happened
to us. I want to tell parents it's a lot easier to put up a fence around the
pool than stand over your child in the ICU and watch him fight for his life."
</P>
<P>
Peterson said the degree of permanent neurological and respiratory damage
caused by nearly drowning depends on several factors, including the temperature
of the water, how long the heart and blood flow are stopped and whether any
vomit expelled with swallowed water enters the lungs.
</P>
<P>
Colder water slows the chemical reactions in human tissue, allowing a person to
survive for an extended period with little or no oxygen, and vomit exposes the
sensitive lung tissue to infections, Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
Most drownings occur before children reach age 4 and develop a minimum of
swimming ability and a greater sense of knowing when to avoid water, Peterson
added.

"The dangerous time is when they learn to walk and they go exploring," he said.
"They can get into paint buckets, mop buckets, drainage ditches, duck ponds.
Anything."

   A paramedic was strapped a stretcher
Tuesday so he could continue trying to revive an accident victim as
the men were hoisted from the roof of a building to a helicopter.
   Construction worker V. Nelson Cruz was crushed against a wall by
a 25,000-pound crane counterbalance on the roof of a 13-story
building, said Deputy Fire Chief R.A. Gossett.
   Because the victim had suffered cardiac arrest, Tony Tozzi of
the Coral Gables Fire Department was strapped to the stretcher in a
kneeling position so he could continue to perform cardiopulmonary
resuscitation.
   Cruz was unconscious but breathing when paramedics started
working on him but was pronounced dead in the emergency room at
Jackson Memorial Hospital, Gossett said.

   "When it was Dad's time to die," my friend said, "our
family doctor let us know that further measures would only
prolong the agony. We cut back the intravenous fluids and
medication to a symbolic trickle and he went peacefully in a
few hours." I am a physician, and I remember how touched I
was by the warmth and trust that helped this trio of human
beings (I include the father who was comatose) make one of
life's most difficult decisions.
   Contrast this with a low-cost advance directive designed
and promoted by Ezekial and Linda Emanuel of Harvard Medical
School. It provides a terminal-care checklist in response to
four horrifying scenarios. Suppose you were in a persistent
vegetative state. Or in a coma with a chance of recovery.
Suppose you were demented. What if you also had a terminal
illness? Just select the items you'd want -- from feeding
tubes to cardiac defibrillation -- from the menu. Then put it
in your patient file. How terribly strange.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Doctors are being told to tell patients of all the ways
they may die and be kept alive -- so the patients can choose.
This nation has developed the notion that it is not normal to
be allowed to die.
   Unless a specific "Do Not Resuscitate" order is given,
nursing homes in California are obliged to perform
cardiopulmonary resuscitation on 90-year-old cancer victims
who do not know who or where they are. "Is he a code?" is the
first thing I am likely to be asked when any older patient is
admitted to the hospital, referring to Code Blue, the
euphemism for CPR. Staffers worry about the need to
resuscitate even when older patients are being treated for
minor illnesses. They feel pressured not to do the wrong
thing in the event of death -- however remote the
possibility.
   I expect much more of this. The Supreme Court, after
debating whether to remove the feeding tube from comatose
Nancy Cruzan, decided to allow states to require "clear and
convincing evidence" of a patient's intentions regarding
terminal care, with preference for written statements. And
federal law in November will add the requirement that all
hospitals, nursing homes, HMOs and home health care-givers
participating either in Medicare or Medicaid must inform
every patient in writing of the right to refuse treatment and
also to document whether the patient has signed an advance
directive.
   Here in California, living wills and advance directives
already have become routine in some nursing homes. The latter
are three-page legalistic documents so complicated that I
have trouble understanding by whom and by what authority I am
being directed, let alone how I am to translate the directive
into appropriate action in any one of hundreds of different
clinical situations. That is, if, in an emergency, there is
enough time and manpower to consult and properly evaluate the
directive.
   Of one thing I am certain: Patients and families trying to
figure out in advance how best to handle all potential
life-threatening events often say what they do not mean and
vice versa.
   As a result, I never consider myself absolved of the moral
responsibility of helping to reach a humane decision when
continued medical efforts appear futile. This comes
perilously close to ignoring the paper work that may have
been executed somewhere along the line. I am a doctor, not a
lawyer. I don't know whether what I see is correctly
executed, whether the patient has changed his or her mind,
and whether the questions have been understood the same way I
do (such as the definition of "terminally ill").
   Despite this raging debate, I am struck by how
infrequently serious terminal-care conflicts have occurred
during my nearly 30 years in practice. It is a rare person
who wants to exist in a permanent vegetative state.
   When an elderly patient I attended for more than a decade
recently suffered a stroke followed by cardiac arrest -- both
entirely unexpected -- the nursing staff and I instituted
CPR. Within a few minutes, seeing that we failed to
re-establish spontaneous breathing and an effective
heartbeat, I asked the nurses, "Do you agree that we should
stop?" All seemed relieved to say "yes." Later, the patient's
husband of 60 years accepted my explanation that we had done
all we could. I spared him the agony of making him the one to
decide when and whether to stop.
   Some may consider this playing God. But I acted on the
basis of my knowledge of the people and the way in which they
looked to me for medical care. After 10 years with a patient,
giving up isn't easy. But it is the doctor's job to know when
to try and when to quit. I tell this to patients who ask me
about terminal care. Never have they rejected my offer to
treat them as I would like to be treated myself. I file the
living wills but state my belief that mutual trust is what
matters most.
   Nor have families of patients unable to speak for
themselves often caused the kind of problems that make for
good TV scripts -- the relative who can't wait to get his
hands on the money or the one who refuses to ever allow the
patient to die because of some ulterior motive or guilt. I
make sure that the staff, the family and I reach a meeting of
the minds that reaffirms our common humanity and loyalty to
the ill or injured patient. This may result in reducing the
intravenous fluids and medications to a symbolic trickle
rather than brutally "pulling the plug."
   I am strengthened by the thought that my patients have
chosen me as their personal physician. They particularly want
me to be around when they are receiving highly specialized
care from physicians who barely know them. It is here where
there is more reason for concern that allegiance to
technology, fear of lawsuits and simple inertia could turn
any one of us into a Nancy Cruzan.
   No living will or advance directive entirely takes the
place of dealing with a doctor you know and trust. Stories
are already making the medical rounds about the wife who,
based on her husband's advance directive, refused permission
to put him on a respirator. In her agitation, she didn't see
the difference between temporary and permanent respirator
therapy. Fortunately, the attending physician overruled her
protest, used the respirator and delivered a healthy husband
back to her.

<LEADPARA>  Diane Spencer grieved the grief of a broken young mother the day they buried
her child.;    But it was with chilling detail that she later described how
she killed Autumn Dawn -- as well as another daughter four years earlier, and
the baby who followed three years later.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  MOTHER'S 'LOVE' WAS LETHAL, POLICE SAY
SHE CONFESSES TO KILLING THREE BABIES; BIZARRE
MENTAL DISORDER IS SUSPECTED  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Investigators now believe that Spencer, who arrived in Pennsylvania eight
years ago as a pregnant, 15-year-old runaway, is a classic example of
Munchausen's Syndrome by Proxy, a bizarre mental condition in which parents,
seemingly obsessed with the well-being of their children, systematically
create symptoms and often inflict harm to gain attention and sympathy.;
Michigan police last month charged Spencer with murder in the September death
of her son Aaron. In Clearfield County, investigators exhumed the body of
another of Spencer's children, 6-week-old Joyce Anne Denochick, and
prosecutors are examining an autopsy done on Autumn Dawn Spencer, who died
mysteriously in 1987.;    Police are looking for evidence to support the
woman's confession to killing all three.;    As in many cases of Munchausen's
by Proxy, the deaths of Diane Spencer's children were attributed to such ills
as sudden infant death syndrome and a condition called apnea, in which the
infant simply stops breathing.;    Aaron Spencer, whom Diane confessed to
smothering to death in the early morning hours of Sept. 25, spent days in a
Michigan hospital being probed by doctors and hooked to monitors after the
young mother insisted her baby would unexpectedly cease to breathe.;    In
fact, investigators say they think Spencer would suffocate the child and then
use CPR to resuscitate it.;    "When this kid is not breathing, you don't make
the assumption that this doting, caring parent is the cause," said Dr. J.
Jeffrey Malatack, a physician at Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh and a
Munchausen's expert who has seen 16 cases of the disease in the Pittsburgh
area in the past three years.;    "Children have been smothered in an attempt
to feign apnea. Children have been bled. They've been given laxatives to give
the appearance of chronic diarrhea. They've been given sedatives to make them
pass out," Malatack said.;    The condition is named after Baron von
Munchausen, the 18th century German noble who spun fantastic and false tales
of his exploits as a soldier, adventurer and hunter.;    Diane arrived in
Clearfield in December 1982 with Jim Denochick, a truck driver she met after
running away from home in Zeeland, Mich.;    Joyce Anne Denochick was born
shortly afterward. Joan Denochick, Jim's stepmother, arrived home one night to
a panicky call from Diane.;    "She said, 'Joyce Anne isn't breathing,' " Joan
Denochick said.;    Paramedics rushed the infant, then blue, into the
emergency room. She died Sept. 6, 1983. Doctors attributed the death to SIDS
(sudden infant death syndrome) and, at Diane's request, did not do an
autopsy.;    By 1986 the relationship with Jim Denochick had deteriorated and
Diane began dating Donny Spencer, who lived with his parents in a mobile home
in the small settlement of Beccaria.;    When both found themselves in jail,
Diane on a bad check charge, they married behind bars and, upon release,
settled down with Donny's family.;    When Autumn Dawn Spencer was born Sept.
6, 1987 -- four years to the day after Joyce Anne had died -- Diane was
ecstatic.;    "She acted like a very caring mother, overprotective," said
Linda Spencer, Diane's mother-in-law. "She said she was afraid it was going to
happen with Autumn the way it happened with Joyce Anne.";    Fifteen days
after Autumn Dawn was born, Linda Spencer said, Diane walked to the baby's
crib in the living room of the crowded mobile home and started screaming, "Oh
my God, my God, my baby, my baby! She's not breathing!";    Autumn Dawn
Spencer was declared dead later that morning at Philipsburg Hospital in
neighboring Centre County. An autopsy found no clear cause.;    As the
Spencers reassembled their lives, Diane and Donny left for Michigan and the
couple split up. Diane began seeing other men.;    On March 3, 1990, Aaron
Spencer was born. She moved in with her mother in the small town of Wayland,
Michigan, and took the child on constant visits to doctors.;    At 6:36 the
morning of Sept. 25, Michigan state police were dispatched to the Spencer home
and found her giving the youngster CPR.;    The baby was dead on arrival at
the hospital.;    Within days, according to Miller, Diane confessed to killing
Aaron by holding a pillow over his face. Then she told police she killed Joyce
and Autumn by holding blankets tightly across their faces until they stopped
breathing.;    "She said she just wanted to kill them, she didn't know why.
But afterwards she would start breathing for them, doing CPR, to try to bring
them back around," Miller said. "She said she would try to get them as far as
she could and then she'd try to revive them."  </TEXT>

A 67-year-old man who apparently suffered a heart attack while windsurfing was
rescued Saturday by four men who saw him fall unconscious into Newport Bay,
Newport Beach Sgt. Pat O'Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
The victim, Jack Schwarze of Costa Mesa, was reported in critical condition
Sunday at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, a nursing supervisor said.
</P>
<P>
According to O'Sullivan, Schwarze was windsurfing when he fell unconscious into
the bay near 18th Street. Four men -- Peter Giacobbo, 50, of Villa Park; John
Jeffries, 25, of Santa Ana; Deryn Modoff, 24, of Irvine, and Terry O'Shea, 31,
of Newport Beach, pulled him ashore. Another person summoned two police
officers, who administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation until paramedics
arrived, O'Sullivan said.

<P>
O'Sullivan said the bystanders and the police officers who administered CPR
should be commended for their quick action.

FT  17 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: CPRE joins lobby to pay farmers
for environmental protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Agriculture Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPORT for changes in the EC's Common Agricultural Policy, which would pay
farmers to protect the environment, is coming from apparently opposed UK
lobby groups.
The Council for the Protection of Rural England, Britain's largest
independent conservation body, is canvassing a concept of environmental land
management launched originally by the Country Landowners' Association two
years ago. Under both the CLA and the CPRE schemes, farmers would be paid
directly for using farming methods and management techniques which enhance
the landscape and countryside environment.
CPRE support for the CLA ideas comes in documents published before
tomorrow's annual UK parliamentary debate on agriculture, although it is set
in the wider context of the reform of the CAP. CPRE goes further than CLA by
suggesting 'that the bulk of public money paid to the farmers should be tied
to the provision of specific environmental benefits, rather than, as at
present, the production of food . . . Such direct payments should eventually
come to replace price-support mechanisms.'
The CLA scheme is set in a private enterprise context with farmers and
landowners contracting with governments or local authorities to provide
specific environmental benefits, such as greater access to the countryside
or the management of areas of special beauty.
The two schemes are among many ideas currently being debated on the future
of European farming.
At the centre of the debate are the EC Commission's own proposals to shift
the burden of subsidies from large food producers to small farmers across
Europe. The proposals have so far been opposed by Britain in particular.
CPRE, 25 Buckingham Palace Road, London SW1 WOPP.
Total income from UK farming fell by 6.7 per cent to Pounds 2.1bn in 1990,
the Ministry of Agriculture said in an annual report on farm incomes. This
compares with a 21 per cent increase in 1989.
Falling incomes from cattle, sheep and dairy outweighed a recovery by
specialist cereal, general cropping and intensive livestock farmers.

FT  30 NOV 94 / Business and the Environment: Between a rock and a hard
place - One quarry's fight for planning permission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MARTINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the heart of Dorset in southern England an argument is taking place over
the happiness of sand lizards.
The lizards are indigenous to an area extensively quarried by ARC, the
Hanson subsidiary and one of the biggest aggregates-providers in Britain.
ARC, along with a local conservation group, claim the lizards are content to
live in areas of excavated sand created by large-scale extraction.
The Council for the Protection of Rural England, however, picked the ARC
sites at Hyde Heath and Portland as two of five quarries which illustrated
the danger to the environment caused by planning permissions dated before
environmental legislation passed in the 1980s.
ARC's reaction to its inclusion on the blacklist was both speedy and
furious. The company's good relations with the local wildlife trust - ARC
claims it has handed two-thirds of Hyde Heath, designated a site of special
scientific interest, over to the trust - and its general restoration of
quarried land were featured in the local media and trade press.
But ARC's response was based on larger national issues than the plight of
reptiles. CPRE's chief demand, set out in its response to a government
consultation paper on old planning permissions earlier this year, is that
such permissions should be updated to comply with modern standards. Where a
company fails to update the sites, planning permissions should be revoked.
The companies should pay for the updating or suffer the closure of the sites
without compensation.
The issue of compensation is set to prove the most contentious before the
paper is made law. The government is proposing that compensation be paid
where changes to comply with new planning regulations affect asset values by
restricting the scope for excavation. It says that there will be no
compensation in some cases, where changes are made to meet modern
regulations. It says this would apply to 'sensory' conditions, such as noise
levels at an excavation site, where the change does not affect earnings.
The CPRE, however, says the compensation proposals are too complicated. 'It
is particularly on the issue of compensation that we fear the proposals will
founder.'
Lilli Matson, CPRE's minerals campaigner, calls the proposals a 'recipe for
muddle'. 'There are going to be long legal wrangles over what constitutes a
sensory condition and what should be compensated.' The aggregates industry
enjoys better conditions over environmental regulation than many others, she
says.
The government proposals are contested by industry groups which claim they
make a nonsense of cost predictions at the start of construction. The
British Aggregate Construction Materials Industries, the trade federation,
says the cost of complying with the 1990 Environmental Protection Act alone
will be Pounds 100m and that this can hardly be seen as special treatment.
'How,' it asks, 'would householders feel if their
planning rights and thus their houses were taken away without compensation?'
At the heart at the issue lies the estimated demand for aggregates. The
government's own predictions suggest that demand for construction aggregates
will rise from 240m tonnes in 1991 to between 330m and 365m by 2006.
Environmentalists such as the CPRE and Friends of the Earth argue that the
government's road-building programme - which they oppose - makes up a large
amount of that total. They believe that more material could also be provided
by recycling.
ARC seems to have won the war locally - the Dorset CPRE campaigner has
applauded the company's conservation work and 'the lizards are happy'
according to the local paper - but its sites are still on an environmental
blacklist.
John Mortimer, ARC group operations executive, fears that moves by groups
such as CPRE have a 'dripping tap effect' on government policy and public
opinion, however. The government paper - likely to become law in the next
parliamentary session - will reveal how strong the drip is.

Joe Morrison, head football coach at South Carolina and a star for the New York
Giants during the 1960s, died Sunday night of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
Morrison, 52, had been playing racquetball at the university and was found
collapsed in the shower, Providence Hospital spokeswoman Dawn Catalano said.
</P>
<P>
"He was not feeling well, apparently went to the shower and was found in the
shower collapsed when they started CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) on him,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
She said Morrison was alive, but unconscious, when he was brought to the
hospital at 8:44 p.m. EST. He was pronounced dead at 9:03 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Ricky Diggs, South Carolina's running back coach, saw Morrison just hours
before his death.
</P>
<P>
"He seemed fine," Diggs said. "He was upbeat, spirited and so forth.
Racquetball is one of his biggest pastimes when he has the chance to get some
exercise. It just came as a big 7shock to everyone. It never even crossed my
mind that anything like this could happen."
</P>
<P>
Catalano said Morrison, who played for the Giants from 1959 to 1972 as a
running back and tight end, had a history of heart problems and previously was
hospitalized for that condition.
</P>
<P>
Morrison previously coached at Tennessee Chattanooga and New Mexico. His career
record was 101-72-7 over 16 seasons.
</P>
<P>
He was 39-28-2 in six seasons at South Carolina, including 8-4 in 1988, when he
took the Gamecocks to the the Liberty Bowl, where they lost to Indiana 34-10.
</P>
<P>
Morrison was the 1984 Walter Camp national coach of the year after South
Carolina went 10-2, losing to Oklahoma State, 21-14, in the Gator Bowl.
</P>
<P>
He was born on Aug. 21, 1937, and grew up in Lima, Ohio. At Cincinnati, he set
school records in scoring, passing and rushing and twice was named to the All
Missouri Valley Conference team.

<DATELINE>UPPER MARLBORO, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The verdict in the trial of a
Maryland nurse accused of killing hospital patients with a common
substance used for a variety of medical procedures will influence
how all nurses go about their jobs, a spokeswoman for a nurses
organization says.
   Jane Bolding, formerly a nurse at the Prince George's Hospital
Center about 20 miles east of the nation's capital, is accused of
killing three of her intensive care patients by injecting them with
lethal doses of potassium and attempting to murder two others the
same way.
   Potassium is found naturally in the body, but in large amounts
can cause cardiac arrest.
   A guilty verdict would likely have a ``chilling effect'' on
health care officials who routinely prescribe and administer common
medicines like sodium bicarbonate and insulin, which can be fatal
if used in large quantities, said Carol Grimaldi, a spokeswoman for
the American Nurses Association, based in Kansas City, Mo.
   Such a verdict ``would make it more difficult for people to
carry on in an already stressful environment,'' she said.
   ``We usually see cases where people are accused of murder by
turning off machines or poisoning, not the use of an organic
compound,'' she said. The 180,000-member association represents
registered nurses.
   Autopsies on the three victims all revealed inexplicably high
levels of potassium. But no official cause of death was ever listed
in any of the cases and no one witnessed Bolding doing anything
wrong.
   If Bolding is convicted of murder, the case could have
ramifications for the nation's health care industry, according to
defense attorney Burt Kahn.
   ``If this case went unchallenged, there would be paranoia
throughout the medical industry,'' Kahn said. ``This case is a
medical and legal nightmare.''
   What makes the case so important is that potassium, an
electrolyte found in the body, is also used for a variety of common
medical purposes in hospitals, Kahn said.
   Assistant State's Attorney Jay Creech has called Bolding ``a
killer angel.'' He is basing his case on a study by the federal
Centers for Disease Control that indicates more of Bolding's
patients died of cardiac arrest than did those of any other nurse
at the hospital.
   On the first day of trial in Prince George's County Circuit
Court last Wednesday, defense attorneys scoffed at the CDC report,
and said the prosecution's case is based on the flimsiest of
circumstantial evidence.
   On Thursday, Bolding's attorneys got the pathologist for the
intensive care unit of the hospital where the nurse worked to say
that potassium levels normally begin to rise as soon as a patient
dies.
   Dr. Ivan Matei said that once the heart stops _ and oxygen
ceases to flow in the bloodstream _ tissues and cells begin to
break down, releasing stored-up potassium.
   ``It's a normal process,'' Matei told the court.
   Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, in which a strenuous chest
massage is used in efforts to restart the heart, also causes tissue
breakdown, Matei testified. In addition, kidney failure contributes
to high potassium rates because the bloodstream, which caries
potassium, is not purified, Matei added.
   CPR was attempted on all three patients Bolding is accused of
killing, and at least one had kidney problems, hospital records
indicate.
   ``We say it's impossible to tell whether potassium caused the
heart attacks, or whether the heart attacks resulted in high levels
of potassium,'' Kahn said. ``This whole case is about doubt.''
   The investigation of Bolding runs from January 1984 to March
1985, but Kahn introduced into the court record documents
indicating high potassium levels for patients at the hospital
during a 10-year period that encompasses the Bolding probe.
   Creech has relied on hospital records in an attempt to establish
that Bolding was present when the patients died, but hospital
officials testified under cross examination that many others also
had access to the alleged victims.
   None of Bolding's former colleagues who have testified so far
have questioned the nurse's work ethic or job performance.
   Bolding was indicted after a grand jury heard testimony last
year on the CDC study. The non-jury trial is expected to last up to
eight weeks.

FT  28 JUL 93 / Business and the Environment: Threat to rural England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Development of rural land in England cannot continue at the current pace and
the government should conduct a far-reaching review of planning and farming
policies to try to protect the countryside, according to the Council for the
Protection of Rural England.
Tony Burton, senior planner at the CPRE, will launch the organisation's new
study on the changes in regional land use between 1945 and 1990* today with
a call for the government to revise its planning policies so that less rural
land is used for development.
The scale of development and land changes across England is 'unsustainable',
Burton argues. 'If we carry on using land at this rate we will have lost a
resource the general public value as their countryside and we should be
cherishing for the future.'
In England, as a whole, the urban area has grown by more than 700,000
hectares since 1945. In addition, almost 30 per cent of rough grazing has
been lost. The south-east has lost the most countryside to the urban jungle.
Since 1960 the number of people supported by each hectare of urban land has
declined by a fifth from 31 to 25 people.
The CPRE is critical of road proposals that encourage this sort of urban
sprawl. Burton said it was concerned about the government's decision to
widen the M25 orbital motorway around London. 'These sort of proposals
encourage de-centralisation and the M25 decision can only exacerbate that
trend.'
A comprehensive review of local, regional and national planning policies to
protect the countryside and make more efficient use of land in urban areas
should be conducted, the CPRE says. Green belts should be protected,
particularly where they are under threat from local authorities. The CPRE
wants farmland to be better protected for its environmental as well as its
agricultural value.

   ``I'm a strict nurse. I've had him for 37 years and I want to
keep him. I'm happy to lift the shopping bags.''
   Margaret Miko of Catonsville, Md., also 67, says that before her
heart attack she felt that Westinghouse Corp. would probably fold
without her. She was a secretary to an important executive.
   Mrs. Miko, a widow, goes to the cardiac rehabilitation center at
St. Agnes Hospital in Baltimore three times a week, dons a sweat
suit, does her warm-ups, and works out on the rowing, the treadmill
and the bicycle.
   ``I was never what you would call the athletic type, but now I
wouldn't miss it.''
   Mrs. Miko collapsed on the job during a stressful day at work and
remembers someone shouting for anyone with knowledge of CPR.
   ``They practically had the shovel out,'' she says. ``The CPR and
prayers pulled me through. The priest gave me the last rites.''
   Dr. Raymond Bahr, director of the coronary care unit at St. Agnes
Hospital, says he decided to nominate patients because of the
transformations he saw in some. He says 1,700 heart patients a year
come through this coronary care unit alone.
   ``The transformation of character is something like being born
again,'' Bahr says. ``They have something the rest of us don't
appreciate. They see life differently after a heart attack.''
   Bahr, as a heart specialist, regrets that so many people wait
until it's too late to make the changes that will make their heart
stronger.
   ``Too many people have to wait until a Mack truck is sitting on
their chest,'' he says.
   Bahr's nominess include both Mrs. Miko and Miller, who were
virtually given up for dead.
   Another of Bahr's nominees is Bernie Walter, 45, a baseball coach
and athletic director of Arundel High School outside of Annapolis,
Md.
   Walter points out that even though he was a health educator, he
ignored the early warning signals. He suffered several aches in both
elbows early in the day, but laid down for a few minutes and it went
away. Then he coached for two hours and felt better but not quite
good.
   ``I just felt really tired. At 8:30 that night I was watching a
hockey game. It was the Stanley Cup. The Philadelphia Flyers were
winning 2-0 when the guy started down the ice to score the third
goal. Then I had the severe pain and I told my wife,'' he admits.
   He was rushed to the hospital, given a clot-dissolving drug, and
the heart attack was arrested quickly.
   ``I'm not handicapped in any way,'' he says. ``The idea is not
just keeping you alive, the idea is getting you back to doing the
things you want to do.''
   Walter certainly is. He's totally altered his life.
   ``I'm also beating out infield hits now,'' he says.
``Occasionally even getting a double.''
   Bahr says Walter is an excellent example of what early care can
mean.
   Walter took both his weight and his blood pressure down and
eliminated salt, red meat and any canned products from his diet.
   ``Before that, cheese and gravy was right down my alley and it
was always red meat,'' he says. ``Now we shop very carefully.''
   ``As you can probably tell,'' he says, ``I'm a type A
personality. I'm learning to change that. If I feel too much
pressure, I'll just say the heck with it and go home and ride my
bike.''
   Both the patient and the hospital who nominated him or her will
receive $10,000, a grant from the makers of Ecotrin safety-coated
aspirin.
   It will be presented on _ when else _ Valentine's Day.

INFANT 'STABLE' AFTER FALLING INTO POOL

<TEXT>
<P>
An infant boy was in stable condition Monday after falling into a swimming pool
and receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation from his grandfather, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
Larry Martinez, 20 months, was riding a tricycle around in the back yard of his
grandparents' house on the 4800 block of Marion Street when he fell into the
swimming pool about 6 p.m. Sunday, Police Sgt. Ray Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
The grandmother told police the infant had been left unattended for only a few
minutes when she found him floating face down in the pool. The grandfather
pulled the unconscious boy from the pool.
</P>
<P>
The grandparents, whose names were not released, called the 911 emergency
number and were turned over to an Orange County Fire dispatcher who gave the
grandfather CPR instructions, said Peterson.
</P>
<P>
When police arrived, they "found that the child had resumed labored breathing,"
Peterson said. Paramedics took the boy to Los Alamitos Medical Center. The
child was later transported to Long Beach Memorial Hospital where he was listed
in stable but "favorable" condition, Peterson said.MATT LAIT

   Attorney Mark Murphy says he learned a
lesson when he used mouth-to-snout resuscitation to revive his
drowning springer spaniel: Five minutes ``is a long time to blow
down a dog's nose.''
   The cardio-puppy resuscitation occurred after Murphy's year-old
spaniel, McLean, fell into a culvert Tuesday behind Murphy's house
and was swept away.
   ``I ran down to the other end and waited for him,'' Murphy said.
But when Murphy retrieved McLean, the dog's heart had stopped.
Murphy began CPR.
   ``I didn't know how fast his (McLean's) heart was pumping, but I
used the regular five breaths to 15 counts,'' Murphy said. ``It
probably took about five minutes or so, which is a long time to
blow down a dog's nose.''
   The technique worked.
   Murphy's heroic rescue got less than a hero's reception in his
office.
   ``One of the other co-workers said they always said I had dog
breath,'' he said.

<DATELINE>CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When a team of eight horses got away from
Ray Croteau while he was plowing fields in Alberta, Canada, he
wasn't frightened. He was exhilarated.
   That was 53 years ago. Today, Croteau lets his horses get away
from him almost every night of the week.
   Croteau, along with several other Canadians and their families,
race chuckwagons behind teams of four thoroughbred race horses in
thunderous competition _ a favorite of spectators this week at
Cheyenne Frontier Days.
   ``You don't really appreciate it until they wreck,'' an onlooker
said. ``They take their lives into their own hands.''
   But to Croteau, 61, ``I don't think it's any more dangerous than
driving down the road.''
   The roar of the crowd matches the rumble of the wagons as the
four teams race astride. With only about two feet separating each
team from the next, the flinch of the driver's wrist can make the
difference to life and limb.
   The first chuckwagon races began during the cattle drives of the
19th century.
   ``After a long day, they'd have a race to the first town or
tavern _ they'd throw the stove in the wagon and go,'' Croteau said.
   True to the tradition, a `stove' (actually a small keg barrel)
is ceremoniously tossed into the back of the modern-day chuckwagons
as part of the race. If the stove falls out, a four-second penalty
is levied.

CLASS TRANSLATES HOME SAFETY TIPS FOR LATINO SITTERS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like many Southern Californians, Ismelda Durazo was jolted by the 1987 Whittier
earthquake. But that was nothing, she said, compared to the jolt she received
when she saw her Guatemalan baby-sitter's reaction to it.
</P>
<P>
"I was upstairs with my son when the quake hit, and my baby-sitter was
downstairs with my daughter. I yelled for her to get under a table, but she
still ran outside with my daughter," Durazo recalled.
</P>
<P>
"When I asked her later why she didn't listen to me, she told me it was what
she had been taught to do. She said: 'In my country, you run outside during
earthquakes, because if you don't, the house will fall on top of you.' "
</P>
<P>
From that experience, Durazo began to wonder if there might be other cultural
differences that could affect her baby-sitter's response to emergencies. The
conclusion she reached, she said, was not a comforting one.
</P>
<P>
"My baby-sitter is very bright," Durazo said, "but when she told me how people
in her country treat things like burns and fevers, that's when it hit me that
my children were at risk.
</P>
<P>
"Our beliefs here are so different than in the Latin American countries. Still,
no one was addressing it."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Filling the Gap
</P>
<P>
Convinced that there was an information gap that needed filling, Durazo left
her job as an insurance company clerk in 1987 and founded Safekids, U.S.A., a
one-day course designed for Latino housekeepers.
</P>
<P>
Conducted in Spanish, the six-hour class addresses topics such as infant
cardiopulmonary resuscitation, treatment of shock, accidental poisoning and
kidnaping awareness. At the completion of the class, each participant receives
American Red Cross certification in CPR from Durazo, who is a certified
instructor.
</P>
<P>
The American Red Cross itself holds a CPR class in Spanish in downtown Los
Angeles that costs $15. A Red Cross spokeswoman, however, said that the Red
Cross course does not address all the other safety issues covered in Durazo's
class.
</P>
<P>
Since Durazo first offered her course, several hundred housekeepers have taken
it at sites in Encino, West Hills, West Los Angeles and Manhattan Beach, she
said, adding that she plans to expand to Pasadena, Malibu and Newport Beach.
</P>
<P>
Although many of the misconceptions she confronts are held by people
everywhere, Durazo begins each class by addressing the ones she encounters most
often among women from Latin American countries. For housekeepers who are
working in the United States illegally, that often means dispelling a mistaken
belief regarding the consequences of dialing 911.
</P>
<P>
After one Salvadoran housekeeper attended a class held recently in West Hills,
she said in Spanish: "Before, I would have been afraid that if I called someone
in an emergency, immigration would come."
</P>
<P>
Only two of the 11 women in the class said they were legal residents.
</P>
<P>
Durazo, whose parents are from Mexico and who speaks fluent Spanish, said: "You
wouldn't believe how many women have said to me, 'Oh yes, I have heard of 911.
The lady told me to call 911 in an emergency.' But when I asked them what 911
is, they have absolutely no idea. The term 911 means nothing to them."
</P>
<P>
In most cases, Durazo said, housekeepers sign up for the $50 class at the
request of employers, who view the cost as an investment in precaution. "One
mother just wrote and said her housekeeper came back and wanted to know where
the flashlights and gas-shut-off valve were in case of an earthquake," she
said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
We All Have Pools'
</P>
<P>
Lesley Salisbury Thompson, a Los Angeles feature writer for British
publications, said she heard about the class from two neighbors who planned to
enroll their housekeepers.
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons I wanted her to take the class in Spanish was that I think
there is a reluctance for many Hispanic women to admit they don't always
understand you," Thompson said. "We all have pools that pose a safety problem,
and the housekeepers spend a lot of time with the children, and so there really
is the need for basic information."
</P>
<P>
Lorena Gonzales, a housekeeper from Mexico, said her employer had an even
stronger personal reason for asking her to take the class.
</P>
<P>
"She asked me what I would do if her infant were choking, and I told her I once
pulled food from the throat of a little boy. She said: 'That was good, but in
most cases it wouldn't help,' " Gonzales said. "Then she told me that when she
was a child, on Christmas, her 1 1/2-year-old brother choked on food and died."
</P>
<P>
"If my mother had known the Heimlich maneuver, he might still be alive today,"
said Christian Gilbert, a civil engineer in Glendale who hired Gonzales to care
for her 3-month-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
For Sharon Piehl, a banking administrator who lives in Pacific Palisades,
enrolling her housekeeper in the class represented an attempt to deal with the
after-effects of tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Piehl was at home last March when a fire broke out in her neighbor's house
across the street and claimed the lives of three children who had been left in
the care of a Spanish-speaking baby-sitter.
</P>
<P>
The baby-sitter, who inadvertently caused a fire by draping a cloth over a lamp
to help one child sleep, ran outside screaming for help. By the time she and
some neighbors tried to enter the house to get the children, the home was
engulfed in flames.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was so traumatized by this, including all of the housekeepers, we had
to do something," said Piehl, who organized a group of 11 housekeepers in the
neighborhood to take the Safekids course. "When I talked to my baby-sitter the
next day, I told her that if anything like that ever happened, everything was
replaceable except the children. This other baby-sitter thought she had time to
go back for the children.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handling Crises
</P>
<P>
"I was told that in Mexico, many of the buildings are made of brick, and so if
there is a fire, it doesn't burn the same way," Piehl said. "They wouldn't
think a house could burn down so fast."
</P>
<P>
Today, Piehl said, she takes no chances when it comes to the children's safety.
</P>
<P>
"I have emergency numbers hanging right next to the phone, along with my
address," she said. "My baby-sitter may know where I live now, but not know"
the address "if there were a crisis."
</P>
<P>
Durazo, who teaches the course to about 40 women each month, said she believes
that kind of awareness could well be used by many other parents. Although she
said it is not uncommon for housekeepers to be unable to give the last name or
address of their employers -- at a recent class, for example, nine out of 11
women did not know their employers' last name -- that lack of information also
works both ways.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I'm really shocked by the things the mothers tell me," Durazo said.
"I ask them about their housekeepers, and they don't even know their last names
or where they live. God forbid they should hire a nut and she should take off
with their children."
</P>
<P>
Durazo said she recommends that employers ask for at least three references
from potential housekeepers and that, once hired, the employers make a
photocopy of a current form of picture identification.
</P>
<P>
In classes, Durazo also makes an effort to determine which housekeepers have
been informed about what to do in an emergency, and which ones have been told
nothing.
</P>
<P>
"I ask how many of them have been given a first-aid kit, and maybe two people
will raise their hands," she said. "Even then, no one has explained to them
what it is for.
</P>
<P>
"What that means to me," she said, "is that even if they have it, they don't
know how to use it."
</P>
<P>
The next Safekids classes will be held Feb. 10 in Encino and Feb. 16 in West
Hills. For more information, call (818) 884-7311.

<LEADPARA>  A life-saving program has been launched by the Los Altos Fire Department that
is, literally, sure to produce a shock.;    Called a defibrillation program,
it involves the use of a device that provides an electric shock to a person's
heart to correct an irregular beat.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Peninsula Extra  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  LOS ALTOS PROGRAM IS SHOCKING NEWS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Community News  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The device takes the services of a hospital emergency room directly to the
victim and is expected to save many more lives, said Battalion Chief Dan
Dunlap.;    "It's your first aggressive approach to bringing the heart into a
normal beating pattern through the use of electrical shock. We can't do that
with CPR because CPR maintains blood flow and oxygenation throughout the body,
but it is not always successful to bring the heart back to a normal pattern,"
Dunlap said. "Defibrillators were once only common to the hospital emergency
room. Now they are in the field where aggressive, early, medical care can make
the difference.";    These new machines are able to detect the most common
conditions of heart failure that may lead to death. Through voice and audible
prompts, the defibrillator directs fire personnel when to administer an
electric shock to a patient. All fire personnel have been trained to provide
this service.;    "We take the heart muscle, which is fluttering, and through
electrical shock get it back to normal rhythm," he said.;    Of the
approximately 1,200 medical calls the department responds to every year, about
4 percent are cardiac arrest cases, he said.;    The department recently
purchased five of the machines at a cost of $33,000, which was appropriated by
the Los Altos City Council.;    The Los Altos Fire Department has about 40
full-time personnel and serves about 42,000 persons in a 21-square-mile area,
which includes the city of Los Altos, town of Los Altos Hills and adjacent
unincorporated areas of Santa Clara County.;    Services are provided through
three fire stations, four engine companies and a rescue squad.;    Among other
jurisdictions using defibrillators are the Santa Clara County Central Fire
Protection District and fire departments in Santa Clara, Saratoga and Morgan
Hill, Dunlap said.  </TEXT>

   Unreasonable fear of AIDS could cause a
substantial disruption of the workplace unless employees are
educated about how to deal with co-workers who have the fatal
disease, according to the results of a survey released Tuesday by
the American Red Cross.
   The survey, conducted by David M. Herold of the Georgia
Institute of Technology, showed that of 2,000 employees questioned
across the country, 42 percent said they would not work with anyone
who has AIDS. Twenty-nine percent said they felt so strongly about
it that they would quit their jobs before working with an AIDS
patient.
   Herold said at a news conference at the American Red Cross
national headquarters that there already have been incidents in
which work came to a standstill as a result of unreasonable fear
toward the immune deficiency disease.
   He said a state government office in Florida was shut down
completely when a worker with AIDS became ill and vomited in his
office. Maintenance workers refused to clean up the mess and
co-workers refused to continue to work in the area. The office was
forced to close for the day, he said.
   A power company was forced to cancel a cardiopulminary
resuscitation training program when workers said that they would
not use the skill if they learned it because of their fear of AIDS,
he said. CPR requires mouth-to-mouth breathing.
   ``They (the workers) said that if anybody touched a live wire
and got electrocuted, they would just have to die because nobody
would do CPR,'' said Herold.
   He declined to identify the state government office or the
utility company.
   Herold said that companies need to make policies now dealing
with AIDS-infected employees because it often is too late to make
policies after the problem develops.
   ``The passions run high when AIDS if found in the workplace,''
said Herold.
   The American Red Cross announced that it has developed a program
to help head off such problems through an AIDS education course
offered to businesses for their employees.
   Called ``Working Beyond Fear,'' the course includes a video
presentation and an instructor who can answer questions and promote
discussion in meetings of employees, said Carole Kauffman, manager
of the AIDS program at the Red Cross national headquarters.
   Ms. Kauffman said that more than a quarter million people are
expected to be infected by the AIDS virus in the 1990s, suggesting
that AIDS in the workplace will become a growing issue.
   ``It is conceivable that every business in America will be
affected by AIDS,'' said Ms. Kauffman.
   She said the training course will be offered by the 3,000 Red
Cross chapters in the country at a cost of $100 to $170. She said
the course would be taught in the workplace and can be arranged by
employers who call the local chapters.
   The Public Relations Society of America is assisting the Red
Cross in promoting the program, and representatives of both the
AFL-CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce attended the news
conference Tuesday to announce their endorsement of the course.
   Vincent R. Sombrotto, who is president of the National
Association of Letter Carriers and an AFL-CIO official, said the
unions support the AIDS training program because ``ignorance of the
disease can be a greater problem than the disease itself.''
   AIDS is a contagious disease that destroys the immune system,
rendering the body incapable of resisting other diseases and
infections. It is caused by a virus that most often is spread
through close contact with blood, blood products or semen from
infected persons. The disease currently is incurable and fatal.
   Its chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug
users, although a small percentage of cases are attributed to
transfusions of contaminated blood, heterosexual contact and spread
from infected pregnant women to their offspring.
   As of April 4, AIDS had been diagnosed in 58,270 Americans, of
whom more than half, or 32,545, have died since 1981, according to
the Centers for Disease Control.
