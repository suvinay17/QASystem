   Arthur and Marion Vassmer ordered a shipment
of Woodstock key chains and cigarette lighters for their general
store in plenty of time for any crowds this year.
   It's what they didn't order 20 years ago this summer that still
causes a few pangs of regret.
   The shelves of their country store were nearly stripped bare
that August 15-17 when about a half million youngsters camped out
nearly two miles away at the Woodstock music festival.
   For one long weekend Vassmer's, open since 1911 on the shores of
White Lake to serve residents of this 6,000-population town,
operated like an exclusive nightclub. Bouncers stood at the front
door and let customers in a few dozen at a time to shop.
   ``If I'd known, I would have had 50 cases of peanut butter up
front and said, `there you go, take all you want,''' said Arthur
Vassmer.
   The Vassmers never made it up to Yasgur's farm during the
Woodstock festival in 1969 when flower children frolicked in the
mud and listened to The Who, Jimi Hendrix, Santana and others. They
were too busy.
   But they could hear the music wafting through the air at all
hours of the day and night. ``I didn't believe it would come off,''
Marion Vassmer said, ``and I still don't believe it was here.''
   The Vassmers remember kids abandoning their cars in town late
Thursday night, sitting on hoods and playing guitars and camping
out in the streets and nearby fields at night.
   Vassmer's, the closest store to the festival site, hadn't even
ordered any extra provisions. All of their canned goods were prized
items, along with the peanut butter. Despite the crowds, Arthur
said he doesn't remember any shoplifters and none of the 25 checks
he cashed bounced.
   ``They didn't bother anybody,'' Marion said. ``They were no
problem. I'm sure a lot of them were on drugs, but they helped each
other out. If one kid didn't have enough money, someone else would
give him some.''
   Arthur Vassmer said he dropped about 12 pounds over three days,
mostly because he couldn't bear to turn on his light and cook
something in his apartment above the store with so many hungry kids
on the street below.
   The couple love reminiscing about the festival with visitors,
but they know enough not to bring up the name ``Woodstock'' to
longtime Bethel residents.
   ``It's not a good topic for conversation because people who were
against it, they still feel the same way they did then,'' said
Marion Vassmer.
   Bethel and the surrounding Catskill Mountain region has let it
be known they're not particularly sentimental for the 20th
anniversary. Bethel refused offers from promoters to be host to an
anniversary concert, even when businessmen dangled enticements such
as paying for a new town sewer system.
   Town officials are expecting several thousand people to show up
at the former Yasgur farm for the anniversary.
   The concert was originally planned for the town of Woodstock,
about 50 miles away, but moved when promoters couldn't get
permission to hold it. At Woodstock today, cynical store owners
sell T-shirts with a map of the area making clear the festival took
place in Bethel, not in the famous arts colony.
   The Vassmers are part of a contingent of Bethel residents who
wish the town could cash in on its place in history by more
actively seeking tourists, but anti-festival opinion has held sway.
   Arthur Vassmer said some people still wander into the general
store and recognize him from the movie ``Woodstock,'' in which he
was interviewed. Some even ask for autographs, which still leaves
him tickled. His store, with the worn wooden floorboards, hasn't
changed much since 1969.
   Times have, though, and that's why he can't see a repeat
performance of Woodstock.
   ``Today you couldn't do it,'' he said. ``It's a different
attitude. These people were the peace people. They came up here for
love and peace and music and that's what they got.''

   Nearly two decades after the Woodstock rock
festival became a symbol of peace and love for the Baby Boom
generation, the music has been replaced by bickering over whether
there should be an anniversary concert.
   Promoters are squabbling. Neighbor is pitted against neighbor
and bucolic Bethel is still trying to come to grips with its place
in history.
   ``This town doesn't want to forget it,'' said Allan Scott,
Bethel's supervisor. ``The town just doesn't want to get into the
same thing it got into 20 years ago.''
   Max Yasgur's old farm, where 300,000 people converged for three
days in August 1969 to hear musicians like the Who, Jimi Hendrix
and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, isn't a tourist trap, largely
because many people still think it's in Woodstock, 45 miles away.
   The only clue along Route 17B is a small wooden sign advertising
the ``Woodstock Camp Ground'' that points down narrow Hurd Road.
About a mile down the road is a large, sloping field, empty except
for a concrete and steel plaque that identifies its historic past.
   ``Every year more and more people have been assembling at the
site. It's virtually become a shrine,'' said Stephen Davis, lawyer
for the current owners of Yasgur's Farm, Brooklyn auto glass shop
owner Louis Nicky and his wife, June Gelish.
   The Nickys offered the town $200,000 for the right to be host
for another concert in the summer of 1989. Bethel would have to
waive its ordinance forbidding gatherings of more than 10,000
people, passed in 1970.
   No thanks, said the town board.
   ``I walked through it. Besides the drugs, there were sex orgies
all over the place,'' said George Neuhaus, town supervisor during
the original festival. ``I'm 100 percent against (another concert)
and I will do everything I can to prevent it.''
   Other townspeople aren't so harsh.
   ``Of course there was a lot of noisy music and nude people, but
there were a lot of good things too,'' said Marion Vassmer, who
runs a general store that sold supplies to famished concertgoers 19
years ago.
   The small community two hours from New York City, surrounded by
farms and out-of-the-way vacation homes, simply can't handle large
crowds, Scott said.
   The supervisor said he's heard from ``five or six'' promoters
about an anniversary concert. One even offered to pay for a new
sewage and water system for Bethel, but Scott said that after he
asked the promoter to post a letter of credit he never heard from
him again.
   Gelish said the people blocking a concert are simply
old-fashioned.
   ``My husband worked hard all his life, he never had a chance to
be famous,'' Gelish said of 61-year-old Louis Nicky. ``This is his
chance to be famous.''
   Yasgur, who allowed promoters to hold the concert on his farm,
died of a heart attack in 1973 at age 54.
   Joel Rosenman, one of the four promoters of the original
concert, says the Nickys, who bought the property seven years ago,
just want to cash in on a piece of history they had nothing to do
with.
   Rosenman, not coincidentally, wants to promote his own series of
commemorative concerts, but somewhere other than the Catskills.
   Gelish, who vows to continue fighting for a concert, said she
has no other plans for the land. Asked if she could envision a
tourist attraction with the magnitude of Graceland, Elvis Presley's
home, her eyes lit up.
   ``This is really hallowed ground,'' she said.
   Back at the site one afternoon, a man in a tie-dyed T-shirt and
dirty jeans sat cross-legged in the field. A grey-haired man took
video pictures of trees and tall grass swaying in the wind. Mark
Duncan drove up, his North Carolina license plates reading
``WOODSTCK.''
   Duncan, who works at a bank in Charlotte, didn't attend the
original show but drives up each summer because ``it's a nice
feeling around here.''
   Speaking above the blare of 1960s hits from his radio, Duncan
said he's ambivalent about a Woodstock anniversary concert.
   ``If it happens it would be fine,'' he said, ``but I don't think
it would ever be the same.''

   Woodstock, the rock festival that came to
symbolize the 1960s for a generation of Americans, is again at the
center of a controversy, this time over how big its 20th
anniversary celebration should be.
   On one side is the Bethel Town Board, which meets tonight to
discuss whether to allow voters decide what to do about next
August's anniversary. If a referendum is agreed upon, it would be
placed on November's ballot, Town Supervisor Alan Scott said
Tuesday.
   On the other side are concert promoters who want to re-create
the original Woodstock, which wasn't actually held in that Ulster
County town but miles away on Max Yasgur's farm in Bethel, Sullivan
County.
   Scott said his town is against any rock extravaganza on the
scale of the first Woodstock, which drew nearly a half million
people and endured heavy rains, lack of food and sanitation
facilities, drug overdoses and massive traffic jams.
   Scott said the town wants to recognize the anniversary, but in a
low-key manner. The problems created during the 1969 festival are
still fresh in the minds of residents, he said.
   ``It really raised havoc in this area,'' Scott said. ``It was a
thorn in the side of many, many residents at the time.''
   He said that as a result of the three-day concert held Aug.
15-17, 1969, the town passed a mass assembly law that prohibits
gatherings of more than 10,000 people.
   In August 1986, town officials did erect a roadside marker at
the site of the concert.
   Scott said at least five promoters have approached the town
board this year about staging another Woodstock festival.
   Some have talked about bringing back such Woodstock performers
as Country Joe Fish and Richie Havens, Scott said.
   Other performers, such as Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, and Santana,
still draw large concert crowds today.
   ``The general feeling is that we certainly don't want any
massive gathering anywhere near the proportion of what we had,''
Scott said.
   Scott said the board already has rejected a promoter's offer of
$200,000 to allow the concert to be staged.
   ``We recognize the importance of the event, we realize the
historical significance, but we are looking for something tasteful,
not more than a one-day event and not more than 10,000 people,'' he
said.
   In August 1984, the 15th anniversary of Woodstock was celebrated
at the posh Grossinger's Resort and Country Club in Grossinger,
N.Y., about 5 miles from Yasgur's farm.
   About 700 people showed up, including Abbie Hoffman and
Woodstock performers John Sebastian and David Clayton Thomas.

FT  30 MAY 94 / Arts: Peace and percentages - Rival bids to hold 25th
anniversary celebrations of the Woodstock Aquarian Exposition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was an event which defined an entire generation. For three days in New
York State, half a million students, anti-war protesters and all-purpose
hippies congregated in a field for three days of music, mind-altering
substances and muddy mayhem.
The 1969 Woodstock Aquarian Exposition, born of the chaotic, shoe-string
idealism of a small group of friends, became synonymous with the slogan of
late 1960s libertarianism: peace and love. But today, as two rival companies
vie to stage the definitive 25th anniversary celebration of the Woodstock
festival, these two qualities are little in evidence.
Where there was once just a group of friends behind the festival, there are
now corporate backers and slick professional promoters. Where there was a
Dollars 500,000 budget and an entry charge of Dollars 18 (that hardly anyone
paid), there is now a joint budget of Dollars 26.5m and a likely entrance
charge of Dollars 120.
Where there was a modest record and film contract, there are now substantial
record, film, television, and merchandising contracts. Instead of a few
patrolling Hell's Angels, the occasional food vendor and endless traffic
jams, there will be an eight-foot high fence and an army of security guards,
concessions stands, cash machines, portaloos and park-and-ride.
In one camp, Woodstock '94 is being put together by the three men who
organised the original event, Michael Lang, John Roberts and Joel Rosenman.
Although the trio went their different ways after 1969, Lang remained in the
music business, promoting acts like Joe Cocker and Rickie Lee Jones, while
Roberts and Rosenman evolved, like numerous former hippies, into Wall Street
investment bankers.
Through their Woodstock Ventures partnership, the trio are organising a
two-day rock festival on August 13 and 14 in Saugerties, about seven miles
from Woodstock town, and expecting an audience of 250,000. The partnership
is backed by the financial muscle of PolyGram Records (which is supplying
the Dollars 19.5m budget), top rock promoter John Scher, concert promotion
firm Metropolitan Entertainment, and a slick public relations campaign.
The suggested line up of musicians - Aerosmith, Metallica, Soundgarden and
Guns N' Roses - reflected a festival appealing not to the 40-plus
participants at the original Woodstock festival but to the current 17-25
year old generation of pop music fans. While John Scher says the choice of
bands is timely, 'because today's music and culture, energy and excitement
recall the mood of 1969', some veterans of the first Woodstock are not
entirely convinced that inviting the nihilistic - and sometimes downright
nasty - bands of the Nineties to a rock festival is the best way to
celebrate the spirit of the Sixties.
Sid Bernstein's anniversary celebration, however, is an unashamedly
nostalgic attempt to recreate the mood of the first Woodstock for an older,
more affluent generation. His event will occupy the original site of the
festival, Max Yasgur's farm in Bethel (actually 50 miles from Woodstock town
proper). The veteran US music promoter who brought the Beatles to America,
Bernstein ironically has no connection with the Woodstock of 1969.
Although he was in the music business at the time, he was some way removed
from the hippie culture, booking acts like Tony Bennett and Sarah Vaughan at
Carnegie Hall. A likeable, avuncular figure who schmoozes like a Broadway
talent agent in a Woody Allen movie, Bernstein runs the Bethel '94
organisation from his Upper East Side apartment. Eight years ago he had a
Damascene conversion when, as he tells it, he visited the site with his
family and was so moved by the powerful memories of Woodstock shadowing Max
Yasgur's farm that he became determined to put together a show to mark the
event's quarter century anniversary. He describes it as a 'mystical, magical
place - almost like the Holy Grail'.
Bernstein's plan for Bethel '94 (the Woodstock name is owned by the Lang
triumvirate) is to present many of the acts who performed at Woodstock. He
has already booked several surviving Woodstock artists including Richie
Havens, John Sebastian and Melanie (other key players like Jimi Hendrix,
Janis Joplin and Keith Moon subsequently died of drug overdoses). Bernstein
also plans to book non-Woodstock acts like Fleetwood Mac, James Brown and
Ray Charles: all reflecting Sixties nostalgia and appealing to the older
generation of the CD buying public.
Bernstein has yet to receive final permission from the town of Bethel to
hold his concert, and there is some doubt as to whether he has the money to
stage a festival for 80,000 people. The Dollars 7m budget, he says, is being
provided by a 'group of doctors and professional men in the Philadelphia
area' and an anonymous group of Wall Street investors.
Bernstein hopes those attending his event will bring clothes and
non-perishable foods that will be given away to charity. When the concert
ends, he plans to give everyone a seed to plant in their gardens or
neighbourhoods as a symbol of hope and new life. 'This is the tone we're
setting for our concert. The Woodstock generation was about peace and love,
but we haven't had much peace and love in this last generation.'
So far, the sympathies of Woodstock veterans seem, if anything, to be with
Bernstein's less ambitious Bethel '94. 'For people who were at Woodstock,
part of the charm of going again is to see how a lot of the old bands have
fared,' says Mark Newman, a musician with the New York rock band Tao Jones,
who has fond memories of losing all his clothes at the first Woodstock. 'If
they're going to have a lot of new bands and cater to a new audience, it's
not really a 25th anniversary.'
Scott Wein, a hippy-turned-mortgage broker who attended the original
festival, has similar doubts. 'I think if they're going to do it, and call
it Woodstock, I would have liked to have seen more of an attempt at a
recreation of Woodstock. How can you call it Woodstock and have Guns N'
Roses?'
The organisers of Woodstock '94 appear sensitive to these criticisms. Having
originally said that the festival would feature Guns N' Roses - a heavy rock
band whose ethos is about as far removed from 'peace and love' of the
Sixties as is possible - it now seems unlikely that the band will appear.
Perhaps Scott Wein best sums up the frustrations many Woodstock veterans
feel about this summer's celebrations. 'I don't resent people trying to make
money - this is America. But if you're going to exploit Woodstock, I feel it
will only be fair if you try to remember Woodstock for what it was. I don't
want my kid going, then coming back and saying: 'Shit, that was Woodstock?
What was the big deal?''

   A Woodstock reunion concert drew just a
handful of people, and promoters offered cut-rate tickets to
thousands who came to the site of the original concert on the
event's 20th anniversary.
   State police estimated 10,000 people Thursday night were at the
farm, once owned by Max Yasgur, where more than 400,000 young people
gathered Aug. 15-17, 1969, for Woodstock.
   At the Imperial Hotel in Swan Lake, about 10 miles away, the
audience of 250 attending the opening of a three-day ``Remember
Woodstock'' concert was almost outnumbered by security guards,
vendors and reporters. Promoters had hoped for a crowd of 4,000.
   Thursday afternoon, ``Remember Woodstock'' promoters sent buses
over to the Bethel site, hoping to entice customers with cheap
tickets and a free ride to the hotel and back. There were few takers
for the $5 tickets, which originally had been priced at $30,
promoters said.
   Some people who attended the Imperial concert left the hotel to
go to the original site, where free music was offered on a makeshift
stage.
   Richard Pell, the unofficial master of ceremonies in Bethel, said
Imperial Vice President Bruce Taylor was booed from the stage when
he tried to entice people to go to the hotel.
   ``They had six buses up here,'' Pell said. ``They asked $5 a
ticket and they bus you up there. Four people left. The music is
here.''
   Concert promoter Elliott Schneider blamed the small turnout in
part to rumors that major rock groups were going to appear at the
Bethel site.
   Schneider said the concert could break even if about 6,000 people
attend the three-day event. He said he expects attendance to
increase considerably Friday and Saturday.
   ``All my business sense told me not to try it,'' said Imperial
owner Michael Chung. ``But I tell you now, we're going to make this
thing an annual event.''
   The Imperial concert started about 5 p.m. when Woodstock's
original master of ceremonies, Wavy Gravy, shirtless and wearing
tie-dyed shorts and a propeller beanie, came on stage.
   ``I challenge William Bennett to a debate,'' he said, responding
to federal drug czar Bennett's lament earlier this week that the
press was glorifying the memory of a 1969 concert well-known for
rampant drug use.
   Gravy introduced Thursday's performers, who included Woodstock
veteran John Sebastian and David Massengil, Futu Futu, Willie
Nininger and Family, the Woodstock All Star Band, Leon Russell and
Edgar Winter.

   Echoes of the Woodstock festival reverberate in
American society 20 years after the counterculture concert rocked
the nation. But when it comes to rock 'n' roll itself, most people
say the tune's gone flat.
   Eight in 10 American adults have heard of the Woodstock
festival, held Aug. 15-17, 1969, on a muddy farm in upstate New
York _ and three in 10 of them wish they had attended, a Media
General-Associated Press poll has found.
   That high level of awareness was rooted in a view of Woodstock
as more of a historical milestone than simply a show. Most regard
it as the expression of a social movement, and half of them said
that movement continues today.
   Yet the view of Woodstock was not an idealized one. While nearly
six in 10 of those who knew of the festival said it has had a
lasting effect on American society, only half of them said the
effect was a positive one.
   Even more striking was the widely held opinion that times have
changed for the better. Just a quarter said the Woodstock era was a
better time than today, while half viewed it a worse time than now.
   But respondents were critical of the course of rock 'n' roll
music, the raucous hallmark of the Woodstock era: Rock music of the
Woodstock days was rated twice as highly as the rock 'n' roll of
today. Nearly half of all respondents said they still listen to
Woodstock-era rock.
   The poll, conducted among a random sample of 1,163 adults
nationwide, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.
   As could be expected, it found a dramatic generational division
in views of Woodstock. For example, 40 percent of those younger
than 45 would have liked to have attended, compared with just 10
percent of the older respondents.
   Moreover, among those who saw a lasting social impact of
Woodstock, more than 60 percent of the younger group said it was a
positive effect, while only about a quarter of the older group
agreed.
   Interest in rock music followed similar lines. More than 60
percent of those under 45 said they listen to Woodstock-era rock
'n' roll now, evidence of the sizable audience for ``classic rock''
radio programming. Of those 45 and older, just 22 percent were
tuned in to Woodstock rock.
   Overall, 50 percent rated rock music of the late 1960s and early
1970s as excellent or good, while just 27 percent gave those
favorable ratings to the rock 'n' roll of today. Among respondents
under 45, seven in 10 gave high ratings to Woodstock rock, while
only four in 10 approved of newer rock.
   The Woodstock festival, featuring most of the top rock bands of
the day, drew half a million people to Max Yasgur's farm in Bethel,
N.Y. The term ``Woodstock Nation'' soon came to refer to young
people who were agitating for an end to the Vietnam War and the
loosening of social mores.
   Twenty percent of the poll's respondents said they knew someone
who attended Woodstock, and 25 of the 1,163 people polled said they
were there.
   The survey was conducted July 7-16. Media General Inc., a
communications company based in Richmond, Va., publishes the
Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the Tampa (Fla.)
Tribune and the Winston-Salem (N.C.) Journal, and operates TV
stations WXFL in Tampa, WCBD in Charleston, S.C., and WJKS in
Jacksonville, Fla.

   Pop singer Melanie, who appeared at the
Woodstock rock festival here 20 years ago, gave a repeat performance
Saturday for about 10,000 people who came to commemorate the epic
event.
   ``Twice in one lifetime, what more could you want?'' Melanie, 42,
asked the audience during her 45-minute appearance at the farm once
owned by the late Max Yasgur.
   The crowd had been waiting all week for a performance by a
musician who appeared at the original Aug. 15-17, 1969, Woodstock
Music and Art Festival, which drew more than 400,000 young people.
   Sporadic showers sent thousands scurrying for cover, and some
left. Rain turned the original Woodstock into a muddy mess, but
concertgoers two decades ago endured it to hear and see their idols.
   Melanie, whose full name is Melanie Safka, sang from a makeshift
stage Saturday. She appeared the night before at a show billed as a
Woodstock reunion concert being held at a Catskill Mountains hotel.
   But the last of the three-day ``Remember Woodstock'' concerts at
the resort, which featured such Woodstock veterans as John Sebastian
and Johnny Winter, was canceled Saturday after drawing less than 400
people in two days.
   ``I think she (Melanie) wanted to be here because the vibes are
here,'' said Will Hoppey, who was helping coordinate this weekend's
entertainment at the original Woodstock site.
   ``This is where it's happening,'' he said.
   Until Melanie's performance, the closest thing at the original
site to a 1969 performer was Al Hendrix, father of late guitarist
Jimi Hendrix. Al Hendrix appeared Friday and signed autographs,
Hoppey said.
   An estimated 20,000 people converged on the site Friday night.
The celebration has attracted old hippies, their younger
counterparts, college kids and the curious.
   ``I'm fascinated by it,'' Walt Helhowski of West Milford, N.J.,
said as he videotaped the event. Helhowski, 55, and his wife had
planned a camping vacation at Swan Lake months ago, unaware of its
close proximity to Woodstock.
   Tess Tenbus, 32, who grew up 15 miles away, was selling copies of
newspaper articles detailing the events of 20 years ago. One copy, a
front-page blowup of the Aug. 17, 1969, Daily News of New York was a
reminder of what could happen if the rains continue.
   ``Hippies Mired in Sea of Mud,'' read the tabloid's headline.
   One thing different from the original concert, other than its
size, was the overall lack of garbage.
   ``Everyone is picking up their trash,'' said Tenbus.

   Twenty years ago today 400,000 people
descended on Max Yasgur's farm for a giant celebration of music and
youth, but residents near the site of the rock festival say this
time they're being invaded by reporters.
   ``Swedish national radio just interviewed me,'' said Arthur
Schubert, 62, who worked as a security officer at the festival.
``That makes Hong Kong, Brazil, London and some guy from Germany,
too, today. That doesn't even count the Americans.''
   Schubert is doing media relations for a Woodstock reunion
festival this weekend in nearby Swan Lake, and reporters made up a
big part of the crowd at the Woodstock site in upstate New York.
   Besides reporters, about 200 people were camping at the site,
Sullivan County sheriff's deputy Paul Pratti said Monday.
   Campers strummed guitars, bought food from vendors and watched
movies on videocassette recorders powered by portable generators.
   Police were expecting more people to arrive through the rest of
the week in the town of about 3,000, but not too many, County
Sheriff Joseph Wasser said.
   ``It's not like we're expecting an onslaught,'' Wasser said.
   The Aug. 15-17, 1969, concert is seen by many as marking the peak
of a decade of social change in the United States. The crowd
gathered at the site since Saturday included some original
festival-goers and others not even born then.
   The weather was the same as 20 years ago _ rainy _ as were
conditions on the field now owned by Charley and Debbie Gelish _
muddy.
   While Bethel is planning no official remembrance on Woodstock's
20th anniversary, the Imperial resort hotel in Swan Lake is staging
a ``Remember Woodstock'' concert Thursday to Saturday featuring such
Woodstock alumni as Melanie and John Sebastian.

   The crowd was smaller, the musicians amateur
and Saabs replaced sandals as the favored form of transportation,
but hundreds of people donned tie-dyed shirts to conjure the spirit
of Woodstock anyway.
   Twenty years after Richie Havens opened the Woodstock festival
before 400,000 people, the late Max Yasgur's old farm filled with
revelers Tuesday to celebrate one of rock 'n' roll's most sacred
anniversaries.
   ``It was a deeply spiritual experience and certainly people would
want to come back,'' said comedian Wavy Gravy, the only one of
Woodstock's original performers.
   Gravy, wearing a beanie with a propeller and carrying a walking
stick topped with a pig's snout, waved to festival veterans before
being ushered into a forest of satellite dishes for one of dozens of
interviews.
   More free enterprise than free love was evident at the upstate
New York meadow as tourists could choose between T-shirts emblazoned
with ``I survived the Woodstock Reunion'' and ``Was I Late?''
   ``I really honor the people whose spread this is for allowing
this to take place,'' Gravy said. ``It's very folksy.''
   It wasn't without a price. A man who said he was a relative of
the field's new owners, Louis Nicky and June Gelish of New York
City, asked a $5 ``field restoration'' donation from each carload.
Police said the owners squabbled with merchants who tried to sell
their wares.
   True to the spirit of the original Woodstock, when fans swarmed
over fences to transform it into a free concert, some motorists just
waited until the landlord looked the other way and snuck their
vehicles onto the field.
   Police were on hand to make sure traffic kept moving. There were
no arrests, said Sgt. Charles Kulick of the Sullivan County
Sheriff's Department. He estimated the crowd at about 600, the
largest of a celebration that had been building for a week.
   The most tension came when television reporters, nervously
approaching 6 p.m. deadlines, competed for space near the
commemorative plaque that is the only permanent fixture on the
alfalfa field.
   ``I didn't really know what to expect,'' said Ralph Corwin, a
resident of upstate New York who said he attended the original show
and has returned every year since. ``I'm just thankful that they let
us go back. The numbers have fallen down but the spirit hasn't
died.''
   On the same corner where Jimi Hendrix, the Who, the Jefferson
Airplane and the Grateful Dead performed 20 years earlier, a
makeshift stage was built for stray amateur guitarists. One singer
replaced Country Joe McDonald's infamous ``Gimme an `F''' cheer with
the more modest L-O-V-E spellalong.

   Most Woodstock-anniversary revelers left the
site of the 1969 concert Sunday, ending a week-long celebration and
leaving behind the mud and memories of yesteryear, as well as mounds
of empty beer cans.
   Despite the lack of big-name entertainers, the unsanctioned
gathering swelled to 20,000 as people came to mark the 20th
anniversary of the rock 'n' roll concert that has become a symbol of
the '60s youth movement.
   Like its predecessor, the celebration of the Woodstock Music and
Art Festival was mostly peaceful, but it was marred by a fight late
Saturday night in which a man was stabbed.
   Joseph Basto, 39, of Newburgh, N.Y., was stabbed in the abdomen
by an unidentified man at about 11 p.m. Saturday, according to
Sullivan County Sheriff Joseph Wasser. Basto was reported in
critical condition Sunday at Harris Community General Hospital.
   Wasser said no arrest has been made and police were still
interviewing witnesses to the incident Sunday.
   ``When you have 15,000 people, you can have anything,'' Wasser
said of the stabbing. ``When you go into a bar with 20 people you
can have an assault.''
   The gathering began early last week with a handful of people and
mushroomed to about 20,000 people Friday night.
   Revelers were packing up their tents and makeshift camps, and
Wasser said only about 3,500 remained Sunday in the sloping alfalfa
field in the Catskill Mountains 110 miles northwest of New York
City. Despite its name, the festival actually took place in Bethel,
about 50 miles southeast of Woodstock.
   As it was 20 years ago, the late Max Yasgur's farm was turned
into a muddy mess by celebrants and by a cold, hard rain that began
Saturday evening and lasted into Sunday morning.
   About 400,000 young people converged on the farm Aug. 15-17,
1969, to listen to music by some of rock 'n' roll's biggest stars.
   Local musicians supplied most of the entertainment this time,
although Melanie, who performed here 20 years ago, showed up early
Friday morning and sang two songs on a makeshift stage.
   The lack of big-name stars didn't discourage many celebrants.
Though the town of Bethel staunchly refused to sanction any
organized event commemorating the concert, traffic was backed up
along several of the roads as people poured in to set up camp and
party.
   Though there were about a dozen drug-related arrests over the
weekend, alcohol _ mainly beer _ seemed to be the drug of choice
among the crowd, which ranged in age from 6 to 60. Some brought
kegs, others hauled in truckloads of cases.
   ``A lot of people here are heavy beer drinkers,'' said Joe Rogers
of Queens. ``Drugs are rare.''
   Crime was rare, though someone did make off with Rogers' spare
clothes, leaving him standing in a cold rain wearing shorts, a
long-sleeved shirt and running shoes. He said he had $4 left to get
him home.
   ``It's kind of disappointing. It kind of misses the point of all
this,'' Rogers said. But, he added, ``I have never had so much fun
in my life.''

   In the spirit of the concert it's
commemorating, an unofficial Woodstock reunion is slowly coming
together with borrowed gear and donated services.
   By late Friday night cars were lining all the roads leading to
the farm where 400,000 people spent three days _ Aug. 15-17, 1969 _
listening to music, getting high and enduring shortages of food,
water and hygienic outlets.
   Unlike the original Woodstock concert, no rock stars were within
miles, but thousands of people were still pouring onto the site
regarded as sacred ground to those nostalgic for the rock culture of
the 1960s.
   Police estimate this weekend's gathering will attract up to
100,000 people, and by Friday some 35,000 had descended on the
49-acre farm 60 miles north of New York City, said Sgt. Charles
Kulick of the Sullivan County Sheriff's Department.
   Most people were willing to pay a $5 ``donation'' to gain
entrance to the farm, although there was no guarantee of
entertainment. By Friday evening local musicians were performing on
a makeshift stage using donated sound equipment powered by a donated
generator.
   ``We had no idea it would grow into this,'' said Richard Pell, as
he stood on the stage and gestured toward the crowd spread about the
sloping field.
   Pell, the unofficial coordinator of the unofficial event, said
the project started earlier in the week with a handful of guitarists
playing for a few dozen people.
   A three-day reunion concert, held 12 miles away at the Imperial
Resort in Swan Lake, flopped Thursday when only 250 people showed up
to hear performers like Edgar Winter and Woodstock veteran John
Sebastian. Bruce Taylor, the vice president of the Imperial Hotel,
offered to move Friday night's concert to the Woodstock field, but
Bethel city officials wouldn't allow it.
   ``It's not going to happen,'' said town supervisor Allan Scott.
``There's enough frenzy here already.''
   Authorities had made one drug arrest by Friday night and two
people were hospitalized, one for a drug overdose and another for
acute alchoholism.
   The urge to celebrate history's most famous rock 'n' roll concert
at its actual site and not at a Catskill Mountain resort drew a
cross-section of American culture: hippies and ex-hippies, bikers,
legions of Grateful Dead followers known as Dead-heads, businessmen
on their lunch hour, middle-aged tourists, housewives and Hasidic
Jews from nearby Catskill communities.
   ``My husband went to the first one and said we should go every
day this week and we have,'' said Lorrie Maus, a 33-year-old mother
from nearby Youngsville who brought her two children.
   Around them other children played, dogs chased each other and
music from hundreds of car stereos and acoustic guitars filled the
natural amphitheater, which was ringed by cars, buses, tents and
vendors.
   Trevor Boustead, a veteran of Woodstock, fondly recalled the late
Max Yasgur, on whose farm the original festival was held.
   ``That Yasgur, he was a good dude,'' Boustead said, recalling how
the dairy farmer gave out free milk during the concert.
``Everybody's doing the same thing now. Everybody's still friendly.
The only thing that's different is all the cars and tents.''
   Yasgur's farm now belongs to brothers Jeff And Charlie Gelish,
who were paying for half of the cost of providing water and portable
toilets for the reunion gathering.
   ``This is not a commercial venture,'' Jeff Gelish said.
   Proceeds from the entrance donation will go toward cleaning and
reseeding the field, he said. A local garbage company and a
volunteer ambulance corps are lending their services free of charge,
Gelish said.

   It was raining in Queens when two of my friends and I began what
normally is a two-hour drive to Bethel, N.Y., a spot on the map
that didn't exist to most people before the early summer of 1969.
   ``It's in the middle of the Catskills,'' I mentioned knowingly,
having spent most of my childhood summers in that area. ``Near
White Lake, not far from Monticello.''
   Right. In a couple of hours, we'd be jamming with Joe Cocker,
cruising with Crosby, Stills and Nash.
   As I headed to the concert that would attract nearly half a
million people and the attention of the world, all I could think
about was the music. The Who, the Airplane, Janis Joplin, Jimi
Hendrix, Creedence, Sly.
   The first inkling that this wasn't going to be your normal
weekend came from the radio as we drove north.
   ``The concert at Bethel already is a disaster,'' the newscaster
said. ``Local law enforcement officials are warning people to stay
away. Traffic is backed up for miles, there aren't enough supplies
at the site, tickets are useless because the fences surrounding the
area have been torn down and the weather forecast calls for heavy
rain.''
   Time to speed up. Don't want to miss any of this.
   About 90 minutes later, we approached the beginning of the
Catskill region. We noticed dozens of hitchhikers with backpacks,
coolers, even collapsed lean-tos. But no traffic jams; no rain.
   The exit ramp we needed was uphill. You don't see Route 17B
until you're practically on it. We never got on it. It was blocked
by state troopers, who were detouring all cars _ away from the
Band, Richie Havens, Canned Heat and Arlo Guthrie.
   Damn.
   ``Don't worry,'' I said with too much smugness. ``I know the
back roads.''
   ``All roads to Bethel are closed, blocked by hundreds of cars
filled with frustrated rock 'n' roll fans,'' the radio man was
saying, with nearly as much smugness as I displayed moments earlier.
   ``Not these roads, baby,'' I replied.
   We drove almost to the foot of the great meadow on Max Yasgur's
farm. All we needed was to get around a bend that would lead
directly to the site. Except there was no road left. It had become
a parking lot. So we pulled into a ditch, locked up the car and _
minus blankets, spare clothes and, I guess, our senses _ we headed
toward the music.
   After walking less than a mile, it began to rain.
Four-and-a-half miles further, we climbed a short hill and ...
   People.
   And more people.
   The music had stopped in deference to the weather. But the waves
of humanity didn't stop within my field of sight.
   And nobody was complaining. They were soaking wet, hungry,
disappointed that the stage was, for now, empty.
   They didn't yell about it. They didn't fight. They shared what
they had. One group let us crawl underneath a makeshift tent of
plastic and gave us beer and potato chips, which wound up being the
bill of fare for the weekend.
   The storm ended early enough for the concert to resume. We were
at least one-quarter mile from the stage, back near the concession
stands that were closed. There was a distinct aroma in the air, but
it had nothing to do with barbecues.
   Late Friday night, Joan Baez sang ``We Shall Overcome,'' and
anyone who had something they could light did so.
   We found space under one of the closed concessions and slept the
best we could. That afternoon, I got my introduction to Santana, as
did thousands of others who would make ``Soul Sacrifice'' an anthem
for Woodstock. It could have been 200 degrees in the shade and it
wouldn't have been as hot as the set Santana played.
   And Creedence Clearwater Revival, the group I most wanted to
hear. The four-member band put a spell on the crowd from beginning
to end with probably their best live performance ever.
   At night, there was Joplin screaming her way through ballads,
Sly getting everyone up to dance to the music and The Who
presenting the rock opera ``Tommy'' until dawn.
   Sunday morning _ and the Jefferson Airplane was just starting
its set.
   I must have been sleeping when Joe Cocker got started. I had
heard of him but didn't expect the near-spastic movements, the
gravelly voice, the lack of all conventions. I loved it.
   By now, however, the lack of substantial meals, the squalor of
the portable bathrooms and the general discomfort were more than
annoying. By early Sunday evening, a lot of people had left.
   As Cocker was finishing, it began to rain.
   A chant of ``No Rain, No Rain,'' began. Instead, we got more
rain, more rain.
   When it stopped, we thought of leaving. But Country Joe and the
Fish came on stage. The festive mood was long since gone, but the
music wasn't.
   Later Sunday, Yasgur made a speech and got a tremendous ovation,
the kind you heard when Joe Namath threw a touchdown pass.
   That night, Crosby, Stills and Nash performed. They would become
megastars, but they were awful at Woodstock. The crowd was getting
antsy to hear Hendrix and go home, and the out-of-synch vocals of
this new group were bothersome.
   I fell asleep.
   I remember waking up and hearing ``Teen Angel'' playing on
someone's radio, except there weren't any nearby. So I walked
toward the stage and saw these guys dressed in gold lame outfits
dancing around, posturing and singing hits from the '50s. Sha Na
Na. Somehow, they seemed to fit just right.
   By the time Hendrix appeared, the crowd had thinned to a more
manageable 100,000 or so. I knew this was the end and, for the only
time I can remember, it didn't matter if Hendrix played five songs
or five hours.
   As he played the ``The Star-Spangled Banner,'' I took my watch
from my pocket and looked at it for the first time all weekend.
   A few years later, I went back with my fiancee. Jimi was gone.
So was Janis. It was nothing more than a big, lush cow pasture. No
crowds. No music.
   ``It didn't seem special then,'' I said. ``It was just a great
concert.
   ``But if I ever get the chance to go back and relive one
experience, this would be it.''

   Twenty years after it rocked the nation, the Woodstock festival reverberates
in America's consciousness, a
national poll has found. But people say Woodstock's hallmark, rock 'n'
roll music, has lost its tune.
   Most Americans have heard of the three-day counterculture concert,
three in 10 of them wish they'd been there and nearly six in
10 say it has had a lasting effect on society, the Media General-Associated
Press poll found.
   But the view of Woodstock was not idealized. Only half those who saw
a lasting impact said it was a positive one, and just a
quarter of the 1,163 respondents said the Woodstock era was a better time
than today.
   Featuring many of the top rock 'n' roll bands of the day, Woodstock
drew half a million people to a muddy farm in upstate New
York from Aug. 15-17, 1969. The term ``Woodstock Nation'' soon came to
describe young people demanding an end to the Vietnam War and
the loosening of social mores.
   Of the eight in 10 respondents who had heard of Woodstock, 70 percent
said they regarded it more as the expression of a social
movement than simply a music festival. And half of them said that social
movement continues today.
   Woodstock-era rock 'n' roll did well in the test of time: Rock music
of the Woodstock days was rated twice as highly as today's
rock 'n' roll, and nearly half of all respondents said they still listen
to Woodstock rock.
   The poll, conducted by telephone among a random sample of respondents
July 7-16, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percentage points.
   It found a distinct generational split in views of Woodstock. Forty
percent of the respondents younger than 45 would have liked
to have attended, for example, compared with just 10 percent of the older
respondents.
   Moreover, among people who said the festival had a lasting social impact,
more than 60 percent of the younger group said it was a
positive effect, while only about a quarter of older respondents agreed.
   Interest in rock music followed similar lines. More than 60 percent
of those under 45 said they listen to Woodstock-era rock 'n'
roll now, evidence of the sizable audience for ``classic rock'' radio programming.
Of those 45 and older, just 22 percent were tuned
in to Woodstock rock.
   Overall, half rated rock music of the late 1960s and early 1970s as
excellent or good, while just 27 percent gave favorable
ratings to today's rock 'n' roll. Among respondents under 45, seven in
10 gave high ratings to Woodstock rock, while only four in 10

   About 500 people marked the approaching 20th
anniversary of the Woodstock music festival by camping in the rain
Saturday at the late Max Yasgur's farm.
   A mix of original festival-goers, teen-agers, yuppies and
remnants of the hippie days set up camp in the field nearly 75
miles northwest of New York City to mark the coming anniversary of
Woodstock.
   Rain turned parts of the farm into mud reminiscent of the Aug.
15-17, 1969, festival, which about 400,000 people attended.
   The land's current owners, Charley and Debbie Gelish, allowed
scores of people to camp out on a field without charge, but asked
vendors selling food, T-shirts and souvenirs for donations to
repair the field and spruce up the property.
   Traffic was moving along smoothly, Bethel Supervisor Allan Scott
said. Roads near the site had been converted to one-way trafic to
improve trafic flow.
   A Woodstock commemorative concert is scheduled for Thursday,
Friday and Saturday at the Imperial Resort Hotel in nearby Swan
Lake. The resort hopes to draw 4,000 people to the event.

   About 150 people kept vigil Monday at the
site of the Woodstock concert on the eve of the legendary event's
20th anniversary, police said.
   Police said campers on the farm once owned by Max Yasgur were
quietly milling about Monday as people strummed guitars, bought food
from vendors and watched movies on videocassette recorders powered
by portable generators.
   ``It's very quiet and orderly. No problems,'' Sullivan County
Sheriff Joseph Wasser said.
   Wasser said police have been keeping watch around the clock since
Saturday, but there have been no incidents or arrests.
   A mixture of original festival-goers and other people _ some not
even born when the original concert was held Aug. 15-17, 1969 _ have
been camping out since Saturday at the site of the festival that
drew about 400,000 people.
   The 500 or so people who showed up at the field Saturday found at
least one thing the same from 20 years ago _ the weather. Rain
discouraged revelers and by Sunday only about 200 people were
camping on the farm now owned by Charley and Debbie Gelish.
   The weather improved Monday, police said.
   Wasser said police expected more people to arrive through the
rest of the week in the tiny Sullivan County town of about 3,000,
but not too many.
   ``It's not like we're expecting an onslaught,'' Wasser said.
   Still, roads near the site had been converted to one-way to
improve traffic flow and will stay that way until Sunday, Wasser
said.
   While Bethel is planning no official remembrance on Woodstock's
20th anniversary, the Imperial resort hotel in Swan Lake is staging
a ``Remember Woodstock'' concert Aug. 17-19 featuring such Woodstock
alumni as Bert Sommer, Melanie and John Sebastian.

Is it just coincidence that more attention has been devoted this summer to the 
20th anniversary of Woodstock -- that back-yard-barbecue and rock 'n' roll 
party for 400,000 -- than to the 20th anniversary of man's first landing on the 
moon? 
</P>
<P>
Not at all, and any number of explanations loom. 
</P>
<P>
One is that there were so many eyewitnesses on Max Yasgur's farm back in August 
of 1969 that there's no dismissing Woodstock as a hoax, foisted on the world 
out of a Hollywood movie set. (The only proof brought back by those guys who 
said they went to the moon was a couple of buckets of rocks.) 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility is that Woodstock struck a deeper emotional chord with an 
entire generation (especially if you count everyone who saw the movie) than the 
sight of a couple of guys on TV hopping around the lunar surface. Jeez, we'd 
seen that years before on "Lost in Space." 
</P>
<P>
You might even consider that Woodstock is getting so much better play on TV, in 
newspapers and magazines because there's a wider variety of vintage photos 
available than for the landing on the moon. What with a half-dozen moon shots 
in all, one mission looks pretty much like the next, right? 
</P>
<P>
The real reason, I'd submit, is far more tangible. Woodstock has been doing 
stronger box-office on the nostalgia circuit because nobody gave enough thought 
to making a buck off Apollo 11. 
</P>
<P>
Think about it. Have you seen Neil Armstrong posters and T-shirts flooding 
finer department stores everywhere? Record companies issuing the flight tapes 
on triple compact-disc sets (with new liner notes by Carl Sagan)? Movie 
companies re-releasing the historic film footage to theaters and pay-per-view 
cable networks nationwide (in Lucasfilm THX stereo)? Bumper stickers with a 
photo of the moon, the NASA logo and the slogan "We did it OUR way"? 
</P>
<P>
If they had any real smarts, the feds could be selling off most of those stones 
Neil and the boys brought back from Tranquility Base as 20-year-old 
commemoratives. They could net enough to finance a manned shot to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
Let's face it -- NASA blew it. They had a hot property -- one of the monumental 
scientific explorations in history, certainly the biggest to be preserved so 
exhaustively on film, magnetic tape and computer memory -- and what did they do 
with the bulk of it? Handed it over to public television. 
</P>
<P>
Not the folks connected with Woodstock. To them, the sky's the limit. Heck, the 
hordes of individuals and corporations holding any ties whatsoever to those 
"three days of peace, love and music" not only made headlines for all the ways 
they dreamed up to cash in 20 years later, but generated even more news with 
fights over all the alleged copyright infringements. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros., which had copyrighted the name of "Woodstock," sued a bunch of 
'60s rockers -- including some of those who turned the festival into a 
marketable commodity in the first place -- to stop them from using the name in 
connection with a commemorative concert they wanted to stage. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, lacking rights to the Woodstock name hasn't prevented capitalizing 
-- with a capital CAPITAL -- on the Woodstock memory. This weekend, the "20 
Years After Music &amp; Art Festival" at Cal State Dominguez Hills is bringing 
together such Woodstock hall-of-famers as Canned Heat (minus Bob (Bear) Hite 
and Alan (Blind Owl) Wilson -- deceased), Electric Flag (minus Mike Bloomfield 
-- deceased), Big Brother &amp; the Holding Company (minus Janis Joplin -- 
deceased) and the Band of Gypsies (minus Jimi Hendrix -- deceased). 
</P>
<P>
Curious that the 20 Years After fest didn't or couldn't book 10 Years After. Is 
it because leader Alvin Lee is still alive, or because by now they'd be 30 
Years After and it'd just be too darn confusing? 
</P>
<P>
Fittingly, the whole enterprise is being sponsored by KLSX-FM, the Los Angeles 
radio station that owes its existence to dredging up hourly the Ghosts of Rock 
'n' Roll Past. Besides the retro music, there will be an "art and crafts bazaar 
featuring tie-dye shirts, hand-tooled leather and beaded goods, candles, 
pottery, musical instruments, body painting and much more activity reminiscent 
of the '60s." All the quaint accouterments. 
</P>
<P>
There's even a "psychedelic car and hippie van competition." Beginning to feel 
like Charlie Brown at Christmas, when he comes upon Snoopy decorating his dog 
house to "win, win win -- money, money, money"? 
</P>
<P>
If the real Woodstock had been born of this attitude, it wouldn't have featured 
Hendrix, Joplin, the Who and others at the forefront of popular music. It would 
have been an ode to the great music, cars and clothes of 1949. 
</P>
<P>
It's too bad Jackie Gleason isn't still around to put this all in the proper 
perspective. Wouldn't you just love to see Ralph Kramden getting more and more 
fed up with all the genuflecting over the anniversary of Woodstock, turning 
from his dinner plate and growling: 
</P>
<P>
 One a these days, Alice -- to da moon!

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The name ``Woodstock'' evokes musical memories,
and not just of the long-ago '60s. To a new generation of
musicians, the upstate New York hamlet is still among the best
places to make records, with all the equipment and none of the
exhaust fumes of Los Angeles or New York.

   Record producer Bob Clearmountain is used
to the skeptical looks he gets when he invites musicians to this
upstate New York hamlet to make records.
   ``They get this picture in their minds of a gang of hippies
running around,'' says Clearmountain, producer or mixer for Bruce
Springsteen, the Pretenders and dozens of other artists.
   Woodstock may always be synonymous with the festival that bears
its name, the last great party of the flower children before the
'70s set in.
   But to a new generation of musicians, this town of boutiques and
endless back roads has a growing reputation as one of the best
places to make a record outside the music capitals of Los Angeles
and New York.
   Like Max Yasgur's farm, the Bearsville Studio is not actually in
Woodstock. It's about two miles west, atop a hill reached by a
winding, unmarked dirt road that in winter sometimes takes two or
three attempts to climb by car.
   Despite the location, Suzanne Vega found Bearsville to record
her breakthrough hit, ``Luka.'' Robbie Robertson returned to the
site of ``Big Pink'' to mix his comeback album. Artists as diverse
as Simple Minds, Cher, Allen Ginsberg and Loudness have laid down
tracks at Bearsville in the last year.
   The big draw? A country ambiance and equipment that makes
technicians like Clearmountain marvel.
   ``It's one of my favorite studios,'' Clearmountain says. ``It's
very versatile. The recording room is very large and it's very good
for recording drums and guitars. It has a lot of air and a lot of
space ... The other room is one of the best mixing rooms that I've
ever worked in.''
   The studio is part of the late Albert Grossman's mini-empire in
the village of Bearsville, a hundred miles north of Manhattan. The
one-time manager of Bob Dylan, the Band and Janis Joplin bought a
restaurant, homes and offices and built the studio before his death
two years ago.
   The Bearsville record label, whose best-known client was fellow
resident Todd Rundgren, has been inactive since Grossman's death.
But the studio, once used almost exclusively by Bearsville artists,
has seen more action.
   ``We just kind of intensified it,'' says Grossman's widow,
Sally, who now runs the company.
   Sally Grossman may talk eagerly of the Greenwich Village clubs
she grew up around in the '60s, but her studio has the air of a
corporate retreat.
   Fresh-smelling wood paneling and blackened windows blend the
modern and rustic. Framed pictures of the cover art of albums
recorded in Bearsville during the past year line the walls of
second-floor offices.
   Halfway down the hill is one of a handful of private homes
Grossman has converted into apartments for clients to use while
recording. A second house, separated by a Catskill mountain stream
and wooden bridge, has been converted into a rehearsal studio.
   ``It's in Woodstock, not in downtown Manhattan, and if you want
to get some air you just walk outside,'' Clearmountain says. ``You
don't walk outside and get hit by bus fumes.''
   A producer with deadlines also doesn't have to worry about
distractions that cause musicians' minds to wander. Outside of a
ping pong or pool table and a nearby vegetable stand, there's not a
whole lot to do in Woodstock.
   And groupies? They'd have to be pretty determined.
   ``A lot of the groups prefer working here because of the
privacy,'' says Mary Lou Arnold, a former backup singer to Rundgren
who's acting manager of the studio. ``We maintain very strict
security. I can count on one hand the number of times fans have
been able to find this place. And when they do, they quickly go
away.''
   Of course, the isolation can quickly grow old. Clearmountain
says artists on extended projects like to split their time between
Bearsville and the city. Musicians who need to rent equipment also
have to wait longer for it to arrive.
   Bearsville's studio is also the beneficiary of the current trend
toward spacious rooms _ the better for bands to set up and run
through songs live.
   ``The people who built it, I don't think they knew what they
were doing. But the way it was built works very well,''
Clearmountain says. ``Most studios are very claustrophobic, with
lots of wires, amplifiers and drums lying around that people can
trip over. That studio is so big, you can either set up everybody
tight in a corner or spread everybody out.''
   Bearsville's growing appeal is more than technical. When a hit
record is produced there, it sets in motion music's infamous herd
mentality.
   ``We get a lot of calls from people who are new who think if
they just come in here, they'll get a hit record,'' Arnold says.
   A long walk away from the studio, the town of Woodstock is a
jumble of small shops and restaurants. Even on a brisk winter's
day, a long-haired, middle-aged man or two stands idly in a small
park, watching traffic go by.
   Woodstock already had a long history as an artist's colony
before musicians discovered it in the '60s. When Dylan moved here
from New York City, it instantly became a magnet for hipsters and
aspiring hipsters.
   It was in Woodstock, in a house dubbed ``Big Pink,'' that the
Band recorded some of its best music, including the famed
``basement tapes'' with Dylan. At the time, Dylan was recovering
from a near-fatal motorcycle accident.
   Woodstock's singular event, the three-day concert that attracted
450,000 people and such artists as Joplin, the Who, Jimi Hendrix
and Sly and the Family Stone, took place in 1969. Its actual
location was several miles away in Bethel.
   The area's musical history comes alive in cans of tapes that
fill shelves in a narrow storage room of Bearsville Studio.
Scrawled black magic markers identify the master tapes of work by
the Band, Rundgren and dozens of others.
   It's the foreign bands who are usually most interested in
Woodstock's history, Grossman says. She'll often give away books
that describe past events, and once gave an impromptu tour to a
Japanese heavy-metal band that wanted to see the sights.
   ``I think it means something,'' Clearmountain, who attended the
festival, says of the Woodstock mystique. ``Originally, people are
curious about it.''
   But it's the reputation of the studio, not the community, that
ultimately keeps musicians coming back, he says. ``It reinforces
how current we are.''

   Against a pulsating geometric background, a cartoon dove perches on a guitar. 
Both shapes swirl with psychedelic hues to the snarl of electronic feedback. 
The graphic is by Peter Max, the music is by Jimi Hendrix, and the purpose is to introduce a "Woodstock Minute" on MTV. Consisting of clips from the Warner Bros. movie "Woodstock" (airing on both MTV and its sister channel, VH-1, Aug. 6-17) and of micro-interviews with some of the performers, these snippets have been airing since May. 

   Apparently, their purpose is educational, like the "We the People" snippets CBS aired during the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution. 
It's too late -- and too painful -- to contemplate what CBS did to the Constitution. 
But it's not too late to contemplate the wisdom of entrusting the troubled, complex history of the 1960s to a cable network that sent out a press release saying, "It was the summer of '69. 
Lyndon Johnson was in the White House." 

   When I mentioned this error to an MTV publicist, she explained, with some embarrassment, that the people writing the press releases were "very young." 
"Either that or they were at Woodstock," I quipped, offering a variation on the current joke: If you can remember the 1960s, then you weren't really part of what was happening. 

   Most of us can remember that Richard Nixon was in the White House during the summer of '69 -- the same year that U.S. troops in Vietnam peaked at 550,000, a figure not far off the 500,000 who gathered on that hillside in Bethel, N.Y., for the mid-August Woodstock Music and Art Fair: An Aquarian Exposition. 
We can also place Woodstock on a descending curve of countercultural "be-ins," from the blissed-out Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 to the bottomed-out Rolling Stones concert in Altamont in December 1969. 

   But the joke touches a nerve. 
In a way, the 1960s generation deserves to see its own past cut down to film clips and glib quips, because it did practically the same thing to the past it inherited. 
Most people at Woodstock were middle class and semi-educated; their poor and working-class counterparts were too busy fighting, supporting or surviving the Vietnam War to dabble in Hermann Hesse and Herbert Marcuse. 
Yet the ideas the Woodstockians were "into" were astoundingly superficial. 

   They were into romanticism. 
They abandoned their cars, hiked to the festival, and cheered when the New York State Thruway (that symbol of modern industrial society) was closed down. 
When it rained, they stripped naked and let the downpour rinse their grubby bodies. 
When it got hot, they skinny-dipped and had sexual intercourse in the water, in the grass, in the mud and in public. 
They went back to nature and deposited 600 acres of garbage. 

   They were into socialism. 
They came without tickets, crashed the gate, and cheered when the investors announced that they were "taking a bath" to make it "a free concert." 
In fact, they had already gotten their money back from the sale of film and record rights. 
The Woodstockians believed that their "nation" was a viable alternative to "the system" -- even though the festival's food, water and medical care had to be donated by the local townspeople and the military. 

   They were into transcendence. 
They tried yoga, they quoted Carlos Castaneda. 
When Sly Stone led them in "I Want to Take You Higher," he knew as an ex-gospel singer that he was borrowing the music of the black church. 
But the crowd didn't. 
It thought its ecstasy came from something generically called "rock 'n' roll," enhanced by smoking a joint or dropping a tab of acid. 
And despite all the bad trips and the ugly deaths that followed Woodstock, many went on believing that loud music and drug abuse were the path to Nirvana. 

   Romanticism, socialism, transcendence -- even at Woodstock, these ideas were deemed "heavy," due to the historical and cultural weight they carried. 
But 1960s youths believed they could jettison the weight and still grasp the ideas. 
For them, history was like Alice's Restaurant, a place where "you can get anything you want" without really having to pay for it. 

   This casual appropriation of serious ideas is one reason why it's so hard to talk about the 1960s without being either too serious or too casual. 
On the one hand, the pop-cultural scholar who traces the influence of Martin Hiedegger on John Lennon's lyrics ought to lighten up. 
On the other hand, the post-modernist MTV film editor who Cuisinarts the 1960s along with the rest of human history ought to read a good book. 

   Or a slightly nutty book, like "The Rainbow," by D.H. Lawrence. 
In connection with Woodstock, let me recommend an excellent film version of this odd but powerful novel. 
Beginning Saturday night, this three-hour BBC production continues Aug. 12 and 19 (9-10 p.m. and 1-2 a.m. EDT, on A&amp;E). 
Not to be confused with Ken Russell's lurid theatrical film with the same title, this TV version of "The Rainbow" is simply the best screen adaptation of Lawrence I've ever seen. 

   The connection with Woodstock? 
The main character, Ursula Brangwen (Imogen Stubbs) craves both passion and liberation. 
The film improves on Lawrence by trimming the rhetoric and more effectively dramatizing key scenes: Ursula stripping naked to commune with nature; Ursula striding through a grim coal mine to denounce "the system"; Ursula running across a moonlit hillside to free her imprisoned spirit. 
Clearly this is a girl who would not have been out of place at Woodstock. 

   Or would she have been? 
The trouble with Lawrence's ideas is that he never made them jibe with the ordinary demands of social life. 
He never had to, because he never imagined the sound of 500,000 voices yelling the F-word in unison with Country Joe and the Fish. 
For us, however, there's a lesson in Woodstock. 
The next time we feel seduced by some fevered rhetoric about the need to exalt blind instinct over oppressive reason, consider the difference between one naked girl on a moonlit hillside and several thousand naked girls on a moonlit hillside.

   If you were part of the throng at the Woodstock
music festival 20 years ago this summer, Life magazine wants to
know.
   More specifically, Life wants to know what happened to people
who appeared in photographs in its special issue published a few
weeks after that three-day celebration in August 1969.
   Life's editors spent about $37,000 for a full-page advertisement
that ran in the New York Times earlier this week asking
``Woodstock: Were you there?''
   The ad included a photo from the 1969 issue of a scraggly couple
posing in a clearing among the trees during the festival and a
coupon which readers were asked to complete and mail in if they
were there a generation ago.
   ``What do you remember about those three days of peace and love
and mud? Did the experience change you life? Where are the people
you went to Woodstock with?'' the coupon asks.
   A promotional trick to boost circulation? It won't hurt.
   But Life's managing editor, Patricia Ryan, said she hopes the ad
will attract as many as 20,000 replies that her staff will use in
assembling a special Woodstock anniversary section for the August
issue.
   She said she hopes to run some of the old photos from the 1969
issue next to current ones and include a few stories about what has
happened to those folks since Woodstock.
   ``We were just sitting around looking at pictures and we started
wondering where are they today? Are they bankers, brokers, junk
bond salesmen, farmers?'' she said.
   The Woodstock Music and Arts Festival, which featured
appearances by some of the biggest rock music performers of the
day, ran from Aug. 15-17 on a farm in Bethel, N.Y. The event, which
suffered soaking rainstorms and mud, attracted an estimated half
million people and became a symbol for a generation of how people
can coexist peacefully in trying circumstances.
   Life, a Time Inc. publication, won't be alone in marking the
event.
   Rolling Stone asked its own readers in January to send along
their reminiscences about Woodstock for inclusion in the bimonthly
magazine's issue that goes on sale Aug. 8. Spokesman Stu Zakim said
the magazine got more than 1,000 replies.
   MTV Networks is planning special programming over the next
several months ranging from periodic ``Woodstock Minutes'' to
showing the three-hour Warner Bros. movie ``Woodstock'' on its MTV:
Music Television and VH-1: Video Hits One cable networks.
   Neither Life, with a monthly circulation of 1.8 million, nor
Rolling Stone, with circulation of 1.175 million, increased their
ad rates for the anniversary issues, which the companies expect to
be big sellers.
   Why did Life wait until late May to ask for additional material
for an issue that is expected to be completed in early July?
   ``Sometimes you get good ideas late,'' said Ms. Ryan.

   Drug czar William J. Bennett sounded a
distinctly negative note Tuesday about the nostalgia that has welled
up around the 20th anniversary of Woodstock.
   Bennett emerged from a White House meeting on anti-drug strategy
with President Bush to complain about ``memory distortion'' going on
about the rock concert in upstate New York that captivated a
generation in 1969.
   The 45-year-old Bennett, a onetime guitar player and fan of early
rock 'n' roll, recited what he called ``the casualty list from
Woodstock'': rock performers, including singer Janis Joplin, who
died in later years from drug overdoses.
   Bennett, who as a graduate student at the University of Texas in
the late 1960s had a blind date with Joplin, complained about the
torrent of publicity marking the anniversary of the three-day
counterculture festival.
   He said ``part of the legacy of Woodstock was tolerance of drugs
and let us be glad that is over rather than wishing it were back. We
do not want 1969 back in terms of its view of drugs. We've come too
far.''
   People ``have been hearing today and probably will hear ad
nauseam over the next couple of days fond memories and nostalgia
about Woodstock, and there's a lot of memory distortion going on,''
he said.
   ``The next time you hear somebody gushing about Woodstock and
`Why can't it be that way today?' remind them of the casualty list
from Woodstock.
   ``In order of performance:
   ``_Janis Joplin, who died in 1970 of a drug overdose;
   ``_Jimi Hendrix, dead, 1970 drug overdose;
   ``_Keith Moon of the Who, dead of a drug overdose in '78;
   ``_Paul Butterfield Blues Band _ Butterfield died of a drug
overdose in '87.
   ``Woodstock was a time of a great deal of tolerance for drug use
and it was also a time of a great deal of death, because of the
tolerance of drugs,'' said Bennett.

   Leaders of little Woolstock, Iowa, say
they're not about to allow a concert in the town park on the
anniversary of the Woodstock rock festival because they're worried
about drugs and undesirables.
   But the radio station sponsoring the event said the show will go
on whether the city likes it or not, on private land if need be.
And besides, how many undesirables are going to show up at supper
time on a week night? Even if there are free hot dogs?
   The City Council in the north-central Iowa town of 230 people
voted 4-1 Friday to prohibit radio station KRIT in Fort Dodge,
about 20 miles from Woolstock, from holding a two-hour concert at
the park Tuesday night to observe the 20th anniversary of Woodstock.
   In 1969, a long list of leading rock groups attracted more than
500,000 people to a dairy farm in the Catskills of New York state,
actually about 45 miles from Woodstock.
   KRIT officials said they were inspired to hold the concert
because Woolstock is just a letter away from Woodstock, but despite
that similarity they said the town really doesn't have to fear it
will be overrun.
   Woolstock officials said they didn't want to take a chance.
   ``We're not an anti-social town,'' said Councilman Norval Story,
who voted with the majority. ``We like to have these gatherings.
But we were kind of concerned about the element that might come in.
The drug problem is bad enough as it is.''
   Story and Woolstock Mayor Kenneth Spellmeyer said the event
could have been sponsored at the park if KRIT had given the town a
little time to plan. Instead, they said, town officials learned of
the event in newspaper accounts last week.
   ``I think they're blowing it up a little,'' said KRIT news
director Amy Alberts.
   ``Look, it's from 6 to 8 p.m., no alcohol will be allowed and
it's in a fairly remote area on a Tuesday night, so you're not
going to have that many people,'' she said.
   Instead of Jimi Hendrix or Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, the
musical talent is Scott Dohrmann of Barnum and Kevin Lind of Fort
Dodge, both guitarists.
   ``They're the most wholesome guys in the whole world,'' Ms.
Alberts said. ``Sure, there will be music from the '60s and a sound
system, but there won't even be any drums.''
   ``And there can't be all that many people. If anybody has to
work the next day, they certainly aren't going to drive too far.
It's Tuesday night, after all.'' However, there will be the
attraction of free hot dogs and soft drinks, courtesy of KRIT.
   Dorhmann does not have a telephone listing and no one answered
the telephone at Lind's residence.
   As for the failure to notify town officials in advance, Ms.
Alberts said the radio station didn't know it needed to ask for
permission. Besides, she said, the town didn't have to do anything.
   ``It's up to KRIT to do all the planning. It was our event. If a
family were planning a reunion in the Woolstock city park, it's the
family that puts it together,'' she said.
   Ms. Alberts said the radio station is determined to hold the
event regardless of whether it has the blessing of the Woolstock
council.
   ``This is going to happen no matter what,'' she said. ``Before
the council met, an area farmer called us and said he suspected
they would vote it down. He said we could use some of his land.
   ``And we got a call from a person in Woolstock who said he had a
big lot where we could hold it.''
   She said radio officials will visit the proposed sites and make
a decision on where to hold the show by Monday morning.

 -- What if they didn't give a concert and everybody came? Not a single rock 
star was scheduled to perform, but cars were lining the roads leading to the 
former Max Yasgur farm where the Woodstock Festival took place 20 years ago. A 
crowd estimated to be at least 20,000 showed up, although some proved 
themselves less hardy than their predecessors by leaving when they were rained 
on. In contrast, a reunion concert 12 miles from Bethel, N.Y., at a resort 
flopped when only 250 people came to see such performers as John Sebastian and 
Edgar Winter. An offer to move the concert to the farm was nixed by Bethel. 
"There's enough frenzy here already," town Supervisor Allan Scott said. Most of 
the Woodstock pilgrims were willing to pay a $5 donation, which is to go toward 
cleaning and reseeding the field when the party's over. Current owners Jeff and 
Charlie Gelish were paying half the cost of providing water and portable 
toilets, and garbage and ambulance services were donated. The crowd was an 
eclectic mix including hippies, bikers, Grateful Dead fans, middle-aged 
tourists and housewives. Local musicians were doing their best to entertain the 
crowd on a makeshift stage, using sound equipment and a generator that were 
donated. Finally, one of the original performers, Melanie, showed up for a 
45-minute encore. "Twice in one lifetime, what more could you want?" she said.

 -- An original painting of Mickey Mantle used to create his 1953 baseball card 
fetched $110,000 as the Topps Co. auctioned 35 years' worth of rare cards and 
pictures. Topps spokesman Norman Liss said the winning bid was from Marriott 
Corp., which also paid $80,000 for artwork of Willie Mays from the same year. A 
Jackie Robinson painting brought $71,000 from an unidentified bidder. Paintings 
of Whitey Ford, Bob Feller and Roy Campanella went to the Rarities Group of 
Marlboro, Mass., a collectibles company, for prices ranging from $15,000 to 
$32,000.

 -- The object of the game is to go down the water slide and reach the 
air-conditioned doghouse. On the weekend before jury selection begins in PTL 
founder Jim Bakker's trial on fraud and conspiracy charges, the Charlotte 
Observer in North Carolina published a board game called "Down the Tube." It 
asks true-false questions about the lives of Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye. 
If you land on Tammy's face, you advance four spaces. But if you land on 
evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, you must "return to start and sob your heart out."

   It was a three-day festival dedicated to
peace, love and music, and there was plenty of long hair and mud as
well.
   But it wasn't Woodstock, not even close. It was the Creation '90
festival, an annual gathering of born-again Christians in the heart
of the Pennsylvania mountains.
   ``We don't mind people calling it a Christian Woodstock, as long
as people understand it's not centered around drugs and rock stars
who are not Godly,'' said the Rev. Harry Thomas, a Beach Boys
look-alike who runs the show with a Bible in his hand.
   Stage right are food booths and record stores and straight out
from the arena is a tent for Christian seminars. To the left is the
Agape Farm baptismal pond.
   ``Music for us has a message in itself, but we want it to lead
somewhere,'' Thomas said Friday, the middle day of the festival.
``First we want it to lead to the word of God, and then to action.''
   One path seldom taken is to the barber shop. Steve Pannier of
The Altar Boys, Southern California's Bad Boys of Gospel, has
spiked hair that would put Billy Idol to shame _ and apparel and
jewelry to match.
   ``We all grew up in a rock 'n' roll atmosphere. We gave our
lives to the Lord and didn't feel like changing our clothes,'' he
said.
   Christian rock began moving toward the mainstream with Larry
Norman in the late 1960s and 70s, and later with Randy Stonehill.
Much of today's Christian sound comes from the rock music classics.
   ``I grew up listening to Jimi Hendrix, The Who, The Beatles and
The Byrds and after I became a Christian I listened to Jimi
Hendrix, The Who, The Beatles and The Byrds,'' said Mike Stand,
another Altar Boy.
   The gospel market today has caught the eye of mainstream record
companies. Several of the 28 groups featured Thursday, Friday and
Saturday have big-label contracts.
   ``We're sold as a pop act to Warner Bros., but there's no doubt
where we're coming from,'' said Dave Mullen, lead singer of One
Blood and a former radiation physicist from Florida.
   Christian music festivals in the late 1970s and 1980s most
resembled Woodstock because the only goal seemed to be fun and
music, Thomas said. He and his co-producer, Tim Landis, want more
from this year's 35,000 campers.
   ``I see a depth in the crowd today that wasn't there in the
Jesus Festival days, when people were turning from drugs to
Jesus,'' Thomas said. ``Our people are being challenged to do
things.''
   For example, some groups are invited in to share stories and
attract support from the festival-goers. One of the biggest is
Compassion International, a Colorado group fighting world hunger.
   ``They've put a special emphasis on our programs ... put
together an all-star band and sold record albums nationally and
internationally to help sponsor children,'' Thomas said.
   Like Woodstock, Creation '90 even had rip-off artists, stealing
from the record and book store adjacent to the concert field.
   ``Not everybody here is born again,'' said Ed Kabakjian,
supervisor of the bookstore.

   Plans are being laid for the 20th
anniversary of the Woodstock festival, but community leaders here
are not excited at the prospect of being included in any
commemoration of peace, love and rock 'n' roll.
   The New York festival in August 1969 came to symbolize the 1960s
for a generation of Americans. But for some people here, 50 miles
north of Chicago, Woodstock evokes thoughts of trouble.
   ``This is a small, mid-Victorian town that's trying to stay that
way,'' said Mayor Jim Shoemaker.
   ``We've had a lot of events where there was a good-sized number
of people but they were ones that we planned, ones the town
wanted,'' he said Thursday night.
   ``We don't go too much for these pre-packaged things were they
add water, mix it up and serve it to you.''
   WCKG-FM, a Chicago radio station that plays classic rock, has
hired a company to plan a two-day anniversay festival, one of
several planned around the country.
   The McHenry County Fairgrounds, part of which lies in Woodstock,
population 15,000, is one of eight sites being considered for the
WCKG event, said Tom Drilias, vice president of Festival Events,
Inc.
   Organizers hope to attract 25,000 people to hear singers on
three stages perform folk and rock music of the late 1960s. There
would be arts and crafts displays, carnival rides, food booths and
beer tents.
   The original three-day peace and love fest, held on a farm near
Woodstock in upstate New York, drew some 300,000 people who swayed
to the sounds of Jimi Hendrix, Joan Baez, Sly and the Family Stone,
The Who and others.
   The event was plagued by heavy rain, lack of food and sanitation
facilities, drug overdoses and massive traffic jams.
   ``I think it's the memory of 20 years ago that makes people say
`we don't want that here,''' Shoemaker said.
   Some local merchants, however, would welcome the visitors.
   ``Being a small carry-out, the business would be appreciated,''
said Kathy Dugas, who owns Ma Bill's Snack Spot on the town square.
   To hold such an event, organizers would be required to get
permits from the county.
   ``I don't think they've got too much of a chance,'' Shoemaker
said.

FT  13 AUG 94 / Baby boomers and the counter-culture: A Grateful Dead
concert took Barry D Wood's thoughts back to Woodstock. He asks why the
optimism vanished
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY D WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glenn and Ira Goldfarb were not yet five when I attended my first Grateful
Dead concert in Berkeley 24 years ago. Typical of new generation Dead-heads,
the Goldfarb brothers go to several of the band's concerts each year. Months
ago they identified two nights in Washington as the time to escape from
wives and children and commune with a past they have romanticised but never
experienced.
The brothers ordered concert tickets. When we met, Glenn and Ira were
already in the de rigueur brightly coloured tie-dyed T-shirts that hark back
to psychedelic Haight Ashbury, where the Grateful Dead were already a legend
by the late 1960s. Few would have guessed the Glenn is a chef and Ira a tax
accountant.
On a hot summer night, Jerry Garcia, Grateful Dead vocalist, guitarist and
song writer, wore purple shorts and T-shirt. He arrived back stage in a golf
cart, overweight, tired and looking older than his 51 years. His frizzy hair
is white. There were deep creases behind his dark glasses, a legacy of too
much hard living.
The band began to play. Any lingering reservations about whether I wanted to
be there disappeared.
The tilting country rock melodies invited movement and response. When Garcia
sang cheers welled up from the crowd of 60,000. 'Come hear Uncle John's
band, down by the river side, he's come to take his children home.'
The voice still projects the sweet, mournful high notes. It was like the old
days and remained so for two hours through a gentle rain willingly endured
by the young and not so young alike. Pipes were passed. The pungent aroma of
marijuana was pervasive. People swayed to the music.
Beautiful girls with long hair and flowing skirts danced in the stadium
corridors and sidelines just as their mothers may have done. I realised that
I am like the Goldfarbs, reaching out to connect with something authentic
that has been lost.
Garcia called the Grateful Dead performance at the original Woodstock in
1969 miserable. That is one reason these Bohemian troubadours were not
invited back for the 25th anniversary extravaganza Woodstock 94: 'Two More
Days of Peace and Music.' But they would not have gone anyway. 'You can't
put lightning in a bottle twice,' said Dennis McNally, a PhD in American
history and long-time Grateful Dead publicist.
The year 1969 stands out for two reasons: the landing on the moon and
Woodstock. The vision, ingenuity and tenacity that culminated in Apollo 11
have turned into indifference and cynicism towards space exploration.
Moonwalker Buzz Aldrin said on the 25th anniversary that 'an eerie apathy
now seems to inflict the very generation who witnessed and were inspired by'
the moon landing. But 'for one crowning moment,' said Aldrin, 'we were
creatures of the cosmic ocean, a moment that 1,000 years hence may be seen
as the signature of our century.'
They are words that might have been uttered at Woodstock. It was billed the
Woodstock Art and Music Festival. The promoters optimistically dreamt that
200,000 might attend. Twice that many appeared. Woodstock became a defining
moment, a generational conclave of music lovers, hippies and war protesters.
Few paid the Dollars 18 price of admission.
Now, 25 years later, the successors of the people Joni Mitchell called the
'children of God', have paid Dollars 135 (Pounds 87) to attend the bigger of
two planned rival Woodstock anniversary concerts. The smaller event was
cancelled earlier this month after poor ticket sales.
At the remaining event, the one that may have cost Dollars 100m, there is an
inter-active video theme park. Tickets were delivered by overnight express
to prevent counterfeiting. The event had big-company sponsors. There are
licensed T-shirts and logos. The music is available on pay-per-view cable
television.
The cancelled event, which would have been held 50 miles away in Bethel, New
York, had attracted fewer of the original performers, would have cost only
Dollars 95, and was to have taken place on the authentic sacred ground.
What used to be called the counter-culture has triumphed. Baby boomers live
in the White House. And yet the problems that that brash, over-confident
youth hoped to overcome have become more intractable and pervasive. Only on
the environment is there discernible progress. Smokers and polluters are on
the defensive. The concept that planet earth is something to be protected is
standard liturgy for school children everywhere.
While America is no longer polarised by Vietnam, civil rights, or
capitalism, the social contract is more frayed than ever. The optimism, joy
and vision of 1969 have vanished.
The American radicals of the late 1960s looked to rock music for salvation.
It was as if Grace Slick and street-fighting Mick Jagger would lead an
assault on the capital. These implausible heroes are as embarrassing from
the perspective of 1994 as Che Guevara or Ho Chi Minh.
The Grateful Dead survive and prosper 25 years later at least in part
because they resisted the temptation to be more than a band.

   Although much has been made of the Woodstock
generation's aging, the heroes of the festival are for the most
part doing now what they did then.
   In the order they appear on a monument at Yasgur's farm, here's
who are and what became of them:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Richie Havens: Still performing, still an activist. Currently
on a 20th anniversary tour with several other Woodstock veterans.
   _ Arlo Guthrie: The son of legendary folk singer Woody Guthrie
is still performing.
   _ Joan Baez: Her activist work continues unabated. She appeared
at Live Aid. In 1987, she released her memoirs ``And a Voice to
Sing With,'' and a new album, ``Recently.''
   _ Joe Cocker: His career took off after Woodstock. Still
performing; nominated for an Academy Award in 1983 for ``Up Where
We Belong,'' his duet with Jennifer Warnes for the movie, ``An
Officer and a Gentleman.''
   _ Ravi Shankar: The sitar player who introduced George Harrison
to Eastern music is still performing. He is 69.
   _ Janis Joplin: Died on Oct. 4, 1970, of a drug overdose. She
was 27.
   _ Jimi Hendrix: Died on Sept. 18, 1970, of a drug overdose. He
was 27.
   _ Johnny Winter: The original (and only) albino blues guitarist
enjoyed his greatest success after Woodstock; still playing.
   _ Creedence Clearwater Revival: Broke up in October 1972. Lead
singer John Fogerty's latest solo release was 1986's ``Eye of the
Zombie.''
   _ Mountain: Split in 1972. Guitarist Leslie West released a solo
album last year; bassist Felix Pappalardi was shot and killed by
his wife in April 1983.
   _ Santana: The band has flourished for two decades with a
variety of line-ups. A Carlos Santana retrospective, titled ``Viva
Santana!,'' was released last year.
   _ John Sebastian: Also on the 20th anniversary tour. His last
hit was 1976's theme for ``Welcome Back, Kotter;'' his name is
misspelled on the Woodstock memorial plaque as ``Sabastian.''
   _ The Who: Singer Roger Daltrey, guitarist Pete Townshend and
bassist John Entwistle are on a 25th anniversary tour, ending a
seven-year layoff. Drummer Keith Moon died of an overdose on Sept.
7, 1978. He was 32.
   _ Canned Heat: Broke up in 1976. Two of its founders died:
guitarist Al ``Blind Owl'' Wilson on Sept. 3, 1970, and vocalist
Bob ``The Bear'' Hite of a drug-related heart attack in April 1981.
   _ The Grateful Dead: Touring again this summer. A new album is
due in September from the band, which has repeatedly called its
Woodstock performance mediocre. Keyboardist Ron ``Pigpen'' McKernan
died of a liver ailment in May 1973. He was 27.
   _ Paul Butterfield Blues Band: The pioneering white blues band
started the blues explosion of the 1960s and broke up in 1972.
Butterfield died on May 5, 1987, of a drug overdose. He was 44.
   _ Sly and the Family Stone: Despite a brilliant Woodstock set,
the group's success was short-lived; by 1973, their heyday was
over. Leader Sylvester Stewart has been plagued by drug problems
and last released an album in 1983.
   _ The Jefferson Airplane: After years of in-fighting, personnel
switches, lawsuits and a divorce, the Airplane reformed this summer
with original members Grace Slick, Jorma Kaukonen, Jack Casady,
Paul Kantner and Marty Balin.
   _ The Band: The only act whose members lived in Woodstock. They
disbanded after ``The Last Waltz'' in 1976. Pianist Richard Manuel
committed suicide on March 4, 1986; its other members are still
performing.
   _ Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young: Reunited last year for
``American Dream,'' their first studio album since 1971's ``Deja
Vu.'' All four continue to perform separately and together. Crosby
detailed his drug addiction last year in a best-selling
autobiography, ``Long Time Gone.''
   _ Blood, Sweat and Tears: Their string of hits ended abruptly in
1971. They have continued to play, with and without vocalist David
Clayton Thomas.
   _ Melanie: Her career slowed down after such early '70s hits as
``Brand New Key.'' Also on the 20th anniversary tour, and has an
album due out this year.
   _ Ten Years After: Guitarist-vocalist Alvin Lee's band
dissembled in May 1975. Reunited this year with new LP, ``About
Time,'' their first in 15 years. During split, Lee has been
performing, while bassist Leo Lyons, keyboardist Chick Churchill
and drummer Rick Lee have stayed in music, producing, engineering
and managing. Last summer a German promoter offered to hire Ten
Years After for four festivals.
   _ Sweetwater: The Los Angeles group released three albums and
broke up in 1971. Lead singer Nancy Nevins de Johgh is now a
short-story writer.
   _ Sha-Na-Na: The '50s revival band has enjoyed continued success
(including a brief network television show) since Woodstock. Their
tour schedule includes shows in Las Vegas.
   _ The Incredible String Band: The Scottish group mixed Indian
music with rock 'n' roll. They split in the mid-'70s, although
co-leader Bruce Williamson still performs in Los Angeles.
   _ Country Joe and the Fish: The stars of the Woodstock movie and
soundtrack album split after the festival. Country Joe McDonald is
on the 20th anniversary tour.

   Parked amid the tents and trailers littering
the alfalfa field, the site of rock 'n' roll's most memorable
concert 20 years ago Tuesday, was a jeep with the license plate ``TV
Junkie.''
   It was in the right place. Woodstock's 20th anniversary party was
a premier media event, with dozens of reporters elbowing each other
to find out if the peace and love generation had lost its way in the
1980s.
   A forest of satellite dishes surrounded a plaque that
commemorated the epochal three-day concert that attracted some
400,000 spectators. Woodstock veterans and wistful ``wannabes''
barely had the chance to formulate their reminiscences before being
asked to share them with the world.
   ``You want my favorite quote?'' Debbie Armstrong, of Montgomery,
N.Y., called out as a reporter wandered by a tent thick with tattoos
and tie-dyed shirts. ``We feel like we're at the Orange County Fair
_ only we're the attraction.''
   Much to some people's disappointment, there was no organized
celebration of Woodstock's 20th anniversary at the late Max Yasgur's
one-time farm. Rather, it was a free-form party, as tourists mingled
with campers staking their turf under the watchful eyes of dozens of
cameras.
   Armstrong and her friends said they'd been interviewed about a
dozen times. Their favorite came Monday night, when they crowded
around a campfire and shouted ``Goodnight from Woodstock'' on cue to
a cameraman from Scranton, Pa.
   ``This has turned into such a media event,'' she said. ``Back
then, they (reporters) weren't even into the heart of it. It took 20
years for the spirit to sink in.''
   But the attention has its downside, she said.
   ``A lot of people are drawn toward the cameras,'' she said. ``A
lot of people are behaving because the press is looking.''
   That didn't stop one man with a cast on his foot from holding up
a marijuana cigarette. When questioned by a reporter, his companion
said she was from Venus.
   Twenty-year-old Denise Frangipane of Bethel said she'd been
camping at the site for the last four days, ``because we weren't
there last time. I'm getting tired of saying that.'' She said she
made the same statement the day before to a German television crew,
or was it a French team?
   A makeshift stage crammed with speakers stood at the bottom of
the natural amphitheater where Richie Havens launched the original
Woodstock with a three-hour show.
   ``Anybody who has anything just gets up and plays,'' Frangipane
said. Despite hopeful rumors spreading through the crowd that the
Grateful Dead would make a return engagement, the stage was empty
Tuesday afternoon.
   Makeshift hot dog, souvenir and T-shirt stands lined the country
road leading to the field, where several hundred people were
gathered Tuesday.
   A representative of the field's current owners, June Gelish and
Louis Nicky of New York City, collected $5 from each carload for
``field restoration.''
   Ron Anderson, 42, put a guitar in the back of his car and drove
up from Coventry, Conn., for the day. He'd already been interviewed
by reporters from enough channel numbers to make up a lottery card.
   He wasn't at the original concert, but said he was glad to
experience it this way.
   ``I didn't really know what to expect. I found it to be quite
interesting. We've met some pretty nice people,'' he said.

   Every other month, cemetery workers tending Jimi
Hendrix's grave replace the lawn worn away by fans.
   Every day they take away the offerings left near his granite
marker the night before: marijuana butts, lighters, guitar picks.
   Twenty years after Woodstock _ and 19 years after Hendrix _
admirers still come to sit and think about the young man who helped
define psychedelic rock.
   When Hendrix cranked up his Fender Stratocaster, the Earth
became ``The Third Stone From the Sun,'' and a nation of rebellious
youth grooved to ``The Star-Spangled Banner.''
   When he hit Woodstock in August 1969, his music and his career
were soaring. A year and a month later they crashed.
   He died in his sleep Sept. 18, 1970, while on a European tour.
The coroner's report said he choked on his own vomit. The trace of
barbituates in his blood was small, not enough to kill, the coroner
said.
   Hendrix was born in Seattle in 1942. He left Garfield High
School after his junior year to join the Army because he didn't
want to spend another summer mowing the lawns for his father's
landscape business.
   ``He wanted one of those screaming eagles on his shoulder,''
said James A. ``Al'' Hendrix, referring to the patch worn by
paratroopers from the 101st Airborne Division.
   Hendrix served after Korea and before Vietnam, when lyrics from
his songs would be scribbled on soldiers' helmets.
   He went by Jimmy in those days and was shy, his father said. The
shortened name and stage antics, such as squirting lighter fluid on
his burning guitar, were just show business he adopted later.
   ``He was a good boy,'' the 70-year-old Hendrix said. ``He played
Little League, football, swimming. We called him `Buster' 'til he
was 9 or 10. Then he wanted to be called Jimmy.''
   Jimmy and his younger brother, Leon, were raised by their
father. His parents were divorced and his mother died when he was
10.
   The family's console record player filled the rooming house
where they lived with B.B. King and Muddy Waters, and young Jimmy
mimicked the records, using a broom for a guitar.
   ``I had this old ukelele from one of my jobs,'' said his father,
a former musician in Vancouver, British Columbia. ``I gave it to
him. Of course he couldn't get much music out of it.''
   So Al Hendrix paid a friend $5 for his acoustic guitar and gave
it to Jimmy. The first electric guitar was bought at a music shop
along with a saxophone for dad. When they fell behind on payments,
the sax went back, but the electric guitar stayed.
   ``I told him he'd go farther with that guitar than I would with
the sax,'' Hendrix said with a laugh. ``I never did get him an amp.
He used to plug into his friends'. Still, he got music out of it.
The Peter Gunn theme was one of the first things I remember him
playing.''
   Hendrix didn't return to Seattle when a back injury from a
parachute jump ended his military career. Instead, he headed East
in search of the music scene, and played in backup bands for the
Supremes, the Isley Brothers and Little Richard.
   Hendrix's guitar playing attracted a record producer who took
him to England. He became ``Jimi.'' Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding
were added to make the Jimi Hendrix Experience.
   The band conquered Europe, and played at the Monterey Pop
Festival in 1967, which led to a record contract and a tour with
the Monkees, the made-for-television pop group. Predictably, the
music styles clashed and the tour was cut short. By August 1969,
the Experience was finished but Hendrix's music was taking off. He
formed the short-lived Band of Gypsies with Buddy Miles and Billy
Cox, whom he'd met in the Army.
   Hendrix left behind a rich musical legacy, influencing a
generation of musicians such as Prince and Eric Clapton. His
records still are among the best sellers at many stores. The heart
of his discography remains ``Are You Experienced?,'' ``Axis: Bold
as Love'' and ``Electric Ladyland.''
   Seattle has been slow to honor Hendrix, partly because his
reputation for drugs and sex didn't seem exemplary for young
citizens. Garfield High School put his bust in the second-floor
library and, when city fathers balked at a plaque in a city park,
the British director of Seattle's zoo volunteered a spot.
   Today, visitors must stand on the Jimi Hendrix memoril rocks for
the best view of the giraffes, zebras and gazelles in the zoo's
African savanna exhibit.
   A bronze sunburst marks the spot, and a sign in the shrubs
nearby reads: ``There's no telling how many lives your spirit will
go through _ die and be reborn.'' _ Jimi Hendrix.

   Soviet fans jumped, danced and wrapped themselves
in giant American flags Saturday as some of heavy metal's biggest
stars made their Soviet debut in Moscow's biggest-ever hard rock
concert.
   The benefit concert, a two-day extravaganza billed as the
``Moscow Music Peace Festival'' and likened to the Woodstock
festival of 20 years ago, features Western musicians Motley Crue,
Bon Jovi, Scorpions, Cinderella, Ozzy Osbourne, and Skid Row as
well as the Soviet groups Nuance, Gorky Park and Brigada S.
   Proceeds will go to programs that fight drug and alcohol abuse
in the United States and the Soviet Union.
   About 100,000 fans filled the Lenin Stadium in central Moscow
Saturday, many of them reclining on mats or jumping and screaming
near the stage, painted in the psychedelic style of the 1960s.
   Some fans wrapped themselves in giant American flags and formed
human pyramids.
   ``We're athletes, we need some psychological relaxation!'' a
member of the Soviet junior fencing team shouted after the pyramid
he was forming with teammates toppled.
   The concert's Soviet organizer, impressario Stas Namin, told a
news conference Friday the concert would be as important to his
generation as Woodstock was to American youth in 1969.
   ``We will show that rock is not just negative,'' he said.
``After so many years of stigmatization, this is something
positive,''
   At $16 a ticket, the concert was exorbitantly priced by Soviet
standards. However, organizers said it quickly sold out.
   ``This is the first time we've ever had such a concert,'' said
23-year-old Yelena Viklova, who came with her husband. ``There was
no way we could pass up the chance. We came to see the foreign
groups.''
   Rock promoter Alexei Kisilev said the concert represented a
major step forward from two years ago, when Soviet authorities
banned a proposed anti-drug concert because ``they said we didn't
have a drug problem, and our rock was not developed enough.''
   Soviet authorities no longer emphatically condemn rock music as
a decadent Western force, but officials still occasionally express
disapproval of rock culture.
   Few hard rock albums are put out in the Soviet Union, and groups
have generally had a hard time making arrangements for concert
halls and tours. They have, however, gained ground under President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's cultural thaw.
   Any parallel with Woodstock, the outdoor festival at a farm in
New York state that became a symbol of the 1960's, escaped many of
Saturday's fans. One 18-year-old Muscovite asked whether Woodstock
had been held in Moscow.
   Kisilev said the weekend's concert could change the Soviet rock
scene and serve as a precedent for more such events.
   One fan at the concert was U.S. ambassador Jack Matlock, who
gave an impromptu press conference wearing one of the ``Just Say
Nyet'' buttons promoters had distributed. The buttons mirrored the
U.S. anti-drug slogan ``Just Say `No.'''
   ``These contacts show we have common goals and common
problems,'' Matlock said as he posed for photos with long-haired
rockers Eric Brittingham and Fred Courey of Cinderella.
   The concert will spawn an album dedicated to rock stars who died
of overdoses. American viewers will be able to see four hours of
performances on cable television Sunday, organizers said.

'20 YEARS AFTER': WEAK WOODSTOCK VIBES 
</P>

<P>
No mud. No traffic jams. No open drug use. No babies born. Certainly no 
copulation. Plenty of bathrooms. No epithets of "pig" directed at the friendly 
policemen strolling through the crowd. Only about half of 1% of the original 
crowd figure. No superstar acts. No climbing on the speaker towers. No illusion 
of unity or purpose or agenda. And no brown acid to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
Other than that, the first day of the "20 Years After" music festival tribute 
Saturday at Cal State Dominguez Hills was almost exactly like Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
To wit: a drum solo for every billed attraction! A grilled chicken booth for 
every pothead! Dozens of tie-dyed T-shirt concessions! Men with hair! Earth 
mamas without bras! Jams without endings! Stage dialogue like: "You people are 
the music; we're just the band right now" (courtesy of Humble Pie)! 
</P>
<P>
And, best of all, emcee and counterculture class bozo Wavy Gravy, trying 
desperately to imbue this most laid-back of daze with some sense of urgency! 
"If you respect our Mother Earth, let's pick up the trash a little bit," he 
pleaded, making the scant littering of the Olympic Velodrome -- pardon us, the 
7-Eleven Olympic Velodrome (yes, the revolution will be sponsored) -- sound 
like the imminent rape of Ma World. 
</P>
<P>
Poor Wavy had a tough time relating to some of the younger, more cynical kids 
in the audience. "I'm a clown," he told them. "You're an acidhead!" some 
whippersnapper shouted back. "No, I'm a clown," he repeated, a bit of resigned 
sadness in his voice. 
</P>
<P>
If there seemed to be a noticeable lack of a Woodstock vibe Saturday among the 
relaxed crowd of fewer than 5,000, it may have been partly because that day's 
bill was devoted mostly to acts that became more famous in the '70s than in the 
'60s, like Edgar Winter and Grand Funk's Mark Farner. There was a Spinal Tap 
appeal to watching semi-reunited war horses like Iron Butterfly and Humble Pie 
go through their '70s chunk-rock paces, in incarnations that combine 
long-in-the-tooth original members with hunky new recruits who look as though 
they were conscripted at the Sports Connection. 
</P>
<P>
Electric Flag was one of the few to reunite all its original personnel (except, 
of course, the late Mike Bloomfield), in this case for the first time in 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's bill, which was scheduled to include such memorable Woodstock veterans 
as Country Joe McDonald, Melanie, Canned Heat, Richie Havens and Sha Na Na, was 
expected to draw more of the real Woodstock audience contingent. 
</P>
<P>
"The music has been fine and it's been a good day," said Dawn Souder of 
Pittsburgh, who was operating a tie-dye concession at the rear of the field 
with her husband Eric. "But it doesn't seem like a Woodstock audience. It's 
more like college kids, just kind of a thing to do on a Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the day, as chosen by the Souders and most in attendance, was 
the penultimate set by Leon Russell and Edgar Winter, in which the two keyboard 
veterans fronted a tight band and alternated lead vocals. The crowd went wild 
for Winter's monster instrumental smash, "Frankenstein," which proved still a 
whole lot of hokey fun with Russell's piano providing a rollicking, almost 
boogie-woogie undercurrent. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to that, the still golden-throated Farner also fared well with the 
audience, mixing early Grand Funk boogie (some kind of dull), mid-period Funk 
pop hits (truly "Some Kind of Wonderful") and his current "God-rock, 
Dee-troit-style" material (some kind of evangelistic). Even his awesomely 
ill-conceived ditty about what a drag it is to go to hell, "Judgment Day 
Blues," was too high-spirited to bring the crowd really dooooown, maaaaaan. 
</P>
<P>
But, after the crowd-pleasing Winter/Russell set, the climactic "Superjam" was 
a fizzle: Croaking "Roadhouse Blues" and "Back Door Man," guitarist Robby 
Krieger solved the big mystery of why he was never the Doors' lead singer, and 
of the other participants -- including Randy California and Tim Bogert -- only 
Ginger Baker (celebrating his 50th birthday) really redeemed himself, turning 
in the sole justifiable drum solo among so many that day. 
</P>
<P>
Popular verdict among the crowd, average age about 30: The 12-hour opening day 
concert seemed well-staged, well-run and, well, fun, but, according to Eric 
Moser, 27, of Mission Viejo, "I think the '60s were better in the '60s."

   Woodstock anniversary celebrants packed up
and left a muddy field here, a final reminder of the rock 'n' roll
festival 20 years ago that for many defined a generation.
   By Sunday, only about 3,500 people remained of the more than
20,000 that showed up over the last three days. The sloping alfalfa
field 110 miles northwest of New York City was soaked by rain, much
as it was in August 1969 when 400,000 attended the Woodstock Music
and Art Festival.
   Police expect most of the revelers to be gone by today.
   ``This is it,'' said Sullivan County Sheriff Joseph Wasser,
pronouncing an end to a celebration that had no official backing
from county or town authorities. Once people began arriving in large
numbers, however, the town of Bethel supplied portable toilets and
water.
   The gathering was marred when a man was stabbed in the abdomen
during a fight Saturday night.
   Joseph Basto, 39, of Newburgh, remained in critical condition
today at Harris Community General Hospital, officials said. Sullivan
County Sheriff Joseph Wasser said no arrest was made and police were
interviewing witnesses on Sunday.
   Despite that incident and a few drug-related arrests, the
anniversary like its predecessor was mostly peaceful. The first
people arrived weeks ago at the site 110 miles northwest of New York
City, which some consider hallowed ground.
   ``This isn't being cosmic or crazy, but whenever you walk on this
land when there's no people here you can feel it,'' said Will
Hoppey, one of the coordinators of the weekend's entertainment.
   ``When the wind is right and the grass is high, you can kind of
hear some of the old stuff, the groups. It's always been special,''
said Steve Bergkamp.
   Most said they were drawn by memories and the hope that some of
the original concert's performers would return. Only one did _
Melanie. She sang two songs on a makeshift stage, complementing the
entertainment provided mostly by local musicians.
   Others made it a weekend camping trip and two-day beer party.
   ``We had nothing to do for the weekend,'' said 21-year-old Evan
Lubell. ``We thought we'd get a blanket and drink some beer.''
   Cars, buses, tents, tarps and campfires dotted the hillside that
once held a mass of humanity. Medical personnel were swamped with
drug-related cases 20 years ago, but over the weekend most people
brought to a first-aid station were treated for cut feet and stubbed
toes.
   Some just had too much to drink. One man passed out face-down on
the sloping field. Someone was thoughtful enough to place a
fluorescent traffic cone next to his head.
   Some people looked as if they never left the '60s. Long hair and
beards were in the majority, and tie-dyed clothing was the uniform
of the day.
   Bergkamp, who was here in '69 and wears his silver hair to his
shoulders, tried to convince his 15-year-old son to come along.
   ``He told me, `That's corny stuff, that's old hippie stuff,'''
Bergkamp said.
   ``I said to him, `And you call me a drag!'''

   Twenty-two years after they began, 14 years
after they broke off and 20 years after they played at Woodstock,
Ten Years After is back together.
   A Chrysalis album, ``About Time,'' will be released in August,
15 years after their last one, and a seven-week fall U.S. tour is
planned. The quartet, one of the major bands to emerge from the
1960s blues revival in England, known for its fast and furious
blend of blues and medium-heavy rock, has not mellowed out.
   Guitarist-vocalist Alvin Lee has been performing, while bassist
Leo Lyons, keyboardist Chick Churchill and drummer Rick Lee have
stayed in music, producing, engineering and managing.
   In an interview with Alvin Lee and Lyons, Lee said that the band
didn't so much split up as wind down. ``We'd had some degree of
success and we'd all got nice houses and families. There was a bit
of pressure to stay at home.''
   He said that before Ten Years After split, ``Critics said I was
a fast, tasteless guitar player. That was bothering me a bit. I
shouldn't have let it, now I realize.''
   So he put together the seven-piece In Flight. ``Critics said it
was wonderful and I was playing better than ever. I missed the roar
of the crowd and the loudness after a while. That band wasn't
capable of playing heavy rock. I went back to playing from my blues
and rock roots.'' He formed Ten Years Later for a year, then Alvin
Lee and Company, which played some Ten Years After favorites.
   ``When we played together last summer, suddenly it sounded like
Ten Years After, right from the first note. It was obvious Ten
Years After had its own sound,'' Lee said.
   Reception at the festivals was so enthusiastic, Lyons said, that
the four decided to stay together. Lee and Lyons, each working with
other people, wrote 40 songs. The band recorded 15. Unable to
decide on 10, they put 11 on ``About Time.''
   In July, Ten Years After played before 80,000 in East Berlin.
   Asked about Woodstock, which took place 20 years ago on a farm
in Bethel, N.Y., on Aug. 15, 16 and 17, Lyons says, ``It's all a
bit hazy now, to be honest.''
   Still, memories come back.
   ``We were set to go on and a thunderstorm appeared,'' Lee said.
``Nobody could play for two or three hours. Sparks were flying on
the stage. I thought it outdid the music by far. God's light show.
   ``In a way it was fortunate. I went for a walk around the lake
and joined in with the audience. Nobody knew I was one of the
musicians. Half a million people can't all run under trees. They
sat there and started singing. People were playing on mud slides.
It was a wonderful thing to see that happening. Everybody was
making the best out of the ridiculous sitation. I think it brought
the best out of everybody.
   ``People were offering food and drink. It was very idealistic,
very nice. I think had it not been for the storm, probably I would
never have seen much.
   ``One of the reasons I went out was because in the backstage
area there wasn't a single cigarette. I came back with 10 marajuana
cigarettes, no regular cigarettes.''
   Lyons said, ``They said the food backstage was spiked with acid.
Whether it was true or not, it dims the appetite. The drinks were
supposed to be dodgy. In those days you never used to drink from an
open can anyhow.''
   Neither can remember what Ten Years After played, except for
``I'm Going Home,'' the high-energy rocker used in the
``Woodstock'' movie and, they think, the jazzy ``I Can't Keep From
Crying Sometimes'' and ``Love Like a Man.''
   ``I remember we did `Good Morning, Little Schoolgirl,''' Lyons
said, ``because the tuning went out because of atmospheric
conditions. We had to stop the song, apologize and retune. We did
`Going Home' as an encore.''
   ``We were the first on after the storm,'' Lee recalled.
``Everybody was worried. Sparks were still flying off the stage and
it was very wet. Somebody had to do it. Think how many of our
records would have sold if we'd been electrocuted.''
   ``It was definitely the movie that made Woodstock the memorable
thing it was,'' Lee said. ``Toronto was probably as good a festival
as Woodstock. It got forgotten.
   ``We carried on in 3,000 to 5,000-seat halls. A year later the
movie came out and we're into 20,000 seaters.''
   The night before their Woodstock appearance, Ten Years After was
in St. Louis at a jazz festival before a primarily black audience.
   ``Nina Simone went on,'' Lyons said. ``Four white hippies went
on afterwards. When we walked on stage, an uproar was starting. It
was frightening. But we played a bit of jazz and blues and we were
OK then.''
   Lee sais that in one way Woodstock was a statement against
racial prejudice. ``It was even more about the peace movement and
the Vietnam War. We thought the peace movement was very real and a
good thing to be doing. Woodstock tended to make it into a
fashionable thing. The fashion grew old and it was no longer cool
to be a hippie.''
   Lyons added, ``Woodstock was anti-establishment, a peace and
love thing, anti-violence. It was for tolerance, let people do what
they want, help one another. I think it had a lot of long-term
benefits.''
   But they didn't know what Woodstock symbolized before they got
there. Lee said, ``It was just another line on the sheet.''
   They flew from St. Louis to New York and drove until they came
to blocked roads.
   ``They took us in an Army helicopter,'' Lee said. ``I was
hanging out on a safety strap over all the audience. It was a
mind-blowing experience.''

   We stand in awe of the Woodstock generation's ability to be unceasingly fascinated by the subject of itself. 
One would have thought the saturation coverage at the time would have been enough. 
But every five years Woodstock-goers, so many of whom have become writers for elite media organs, wheel out their gilded memories and pet observations. 

   It's even more remarkable that other generations are willing to give the boomers all this attention. 
The elder generations helped create the excesses of the '60s by indulging the teen-agers of the era. 
Somehow grown-ups believed that wisdom adhered to youth, and that it was necessary to "get in touch with the young." 
Life and Look magazines opened their pages. 
The New York Times was somber and celebratory, calling Woodstock a "Phenomenon of Innocence." 
This obeisance encouraged all that talk about Revolution, the Age of Aquarius and yippiedom. 

   Today, the younger generation seems also to have become vicarious flower children. 
Woodstock nostalgia seems strongest among those who are 14. 
MTV, which caters to early adolescents, has been going bananas with "Woodstock Minutes" and the like. 
An audience of teen-age boys naturally likes the idea of running around with naked women and doing LSD while listening to Hendrix and The Who. 
Woodstock also offers a forum for vague rebelliousness. 
That's perfect for today's teens, many of whom would like to be radical, even though they don't have any definite politics. 

   Today's renegades should remember that Woodstock was about drugs, and that without drugs, it wasn't much fun. 
They should also know that all the talk about freedom and individuality at Woodstock was a lie. 
The Woodstock radicals were intolerant of individuality. 
There was a rigid dress code (jeans, no short hair). 
There was a rigid vocabulary code. 
There was a rigid thought code. 
There was peer pressure to be part of the drug scene; people who didn't do drugs often were afraid to admit it. 
There was intense peer pressure, especially on women, to be promiscuous. 
A remark in a recent Woodstock column by the New York Post's Pete Hamill captures the attitude toward women. 
He is describing what a wonderful time his male buddies had: "They joined together and bathed nude in Mr. Filippini's pond. 
They shared food and joints and girlfriends." 

   This year's cliche about Woodstock is that the kids came to Woodstock as renegades and left as a market. 
Rock is now commercial. 
Rebellion is an advertising gimmick. 
The heroes of Woodstock now ride the nostalgia circuit. 
As Wavy Gravy recently put it, "Woodstock was created for wallets." 
Mainstream commercial culture has indeed assimilated the counterculture. 
But mainstream culture had to meet it halfway. 

   What mainstream culture absorbed, at least during the '70s, was a whiff of Woodstock's utopianism, the idea that you could have drugs as well as wisdom, promiscuity as well as relationships, organization without structure, prosperity without economic competition. 
There was a spiritual greed in the desire to have all these things; the older name for it is hedonism. 

   The Woodstock radicals couldn't have been expected to realize that hedonism can damage the social fabric. 
Their elders should have told them. 
Those whom they would have listened to did not, and the social fabric was damaged. 
It's impossible to link definitively the counterculture to today's social pathologies. 
But the late '60s and early '70s brought a number of terrible trends that now haunt us. 
Drug abuse rose dramatically. 
The divorce rate went up. 
Promiscuity rose. 
Men felt less compelled to take responsibility for the children they helped create. 
Schools became more disorderly. 
The universities became refuges for frustrated radicals. 
The poverty rate, which had been dropping, went up. 

   Today, most Woodstock veterans acknowledge that the hedonism was excessive. 
But today's nostalgic treatments are still largely self-aggrandizing. 
Many celebrate Woodstock as the Last Good Time. 
It would be more appropriate if there were a hint of shame, if not over the damage that was done to the idea of individual responsibility, at least over the deaths that resulted in part from the countercultural life style. 

   Twenty-seven acts played at Woodstock. 
Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Tim Hardin, Keith Moon and Paul Butterfield subsequently died from drug overdoses. 
Bob Hite from Canned Heat later died of a drug-related heart attack and Ron McKernan of the Grateful Dead died of a liver ailment. 
Richard Manuel of The Band and Abbie Hoffman were suicides. 
Felix Pappalardi of Mountain was shot by his wife. 

   It wasn't only the famous who died. 
We were struck by a message in the current issue of Life from Pat Reul Malone, a secretary in Monroe, N.Y: "I am writing this in memory of my dear brother, James M. Berra, who went to Woodstock with three friends. 
James died at the age of 26 on February 11, 1978, from a drug overdose. 
Two others also died of drug overdoses. 
Only one person of the four survives."

Ten Years After is back together.

   ``People seem to have a high sense of drama about me. Maybe they
can enjoy my music more if they think I'm destroying myself.'' _
Janis Joplin.

   Hair bristling about her shoulders in an untidy
nest, the blowsy high priestess of the blues stumbled to the stage,
spitting and cursing. With two whiskey bottles in each hand, Janis
Joplin faced Woodstock Nation like a drunken gunslinger.
   Even through her fog, she knew she didn't like this gig. No way,
no how. Too many people. Hippies, she managed to slur to the
audience at the Woodstock festival on Aug. 16, 1969, had become a
``whole new minority.''
   Many of the performances at Woodstock were disappointing or
strange or just plain bad, but Joplin's was all three.
   ``She was tortured and crying in the microphone,'' recalls Henry
Diltz, the official Woodstock photographer, in ``Woodtock: The Oral
History,'' a recently published book by Joel Makower.
   ``I don't know really how to describe her. I mean, she really
screamed in agony in those songs. She really meant it. You could
see that in the way she contorted her face and her body and
everything.''
   John Morris, production coordinator for the concert, summed up:
``It was an awful performance.''
   Joplin had been partying strong since her arrival in the Bethel
area. She hung out with Country Joe McDonald at the Holiday Inn
dining room, and they turned it into a bar. She and Country Joe had
once been lovers, and he wrote and performed ``Janis,'' a song
about their romance.
   ``When she walked offstage ... she went into a tent and, I am
sure, shot up instantly,'' recalls Myra Friedman, Joplin's
biographer, in ``Woodstock.''
   ``So it was sad. And her behavior that weekend was indicative of
her depression and addiction and booze. The other thing was that
Janis was not real thrilled by the size of that crowd at all.
   ``She said, `I can't relate to a quarter of a million people.' ''
   Joplin had been in the business barely three years, and when she
hit Woodstock, she was somebody. A personality. A happening. A
rock-blues star who raked in $30,000 for every concert appearance.
And also by Woodstock, she'd had three years of boozing, drugging
and burning out.

   ``When I get scared and worried, I tell myself, `Janis, just
have a good time.' So I juice up real good and that's what I have.''

   A homely soul from Port Arthur, Texas, Joplin took her talent
and guts on the road and hitchhiked with her three-octave voice to
San Francisco just in time for the flowering of Haight-Ashbury.
   She strutted through clubs in North Beach, and on June 11, 1966,
the 23-year-old whiskey-soaked mama from the little Texas town
joined Big Brother and The Holding Company, the house band at San
Francisco's Avalon Ballroom, on stage.
   ``I couldn't believe it _ all that rhythm and power,'' Joplin
later recalled. ``I got stoned just feeling it, like it was the
best dope in the world. It was so sensual, so vibrant, loud, crazy.
   ``I couldn't stay still. I had never danced when I sang, but
there I was moving and jumping. I couldn't hear myself, so I sang
louder and louder. By the end, I was wild.''
   The Avalon is gone now. So is Joplin. She was found at the
Landmark Hotel in Los Angeles four years after her debut with Big
Brother, fresh needle marks in her arm. The coroner's report called
it an accidental overdose of heroin.
   From that day in June until her death Oct. 4, 1970, Joplin
grabbed a generation and held it in her thrall with her raspy,
plaintive voice, her coarse vulnerablitity and her tough
independence.
   A self-avowed beatnik _ not, she would caution, a hippie _ she
became an icon for the Woodstock generation. Hippies, she said,
believed the world could be a better place. ``Beatniks believe
things aren't going to get better ... and say to hell with it, stay
stoned and have a good time.''
   Fame came fast for Joplin. It happened the moment she screamed
her way through Josh White's ``Ball and Chain Blues'' at the
Monterey Pop Festival in June 1967.
   Joplin loved the blues, and her personal hero was Bessie Smith.
On Aug. 8, 1970, she bought a headstone for Smith's grave at the
Mount Lawn cemetery in Philadelphia. The great blues singer died in
1937 after being refused admission to a whites-only hospital.
   ``Black people have the blues because they can't have this and
they can't have that,'' Joplin once said. ``Me, I was brought up in
a middle-class family; I could have had anything. But you need
something more in your gut, man.''
   She covered many artists' songs, including Barry and Robin
Gibb's ``To Love Somebody,'' and Rodgers and Hart's ``Little Girl
Blue.'' But she also wrote songs, including ``Mercedes-Benz,'' and
with organist Gabriel Mekler, ``Kozmic Blues.''

   ``Time keeps moving on
   ``Friends, they keep moving on or turn away
   ``But I never find out why ...
   ``I keep trying to make it right to another day.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Joplin released the ``Cheap Thrills'' LP in 1968 with Big
Brother. She left the band later that year because they just
``weren't growing together anymore.''
   Then The Kozmic Blues Band was formed in 1969, and disbanded
shortly after their one LP, ``I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again
Mama!'' shot to the top of the charts.
   Joplin appeared with Big Brother at Fillmore West and Winterland
in 1969 before putting together her new group, the Full-Tilt Boogie
Band.
   At the time of her death, she was working on a new LP. ``Pearl''
was drawn from unfinished sessions and released in February 1971.
It had the plaintive ``Cry Baby'' and Kris Kristofferson's ``Bobby
McGee'' with its telling refrain: ``Freedom's just another word for
nothin' left to lose.''
   Freedom was hard for Joplin to define. She had fame, she had
talent, she had a lot of time and independence. But she was lonely.
   ``Somehow you lose all the old friends,'' she said. ``The travel
circumstances pull them away. It's hard to make new ones. When
we're not onstage, we rehearse, lay around in bed, check in and out
of motels, watch television. It really is lonely.
   ``I live for that one hour on stage. It's full of feeling. It's
more exciting than you'd expect in a lifetime. It's a rush, honey.''

   New York -- When Richie Havens sang "Freedom" at Woodstock
in 1969, little did he know that 21 years later it would
still be his biggest hit. But his Woodstock-earned reputation
has allowed him to parlay singing into his own sort of
freedom: the chance to do what he wants.
   Sitting in his company's midtown Manhattan office
recently, Havens, an imposing but friendly figure with hands
full of rings, expounded on music, a new album due out next
month, television and radio ads, environmental projects and
philosophy, always philosophy.

   On the subject of Woodstock, Havens said he wishes the
event was more understood. "Kids are discovering Woodstock
every day . . . It's been a 20-year job for me just defending
Woodstock's actuality." Folklore has it that Woodstock was
his big break, but Havens stressed that he had performed
overseas by 1969 and had done albums by then. Nevertheless,
the legendary outdoor concert certainly didn't hurt his
popularity, and he was the first performer on stage, thanks
to a twist of fate. "I went on first because there was no one
else there to go on," he said. All the other groups were
still stuck in traffic.
   Havens is a man who insists he's happy scrambling. At 49,
he claims fans of all ages and appears at jazz, rock, folk
and blues concerts. But he hasn't always enjoyed big
financial success with his records. "So many companies," he
said; "the minute I put out an album they go out of
business." But, he added, "I don't need a record to allow me
to work."
   A guitarist/singer who performs with backup guitar or
four-piece band, Havens has done 19 albums, three of them
gold (sales of more than 500,000). He has also done
soundtracks for the television program "The Wonder Years" and
the film "Coming Home." One of his latest albums, "Simple
Things" (RBI), sold more than 100,000 copies in the U.S.
after it was issued two years ago, but then RBI folded. He
reissued the record in Europe recently on his own ELO label
and it sold 40,000 copies in Italy alone.
   These are not astounding figures. Indeed, Havens's career
has been a tepid affair since the '60s, perhaps because of
the kind of music he performs. "Richie Havens is essentially
an interpretive singer in the folk genre," said Rolling
Stone's Anthony DeCurtis, the point being that interpretive
singers in the folk genre didn't ship much platinum in the
'70s and '80s. But Havens stayed alive and his number may be
coming up again, in the wake of recent successes by folky
artists such as Tracy Chapman. Mr. DeCurtis thinks it's "not
impossible for Richie Havens to stage a comeback."
   Johanan Vigoda, the Los Angeles co-producer of Havens's
upcoming album, called "Richie Havens Now," has his sights
set high for a commercial success. The album, which will
include a Jimi Hendrix song, one Cyndi Lauper tune and eight
to 10 originals, will be released by Solar Records, a soul
label distributed by CBS. That, Mr. DeCurtis remarked, should
be a boost to Havens, who has suffered in the past under
smaller labels that lacked marketing and promotion clout. "A
lot of people have heard of him, but have never heard him,"
said Mr. Vigoda, a long-time industry hand who represents
Stevie Wonder.
   Actually, millions have heard Havens without knowing it.
He sings jingles for a variety of commercials. The Woodstock
rebel's voice now hymns Amtrak, Folgers coffee, Bell
Atlantic, MasterCard, Kodak and others. He won a 1990 Clio
award for an ad he sung for the cotton industry.
   "I like Richie Havens," said Amtrak spokesman Clifford
Black. "Havens's voice gives {the ad} a signature that makes
it special."
   The jingle business can bring a volume singer in New York
as much as $10,000 under union scale in residuals over the
life of a commercial. Havens earns over scale, industry
executives say. And, added Mr. DeCurtis, Havens's jingles are
"very lucrative," noting "no one's going to have to take up a
collection for Richie Havens." Havens himself downplays the
part played by jingles in his current career: "Every jingle
house calls me up and I refuse most. It's not my business.
The ads are projects. I support my own ideas in that kind of
way."
   Havens does indeed seem to be constantly in motion, doing
concerts "all over the planet" every weekend in large and
small settings. His recent schedule included a trip to Prague
for two days for an Italian television special with Joe
Cocker and Billy Preston, then California a few days later.
He also performed at a concert honoring Nelson Mandela in New
York earlier this year.
   Time was, of course, he was on the road every day, but he
says he has cut his traveling to three or four days a week,
to leave time for a variety of projects. The North Wind
Underseas Institute on New York's City Island, which he
co-founded, developed a device to rescue whales and teaches
harbor seals to rescue people trapped underwater. He is also
starting a cable project called Weekend Future Television.
   If the new album takes off, the only thing Havens will
have to worry about is another jingle singer who imitates the
Havens voice so well that "a lot of times I thought it was
me, too."

ON CALIFORNIA: ALTAMONT: THE DAY THE MUSIC STOPPED

<P>
Altamont had its 20th anniversary last week. If you don't remember what 
happened out here on that cold night in 1969, let me help. This is the place 
where California was supposed to have its own version of Woodstock. And what a 
version it was. 
</P>
<P>
Altamont itself is not easy to find these days. You drive past the Oakland 
hills, then past Livermore and finally take a dirt road to an anonymous cow 
pasture. And there it is. The very spot where, as they say, the '60s died. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there's a lot of places where the '60s supposedly died. You could 
make claims for Kent State, maybe. Or the motel in L.A. where Janis Joplin 
mixed heroin and Southern Comfort for the last time. But Altamont is as good as 
any. 
</P>
<P>
A man named Larry Lacey owns the property now. There's an old speedway next to 
the cow pasture and Lacey is trying to convert it to a motocross track. But the 
county is giving him fits, he can't get the permits, and Lacey blames the 
history of the place. 
</P>
<P>
Altamont is haunted, he says. The local folks have not forgotten the image of 
the Hells Angels wading into the crowd of kids, swinging those pool cues. And 
they don't want any more public events out here. Not now, or ever. 
</P>
<P>
And especially, Lacey says, they don't want anything that has to do with 
motorcycles. You say motorcycle to the locals and they think Hells Angels and 
show up before the county board and say no way is this guy gonna run motocross 
at Altamont. 
</P>
<P>
Lacey shrugs. He'll try again in a few months. Maybe, someday, he says, they 
will forget. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the major events of the '60s, Altamont surely is one of the strangest. 
The notion of a concert at Altamont originated with an offer by the Rolling 
Stones to play free at a site near San Francisco. Very quickly it grew into 
something much larger, nothing less than a re-creation of what was known as 
"Woodstock Nation." 
</P>
<P>
That meant an all-day, all-night festival, a gathering of the tribes without 
any external rules. At Woodstock, hundreds of thousands of flower children had 
indulged themselves in a weekend of drugs and rock 'n' roll without disorder. 
This was seen as proof that America's young generation had grown up peaceful 
and no longer needed antiquarian law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the experience of Woodstock, the plan for Altamont was simple. The 
bands would show up, the kids would show up, and everything would turn out 
fine. Optimism was so high that a documentary film team of David and Albert 
Maysles was hired to record this carrying forward of the Aquarian Age in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
What the Maysles brothers actually captured in their film, "Gimme Shelter," was 
very different. The tribes gathered at Altamont all right, hundreds of 
thousands of kids with their bedrolls and blankets and tinkling bells. They 
came from all over and created a traffic jam 20 miles long. But before the 
music ever began, this crowd revealed that the Aquarian Age had gone on a bad 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
They arrived with eyes glassy from drugs or falling-down drunk. In the film you 
see some of them wallowing on the ground, screaming, while their brothers and 
sisters watch them as if they are crippled bugs. 
</P>
<P>
And when the music begins, so does the fighting. Inexplicably, incredibly, a 
band of Hells Angels has shown up to guard the stage. Their main weapons are 
pool cues and, when the tide of humanity surges toward the stage, the Angels go 
to work. One huge, fat man, completely naked, waddles toward the stage and is 
cut down by a swift blow to the head. He falls into the crowd and is not seen 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Soon there is blood all around the stage and the concert has descended into 
chaos. Mick Jagger stops the band in an attempt to quiet the crowd and asks, 
"What war are we fighting?" No one seems to know, and minutes later a man is 
stabbed to death by an Angel directly in front of the stage. The Stones are 
then shown choppering out of the site, squeezed into the craft like the last 
Americans leaving Saigon, and Altamont is officially done. 
</P>
<P>
That history is probably why you haven't seen many of those fond recollections 
of Altamont on its 20th anniversary. This place does not fit -- now, at least 
-- with the way we like to remember the '60s. Altamont turned ugly and violent 
and it did that without any help from the authorities. The Age of Aquarius was 
pretty much put to rest by the Aquarians themselves. 
</P>
<P>
And for just those reasons Altamont probably should not be forgotten. It has 
its own tale, and its own lessons.

U.S. HARD ROCK READY TO ROLL IN THE U.S.S.R.

<P>
The massive official name of the Saturday-Sunday rock spectacular at 
75,000-capacity Lenin Stadium here is the Moscow Music Peace Festival. 
</P>
<P>
But several of the organizers and musicians have another name for the most 
ambitious Western rock event ever staged in a country where the American-bred 
music was once denounced as bourgeois decadence. 
</P>
<P>
Their name: the Russian Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Belov, lead guitarist for the Soviet rock band Gorky Park, likes the ring 
of the term. But Belov, whose band will be on the bill with such Western acts 
as Bon Jovi, Ozzy Osbourne and Motley Crue, believes that the connection with 
Woodstock is more than simply a convenient media term on a weekend that happens 
to be the 20th anniversary of that landmark U.S. rock event. 
</P>
<P>
Belov says the Moscow concerts may come to represent the same revolutionary 
turning point in this country's rock development as those three days and nights 
on Max Yasgur's farm had on rock in Upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
Despite occasional appearances here over the last 10 years by such mainstream 
pop-rock figures as Elton John and Billy Joel, Soviet officials have been 
reluctant to open the door to Western acts, especially the rebellious, 
high-energy "bad boys" who compose much of this weekend's lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Belov, 31, said the government has also discouraged the development of Soviet 
bands by "forbidding" any group that was deemed unacceptable for any of a 
number of reasons, including themes. 
</P>
<P>
But all that has changed greatly in the age of glasnost, the guitarist said 
Thursday as his band walked in a light drizzle from the Ukrainia Hotel to the 
van for the ride to the stadium for an afternoon sound check. Not only are 
there signs of greater flexibility in allowing foreign bands to play here, but 
Soviet bands are also being given increasing freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Boris Grebenshikov, a veteran singer-songwriter who has been called the Bob 
Dylan of the Soviet Union, has recently made an album produced by British 
rocker Dave Stewart for Columbia Records and is now on a U.S. tour. 
</P>
<P>
Belov's Gorky Park, a harder-rocking group whose sound has been likened to that 
of '60s power trio Cream, is something of a Soviet supergroup, formed two years 
ago by the leading musicians from several competing bands. 
</P>
<P>
The group has spent much of the last six months in the United States and Canada 
recording an album due soon from PolyGram Records. Belov said that most Soviet 
bands are "too inexperienced" to mount a serious challenge against Western 
groups, but feels the loosening of restrictions will change that. Seeing 
Western bands this weekend should inspire more young Soviets to start dreaming 
their own rock dreams -- a difficult, nearly impossible dream for many until 
now. 
</P>
<P>
"In many ways, our music scene is just beginning because it was held back for 
so long," said Belov, who was once in a band that was declared "forbidden." But 
he added proudly: "There has been a new government attitude the last three 
years and this concert should give our bands confidence and inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
Doc McGhee, who manages several of the bands on the weekend bill including Bon 
Jovi and Motley Crue, also likes the "Russian Woodstock" image, but for 
different reasons. McGhee, 38, hopes that the shows' anti-drug message will 
erase much of the Woodstock legacy of permissive drug use. 
</P>
<P>
"The musical aspect of Woodstock was very important, but there were some sad 
consequences of the social aspects," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The message many people came away from Woodstock with was that drugs were OK, 
even a necessary part of the rock 'n' roll experience. A lot of lives have been 
lost because of that over the last 20 years, and we are trying in these 
concerts to say that drugs don't have to be part of rock. You can still have 
fun and you can still be rebellious without drugs -- and the bonus is you will 
have a better chance of living." 
</P>
<P>
McGhee said the concerts are designed to raise money for and promote the goals 
of the Make a Difference Foundation, which he started last year with a $250,000 
contribution. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to raise between $6 million and $10 million from the festival and 
such related events as a pay-per-view telecast in the United States (5 to 9 
p.m. Sunday in Southern California), a syndicated radio broadcast (on KQLZ-FM 
(100.3) in Los Angeles) and an album. Rather than simply featuring songs from 
the festival, the album will feature new studio versions of songs by artists 
who were drug casualties. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the shows were $15 to $22 -- high by local concert standards, some 
teen-age rock fans said Thursday. But, they quickly added, "there has never 
been anything like this," so it is difficult to compare. At any rate, the shows 
are sold out and dozens of fans hung around the hotel most of the day, taking 
photos of the musicians and getting autographs. 
</P>
<P>
McGhee, who has offices in Los Angeles and New York, started the Make a 
Difference Foundation last year as part of a community service provision on 
probation given him after he pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to "aiding 
and abetting" in the distribution of an estimated 40,000 pounds of marijuana in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
The manager said he has experimented with drugs but had sworn off them long 
before last year's court action and was involved in anti-drug campaigns before 
the community service order. 
</P>
<P>
Several musicians on the bill, including Jon Bon Jovi, Osbourne and Vince Neil 
of Motley Crue, have also acknowledged drug or alcohol use, but now say that it 
is in their past and warn young people about its dangers. 
</P>
<P>
The bands landed here late Wednesday after a flight on the "Magic Bus," a 
chartered 757 that left Newark, N.J., and stopped near London to pick up 
additional passengers. In keeping with the concerts' theme, no alcohol was 
served on the plane and there was no apparent drug use. 
</P>
<P>
The latter observation was confirmed -- perhaps unexpectedly -- when uniformed 
officials brought a dog on board during the 45-minute stopover in Britain. Most 
of the estimated 175 passengers were off the plane while the dog roamed the 
aisles, stopping here and there to sniff the area. 
</P>
<P>
But some members of the tour party saw the dog enter the plane and, even with 
the drug-free policy, at least one member of the group became momentarily 
anxious. 
</P>
<P>
"My first thought was, 'Oh my God, are they going to find anything?,' " the 
tour member said. "Then I realized I had flashed on the old days when a dog on 
a plane could have been a disaster. I guess times really do change." 
</P>
<P>
After a press conference at the airport in Moscow, the musicians were taken on 
a brief tour of the city, stopping only for a glimpse of giant Lenin Stadium, 
scene of many of the activities in the 1980 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
The band members -- many in their unmistakable hard-rock attire -- caused a 
flurry of interest among tourists when buses stopped to let them view the 
stadium from a scenic point near the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Various American and European tourists who had been shooting pictures of the 
landscape suddenly turned and began snapping photos of the visiting musicians. 
</P>
<P>
Because many of these bands don't have as much of a profile with the non-rock 
audience as mass-media stars like Mick Jagger or David Bowie, the tourists 
scrambled about asking members of the tour party just whom they were taking 
pictures of. 
</P>
<P>
Informed that the tall fellow with the row of tattoos was a member of Motley 
Crue, a woman from Indiana all but gasped. "I made my son throw away some of 
their posters. I couldn't stand looking at them in his room. What are they 
doing here?" 
</P>
<P>
Most surprised, however, were the local residents who happened to be in the 
area. Though punk touches -- rainbow-colored hair, an occasional Mohawk, 
leather jackets with skull and crossbones, biker boots -- can sometimes be seen 
here, seeing all these bands together was something of a culture shock. 
</P>
<P>
"Who are these people?" one local woman asked in halting English. She didn't 
show any signs of recognition of the visiting bands, but a mention of Gorky 
Park did cause a reaction. It wasn't that she had heard of the Soviet band. She 
thought the American visitor was asking how to get to the real Gorky Park, a 
combination recreation area and theater zone similar to Griffith Park in Los 
Angeles. After a brief huddle in Russian with her husband, she started pointing 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
Before getting back on the bus for the ride to the hotel, a member of the New 
Jersey-based band Skid Row band showed that even on a drug-free journey there 
is room for some old-fashioned rock tomfoolery. As he neared the bus, singer 
Sebastian Bach lowered his pants and mooned the crowd of onlookers, including a 
pair of Moscow policemen sitting in a parked squad car. 
</P>
<P>
One woman put one hand over her eyes and pulled her young daughter away. The 
Moscow police? They just seemed to shake their heads in wonder. 
</P>
<P>
How did this rambunctious bunch ever get into the Soviet Union? Driving force 
McGhee said that his stress on the anti-drug message was a key, because drug 
and alcohol abuse is a growing problem in the Soviet Union. The word peace in 
the title also made it more appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it wasn't easy. McGhee made nine trips to the Soviet Union to set it up 
and had to deal with several government agencies. He was aided by Soviet 
musician Stas Namin, whose grandfather was formerly a high Communist Party 
official. McGhee also introduced the Soviet officials to Jon Bon Jovi, the most 
diplomatic and acceptable-looking member of the rock roster. McGhee didn't 
detail the background of all the other acts, especially Ozzy Osbourne, who 
seems to attract controversy -- he has been accused of everything from 
advocating satanism to inspiring suicide to intentionally biting the head off a 
dead bat (he did do the last, but it was an accident). 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Western concert organizers speculated that the concerts may be 
another gamble by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in his continuing effort 
to sustain the glasnost spirit and renew the spirits of disaffected youth. They 
believe that Soviet officials will be watching the shows closely to see what 
happens when they ease up after repressing rock for so long. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't help but think what happens here this weekend is going to be pretty 
historic," Jon Bon Jovi said seriously. Then, referring to the weekend's 
biggest example of culture shock, he quipped, "I imagine Mr. Bush and Mr. 
Gorbachev are both going to be aware of who Ozzy Osbourne is."

<TEXT>
   Twenty years after a pop festival took
over this Dallas suburb, a beer company is sponsoring a rock fest
that shows the Woodstock era is long past.
   Organizers put together the 1969 Texas International Pop Festival
in Lewisville in seven weeks with a shoestring budget, but Miller
Brewing Co. has pushed this weekend's concert series for more than a
year with television ads and other promotions.
   At the shows, the psychedelic drugs of yesteryear will give way
to drinking arrangements for designated drivers.
   ``The whole tone of the two shows 20 years apart is remarkably
different,'' Angus Wynne, who promoted the Lewisville festival, said
Tuesday.
   Just three weeks after the Woodstock rock festival in New York
state, about 120,000 people spent three days on a field outside
Lewisville to hear the Chicago Transit Authority, Janis Joplin,
Santana, Sly and the Family Stone, B.B. King, Grand Funk Railway,
Led Zeppelin and others.
   This weekend, Miller hopes to draw 500,000 people to concerts in
six Texas cities, including performances by the Who in Houston and
Dallas. The concerts culminate a 16-month campaign by the company.
   In addition to the Who, performances by Jerry Jeff Walker, Kool
and the Gang, Natalie Cole and many others are planned in Dallas,
Houston, San Antonio, Corpus Christi, McAllen and Midland-Odessa.
   It took Wynne seven weeks and $120,000 to line up all 30 acts.
Promoters of the Lewisville festival said they lost $100,000.
   Miller hasn't disclosed its budget, but the Who grossed $1.04
million at a concert before 47,000 fans in St. Louis three weeks
ago. Miller has pledged to give at least $1 million in proceeds to
the Texas Special Olympics.
   The company and promoters have made elaborate security
arrangements. People will need wristbands to gain access to the
concerts. Designated drivers will receive different colored bands
entitling them to free soft drinks and baring them from buying beer.
   Twenty years ago, drugs were common, but the crowd behaved. There
were only 36 arrests, most for public intoxication.
   ``Psychedelics and pot, I believe, were the prevalent stimulants
of choice,'' said Sam Houston, a Denton judge who was mayor of
Lewisville from 1969 to 1973.
   When it was over, residents were surprised by the long-haired,
easygoing rock fans. Some concertgoers mowed lawns and babysat for
residents during their stay.
   ``That was part of the mind-blow thing that went on here,'' Wynne
said. ``People expected all these folks to be real nasty, and here
they were handing them flowers, just as polite as they could be. It
disarmed them totally.''

   The Protestant cry of ``no
surrender'' had echoes on the Roman Catholic side as Northern
Ireland today marked 20 years of living with British troops.
   ``We have a lot to be proud of because we have come a long way
in 20 years. Our opponents have failed to defeat us,'' Gerry Adams
told thousands of cheering supporters who marched up the Falls Road
in West Belfast on Sunday.
   Adams is president of Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the
outlawed Irish Republican Army, and he praised the IRA as ``the
real freedom fighters.''
   The republican parade came a day after a big Protestant parade
in Londonderry to mark the 300th anniversary of the breaking of the
Catholic King James II's siege of the city.

   Four congressmen plan to accompany Rep. Mickey
Leland's body back to the United States after it is retrieved from
the wreckage of a plane crash in Ethiopia, while President Bush
says he is ``truly saddened'' by ``this tragic accident.''
   The president said Sunday the Texas Democrat and his 15
companions were ``engaged in a noble cause _ trying to feed the
hungry'' when their plane crashed after taking off from Addis Ababa
for a refugee camp near the Sudan border.
   After learning that the plane was found Sunday on a remote
Ethiopian mountain 100 miles from its destination, Bush asked two
White House officials to accompany a congressional team that will
bring the bodies of Leland and eight other Americans back to the
United States.
   An administration official said a decision on when the
delegation would leave Washington would hinge on the identification
of the bodies.

   More than 190,000 telephone employees were on strike nationwide
today after workers in five Midwestern states joined the walkout.
But two regional telephone companies reached settlements to keep
83,000 workers on the job.
   About 35,000 members of the Communications Workers of America
went on strike Sunday against Chicago-based Ameritech, which serves
12.3 million customers in the Midwest.
   They joined more than 156,000 operators, installers and other
employees at three other ``Baby Bells'' _ NYNEX, Bell Atlantic, and
Pacific Telesis _ who entered the second week of their walkout
today.
   There were few signs of progress in resolving any of the

   Echoes of the Woodstock festival reverberate in
American society 20 years after the counterculture concert rocked
the nation. But when it comes to rock 'n' roll itself, most people
say the tune's gone flat.
   Eight in 10 American adults have heard of the Woodstock
festival, held Aug. 15-17, 1969, on a muddy farm in upstate New
York _ and three in 10 of them wish they had attended, a Media
General-Associated Press poll has found.
   That high level of awareness was rooted in a view of Woodstock
as more of a historical milestone than simply a show. Most regard
it as the expression of a social movement, and half of them said
that movement continues today.
   Yet the view of Woodstock was not an idealized one. While nearly
six in 10 of those who knew of the festival said it has had a
lasting effect on American society, only half of them said the
effect was a positive one.

   A total lunar eclipse will occur after sunset
in five continents on Wednesday when the full moon orbits into the
shadow of the Earth and slowly turns from a bright silver into a
copper or orange disk.
   More than a billion people in the western hemisphere will have a
chance to watch as the moon appears to be slowly nibbled away,
changing from the normal bright reflected light of a full moon into
the colorful glow of eclipse.
   The celestial show starts at 8:23 p.m. EDT over the United
States and will end about 5{ hours later. The eastern United States
will get the best viewing and Alaska will miss the eclipse
altogether.
   Visible eclipse phases will vary for the central and western
parts of the country because of the difference in sunset and
moonrise. In Los Angeles, for instance, the eclipse will have
started before the sun has set or the moon has risen. By the time
the sky has darkened completely in California, the moon will
already be in the deepest part of its eclipse. For Seattle, the
moon will still be below the horizon at mid-eclipse, but will rise
during the totality phase.

   Postal workers who tested positive for drug
use were more prone to absenteeism and getting fired, according to
a new study that could give private employers an indication of the
cost of workers' drug use.
   The analysis, one of the first studies of its kind, found that
drug users had a 41 percent higher absence rate and about a 40
percent higher rate of being fired, said researcher Jacques Normand.
   Results suggest that by spending about $1.8 million a year to
screen job applicants for drugs, the post office could avoid about
$3.1 million in costs related to absenteeism and firing in the
first year, he said. Over three years, the avoided costs would
surpass $17 million, he said.
   For private employers, the study provides hard data showing that
drug screening results are related to later job performance, he
said.

Ken Voss never saw Jimi Hendrix perform live. But he's spent the 19 years since 
the death of the counterculture guitarist keeping his music alive for later 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny when I go on tour with Hendrix material or stage concerts devoted 
to his music," Voss said recently. "We get the 14-year-olds and the 
34-year-olds, but the 24-year-olds don't seem to know who Jimi Hendrix was. 
</P>
<P>
"There's sort of a gap there -- part of a generation apparently doesn't realize 
what a force Hendrix exerted on the music performed today." 
</P>
<P>
Voss is trying to close the gap, spreading the word about the acid rocker who 
used his teeth on the guitar strings in an unsettling, feedback-laden rendition 
of the national anthem at the Woodstock music festival. 
</P>
<P>
A former music journalist, Voss, 38, is founder of the Jimi Hendrix Information 
Management Institute (JIMI), curator of a mobile museum of the star's 
memorabilia and editor of a quarterly newsletter titled "Voodoo Child," a name 
taken from a Hendrix hit. 
</P>
<P>
He's become a one-man clearinghouse of information about the Seattle-born 
Hendrix since the musician's drug-related death in Britain Sept. 18, 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"As my wife says, I'm a fan turned fanatic, I spend 12 to 20 hours a week on 
Jimi Hendrix," said Voss.

   A concert broadcast ``live'' from a tiny town
called Livestock, featuring dead rocker Jimi Hendrix and a Beatles
reunion, turned out to be a mirage.
   As many as two dozen people called state police in Hagerstown on
Saturday night and Sunday, asking about the concert in the
non-existent town, said Sgt. Kenneth Frick. Others called state
police in Cumberland.
   Baltimore radio station WGRX-FM was promoting appearances by Led
Zeppelin and the Eagles at an outdoor concert billed as attracting
huge crowds like those that appeared near Bethel, N.Y., for the
Woodstock songfest in 1969.
   And despite disclaimers and radio accounts of lines a mile long
for portable toilets and people sleeping in trees, fans wanted to
be there.
   When Tony Colter came on the air Sunday afternoon, he asked
listeners to stop calling police and said, ``Stay home. The concert
is sold out. We'll bring it to you live on WGRX.''
   And then he promised: ``Coming up at 7 o'clock, live on stage
Jimi Hendrix.''
   The concert was ``just a way of having fun over Memorial Day
weekend,'' said WGRX general manager Bill Hopkinson. ``Every famous
group in the world was there. It was a nice escape for our
listeners.''
   ``Obviously, Jimi Hendrix has been dead for a long, long time,''
Colter said. ``It's supposed to be a fantasy fun weekend.''

   Woodstock alumni John Sebastian, Bert
Sommer and Melanie will join Papa John Creech, former Byrds
guitarist Roger McGuinn and at least 10 other bands for a
``Remember Woodstock'' concert next week.
   The concert, billed as another three days of peace, love and
music in celebration of the Woodstock concert held 20 years ago, is
scheduled Aug. 17-19 in this Catskills Mountains resort town, said
promoter Elliott Schneider.
   Other acts scheduled are The Woodstock All-Star Band, Willie
Nininger and Family, Futu Futu, David Massengill, The Lisa Best
Blues Band, Cliff Eberhardt, The David Earle Johnson Latin Jazz
Band, Savoy Brown, and The Nichols Company Band, Schneider said
Friday.
   Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, Johnny Winter and the duo of Edgar Winter
and Leon Russell are also expected to play, and clown Wavey Gravy
will repeat his role as concert emcee on the first day of the
concert, the promoter said.
   State health officials approved the concert Thursday, saying
promoters had complied with all health requirements.
   Authorities rejected an earlier proposal for the concert, saying
it didn't adequately plan for congestion of traffic and people.
Promoters then limited the number of tickets to 4,000 _ a far cry
from the estimated 450,000 people who inundated the tiny town of
Bethel in August 1969.
   ``The local people are afraid that Woodstock is going to happen
all over again, so they want to make sure that it doesn't,''
Schneider said.

   Millionaire industrialist Victor Posner
has decided to build five 30-story condominium buildings on his
oceanfront property after rejecting a state offer for a land swap.
   The Florida Department of Natural Resources had been trying
since March to persuade the Miami Beach executive to swap his 13
acres of oceanfront property for 67 acres of state-owned land near
the Doral Country Club in Miami.
   The Posner tract, the city's only undeveloped oceanfront land,
is wedged between a strip of high-rises and would have made a
perfect setting for a park, state officials said.
   But Posner thought the swap would not have been profitable for
him, said his attorney, William J. Roberts.
   The Miami land, formerly owned by the Federal Aviation
Administration, is worth $8 million while Posner's land is worth
$15 million, state officials said.
   Roberts said Posner would proceed with plans to build the
condominiums with 1,500 units on the site. Posner faces one more
hurdle: state approval for two of the five buildings that would be
built near the ocean.

   San Francisco Giants pitcher Dave Dravecky,
who made a remarkable comeback from cancer surgery, also made a
pitch for a 6-year-old boy suffering from leukemia.
   Alex Vlahos of Hillsborough sat in the stands Thursday as his
friend tossed eight strong innings in his first major-league
appearance since surgery on his pitching arm 10 months ago.
   Dravecky won the game, 4-3. His pitching performance also helped
raise tens of thousands of dollars for Alex, who desperately needs
a bone marrow transplant to beat leukemia.
   Dravecky and radio station KNBR in San Francisco launched a fund
drive this week in an effort to find a bone marrow donor for Alex.
Listeners could pledge any amount on Dravecky's pitching
performance, with the money going to offset the $75 it costs to
screen each of the potential bone marrow donors.
   The response was overwhelming.
   It may be several days before KNBR knows how much was raised,
but the station said Thursday night that pledges finally came to
$500 to $1,000 for each Dravecky pitch _ totaling between $46,000
and $92,000.

   U.S. Supreme Court Justice William J.
Brennan Jr.'s name will remain on the Hudson County courthouse
despite protests by veterans who object to his opinion allowing the
burning of the American flag.
   The county Board of Freeholders on Thursday unanimously agreed
to name the 83-year-old building after Brennan, who served as
Hudson County's assignment judge from 1947 to 1951.
   Brennan authored the recent U.S. Supreme Court opinion that said
burning the American flag was protected by the Constitution.
   Ten veterans, wearing their military caps, attended the meeting,
and said they were upset over the vote.
   ``It's wrong,'' said Joseph Duffy, vice commander of American
Legion Post 52 in Jersey City. ``Anybody can burn the American flag
at this moment and nothing will be done to them.''

   Ken Voss never saw Jimi Hendrix perform live. But
he's spent the 19 years since the death of the counterculture
guitarist keeping his music alive for later generations.
   ``It's funny when I go on tour with Hendrix material or stage
concerts devoted to his music,'' Voss said recently. ``We get the
14-year-olds and the 34-year-olds, but the 24-year-olds don't seem
to know who Jimi Hendrix was.
   ``There's sort of a gap there _ part of a generation apparently
doesn't realize what a force Hendrix exerted on the music performed
today.''
   Voss is trying to close the gap, spreading the word about the
acid rocker who used his teeth on the guitar strings in an
unsettling, feedback-laden rendition of the national anthem at the
Woodstock music festival.
   A former music journalist, Voss is founder of the Jimi Hendrix
Information Management Institute (JIMI), curator of a mobile museum
of the star's memorabilia and editor of a quarterly newsletter
titled ``Voodoo Child,'' a name taken from a Hendrix hit.
   He's become a one-man clearinghouse of information about the
Seattle-born Hendrix since his drug-related death in a British
ambulance Sept. 18, 1970.
   ``As my wife says, I'm a fan turned fanatic, I spend 12 to 20
hours a week on Jimi Hendrix,'' Voss, 38, said in a telephone
interview from his Des Plaines home.
   The newsletter has about 1,500 subscribers, including one fan in
the Soviet Union who has heard only bootlegged recordings of such
Hendrix selections as ``Foxy Lady'' and ``Purple Haze.''
   A recent edition lists the latest appearances of former members
of Hendrix's various backup bands and the going prices for Hendrix
memorabilia, ranging from $4 for a mass-printed poster to $4,495
for a framed and autographed color photograph of the musician.
   ``I've also got a guitar authenticated as having been used by
Hendrix, but I don't dare exhibit that because it's worth from
$15,000 to $25,000,'' Voss said.
   ``That particular model of electric guitar from those years (a
Fender Stratocaster) would bring $2,500 in its own right now, but
the value goes up tenfold if it can be proved that Jimi touched
it.''
   Hendrix touched a lot of guitars during his last years. That's
when he would smash his instrument at the climax of a performance,
douse it with lighter fluid and leave the stage with the guitar
lying in feedback-shrieking flames.
   ``I don't know how many guitars Jimi destroyed, but I do know
that his road men would salvage the parts and try to reassemble new
guitars from the pieces,'' Voss said.
   When Voss takes his mobile museum to nightclubs, concert halls
and college campuses around the Midwest, he notices many visitors
staring at one exhibit _ a copy of Hendrix' death certificate,
which ends with the words: ``Insufficient evidence of circumstances
_ open verdict.''
   ``Too many people these days only know Hendrix as a `victim' of
drugs, they don't know about his genius as a musician,'' Voss said.
   ``The fact is that although his death was drug-related, Jimi
Hendrix did not die of an overdose. He was not even known among the
musicians of his day as a particularly heavy drug user _ although I
must admit that drug use was more widely tolerated then than it
would be now.''

   Police at the original Woodstock music
festival arrested only about 80 people, on drug charges. At the 20th
anniversary celebration, there have been four citations issued _ on
tax charges.
   Agents from the state Department of Taxation and Finance raided
vendors selling memorabilia during celebrations around Bethel on
Thursday night and accused four of not collecting the required state
sales tax, said spokesman Paul Rickard.
   The vendors were hawking T-shirts, hats, beads and other items to
10,000 people gathered on the site of 1969 festival.
   The four were charged with failure to have a certificate of
authority, a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum fine of a year in
jail and up to a $10,000 fine.
   Rickard said the state would dispatch three or four tax agents to
the site Friday night.
   ``We'll be going in for the big one tonight,'' Rickard said. ``We
anticipate that tonight, because of many more vendors coming, we'll
be giving out more citations.''

LAGUNA'S NANCY DE JONGH, WHO SANG IN SWEETWATER, RECALLS FESTIVAL'S CHAOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was 20 years ago today that Nancy Nevins de Jongh walked on stage during the 
opening hours of Woodstock and began to sing. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the epochal festival on a farm in Upstate New York has taken on 
a burnished glow in rock lore: a gathering of peaceful tribes. The high-water 
mark of the '60s counterculture. The birth of the commercial giant and 
mass-media force that rock was to become. 
</P>
<P>
For de Jongh, whose band, Sweetwater, was the third act on the bill, Woodstock 
was nothing so lofty or enduring. It was a weekend that began with no great 
expectations, unfolded with worry, discomfort and frustration, devolved into 
farce and ended with regret. Twenty years on, de Jongh and Sweetwater have 
subsided into virtual oblivion, despite having played rock's most famous show. 
</P>
<P>
But as de Jongh sat the other day in her sunlit apartment overlooking the ocean 
in Laguna Beach, relating a tale that she seldom has been called upon to tell, 
there was nothing melancholy in the recounting. In the words of those more 
famed veterans of Woodstock, the Grateful Dead, a rock 'n' roll life brings the 
prerogative of being able to sit back and smile over "what a long, strange trip 
it's been." De Jongh's story certainly qualifies. 
</P>
<P>
Today she is a tall, trim woman whose appearance combines a professional look 
with an art-colony aesthetic: conservative, pastel-colored clothing, reddish 
hair worn in a neat, fashionable cut, an array of silver rings on her hands, 
and large, geometric metal shapes dangling from her ears. 
</P>
<P>
When she walked out in front of all those people late in the afternoon of Aug. 
15, 1969, she was Nansi Nevins, a tall, willowy 19-year-old with long, brown 
hair, a flowing peasant dress and a pure, forthright voice not unlike Grace 
Slick's. With her were the seven other musicians -- all men -- who made up 
Sweetwater. 
</P>
<P>
Based in Los Angeles, Sweetwater was notable for an ethnic makeup that included 
a black, two Latinos and a Czech, and for a musical lineup that de-emphasized 
guitar while making room for a folk-jazz-rock fusion featuring cello, piano, 
conga drums and flute. 
</P>
<P>
By the summer of '69, the group was making its way eagerly in the rock world, 
having released "Sweetwater," the first of three albums it would record for 
Reprise Records in 1969-71. The album notes heralded the band as "eight 
high-octane musicians who met and jammed in the great peanut butter octopus 
that is Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
When Woodstock rolled around, Sweetwater was an established touring attraction 
that had played the Fillmores East and West and shared bills with the likes of 
the Who, the Doors and Janis Joplin. 
</P>
<P>
Nansi Nevins' trip through '60s rock had begun with coffeehouse blues shows, 
played when she was still a Glendale high school girl. Early in 1967, she 
stepped on stage with an unwieldy, 26-piece jam band called Jay Walker and the 
Pedestrians and sang "Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child." In 
concentrated form, that group coalesced as Sweetwater. 
</P>
<P>
They were taken in hand by a well-connected manager, Bruce Glattman, who got 
them a record deal and set them up with prominent bookings. "Bruce was a good 
friend of Bill Graham," de Jongh recalled. "Graham booked us in the Fillmore 
all the time -- East and West. We had a following, and we were a draw. I 
suppose that's how we got the Woodstock booking." 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater figured it was nothing to get too excited about. "We were on the 
circuit of pop festivals," she said. "They were generally just hot and sweaty, 
and the music was hard to hear. We thought it was just another festival." 
</P>
<P>
On the Friday that began Woodstock, Sweetwater checked in at the Holiday Inn in 
Liberty, N.Y., which was a staging ground and nerve center for the festival's 
performers and organizers. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like everyone was running around with their heads cut off," de Jongh 
said in a modulated, soft-textured voice. "I thought, 'Now, this is a mess.' I 
hadn't seen that before (at festivals). Usually they were a lot more 
controlled. This one was really chaotic. 
</P>
<P>
"We just plunked our bags in our rooms and threw on some clothes. It was a 
muggy, hot August day. We figured we'd jump in the car and just go out there to 
the stage. And then immediately the car stopped on this one-lane road, and 
anxiety set in. Just total gridlock." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers sent out helicopters to ferry stranded musicians to the festival. 
Having never flown in a helicopter, de Jongh had a frightful ride during which 
she thought of a harrowing plane flight Sweetwater had taken during a snowy 
tour of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
When the band arrived backstage, Richie Havens had already finished the 
festival-opening set that pretty much made his career. On stage was act number 
two: a band of Hare Krishnas chanting in a circle. 
</P>
<P>
De Jongh said: "I thought, 'What could this be? This is ridiculous.' I had a 
cynical outlook at this point. It was really crazy." 
</P>
<P>
De Jongh saw more signs of disorganization at the festival site. Amid the 
scurry, she picked up bits of discomfiting information: Organizers had lost 
control of the entrances, and people were pouring in without tickets. And a 
storm was blowing in. 
</P>
<P>
De Jongh has few distinct memories of Sweetwater's performance, other than that 
she was disappointed to find that there was a 15-foot-wide photographers' pit 
separating the stage from the audience. Sweetwater's act usually involved lots 
of close-range interaction with the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a standard 45-minute set. I remember thinking that the other band 
members seemed really far away. We were spread out (on the large stage). It 
sounds hokey, but the crowd had really good vibes. It was hard not to just 
stare back at them, because it was so big." 
</P>
<P>
Even with good vibes from the audience, de Jongh and the other members still 
had deep misgivings about what they perceived as the lack of organization 
around them. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt kind of dangerous," she said. "I felt real harassed. And you felt real 
powerless and out of control. But if I was in the crowd, I probably would have 
thought 'What a great party!' 
</P>
<P>
"It always seemed while we were there that everything was on the edge of 
falling apart. By Saturday, everything probably got calmer because they knew 
what was going on by then. But Friday, nobody knew, and it could go either 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater had already played on bills with many of the famous acts that were 
to follow, so band members thought that they would not be missing much by 
leaving right away. But leaving was not. Helicopters were coming in regularly 
at the backstage landing area, but there was a crush of people who had the same 
idea as Sweetwater and wanted to get back to the Holiday Inn. De Jongh recalled 
running repeatedly to catch a copter, only to be frustrated when someone else 
got there first. 
</P>
<P>
After several hours passed, she and three others from Sweetwater were airborne. 
But within minutes, the helicopter was dropping in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
"We started to go down," she said. "I remember thinking, 'We're gonna die!' " 
But the pilot managed to set the helicopter down at a tiny airfield somewhere 
near the festival. From there, he drove off in a car with two field attendants, 
abandoning the rockers to fend for themselves. They used a pay phone to summon 
help, but no help arrived until 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
When they got back to the Holiday Inn, de Jongh said, they found that other 
band members who had driven there from the festival had smashed the roof of 
their U-Haul truck into the hotel's entrance overhang. 
</P>
<P>
"What could happen next? We decided we'd better get out of there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The band drove to New York City, got on a plane and returned to Los Angeles. By 
the time they got back, "it was all over the news" that Woodstock had been a 
landmark event. 
</P>
<P>
De Jongh said: "We were thinking, 'Gosh, you're kidding.' We flew home, only to 
discover it was Woodstock we'd fled from. All I've heard for 20 years is what a 
great time everybody had. Sometimes I feel real sorry for myself. It was like 
missing a party." 
</P>
<P>
But missing out on history was soon the least of de Jongh's problems. In 
December, 1969, a few days after Sweetwater had played on national TV on the 
Red Skelton Show, a drunk driver rammed into her car on the Ventura Freeway. 
The wreck put her in a 10-day coma and caused permanent damage to her vocal 
chords. 
</P>
<P>
She worked to rehabilitate her voice, which took on a rougher, tawnier hue. But 
de Jongh's injury and the layoff that followed were the first in a series of 
internal strains for Sweetwater that led to its breakup in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so determined to keep going," de Jongh said. "I moved into a little room 
in Laurel Canyon with a piano, and I started to learn more about the music 
business and about writing a tune." She emerged in 1975 with a solo album for 
Tom Cat Records, a subsidiary of RCA. But the label folded, de Jongh said, and 
her career became nebulous again. 
</P>
<P>
Her last public performance was a charity show at a veterans hospital in 1977. 
"I got real, real tired and stressed out," she said, and decided to try family 
life instead. She married in 1978 and moved to Laguna Beach. By 1980, she was 
divorced and scraping for money. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no job skills," she said. "I started housecleaning for a living. I was 
real confused. I didn't know if I could make it in music again." 
</P>
<P>
De Jongh stopped telling most people about her rock 'n' roll past: "I got real 
quiet. Housecleaning is real good for your humility. Would you believe it if 
your housecleaner came in and said, 'I used to have a Mercedes and four 
albums?' It was real character-building." 
</P>
<P>
De Jongh turned to writing in her spare time, while putting herself through 
college with her earnings as a housekeeper and a tutor. Now, no longer cleaning 
house, she is working toward a master's degree in English at Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Later this month, 20 years after Woodstock, she will step onto a smaller stage 
for a performance that may ultimately prove more significant in her personal, 
long, strange trip through life. The stage will be a classroom at Cal State 
Fullerton, where de Jongh will tackle her first regular teaching assignment as 
a part-time instructor in the college's basic writing program. 
</P>
<P>
Fiction writing is her main creative outlet these days. Although she still 
keeps an upright piano in her apartment, the prominent spot with the ocean view 
belongs to a computer terminal and printer. 
</P>
<P>
De Jongh has fallen out of touch with her former Sweetwater band mates: August 
Burns, Alex Del Zoppo, Fred Herrera, Albert B. Moore, Elpidio Cobian, R.G. 
Carlyle and Alan Malarowitz. 
</P>
<P>
"I generally don't tell people about it," she said of her life as a '60s 
rocker. But with the much-publicized festival anniversary upon us, de Jongh 
decided it might be time to recall Sweetwater's comic-ironic footnote in 
Woodstock history. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been waiting for 20 years for somebody to ask me what happened," she 
said.

   Curiously, Martha Bayles seems to have developed her impressions of the Woodstock Music and Arts festival and the people who attended from the very media whose romantic reminiscences she deplores in her article, "Unliberating Memories" (Leisure and Arts, Aug. 7). 
As one who attended the three-day event, I was offended by her cynical characterizations of the festival goers as into romanticism, socialism and transcendence and find that her analysis serves only to further distort the already distorted collective memories of Woodstock. 

   Along with most of those in attendance, I went for the music. 
I purchased tickets well in advance only to find they weren't collected. 
There was nothing romantic about abandoning one's car and hiking to the festival site -- but with the complete lack of planning by festival organizers, there was no other choice. 
The only nudity I saw was in the film version issued by Warner Bros. in the 1970s. 
I brought plenty of food and was appalled when food drops were made by the National Guard. 
I couldn't wait to escape the mud, the heat and the garbage. 
In fact, none of the people with whom I went to Woodstock nor any I have met since are nostalgic for this festival or ever thought for a minute that the Woodstockians' "nation," as Ms. Bayles describes it, "was a viable alternative to 'the system' . . ." 
When the festival was over, we all returned to our jobs on Monday, glad to be home. 
The fact is, even the music wasn't that good.
