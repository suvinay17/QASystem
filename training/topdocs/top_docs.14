  [Abstract] The microbicidal effect of macrophages is 
primarily due to the functioning of lysosomes, and many 
researchers consider an elevated lysosome content and 
intensified secretion of lysosomal enzymes signs of macrophage 
activation. The participation of lysosomal enzymes in the 
intracellular killing process depends not only on their 
synthesis, however, but also on processes ensuring their contact 
with absorbed microorganisms, which is to say on the fusion of 
lysosomes with phagosomes. Evidence exists that fusion of 
lysosomes with phagosomes does not always guarantee 
intracellular killing. In particular, the reports regarding the 
relationship of the plague microbe Yersinia pestis 
with lysosomes have been contradictory. Consequently, a study 
was conducted to examine the effect of a vaccine strain of 
Yersinia pestis on the fusion of lysosomes with 
phagosomes in peritoneal and alveolar macrophages. Nonpedigree 
guinea pigs weighing 250 to 300 g each were immunized either 
subcutaneously or aerogenically with a vaccine strain of 
Yersinia pestis (10 guinea pigs were immunized in 
each case). Peritoneal and alveolar macrophages of the immunized 
animals were studied on days 1, 7, 14, and 21 after immunization 
to determine their lysosome content and the fusion of the 
lysosomes with phagosomes. The experiments established that the 
frequency of fusion of lysosomes with phagosomes in the alveolar 
macrophages was only half that in the peritoneal macrophages. 
Subcutaneous immunization stimulated the fusion of lysosomes and 
phagosomes in the peritoneal macrophages but not in the alveolar 
macrophages, whereas aerogenic vaccination stimulated the fusion 
of lysosomes with phagosomes in both types of macrophages. A 
correlation between the macrophages' ability to kill 
Yersinia pestis and the frequency of fusion of 
lysosomes with phagosomes was established. It was hypothesized 
that during endocytosis of plague microbe in unvaccinated guinea 
pigs, there occurs a suppression of the fusion of lysosomes with 
phagosomes that is much more pronounced in the case of alveolar 
macrophages than in the case of peritoneal macrophages. Figures

  [Abstract] The declining efficacy of antibiotics at the 
late stages of plague, especially at the stages of marked 
intoxication, necessitated a study of the detoxicating action of 
antibiotics and their efficacy during the marked intoxication 
stage of experimental plague. To this end, an experiment is 
carried out on 18-20 g albino mice and 250-300 g guinea pigs 
infected with plague by injecting them with a mixture of 
fraction II of the plague microbe (according to Baker) and 
plague microbe's lipopolysachharide (LPS) obtained by Westphal's 
method. The joint toxicity of these two agents was examined. The 
plague infection was experimentally induced by subcutaneous 
injection of the Yersinia pestis 231 virulent strain, 
and treatment began 48 h after infection for mice and 72 h--for 
guinea pigs. Statistical data processing involved an assessment 
of the confidence of various relative survival indices of mice 
in experimental and control groups. The detoxicating activity of 
polymyxin B relative to the plague microbe toxin and the 
efficacy of a combination of antibiotics in starting treatment 
of experimental plague in albino mice 48 h after infection are 
summarized. The study shows that polymyxin has a detoxicating 
effect and facilitates albino mice survival at the early plague 
intoxication stage; this is attributed to the ability of 
polymyxin B to inhibit the biological activity of 
lipopolysachharide in the external membrane of gram-negative 
bacteria. The use of a single antibiotic, such as amikacin, 
rifampicin, doxycyclin, or cefotaxime, which are efficient at 
the early treatment against the background of polymyxin therapy 
at the stage of marked infection generalization increases the 
animal survivability compared to the individual use of each 
preparation. As for the guinea pigs at the same stage of 
disease, a certain therapeutic effect is observed under the 
combined use of gentamycin with trenthal or dipromonium whereby 
the life span and survival of individual animals increase. The 
conclusion is drawn that the proposed treatment is promising for 
comprehensive treatment of generalized plague infection and is 
capable of increasing the therapy efficacy. Tables 2; references

<LEADPARA>  GUINEA PIGS, it turns out, may not make good guinea pigs.;    That's because
the gentle, furry pets and accommodating lab animals are not what you, or
scientists the world over, thought they were -- rodents.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  GUINEA PIGS FAIL THE RODENT TEST  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     A new research study that analyzed the animal's genetic code shows that it
is not even closely related to rodents such as mice, rats and squirrels, as
was previously thought.;    One important consequence is that the guinea pig
-- whose name is synonymous with scientific experimentation -- may actually be
a lousy animal for the testing of drugs and medicines.;    These are the
conclusions of a team of scientists whose findings were reported in Thursday's
issue of the science journal Nature.;    They believe that guinea pigs and
possibly porcupines belong to a whole new category of mammals -- alongside
such orders as carnivores, primates and lagomorphs (rabbits and hares).;   
"Undoubtedly, these findings will be controversial," said Winston A. Hide, a
postdoctoral fellow at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, who is a
co-author of the study. "A lot of preconceptions are being shaken. . . . Every
single (biology) textbook on the planet may have to be rewritten.";    The
authors' findings are based on the sophisticated new techniques of molecular
biology, which can analyze the billions of chemical subunits that make up the
genetic codes in the DNA of all plants and animals. These techniques are
causing scientists worldwide to rethink how animals and plants evolved, and
stirring up scientific debate on how they should be classified.;    But not
all researchers are convinced.;    "Yes, molecular biology offers powerful new
tools that will help us redraw the lines separating different plants and
animals," said Alfred Gardner, a wildlife biologist at the Smithsonian
Institution.;    "But do guinea pigs belong in a new order of mammals? I don't
think so," said Gardner, saying he needed more evidence to be convinced.;   
In the study, the scientists used a computer to analyze genetic data about the
proteins in more than 30 animals, including chickens, kangaroos, ostriches,
hamsters, camels, giraffes, cows, pigs, opossums, mice, rats, humans and
guinea pigs.;    Based on those comparisons, they concluded that guinea pigs
evolved separately, and far earlier, than rodents did.;    The other
co-authors of the paper are Wen-Hsiung Li, of the University of Texas at
Houston, and Dan Graur, of Tel Aviv University in Israel.;    TRADITIONALLY,
scientists who work in the field of taxonomy, the classification of living
things, have relied on the study of bones, muscles and other parts of the
anatomy.;    But in recent years, as molecular biology has developed,
scientists have learned how to study the genetic blueprints that direct the
development of plants and animals. By comparing the similarities and
differences between these codes, they have been able to learn more about how
the different species evolved, and propose different classifications.;   
"These studies are having a major impact on taxonomy," said Hide, who did his
graduate studies at Temple University from 1984 to 1990. "Scientific
classifications dating back to Linnaeus may have to be overturned.";   
Carolus Linnaeus, a Swedish botanist, developed the method of naming plants
and animals in the 18th century. Many of his principles are still used today.;
   Hide said scientists have known for many years that guinea pigs have
different physiologies than mice, rats and other rodents, which are
characterized by sharp, gnawing teeth. "Their bodies process fats differently.
They lack the ability to synthesize vitamin C, which rats can do," he said.;  
 Because guinea pigs evolved far earlier than either rodents or humans, and
have different physiologies, Hide said, their use as models for testing
medications may be more limited than previously thought.;    "In fact, I think
they may be terrible animals for this purpose. Their physiology is weird.
Their genetic code is very different. We're saying, 'Hey guys, this is not
such a good animal to be doing experiments on after all.' ";    Guinea pigs,
which are in no way related to pigs, are native to South America and were
domesticated by the Inca civilization of Peru in the 1500s. They are a common
household pet because they are docile and clean.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   A vaccine that makes the body attack sperm was
100 percent effective in tests with female and male guinea pigs,
the first demonstration of contraception without fail from a
vaccine, scientists reported today.
   The study, which also found the effects of the vaccination
temporary, raises the prospect that a similar vaccine might work in
women and men.
   But ``there are many things about it that would have to be
changed or improved to make it a useful method for either
agricultural animals or humans,'' said researcher Paul Primakoff.
   The vaccine is designed to prevent fertilization, which may make
it more widely acceptable than another vaccine already in human
testing that stops development of the embryo, other scientists said.
   Primakoff and colleagues at the University of Connecticut Health
Center in Farmington, Conn., reported the experiment in the British
journal Nature.
   None of the 25 female guinea pigs that were vaccinated before
mating had litters, nor did the mates of the six immunized male
guinea pigs. Animals that received sham immunizations for
comparison purposes remained fertile.
   Eleven of 24 females tested had regained fertility by nine to 11
months after the immunization, and all four of the longest-studied
group had delivered litters by 15 months. Among males, four of six
had regained fertility by seven months after the immunization.
   In a telephone interview, Primakoff said his team has since
produced contraception in 17 other male guinea pigs.
   The vaccine is designed to make the body's disease-fighting
immune system attack a protein found in guinea pig sperm. The
details of just how that blocks fertility in guinea pigs are not
known, Primakoff said.
   But immune system proteins called antibodies, taken from the
immunized females, prevented sperm from binding normally to guinea
pig eggs in the test tube. That suggests the vaccine blocks
fertilization within vaccinated females, Primakoff said.
   In males, the vaccination triggered an invasion of the testicle
by immune system cells. That is ``not something you would want
going on in your body'' because of the potential for long-term
harm, Primakoff said.
   So to produce a human male vaccine, researchers would have to
find a way to trigger just the antibodies without the rest of an
immune system reaction, he said.
   No evidence indicates the guinea pig vaccine would work in
humans, nor is there any assurance that human sperm contains a
suitable protein target for a similar vaccine, he said.
   Richard Bronson, director of the reproductive endocrinology
division at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, called
the research ``very encouraging.''
   It suggests research into a sperm-targeting vaccine is ``heading
in the right direction,'' he said.
   The 100 percent contraception rate makes the results ``really
terrific,'' said Nancy Alexander, director of applied fundamental
research for the Contraceptive Research and Development Program at
the Jones Institute of Reproductive Medicine in Norfolk, Va.
   A vaccine that prevents fertilization might avoid religious and
cultural implications of another kind of vaccine that has already
begun preliminary human testing, she said.
   That vaccine blocks the action of a hormone called human
chorionic gonadotropin. Scientists are unsure whether the blocking
prevents the blastocyst, a clump of cells that grows from a
fertilized egg, from implanting itself in the uterus wall, or
whether it prevents further development soon after implantion.
   Implantation normally takes place six or seven days after the
egg is fertilized.
   Researchers overseas have shown the hormone-blocking vaccine is
safe in humans and are preparing to start testing its
effectiveness, Alexander said.

   A Utah congressman appealed to a House panel
Wednesday to approve a $100 million trust fund to pay damages to
``forgotten guinea pigs'' of the West whose health was destroyed by
radiation from government uranium mines and atomic bomb tests.
   Rep. Wayne Owens, D-Utah, said several victims or their
survivors won federal suits in which the judges concluded the
federal government was negligent, only to have the decisions
overturned on appeal because of a law that protects the government
from being sued except in the rarest of instances.
   Republican Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, who is sponsoring the
legislation in the Senate, said the cost ``will amount to only a
fraction of what the downwinders and miners have spent because of
the problems that the government his caused.''
   Hatch and others have been pushing similar legislation for years
without success.
   Proponents are more hopeful now in the wake of recent
legislation setting up a trust fund for Japanese people locked in
U.S. camps during World War II and another bill providing
assistance to U.S. servicemen exposed to the harmful effects of
atomic radiation while in the line of duty.
   Hatch reminded the House Judiciary subcommittee on
administrative law and governmental relations that Senate approval
in 1985 of a compact with the governments of Micronesia included a
trust fund for victims of fallout from atomic testing in the
Pacific Ocean.
   If the government is willing to provide such treatment for
foreign residents, how can it do less for its own citizens, Hatch
asked.
   Referred to as ``downwinders,'' the people exposed to fallout
from open air nuclear testing in Nevada in the 1950s live mainly in
southern Nevada, southern Utah and northwestern Airzona.
   ``Even more appalling than the plight faced by the downwinders,
if such is possible, is the case of those who mined uranium in
Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and Utah from 1947 to 1961,'' said
Hatch. ``Even though the government had adequate warning of the
hazards involved, these miners, most of whom were native Americans,
were sent into inadequately ventilated mines with virtually no
instruction regarding the dangers of ionizing radiation.''
   Owens referred to the mining and testing as ``an unnoticed part
of this nation's nuclear Cold War with the Soviets'' and said
earlier congressional investigations concluded that ``the residents
of this region were used as `guinea pigs' in a deadly experiment.''
   He noted that the House Commerce subcommittee on oversight and
investigations recommented a decade ago that ``sufficient evidence
exists for the federal government to accept at least compassionate
responsibility.''
   ``Then, after wringing its hands over the suffering of these
`forgotten guinea pigs,' Congress unfortunately forgot again,''
said Owens, who told the subcommittee his brother-in-law, a former
uranium miner, recently died of lung cancer.
   Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Gerson, head of the Justice
Department's civil division, said the administration opposes the
legislation ``because it would dramatically change current law by
making the United States subject to unprecedented liability for
implementing policy decisions and functions.''

   Sen. Orrin Hatch says if the federal
government can give money to residents of Pacific islands affected
by atomic testing, there's no good reason not to do the same for
residents of western states.
   Hatch and Rep. Wayne Owens, both of Utah, called Wednesday for a
House panel to set up a $100 million trust fund for what Owens
called the nation's ``forgotten guinea pigs'' in the development of
nuclear weapons.
   The Republican senator and Democratic congressman have teamed up
on similar measures before but have never been able to get
legislation out of committee.
   They are more optimistic this year, pointing out Congress
created a special fund for Japanese people who were locked in U.S.
camps during World War II and also voted assistance for veterans
exposed to atomic radiation while on duty.
   Several civilians exposed to fallout from the Nevada Test Site
during the 1950s have won judgments in federal courts only to have
them overturned on appeal because of a federal law that generally
shields the government from lawsuits.
   The House Judiciary subcommittee on administrative law and
government relations is considering broader legislation that would
expand the right to sue the federal government if negligence can be
proved.
   But there was no indication how soon the panel will act on that
or the one-purpose, Hatch-Owens bill.
   Hatch said the Senate made history in 1985 by acknowledging in
its approval of the Marshall Island Compact that atomic testing
fallout damaged the health of Pacific islanders and by authorizing
payments for the residents.
   Hatch said he fell eight votes short at the time of winning
similar treatment for residents of the United States.
   Called ``downwinders,'' the people exposed to fallout from open
air nuclear testing in Nevada in the 1950s live mainly in southern
Nevada, southern Utah and northwestern Arizona.
   Hatch said the trust fund he is proposing would ``amount to only
a fraction of what the downwinders and miners have spent because of
the problems that the government has caused.''
   He said the cases of those who mined uranium in Colorado, New
Mexico, Arizona and Utah from 1947 to 1961 may be even more
appalling.
   ``Even though the government had adequate warning of the hazards
involved, these miners, most of whom were native Americans, were
sent into inadequately ventilated mines with virtually no
instruction regarding the dangers of ionizing radiation,'' he said.
   Owens called the mining and testing as ``an unnoticed part of
this nation's nuclear Cold War with the Soviets.''
   ``The residents of this region were used as `guinea pigs' in a
deadly experiment,'' he said.
   He noted a House subcommittee concluded a decade ago
``sufficient evidence exists for the federal government to accept

   ``Then, after wringing its hands over the suffering of these

Owens, who said his brother-in-law, a former uranium miner,

  [Abstract] Capsaicin is a naturally occurring 
physiologically active substance that has until recently 
remained little studied despite the fact that it is used widely 
in everyday life and in medical practice. Studies conducted in 
the past few years have demonstrated that capsaicin reacts with 
the C-fibers of the autonomic nervous system, facilitates the 
removal of substance P from the latter, and thereby lowers a 
patient's sensitivity to pain. Capsaicin has also been shown to 
affect the respiratory and cardiovascular systems and smooth 
musculature. Toxicity studies have established that capsaicin 
has a DL[.sub]50[/] of 1.1 to 120 mg/kg, guinea pigs being 
most sensitive to it (DL[.sub]50[/] = 1.1 mg/kg) and hamsters 
being least sensitive to it (DL[.sub]50[/] &gt;  120 mg/kg). Its 
toxicity is highest when injected intravenously [IV] and lower 
when administered rectally or applied cutaneously. Three minutes 
after IV injection into Sprague-Dawley rats, capsaicin is 
already detectable in their brain, spinal cord, and liver in 
amounts several times higher than in their blood. When injected 
subcutaneously, capsaicin reaches its maximum levels in the 
tissues and blood after 5 hours. After 48 hours, rats that had 
received capsaicin in doses of 20 mg/kg had excreted 8.7 percent 
unchanged and in the form of eight metabolites. Capsaicin has a 
lasting antinociceptive effect. When administered in an aerosol 
(2-5 æmol/l), capsaicin stopped coughing in test subjects 
without altering the depth or frequency of respiration. When 
used as an inhalant, it has been shown to increase the minute 
volume and average frequency of respiration. In anesthetized 
dogs, capsaicin injected IV in doses of 10 to 300 mg/kg has 
induced a short-term increase in mean arterial pressure followed 
by a long-term decrease. Its hypotensive effect in dogs and 
rabbits has been attributed to cholinergic mechanisms but not 
linked to any effect on the heart. Capsaicin has also induced 
relaxation of an isolated band of porcine coronary artery that 
was accompanied by hyperpolarization of the smooth muscle only 
in the presence of endothelium and has had various effects on 
isolated segments of guinea pig ileum depending on the 
concentration in which it was administered. Capsaicin's main 
targets are the central and peripheral nervous systems. When 
injected intraperitoneally into guinea pigs in doses of 0.125 to 
0.15 mg, it attenuates behavioral responses to irritants in 
areas such as the eye and nose. Practical application of 
capsaicin is based on its predominant reaction with the 
peripheral receptors of formations of sensory nerves. It is 
highly selective, and it maintains its stimulating properties 
when diluted to concentrations as low as 1:11,000,000.

A QUARTER guinea-pig and chips is an increasingly common menu item in the
small towns of the high Peruvian Andes. Nothing remarkable in the protein
source - local inhabitants have been eating guinea-pig for thousands of
years. A whole animal has traditionally been the portion, as the creatures
tend to be small.
Now a well-researched programme of genetic improvement plus an imaginative
initiative by international aid agency Care are starting to bear fruit - and
provide much-needed animal protein in the Andean diet.
'Guinea-pig meat is excellent food value,' says Mr Jose Sarria, head of the
research programme at Lima's national agrarian university of La Molina.
'It's higher in protein and lower in fat than beef, pork, lamb or chicken.'
The Andean farmers and their families, who are primarily responsible for the
millions of guinea-pigs that Peruvians consume each year, know it's
delicious.
Even though the guinea-pig, or 'cuy' as it is most commonly known in Peru,
is first cousin to the rat it has a different number of chromosomes. Mating
between the species is impossible, experts assure the squeamish.
Cuyes are traditionally to be found scurrying about the dirt floors of
Andean kitchens, eating whatever scraps of food and vegetable peelings come
their way. Always handy, they get plucked and thrown into the pot whenever
there is reason for a party - Andean weddings, local saints' days and visits
from relatives are never celebrated without cuy.
But this type of small animal management, or mismanagement, has caused
genetic deterioration in a species native to the Andes. When animals of all
ages and sizes and both sexes run free, in-breeding swiftly becomes a
problem, which the exceptionally short biological cycle of the cuy
exacerbates. Females can come on heat as early as 25 days old, but they will
produce small and often weak litters that their own underdeveloped bodies
are incapable of feeding adequately.
Standard Andean grasses, maize stalks or potato peelings, while convenient,
do not produce what the locals term 'the giant cuy'. Mr Sarria says the
improved guinea-pig needs a diet of 18 per cent protein. Even alfalfa
provides only a small percentage of that.
Finally, traditional management means that a process of inverse selection
occurs. For celebrations since the times of the Incas, the best animals have
found their way to the table, while the punier are left to continue the
race.
In the mountains of the Callejon de Huaylas, known as 'Peru's Switzerland'
for its eternally snow-covered, 22,000 ft peaks, Care has been sponsoring a
cuy breeding programme in conjunction with the regional government since
1989. It is estimated that 45 per cent of local children in the beautiful
but poor valley are chronically under-nourished.
So far nine local communities are proud owners of a model breeding shed
where 400 animals mate, are properly fed, weighed and watched over. Another
70 communities benefit from technical advice at an individual family level.
Most of the community projects are run by the 'mothers' clubs' of village
women. In the small town of Tingua, a countrywoman shows off her animals.
'See, this one we'll keep for breeding. She has short hair and dark, bright
eyes. This one here does not look so good - it will be sold for the pot.'
The animals are kept in separate concrete-built 'pens' holding about ten,
where they can be better monitored, selected for breeding and quickly
isolated if they fall sick. A prize specimen tips the scales at 1.75 kg, the
weight of a good-sized chicken.
In Cruz de Mayo, another Andean village, high above Caraz, lloking after the
community's rotating stock of 400 cuyes is a new job for a villager who
admits that he is now 'useless for hard labour in the fields'.
He is proud to pass on his new-found expertise, showing how young animals
are sexed and separated at one month old. Ten females are put to one male,
'but not until they are 90 days old', he explains. 'That way they make
better, fitter babies.'
Eighty villagers share management of the Cruz de Mayo 'cuy-house'. There is
a rota for cleaning out the pens, for cutting and transporting the alfalfa
or maize stalks. A separate room contains a small stock of veterinary
products for treatment of occasional skin diseases or parasites.
'A little bit of technical help makes a huge difference,' says Tulio
Triveno, Care's local director as he distributes simple illustrated leaflets
explaining the basics of cuy care. 'But the cuy is a hardy beast, much more
resistant to the tough climate, the altitude and infections than the
rabbit.'
There's still a long way to go. Ninety-nine per cent of Peru's estimated 22m
guinea-pigs are still reared in the bad old ways. Mr Sarria's goal is to
raise production to a minimum of eight healthy young per female per year.
And it is just possible that this traditional Andean staple could become a
delicacy for jaded palates abroad. The cuy is already kept for food in
several North African countries and the Agrarian University has recently
dispatched samples of the 'improved' animal to Cuba and parts of the US that
have large colonies of Peruvian exiles.
'We think that the guinea-pig, kept in most developed countries for
laboratory experiments, is a real food option in many countries of the
world,' says Mr Sarria.

   In "Use of Staff Guinea Pigs Causes Squeals About Safety
of Firms' Product Testing" (Dec. 31), you describe a
McDonnell Douglas Corp. test in which numerous people were
injured in an airline-evacuation simulation. Your
prescription: computer simulations.
   The real conclusion is that airplanes are inherently
unsafe, even in a survivable crash, because too many people
are crammed into a space without adequate exit capabilities.

<TEXT>
   Those of us who travel on the nation's commercial airlines
are totally at their mercy -- and we have precious little
clout. A test in which real people are injured is far more
dramatic and difficult to conceal (or rig) than a computer
simulation. Instead of decrying the use of human "guinea
pigs," you should be decrying the airlines' disregard for
their passengers' safety.

<HEAD>Experimental Vaccine Protects Lab Animals Against Legionnaires' Disease</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two experimental vaccines protected lab animals
against a lethal dose of the bacteria that cause Legionnaires'
disease, raising hopes for a vaccine to protect humans, a researcher
says.
   Between 600 and 1,000 cases of Legionnaires' disease are reported
to the federal Centers for Disease Control each year. Estimates of
the actual number of cases range as high as 100,000 a year, said the
vaccine's developer, Dr. Marcus Horwitz of the University of
California, Los Angeles.
   ``It's clearly a major problem in hospitals,'' Horwitz said
Tuesday at a meeting of the American Society for Microbiology.
``It's a major cause of death from hospital-acquired pneumonia.''
   The first vaccine Horwitz developed consisted of a weakened,
mutant strain of the bacteria Legionella pneumophila, which causes
the deadly disease.
   Then Horwitz developed a vaccine consisting of a single chemical
from the virus. The single-molecule vaccine protected 21 of 26
guinea pigs from a lethal dose of Legionella bacteria.
   None of 26 unvaccinated guinea pigs survived after the same dose,
Horwitz said.
   Guinea pigs were used because they develop a disease similar to
Legionnaires' disease in humans, he said.
   Dr. Robert Breiman, a Legionnaires' disease expert at the CDC,
said the vaccine, if it ultimately proves successful in humans,
could be especially useful for the transplant recipients, cancer
patients, the elderly and people taking steroids.
   They all have weakened immune systems and are especially
susceptible to Legionnaires' disease, he said.
   Horwitz and his colleagues ``have very nice results,'' Breiman
said. The vaccines ``look like they protect animals very nicely
against Legionella.''
   ``It remains to be seen whether this sort of vaccine would
protect these people'' who are especially at risk, said Breiman, who
worked with Horwitz before going to the CDC. ``It's a long way to a
vaccine in humans.''
   Horwitz said it would be at least two or three years before he
was ready for a trial of the vaccine in humans.
   He said he was surprised that ``you can immunize an animal with a
single molecule.'' Such a vaccine should be safer, easier to use and
cheaper than the mutant bacteria vaccine.
   The molecule is called the major secretory protein, and its
function in Legionella infection is not understood, Horwitz said.
   He does have a good theory of how the vaccine works, however.
Legionella bacteria infect certain white blood cells called
monocytes and then hide inside where the body's immune system can't
find them.
   The immune system, primed by the vaccine, secretes substances
that change the monocytes in such a way that they lose most of their
ability to absorb iron as they normally do.
   Legionella bacteria depend on iron, and when they don't get it,
they stop growing.
   The next step in the research will be to show that the vaccine
can protect animals against various strains of Legionella
pneumophila, and against other species of Legionella.
   Legionella pneumophila is responsible for 90 percent of
Legionnaires' disease, but five or six other species of Legionella
also cause disease, Horwitz said.
   Another question to be answered is how long the immunity induced
by the vaccine will continue to protect against disease, he said.
   Legionnaires' disease takes its name from its first known
outbreak _ at the Pennsylvania American Legion convention in
Philadelphia in July 1976.

   Peter Watson resisted war when it was
neither chic nor acceptable. He thought World War II was a terrible
mistake and became a conscientious objector.
   Now, he's attacking war by financing peace.
   The 64-year-old real estate investor has pledged $1 million to
the University of Rochester in New York to establish a center to
study peace.
   ``We have three good academies teaching people how to wage
war,'' Watson said, referring to West Point, Annapolis and the Air
Force Academy. ``We need to have institutions of higher learning
teaching people how to wage peace.''
   America was already at war when Watson entered Harvard
University as a freshman. He saw many of his classmates and his two
brothers go off to fight, but he simply believed war was
meaningless and wrong.
   So, after being drafted in 1942, he opted for alternative
service. He eventually volunteered for the ``guinea pig unit,'' a
group of conscientious objectors who were used to test the body's
tolerance to high altitude, extreme temperature and different
proteins.
   One of his duties was to test the limits of his body under
desertlike conditions. He rode a stationary bicycle in a room
heated to a sweltering 120 to 130 degrees for eight hours without
water. The salt water solution he was given at the end of the day
was ``delicious.''
   Watson said his guinea pig years were fulfilling, so he thinks
it only fitting to give the money to the Rochester, N.Y.,
university _ the site of the experiments.
   Dr. Carl Honig, a researcher at the University of Rochester,
said the work in respiratory study saved the lives of soldiers
stationed in the Aleutian Islands and North Africa, and thousands
of others since then.
   ``Those studies have prolonged the life and added to comfort of
patients with any type of respiratory disease, whether it's
emphysema, or asthma or lung cancer,'' Honig said.
   No one died during any of the Rochester experiments, but at
least two men perished during ``guinea pig'' exercises elsewhere,
Watson said.
   ``It's important for every generation to have some (people),
however visionary and impractical at the time, stand for something,
stand for the abolition of war,'' Honig said. ``Those people did it
at great risk.''
   Watson got a medical discharge after developing ulcers during
nutritional experiments aimed at trying to avert starvation
following the war. He went back to Harvard's medical school for two
years before dropping out to volunteer for more research, and to
conduct research himself.
   In 1962, seeing an opportunity, he moved to Vermont and invested
in real estate when land could be had for $1 an acre.
   But after suffering a stroke in 1979, Watson found himself with
time on his hands. He sought information on the results of his
unit's wartime research and eventually talked to Honig about a
center that could unite various academic disciplines _ including
history, philosophy and political science _ in the study of peace.
   ``Peace is breaking out all over the world,'' he said. ``Let's
nudge it along a little bit.''
   Rochester officials proposed the Peter D. Watson Center for The
Study of International Peace and Cooperation and agreed to raise $5
million for it.
   Watson seems more the successful capitalist than the long-haired
peacenik. A prominent stained-glass window with an American eagle
motif hangs beside the balcony of his home overlooking Greensboro's
Caspian Lake, and he keeps rifles that have been in a family that
has gone to war since the American Revolution.
   But Watson said the window is not there to show patriotism. He
just liked the design. And the weapons, well, they seem to serve as
reminders of a history that need not be repeated.
   ``Peace has to be made reputable and war disreputable,'' Watson
said.

<HEAD>Chemical Drums Aboard Italy's Ship Of Poison Are Damaged</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENOA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some drums of chemical waste aboard a
freighter dubbed the ``ship of poison'' are damaged, and guinea
pigs will be used to see if any dangerous substance is leaking, the
port commissioner said Tuesday.
   More than 2,200 tons of unidentified wastes from Italian
chemical companies are in about 12,000 drums aboard the freighter
Zanoobia, which docked in Genoa on Sunday after spending more than
a month anchored off the coast of Carrara.
   The wastes were originally shipped from Italy 15 months ago but
were rejected by four countries before officials in Genoa agreed to
let them unload.
   Genoa port commissioner Giuseppe Francese said the guinea pigs
will be lowered into the ship's holds to see if they suffer any
toxic effects.
   Francesco Rizzuto, a lawyer for the ship's owner, Tabalo
Shipping, said a chemical analysis of the wastes must be completed
before the unloading begins.
   Francese said the entire process, including unloading, transport
and incineration of the wastes, could take two months.
   The Zanoobia is the last of three freighters used to ship the
wastes to ports in Djibouti, Venezuela, Syria, Greece and then back
to Italy.
   ``We could have vetoed docking of the ship in an Italian port,
but it looked like an unfair decision since the waste had
originated from Italy,'' Francese said.
   Lawyers for Tabalo Shipping say two people have died, possibly
after being contaminated by the wastes. A boy in Venezuela died
after playing near the cargo, and a Zanoobia crewman died during
the voyage to Italy from Greece.
   Five crewmen were hospitalized last month with symptoms possibly
caused by exposure to the wastes. Three others were treated and
released Monday.
   Dock workers walked off the job Monday to protest the smell and
fumes spreading from the Zanoobia, but they returned to work
Tuesday because the ship was moved to a more isolated part of the
port.
   The wastes originally were shipped from the Tuscan port of
Marina di Carrara in February 1987.
   Rizzuto said a group of Italian chemical companies paid the
Milan-based company Jelly Wax about 40 cents a pound to dispose of
the waste. He said the company instead shipped it out of the
country.
   The first ship took it to Djibouti, then to Venezuela, where it
was unloaded. After the boy died, the government ordered the wastes
shipped out of the country.
   It was loaded on a second ship bound for Syria, where it was
transferred to the Zanoobia. That ship made one stop in Greece
before it took the wastes back to Carrara.

   A World War II conscientious objector who
spent the war in a ``human guinea pig unit'' aiding medical
research plans to donate $1 million to further the study of peace.
   Peter D. Watson, 64, a retired Vermont real estate broker, wants
the money to be used to establish a center for peace studies at the
University of Rochester, at whose medical school he volunteered
during the war.
   ``We have plenty of places like West Point and Annapolis where
war is promoted,'' Watson told the Democrat and Chronicle of
Rochester on Monday. ``We need a place where we can work on
eliminating war.''
   University spokesman Robert Kraus said an announcement about how
the donation would be used would be made in a few weeks.
   The center, he said, would be used mainly for research and could
mean new courses for undergraduates. Conferences and invitations to
visiting scholars are also possible.
   The university must raise an additional $5 million from
foundations or other sources to receive the full $1 million
donation.
   Watson's experiences in Civilian Public Service Unit 115-R (for
Rochester) were on his mind this Memorial Day weekend as he played
host to a group of fellow veterans from the volunteer human
experimentation program.
   Seven of the 15 living members of the guinea pig unit gathered
at Watson's home in Greensboro, Vt., where he said they they
reminisced about and reaffirmed their decision to serve both
country and conscience through medical research.

<TEXT>
   A young man whose body was used for a
medical experiment while he was in a deep coma died on Sunday,
family members said.
   The revelation last Tuesday that an anesthesiologist had
performed an experiment on Pacal Louette, 24, considered at the
time clinically dead, touched off a scandal about the ethics of
using human beings as guinea pigs.
   Louette, injured in an auto accident earlier this year, died
Sunday morning at Amiens North Hospital, his father-in-law, Emile
Collard, said.
   It was not immediately known whether there was a link between
the death and the experiment in which Dr. Alain Milhaud of the
Regional Hospital Center of Amiens placed Louette on a sabotaged
medical device.
   Milhaud was trying to see if the effects would match those of a
similar case which has resulted in a trial of three doctors.
   Last Wednesday, Health Minister Michele Barzach suspended
Milhaud from his duties as chief anesthesiologist at the hospital
center.
   President Francois Mitterrand condemned such medical exercises,
saying neither scientific progress nor the search for truth could
justify them.
   Milhaud had told his superiors about the experiment, which he
videotaped.
   It was the second time Milhaud said he had used a comatose human
being for an experiment. In 1985, he experimented on a 20-year-old
comatose man in a chronic vegetative state, setting off a scandal.
That person also died, but no link was established between the
experiment and the death.
   At the time, Milhaud called such patients ``almost perfect human
models, who constitute intermediaries between animal and man.''
   The latest experiment was made public in testimony Tuesday by
Dr. Jean Lassner, a medical expert at a trial in the town of
Poitiers where three doctors are charged in connection with the
1984 death of a 33-year-old woman.
   The woman, Nicole Berneron, died after the removal of a tumor.
She apparently had received nitrogen oxide instead of oxygen during
resuscitation. A report showed that the tubes of the resuscitation
system had been switched.
   Milhaud had informed Lassner of his experiment but has refused
all comment since the court testimony.

   Return with us now to May 1939 and the Batman's
debut in Detective Comics No. 27.
   Our story opens as handsome, young socialite Bruce Wayne chats
with his old friend, Police Commissioner Gordon.
   Wayne, his smartly tailored suit a lively orange window-pane
plaid, asks if anything exciting is happening these days.
   ``No,'' Gordon replies. ``Except this fellow they call the
`Bat-Man' puzzles me!'' Indeed!
   It seems a grim, costumed ``Bat-Man'' has taken up crime
fighting. Always one step ahead of the police, he tosses thugs about
like throw pillows.
   A bizarre series of burglary-murders ensues. The Batman
investigates. Conflict! A struggle. The Caped Crusader is subdued!
... Trapped!
   Villain sneers: ``This is the gas chamber I use to kill guinea
pigs. To experiment with _ but now YOU are my guinea pig (Heh! Heh!)
When this glass lid covers you entirely, gas will come through the
jet and kill you (Heh! Heh!)''
   Victim comeback: ``You fiend.''
   ``Bat-Man'' comment after slugging criminal mastermind to
horrible plunging death in acid vat: ``A fitting end for his kind.''
   Wayne casually reappears for the denouement, and Gordon reflects,
``Bruce Wayne is a nice young chap _ but he certainly must lead a
boring life. ... Seems disinterested in everything.''
   Ha! The story ends as Wayne ``returns home to his room ... a
little later his door slowly opens ... and reveals its occupant. ...
If the commissioner could see his young friend now ... he'd be
amazed to learn that he is the `Bat-Man!'''
   ``Watch for a new thrilling Bat-Man story next month.''

  [Text] Majuro, Jan 25 (AFP) -- Top Marshall Islands 
government officials have criticised what they say is the 
failure of the United States to release information about the 
effects of its nuclear test program here. Officials said they 
believed the lack of data had led to inadequate compensation 
being paid to Marshall Islanders. 
  In the wake of US Department of Energy (DOE) admissions that 
US citizens were used as unwitting guinea pigs for nuclear 
experiments, Foreign Minister Tom Kijiner said Monday that the 
United States had failed to release full information about its 
nuclear test program in the Marshalls. His comments followed a 
recent medical study confirming that the Marshalls had a rate of 
thyroid tumours dramatically higher than in other parts of the 
world. 
  The study indicated health problems were not confined to the 
atolls of Rongelap, Utirik, Bikini and Enewetak, which the 
United States said were the only radiation-exposed areas in the 
Marshalls. 
  During the early 1980s, Marshall Islands negotiators sought 
detailed information about the 66 announced nuclear tests, 
Kijiner said in an interview. 
  "But US officials told us there was no further information 
to 
provide to us," he said, adding that the US statements had 
proved to be false. "The United States wasn't fair to the 
Marshall Islands during the negotiations (of a treaty known as 
the Compact of Free Association between the two nations)." 
  Last month, the DOE released previously classified 
information about the size of a majority of its nuclear tests in 
the Marshalls, information Kijiner said the Marshalls first 
requested more than a year ago. 
  The foreign minister said the United States released only 
selected information during the negotiations on the Compact of 
Free Association so that nuclear compensation would be minimised. 
  Marshall Islanders had brought lawsuits in US courts seeking 
about five billion US dollars in compensation for damages from 
the nuclear tests. 
  The United States provided a 150 million dollar trust fund 
to 
yield about 270 million dollars over 15 years in the compact 
that was negotiated in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 
  Marshalls Washington ambassador, Wilfred Kendall, said here 
that the matter of US compensation "needs to be revisited." 
  He concurred with Kijiner, saying that "all the details 
(about the nuclear tests) were not on the table during the 
negotiations." 
  Their contention is supported by a leading US congressman, 
California Democrat George Miller who is chairman of the House 
Committee on Natural Resources. 
  In a letter to US President Bill Clinton earlier this month, 
Miller wrote: "This committee has long been concerned that the 
entire story of the testing done in the Marshalls Islands has 
not yet been told and that the health and well-being of a 
significant number of Marshallese may depend on a look at all 
the facts." 
  Miller said some Rongelap islanders, who were engulfed in a 
cloud of radiation from a 1954 hydrogen bomb test at Bikini, 
have charged that they were used as guinea pigs to further US 
understanding of the effects of radiation. 
  "In the light of the recent disclosures regarding actual 
radiation experimentation in the United States during this 
period, that possibility cannot be ignored," he wrote. 
  He called on the Clinton administration to declassify 
information on the nuclear test program in the Marshalls.

  [Abstract] The broad range of human diseases caused by 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well various plant and 
animal ailments induced by numerous pathogenic factors in the 
pseudomonads, primarily enzymes with a toxic effect, and the 
resulting immunodeficiency prompted a study of the 
immunosuppressive action of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
extracts with respect to the cell immune response and an attempt 
to find the origin of the immunosuppressive factors. To this 
end, typical Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains separated 
from the sputum of pneumonia patients (Nos. 140 and 3,990) and 
strains which had been cultivated for a long time in nutrient 
media under lab conditions (Nos. 1,961 and U-1) were examined. 
In so doing, the effect of water-phenol, trichloracetic, and 
salt extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on the 
delayed hypersensitivity of mice to the guinea pig antigen is 
studied. The study reveals that the salt extracts of the wild 
strains contain thermostable immunosuppressive factors of a 
lipid origin with a high mass (over 800 kD) which may be 
inactivated by trichloracetic acid and phenol. On the other 
hand, salt extracts of museum strains as well as water and 
phenol trichloracetic extracts produced from wild and museum 
bacteria strains do not display immunosuppressive activity. It 
is speculated that these factors may be a pseudomonad 
lipopolysachharide component and that the biological properties 
of pseudomonads are not related to impairments of the 
oxygen-dependent processes in macrophages. Figures 2; tables 2;

  [Text] Majuro, Jan 25 (AFP) -- Top Marshall Islands 
government officials have criticised what they say is the 
failure of the United States to release information about the 
effects of its nuclear test program here. 
  Officials said they believed the lack of data had led to 
inadequate compensation being paid to Marshall Islanders. 
  In the wake of U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) admissions 
that U.S. citizens were used as unwitting guinea pigs for 
nuclear experiments, Foreign Minister Tom Kijiner said Monday 
that the United States had failed to release full information 
about its nuclear test program in the Marshalls. 
  His comments followed a recent medical study confirming that 
the Marshalls had a rate of thyroid tumours dramatically higher 
than in other parts of the world. 
  The study indicated health problems were not confined to the 
atolls of Rongelap, Utirik, Bikini and Enewetak, which the 
United States said were the only radiation-exposed areas in the 
Marshalls. 
  During the early 1980's, Marshall Islands negotiators sought 
detailed information about the 66 announced nuclear tests, 
Kijiner said in an interview. 
  ``But U.S. officials told us there was no further 
information 
to provide to us,'' he said, adding that the U.S. statements had 
proved to be false. 
  ``The United States wasn't fair to the Marshall Islands 
during the negotiations (of a treaty known as the Compact of 
Free Association between the two nations).'' 
  Last month, the DOE released previously classified 
information about the size of a majority of its nuclear tests in 
the Marshalls, information Kijiner said the Marshalls first 
requested more than a year ago. 
  The foreign minister said the United States released only 
selected information during the negotiations on the Compact of 
Free Association so that nuclear compensation would be minimised. 
  Marshall Islanders had brought lawsuits in U.S. courts 
seeking about five billion U.S. dollars in compensation for 
damages from the nuclear tests. 
  The United States provided a 150 million dollar trust fund 
to 
yield about 270 million dollars over 15 years in the compact 
that was negotiated in the late 1970's and early 1980's. 
  Marshalls Washington ambassador, Wilfred Kendall, said here 
that the matter of U.S. compensation ``needs to be revisited.'' 
  He concurred with Kijiner, saying that ``all the details 
(about the nuclear tests) were not on the table during the 
negotiations.'' 
  Their contention is supported by a leading U.S. congressman, 
California Democrat George Miller who is chairman of the House 
Committee on Natural Resources. 
  In a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton earlier this 
month, Miller wrote: ``This committee has long been concerned 
that the entire story of the testing done in the Marshalls 
Islands has not yet been told and that the health and well-being 
of a significant number of Marshallese may depend on a look at 
all the facts.'' 
  Miller said some Rongelap islanders, who were engulfed in a 
cloud of radiation from a 1954 hydrogen bomb test at Bikini, 
have charged that they were used as guinea pigs to further U.S. 
understanding of the effects of radiation. 
  ``In the light of the recent disclosures regarding actual 
radiation experimentation in the United States during this 
period, that possibility cannot be ignored,'' he wrote. 
  He called on the Clinton administration to declassify 
information on the nuclear test program in the Marshalls.

<HEAD>Family of Human Guinea Pig Sues Doctor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMIENS, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The family of a comatose man who was used
as a human guinea pig filed suit Tuesday against the doctor who
carried out the experiment.
   Pascal Louette, 24, who went into a deep coma following an auto
accident, died Sunday after Dr. Alain Milhaud placed him on a
sabotaged medical device to see if the effects matched those of a
similar case, currently the subject of a trial in Poitiers.
   Louette was considered clinically dead at the time of the
experiment, which was performed at the Regional Hospital Center of
Amiens.
   News of the experiment was made public a week ago and touched
off a furor in France.
   Health Minister Michele Barzach suspended Milhaud on Feb. 24
from his duties as chief anesthesiologist at the hospital center.
   The Louette family's lawyer, Alain Lhote, said his clients filed
suit against Milhaud for ``willful injury of a person unable to
defend himself because of his mental or physical state.''
   ``One can't treat a human being in the way Pascal was treated,''
said Lhote.
   He said Louette's parents were not properly informed about the
medical care their son was receiving and suffered ``a double
traumatism: the loss of a loved one and also the theft of a soul
which was stolen from them.''
   The exact date of the experiment hasn't been made public. It was
announced Feb. 23 in court testimony at the Poitiers trial. Louette
was injured late last year and transferred to the Regional Hospital
Center on Jan. 19. He fell into a deep coma shortly thereafter and
was kept alive on a respirator.
   Milhaud's experiment was prompted by a trial of three physicians
in Poitiers, accused in connection with the 1984 death of a woman
following an operation to remove a tumor.
   The woman, Nicole Berneron, received nitrogen oxide instead of
oxygen during resuscitation after the operation. A report later
showed the tubes supplying the two gases had been switched.
   The state prosecutor on Tuesday asked for 15-year prison terms
each for Drs. Bakari Diallo and Denis Archambeau, both
anesthesiologists. He did not ask for a specific sentence for Dr.
Pierre Desforges-Meriel, charged with involuntary homicide.

<TEXT>     But that sum is not likely to satisfy Marshallese victims who have filed
civil suits seeking approximately $7 billion in compensation for death and
illness suffered as a result of the 66 nuclear weapons detonations above
Bikini and Eniwetok Atolls between 1946 and 1958.;    Moreover, the United
States has never fulfilled its commitment to make a serious effort to protect
the health and safety of those weapons test victims. Indeed, there is
considerable evidence that many of them have been used, without their
knowledge or permission, as human guinea pigs by scientists and physicians
employed by the federal government to study the effects of radiation
exposure.;    A 1977 study of Bikini conducted by the U.S. Department of
Energy concluded that radiation levels exceeded federal guidelines decades
after the nuclear tests were concluded, but the department was unwilling to
evacuate the atoll because it is "possibly the best available source of data
for evaluating the transfer of plutonium across the gut wall after being
incorporated into biological systems.";    In other words, DOE officials
wanted to examine the Marshallese after they consumed crops grown in
radioactive soil and fish caught in radioactive waters.;    At a 1956
briefing, an official of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission noted that the
Marshall Islands are "by far one of the most contaminated areas of the world,"
then suggested that the indigenous people were preferable as test subjects to
the mice usually used in laboratory experiments for cancer:;    "While it is
true that these people do not live, I would say, the way Westerners do,
civilized people, it is nevertheless true that they are more like us than
mice.";    That policy has produced dreadful outcomes. Because of
radioactivity's inter-generational genetic effects, some women in the
Marshalls still give birth to "jellyfish babies" -- grotesque, shapeless,
spineless collections of fluid and unformed organs wrapped in skin that are
lifeless when they emerge from the womb.;    No people have suffered more than
those who were on Rongelap Atoll in the pre-dawn hours of March 1, 1954, when
a 17-megaton thermonuclear device -- a hydrogen bomb at least 1,000 times more
powerful than the atomic bombs exploded over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki in 1945 -- was detonated in an AEC atmospheric test.;    The
dreaded mushroom-shaped cloud rose 25 miles into the sky and spread until it
was 70 miles wide. A radioactive storm produced ash and powder that fell on
Rongelap's people and covered the ground to a depth of 2 inches.;    AEC
radioactivity monitors went off their scales, but the residents of Rongelap --
vomiting, losing their hair and suffering from severe burns -- were not
evacuated until more than two days later. The AEC deceptively claimed that the
largest hydrogen bomb detonation in the world's history was a "routine" event
and "all (Rongelap residents) were reported well.";    Even though radiation
levels remained dangerously high, the Rongelap residents were returned to
their homes three years later. "The habitation of these people on the island
will afford most valuable radiation data on human beings," said a secret AEC
report.;    Now, the tribunal here in Majuro is processing claims from
residents of Rongelap and other atolls suffering from leukemia, lymphomas,
multiple myeloma, hyperthyroidism and cancer of the thyroid, breast, pharynx,
esophagus, stomach, ovaries, colon, pancreas, small intestine, bile ducts,
gall bladder and brain.  </TEXT>

   In 1922, Urvan Ubben's parents had his
``funeral picture'' taken, certain he'd be the next family member
to die of diabetes.
   Today, the 77-year-old laughs at the childhood photo and how he
cheated death by being one of the first people to test insulin.
Experts say he may be the world's oldest surviving diabetic.
   ``I was one of the guinea pigs when Eli Lilly was trying to
mass-produce insulin in Indianapolis back in 1922,'' Ubben said.
``In those days, they figured that if you had diabetes, you didn't
have a chance. And my parents were highly skeptical of insulin.
   ``So when I came back from the experimental treatments in
Indianapolis, my parents still thought I was going to die and they
wanted a picture of me. So they had my picture taken.
   ``Years later, I was looking at my mother's old pictures with an
aunt. When we came across that photo, she said `Urv, there's your
funeral picture.' We just laughed about it.''
   Diabetes, a disease caused by excess sugar in the bloodstream,
was no laughing matter when Ubben developed it in 1922.
   Earlier that year, Ubben's sister Theola died after slipping
into a diabetic coma. Ubben already had lost an aunt, an uncle and
his great-grandfather to the disease.
   ``It was quite scary for my parents and they were pretty
discouraged,'' Ubben said. ``Insulin had just been discovered
earlier that year; no one knew anything about it.
   ``Of course, now we know it's wonderful stuff. It's kept me
alive all these years.''
   A spokeswoman at Eli Lilly and Co. in Indianapolis confirmed
Ubben's 1922 diagnosis and his testing of insulin after its
discovery in Toronto.
   The pharmaceutical company isn't sure if one other member of the
first test group is alive. Ubben may be the oldest surviving
diabetic, said Gene McCormick, retired Lilly historian.
   Ubben suffered frequent bouts with diabetes-related illnesses
brought on by ignoring doctors' orders to maintain a strict diet.
He became partially blind from an attack in 1938.
   He and his wife of nearly 53 years, Wilma, raised three children
and worked a small farm. He later ran a coin-operated machine
business and worked as a furniture maker and wood sculptor.
   Ubben learned the dangers of insulin overdose when he
experienced one of the first documented insulin reactions. After
his treatment in Indianapolis, he was in a Peoria hospital for
observation when he passed out.
   ``The doctor didn't have any idea what was wrong,'' said Ubben,
who described the episode in an autobiography 10 years ago.
   Because the hospital had no facilities to analyze Ubben's blood
for sugar content, a specimen was raced to a doctor's laboratory by
police.
   The lab technician was at the movies. While Ubben's parents were
summoned to their ``dying'' son's bedside, every theater in Peoria
flashed an emergency message on the screen to locate the technician.
   The message worked.
   The technician raced back to her lab to study Ubben's blood and
found the lowest blood sugar she had ever seen.
   But the hospital had no glucose to counter the insulin
overpowering Ubben's body.
   So his doctor pried the unconscious boy's teeth apart, shoved a
rubber hose down his throat and poured a bottle of corn syrup into
his stomach in a crude effort to raise his blood sugar. Ubben was
revived.
   ``My parents were racing to the hospital to see me shove off,''
Ubben said. ``They thought I was going to die. But I fooled them.
They got there in time to see me wipe syrup off my face.''

   A Navy technician accused of having sex
with his fiancee without telling her he was infected with the AIDS
virus was acquitted of assault Wednesday by a military jury.
   Petty Officer 2nd Class John E. Crawford, 27, of Magnolia, Ark.,
stood at attention in the packed courtroom as the seven-member jury
delivered the verdict after 4{ hours of deliberation.
   The sailor was convicted of a minor charge of having a visitor
in his room after hours and was given 15 days in the brig and
reduced in rank one grade. He could have received up to two years
in the brig for the offense.
   ``It was what I felt was right,'' Crawford, accompanied by his
present fiancee, Karen Skavdahl, said of the verdict.
   Crawford could have been stripped of his rank, dishonorably
discharged and sentenced to a decade behind bars had he been
convicted of assault.
   The jury also acquitted him of adultery and of exposing his
former fiancee, Jeannie Elmer, to the AIDS virus. Elmer is a
civilian.
   The case was unprecedented in the Navy, although there have been
similar cases in other branches of the military.
   Crawford was accused of having unprotected sex with Elmer in
1987 without warning her he had tested positive for the AIDS virus.
He was charged with adultery because Elmer was separated, but not
divorced, from her third husband.
   Crawford, an avionics technician, testified he told Elmer about
his test results and wore a condom when the couple made love in his
barracks room.
   But Elmer said that she didn't learn Crawford had been exposed
to the virus until the next day, when her housemate _ who also had
been Crawford's lover _ told her about the sailor's test. Elmer has
tested negative for the AIDS virus.
   Five of the seven members of the jury had to agree to reach
verdicts.
   ``The government is attempting to explore how far the Uniform
Code of Military Justice can be applied against an individual ...
with the AIDS virus,'' defense attorney Lt. Ron Richman charged as
the case went to the jury. ``The government seeks to hold out Petty
Officer Crawford as a guinea pig to see how far it can go on the
AIDS issue.''
   Lt. Cmdr. Jane Gilliland, prosecutor in the case, said in her
closing statement that Crawford, depicted as caring and concerned
by the defense, simply didn't care enough about Elmer to tell her
about the tests.
   ``She had no idea that the act of sex which she engaged in with
Petty Officer Crawford was potentially fatal to her,'' Gilliland
said.
   Crawford has said Elmer was bitter that he had broken off their
brief engagement and filed charges for revenge.
   Meanwhile, in Arizona, the AIDS-related court-martial of Adrian
G. Morris Jr. resumed for the hearing of motions after a nine-month
delay.
   Morris, a 28-year-old Army private from Caseyville, Ill., is
accused of having threatened the health of three soldiers by not
using condoms during sex and failing to warn them he had tested
positive for the AIDS virus.
   Judge Raymond D. Cole set a July trial date after denying
motions for dismissal of charges. Cole will hear the case without a
jury at Morris' request.
   He is charged with aggravated assault, conduct prejudicial to
the good order and discipline of the Army and sodomy.
   The proceedings were adjourned Aug. 5 by Cole to allow the Army
to appeal his ruling barring the Army from introducing Morris' AIDS
blood test as evidence. Cole's ruling was later reversed.
   The national Centers for Disease Control estimates that 20
percent to 30 percent of those who show antibodies to the AIDS
virus will develop the fatal disease within five years.

<TEXT>
   A Justice Department official urged a House
subcommittee on Friday to reject ``ill-conceived'' legislation to
compensate some cancer victims among southwestern uranium miners
and people who lived downwind of 1950s U.S. atomic tests in Nevada.
   ``The bill does not require that causation between exposure to
radiation and cancer be established or that any legal theory of
liability on the part of the United States be proven,'' said Steven
Valentine, deputy assistant attorney general in the department's
civil division.
   Valentine, restating opposition voiced by Justice officials for
more than a decade, said the department does not believe a link has
been proven between radiation and cancers in miners and people
receiving fallout from the atmospheric weapons tests.
   ``The assumptions underlying this ill-conceived proposal are
either subject to serious dispute or demonstrably erroneous,'' said
Valentine, adding that the department would recommend a veto of
legislation being pushed by lawmakers from Utah to compensate
victims or their survivors.
   ``I am incredulous,'' responded Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.,
chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee on administrative law and
government relations. Frank said radiation victim compensation
``will be high on the (subcommittee's) agenda next year. It won't
go away.''
   Frank's hearing centered on bills introduced by Rep. Wayne
Owens, D-Utah, and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, to pay compensation
similar to what Congress has voted in recent years to military
people who participated in the tests and to Marshall Islanders
injured by U.S. nuclear tests in the Pacific.
   Their proposal would give $50,000 each to people who lived in a
designated downwind area of Nevada, Utah and Arizona during the
Nevada tests and who developed cancers that studies show had a high
probability of being caused by the radiation.
   Payments of $100,000 each would go to people who worked for
minimum periods in underground uranium mines in Utah, Colorado, New
Mexico and Arizona between 1949 and 1971 and who developed lung
cancer and other respiratory problems.
   The lawmakers say the legislation is needed because a U.S.
appeals court has overturned a circuit court ruling that awarded
damages to some 1,200 downwind residents on grounds that the
government had failed to warn them of the tests' dangers.
   Owens, who as a private attorney represented some of the
plaintiffs, said that he also has had personal experience with
health problems of former miners.
   ``Last year, my brother-in-law died from lung cancer,'' Owens
testified. ``He worked in the Marysvale uranium mine in Utah for
less than six months _ a healthy man who never smoked a single
cigarette in his life dies from lung cancer.''
   Owens said payments to the miners are justified because the
government knew of high levels of radiation in the mines but failed
to warn the miners or force the mine owners to install proper
ventilating equipment.
   ``The government demonstrated a reckless disregard for the lives
of these uranium miners,'' he testified. ``The uranium miners
became mere guinea pigs in a government death watch.''
   Arden Higgins, who worked in the Marysvale mine from 1953 to
1959, told the subcommittee that although he never smoked, he lost
his right lung to cancer in 1983.
   ``I've watched my partners and my friends die of lung cancer,''
Higgins said. ``It seems that each year another one dies.''
   He said federal inspectors took radioactivity readings in the
mine and that physicians tested the workers. ``They never mentioned
once what the radiation was doing to us,'' he said. ``They told us
we were all right.''

   Dioxin has been described as "the most potent carcinogen
ever tested." An unwanted contaminant in some chemicals and
industrial processes, it has been the target of studies
funded by the government to the tune of $400 million over the
past decade. Claims lodged by individuals who allegedly
suffered or even feared serious damage to their health from
exposure to dioxin have cost businesses and the government
additional hundreds of millions of dollars. Now a high
government official tells us that an inordinate fear of
dioxin was just a scientific misunderstanding.
   In 1982, the government ordered the evacuation of the
2,232 residents of Times Beach, Mo., because traces of dioxin
were found in the soil. At that time, the Centers for Disease
Control believed that ingesting anything containing as much
as one part per billion of dioxin posed a significant risk of
human health. The Environmental Protection Agency spent $33
million to buy up the town, and declared it to be a dangerous
toxic waste site. Motorists passing through on Highway 44
were greeted with signs warning them to keep their windows
closed and not to stop and leave their vehicles.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The government pinned the responsibility for the
contamination of Times Beach and 16 other Missouri sites on
Syntex Corp. One of its subsidiaries had bought a plant that
had once supplied dioxin-tainted waste oil to a contractor
who had sprayed it on the streets of Times Beach and the
other sites. After years of costly litigation, Syntex signed
a consent decree a year ago agreeing to clean up the sites
and incinerate some 100,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil.
Cost estimates run as much as $200 million over the next
decade.
   Soon after the demolition of buildings in Times Beach
began this spring, Dr. Vernon Houk, the CDC official who had
recommended the evacuation in 1982, dropped a bombshell. At
an environmental conference in Missouri, he said that he
would not be concerned about the levels of dioxin at Times
Beach because scientific studies have shown that low doses of
dioxin pose minimal health risks.
   Dr. Houk, who is director of the Center for Environmental
Health and Injury Control at the CDC, told reporters that he
now believes that the evacuation of Times Beach was
unnecessary. Asked what he would tell the former residents of
the town, who underwent the trauma of being torn from their
homes, Dr. Houk said: "We should have been more upfront with
Times Beach people and told them, `We're doing our best with
the estimates of the risk, but we may be wrong.' I think we
never added `but we may be wrong.'"
   In debunking the claim that dioxin is a potent human
carcinogen, Dr. Houk attacked the scientific theory and
methodology that had led him and others to what he believes
was a false conclusion. Dr. Houk said the method used to
assess the risk was based on an assumption that violates a
fundamental rule in toxicology: The dose makes the poison. It
was assumed that feeding laboratory animals the maximum dose
they could tolerate would enable scientists to determine
whether trace amounts of a chemical would cause cancer in
humans. One obvious problem with this is that different
animals have different responses to the same chemical. What
can be highly toxic to guinea pigs may have no effect on
rats, and what may cause cancer in mice will not necessarily
have the same effect on humans.
   But Dr. Houk's attack went beyond this. He added his voice
to that of Bruce Ames, head of the biochemistry department of
the University of California at Berkeley, a leading critic of
the methods used to assess the cancer risk from chemicals.
Mr. Ames contends that the animal tests are fundamentally
flawed because the maximum tolerated doses of the chemicals
being tested kill cells due to the sheer size of the dosage.
Mr. Ames argues that this can cause rapid cell division among
the surviving cells, leading to cancer-causing mutations.
This suggests that risks calculated from animal tests
involving maximum tolerated doses are greatly exaggerated.
   Dr. Houk says that most scientists now agree with this. He
cites the dioxin case as "a good example of why we must use
both animal and human data when evaluating the potential
health effects of chemical exposure for humans." The
epidemiologic evidence, he says, shows that "if dioxin is a
human carcinogen, it is a rather weak one in the population
exposed to high doses . . . and is not a carcinogen in the
population exposed to lower doses." He adds that there are no
convincing data that show that exposure to dioxin causes
birth defects, chronic diseases of the liver or of the
immune, cardiovascular, or neurologic systems.
   Skeptics have long noted the glaring inconsistency of the
risk assigned to dioxin based on animal tests and actual
human experience. What has brought scientists such as Dr.
Houk around is the mounting empirical evidence and the
growing support for a theory that explains why humans are far
less sensitive to dioxin than are guinea pigs.
   The theory is that for dioxin to have a toxic effect it
must first bind to receptors. There appears to be a dose,
which varies by species, below which the receptors don't
function; therefore there is no risk unless that dose is
reached or exceeded. No one knows just what the level is for
humans, but it is apparently far higher than the maximum
acceptable intake level set by the EPA of 0.006 trillionths
of a gram per kilogram of body weight per day. Canada and
some European countries set acceptable levels 170 to 1,700
times that.
   The EPA has yet to recognize that dioxin's dangers have
been greatly exaggerated, but Dr. Houk predicts it will
eventually come around. It plans to begin studying the matter
soon, but acceptance of Dr. Houk's analysis won't come
easily. Michael Gough of the Office of Technology Assessment
says that if the EPA backs off on dioxin, it will open the
door to demands for reassessment of many other chemicals.
"That," he says, "is a door they will reluctantly open."
   In the meantime, the cleanup of Times Beach proceeds. Dr.
Houk says there is little choice but to go ahead with it,
"because we've got the public so riled up." The media that
got people riled up with scare stories about dioxin-tainted
Agent Orange, Times Beach and paper-mill effluent have done
little to "unrile" them. Dr. Houk's turnabout was reported by
the St. Louis Post-Dispatch under a front-page banner
headline, but it got little attention in the East. ABC News
reported it; CBS and NBC did not. The newspapers that
influence those in Washington who could bring the costly
Times Beach boondoggle to a screeching halt buried a small AP
story deep on their inside pages.

   Two animal welfare groups have sued the U.S.
Department of Agriculture to try to force officials to regulate
treatment of laboratory rats, mice and birds.
   In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, the Humane
Society of the United States and the Animal Legal Defense Fund
claim that the department misused its discretion in excluding rats,
mice and birds from the protection of the Animal Welfare Act.
   The two groups filed a petition with the department last year,
formally asking for regulations to cover rats, mice and birds. It
was denied in June on the grounds that Agriculture Secretary
CLayton Yeutter has legal responsibility to decide which animals
are covered, aside from those specified in the text of the law:
dogs, cats, monkeys, guinea pigs, hamsters and rabbits.
   Kelly Shipp, spokeswoman for Yeutter, said she was aware of the
groups' concerns but could not comment on the lawsuit because she
had not seen it.
   Martin L. Stephens, the Humane Society's director of laboratory
animals, said rats, mice and birds make up nearly 85 percent of all
animals used in research, testing and experimentation in the United
States.
   ``If these animals are needed in research, surely they deserve
minimum standards of care,'' Stephens said.

  [Abstract] The danger of uncontrollable exposure of humans 
to ionizing radiation due to, e.g., nuclear accidents, and the 
shortcomings of existing natural and synthetic polymer drugs 
administered for radiation sickness, such as side effects, 
prompted continued search for compounds with a therapeutic 
antiactinic action which are free of this drawback. To this end, 
the anti-actinic and other biological properties of the 
2-methyl-5-vinylpyridine and N-vinylpyrrolidone copolymer 
(sovidon) are investigated in order to assess the outlook for 
its applications as a means of early acute radiation sickness 
treatment. The experiment was carried out on 20-24 g noninbred 
white hybrid mice (CBAxC57B1)F[.sub]1[/], 60-80 g hamsters, 
180-220 g rats, 280-350 g guinea pigs, 11-17 kg noninbred dogs, 
large 25-35 kg Romanov breed sheep, and Macaca 
fascicularis monkeys. The animals were exposed to general 
brief 0.5-1.5 Gy/min [.sup]60[/]Co irradiation or extended 
0.01 Gy/min [.sup]137[/]Cs irradiation. The copolymer was 
intramuscularly administered in the form of a 10% 
solution, and 
the modification of biological factors was monitored. The 
antiactinic therapeutic efficacy of sovidon--the copolymer 
developed by the Kovidon pharmaceutical company--in various 
types of animals at various doses, sovidon's treatment 
efficiency for prolonged irradiation, the tumor development 
rate, the effect of combined use of various antiactinic measures 
on the outcome of radiation injury in dogs, and sovidon's 
antiactinic efficiency when using drugs which mitigate its side 
effects are summarized. The findings confirm that given adequate 
experimental verification, sovidon may find applications in 
other branches of medicine (oncology, pulmonology, and 
hematology) or veterinary practices. The authors are grateful to 
B.A. Titov, E.P. Korovkina, P.A. Vlasov, V.N. Izvekov, L.V. 
Bogatov, and L.N. Dubov for assistance with experiments an 
constructive discussion of the findings. Tables 5; references

  [Abstract] It has been shown that Macaca rhesus monkeys 
injected with the Mozambique virus, which is closely related to 
the Lassa virus in terms of antigens, are protected against 
subsequent infection with a virulent strain of the Lassa virus. 
Owing to the fact that Mozambique virus is not pathogenic to man 
or monkeys, some researchers feel that Mozambique virus is a 
candidate for use in the preparation of a live vaccine designed 
to prevent Lassa fever. Before that can be done, however, 
convincing evidence must be produced to the effect that the 
virus is definitely not pathogenic to man, and it must be 
certain that the virus would not persist in the human body. Data 
published in the late 1980s reported testing of a recombinant 
Lassa vaccine on guinea pigs and monkeys, all of whom survived a 
lethal dose of Lassa virus after being vaccinated with the 
recombinant vaccine. Protection was not total, however, as they 
developed short-term fever and virusemia. That prompted the 
researchers here to study an inactivated vaccine against Lassa 
fever. The vaccine they tested protected Papio hamadryas monkeys 
against intramuscular infection of Lassa virus after both two 
immunizations and one immunization in doses of 1.1-2.1 mg and 
0.5-1.1 mg. The percentage of those protected dropped to 50 
percent when infection was via the aerogenic route and 
immunization was performed only once, in a dose of 1.1 mg. The 
protective effect was observed against the backdrop of an 
absence of specific virus-neutralizing antibodies. References

<HEAD>Animal-Rights Group Urging Avon to Stop Using Animals in Tests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
announced Thursday it plans to distribute material in the United
States, England, Italy, West Germany, Mexico and Canada in a
campaign urging Avon, the cosmetics products company, to stop using
animals for tests.
   ``Images from my 1986 visit to Avon's laboratories still haunt
me,'' said Susan Rich of the animal-rights group. She said annual
reports and letters to consumers say Avon puts out 90 percent of its
formulas without testing on animals. ``But, in 1989, no animals
should suffer to test yet another shampoo, perfume or mascara,'' she
said.
   Jim Preston, Avon's chairman and chief executive officer, said
that ``no company in the beauty industry has done more to reduce
animal testing than Avon.'' He added that Avon hopes to eliminate
all animal testing within three months.
   A company statement said Ms. Rich was told by Preston last week
of the progress the company has made. ``The company can only assume
that PETA called this boycott in a self-serving attempt to take
credit for Avon's plans to eliminate testing,'' the statement said.
   Preston said the safety of the company's consumers is its
paramount responsibility. ``PETA values human lives on a par with
the lives of rats, mice, guinea pigs and rabbits,'' Preston said.
``We do not.''

PRISONS: The government yesterday agreed to a narrower definition of the
proposed new offence of prison mutiny, as the prison security bill
progressed through its final Commons stages, David Owen writes.
The move followed Labour claims that the original wording could have
resulted in prisoners engaged in peaceful protests about minor issues being
charged with the offence, which will carry a maximum sentence of 10 years.
The revised bill states that mutiny occurs when two or more prisoners
'engage in conduct which is intended to further a common purpose of
overthrowing lawful authority in that prison.'
ANIMAL WELFARE: The use of animals for the testing of lipsticks, shampoos
and other cosmetic products would be banned under a private member's bill
introduced by Mr Jimmy Dunnachie (Lab Glasgow Pollok) yesterday.
He said guinea pigs and rabbits had been used for most of the 4,000
procedures for testing cosmetics and toiletries carried out in 1990.
Mr Dunnachie appealed to Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, to refuse to
grant new licences for such tests.
The Animal Experimentation (Cosmetics) Bill will come before the House for
its second reading on February 14, but is unlikely to make significant
progress due to time restraints.

Bud Clark: His Is the Tavern -- and the Town
---
By Susan G. Hauser</HL>
<DD> 12/22/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<DATELINE> Portland, Ore.  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A local tavern, the Goose Hollow Inn, celebrated its 20th anniversary this fall with week-long festivities. 
Hundreds of Portlanders attended the parties, and scores more drove or flew in from out of town. 
Even the mayor was there. 
Well, why not, since he owns the place. 

   The Goose Hollow Inn is no ordinary tavern. 
It has been written up in travel articles and guidebooks, even noted as a "must see" in a British student travel guide. 
There is nothing particularly interesting about the structure, a rather dilapidated building west of the city center, but the tavern's motto, "Dedicated to extremes of opinion," and the slogan on its matchbook covers, "If violence is your nature, either develop your verbal abilities or leave," has for 20 years attracted an interesting mix of loquacious drinkers. 

   Granted, the Goose Hollow Inn was a popular spot before its owner, Bud Clark, was elected mayor of Portland 3 1/2 years ago. 
But the tavern has become even more the place to be seen since Mr. Clark shed his tavern keeper's apron and set up shop in City Hall. 
After the newly elected mayor appeared on national television and performed for Johnny Carson his signature "Whoop! 
Whoop!" call (said to be the mating call of the domestic guinea pig), more patrons, eager to drink from the same spigot as Portland's greatest celebrity, appeared in droves. 

   Except for some conservative segments of the electorate, most Portlanders are proud of their mayor's fame. 
Another point of local pride is that Mr. Clark is the bearded, half-naked man posing in a poster that has sold nearly half a million copies world-wide since it was produced in 1978. 

   "Expose Yourself to Art" is a black-and-white photo poster showing Mr. Clark in work boots and trench coat "flashing" a statue of a naked woman. 
Mike Ryerson, a local publisher, said he photographed his friend as a lark and later ran the photo in his monthly neighborhood newspaper as a caption contest. 

   With the winning caption, Mr. Ryerson produced a limited number of the posters, but had no luck peddling them locally. 
He was able to interest some national distributors, however, and now, almost 10 years later, Mr. Ryerson is still turning out about 2,000 copies a month. 

   Mr. Ryerson's distributors have told him that "Expose Yourself to Art" is the best-selling poster in the world. 
Globe-trotting patrons of the Goose Hollow Inn have reported seeing their mayor's image in New York, Europe, Australia and even China. 

   Not everybody in Portland is impressed. 
With Mr. Clark up for re-election in May, some of his opponents are pointing to the poster as an embarrassment. 
It was bad enough that the mayor performed guinea-pig noises for a national audience, they say, but now the whole world is getting a glimpse of his bare legs. 

   Also being disputed is Mr. Clark's proclivity for unusual sartorial selections. 
One of his innovations as mayor has been the annual Dress As You Please Day, when all Portlanders are encouraged to set aside their usual work garb and wear whatever's comfortable. 
Mr. Clark's favored outfit is lederhosen and a T-shirt. 

   One of the several candidates facing Mr. Clark in the May mayoral election, former police chief Ron Still, recently said in a press conference, "We need a mayor who knows when to wear lederhosen and when to wear a three-piece suit." 

   "He thinks mayors shouldn't wear lederhosen at all," sniffed Mr. Clark. 

   Mr. Clark says he rankles at the sobriquet of tavern keeper. 
He's a businessman, not a tavern keeper, he says. 
Besides, his wife, Sigrid, a violinist with the Oregon Symphony, has been the official tavern keeper since his election. 

   But with election time drawing near, Mr. Clark recognizes that his main support comes from the regulars at the Goose Hollow Inn. 
As one patron said, "I don't know about what kind of mayor he's been, but he's the best damn tavern keeper this town has ever seen."

<TEXT>
   A third U.S. company says it will
begin human testing of a prototype AIDS vaccine designed to protect
people not infected with the deadly virus.
   Chiron Corp. said Wednesday that tests on humans will start in
Switzerland in the initial step in clinical studies that could last
10 years.
   The tests are being conducted by Biocine Co., a joint venture of
Chiron and Ciba-Geigy Corp., a New York subsidiary of a Swiss
pharmaceuticals giant.
   The first clinical trial will involve 20 to 25 healthy Swiss men
who do not carry the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency
syndrome and AIDS-related complex. Biocine said it is now selecting
the participants.
   It is the first human testing of a prospective AIDS vaccine in
Europe and may expand to the United States within a year, said
Ginger Rosenberg, a Chiron spokeswoman.
   Two other companies in the United States _ Oncogen in Seattle
and MicroGeneSys of Connecticut _ already have begun human trials
on AIDS vaccines in the United States.
   Chiron said it has already conducted tests on chimps, goats,
rabbits and guinea pigs.
   But ``since animals do not get AIDS, animal studies provide
limited information about the ability of a vaccine to generate a
protective immunity against the AIDS virus,'' said Dr. Dino Dina,
director of Chiron's virology program. ``Much of what we nee to
know about the vaccine's effectiveness must await the results of
our initial human studies.''
   Typically, it takes five to 10 years to test a prospective
vaccine, he said.

To develop the new vaccines, Stanford University researchers genetically 
modified the thin, corkscrew-shaped filaments or propellers, called flagella, 
which the salmonella bacteria use to swim. 
</P>
<P>
These flagella can be changed into vaccines to protect against infections for 
which there are no current immunizations, the scientists reported recently in 
the journal, Science. The method is an important step toward developing better 
medications that program the body's immune system to recognize and prevent 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
One test vaccine stimulated an immune response to cholera toxin in mice, the 
researchers found. In addition, other vaccines produced by the novel method 
stimulated immune responses in mice, rabbits and guinea pigs to antigens -- 
proteins that stimulate antibody production -- of several disease-causing 
microorganisms, including the AIDS virus, malaria parasite, hepatitis B virus 
and a hemolytic streptococcus, which results in strep throat.

COURT STOPS CSUN DENTAL EXPERIMENT; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: DENTISTS WIN SUIT TO STOP A PROGRAM THAT ALLOWED LICENSED HYGIENISTS TO 
CLEAN TEETH WITHOUT SUPERVISION.

<P>
The 3rd District Court of Appeal in Sacramento has ordered a halt to an 
experimental program run by Cal State Northridge in which dental hygienists 
worked independently, without the supervision of a dentist. 
</P>
<P>
The court said state authorities did not follow proper procedures when they 
approved the pilot program in 1987. Sixteen Southern California dental 
hygienists are participating in the experiment, which is designed to determine 
whether hygienists can clean teeth safely and profitably without the 
supervision of a dentist. 
</P>
<P>
All other dental hygienists are required by state law to work under the 
supervision of a dentist. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court ruled Friday that the Office of Statewide Health Planning and 
Development should have held a public hearing before approving the experiment. 
Four more hygienists have applied to work in the program, which comes up for 
review in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Dentists, who sued state regulators in an attempt to shut down the program, 
applauded the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not opposed to research. We are opposed to experimentation on 
unsuspecting patients," said Dr. Dale Redig, executive director of the 
California Dental Assn. "Programs that have the potential to threaten public 
health should be put through the most rigorous scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
Hygienists, 90% of whom are women, have long labored as employees in dental 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
"They got us on a technicality," said Phil Perry, assistant director of 
external affairs for the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. 
State regulators reviewed the experiment during an open meeting attended by 
dental association members but failed to keep proper transcripts or meet other 
criteria required for a proper public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to take this lying down," Perry said. Regulators will seek a 
delay while trying to appeal the court's ruling, he said, or schedule a public 
hearing on the dental program, which has operated at offices in Reseda, Van 
Nuys, La Canada and in Central and Northern California. It is directed by a 
public health specialist at CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good program. It's a viable program," Perry said. "They're taking 
X-rays and cleaning teeth. If they find a cavity, they call the doctor they're 
working with." 
</P>
<P>
He said association members were "guarding their turf" and "trying to remove 
any perceived competition" because unsupervised hygienists might provide some 
dental care at a lower price than dentists charge. 
</P>
<P>
All the hygienists are licensed, and most have been practicing for 10 years or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
The court ruling was the latest setback for the experiment, called the Dental 
Hygiene Independent Practice Prototype. It was created as a result of a 1972 
law authorizing experiments in health care that would otherwise be illegal in 
an effort to find novel ways of treating patients. The hygienist project took 
six years to get under way, delayed by lack of financing and the opposition of 
the dental association, which represents more than 14,000 dentists. 
</P>
<P>
The association, saying the project amounted to a declaration of war on 
dentistry, filed suit against the program in 1987. A Sacramento Superior Court 
judge refused to halt the project, but the association appealed, leading to 
Friday's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Lombardo, an attorney for the association, said hygienists are not 
educated or licensed to diagnose dental disease or serve as primary health-care 
providers. Dentists characterized the patients as guinea pigs. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to court because this is an experimental program that necessarily 
involves human subjects," Lombardo said. "It should be scrutinized very 
carefully and in an open setting." 
</P>
<P>
But the hygienists have responded that patients of the independent hygienists 
are no more guinea pigs than patients of dentists are when the dentist is on 
vacation or takes a day off, leaving an hygienist unsupervised. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court ordered the Sacramento Superior Court to require the Office 
of Statewide Health Planning and Development to halt the program.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Leaves learn to make vaccines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE humble cowpea plant is nurturing a potentially far-reaching medical
advance which could help prevent Aids and other infectious diseases.
The plant, which produces the black-eyed bean, is being used to produce
animal and human vaccines.
The first experimental vaccines, against foot-and-mouth disease and Aids,
are growing in a greenhouse at the John Innes Centre in Norwich.
If these experiments are successful, the manufacture of vaccines for a wide
range of diseases could be transformed.
The drugs industry would make immense savings because growing plants is far
cheaper than today's methods which use live animals or cell cultures.
Patients would also benefit from cheaper plant-grown vaccines, especially in
developing countries, because, being more stable, they could be stored for
years without refrigeration.
The plant vaccine system has been developed by Agricultural Genetics Company
(AGC) of Cambridge in collaboration with Prof Jack Johnson of Purdue
University, Indiana, and Dr George Lomonossoff of the John Innes Centre.
Details will be announced at a scientific meeting of the Royal Society in
London next week.
The scientists hope to be able to use it to produce vaccines for other
diseases, including hepatitis and the common cold.
The first vaccine, for foot-and-mouth disease, is already giving promising
results on guinea pigs at the Institute of Animal Health in Surrey. Tests on
a second plant-grown vaccine - against HIV - are now under way.
The system is based on the cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV). The scientists
discovered that its structure is particularly well suited to genetic
engineering. They have hooked antibody-stimulating proteins from animal
viruses on to exposed 'loops' on the surface of CPMV.
In animals, natural CPMV produces the strong immune response that is
essential for successful vaccination. But, as a plant virus, CPMV cannot
actually infect animals. This should make it safe for use in humans.
AGC's production system involves infecting cowpea seedlings with genetically
activated CPMV and harvesting the plants after two weeks to extract viral
particles, which are then formulated into a vaccine.
Each cowpea leaf contains enough material to make 200 doses of
foot-and-mouth disease vaccine.

<HEADLINE>  HAMSTERS AREN'T ONLY ONES RUNNING AROUND
IN CIRCLES  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Rafferty is a writer for the Features department.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Each time I see their pleas, I cringe. Truth be told, I've been trying to
forget about pets ever since the subject was first raised a year ago.;    In
the world of pets, I would have favored a dog, but the lease on our rented
house forbids such an addition to the family. That reduces us to the feline
level, but their father is allergic to cats and I've never managed to form a
satisfactory relationship with a cat anyway. That leaves us with the rodent
family, not a world that appeals to me.;    We have had a couple of rodents in
the house, but never for very long. The first to arrive was Marty, the school
hamster. Marty stayed for a weekend and he was such an unassuming guest that I
forgot all about him. He never asked for anything, never even made a sound the
entire time he was with us.;    He was so unassuming, I panicked. I woke with
a start about 2 a.m. on Monday. "Marty!" I shrieked.;    "Who?" said my
husband.;    "Marty!";    "Who the hell is Marty?" he asked suspiciously.;   
"The hamster.";    "Oh." He went back to sleep.;    I got up, fearing the
worst, and ran down the hall to make sure Marty was still alive. He was. And
quite active, too -- running around on his little hamster wheel all by himself
in the middle of the night. It was a depressing scene, somehow encapsulating
the general angst I was feeling.;    "I know just how you feel," I told the
small creature soothingly.;    Marty was taken back to school a few hours
later and I thought of him fondly over the next several weeks. We had a
connection. But then, without warning, he died. The kids had a service for him
at school and he was buried in a small grave in the corner of the playground.;
   The next rodent to come to our house was Blackie, the class guinea pig. I
had been warned about Blackie from some neighbors who had taken him the
previous weekend and had finally put him and his cage in the bathroom. Blackie
smelled something awful, but the kids didn't seem to notice.;    At first, we
kept him on a table in the kitchen, but gradually the smell began to fill the
room, making it impossible to eat with relish. This was during that freezing
spell, and I was sorely tempted to put Blackie outside -- but not knowing
enough about rodents, I was uncertain he'd survive. Two rodent deaths so close
together might do psychological harm to the children and their teacher might
finger me as a crazed serial killer of rodents.;    So instead, we changed his
shavings several times a day and held our noses until Monday morning when I
gratefully carried Blackie and his cage back to school.;    My mind was set:
no guinea pigs. Hamsters were too depressing and also too fragile.;   
Rabbits. Hmm. Rabbits, maybe not. They involve a lot of equipment, such as
large hutches and chicken wire. Besides, rabbits are always escaping in our
neighborhood, burrowing out of their hutches and into the great outdoors to
mate. The possibility loomed that we might wind up with many more rabbits than
we had anticipated.;    So that leaves us with slimy things. A snake? No way.
I couldn't sleep, thinking of it curled up in one of my rooms, its body
pressed against its glass cage.;    What about fish? Too boring. We tried fish
a year ago and they died very quickly, their limp bodies floating on top of
the water within a week of their arrival. We didn't even have the decency to
give them a proper burial. I simply flushed them down the toilet when the kids
were at school, hoping they wouldn't notice. They didn't.;    I reconsider the
options. Hamsters appear to be the least amount of hassle. I tell the kids
they can have one. "When? When? One or two?" Two can easily become a dozen.
Next weekend we'll go to the pet store and they can each choose a hamster.;   
I'll just have to remember whenever I see these rodents on their wheels in the
middle of the night that they're just getting exercise. It's not a comment on
the human condition.  </TEXT>

   A veterinarian employed by the Ministry
of Defense escaped injury when a bomb exploded underneath her
vehicle, and police said Friday that their investigation centered on
animal rights groups.
   The explosion occurred Wednesday as Margaret Baskerville, who
works for the Chemical Defense Establishment, was backing her car
away from her home at Winterslow, a suburb of Salisbury.
   ``It has now been established the explosion was caused by a
device fitted underneath the vehicle,'' Inspector Graham Chivers of
the Wiltshire police said Friday.
   No group claimed responsibility.
   The Chemical Defense Establishment uses animals _ primarily mice
and guinea pigs _ in tests of protective measures against chemical
and biological agents.

<HEAD>Professor Says Diseased Mice Freed in Fire, Break-In</HEAD>

   A group identifying itself as the Animal
Liberation Front claimed responsibility for two early-morning arson
fires that caused an estimated $100,000 damage and may have
unleashed a potentially deadly disease.
   The group claimed in a letter sent to news organizations that it
freed more than 1,000 animals from three research facilities at the
University of Arizona and set fire to a diagnostic lab and a
converted house near the medical college campus.
   Charles Sterling, a professor of veterinary science, said 30
young mice infected with what he described as a Third World disease
were among those taken.
   The mice carry the disease cryptosporidium which Sterling said
cause severe diarrhea lasting two to four weeks. He says the mice
will overcome the disease in a week to 10 days but they and their
fecal matter are infectious until then.
   Sterling said the disease has been known to be fatal to AIDS
patients, other immuno-suppressed individuals and malnurished
children, and he said there is no known treatment for it.
   Fire Capt. Keith Richter said no one was injured in the fires,
one on the main campus and one near the medical campus. Two
laboratories were gutted and two others partially damaged and
classrooms were damaged in the first fire, he said.
   Richter said there was about $10,000 in damage to ceilings and
walls in a hallway area at the second site.
   He said the fires were intentionally set.
   The group's statement said 950 mice, 50 rats, 16 rabbits, 14
guinea pigs, 10 frogs and other animals were freed ``from certain
torture and death at the hands of U of A students and researchers.''
   Sharon Kha, director of public information for the university,
said researchers were being asked to inventory their animals. There
was no immediate comment as to how the animals were being used.
   Graffiti on walls and doors of one building included ``Nowhere
is Safe _ A.L.F,'' ``A.L.F. We Shall Return'' and ``Vivisection
Will End.''
   The group said the animals, ``many of whom were found with open
sores and wounds and dying from overdose injections of various
substances, are being placed in good homes around the country where
they will live free from the invasive curiosity of researchers and
vivisectionists.''
   It also claimed that arguments that animal research benefits
human health are ``blatant lies spread by the research industry to
protect itself from the truth. Animal research never has and never
will benefit human health'' because of radically different
physiological makeup from that of humans, it said.
   ``Concrete and steel doors will not stop us,'' the statement
said. ``We will be back and will keep coming back until all animal
torture at U of A is stopped.''

A TRIP TO THE zoo is a favorite outing, but weekends often bring capacity 
crowds. Parents who have elbowed their way in for a glimpse of the chimps once 
too often will probably like to know that there are several Southern California 
colleges where animals are regularly on view -- usually without the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Because Moorpark College in Moorpark offers courses for would-be zookeepers and 
animal trainers, the college keeps more than 350 exotic animals on campus. 
Although the stalls are not open to the public, people are welcome to observe 
the animals from a walk that encircles the compound. Animals in residence 
include tigers, lions, wolves, coyotes, water buffalo and ocelots. There is 
also a petting zoo with goats, sheep, rabbits and guinea pigs, as well as a 
weekly animal show at the wildlife theater. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly Pomona maintains barns that house sheep, pigs and cattle, as well as 
the stables of its renowned Kellogg Arabian horses -- all of which can be 
visited. During the school year there is also a monthly horse show at the 
state-of-the-art Arabian Horse Center, a tradition that dates back 63 years to 
founder and breakfast cereal magnate W. K. Kellogg. The show includes jumping, 
vaulting (gymnastics on horseback), trick horses and costumed riders.

Time was when most youngsters either lived on a farm or knew someone who did. 
Today's urban and suburban kids can get a idea of agricultural life from a 
visit to the Pierce College Farm in Woodland Hills. This working farm is home 
to chickens, horses, sheep, pigs and cattle. Because these are farm animals, 
not pets, children are able to observe but not touch the animals. The walking 
tour of the farm lasts about 2 hours (no strollers; backpacks OK). The Pierce 
College Farm is also the site of an annual rodeo each May. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark College Exotic Animal Compound in Moorpark: Weekly animal show on 
Sunday at 3 p.m.; admission is $2 adults, $1 for children. The petting zoo is 
open from 10 a.m to 2:30 p.m. daily; admission 50 cents. No reservations 
needed, but larger groups can make arrangements for special shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Poly Pomona in Pomona: The barns and stables are open from 8 a.m. to 4 
p.m. daily; no charge. Families can tour the barns unescorted; larger groups 
must make an appointment for a guided tour. Horse shows are held October to 
June on the first Sunday of every month. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce College Farm in Woodland Hills: Public tours each at 10 a.m. on 
Saturday; tours are 50 cents per person. Reservations required. No tours in 
August. School groups can tour Tuesday and Thursday at 10 a.m. during the 
school year.

   First lady Barbara Bush dedicated the first
school named after her husband, then met ``George Bush,'' the guinea
pig and ``Dan Quayle,'' the hermit crab, in kindergarten.
   It was Mrs. Bush's first visit since the election to the city
where she and the president spent 11 years in the 1950s and 1960s.
   Mrs. Bush was in Midland on Monday to dedicate George H.W. Bush
Elementary School.
   After a brief ceremony, she visited the 36 children in the
school's two kindergarten classes.
   ``What's his name?'' Mrs. Bush asked one of the kindergarten
students as she pointed at a brown and white guinea pig in a glass
tank. A little boy told her the name.
   ``Oh!'' she said, raising her eyebrows in feigned shock. ``George
Bush!''
   Then she walked over to another tank containing a hermit crab and
said, ``I'm not going to ask who the crab's named after.''
   She was told that the crab's name was ``Dan Quayle.''

Walters says women cannot have it all _ career, marriage and
children _ and she pointed to herself as an example.
   ``You can have a great marriage and great children; great
marriage and great career; great career and great children. But I
think it is so hard to have a great marriage, a great career, not a
job but a career, and great children,'' Ms. Walters told the
``Virginia Woman '90s'' conference sponsored by Sen. John W. Warner,
R-Va.
   She advised the 2,100 women in the audience Monday not to feel
guilty if they have trouble meeting the demands of career and
family, and admitted it hasn't been so easy for her.
   ``I've been divorced. I have a daughter, who, thank God, is 21
and out of her adolescence,'' said the 57-year-old ABC correspondent
and star of the ``20-20'' show.
   Ms. Walters advised the women to have a life beyond getting up in
the morning and going to work, ``although that can be pretty
wonderful and intoxicating.''

according to the publicist who spoke on condition of anonymity. The
date of the engagement was not revealed, the agent said Monday.
   Bridges, 24, remains in jail on $2 million bail awaiting trial on
charges he shot Kenneth Clay, 25, on Feb. 2 in a Los Angeles home
authorities alleged was used as a gathering place for people to
smoke ``crack'' cocaine.
   Clay survived the shooting. Bridges has pleaded innocent to

   Dave Dravecky, the baseball pitcher who came
back from cancer in his throwing arm, has won the 1989 Willie Mac
Award as the San Francisco Giants' most inspirational player.
   The award, voted by the Giants' players, was announced Monday.
   Dravecky, 34, underwent surgery in October to remove a cancerous
tumor located in a muscle near his left shoulder. After months of
therapy and a minor league rehabilitation stint, he returned to the
mound Aug. 10 at Candlestick Park and pitched eight innings to earn
a 4-3 victory over Cincinnati.
   Five days later in Montreal, Dravecky broke a bone in his upper
left arm while making a pitch to the Expos' Tim Raines. He got the
victory to finish the year with a 2-0 record and a 3.46 earned run
average.
   Dravecky, the 10th winner of the award named for Giants Hall of
Famer Willie McCovey, will receive this year's plaque from McCovey
on Sunday. The award recognizes inspiration, courage, leadership,
character and dedication in the tradition of McCovey.

   Ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev, who recently leaped
into the musical theater with ``The King and I,'' said he has no
qualms about taking over a role dominated for years by one actor _
the late Yul Brynner.
   ``I've never been intimidated by anything,'' Nureyev told
reporters Monday.
   ``I danced `Giselle.' Nijinsky danced `Giselle,''' he said,
referring to the late Russian dancer Vaslav Nijinsky, considered one
of the best dancers of all time.
   Nureyev, 51, plays the role of the king of Siam in the revival of
the Rodgers and Hammerstein hit, with British actress Liz Robertson
playing his Anna.
   Ottawa is the second stop of a tour that began in Toronto last
month.
   Nureyev, who has been artistic director of the Paris Opera Ballet
since 1983, said he's enjoying the musical, in which he sings a
couple of songs and must pretend he doesn't know how to polka for
the famous ``Shall We Dance'' number.
   ``I enjoy it very much, yes, I do. It's not as hard as dancing.''

<HEAD>Grapefruit Not Poisonous After All, Ministry Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health officials said Thursday that the blue
substance injected into some grapefruit in Rome was not poisonous,
and they revoked a nationwide ban on sales of the citrus fruit.
   The Health Ministry had ordered a seizure of all grapefruit in
Italy and triggered an alert in 11 other Common Market countries
when they reported Tuesday that they found six grapefruit poisoned
in an apparent act of sabotage aimed at Israeli exports.
   But the ministry said Thursday that lab tests determined the
substance was methylene blue, a non-toxic biological stain also
used as an antidote for cyanide poisoning.
   None of the other grapefruit seized was found to be tainted. It
was not known whether the six tainted grapefruit actually were from
Israel.
   Authorities found the six tainted fruit in a Rome supermarket
after a caller warned a Rome newspaper that grapefruit there had
been poisoned. The caller claimed responsibility for the
``Organization of Metropolitan Proletarians and Oppressed People,''
a group not previously heard of.
   A poster pasted on the outside of the supermarket urged a
boycott of Israeli products.
   The week before, an organization that said it supported the
Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip claimed to
have poisoned Israeli grapefruit on sale in Milan and called for a
boycott of Israeli products. Laboratory checks found no trace of
poison.
   Health Minister Donat Cattin ordered the nationwide seizure when
three laboratory mice died after eating blue pulp from some of the
grapefruit.
   But officials began to doubt the grapefruit had been poisoned
because all the other rats, mice and guinea pigs used in additional
tests on Wednesday survived.
   Health officials speculated that the first three mice may have
died from the fiber in the fruit.
   ``Grapefruit is not a food for mice,'' said Israel Adato, an
Israeli Ministry of Agriculture official sent to Italy to assist in
the inquiry.

<HEAD>Scientist Collars Problem of Barking Dogs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A veterinarian has developed a dog
collar he says can silence chronic barkers with a high-frequency
beep.
   ``It's not an electric shock collar. It will not hurt the dog,''
said Jon Hunter, 48, an associate professor of veterinary
physiology and pharmacology at Texas A&amp;M.
   The device needs fine-tuning and its effectiveness is uncertain,
he said. But the principle is simple.
   When the dog barks, a miniature microphone in the collar emits a
burst of high-intensity sound, startling the animal into silence.
The sound is inaudible to most humans.
   ``It will not be so effective that it will stop dogs from
barking completely,'' Hunter said. ``Many people want their dogs to
bark in order to warn them of intruders.''
   ``The people who have tested the collar have said the collar has
had an immediate effect,'' Hunter said. ``It causes the dog to
become distracted from its barking.''
   Hunter's invention was inspired by his experience as an
11-year-old Missouri farm boy.
   ``We were milking cows and a thunderstorm occurred,'' he said.
``When the thunder occurred, the cattle and dogs would seek
shelter.
   ``Later, in attempting to modify the behavior of animals, I
thought of different sounds that would change an animal's
behavior,'' he said.
   In three years of research, Hunter tried electronic simulation
of thunder, explosions and gunfire. But a high-pitched sound few
humans could hear turned out to be the best antidote.
   Hunter said his collar is more humane than other solutions
owners employ. Some fit their pets with electric-shock collars or
subject them to vocal cord surgery. Others may give them away or
even destroy the animal.
   Hunter said he has a contract with a manufacturer whose name he
wouldn't disclose and hopes to have a model on the market in six
months.
   But, already, Hunter said he has been besieged by pet owners
offering their yelping dogs as guinea pigs to test the collar.
   ``I have people call me and say, `Please give me a collar or
I'll have to put my dog to sleep,''' Hunter said. ``We're trying to
help people as quickly as we can, but they want the collar
tomorrow.''

HAZARDS OF RADIATION

<TEXT>
<P>
It is, of course, outrageous as you pointed out in your editorial "They Were 
Told There Was No Danger" (Oct. 1) that 500 uranium mine workers, an estimated 
150,000 civilians living downwind of atomic bomb tests that were conducted 
during the 1950s and 1960s and the military personnel who were used as guinea 
pigs during those same tests were lied to by the U.S. government regarding the 
hazards of radiation. 
</P>
<P>
It is important to note, though, that we are still being lied to by our 
government and the nuclear industry regarding the safety of nuclear power 
plants and the effects of low-level radiation. 
</P>
<P>
In "Nuclear Witnesses -- Insiders Speak Out," author Leslie J. Freeman 
interviews medical researcher Dr. Rosalie Bertell, medical physicist Dr. John 
W. Gofman and physicist Dr. Ernest J. Sternglass regarding their many years of 
research on the health effects of low-level radiation. All three researchers 
have concluded that there are no "safe" levels of radiation. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the nuclear industry continues to promote the use of radiation in food 
irradiation and medicine, nuclear reactors continue to vent radiation into the 
water and air, and consumer products containing small amounts of radioactive 
materials continue to be introduced. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most insidious and outrageous of all is the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission-approved plan to allow the nuclear industry to petition the NRC for 
permission to dispose of as much as one-third of its low-level radioactive 
waste as "below regulatory concern." This radioactive waste could then be 
disposed of as regular garbage and sent to landfills, incinerators and even 
recycling plants instead of to a properly regulated nuclear-waste disposal 
site.

   Dorothy Spangenberg's laboratory is
jammed with 20,000 jellyfish - four times more than usual - because
of NASA's delay in launching the space shuttle Columbia.
   The biologist from Eastern Virginia Medical School plans to send
2,700 tiny, young jellyfish on a research mission to study their
metamorphosis in a gravity-free environment. Originally scheduled
for August, it was pushed into 1991 when the shuttle sprung
hydrogen leaks.
   Those leaks are fixed now, and NASA plans to launch Columbia in
early December on an astronomy mission. The flight with
Spangenberg's jellyfish, Columbia's next trip, is targeted for May.
   Spangenberg said she needs a large jellyfish supply so there
will be plenty at the right stage of development when it comes time
for the mission. She expects to have more than 25,000 jellyfish by
spring.
   ``I'll just keep growing them until we have enough, although I
don't know how to gauge how much is enough,'' she said. ``We're
going to get as many as we can between now and then.''
   Jellyfish polyps, an early form of the animal and about as long
as the lead tip of a pencil, occupy aquariums, dishes and flasks in
Spangenberg's Norfolk, Va., laboratory. The dishes and flasks are
inside incubators.
   Each container is filled with artificial sea water that lacks
iodine and thus prevents metamorphosis. Polyps can live
indefinitely at that stage in the laboratory and reproduce
continuously.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has sent up
monkeys, chimpanzees, rats, flies, bees, moths, spiders and fish.
The Soviets have carried a wider variety of animals into orbit,
including dogs, tortoises and guinea pigs. Neither country, though,
has ever flown jellyfish in space.
   What makes the marine creature so suitable for a nine-day
shuttle mission is that polyps develop into the more mature ephyra
stage in five to six days when iodine is added to their water.
   Ephyrae mature within four to six months into the final
developmental stage, called medusa. It's the form familiar to most
people - the 4- to 5-pound animals have bells, or humps, tentacles
and long mouth arms.
   Columbia's astronauts will videotape the jellyfish during the
flight, add iodine to the water of some of the specimens, and track
their growth. Spangenberg will analyze the data.
   ``We need a range of organisms to begin to put together a
picture to see if the response (in space) is similar from one
organism to the next,'' said NASA's Gary Jahns, the mission's
payload scientist. ``Jellyfish are a single point in that
picture.''
   The Spacelab life sciences mission, which will include a rat
study and 18 other experiments, originally was scheduled for late
1986, then early 1987. A month after NASA approved Spangenberg's
experiment application in December 1985, Challenger exploded and
the shuttle program ground to a 2{-year halt.
   The delays have proved beneficial for Spangenberg. In October,
she discovered another kind of jellyfish cell in the ephyra, a
gravity receptor that helps the creatures maintain direction and
balance somewhat like the human inner ear.
   Each jellyfish gravity receptor has a sac of calcium sulphate
crystals, just as each inner ear has calcium-containing crystals.
Spangenberg is sending up about 150 ephyrae to see if any calcium
is lost in the weightlessness of space. Thirty white rats on the
shuttle will be observed in a related study.
   Such knowledge is expected to improve scientists' understanding
of calcium loss in astronauts during flight.
   ``The cells of the jellyfish are basically very similar to cells
of higher animals,'' Spangenberg said. ``I look at them as a good
model system for the study of a variety of biological problems.''

   Roger Olson has a lot of sympathy for guinea pigs.
   The McDonnell Douglas Corp. material-support analyst was
among those who volunteered to participate in evacuation
drills on a new jetliner model being tested in Long Beach,
Calif. A toe fracture was the worst that had happened in past
drills, they were told. But when 410 people surged on command
toward the exits of the pitch-black MD-11, chaos resulted.
Mr. Olson, crashing into a mass of bodies as he slid down the
inflatable escape chute, felt his left ankle snap. "I tried
to stand up, but I couldn't," he recalls.

   During the now-notorious tests last October, 50 people
were hurt, including seven with broken bones and one
60-year-old woman who was left paralyzed, perhaps
permanently, from the neck down. The experience has shocked
aircraft makers into reconsidering the practice of using
people in such testing; McDonnell Douglas and Boeing Co. both
are clamoring for government permission to use computer
simulations in many of the tests. And Anthony Broderick, in
charge of regulation and certification for the Federal
Aviation Administration, says the agency is also studying the
use of modified, less-dangerous human testing.
   But the ill-fated drills do raise questions about whether
any use of employees in product testing -- still fairly
common among auto makers and some other manufacturers and
consumer-product companies -- makes sense.
   "To just bring people off the production line or the sales
staff for product testing is a bad idea," says Mark
Rothstein, a University of Houston law professor and
specialist in occupational-health and employment law. And
employee morale really suffers if there's an accident.
Employees "would say things like, `Hey, did you hear about
Harry? He volunteered for a test, and he's in the hospital
now.'"
   Safety issues aside, critics suggest that asking employees
to raise their hands for product tests implies subtle
pressure. "When it comes time for your promotion, workers
will have to believe it will be taken into consideration. And
it probably is," says Sidney Wolfe, director of the
health-research group of Public Citizen, a consumer-advocacy
group active in workplace-safety issues. He notes that
pharmaceutical companies were legally prohibited years ago
from using prisoners to test as-yet-unapproved drugs, in part
because the voluntary nature of the activity was undercut by
inmate hopes that they might qualify for early parole.
   "It's an unethical practice, and moral companies shouldn't
tolerate it," says Joseph Kinney, executive director of the
nonprofit National Safe Workplace Institute.
   And David Stewart, a University of Southern California
marketing professor specializing in consumer behavior,
believes that in any event workers may be poor test
participants, in part because of their lack of objectivity.
"They aren't typical of how the average consumer might
interact with the product," he says. If, say, you're testing
a computer keyboard, and "all your employees are wizards on
the things, that may not be representative."
   However, Bruce Lee, Western regional director for the
United Auto Workers, which opposes McDonnell Douglas's new
stance against most employee tests, says: "Using employees
makes a lot of sense. People who make the products might be
able to improve the system they are trying to test."
   A General Motors Corp. spokesman says GM uses employees
"all over the place" for human-factors testing, and Ford
Motor Co.'s human-factors division is responsible for a
number of product changes, a Ford spokesman says. Based on
employee testing of its 1992 Taurus and Mercury Sable models,
Ford enlarged their radio push buttons and moved the volume
and station-seek knobs closer to the steering wheel.
   It's considered to be "just part of your job," the
spokesman says. "We always figure that you're happy to help
out the company." In fact, he adds, Ford secretaries are
often asked to drive in cross-country testing, because "you
don't always want the opinion of engineers."
   While some auto-industry testing with employees is rather
mundane, contributions to dashboard and seat-belt design can
have positive safety implications.
   Chrysler Corp.'s Jeep development team, while leaving the
toughest safety tests to dummies and professional test
drivers, maintains a data base containing names and
anatomical descriptions of scores of volunteers who help test
various Jeep designs.
   Several weeks ago, about 50 employees went to Chrysler's
Chelsea, Mich., proving ground, an hour from Detroit
headquarters. The test that day: taking Jeep mockups off-road
to see how functional the dash arrangement was in rough
driving conditions. The employee-drivers found some knobs too
small, and heater and radio controls placed too far away.
Earlier, employees at the site had found that off-road
bouncing triggered the Jeep's automatic seat-belt locking
device too easily. The design team readjusted it.
   Tall and short employees are especially prized for
testing, although Craig Winn, executive engineer for Jeep
development, shrugs off the idea that such individuals might
be pressured to participate because of physique. "People
really enjoy participating beyond their basic job function,"
he says. And employees are drawn by the idea that "someone
really cares where I think the steering wheel should be."
   Neither does the source of their paychecks seem to make
volunteers shy about their concerns, Mr. Winn says. In fact,
"we get into some good fights," he says, when volunteers spew
criticism of a vehicle in front of its designers.
   Outside the auto industry, Walt Disney Co. fine-tunes
theme-park rides by putting employees on board. "They know
what they are looking for," says a spokeswoman. And toy maker
Fisher-Price Inc. lets employees' children loose in an East
Aurora, N.Y., "play-lab" brimming with prototype toys. Behind
a two-way mirror there, a spokesman says, designers watch the
kids enjoy their toy creations, ignore them, or worse yet,
pick them up and proclaim: "This stinks."
   Similarly, Wilson Sporting Goods Co., River Grove, Ill.,
asks employees to help test its prototype tennis rackets,
golf clubs, and team-sports equipment on weekends or after
work. The company's successful "Hammer" tennis racket, which
went through 30 prototype designs before hitting the market
one year ago, especially benefited from employee testing.
"You can tell in a hurry if you have a dog, and not waste
your time testing it with consumers," says Frank Garrett,
director of racket-sports technology. Wilson is a unit of
Amer Group Ltd., of Finland.
   Brown-Forman Corp., Louisville, Ky., gives "points" to
employees who volunteer for tasting panels for liquor and
other products -- the points are redeemable at its cafeteria
and at a store where luggage, giftware and china are sold.
(Tasting rules require that the liquor products be spit out,
not consumed.) "They are employees who come in on their own
free will," says David Lundahl, the company's manager of
sensory and statistical research. Top tasters also get
monthly prizes.
   Aircraft makers testing evacuation times for their cabins
have used employees in the past to help provide the
population cross section that federal regulations require.
But those rules may be about to change. California's Division
of Occupational Safety and Health has ordered McDonnell
Douglas not to reschedule the MD-11 drill, at least until it
proves that employees won't be hurt.
   Self-described "company man" Mr. Olson, who was injured in
the last test, isn't sure whether McDonnell Douglas should
use employees or a computer model. But he's sure of one
thing: "I would never volunteer again."

<HEAD>Doctors Urged to Take Up Defense Use of Animals in Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Medical Association today urged
doctors to take a more active role in their communities to ensure
fairness in the debate over the use of animals in research.
   In a commentary in the Journal of the AMA, the association
cautioned that erosion of public support for the use of research
animals poses as great a threat as pending legislation or
regulatory efforts.
   ``When people are given the entire picture, when they're
reminded that research animals played a crucial role in the
development of vaccines ... and heart transplants and antibiotics,
there is clearly backing for this position,'' said William Hendee,
AMA vice president for science and technology.
   ``But those opposed to the practice are starting now at the
local level, aiming programs at schoolchildren. It's in those
situations that we're appealing to doctors and scientists to come
forward, to make sure both sides of the debate are presented,''
said Hendee, who wrote the commentary with Stephen Smith, a senior
scientist with the association's Department of Drugs.
   The congressional Office of Technology Assessment estimates that
17 million to 22 million animals are used annually in biomedical
experiments, and that 75 percent to 90 percent of them are rodents:
rats, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs and rabbits.
   Dogs, cats and primates make up less than 5 percent of the
remainder.
   Primates are obtained from breeders or, in some cases, are bred
by research facilities. Dogs and cats are obtained from pounds or
from special breeders.
   Sixty percent of the experiments each year do not result in any
suffering by the animal, and animals receive painkilling drugs or
anesthesia in 32 percent of the cases, Smith said. Pain is
inflicted on the experimental animal in 8 percent of the
experiments, he added.
   Spokeswoman Jeanne Roush of People for Ethical Treatment of
Animals, a Washington-based animal-rights organization, said the
appeal shows ``the AMA is running scared.
   ``They simply realize animal-rights groups are gaining momentum
... that medical students and even doctors are less and less
inclined to take part in these experiments,'' Ms. Roush said.
   ``They should begin seriously looking at alternatives (to
animals) and phasing this practice out completely,'' she said.
``That's what people want.''
   The AMA authors said researchers are barred from using pound
animals in some places, and that such prohibitions are being
considered elsewhere.
   A complete ban would drive up research costs by $90 million
annually, they estimated.
   Most of the millions of animals consigned to pounds are
destroyed, he said. Less than 3 percent of those are research
animals, according to the commentary.

   Scientists have found specialized nerve sites
where a natural pain-causing substance attaches itself, adding
evidence that the substance plays a key role in the body's
perception of pain.
   Molecules of the substance, bradykinin, bound to the nerve sites
in experiments with dog and guinea pig nerve tissue, scientists
said in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
   Bradykinin is released from bodily tissues when they are
injured. Researchers reported last year that drugs designed to
block the binding of bradykinin to nerve sites could relieve pain
in rats.
   Scientists in the new study included Solomon Snyder and Donald
Manning of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in Baltimore,
Larry Steranka of Nova Pharmaceutical Corp., and Raymond Vavrek and
John Stewart of the University of Colorado.
   Researchers incubated slices of animal spinal cord and other
nerve tissues with bradykinin that had been labeled with a
radioactive isotope for easy tracking. Tests showed the bradykinin
bound to particular sites, called receptors, on sensory nerves that
carry pain messages.

<HEAD>Survey: Three-Fourths Of Public Favor Animal Research For Medical
Progress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of an animal rights group says she's not
impressed by a poll which found that 77 percent of Americans
believe medical progress depends on the use of animals in research.
   ``It's hardly an unbiased survey, I must say,'' said Ingrid
Newkirk, director of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
   Ms. Newkirk considers the poll, commissioned by the American
Medical Association, a public relations ploy, saying the money
could have been put to greater use by improving the living
conditions of laboratory animals.
   Results of the survey, conducted in February by Tarrance-SRI of
Houston, were reported in today's edition of American Medical News,
the weekly newspaper of the AMA.
   Of 1,500 adults surveyed nationwide, 77 percent said they
believed the use of animals in medical research is necessary, while
17 percent disagreed and 6 percent weren't sure, the AMA reported.
   Support of animal research appeared to grow with education and
income level, the poll found. Of respondents with annual incomes of
at least $30,000, 83 percent approved of the research.
   Respondents were surveyed by telephone in a random sample of
residential listings in the United States. The margin of error was
plus or minus 2.5 percent, the AMA said.
   ``The overwhelming positive response to our survey question
indicates to me that a vast majority of the American public
recognizes the benefits their families enjoy with today's modern
medicines, which were made possible by animal research,'' said Dr.
James H. Sammons, AMA executive vice president.
   ``The American Medical Association has been and will continue to
be a very vocal proponent of responsible _ and let me emphasize
responsible _ use of animals in medical research.''
   Ms. Newkirk said the poll was nothing but an attempt ``to turn
back the growing tide of public opinion that animals need some
protection in the lab.'' Her private, not-for-profit group, based
in Washington, D.C., has 150,000 members.
   She accused the AMA of leading ``the fight to defeat all
legislation on Capitol Hill, no matter how minimal, that would
affect the living and dying conditions of animals.''
   Dr. M. Roy Schwarz countered Newkirk's charge that the poll was
biased, saying ``we certainly would stand behind'' the findings.
   Schwarz, the AMA's assistant executive vice president for
medical education and science, also denied that the AMA has tried
to thwart efforts to protect laboratory animals.
   He said the organization is supporting revision of Department of
Agriculture guidelines to set higher standards and force
improvement in animal facilities.
   Newkirk said the immediate goal of her group is to eliminate
``gratuitous cruelty'' to animals, including the testing of
cosmetics, and eventually hopes to end all animal lab testing.
   The congressional Office of Technology Assessment estimates that
between 17 million and 22 million animals are used annually in
biomedical experiments, and that 75 percent to 90 percent are
rodents _ rats, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs and rabbbits.
   Dogs, cats and primates make up less than 5 percent with fish,
amphibians and birds making up the rest.
   Sixty percent of the experiments cause no suffering to the
animal, and in 32 percent of cases, animals receive pain-killing
drugs or anesthesia, according to Stephen Smith, a senior scientist
with the AMA Department of Drugs division of drugs and toxicology.
In 8 percent of cases, the animal does suffer pain, he said.

  [Abstract] Experimental trials were conducted on 80-100 
guinea pigs with interscapular wounds infected with 10E9 E. coli 
K-11 cells to assess the therapeutic efficacy of a special 
surgical dressing. The latter consisted of dioxydin or 
terrilytin impregnated hydrophilic materials (HM; Ekran 
Scientific Industrial Association). Actual treatment consisted 
of application of the terrilytin-HM on the wound surface, 
followed by an overlay of the dioxydin-HM dressing. The results 
showed that the special combined HM dressing led to wound 
sterilization in 3 days (0% mortality) , vs. 14 days in 
control 
animals (33% mortality) managed in a conventional manner. 
Clinical benefits with the combined dressing also exceeded those 
of dioxydin-HM dressing alone. However, although the length of 
time required for complete epithiliazation did not differ in the 
control and experimental groups, these observations suggest that 
the combined HM may have application in human medicine in 
controlling wound infections. Tables 3; references 3 (Russian).

<HEAD>Group Asks: Who Killed The Easter Bunny?</HEAD>

   An animal rights group, pegging its protest to
the Easter holiday, said Friday that more than half a million
rabbits are killed annually in cosmetics testing laboratories.
   Volunteers from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals,
clad in hooded black robes representing the ``grim reapers'' of
companies they say slaughter rabbits, carried a bloodied toy rabbit
in a satin coffin and shouted, ``Have a cruelty-free holiday!''
   The 20 PETA protesters marched outside the headquarters of the
270-member Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association in downtown
Washington, but police did not allow them to enter the building.
   ``Consumers don't realize that 530,000 cute, cuddly rabbits ...
our symbol of Easter ... are abused by industry, especially
cosmetics industries, every year,'' said Kathy Snow Guillermo,
PETA's Compassion Campaign director.
   Irene Malbin, a CTFA spokeswoman, said her organization believes
PETA is missing the point.
   ``We put human health and safety before anything else,'' she
said in a telephone interview. ``We don't believe our children
should be guinea pigs.''
