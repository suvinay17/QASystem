   RANOMAFANA, Madagascar -- It is a good morning in the rain
forest. The drizzle is light, the leeches are few and the
lemurs, bounding from tree to tree, are as happy as ever. So,
too, is their guardian, primatologist Patricia Wright, as she
returns to her cabin with two mouse lemurs, captured in small
metal boxes.
   The measuring begins. Left ear, three-quarters of an inch.
Tail, four inches. Right testicle, 0.4 inch. The littlest
lemur squirms in the palm of his inspector's hand. He is put
in a bag attached to a scale. Weight, 1 1/2 ounces.

<TEXT>
   "They're the smallest primates in the world," says Ms.
Wright, her voice full of wonder.
   No sooner are the mouse lemurs sent scampering back to the
forest than a short, thin man with a big, wide smile enters
the cabin. He is Nala Edouard, the barefoot president of
Ambatolahy, a village of 31 peasant families on the edge of
the forest. His people, along with those in other villages,
have agreed to stop cutting down the trees, which amounts to
putting a hold on their agricultural expansion, in return for
development aid -- and a school. Now he has come to collect.
Again, Ms. Wright takes out her tape-measure, this time to
outline the foundation of the school she has promised them.
   "I walk into the forest and then into politics and then
back into the forest again," laughs the primatologist, a
professor at Duke University. "It's hard to even get my
clothes straight." The day before, she showed up at a meeting
with local officials in her knee-high mud boots. "I forgot,"
she says with slight embarrassment, "to change into my
shoes."
   So it goes in the quixotic quest to strike a balance
between conservation and development, in a country that
doesn't have enough money for either.
   Madagascar, an achingly beautiful island off the southeast
coast of Africa, is a land of sweeping distinctions: It is at
once one of the world's richest countries and one of its
poorest. It is also the most eroded spot on earth.
   The island's wealth is in its unique biological diversity.
Scientists estimate that 150,000 of the 200,000 identified
living things on Madagascar, which broke off from the African
mainland 160 million years ago, are found nowhere else. This
is true of its 13 species of lemurs -- ranging from the teddy
bear-faced indri, which begins and ends each day with a wail
that sounds like someone learning to play the clarinet, to
the tiny microcebus, a furry Kewpie doll with Bette Davis
eyes. The rosy periwinkle, a plant that produces the most
effective agent in combating childhood leukemia, is a native.
So are two-thirds of the world's chameleons and most of its
orchids.
   Yet Madagascar is pitifully poor, ranking among the
world's 10 most impoverished countries. Its 11 million
people, most of them farmers, have an average annual income
of $210. The government, in contrast, owes its international
creditors $283 per person. Women live an average of 55 years,
men 52. Of every 1,000 babies born, 122 die before their
first birthday. Still, the population grows by 3% a year. To
keep up, the Malagasy relentlessly push back the forest to
expand rice production.
   Through generations of such slash-and-burn agriculture,
the Malagasy have in effect been committing national suicide.
Eighty percent of the island's original forest is gone. From
the air, Madagascar looks as if is bleeding to death; its
rivers, red with eroded topsoil, spill into the Indian Ocean.
Already, 14 species of lemurs have become extinct, along with
the legendary "elephant bird" that reportedly stood 10 feet
tall, two giant turtles, an aardvark, a pygmy hippopotamus
and an unknown number of plants. Scientists say that if the
current pace of deforestation continues, in 20 to 40 years
the Malagasy themselves will be added to the list.
   "Yes, the lemurs are important. But the major species
under threat in Madagascar is the Malagasy," says Jose
Bronfman, the World Bank representative here. "Their major
source of life, the soil, is going into the sea."
   But from these barren hillsides and gaping gullies has
emerged an African rarity: Man and nature -- and their First
World surrogates, development experts and conservationists --
have become allies.
   "The environment will be saved if we reduce poverty," Mr.
Bronfman, a developmentalist, tells the conservationists.
"And poverty will be reduced if you save the environment."
   This elementary equation is the foundation of an ambitious
15-year environmental action plan drawn up by the Malagasy
government and a consortium of donor agencies from around the
world. Stamped on every page is an equally simple and
neglected principle: The Malagasy must be involved in their
own salvation.
   With the help of colleagues in the U.S., Ms. Wright
persuaded the Malagasy government to set aside 103,000 acres
of rain forest as the Ranomafana National Park. But, with 90%
of the local peasants' income coming from the forest -- from
freshwater crayfish and eels, wild fruit, honey, reeds for
weaving and from jobs as timber porters for the logging
companies -- laws wouldn't be enough to keep them out.
   "Our parents and grandparents taught us where to go in the
forest to make our living," says Jean Rafidison, a
29-year-old park guide who sells nuts and beans from the
forest on the side. "If you want us to stay out of the
forest, you must teach us, little by little, how to do things
differently."
   Little by little, Prof. Wright and her team of
researchers, backed with $3.4 million from the U.S. Agency
for International Development, are succeeding. Amid the
cluster of mud huts at the entrance to the park stands a
bamboo snack bar, where local peasants serve Coca-Cola. They
are learning that tourists, attracted by the forest and the
lemurs, bring money.
   While some researchers count lemurs and birds, others
count malnourished children. Some measure snails and geckos,
while others plan dams for irrigation and hydroelectricity. A
scientist from the Smithsonian Institution identifies 40,000
different insects in three weeks; a student from Duke hands
out conservation cartoons to the children.
   Up at the cabin, Prof. Wright slips into a pair of dress
loafers. It is time to visit the villagers at Sahavondronona.
   The elders are waiting on the hillside. They don't
understand the fuss over the lemurs -- "Don't you have them
in America?" asks one with a toothless grin -- but they trust
the woman who is bringing them a school.
   Pierre Rakotomanga, the village leader, says his people,
all 154 of them, are looking forward to a visit from the
American experts who can teach them to raise chickens and
pigs, and to extend the life of their rice paddies.
   His people have stopped pushing back the forest, he says,
but the need for food grows. Philomene Ravaoarisoa, mother of
11 children, steps forward to demonstrate. She rolls back the
frayed sleeves of her orange sweater and picks up the loose,
wrinkled skin of her boney right arm. "I'm getting thinner,"
she says. "My family is growing but the rice is the same."
   Still, when it came to picking a top development priority,
the villagers voted for a school. "We cannot eat a school,"
jokes Mr. Rakotomanga, "but it will educate our children.
They will learn how to live with the forest."
   Prof. Wright leaves with a broad smile. "We will furnish
the school, and put up posters of lemurs," she says
excitedly, bouncing down a gravel road on her way back to the
forest. "When you see lemurs when you are five, you remember
them all your life."

<TEXT>     Among the nearly 2 million items the Smithsonian added to its collections
last year: 30 live Arboreal Day geckos from Madagascar; a 16th-century Chinese
scroll called "Leaping Carp"; a 19th-century throne of the HeHe people of
Tanzania carved in the form of a female torso; a clarinet owned by Benny
Goodman; and Bruce Larson's 4,000-horsepower Oldsmobile Cutlass "funny car,"
which won the National Hot Rod Association's World Championship in 1989.;   
Some of those items sound funny, but the collections are serious business.
Curators for the Smithsonian Institution -- 16 museums and galleries (plus the
National Zoo) in Washington, D.C. -- are always trying to fill gaps in the
collections with items of artistic, historic or scientific interest.;   
William Withuhn, curator of transportation in the American History Museum,
says the museum is trying to get some choice race cars from just before and
after World War II, as well as trying to keep up with the latest technology in
electric and solar cars.;    Although 1990 marked the end of a decade, the
acquisitions don't represent any special effort to round out the period, says
John Barrat, a spokesman for the Smithsonian, the world's largest complex of
museums.;    "Election years are among the most important because of all the
election paraphernalia," he says.;    The list of 1990 acquisitions includes
items that are significant for widely different reasons.;    A treasured
addition this year is a collection of more than 1 million artifacts from the
Museum of the American Indian in New York City. The carvings, masks, dolls,
baskets, jewelry and other items will form the foundation of the Smithsonian's
American Indian museum, which is to open by the turn of the century.;    The
aforementioned 14,000 neo-tropical mosquitoes, all mounted and identified,
will be used to study mosquito-transmitted diseases. They and the threadworms,
along with the samples of woolly mammoth hair and intestinal contents (we can
thank the Soviet Union for the latter) go into the Museum of Natural History.;
   In the Air and Space Museum are two nuclear missiles -- a Soviet SS20 and a
U.S. Pershing II, both banned under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
Treaty. They stand side by side -- defused.;    Many of the items are donated;
others are bought. The Smithsonian displays relatively few of its 139 million
or so items. Some are studied by scholars; some are loaned to other museums.  </TEXT>

FT  14 MAR 92 / Travel: Once bitten by the Borneo bug
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SMALL BLACK ants dismembered a white moth and hauled the wings down a dark
crack in the wooden floor. Pale-bodied geckos stalked the walls of the hut,
while a generator hammered into the forest night at the foot of Gunung Mulu
mountain, the base for exploring limestone caves tucked behind the Brunei
border in Sarawak, eastern Malaysia.
The Gunung Mulu caves are among the largest in the world, but little-known
and little-explored. They lie a day's journey up the Batang Baram river from
the coastal town of Miri in northern Sarawak, although both the journey-time
and the adventure will diminish when an airstrip and multi-storey hotel open
in the Gunung Mulu National Park this year.
Tourists can already fly half-way to the caves. A 20-minute flight from Miri
to the river town of Marudi replaces a jarring three-hour trip by express
boat. VIPs and executives hire helicopters, but the rest of the population
travels through the rain forest as it always has done - up the Batang Baram
river, which follows the border with Brunei.
The express boats travel at great speeds, powered by enormous Cummins
diesels. Air-conditioned passengers recline inside a claustrophobic steel
cabin, which has only two narrow exits, usually blocked by bags, chickens,
suitcases and the odd 4 ft blowpipe.
I preferred to sit on the roof, watching the green forest roar by.
The express boat nosed into the river bank at remote logging camps, picking
up passengers and dropping off cardboard boxes of supplies, before hurtling
up the loops and whirls of the river.
Our helmsman, who peered out of a tiny cockpit at the prow of the express,
missed a stray log. It hit the hull with a bang and damaged the propeller.
The boat wallowed in the brown water until we were rescued and transferred,
in mid-stream, to another express.
The expresses travel up-river until it is too shallow. At the small
settlement of Long Panai, where a long house and huts stood in a clearing by
the river, I was bundled off the express and into a small wooden boat. Nixon
the driver gunned an enormous outboard motor and the cockleshell shot
between rocks and branches. Cold rain beat into my face and misty clouds
hung round the peaks of Gunung Mulu.
Where it is protected, virgin rain forest soars into the air, the
straight-boled trees forming a natural canopy. But where the trees have been
logged outside Sarawak's parks, a tangle of matted vegetation forms as
secondary forest - assumed by most visitors to be natural rain forest.
My guide, Richard, took me to Clearwater cave, where a very loud party of
Chinese tourists were eating lunch on raised wooden walkways. Away from the
noise and inside the looming darkness stood stalagmites and limestone
formations. Cockroaches burrowed into rock-hard piles of guano. The stench
of ammonia filled the air. Bats hung in their thousands overhead. Richard
picked up a squirming millipede and squashed it, his hand glowing from a
luminous secretion.
The caves are vast, but huge caverns like the Sarawak Chamber are only
accessible to serious cavers. At Deer Cave we left the tourists behind and
set off for the Garden of Eden. We walked for half-an-hour up and down a
wooden walkway on the floor of the cave, and scrambled over slippery
boulders. Eden was a cold river with crystal water, towering trees and a
soaring cliff face. That evening we waited for the bats to fly out from the
cave to begin their nocturnal search for food, but they weren't playing.
I returned to Miri by boat and travelled by bus to Batu Niah, 100 kms south
along the main road which follows the Sarawak coast. The Niah caves excited
great interest when its Painted Cave yielded the remains of 40,000-year-old
Homo sapiens, although the site is now sadly neglected behind a crude barbed
wire fence. Ancient orange paintings surround the remains of wooden ships of
the dead, but the wooden boats are breaking up, apparently forgotten by the
park authorities.
Official permits are solemnly issued at park headquarters, but not a guide
was to be seen anywhere on the sweaty 3 kms walk to the caves themselves. A
high steel fence bars a narrow entrance to the caves and is meant to deter
illegal nest collecting. But the gate in the fence is unlocked, and the
nests of swiftlets are collected day and night.
Young boys swarmed up flimsy bamboo poles and scaffolding to scrape the
nests from the roof of the caves. Their helpers, up to 100 m below, collect
the glutinous fragments in plastic bags. The floor of the cave was littered
with the collectors' old batteries and torch bulbs.
Modern Malaysia and the tourist industry is removing the mystery from Borneo
 -the swiftlets are almost certainly decreasing in numbers. But ancient
Borneo is not quite finished. A friendly insect fell down my shirt and
squirted burning acid on to my shoulder. A black scab formed, unalleviated
by the Axeoil potion carried by my Malaysian companion. It was the bite of
the Borneo love-bug, he said. The mark has yet to fade.

<DESCRIPT>  SEX; SCIENCE; QA  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  WHY AREN'T THERE THREE SEXES? Or a hundred sexes? Why are there just two
sexes?;   WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO IMAGINE what a third sex would look like.
Michael Jackson, maybe?  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  West  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  THAT'S WHY
SEX: ONE OF THE GAMES GAMETES PLAY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     What exactly is a "male," anyway? Other than an organism that takes out the
garbage? The answer is: an organism with lots of tiny, motile gametes. That's
right! Men have incredibly small gametes, not that they'd ever admit to it. A
female produces large gametes. Eggs, basically. Gametes are sex cells. A human
female is born with a couple of million gametes, but during her lifetime only
about 400 of them come into play. A male produces billions of gametes (sperm).
This pattern -- one sex producing a few big sex cells, the other producing
zillions of small ones -- exists throughout the biological world.;   The
reason there's not a third sex is that two sexes are plenty enough to make
life complicated. Sexual reproduction on the planet seems to be designed to
mix up genes and recombine them. This variability allows the process of
natural selection to sort through genes, reward the well-adapted, punish the
geeks, and keep evolution cranking. You can get an almost infinite combination
of genes through two sexes, so there's no advantage in having a third sex.;  
Some species have only one sex, and they reproduce just fine by
parthenogenesis. The mothers spit out daughters that are genetic duplicates --
clones. An aphid, for example, can start an infestation of your garden all by
itself -- it reproduces by cloning. Some types of geckos employ
parthenogenesis, too. (Parents who are squeamish about telling their kids
where babies come from should just talk about "the geckos and the aphids.");  
Cloning doesn't allow for much genetic variety, and so sex is a more common
way to reproduce. But many species are hermaphroditic. They are both male and
female. Many flowering plants are hermaphrodites. So why aren't we all
hermaphroditic? Wouldn't that be a lot less of a hassle?;   The answer is: If
you possess both sexual characteristics, sometimes you will fertilize
yourself. This can create genetic defects. "You can pay a severe penalty for
self-fertilization," warns Brian Charlesworth, professor of ecology and
evolution at the University of Chicago. So be careful what you do with
yourself. You could go blind.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  BY NOW, even the polyester set must know the last trace of romance in this

MUCH OF THE ROMANCE IS GONE, BUT AMID THE LOUD
TOURISTS AND SHAMELESSLY HUSTLING NATIVES, A TRACE
OF BEAUTY CAN STILL BE FOUND  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Story; Additional information attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Worse yet, now even the tourists are fleeing in droves from Kuta's
overcrowding, spreading the plague of frantic commerce throughout Bali.
There's hardly a remotely appealing beach or rice field that, in Noel Coward's
words, "does not recoil from suntan oil and the gurgle of Coca-Cola." Even in
Lovina, all the way on the northern coast, one can now buy playful,
anatomically correct dolls of the kind favored by Dan Quayle.;   Come to Bali
expecting pristine nature -- and natives -- and you'll leave Bali depressed.
By now, most intercultural experiences are cash-on-the-line.;   That said, the
surprise is that Bali still has enough elusive grace, outside Kuta, to merit
exploration. It takes patience, energy, a sense of humor -- but as ever, not
much money.;   Arriving for a three-week visit in July, my husband, Jack, and
I were initially horrified by the over-saturation of Large Loud White People.
The horror was greater, however, for Jack, a traveler of consummate political
correctness who likes his vacations in places like Nicaragua's Corn Islands
(under the Sandinistas) and Brazil's remote Fernando de Noronha, a kind of
mini-Galapagos where you cower, nightly, from exotic and probably venomous
bugs in your lodgings in private homes. I confess my own dismay in Bali was
soon tempered by eating lots of cheap, delicious satays and staying in
tranquil, immaculate bungalows where handsome Balinese men roused us from
sleep with steaming Java, fresh papaya and honey-drenched banana pancakes.;  
Fragrant bargains; Still, even in Kuta, we soon discovered pleasures not
explicitly designed to extract dollars. Dodging the motorcycles downtown, we
caught whiffs of cloves, frangipani and incense, surviving like half-forgotten
dreams beneath the clouds of carbon dioxide, and watched women in bright
sarongs wend their way through traffic to place offerings of flowers and fruit
at busy intersections. Bali, the exception in Indonesia's mostly Muslim
archipelago, is predominantly Hindu, and filled with intricate stone-carved
temples. On Kuta's busiest streets, stone deities on temple gates gaze blankly
at hordes of passing tourists, stumbling out of surfer taverns. They must be
wondering, just as Coward once wondered, "What compulsion compels them, and
who the hell tells them, to drag their cans to Zanzibar, instead of sitting
quietly in Omaha?";   The newer Poppies cottages (there are two sets) provided
refuge and consolation after a stroll along the beach, which I not only had to
pay for, but where one woman cursed me and all my ancestors and potential
offspring after I politely declined to buy a massage. The hotel is small and
refined, with the thatched-roofed cottages surrounding a garden and swimming
pool decorated with statues of imps.;   Mick's marriage; After a day, it was
time to move on. We paid a private driver $15 (about $5 too much) for a
90-minute journey to the inland village of Ubud, stopping on the way in Mas,
the nearby wood-carving village.;   Ubud, at first, carried bitter reminders
of Kuta. Friends had raved about its beauty and quiet -- Mick Jagger had even
gotten married there -- but the village has grown so quickly in the past two
years that inns, shops and restaurants now jam Monkey Forest Road, the
principal thoroughfare, and the revving of motorcycle engines is heard late
into the night.;   Nonetheless, we soon found Ubud was worth some lingering,
especially after a room opened at the Ulun-Ubud cottages, an inn about three
miles up from the monkey forest and far from the hubbub. The cottages cling to
a cliff overlooking the deep gorge of the Campuhan river and terraced rice
fields. By night, geckos sang us to sleep.;   By day, we took walks along the
stunning green rice terraces surrounding the village, watching duck shepherds
tend their flocks, and, one day, thousands of herons returning by twilight to
their forest. (Even there, we found the obligatory crafts stand, next to a
sign reading, "Best Place to View the Herons.") We also strolled through the
monkey forest, the domain of a large, aggressive tribe of apes.;   A Genuine
Contact;   One afternoon, having strayed far from Ubud's tourist core, we were
passing a temple in the rice fields when a sweet-faced young man with a flower
behind his ear asked us, in rough English, over to his house. Following the
man, Wayan -- the given name for a family's first child -- I could barely
contain myself; we were about to have a Genuine Contact with a Balinese. We
hiked to his home, far into the forest. He gave us tea, and then hustled us
unmercifully to buy some of his wood carvings.;   On other days, we spent
shameful amounts of time in restaurants. Ubud is crowded with peaceful cafes
where you can dine in splendor on Indonesian curries, seafood or even lasagna
with banana wine or the more straightforward arak for the equivalent of $2 or
$3. We also consumed several hours searching for the perfect shadow puppet.;  
Had we not been so busy taking naps on our terrace, we would surely also have
explored Ubud's much-praised museums and meditation center, and I would have
returned to Mas to take a mask-carving class.;   From Ubud, we hired a car for
the two-hour drive north to Lake Batur, which is to backpackers what Ubud is
to jet-setters. We stayed at the Art Center in the village of Toya Bungkah,
where a very basic but clean room cost us $20, and where we stumbled on a
local dance troupe of young girls led by a brilliant male teacher, rehearsing
Legong dances. It cost nothing to watch and was enchanting.;   The next day,
at 4 a.m., we set out with a guide, a broken flashlight and a bottle of water
to climb Mount Batur, the active volcano that towers over the lake. Our guide
entertained us almost the entire time by singing one off-key verse from
"Clementine.";   By sunrise, 5,000 feet and 2 1/2 hours later, we had just
made it to the top, to watch the spectacular play of orange and amethyst light
breaking over the lake, and Mount Abang, facing us. We could also see the tip
of Mount Rinjani on nearby Lombok Island, poking through clouds across the
sea. After the trip down, we soothed our aching joints in the hot springs near
the lake, where a troop of single-minded little girls massaged my shoulders,
then insisted I buy over-priced biscuits.;   Soon, two weeks had gone by. We
were both tired of being money belts with legs. So we boarded a dilapidated
ferry for a four-hour journey across the Java Sea to Lombok. Indonesia's
government would have been pleased: In the past few years, even Jakarta has
begun to recognize that Bali is over-visited, and has campaigned to get
tourists to explore other islands.;   Arriving late in the evening, we had
time for only glimpses of the island, with its starkly different atmosphere --
much poorer and more hard-bitten than Bali. We checked into the enormous
Sengiggi Beach Hotel, the government's most determined tourist project on
Lombok, and immediately regretted it. A 155-room enclave of bland modernity,
it was also inexcusably overpriced ($85 for a tiny cottage and mini-bar). Jack
began to mutter and didn't stop until the next morning, when we found a driver
and took off for Bangsal Harbor, to catch a prahu, a traditional outrigger
boat, bound for the tiny coral atoll of Gili Air, off Lombok's northwest
coast.;   Gili Air was the ticket: clear green water for snorkeling amid blue
and white coral forests, utter quiet, but for the periodic prayer calls of the
muezzins, and spectacular sunsets. And the best: lodgings we both loved. Most
accommodations on the island are simple, thatched-roof bungalows on stilts,
with Asian toilets and showers outside. But walking on the coast, we came
across a sign advertising a house for rent. The bungalow was large and lovely,
furnished in Balinese chic, with a garden in the bathroom and a wide,
bamboo-curtained terrace facing the sea. Three times a day, a shy Malay cook
named Su'ad, straight out of Joseph Conrad, would appear wordlessly with
elaborate and tasty meals. All for $25 a day.;   We would have retired then
and there but for the sudden appearance of the owner, a German shock
therapist, with half a dozen guests and twice as many suitcases. We were cast
out, and -- the cruelest shock of all -- we heard him mention, as we left, how
he and his brother intend soon to build a whole complex of cottages along Gili
Air's coast.; If you go . . .; (check) Travel Information; High season is all
year around, but the dry season is generally from April to September. No visa
is required for a stay of less than two months throughout Indonesia.
Immigration agents will, however, ask to see a passport and a return ticket.; 
 Indonesia's national airline, Garuda, has a direct flight from Los Angeles to
Denpasar, Bali. If that is booked and you need to shop around, Community
Travel in Berkeley, (415) 653-0990, can probably get discount flights.;

$56 plus 15 percent tax. In Ubud, the Ulun-Ubud cottages can be reserved by
writing P.O. Box 333, Denpasar, Bali 80001. Rates are $55 for a
double-occupancy bungalow and $85 for a suite. Includes breakfast. Also in
Ubud are the new Pringga Juwita Water Garden cottages, where you can rent
spacious and exotic two-story, open-air bungalows for $55.;   (check) ETC. --

<LEADPARA>  IF CHRISTOPHER Columbus had seen the cabins of the Bayman Bay Club nestled in
the lush hillside when he anchored in the azure waters off the island of
Guanaja in the summer of 1503, he might never have returned home.;   The
pristine hideaway on the north side of this 28-square-mile Honduran island
might have remained the explorer's secret.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Fortunately for those seeking a tranquil refuge or scuba diving that
borders on the spiritual, the Bayman Bay Club opened in 1975, long after
Columbus came and went. Late that year, former Green Beret Tom Fouke opened
his dream resort on 10 acres of tropical hillside.;   The somewhat laborious
trek to reach the island and the relatively spartan club accommodations should
keep this divers' haven from being overrun. No AC. No AT&amp;T. No cars. No way;
there's no road.;   With 15 cabins, the club accommodates only 30 guests a
week, anyway. (In case of emergency, the club has a radio. If you must take
care of business a fax machine is available in Bonocca, a town built on a sand
spit off the south side of the island and reachable by water taxi.);   The
cabins are charming -- and roomy. They boast hot water, comfortable double
beds and ceiling fans. Jalousie windows allow for cross-ventilation. (A
curtain, by the way, serves as the bathroom door.) The porches offer sweeping
bay and coastal vistas. All the cabins are connected by wooden walkways to the
main building and the club's 200-yard-long beach.;   Bayman Bay is not to be
confused with Club Med-style resorts that offer an array of non-stop
activities from archery lessons to theatrical productions.;   The Bayman Bay
logo should be a scuba tank resting in a hammock; hammocks, swings and sofas
beckon from covered porches and the shade of mango and gumbo limbo trees.
Social life revolves around the open-air, four-story main building, which
resembles something out of "The Swiss Family Robinson.";   Two single-tank
boat dives are offered daily at 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. There were never more than
16 divers on the 42-foot "Nimitz," a converted houseboat, which performs
adequately in its new role.;   Non-smokers will applaud the no-smoking sign on
board. Club staffers lug the tanks on and off the boat. Additional tanks are
available in the dive shop for unlimited shore diving day and night. Dive site
depths range from 20 feet just off the dock, a favorite haunt of a trio of
spotted eagle rays, to the 110-foot deep home of the wreck "Jado Trader," a
200-foot-long freighter. Summer water temperatures were consistently in the
low 80s.;   Many of the dive sites are only minutes away and appropriately
named: Wonderful Reef, Fabulous Reef, the Pinnacle. The kaleidoscopic Jim's
Silver Lode, a long chute teeming with glistening silversides, which empties
out to a sheer coral wall, also lives up to its name.;   The most fascinating
diving, however, was at night at a sight called Alderson's Wall. (The daylight
dive there was far from ho-hum.) Shine a light and watch coral feeding on
schools of hundreds of tiny worms; catch hefty spiny lobster and orange coral
crabs high-stepping across the lunar-like landscape; discover bright scarlet
lady shrimp and hand-sized banded coral shrimp hiding in crevices.;   Aside
from diving or vegetating, guests can take a short boat trip up the coast or
hike up a verdant, boulder-strewn jungle trail to a waterfall simply named The
Waterfall. The uphill climb is only for the hardy. The serenity and the cool
natural pool at hike's end are reward for making the trip.;   There are some
catches to visiting this slice of paradise.;   A love of animals and tolerance
of insects and reptiles are helpful. Harmless, palm-size geckos perch
everywhere, including cabin walls and ceilings. Much larger but shy iguanas
sun themselves on rocks and tree branches. Parrots begin squawking shortly
before 7 a.m. (a natural alarm waking guests in time for breakfast).; If you
go . . .; (check) Diving Packages -- Seven-night diver packages are $750 and
include three meals a day, two one-tank boat dives a day, unlimited shore
diving -- day and night -- tanks, weights and weight belt, a beginner's course
for non-divers, a beach picnic on a neighboring cay, a hiking trip, an evening
trip to the town of Bonocca and transfers from Guanaja's airport to the club.
The non-diver rate is $700. Group packages are available for nine or more
guests.;   Arrivals can be arranged for any day of the week. Sunday arrivals
are more expensive because they require chartering a plane from mainland
Honduras.;   (check) TRANSPORTATION -- Round-trip air fare from Miami to the
Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa is $358 on American Airlines. (Connecting
flights are also available from Houston on Continental. Honduran carrier
Tansahsa Airlines departs from Houston and New Orleans.) The Honduran Islena
Airlines ferries guests from Tegucigalpa to Guanaja for an additional $70
round trip. A passport is required.;   (check) INFORMATION -- Call the Bayman
Bay Club at (800) 524-1823.  </TEXT>

<HL> Priest Electrifies a Philippine Farm Town --- Critics Question Unorthodox Way He Runs Cooperative </HL>

<DATELINE> DUMANJUG, the Philippines  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the sun goes down on this hardscrabble farm town, the lights start to flicker among the cornstalks and banana leaves. 

   There are 40-watt bulbs in lonely palm-leaf huts, fluorescent halos on plywood ceilings, illuminated roadside Coca-Cola signs. 
And everywhere there are tiny red Christmas bulbs lighting shrines to the local patron saint. 
The Rev. Francisco Silva, the man responsible for it all, has dedicated the past decade to the biblical command, "Let there be light." 

   "He is Mr. Electric Cooperative," says Emilio Osmena, governor of the surrounding province. 

   Father Silva, the Roman Catholic parish priest, runs two of the most efficient rural electric cooperatives in the Philippines. 
While other co-ops serve as money-losing dumping grounds for politicians' unemployed friends, Father Silva lights up the shanties of Dumanjug with a skeleton staff, pays his debts on time, and loses less than 10% of his power to breakdowns and pirates. 
Nationwide, the average is 35%. 

   Despite his robust results, Father Silva's unorthodox management style troubles auditors and U.S. aid officials. 
He urges his staff to sing on the job. 
He makes his constantly traveling truck drivers sign two-year chastity vows so they don't become lonely or despondent over romantic relationships while away from home. 
He has deputized coconut-wine gatherers -- who typically scale some 30 palm trees a day -- as low-paid, auxilliary tree-clearing crews. 
He begins each day with group prayers, and then dispatches his bill-collectors to the streets with carbines and orders to shoot to kill -- when necessary. 

   "Those who don't know me very well feel that I'm a dictator," he admits. 

   Rural electric cooperatives are an American invention, brought to the Philippines two decades ago by the U.S. Agency for International Development. 
From bolts to power-pole design, they mimicked the Rural Electrification Administration, in hopes that the system that powered New Deal America's farmhouses would serve these outlying islands just as well. 

   But like many American innovations grafted onto the Philippines, the co-ops didn't take very well. 
Some became launching pads for would-be politicians. 
Others gave free power and cash handouts to their boards. 
Of the 118 co-ops in the Philippines today, 79 lose money. 
Some are so broke they can't even provide rubber gloves or wirecutters to their linemen. 
Father Silva says some of these linemen must bite through wires with their teeth. 

   "Rural electrification co-ops are really a form of grassroots democracy," says Father Silva, sitting in fluorescent-tube splendor on his back porch one evening, while insect-eating geckos scamper just outside the pool of light. 
"But our culture isn't democratic." 

   Philippine society is rigidly hierarchical, with an elite whose members wouldn't dream of paying their utility bills. 

   "To them, disconnection is the height of disrespect," says Father Silva. 

   Members of the elite get their congressmen to write letters explaining that they don't have to pay. 
If an uppity co-op tries to disconnect one anyway, the matter can go to court and drag out for years. 

   Father Silva was running a school when the first electric co-op came to Dumanjug in 1972. 
Villagers danced in the streets at the news that electric light would be coming to their homes, he recalls. 
But before it erected a single utility pole, the new co-op spent two years building its own administration complex -- complete with floodlit tennis courts and the smoothest concrete roads in the village. 
The villagers' delight turned to discouragement. 

   Things only got worse when the lights came on. 
Management scrimped on maintenance. 
Two-way radios were purchased but never installed. 
Those that were installed didn't work. 
With no phones in Dumanjug, linemen had no idea where faults were. 
Blackouts lasted weeks. 

   Worse, management delayed staff paychecks. 
Underpaid installation crews turned to extorting bribes in exchange for service. 
Bill collectors pocketed payments. 
Demoralized dollar-a-day construction crews took whole days off at the slightest spatter of rain. 
By 1981, the co-op was so far behind in its payments that its supplier, the national power grid, threatened to shut it down. 

   That's when Father Silva joined up. 

   "I injected the faith factor," he says. 
"When I came in, I said, 'All your sins are forgiven. 
I want you to begin a new life.'" 
He followed the homily with tough rules. 
The next staffer caught stealing -- who happened to be the nephew of three other priests -- was fired. 

   Next, Father Silva banned drinking on construction sites. 
He installed floodlights, announcing that workers who took rain days would have to work their eight hours at night. 
When some malcontents sneaked onto a dam construction site after hours and threw rocks in protest, Father Silva gathered the stones, built an altar, tied it with black cloths, and said mass, heaping curses on the stone-throwers. 
The protests stopped. 

   To create a mandate for bill-collection, Father Silva held a referendum and the villagers voted to disconnect non-payers. 
Father Silva then offered his disconnection crews "combat hazard pay" and bought them carbines. 

   The acid test came last year when a non-paying policeman marched into the co-op, flung a .45-caliber pistol onto the desk and announced he would kill anyone who cut off his power. 

   "That's very common in the Philippines," says Father Silva. 
"Policemen will go into bars, drink and dance, and they don't pay. 
They get into cabs, show their badges and they don't pay." 

   The priest and his team went to the offender's house. 
"I was trembling like hell," Father Silva recalls. 
Guns at the ready, his men climbed the pole and shut off the power. 
The policeman brandished his pistol, but nothing happened. 

   Father Silva says he later preached a one-hour sermon on the disconnection. 
The gist, as he puts it now, was: "Every life is sacred, but we have a job to do here." 
He adds: "If it comes to killing in fulfillment of our duties, then I will do it." 

   With techniques like that, Father Silva's co-ops boast the highest collection rate in the co-op system. 
His staff has pulled in so much money that it used the surplus to open a subsidiary -- a coconut-log sawmill. 
Now, staffers are thinking about going into prawn farming. 

   Yet, not everyone is a convert. 

   "I have mixed emotions about this whole thing," says a USAID official who worries about some of Father Silva's techniques, including his guns and his defiance of purchasing rules imposed by Manila. 

   Last year, the accounting firm Price Waterhouse surveyed Dumanjug as part of a nationwide co-op analysis to pave the way for a $40 million USAID loan. 

   The accountants called his management structure top heavy, and frowned on his sawmill and prawn-farm schemes. 
Says Father Silva: "They felt the co-op} ran counter to sound management by all standards. 
And I agree with them. 
On paper, it looks bad. 

   "I had a hard time making them understand certain things I do."

   Antananarivo, Madagascar -- In four years of African
travels, I have seen some pretty weird things.
   In Zanzibar, I stared down at the ruins of the would-be
World's Largest Swimming Pool, which surely would have
received that distinction if it hadn't been built on a swamp.

<TEXT>
   In Mozambique, at the height of the great light-bulb
shortage, I checked into the Dom Carlos Hotel in Beira and
was handed one 60-watt bulb. The idea, the desk clerk
demonstrated, was to move the bulb from one light fixture to
another while stumbling around the room in the dark. "Enjoy
your stay," he said.
   In Malawi, a group of boys waving sticks ambushed our car.
They were hawking mousekebabs: whole mice, skewered on a
stick, lightly grilled. My wife took one horrified look and
rolled up the windows as we sped off. That December, an
American friend in Malawi sent us a picture of the young
vendors with their wares. "Merry Crispmouse," he wrote.
   In Africa, you get used to weird.
   Then I went to Madagascar.
   On the world's fourth largest island, I saw a three-foot
long earthworm, a gigantic moth yellower than the sun, and
several species of lemurs. I met a man whose name was one
letter shorter than the entire alphabet. I sat in a traffic
jam while a funeral procession crossed the road, not to bury
someone but to raise him, turn his bones, give him a clean
shroud, show him what's new in town and put him back in the
ground. I also donated blood to a legion of rain-forest
leeches.
   Perhaps Madagascar is the weirdest normal country I have
visited (the "normal" qualifier eliminates Romania under
Ceausescu and South Africa under apartheid) because it broke
away from Africa some 160 million years ago and drifted out
into the Indian Ocean to become weird all on its own. Most of
the animals, insects and plants on the island are found
nowhere else in the world. Most notable are the lemurs,
primates that never evolved like the rest of us. Generally,
they are furry and cute with big eyes and long tails. But
one, the aye-aye, is hairy and ugly with big ears and long,
boney fingers: the Grim Reaper in lemur's clothing.
   The Malagasy, an exotic mix of Africa, Asia and France,
are an equally unusual species. They give each other
humongous names. Their lives are governed by a series of
fady, or taboos, and the mystical powers of dead relatives.
They eat more rice per capita than the Chinese. They are very
friendly.
   Our first night in Madagascar, my wife, Anne, and I had
just finished dinner when the wine steward offered cigars. He
opened the fine wooden box and there, amid the stogies, were
a couple of large carrots. I said I'd take a carrot if he
could show me which end to light. He shook his head and said,
"No, monsieur, zee carrots are for zee humidity." C'est la
vie.
   The next morning I interviewed one of Madagascar's most
successful businessmen and possessor of the longest
unhyphenated name I have ever had the pleasure of foisting on
my editors. Charles Andriantsitohaina: 25 characters in all
(including the space), marching majestically across his
crowded business card. The last name, with 17 letters, is
just one short of the legal limit for racehorse names.
(Thoroughbred names are to be no longer than 18 characters,
including spaces, which explains why so many horses have
names that run together, like Itsallgreektome.) Mr.
Andriantsitohaina (pronounced Andrian-su-TWINE, or something
like that) modestly said his name was short by Malagasy
standards.
   I then became obsessed with finding a longer one, counting
letters of everyone I interviewed. While waiting 30 minutes
for a call to come through in the post office of a small
village, I feverishly checked all the pages of the phone book
for Antananarivo, the capital, which the locals mercifully
call Tana. There were some marvelous specimens.
Ravonitsoamaholizanany, first name Lalao.
Andrianaivoravelona, Andrianavalona. But it was while touring
the old royal palace that we found a name truly worth
mounting and hanging above the fireplace: King
Andrianampoinimerinandriantsimitoviaminandriampanjaka. His
subjects, the tour guide explained, called him plain old
Andrianampoinimerina.
   A Malagasy journalist named Olivier Ramahatra, who kept
calling me "ThurowRoger," explained that Andrian and Ra, the
two most-common prefixes, are noble salutations. Intimidating
as they may be, the names give Madagascar its hospitable
flavor. Strangers quickly advance to first-name footing.
Charles was Charles from the moment I first mangled
Andriantsitohaina. After a few days in Tana observing the
world's current No. 1 tourist attraction, the ruins of
Marxism, we headed to the rain forest in search of lemurs. On
the way, Anne studied the "Guide to Madagascar," a must for
tourists, to make sure we didn't violate any local fady. "In
Imerina," she read, "it is fady to hand an egg directly to
another person -- it must first be put on the ground." The
book didn't say if this meant all eggs, including scrambled
and fried. Better to stick to cereal for breakfast, we
figured, than to risk an international incident.
   The eight-hour drive south from Tana to the Ranomafana
National Forest is an ecological heartbreaker. Along the way,
smoke curls up from charred tree stumps, the haunting legacy
of the peasants' slash-and-burn agriculture, which has made
Madagascar the most eroded place on Earth. Just outside the
small village of Ranomafana, however, the smoke stops and the
road follows the descent of a spectacular waterfall. Here,
Duke University is coordinating a unique
conservation-development project that aims to save both lemur
and man from man's destruction.
   Our lemur safari began at the Duke cabin in the rain
forest. Before we set out, Emil, our Malagasy guide, told us
to tuck our pant legs into our boots as protection against
leeches. Leeches] The mere mention of the word conjured up
visions of Humphrey Bogart frantically pulling the slimy
things off his body in African Queen. But Emil quickly
reassured us: "When no rain, not many leeches." The sun was
shining. Off we went.
   About 15 minutes into our hike, the forest darkened from
the gathering clouds. A light rain began to fall, but we
continued. Then there was a clap of thunder, followed by a
downpour. Emil turned us back toward the cabin, muttering,
"When much rain, many leeches." I looked down, and there, on
one of my fingernails, was a tiny, thread-thin worm flailing
about for a piece of flesh. My first leech. I flicked it off
and alerted Anne. We stopped looking up into the trees for
lemurs and concentrated on our leech-ridden selves. We walked
and flicked, walked and flicked. Back at the cabin, we did a
Bogart. We each had a dozen leeches sucking away, mainly on
our feet and ankles, though one was working on my waist and
Anne had one on her back. (Emil, alas, was clean.) They had
penetrated our clothes through some kind of hideous osmosis.
A sharp flick of a finger is all it takes to remove them, but
the result is a rather dramatic stream of blood. When the
leeches attach themselves, they inject an anti-coagulant to
keep the blood flowing. You have to admire their ingenuity.
   We saw several species of lemurs on leech-free hikes over
the next few days. But that afternoon, we contented ourselves
with the age-old practice of primate grooming, inspecting
each other for leeches we may have missed. I imagined the
lemurs, the least-evolved primates, looking down from the
treetops at us and laughing. How weird, they must have
thought.

Suddenly, a family of four indris answers a call from another group of the 
species about a mile and a half away. The indris, known by the natives as 
babakoto or amboanala, have the loudest call of the lemur family. 
</P>
<P>
"There are mating calls or hedging-off cries designed to show whose territory 
it is," said Maurice, who compared the lemur utterances to the jungle calls of 
Asiatic gibbons. 
</P>
<P>
The gray and black indri, with its long hind legs, short tail and doglike head, 
measures about 2 feet long and belongs to a family of prosimians found only on 
Madagascar and the neighboring Comoro Island to the northwest. 
</P>
<P>
The future for the indris looks bleak. People here are gradually destroying the 
lemurs' natural habitat by chopping down the trees on whose leaves the 
creatures feed. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of a ban, the local population is chopping down the rain forest to 
provide grazing land for their herds of Zebu African cattle. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of Madagascar's 342,000 square miles given over to the rain 
forest has declined from 72,000 square miles (21%) in the last century to 
41,000 square miles or 12% now. 
</P>
<P>
As the branches vanish, so do many unique species that are only to be found on 
the island. Here 86% of flowering plants, 65% of birds and 99% of reptiles are 
native to the island. 
</P>
<P>
The forefathers of the indri probably drifted from mainland Africa to the 
world's fourth-largest island on natural craft made of driftwood more than 40 
million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The lemurs had the place largely to themselves, since only a few other mammals 
managed to make the journey. 
</P>
<P>
There are currently 30 types of woolly lemur on Madagascar. An estimated 12 
species are thought to have died out since human beings began settling the 
island 1,500 years ago, including two lemur species whose representatives 
weighed up to 200 pounds each. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors are the dwarf lemurs such as the mausmaki, or the bizarre-looking 
aye-aye, which uses its bony middle finger to pry insect larvae from tree bark. 
</P>
<P>
The indri remains the most impressive of the lemurs. Its bushy ears, cut-off 
tail and howling cry have earned it an important place in Madagascan folklore. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice tells the story: A young man called Koto who climbed a tree in order to 
collect honey was attacked by a swarm of bees and could not get away. 
</P>
<P>
An indri came along and carried the youngster on his back to a safe forest 
clearing. Since then, the natives have dubbed the lemurs babakoto, or father of 
Koto. 
</P>
<P>
Frenchman Pierre Sonnerat chose the scientific name indri after discovering the 
creatures at the end of the 18th Century. He was the first European to set eyes 
on them but made the mistake of christening his find after the words used by a 
local guide, meaning simply, "There he is." 
</P>
<P>
Not a great deal is known about the indri, whose feeding habits have not been 
researched by zoologists. No zoo has succeeded in keeping an indri in 
captivity. 
</P>
<P>
Eight indris were taken to the Jardin de Plantes in Paris in 1939, but all of 
them died within a month, and not even the zoo here in the Madagascan capital 
has been able to keep an Indri alive and well behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
The indri's life style still puzzles animal behaviorists, who know for sure 
only that the female of the species assumes the leading role in the family 
groups of two to eight animals. Such female dominance is seldom found among 
primates.

<HEAD>Scientist: Long-Lost Relative of Humans and Apes Found in Remote
Forest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A field biologist who trudged through a soggy,
leech-infested forest in search of a long-lost relative of humans
and apes returned with malaria, blood poisoning and the first
photographs of an animal no scientist had ever seen alive.
   ``For a week, I couldn't move,'' Bernhard Meier of Ruhr
University in Bochum, West Germany, said in a telephone interview
Tuesday.
   But he recovered, and his sighting of the hairy-eared dwarf
lemur in Madagascar has been described as one of the most important
rediscoveries of a mammal in the last decade.
   ``I went three times to that forest to find that animal,
although I already knew it was there,'' he said.
   An old man in a nearby village had told him about it.
   To get to the forest, near Mananara in northern Madagascar, an
island country off the east coast of Africa, ``you need to hike
three days, long and strong,'' Meier said. ``Nothing is dry after a
few kilometers because you need to cross many big rivers and
creeks'' containing leeches.
   ``The leeches are not dangerous. Most people say, `Oh, leeches,
I don't want these plum-sized, ugly, satisfied leeches on me.' ...
But the mosquitoes are dangerous. They transmit malaria.''
   Five preserved specimens, the first collected 115 years ago, are
held in museums. But until Meier's discovery, researchers had no
idea whether the creature still existed.
   The first complete description of the animal, known to
scientists as Allocebus trichotis, will be published shortly in
Folia Primatologica, a scientific journal. Meier made the discovery
last April, but it is only now being reported.
   The rediscovery of the lemur (pronounced LEE-mur) is important
because it is the only surviving species of an entire genus of
lemurs that have disappeared, said Russell Mittermeier, president
of Conservation International in Washington, D.C., and a primate
specialist.
   ``If you lose a species, there are close relatives around,'' he
said. ``If you lose a genus, that's worse.'' The discovery of the
hairy-eared dwarf lemur is ``one of the two most important
rediscoveries of mammals in a decade,'' Mittermeier said.
   The other was the rediscovery of the soft-spined porcupine in
Brazil in 1986, he said.
   The lemur is brown and shaped like a mouse, with a body 5 inches
long and a 7-inch, furry tail. It weighs no more than 3{ ounces.
   ``Allocebus is the smallest primate species in existence, except
during the dry season when the mouse lemur is not fat and is
smaller,'' Meier said.
   The lemurs of Madagascar are scientifically important because
they are a group of primates that evolved in isolation during the
millions of years that the other primates _ monkeys, apes and
humans _ were evolving elsewhere.
   ``In effect, Madagascar is a giant experiment in alternative
evolution,'' the New Scientist, an English journal, has said.
   Meier has an enviable record as a lemur hunter. Within the last
few years he discovered and described a lemur new to science, the
golden bamboo lemur, in collaboration with Patricia Wright of Duke
University in North Carolina. He also rediscovered the greater
bamboo lemur, which biologists feared had become extinct.
   Meier emphasized that the importance of the discovery also lies
in the attention it focuses on preserving the forest where the
lemur dwells. About 57,000 acres of the forest have been designated
as a biosphere reserve by the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization.
   That part of the forest is protected, but a surrounding area of
forest about 10 times that size is under increasing pressure from a
burgeoning local population, Meier said.
   ``It is one of the last patches of virgin, lowland rain forest,
with huge trees you can't imagine, 50 meters (about 160 feet)
tall,'' Meier said. ``This forest is a very special ecosystem and
can't be substituted by importation of other things.''

Souvenir Shopping Along the Sepik River

<DATELINE> Angoram, Papua New Guinea  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
    Bushy-haired Papuan
art-and-artifact peddlers sprawl on the ground in shabby
ankle-length cotton dresses before the thatched Haus
Tambaran, or spirit house. Battered umbrellas shield them
from the blistering sun as they trade gossip, nurse babies
and guard their wares.
   Before them lie ritual masks in bright colors, story boards relating jungle tales through carved symbols, spears tipped with cassowary claws, clay pots from the Chambri Lakes, shell and boars'-tusk necklaces, and carved shields. 
At the base of the slope, the Sepik River sweeps by, with swamp debris floating on its surface. 

   Most of the action around here is at the food stalls, where fish, breadfruit, bananas and yams sizzle in coconut oil. 
Artifact peddlers don't mind a slow day. 
This morning, they paddled up or down the Sepik in dugout canoes from their marshy villages. 
At day's end, they will return the same way with unsold goods, confident that government buyers will purchase offerings for export if nobody else does. 

   Along the river's 700 miles, it seems as if all of Papua New Guinea survives by carving and painting objects that turn to art in museums and galleries. 
Tourists also buy the work for souvenirs to lug home and show off to their friends. 

   Some items might need two people to tote them to the airline checkout counter, too. 
That would be only after each item has been fumigated to eliminate the termites and bugs that abound in this land of towering mountains, broad rivers and dense jungle. 

   Art remains art even when creatures exist on it. 
But few art lovers like sharing their treasures with hungry mites, nits, mastigophorans, amoeba, rhizopods and even-stranger forms of life. 

   Visitors do love New Guinean art, though, with its primitive imagery, brilliant colors and its ties to a spirit world of warring headhunters. 
A striking mask with glaring shell eyes and a pig's tusk stuck through the ocher painted nose finds a buyer even though he wonders uneasily if the piece bears a tribal curse. 

   Every Sepik River village has its distinctive style. 
The wooden masks from Koroga are decorated with clay embedded with shells and pigs' teeth. 
Wood carvers of the Murik Lakes chisel weird figures, half-man and half-nightmare creatures of the spirit world. 
Yessan features cassowary bone daggers and, sometimes, daggers carved from human bone. (Tribal warfare still explodes from time to time, and casualties occur.) 

   On the upper Sepik, villagers favor insect designs on masks and figures, with the praying mantis a popular motif. 
At Wombun, wooden masks are long and angular, their glossy black wood forming a background for white, incised patterns. 

   The spirit houses in each village are also elaborately decorated, with carved beams, ornately worked facades and painted bark-cloth ceilings. 
Men laze in the deep shadows within these houses, socializing, sometimes carving more spirit figures to join the house's collection. 

   There is plenty of art to lure the visitor, but getting here, and then getting from place to place, is not simple. 
Standard transport is the dugout canoe -- hacked from a single log, powered by paddle when used privately, by outboard motor on the river taxis. 
In such a cab, a visitor rides with chin on knees between a warrior with only his crotch covered and a trussed pig going to market. 
When the craft hits what looks like a log on the brown river, the dugout veers to the left and the "log" sinks beneath the surface. 

   "Puk-puk," says the warrior as he grabs a spear from the bottom of the craft and holds its tip poised above the water. 
The visitor looks back to where the "puk-puk," or crocodile, left scarcely a ripple on the water. 

   Far easier for river transport is the Melanesian Explorer. 
This is a 129-foot, 270-gross-ton vessel that plies the river and coastal islands. 
Built as a Japanese ferry boat about 50 years ago, it has been converted into a passenger boat of sorts. 
With a Fijian skipper, a Trobriand Islander cook and a Papuan crew, it reaches remote ports and villages thanks to its 7.5-foot draft. 

   It isn't a luxury liner. 
But you can escape the mosquitoes in a cabin, a cabin in which the air conditioning works most of the time. 
The ship is also a convenient way of getting the tall shields, the intricately carved kanu bowsprits, the tribal masks and other booty to the airstrip at Madang. 
The Madang Resort Hotel's staff is happy to package art and artifacts for shipping home. 

   Everybody on the Sepik now knows the Melanesian Explorer. 
When it drops anchor off a village, the whole population rushes to the bank, ready to help visitors clamber from tenders onto the shore. 
Every carving and artifact in the area is likely to be laid on the ground before thatch huts, all for sale at prices a fraction of those outside the country. 

   Not long ago, locals hunted crocodiles for cash to supplement their subsistence living. 
Today, most river people find it more profitable and much easier to serve the art and artifacts market than to face crocs at night on an unforgiving river. 
So their art grows ever more commercial, shaped to please visitors rather than the spirits hanging around a Haus Tambaran.

FAVORITE MEMORIES OF PLACES THAT STIR THE WANDERLUST OF A SEASONED TRAVELER

<TEXT>
<P>
With summer approaching, I have been reflecting on places I have a particular 
fondness for. One tempts fate, of course, when one meddles with the past -- 
resurrecting the imagery of spent moments, reflecting on joys that surfaced 
spontaneously, only to pass as some rare and remembered dawn. Still, while such 
moments cannot be replayed, the destinations call to the heart to return. 
</P>
<P>
Without hesitation I would sail again to Washington state's San Juan Islands, 
especially Orcas, whose weathered farmhouses and barns evoke memories of 
coastal Maine. 
</P>
<P>
One arrives by ferry from Anacortes, slipping by fishing trawlers and small 
islands with summer homes and beaches choked with driftwood. Gulls wheel 
overhead, and when the fog rolls in, a haunting stillness envelops this world 
of wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
On Orcas, wildflowers blanket the roadside and cattle and sheep graze in wet 
green meadows beside farmhouses whose windows glow cheerily at dusk. Orcas 
offers tranquillity; even the village of Eastsound is caught up in a time warp 
that reflects a period when life in America was less hurried. Wooden buildings 
line the main street and seafood fresh from the channel is served in several 
good restaurants, particularly Christina's, whose windows frame the bay. 
</P>
<P>
Miles of country lanes cross the island, taking in shady glens and deserted 
coves, as well as Moran State Park, where vacationers picnic in the shadow of 
Mt. Constitution. Shelter is provided at nearly two dozen inns and hotels, 
including Orcas Hotel ("Your Doorway to the Island's Victorian Past"), which 
rises on a bluff overlooking the ferry landing. The hotel is a three-story 
saltbox with a dozen guest rooms, a dining room with a fireplace and a lounge 
with a harbor view. 
</P>
<P>
Given the opportunity, I would return to Orcas, where sea otters pass and 
sandpipers scatter along the shore and the air is a refreshing mixture of salt 
and pine and the fragrance of roses. 
</P>
<P>
In Oregon, I might settle again at Morrison's Lodge, which is on the Rogue 
River near Grants Pass and the village of Merlin. In summer, vacationers raft 
the rapids and pick berries, and in autumn they fish for salmon and steelhead 
and study the changing colors of maples that frame the lodge. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison's features shelter in an unspoiled wilderness beside the Rogue, where 
bears fish for salmon and bald eagles soar, while deer and Roosevelt elk graze 
within earshot of the lodge. At Morrison's, vacationers from the city become 
dropouts in a world that remains as peaceful as a scudding cloud. 
</P>
<P>
A chance to turn back the calendar? I would hasten to Hawaii and settle at Hana 
on the east side of Maui, or perhaps the Waipio Valley on Hawaii's Big Island. 
</P>
<P>
As old island hands know, getting to Hana requires patience, what with more 
than 400 curves and 56 bridges, some so narrow that only one car can squeeze by 
at a time. Alongside the road the jungle is choked with shower trees and vines 
as delicate as a spider's web. 
</P>
<P>
Waterfalls spill into pools with moss-covered banks and bouquets of plumeria 
and torch ginger. One moment the road rises hundreds of feet above the ocean 
and the next instant it sweeps past lonely, uninhabited beaches. 
</P>
<P>
A sign reads: "Don't hurry, don't worry -- and don't forget to smell the 
flowers." This is old Hawaii, the Hawaii that existed before mass tourism and 
the advent of the high-rise. Tin-roof shanties face the ocean and rainbows bend 
across Hawaii's incredibly blue sky. 
</P>
<P>
While it is a pity to miss the drive, vacationers in a hurry fly from Kahului 
to Hana by helicopter or in small, twin-engine airplanes. As for Hana Town, 
well, just don't blink: a bank, a postage stamp-size post office, a few 
churches, a gas station and a couple of general stores, including Hasegawa's, 
which continues to stock every imaginable item from kerosene lamps and chick 
meal to passion fruit and poi. 
</P>
<P>
Shelter is provided at a handful of inns and hotels, including the splendid, 
low-rise Hotel Hana-Maui with its impeccable good taste. 
</P>
<P>
Close by there's the solitude of Hamoa Beach and pastures where cattle graze. 
Locals refer to their village as Heavenly Hana, and for good reason. One day I 
hitched a ride with a helicopter pilot and we hovered nose-to-nose with a 
waterfall hundreds of feet over the beach -- while over the headset came the 
strains of "Chariots of Fire." Wow! 
</P>
<P>
At the haunting Waipio Valley on the Big Island, those who elect to remain 
overnight have but one choice: Tom Araki's Waipio Hotel, a five-room clapboard 
inn with only a single shower and mattresses that sag like hammocks strung 
between palms. Still, the peacefulness of Waipio makes up for Araki's lack of 
amenities. One reads by kerosene lamp and cooks on a Coleman stove, and it's 
impossible to be disturbed by telephones -- because none exist. 
</P>
<P>
Over the centuries, little has changed in Waipio Valley. I recall awakening to 
the pounding of waves and the distant thunder of a waterfall; later I explored 
the jungle and picked papayas and mangoes. 
</P>
<P>
During the night it had rained, and so streams poured forth from the mountains, 
threading their way to a magnificent black-sand beach, where the Waipio Valley 
meets the ocean. I've promised myself I'm going back someday -- and I might 
just remain. 
</P>
<P>
I have other memories of Western Samoa and Aggie Grey's, a hotel of great 
warmth in the village of Apia. And although Aggie has gone to her reward and 
Samoa, perhaps, will never be quite the same, one is relatively certain that 
the character of Aggie's hotel will survive. James Michener was fond of Aggie. 
Indeed, there are those who insist she was Bloody Mary in Michener's monumental 
"South Pacific," although he denies this, as did Aggie. 
</P>
<P>
The last time I visited Aggie she was fretting about growing old, although in 
the minds of the hundreds of Marines she fed hamburgers to during World War II, 
Aggie will remain forever young. It wasn't until the fighting was over and the 
Marines had gone home that Aggie opened her hotel. I recall when chickens ran 
through the rooms and geckos darted across the ceiling -- while rain pounded 
furiously on Aggie's tin roof. 
</P>
<P>
It was a scene. 
</P>
<P>
So is Apia, the village where islanders continue to trade -- a setting that 
stirs memories of pictures on an old South Seas wall calendar: Samoans gather 
on storefront verandas and pigs run in the street, and tourists hail beat-up 
taxis to deliver them to jungle rivers where dugout canoes are hired for a 
song. 
</P>
<P>
In Western Samoa, trade winds blow through open thatched-roof fales, youngsters 
run naked on the beaches and on a distant hilltop a monument marks the final 
resting place of Robert Louis Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
As an old island buff I couldn't resist Hydra, which is reached by hydrofoil 
from Athens' port of Piraeus. Fishing boats face the harbor and facing the 
boats is a string of galleries, boutiques, bars and cafes. Overhead, perched on 
the hillside, whitewashed houses and chapels are put to canvas by artists who 
struggle up steep steps leading to their doors. 
</P>
<P>
For years there wasn't a single car on the entire island. Either one walked or 
rode a donkey. Even now there are only a handful of taxis. And only a couple of 
major streets. And so if one wishes to visit the fishing hamlets of Kaminia or 
Vlichos, one must go by boat, or else travel by donkey. 
</P>
<P>
A sense of peace draws visitors to Hydra, where a sign at the waterfront reads: 
"Welcome to the Island of Joy." In little tavernas, visitors sip retsina while 
candles flicker in old wine jugs and the melodies of mandolins pour into the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Memories. Well, Tangier, the North African city that entertains visitors doing 
one-night stands from Spain, continues to fascinate me. Earlier, the old 
Moroccan city served as an international zone under the control of eight 
nations, including the United States, Britain and France. 
</P>
<P>
One hotelier recalls how Tangier was an "exciting, tight-knit little community" 
from which there was little chance to escape in the event of a crime. Police 
patrolled the harbor. Others patrolled the roads and the airport. Tangier was 
locked tight as a safe-deposit box. 
</P>
<P>
The hotelier sighed: "You could walk down the street carrying an armload of 
cash. No one would molest you. Who would be so foolish? Who would be so crazy?" 
He smiled. "With all the police there was no escape." 
</P>
<P>
Tangier was like a scene out of "Casablanca." One half expects to run into 
Claude Rains. Or Bogie himself. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II Tangier was a gathering place for spies from a dozen 
nations. By day they spied on one another and by night they repaired to the bar 
at Hotel El Minzah. "After all," said one hotelier, "even spies need a few 
moments of relaxation." 
</P>
<P>
With the war over, the spies abandoned Tangier and the tourists took over, 
moving into El Minzah with its marble floors and flowered courtyard. In 
Tangier, Hotel El Minzah remains a legend, rising like a pasha's palace on a 
hillside overlooking the sea. 
</P>
<P>
In its gardens, exotic women reposed around a swimming pool while Moroccans 
gathered for cocktails. I recall a bartender named Mohammed, a striking figure 
in a red fez whose gold tooth flashed like sunlight itself whenever he smiled. 
Patrons agreed that Mohammed mixed the best martini in all North Africa. I'm 
going back, and soon. 
</P>
<P>
Rising blindingly white above the Strait of Gibraltar, Tangier is reached by 
ferry from Algeciras, Gibraltar and Malaga. One may fly, but the ferry provides 
a stunning approach to the port city. Tourists climb narrow, winding streets to 
the casbah where shopkeepers shout their sales pitches. If there is a town in 
all North Africa where the tourist is king, it is Tangier. 
</P>
<P>
Other moments I'm tempted to return to England, to the little village of 
Chagford with its celebrated inn, the Gidleigh Park, a Tudor-style mansion set 
in 40 acres of gardens and forest on the edge of Dartmoor National Park, about 
200 miles southwest of London in the lovely Devon countryside. 
</P>
<P>
A fire crackles in the lounge and oak paneling glows throughout the rambling 
old mansion, which is within earshot of the River Teign and surrounded by 
wildflowers, copper beech, maples and sweet chestnut. 
</P>
<P>
Europeans continue to sing their praises of the inn, as do Americans. Indeed, 
Gidleigh Park is operated by an American couple, Paul Henderson, a New 
Englander, and his wife, Kay, a displaced Hoosier. Guests fish for salmon and 
trout or else hike the haunting moor. Others choose the privacy of the woods, 
with picnic baskets that await their arrival -- along with bottles of wine that 
are found chilling in the icy river. 
</P>
<P>
And, well, there's Paris. The memories burn deeply. I recall an old woman with 
a pushcart filled with violets who waited patiently for couples exiting a 
bistro to sell her flowers to. Later she disappeared down a cobbled alley -- 
just as a new day began. 
</P>
<P>
Along Boulevard St. Germain that morning the trees were starting to leaf out, 
and although it was barely 7 a.m. a crowd already had gathered at Cafe les Deux 
Magots, which was where Hemingway scribbled away the hours, turning out his 
marvelous prose. 
</P>
<P>
Always in Paris I sense the old excitement as I catch sight of Notre Dame . . . 
or cross Place de la Concorde on a rainy afternoon . . . or stroll along the 
Seine . . . or take a table at a sidewalk cafe along Boulevard St. Germain, 
studying Parisians hurrying on their rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago I discovered a little Left Bank bistro, La Polka des Mandibules, 
whose spirited owner, Monique Claude, made no secret that La Polka des 
Mandibules was dedicated to romance. 
</P>
<P>
She served heart-shaped sandwiches and patrons listened intently while a 
stunning blonde sang haunting love songs. In this dimly-lit cave a single 
candle burned at each table and wine spigots rose from the copper table tops, 
so that everyone poured for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
La Polka des Mandibules possessed a magic that is hard to define. Years later I 
returned, but it was closed and Claude had disappeared. Well, never mind. Paris 
survives. There are other haunts. La Coupole in Montparnasse, which is favored 
by a creative crowd, is a fine place to linger over a cup of espresso. Others 
gather at L'Auberge des Deux Signes on Rue Galande, which is where waiters pass 
out music menus to guests who order recorded classics played with their meal. 
</P>
<P>
And what of Annecy, which is said to be the prettiest village in all France. 
Although it is barely a year since my last visit, the desire to return 
persists, this wish to stroll once more beside little canals as artists sketch 
Quai du l'Isle and Rue Perriere and bridges that span the canals. It is indeed 
a moment in time that plays to the hearts of all who visit this picture-perfect 
village near Grenoble in southeastern France. 
</P>
<P>
I carry on a love affair with Austria as well. Readers will recall Schloss 
Durnstein, the 15th-Century castle-hotel on the Danube where classical melodies 
are piped to the dining room and logs burn on chilly nights and other warmth is 
reflected by a ceramic stove. 
</P>
<P>
With its vaulted ceilings, baroque armoires and other treasures, Schloss 
Durnstein is unlike any other hotel between Vienna and Salzburg, as is the 
village of Durnstein with its narrow, cobbled streets and vine-covered hills 
and an ancient church whose bell strikes the hour like the echo of thunder on a 
rainy afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Along the Danube, visitors gather to capture scenes that bless the village: a 
hilltop castle, barges passing downriver, cattle grazing by the roadside and 
baroque steeples rising on the horizon. Should I return, I would indeed take a 
table on the terrace at Schloss Durnstein . . . to feed both body and soul. 
</P>
<P>
Switzerland, of course, remains close to the heart. Only recently I returned to 
Murren, the little Alpine village in the Bernese Oberland -- where cares are 
abandoned and cars are banned. But while Murren is a joy, a few miles away the 
melody of cowbells and waterfalls sets the tone for Hohfluh, an Alpine retreat 
of unrivaled splendor. 
</P>
<P>
Barely 60 miles outside Zurich, Hohfluh is another world. The little village 
(pop. 400) faces Reichenbach Falls -- only a short drive from the Wetterhorn 
Mountains whose meadows unfold like velvet into valleys lost in mists. 
</P>
<P>
One autumn, before the snows fell, I discovered Hohfluh while searching for a 
peaceful retreat. I took shelter in a chalet with a stream running by its door 
-- this during a season when the leaves were turning, when the mountains were 
scarlet and gold, and so Hohfluh with its verdant pastures and autumn colors 
shall remain locked forever in the memory. 
</P>
<P>
On sunny days we would hike to the high meadows, and one morning we took the 
train to Meiringen, in the valley below, where we sipped rich chocolate and 
listened while a herd of cows passed in the street, bells ringing, in a 
symphony that spelled peace. 
</P>
<P>
It is with an abiding affection that I recall the village of Portofino on the 
Italian Riviera. Near Genoa, Portofino continues to attract crowds that 
surrender to its charms: pastel-colored buildings, a crescent-shaped harbor, 
sidewalk cafes and an ancient piazza where fishermen mend their nets and 
romantics appear at the sunset hour while others gather at La Stella and La 
Gritta for the evening cocktail ritual. 
</P>
<P>
Although Portofino is only a speck on the Gulf of Tigullio, it works as a drug: 
Everyone who goes there wants to return. Hillsides are smoky with olive trees, 
and poking out of the trees are restored castles and villas that overlook the 
gulf of the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
Portofino's politicos had the good sense, years ago, to establish the village 
as a national monument, thus protecting it from unscrupulous developers. No 
Holiday Inn. Not a single disco. Portofino is a page out of the past that 
Winston Churchill put to canvas during repeated journeys. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors seek shelter at the grand Hotel Splendido on a hillside, or else Hotel 
Nazionale, which faces the piazza. Marvelous pastas and seafood are prepared at 
Ristorante Il Pitosforo, Da U Batti and Trattoria al Navicello. Who wouldn't 
succumb to the charms of Portofino? I was hooked the moment I eyeballed the 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Just as I was hooked by Puerto Vallarta before the developers invaded the 
Mexican Riviera. It was in the '60s, and Puerto Vallarta was a sight. Imagine, 
a village without TV or telephones. One could try reaching the outside world by 
radio, but with all the static, it was simply too annoying. 
</P>
<P>
There were no taxis in Puerto Vallarta. Only one-horse cabs. And only a single 
road. It was a bone-rattling, 14-hour ride from Tepico. When it rained, the 
road washed out altogether. 
</P>
<P>
In those days Puerto Vallarta was called the "Poor Man's" Acapulco. 
Pastel-colored adobes were piled like children's blocks up the hillsides and 
cobbled streets led to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
And whenever a freighter arrived, locals rowed out in dugout canoes to sell the 
crews beans and chili. This was before there was a pier, and so there were no 
ocean liners. Neither were there beggars or crime. The police had little to do 
but round up a stray pig or a goat and return the animals to their owners, who 
paid fines for letting the beasts run loose. 
</P>
<P>
One day I stopped for a beer at a cantina and a fighting cock fluttered in and 
perched on the stool beside me. The owner cursed and shooed it away with his 
bar towel. Yet the damned bird stood on the sidewalk crowing angrily. Afterward 
it ran squawking across the street, feathers flying, into an ice cream parlor. 
</P>
<P>
At the Oceano Hotel a room with meals cost $14. Remember, this was in the '60s 
and greed hadn't set in. The hotel owner was content with Puerto Vallarta as it 
was, opposing any talk of building a road from Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
She sighed: "Tourists could ruin this peaceful village." 
</P>
<P>
Well, eventually the road was paved and after that the airlines began serving 
Puerto Vallarta and developers built their huge hotels. One that's described as 
a "hacienda" contains 434 rooms, four restaurants and three bars. This is a 
hacienda? 
</P>
<P>
Still, certain charms remain. Dawn continues to arrive softly and the sunsets 
are breathtaking and Puerto Vallarta's lovely old colonial section has been 
spared for posterity. So while it's not old Puerto Vallarta, it has its 
moments. And, well, provided the opportunity, I'd return in a jiffy.

ANDASIBE, Madagascar 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Madagascar is burning. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence is everywhere: in the haze of smoke that drapes itself into the 
steep dales of the capital, Antananarivo, in the evening; in acres of hillside 
blackened with fire that line the road on the three-hour drive from there to 
this forest glen near the east coast, leaving nothing but a stubble of tree 
stumps. 
</P>
<P>
It is visible in the appearance from the air of the great island's central 
highlands, its once-deep forests burned away, leaving only a threadbare 
coverlet of green, as thin as the felt of an old billiard table, through which 
the rich red of Madagascar's soil bleeds. 
</P>
<P>
Blessed with a bounty of plant and animal life almost unique on Earth, thanks 
to 165 million years of geographical isolation from the African mainland, 
Madagascar is cursed with a human population of pyromaniacs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Centuries-Old Habit 
</P>
<P>
The result of their fires is that this fourth-largest island in the world is 
also the most heavily eroded. Compounded by a population explosion, the 
residents' centuries-old habit of slash-and-burn agriculture today menaces the 
island's future. 
</P>
<P>
The story is told here of a visiting Soviet cosmonaut who told his hosts that 
their island is the only land mass he could never fail to identify from space. 
It is always surrounded by a halo of bright red sea, he explained, the color of 
the soil relentlessly scrubbed off its denuded surface by the wind and rain. 
</P>
<P>
Madagascar's prized lemurs, the squirrel-tailed, dog-muzzled, monkey-like 
primates of which 23 species are unique to the island, have been pushed out of 
their accustomed habitats into progressively smaller strips of forest. 
</P>
<P>
Its precious rice fields, which feed the world's heaviest per capita consumers 
of rice, are fouled by soil eroded off the bare hills. Its best west coast port 
is all but useless today, so full is it of silt carried off the hills by its 
river. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spreading Malnutrition 
</P>
<P>
As the forests dwindle and the soil is degraded, charcoal and rice alike become 
more expensive, and malnutrition spreads among Madagascar's children. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Nicoll, a World Wildlife Fund official here, observed: "Virtually 
everyone in Madagascar is dependent on an endangered ecosystem." 
</P>
<P>
That ecosystem is one of the world's wonders. The island may not have lions, 
elephants or giraffes, but not one of its more than 400 species of primates, 
rodents, carnivores and insects is seen anywhere else on the globe. About 95% 
of its reptile species and 46% of its birds are also unique. 
</P>
<P>
Its outstanding diversity and sheer strangeness often have naturalists talking 
of Madagascar as if it were the product of a fabulist's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
"Butterflies as big as birds, and birds as colorful as the rainbow" were among 
the wonders listed by British environmentalists Gerald and Lee Durrell in their 
keynote address to a 1985 scientific conference marking the start of worldwide 
concern over the island's environment. 
</P>
<P>
Mammals here have retained traits that their mainland cousins lost in 
prehistoric times, such as the ultrasonic alarms and signals that tenrecs -- 
small, burrowing insectivores -- produce by vibrating their quills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unusual Ecological Niches 
</P>
<P>
Others have filled ecological niches left vacant by the vagaries of evolution. 
For instance, the nocturnal aye-aye, perhaps the strangest of Madagascar's 
lemurs, fills the role of the rest of the world's woodpeckers by digging under 
tree bark for grubs with its spindly, "E.T"-like middle finger. 
</P>
<P>
But the Malagasy love affair with fire is increasingly at odds with this 
otherworldly population of animals and plants. 
</P>
<P>
The Malagasy burn for many reasons. They burn the hillsides to clear land for a 
form of rice culture known as tavy. They burn the flatlands to bring up new 
shoots of grass for their cattle to graze. They burn irreplaceable forest to 
make charcoal. 
</P>
<P>
"And sometimes," said Voara Randriamasolo, director of the national zoo in 
Antananarivo, "when they're unhappy with the government, they burn." 
</P>
<P>
The fires set in pastureland eat away at the edges of the rain forest, drying 
them up until they flake away like the pages of a yellowing book. "The fires 
get out of hand because the people set them and let them burn until they just 
die out," said Sheila O'Connor, a Cambridge University biologist working in the 
south of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Unprotected by forest, the rolling hills of the highlands are scarred by 
crescent-shaped earthslides and eroded gullies, so common that the Malagasy 
have a word for them in their quasi-Polynesian language: lavaka. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conservation Effort 
</P>
<P>
Yet for all that, Madagascar has today become the focus of one of the world's 
most ambitious conservation programs. Development agencies, including the U.N. 
Development Program and the U.S. Agency for International Development, have 
over the last three years made the environment their prime focus. 
</P>
<P>
In the same period, the government has awakened to the threat. After an 
international conference in 1985, the government approved a program to improve 
management of its 22 preserves and to add 14 sites to protect such delicate 
ecosystems as coral reefs and mangrove swamps. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, there's often no staff in some preserves, or sometimes one nominal 
guide, with no transport, no training," said Nicoll. 
</P>
<P>
With foreign help, the government is prepared to spend as much as $200,000 per 
year to train and equip wardens for each of 14 particularly important reserves 
selected for intensive management. The programs will include rural development 
schemes aimed at providing local farmers with alternatives to the ancient 
destructive practices. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, Madagascar is a test of environmental preservation programs in 
the Third World. Where environmentalism is no luxury, such programs must have 
their own justification. Farmers cannot simply be instructed not to burn; they 
must be told how to find alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Why Should We Stop?' 
</P>
<P>
"The difficulty," said Randriamasolo, "is the chiefs say, 'We've been burning 
for 100 years. . . . Why should we stop now?' " 
</P>
<P>
Complicating the process here has been a history of political, not just 
geographical, isolation. For 10 years beginning in 1975, the Malagasy 
government barred all foreign researchers from the island. When they were 
permitted to return, the government itself was just beginning to realize the 
seriousness of the decline. 
</P>
<P>
Even today, some Malagasy, just like many other Africans, bristle at the 
suggestion that foreign help is crucial to preservation of the island's 
ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
"It must be the Malagasy themselves who take matters in hand," said Bartholom 
Voahita, chairman of the World Wildlife Fund's local office. "The British or 
Americans wouldn't allow their patrimony to be taken over by Tanzanians, would 
they? So, why should we let ours be taken over by them?" 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the pace of destruction is so great, and the rate of discovery so slow, 
that scientists are convinced that countless species are going extinct without 
ever having been known. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the arrival of man on the island (1,500 years ago), two species of 
tortoise, three of birds and 11 of lemurs have disappeared," the Durrells told 
the 1985 conference. At least 238 others are endangered. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you'd have to conclude that there have been extinctions here in the 
last 20 years," said George Schatz, a botanist from the Missouri Botanical 
Gardens in St. Louis who has been helping the government chart a proposed 
reserve. "Sometimes a species is localized to just the side of a hill. When the 
hill goes, the species goes." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, new species are constantly being discovered in the island's 
newly explored areas. 
</P>
<P>
Not too long ago, botanists discovered a new palm -- not just a new species, 
but a new genus. It wasn't that the palm was so inconspicuous that no one 
noticed it before. Rather, it is a majestic tree, 100 feet high and crowned 
with a red crest that proclaims its presence from half a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
"It was in a place where people had never gotten to," said Schatz. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that one of every 20 plants I collect here is probably a new species," 
he added. "In my preserve, there might be 500 new species altogether." 
</P>
<P>
The decline of Madagascar's ecosystem began, if at a leisurely pace, with man's 
arrival from the South Pacific about 1,500 years ago. At that time, much of the 
island was covered with virgin rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the forest has receded to a thin strip along the island's eastern 
coast and clumps in the isolated northern and southern tips, and the Malagasy 
have perfected their slash-and-burn methods of cultivation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Population Explosion 
</P>
<P>
Destructive as they are, the impact of these techniques was limited when 
Madagascar was relatively thinly populated and the land plentiful. But in the 
last 20 years, the population has nearly doubled, to about 11 million from 6.2 
million in 1966. The pace of destruction has grown proportionately. 
</P>
<P>
"The farmers might get 400 to 500 kilograms of rice per hectare the first year 
(of slash-and-burn cultivation)," said the World Wildlife Fund's Nicoll. "The 
second year, they only get half as much. The third year, they get a tremendous 
infestation of pests and weeds because the soil is dying. So, it's abandoned. 
They pull out and leave it fallow for 11 to 15 years." 
</P>
<P>
That's long enough for the land to recover. But the population explosion has 
forced the Malagasy to telescope this cycle. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so little land now that the cycle is three to five years," said 
Nicoll. "That's not enough time for anything but grass and bamboo, so the cycle 
spirals downhill. They go into more difficult areas -- steeper hills, poorer 
climates." The destruction builds geometrically. 
</P>
<P>
Conservationists say the government's emphasis on preservation has borne some 
fruit in recent times, particularly by halting the commercial exploitation of 
endangered forest land for timber and by controlling the poaching of lemurs. 
</P>
<P>
Some local people have discovered that conservation pays more directly, too, in 
guide fees and jobs in tourist lodges. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps one of the greater successes is a small reserve known as Perinet, about 
50 miles east of the capital and just outside the railroad stop of Andasibe. 
Tree cutting and lemur hunting have all but ceased in the reserve, said Maurice 
Bedo, a young guide who explained that he grew up inside the forest of Perinet. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent all my childhood hours in here because I love nature," he said. Being 
a guide is so lucrative here that Maurice's brother, Joseph, recently gave up 
on his college preparation because no job he could aspire to with a college 
education would pay more than he gets now. 
</P>
<P>
In his patched blue jogging suit, Maurice leads a troop of researchers deep 
into the woods. Tree roots interlock in a sort of ladder up the steep 
hillsides. He stops frequently to point out the peculiar characteristics of the 
plants lining the path. This one is an anodyne for a scorpion bite, he 
explains, showing how one crumples the leaf and rubs the moisture on the skin. 
</P>
<P>
Perinet is dedicated to the preservation of Madagascar's largest lemur, the 
indri, a tailless brown-and-white teddy bear of a primate. 
</P>
<P>
The indri's most appreciated feature is its call. "A Callas among the lemurs," 
is the description of one naturalist, "who composes and performs its own 
operas." 
</P>
<P>
Presently, Maurice's brother, Joseph, emerges from a thicket with the news he 
has tracked down an indri family of five. Suddenly, they are spotted flinging 
themselves, limbs outstretched, across the wedge of sunlight coming through the 
treetops. Two can be seen folded together in the crook of a tree. 
</P>
<P>
Silence. 
</P>
<P>
Then with the abruptness of a foghorn comes a symphony of pentatonic sound, a 
song of greeting, alarm or awakening in five harmonizing pitches. The calls 
continue for perhaps five minutes. Then they end as suddenly as they began. 
</P>
<P>
All over Madagasgar, the Malagasy and foreign visitors alike have been 
discovering those hitherto-hidden qualities of the island's wildlife. But 
resistance to changing the old ways still thrives. 
</P>
<P>
Cambridge University's O'Connor was confronted by resistance just last year, 
after she and some colleagues emerged in their Land Rover from the depths of a 
forest preserve they were helping to chart. 
</P>
<P>
"We came across a huge plot on fire," she recalled. "Later, one of the 
villagers told us they had done it to display annoyance at our not having made 
contact with them before going into the forest. It may or may not have been 
true, but they never did cultivate it."

FT  03 JUL 93 / Saigon, where the past is another country: Once the premier
city of Vietnam, now it is named after Ho Chi Minh, whose communist troops
conquered it in 1975. Nicholas Woodsworth, who lived there as a small child,
has just been back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH

<TEXT>
WHEN I was seven, my family moved from Ottawa, a placid northern city of
snow banks and bureaucracy, to Saigon. Here, for the first time, I
experienced the sweltering bustle of an Asian city in the tropics and felt
an excitement which has stayed with me. But, even to a small child, it was
obvious that an exotic climate was the least of differences between this
city and my own secure world.
In 1959, Saigon was between two wars. It was neither the French provincial
city it had once been, nor the war-fattened American rear base it was to
become. The catastrophic French defeat of Dien Bien Phu had taken place five
years before. It would be another six years before the first American troops
waded into combat off the beaches at Da Nang. But, in a city of eternal
debacle and recovery, 1959 was a year as portentious as any: it was the year
in which Ho Chi Minh began sending North Vietnamese soldiers over the 17th
parallel in aid of the south's 'national liberation.'
For my father, it was the beginning of a diplomatic posting he was to find
the most tragically compelling in a lifetime of postings. As a member of an
international commission set up to monitor post-colonial peace accords
between the communist north and the western-backed south, he was to watch
the rapid dissolution of Vietnam's fragile stability and its slide back into
confrontation and war.
For me, of course, there was nothing tragic or compelling about it. Adults
found it difficult enough to see a meaningful pattern in the deceptions,
political intrigues, corruption and misplaced enthusiasms that made up
Saigon at the time. Children did not try. As Vietnam became an ever more
obsessive concern in the minds of American anti-communist strategists - the
first 'domino' that they believed would set south-east Asia toppling - my
own mind pursued more immediate concerns: those of discovering a new,
different, and wholly alluring world.
For more than 30 years after, I carried round a set of childhood images of
Saigon, some hazy, some etched deeply and fixed forever. Recently, I
returned to Vietnam. Like me, like the entire face of the earth, the city
has changed. Once again, Saigon became a new and different world to
discover. Through the wondering eyes of a seven-year-old, any place at all
has the ability to fix in the mind the vivid impression, the haunting image.
What surprised me about Saigon is that it retains that power still.
WE LIVED in a large, walled compound in a villa built in the French Art Deco
style of the 1930s. Beyond the wall lay a wide boulevard, a river down which
a stream of motor-cycles, bicycles and three-wheeled cyclo-pousses flowed
from dawn to dusk in full, noisy spate. Unlike Canada, where life's
intimacies lay hidden behind double-glazed windows and thick curtains,
Saigon revealed itself in unself-conscious fashion on its footpaths.
Children urinated in the gutters. Women washed themselves squatting on the
ground in front of enamel tubs. Old men with bony rib cages dozed on hard,
wooden beds. Scribes bashed away at antique typewriters. their clients
dictating at their sides. Dentists yanked teeth, barbers cut hair, doctors
ministered, saffron-robed bonzes promenaded with begging bowls in hand. It
was smelly, hot, noisy - and, to a child trapped with his parents in the
back seat of a black diplomatic car, infinitely appealing.
But small boys rarely were let loose into the melee of Saigonese street
life. Although the French no longer ruled Indochina, Saigon was still very
much a city with a French flavour, an outpost of French commercial interests
in the metropole, and home to the families that oversaw them. We lived the
kind of privileged life that French expatriates throughout Asia and Africa
had made for themselves and enjoyed for decades.
I was enrolled in a French school, made blotted messes in my cahiers with
old-fashioned nib pens, and muddled over the mysteries of French verb
conjugation. My older sister, influenced by schoolgirl friends and visits to
Saigon's pink brick Notre Dame cathedral, developed an obsession with
Catholicism and announced her intention of becoming a nun.
At the Circle Sportif, we swam and sunbathed and watched staid colonial
matrons raising eyebrows at that daring new French invention, the bikini. At
home, we chased geckos and lizards across the walls. At the back of the
house, we crouched on our hams in imitation of the gardeners and house
servants and, fascinated, watched them hack and spit and smoke tobacco
through thick, bamboo tubes. On weekends, there were drives through rubber
plantations to water-skiing on the Saigon river; on holidays, we stayed at
country auberges in the hills and pine forests of Dalat.
Only occasionally in this cocooned existence were there hints - talk
overheard at adults' cocktail parties of civil disturbances, riots, brutal
government repression and a war going badly in the hills and paddy fields to
the north - that Vietnam was not simply some wonderfully warm and sunny
playground. By the time we left in 1961, Saigon was already a city sitting
squarely in the path of a fast-accelerating, oncoming disaster.
IT IS 18 years since Hanoi's tanks smashed through the gates of Saigon's
presidential palace and brought the cataclysm of the Vietnam war to an end.
But signs of that great disruption are everywhere in the city's physical
make-up, and more disturbingly, in its population. The war's aftermath is a
drawn-out trauma from which Saigon is easing itself only slowly.
French Saigon is still there but, in today's re-named Ho Chi Minh City, it
lies buried, like an archaeological layer, under more recent, successive
accretions deposited by Americans, Russians and North Vietnamese. To find
it, one must burrow.
I took a room overlooking the former rue Catinat, once the heart of colonial
Saigon and today called Dong Khoi (or Victory) street. The hotel of the same
name, once known as the Hotel de la Liberte, might once have been a gracious
pile; today, it is a gloomy and crumbling relic. Its decorative stained
glass windows are cracked, its marble and wrought iron staircases are dirty,
its tiled Dollars 18 suites have been painted a dingy, battleship grey. From
my upstairs balcony I searched the street, looking for signs of the past.
There are still antique shops lining the avenue, and you can still find
delicate crystal and bronze art nouveau lamps, pocket watches from Besancon
and Geneva, old editions of Stendhal and Camus. But these now share a place
with newer antiques more popular with today's visiting souvenir hunters.
There are Zippo lighters engraved with the sexual doggerel of lonely
18-year-old GIs who, if they are alive at all, are now in their middle age.
There are rusty field compasses, naval clocks, altitude gauges from US
warplanes, army-issue eye-glasses, insignia and shoulder flashes, and even
old jungle combat boots.
There is something tragic and obscene in this trading in bloody memories,
but it is not nearly as tragic as the human war mementoes who also haunt the
street: amputees who stump, wheel-chair cases who roll, living on handouts
and charity. Nor is it as sad as the city's remaining Amer-Asians, the issue
of hasty rest and recuperation liaisons with servicemen, some of whom
continue to live in Saigon in spite of an American programme to take them
'home.' Nor as wasteful and unrealised as the scores of Saigonese street
children who roam the old rue Catinat, products of a dislocated society,
living by vending and begging and petty theft.
Everyone aged more than 20 has a war story here. Strolling along the street,
you will meet fortune tellers who used to be businessman, second-hand book
traders who were senior government officials, noodle cooks who once flew jet
fighters.
Remnants of Vietnam's smashed and painful history are everywhere. They loom
large in the old concrete-shielded and pillar-boxed US embassy, from where
diplomats, top soldiers and politicians fled in a chaotic, roof-top
helicopter evacuation in 1975. They are evident, too, in the dull, east
bloc-style architecture erected on city boulevards by the Soviets before
their own recent departure. They surround the steel and glass one-time
presidential palace - today Reunification Hall, the seat of local rule by a
Hanoi government 1,200 kms to the north.
Saigon's disjointed past made finding my own past difficult. When the
southern republic disappeared, so also did all the officials, administrative
bodies and documentation that might have helped me in my search. Visits to
various offices proved useless; officialdom in Vietnam today is no
lighter-handed than elsewhere in what remains of the socialist world.
Somewhere in the stored archives of the former regime, I was told in a
polite but stony-faced manner, there probably was a record of where the old
International Control Commission villa was located. Unfortunately, though,
it could take weeks or months to find - or not be found at all. I rented a
bicycle and began to look for myself.
THERE IS a line in the opening pages of Graham Greene's novel of Vietnam,
The Quiet American, which stayed in my mind as, hour after hour, I cycled
through the humid, soupy atmosphere of Saigon's crowded streets. When jaded
and world-weary war reporter Thomas Fowler loses Phuong, his Vietnamese
mistress, to a naive young American diplomat newly-arrived in Saigon, he
reflects bitterly on the meaning of Phuong's name, which in Vietnamese means
Phoenix. But 'nothing nowadays is fabulous,' he tells himself, 'and nothing
rises from its ashes.'
Greene was pessimistic about the fate of Vietnam even when he wrote The
Quiet American in 1954 and foresaw the tragic consequences of growing US
involvement there. What would he think of Saigon 40 years later? I wondered.
In spite of the great ache left by the war and a damaging US trade embargo
that continues even today, Saigon is rising from its ashes. Greene might be
pleasantly surprised.
Saigon might be known officially as Ho Chi Minh City, but its inhabitants
rarely call it that. For more than a decade, Hanoi's attempts to re-make the
city's substance and spirit in a socialist mould rarely were successful.
Since 1990, with Vietnam's gradual re-admittance of market economies and an
open-door investment policy, Saigon has become a place that hums and throbs
ceaselessly with entrepreneurial energy.
A few blocks up from the Dong Khoi hotel on Le Loi Boulevard, both the
French colonial past and the American war seem only a distant dream. Even
from the seat of a slow-cruising bicycle, you can feel the impetus that has
turned Saigon into Vietnam's leading force for social and economic change
and the busiest, most productive city in the nation.
At the entrance of the newly-renovated Continental Hotel, once headquarters
for generations of war reporters, I watched European, Australian and even
occasional prospecting US businessmen dash through the heat from meetings to
their air-conditioned rooms. In front of the busy Ben Thanh market, young
Vietnamese men roared by on shiny new Japanese motor-bikes, the fruit of
labour in one of the city's sprawling factories, textile mills or
middle-tech assembly plants. A little more sedately, but much more
fashionably, legions of young Saigonese women scudded by on scooters, fitted
out elegantly in over-sized sunglasses, bright dresses, and colour
co-ordinated driving gloves that stretched to their elbows.
Cycling down by the docks on the Saigon river, where the fictional Fowler
watched US warplanes being unloaded, I saw container ships from Piraeus,
Panama and Yokohama unloading their own less-destructive cargoes of foreign
factory equipment, cars, television sets. It will not be long before Saigon
is making some of these things itself.
Pedalling about late at night, I watched crowds of laughing Vietnamese
emerge from some of the scores of city bars and dance clubs that have opened
recently. By the standards of the recent past, even the names of these
places are shocking: 'Apocalypse Now', 'Good Morning Vietnam', 'B4-75.' In
their dress, their behaviour, their evident enjoyment of life, these
Vietnamese on an evening out could be British, French, German or - dare one
say it - young Americans.
There are many travellers in south-east Asia, self-perceived purists of
oriental culture who, arriving in Saigon, look somewhat disdainfully on the
city. You must go to Hue, or Hanoi, or into the villages, they say; Saigon
is not the real Vietnam: it is a fickle, cheap, neon city, the tart of
Indochina, tainted by decades of contact with western values and western
commercialism.
I disagree. Saigon is the entrepreneurial city it has always been. Unlike
the North Vietnamese, its inhabitants are a commercial people with an eye
always on the main chance.
This same materialistic vitality also gives them a joie-de-vivre; a sensuous
pleasure in colour, movement, noise, food, conversation and company.
Saigon's psyche is southern, and as different from that of Hanoi as Brussels
is from Marseilles. Compared with much of south-east Asia it is still an
old-fashioned, bicycle-ridden city, but is a place that roars and swirls
with life. It is a place unlikely to remain old-fashioned for long.
AFTER THREE days of cycling, I finally found the ochre-coloured French
colonial house for which I was looking. It had changed little. Behind its
high wall, the semi-circular architecture, portal-shaped windows and
high-columned verandahs were just as I remembered them.
In the end, though, the Saigonese villa of my childhood failed to come alive
 -it remained as static and dream-like as it was in my memory. Perhaps it is
true that there is no going back. Saigon has been through so much since, and
seems embarked so determinedly on yet one more stage in its turbid history,
that the house is a walled-off piece of history.
What fills my imagination now are other, equally vivid images collected
while looking for a past - those of an energetic, restless Saigon looking
for a future.

   The world's largest tick collection could
be headed for a climate-controlled pod in a museum because no one
in the government wants to give the 1 million little blood-suckers
a home.
   The Smithsonian Institution and the National Institutes of
Health can't agree on which one should pay the $200,000 necessary
in fiscal 1989 to keep the government's Acarology Unit in business.
   The unit is home to 1 million tick specimens _ deceased, in case
you were wondering or worrying _ that have been painstakingly
collected by researchers over decades.
   If no agreement is reached by Sept. 30, the ticks will go into
the museum equivalent of cold storage and the lab will be no more.
   It's not your typical tale of government cutbacks, but a
potential tragedy nonetheless, according to entomologists and
health officials who note the tick's role in carrying disease and
the importance of research on the tiny, blood-sucking arachnids.
   ``The unit and the collection are unique, and are the backbone
of tick research in the United States and abroad,'' George
Eickwort, president of the Acarological Society said in a letter
seeking help from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   The funding dispute threatens a unique research program overseen
by NIH taxonomist Jim Keirans, who presides over the unit at the
Smithsonian's Museum Support Center in the Washington suburb of
Suitland.
   Public health officials, veterinarians, armed forces physicians
and zookeepers the world over know when they find a tick they can't
identify, Jim Keirans is their man.
   The unit's supporters describe it as the only place on the
planet where researchers can send ticks for identification,
critical to scientists trying to track the more than 20 tickborne
diseases that plague humans:
   Common diseases like Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted
fever. More exotic diseases like Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
and Kyasanur forest disease. Other diseases that infect livestock
and wild animals.
   Scientists and a group of congressmen have rallied to the unit's
support, urging NIH to save the lab for the good of the public
health.
   ``The collection and Dr. Keirans have been instrumental in the
accurate identification of tick species which serve as vectors of
disease, including the identification of a new species, Ixodes
dammini, as the principal vector for transmitting Lyme disease,''
Eickwort wrote in his letter to Kennedy.
   The Suitland laboratory was created in 1983 when NIH moved its
tick collection from the Rocky Mountain Laboratory in Hamilton,
Mont., to the Smithsonian.
   From 1984 to 1987, Keirans and his assistant, Richard Robbins,
received 14,113 tick specimens, most from agricultural and
veterinary researchers.
   ``We have received them pinned, we have received them
Scotch-taped, we have received them just dropped in an envelope,''
Keirans said during a recent tour of the spacious and orderly lab.
   The collection became the world's largest with the addition of
the specimens, papers and books of Harry Hoogstraal, head of the
zoology department at a Navy research unit in Egypt for more than
35 years. Hoogstraal was the world's pre-eminent tick expert until
his death in 1986.
   Keirans said the 1983 move came when NIH decided to get out of
medical entomology, the study of insect-borne disease, and focus on
AIDS research. NIH agreed to pay the salaries of Keirans and a
technician for two years; when the agreement expired, it was
extended to September 1988.
   But NIH is no longer interested in having a medical entomologist
housed at the Smithsonian, he said.
   Smithsonian spokesman William Schulz said the museum tried to
raise funds for the tick unit, but never said it would pay for the
facility and never felt there was ``some deadline where we would
take over the staff salaries.''
   John LaMontagne, NIH's director of microbiology and infectious
disease program, sees it differently. He said institute officials
felt that the ticks belonged at the Smithsonian, and ``the
Smithsonian originally said that they were interested in it.''
   ``It's my understanding now that their assessment of it now is
not quite in line with that. I think they get uncomfortable with
the public health and service kind of needs that the collection
implies.''
   NIH officials appointed 11 researchers familiar with the lab to
consider the issue. In March, they concluded that the unit should
be funded by NIH, with the Smithsonian continuing to provide space
and equipment.
   LaMontagne said NIH is looking into several options: financial
support from the Department of Agriculture and Walter Reed Army
Hospital, both heavy users of the unit's taxonomy service; or some
fiscal legerdemain, which would move the unit's funding to another
part of the NIH budget.
   Twenty-two federal legislators, led by Rep. George
Hochbrueckner, D-N.Y., wrote last month to Health and Human
Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen, urging NIH to continue funding
the lab.
   Hochbrueckner, whose Long Island district has high incidences of
Lyme disease, which causes temporary paralysis, and tick-borne
babesiosis (a malaria-like fever) has become one of the tick
program's biggest boosters.
   He says that if NIH doesn't want the tick program, someone else
should give it a home.
   ``I don't really care where they stay,'' he said.

CRUISE VIEWS: COSTA RICA'S SCENIC BEAUTY ATTRACTS MORE SHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the past several years, more and more cruise ships have been calling in 
Costa Rica. While the mounting troubles of Gen. Manuel Noriega may have been 
partly responsible for the shift away from Panamanian ports, so many passengers 
reacted favorably to scenic Costa Rica that it has become a regular stop on the 
transcanal route. 
</P>
<P>
The country's major cruise ports, Puerto Limon on the Caribbean side and Puerto 
Caldera on the Pacific side, both offer day-trip access to the capital city of 
San Jose, tropical rain forests and active volcanos. 
</P>
<P>
But a visit in more depth can be made on a 12-day voyage called "Exploring the 
Natural Treasures of Costa Rica" aboard Special Expeditions' 80-passenger 
Polaris, which was, coincidentally, the first passenger ship to transit the 
Panama Canal after it was closed and reopened in December. 
</P>
<P>
We joined the Polaris in Puerto Caldera a few days after that for a cruise to 
the country's coastal national parks and reserves, some of them accessible only 
by sea. Zodiac rubber landing craft take passengers ashore at islands and 
isolated beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Every day in Costa Rica included two or three naturalist-led excursions from 
the ship for hikes through lush rain forests, bird watching and photography, 
snorkeling among brightly colored tropical fish or strolling and 
shell-collecting on broad, empty beaches. 
</P>
<P>
At Manuel Antonio National Park we were able to get a good look at a furry 
three-toed sloth feeding on leaves in a cercopia tree, a graceful study in 
slow-motion ballet. White-faced monkeys ceased their chattering long enough to 
stare solemnly down at us, while overhead scarlet macaws and fire-beaked 
curassows with bright, toucan-like bills darted from tree to tree. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica has 800 bird species, plus 10% of all the world's butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most fascinating ports of call was tiny Isla del Coco, 365 miles off 
the mainland and only 280 miles from the Galapagos Islands. The island, covered 
with a rich green tangle of vine and trees, receives 25 feet of rain a year. 
</P>
<P>
Ships have called there for fresh water since the early 16th Century, including 
several notorious pirates who are said to have buried three notable treasure 
caches there. None has ever been reported recovered, despite an estimated 500 
treasure-digging expeditions over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Daily life aboard the Polaris is comfortable and congenial. Most passengers are 
in their 60s and 70s, the kind of people more interested in a lecture on 
sea-bird migration than a game of jackpot bingo. 
</P>
<P>
Dressing for dinner usually means a clean shirt and slacks, and most passengers 
turn in early to be ready for a sunrise beach landing and hike before returning 
to the ship for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
Besides a handsome, wide-windowed lounge that doubles as a lecture area with 
swivel chairs that revolve to the videos or slide screen, there is a quiet 
library with cushioned wicker armchairs, its bookshelves well stocked with bird 
guides and natural history references. 
</P>
<P>
A 24-hour coffee- and tea-making area offers cookies, morning pastries and 
late-evening sandwiches for snacks. The dining room also has big windows so 
that passengers at mealtime don't have to miss a chance to see a whale or group 
of dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
Big-ship extras aboard the little Polaris include a beauty shop, sauna, shop, 
next-day laundry service, ship's doctor and small hospital. The upper stern 
deck is canvas-shaded and is a favorite spot for readers, while a small, sunny 
lower deck attracts sunbathers to stretch out on lounge chairs. The bow deck 
and navigation bridge are open to passengers too. 
</P>
<P>
While there is no swimming pool on board, the ship's Zodiacs take passengers to 
beaches and for snorkeling almost every day. A glass-bottomed boat is also 
launched wherever there are coral reefs and tropical fish. 
</P>
<P>
All of the cabins on the Polaris are comfortable, if not elaborately furnished 
-- outsides, with lower twin beds and windows, or, on A deck, portholes, good 
built-in storage and hair dryers. The compact, utilitarian bathrooms contain 
showers and storage shelves but not tubs. 
</P>
<P>
Because there is no elevator, getting around the ship involves negotiating 
steep stairways, so the Polaris is not suitable for people who use wheelchairs 
or walkers. While the ship rides fairly smoothly for its shallow draft, there 
are no stabilizers, which could discomfit people extremely susceptible to 
motion sickness. 
</P>
<P>
Meals are open sitting, which means passengers have the freedom to sit where 
and with whom they please. At breakfast you choose from a buffet of hot and 
cold dishes, including fresh fruits, cereals, eggs, cheese, meats and flaky 
Danish pastry. 
</P>
<P>
Lunch is also served buffet style, with a separate menu of a la carte dishes 
that can be ordered from the kitchen. Teatime includes freshly baked pastries 
or cookies, hot tea, iced tea or coffee. Dinner is served at the table, with 
appetizers, soup, a choice of main dishes, salad and dessert. 
</P>
<P>
Filipino waiters and cabin stewardesses provide attentive service throughout 
the ship. Tips are pooled, with the recommended amount $6 per person a day. Bar 
prices are moderate, with cocktails and wine costing $2.50 by the glass. 
</P>
<P>
The officers, hotel manager and chef are Swedish, and the ship's registry 
Bahamian. 
</P>
<P>
The next "Natural Treasures of Costa Rica" sailing aboard the Polaris is 
scheduled for April 3-14, and is priced from $3,050 to $4,750 per person, 
double occupancy, plus air fare, which can be arranged through Special 
Expeditions. Passengers will embark in Manzanillo, Mexico, and return to the 
United States from San Jose, Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a sailing in conjunction with the American Museum of Natural 
History, April 13-25, will carry additional special lecturers and continue 
through the Panama Canal and on to Aruba. This cruise will not visit Isla del 
Coco. For details, call Special Expeditions toll-free at (800) 762-0003. 
</P>
<P>
Other cruise lines that call in Costa Rica include Windstar Sail Cruises, Royal 
Viking Line, Clipper Cruise Line, Costa Cruises, B.S.L. Cruises Inc. (formerly 
Bermuda Star Line), Holland America Line, Royal Cruise Line, Princess Cruises, 
Cunard Line and Regency Cruises.

MANKIND POSES GRAVE THREAT TO MADAGASCAR'S UNIQUE FLORA AND FAUNA 
</P>

PERINET, Madagascar 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This island off the East African coast is to today's naturalists what the 
Galapagos Islands off South America were to Charles Darwin, a study in 
evolution. 
</P>
<P>
But the island's unique and diverse plant and animal life is under grave threat 
as man continues to torch the forest to clear the land in what one newspaper 
calls a kind of "national pyromania." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, heading off the destruction of Madagascar's fragile habitat has 
become the premier goal of many international environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
After Madagascar split from the African mainland more than 150 million years 
ago, its plants and animals went on their own evolutionary course. 
</P>
<P>
Some became extinct, like the pygmy hippopotamus, elephant bird and giant 
lemurs. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a tremendous explosion of different forms from very, very few 
ancestors," said Dr. Martin Nicoll, a zoologist who represents the World 
Wildlife Fund here. "Madagascar lets you look at the limits of adaptability. 
</P>
<P>
"You can make really nice biological comparisons. What do plants have to do, 
for example, to live in a desert?" 
</P>
<P>
Madagascar's terrain ranges from rain forests to prairie to desert. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the plant and animal species on the 226,658-square mile 
island are found nowhere else: from the lovable lemurs to hundreds of species 
of orchids and more than 350 species of amphibians and reptiles. 
</P>
<P>
There are 29 species of lemurs, primates whose name comes from the Latin word 
for ghosts because of their largely nocturnal habits. The closest living 
descendants of the common ancestor of humans, monkeys and apes, lemurs were 
displaced by monkeys elsewhere in the world. Here they had a chance to survive 
in isolation. 
</P>
<P>
Madagascar's equivalent of the woodpecker is a lemur called an aye-aye. It 
detects insect larvae moving in decaying trees with its sharp ears and then 
uses a skinny middle finger to reach in and pull them out. 
</P>
<P>
The largest lemur is the indri, a black-and-white creature that weighs about 15 
pounds at adulthood and can leap 20 feet from treetop to treetop. 
</P>
<P>
The indris, whose haunting calls are reminiscent of sounds emitted by great 
whales, are the main attraction for the small but growing number of tourists 
who visit this small reserve about 60 miles east of the capital of 
Antananarivo. 
</P>
<P>
A short walk through a rain forest, led by a guide, inevitably turns up a 
family of the indris, staring down with their Teddy bear-like faces, bemused 
but not much interested in their visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The humans, whose slash-and-burn agricultural methods now threaten wildlife and 
the nation's watershed, are late arrivals, coming from Africa and the Malay 
Archipelago only 1,500 years ago. Fourteen species of lemurs have become 
extinct since humans arrived, and ecologists fear that others are in danger of 
joining them. 
</P>
<P>
The island's population has more than doubled since 1950, and now exceeds 11 
million. Farmers are so desperate for land they are felling trees on 70-degree 
slopes. Four-fifths of the island's land is barren, and its forests have been 
reduced by half in the last three decades. 
</P>
<P>
The government's agriculture department long encouraged farmers to cut trees 
and burn the stumps to clear the ground for cash crops. The savanna is burned 
to produce tender shoots for an estimated 10 million zebu cattle. 
</P>
<P>
"In the West and in the East, not far from the capital, the fires continue to 
burn," said U.S. Ambassador Patricia Gates Lynch. "Sometimes you see the smoke 
trapped right here in the city." 
</P>
<P>
The government and environmental organizations are working together now to 
discourage slash-and-burn land clearing, though the education process is slow. 
</P>
<P>
"It's primarily a human problem," Prime Minister Victor Ramahatra said. "We 
must teach people that the natural environment is their principal source of 
wealth." 
</P>
<P>
The government has shifted course from the policies adopted in a 1975 socialist 
revolution and now follows the advice of Western donors on economic policy. But 
a U.S. Embassy economic report says no economic reforms will work in the long 
run "without corrective action against Madagascar's single greatest 
self-inflicted problem: the destruction of its environment." 
</P>
<P>
The government also has broken out of the virtual self-imposed isolation since 
President Didier Ratsiraka came to power in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Nicoll says the government has cooperated with environmental groups since the 
end of 1985. "It is our No. 1 conservation priority," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A recent issue of the daily newspaper Midi said an average of 3.7 million acres 
of land was being burned each year. Midi, an independent journal, likened the 
burning to "national pyromania." 
</P>
<P>
Some peasants reportedly continue to burn the land to show their displeasure 
with the steady decline in the nation's economy since the revolution. Per 
capita income declined 24% between 1979 and 1983. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Destructive Erosion 
</P>
<P>
The denuded hillsides are no match for heavy rains and occasional cyclones. 
Great holes are carved in the landscape by erosion. The Indian Ocean north of 
the island is red from the red clay soil washed out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is organizing an international effort to halt the degradation, 
which it estimates will cost from $300 million to $400 million over the next 15 
to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Already 11 major projects aided by Western environmental groups, universities 
and governments are under way. They include efforts to save existing reserves 
and plans to create new reserves or national parks. 
</P>
<P>
Nicoll, whose WWF is managing projects covering 10 reserves, said efforts have 
to take into consideration the needs of the people who live nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"The people don't want to cut down the forest just because it's there," said 
Yale University anthropologist Eleanor Sterling, who is studying the aye-aye. 
"They truly need the wood for firewood or for land for agriculture. Many of 
them understand the problems in the environment and would like to do something 
to help, but they have to feed their children." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
People Accept Change 
</P>
<P>
Nicoll says the success of the Perinet reserve proves people can be persuaded 
to change. 
</P>
<P>
"I was there in 1985, during my first long-term stay in Madagascar," he said. 
"When you'd go into the reserve you'd meet people walking along with an ax. 
Just about every day you'd hear the chop, chop of an ax. You never hear that 
now. Tourism has done that. Tourism has put that place into a sort of protected 
status. Nobody would dare go in there now with an ax." 
</P>
<P>
Western organizations are pushing tourism, which up to now only brings a few 
thousand people to the island, many of them bird watchers or naturalists.

   ``Like the Mississippi, the river is always changing,'' observed
first officer Andreas Jungblut, who has taken freighters up to
Baton Rouge, La. ``But in the Amazon there are no buoys or channel
markers, except for a rare light marking a sharp bend.''
   ``At least,'' adds Capt. Biehl, ``there are no bridges to worry
about all the way to Peru.''
   Flocks of yellow-bellied birds called bem-ti-vi, ``I see you,''
dart along the shore, and baldheaded vultures with enormous
wingspreads glide lazily overhead in the faint equatorial air
currents. The sailor on bow watch spots a trio of red freshwater
dolphins frisking just ahead.
   Night brings the telegraph-wire whine of cicadas, the shrieking
of nocturnal dourcouli monkeys, a sudden boom of thunder or another
falling tree, a solitary silver nighthawk soaring beneath the
Southern Cross and, so the first mate insists, the mating yowl of a
jaguar.
   Sunrise finds some passengers down on all fours photographing
the huge moths, fat beetles and slant-faced grasshoopers attracted
to our decks. A barman shimmies up the radio mast to pin a mammoth
purple and gold butterfly for his collection.
   Before noon, the city of Santarem, 700 miles from the sea,
breaks the monotony of forest and savanna. Settled by Confederate
veterans of the Civil War, this gateway to the gold fields has
false-front cafes right out of the American West, signboarded with
names like Higgins, Jackson and MacDonald.
   A torrential downpour cancels a barbecue at Alter do Chao, a
nearby pink ribbon of beach. Then a rainbow arches over the river,
and the Berlin lowers her motor launches so passengers can swim in
the Amazon and walk out for nearly a mile on a narrow, curling
sandbar.
   ``Where have all the piranhas gone?'' an elderly lady inquires.
   ``Fled for their lives,'' answers ship's surgeon Heinz Wehselau.
   Next morning the boats are lowered again for a visit to Boca de
Valeria, a native village of thatched huts on stilts and a red mud
trail through tangled wetlands teeming with exotic flowers,
brilliantly plumed birds and strange insects, like a 4-inch-long
crawling something brightly banded in black and yellow with a red
head and tail. The landing party returns with bows and arrows,
spears and a variety of tick and mosquito bites.
   Some 1,200 miles up river, just below Manaus, nature stages a
spectacular for the film buffs on board. On our left, the
coffee-brown Solimoes River, flowing a mile wide out of lush
lowlands, meets the broad black Rio Negro, fed far upstream by the
snows of the Andes.
   For a dozen miles they flow side by side without mingling, like
competing oil slicks. The banks of the Solimoes swarm with leeches
and insects, while the Rio Negro is almost pest free.
   ``Even the fish swim aloof in their different colored
currents,'' the Brazilian pilot informs us.
   The two eventual mix at the ``Wedding of the Waters'' to form
the Amazon's final surge to the sea.
   At Manaus, the Berlin ties up to the floating dock built by
British engineers at the turn of the century and assembled piece by
piece to accommodate the 45-foot rise and fall of the river.
   The custom house and ``Little Ben,'' the clock chiming in the
plaza before the cathedral, also were prefabricated in Europe in
the days when rubber was king and Manaus glittered like the El
Dorado dreamed of by the conquistadors.
   Workmen were busy restoring the Italian frescoes in the
gold-domed Teatro Amazonas, the 1,000-seat opera house that
showcased Jenny Lind, the Ballet Russe and string quartets playing
Liszt for the rubber barons, whose decaying mansions are now
subdivided into tenements. In 1910, Manaus boasted French modistes,
British tailors, 15 miles of streetcar track and cafes with
fountains gushing champagne.
   Such luxury in the middle of a rain forest was purchased at a
terrible price in human suffering. The Indians who tapped the white
latex from the wild rubber trees were kept in virtual peonage by
their white and mestizo patrones.
   Penned up at night, underpaid for their labor, overcharged at
the company store, often sick with malaria and dengue fever, the
tappers were kept to a quota by guards armed with clubs and guns.
The first failure to meet the quota resulted in a beating. The
tapper lost an ear for the second failure, his other ear for the
third and was killed for the fourth.
   International commissions met to protest the brutality. Then
Henry Wickham, a British biologist, solved the problem by smuggling
out seeds of the wild rubber tree to the royal botanical gardens at
Kew for cultivation as a plantation crop in the Malaysian states.
   By 1915, the boom was over. Cheaper, Asian rubber dominated the
market. Manaus receded to a town on stilts at the water's edge with
suburbs of ``flutuantes,'' floating houses, as the rain forest
reclaimed the cobblestone streets leading to the candy-colored
villas on the cliffs.
   But now with an oil refinery, a 60,000-ton steel plant, huge
sawmills and government-decreed duty-free shops to bolster its
economy, Manaus is making a comeback. Jumbo jets fly in daily from
Miami and Rio.
   The sprawling Tropical Hotel, cleared from the jungles along the
Rio Negro, is attracting conventions from around the world, along
with jet setters and Antwerp diamond dealers to its arcade of
boutiques and jewelry stores.
   At the height of the rubber boom, 400 passenger ships a year
left Liverpool for Manaus.
   ``Two or three cruise ships a month call here now, but we are
hoping for many more,'' says Godfrey Springer from Tooting Bec
outside of London who settled in the Amazon with his Brazilian
wife. He makes his living taking tourists up the side creeks of the
Solimoes in a frail putt-putt boat to view crocodiles lurking among
the Victoria Regia lily pads, broad enough for a small, brave child
to use as a float for sun bathing.
   One would think that like Joseph Conrad's hero, Mr. Kurtz, the
natives would cry, ``the horror, the horror,'' at the first sight
of tourists invading the heart of their dark rain forest. Instead
they smile and offer snakeskin handbags and masks made of turtle
shells that will certainly be confiscated by U.S. Customs agents.
   The Amazon indeed has seen it all.

FT  17 JUL 93 / Travel: A perfect spot, it rains and there's nothing to do -
Doug Sager explores the primeval beauty of the Queen Charlotte Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SOPHISTICATED travellers have been hard hit by the trickling of wanderlust
down to the masses, cheap long-haul flights and the opening of borders
closed for generations. Where can they go that the neighbours haven't been?
Where can they go that has not been 'discovered'? One answer is the Queen
Charlotte Islands.
There is absolutely nothing to do on the Charlottes. The inhabited part, to
the north, is a time warp of small-town life, where the world's largest
black bears routinely trash the municipal dump looking for leftovers and
where traffic is entertainment rather than a nuisance.
Conversely, the southern archipelago, populated by a handful of humans, is a
living museum of flora and fauna untouched by the last ice age 10,000 years
ago. The world's most impressive totem poles, left standing in deserted
Haida Indian villages, are the only guardians of what was once a bountiful
and artistically brilliant civilisation.
How do you get there? First go to Vancouver on the misty and drizzly western
coast of Canada. Then fly direct or travel north to Prince Rupert and take
the meandering coastal ferry, 95km across the shallow Hecate Strait, which
is racked by some of the biggest tidal shifts on the planet. When you reach
the Queen Charlotte airport at Sandspit or cross on the local ferry to the
main town of Queen Charlotte City, you will know what rain is.
The Charlottes, as everyone calls them, are an arrowhead-shaped grouping of
islands breaking up into smaller shapes as they stretch to the south-east.
Graham Island, to the north, where the 6,000 people live, is almost as big
as the other 150 islands and islets together. Everywhere the climate is wet
and fecund. This is a rainforest in the northern hemisphere.
Logging is the big business in the Charlottes, with whole islands clear-cut
like a Mohican with stubble. Pitched battles were fought over clear-cutting
in the 1980s, with mainland environmentalists joining the politically savvy
Haida in a coalition against the logging barons and the provincial
government. There is still an emotional divide between what locals refer to
as the 'hippies' and the 'rednecks.'
The Haida, who once flourished everywhere in the southern archipelago, now
live in reservations outside the main towns on the northern island. Their
artistic tradition has been largely preserved, and they are culturally alert
and relatively enterprising.
Haida activists have been negotiating aggressively with the Canadian
government for administrative rights over the entire southern chain. Haida
'watchmen,' a kind of tribal militia, have travelled to the Amazon to advise
Brazilian tribes in their struggles to preserve the rainforest.
The Haida call the southern islands of South Moresby 'Haida Gwaii', or 'the
place of wonder.' There are no roads and no way to visit these islands
except by boat. Helicopters and float planes fly over the islands but are
forbidden to land in sensitive areas. Kayak tours are popular with the
ecological, bearded crowd, but the waters around the Charlottes are cold and
camping is certainly no more attentive to the environment than sleeping on a
yacht.
The Charlottes are sometimes called the Canadian Galapagos, because of the
unique species preserved there when the last ice age passed the islands by.
Animals and plants abound. Unique species include senecio newcombei, a
yellow flowering perennial daisy, and the world's largest black bear. There
are unique types of pine marten, deer mouse, hairy woodpecker, saw whet owl
and Stellar's jay. There are also six unique species of moss and liverwort.
The world's largest population of Peale's peregrine falcons nests in the
Charlottes. Bald eagles perch in house-sized lofts high up 600-year-old
trees, waiting for you to toss them a fish for the photo-opportunity of a
lifetime. There are more eagles here than anywhere else in Canada. But the
more elusive black-footed albatross has an even bigger wingspan, and seems
to prefer popcorn, heavily buttered, to fish.
Fishing, as I was taught by my boat owner's four-year-old daughter,
Charlotte, consists of throwing a line into the water, counting to 10 and
pulling it out. Forget the bait. We had a 25kg halibut, barbecued in massive
chunks on the boat.
As my hosts on the 71ft Darwin Sound sailing yacht were confirmed hunters
and gatherers, we ate our own catches of red snapper and the varieties of
salmon described to me, in my ignorance of non-frozen seafood, as chum,
chinook, coho and pink. We gathered razor clams, rock scallops, pinto
abalone and giant Pacific scallops. We tried to shoot a deer, but missed. I
am told I ate sea cucumber and goose-neck barnacles.
On land, we penetrated 'climax forest' of Sitka spruce, red and yellow
cedar. A single Sitka log can have a commercial value of Pounds 40,000, so
the argument over clear-cut logging is not just academic. The forest floor
is a spooky moss-covered undulation of fallen trees being digested.
All 400 former Haida settlements, with their large wooden clan houses, have
been reclaimed by the rainforest. But the totem poles survive. All the Haida
villages were on the edge of the water. Ninstints, a UN World Heritage site,
has the world's largest collection of in situ totem poles. Sailing into this
calm and protected harbour, and watching the totem poles emerge from the
trees, is affecting. More than anything else, the difficulty of access
preserves the romance of the site. Do not look for a visitors' centre.
There are other islands with natural hot springs, colonies of sea-lions,
curious seals and wary otters. Whales appear and spout off. Negotiating this
region, with its sudden storms and wild tidal surges, is best done in as
large a vessel as possible. Anyway, nobody is going to rent you a self-drive
boat.
The western exposure of the island chain is etched with deep fiords, best
seen from the air. This is the highest-energy coastline in north America,
and Canada's most active earthquake zone. Down around Cape St James, at the
bottom - very popular with sea-lions - the current runs at 7 knots and the
tidal range is over 8 metres.
This water, enriched by the warm Kuroshio, or Japan current, which staved
off the ice age, is phenomenally rich in nutrients. An amazing sight is the
Burnaby Narrows in South Moresby. Here a channel some 50m wide enjoys
alternating north-south tides.
At the right time the ankle-deep water reveals crystal-clear spectacles of
starfish and curious tropical fish - the single richest collection of
biological diversity on the Pacific coast of the Americas. In the shallows,
thousands of clams squirt like an ocean of suburban lawn sprinklers.
All in all, I cannot think of any place on earth more worth visiting.

British Columbia Tourism at 1, Regent St, London (tel: 071-930-6857) may be
able to help, but when I phoned them for information on the Charlottes they
said: 'But nobody goes there.'
If you do go, do not miss the Haida seafood feasts at the community hall in
Skidegate - all the fresh barbecued fish you can eat for Pounds 10.

<F P=106> [Article by People's Armed Police Correspondents Jiang </F>
Zishen (5261 3947), Liu Lixian (0491 4539 3759), and Bie Qinglin 
(0446 1987 2651): "Fine Showing of Special Police. On-Site 
Sidelights on Special People's Armed Police Unit Military 
Training Demonstration"] 
  [Text] This is a stirring scene. This is a never-to-be 
forgotten moment. 
  On the morning of 19 September 1993, many leading comrades 
drive cars to the Special Police Academy of the People's Armed 
Police [PAP] to view a demonstration of PAP military training 
results. On this occasion, the PAP, a sword that has been 
hardened for the past 10 years, is undergoing rigorous 
examination by the party and the people. 
<H8>  I </H8>
  At exactly 0900 hours, on command from PAP Chief-of-Staff Wu 
Shuangzhan [0702 7175 2069], the military training demonstration 
begins with the national flag raising ceremony. To the rousing 
strains of "Sing in Praise of the Motherland," played by the PAP 
band, a contingent of flag escorts in dress uniform and carrying 
semi-automatic rifles closely accompanies three soldiers bearing 
flags as they goosestep across the rostrum. 
  The Chinese people are renowned throughout the world as a 
nation devoted to ceremony. A march-past, the firing of a gun 
salute, and, the escorting of foreign guests are the three main 
events making up the PAP salute to the troops and welcoming of 
the guests. The PAP honor guard enters the grounds to the 
stirring sound of the military band. 
  "Boom, boom..." Volley after volley of gunfire resounds, 
directing the eyes of those present to the left front of the 
exhibition grounds. Gun salute troops from the Eleventh Zhidui 
[regiment] of the Beijing Zongdui [corps] have now begun the gun 
salute. This unit was founded in 1984. Since the firing of its 
first gun salute on 23 March of the same year during the visit 
to China of Japanese Prime Minister Nakasone, it has 
successfully completed the firing of 238 gun salutes to welcome 
guests. Today, the gun salute troops are firing a 21-gun salute, 
the highest welcoming ceremony for foreign guests, to welcome 
the arrival of all the leaders. Within the short period of 1 
minute 28 seconds, from the beginning to the end of the national 
anthem, it unerringly fires 21 volleys, each volley being fired 
simultaneously by four ceremonial guns. 
  As the thunderous sound reverberates across the land, a 
powerful motorcycle cavalry spreads its wings and soars. At 0915 
hours, the national guest escort appears on the exhibition 
grounds amidst the roar of motorcycles. All that is visible is 
imposing people's armed police driving white motorcycles to the 
left and right as they escort the vehicles carrying the foreign 
guests in a speedy entrance. During the nine years since the 
founding of this People's Armed Police contingent, which 
combines security and ceremonial escort functions into one, it 
has safely escorted heads of state, government leaders, and 
leaders of political parties in power from 152 nations in 
outstanding completion of its escort duties. 
<H8>  II </H8>
  Volley after volley of rifle fire cracks. At 0929 hours, a 
dramatic demonstration begins in which Model 81 automatic rifles 
fire at targets on which Chinese characters face away from the 
audience. First four sharpshooters from the Special Police 
School, Wang Zhiwei, Mao Xiaodong, He Liming, and Hu Bo, came to 
the field. "Pop, pop, pop." With each crisp rifle shot, the 
words, "politically qualified, militarily accomplished, fine 
work style, strict discipline, and strong support" pop into view 
on the target in 20 large resplendent characters. These are 
Chairman Jiang Zemin's main requirements for building the armed 
forces. 
  The next item in the dramatic demonstration is on truncheon 
and shield technique and boxing. These two subjects, which are 
demonstrated by the Thirteenth Detachment of the Beijing 
Headquarters Group and the People's Armed Police School, fully 
show the solid basic skills of People's Armed Police military 
training. The 20 basic fighting methods and the five offensive 
and defensive actions that the truncheon and shield contingent, 
made up of 216 men from the Thirteenth Detachment, demonstrates, 
shows an attack that sweeps everything before it like a 
hurricane, and a defense that is like a steel Great Wall. The 
fisticuffs technique that the 60-man special police personnel 
collectively demonstrate consists of very powerful battle-tested 
fighting techniques that the Special Police School has absorbed 
in the course of training from the essence of Chinese martial 
arts and the fisticuffs of all countries. They blend offensive 
and defensive techniques into a whole. Using their fists and 
feet, the action is determined and lively. 
  A women's performance where no men are allowed. The 
performance of the Women's Enemy-Capturing Contingent from the 
Sichuan Headquarters attracts particular attention. In a 
one-on-one performance of capturing an enemy, young soldier 
Zhang Ying faces a club wielding young man who is half again as 
tall as herself Using the fighting skills for making a capture 
that she learned in regular training, with cunning, she manages 
to knock the "villain" to the ground in less than three 
maneuvers. 
  The firing of Model 81 automatic rifles to designated parts 
of the human body brings the feelings of the spectators to a 
high pitch. From a distance of 100 meters, Five sharpshooters 
headed by Di Lin from the special police school aim at the 
targets, awaiting a command from the commander. 
  "The villain is trying to fight back. Hit him in the 
forearm." 
  "The villain is still fighting. Hit him in the chest." 
  "....." 
  With each command from the commander, the five sharpshooters 
fire, each shot hitting the part of the body they are directed 
to hit. 
  Firing of the machine gun in bursts is a tough part of the 
contingent's training. Comrades from the military training and 
research office of the Tianjin Group Command School devoted 3 
years study to this problem finally solving it. On the 
exhibition ground, two machinegunners fire at 15 steel plate 
targets from a distance of 100 meters. The rifle fire goes 
"bang, bang, bang,' and within 5 seconds all the targets are hit 
in 30 places. Immediately, enthusiastic applause breaks out on 
the exhibition ground. One leading comrade says, "It is not 
easy. The light machine gun that squads use does not do a good 
job, but the People's Armed Police troops are good shots!" 
  The light machine gun precision rapid firing that the Anhui 
Headquarters Group shows opens the spectators' eyes even more. 
Six people including school police officer Ding Jiatie, each 
fire 100 rounds at a human chest target from 100 meters. After 
the firing ends, the range officer presents the target for 
examination to the leaders on the exhibition grounds. 
  "Target number 1 hit with 100 rounds." 
  "Target number 2 hit with 100 rounds." 
  ... 
  "Good shooting, good shooting." 
  "Beep." With the sound of its horn, a long distance bus 
drives into a station. Four "criminals" mingle with the 
passengers and board the bus. As soon as the bus starts to move, 
the "criminals" suddenly fire their weapons to hijack the bus. 
The lives and property of the passengers are in serious danger. 
  This is a tactical exercise conducted against a backdrop of 
real warfare. When our people's armed police detachment 
patrolling the highway discovers what the "criminals" have done, 
at once they notify headquarters via walkie-talkie. Immediately, 
a truck bearing local government license plates, and two Model 
130 trucks appeared behind the bus. The officers and men of a 
Special Police combat company were under orders to remain in the 
vehicle as they began to subdue the "criminals" and rescue the 
hostages. 
  The hijacked bus speeds along rapidly, our special police 
unit personnel in hot pursuit. When the bus reaches a relatively 
wide spot in the road, the lead truck suddenly overtakes it and 
brakes suddenly across the road ahead of it. When the bus driver 
instinctively brakes his vehicle, the two Model 130 trucks speed 
to the right sight of the bus. The special police detachment 
personnel leap from under the canvas top, smash some windows in 
the bus, and rush inside, capturing alive all four of the 
"criminals" as swiftly as a thunder clap that leaves no time for 
covering one's ears. All the hostages are released with no 
injury to any of our special police detachment personnel. No 
sooner does this intense battle end than the curtain opens on a 
battle to rescue hostages from a residential area . 
  Seven "criminals" who had stolen a large sum of money, 
rifles 
and ammunition hijack a white van, which they are using to flee 
helter-skelter. Along the way, the van breaks down. To prevent 
the police from capturing them, the "criminals" place obstacles 
in the road including the van and lane separators, and set fire 
to them. Then, they flee to a residential apartment where they 
seized several people as hostages in the hope of being able to 
escape. As soon as our special police detachment receives the 
report, it immediately organizes four combat teams, which 
approach the apartments separately. Our riot prevention 
personnel fire a tear gas shell from within the riot prevention 
armored personnel carrier. The tear gas shell explodes in the 
room where the "criminals" are hiding, and white smoke gushes 
forth at once. Our combat team personnel, some of them following 
the downspout and others using rope, scale the building like 
geckos, leap into the room, and pin the "criminals" in a corner 
with firepower, seizing four of them alive. Another two 
"criminals" flee the building in an effort to escape. Our 
assault team personnel immediately set loose two watchdogs, 
which bring the "two criminals" to the ground in the twinkling 
of an eye. 
  A roar of motors as the iron cavalry soars. The skilled 
motorcycle driving of the Guangdong Police Headquarters brings 
the exhibition to a high pitch. Six people's armed police headed 
by Gao Xueping, drive their iron cavalry motorcycles at high 
speed across a single plank and soar across a 1.5 meter high 
platform. 
  "Next is flying across a short bridge. The bridge is 3.5 
meters high, 3 meters wide, and 7 meters long. This simulates 
obstacles that might be set up in search and destroy combat..." 
After hearing the announcer's briefing, the leading comrades on 
the rostrum put their binoculars to their eyes to watch this 
daring performance. 
  "Varoom, varoom." As the detachment members open the 
throttle, the motorcycles issues an ear-splitting noise. Then, 
six motorcycles fly toward the cut off bridge at lightening 
speed. The instant their front wheel hit the cut off bridge, 
they zoom into the air in an arc, then land safely on another 
cut off bridge 7 meters distant. Whew! They are like tigers 
vaulting a ravine or like a rainbow arching through the sky. The 
leading comrades on the rostrum are overwhelmed by the 
exceptional skills of the soldiers. They put down their 
binoculars and applaud warmly.

<HEAD>From Giant Octopus to 1,272 Lice, Smithsonian Has it All</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Last year the Smithsonian Institution acquired
an old Pullman railroad car spittoon, Ray Bolger's scarecrow
costume from ``The Wizard of Oz,'' a giant Pacific octopus, 14
condom vending machines (with 108 condoms), 50 parking meters and
1,272 dry-mounted specimens of lice.
   These and more than 700,000 other objects joined the vast
collections of the Smithsonian, a sort of large national cigar box
where Americans stuff their odds and ends, mostly odd.
   Also carted into the Smithsonian's complex of museums and art
galleries in 1989 were a sculpture made of grapevine roots, an Air
Force C-130A Hercules cargo plane, a satin Chinese hanging scroll
from the Ming dynasty and several thousand world's fair souvenirs
dating to 1850.
   The list includes 75 original paving bricks from the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the original propeller nose cone
removed from Charles Lindbergh's ``Spirit of St. Louis'' airplane
because of a crack, and 2,500 fossils containing imprints of ferns,
crabs and trilobites which lived in a northern Illinois swamp more
than 300 million years ago.
   Officials said the Smithsonian's holdings grew to nearly 138
million objects with last year's acquisitions, many of which came
from private collectors like Clifford Krainik of Alexandria, Va.,
whose passion was ballooning.
   The National Air and Space Museum bought Krainik's 400-item
collection of balloon memorabilia, including Matthew Brady
photographs of Civil War balloons, a balloon-shaped perfume bottle
and valentines, greeting cards, handbills and sheet music about
balloons.
   The biggest recipient was the National Museum of Natural
History. Its 674,817 new items included a pair of stuffed passenger
pigeons from Colorado, a flying lizard from the Philippines, a
football-sized Brazilian quartz crystal containing golden needles,
8,152 mounted specimens of wasps, 30 garments and household objects
used by Tibetan nomads and a piece of petrified timber from Cyprus
that has turned into copper.
   Only a tiny fraction of the Smithsonian's vast collections are
on display at its 14 museums and galleries in Washington and New
York, plus the National Zoo. The bulk of its nearly 138 million
objects are specimens housed in the Natural History Museum and used
for scientific research.
   The giant octopus, by the way, was captured off the coast of
Washington state near Seattle and shipped to the National Zoo,
which also acquired a Sumatran tiger from Indonesia and a three-ton
Asian elephant named ``Toni'' from Scranton, Pa.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The island of Madagascar split from the African
mainland more than 150 million years ago and went on its own
evolutionary course. But the island's many animals and plants which
are found no place else in the world are now threatened with
extinction by the encroachment of man. As smoke continues to rise
from the dwindling forests, environmental groups are digging in to
do battle.

   This island off the East African coast
is to today's naturalists what the Galapagos Islands off South
America were to Charles Darwin, a study in evolution.
   But the island's unique and diverse plant and animal life is
under grave threat as man continues to torch the forest to clear the
land in what one newspaper calls a kind of ``national pyromania.''
   As a result, heading off the destruction of Madagascar's fragile
habitat has become the premier goal of many international
environmental groups.
   After Madagascar split from the African mainland more than 150
million years ago, its plants and animals went on their own
evolutionary course.
   Some became extinct, like the pygmy hippopotamus, elephant bird
and giant lemurs.
   ``There was a tremendous explosion of different forms from very,
very few ancestors,'' says Dr. Martin Nicoll, a zoologist who
represents the World Wildlife Fund here. ``Madagascar lets you look
at the limits of adaptability.
   ``You can make really nice biological comparisons. What do plants
have to do, for example, to live in a desert?''
   Madagascar's terrain ranges from rain forests to prairie to
desert.
   Ninety percent of the plant and animal species on the
226,658-square mile island are found nowhere else: from the lovable
lemurs to hundreds of species of orchids and more than 350 species
of amphibians and reptiles.
   There are 29 species of lemurs, primates whose name comes from
the Latin word for ghosts because of their largely nocturnal habits.
The closest living descendants of the common ancestor of humans,
monkeys and apes, lemurs were displaced by monkeys elsewhere in the
world. Here they had a chance to survive in isolation.
   Madagascar's equivalent of the woodpecker is a lemur called an
aye-aye. It detects insect larvae moving in decaying trees with its
sharp ears and then uses a skinny middle finger to reach in and pull
them out.
   The largest lemur is the indri, a black-and-white creature that
weighs about 15 pounds at adulthood and can leap 20 feet from
treetop to treetop.
   The indris, whose haunting calls are reminiscent of sounds
emitted by great whales, are the main attraction for the small but
growing number of tourists who visit this small reserve about 60
miles east of the capital of Antananarivo.
   A short walk through a rain forest, led by a guide, inevitably
turns up a family of the indris, staring down with their Teddy
Bear-like faces, bemused but not much interested in their visitors.
   The humans, whose slash-and-burn agricultural methods now
threaten wildlife and the nation's watershed, are late arrivals,
coming from Africa and the Malay Archipelago only 1,500 years ago.
Fourteen species of lemurs have become extinct since humans arrived,
and ecologists fear others are in danger of joining them.
   The island's population has more than doubled since 1950, and now
exceeds 11 million. Farmers are so desperate for land they are
felling trees on 70-degree slopes. Four-fifths of the island's land
is barren, and its forests have been reduced by half in the past
three decades.
   The government's agriculture department long encouraged farmers
to cut trees and burn the stumps to clear the ground for cash crops.
The savanna is burned to produce tender shoots for an estimated 10
million zebu cattle.
   ``In the West and in the East, not far from the capital, the
fires continue to burn,'' says U.S. Ambassador Patricia Gates Lynch.
``Sometimes you see the smoke trapped right here in the city.''
   The government and environmental organizations are working
together now to discourage slash-and-burn land clearing, though the
education process is slow.
   ``It's primarily a human problem,'' says Prime Minister Victor
Ramahatra. ``We must teach people that the natural environment is
their principal source of wealth.''

Images of an isolated culture: 
</P>
<P>
Carved faces that fishermen fixed to their boats to bring luck. Hats of ivory 
and wood to lend strength to the hunter. A funeral coat of seal fur and 
tassels, meant to placate the dogs that guard the Land of the Dead. 
</P>
<P>
For thousands of years, the people of the North Pacific flourished in a frozen 
land. These Siberians, Aleuts and Eskimos were ignored by peoples that 
inhabited warmer climes to the south. 
</P>
<P>
When European explorers traveled north, beginning in the mid-1700s, they were 
astonished by the sophistication and beauty they found in large villages in the 
North Pacific. Researchers began to collect artifacts and piece together a 
history of this region. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't until recently that the two countries with the largest North 
Pacific collections -- the Soviet Union and United States -- agreed to share 
their knowledge. The result is "Crossroads of Continents," a traveling 
Smithsonian Institution exhibition now at the Gene Autry Western Heritage 
Museum in Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
More than 600 artifacts are displayed, including clothing and jewelry, tools 
and weapons, toys and ceremonial regalia. The art of the North Pacific is seen 
in the design and decoration of everyday items. The exhibit is a visual feast, 
the story of an unvisited past. 
</P>
<P>
"Scientists call the North Pacific the 'Mediterranean of the Arctic,' " said 
James H. Nottage, the Autry's chief curator. "It has a rich and complex 
culture." 
</P>
<P>
The culture is also quite foreign, with images of animal gods and shamanistic 
ritual. And because aging and delicate artifacts would be damaged by bright 
light, the exhibit space is eerily dark. 
</P>
<P>
You see a St. Lawrence Island warrior with his wing-like shield and armored 
skirt. You see the salmon-skin coat of the Nanai people, appliqued with figures 
drawn from Chinese mythology (a visual remnant of the time when, thousands of 
years ago, Asians walked to the New World across the temporarily dry Bering 
Strait). 
</P>
<P>
Preparations for "Crossroads" began in 1977, when anthropologists from the 
Smithsonian and the Soviet Academy of Sciences agreed to join forces on the 
project. They gathered artifacts from the Museum of Anthropology and 
Ethnography in Leningrad, the Smithsonian, the American Museum of Natural 
History in New York City and other museums in the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the items had never before been shown in North America. Some had 
remained in storage for hundreds of years, since the earliest explorations of 
the North Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists also collaborated on a summary film that portrays 20th-Century 
developments in Siberian and Alaskan cultures. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit opened at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C., and will move on to 
Anchorage, Ottawa and Leningrad. It has stopped over at the Autry as part of an 
ongoing relationship between the Smithsonian and the Griffith Park museum. 
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the main exhibit, a "hands-on" exhibit has opened in an 
ancillary gallery. Children can touch and play with numerous replicas, 
including a Northwest Coast Indian long house and a large variety of bird and 
animal replicas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crossroads of Continents" continues through Feb. 24. The Gene Autry Western 
Heritage Museum is at 4700 Zoo Drive. Hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday 
through Sunday. Admission to this exhibit is $7.50, $6 for seniors and 
students, $4.50 for children under 13. For information call (213) 667-2000.

   Christmas is in the air. And in San Antonio, New York, New
Orleans, and probably in your home town, too.
   Some notable public tree or light displays:
   The Christmas tree and Neapolitan Baroque creche display at New
York's Metropolitan Museum of Art rivals the Rockefeller Center
tree as the favorite of New Yorkers and visitors.
   This 20-foot blue spruce is decorated with Renaissance cherubs
and angels, with the Spanish choir screen in the museum's medieval
sculpture hall as backdrop. Its base is surrounded with 18th
century creche figures depicting the Nativity (set in the ruins of
a Roman temple), angels and shepherds and their flocks, the three
Magi and their retinue of Orientals and Moors, and crowds of
merchants, burghers and peasants. These figures recall the custom
of Nativity scenes developed in Italy, southern Germany and the
Tyrol. The figures were collected and presented to the museum by
the late Loretta Hines Howard, and the museum's display has been
repeated for 27 years since.
   New Orleans lights up with thousands of twinkling lights along
the Moonwalk, Woldenberg Riverfront Park and Spanish Plaza.
Riverfront streetcars, decorated with garlands, red bows and white
lights, take passengers to see fireworks displays. Santa Claus
starts the show after his arrival in his Merry Tug on the
Mississippi River, followed by a parade of brightly lit tugboats,
the Steamboat Natchez and the Paddlewheeler Creole Queen.
   San Antonio's lights center on its River Walk, with over 50,000
lights trimming the trees and footbridges. Thousands of Mexican
luminarias (candles in paper bags) line the River Walk, a symbol of
lighting the way for the Holy Family. Santa appears here by river
barge at the Holiday River Parade.
   In Hawaii, Santa arrives by canoe (he must by now be a qualified
sailor) to the various islands. In Honolulu, the Festival of
Christmas Trees at Honolulu Hale (city hall) is the heart of the
city's celebrations. The festivities include Christmas hulas, with
little girls wearing tinsel leis.
   Reno normally has plenty of lights flashing, but the casino
lights go dark when 40 blue spruce trees along the city's main
thoroughfare light up for the Festival of Trees. The trees will be
trimmed by area charities in competition for the most beautiful,
original and best themed decorations. The ceremony is preceded by a
four-block caroling procession that leads from the Pioneer Center
for the Performing Arts to the ``Biggest Little City in the World''
arch downtown.
   Christmases of the past will be re-created in the historic
buildings at the Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Mich. Cotswold
Cottage, for example, will show how a rural English Christmas was
celebrated, while an American Victorian Christmas will take place
at Firestone Farm. Nearby, at the Henry Ford Museum, a giant
Christmas tree decorated with toys, candy and cookies will almost
touch the roof. In the museum's concourse, a fantasy Lionel train
layout - including a car with a tiny camera that broadcasts an
``engineer's eye view'' - will make its way through a gingerbread
village. And visitors can contribute pictures of their own family
holiday traditions for use on the holiday photo wall, later to
become part of the museum archives.

   What do the world's rapidly receding rain
forests and other endangered ecological climes have to do with New
York City? Or Atlanta, for that matter? Or San Antonio? Or Rock
Island, Ill.?
   All of those cities and many others either have or are planning
a plant conservatory, a kind of sophisticated greenhouse where they
can nurture specimens of the world's endangered plant life, much as
zoos protect some endangered animal species.
   Evie White came all the way to New York where by luck she got a
lead on 18 acres of land back home in Rock Island on which to build
the plant conservatory she has been dreaming of for years.
   Mrs. White, and her husband, Charles, a retired schoolteacher,
recently attended a two-day workshop, ``Conservatories of the 21st
Century,'' at the Brooklyn Botanical Garden. Experts attended from
all over the country. For the Whites it was a wellspring of
knowledge.
   Most conservatories are the crown jewel of a botanical garden.
Sometimes they are called ``the Rembrandt in the museum.''
   In the garden, landscape architects and horticulturists do the
best they can with the existing climate. In the conservatory, where
heating and cooling systems may be computer controlled,
horticulturists can preserve rare plants, plants that grow tens of
thousands of miles away, plants from the other side of the equator,
plants that people in a town would never see if it weren't for the
controlled climates the conservatories provide.
   The concept dates back at least to Roman times.
   But in 1989, Rock Island, a town of 40,000, yet part of the Quad
City area on the Mississippi River with a populace of 250,000, has
decided it wants a conservatory.
   So, it seems, have a lot of others.
   It may be the growth industry of culture as conservatories, and
dreams of glass houses for plants, sprout across the country. More
than $150 million is being spent already.
   Experts, such as Joe Kerwin of the New York Botanical Gardens in
the Bronx, a 240-acre complex with a beautiful turn-of-the-century
Victorian conservatory, say the boom partially reflects an
ecology-conscious nation.
   ``You turn on any news show and you will see a segment on how
the rain forests are disappearing,'' Kerwin says. ``Everyone is now
aware of a problem that few knew little about just a few years
ago.''
   Experts tell us that rain forests are disappearing at the rate
of an acre a second and that the earth is losing three plant
species an hour, perhaps taking with them great medicinal or
economic secrets.
   But Kerwin doesn't think concern for the ecology is the sole
reason for the interest in conservatories.
   ``If that were the case, you could buy up quite a bit of
Brazilian real estate with $100 million and preserve the
original,'' he says.
   There seems to be an attendant sense of civic pride about having
a conservatory. You've got the art museum, the symphony, a zoo, and
now, by gosh, it's about time for that conservatory.
   Most of the new construction has been in the South and
Southwest, where culture is moving in along with the satellite dish.
   The Brooklyn Botanical Garden played host to the first-ever
conference to study everything from fund-raising to new methods of
pest control, as well as to show off its own $25 million
restoration and new construction, the Steinhardt Conservatory.
   Representatives of the four newest conservatories _ the ones in
Brooklyn, San Antonio, Atlanta and Oklahoma City _ dominated the
sessions dealing with architecture, ventilation, shading, cooling
and heating, publicity, the pros and cons of receiving municipal,
county or state support, how to present a good educational program,
how to introduce predator insects.
   It revealed a basic conflict between architects and
horticulturists.
   Architects want to make a statement with the structure.
Horticulturists want to obscure the structure as much as possible
so that visitors feel they are lost in time as they meander through
the misty fronds.
   The Whites of Rock Island are thinking more modestly than their
Brooklyn host, perhaps $3 million to $4 million. They personally
have a bonsai collection of more than 100 trees, someone else has a
rose collection, a third has a cactus collection and they all want
to will them to a conservatory.
   ``We've been talking about it for three years, but I've met
people here who have been trying to raise money for 18 years,''
Mrs. White says.

<LEADPARA>  AUSTRALIA is the island continent,known for its unique wildlife andslightly
irreverent English-speakingculture as shown by Paul Hogan in the exaggerated
character of Mick Dundee in "Crocodile Dundee." Little known to the outside
world is that ringing the continent's 23,000-mile circumference are hundreds
of smaller islands. Among them are some of the most unique and least-known
adventure travel opportunities on the planet.;    The islands' diversity
includes the greatest concentration of wildlife found anywhere in Australia;
extensive temperate rain forests and alpine walking tracks over button grass
meadows punctuated with towering dolerite peaks; remote islands teeming with
rare wildlife and suitable for charter sailing; the largest island of the
world made entirely of sand with mysterious "perched lakes" and towering rain
forests, wild horses and dingoes; the sun-drenched coral cays of the Great
Barrier Reef and an island playground centered on the Whitsundays with
everything from swank resorts to deserted islands with pristine beaches;
rugged Hinchinbrook Island, the largest island park in the world; and finally,
Bathurst and Melville islands at Top End near Darwin, the land of the Tiwi
people, who spend their days perfecting their colorful totem-like art,
collecting turtle eggs and hunting crocodiles and goanna as they have for
thousands of years. In all there are more than 300 islands encircling the
Australian mainland. Here is a look at three of them:  </LEADPARA>

(Sierra Club Books, 1990, $14.95).  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Kangaroo Island:;  Wildlife paradise;  Chances are your travel agent has
never heard of Kangaroo Island, in South Australia near Adelaide. Australian
Geographic Publisher Dick Smith told me Kangaroo Island is the best place to
view wildlife in Australia. Smith ought to know: He has flown a helicopter
around Australia's 23,000-mile shore in search of the top wildlife areas. It
took me 40,000 outback miles on my own before I was convinced Smith was right.
To do this island justice, set aside at least three days to investigate the
national parks and three small towns of Kingscote, Penneshaw and American
River, plus the spectacular coastal areas. If you fancy yourself a wildlife
photographer bring plenty of film.;    Kangaroo Island is a wildlife haven for
several reasons. First, European settlement never has caught on in a big way
here, and even Aboriginal man died out some 2200 years before Europeans first
arrived. The result is that wildlife has developed with uncharacteristic
tameness. Also, species from the mainland that were threatened by feral foxes
and cats have found new life and thrived on Kangaroo Island. The platypus and
koala are the best examples.;    Native animals that are easy to find include
the Kangaroo Island Grey Kangaroo, often weighing more than 100 pounds and
standing 5 feet tall; the tiny Tammar wallaby (a miniature kangaroo about the
size of a large rabbit); the goanna (a large, harmless lizard); and the
echidna (an egg-laying mammal that eats insects and protects itself with a
coat of quills).;    Aquatic life forms also live here. Australian sea lions,
perhaps the most handsome of all sea lions, are readily approachable, as are
New Zealand fur seals. Even an occasional leopard seal is sighted. These large
predators sometimes stray into the waters from Antarctica, the next land mass
to the south.;    The island is a birder's paradise. There are more than 216
species including 12 raptors, open ocean species such as penguins, gannets and
albatrosses, eight kinds of raucous cockatoos, laughing kookaburras, and more
than 36 kinds of waterfowl.;    There are only about 30 miles of paved road on
the island that connect the main towns of Penneshaw, Kingscote and American
River. The island residents are mostly dryland farmers with a strong
environmental tilt. There are about a dozen national parks and preserves. The
most notable are Seal Bay and Flinders Chase national parks. Seal Bay is the
home of a colony of Australian sea lions that have little fear of people.
Flinders Chase takes up the west side of the island and can only be reached on
somewhat treacherous dirt roods. In half a day here I saw sea eagles snatching
fish from the sea, koalas plodding along the ground, platypus puttering about
in the shallow stream, kangaroos, emus (large, flightless birds), wallabies
goannas, fur seals and about a dozen varieties of parrots. There is camping in
the park and if you're lucky, quarters can also be found at the Cape de
Couedic lighthouse or in an old cottage near the ranger's station.;    Getting
to Kangaroo Island involves an hourlong ferry ride or a 20-mile flight from
Adelaide in a small plane. Procuring a rental car allows you to see the island
at your own pace. The towns have economy accommodations.;    If you're after
the ultimate wildlife experience, try to hook up with naturalist Mike
McKelvey, who runs the Pelican Lagoon Centre for Ecological Research and
Education.;    McKelvey is a U.S. transplant who has been on the island 17
years. He knows the island like the back of his hand and puts together
itineraries for visiting scientists and naturalists from all over the world.
To enlist his services send $5 (U.S. currency) for first-class return air mail
to: Mike McKelvey, Pelican Lagoon, Penneshaw, Kangaroo Island, SA 5222,
Australia.;  IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; For more general information on Kangaroo
Island contact Tourism South Australia, 2121 Avenue of the Stars, Suite 1210,
Los Angeles 90067; phone (213) 552-2821.;     Fraser Island:; Sand and water; 
Fraser Island sits at the bottom of the Great Barrier Reef about 110 miles
north of Brisbane in southern Queensland. Few Americans have heard of Fraser
Island, yet there are Australian naturalists and adventurers who think the
island rivals the reef itself. Fraser Island is the world's largest sand
island and was created by tidal action and river sediment over the past
million years. It is about 90 miles long and 15 miles wide.;    Though it is
surrounded by ocean, the island is saturated with fresh water. The fresh water
bubbling out of the ground makes crystal-clear streams that cut through lush
rain forests or heath lands. The island's 39 equally clear lakes are unique.
They are "perched lakes," which means they are created entirely by rainwater
and have no inlets. Towering tropical rain forests around Central Station are
spectacular, especially around dusk when hundreds of flying foxes cruise
through the upper canopy.;    The island also contains 75 Mile Beach, huge
sand blows, wild horses (brumbies), the purest strain of dingoes (Australia's
wild native dog), more than 240 species of birds, flying foxes, a healthy
population of dudong (a cousin of the Florida Manatee) offshore, shipwrecks to
explore, a remote turn of the century lighthouse (1881), tropical island dune
ecology and three low-key resorts.;    There is no other place in the world
like Fraser Island. It is continually rearranging itself -- burying forests,
creating new lakes, changing coastlines and forming new sand mountains.;   
Adventurers will be intrigued by the mode of transportation on Fraser. There
is only one puny, pock-marked 4 1/2-mile stretch of road on the entire island.
Vehicular travel is mainly along the beaches or on narrow tracks into the
interior that are marginally passable in four-wheel-drive vehicles, provided
you are a reasonably skilled driver. You're on your own if you get "bogged." I
have spent two hours driving down 75 Mile Beach without seeing another
vehicle.;    Activities include fishing, hiking camping, swimming (lakes as
well as ocean) and not bad snorkeling at the "Champagne Pools" and "Aquarium"
near Indian Heads.;    Visitors get to Fraser Island either by taking a World
War II-style landing barge (Gordon Elmer's Barge or the Rainbow Venture)
across a narrow channel from the mainland or flying to one of the island's
three resorts in light aircraft from Brisbane or other points on the mainland.
Tours are available in four-wheel-drive buses. The Polynesian-style Orchid
Resort, on the north side of the island , is my favorite resort on the
island.;  IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; For more information, contact the Queensland
Tourist and Travel Corp., 611 N. Larchmont Blvd., Los Angeles 90004; phone
(213) 465-8418.;     Bathurst/Melville:; Crossing cultures; Bathurst and
Melville islands, home of the Tiwi, lie about 50 miles north of Darwin in the
Arafura Sea. Visitors usually reach the islands by a 30-minute flight in light
aircraft, sometimes a vintage DC-3. Melville is the second largest of the
islands ringing Australia. Only Tasmania is larger. Bathurst is about
one-third the size of Melville. From an airplane the islands appear to be
irregularly shaped sections of flat, fuzzy green carpet afloat in an azure
sea. The carpet is really a low-growing tropical forest. Rising into the sky
are columns of smoke that mark where the islands' indigenous Tiwi people hove
pursued game by lighting the brush on fire.;    The special aspect of Bathurst
and Melville islands is interfacing with the friendly, low-key Tiwi islanders,
who are living much the way they have for centuries. Tiwis are
hunter/gatherers with a rich culture that is different from that of the
mainland Aborigines. Tiwis are world renowned for their abstract art, which
sells at the small commercial center in Ngiu on Bathurst Island. My time spent
with the Tiwis at Putjamirra was by far the most memorable cross-cultural
experience I've ever had in Australia.;    Visiting the Tiwi islanders isn't
something you can do on your own without going through considerable red tape
to get special permits. Most visitors go on organized tours. There are two
types of tours: the safari camp at Putjamirra and Tiwi Tours, which focuses on
the art and history of the Tiwis on Bathurst. The Tiwi tour is a one-day
affair with a docent and well worth the money (about $150 in U.S. currency).
You are allowed to shop in the Bima Wear Shop, Tiwi Pottery and Tiwi Pima
(totem-like carvings) in Ngiu. Tiwi carvings and prints are shown in the
world's best museums, primarily in Europe. There is a resemblance between
their art and the totem art of the Northwest Indians, but it is in appearance
only. Tiwi art is abstract and colorful, not symbolic. Generally you can buy
items in the island shop for 25 to 50 percent less than in galleries on the
mainland.;    The Putjamirra Safari Camp is more of an immersion experience
than the one-day tour is. Once on Melville's dirt landing strip you are taken
to the camp some 18 miles away. The camp is a small tent village that
overlooks a pristine beach. There is a small sign that warns against swimming
due to the presence of saltwater crocodiles, the largest and most ferocious
crocodiles in the world. Here, you and as many as 12 other guests are fed
excellent meals before being met each morning by a pair of Tiwis, who then
take you on their food-gathering forays.;    One day two Tiwi women I was with
caught a goanna and roasted it. (It tastes like chicken. But if the thought of
trying exotic meat bothers you, don't worry; they don't make you eat it.) On
another day Justin, a gentle and friendly elderly Tiwi man, caught a seagoing
turtle for his family's dinner. Still another day, while collecting wild
oysters in a mangrove area, a large crocodile cruised past us. That was the

DENDERA, Egypt

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Early morning rituals along the Nile haven't changed much in 4,000 years. From 
our boat we watched a woman carefully pick her way down the muddy bank, 
carrying an earthenware water jug over a shoulder, just like those used in 
2,000 BC in the temple reliefs. 
</P>
<P>
At the first rays of the rising sun a flurry of white egrets flapped out of the 
trees. Fishermen poled their triangular-sailed feluccas out into the river and 
unfurled their nets, then began to shout and beat their hands against the sides 
of the wooden boats, flailing the surface of the water with their oars to 
stampede the fish. 
</P>
<P>
On the bank a man washed in preparation for his prayers, then unfolded a square 
piece of cloth and kneeled facing Mecca. Curious children came down to the 
steps to watch our boat tie up, rubbing the sleep from their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
We arrived at this river landing outside Dendera, near Luxor, on Abercrombie 
&amp; Kent's 44-passenger Sun Boat, one of the smallest, newest and most 
luxurious vessels of the nearly 100 that cruise the Nile. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeing the Sights 
</P>
<P>
A cruise boat is the most comfortable way, perhaps the only feasible one, to 
visit the great temples and tombs of the Pharaohs in Upper Egypt. A few of 
them, such as the magnificent temple of Horus at Edfu and the two-god temple at 
Kom Ombo, are only a short walk or carriage ride from the river. 
</P>
<P>
Even better, the air-conditioned interior and breezy deck of the Sun Boat 
provide a welcome respite from the dust and flies, heat and traffic that are 
facts of life in modern Egypt. Even in October, considered the best month for 
weather, it is sunny, hot and dry, with a parching wind that blows from the 
desert. 
</P>
<P>
Our group of 18 on this Nile Discoverer itinerary have our own Egyptologist, 
Mona Saleh, a striking and dynamic woman who doubles as guide, shopping 
negotiator and den mother. 
</P>
<P>
"You must drink at least three liters of water a day to keep from getting 
dehydrated," she said. So each of us dutifully clutched a plastic bottle of 
mineral water everywhere we went. 
</P>
<P>
We boarded the Sun Boat in Luxor the day before, after flying down from Cairo, 
then caroming in cabs past camel markets and adobe villages to stand awe-struck 
in the avenue of the sphinxes outside the vast Temple of Karnak. 
</P>
<P>
(Movie fans would recognize it, especially the hypostyle hall with its 134 
columns, from the film of Agatha Christie's "Death on the Nile.") 
</P>
<P>
In town the temple of Luxor, surrounded by urban traffic, is visibly 
deteriorating, according to Mona, who takes a tour through it every month. "It 
will not last another century," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The forecast is even worse for the temple at Edfu, where sewage from the slums 
crowding against it flow into the ground and seep up into the sandstone and 
limestone temple, making it crumble at the touch of a finger . . . and many 
fingers test it. 
</P>
<P>
The day before our visit, we were told, 4,000 Egyptian (about $1,735 U.S.) of 
entrance fees were collected, but none of it seems to be diverted toward 
relocating the squatters and saving the temple. 
</P>
<P>
Other days included a trek to the tomb of Tutankhamen, a bus to the Aswan High 
Dam, a flight to world-famous Abu Simbel, a boat ride to the relocated island 
temple of Philae and a felucca cruise on the Upper Nile. Tour participants 
spend several days in Cairo at the beginning and end of the cruise seeing the 
Pyramids, Sphinx and Egyptian Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Sun Boat I has 22 comfortable, air-conditioned, nicely decorated cabins with 
big windows for watching the river scenery go by and, we felt, better food and 
service than in the leading land hotels. The housekeeping and maintenance is 
also good. 
</P>
<P>
We recommend the deluxe cabins on the two upper decks over the state cabins on 
the lower deck, because noise from the engines seeps into the latter, in 101 
and 102 especially. 
</P>
<P>
The suggested tip for the five-day trip for two is $25, which is pooled and 
divided among the 40-man Egyptian staff. There is a bar, a modest-size swimming 
pool and an upper deck with chairs and loungers in both sun and shade. 
</P>
<P>
Meals are single-sitting, with a fixed menu of soup, first course, main course 
and dessert for lunch and dinner, along with a daily breakfast buffet and 
afternoon tea. Vegetarian cuisine is available by advance request. The chef 
proved especially skillful at cheese and dessert souffles. 
</P>
<P>
Abercrombie &amp; Kent's 12-day Nile Discoverer and the similar 11-day Nile 
Explorer offer small-group year-round departures at seasonal prices from $1,390 
to $1,990 per person, double occupancy, plus $929 to $999 for round-trip air 
fare aboard British Airways' New York City-to-Cairo service via London. Air 
fare in Egypt is an additional $215. 
</P>
<P>
Bear in mind that a Nile cruise should not be compared to a Caribbean or 
Mediterranean cruise. It is much more akin to expedition sailing, where the 
emphasis is on the sightseeing, some of it arduous, rather than relaxation and 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Some tips for the trip: Take lightweight, launderable cotton clothing, a sun 
hat, strong sunblock, insect repellent and sturdy, practical walking shoes. 
Except when sunbathing or swimming on the boat, dress modestly but comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
Women should not wear shorts or halters ashore. Slacks are quite acceptable. 
You won't need the dressy clothing you would normally carry for a cruise. 
</P>
<P>
While water on the Nile cruise vessels is said to be filtered, it is wise to 
avoid it entirely for drinking, toothbrushing or as ice cubes. (We heard about 
three people in another group who got ill after going to church and taking 
communion.) Sealed bottles of chilled mineral water are available almost 
everywhere and are provided free on the Sun Boat. 
</P>
<P>
Whether on the ship, on shore or in the best hotels, avoid raw vegetables and 
salads and any fresh fruit you cannot peel yourself. Egyptian beer is quite 
good and inexpensive, but we found most of the local wines undrinkable and 
imported ones very costly. 
</P>
<P>
Take care not to overexert yourself, especially in the Valley of the Kings and 
the tomb sites, as heat exhaustion also can lead to illness. 
</P>
<P>
We would not recommend this tour for children younger than 12, for the elderly 
with chronic health problems or anyone who has difficulty walking up or down 
stairs.

ANSWERING CANADA'S CALL OF THE WILD ON A VOYAGE THROUGH THE WILDERNESS

SANDSPIT, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Above the stream flowing into the Pacific Ocean, the majestic bald eagle 
circled lazily, its outstretched wings barely moving. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, in a single movement, the bird swooped down, hardly broke the surface 
of the water, seized a salmon in its talons and rose triumphantly. Before 
disappearing, the eagle turned and flew over its awe-struck audience as if to 
show off its kill. 
</P>
<P>
At the foot of a high cliff, relentless breakers pounded the rocky shore. Above 
the roar of the surf came the cries of a family of eagles wheeling far above on 
the wind currents swirling around the cliff. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unforgettable Images 
</P>
<P>
These were two unforgettable images in a 10-day sailboat voyage through the 
South Moresby wilderness of the Queen Charlotte Islands, 62 miles off British 
Columbia. Known as Canada's Galapagos, the area is protected as a national park 
reserve. 
</P>
<P>
By sailboat, South Moresby can be seen much as the Haida Indians see it. Once 
south of Sandspit you enter an area without roads, communities, facilities or 
services, a true wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
Sailing in South Moresby means anchoring at whim, putting a canoe over the 
side, paddling ashore and exploring for hours. 
</P>
<P>
Take the Bischof Islands, a group of tiny islets at the head of Juan Perez 
Sound. Beach the canoes and climb over the rocks. A red-billed black oyster 
catcher scarcely notices as he sits on a nearby rock. A placid tidal pool 
covers dozens of brilliant red sea urchins and an octopus scuttles under a rock 
as its solitude is broken. 
</P>
<P>
On a ridge perfectly sited between two beaches, an old weathered hammock 
sagging between two trees is still strong enough to support an after-lunch 
siesta. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago a hermit called Butterfly Ron decided this was the place to get 
away from it all. In the bushes is his old bathtub and a beautifully shaped 
piece of driftwood that formed an elegant toilet seat. 
</P>
<P>
Butterfly Ron used to make his own beer. When unsuspecting visitors came ashore 
on what they thought was a deserted island, he would jump out from behind a 
tree and offer a cold one. 
</P>
<P>
Close to the Bischof Islands is Hotspring Island. The springs bubble out of the 
ground near the highest point of this tiny island and fill the pools maintained 
by the Haida. One pool is covered by a hut and there you can soap away in 
privacy. The other open pools offer a more communal form of relaxation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Untouched Rain Forest 
</P>
<P>
North of Hotspring is Lyell Island, which contains Windy Bay watershed. Windy 
Bay symbolizes the struggle to preserve South Moresby and contains one of the 
last untouched stands of rain forest in the Charlottes. 
</P>
<P>
No neat footpaths weave through the woods of Windy Bay. Instead, walk is on a 
springy carpet of thick moss that covers the forest floor. 
</P>
<P>
Moss covers everything like a mantle of gentle green snow, from the smallest 
twigs to the rocks in the creek. It softly rounds the trees that have fallen 
over the years so that it is impossible to tell exactly what is beneath the 
moss. 
</P>
<P>
Giant cedars tower straight and true, living things that are hundreds of years 
old. Some soar for more than 100 feet before a branch occurs. 
</P>
<P>
Even the trees that have fallen to the forest floor over the centuries are not 
really dead. Ferns sprout from their exposed roots and the moss-covered trunks 
act as "nurse logs" to the seeds that fall and take root, sending up new trees. 
Other living trees wear a shaggy overcoat of moss from which spring small 
plants and grasses. 
</P>
<P>
At the extreme southern tip of South Moresby is Kunghit Island, and on its 
northern shore, on Houston Stewart Channel, is Rose Harbour, the site of an old 
whaling station deserted in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
This channel is reputed to be one of the best places on the Pacific Coast to 
view whales, though we had only a glimpse of one. 
</P>
<P>
From Rose Harbour it is a short sail to Anthony Island and the remains of the 
village of Ninstints, the most isolated of all Haida villages and designated a 
United Nations World Heritage cultural site. 
</P>
<P>
A visit to this remote village is a high point of any trip to the Queen 
Charlotte Islands, for it is here that the spirit of the people who inhabited 
these islands for centuries remains the strongest. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Island is exposed to the open Pacific, but Ninstints occupies a 
sheltered site with a single approach on its lee side. 
</P>
<P>
To reach the village you paddle ashore through a cleared channel in the rocks. 
Above the beach stand the gray, weathered totem poles raised by the Haida more 
than 150 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the best poles have been removed over the years; some are in the Museum 
of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
The poles are more visible now than they were a few years ago when the growth 
of the forest threatened to swallow them up. Trees that sprouted between the 
poles have been felled and the weeds on the poles removed. 
</P>
<P>
Remaining poles offer a dramatic impact, with the images of Eagle, Bear and 
Raven glaring out as fiercely as when they were carved by the skilled Haida.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Travel: Hopping about in the sun - A sophisticate's guide to
inter-island Caribbean travel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS A bouncy landing. A difficult one, granted, but bouncy, and in a
19-seater that can be a bit alarming. Still, if the aircraft and passengers
shuddered a little, the pilot was unfazed. Applying reverse thrust with a
flourish, he piped up on the intercom with an almost audible smirk: 'Ladies
and gentlemen, we have just landed . . . for the third time . . . on
Mustique. Please remain seated, etc. I hope you enjoy your stay and take the
opportunity of flying with us again.'
Island-hopping is one of the great pleasures of the Caribbean.
Each island has a different, distinctive feel. You might be lucky and find
one that captivates you for ever - often this is a thing you know
instinctively, almost the moment you put your foot on the wharf or the
airport tarmac. It is easy to get from one island to the next now, and
combining islands can make a more satisfying Caribbean stay.
An hour on a yacht can take you from a busy city waterfront to a deserted
strip of sand and palms while a short air-hop can link tropical France,
replete with chic restaurants, with a slumberstruck cay. If you style
yourself a traveller, getting from one place to the next in tiny aircraft
and leaky local boats can be part of the fun.
Islands are really best approached by sea. You get the measure of them, as
they grow from a grey stain on the horizon to a steep-sided, forested
colossus looming over a tiny settlement. And there is a time-honoured feel
in cruising into a busy wharfside, so rarely experienced now because of air
travel. The Grenadines, of which Mustique is probably the best known, are
particularly good for island-hopping by boat because there is a large number
of islands within such a short distance of one another.
You may choose to travel by gin palace, but there is a lot to be said for
taking the local mail-boat, the MV Snapper, named after a Caribbean fish
rather than the over-large island mosquitos. The Snapper, an old Norwegian
ferry, works its way along the island chain twice a week, carrying
provisions, building materials, soft drinks, livestock and - presumably -
mail. I arrived at dawn and boarding was in process. The scene was of
theatrical and demonstrative West Indian chaos.
I made for an empty seat and found myself next to a goat wrapped in a sack;
only its head protruded. It cocked its eyes at me occasionally, appealing to
me in its bemusement and panic.
It is an hour's ride to Beguia, where you put into a charming waterfront in
Admiralty Bay. Beguia is perhaps the perfect pretty Caribbean island - all
the prettiness of a coastal Cornwall village transported to the tropics.
Past the T-shirt sentry, with her wares slung between the trees as though it
were washing day, you come to a waterfront path where lazy bars in old (some
new) wooden houses are hidden among the frangipani.
But this time I headed on for tiny Mayreau, where there is lazy island life
of a more West Indian kind. Life is hard for the 180-odd islanders, who are
fishermen or work for the government, but they are easy-going and extremely
welcoming. Mayreau is so small and isolated that electricity has not yet
reached it, but you can play dominoes by gas-light, or sit on Dennis's
wooden veranda while he plays the guitar.
Arrival in Mayreau is a novelty in itself because there is no pier big
enough even to take the Snapper, so I had to clamber down into a
coracle-sized lighter along with crates of Coke and the poor old goat in his
sack. He was lucky, though; travelling cattle are simply driven off the
side.
The Grenadine islanders have long been ship-builders. The master-builders
were from Carriacou, an island to the south of Mayreau. Getting there took a
ride in a puttering outboard with a studiedly silent lobster fisherman and
then a hop by local sailboat, but it was worth it. Carriacou has an
enchanting, sedated air, with superb coves and a string of easy-going bars.
Here you can try out the local rum, jackiron. It is extremely strong and has
the curious quality of making ice sink.
The ship-building industry has declined now, though there are still a few
hulls taking shape on the water's edge. As well as boat-builders, the
Grenadine islanders have long been smugglers. Boats from Carriacou travel as
far north as Sint Maarten in the Leeward islands, where they pick up goods
imported directly from Europe: wines, export beers, washing machines and
other white goods.
Carriacou has an easy airstrip in that it is straight and flat, but
occasionally you will find that the pilots make a pass before coming in to
land, in order to buzz cattle that are wandering on the strip. You might be
surprised to see cars beetling across it too - the island's road borrows the
tarmac for a while.
The little island-hopping aircraft, many of them Twin Otters, are jokingly
known as the island bus service. You cannot quite hitch a ride, but you will
find that if there is nobody to pick up or set down at a particular stop,
the aircraft simply flies on by. Certainly you should not expect a direct
flight; en route to your destination you might touch down at five or six
airstrips, each of them a different country.
Flying in this manner has an intimacy with the elements that you don't
experience in a Jumbo. Taking off is entertaining. Landing is another
matter. There is a pecking order of airstrips around the islands (Mustique
rates in the top 10). The second most hair-raising landing strip is on chic
St Barts, in an area aptly named the Plaine de la Tourmente. The problem
here is that there are hills exactly where you would hope the pilot would
make his approach - at both ends. The result is best described as a banana
run-in, close enough one end to pick the flowers and the other to read the
car-drivers' T-shirts.
But most fearsome of all is Saba, a tiny forested pimple in the Leeward
Islands. The airstrip is set on Flat Point (hardly flat, but the nearest
thing Saba has to it). It is 400 yards long - shorter than most
self-respecting aircraft carriers - and there is a 100ft drop into the sea
at either end. It makes Heathrow seem quite boring.

Civilization Intrudes
In All Its Splendor

<TEXT>
   Nothing Conradian happened, mind you. 
No fever or delirium was involved. 
The jungle can't be blamed, nor the sweltering heat, nor the Rajang River winding deeper and deeper into Borneo. 

   No. 
What brought this quest to its knees was the late 20th century. 
Spend a week in darkest Borneo searching for the edge of civilization and what you find these days are computers and jogging shoes, blue jeans and the latest episode of "L.A. 
Law." 
Where is Kurtz when you need him for a story? 

   Go deeper, was the advice. 
We went deeper. 
An hour by boat from this tiny river port and five hours by truck over slick mountain trails gets us to three primitive huts occupied by heavily tattooed Iban natives who cut trees for a logging company. 
Except for the pack of Dunhills that one of the Ibans offers, the 20th century seems distant. 

   Until a phone rings. 
The caller is in a motel room in Anaheim, Calif. 
He is the logging company's local manager, and he is phoning via satellites and hilltop relay towers to say that his Disneyland vacation is going great. 
He dialed the jungle direct. 

   You would think that the search for civilization's edge would be easy on an island like Borneo, a France-sized redoubt of rain forests, rivers and rhinoceros beetles the size of toy Volkswagens. 
Alas, these days a pilgrimage up three rivers into the heart of Sarawak, Malaysia's largest and least developed state, can't get you beyond TV antennas and T-shirts that proclaim "California Kid" and "Check Me Out" and "Northern Michigan University." 

   It is a trifle disconcerting to arrive at a village market six hours by longboat from the coast only to find that Australian apples, Chinese pears and Sunkist oranges got there first; and to travel another two hours to an Iban longhouse -- a motel-like structure on stilts -- and find that politicians had popped in by helicopter the day before to festoon the place with party banners; and to watch, at a tiny river port, the unloading of boxes that contain frozen chicken wings "Made in the U.S.A." 

   The latest modern infestation is mobile phones -- a blessing for Sarawak politicians whose constituencies are often far beyond telephone poles. 
But mudslinging on the move has its drawbacks. 

   Campaigning for a state legislature seat last month, one candidate had to stop a speech to answer his briefcase phone. 
"Call me back," he told the reporter on the other end. 
Another candidate answered his phone on a longboat heading up-river. 
But he couldn't hear the reporter's questions because the boat's engine was making too much noise. 
It's a real political jungle out there. 

   The beginning of the journey was promising enough. 
Never mind the arrival by jet at Kuching, the state capital. 
River boats remain Borneo's preferred means of transport. 
In most places, there is no choice because there are no roads or airports. 
So we hop a water taxi down the Sarawak River, then a tired old longboat back upstream -- a sort of mood-setting exercise for the exotica to come. 

   Matted green clumps of jungle glide by as the boat's diesel groans against the river's stiff current. 
Around one bend, two fishermen in flimsy canoes heave nets into the coffee-colored water. 
Rickety wooden docks poke out from thick riverbank foliage that shades tin-roofed houses. 

   Suddenly the clouds burst in a tropical downpour, sending the lone passenger and the boatman's dog scurrying for shelter amid banana stalks, empty beer bottles and gasoline drums under the boat's leaky wooden canopy. 
Attempts in three languages to evoke Conrad and Maugham elicit only tolerant nods from the boatman. 
But he produces a dog-eared pamphlet warning that "unforgettable exotic sights and sounds await you in the land of the historic headhunters and white rajahs." 

   Sure enough, around the next bend stands what for Sarawak's 1.5 million residents, most of them villagers, is a pinnacle of exotica that looks as if it got lost on the way to Houston. 
It is called the Sarawak Plaza Shopping Complex -- 10 stories of offices and shops, plus a parking garage and an adjacent Holiday Inn. 
It is the newest of five such shopping complexes in Kuching. 

   Outside the enclosed complex, the steamy air is heavy with the smell of diesel fumes and overripe fruit. 
Inside, frigid air carries the aromas from a Famous Amos chocolate-chip-cookie franchise. 
Disco beats pulsate from a dozen fashion boutiques and hair-styling salons ($6.40 will get you a cut and comb, $40 the fanciest permanent). 

   Since school is out, Sarawak Plaza is bustling with a species of teen-ager known in suburban America as the "mall rat." 
Young men -- ethnic Chinese, Malays, Ibans -- wear baggy trousers and shirts, and their hair is slicked back with styling mousse. 
Girls with four shades of color between their eyelids and brows flit up and down escalators and in and out of music and video shops (you can rent this year's Oscar-winning "Platoon" for two days for $1.20). 

   Upriver, men demonstrate the business end of a blowgun. 
Here, at the Ngiu Kee department store, cosmetologists demonstrate the new Bio line of natural-ingredient makeup put out by Kenebo, the Japanese cosmetics firm. 
At the Sha Na Na fast-food shop, "halal" food -- food acceptable to orthodox Muslims -- is served: Halal fish-head curry costs $1.28, while a halal cheeseburger goes for 68 cents. 
One floor down, a sign reads in Malay: "Kesedapanya Hingga Menjilat Jari," which translates to "Tastiness Until Licking Fingers." 
Kentucky Fried Chicken, of course. 
A live, four-inch-long scorpion is displayed in a glass case at the mall's only tourist shop. 
"It eats cockroaches," says Linda, the sales clerk. 
The mall, however, is much too cold and sanitary for cockroaches. 
"I bring them from home," Linda says. 

   "I am a headhunter," jokes Patricia Depeni, the Iban manager of the state tourist bureau's branch in the shopping center. 
She bursts into giggles. 
"You must go upriver," she says. 

   We go upriver. 

   At the wharf in Sibu, express longboats rest hull to hull awaiting passengers heading up the Rajang River for Kapit and Belaga. 
Public express boat No. 5 has 52 padded seats. 
It is air-conditioned. 
As it roars upriver at 30 miles per hour, endless stretches of jungle fly by, punctuated by an occasional longhouse. 
The captain keeps an eye on the river for floating logs and other debris. 
Only a visitor stands on deck admiring the scenery. 

   Inside the cabin, the curtains are drawn so the other passengers can watch videos. 
First a Chuck Norris thriller. 
Then a British top-40 rock show. 
Then the clear favorite: Hulk Hogan wrestling. 
An old man of the Kenyah tribe, who sports quarter-sized holes in the tops and lobes of both ears to accommodate ceremonial ornaments, is riveted to the action, especially when a black wrestler dressed as an African jungle savage enters the ring. 

   Here we are later in Kapit's only air-conditioned bar, and thus the town's hot spot, with yesterday's phone call from Anaheim still ringing in our ears. 
We are confessing failure to a local friend. 
But he is having trouble hearing because a Malay-Filipino rock band, called D-Illusions and as flat as the draft beer, is belting out a charming 20th-century lyric, "Gimme money, that's what I want."

<HL> Environmentalists in Brazil Mobilize In Bid to Save Once-Vast Atlantic Forest </HL>
<SO> </SO>

<DATELINE> RIO DE JANEIRO (AP)  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists are mobilizing to save what is left of Brazil's once-vast Atlantic forest, the nation's picture-postcard front door. 

   One of the species of trees near extinction is the brazilwood, or pau-Brazil, which gave the country its name. 

   When Portuguese explorers discovered Brazil in 1500, the Atlantic forest covered about 170,000 square miles along a 3,000-mile coastal strip. 

   Today, with 80 million of the country's 143 million people and most of its heavy industry crowded into the coastal zone, only about 3% of the original primary forest remains -- in scattered patches. 

   Some of the forest's rare monkeys, birds and trees, many found nowhere else in the world, face extinction. 

   "We are in the process of destroying an entire ecosystem, but there's still time to save what's left and prevent total tragedy," said Rodrigo Lara Mesquita, the chairman of a group called the S.O.S. Atlantic Forest Foundation. 

   The foundation has strong economic and political influence. 

   Mr. Mesquita is an heir of the family that for a century has controlled the influential O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper and media group. 
Others running S.O.S. include two multimillionaire industrialists, the president of the country's largest university and a retired admiral. 

   Since 1986, the foundation has raised the equivalent of more than US$4 million for nationwide newspaper and television publicity. 
It intends to collect more, for the satellite mapping of the forest zone and for conservation programs where the remaining forest is thickest. 

   "This group is powerful and well organized," said Russell A. Mittermeier, international vice chairman of the Washington-based World Wildlife Fund and a consultant to the Atlantic Forest organization. 
"It's not radical, as unfortunately was the case with many well-meaning but ineffective environmental groups that sprang up in the United States in the 1960s. 
I'm very optimistic." 

   Mr. Mittermeier has been traveling to Brazil since 1971, principally to work with the Atlantic forest's endangered monkey species. 

   He said in an interview in Rio de Janeiro that Brazil probably has the best chance for success of the "three highest-priority ecological problems in the world" -- the tropical South American Andes in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru; the African island of Madagascar; and the Atlantic forest. 

   "Here in the Atlantic forest, it really is possible to save the remnants," Mr. Mittermeier said. 
He mentioned specifically the muriqui, South America's largest primate, of which fewer than 100 remain; the Golden Lion Tamarin, another endangered monkey, with about 400 left; the increasingly scarce red-tailed parrot; the rare and valuable jacaranda tree; and the almost extinct pau-Brazil. 

   "Today, with few exceptions, the only place you can still see pau-Brazil is in a botanical garden," Mr. Mesquita said. 

   Early Portuguese pioneers chopped down all the brazilwood they could find to extract dye. 
Later settlers hacked away the coastal forest to make way for sugar cane and coffee plantations and for settlements. 

   The S.O.S. Atlantic Forest Foundation's logotype is a stylized green, yellow and blue Brazilian flag, but with part of the green ripped away. 

   A foundation poster shows a map of Brazil with an outline of the Atlantic forest as it existed in 1500, with the words, in Portuguese, "I Used to Be Like This." 
Then there is a map showing the scattered forest pockets left today and the words, "I Wound Up Like This." 

   The foundation's first specific project is to be in a still relatively untouched forest zone covering 3,500 square miles along the coasts of the southeastern states of Sao Paulo and Parana. 
It intends to set up two ecological bases and buy a patrol-type boat to sound the alarm against illegal tree cutting and the banned netting of coastal fish, shrimp and oysters. 

   "Invasion of that region has long gone unpunished," S.O.S. Chairman Mesquita said. 
"But we think we can stop it. 
We're organized, we've got money, and we have access to the authorities and the media." 

   The foundation also supported lobbying efforts in Brazil's congress to place in the draft of a new constitution the legal concept of "ecological crime." 

   "We're also attempting a process of environmental education," said Ibsen de Gusmao Camara, the former admiral who now is a member of the S.O.S board. 
"A lot of Brazilians think development automatically means physical occupation. 
It's not that they purposely want to destroy the environment. 
They just don't know any better." 

   "We'll never see the Atlantic forest again as it once was," he added. 
"That's impossible. 
But we will put a stop to the destruction and preserve and build up the forest's 'genetic library.'"

FT  24 SEP 94 / Travel: Afloat in the deep jungle - On Safari
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I was alone, paddling a small dug-out canoe through flooded rainforest. The
boat was borrowed, the paddle my own, traded with the Jagua Indians for
valued T-shirts, and the forest was immense, writes Michael J.  Woods.
The low afternoon sun penetrated the riverine trees, illuminating trunks
whitened by lichens and the greens of thin palm fronds and huge leaved
epiphytes. These, in turn, were reflected in the Amazon's motionless waters
which, in spite of a patina of dust, leaves and twigs, formed a perfect
reverse image.
A ringed kingfisher flew across the water, a large bird with chestnut belly,
white collar and determined manner, while a crimson crested woodpecker, in
black with a red cap, pecked delicately at a dead stump.
The Amazon near Iquitos in Peru, still 1,200 miles from the sea and normally
five miles across, was flooded to almost twice its width. Banana fields were
submerged, the houses, all on stilts, stood just above the flood, and water
lapped deep into the forest.
From Iquitos, a small town of crumbling facades, rusty corrugated iron and
an atmosphere redolent of Greene and Conrad, we motored downstream to the
Explorama Camp in a long narrow boat thatched against sun and rain.
This was the first of three camps I visited, all designed in fundamentally
the same simple and unobtrusive way with bedroom blocks linked by covered
walkways to showers, toilets and communal areas festooned with hammocks.
There is no electricity, little plumbing and the limited privacy in the
bedrooms, which are designed to encourage a flow of air. The locations are
perfect, the food good and the beds comfortable and well-netted to prevent
mosquitoes 'singing a private song in your ear', as Julio Parano, our
Peruvian Indian guide so aptly put it.
Visiting at a time of high water had its advantages, for though the jungle
walks were curtailed, we made up for that with river cruises in open boat.
The rivers, twisting, caramel-coloured and soupy with silt, are the highways
of the rainforest. There is constant traffic ranging from overloaded banana
boats labouring upstream to the quick canoes of children which, on school
days, line the shore by the schools.
Parano, now a conservationist and guide, was raised as a hunter in the
jungle and has senses appropriately honed. From the water his keen eyes
spotted greenish coloured three-toed sloths clinging motionless to bankside
foliage; he pointed out a bushy-tailed squirrel which scampered high into
the tree tops; and once, identifying a pygmy marmoset by its squall, scoured
the vegetation with his binoculars until he located its tiny form.
Swallow-tailed kites wheeled above the trees, egrets hunted the shallows and
parrots screeched past on whirring wings.
One afternoon Julio took us in search of the hoatzin (pronounced watson), a
noisy chicken-sized bird of some scarcity living on a lake in the centre of
a forested island. High water had joined the pool to the river but, our long
boat was too big to penetrate the trees.
Unperturbed, Julio intercepted a local lad who was paddling past and hired
him to carry us in pairs in his canoe, weaving deftly through the trunks, to
spot several hoatzins as they squawked to one another in the twilight.
Life with Julio was never dull. Unannounced, we would pull into villages to
see what was going on. We were invited into houses to watch the cooking of
manioc and the salting of fish; we weaved thatch, paddled canoes and joined
local men in netting fish.
Holding the heavy folds of the net in hands and teeth with a loop over one
elbow, we whirled it outwards to open like a parachute, theoretically
hitting the water in a circle and sliding through the surface to trap fish
in its mesh bell. Although in practice the circle was often far from
perfect, the fish were so numerous that every cast was a success.
Everything in the rainforest seems to have grown to excessive size. Lily
pads were like tea trays, insects as big as mice, butterflies the size of
bats and bats as large as crows.
But for a habitat as rich and varied as this, there is surprisingly little
to see at ground level, for most of life goes on in the tree-tops.
Fortunately, the Amazon Centre for Environmental Education and Research
offers an opportunity, unique in South America, to wander around the canopy
more than 100ft above the ground on a series of swooping suspension bridges.
As I looked down, the jungle hummed and whined like a very bad international
telephone line, interrupted periodically by pings and buzzes, yelps and
yaps, while at my feet stretched a billowing carpet of leaves in every
imaginable shade of green, from the palest celery to the blackest spring
cabbage.
Brightly-coloured birds stood out from its surface - azure-spangled
cotingas, golden woodpeckers, green honeycreepers and red-throated
caracaras. I watched a centipede make its sinuous way over the crevasses of
bark and wondered idly if this was a species previously known to man.
After the still, dark, humid oppression of the forest floor, the canopy
walkway supplied a breath of fresh air. But the best moments were on the
river as day broke.
The soft light of dawn cast everything in a greeny-grey shade, a veil of
mist shrouded the tree-tops and their perfect reflections wrinkled in our
wake. Fishermen cast their nets with gentle splashes and blue-grey woodsmoke
rose from rekindled fires. Apart from the quiet calls of children in their
red cedar canoes, the only other sound was the dripping of water from
up-raised paddles as we glided slowly through the Amazon jungle.

FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Southern France (8): Cote d'Azur, take a
sentimental journey - The region's museums and art galleries embellish its
glamorous image
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAVELLING around the Cote d'Azur conjures images of Brigitte Bardot sunning
herself in Saint Tropez during the 1960s, or the packed pavement cafes of
coastal towns in the 1990s.
But there is another aspect to the Cote d'Azur, the tiny museums and art
galleries tucked away in the Provencal hills, or clinging to the cliffs
along the sea. These are the places that give a glimpse of the south before
the Bardot-boom and of the serene lifestyle that attracted some of Europe's
most famous artists - such as Renoir, Matisse and Picasso - to the region.
Musee Renoir is typical. It is a sturdy stone house perched in the hills
above Cagnes-sur-Mer where the painter, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, lived with
his wife and three sons from 1909 to 1919. The house and its contents have
been left intact. Renoir's wheelchair is still in the studio, as are his
easels, brushes and frames. The walls are hung with his paintings and those
of friends such as Bonnard and Dufy.
The garden is lovely, with ancient olive trees straggling down the hill and
a view that stretches to the Cape of Antibes. But the real appeal of the
museum, as with all France's musees sentimentaux, is that it is impossible
to visit without imagining what it was like when Renoir himself lived and
worked there. (Musee Renoir, avenue des Collettes, Cagnes-sur-Mer. Tel: 9320
6107.)
If Renoir was content with a simple rustic house, Pablo Picasso's taste was
a little more opulent. Picasso spent a long part of his life in the south,
but one of the best collections of his work is at Musee Grimaldi-Picasso on
the Antibes waterfront, where he lived for the summer and autumn of 1946.
Musee Grimaldi-Picasso is a pretty old stone castle with stunning views onto
the sea. The collection, although not as impressive as in the Musee Picasso
in Paris, has a decent selection of oil paintings, ceramics and sculpture,
most of which were completed while Picasso lived there. (Musee
Grimaldi-Picasso, place Mariejol, Antibes. Tel: 9334 9191.)
A little further along the coast from Antibes in the village of Biot is the
Musee National Fernand Leger, the fruit of a donation by his wife, Nadine,
to the French government, which houses one of the most extensive collections
of Leger's work.
The museum, contains many of Leger's most important paintings. The building,
a modernist edifice set in rolling lawns and embellished with Leger's own
brightly coloured friezes, is spectacular. The collection is illustrated by
sketches and photographs which give a glimpse of the gregarious artist's
life. (Musee National Fernand Leger, chemin du Val de Pome, Biot. Tel: 9365
6349.)
The Cote d'Azur also houses a number of private collections. Fondation
Ephrussi de Rothschild on Cap-Ferrat has an air of the Hollywood hills with
its motley assortment of antique treasures - a Grecian column here, a Gothic
doorway there - and its candy-coloured Italianate facade.
The house was built at the turn of the century as a home for the baroness'
collection of art and furniture, which ran from Tiepolo ceilings to Louis
XIV chairs, Beauvais tapestries, Fragonard paintings and the tiny circular
room on the ground floor where she entertained her lovers. (Fondation
Ephrussi de Rothschild, Cap-Ferrat. Tel: 9301 3309.)
A very different collection is lodged high in the hills near the village of
Saint-Paul-de-Vence at Fondation Maeght. This is the gallery bequeathed by
the Maeghts, a family of Paris art dealers, to house their private
collection and temporary exhibitions which include some of the best-known
names in modern art, including Giacometti, Miro, Arp and Zadkine. (Fondation
Maeght, 06570 Saint-Paul-de-Vence. Tel: 9332 8163.)
The village is also home to La Colombe d'Or, the famous restaurant, where
Picasso, Braque, Calder, Miro and Chagall used to eat, paying for their food
with their work. The restaurant, now run by the fourth generation of the
founding Roux family, has been left with an art collection - a Leger frieze
along the terrace, Braques and Picassos hung between the tables - which
would be the envy of many museums.
French foodies are wont to say that La Colombe d'Or's food is not as good as
it used to be - but they tend to say that about almost every restaurant. Its
tables quake under the weight of hearty Provence fare and it still scores a
respectable 12 out of 20 in the snooty Gault Millau guide. (La Colombe d'Or,
06570 Saint-Paul. Tel: 9332 8002.)
Visitors to Saint-Paul should also look in on the Chapelle du Rosaire in the
neighbouring village of Vence, a tiny church designed by Henri Matisse, who
believed that it included his finest pieces of stained glass. (Chapelle du
Rosaire, Avenue Henri Matisse, Vence.)

<LEADPARA>  IN THE middle of Pygmy territory, slightly south of the Sudan and west of the
Ugandan border, I spent three hot, grueling days in the back of a beer truck
as it lurched down a severely pot-holed track through the jungle to Kisangani.
Kisangani was no haphazard destination for those of us on the truck. The
driver, for one, was delivering two goats to his uncle and taking 150 empty
cases of beer bottles for refilling. I was meeting the Zaire River barge to
repeat the last half of H.M. Stanley's journey of 100 years ago, when he
became the first known person to travel the river from its source to the
Atlantic Ocean -- some 1,400 miles downstream.;   After three days on the
road, however, my goals became less lofty, and I wanted only to eat, sleep and
wash up, not necessarily in that order. When we finally arrived, the driver
dropped my traveling companion and me off in front of the Olympia Hotel.
Although slightly decrepit-looking, the place was no less than a vision to us.
We checked in, washed up, wolfed down a plate of spanakopita and went to bed.
Two days later, we were on the barge along with 1,000 or so other passengers
as it pulled away from the bank and blew its final hoot.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Squeezed onto five barges lashed together to a length of about one city
block and a width of 16 yards, the crowds on board looked like a chaotic
assembly of movie extras. For 10 days, this floating oddity hauled us from
Kisangani -- traveling past masses of tangled equatorial forest next to
limestone cliffs and rolling plains -- to Kinshasa, Zaire's capital, and the
river mouth leading to the Atlantic Ocean.;   I woke early the first morning
on the barge so I would have ample time to explore. Narrow hallways outside
the second-class cabins and on the lower decks became flourishing markets.
Business people set up miniature stalls and sold black-market penicillin,
malaria pills, peanuts or jewelry.;   This constant buying and selling proved
to be the prime entertainment over the next 10 days. Except at larger towns,
the barge rarely stopped. Instead, villagers paddled up to the barge, canoes
piled high with the specialty of their village -- bananas, avocados, dried
monkey meat, freshly shot antelope, bamboo chairs. To catch up to the
fast-moving barge, they stood to paddle. With babies on their backs and their
hair a mass of wired pigtails, merchant women paddled in, grabbed railings and
began to barter even before stepping on board. At times, as many as 100 canoes
were attached to the boat.;   The bartering reached chaotic proportions. Most
Zairians spoke French, the official language, and one or two of the other
major languages: Tshiluba Kikongo or Kiswahili. But for business transactions
on the river barge, people spoke Ungala, the language of the river. Sellers
yelled out offers. Potential buyers responded with disbelieving guffaws. Women
rolled their eyes and threw their hands in the air at especially ludicrous
prices. More than once, I stepped outside my cabin door in the middle of the
night to see what the racket was about. Nothing -- this was normal life here
on the barge.;   Haircuts and hand lotion; Once a villager sold all the
bananas, palm wine or whatever filled his canoe, he stepped on board, bought
cigarettes and razor blades, and maybe got a haircut from the resident barber.
Women bought cloth, soap, sugar, rice, and might treat themselves to a bottle
of hand lotion. Afterward, they paddled back to their villages, which were by
then miles upstream.;   We went first class, mainly because we wanted more
than the one meal a day offered in second or third class. Also, sleeping in a
cabin seemed like a good idea. Third-class passengers established territory
anywhere they found two square yards of space. A first-class room was about 6
by 6 feet with two narrow cots, a small shower and a toilet. The rooms were
air-conditioned erratically throughout the afternoon and night. (Even at six
in the morning, the temperature hovered at a humid 90.);   Zaire is one
massive river basin filled with forest and the Zaire River arcing its way
almost 3,000 miles from the south up and across the equator and back down. So
not surprisingly, most transportation is via the river on riverboats, ferries,
tugs or pirogues, canoes made of hollowed-out trees. Shortly after Stanley's
journey, the Belgians opened a trade route up the Zaire into Kisangani and
other villages deep within that area to ship out rubber and ivory. Later,
Zaire became a major slave market for Belgium's King Leopold.;   For many on
board, this trip was not a journey, but a job. Raja and Antoine rode back and
forth between Kisangani and Kinshasa selling combs and other toiletry items on
the barge. Other sellers collected goods in the country and hauled them to the
capital, Kinshasa. Onions hauled there fetched 10 times what they cost in the
rural areas. Goats, chickens -- even crocodiles -- were hauled alive. Chicks
and baby crocodiles were cooked and eaten as a snack. Commodities needing
preservation were singed and dried over a charcoal stove, such as monkey meat,
or sun-baked and stacked in baskets, such as eels.;   European-style meals
were served in the first-class dining lounge. The cook baked freshly caught
capitaine fish, or served roast beef with potatoes and gravy -- a rare treat
in Zaire. The bazaar-bedecked third-class area served its own fast-food fare.
You could start with grubs, live or barbecued, as an appetizer, washed down
with a weak beer, then walk to the next stall for sardines, cooked in a hot
pepper sauce, and then, round off the meal with a couple of sweet doughnuts
deep-fried before you. One evening, after lengthy soul-searching, I tried
fresh monkey meat -- a common Zairian meal. It tasted like tender stew meat.; 
 Dance beneath a setting sun; Every night, music floated from the dance hall
-- an odd combination of American rock and African chanting. When we didn't go
dancing, we climbed a ladder to the barge's rooftop, settled onto our portable
bamboo stools (bought on Day One from a villager), and prepared for the
evening show -- the setting sun. Near the equator, it appeared large and
glowed pink, then orange, before dipping down into a yolky haze. We welcomed
the cooling blackness as much as the captain disliked it. (Navigating the
river at night was tricky, and at times impossible.);   Just north of the
equator lies Mbandaka, a major point along the route where the Zaire River
meets the Ubangui, one of its tributaries. It was the sixth night of our
journey, and Raja, Antoine, my friend and I decided to go for a drink in town.
Sitting around a table outdoors, we talked late into the night about the
differences between Zaire and North America, not knowing when the whistle
would blow and signal us to make a mad dash for the departing barge.;   As it
turned out, it didn't leave till the next morning. I sat on the deck outside
my door and watched the morning fog rise to expose pockets of bamboo stalks
along the riverbank. I realized I was anxious to arrive in Kinshasa. I was
traveling in relative luxury compared to most people on the barge, but the
drain of being on a floating hotel with 999 other "guests" started to take
effect.;   Night's revealing lights; Late on the ninth day, the captain
anchored in Stanley's Pool -- a 15-by-20-mile bulge in the river. In place of
palm and towering limbo trees, rolling hills and grazing land surrounded me.
The selling slowed and passengers prepared to get off the boat. Night came as
we waited, revealing the lights of Kinshasa and Brazzaville, capital of the
Congo. The widening of the river suggested we were near the Atlantic Ocean,
yet we were still 300 miles inland.;   The next morning, we headed into the
port of Kinshasa. It felt good to walk on land again. We flagged a taxi to

   The chaotic development that is gobbling up the
Amazon rain forest could finally be reined in with a new plan
developed by officials of Amazon countries and leading scientists
from around the world.
   ``That's some of the most encouraging news about the Amazon rain
forest in recent years,'' said Thomas Lovejoy, a tropical ecologist
at the Smithsonian Institution and an Amazon specialist.
   ``It contrasts markedly with a year ago, when there was nothing
to read about conservation in the Amazon, especially in Brazil,
except bad news,'' Lovejoy said in a recent interview.
   Sixty percent of the Amazon, the world's largest tropical rain
forest, lies in Brazil, but the forest also covers parts of eight
surrounding countries.
   Lovejoy was one of the organizers of an unusual workshop held in
mid-January in Manaus, Brazil, a sprawling city of 1 million people
in the heart of the Amazon. It was the center of Brazil's
once-thriving rubber trade.
   The workshop, which brought together all the governments and
scientists with interests in the rain forest, culminated with a
plan to regulate development in up to 80 percent of the Amazon
region.
   It was the first time that all parties concerned with the Amazon
had met to pool their knowledge and agree on conservation
priorities, the meeting's participants said.
   The plan devised at the workshop has no legal force. But it has
broad government support and is likely to serve as a guide for
national conservation programs, participants said.
   Many of the areas to be preserved will be open to so-called
multiple-use development, which preserves the forest while allowing
tourism and the commercial exploitation of fibers, fruits and
medicinal plants.
   Brazil, struggling with a teetering economy and pressured by
developers and peasant farmers to clear the forest for cattle
ranching or farming, has been ambivalent about the need to conserve
the Amazon.
   Brazil participated in the Manaus workshop, however, and the
setting of priorities was ``all done with the blessing of Brazil,''
Lovejoy said.
   Tropical rain forests are giant, living warehouses for thousands
of plant andanimal species. The Amazon alone is home to 30 percent
of the world's plant and animal species.
   One study found that a single square yard of leaf litter taken
from the deep shadows of the Amazon floor contained 800 ants
representing 50 species.
   Towering forest canopies up to 300 feet above the forest floor
are home to countless birds and insects that live their lives
without ever setting foot on the ground. One group of orchid
species grows only near the top of the canopy; an entirely
different collection of orchids grows at the bottom.
   At the Manaus meeting, more than 100 specialists met in small
groups to assess conservation priorities.
   Insect specialists compared data on such creatures as the
stinging ant that defends acacia trees against predators.
Mammologists took inventory of the Amazon's screeching monkeys.
Ichthyologists considered such oddities as the fish that eats
fallen fruits and nuts on the Amazon River's banks when it
overflows. Botanists, ornithologists and others did the same.
   Then they pooled their information and marked up maps of the
Amazon. When they were done, the areas determined to be worth
saving covered 70 percent to 80 percent of the Amazon.
   ``The bulk of the Amazon is a biological priority; there's no
way of getting around that,'' said Russell Mittermeier, president
of Conservation International and an authority on endangered
monkeys.
   Mittermeier emphasized, however, that the plan set realistic
goals for the establishment of national parks and reserves, along
with multiple-use areas where some development could occur.
   It is not realistic to build a fence around 70 percent to 80
percent of the Amazon, he said. Only the most critical areas should
be placed off limits to development.
   ``Ten to 20 percent of the entire Amazon should be in protected
parks or preserves, ideally,'' he said. At present, 2 percent of
the Amazon is protected.
   Brazil was not alone in its support for the conservation plan.
   ``The results of this meeting are a major contribution towards
the work that has got to be done,'' said Stanley Malone, director
of the Suriname Forest Service.
   Suriname was one of eight Amazon countries that agreed in 1978
to develop a unified approach to management of the Amazon, Malone
said. What the officials lacked, however, was a guide to which
areas most needed protection.
   That determination has now been made, based on the number of
different species a given area contained, and on how many of those
species were endemic, or unique, to the area.
   ``Now we'll have to see what develops from this,'' Mittermeier
said. A new Brazilian president, Fernando Collor de Mello, will be
inaugurated March 15, and with him will come a new Brazilian
environmental policy.
   Whether the policy will include support for the Manaus plan is
uncertain. ``As always, everything depends on key individuals,''
Mittermeier said.
   ``I'm basically always optimistic,'' he said. ``I feel sure that
we can develop appropriate solutions, although it may take a lot of
work.''

   Environmentalists are mobilizing
to save what's left of Brazil's once-vast Atlantic forest, the
nation's picture-postcard front door.
   One of the species of trees near extinction is the brazilwood,
or pau-Brazil, which gave the country its name.
   When Portuguese explorers discovered Brazil in 1500, the
Atlantic forest covered some 170,000 square miles along a
3,000-mile coastal strip.
   Today, with 80 million of the country's 143 million people and
most of its heavy industry crowded into the coastal zone, only
about 3 percent of the original primary forest remains _ in
scattered patches.
   Some of the forest's rare monkeys, birds and trees, many found
nowhere else in the world, face extinction.
   ``We are in the process of destroying an entire ecosystem. But
there's still time to save what's left and prevent total tragedy,''
said Rodrigo Lara Mesquita, the chairman of a group called the
S.O.S. Atlantic Forest Foundation.
   The foundation has strong economic and political influence.
   Mesquita is an heir of the family that for a century has
controlled the influential O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper and media
group. Others running S.O.S. include two multimillionaire
industrialists, the president of the country's largest university
and a retired admiral.
   Since 1986, the foundation has raised the equivalent of more
than $4 million for nationwide newspaper and television publicity.
It intends to collect more, for the satellite mapping of the forest
zone and for actual conservation programs where the remaining
forest is thickest.
   ``This group is powerful and well organized,'' said Russell A.
Mittermeier, international vice chairman of the Washington-based
World Wildlife Fund and a consultant to the Atlantic Forest
organization. ``It's not radical, as unfortunately was the case
with many well meaning but ineffective environmental groups that
sprang up in the United States in the 1960s. I'm very optimistic.''
   Mittermeier has been coming to Brazil since 1971, principally to
work with Atlantic forest's endangered monkey species.
   He said in an interview in Rio de Janeiro that Brazil probably
has the best chance for success of the ``three highest-priority
ecological problems in the world'' _ the tropical South American
Andes in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru; the African island of
Madagascar, and the Atlantic forest.
   ``Here in the Atlantic forest it really is possible to save the
remnants,'' Mittermeier said. He mentioned specifically the
muriqui, South America's largest primate, of which fewer than 100
remain; the Golden Lion Tamarin, another endangered monkey, with
about 400 left; the increasingly scarce red-tailed parrot; the rare
and valuable jacaranda tree, and the almost extinct pau-Brazil.
   ``Today, with few exceptions, the only place you can still see
pau-Brasil is in a botanical garden,'' lamented Mesquita.
   Early Portuguese pioneers chopped down all the brazilwood they
could find to extract dye. Later settlers hacked away the coastal
forest to make way for sugar-cane and coffee plantations and for
settlements.
   The S.O.S. Atlantic Forest Foundation's logotype is a stylized
green-yellow-and-blue Brazilian flag, but with part of the green
ripped away.
   A foundation poster shows a map of Brazil with an outline of the
Atlantic Forest as it existed in 1500, with the words, in
Portuguese, ``I Used to be Like This.'' Then there is a map showing
the scattered forest pockets left today and the words, ``I Wound Up
Like This.''
   The foundation's first specific project is to be in a
still-relatively untouched forest zone covering 3,500 square miles
along the coasts of the southeastern states of Sao Paulo and
Parana. It intends to set up two ecological bases and buy a
patrol-type boat to sound the alarm against illegal tree cutting
and the banned netting of coastal fish, shrimp and oysters.
   ``Invasion of that region has long gone unpunished,'' S.O.S.
Chairman Mesquita said. ``But we think we can stop it. We're
organized, we've got money, and we have access to the authorities
and the media.''
   The foundation also supported lobby efforts in Brazil's Congress
to place in the draft of a new constitution the legal concept of
``ecological crime.''
   ``We're also attempting a process of environmental education,''
said Ibsen de Gusmao Camara, the former admiral who now is a member
of the S.O.S board. ``A lot of Brazilians think development
automatically means physical occupation. It's not that they
purposely want to destroy the environment. They just don't know any
better.''
   ``We'll never see the Atlantic forest again as it once was,'' he
added. ``That's impossible. But we will put a stop to the
destruction and preserve and build up the forest's `genetic
library'.''

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS: Orchid Oasis in the Bronx </HL>

<DATELINE> New York  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York's first Public Orchid Space opened this week in the Bronx -- the borough that nurtures, along with the Yankees and urban blight, this city's only tropical rain forest. 
With the Thekla E. Johnson Rotunda and Orchid Terrarium -- a million-dollar and 750-orchid gift from publisher Walter J. Johnson (and offspring) in memory of his wife -- in situ central at the New York Botanical Garden's Museum Building, the borough now has a secure, year-round orchid-viewing habitat. 

   Orchids are profoundly sexy, an observation that caused Charles Darwin to write a 366-page book, "On the Various Contrivances by Which British and Foreign Orchids Are Fertilised by Insects, and on the Good Effects of Intercrossing." 
Their often ostentatious, complex beauty is thoroughly, deceitfully utilitarian. 
In the course of co-evolution, orchids have contrived the floral likenesses of bees, spiders, wasps and flies among others, to the sexual cuckolding of those animals -- and the orchids' own pollination satisfaction. 

   Orchids also have seduced people, among them the late Thekla Johnson, a longtime member of the Working Gardeners of Bronxville (N.Y.). 
She was "an orchid fanatic" recalls Stefan Wilgermein, a retired senior gardener at NYBG, who worked 15 years with her orchids. 
"They were her babies. 
Once the cymbidiums got a virus and some had to be destroyed. 
I think she cried the whole night." 

   Mr. Wilgermein remembers that Thekla Johnson "paid special attention to the phalaenopsis," the demurely showy Southeast Asian moth orchids. 
Now she is one. 
"Phalaenopsis" Memoria Thekla E. Johnson, a white hybrid commissioned and named by the Greater New York Orchid Society, arrived here Friday from Hawaii. 

   It is impossible to get involved with just one orchid, as Mrs. Johnson learned, given an extended family that runs to upward of 25,000 species. 
Her namesake 176-cubic-foot orchid terrarium -- in the Victorian Temple of Love style -- can accommodate a mere scintilla, one-one-thousandth of the world's wild orchids, with again as many, maybe .00025 of the 100,000 already properly registered, named hybrids. 

   Not to worry. 
Keith Lloyd, the NYBG's curator of orchids, is in charge of orchid rotation into the Johnson terrarium, a vast bloom-dependent editing job, considering the 5,500 orchids in the garden's collection. 
Mr. Lloyd promises that the rotundal orchidarium will be "filled to aesthetic capacity, but not limited to the largest, the most colorful, or the prettiest. 
The unusual species will have equal place with the showy and large hybrids." 

   To this end the opening exhibition includes a number of wild minis that, due to the problem of orchid larceny, have not heretofore faced the public. (Orchids have long aroused the acquisitive urge. 
Back in the 19th century, as European imperialism expanded through Asia, Africa and the Americas, horticultural imperialism did too. 
Orchid hunters carried out the collective rape of wild orchids by the hundreds of thousands.) 
Bring your opera glasses and you can discern the intricate, quarter-inch orange blooms of a wild lepanthes, a minute epiphyte from the Dominican Republic making its New York debut. 

   "The garden's charter," says Mr. Lloyd, "states that the collections are for scientific research and the entertainment of the people. 
The species satisfy the scientific aspect, the large showy hybrids, the entertainment." 
And so you see the hybrid progression from the flamboyantly entertaining "Cattleyas" Lucie Hauserman and Tango through the souped-up extravagance of "Laeliocattleya" 'Pink Lady' to "Brassolaeliocattleya" Gold Country 'Fine Gold,' a Liberace of an orchid. (One fully expects a "Brassolaeliocattleya" 'Trump's Gold.') 

   From Thekla Johnson's collection comes the endangered Andean species "Odontoglossum warmingii." 
Mr. Wilgermein remembers that Mrs. Johnson was very fond of the odontoglossums, saying "they look like laughing faces." 
Also fond of them were the deadly competitive orchid hunters, who worked like strip miners, in the employ of Queen Victoria's own Royal Orchid Grower, Frederick Sander, and James Veitch's Royal Exotic Nursery. 
During the savage heyday of Victorian orchidomania, Albert Millican blithely recounted in "Travels and Adventures of an Orchid Hunter" (1891) how he armed 30 Colombian "natives" with axes and set them to "cutting down all trees containing valuable orchids {odontoglossums}. 
After about two months' work we had secured about 10,000 plants, cutting down to obtain these some 4,000 trees . . ." 

   Three Southeast Asian orchids from the Johnson collection, two "Paphiopedilum charlesworthii" and one "P. goultenianum," terrestrial slippers with waxy, embalmed-looking flowers, are out of preventive detention, too, thanks to the new terrarium. (Near relatives, the very tenuous and on paper protected "Paphs rothschildianum" and "sanderianum," from Borneo, are the object of continuing, devastating orchid cupidity. 
A couple of years ago one European orchid rustler helicoptered out hundreds of these rarities, smuggled them into Europe and sold them for $1,000 to $2,000 per plant.) 

   The point of the American Orchid Society's campaign "to remove the mystique . . . that the wild orchid is better or more perfect than the man-made one" is made by the wild fairy slipper "Paphiopedilum fairrieanum," potted next to its pixillated man-made progeny "Paphiopedilum" 'Elfin Charm.' 

   Also in the round are softly zaftig phalaenopsis dandling their "keikis," baby plants with roots and leaves, offset on flowering spikes. 
One can take in the "Phalaenopsis lueddemanniana var. 'hieroglyphica,'" with as yet undeciphered Egyptian hieroglyphics on every segment of every flower. 

   With the orchids in the terrarium, plus the thousands of backup plants benched to bloom in the garden's propagation range, there are now likely more orchids in 250 acres of the Bronx than in many once-orchidaceous areas of the same size whence the Bronxites' ancestors came. 
There -- in Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Madagascar, the Brazilian, Peruvian and Ecuadorian Amazon, Guatemala, Costa Rica -- the rain forests are being destroyed at a rate of 50 acres a minute.

   Brazil participated in the Manaus workshop, however, and the
setting of priorities was ``all done with the blessing of Brazil,''
Lovejoy said.
   Tropical rain forests are giant, living warehouses for thousands
of plant and animal species. The Amazon alone is home to 30 percent
of the world's plant and animal species.
   One study found that a single square yard of leaf litter taken
from the deep shadows of the Amazon floor contained 800 ants
representing 50 species.
   Towering forest canopies up to 300 feet above the forest floor
are home to countless birds and insects that live their lives
without ever setting foot on the ground. One group of orchid
species grows only near the top of the canopy; an entirely
different collection of orchids grows at the bottom.
   At the Manaus meeting, more than 100 specialists met in small
groups to assess conservation priorities.
   Insect specialists compared data on such creatures as the
stinging ant that defends acacia trees against predators.
Mammologists took inventory of the Amazon's screeching monkeys.
Ichthyologists considered such oddities as the fish that eats
fallen fruits and nuts on the Amazon River's banks when it
overflows. Botanists, ornithologists and others did the same.
   Then they pooled their information and marked up maps of the
Amazon. When they were done, the areas determined to be worth
saving covered 70 percent to 80 percent of the Amazon.
   ``The bulk of the Amazon is a biological priority; there's no
way of getting around that,'' said Russell Mittermeier, president
of Conservation International and an authority on endangered
monkeys.
   Mittermeier emphasized, however, that the plan set realistic
goals for the establishment of national parks and reserves, along
with multiple-use areas where some development could occur.
   It is not realistic to build a fence around 70 percent to 80
percent of the Amazon, he said. Only the most critical areas should
be placed off limits to development.
   ``Ten to 20 percent of the entire Amazon should be in protected
parks or preserves, ideally,'' he said. At present, 2 percent of
the Amazon is protected.
   Brazil was not alone in its support for the conservation plan.
   ``The results of this meeting are a major contribution towards
the work that has got to be done,'' said Stanley Malone, director
of the Suriname Forest Service.
   Suriname was one of eight Amazon countries that agreed in 1978
to develop a unified approach to management of the Amazon, Malone
said. What the officials lacked, however, was a guide to which
areas most needed protection.
   That determination has now been made, based on the number of
different species a given area contained, and on how many of those
species were endemic, or unique, to the area.
   ``Now we'll have to see what develops from this,'' Mittermeier
said. A new Brazilian president, Fernando Collor de Mello, will be
inaugurated March 15, and with him will come a new Brazilian
environmental policy.
   Whether the policy will include support for the Manaus plan is
uncertain. ``As always, everything depends on key individuals,''
Mittermeier said.
   ``I'm basically always optimistic,'' he said. ``I feel sure that
we can develop appropriate solutions, although it may take a lot of
work.''

FT  16 OCT 93 / Travel Focus - Caribbean &amp; South America: So much forest, so
few people, that's Guyana - Michael J. Woods explores a country of tropical
mystery and spectacular scenery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO PAIRS of bright red rear lamps glowed from the depths of the dense reed
bed bordering Guyana's Kamuni river. They were visible only when I shone the
torch at eye level from beside my head; then, they glinted back without
blinking.
We paddled the boat closer, drifting almost silently on the mirror of black
water. But even as the nosing bows rustled among the stems, the cayman
continued to lie motionless, its yellow-green body submerged and its bulging
eyes protruding from the surface, their redness reflected perfectly in the
water as four vermilion orbs.
We must have counted half-a-dozen of these reptiles in a cruise of less than
a mile, the largest over 4 1/2 ft long and probably as big as they grow in
these parts.
But, even at that size, these fish-eaters pose no threat to humans; and when
we returned to the steps of the landing stage, the camp staff were plunging
about in the river, enjoying a midnight swim.
At Timberhead, Tropical Adventures' jungle retreat, Amerindian-style houses
lie on the boundary between some of Guyana's all-enveloping rain forest and
what is known locally as the savannah, an area of dense, marshy grassland
and scrub which grew up after a disastrous fire burnt down the trees on
either side of the river some decades ago.
The roofs of Timberhead's stilt houses are thatched with fronds from the
troolie palm, and there is no need for windows or doors in an atmosphere
which remains constantly warm even when it pours with rain - which it did,
with disconcerting regularity, when I was there. Not for nothing is Guyana
known as the land of many waters, and a dry T-shirt is a useful accessory.
The inviting hammocks which hang across the living area, and bottles of
deliciously cold Banks beer, are almost more than even the most hyperactive
can resist. But resist I did from time to time so as to swim in the Kamuni
river, the translucent black water of which turns the sky red when viewed
from beneath the surface; to canoe in the early morning in silent search of
the giant otter; and to walk in the rain forest.
Without leeches, and with remarkably few biting insects, the jungle is
comparatively benign. But, like such forests everywhere, most of the action
takes place in the canopy, so we were lucky to spot a troop of bamboo
monkeys as they crashed through the tree-tops after spying us from high
above.
Birds were easier to admire on the bird table adjacent to the dining/kitchen
annexe and, here, a whole range of tanagers came to feast on banana. Even a
neighbouring tarantula had the grace to stay well away from the houses while
it posed obligingly on the light grey background of a palm frond, like a
many-fingered black, furry hand.
At night. the jungle becomes a place of mystery; and our night walk, in
total darkness and linked to one another only by short lengths of dry twig,
led us along a black corridor surrounded by strange cries, buzzes, whoops
and zips.
The Mississippi pontoon boat which had brought us here took us back
downstream to the Demerara river, an opaque, mushroom soup of silt stirred
up by storms far away in the hills. After half an hour pushing upstream, we
landed during another torrential storm and piled into three jeeps for a
two-hour slither through the jungle to Shanklands, a riverside resort.
Here, a number of white colonial houses stud 10 acres of emerald lawns on a
promontory above the Essequibo river, a waterway of enormous proportions and
the third-largest in South America; the biggest of the three islands at its
mouth is bigger than Barbados. Even at Shanklands, 30 miles from the sea,
the river is tidal and almost two miles across. Tramp steamers ply up and
down.
The grassy expanse on the red granite headland has been reclaimed from the
jungle over the past 10 years in a plan executed by Joanne Jardim, whose
father left her several hundred acres of forest. She started by sleeping in
a hammock under a plastic sheet before moving into an old bus.
Now, with elegant houses on the land, she was able to welcome us in style
and ushered us to a lunch table at which every setting was embellished with
a hibiscus flower.
Joanne has left some large trees for shade and, uncluttered by rain forest,
it is possible to appreciate their soaring height. There is forest walking
here, too; water sports on the river; and visits to the local towns and
villages. But, most exciting of all, it is possible to fly from an airstrip
some 20 minutes away to Kaieteur falls.
Throughout the 90-minute flight, the habitat beneath changes rarely, and
then only in small patches. For the most part it is endless, dark green rain
forest, relentless in all directions, spotted by the odd clearing for a gold
or diamond mine and lined very occasionally by a jungle track, the existence
of which is only betrayed by the faintest of traces in the canopy below. It
is easy to appreciate the analogy, quoted often to me during my visit, that
Guyana is the same size as Britain with a population of less than 1m - and
almost all of them living north of Inverness.
Below, as we flew, a gorge cut through the mountains, its bed filled with a
foaming river. And then there was Kaieteur, a clear fall of 741 ft throwing
a great plume of cloud into the air as if the falling water was pouring from
the spout of a boiling kettle.
The aircraft banked steeply and slipped down into the gorge below the falls
before flying up-river and over the very lip of the falls. If it is
possible, the walk to see them is even more spectacular. The path lies over
over sheets of bed-rock and dark, moss-filled crevasses before, finally,
running through a cavernous hollow between enormous boulders to arrive
abruptly on a natural rock terrace placed ideally for viewing.
From here, a steady stream of Guinness apparently plummets downwards to
burst in an endless flume on the rocks far below.
On the flight back to Georgetown, I pondered the apparently endless rain
forest. Logging is in its infancy here; but the temptations to plunder this
valuable resource, in a country where three-quarters of any income
disappears to feed its foreign debt, must be almost overwhelming. Both
Guyana and its forest need visitors from overseas. Better still, both are
worth the visit.

FT  31 OCT 92 / Travel: Tea and cake - then the earthquake struck / Mark
Hodson got more than he bargained for when he visited Banaue, in the
Philippines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK HODSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE bus station in Baguio City, four hard-faced Filipino drivers sat
huddled around a table drinking beer. A sign on the wall said: 'No sleeping
on the tables.' On the radio, Bruce Springsteen was singing Born To Run.
It was 6am. The town of Sagada was eight hours away by bus along the Halsema
Highway, a narrow rock and dust track carved into the sides of the mountains
7,000 feet above sea level.
Our wooden-sided jalopy spewed out black fumes as it crawled up the first
hill. At the top, we watched the sun peer over the mountains and bathe the
rice terraces below with warm morning light. If the scenery wasn't
breathtaking enough, there was always the driving. On downhill stretches our
driver screamed around blind hairpin bends on the wrong side of the road
with his hand on the horn and his foot on the gas.
I had picked up a hint about the standard of driving in the Philippines
when, at the bus station in Manila, I was offered an insurance policy with
my ticket to Baguio. For around 25p I could relax in the knowledge that if I
were killed on the trip my family would receive about Pounds 5,000.
Strangely, it did not make me feel any easier, but as the odds seemed
generous I paid up.
Now we were in the heart of the central cordilleras, two days' hard driving
out of Manila, where rebel ambushes, earthquakes and falling rocks would
have made the idea of insurance ludicrous - and premiums prohibitive.
When we finally made it to Sagada, I found a lazy, one-street town in a
small valley and surrounded by pine forests and lush terraces. But for all
its beauty, this was bandit country - the last frontier between law
enforcement and the rich cannabis fields of the north, controlled by the
communist New People's Army.
I found a room in a guest house for Pounds 1 a night, and a cafe across the
road that sold home-made chocolate cake. In the evening, at one of Sagada's
two bars, I was cornered by a Filipino guide with one tooth who told me a
girl from New Zealand had been involved in a road accident that day.
A bus from Banaue, the next town on my itinerary, had veered off the road
and crashed down the side of a mountain. 'She is in the hospital here,' said
the guide. 'You can go and see her.' I asked if she was badly hurt. 'Oh,
yes,' he replied cheerily. 'She's dead.'
I nodded sagely, wondering how to make my escape when I was saved by the
bell. It was 9.50pm, said the barman; we had 10 minutes to drink up and get
back to our rooms before the curfew came into force. I went without
argument.
I was woken by the sound of pigs squealing beneath my window. I stumbled out
into bright sunshine where a young boy said: 'Good morning, you want to buy
some hash?' A gang of teenagers wearing bandanas, basketball shorts and
flip-flops swaggered up the street with rifles slung over their shoulders. I
asked the boy if they were rebels. He grinned: 'No man, that's the army.'
After breakfast at the Shamrock Cafe, I set off to find Sagada's hanging
coffins, a collection of unusual graveyards said to lie on the outskirts of
town. Along the main street, men in tribal skirts squatted outside thatched
huts sharpening long knives while families sold cakes and Coca-Cola from
their metal-walled houses.
I stopped several times to ask directions but the children just giggled and
the adults waved vaguely at the hills ahead. After an hour of aimless
wandering I was on the point of giving up. Then I looked up and saw them,
clusters of rough wooden coffins lodged in cracks and crevices high in the
sheer rock faces.
I walked further and found other unmarked coffins carved out of tree trunks
and placed in piles at the mouths of caves. These strange tombs were built
by local tribespeople who believed the dead souls would return to the
Earth's core. The custom has been abandoned and some coffins prised open,
possibly for the benefit of tourists, to reveal greying skeletons draped in
tattered cloth.
The trip to Banaue was by jeepney, a brightly-painted minibus converted from
an old American troop carrier. Just two jeepneys a day made the trip, one at
6am and the other at 6.30am.
We stopped three times on the way: once to buy breakfast of pancakes and
coffee, and twice at army checkpoints on mist-covered mountain tops. The
road into Banaue passed some of the most dramatic rice terraces in the
world. Whole hillsides had been carved into horizontal slices.
It has taken the people of the Ifugao tribe 2,000 years to build these
terraces, step by step from the ground up, using bare hands and primitive
tools. Engineers have come from around the world to study the sophisticated
irrigation system and marvel at the 12,000 miles of mud walls.
I spent two days in Banaue exploring the terraces, walking for hours in the
clear mountain air, losing my way and finding it again. On the afternoon of
the second day I went to a cafe in town. I was sitting with a cup of tea and
slice of cake, nursing my blistered feet, when the earthquake struck.
First, my cup started shaking on the table. I looked down and saw the table
shaking; then I looked up to see that the whole building was shaking. I ran
into the road to find the population of the town there already, looking very
worried.
The quake lasted about 15 seconds, maybe less. It seemed longer. There was
no structural damage, just a few vegetable stalls upset, pictures knocked
off walls. It had measured 5 on the Richter scale. At the epicentre, in
Baguio City, it reached 5.7 and left 25 people injured. I was told it was
the worst earthquake since one three years earlier which had measured 7.7
and killed 1,600 people across the region.
Two hours later the rains came, torrents of water battering the houses and
flooding the streets with mud. As the storm raged into the night, I cowered
in a cafe drinking beer with an English teacher from Hackney. Every now and
then a loud rumble would echo through the valley and we would freeze in
terror, tensed for another earthquake, then burst into wild laughter when we
realised it was only thunder.
Next day, life had returned to normal. The air had cleared, the ground was
drying out, people were laughing. I squeezed into a bus packed with farmers,
sacks of rice and live chickens and took a bumpy 10-mile ride higher into
the hills. The driver pulled up at a steep footpath beside the road and
pointed me towards Batad, my next stop.
It was a two-hour walk to the top of the hill. Below, a patchwork of
terraces stretched over the valley floor and up the sides of the surrounding
mountains like a huge green amphitheatre. In the middle lay Batad - two
dozen Ifugao huts and one concrete house dotted around a tiny church with a
rusted tin roof.
Two small boys in torn shirts led me down the hill, along the tops of dry
stone walls and through dusty back yards. We arrived at the concrete hut
where a woman called Christina showed me to my room. It was 20 pesos a night
and there were no other guests.
Rice is everything there. I slept with rice fields all around and in the
mornings I was woken by the sound of rice being pounded in mortars carved
from tree stumps. I spent my days on Christina's terrace watching children
wash clothes on the rocks while women prepared meals and their husbands
crouched around bottles of tupuy, a throat-searing rice wine.
In the evenings, the palm trees filled with fireflies. After dinner,
Christina's 10-year-old daughter and her friend would sing tribal songs and
dance in the glow of a kerosene lamp.
Spanish missionaries converted the Ifugao to Catholicism and on Sundays the
families went to church and sang haunting hymns that could be heard across
the valley. But these people still practise head-hunting. Although their
ancient disputes with neighbouring villages have long been resolved,
decapitation is still considered a legitimate way of righting a wrong. In
1977, a bus driver who ran over and killed a child was seized and summarily
executed.
Head-hunting is not the only tradition that has survived in Batad. The
villagers still worship Bulul, a rice god, and nail the skulls of
slaughtered pigs to the walls of their huts to ward off evil spirits. There
were some parts of the soul that not even the conquistadors could reach.

ALONE WITH NATURE IN A TROPICAL RAIN FOREST

MARENCO, Costa Rica 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are no roads to Marenco. 
</P>
<P>
Remote, tropical, blessed with unspoiled beaches, towering rain forest and only 
a few flying insects that bite, Marenco Biological Station is a privately owned 
nature reserve along Costa Rica's southern Pacific Ocean coast. 
</P>
<P>
My first view of the station was from a five-passenger, single-engine plane. A 
cluster of red metal roofs beckoned from the forest that surrounded them. 
</P>
<P>
During the trip by launch 10 minutes down the coast from a grass airstrip, we 
passed narrow bands of deserted beaches -- palms and forest encroaching onto 
dark sand. By dinghy, we maneuvered among lava rocks to shore. 
</P>
<P>
Less than two hours after leaving the traffic and sounds of Costa Rica's 
capital, San Jose, I was setting off down a trail that winds silently through 
mile after mile of rain forest giants. 
</P>
<P>
For the next two days I tramped along with four other nature lovers behind 
resident Lou Jost. 
</P>
<P>
The hip-high, red-clay stain on Jost's white pants was a tip-off to trail 
conditions after days of rain. Soon those of us who had gingerly stepped from 
the dinghy, protective of dry shoes, were wading across rivers and slipping 
through mud like veterans. 
</P>
<P>
A green kingfisher, a red-capped manikin, woodcreepers and butterflies welcomed 
us. Although I was a neophyte at bird watching, I saw an exotic, slaty-tailed 
trogon. Mysterious sounds from unseen creatures punctuated the stillness. 
</P>
<P>
Later, a bird book in the Marenco station's small library added color and shape 
to some of the sounds Jost had identified for us. We peered at pages showing 
the Amazon parrot and pale-billed woodpecker. 
</P>
<P>
Our small group neither saw nor heard tapirs, crocodiles, anteaters or sloths, 
but we were treading their turf. 
</P>
<P>
Returning at sunset on trails behind the station grounds, loud, hoarse barks 
pulled us back in search of howler monkeys. In the dim light of a darkening 
forest, we finally saw a troop high in the trees. 
</P>
<P>
Private reserves such as Marenco, along with Costa Rica's internationally 
recognized park system, help conserve the biological diversity of the tropics 
in this corner of Central America. 
</P>
<P>
Though Sergio Miranda, director of the biological station, suggests that 
Marenco is not for the luxury traveler, accommodations are far from primitive. 
</P>
<P>
Lodges on a hill 180 feet above the ocean house two people per room, with 
private baths. Each room has its own terrace looking out at a sweep of 
machete-cut lawn, over the forest and down to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Floors of gleaming tropical hardwood prompted me to leave muddy shoes outside. 
A split-tailed "Jesus Christ" lizard, so called because of its ability to walk 
on water, has taken up residence near the lodges. 
</P>
<P>
The isolation in the midst of tropical rain forest that doomed the fruit farm 
was the key to Marenco as a center for nature-adventure travel. 
</P>
<P>
Three years after Miranda came to Marenco, Costa Rica set aside 87,500 acres 
south and east of it as Corcovado National Park. Corcovado now encompasses more 
than 105,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
"Creation of the national park in 1975 began to change the whole future," 
Miranda said. "The biggest problem then, as now, was how to get into the area. 
I used a dugout to travel out of Sierpe when I was building Marenco." As word 
spread among researchers that Miranda was coming and going in the area, they 
started to contact him to get them to Corcovado. 
</P>
<P>
He not only brought them in, but soon was housing the scientists and then 
university student groups. One day a tour agency called to inquire if a group 
of bird watchers could use his boats. "I didn't know anything about 
natural-history travelers," Miranda said, but he researched the 
nature-adventure travel market and in 1985 went into business. 
</P>
<P>
A stay at the station offers a day with a Marenco guide in Corcovado Park. 
After a 6:30 a.m. family-style breakfast in the dining hall -- eggs, black 
beans and rice (gallo pinto), toast, fruit, juice and coffee or tea -- I set 
out with Jost and four other travelers to see the national park. 
</P>
<P>
A gentle rain was all that remained of a roaring nighttime downpour as we 
transferred from dinghy to launch for a 20-minute ride to San Pedrillo, a 
ranger station marking the northern park boundary. After hiking along the 
beach, we climbed into the forest. 
</P>
<P>
We saw red spider monkeys leaping from tree to tree in search of fruit, one 
toting a baby on its back. My bird list mushroomed -- I saw kiskadees, a 
golden-hooded tanager and anis (of the cuckoo family), and caught a glimpse of 
the huge, turkey-like curassow through thick foliage. 
</P>
<P>
We caught scent of white-lipped peccaries, a sort of wild hog. "If they 
appear," advised Jost, "stand still and hope they don't charge." In case of 
attack, he suggested we climb at least three feet up in a nearby tree. 
Peccaries roam in herds of up to about 50. 
</P>
<P>
The secret to knowing where army ants are on the move? The chirr of antbirds 
that prey on insects fleeing a swarm. Miniature roads in forest litter tell of 
leaf-cutting ants that carry bits of bright green leaves for the fungus gardens 
in their nests. 
</P>
<P>
We touched the white latex of the baco, or milk tree. Indigenous peoples drank 
its "milk," ate its sweet fruit and beat its reddish gray bark to use as 
blankets or clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Fallen flowers on the forest floor hint of riches hidden in the canopy above. 
"That's why I decided to go into the canopy," Jost said. He discovered an arrow 
lost on a previous attempt to climb one of the forest giants; using a 
crossbow,, he shot climbing lines that helped him get to an area of the rain 
forest that has been largely inaccessible to researchers. 
</P>
<P>
Red, yellow, brown and green seed pods -- works of art and engineering -- also 
litter the forest floor. One looks like a child's top. It hangs with the point 
up, and a bottom plug pops out to release seeds into the air. 
</P>
<P>
Printed guides to trails on Marenco's 1,500 acres allow visitors to encounter 
the tropical forest alone, an adventure worth taking. 
</P>
<P>
Walking through the thick carpet of leaves, Jost would suddenly squat to 
briefly detain a brightly colored frog no bigger than his thumbnail. He noticed 
a toucan -- against the sky on a dead tree -- that I could barely see with 
binoculars. 
</P>
<P>
As my eyes adjusted, I, too, made discoveries: A small salamander so delicate 
and tiny, like a toothpick with legs, camouflaged brown against a brown leaf; a 
toucan, unseen, but identified by his song; a baco or ajo recognized. 
</P>
<P>
Jost spun tales of interrelationships in the forest. My favorite was his 
description of the "arms race" between the passion flower and the Heliconius 
butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
The passion flower has Velcro-like leaves with little hooked hairs to catch 
marauding butterfly larvae. The plant also produces egg-mimics on its leaves to 
fool butterflies into thinking that eggs already have been laid there. 
</P>
<P>
Butterflies, for their part, have learned to detoxify the poisonous chemicals 
in the plant or to use them to make themselves toxic to their predators. 
</P>
<P>
Though he refers to these forests as "benign" because of the few bothersome 
insects and snakes that mostly keep to themselves, Jost recalls one woman who 
sat on a log without looking and found herself on the tail of a fearsome 
fer-de-lance, the most dangerous snake in Central America. As Jost yanked her 
up, the surprised snake slithered away. 
</P>
<P>
We ate sack lunches beside the roaring waterfall at Llorona. Although it was a 
cool day from the rain and cloud cover, I stepped in to feel the pounding 
torrent. On a dry, hot day, tired hikers, no doubt, rush to the cooling water. 
</P>
<P>
For those not up to the rigors of an all-day trek through the forest, there are 
miles of uninhabited coastline to explore and there's swimming in rivers or 
ocean, snorkeling and horseback riding. 
</P>
<P>
One need only carry binoculars to the hammock on the terrace to get a view of 
parrots, toucans and maybe a scarlet macaw as they fly through the clearing. 
</P>
<P>
Others saw two humpback whales from the terrace while we were away at 
Corcovado. Residents say that whales announce summer, the dry season that 
begins in December. At night sparkling fireflies can be seen from the same 
vantage point. 
</P>
<P>
One night we descended the long hill to the beach to look in tide pools with 
our flashlights. (Flashlights are essential -- the generator for electricity 
sometimes is turned off as early as 8:30 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
Marine life is abundant, especially around Isla del Cano, a national biological 
reserve about an hour away by boat. 
</P>
<P>
Legend says pirates' treasure is hidden on the island, and Indian graves and 
stone spheres suggest an ancient cemetery. Earlier Indian habitation is also 
evident on the mainland -- while we waited at the airstrip, workers digging a 
drainage ditch unearthed pottery shards. 
</P>

Temperature and humidity on departure day, for instance, made it necessary to 
ferry the five of us out in two trips to Palmar Norte, where we rejoined for

Charter flights to the Marenco Biological Station leave San Jose on Mondays and 
Fridays on a 47-minute trip. Cost for three nights at the station is $515, 
including round-trip transfers from hotel to airport, plus flight, lodging, 
meals, guided trip to Corcovado and Rio Claro, and taxes. A four-night package 
adds a tour of Cano Island; cost is $631.

   A 70-foot dinosaur known as ``Happy'' stood
prominently on display at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History
for nearly 25 years before researchers discovered it was a new
species.
   Four months before it announced that finding in July, the museum
said it had discovered a new dinosaur, Nanotyrannus _ based on a
skull that had been in the basement for decades.
   This spring, a California researcher found the fossil remains of
a marine reptile called a Masasaur, so well-preserved that the 75
million-year-old animal still had scales on its skin and food in
its stomach. It was in a Natural History Museum of Los Angeles
County warehouse.
   Paleontologists say the finds aren't surprising. Museum
storerooms have become rich hunting grounds for new species because
a lack of money and staff has delayed the identification of bones
excavated up to 60 years ago.
   ``In general, paleontologists can collect stuff faster than it
can be prepared,'' said Michael E. Williams, who helped identify
``Happy,'' a 140-million-year-old relative of the Brontosaurus.
``There are museums ... which have skeletons still in plaster
jackets going back to the turn of the century.''
   Researchers at the Cleveland museum had determined that
``Happy'' was a Haplocanthosaurus, but didn't realize it
represented a new and larger species _ and named it ``delfsi''
after the researcher who found the bones 30 years ago _ until they
recently had time to study it more closely.
   ``Literally there is so much material to collect and save from
weathering and erosion that we are just decades behind,'' said
Lawrence G. Barnes, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the
Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. ``I could walk in to
the Smithsonian or any museum and find 80 or 90 new species of
whales or dolphins, which is my specialty.''
   Barnes estimated that the museum had 300 to 400 plaster jackets
in storage, encasing everything from dinosaurs to mammoths, and
that 75 percent of the museum's collection has not been examined
closely.
   Even at the well-funded Smithsonian Institution, it took half a
century to study and identify fossils excavated by 19th century
dinosaur researcher O.C. Marsh that form the bulk of the museum's
collection, according to research curator Nicholas Hotton.
   ``When Marsh died, we got seven big, big train carloads of
dinosaur bones,'' Hotton said. Researcher C.W. Gilmor worked on
Marsh's fossils for nearly 50 years, and ``there is a bunch of
stuff Gilmor didn't get to.''
   Fossils stored at the Smithsonian have almost all been
identified, he said. ``We don't anticipate any surprises, but
that's silly because we can always get surprised.''
   Field Museum of Natural History researchers in Chicago have
spent 10 years working through the collection of unstudied fossils,
some of them in storage for decades, said John Bolt, chairman of
the geology department.
   ``We've made quite a bit of progress at reducing that backlog,''
Bolt said.
   Mary Dawson, curator of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History
in Pittsburgh, said some of the fossils still stored in plaster
jackets at the museum date to 1922. With only five paleontologists
on the staff, many of those blocks will have to remain in storage.
   Four years ago, a National Science Foundation grant let Carnegie
researchers open an old plaster block. They found the only known
complete hind foot of a stegosaurus.
   ``We liken our collection to an iceberg, with one-tenth above
the surface and the rest waiting for study,'' Miss Dawson said.
   Most of the work done at the museum is based on specimens the
researchers collect themselves, so much of the collection in
storage will remain unstudied, she said. ``We know we should stay
home and study the collections we already have, but it's such a
challenge to get out in the field.
   ``We're really putting apples back on the tree when we do this.''

FT  06 MAR 93 / Travel: The river roads of the rainforest - Boats are best
when exploring parts of Malaysia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ANCIENT outboard motor revved loudly, thrashing at the surface of the
turbulent water so that the long boat quickly lost way against the immutable
force of the current. With great calm the steersman brought the stern almost
against the steep bank where the water was dark and deep and the vegetation
hung over the channel.
Ducking to avoid thick leaves and branches, he dipped the propeller into the
river and turned on the power. Once more we surged forward over a shoal of
stones and into the deeper pool above. Another obstacle had been overcome
and we powered up the River Tembeling through the soaring trees of the
Malaysian rainforest.
The Tembeling is the main route into Malaysia's largest national park, Taman
Nagara, which means, simply, national park. Covering an area of 4,343 square
kilometres of virgin rainforest 130m years old, the park is largely
inaccessible except via rivers. The journey upstream from Kuala Tembeling to
the park headquarters and the new Taman Nagara Resort at Kuala Tahan takes
about three hours depending on the water level.
The long boats thrust powerfully upstream past small riverside settlements
perched on the bank-tops high above the normal river level, for in the
monsoon the river can rise by more than 70 metres, as the line on the wall
at the park headquarters testifies.
I saw a graphic illustration of this rise and fall along one of the
Tembeling's tributaries leading deep into the park. Jammed high above in the
branches of a tree was a trunk probably 10m long and 1m across.
Taman Nagara Resort is incongruous in the remote and wild context of virgin
rainforest. Its rooms, in individual and traditional Malay buildings, are
comfortable, but the city hotel-style restaurant, 24-hour reception and
banqueting hall are incompatible with a jungle setting.
I ate, instead, in the fairy-lit cafes set up on the river beach opposite,
whistling for a boat to carry me across the black swirling waters and
stumbling up the stony beach in the dark. One night I joined a group of
forest guides and national park staff for a celebratory meal, clumsily
balling rice with delicious pieces of river fish and spicy chicken direct
from hand to mouth.
From the park headquarters a variety of trails led into the forest. Some are
short with numbered points of interest, others are longer and take you to
viewpoints or mineral licks. One of them is the route to the highest
mountain on peninsular Malaysia, a seven-day trek. I chose a short route as
a taster and plunged into the trees along a damp, narrow path.
The noise took me completely by surprise - a loud, endlessly repetitive
backing of hums, buzzes, whines, drones and purrs enlivened, now and then,
by rising and falling bells and whoops. It went on constantly, night and
day, a cacophony of insects, frogs, occasional birds and even gibbons.
Somehow this barrage of sound, together with the occasional leech looping
rapidly across the leaves of the forest floor at the slightest sniff of a
meal, produced an atmosphere of malevolence.
The problem with the rainforest is that the action is many floors up in the
penthouse while you are stuck in the dank basement. It is only along the
corridors cut by the rivers and in clearings such as those carved out for
villages and the park headquarters that wildlife becomes apparent.
Early one morning I fruitlessly searched the grounds of the new resort for
some of the 20 bird species which the leaflet told me could commonly be seen
there. I spotted just two, although one was the glorious southern pied
hornbill, its beak adorned with a huge creamy casque. There were also
long-tailed macaque monkeys, raiding the builders' houses for food, and
several species of squirrel.
I spent one night in a hide overlooking a mineral lick. Here half-a-dozen of
us kept vigil armed with powerful torches to flick on at the slightest sound
of a visitor. We were alerted by a noise like munching cornflakes, and there
in the spotlight was a bi-coloured animal, black at front and back with a
broad white belt around its middle, a tapir.
Its early arrival promised well for the rest of the night but it was a
promise not to be fulfilled. Although the tapir came and went several times,
nothing else turned up.
An alternative is to visit the animals themselves, so the next day we
crawled through a grubby cave in search of bats. There were two species, a
large fruit-eating bat and a much smaller insectivorous horseshoe bat. Both
were hanging in great numbers from the grey ceiling and festooning the rocky
walls.
This was no place for the phobic. Along with the bats, a large toad sat
darkly in the stream below while a white cave racer with a brilliant red
tongue, a bat-eating snake, slid silently around the walls, insinuating its
body into cracks and slithering from crevice to crevice.
The Malaysian jungle is home to one of the three species of great ape, the
orang-utan, though I had to fly to the orang-utan rehabilitation centre at
Sepilok, in the state of Sabah, to see these. Here young orangs, orphaned as
infants or taken from the wild as pets, are re-introduced to life in the
rainforest. A number of learning stages sees them wise enough to live freely
in the forest, returning to a feeding area for supplementary rations of
bananas and milk, a diet which is supposed to encourage them to forage for
more interesting food out of sheer boredom. Even when there are no primates
to be seen, Sepilok offers an ideal opportunity to appreciate the beauty and
majesty of the rainforest.

Conditions are nearly ideal as John Fales heads briskly out the front door with 
his butterfly net and a worn green canvas bag slung over his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
It's 75 degrees on a mostly sunny afternoon in the early fall. A gentle breeze 
ripples the waters of Chesapeake Bay, a short walk from Fales' home at Plum 
Point in Calvert County, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Fales records the temperature from a gauge atop a pole in his yard and writes 
down the time. Ready now, he scans the shrubs in his yard and the sky overhead. 
He is quickly rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
"There goes one," he says, glimpsing a monarch butterfly as it flutters 
overhead, too high to catch. 
</P>
<P>
The monarch is flying due south, following an ancient migratory path to its 
winter home in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
No other insect migrates as the monarch does. Each fall, millions east of the 
Rockies from Texas to Canada fly south, to return in the spring. Those in the 
West winter near the coast in Southern California and Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
Despite decades of study, scientists cannot fully explain the phenomenon. Do 
they navigate by the sun or take their cue from the Earth's magnetic field? No 
one knows. The mystery enhances the allure of one of the most beautiful and 
popular of butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
The migration is easily observed in early fall. The butterfly's distinctive 
wings of burnt orange, black and white as well as its larger-than-average size 
make it stand out. You can spot monarchs as they stop to feed in gardens, along 
the beach or at the sides of highways. Or just look up. 
</P>
<P>
"Between Labor Day and the middle of October, on any really sunny day I could 
go out in the mall and see them flying overhead," says Robert K. Robbins, 
research entomologist at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
There might be one monarch or many. Philip Kean, a member of the Maryland 
Entomological Society, once saw thousands clustered in a field of tick weed 
sunflowers near in Anne Arundel County, "tanking up for the trip home." 
</P>
<P>
Scientists assume that the monarch has been making this annual journey for 
thousands of years; whether they can continue it will depend on actions of its 
worst enemy: people. The butterfly's winter homes are under assault. In Mexico, 
poor people living next to the forests of coyumel firs where the monarchs stay 
have cut into them for timber and to clear land for crops. In California, 
developers' projects have destroyed the insects' habitat. 
</P>
<P>
A number of private organizations and the government of Mexico, however, have 
taken action in the '80s to prevent irreversible damage. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico's efforts in particular are noteworthy. In an impoverished country where 
environment often takes a back seat to economy, the national government has 
established monarch refuges. The refuges, or reservas, are a two-hour drive 
southwest of Mexico City in an area of about 1,500 square miles. Despite the 
official designation, however illegal encroachment has occurred. 
Preservationists believe that the monarch's security depends on developing 
economic alternatives for the resentful residents nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very, very poor people," said Alfredo Arellano, a biologist with the 
Monarch Civil Assn., a private group in Mexico City. "They want work." 
</P>
<P>
Even limited logging can hurt the monarch, however. Thinning of the forest 
results in higher temperatures in the day and lower ones at night, upsetting an 
environment that would otherwise be a perfect spot for the mariposa monarch to 
spend the winter. 
</P>
<P>
Biologists say that if the temperature rises too much, the monarchs become too 
active, burning energy they need to survive and to make the return flight 
north. If it becomes too cold, the monarchs die. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the Xerces Society and National Wildlife Federation are 
among the organizations supporting efforts to preserve the monarch. A number of 
scientists are trying to unravel its secrets, with the assistance of volunteers 
such as Fales who pass on their observations and tag butterflies so that they 
can be tracked. 
</P>
<P>
Fales has been collecting butterflies of all kinds since 1942. He was an 
entomologist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture research facility in 
Beltsville, Md., until 1972, when he retired and moved with his wife to their 
small house overlooking the bay. 
</P>
<P>
Fales, who is fit and nimble at age 76, snares the butterflies with a quick 
snap of his net and tags them with the dexterity of a surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
He spots what looks like a monarch perched in a patch of wildflowers. It turns 
out to be a viceroy, a look-alike that often fools an untrained eye. The 
viceroy also fools birds, which generally avoid monarchs because the chemicals 
derived from the butterflies' ingestion of milkweed, their favorite food, make 
them a poisonous meal. 
</P>
<P>
Fales soon nets the real thing. Kneeling, he opens the bag to extracts his 
tools: a peanut jar containing ethyl acetate, which he uses to kill butterflies 
he intends to collect, and a small box. 
</P>
<P>
Fales removes the struggling butterfly from the net and lays it on the yellow 
jar top, his thick fingers holding it gently in place. He takes a marker and, 
with the pointed end, delicately scrapes off a small patch of scales on both 
sides of the top right wing, being careful not to poke through the wing 
membrane. Then he picks up a folded gummed tag a bit larger than a thumbtack 
and places it on the cleared area of the wing, pressing gently. 
</P>
<P>
The white tag has a number, 1099, and the address of the Natural History Museum 
in Los Angeles, where monarch research data is collected. So far, none of the 
butterflies Fales has tagged during the past four years has turned up. 
</P>
<P>
Fales then tosses the tagged monarch into the air. It obstinately heads 
northward, ignoring Fales' prediction that it would go the other way. He seems 
mildly surprised, but the other butterflies he tags this afternoon do fly 
south. 
</P>
<P>
The typical generation of monarch does not live more than a month, Fales says, 
but the migrating generation can live long enough to survive the winter and a 
trip of perhaps 2,500 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the mystery is that no one is sure how far north a monarch makes it 
back in the spring. Fales has caught tired specimens whose colors have faded 
and wings have become ragged, suggesting that their trips had started far to 
the south. Scientists are certain, however, that the butterflies mate along the 
journey north, producing new generations that join the migration. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been monitoring the monarchs for many years," Fales says. "In the last 
couple of years, it's been in short supply. We're trying to figure out what's 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 and 1988, Fales said, there was not a "massive fall migration" -- 
during one of those, you can spot 100 in a 10-minute period. The numbers have 
so far been small this year, he said, although higher than they were for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In Mexico, preservationists have discovered four new wintering sites, all in 
the same region, according to a report last summer by Fred Urquhart. Urquhart 
is the Canadian scientist who deserves much of the credit for discovering the 
monarch's winter homes. 
</P>
<P>
For many years, scientists suspected that monarchs migrated to Mexico, but they 
did not know where. Finally, in 1975, an American named Kenneth Brugger, using 
information from Urquhart, found a colony of monarchs. Local residents, of 
course, had known all along about the butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
In the 14 years since, the butterflies have acquired many friends, the 
Entomological Society of America among them. The society is one of more than 11 
groups seeking to make the butterfly the national insect. 
</P>
<P>
Mexicans are also fond of their colorful visitors, and one refuge is open to 
the public to accommodate the increasing number of people who want to see an 
unusual sight. 
</P>
<P>
On a chilly morning last January, for instance, tens of thousands of monarchs 
-- too many to estimate -- were clumped like leaves in the branches of tall fir 
trees in a forest in the state ofMichoacan more than 7,000 feet above sea 
level. As the sun climbed higher into the sky, warming the air, the butterflies 
begin to stir. Thousands begin to fly between the trees and to light on bushes. 
A few settled on the awe-struck people who had trekked up a steep unpaved path 
to the refuge. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a glorious silent dance," whispered Connecticut artist Lois Read as she 
painted the scene in watercolors.

<HEAD>House Passes Indian Museum Bill; Senate Expected to Concur</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved a bill Monday to transfer a
priceless collection of Indian artifacts from New York's Museum of
the American Indian to the Smithsonian Institution for display in
museums in Washington and New York.
   The measure may at long last make peace among politicians,
native Americans and archaeologists, first by resolving a
10-year-old dispute in New York over how to display and preserve
the Heye Foundation collection of more than a million Indian
artifacts.
   Second, it stipulates that the Smithsonian Institution, where
possible, return its collection of some 18,000 Indian remains to
their original tribes for burial.
   The question of the remains had been the last obstacle to
crafting a passable bill, and compromise came in September, when
Smithsonian Secretary Robert McCormick Adams reversed the museum's
long-held policy that the bones were necessary for study. Indians
nationwide, seeking to bury their ancestors, heralded his decision
as a watershed that will influence other museums.
   The House passed the measure on a voice vote. A similar bill
passed the Senate on Oct. 3., but because of slight differences in
the two bills' language, Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, planned
to ask the Senate to approve the House version Tuesday, said Inouye
spokeswoman Pat Zell.
   ``Sen. Inouye has asked for the consent of the Senate to bring
up the bill as amended and have the Senate approve that bill and
send it directly to the White House,'' Zell said Monday.
   Suzan Shown Harjo, a trustee of the Museum of the American
Indian, was confident that the Senate would go along with the plan.
   The bill passed Monday would establish a Museum of the American
Indian in the last available space on the Washington Mall, between
the National Air and Space Museum and the Capitol. There the
Smithsonian would erect an 82,500 square foot building financed
two-thirds with private donations and one-third with public money.
   The bill further states that a satellite museum, the George
Gustav Heye Center of the National Museum of the American Indian,
would be established in the old U.S. Custom House in lower
Manhattan. Both New York state and New York City have pledged to
contribute up to $8 million apiece toward converting the building
for that use. The federal government would chip in another $8
million under the bill.

FT  20 APR 91 / Travel: Purely a cosmetic operation at Copacabana - Tim Burt
at Igazu where the Brazil-Argentina border rumbles and cascades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BORDER between Brazil and Argentina rumbles. The ground shakes and a
cloud of spray rises above the jungle.
The frontier itself moves. It carves a wide path through the olive-green
landscape and carries branches and boulders along with it. Suddenly, it
gathers pace and rushes over a great precipice where rainbows shine through
the haze.
These are the symptoms of Iguazu - the waterfalls separating South America's
largest countries. Border traffic is impossible. There is no way to cross
the mass of water that tumbles over a gorge four times wider than Niagara.
The Rio Iguazu rushes down a series of cliffs which for centuries marked the
physical limit of European exploration. Attempts to colonise the river's
upper reaches were defeated by white water cascading through the forest at a
rate of 1,750 cubic metres a second.
Tourism has changed all that. The 275 steps, crevices and hollows that make
up Las Cataratas have become an important attraction for a region long
considered too remote to merit development.
You no longer need a pack mule to get there or a machete to hack through the
undergrowth. But if you are seeking Paradise Lost prepare to be
disappointed. The 20th century has arrived - mostly by air. Thousands of
people fly each year to Iguazu, where they stay in pricey hotels and amble
along purpose-built walkways beside the falls.
Airline pilots obviously think first impressions count: they offer their
passengers a grandstand view of the site before landing. Skimming over the
tree tops, some aircraft bank so low that tourists on the ground duck
instinctively.
Three airports have now been built to cater for the influx of visitors.
Varig, the Brazilian carrier, flies to one; Aerolneas Argentinas serves
another and LAP of Paraguay lands at Ciudad Stroessner, the nearby town
named after that country's retired dictator.
Most visitors fly from Rio de Janeiro, 730 miles to the north-east, or from
Buenos Aires, more than 600 miles to the south. The flights are managed with
dexterity by Iguazu's air traffic controllers whose radar screens monitor
not only incoming traffic but also the constant hubbub of helicopters
buzzing into the air with pleasure trippers.
But the congested skies cannot detract from the spectacle of strings of tiny
birds flitting through the spray. Tourists who take the walkway to the
Devil's Throat, the largest single-drop waterfall, linger on the viewing
platform to watch swallows struggling to reach their nests through the
curtains of water.
The birds live off rich pickings on the forest floor. The Iguazu national
park serves up bloated caterpillars and spiders the size of your fist. The
caterpillars blossom into giant butterflies as bright as Chinese kites. Some
are luminous yellow and green; others sport air force roundels. They gather
in clouds to drink from the lagoon at the foot of Dos Hermanos, the name
given to a pair of smaller falls.
Swimmers who brave the lagoon can dry off with a brisk walk towards Isla San
Martin, an island at the foot of some of the largest falls. The outcrop
rises 100ft out of the water and is served by an old wooden boat that bumps
across the fast-running current. Some visitors go no further than the shore;
the fittest climb the step-ladder to the summit.
The island, reached from the Argentine riverbank, offers unobstructed views
of the monkeys and toucans playing on the Brazilian side. San Martin itself
hums with life. Every few feet a beetle crunches underfoot. The ugly insects
appear at the bottom of a food chain which includes turkey eagles, coral
snakes, toads, ant-eaters - even jaguars.
Homo sapiens, as usual, sits astride the top of the chain. At Iguazu he is
served by snack bars which pose a threat to the other animals by dispensing
canned drink and burgers in polystyrene packs. The fast-food wrappings
rarely find their way into the rubbish bins painted green by the park
authorities. Old tin cans are left to rust on the ground and the ant-eaters
have learned to pick their way round discarded paper cups.
There are, however, pockets of uncluttered jungle. The pathways to them are
too steep and overgrown for the blue-rinse-and-sneaker brigade. Tour guides
marshal elderly visitors along the widest walkways before returning them
safely to their air-conditioned buses. Other paths are left to adventurers
who do not mind scratching and stumbling through the foliage.
By late afternoon the restaurants are laying their tables; in Puerto Iguazu,
the Argentine town 10 miles away; hotel boilers are working overtime to
shower their hot and bothered guests; and the jungle is just coming to life.
Timid animals make use of the empty walkways as darkness falls in the
rainforest. By this time the last airliner has taken off and the helicopter
pilots are sitting down to eat. The falls, meanwhile, are in full flow. The
humidity increases and the vegetation seems to perspire. It gets very dark.
All travellers hate getting lost, even intrepid ones. Losing your way in the
dark at Iguazu has only one consolation: it is a good way to lose weight -
you shed pounds in sweat. You also lose your nerve.
The tourist maps are unreliable and difficult to read by torchlight. And
missing the last bus back to town can be costly. Either you have to camp out
with the wildlife or crank up your credit card to use the International
Hotel half a mile from the falls.
It takes a cool head to pick the right track when the only reference point
is the deep splash of a nearby waterfall. The prospect of slipping and
sliding over a precipice concentrates the mind wonderfully.
British Airways (London: 081-897-4000) and Varig (071-629-9408) fly to Rio
de Janeiro, with connections to Foz do Iguazu, the Brazilian airport. BA
also flies to Buenos Aires, with similar connections to Puerto Iguazu in
Argentina. Tour operators such as Journey Latin America (081-747 3108)
arrange inclusive tours to the region.

   Is Lord Elgin on the verge of losing his marbles after all?
   Nearly two centuries ago, Thomas Bruce, the seventh Earl of
Elgin, sacrificed his reputation, his marriage, his family fortune,
his seat in the House of Lords and the nether end of his nose to
bring back from the Acropolis the magnificent marble statues,
columns and friezes on display in the British Museum. Almost ever
since, successive Greek governments have demanded return of the
marbles.
   Now a soul-searching breeze, or at least a strong gust of
conscience, is parting the curtains of the clandestine world of
museum curators and antiquities collectors wide enough for some
cherished artifacts and revered bones to emerge, like the risen
dead, from showcases and storage vaults and return to their lands of
origin.
   The plot may seem like a late-night rerun of an old Boris Karloff
tomb-and-mummy chiller, but the script actually echoes ethics codes
and operating standards adopted in recent years by associations of
museum directors and curators to discourage the booming
billion-dollar traffic in stolen art.
   More and more countries, especially in the Third World, are
adopting laws to protect their cultural patrimony and are going to
court to retrieve millennia-old heirlooms scattered far and wide
among museums, art dealers and private collectors.
   A few weeks ago, Stanford University agreed to give back for
reburial the skeletal remains of 550 Ohlone Indians, some of them
3,000 years old.
   In January, Boston's Museum of Fine Arts returned to Egypt
fragments of nine mud plaster paintings, dating to the reign of
Thutmose III in l500 B.C. The museum bought them from an Amsterdam
dealer in 1978, but recently discovered they were stolen from a
necropolis in Thebes by ``tymborychoi'' _ tomb robbers whose
activities date back to the time of the pharaohs.
   Turkey, which in the last two decades has been plundered of more
of its ancient treasures than at any time since the fall of
Constantinople in 1204, is pursuing a court case against New York's
Metropolitan Museum of Art to get back sixth-century B.C. gold and
silver pieces illicitly excavated. The New York branch of
Christie's, the art auctioneers, voluntarily handed back a drawing
identified by one of its experts as a Rembrandt stolen l0 years ago
from an Amsterdam museum.
   In February, an FBI sting in Miami nabbed a former Buenos Aires
police commissioner trying to peddle a Goya portrait missing from
the museum in Rosario, Argentina.
   Several years ago, in a suit brought by U.S. Customs under the
National Stolen Properties Act, New York art dealer David Bernstein
was ordered to return to Peru 745 pre-Columbian pieces, valued at
more than $1 million. He avoided a prison sentence by doing public
service, cataloging museum artifacts.
   ``U.S. dealers import as many as 40,000 items a year from Peru
alone,'' estimated National Geographic, ``many of them literally
strip-mined from archaeological sites with bulldozers and
backhoes.'' Plundered Peruvian art is advertised in slick mail-order
catalogs.
   Hopi Indians are demanding the return of Kachina dolls from
museums as far away as West Germany, where Indian art is in vogue.
In tribal belief, the dolls are ``trapped friends unable to come
home.''
   The return by the Smithsonian Institution of 16 Blackfeet Indian
remains and New York State's decision to give back 12 Onondaga
wampum belts reflect the growing sensitivity among museums to the
origin, or provenance, of their acquisitions and the deep emotions
stirred by their removal.
   An even faster growing public empathy for peoples whose past has
been plundered is evidenced in the popularity of Tony Hellerman's
novel ``Talking God,'' more than two months on the best-seller list.
The plot involves a Navajo activist who digs up an Episcopal
churchyard and ships family skeletons to a Smithsonian curator to
protest the 18,000 Native American remains still stored in the
museum's vaults for study by anthropologists.
   But perhaps the most chilling moral deterrent to fencing stolen
goods in the name of fine art was last month's landmark decision by
a federal judge ordering an Indianapolis art dealer to return to the
Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus exquisite sixth-century mosaics
ripped from the ceiling of a tiny stone church after the 1974
Turkish invasion. The church and the Cypriot government of the
Greek-ruled side of the island jointly sued for recovery after
learning that dealer Peg Goldberg was offering the four Byzantine
treasures, one of them a rare portrait of Christ as a boy, to
California's Getty Museum for $20 million.
   In the usual tangled web of international art traffic, dealer
Goldberg bought the mosaics near the Geneva, Switzerland, airport
from Aydin Dikmen, an allegedly terminally ill Turk living in
Munich, through an Amsterdam middleman named Michael van Rijn. Van
Rijn claimed to be related to Rembrandt on his father's side and
Rubens on his mother's, but indeed had been convicted in France of
forging Marc Chagall's signature on lithographs.
   Alan Shestack, director of Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, said in
an interview that ``more and more museum directors are worrying
about issues we used to wink at. We're a lot more concerned about
where works of art come from and how they got here.''

FT  19 DEC 92 / Travel: In search of the shy tribe of Thailand - Justin
Wintle heads south from Bangkok into baking hot mountain country in pursuit
of a tiny timid people and is greeted with laughter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HAVING escaped the sticky velvet claws of Bangkok, I am in no hurry to
return. I decide, instead, to head south, all the way down the Kra isthmus
to the Malaysian border. My object is to visit a tribe called the Sakai.
My interest in the Sakai is twofold. In the first instance they are
Australasian-Negroids, sometimes called pygmy negritos. Having once
travelled around the Solomon Islands, I am curious to see for myself the
physical relationship between the Sakai and some of the black Melanesians
encountered in the South Pacific.
Secondly, more whimsically, I am chasing a different sort of memory. My
earliest forays into Thailand, in the mid-1970s, regularly took me to the
north of the country, beyond Chiang Mai. There, like other would-be
jungle-bashers of the period, I hunted out relatively unknown hill-tribes.
My happiest achievement was to have spent a week with the dog-eating,
opium-smoking Akhai, in a village to which even my hired guide refused to
accompany me. Since then, however, those remote mountain areas have been
opened up, and hill-tribe-visiting, among the Akhai, Meo and Karen, has
become a tourist routine.
The deep and mainly Moslem Thai south, on the other hand, has lagged behind
tourism's relentless exploitation of the country's human resources, and so
it is my hope to resavour some of the joy of original travel.
I take the early boat from Nathon to the mainland, weaving through smaller
islands of great beauty. Then it is a five-hour coach journey to Hat Yai,
about half-way to my intended destination.
Hat Yai, though, is more than a staging post. Rather, it is the south's
principal commercial city. Three long central streets provide a mart for
chattels of all sorts, including exotic birds and fish. What gives the place
its character is the identity of the shoppers: mainly Malaysians who have
streamed over the border at Sadao or Padang Besar in search of bargains or a
good time.
Like every other place in Thailand, Hat Yai has a smattering of tarts, only
more so. There are no go-go bars, though: for the Moslem customers a
non-alcoholic presentation is preferred.
Even so, in the wake of Aids, Hat Yai has been the cause of considerable
acrimony between the Thai and Malaysian governments. South of the border the
authorities have done what they can to discourage sex-trips; north of it,
officials have issued dubious disclaimers.
I check in at the Dusit J B, the hotel that seems most likely to offer me
comfort and least likely to give me a sexually transmitted disease.
Fortunately, my hunch is accurate on both counts. A new wing has rooms that
are probably superior to any others in a radius of several hundred
kilometres and no massage parlour-cocktail lounge-nightclub, although the
same cannot be said of the old wing.
Then I make my way to the regional tourist office. In no time at all, and
with the help of a local tour operator, a three-day programme is planned.
Mercifully, the only material about the Sakai available is half a typed page
that tells me they 'are content just living day to day eating this and
that,' and that 'their greatest fear is the fear of ghosts.'
The following day is spent loitering in the Hat Yai area, which mainly means
loitering around Songkhla, the adjacent port and resort city. I am taken to
a splendid seven-tiered waterfall at Ton Nga Chang which massages the eyes
and ears as no human agent could. Then it is eastwards and up another hill,
to the Institute for Southern Thai Studies' Folklore Museum, a scattering of
teak pavilions that contain, among many other traditional artefacts, an
unrivalled collection of personalised coconut graters.
A coconut grater in this part of the world is not a slim tin object you hang
on your kitchen wall. Rather, it is a low-lying stool, carved out of a
single block of wood, with a metallic blade inserted in the forward section.
In a country that offers more scope for individualism than anywhere else in
the Far East, these blocks have, over the centuries, taken on the forms of
various animals - tigers, rabbits, turtles, even small boys.
But perhaps the finest exhibits are the stunning views over nearby fishing
villages, with stilted prawneries stretching far into the sea, and across
Songkhla Lake. Thither I now descend. What is left of the afternoon and the
early evening is spent loitering on Samila Beach. Miss Ouyporn from the
tourist office gathers spiral shells from around the base of a deteriorating
and much-photographed golden mermaid and gives them to me: a simple
hospitality that puts even the offshore naval frigate in a kindly light.
But Miss Ouyporn, alas, has not been detailed to venture with me to Yala and
beyond, so my travels are now to be unleavened by the female presence.
Instead, they are increasingly hot. The temperature climbs steadily to 40`C
and higher. There is also a frisson of danger, as my (male) guide explains.
The southernmost provinces were once a communist stronghold, and although
there are no communists now, there are still a few 'outlaws' who have
somehow acquired 'war weapons.'
The road, running parallel but at a distance from the slanting Malaysian
border, is serviceable, the half-baked landscape thinly populated. A
disproportionate quantity of white Mercedes, not all of them bearing
Malaysian number-plates, kick up clouds of dust that pick out the road
ahead, as do a disproportionate quantity of small military convoys. In the
villages, where there should be gleaming temples, there are mosques instead.
We are now on the edge of a typhoon belt, though happily, in boiling April,
the belt is dormant. We pass through Chana, a nowhere village that boasts
one of the oddest festivals in Asia: a competition of singing doves. In a
small park a forest of tall bamboo poles stands ready and waiting for 1,000
cages to be hoisted aloft. The trills and cooing of the zebra doves, brought
by their owners from all over south-east Asia, are then keenly compared,
though with the poles only 1 metre or so apart and 3m-4m high it must be
hard to arrive at a clear winner.
After two hours the road forks: Pattani and Narathiwat to the left, Yala to
the right. We turn right. Hills and small mountains materialise. In one of
these there is a vast cave, as big as a provincial cathedral, and within is
a reclining Buddha, 25m long and 700 years old, a remnant of the Srijaya
civilisation of far-away Java.
At my insistence we spend too long at Wat Khuhaphimuk. The Buddha really is
impressive, the more so since I had no forewarning of it. But what makes the
place special, even unique, is the ragged gaping hole in the cave's roof.
Overgrown with twisted tropical flora on its circumference, it seems to
control the inflow of light so that the Buddha's vast closed-eyed face is
naturally illuminated without being woken. Spindly grey monkeys clamber up
the steep rockface to peer down through this vent. To see them from within
is a curious inversion of roles. One feels examined, as though a member of a
peculiar species that doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the natural
order.
And so to Yala, which again surprises me, for it is not, as I had expected,
a scrubby southern market town but something of a garden city, painstakingly
laid out in concentric circles with a long and more or less prosperous
boulevard to boot.
We put up for the night at the Yala Rama, which is clean and modern enough,
but clearly a prostitute hotel. Notices in the lift proclaim three distinct
retail outlets: a nightclub, a cocktail lounge and a barber-shop backing
onto a snooker room, both offering massage.
On the morning of the third day we at last set off for the Sakai village, in
Than To district, Yala province. The road, snaking toward the border town of
Betong between steep and jagged mountains sporting heavy green jungle
plumage, is nothing short of glorious. We have entered one of the better of
Thailand's 63 national parks.
We stop first at the park's headquarters, to collect a ranger and his
antique rifle. From there it is a mere 30 minutes in our Toyota Carry Boy to
the Sakhai settlement, called Village No 3 in the Ban Rae sub-district.
It is a small place, eight huts and an open hall strewn on the side of a hot
hill overlooking a hotter valley, total population 37, the only Sakhai
domiciled in Thailand. As luck would have it, 25 of them, representing
one-twelfth of all the Sakai on the planet, are absent, visiting relatives
in Malaysia. But as luck also has it, the headman, Mr Lud, has stayed behind
with two of the womenfolk and two of the childfolk.
When I arrive, all five are seated in the open hall watching TV. In spite of
their legendary shyness, none of them runs away. They remain glued to the
box. Yet I manage to detach old Lud, a cheerful, smiling man. His features,
weathered and compressed, with upwardly exposed nostrils and reds insteads
of whites around the small brown eyes, are instantly recognisable, or would
be were I on Guadalcanal. Although he is 50-plus, he has the unspoilt torso
of a 12-year-old.
What is even better is Lud's volubility. Nor is there a language problem: he
speaks the same Malay as my guide. He tells me as much as anyone could be
told about the Sakhai in an hour.
Originally his people were nomadic, wandering to and fro across the frontier
at will. But the communist insurgency put a stop to that. Both governments
decided it would enhance security if the Sakhai put down roots, so most were
settled in Malaysia while a few ended up in Thailand. The village children
attend Thai schools, where they are taught the Thai language. It is left to
Mr Lud to teach them the Sakai language. It would, he says, break his heart
if the day ever came when no-one knew the rudiments of Sakhainese.
But does he like his new home, his new environment? Lud giggles. Things are
very nice. The huts are well-made, the government provides electricity, and
he likes the TV. The village itself is 10 years old. But there again, it is
different to the way he grew up.
As well as housing, his people have been granted some land. But land
ownership brings responsibilities. In the old days one simply scavenged in
the forest for food. Now, to an extent, the Sakai must earn their keep. They
produce four or five sheets of rubber a day, as well as a little coffee and
some coconuts. 'So we can make some money for ourselves, which we never had
before, to spend on rice, which we never ate before.'
Lud takes me across to his hut, vanishes for a few moments, and reappears
with some scrawny roots. These, it transpires, are the traditional herbal
medicines of his people, culled from the forest. They work against most
jungle diseases - he has never had malaria - but in the big world of
antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals, he finds they have no value.
What, I ask, does Mr Lud think will happen to him when he dies?
'Oh, religion, you mean. We find that very confusing. Of course we want to
go to heaven, but the Buddhists tell us the path lies this way, while the
Moslems say no, the path lies that way. Should we burn our dead, or bury
them?'
'But what did the Sakai believe in the past?' Again he giggles.
'Not a lot, I think. We were too busy enjoying ourselves, moving through the
jungle all the time. Or, if we did believe in anything, I've forgotten it
now.'
'And visitors? Does it annoy you when people like me arrive in your village
with a lot of questions and cameras?'
Mr Lud explodes with laughter.
'No, no, no. I love visitors. I wish we had more. You see, even with the TV,
even when everyone is here, it gets so lonely.'
I stand to leave. My guide puts in a question of his own. Can Mr Lud show us
his deadly blowpipe? For the first time he looks sad. Sorry, no blowpipe. He
had one, but he sold it to the local police chief for a measly sum.
The word from Village No 3 is that the Thai Sakai are well on their way to
being assimilated . . . all 37 of them.
