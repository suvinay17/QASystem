Talk show host Regis Philbin, who has ribbed pregnant co-host Kathie Lee 
Gifford about her burgeoning belly over the past few months, will get the 
tables turned on him. 
</P>
<P>
In what's being billed as a Day-In-The-Life of a Pregnant Man, Philbin on 
Monday will strap on a 35-pound "Empathy Belly," a device designed specifically 
for men to experience the severe discomforts of pregnancy -- including fetal 
kicks and pressure on the kidneys. 
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for the "Live With Regis and Kathie Lee," Philbin will 
wear his belly all day, not just during the taping. A camera crew will follow 
Philbin around New York as he attends business meetings, a power lunch with his 
agent at a prominent Manhattan restaurant and an afternoon piano lesson before 
going home. The footage will air Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the first child for Kathie Lee, wife of ABC sportscaster Frank 
Gifford.

<LEADPARA>  THE "Miss America" people are busy, busy, busy behind the beauty-queen scene,
getting ready to make a big pitch for Kathie Lee Gifford and Regis Philbin --
those denizens of ABC's hit morning show "Live With Regis and Kathie Lee" --
to host the next "Miss America Pageant" in Atlantic City.;    Even though NBC
traditionally presents the show, networks are crossing lines more and more
these days. Exclusivity seems to be going down the drain, so they may be able
to work it out to get a "loan" from ABC.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>      INDUSTRY EYE: "Thirtysomething's" Ken Olin expects to be busy behind the
cameras by month's end -- directing "Doing Time on Maple Drive." The telepic,
currently being cast, involves a seemingly happy American family whose deep
dysfunctions begin to surface as the clan prepares for a wedding.;    Olympia
Dukakis is set to play a 75-year-old matriarch who finds herself coping with a
broken hip, a failing memory, and family troubles in "Fire In The Dark," a CBS
movie set to start shooting June 17. Lindsay Wagner plays Dukakis' daughter in
the drama.; From Marilyn Beck and Stacy Jenel Smith in Hollywood;    NO OGRE:
Actress Sheryl Lee Ralph says Robert De Niro "hasn't lived up to his
reputation one bit" during filming of their big-screen "Mistress." The former
"It's a Living" star explains that, prior to production of the film in which
she plays De Niro's mistress, "Everybody was trying to tell me what the 'real'
Robert De Niro was like -- don't stand too close to him . . . he's hard to get
along with.' But with me he's been nothing but charming, funny . . . and he
loves to give advice.";    Ralph, who's still waiting for a go on Disney's
"Randall &amp; Juliet" that's been in search of a leading man since Richard
Dreyfuss dropped out of the project last year, has been spending her spare
time producing Saturday's "DIVAS Simply Singing" benefit at L.A.'s Masonic
Temple. She says the Minority AIDS fund-raiser was a breeze to put together,
thanks to such divas as Debbie Allen, Diahann Carroll, Marilyn McCoo, Liz
Torres and Mary Wilson -- who'll each sing a tune accompanied only by piano.
NEW HORIZONS: Grammy-winning singer Jody Watley is in L.A., waxing a ballad
titled "Begins With You" for her August-release MCA "Affairs of the Heart"
album. "Begins" also marks the beginning of Watley's career as a record
producer.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  WOMAN; TELEVISION; INTERVIEW; PROGRAM; QA; PROFILE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  With her talk show colleague Regis Philbin (below, left), Gifford, 37, will
co-host the Miss America Pageant Saturday night. She is married to sportcaster
Frank Gifford.; Q. The key to your show's popularity is the first 15 minutes
when you and Regis Philbin chat about anything from Regis' root canal and your
baby to the day's headlines. Does it surprise you that more than 3 million
households are interested in listening to you discuss these things?  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  West  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  KATHIE LEE GIFFORD  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  WEST CLOSE-UPS; INTERVIEW  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  A. It's always surprised me. I wonder if I would if I were sitting at home.
But I try not to think about that. I try to think about just being spontaneous
with Regis. I've discovered from years and years of live performance that if
I'm having a good time, then usually an audience is too.;   Q. You don't talk
to each other before the show?;   A. We say, "Good morning," and that's it.
That makes it fun for us. Even though this show has only been national for the
past two years, Regis has been doing it for 20 years and I've been with him
for five now. So you can't do it day-in, day-out and continue to enjoy it
unless it's fresh for you every day.;   Q. Have there been times when one of
you came off stage and said, "You crossed the line today"?;   A. Yes, we're
very honest with each other. My husband is a very private person, so there are
certain things that he says, "Kathie, this is not for national discussion." So
I have to sometimes say to Reege, "Don't mention this." But we don't try to
hide our humanity at all. If I've got a zit, like I do now, I'm shocked he
didn't point it out. Tomorrow I'm going to tell him about this hair that's
been hanging out of his nose for four days. I've given him time to cut it, and
if it's still there tomorrow morning I'm going to get my little scissors out
and I'm going to cut it for him on the air.;   Q. Do you get annoyed with each
other?;   A. Absolutely. Don't you get annoyed with family members? After five
years we know each other so well, we really know which buttons to push. But
again, that's the dynamic relationship we have. He's one of my dearest friends
and I wouldn't do anything to hurt him. Sometimes when you're live and
spontaneous you're going to say something that will be offensive to some
people or that some people will take the wrong way. Whenever I discover
through a letter or something that I've hurt somebody's feelings, I'm crushed.
That's the hardest part of what we do -- trying to be funny and spontaneous
and have a good time at nobody else's expense.; Q. Your dressing room looks
like a nursery because your baby son comes here every day with you. Why did
you choose that instead of leaving him at home in Greenwich with the nanny?;
A. The obvious reason -- because I love Cody and I want him with me. I had the
kind of mother who was always there for me and I want Cody to know that even
though I'm a career person and the career has a place in my life, it is not
the sum total of my life. I wasn't going to come back to work unless I could
have him with me everyday. I don't want to miss his first this or his first
that. He's probably the only child I'll ever have and I don't want to someday
say, "I sacrificed quality time with him to have -- what? -- a 30 share in the
ratings." What does that mean? So it's a luxury to attempt to have both.;   Q.
Your show is studiously uncontroversial and unaggressive and. . . .;   A.
We've covered almost anything you'd see on Oprah or Donahue or Sally or
Geraldo, but we have not had them for a whole hour to exploit. We've had
Siamese twins on -- we had them before anyone else did. We've had Larry
Kramer, when he wrote The Normal Heart about the gay situation and AIDS. We've
had Jimmy Breslin, Mayor Dinkins. We just don't do a whole hour on them and we
don't do it every day.;   Q. Your popularity rests partly on revealing your
private life. On the other hand, everybody wants to keep a spot. . . .;   A.
That's the main reason we moved to Connecticut -- to have as much sanity and
as much normalcy in our lives as possible. I pay for popularity as any
performer does. I'm very human and I don't like to get hurt. That gets to me
only one-tenth as much as it used to, because of Frank, mostly -- he's been in
the public eye for so many years that he really has been able to put it in
perspective for me. Because of the nature of our show, most of our fans are
the nicest people in the world. But I remember once coming out of the Plaza
Hotel and this lady comes up to me and says, "Oh, I love your show, I love
Regis, but I gotta tell ya, that dress you had on the other day? Terrible, the
worst I ever saw." I wasn't unkind or anything, but I said, "I didn't ask
you." And she was so shocked. She thought that because she sees me on
television she has the right to insult me. She has the right to her opinion,
but I don't have to stand there and smile at a person who's rude.  </TEXT>

Tuesday night, less than a week after Trump publicly dumped her and was linked
to Italian supermodel Carla Bruni.;    "We've decided this is the thing to do.
She's something special. It's worked out great," Trump said in a phone call
broadcast on the syndicated program "Live With Regis &amp; Kathie Lee." Maples had
spent the past few days at the apartment of co-host Kathie Lee Gifford.;   
What kind of ring did Maples get? Ronald Winston, head of Harry Winston Inc.
jewelers, is only too happy to answer. Trump picked out a nearly eight-carat
emerald-cut gem, set among a row of diamonds.;    Chuck Jones, a spokesman for
Maples, confirmed that she had accepted Trump's marriage proposal. "That's
right. But I can't say anything else about it," said Jones.;    One note of
caution in all this: No wedding date was announced.  </TEXT>

   Kathie Lee Gifford admits her on-air campaign
to win a ``Most Beautiful Woman on TV'' poll was ``totally, totally
shameless.''
   But it worked.
   Gifford, who campaigned good-naturedly and tirelessly on her
syndicated show, ``Live with Regis and Kathie Lee,'' far
outdistanced such glamorous stars as Jaclyn Smith and Connie
Sellecca in voting announced this week in TV Guide.
   ``There is no accounting for my behavior,'' Gifford said. ``I
didn't do anything illegal, though. I didn't steal anything.''
   Gifford got 17,796 phone-in votes to Smith's 3,603. Nicollette
Sheridan was third with 3,074 votes. Then came Delta Burke, Melissa
Brennan, Kirstie Alley, Dana Delany, Connie Sellecca, Stepfanie
Kramer, Jasmine Guy, Valerie Bertinelli and Phylicia Rashad.
   ``It's hysterical,'' Gifford said. ``Of course, I'm not the most
beautiful woman on TV _ but for one week, it would be great to
think so.''
   ``Too bad I don't have a TV talk show to wage a campaign,'' said
Holly Robinson of ``21 Jump Street,'' who got 674 votes.
   Vanna White received 1,291 votes, but her manager said, ``If
Vanna had done that for her 20 million viewers, she'd (have blown)
Kathie out of the water.''

   A performance by comedian Andrew Dice Clay will go
ahead Sunday, but without local sponsors.
   A Dallas radio station became the fifth group to withdraw as a
sponsor for the show at the Starplex Amphitheatre.
   Clay has drawn criticism for offensive references in his
stand-up comedy act to women, homosexuals and minorities.
   KTXQ-FM's action followed the withdrawal of Coca-Cola, Miller
beer, WFAA-TV and The Dallas Morning News. The five organizations
have been season sponsors of the theater's summer concert series.
   ``We sponsor hundreds of concerts ever year, and if it's going
to alienate people, or offend people, it's not in our best interest
to sponsor the act,'' said KTXQ program director Andy Lockridge.
   Larry Fontana, general manager for Starplex, said the show would
go on regardless of the number of sponsors. He said ticket sales
were good.

   The National Women's Hall of Fame
couldn't find a company willing to help fly tennis great Billie
Jean King to her induction ceremonies. And that upset the hall's
director.
   Emilie C. Sisson said more than 20 major corporations were asked
for a loan of a private jet or donations of $3,000 to $4,000 so one
could be rented.
   ``We're talking some of the big guys, we're talking Fortune 500
companies. . . . They all said no,'' Sisson said. ``It's partly

   Sisson declined to list the companies that turned down the
hall's request. The hall instead will pay to fly King in, she said.
   The 47-year-old King, who won 20 Wimbledon titles and dominated
women's tennis for years, will be inducted into the hall Sunday
along with former U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan of Texas, tuberculosis
researcher Dr. Florence B. Seibert and the late photojournalist
Margaret Bourke-White. Neither Jordan nor Seibert can attend the

   King will be in New York City this weekend working as a

flights are available after the Sunday night ceremony that would
get her back in time for work Monday morning, Sisson said.

   County music singer Dottie West has
filed for bankruptcy reorganization, citing $1 million in debts.
   Documents filed Aug. 16 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court showed the
singer's biggest debt is a $703,090 home loan from First American
Bank.
   The bank recently foreclosed on the singer's Williamson County
house and property and she was ordered to vacate the property.
   West, best known as one of Kenny Rogers' duet partners, is a
member of the Grand Ole Opry and has recorded such hits as
``Country Sunshine'' and ``A Lesson In Leaving.'' Her ``Here Comes
My Baby'' in 1964 won country music's first Grammy Award in the
female vocalist category.
   She listed less than $500,000 in assets and more than 20
creditors, including the Internal Revenue Service.
   In a recent interview with The Tennessean newspaper, West said
she was doing fine, although her financial problems had not been
easy.
   ``I'm a survivor. You can knock me down, but you better have a
big rock to keep me there,'' she said.

   ``Cheers'' star Ted Danson was late
for an appearance at an American Oceans Campaign benefit because a
truckload of tuna overturned on the freeway, backing up traffic for
miles.
   More than 200 partygoers awaited the appearance of Danson, who
was stuck on Interstate 5 with thousands of other motorists.
   ``Here we are at a `Celebration of the Sea' and there are 40,000
pounds of canned tuna on the highway. I think there's some irony in
that,'' said Eric Hansen, a benefit organizer.
   Danson, president and co-founder of the American Oceans
Campaign, finally made his entrance Friday 20 minutes before the
party's end. The organization is dedicated to the protection and
restoration of the ocean.
   ``I grew up in Arizona, the son of an archaeologist. I was
instilled with the thought that there is lots that came before us
and lots will come after us. It gave me a sense of stewardship,''
said Danson.
   ``We thought we'd concentrate all our money, all our energy and
all our time into one area and see what kind of impact we can
make.''
   The benefit also featured appearances by actors John
Ratzenberger, Woody Harrelson, Ed Begley Jr., Robert Urich and
Peter Weller.

   Connie Sellecca claims she was fired from the
starring role in ABC's upcoming comedy ``Baby Talk'' and is suing
for more than $1.5 million.
   The lawsuit, filed Tuesday, alleges that producer Ed Weinberger
``beat up on Sellecca emotionally'' and demanded that she submit
unconditionally to his authority.
   Sellecca, a former star of ABC's ``Hotel,'' claimed she was paid
only $25,000 for the pilot episode instead of a promised $45,000.
   Weinberger and Columbia Pictures Television declined to comment
Wednesday.
   ``Baby Talk,'' a spinoff of the hit film ``Look Who's Talking,''
has been beset by problems. Before the spat with Sellecca, ABC had
ordered the pilot redone.

   The director, who is black, has come under attack from Jewish
organizations for the movie characters Moe and Josh Flatbush.
   ``I challenge anyone to tell me why I can't portray two club
owners who happen to be Jewish and who exploit the black musicians
who work for them,'' Lee wrote Wednesday on The New York Times
opinion page. ``All Jewish club owners are not like this, that's
true, but these two are.''
   Lee accused his critics of applying a double standard.
   ``Not every black person is a pimp, murderer, prostitute,
convict, rapist or drug addict, but that hasn't stopped Hollywood
from writing these roles for African-Americans,'' Lee wrote.

   Cosell, in his book ``I Never Played the Game,'' criticized his

   Cosell said Gifford was a ``Teflon man'' because no matter what
mistakes he made, ``nothing sticks to him'' and TV critics treat
him well. He also said Meredith was rarely prepared for a broadcast.

   Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be
restless, says Willie Nelson, who blames his wanderlust nature for
ruining three marriages.
   The country music singer says in his autobiography, ``Willie,''
due out next month from Simon and Schuster, that he prefers the
road to matrimony.
   Nelson met his third wife, Connie, in 1969. They married, had
two children and lived in Westlake Hills on the shores of Lake
Austin, Texas.
   But they spent much of their time arguing.
   ``For me the choice came down to staying ... with Connie all the
time when I came off the road _ which meant giving up all my pals
who I hung around with on the golf course or in my recording studio
_ or never going back to the ... house again,'' Nelson said in his
book.
   He chose to leave and the couple divorced.
   Nelson, whose hits include ``Mama, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up
to Be Cowboys,'' and ``Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain,'' admits life
as Mrs. Willie Nelson would be difficult.
   ``It's not easy to be married to somebody like me and be a wife
and stay home and take care of the family when I'm out here acting
like a big star,'' Nelson said. ``I mean, it rubs.''

   Time has run out on a congressional bid to
grant tennis star Ivan Lendl immediate citizenship so he could play
on the U.S. Olympic team, lawmakers said.
   Lendl has lived in Greenwich, Conn., since 1981 and wanted to
represent his adopted homeland in Seoul this month.
   Enlisting the help of Connecticut lawmakers, Lendl won House
Judiciary Committee approval in April of a special immigration bill.
   Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis., blocked the measure on
the House floor, saying he would drop his opposition only if the
Czech government provided a waiver for Lendl to be a member of the
U.S. team.
   Olympic rules required a waiver because Lendl had represented
Czechoslovakia in international competition at the Davis Cup.
   The Czechoslovak Association of Physical Culture rejected the
waiver.
   ``We pressed the issue,'' Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn., said
last week. ``Maybe we could have (succeeded) with more time, but
... time has basically run out.''
   Lendl, 28, received his permanent residence status last year. He
will be eligible for citizenship through traditional procedures in
1992. His attorney and spokeswoman did not return telephone calls
for comment.

   The Prince and Princess of Wales canceled an
appearance at the premiere of a film about a daring British train
robber because its star, singer Phil Collins, advised them not to
go.
   Collins, who plays train robber Ronald ``Buster'' Edwards in the
film ``Buster,'' said Monday he wrote Prince Charles and Princess
Diana that they should shun the Sept. 15 premiere.
   ```Buster' does not in any way glorify crime'' as critics have
claimed, Collins said.
   But, he said, in light of the controversy, he wrote the royal
couple ``suggesting that it would probably be best if they did not
attend.''
   A Buckingham Palace spokesman said the prince and princess were
``aware of the contents of the letter that Phil Collins has written
them and in the light of this they have decided not to go.''
   The Great Train Robbery of Aug. 8, 1963, was one of Britain's
most daring heists. More than 120 mailbags containing $7 million in
used banknotes were taken off a mail train from Glasgow to London
of which less than $980,000 were recovered.
   Thirteen people, including Edwards, stood trial in 1964 for the
crime. No one was killed during the robbery, but one man was
seriously injured.

the scenes and close to the star know how much Taylor has agonized over
Getty's illness. The 32-year-old was the first wife of Taylor's second son,
Christopher Wilding. She has been HIV positive for at least six years, and
during all this time Taylor has struggled mightily to help her former

Christopher have been divorced for some time, I will always love Aileen as if
she were my very own child." The Taylor grandchildren of that union and their

   Messner Vetere Tapped for Volvo Account

   Volvo, which put its advertising account up for review
after conceding that one of its commercials was rigged,
tapped Messner Vetere Berger Carey Schmetterer to handle the
$40 million account.
   Messner was widely considered the front-runner in the ad
review. The agency's president, Robert Schmetterer, is a
former Volvo executive who later worked at Volvo's longtime
ad agency, Scali, McCabe Sloves. Messner also vastly outspent
the two ad agencies it competed with for the business.
Industry executives believe it poured about $200,000 into its
pitch, which included finished commercials and print work;
the other agencies spent well under $100,000, executives say.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For Volvo, the move marks the end of a 23-year
relationship with Scali, a WPP Group unit. Volvo was one of
Scali's first clients after the ad agency opened its doors in
1967. Volvo's reputation for safety and reliability was
largely honed by Scali, which coined the decade-old slogan,
"A car you can believe in."
   That relationship unraveled in November, however, in a
tangle of scathing headlines over a commercial in which a
souped-up pickup truck drives over a row of cars, crushing
all but the Volvo. As it turns out, the Volvo had been
reinforced with wood and steel, while the supports on some
other cars had been cut. In the embarrassing aftermath, Scali
resigned the account, although it denied direct
responsibility. Volvo also has denied responsiblity. The
Federal Trade Commission is still probing the incident.
   Marvin Sloves, Scali's chairman, said yesterday, "After 23
years of extraordinary success and friendship with Volvo, I
can only wish them great luck in the years to come." Scali
will continue servicing the account until Messner takes over
April 1.
   The Volvo win vaults Messner into the big leagues. As
recently as October, the agency was a boutique shop with a
strong creative reputation and only $75 million in billings.
Then, in November, it won the MCI account, with billings
projected to go as high as $80 million. That win, too, was
helped by personal ties, since partner Tom Messner oversaw
the MCI account in the early 1980s at Ally &amp; Gargano.
Together, both big new accounts push Messner Vetere's total
billings toward $200 million, said Mr. Schmetterer.
   Mr. Schmetterer has almost two decades of experience
working with Volvo. He was the car maker's market research
director from 1967 to 1971, before jumping to Scali, where he
worked on the account through 1984. He also is friendly with
Volvo's top executives, including its president, Joseph
Nicolato, and its senior vice president of marketing, William
J. Hoover.
   A Volvo spokesman said, nonetheless, that the race was
tight. Another midsized agency, Altschiller Reitzfeld, had
developed an impressive pitch, and Volvo didn't make its
final decision between the two until late Wednesday. "They
were both excellent," the spokesman said. He said one reason
Messner edged out its competitor is because it proposed an
incentive-based compensation package.
   Both the spokesman and Messner declined to elaborate on
the incentive plan, but ad executives said it would link
Messner's pay to Volvo's sales and market share, among other
factors. The base pay would work out to less than the
traditional 15% agency commission, but with incentives, pay
could come to more than 15%. Messner won't be buying
broadcast time for Volvo; it still has no broadcast media
buying department, and says it has no plans to create one.
   Don't expect Volvo's message to change just because it has
a new ad agency. The car maker has spent decades forging its
image of safety and durability and isn't about to let that
slip away. "To change what the company stands for doesn't
make sense," the spokesman said.
   What will change, executives involved in the pitch said,
is the tone of Volvo's commercials, which are expected to
become more emotional. The car maker is looking for ads "that
reach consumers' hearts and minds, more than
demonstration-type safety" ads, said Len Sirowitz,
co-chairman of Rosenfeld, Sirowitz, Humphrey &amp; Strauss, the
third agency in the pitch. Volvo's recent ads have been
colder and more clinical, including one commercial featuring
a model human skeleton.
   Volvo contributed $15,000 to each agency's pitch and asked
for campaigns that stressed the car company's "core" values:
safety, reliability, durability and quality. Each agency was
asked to come up with a regional marketing plan for Southern
California as well as a national image campaign.
   Messner is well-suited to emotional advertising. Four of
its principals were part of President Reagan's 1984 "Tuesday
Team," which created campaign commercials and the "prouder,
stronger, better" video shown at the 1984 Republican
Convention. Current clients include Commodore computers, Life
magazine, and New Balance sneakers.
   Volvo, meanwhile, could use some additional marketing
punch. Unit sales declined to 90,000 in 1990 from 103,000 the
year before, largely because of pressure from new Japanese
luxury cars such as Toyota's Lexus, said John Casesa, an
analyst with Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. "Volvo is a high-risk
candidate to lose share" to Lexus and other new Japanese
luxury cars, he said. "It's critical for Volvo to maintain a
distinctive image."

   Nabisco's New Cracker Ad
                                                                                                       

   Nabisco is getting a lot of mileage out of the first
commercial for its new Harvest Crisps crackers -- and the ad
won't even begin airing until Monday.
   The spot features talk-show host Regis Philbin and his
wife, Joy, munching on the snacks. Since Mr. Philbin landed
the part, he has been chatting incessantly about it on his
syndicated "Live with Regis &amp; Kathie Lee" talk show. He and
co-host Kathie Lee Gifford have talked about nearly every
aspect of the commercial and even have shown a series of
outtakes on the air. The ad was created by McCann-Erickson,
an Interpublic Group agency.
   A spokeswoman for the RJR Nabisco unit says it is
"delighted" with the extra PR, adding that the target for
Harvest Crisps is similar to the audience of Mr. Philbin's
show.

MTV CHANGES FORMAT, MIXING FULL-LENGTH SHOWS, MUSIC VIDEOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITERTelevision: The outlaw rock-music channel will 
announce the inclusion of several 'customized' series during the Western Cable 
Show in Anaheim. 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MTV -- the cable channel that made a business and a pop-culture art form out of 
quick-hit music videos -- is moving away from its original all-video format. 
</P>
<P>
Expanding a recent trend toward full-length shows on the rock-music channel, 
MTV in January will launch several new series, from a morning program hosted by 
a male-female duo to "vidcoms" (a hybrid of comedy and music videos). The new 
shows are designed to appeal to viewers throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to have hosts and shows that differentiate MTV in the morning from 
MTV at night, the way that NBC viewers know that they're going to see Bryant 
Gumbel in the morning and Tom Brokaw at night," Doug Herzog, senior vice 
president in charge of programming for MTV, said in an interview Tuesday. 
"Music videos will still represent 90% of our programming. But instead of 
having random videos, we'll be customizing shows and hosts to improve our 
presentation to the audience who's out there." 
</P>
<P>
The changes, Herzog emphasized, are evolutionary, not revolutionary -- which, 
in terms of MTV's outlaw image with young people, would mean turning it into 
conventional network TV. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Dayparting' does represent a bit of maturing on our part," he said, 
referring to the practice of offering different types of programs at different 
times of the day, "but we're never going to be all-programmed like the networks 
because we're driven by music videos. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made frequent changes in MTV because, in effect, we've promised our 
viewers that we won't be the same today as we were five years ago. Part of 
these changes simply come from the fact that we didn't want to enter the next 
decade looking the way we did during the last decade." 
</P>
<P>
Although MTV is seen in some 48 million homes in the United States and has 
expanded to 26 foreign countries, its new programming strategy may give MTV a 
way not only to stay fresh but also to encourage viewers to stay tuned. 
"There's a lot of grazing and zapping out there among TV viewers," Herzog 
acknowledged. "We want to keep people interested between the videos." 
</P>
<P>
MTV is announcing its new overall scheduling strategy this week to cable 
operators at the Western Cable Show in Anaheim, which opens today. Sometime 
next week, the cable network is expected to sign the co-hosts who will 
introduce the videos and do comedy on a new early morning show. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope it will be like Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee Gifford on bad coffee," 
Herzog said. "The premise of the comedy is that she's a morning person, and 
he's not, so he may seemingly stumble into the studio -- or sleep through the 
show altogether." 
</P>
<P>
From 8 to 11 p.m., MTV will introduce a new three-hour programming block to 
counterprogram prime time on the commercial networks. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the place where we'll be emphasizing breaking new videos and news from 
the music world," Herzog said. The hosts for the show have not yet been named. 
</P>
<P>
Among the new "vidcoms" that will be introduced for the 7 p.m. time slot are 
two shows designed as an off-center version of ABC's "Wide World of Sports": 
"Kevin Seal: Sporting Fool," starring a comedian who does unusual sports, such 
as bungee-jumping, and "Colin Quinn's Manly World," with real athletes joining 
the comedian-host.

<LEADPARA>  IT was a telecast to match the game, right up until the end when Al Michaels
uttered the six most hideous words in television, "We'll go down to Brent
Musburger.";    But even Buffoon Brent in the locker room and Fatuous Frank
Gifford in the booth couldn't take the edge off the best-played Super Bowl
ever and ABC's fine coverage of it.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Super Bowl XXV  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Sure the network wasted nearly 2 1/2 hours of our time before the kickoff
and came back an hour after the gun to show lowlights of a truly revolting
halftime show. But in between, terrific camera shots (including those from a
blimp they said they couldn't use), informative graphics and prescient
commentary by Dan Dierdorf made the game a pleasure to watch, no matter who
you were rooting for.;    "Is it too soon to say that this wasn't a bad game?"
Dierdorf wondered at the two-minute warning. No, it wasn't, and there was more
to come.;    As the Buffalo Bills mounted their final drive, for example, ABC
told us that kicker Scott Norwood was 1 for 5 this season on field-goal
attempts from 40 yards or more on grass fields such as that of Tampa Stadium.
A few moments later, the screen said he was 0 for 6 from 50 yards or more.;   
Knowing those statistics, it couldn't have surprised anyone at home when he
missed from 47 and the Bills lost.;    It was a smooth move putting on footage
of Jim O'Brien's field goal of 20 years ago, the only one ever to decide a
Super Bowl, just before Norwood kicked, however.;    Michaels' understated
call ("no good, wide right") and the expected reaction shots of those watching
the kick were keepers, too, especially the one of Bills Coach Marv Levy
holding hands with James Lofton and an assistant coach.;    "If willpower
could have gotten it through . . .," Dierdorf said.;    Then, when the camera
showed a grinning New York Giants Coach Bill Parcells on the other side, he
said, "That is what the Cheshire cat looked like when he ate the canary.";   
Everson Walls appeared as though he could have jumped over the moon as he
leaped with joy on the tube a moment later.;    Scenes such as that are why we
watch sports, especially in what Jack Whitaker correctly called before the
game "a split-screen week" such as the one just past.;    Even Saddam Hussein
cooperated by not lobbing up any Scud missiles while the game was on, so
neither we nor the troops watching in the desert missed a play.;    Dierdorf
didn't miss much either. After Mark Ingram's key catch and run for a Giants
first down in the third quarter, for example, he correctly called it one of
those plays that "set the tone for everything else that follows.";    He was
right. He was right again in calling the drive Ingram kept alive "one of the
great drives in Super Bowl history" and right as well in pointing out when it
was over that it had been more than an hour since the Bills had touched the
ball, except for a last play before halftime.;    He was ahead of the Giants'
offense, as well, in realizing that quarterback Jeff Hostetler could roll to
the left instead of the right where he had been getting stuffed. He appeared
to be a genius when Hostetler went that way several times in the second half
for big yardage.;    Michaels was his usual sharp self calling the game, while
Gifford, who, as an analyst makes a swell husband for chatty Kathie Lee
Gifford, mercifully didn't say much at all -- save for how moving the halftime
show was, most of which was pre-empted by Peter Jennings' war update.;    I
don't know. Somehow I think a simple moment of silence for what's going on in
the Gulf would have been a lot more moving than an army of Disney characters
and a munchkin with a bad haircut and worse voice warbling "Wind Beneath My
Wings.';    But when has even a well-played, well-telecast Super Bowl ever
been in good taste?  </TEXT>

way for that to happen.;   Even if the proposed FCC regulations, introduced
Thursday, allowing Ma, Pa and the Baby Bells to send TV shows over fiber-optic
cables do become law, there are the minor matters of cost and time to consider.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  MA BELL'S PLAN FOR CABLE CONTROL WILL GO ON HOLD  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Television  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Analysts guesstimate it could cost from $100 billion to $200 billion to
bring fiber optics to every American home, a project that would require at
least five years if started tomorrow.;   Which it won't be.;   For one thing,
the powers that be in cable television -- and they are plenty powerful -- will
go to the FCC, Congress and the courts to keep the phone companies out of the
TV business.;   Because, once TV is transmitted over fiber-optic lines --
which would allow hundreds, if not thousands, of programs to be sent via
"video dial tone," as opposed to the dozens the current cable industry can
carry on coaxial cable -- it will mark the end of the cable industry as we
know it.;   Which might not be so bad, considering the arrogance and greed
that characterize much of the industry today.;   On the other hand, replacing
cable companies with phone companies as the source of our primary home
entertainment could amount to trading one necessary evil for an even bigger
one.;   That's Ralph Nader's take on the proposal. It is not the view of FCC
chairman Alfred Sikes, who pushed his fellow commissioners to endorse
Thursday's proposal despite major doubts by some of them.;   The bottom line
for consumers is that fiber optics could offer real competition for cable -- a
way of letting viewers choose what they want to watch instead of having it
chosen for them. It could change television and the way we receive information
at home in ways we can't even imagine now.;   The catch is finding the best
way to do that. The FCC may be on the right track, but it's too early to tell
for sure.; STERN BENCHED -- The Washington Post reports, and NBC confirms,
that the Peacock has taken television's first Supreme Court reporter off the
air.;   Carl Stern, who signed a new three-year contract last June, has been
demoted to well-paid memo-writer, helping other NBC reporters, more favored by
"Nightly News" boss Steve Friedman, cover the beat he has covered so well
since 1967.;   Friedman was quoted as saying that, since decisions "are pretty
much going to be 7-2 from now on, I want to take the story to the country. I
don't want to cover it from Washington. I would do Roe vs. Wade from
Missouri.";   Getting out into the country to explore the practical
implications of a case is well and good, but unless there's a reporter in
Washington who understands Roe vs. Wade, TV can't cover it from Missouri, no
matter how enlightened that sounds. Television doesn't cover Congress from
Missouri; it doesn't cover the White House from there; and it can't cover the
Supreme Court that way, particularly in the wake of Clarence Thomas'
contentious confirmation.;   Major court cases this term have supposedly been
assigned to reporters such as Lisa Myers, Bob Kur and Robert Hager, all of
whom have other beats. Stern is said not to be attending oral arguments
anymore or reviewing the weekly list of cases the court has been asked to
hear.;   Besides humiliating a fine reporter, NBC's decision to jettison
full-time Supreme Court coverage seems a shortsighted and potentially
disastrous one to me -- just one more sign of the desperate cost-cutting at
the network news divisions.;   In the meantime, ABC will still have Tim
O'Brien at the court full-time, while CBS has Rita Braver, who splits her time
between the court and the Justice Department.; MARSHAL AND MASTERPIECE --
Among the multitude of weekend TV choices are the first part of a largely
lighthearted, four-part "Masterpiece Theatre" about spies, and the return of
Marshal Dillon of "Gunsmoke" -- unless the World Series goes seven games.;  
Delayed for unknown reasons last spring, "Gunsmoke III: The Return of the Last
Man" comes to CBS Sunday night (9 p.m., Chs. 5, and 46), unless the Twins beat
the Braves on Saturday to stretch the Series to seven games.;   There probably
are worse ways to spend your time than watching James Arness blow people away
in the name of righteousness -- although none comes immediately to mind.;  
The old guy turned in his badge years ago and left Dodge City for Arizona,
which means the only thing this movie has in common with the old series is
Arness and its title.;   Having lost his wife, the old marshal, his herd of
cattle and what remains of his family seem plagued by trouble.;   I like
westerns. I liked "Gunsmoke," but this new one is just one shoot-out after
another, minus the townsfolk who made the series more than that. There's too
much killing. The marshal should hang up his holster and rest in peace.;  
"Sleepers," on the other hand, the new "Masterpiece Theatre" series (9 p.m.
Sunday, Ch. 9; 2 p.m. Nov. 3, Ch. 54), is an enjoyable romp about a pair of
Soviet spies sent to England 25 years ago with instructions to insinuate
themselves into the culture and await further instructions. They did just
that, and Moscow forgot about them.;   Now, in a story set before the Soviet
coup, the KGB discovers they're missing and tries to get them back. Four
episodes is probably one or two too many for this chase, but it's still a lot
of fun, with some poignancy at the end.; DANA DOES DOUBLE DUTY -- Only "Regis
and Kathie Lee" would allow a topflight impersonator to substitute for one of
its hosts -- which is why Friday's show was an amazing delight. Regis was
away, and Dana Carvey sat in, behaving more like Reeg than the man himself. It
was hilarious, even if Carvey was sometimes too hip for Kathie Lee and the
studio audience. If ever a disposable talk show deserved to be repeated, this
is it.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  GODFATHER of Soul James Brown, who today celebrates his first birthday since
his release from prison, has plans -- lotsa plans -- for the immediate
future.;    The 58-year-old, never-so-humble one says he's focusing on
"bringing back to show business what it's lost in the last few years." As far
as he's concerned, "Music today is going backward. You see people onstage with
no (special) costumes, no attitude, not playing instruments -- not even doing
their own singing. You want to see somebody sweat when they do a job! I do."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  JAMES BROWN: 58, FREE, FEELING GOOD  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  The Grapevine  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Fans will see Brown do his job June 10, when his "James Brown: Livin' in
America" pay-per-view special airs. To hear him tell it, it will be "a dynamic
show that will bring back the fun and the drive of the musical experience. It
will be enormously fantastic on James Brown's account -- a family show, with
no four-letter words.";    Brown also has plans to "get back into the
recording studio soon," has more requests for concert bookings than he could
ever hope to fill. And . . .;    "Someone just offered me a TV show." He gives
no details, but figures, "In one sense I should do it because I'm a role
model, and kids today need role models . . .";    Brown, released from prison
in February after serving 26 months of a six-year sentence for aggravated
assault and possession of a deadly weapon, will be on parole and probation
until 1998.;     WHATEVER HAPPENED TO: Jane Fonda still has writers developing
several prospective big-screen projects for her, but seems less and less eager
to return to work -- and happier and happier as she travels here, there, and
most everywhere with Ted Turner. They still haven't set a date for the
wedding, but friends expect them to tie the knot before the year is out --
possibly as early as this summer. Fonda hasn't been before the cameras since
1988 -- when she made the disappointing "Stanley &amp; Iris" with Robert De Niro.;
From Liz Smith in New York;     TERRIFIC TEN: The "Legends" among contemporary
women, so named by Birmingham Southern College, have included every modern
first lady, media and movie stars, and movers and shakers from every walk of
life.;    This year for its "Gala 10," chairwoman Anne Fuchs of Vogue has
helped guide the college to spectacular selections: former Ambassador to Great
Britain Anne Armstrong; Motown hotshot Suzanne dePasse (she brought "Lonesome
Dove" to TV); Tina Flaherty, CEO of Image Marketing; TV personality Kathie Lee
Gifford; Wilhelmina Cole Holladay of the National Museum of Women in the Arts;
Redbook's Ellen Levine; golfer Nancy Lopez; actress Donna Mills; the wife of
the vice president, Marilyn Quayle; neonatologist Dr. Mildred Thorton
Stahlman; Department of State spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler; Planned
Parenthood President Fay Wattleton; philanthropist and amateur tap dancer
Marylou Vanderbilt Whitney; and advertising's best-selling author, Lois Wyse.;
   The investiture of these women as "legends in their own lifetime" takes
place next weekend in Alabama. I've been to two of these "Galas" and they are
more fun than a cool mint julep in summertime.;    NEXT TARGET: France's sexy
Anne Parillaud is scoring a major success with her film "La Femme Nikita,"
playing a drug addict-turned-government assassin. Now she has put aside her
firearms in favor of something more primitive but equally lethal -- a bow and
arrow. Parillaud will portray a French-Canadian Indian opposite Patrick Bergin
in "Map of the Human Heart," now shooting in Montreal under the direction of
Vincent Ward.;    Bergin first came to attention as Sir Richard Burton in the
film "Mountains of the Moon." This year he is the guy everybody loves to hate
-- Julia Roberts' tormenting, obsessive husband in "Sleeping With the Enemy."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>News Anchors Everywhere in Talk and Variety Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ever wonder what network news anchors and talk
show hosts do when they aren't interviewing people? By golly, they
get interviewed on talk or variety shows, that's what they do.
   Consider: Next Friday, Larry King, who has a CNN talk show, will
talk on NBC's ``Tonight Show.'' On July 13, Jane Pauley will be on
NBC's ``Late Night With David Letterman,'' where she has appeared
before.
   Deborah Norville, who succeeded her on ``Today,'' also has been
on ``Letterman.'' So have such newsguests as Tom Brokaw, John
Chancellor, Connie Chung, Sam Donaldson and Maria Shriver.
   This month, Norville appeared on ``Tonight.'' So did ABC's Peter
Jennings, although on a different evening. CBS' Dan Rather,
meanwhile, was seen in a two-part interview on NBC's ``Later With
Bob Costas.''
   The network newsies for years have been interviewed by print
reporters who grill them on the state of themselves, their shows
and even the cosmos.
   But the appearances of network news stars on talk shows are on
the rise and represent a form of cannibalism, says Reuven Frank,
president of NBC News in 1968-73 and again in 1982-84.
   ``It also is very new,'' he says. Thirty years ago, Frank says,
``it was really a big deal when a main news type would get on an
interview show.''
   He recalls the time it took a direct order to the news division
from Robert Kintner, then president of NBC, to put Chet Huntley and
David Brinkley, co-anchors of ``The Huntley-Brinkley Report,'' on
the ``Tonight Show.''
   Now, no orders are needed. An invitation arrives, the newsfolk
go.
   Why?
   ``I don't know,'' Frank says. ``It's `What is so-and-so really
like?' It's that game.''
   Costas, whose background is sports, not news, was himself
interviewed this year on CBNC's ``The Dick Cavett Show.'' But TV's
news stars don't tend to go to that show. They gravitate to Costas'
half-hour ``Later,'' which has become a second home of sorts for
them.
   In addition to Rather, who first went there in 1988, ``Later''
guests have included Brokaw, Linda Ellerbee, Mike Wallace, Walter
Cronkite, Pauley, Jennings, Ted Koppel, Pierre Salinger and
Kathleen Sullivan.
   Chung also was a guest in a two-part interview in September 1989
when her ``Saturday Night With Connie Chung'' was just starting.
   The first interview was with her. The second show featured Chung
and her husband, ``A Current Affair'' anchorman Maury Povich.
   But Costas doesn't get everyone. It took Barbara Walters, former
co-host of ``Today,'' to land an interview with Bryant Gumbel of
``Today.'' That chat, about the show's woes, was broadcast in March
on ABC's ``20-20.''
   A month later, the syndicated ``Live With Regis &amp; Kathie Lee''
landed an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer, who talked about her
upcoming exclusive interview of Marla Maples for ``PrimeTime Live.''
   (Maples is a friend of Donald Trump, diplomatic observers say.)
   Pickings apparently get so lean at times that TV stars interview
each other. This has happened at least twice so far this year.
   Talk show star Phil Donahue _ who has been interviewed on
Costas' show _ interviewed talk show star Joan Rivers on his show.
In due course, Donahue was interviewed by her on her first show in
New York.
   In May, Chung was interviewed by Arsenio Hall on his syndicated
show. Three nights later, her ``Face to Face With Connie Chung''
special featured her taped interview with ... Arsenio Hall.
   It isn't necessarily bad that a TV news star appears on a talk
or variety show, provided he or she does it with dignity, says
Everette C. Dennis, executive director of the Gannett Center for
Media Studies.
   That such appearances are common now but once were rare is due
to changing times and managements at the networks, he says.
Networks once considered their news divisions as prestigious loss
leaders.
   Now, they want the divisions to turn a profit, he says, and
``this means they have to court the audience. And to some extent,
it's a pretty brazen courtship.''
   For the network anchors and star correspondents, the aim of the
game is publicity for their news programs. The hope is that if
viewers find the news types interesting and likeable, they'll tune
in their shows.
   ``It doesn't stay just on `Watch me in my job and see how well I
do,''' Dennis says. ``Now, it's `Gosh, if you've never heard of me,
watch me on the talk show tonight. You might like me.' ''
   Former NBC News chief Frank is more amused than alarmed about
the trend.
   ``It's very silly,'' he says. ``Here are these guys who do
nothing but talk on their own shows, and they have to go to another
show to talk. I think we ought to get 'em a 900 number they can
call to talk.''
   Is America doomed to even more Anchorama?
   Frank sighed. ``I've come to assume that reason will never set
in,'' he says. ``But it's another fad, and it will burn itself out.
And they'll get somebody more interesting _ like experts.''

   Elsewhere in television...
   BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE: Don Hewitt, the mastermind and scrappy
executive producer of CBS' durable, top-rated ``60 Minutes,'' is
scheduled to talk on a TV talk show. His taped thoughts will air
July 9 and 10 on ``Later With Bob Costas.''

   Marla Maples says she went into hiding amid the
publicity about her reported romance with Donald Trump in part out
of concern for her friends' privacy.
   ``I didn't want to bring any more havoc into my friend's
lives,'' Maples said in an interview with ABC newswoman Diane
Sawyer. ``I had to always think about where I was going and what
effect it could have on the people I was visiting.''
   Sawyer showed a brief clip of the taped interview this morning
on the WABC-TV program ``Live With Regis and Kathie Lee.'' The
interview was to be broadcast tonight on ABC's ``Primetime Live.''
   Allegations of the actress-model's purported affair with Trump
first surfaced in February.
   After she was thrust into the spotlight, Maples said, ``I knew I
had to get away. I knew I needed to turn off the television, not
read newspapers, just not be affected by words. I needed to get
back to what's real.''
   Sawyer said Maples avoided talking about specifics in her
relationship with Trump, about which she may have to testify in
litigation between the developer and his wife, Ivana.

HELLS ANGEL LECTURES ON NEWS ETHICS 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
Just before his talk the other night, George Christie Jr. noted that he had 
given a speech only once before: when he testified at his 
solicitation-of-murder trial three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Christie, president of the Ventura chapter of the Hells Angels motorcycle club, 
was acquitted of soliciting the murder of a government informant. The not 
guilty verdict was due in part to his ability to persuade a jury to trust him 
and ignore preconceived notions about the motorcycle gang. 
</P>
<P>
But Saturday night, Christie had the audience on his side even before he 
stepped to the microphone and addressed the Ventura College Press Club. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 aspiring journalists and professors cheered him when he spoke about 
the power of the media and the need for morality in journalism. They laughed 
when he talked about his run-ins with the law. They nodded in agreement when he 
warned about the dangers of sloppy journalism. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not the monsters that some people have created us to be," he said of 
the Hells Angels. "Preconceived images are certainly a problem that I've had to 
deal with." 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the college invites an editor or reporter to speak at the annual 
awards banquet, said Linda Wolf, office manager of the college newspaper. But 
this year, staff members decided they wanted someone who had been on the 
receiving end of news reports. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to hear about reality," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Christie has gotten both positive and negative coverage. The positive press 
came when he raised $3,000 from his fellow bikers and ran in the 1984 Olympic 
Torch Relay. The money was eventually directed to the Special Olympics in 
Pottstown, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
But Christie got less favorable headlines in 1987, when he was indicted and 
later acquitted on charges of hiring a hit man to kill an Arizona prison 
inmate. Federal authorities later acknowledged that they had faked the inmate's 
death to entrap Christie. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a black leather vest with the Hells Angels logo emblazoned across the 
back, Christie told his audience at the Doubletree Inn that the Angels had not 
made a conscious decision to improve their image. They did, however, want to be 
more accessible to journalists and the public, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Christie has been interviewed for newspaper articles, by Mike Wallace for "60 
Minutes" and by Regis Philbin for "Live With Regis and Kathie Lee." He said he 
has turned down interviews with "tabloid" television shows, because, they tend 
to exploit misery. 
</P>
<P>
Some journalists have portrayed him as an honest family man, the target of 
harassment by law enforcement officials, he said, while others painted him as 
an outlaw. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, Christie advised the aspiring journalists to be honest with the 
subject of their news reports and to live by their own sense of morality. "If 
you can look yourself in the mirror in the morning," he said, "you should be 
happy with yourself."

   Television viewers' memories, it seems, are short. Just a
few years ago Cybill Shepherd, while shilling for the beef
industry, declared she didn't eat meat. Seagram's Golden Wine
Cooler pitchman Bruce Willis was rumored in the tabloids to
have a drinking problem. And National Beef Council spokesman
James Garner underwent bypass surgery.
   Yet celebrity pitchmen these days are more popular among
TV viewers than they were before those embarrassing gaffes, a
new study shows. There's just one problem: While consumers
may approve of celebrities, they don't usually believe them.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   According to a new survey from Video Storyboard Tests
Inc., more TV viewers than ever approve of celebrity
endorsers. Consumers' attitudes toward celebrities "aren't so
negative anymore," says David Vadehra, Video Storyboard
president. "If your object is to get attention for your
brand, celebrities are becoming a better bet." Indeed, some
39% of those polled said celebrities make spots more
memorable, almost double the 20% of people who felt that way
in 1987.
   The survey, whose results will be released next week in
Video Storyboard's newsletter, Commercial Break, shows that
22% of those polled are "very positive" about celebrities, a
marked comeback from 1987. That year, thanks to endorser
embarrassments like the Shepherd and Willis flaps, a meager
16% of people were "very positive" about celebrity pitchmen.
   But advertisers shouldn't jump to sign up the cast of "The
Golden Girls" or the New York Knicks just yet. Even as
celebrities' ratings for approval and attention-getting
rebounded from their 1987 and 1988 lows, their marks for
persuasiveness and credibility continued to sag. Some 54% of
those polled believe celebrities are "just doing it for the
money" -- a figure that, while lower than the 64% who agreed
with the statement in 1988, nevertheless constitutes a clear
majority. And barely 15% of viewers said celebrities make
them more interested in a product.
   In short, while celebrities have become more likable, they
aren't persuading anyone to buy anything. Since celebrity
pitchmen do make spots more memorable, they make sense only
"if you're trying to get attention for your brand, but have
nothing new to say," as is the case with the soft drinks,
says Mr. Vadehra. If an advertiser does have something new to
say, he cautions, the message "will get lost" if a celebrity
delivers it.
   Ad executives, the people who have littered our airwaves
with celebrities and paid them millions for the privilege,
hasten to insist that other kinds of celebrity spots make
sense, too, as long as the celebrity fits the product.
   They cite "Murder, She Wrote" star Angela Lansbury, who
cracked the top-10 list of favorite celebrity endorsers
because of her appeal to the older viewers who use Bufferin.
They also point to Los Angeles Dodgers Coach Tommy Lasorda,
who jumped to third place on the top-10 favorite athletes
list because of his continuing beerbelly reduction with the
Ultra SlimFast diet.
   But marketers concede some match-ups don't make a whole
lot of sense. Perky morning-show host Kathie Lee Gifford was
a logical choice for Ultra SlimFast because she was trying to
lose post-baby pounds -- but she gets thumbs down for
endorsing Carnival Cruise Lines for no particular reason.
("Of course she makes sense," counters a Carnival spokesman.
"She's the all-American, girl-next-door type.") And
basketball superstar Michael Jordan has drawn criticism for
endorsing too many products, and for abruptly switching from
Coke to Gatorade.
   If the celebrity doesn't have any logical connection to
the product, "You watch the tube and say, `Who's kidding who?
Why are they paying him to say that?'" says Charles
Goldschmidt, chairman of Laurence, Charles, Free &amp; Lawson,
the agency that creates the Angela Lansbury ads for Bufferin.
By this time, adds Stephen Novick, an executive vice
president of Grey Advertising, which handles Ultra SlimFast,
"People are very wise to the fact that these are paid
endorsements."
   Why, then, the kinder view of celebrity pitchmen? Ad
executives say they are much more careful now about finding
the right fit. They learned their lesson the hard way in the
mid-1980s. Among other embarrassments at the time, Ringo
Starr plugged Sun Country wine coolers before reportedly
seeking treatment for alcohol abuse; Mike Tyson and Robin
Givens flirted for Diet Pepsi just before ending up in
divorce court; and Michael Jackson shilled for Pepsi even as
press reports alleged he didn't drink soda.
   These days, ad agencies try harder than ever to ferret out
any potentially unsavory tidbits about a celebrity. They also
"have gotten a lot more sophisticated about using
celebrities, rather than just exchanging a standup announcer
for a celebrity," says Laurence Charles' Mr. Goldschmidt.
   But to James Patterson, chairman of North American
operations for WPP Group's J. Walter Thompson Co., the survey
simply suggests that people's fondness for celebrities is
coming out of the closet. He insists that even more people
like celebrity-studded commercials than the survey shows.
   "People will always say, `No, they don't influence me,'"
says Mr. Patterson, whose agency creates the Candice Bergen
ads for Sprint and the Nuprin commercials starring tennis
stars Jimmy Connors and Michael Chang. "People like
celebrities. It's too embarrassing to admit."

   Scientology Takes On IRS
                                                                                                       

   The Church of Scientology, which is already bashing Time
magazine in full-page salvos, has taken its long-running
squabble with the Internal Revenue Service public, running
full-page ads in USA Today to enlist anti-IRS allies.
   An ad that ran yesterday shows a screaming young girl and
carries the headline, "Don't you kill my Daddy]" Ad copy
discusses a situation in which "a band of armed IRS agents"
allegedly tried to choke an Idaho man, as well as other
alleged IRS abuses.
   Yesterday's ad also had a toll-free number and coupon for
the National Coalition of IRS Whistleblowers, which claims to
be an independent group but gets financial support from the
Scientologists. The ad encourages readers to send for a
booklet on "How to Protect Your Rights as a Taxpayer,"
published by the Church of Scientology. Similar ads are
scheduled to run today and Friday, and others may run in the
future.
   The Scientologists reportedly have been the target of a
massive IRS investigation for several years over the group's
tax-exempt status. In 1989, the Supreme Court upheld an IRS
decision that contributions to the Church of Scientology in
exchange for so-called auditing and training services aren't
tax deductible. An IRS spokeswoman didn't return several
phone calls seeking comment on the agency's dispute with the
group.
   Heber Jentzsch, president of the Church of Scientology
International, said the group currently has 80 lawsuits
pending against the IRS. But he played down the
Scientologists' own feud as a reason for the ads. "Their
power has been unchecked for such a long time," he said.
"It's an agency that really is out of control."

   King Leaves AC&amp;R
                                                                                                       

   Patrick King, chairman and chief executive officer of
AC&amp;R's Western operations and president of the agency, left
the shop in a dispute.
   Mr. King, 56 years old, said he was "forced out because I
found the situation intolerable." He said AC&amp;R, a unit of
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co., had broken "several longstanding
commitments and obligations regarding what I do, for how
long, and how much." He also cited age discrimination by the
agency.
   But AC&amp;R Vice Chairman Harry Koenig said the agency had
suggested Mr. King's compensation be cut "to reflect a lower
volume of business for which he's responsible. Rather than
accept a reduction in compensation, he chose to resign." Mr.
Koenig said the agency doesn't plan to name a successor; he
said the Los Angeles office will continue to be run by
general manager Don Cunningham, while the agency's Irvine,
Calif., office, known as Cochran Chase, Livingston will
continue to be headed by its president, Lynn Livingston.
   Mr. King's departure, first reported yesterday in Adweek
magazine, comes shortly after another group of AC&amp;R
executives, including former chief creative officer Louis
Miano, filed age-discrimination suits against the agency.

   APPLIANCES: Sunbeam-Oster Household Products Group named
Cramer-Krasselt, Milwaukee, to handle the creative portion of
its $6 million account. Media buying was assigned to two
Chicago media-buying services: Advertising Associates, and
Kelley, Scott, Madison. The account switch at the marketer of
small kitchen appliances, a unit of New York investment firm
Japonica Partners, follows last year's merger of Sunbeam
Appliance and Oster Housewares; Tatham/RSCG, Chicago, had
handled Sunbeam's advertising, while Hoffman York &amp; Compton,
Milwaukee, had handled Oster.
                                                                                                       

   INSURANCE: Nationwide Mutual Insurance pulled its $11
million ad account from Ogilvy &amp; Mather, New York, and
awarded it to Ketchum Advertising, Pittsburgh. Ogilvy, a unit
of WPP Group, had handled the Columbus, Ohio, insurer's
account since 1963.
                                                                                                       

   MAGAZINE: Family Circle magazine awarded its ad account to
Kirshenbaum &amp; Bond, New York. Billings weren't disclosed.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising, the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. unit
that handled the account since 1987, resigned, saying the
business had been inactive recently. Lifestyle Marketing
Group, another Saatchi unit, will continue to handle sales
promotion for the women's magazine, which is published by the
New York Times Co. Magazine Group.

   Last spring, Jeff Sagansky, CBS's chief programmer, made
an audacious prediction for the network that had been in the
ratings basement since 1987: "I think we have the schedule
and pieces to be No. 1," he said, "and I'll be disappointed
if we're not."
   But after getting off to an especially strong start, CBS
has run into a patch of trouble. It indeed took the No. 1
spot as the TV season began in September, but the lead it
enjoyed, a comfortable 2.2 ratings points ahead of NBC in
total households, has virtually evaporated. CBS remains No. 3
in the key category of women 18 to 49 years old.
                                                                                                       

   "CBS was supposed to be the Cinderella story of 1991,"
says Jon Mandel, senior vice president at Grey Advertising.
"But the slipper doesn't fit."
   Adds Betsy Frank, senior vice president at Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi: "There's no doubt that CBS started out strongly, but
has run into problems with its regular series programming
more recently."
   Of the seven new shows CBS introduced this fall, and hyped
in massive promotions in the World Series, only one survives,
and barely at that: "Brooklyn Bridge," a sweet, well-written
and critically praised half-hour show about an extended
family in the 1950s. The network has jettisoned its entire
Friday lineup, including a variety series from veteran
comedian Carol Burnett that was plagued by a lack of focus
and quickly bombed. A show that wrapped itself in the quality
drama moniker, "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill," has been placed
on hiatus.
   Even an old reliable has stalled. "Knots Landing," the
12-year-old workhorse of prime time soaps, shut production
briefly this fall when the plot lines became complicated and
it seemed to lose its way. Ratings dropped and it is being
retooled. CBS says the show's absence won't be felt by the
audience because of special pre-emptions.
   Mr. Sagansky's bold confidence, it turns out, was partly
misplaced. CBS has, indeed, leapfrogged from worst to first,
and it remains the strongest candidate to finish No. 1 in the
household ratings race for the 1991-92 season that ends in
April. That would steal the ratings crown from General
Electric Co.'s NBC network, which had been the No. 1 network
for six years.
   But CBS is achieving its winning status despite its
schedule, not because of it. Remove the seven-game,
nail-biting World Series from its statistics and CBS is ahead
of NBC by only six-tenths of a ratings point. (Overall,
including the baseball playoffs, NBC is only one rating point
behind CBS in households. One point represents 1% of the
nation's 92.1 million television households.)
   Of course, CBS still has Monday, with "Murphy Brown" and
the offbeat and endearing "Northern Exposure," making it
arguably the best night of television, supplanting NBC's
once-untouchable lineup on Thursday nights. Marc Goldstein,
executive vice president at Lintas USA, suggests that some of
the established Monday night hits ought to be moved out of
that "safe" time period, so that they can "serve as a lead-in
for new shows."
   Peter Tortorici, CBS's No. 2 programming executive, says
there is "no question" that CBS has stumbled recently, "but
we're very pleased at how far we've gotten and how fast we've
gotten there." Mr. Tortorici says pundits of the television
industry predicted two years ago that CBS's climb from the
cellar would take five years.
   Some of CBS's misfortunes, as well, were the result of
off-screen tragedies. Two highly promising series, "Us" and
"The Royal Family," were dropped because of the deaths of the
shows' stars, Michael Landon and Redd Foxx, respectively. A
reformulated "Royal Family" is currently under production.
   But CBS's immediate midseason replacements aren't shaping
up as blockbusters, either, say advertisers. CBS has picked
up "Davis Rules," a sitcom that sat on the shelf and was
never even a moderate hit for rival ABC, a unit of Capital
Cities/ABC Inc. But it carries the cachet of coming from the
team of Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner, producers of ABC's
"Roseanne" and NBC's "The Cosby Show." CBS is talking to the
team about developing an entirely new show for the network.
   And there are two action/adventure retreads, "Tequila &amp;
Bonetti," featuring a dog whose thoughts are heard by the
audience, and "Hearts Are Wild," from veteran producer Aaron
Spelling. The show is set in a Las Vegas casino. But only
"Street Stories," from CBS News, has positive word of mouth.
The performance of CBS's biggest midseason show -- the XVI
Winter Olympic Games from Feb. 8-23 -- may be the hardest to
forecast.
   But CBS's Mr. Tortorici says not to worry: "The creative
community is responding to us." Indeed, an impressive bullpen
is warming for a premiere in the spring or summer, including
new projects from Bob Newhart, and from Dick Wolf, creator of
the hit NBC show, "Law &amp; Order."
   The network also has two animated shows in the works for
prime time. "The Fish Police" will begin to air mid-season.
"Family Dog," from Steven Spielberg and "Batman" director Tim
Burton, has been delayed. "The dog is going to be on," Mr.
Tortorici says of the show, which has had production
problems. "It's just a question of when. At least only one
half-hour is going to the dogs, not the whole schedule."

   Controversy at People
                                                                                                       

   A San Francisco health group is charging People magazine
with censorship because the magazine rejected an ad for early
HIV testing that showed two men kissing.
   The black-and-white full-page ad, headlined "Sex Is Good,"
shows a heterosexual and a homosexual couple kissing, with
text explaining the importance of getting tested for HIV. The
San Francisco AIDS Foundation has been trying to place it as
a discounted public service announcement in People's San
Francisco edition and a second magazine, Image, a regional
Sunday magazine in San Francisco, for three weeks.
   Image said yesterday it would accept the ad. People said
it wouldn't run the ads because it showed two men kissing and
because it showed a woman's bare breast. After the Foundation
airbrushed the woman's breast from the ad, People still
rejected it.
   "Standards have changed," said Scott Oswald, spokesman for
the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, whose group is
pressuring People to accept the ad. "We feel the industry
needs to adapt to the new climate." A spokeswoman for People,
a unit of Time Warner Inc., said publisher Ann Moore rejected
it because the headline made it inappropriate for a
"family-type" magazine. "She said she never even got to the
picture," the spokeswoman said.

   NEW TWIST: Singer Chubby Checker filed suit against
McDonald's Corp.'s Canadian unit and its Toronto ad agency,
Vickers &amp; Benson, over the jingle used in a regional
commercial promoting McTwist French Fries last month. Mr.
Checker is seeking damages of 17 million Canadian dollars
(US$14.8 million), alleging the agency hired a Chubby Checker
impersonator to sing "The Twist" without seeking Mr.
Checker's permission. A spokesman for Vickers &amp; Benson said
the agency obtained the rights to the song from the man who
first recorded it, Hank Ballard. "We didn't misappropriate
the personality or the performance of Mr. Checker," he said.
                                                                                                       

   SLIM FAST: Thompson Medical's Slim Fast Foods is dropping
61 million eight-page inserts into newspapers on Super Bowl
Sunday to introduce 30 new products in its weight-control
line. The company also is breaking a new round of
commercials, via Grey Advertising, starring veteran Slim Fast
product pluggers Tommy Lasorda and Kathie Lee Gifford.
                                                                                                       

   WHO'S NEWS: Saatchi &amp; Saatchi said Michael Jeary, Saatchi
&amp; Saatchi Advertising's executive vice president in charge of
new business, was named president and chief operating officer
of the agency's San Francisco office. He succeeds Michael
Gold, who is returning to the U.K., according to the company.

Here are responses to the Aug. 19 question: How do you rate daytime's talk 
shows? 
</P>
<P>
I watch "Live With Regis and Kathie Lee" every day. I occasionally see "The 
Oprah Winfrey Show."

Phil Donahue is caring, warm and well-spoken. He is fair to all parties when 
dealing with serious topics and also very attractive. 
</P>
<P>
Oprah Winfrey does a good job with the interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Rivers doesn't speak well and laughs too often at her own jokes.

We don't like Bryant "Grumble" and can't stand Deborah Norville of NBC's

<LEADPARA>  JOAN Rivers gives Liz Taylor's marriage six months tops.;   "Larry Fortensky
will wake up one morning and forget who owns the mansion," Rivers predicts in
a recent telephone interview.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  RIVERS TAKES A LICKING, AND KEEPS ON TALKING  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Personality  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     But then, Rivers has always set her comedy claws for the legendary Taylor.
Remember those insulting fat jokes Rivers spewed out a few years ago? "Liz
stands in front of a microwave and yells, 'Hurry!' ";   For the record (or
bridal registry), Rivers says she sent the newlyweds a gift -- a wok, not
electric. "Larry can fire it up," Rivers says of the man who's 20 years
younger than Taylor.;   Rivers seldom misses her mark. But lately, Liz and
Larry aside, she's been busy directing her deprecating style of humor full
blast at none other than Joan Molinsky (maiden name) Rivers.;   Not that
Rivers hasn't always joked about her lack of sex appeal, her fat thighs, her
flat chest -- you name it. "I was petting with a boy, and his hand went to
sleep.";   But lately her humor has cut deeper; her self-revelations are,
well, asking for love.;   Here's what has been going on with the 58-year-old
talk show host:;   Plastic surgeon's dream;   (check) Rivers was on the cover
of last week's TV Guide as a testament to the wonders of cosmetic surgery in
an article titled, "Can We Tuck?" -- a pun on Rivers' trademark invite, "Can
We Talk?";   To TV Guide, she confesses having had a face-lift, a nose job, a
tummy tuck and thigh vacuuming. On her own talk show last week, she took her
audience (via taped footage) into the operating room for her latest
wrinkle-erasing adventure. Unquestionably, Rivers now has one of the tightest
faces on the tube.;   (check) She wept on Donahue last week, when recalling
her husband's suicide. Edgar Rosenberg, who suffered from depression, took an
overdose of pills in 1987, the same year Rivers was axed from her Fox
late-night talk show. She told Phil Donahue that the same night Edgar died she
would have gone from mortuary to stage if she could have, because "there I
could have washed my head" concentrating on her comedy. Donahue called Rivers'
professional obsession, where she once only felt happy in the spotlight,
"screwy" and "very unhealthy.";   (check) And Rivers, skinny now but fat as a
child ("I was a Delta Burke with hair bows"), spills loads of insecurities in
a just-released book, "Still Talking" (Random House, $21). It's a volume of
catharsis by a woman who's a comedian, author, actor, playwright,
screenwriter, movie director, nightclub performer, talk-show host and, most
important (she says), mother to Melissa, age 22.;   Brutal self-exposure;  
She writes that after Edgar's death, there was no husband to pick up the
check. At a dinner at Elaine's in New York City, she sat with two
screenwriters. "I told myself it was OK to pay because it was business, but I
also saw the scene with acid clarity -- two witty, young gay men watching the
old star pick up the check. I wondered, 'Is this what the rest of my life will
be?' ";   Why so brutally forthcoming? Rivers says that this self-exposure is
proving good for her and others.;   She has survived tragedies, having a
husband who killed himself and being fired from Fox. And she's glad to share
the misery with her fans, sprinkled with jokes, of course.;   On the
syndicated talk show totem pole, "The Joan Rivers Show" ranks below the other
powerhouses, "The Oprah Winfrey Show," "Donahue," "Geraldo," "The Arsenio Hall
Show," "Live with Regis &amp; Kathie Lee" and "Sally Jessy Raphael.";   Having
pocketed a surprise daytime Emmy (beating out Phil, Oprah and Sally) after her
first year of "The Joan Rivers Show," Rivers says she wants to keep her show
just the way it is. "We are more gossipy," she says when asked about the fresh
faces of Jenny Jones, Maury Povich and Chuck Woolery.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  SPORT; LETTER; HOLIDAY  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Happy Thanksgiving, and thanks for the memories:;    MY favorite Thanksgiving
Day memory involves Willie Wilson of the Oakland A's. We both grew up in
Summit, N.J. Willie Wilson was the star of our high school football team.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  THANKS FOR THE (SPORTS) MEMORIES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     On Thanksgiving Day, we always played our archrival, New Providence. Willie
took the opening kick all the way for a touchdown. But there was a penalty, so
it was called back. They kicked off again. Willie returned it all the way for
a touchdown again.;   Obviously, we proceeded to stomp New Providence for
bragging rights that year.;   Bob Schoettle, Los Altos; (hbox);   Clint
Longley came in for Roger Staubach and threw a long touchdown pass to win the
game.;   Sean Burris, San Jose; (hbox);   I never played on Thanksgiving Day.
But I've always watched the games. In fact, that's how my young son got his
name.;   Cody Risien was playing for the Cleveland Browns against the Detroit
Lions. My wife, Kathie, was in the kitchen, cooking the turkey. We hadn't been
able to agree on a name for the baby, but then I yelled in, "How 'bout Cody?"
And she yelled back, "I love it!" It's kind of strange, but our Cody was born
on the same day as Cody Risien. And Cody Reisen retired from football on the
same day our son was born.; Frank Gifford, Greenwich, Conn.; (hbox);   My
favorite Thanksgiving Day memory was in 1975, when Los Gatos High beat
Campbell 32-26 on the last drive of the game to keep intact a 10-0 record.;  
Mike Couchee, Los Gatos; (hbox);   I was the captain of the San Jose High
School football team in 1938, and our Thanksgiving Day game was way up in
Eureka. We went up on the train, got out on the field and realized we were
nine miles from nowhere with nobody to cheer us on. We were getting ready for
the game when a marvelous thing happened. My mother and dad had driven up from
San Jose. They'd driven all night and they arrived just before kickoff, and we
had a rooting section, Mom and Dad.;   Dick Tripp, San Jose; (hbox);   When
you spend the holidays in winter ball, you never forget that. It's an
emotional experience for any American. Strange, sad. I was playing in the
Dominican in 1970 or '71 -- me, Gene Tenace, Gene Clines, a few other guys. We
didn't really want to go to a restaurant for Thanksgiving dinner, so went to
the beach and just kinda had our own little party.;   Tony La Russa, Danville;
(hbox);   I witnessed a Thanksgiving Day game in Detroit, Mich., in the late
1930s. It was the Lions and the Packers, and Dutch Clark drop-kicked the last
field goal in NFL history, I believe. Detroit had Ace Gutowsky. The Packers I
can remember were Don Hutson and Cecil Isbell.;    Max Schultz, San Jose;
(hbox);   I saw two of the best college football games of all time -- the
Oklahoma-Nebraska game in 1971 and the game Doug Flutie won for Boston College
against Miami. They both were terrific games, from start to finish. It's
interesting that the Boston College-Miami isn't really remembered that way;
it's remembered more as the Flutie Game. But it was a great game, even before
Doug threw that Hail Mary pass to win it.;   Brent Musburger, Weston, Conn.;
(hbox);   I'm the former football coach at San Jose High School. I was head
coach in 1984 when San Jose High won the Big Bone 15-14. I think the most
exciting moment came when one of my players, during "The Star-Spangled
Banner," came up, put his arm around me and said, "Coach, what do you think
they're doing in Russia today?";   Gene Dawson, San Jose; (hbox);   I played
on Thanksgiving Day every year for 15 years. Everyone talks about the rivalry
Detroit had with the Packers, and those were good games. That game in 1962, we
must have sacked Bart Starr 13 or 14 times.;   But one game that stands out
was in 1970. We played the Raiders. They were on that Blanda Streak, where
George was coming in and winning all those games at the end. The Raiders
scored two touchdowns in the first three minutes. Fred Biletnikoff burned Lem
Barney for a quick touchdown, and we fumbled on the kickoff and Biletnikoff
burned Lem again. They were up 14-0. They were celebrating, really going crazy
about it. We came back and ended up winning 28-14.;   Wayne Walker, San
Francisco; (hbox);   An early childhood memory is of being at the famous
Harvard-Yale 29-29 tie when Harvard came from behind to tie it at the end.;  
I was probably about 9. I had never been to a football game before. The thing
that astonished me was right after the game was over, as we were leaving the
stands, the Harvard Crimson had printed in the newspaper: Harvard Comes from
Behind to Tie 29-29!;   David Abramson, Cupertino; (hbox);   I'll never forget
the time all these people chipped in to write my column for me. I'm giving
thanks at this moment. Now, pass the potatoes.; Bud Geracie, San Jose Mercury

CRITICAL 'NUNS' REVIEW ANGERED FOX, SISKEL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Film critic Gene Siskel said today 20th Century Fox suggested that he and 
fellow critic Roger Ebert "went over the edge" in criticizing the Fox film 
"Nuns on the Run." 
</P>
<P>
The studio has indefinitely banned the pair from screening previews of its 
films after they panned the movie. 
</P>
<P>
"They're accusing us of not having a sense of humor and I'm accusing them of 
not having one," Siskel said on the CBS-TV program "CBS This Morning." "They 
are suggesting we went over the edge, but we did take the film seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Siskel, a Chicago Tribune film critic, and Ebert, a film critic for the Chicago 
Sun-Times, were guests last week on the "Live -- Regis &amp; Kathie Lee" 
television show and panned the Fox movie by saying it didn't contain a single 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can find a laugh in this film, I'll give you a shiny new dime for every 
one," Ebert said. "And you'll not become a rich man." 
</P>
<P>
What really caused the Fox fur to fly was when Ebert held up a newspaper ad for 
the movie with a quote from the Village Voice calling it "the funniest 
anti-clerical transvestite comedy of the decade." 
</P>
<P>
"I know you're a very clever man -- I wonder if you can spot the fallacy," 
Ebert quipped. 
</P>
<P>
"How many others have there been?" Siskel asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, this is 1990. How many other transvestite, anti-clerical comedies have 
there been so far in this decade?" Ebert continued. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure the (Village Voice) critic meant it as a joke and it was a launching 
point for our discussion of the film," Siskel said. 
</P>
<P>
Siskel and Ebert said they would still review Fox movies on their syndicated 
television show. The only difference will be that viewers will not be able to 
see the film clips. 
</P>
<P>
What will they do without the clips? 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we'll act out the parts," Siskel said.

They ought to penalize Andre Agassi by making him play tennis tournaments 
instead of banning him. . . . 
</P>
<P>
With all the quarterbacks going down these days, what was the purpose of 
keeping Joe Montana on the field in the closing moments of a game San Francisco 
was winning, 26-10? . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' 2-6 home record isn't the worst in club history. They were 0-7 at the 
Coliseum in 1962, the year they went 1-12-1 and Bob Waterfield was replaced by 
Harland Svare in midseason. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Wonder how much those Georgia Frontiere autographs will be worth in five years. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
I still don't know how Henry Ellard held onto the ball after taking a Ronnie 
Lott kind of shot from Dave Waymer. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Rams and 49ers proved that NFL games can last 3 hours 8 minutes even 
without a lot of instant replay reviews. . . . 
</P>
<P>
One reason it's easier to win on the road in football than in basketball is 
that football officials aren't swayed so much by crowds. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The way Frank Gifford talks about Southern California, you would never know 
that he was raised in Bakersfield and played for USC. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If you're looking for a quiet way to celebrate New Year's Eve, tune in the 
Rams-New Orleans game on ABC. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders should give their "Commitment to Excellence" award to Howie Long 
for the first time. . . . 
</P>
<P>
No list of NFL coach-of-the-year candidates would be complete without Art 
Shell. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tim Belcher is expected to be at full strength for the opening of the season, 
meaning the Dodgers will be less tempted to rush Orel Hershiser back into the 
starting rotation. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Just how good is Greg Smith, the young second baseman the Dodgers acquired from 
the Chicago Cubs? Some people think he's ready to start for most teams that 
don't have Ryne Sandberg. 
</P>
<P>
But Baseball America rated him only the seventh-best prospect in the Cub farm 
system. . . . 
</P>
<P>
New Dodger publicist Jay Lucas has named his temporary office in a trailer, 
"Deals on Wheels." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Another Brett Butler plus is that he hit nearly as well against left-handed 
pitching (.302) as against right-handed (.313) last season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Something is wrong with the system when Ken Griffey is making more money than 
Ken Griffey Jr. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: Dan Reeves and sportscaster Ed Arnold. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Nevada Las Vegas and Princeton, who play tonight, have at least two things in 
common: They're unbeaten and nationally ranked. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas is the only school that has both men's and women's basketball teams 
ranked in the top 10. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Arnold, president and co-owner of Los Alamitos Race Course, is a finalist 
for the Proximity Award, which recognizes contributions made to harness racing. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Lee Trevino's decision to leave NBC for the senior golf tour was much wiser 
than John Brodie's. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The bad news out of those Coliseum remodeling discussions was that the Raiders 
and Trojans probably will have to play somewhere else for two seasons instead 
of one. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim is closer to landing an indoor soccer franchise than a hockey or 
basketball team. . . .

<LEADPARA>  Once upon a time, in a faraway land called Texas, two men owned a bank called
Guaranty Federal Savings &amp; Loan.;   The two men paid themselves lots of money
and loaned other people lots of money.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  CORPORATE TAX BREAKS SQUEEZE INDIVIDUALS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  AMERICA -- What went wrong?; Third of four parts  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     But they wanted to make even more money, so they met with people from a
distant kingdom with very tall buildings, called Wall Street.;   They liked
the Wall Street people very much and decided to buy pieces of paper from them
called bonds.;   They bought and sold the pieces of paper over and over
again.;   When they made money doing this, they kept it for themselves.;  
When they wanted even more money to build castles of sand in yet another
kingdom, they just took it out of the bank.;   This worked until the bank ran
out of money.;   Then some government people came to Dallas to look into the
way the men ran the bank. These people called the two men crooks and put them
in a building with bars on the windows.;   The government people took the bank
away from the two men and sold it to a big Texas company.;   Then the
government people gave the big Texas company lots of money so the bank
wouldn't run out again. The government people also gave the company a very
special magic wand that came with the bank.;   The wand is called NOL, and it
is wondrous.;   It makes taxes disappear.;   By waving the wand, the big Texas
company that now owns the bank can make taxes vanish for years and years and
years. The money it used to pay in taxes it can now keep for itself.;   The
wand invented by the government people is available only to a select few.;  
You, for example, can't have one.;   But individual taxpayers pay for the
wands that do get passed around.;   NOL stands for net operating loss
deduction, a tax break that allows corporations to reduce this year's taxes --
and next year's taxes, and so on -- because of money lost last year.;  
Through the 1980s, the NOL enabled corporations to escape payment of more than
$100 billion in income taxes.;   But it is not the largest of the many
write-offs available to businesses.;   The deduction that corporations can
take for interest paid on borrowed money costs the government nearly $100
billion in a single year, dwarfing the amount that NOLs diverted from the U.S.
Treasury.;   Ballooning; deductions;   The deduction for interest on corporate
debt has long been part of the U.S. tax code, but in the unchecked frenzy of
the 1980s, as merger-minded companies took on enormous debt, it ballooned.;  
A catalog of other deductions runs to many more billions in lost tax revenue.;
  All these are reasons that individual taxpayers are picking up an
ever-larger share of the U.S. tax burden, while corporations pay a steadily
decreasing share -- corporations such as Temple-Inland Inc., the big Texas
company that got the magic wand when it acquired Guaranty Federal Savings &amp;
Loan Association of Dallas.;   That's the savings and loan run by the two men
from Dallas, Paul Sau-Ki Cheng and Simon Edward Heath. The Wall Street people
were from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. Inc.;   By the
time Cheng and Heath were finished, Guaranty Federal was insolvent. Federal
regulators seized it in 1988 and turned it over to Temple-Inland.;   As a
result of what the government has charged was "fraudulent bond-trading"
transactions, along with illegal dealings that led to the convictions of Cheng
and Heath, the savings and loan ended up with a net operating loss of more
than $300 million.;   Now, and for many years to come, Temple-Inland can use
those old losses to reduce its taxable income and avoid paying taxes.;   What
makes the Guaranty Federal story so remarkable is this:;   First, taxpayers
are paying, and will continue to pay, to bail out the failed savings and loan
-- that is, to restore depositors' money.;   Then, taxpayers will pay yet
again, to make up for the taxes Temple-Inland won't be paying because its
profits can be offset by the savings and loan losses incurred years earlier by
two men now in jail.;   Direct and; indirect costs;   Direct cost of the
bailout: an estimated $3.9 billion, which will go straight from you and other
taxpayers to Guaranty Federal and its new owner, Temple-Inland.;   Indirect
cost: an estimated $590 million in lost tax revenue. That missing revenue will
be made up by you and other taxpayers -- or added to the federal debt, in
which case you'll pay the interest charges on it.;   Guaranty is only one of
hundreds of savings and loans that taxpayers are rescuing, Temple-Inland only
one of scores of companies profiting from the bailout. The ultimate cost to
taxpayers: a half-trillion dollars.;   The people responsible for this bailout
are in Washington -- a succession of Congresses and presidents, administrators
and regulators, Democrats and Republicans -- who write the government rule
book.;   The rule book is the accumulation of laws and regulations that
provides the framework for the country's economy, affecting everything from
the taxes you pay to whether your job is moved to Mexico.;   All this has
happened through:;   (check) The enactment of laws and regulations crafted for
the benefit of special interests.;   (check) The failure to enact laws and
regulations that would ensure a level economic playing field for everyone.;  
(check) The refusal to rescind long-outdated laws that favor selected
interests.;   Cruising; tax-free;   Some people profit handsomely from this
system. Like Ted Arison of Miami Beach, Fla., and Tel Aviv.;   You may not
recognize the name. But you've probably seen the TV commercials for his
company -- the ones starring Kathie Lee Gifford who, in assorted costumes,
dances and sings across the decks of the "fun ships" of Carnival Cruise Lines
Inc.;   From 1985 to 1988, Carnival Cruise Lines produced total profits of
$502.5 million.;   The corporate income tax rate during those years ranged
from 46 percent in 1985 to 34 percent in 1988, meaning that Carnival paid
about $200 million in federal taxes.;   Right?;   Wrong.;   Carnival paid not
a cent in U.S. corporate income taxes on that half-billion dollars in profits.
Its corporate tax rate was zero.;   That's because Carnival benefits from a
government rule book that exempts shipping companies incorporated in foreign
countries from having to pay U.S. income taxes.;   Although Carnival's offices
are in Miami, and its Caribbean-bound ships leave from Miami, the company is
incorporated in Panama. Its subsidiaries are organized in Liberia, the
Bahamas, the British Virgin Islands and the Netherlands Antilles.;  
Carnival's situation is not unique. Hundreds of corporations have eliminated
or drastically reduced their federal tax bills through similar
special-interest tax laws.;   Your tax dollars; as part of two pies;   To
understand why you pay the taxes you do, think of your paycheck as part of two
government pies.;   The first pie is made up of total income taxes collected
from all individuals and all corporations. The amount that you pay as an
individual is determined, in part, by the amount Congress says companies
should pay.;   If Congress collects more from businesses, you pay less. If
Congress says some businesses may pay reduced taxes, you pay more.;   The
second pie is made up of combined income taxes and Social Security taxes
collected from individuals. The amount that you pay if you earn, say, between
$25,000 and $35,000 is determined, in part, by the amount that Congress says
people who earn more than $100,000 should pay.;   If Congress collects more
from people at the top, you pay less. If Congress says people at the top
should pay less, you pay more.;   Now consider a few statistics drawn from a
Philadelphia Inquirer analysis of a half-century of government tax and
economic data. They will explain why you are accounting for an ever-larger
slice of the two government pies.;   (check) During the 1950s, when more
Americans than ever attained middle-class status, the federal government
collected $478 billion in combined individual and corporate income taxes in
the decade.;   Of that, corporations paid 39 percent, individuals 61 percent.;
  During the 1980s, individual and corporate income tax collections soared to
$4 trillion.;   Of that $4 trillion, the corporate share dwindled to 17
percent, the individual share swelled to 83 percent.;   (check) Corporations
have succeeded in reducing their share of the tax burden, in part through a
provision in the government rule book that permits a virtually unlimited
deduction for interest on debt.;   During middle-class America's golden years,
the 1950s, corporations paid $44 billion in interest on borrowed money and
more than four times that amount, $185 billion, in federal income taxes.;   By
the 1980s, an era of frenetic corporate borrowing and unabashed congressional
support of special interests, that pattern was reversed.;   (check) Congress
has written the government rule book so that Social Security taxes consume an
ever-larger share of the weekly paychecks of low- and middle-income Americans,
while the affluent are better able to cope with those increases.;   As a
consequence, the average family or individual has less money to spend for
housing, food, clothing and education.;   Long ago, businesses borrowed money
to build plants, to buy equipment and to make new products, thereby creating
jobs. In those times, there was a certain logic to allowing companies to write
off the full interest expense on their tax returns.;   But in the 1980s, the
interest deduction became an instrument to dismantle the United States -- not
to build it.;   Businesses borrowed money to raid other businesses and sell
off their assets. That led to the closing of factories, the elimination of
middle-income jobs and the paying of astronomical sums to owners, investors
and corporate executives who brought it all about.;   All this was subsidized
by taxpayers -- through the deduction for interest payments.;   Beyond
corporations that do not pay their fair share of taxes because of a
preferential government rule book, there is yet a darker side to the story,
one with bleaker implications for the American middle class.;   No new jobs;
from debt frenzy; The expenditure of those hundreds of millions of dollars
borrowed, and the millions of dollars that were -- and will be -- paid in
interest did not create a single new job.;   Consider two companies: USG
Corp., better known by its former name, United States Gypsum Co., and
Burlington Holdings Inc. USG manufactures and markets building products and is
the country's largest producer of gypsum wallboard. Burlington makes an array
of textiles, including fabrics for clothing, carpets and upholstery.;   Over
the past two years, USG reported total operating income of $487 million.;  
Interest expenses totaled $589 million, wiping out all of the operating
income.;   Federal income taxes paid: zero.;   Over the past two years,
Burlington reported operating income of $389 million.;   Interest expenses
totaled $504 million, wiping out all of the operating income.;   Federal
income taxes paid: zero.;   To meet their interest payments, USG and
Burlington, whose debt grew out of the corporate takeover wars encouraged by
the government rule book, did what so much of the rest of corporate America
has done in the same situation:;   They slashed their workforces. And they
received a tax break for doing it.;   What's more, the very deduction that
wipes out tax bills now -- the interest write-off -- creates yet another
tax-avoidance mechanism to shelter future profits for USG, Burlington Holdings
and many others: the net operating loss deduction -- the magic wand that makes
taxes disappear.  </TEXT>

FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Baillie Gifford to manage Provincial's
investments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Baillie Gifford, the Edinburgh investment management company, is to manage
the stock market investments of Provincial Insurance, the privately-owned
general insurance company.
The Pounds 420m of funds will bring the total managed by Baillie Gifford to
Pounds 5bn, reinforcing its position as the largest Scottish fund manager
and one of the leading independent fund managers in Britain.
Provincial, based at Kendal, Cumbria, hived off its life assurance and unit
trust business to Prolific in 1988 to concentrate on general insurance.
Baillie Gifford is to manage Provincial's insurance reserves and general
funds, which were managed by Prolific. Last year Baillie Gifford won the
contract to manage Provincial's company pension fund.
The Provincial fund will be the largest single block of money under
management at Baillie Gifford after Scottish Mortgage, its biggest
investment trust.

   Television audiences may get talked to death this season.
   Seven new daily talk shows are poised to go on the air,
joining a field already crowded with gabfest hosts known by
their first names: Oprah, Geraldo, Arsenio, Sally, Joan,
Regis and Kathie Lee. Not to mention Phil Donahue, the
granddaddy of all the talkers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   TV producers, stung by the failure of four game shows and
three "reality-based" programs introduced in syndication this
year, say they expect to fare better with talk shows. The
programs "have had the greatest degree of success as a
program type in the past several years," says Mitchell
Praver, a vice president at Katz Continental Television, a
station consultant. "The worst performing talk show does
better than the best performing of the new game shows."
   Those vying for spots include an entertainment-oriented
show starring Chuck Woolery, the snickering host of the
popular "Love Connection" video dating show; a hot-topic
program starring Maury Povich, the eyebrow-arching former
anchor of the tabloid ratings giant "A Current Affair"; and a
female-oriented show starring Jenny Jones, a comedian who
performs a nightclub stand-up routine for women.
   There's also a single-topic program starring Sarah
Purcell, who starred on "Real People." And former President
Reagan's son Ron is weighing in with a late-night talk show.
   Despite the talk shows' cost of between $150,000 and
$300,000 a week, producers say they're worth it. "Unlike
{less-expensive} game shows or flash-in-the-pan concepts,
these shows tend to become franchises that last a decade,"
says Scott Carlin, senior vice president of Warner Bros.
Domestic Television, a unit of Time Warner Inc., which is
distributing "Jenny Jones."
   But not all of the new entries will even get on the air,
let alone last long enough to build a franchise. "We've
already reached the saturation point," says Richard A.
Kurlander, vice president and director of programming at
Petry Television, a station consulting firm.
   For example, "Realities," a new show from Viacom Inc., is
already having problems despite the presence of David
Hartman, the popular former co-anchor of the ABC network's
"Good Morning America." The pilot, five pre-taped pieces not
unlike prime-time magazine shows such as "60 Minutes" and
"20/20," was poorly received by stations, so Viacom is
retooling the show.
   The shakeout in talk shows likely will occur before the
National Association of Television Program Executives' annual
convention scheduled to begin Jan. 14 in New Orleans. The
convention is a glitzy high-technology flea market where
producers of talk, game and reality-based shows entering
syndication peddle their goods to individual stations.
   For example, if "Realities" isn't sold to at least 20
stations before NATPE, it would be "difficult" to continue
with the project, concedes Michael Gerber, president of
first-run syndication at Viacom.
   Still, independent stations and network affiliates are
eager to use talk shows to fill programming gaps. Late last
week, for example, the NBC network said it was giving back
one hour of the daytime schedule to its 209 affiliates. The
sudden move by NBC, a General Electric Co. unit, means most
stations will seek to fill the 60 minutes with syndicated
programming.
   Jerry Dalrymple, general manager of KWTV, the CBS
affiliate in Oklahoma City, says the new glut of talk shows
isn't unexpected. "What are syndicators going to do?" he
asks. "People last year tried new high-tech game shows and
other things to beat {ratings giants} `Wheel of Fortune,'
`Jeopardy]' and Oprah, but nothing happened," he says.
   Indeed, the rookie game shows "Trump Card," "The
Challengers," "Quiz Kids Challenge" and "Tic Tac Dough" all
bombed. Reality-based shows fared no better: "Preview: First
Look at the New" was recently axed, and neither Fox
Broadcasting Co.'s "Personalities" nor King World Productions
Inc.'s "Total Recall" has ignited the ratings. Next
September, only two new games shows are entering the field:
"Scrabble," based on the popular board game and a retread of
"The $100,000 Pyramid."
   There's a lot at stake for the stations. Syndicated shows
cost far less to buy than, say, reruns of network situation
comedies, which can run $500,000 a week. The producer
receives a fee from each station and keeps half of the
advertising time -- seven minutes in a one-hour talk show --
to sell to national sponsors. The local stations keep the
other seven minutes.
   Syndicators say finding a "television star" before
constructing a show is of the utmost importance. That's what
happened with Mr. Woolery, says Robert King, president of
Orion Television Entertainment, a unit of Orion Pictures
Corp. "We wanted to find a daytime television star to host a
show," says Mr. King. The original host of the daytime
version of "Wheel of Fortune," Mr. Woolery spent the past
eight years hosting "Love Connection," where he dares to be
goofy and has developed a disarming way of debriefing couples
after their first date.
   So far, Mr. Woolery's show has been sold in 44 markets.
And Ms. Jones' program has been sold to about 50 stations.
But Mr. Povich's program from Paramount Television, a unit of
Paramount Communications Inc., has sold faster than any other
talk show in recent history. It's been purchased by at least
71 stations, including 28 of the top 30 markets.
   "We're doing it because we have Povich," says Lucy
Salhany, president of Paramount's domestic TV unit. "We
wouldn't do a talk show simply to do a talk show." Paramount
already has established syndicated shows, "Entertainment
Tonight" and "Hard Copy," in the lucrative one hour that
proceeds prime time; the "Arsenio Hall Show" in the
late-night slot; and a weekly syndicated hit, "Star Trek: The
Next Generation."
   If Maury, Chuck, Jenny or Ron fail, there are already
others prepared to shoot off their mouths: Talks are
continuing between Tribune Entertainment, a unit of Tribune
Co., and comedian Gary Shandling, among others, about a
late-night talk show. And King World Productions recently
completed test marketing a morning talk show on the NBC
affiliate in Baltimore with the husband-wife team of Tim and
Daphne Reid.
   Says Mr. Kurlander, the consultant: "There's so much
controversy and so many celebrities to go around. Instead of
talk being cheap, the glut is cheapening talk."

Film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert and their famous thumbs again are 
welcome at previews of 20th Century Fox films. 
</P>
<P>
The studio Monday dropped its indefinite ban that had prohibited the pair from 
attending the screenings. 
</P>
<P>
The ban was imposed three weeks ago after the critics gave "thumbs down" to the 
film "Nuns on the Run." Siskel, a movie critic for the Chicago Tribune, and 
Ebert, a movie critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, said on the "Live -- Regis 
&amp; Kathie Lee" television show they hadn't found a single laugh in the 
movie. The two also have their own television movie review program. 
</P>
<P>
Another Fox movie, "Vital Signs," was shown Monday in Chicago to a preview 
audience, the first Fox screening since "Nuns." Ebert was out of town on 
another assignment, but Siskel called Fox's Chicago office to ask if he could 
attend. A company spokesman said the ban was lifted, and Siskel attended the 
preview.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Observer: Lucrative deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GJW Government Relations is one of the best lobbying firms around. It is
also one of the canniest when it comes to making money.
Having sold out for Pounds 6.5m to a company headed by Frank Lowe and Sir
Tim Bell just before the 1987 stock market crash, the three key figures,
Andrew Gifford, Wilf Weeks and Jenny Jeger, have bought back their business
 -now owned by Interpublic - for next to nothing. Andrew Gifford is terribly
discreet about the terms of the buy-back from Interpublic, a US advertising
agency, save to admit that most of the consideration is deferred.
If GJW does well, so will Interpublic. But given that GJW is three times
bigger, and profitable, than it was when Gifford and his pals last sold it,
they seem to have got a bargain. It also means that they can compete head on
with Sir Tim Bell's outfit without having to bother about the conflicts of
interest which forced them to sit on the sidelines during Hanson's stalking
of ICI, because Sir Tim was working for the opposition.
