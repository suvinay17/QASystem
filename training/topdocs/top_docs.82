   About 95 percent of the 10,000 hotel and motel rooms are open as
are most of the more than 500 restaurants. Streets have been
largely cleared of debris in the Historic District where most
tourist attractions have reopened. Carriages and pedal carts again
wind through the streets.
   The Ashley River plantations are open as are Fort Sumter in
Charleston Harbor and Patriots Point Maritime Museum in nearby
Mount Pleasant. Boone Hall Plantation in Mount Pleasant is expected
to reopen around Thanksgiving but visitors are not expected to
return to Charlestown Landing State Park until early next year.
   Heavy damage to beachfront summer homes and rentals on Sullivans
Island, the Isle of Palms and Folly Beach. Wild Dunes Resort on the
Isle of Palms plans to reopen in time for next spring's U.S. Clay
Courts tennis championships. The Kiawah Island resort to the south
suffered minor damage and reopens Nov. 1.

   About 75 percent of the 25,000 hotel and motel rooms operated by
members of the Myrtle Beach Hotel and Motel Association are open.
It's unclear how many of the remainder are closed because of the
storm or are simply closed for the season. No major hotels were
destroyed by the storm. Sixty-two of the area's 63 golf courses are
also open. Hotels and motels on the south end of Myrtle Beach
suffered damage to pools and other amenities.
   Heavy damage to beachfront condominiums and summer rental homes
in Garden City and Pawleys Island farther south. Officials predict
a beach renourishment program to be completed by March will leave
area beaches in better condition than before the storm.

   Sand and signs sailed out with
Hurricane Hugo, but this resort city's brassy trademarks of goofy
golf and bright lights will shine ever brighter next year,
merchants vowed.
   ``Come spring, I think it will be just like it's been for 30
years,'' said Jerry Bailey, as he and co-owner Barry Robinson
cleaned up The Gold Chain Outlet on Ocean Boulevard.
   ``There'll be flashing lights and cars cruising with
good-looking girls looking for good-looking guys. It's not going to
change one bit,'' he said.
   Tourists converge on the Myrtle Beach area's 59 golf courses and
60 miles of beaches during the summer season, swelling the
population from 28,000 to as much as 300,000.
   But it's the city's dinosaur-inhabited miniature golf courses
and bright light boulevards that most people remember about Myrtle
Beach.
   ``We're tacky. But we're so tacky that people love us,'' boasted
Edward Waldorf, owner of the Fun Plaza arcade, restaurant and gift
shop. ``Nothing has changed. The show goes on.''
   Hurricane Hugo sent its worst fury farther south, but it still
swept to sea the city's $4.5 million renourishment project that saw
50,000 dump truck loads of sand spread around the central beach
area two years ago.
   ``We feel (the project) saved us,'' city spokesman Pat Dowling
said. ``Without it, we would have been in much worse shape.''
   As it is, the central oceanfront promenade is now a mess of
slanting slabs of concrete. All 110 wooden walkways that provide
public access to the beach were wiped out. Some stores facing the
open were battered into empty shells by the surging ocean.
   At least 15 hotels and homes were severely damaged, while all
other beachfront property sustained varying degrees of damage.
   But the city's landmarks remain, including the Pavilion arcade
and Gay Dolphin gift shop, which carries such specialties as
miniature roadsters, turkeys and landscapes made from sea shells.
   And, on Monday, several hotels and motels reopened. But the
beach remained off-limits because of contamination from backed up
sewers. A 7 p.m. curfew remained in effect.
   The Swamp Fox roller coaster still rises from a storm-battered
amusement park, and a plastic zebra and her two young remain near
an artificial cave at the Jungle Lagoon miniature golf course up
the road.
   ``It's still Myrtle Beach,'' Dowling said. ``We think that's
good in terms of the variety it implies.''
   Still, he acknowledges some people might say: ``Ah, damn it,
that stuff isn't gone yet.''

   Nearly six weeks after Hurricane Hugo
hit, horse carriages are clopping through city streets, golfers are
back on the links, and tourism officials have begun a campaign to
lure tourists back.
   ``We want to create an awareness that we weren't wiped off the
face of the Earth,'' says Helen Stansell of the Charleston Trident
Chamber of Commerce.
   Hugo, which cut a swath of destruction along more than half of
the state's 187-mile coastline on Sept. 21, resulted in an
estimated $200 million loss to the state's $4.7 billion a year
tourism industry. The industry provides 98,000 jobs and $280
million annually in state tax revenues.
   ``What we had hoped for was an 8 percent growth on $4.7 billion
spending in 1988,'' said Bob Liming, tourism director for the state
Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism.
   ``What we're looking at now is a growth of 3 to 4 percent,'' he
said. ``We did have a very good summer and the first part of the
fall was good from Labor Day until the storm hit.''
   State and local tourism groups are telling U.S. and Canadian
travel agents that travel spots are open. Myrtle Beach officials
are raising $500,000 for a national advertising campaign.
   In the Myrtle Beach area, 62 of the area's 63 golf courses are
open. Hilton Head Island and other tourist points south of
Charleston sustained little, if any damage.
   In Charleston, about 95 percent of the 10,000 tourist rooms are
open, and most of the area's more than 500 restaurants have
reopened, Ms. Stansell said.
   The annual candlelight tour of historic homes is scheduled for
next month, and Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, where the first
shots of the Civil War were fired, reopened to visitors last week.
   ``The Number 1 reason people come to Charleston is because of
the historic appeal. We were fortunate we didn't lose any of
that,'' she said.
   Nearby Ashley River plantation museums have reopened.
   Post-storm reports that Middleton Place plantation was destroyed
were exaggerated, apparently when reporters flying over it thought
the ruins left by Sherman's troops in the Civil War were from Hugo.
   At the Patriots Point maritime museum in Mount Pleasant, across
the Cooper River from Charleston, the storm knocked the 27,100-ton
aircraft carrier Yorktown into a pier. Still, the museum reopened
about 1{ weeks later.
   Some attractions will take longer to recover.
   Boone Hall Plantation in Mount Pleasant isn't expected to reopen
until around Thanksgiving, and Charlestown Landing State Park will
remain closed until at least January, said Ms. Stansell.
   The worst damage was on the state's beachfront, where Hugo
washed away homes and condominiums. But most major hotels survived
and the beach season is over for the year.
   Wild Dunes resort on the Isle of Palms again plans to play host
to the U.S. Clay Courts tennis championship in the spring,
officials said.
   And Hilton Head Island escaped unscathed, although cancellations
in the wake of Hugo resulted in an estimated $2.5 million loss.
   The state has embarked on a plan to restore beaches in the
Myrtle Beach area with Gov. Carroll Campbell promising that
tourists next year will find those beaches in better shape than
before the storm.
   Publicity about the storm ironically may prove a boon.
   ``What we're finding is that people who didn't know South
Carolina had so much beach and so many historic sites do now,''
said Liming.

   Boats at Wild Dunes Marina were stacked
``like toys,'' three fishing piers at Myrtle Beach were severely
damaged, and the shoreline at Surfside Beach moved two blocks
inland.
   South Carolina's tourism industry suffered at least $2 billion
in damage to buildings and other structures in Hurricane Hugo,
state Tourism Director Robert G. Liming said Saturday.
   ``Our smiling faces and beautiful places are going to be a
little rugged'' for a while, Liming said. ``But we have positive
attitudes. We've been saying `When I breathe, I hope.' That's one
of our state mottoes.''
   Liming said the storm appeared to hit at random, one house or
business destroyed while the one next door was left intact. Some
tourism businesses already have reopened.
   In 1988, tourists spent $4.7 billion in South Carolina, with the
impact of that spending estimated to be close to $7.5 billion, he
said. Before Hugo, Liming said, the state predicted a 6 percent to
8 percent growth in tourist spending this year. Now, he said, that
should reach only 4 percent.
   Details about damage were somewhat sketchy since people have not
yet been allowed to return to much of the coast and electricity and
telephone lines were down. Here is a list of how individual areas
fared along South Carolina's 220 miles of coast:
   _CHARLESTON: Most of the historic buildings downtown suffered
some wind and water damage, but the main structures remained
intact. ``That's a blessing because that's what makes Charleston,''
Liming said.
   _NORTH MYRTLE BEACH: From Cherry Grove south to Windy Hill,
beachfront motels were heavily damaged; some were destroyed.
Several high-rise hotels had erosion under their foundations, but
none appeared likely to collapse. An 8 p.m. - 7 a.m. curfew was in
effect to prevent looting.
   Ocean Boulevard was covered with sand and in some places under
several feet of water. Most of the dozens of structures destroyed
were valued at more than $100,000, said state Rep. Dick Elliott.
   _ATLANTIC BEACH: A Holiday Inn had palm trees in its oceanfront
rooms. Furniture was pushed up against the back walls, with carpet
peeled up. Most swimming pools had severe cracks. Some were filled
with sand.
   _MYRTLE BEACH: Three fishing piers were severely damaged or
destroyed. The high-rise hotels along the Grand Strand remained
intact, with damage to swimming pools, first-floor lobbies and
restaurants. Parking lots were covered with sand and water.
   _SURFSIDE BEACH: Downed trees and power lines; refrigerators,
air conditioners, toilets, chairs and tables littered streets. Mud
on Ocean Boulevard was 10 inches deep in some places. The shoreline
moved inland two blocks. The town's best-known landmark, the
Surfside Fishing Pier, was gone.
   _GARDEN CITY: Erosion beneath houses and condominiums left them
perched precariously on cliffs of sand. Roads were covered with
sand as far as three blocks inland. The city pier was destroyed.
   _PAWLEYS ISLAND: At least 14 homes were destroyed, and numerous
others were damaged. At least three homes wound up across or in the
creek that separates the island from the mainland. A channel of
water about 20 feet wide sliced the island in two.
   _GEORGETOWN: The marina suffered extensive damage. A sailboat
that was securely tied down pulled apart a dock. Condominums on the
bayside were demolished.
   _ISLE OF PALMS and SULLIVAN'S ISLAND: Every building on both
islands appeared to have been damaged. Many houses were buckled and
had their supports ripped away. Several houses were in roads.
   The Wild Dunes resort, known for its golf course and tennis
courts, on the north end of Isle of Palms, just north of
Charleston, suffered heavy damage.
   The larger of the high-rise buildings in the resort apparently
remained intact, but Liming estimated only 10 percent of the houses
remained. Gov. Carroll Campbell said boats at the Wild Dunes marina
were stacked atop one another ``like toys.''
   _FOLLY BEACH: As many as 30 percent of the homes had either
disappeared or were uninhabitable, and it appeared all the others
suffered some damage.
   _EDISTO ISLAND: Suffered serious erosion with water rushing over
the road along the waterfront and under most oceanfront homes, many
of which were on poles.
   South of Edisto Island, the damage was mostly roof and water
damage, with some windows broken and trees and power lines downed.
An official with emergency preparedness in Beaufort County compared
it to the damage done by a severe thunderstorm.
   The southern portion of South Carolina's coast includes the
resort areas of Hunting Island, Fripp Island and Hilton Head Island.

   The Southeast prepared for the worst as Hurricane Hugo took aim at a 300-mile stretch of Atlantic coast that hasn't been hit by such a major storm in a century. 

   With wind speeds rising to 135 miles an hour yesterday evening, Hugo posed a serious threat to coastal residents and property. 
More than 100,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas under orders from state officials, but they left behind numerous high-rise hotels, million-dollar beachfront properties and two of the South's most historic antebellum cities, Charleston, S.C., and Savannah, Ga. 

   Most weather specialists said the hurricane would hit at high tide early this morning. 
While some predicted yesterday afternoon that the eye of the storm would strike Savannah, reports in the evening suggested that the hurricane might land farther north, in South Carolina. 

   Because of the high tide, many insurers feared the flood damage would be severe along the coastal areas. 
Moreover, a slow-moving storm like Hugo, which has been advancing at a pace of only about 20 miles an hour, is likelier to linger over land and cause more destruction. 

   Much of the coastal development in the Southeast has taken place in the past five years -- a period in which no big storms have struck -- so the construction quality "is completely untested," said Ray Hafner, Cigna Corp.'s vice president in charge of claims field operations in Philadelphia. 

   Few people were willing to predict what residents would find upon their return. 
Houses that are "300 feet back from the beach now could wind up with beachfront" property, said Robert G. Liming, South Carolina's tourism director. 

   The toll in property could be very high. 
With urban centers and such richly developed communities as Hilton Head, S.C., and Myrtle Beach, S.C., in the path of the storm, U.S. insurers could have as much as $4 billion at risk, according to the North Carolina Insurance News Service. 

   Many insurers have already deployed "catastrophe teams" to North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia to handle the battery of claims they will see from homeowners and businesses. 
Meanwhile, some insurers are still trying to get a handle on losses in Puerto Rico and other islands. 

   Most insurers said it was impossible to estimate what kinds of losses they might face at this point. 
But many of the claims that insurers process in the next few days will come from residential property owners, including losses for tony beachfront homes, luxury condominium high-rises and posh resorts. 
It could be a few days before insurance adjusters know the full extent of the damage, because many coastal areas, as well as Hilton Head and other islands, have been evacuated. 

   The stakes may be highest for South Carolina, where tourism has nearly passed the textile industry as the state's top producer of income and jobs. 
Last year, travelers spent $4.7 billion there, providing for 98,000 jobs, mostly in Hilton Head, Charleston and Myrtle Beach. 

   Among the threatened areas, Hilton Head features expensive resorts, including the 416-room Westin Hotel, estimated to be worth $70 million; the Hyatt Regency, 505 rooms; the Palmetto Dunes, 500 rooms; and the Marriott, 338 rooms. 
In addition, Fogelman Properties' famous Harbour Town marina and commercial development on the island is worth $75 million to $100 million, according to George Lapides, the company's senior vice president. 

   In Myrtle Beach, the Keystone Plantation, a mixed development of hotels, villas and golf courses, was built at a cost of about $500 million. 

   Water is the main threat for low-lying Charleston, where a tidal surge would swamp the cobblestone streets and lower floors of the elegant houses facing Fort Sumter, said Peter Sparks, a professor of civil engineering at Clemson University. 

   If the storm lands near Savannah, it could also touch off a surge that might send 10 feet of water crashing onto River Street, a swathe of affluent eateries and boutiques nestled together in century-old warehouses. 

   Savannah drew four million tourists last year who spent a collective $440 million, said Rhett Mouchet, a commercial real estate broker. 
Their visits were "pretty much centered around River Street." 

   Elsewhere, the danger would be wind, not water, said Prof. 
Sparks, who added that many high-rise buildings at Myrtle Beach were built with a "light, cheap" siding that would shear off. 
A single building, he said, sustained $300,000 in damage when brushed by Hurricane Diana in 1984. 

   Prof. 
Sparks said that in some resort towns, insurance losses might be greater for the furnishings than for the structures themselves. 
"People who own a quarter-million-dollar home don't have secondhand rugs on the floor." 

   In the Southeast, almost every major U.S. insurer has been jumping into action. 
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., the country's largest home insurer with 11.5 million policies, will fly in 110 adjusters by tomorrow morning to assist its regional staff. 
A truck loaded with computers, copiers, policy forms and other office equipment arrived in Columbia, S.C., yesterday to set up a temporary claims processing center. 

   By today, Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.'s insurance unit, Allstate Insurance Co., will have 450 representatives, including local personnel, to start processing claims and assisting folks whose houses and property have been damaged. 
Adjusters will work out of blocks of hotel and motel rooms in Raleigh, N.C., and Columbia to process claims. 

   Adjusters for Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. will move into Savannah once the storm passes and start canvassing the region. 
San Francisco-based Transamerica Corp. is monitoring the storm from its Atlanta offices. 
Transamerica covers most commercial property, such as small retail shops and business and light manufacturing operations in the storm's region, but not much waterfront property. 

   Insurers will be writing checks on the spot for policyholders whose homes or businesses have been leveled or severely damaged. 
Allstate estimates it will pay about 95% of its claims on the scene and may write between 28,000 and 30,000 checks. 
Even so, it may take two months before all losses are reported, said James Keillor, Allstate's regional CAT coordinator who's working out of Charlotte. 

   In Puerto Rico, three U.S. companies insure a substantial amount of property -- Cigna, American International Group Inc. and Continental Corp.'s Puerto Rican-American Insurance Co. Continental said it also has some exposure in Guadeloupe and the Virgin Islands, where information is scant, because no outsiders, not even insurers, have been allowed to enter St. Croix. 
The companies said it's too early to estimate the amount of the claims. 

   Despite all their efforts to anticipate what kind of assistance might be needed after a major disaster, insurers don't always get everything just right. 
After a hurricane destroyed much of Mobile, Ala., in 1979, one insurer swooped in with electric typewriters, phones and other supplies for a makeshift claims office. 
But the storm knocked out the city's electric power and the insurer didn't bring any power generators. 
By candlelight, many claims checks were written by hand, recalls one agent who was on the scene.

   On Folly Beach, a house sat in the road;
in some places, houses had disappeared. And on Sullivan's Island and
the Isle of Palms, Hurricane Hugo had damaged virtually every
building, an aerial tour showed Saturday.
   Hugo tore a wide path along the South Carolina coast, but areas
less than 20 miles from some of the worst-hit areas appeared
unscathed. About 680,000 people live along South Carolina's 220
miles of coast.
   Over Hilton Head Island and, about 150 miles to the south, over
the islands of St. Helena, Fripp and Paris, there were few telltale
signs of Friday's storm aside from boarded-up houses and trees on
the ground.
   Edisto Island, just south of Charleston, suffered serious erosion
when water rushed over the road and under most seaward houses, many
of which rest on supports. No homes were leveled, however.
   But heading north, a band of devastation stretched for 90 miles
from Folly Beach, five miles southeast of Charleston, to Garden City.
   As many as 30 percent of the homes on Folly Beach had either
disappeared or were uninhabitable, and it appeared that all the
others had suffered some damage from the rains and wind above 100
mph. One house had been tossed onto a road.
   From the air above James Island, a Charleston suburb that lies on
the inland side of Folly Beach, most of the roads and homes could be
seen in areas that once were hidden by thick woods. But the damage
to buildings was less than on Folly Beach.
   Sullivan's Island and the Isle of Palms bore the brunt of Hugo's
fury, and every structure on both islands appeared damaged.
   Many houses were buckled and had their supports ripped away, and
sometimes nothing was left but a roof or pilings in the sand.
Several houses were in roads, roofs were peeled off, and trees were
uprooted.
   The Ben Sawyer Bridge, the swing bridge that links the two
islands to the mainland, was twisted and tilted so that one end
dipped 35 feet down to the Intracoastal Waterway.
   At the Wild Dunes marina on the Isle of Palms, about 40 boats
were blown across the shore and heaped into a pile. At Folly Beach,
other boats were stacked up between a bridge and condominium project.
   Just to the north, homes in the Bull's Island area also were
heavily damaged, and a marina in Winyah Bay near Georgetown had
disappeared.
   Massive oceanfront homes in the wealthy residential community of
Debidue Beach fell from their pilings to the surf, and wind had
ripped off the fronts of houses, exposing rooms. More than
three-quarters of the homes were damaged.
   On Pawley's Island, south of Myrtle Beach, at least three homes
were across or in the creek that separates the island from the
mainland. Some had been moved more than 100 yards. A channel of
water approximately 20 feet wide had sliced the island in two.
   Roads in Pawley's Island and Garden City were covered with sand
as far as three blocks from the beach.
   Myrtle Beach and North Myrtle Beach suffered severe erosion that
exposed brown soil beneath the beach sand, but wind damage was
minor. And an amusement park roller coaster appeared intact.

   Thousands of coastal residents huddled
together in emergency shelters today as Hurricane Hugo roared
outside, but some, including a congressman, ignored the governor's
orders and rode out the storm in seaside homes.
   ``I wouldn't miss it for the world,'' said Rep. Arthur Ravenel,
R-S.C., who was staying with his wife in their harbor-front home in
Mount Pleasant, five miles east of Charleston. ``I'd like to see it.
So, I'm going to stay right here and keep a diary.''
   His wife, Jean, wasn't as excited. ``We're right on the harbor,''
she said. ``But Arthur doesn't seem to think we need to board up.
He's a Lowcountry boy. So I guess he knows what he's talking
about.'' South Carolina's south coastal region is called the
Lowcountry.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell issued a mandatory evacuation for coastal
residents, but officials apparently did not forcibly move people who
wanted to stay.
   Officials said today that more than 38,000 people crowded as many
as 121 shelters throughout the state. Hotels were full as far as 270
miles inland.
   ``We came 'cause I'm scared to death of Hugo,'' said Jeanette
Hardee, who was with her husband and two children at a shelter in
Socastee, a few miles inland from Myrtle Beach. ``Our house is half
mobile home. We boarded up all the windows before we left.''
   Damage on the coastal area included roads blocked with debris and
downed power lines, mobile homes that were damaged or destroyed,
damage to waterfront buildings and structures, and boats washing
ashore.
   On Pawleys Island, south of Myrtle Beach, authorities said at
least 14 houses had been washed away. Three piers disappeared in
North Myrtle Beach, Cherry Grove, and Garden City.
   State highway patrol officials said the agency lost 32 vehicles
parked in North Charleston when the roofs of buildings fell onto
them. Also in the Charleston area, the Ben Sawyer Bridge, connecting
Mount Pleasant and Sullivan's Island, was twisted and impassable.
   Thirty major buildings in downtown Charleston were leveled,
houses collapsed all over the city, the roof caved in at a shelter
for 200 people and several people were trapped beneath a collapsed
condominium complex, said Elizabeth Tam of the Charleston County
Police. At least five people were repored dead in the Carolinas.
   Near the northern South Carolina coast at Conway High School,
evacuees continued to arrive late Thursday even after the shelter
had officially closed with 2,000 people.
   ``We tried to close the doors but people are sneaking in side
doors,'' said Elaine Skelton, a registered nurse.
   As the storm bore down on Charleston, some kept a sense of humor
about them.
   On plywood boards protecting the windows of the Audubon Shop and
Gallery in the historic downtown section, someone painted the sign:
``We're wild, but not as wild as Hugo.''
   Mary Emily Boggs, who was among about 700 people in Gaillard
Municipal Auditorium in downtown Charleston, said she she just
returned to the city after spending several years away.
   ``I came home the first of September and this is a heck of a
welcome,'' she said as she kept her ear to a radio for the latest
storm news.
   Maggie Burghoff, a Red Cross volunteer manning the shelter, said
Hugo was her first hurricane since moving to Charleston from St.
Louis.
   ``I'm anxious to see what it's all about,'' she said. ``We get
tornadoes out there, but of course I've never seen one of them
either.''
   State Rep. Tim Wilkes of Winnsboro, meanwhile, said he was
concerned about what the storm might do to his house on Cherry Grove
Beach, north of Myrtle Beach. He drove there Thursday, but spent
most of his time surfing.
   Police finally chased him away.
   ``I wanted to be able to tell my grandchildren that I surfed
Hugo,'' he said after three hours on the surfboard.
   In the shelters, many seemed serene about possible damage from
the hurricane.
   ``We have medicine, blankets and friends. There is nothing else
we really need,'' said Kathy Peters, who huddled with 22 family
members in a Beaufort High School shelter.
   Tony and Sanny Wartko left Hilton Head Plantation Thursday
morning and headed for Columbia, the state's capital about 115 miles
inland. They drove both of their cars and carried a Turkish rug, a
Chinese rug, their cat, and photos of their wedding and a recent
round-the-world trip.
   ``At first, we said, `We'll take this and this and this,'''
Wartko said. ``Then we saw how much we had. So we just decided to
take the personal things that can't be replaced.''
   Louise Skolfield took some photographs of her North Myrtle Beach
home, a block and a half from the ocean, ``so I'd have something to
remember my home by if it's not there when I get back.''
   In Myrtle Beach, Costa Rica resident Fernando Vega and his family
were forced to spend part of their vacation in a high school shelter.
   ``We came about 6,000 miles to get here, and look what we find,''
Vega said. ``We wanted a suntan.''
   Gov. Campbell urged people not to head back to the coast until
the storm had completely passed, and then only if they owned
property. He said about 3,200 law enforcement officers and armed
National Guardsmen would be guarding property.
   ``We're going to come down on them (looters) like a ton of
bricks,'' he said.

   The next storm here may be in the state
capitol _ or in court _ when outraged property owners fight back
against a law prohibiting some people from rebuilding their
devastated beachfront homes.
   Even as the toll of Hurricane Hugo was tallied over the weekend,
debate erupted anew over South Carolina's Beachfront Management
Act, which is designed to prevent erosion and overdevelopment of
the state's ever-shifting coastline.
   Under the act, certain beachfront buildings cannot be rebuilt if
they are more than two-thirds damaged _ a provision that would
apply to many of the homes that were blown down by Hugo.
   Even before the hurricane, decisions were pending on three
lawsuits challenging the act. Now Hugo may prompt a reassessment of
the state's hard line on rebuilding.
   On Saturday, state Rep. Kenneth Corbett of Myrtle Beach asked
Gov. Carroll Campbell to call a special legislative session to
consider revising the law. Campbell said he would consider the
request.
   Meanwhile, the permit administrator of the Coastal Council,
Steve Moore, said a blanket permit might be issued to allow people
to repair homes that are less than two-thirds damaged.
   For now, the owners are under the rules of the law, which took
effect in July 1988. At the time, many lawmakers and
environmentalists hailed the act as a solution to degradation of
the state's beachfronts, especially along the popular Grand Strand
resort area that runs from Georgetown to North Myrtle Beach.
   The bill was opposed by those in banking, real estate and
tourism, as well as by several beachfront landowners.
   In general, the Beachfront Management Act sets three lines of
demarcation for shore construction:
   _No new construction within 20 feet of the actual or estimated
dune line.
   _Buildings from the dune line to 20 feet back can be repaired
with approval from the South Carolina Coastal Council if they are
less than two-thirds destroyed. If two-thirds of a building needs
to be rebuilt, it is termed destroyed and cannot be rebuilt.
   _No building of 5,000 square feet or larger can be built between
the water and a line where beach erosion can be estimated to reach
in 40 years.
   With its 135 mph winds and powerful tidal surge, Hugo virtually
destroyed most oceanfront property from Folly Beach to Surfside
Beach, and caused extensive erosion elsewhere along South
Carolina's 187-mile coast.
   Patty Scarafile, owner of an oceanfront home on the heavily
damaged Isle of Palms, 12 miles southeast of Charleston, said the
beachfront law was a great concern and she believed residents would
press for revisions.
   ``I think most people haven't even had a chance to see what the
condition of their property is,'' she said.
   ``The real problem here is we have people whose homes are
destroyed or partially destroyed,'' said Richard Davis, executive
vice president of the Association of Realtors. ``I don't think any
law we have on the books right now can properly address this.''
   Decisions on three lawsuits filed by Hilton Head Island
residents challenging the constitutionality of the law are pending
in U.S. District Court in Charleston. Earlier this year, the state
lost another lawsuit charging it illegally took land without
compensation from an Isle of Palms property owner, who was unable
to build on his two beachfront lots because of the law.
   An appeal of the $1.2 million judgment is pending.
   Despite the unusual circumstances created by Hurricane Hugo, a
state Coastal Council member said the 18-member council would have
to wait for legislative action before making exceptions to the law.
   ``I assume what we would have to do as a council is adhere to
the law until such time changes can be made,'' said Sen. Herbert
Fielding of Charleston, a council member. ``We're to administer the
law, and we can't change it unless the Legislature as a whole
changes it.''

<HEAD>Sand Dunes Being Rebuilt; Damage Estimates Soar to At Least $4 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Army engineers on bulldozers began
rebuilding sand dunes Thursday along South Carolina's
hurricane-ravaged coast, preparing for abnormally high tides later
this month.
   About 550 soldiers and Marines hauled sand in 100 dump trucks to
build up eight miles of dunes between Myrtle Beach and Pawleys
Island, where the high tides arriving Oct. 14 pose the greatest
threat of erosion, said Corps of Engineers spokeswoman Carol Todd.
   The moon's closest approach to Earth in years will push tides at
least 2 feet above the normal 5-foot range, and northeasterly winds
could push them even higher. The dunes are the only shield for
seaside homes and businesses.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell said he hopes to have 65 miles of dunes
rebuilt along South Carolina's 187-mile coast before that time.
   Damage estimates from Hurricane Hugo, meanwhile, have soared to
at least $4 billion, and officials considered increasing the
gasoline tax to pay cleanup costs.
   In Pawleys Island, 20 miles south of Myrtle Beach, residents did
not wait for federal aid to begin rebuilding dunes. The island was
sliced in half by Hurricane Hugo and dozens of homes were damaged
or destroyed.
   ``We've had experience with the bureaucratic way,'' said Hassie
Forrester, one of 16 landowners who hired a contractor to bulldoze
new dunes in front of their homes. ``We're told one thing one day
and another the next. That's why we're going ahead.''
   At least 30 other residents have signed up for the contractor's
services, he said.
   Hugo hit the coast Sept. 21, leaving at least 18 dead in South
Carolina, and damaging and destroying homes, businesses, schools
and municipal buildings. In all, 29 people were killed on the U.S.
mainland and at least 33 in the Caribbean.
   Damage, initially estimated in South Carolina at $3 billion, is
now estimated at between $4 billion and $5 billion, Campbell said
Thursday.
   It will cost an estimated $214.7 million to clean up the debris
and wreckage left behind by the storm. The state expects to pay 25
percent, with the federal government covering the rest.
   The state Highways and Public Transportation Commission said it
would consider raising the gasoline tax one penny per gallon to pay
for the cleanup. Campbell said he didn't like that idea, and would
first shift money from other programs.
   ``It may well be down the road we need revenue. I don't know,''
he said.
   Ten miles outside Charleston, the Corps worked to repair the
toppled Ben Sawyer Bridge, the only link between the mainland and
Isle of Palms and Sullivans Island.
   On Wednesday, the swing bridge was pulled out of the
Intracoastal Waterway, where one end had been at a 45-degree angle
since the storm.
   A broken cable prevented barges from positioning the bridge back
on the road, and workers predicted the span would not open to
traffic until Friday.
   The American Red Cross, meanwhile, announced that only seven
evacuation shelters housing 454 people are still open around the
state. Since the storm approached, 453 shelters had housed 87,230
people.
   About two-thirds of South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Co.'s 150,000
customers in the Charleston area have power, and almost all
customers in other areas of the state are on line, officials said.
   Charleston Mayor Joseph J. Riley Jr. said power was restored to
enough of the city to eliminate a curfew from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m.

   Hurricane Hugo struck South Carolina with
renewed fury Thursday after thousands of coastal residents in
southeastern states grabbed what they could carry and fled inland on
jammed highways.
   ``This is a disaster staring us right in the eye,'' Mayor Joseph
P. Riley Jr. said from his City Hall command post in Charleston,
where the hurricane downed power lines, snapped trees and caused
utility transformers to explode.
   ``All we can do now is pray and hope all the precautions we have
taken have been sufficient,'' Riley said as Hugo's eye bore in on
the city. ``I just hope and pray we can get through this without any
loss of life.''
   By midnight, 119 mph winds were reported in Charleston. The roof
cracked at City Hall, a 188-year-old brick building that has
withstood several hurricanes, and torrents of water poured into the
paneled council chamber. Phone and electric service to the command
post was knocked out.
   Hurricane-force winds first hit the coast by 9:15 p.m. EDT, and
about three hours later the eye of the storm passed over the Isle of
Palms just east of Charleston, said Bob Sheets, director of the
National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
   The eye was about 10 miles across and top winds were still at 135
mph.
   Hugo was expected to turn gradually to the north, causing severe
flooding as it moved up the East Coast. The storm posed a 19 percent
chance of hitting New York City and a 16 percent chance of hitting
Boston before Sunday night, the hurricane center said.
   As Hugo neared the coast, roads from Hilton Head to Myrtle Beach,
200 miles north, were nearly empty, as were the boarded-up resort
towns themselves. Power lines and trees were downed in some spots
and water flooded roads. Stop lights and neon lights were knocked
out in Myrtle Beach.
   ``One eyewitness said `It's like a light show,''' said Amy
Garrison, a reporter at WKZQ AM-FM in Myrtle Beach.
   In Charleston, the hurricane littered streets with tin roofs,
palmetto fronds and chunks of bark. Businesses were closed and
classes at public schools and universities canceled. Riley ordered
residents of one-story homes to evacuate.
   Hospitals stockpiled supplies, discharging any patients well
enough to go and moving others to hospitals inland to make room for
emergency patients, officials said.
   About 12,000 people had checked into 83 shelters across the state
as of Thursday evening, and more were expected, said Bennish Brown,
a spokesman for the Emergency Operations Center in Columbia, 220
miles northwest of here.
   ``We tried to close the doors but people are sneaking in side
doors,'' said Elaine Skelton, a registered nurse working at the
Conway High School shelter near Myrtle Beach. ``We tried to post
guards at the doors, but people were still coming in.''
   American Red Cross relief efforts were buckling under the number
of evacuees, said Brian Ruberry, a spokesman in Savannah, Ga., who
appealed for help.
   ``Right now the Red Cross is sheltering tens of thousands of
people all along the Eastern seaboard. This of course is at the same
time that we're sheltering 25,000 people on Puerto Rico and the
other Caribbean islands.
   ``We're beginning to feel the squeeze. Our resources are very
tight. Right now Hugo is shaping up to be one of our biggest relief
operations of the decade.''
   At midnight, the center of Hugo was near latitude 32.7 degrees
north and longitude 79.9 degrees west, forecasters said. The
hurricane's speed had picked up to 22 mph from 20 mph earlier.
   Near its center, Hugo's muscle reached winds of 135 mph, up from
125 mph earlier in the day and 105 mph the day before. North and
South Carolina can expect tornadoes linked to Hugo for the next two
days, according to the hurricane center.
   The coastal area could expect hurricane force winds for 10 to 12
hours once the eye comes ashore, officials said. A hurricane warning
was in effect between Fernandina Beach, Fla., and Oregon Inlet, N.C.
   By late afternoon, Hugo was upgraded to a category 4 hurricane on
the Saffir-Simpson scale of strength, the second mightiest category,
which indicated it could cause extreme damage.
   ``It strengthened more than we thought it would,'' Sheets said,
adding that Hugo would cause severe flooding as it moved up the
Appalachians.
   The timing of the landfall was critical because of the storm's
tidal surge, a dome of water 10 to 15 feet high that would feed a
normal 5-foot high tide that peaks after 2 a.m.
   ``On top of that will be waves,'' Sheets said earlier, and in
many places on barrier islands ``the buildings will be swept clean
off.''

   Coastal property owners in this
hurricane-scarred state are being told a tough new conservation law
won't necessarily keep them from rebuilding on the water's edge.
   ``We don't want people to panic,'' said H. Wayne Beam, executive
director of the South Carolina Coastal Council. ``People are
calling us, asking if all of Myrtle Beach will be affected by the
law and it will not be.''
   The 18-member council administers the controversial Beachfront
Management Act, passed last year in response to an accelerating
erosion problem blamed on overdevelopment of the state's coastline.
   The law, which took effect in July 1988, bans new construction
within a so-called ``dead zone'' extending inland 20 feet from an
established dune line, and prohibits the rebuilding of any home or
hotel in the zone that suffers more than two-thirds damage.
   The controversial law was already under challenge before
Hurricane Hugo hit last week. Homeowners on Hilton Head Island had
filed suit in federal court and the state Senate passed a revision
giving the council more latitude to permit rebuilding within the
dead zone. The House has not given its approval.
   Hugo cut a swath of destruction along more than half of the
state's 187-mile coastline last week, and hundreds of coastal
property owners are worried they won't be able to rebuild.
   The council met Thursday to streamline recovery efforts. Owners
of damaged buildings, seawalls and docks will receive a
construction permit without having to file for individual
permission. Those who must rebuild will have to apply for special
permission.
   The council also agreed to permit hotels to rebuild oceanfront
swimming pools damaged or destroyed by the storm and reallocated
$10 million distributed before Hugo to refurbish the state's
beaches; Hilton Head Island officials returned $6.25 million
allocated to them before the storm, which left their beaches
largely unscathed.
   State tourist industry offficials were urging quick action to
get beach resort areas back in shape for next year's season.
   ``We represent a large part of the state's Golden Goose,'' said
Myrtle Beach Mayor Bob Grissom. ``We need to get to business
yesterday.''
   While there are no estimates available on the number of beach
properties destroyed by Hugo, a survey taken before the storm found
that only 200 owners did not have enough property to rebuild their
structures by moving them several feet inland.
   The other 700 structures in the survey were on lots big enough
for the owners to move them outside the ``dead zone.''
   Beam also said the two-thirds damage clause will be liberally
interpreted.
   ``There will be some losses, but a house will have to be in bad
shape to be considered two-thirds destroyed,'' he said. ``I believe
there will be many buildings that may be condemned by local
standards that will not be considered beyond repair by us.''
   Under the council's regulations, even homes lifted off
foundations or pilings can be replaced at their original site.

   A man who 35 years ago was among the
first to discover the remains of a shipwreck uncovered by Hurricane
Hazel has told officials of another shipwreck exposed by Hurricane
Hugo.
   Historians and residents on Saturday dug up wooden pulleys,
pieces of board and iron spikes along Myrtle Beach. They also found
a large piece of wood with iron sheeting attached that may have
been a part of the boat's stern.
   Among those digging was Jack Thompson, who was among the first
to find the wreckage of the Freda A. Wiley, a Boston lumber ship
bound for New Orleans, after Hazel swept through in 1954.
   ``I believe there were several ships in that flotilla, carrying
lumber from Boston to New Orleans, that were caught up in the storm
of 1898,'' Thompson said. ``This may be one of those lumber ships.''
   Thompson, a photographer and longtime Myrtle Beach resident,
found a pulley from the ship on the beach Friday and notified city
officials of the shipwreck.
   State officials were to arrive Monday to examine the shipwreck,
but until then, representatives of the Horry County Historical
Society and the Myrtle Beach Police reburied their finds.
   ``You can't just dig something up like that without treating it.
It starts rotting if it's exposed to air,'' said Ben Burroughs, a
past president of the Horry County Historical Society.

   Rain, floods and a tornado heaped more
misery on Hugo-wrecked South Carolina on Monday, interrupting
rebuilding efforts from the storm that pummeled the coast 12 days
ago.
   Relief officials deluged with clothing urged donors to send
building supplies, food and cash.
   ``I feel sorry for the people. It's terrible. It adds insult to
injury,'' National Weather Service meterologist Dick Shenot said
after 2.5 inches of rain fell in a 24-hour period on Charleston,
the town hardest hit by Hugo's 135-mph winds.
   A tornado in Lebanon, about 25 miles north of here, left two
injured. About 100 people in Anderson County, 200 miles north, had
to be evacuated due to flooding.
   The Broad and Blair rivers in Gaffney, the Congaree River in St.
Matthews, the Waccamaw River in Conway and the Saluda River in
Chappells all spilled over their banks Monday.
   The Tiger River rose 12 feet above flood stage, damaging a major
telephone cable and knocking out long-distance service from
Spartanburg to Asheville, N.C., said Ron Laughlin, spokesman for
AT&amp;T. He had no estimate of the number of people affected, but said
service was expected to be restored by nightfall.
   In neighboring North Carolina, also deluged by rain Monday and
also still recovering from the wrath of Hugo, Monroe rescuers were
looking for three people missing when a creek flooded and swept
away their car. A fourth passenger was rescued after clinging to a
downed tree for more than an hour.
   Aid from across the nation continued to pour into South Carolina
for victims of the hurricane. The response has been so
overwhelming, though, that some officials don't know what to do
with everything.
   ``We have clothing backed up on us, including in boxcars that
have come from the West Coast,'' Maj. Ken Bush of the Salvation
Army said. ``People, generally speaking, only want a number of
clothes ... and we've reached that certain amount. We're
backlogged.''
   In the fishing village of McClellanville, population 500, about
10 classrooms in the local school are filled ``from floor to
ceiling with used clothing.''
   ``Used clothing has almost choked us to death,'' Billy Newsom of
the American Red Cross said.
   Bush and Newsom said donations of non-perishable food items are
still desperately needed. As cleanup efforts progress, hardware
items will be in demand to help repair homes and businesses, Bush
said.
   Sixty trucks carrying canned food, clothing and other relief
material reached Charleston on Monday, said Charleston Mayor Joseph
Riley, praising the cities across the country which have sent aid.
   ``There has never been in our country's history this degree of
community sharing,'' Riley said. ``You can bet your bottom dollar
that the next city that has a disaster, Charleston will be
represented'' in giving aid.
   A cash and food drive held at 10 college football games in six
Southeastern states over the weekend generated about $60,000 and
six tractor-trailer loads of canned goods, said organizer U.S. Sen.
Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
   His colleague, Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., took to the Senate
floor Monday and continued his criticism of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, the agency coordinating the federal government's
response to the disaster.
   ``FEMA does not have but 10 centers in South Carolina 10 days
after the disaster,'' he said. ``And, as far as I know, they still
haven't given out a financial grant yet.''
   Marilyn Quayle, the vice president's wife, visited the
hardest-hit areas of South Carolina and worked briefly at a FEMA
center in Moncks Corner on Monday. ``I don't think news accounts
can adequately describe the damage that is in this state. It's
really incredible,'' Mrs. Quayle said. ``It was very beneficial for
me to see and really understand what the state is going through. We
will be taking back information to the vice president and
president.''
   ``It was wonderful. I wasn't expecting it,'' said Annabell
Frazier, who was interviewed by Mrs. Quayle for federal aid. The
roof of Ms. Frazier's home blew off and water poured into the house
during the hurricane.
   Hurricane Hugo slammed into South Carolina Sept. 21 with 135 mph
winds, leaving at least 18 dead, 50,000 homeless, 270,000 jobless,
and homes, businesses, schools and municipal buildings damaged or
destroyed as far inland as Sumter and north to North Carolina. In
all, 29 people were killed on the U.S. mainland.
   Damage has been estimated at $3 billion or more, with crop
damage placed at some $100 million.
   Insurance agents have fanned out across the state since the day
after the hurricane hit. State Farm Insurance Co., the largest home
and automobile insurer in the state, expects to handle 130,000
claims worth $500 million, said company President Edward Rust Jr.
   ``It would be the largest single disaster we've ever
encountered,'' he said.
   There were signs the city was returning to normal. Classes
resumed Monday at the College of Charleston, the Medical University
of South Carolina and Baptist College. Cadets at The Citadel were
asked to return Wednesday.
   An 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew was scaled back to 9 p.m. until 5
a.m., enforced by National Guardsmen toting M-16 rifles.
   The Ben Sawyer Bridge, which links the barrier islands of Isle
of Palms and Sullivans Island to neighboring Mount Pleasant, was
expected to be back in place by Wednesday. The span of the swing
bridge was knocked into the Intracoastal Waterway during the
hurricane, cutting off all access to the islands by vehicle.
   In Myrtle Beach, beachfront property owners were told they could
begin applying for permits to repair seawalls, homes and businesses
that were less than two-thirds damaged by the hurricane.
   The Beachfront Management Act, enacted in 1988 to limit
development along the state's 187-mile coast, prohibits rebuilding
or repairs on structures that are more than two-thirds damaged.
   About 5,900 structures in North Myrtle Beach, Myrtle Beach,
Georgetown County and Charleston were damaged or destroyed, said
Donna Gress, spokeswoman for the South Carolina Coastal Council,
which enforces the law.
   Also Monday, The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that two
state firms will buttress eight miles of beach from North Myrtle
Beach to Pawleys Island later this week at a cost of about $820,000.
   The sand is meant to block further erosion during expected high
tides in mid-October at oceanfront properties already damaged by
Hurricane Hugo.
   The federal government will pay 75 percent of the cost under an
arrangement with FEMA. More beaches may be declared eligible for
such federal money or for state funds, said Tucker Eskew, spokesman
for Gov. Carroll Campbell.

   Music and laughter drift into the
streets from restaurants and nightspots one month after Hurricane
Hugo slammed into this antebellum city.
   But recovery from the worst disaster to befall South Carolina in
a century will be a long time coming as people rebuild splintered
homes, shattered dreams and a reeling economy.
   ``There are a lot of emotional scars out there that will take a
long time healing,'' Gov. Carroll Campbell said last week.
``Everybody would like to have things just like they were and
that's not going to be.''
   Progress has been made since the storm came ashore in Charleston
on Sept. 21, killing 18 across South Carolina, and leaving 65,000
homeless, 1 million in the dark, 270,000 jobless and $4 billion in
damage.
   Schools have reopened and power has been restored. Roads have
been cleared and the swing bridge linking the mainland and barrier
islands northeast of Charleston is back in place.
   Armed National Guardsmen who patrolled once-shattered streets
and Army troops who helped clear debris are long gone.
   Restaurants and hotels have reopened, but business is slow.
   ``Normally October and April are our busiest months of the year.
Hopefully, things will be better in the spring,'' said Jeff Miller,
co-owner of Josiah's House restaurant in downtown Charleston.
   Sixty-three buildings collapsed and hundreds of historic
structures were damaged in Charleston where piles of debris wait to
be carted from some streets. Local officials hope to have most of
it cleared in two weeks.
   Across the Cooper River in suburban Mount Pleasant, blue plastic
sheets still protect roofs torn apart by Hugo's winds. Meanwhile,
trees, siding, roofs and furnishings from oceanfront homes litter
Isle of Palms.
   Thirty miles to the northeast, where the shrimping village of
McClellanville bore the brunt of the storm, trawlers tossed onto
land as if they were toys are being carted away for repairs.
   Farther up the coast, the storm cut Pawley's Island in half. The
breech has been filled, but oceanfront gaps remain where homes were
washed away.
   Sumter, 100 miles inland, was among the hardest hit areas.
Damage to utilities, homes and businesses was estimated at $100
million.
   The American Red Cross estimates more than 23,000 homes were
destroyed or suffered heavy damage statewide. The Federal Emergency
Management Agency has distributed nearly $5 million for uninsured
losses and temporary housing.
   Eighty-seven people remained in the two Red Cross shelters still
open last week, said spokeswoman Elizabeth Quirk.
   ``We still have a long way to go,'' she said, noting the agency
is serving more than 2,000 meals a day at 23 sites around the state.
   Families left homeless after the hurricane flooded a low-income
housing project in Charleston do not know what to do next.
   ``I don't know where I'm going to live,'' said 78-year-old Rosa
Furgeson who sought refuge in Ebenezer A.M.E. Church. ``The only
thing I wish is they could turn me out to a shelter of my own.''
   Children are living in a church shelter and attending school in
Georgetown because their homes 25 miles away in McClellanville were
destroyed.
   ``I cried the first day I went to school in Georgetown because I
miss my home, my school and everything,'' Dominique Grant said.
   Gov. Campbell said housing is a top priority, followed by
reviving the state's $4.7 billion tourism economy by next summer.
   Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. has already urged visitors to return
to Charleston and officals in Myrtle Beach are mounting a $1.6
million advertising campaign to lure vacationers.
   ``We need to let the world know we're OK,'' said J. Michael
Pate, the publisher of The Sun News in Myrtle Beach. ``Even though
we've taken a pretty hard blow, we're still in business.''
   South Carolina's beaches, which attract upwards of 15 million
visitors a year, were hit hard by the storm.
   Crews worked feverishly to build a sand berm to protect
oceanfront structures from the highest tides in a decade last week.
The water lapped harmlessly against the dunes and Campbell was
criticized by some for pushing the multimillion-dollar project when
people remain homeless.
   But the governor had no apologies, saying getting the beaches
back in shape is a key to jump-starting the tourism economy.
   Hugo's winds snapped trees, causing an estimated $1 billion loss
for the timber industry, enough to build a house for every family
in West Virginia.
   The farming and fishing industries also were shattered, as Hugo
destroyed barns, boats and packing houses. The state Department of
Agriculture estimates $303 million in damage to crops, buildings
and livestock statewide.
   In McClellanville, shrimpers face the prospect of a bleak winter
before they can make repairs and get back in business. But
residents promise to rebuild.
   Mary Linen has bad dreams about the storm when she tied her
mother and two children to the porch of her home so they wouldn't
be washed away.
   ``I have nightmares like I'm fighting for my life again,'' she
said. ``But I still say we are blessed. Material things can be
replaced.''

   Rain, floods and a tornado dealt cruel
new blows today to those trying to rebuild their lives and towns
devastated by Hurricane Hugo.
   The latest weather assault came amid a torrent of volunteer aid
from across the country, an effort boosted Sunday by a $1,000 check
by former President Reagan.
   Northeast of Charleston, a twister tore through the town of
Lebanon early today, tossing a house trailer that had stood through
the hurricane onto a road and injuring its two occupants. Neither
was hurt seriously, said Doris Browder, a dispatcher at the
Berkeley County Emergency Medical Service.
   ``The trailer was slung across the road,'' she said. ``I'm sure
most of their injuries were mental, not physical. They probably got
through the hurricane all right, then to have this happen.''
   Heavy rain fell throughout South Carolina on Sunday and into
early today, hampering cleanup efforts and forcing temporary
evacuation of 100 people in Anderson County in the state's
northwest corner. No injuries were reported, and the people
returned to their homes when the flood threat eased a few hours
later.
   Rain in South Carolina subsided by midmorning after about 2{
inches fell on Charleston. In North Charleston, 10 miles away,
about 2 inches of rain backed up storm sewers, scattered debris and
hampered cleanup efforts.
   ``I feel sorry for people. It's terrible. It adds insult to
injury,'' said Dick Schenot, meteorologist at the National Weather
Service.
   Torrential rain also fell on North Carolina residents trying to
clean up Hugo's wreckage, and trees left leaning by the hurricane
leaned farther or fell because of saturated soil. The rain in North
Caroline also swept a car into a creek, leaving three people
missing, and forced scores of people to evacuate.
   Disaster followed catastrophe in Greeleyville, when a gasoline
tanker truck exploded Sunday, injuring two and forcing 150 people
to flee their homes for three hours for fear of an explosion in
underground storage tanks. The town of 720 was battered by
Hurricane Hugo as it tore across the state.
   ``It would be terrible any time, but in connection with
everything else we've had, I'm sure it hit us a lot harder,''
Greeleyville Mayor Doris Browder said of the blast.
   The truck exploded Sunday as its driver was about to start
pumping gas into storage tanks at a convenience store, leaving the
driver with second- and third-degree burns and the store owner with
minor burns and bruises. The cause wasn't known.
   Residents of hard-hit Charleston took time out Sunday to salute
volunteers who have chipped in with money and goods and traveled to
the historic city to help cut away splintered trees, clear debris
and lend a hand with other cleanup chores.
   ``What you're doing will never be forgotten,'' Mayor Joseph
Riley told hundreds of weary workers who gathered at a rally Sunday
despite drizzle. ``People from all over the country came to help a
community in need. We might have suffered some damage, but our
spirit is alive.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle's wife, Marilyn, planned to tour the
damaged areas by helicopter and work at disaster centers in Moncks
Corner and Charleston this afternoon and Tuesday.
   Hugo, which belted the city Sept. 21 with 135 mph winds, where
more than 2,500 historically significant buildings were damaged.
   ``These people need help,'' said Steve Desin, a volunteer who
came to Charleston directly from working on the Alaskan oil spill
cleanup. ``This is what makes this country what it is. You can kick
our butts, but we'll fight back.''
   The Vallejo, Calif., native sent four vessels from his Cheetah
Aviation Transport Service to ferry food, clothes and medicine to
offshore islands cut off by the storm.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which had 10 disaster
application centers open Sunday, planned to add four more centers
today, officials said. As of Sunday, 5,400 residents had applied
for various forms of federal and state assistance.
   Also today, beachfront property owners in Myrtle Beach, S.C.,
were told they could begin applying for permits to repair seawalls,
homes and businesses that were less than two-thirds damaged by the
hurricane.
   The Beachfront Management Act, enacted in 1988 to limit
development along South Carolina's 187-mile coast over bitter
opposition from many property owners, prohibits rebuilding or
repairs on shore structures that are more than two-thirds damaged.
About 5,500 structures in North Myrtle Beach, Myrtle Beach and
Georgetown County were damaged or destroyed, said Donna Gress,
spokeswoman for the South Carolina Coastal Council, which enforces
the law.

<TEXT>
   Here is a summary of developments Friday associated with
Hurricane Hugo:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>DISASTER DECLARED</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush declared seven counties of South Carolina a
disaster area, making the state eligible for federal loans for
rebuilding, repairs, and restoration of utilities.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>ELEVEN DEATHS REPORTED</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Ten deaths were reported in South Carolina, eight of them in
counties surrounding Charleston and one near Columbia, S.C., and one
person died in North Carolina.
   Earlier, at least 20 people, and as many as 26, died as the storm
surged across the Caribbean.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>THE STORM</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Hugo was downgraded to a tropical storm at 6 a.m. Friday. By 6
p.m., Hugo had all but lost the characteristics of a tropical storm
and was weakening, although the weather system featured maximum
sustained winds of 40 mph and torrential rains. Its last location
was in Pennsylvania, just west of Pittsburgh, at latitude 40.5
degrees north and longitude 81 degrees west. Officials said no
further tracking would be done.
   The storm was expected to wear out in Canada.
   Threats of severe flooding were eased because the storm was
moving faster than expected.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>LANDFALL</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The center of the storm made landfall about midnight Thursday
over the Isle of Palms, just east of Charleston. S.C.
   The hurricane passed through Charleston with winds of 135 mph and
gusts even higher. Flooding was worsened since the impact, carrying
a wall of water 12 to 17 feet high, coincided with high tide at 2:13
a.m.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>DAMAGE and FLOODING</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty buildings in downtown Charleston, S.C., were flattened,
houses collapsed all over the city, and several people were trapped
beneath a collapsed condominium complex. Fires erupted from natural
gas leaks.
   Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. estimated damage at $1 billion.
   Elsewhere along the coast, Garden City Beach, S.C., a small
vacation community south of Myrtle Beach, was largely leveled. At
least 14 houses on Pawleys Island were washed away. Three piers
disappeared in North Myrtle Beach, Cherry Grove, and Garden City
Beach.
   In Charlotte, N.C., 200 miles inland, power was out in 85 percent
of the city, and downed trees blocked roadways and damaged homes.
High winds, clocked at up to 75 mph, felled a 1,000-foot television
transmission tower and broke windows in a 42-story downtown office
building.
   At least 900,000 customers in the Carolinas were without
electrical power Friday.
   As the storm moved northward, coastal areas were largely spared
but inland flooding was reported.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>LAW ENFORCEMENT</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell said more than 3,000
National Guardsmen and law enforcement officials were on duty.
   Campbell said there had been looting in the Surfside Beach and
Garden City area, but the National Guard had quickly secured the
area.
   Charleston Mayor Riley ordered a curfew from 6 p.m. until 7 a.m.
every night until the damage is cleaned up.
   About 175 Guardsmen were deployed in North Carolina to assist
local authorities. The state ordered evacuation of 90 prisoners at
Yancey Correctional Center at Burnsville as a precaution because of
rapidly rising waters in the Cana River.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CARIBBEAN</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   On St. Croix, Virgin Islands, officials said patrolling U.S.
troops sent to restore order had curbed rampant looting.
   The Marine Radio Band said Thursday that two looters were shot in
St. Croix, but there was no independent confirmation.
   In Washington, the Interior Department said it will staff phones
24 hours for people concerned about relatives in the Virgin Islands.
The number is 202-343-6816.

The reunification of Berlin, which makes it the largest city between Paris and 
Moscow (pop. just over 5 million), also has resulted in a debate over which of 
East Berlin's streets should be renamed to remove any memory of their Communist 
associations. 
</P>
<P>
Among the streets likely to be rechristened are, for example, Karl-Marx-Allee, 
Lenin-Allee and Ho-Chi-Minh-Strasse. 
</P>
<P>
But Germans are being cautious about the changes, pointing out that there is a 
difference between naming streets and squares after corrupt officials and 
honoring writers or philosophers, no matter what their politics. All agree that 
the former should be changed, but some argue that the latter should stay. 
</P>
<P>
So far, 160 name changes have been proposed, meaning that map makers will be 
kept busy with updates for some time to come, as will visitors trying to find 
their way.

Biggest complaint overall was about the quality of hotel food (47% of those 
surveyed said they were less than "very satisfied"), followed by climate 
control (35%).

that his North Myrtle Beach, S.C., miniature golf course needed a new image, 
something that would help attract tourists and the folks from the nearby Air

<TEXT>
   Houses, condos and hotels sit like castles in the sand, a
developer's vision realized next to the waves of the Atlantic and
the Gulf of Mexico.
   But environmentalists see them as interlopers on the shifting
dunes, vulnerable to destructive storms such as Hurricane Hugo.
   ``There's foolishness in building in God's sandbox unreasonably
close to the ocean,'' said Dana Beach of the South Carolina Coastal
Conservation League. ``We have to make sure we're not building or
rebuilding on places that may not be there after the next storm.''
   While Hugo's roar and 135 mph punch have hit and run, a
philosophical squall still blows, pitting private property rights
against the public good.
   Sounding a charge to grow, developers argue people have a right
to build and protect their investment.
   Urging a strategic retreat, environmentalists counter that
overdevelopment is risky and can deny public access to eroding
beaches.
   States from New England to Florida and around to Texas have laws
attempting to preserve the oceanfront. In South Carolina, a 1988
law may prevent the rebuilding of an estimated 213 oceanfront
houses that were at least two-thirds destroyed by Hugo.
   The law prohibits building in a so-called ``dead zone'' 20 feet
behind an established dune line. Owners of damaged homes who don't
have enough property to move inland out of the zone may be out of
luck.
   ``Nature just delivered a very clear and enuciated message. We
have been setting ourselves up for a disaster the way we have
developed the shoreline,'' said Orrin Pilkey, a Duke University
geologist and an expert on coastal dynamics. ``If Hugo doesn't
prove that something has to be done, nothing will ever do it.''
   Barrier islands, beaches and dunes are natural lines of defense
that protect the mainlaind. They surrender sand to absorb the
energy of storm waves, then are replenished gradually.
   The problem comes if structures are built on the shifting
shores. Pilkey and others believe that barriers built to protect
buildings actually accelerate erosion.
   What Pilkey and his advocates want is to pull back to give
nature a buffer in which to work, even if it means letting homes
fall into the ocean.
   ``Hugo was a warning shot for the entire U.S. East Coast,'' said
Rob Thieler, a research assistant to Pilkey at Duke. ``We know how
to back up, but are we willing to start knocking down buildings in
New Jersey because Hugo hit in South Carolina?''
   That's an easy question for many developers and coastal
officials.
   Beaches are money machines that lure sun worshippers and tourist
dollars. Realtors and investors have capitalized on the nation's
love affair with the shore by making it attractive to visit.
   ``America is not going to abandon it's coast. People are going
to live at the beach,'' said Richard Beck, former mayor of the
barrier island community of Folly Beach off Charleston.
``Abandonment is a cruel joke. I defy anyone to show me where
abandoning property has brought back the beach.''
   Added John Singleton, an investor in heavily developed Myrtle
Beach, ``You can't expect a man who has a multimillion-dollar hotel
to walk away from it.''
   Another punch faces storm-battered South Carolina. The highest
tides in nine years are forecast for Oct. 16. A $65 million
emergency effort aims to rebuild the dunes to prevent flooding.
   ``It would be like pouring salt into a wound if the tides come
in without any protective barrier,'' said Tucker Eskew, spokesman
for Gov. Carroll Campbell.
   Meanwhile, to protect property from erosion, some beaches have
been armored with seawalls and bulkheads. But these intrusions can
deny public access to the shore, and critics object to spending
public money to protect the ocean views of private landowners.
   Others note that more than just property is at stake in the
debate. Future hurricanes could kill more people if they hit
overdeveloped spots.
   ``Our concern is about the potential loss of life,'' said Robert
Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center. ``We need to
restrict the type of development we're seeing.''
   South Carolina had eight lawsuits filed before Hugo. In one
case, it was ordered to pay $1.2 million to a landowner unable to
build on two lots in the dead zone, but it is appealing the case.
   More lawsuits are expected, but other states have had their
share of legal storms after hurricanes.
   After Hurricane Alicia pounded Galveston in 1981, Texas
probihited many residents from rebuilding under its Open Beaches
Act. The court-tested law bans building on the seaward side of a
line of vegetation.
   Alicia's storm surge moved the vegetation line back by as much
as 175 feet.
   ``It's a poker game, building on the beachfront, and it's a
gamble with Mother Nature,'' said Ken Cross, an assistant Texas
attorney general.
   Under a 1981 law, North Carolina decreed that houses must be set
back behind the first line of stable vegetation at a distance 30
times the erosion rate. The distance for larger structures is 60
times. Structures built before the law cannot be rebuilt if they
suffer 50 percent damage in a storm.
   Since 1985, the state has banned seawalls, bulkheads and
revetments to guarantee that beaches are accessible to the public.
   ``It sends a message that these are not very safe places to
build,'' said George Everett, director of theNorth Carolina
Division of Coast Management. ``And we're not going to let
buildings impact on the public's right to have access. The beach
belongs to the public.''
   Florida, which has an 8,000-mile shoreline that is longer than
any state's except Alaska, protects its beaches in a number of ways.
   In one example, nothing can be built beyond the frontal dune,
which is the first raised portion of land from the water's edge. If
a hurricane destroys any building seaward of either the erosion
line or the frontal dune, it can't be rebuilt.
   ``Everybody wants to be able to walk out the door to the
water,'' said Andy Grayson, director of Florida's Division of
Beaches and Shores.
   In Massachusetts, permits are given on a case-by-case basis
under the state's Wetlands Protection Act, which gives the state
authority to deny building or rebuilding.
   ``If you can show you can build without harm to the beach or the
dune, you can do it. (But) we have the authority to deny,'' said
Jeff Benoit, chief of the state's Coastal Zone Management Office.
   Rhode Island, the Ocean State, prohibits building on barrier
beaches and dune crests. A structure built before the law that is
50 percent or more destroyed by a storm cannot be rebuilt without a
permit.
   ``If it's destroyed by a storm, that gives us a pretty good
indication that it may be in an area that's inappropriate to be
built on,'' said Tim Dillingham, a marine resource specialist.
   Georgia's Shore Assistance Act requires a specific set-back for
buildings proposed on sand dunes and barrier islands. An existing
building destroyed by a hurricane must comply with the set-back law.
   New Jersey allows rebuilding, but Gov. Thomas Kean has sought a
coastal protection commission to control development. Kean's order
to require state approval for oceanfront development is being
argued in appeals courts.
   Virginia and Delaware govern new buildings, but not existing
ones damaged by storms. Maryland also does not restrict rebuilding.
   ``There's no doubt people along the Eastern seaboard have built
too close to the ocean,'' said Clay Brittain, a hotel owner in
Myrtle Beach. ``We wouldn't do it again. But you can't move back
completely from a developed area. It's not practical to retreat.''

<HEAD>Skimpy Bathing Suits Banned in North Myrtle Beach</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORTH MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bottom has fallen out of
beach wear this summer, and that's upsetting people who would
rather look the other way.
   ``We've had maybe a dozen young women we have asked to cover up
or leave the beach,'' said city waterfront director Norma Jean Page.
   Part of her job lately has been to keep the beach free of the
near nudity of thong or G-string bathing suits which leave the
bottom bare.
   ``It's really no big deal. We just tell them we have had a city
ordinance since 1976 against revealing certain parts of the body,
including the buttocks. When they understand that, they are very
nice and leave,'' she said.
   The suits are specifically outlawed in North Myrtle Beach. But
women who sport the skimpy wear have not been fined or hauled off
to jail, just asked to leave the beach.
   Mark Kalb of the Pineapple Beach Surf Shop said the trend
started in earnest last year and the open-air suits are even more
popular this season.
   ``These suits don't appeal to the conservatives, although
everybody pretty much takes a look at them.''
   South of North Myrtle Beach, in Myrtle Beach, there are no
specific bans _ except for outright nudity _ and few complaints
about the risque swimsuits.
   ``We looked at the same ordinance North Myrtle Beach has, but
our biggest problem would be with enforcement,'' said Myrtle Beach
city clerk Mandy Tomz.
   ``There is such a wide area of beach to cover, and there are so
many people on the beach, it would be very difficult to pick and
choose whom to send away, and that would not be received well.''

   Perfect beach weather, you say? A great day to grab your towel,
shades, sunblock, the latest best seller and head for sandy shores?
   Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water, a
virtual sand trap of rules and regulations awaits, governing such
things as your oceanside attire, what you pack in your cooler, even
whether you can toss a Frisbee.
   You think Fido might enjoy a romp in the waves? Sorry, but an
informal survey of beach restrictions on both coasts and some inland
beaches shows that most ban dogs, at least during the summer.
   ``Frankly, people just don't want to put their beach blankets
down next to a pile of deep doo-doo,'' said East Hampton Supervisor
Tony Bullock on New York's Long Island. Horses are prohibited, too.
   Wayne Shattaway, a lifeguard at Jacksonville Beach in Florida,
which even hired a dogcatcher to patrol the beach, said dogs can
sometimes be aggressive to strangers.
   ``Right now Rotweilers and Dobermans are the popular dogs here.
If there was just poodles on the beach, it wouldn't be a problem,''
he said.
   Bottles and glass containers are banned virtually everywhere,
restrictions on cans are almost as rampant, and if you're toting
anything stronger than soft drinks, that's likely to be forbidden,
too.
   ``The liquor, sun and surf just didn't mix,'' said John Crisp,
assistant chief of the Volusia County Beach Patrol, explaining why
the Florida county, which covers Daytona Beach, Ormond Beach, New
Smyrna Beach and Daytona Beach Shores, eliminated alcohol a few
years ago.
   Well, how about packing some hot dogs and having a barbecue?
   Open fires are banned on Virginia Beach, Va., Alabama's Gulf of
Mexico shoreline, California's Los Angeles County, and Long Island
and New Jersey beaches, to name a few. Cape Cod National Seashore in
Massachusetts bans fires without a permit. Wrightsville Beach, N.C.,
bans grills.
   ``A few years ago people would cook with charcoal on the beach
and then dump the hot charcoal in the sand and cover it up. Then
someone else would come walking along and step on it and ruin their
day,'' said Wrightsville Beach Police Chief George Antley.
   Frisbees are banned at Hilton Head Island, S.C., Long Island,
Virginia Beach, among other places.
   No ball playing of any kind on Ocean City, Md., beaches from 9
a.m. to 5:30 p.m. during the summer. No flotation devices _ inner
tubes, rafts and such _ on Rehoboth Beach, Del., or on the more than
10 miles of Lake Michigan beaches within Chicago's city limits.
   Los Angeles County beaches have a ``flying missile'' ordinance to
quell beer hurtling.
   Even President Bush's favorite pastime _ horseshoes _ is banned
at Hilton Head, according to Cynthia Harrison, a code enforcement
officer for the popular resort area.
   Most beaches have general rules banning nudity or indecent
exposure. But what is indecent is subject to debate.
   Thong bathing suits, swimsuits that expose the derriere, aren't
considered appropriate attire in North Myrtle Beach, Myrtle Beach
and the Isle of Palms, S.C.
   Thongs are OK on Hilton Head but T-shirts that say ``lifeguard''
are not, unless the wearer really is a lifeguard.
   Other rules include: No swimming in water deeper than your
shoulders in Myrtle Beach, no picking of flowers at Cape Cod
National Seashore, no radio playing without earphones on New York's
Jones Beach, and no swimming at Surfrider Beach, a surfing-only
beach in Malibu, Calif. Volleyball is allowed on Myrtle Beach, but
leaving the net up overnight will get you fined.
   Driving on the beach in a regular vehicle is prohibited almost
everywhere except where the beaches have hard-packed sand, such as
along the Washington coastline. But proposed legislation there will
probably ban that activity by next summer.
   Four-wheel drives and dune buggies are banned in many places for
environmental reasons, including sections of the Oregon coast, the
Florida Panhandle, some New Jersey communities and parts of Long
Island.
   Do all these restrictions make you want to tell somebody to go
fly a kite?
   That's a no-no in many places, too.

   It took Hurricane Hugo six hours to roar
across South Carolina, lashing the state with wind, rain and flood.
Officials ending a week of cleanup say those few hours will be felt
for years.
   The storm smashed the state's economy, throwing thousands out of
work. It devastated timberlands, farmlands and coastal areas,
damaging everything from tourist havens to shrimp beds. The genteel
face of Charleston has been scarred and muddied.
   ``It's not going to be a quick process, it is going to be hard
for all of us,'' said Joseph P. Riley Jr., the mayor of Charleston,
where more than 2,500 historically significant buildings were
damaged. The repairs to those building will take five years.
   The immediate effects are obvious. Eleven days after South
Carolina bore the brunt of the storm, thousands of people remain
without electricity, and an estimated 50,000 are homeless.
   Cleanup efforts are costing the state a half-million dollars
daily. State Comptroller General Earle Morris has estimated Hugo
could put the state budget $300 million in the red in the next
fiscal year, partly due to losses in revenue from fallen payroll
and property taxes.
   Hugo's 135 mph winds and 17-foot tidal surge also altered the
state's employment picture. An estimated 270,000 people were thrown
out of work for at least the short term, raising the state's
normally low unemployment rate of 4.5 percent to more than 16
percent.
   ``It's across the board,'' said Jack Philips, a program
supervisor with the state Employment Security Commission. ``We have
everything from manufacturing plants to hardware stores affected.
The weather doesn't discriminate.''
   Philips said it was hoped many shops and businesses would reopen
soon, but the state's important lumber and fishing industries may
take three years to recover.
   Dozens of shrimp boats were beached and damaged by the storm,
which struck during one of the best harvests in recent years. State
officials say shrimp beds appear to have escaped major damage, but
producers were hit hard.
   ``The biggest thing is people who buy the shrimp _ the packing
houses _ they're all wiped out,'' said Jimmy Scott, a
McClellanville shrimper for 21 years.
   Of greater concern is the damage to forests, which provide the
raw materials for a $4.3 billion wood products industry that
employs 30,000 people.
   It is estimated 36 percent of the 12.2 million acres of state
forest was damaged, felling trees worth more than $1 billion.
   Put in perspective, about 2.2 billion board feet of timber are
harvested annually. Hugo's destruction downed 6.7 billion board
feet.
   ``We hope to salvage what we can, but there's three years of
harvest on the ground,'' said Steve Scott, a state forester. ``We
see a major reforestation problem. After all, how do you get that
many acres back in production?''
   The tourist industry, a $4 billion business that employs 98,000
people, is expected to bounce back quickly despite $2 billion in
damage. But Robert Liming, state director of tourism, said damage
to such resorts as Myrtle Beach and Garden City would drop growth
from an anticipated 8 percent to less than 3 percent this year.
   Liming said key to bringing tourists back is a quick rebuilding
program to dispel notions that the coast remains in tatters.
   ``Some people are assuming that Myrtle Beach is gone and that's
a wrong assumption,'' he said. ``A remarkable amount of property
has already gotten back on line, but some heavy rental areas are
going to be a long time coming back.''
   The storm laid waste to as much as $100 million worth of cotton,
soybean, corn and tobacco in the major agriculture areas in the
Savannah Valley and the northeast part of the state.
   While the damage will be gone with next year's row crops, Dan
Smith, a Clemson agricultural economist, said the effects will take
its toll on those who raise poultry, hogs and dairy cattle.
   ``Those losses will be much greater,'' he said. ``We're talking
about a longer term recovery period that will see some farmers sell
out.''
   Perhaps most worrisome is Hugo's impact on the state's small
businesses: the restaurants, shops and small manufacturers without
the resources to survive weeks and months of down time.
   ``The number of businesses coming into the disaster assistance
centers is far greater than we expected,'' said John Patrick,
district director of the U.S. Small Business Administration. ``We
will probably be seeing effects of this for the next 10 years.''
   Nelson Bean, president of Evans American Corp., a Houston-based
company specializing in catastrophe management, said the longer it
takes businesses to get on their feet, the greater the risk they
face of closing.
   ``Probably 40 percent of businesses won't reopen,'' he said.
``That's pretty significant when you consider that these are
largely mom and pop operations that have been in business for years
and years.''

   Hurricane Hugo punched this city of
antebellum mansions with full fury and killed at least 12 people in
the Carolinas before weakening Friday and trailing off inland to the
north.
   South Carolina's barrier islands were also hit hard as houses
were blown off their foundations and boats were pushed ashore,
stacked along the beaches two and three deep.
   ``Garden City for all practical purposes is gone,'' said M.L.
Love, a Horry County administrator who toured the elite resort
community near Myrtle Beach.
   President Bush declared seven counties a federal disaster area.
   ``It is the worst storm, the worst disaster, I've ever seen
anywhere,'' said Gov. Carrolll Campbell.
   Hugo, downgraded to a tropical storm at 6 a.m., had lost all
characteristics of tropical storm and was weakening, although the
system had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph and torrential rains.
   The storm's last location was in Pennsylvania, just west of
Pittsburgh, at latitude 40.5 degrees north and longitude 81 degrees
west. Officials said there would be no further tracking.
   Campbell toured his state Friday by air, stopping to assist some
people who waved him down for help.
   About 50 people in the small coastal community of McClellanville
were stranded by the storm, and some were standing on top of cars
and waving at the passing helicopter.
   Campbell's helicopter landed in a nearby baseball field, and the
governor made sure the people got help. ``There are a lot of little
places like that in this state that just got wiped out,'' Campbell
said.
   Eleven of the U.S. deaths were in South Carolina, said Warren
Hardy of the state's Office of Emergency Preparedness. The South
Carolina deaths included an elderly man found in the rubble of a
house in Charleston, and a power company employee who was
electrocuted Friday as he worked to restore electricity. In North
Carolina, a 6-month-old baby was killed in Union County when a tree
fell on a house.
   The center of the storm advanced farther west than expected,
targeting eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania and western New York
before it was expected to wear itself out in Canada. It was moving
to the north at 30 mph.
   A hurricane is a heat engine fueled by warm, moist air over open
oceans. When these giant storms hit land, they lose their wallop,
although they can still manage considerable bluster.
   Charleston, S.C., felt the full wrath of Hugo, which wrecked a
string of Caribbean resort islands beginning early Sunday. As many
as 27 people were killed in the Caribbean. About 50,000 people are
homeless.
   The city where the first shots of the Civil War were fired in
1861 was clobbered with 135 mph winds and a tidal surge of 12 to 17
feet. The storm, which at its height was as large as the state of
South Carolina, flattened 30 buildings, peeled off roofs and flooded
streets. Several people were believed trapped in a building
collapse. Officials later said no one was found inside.
   ``There's just destruction everywhere,'' said Mayor Joseph P.
Riley, who imposed a 6 p.m. curfew. He called it a ``disaster of
extraordinary dimensions.''
   Riley estimated damage at $1 billion in the city of 65,000
residents.
   National Guardsman patrolled streets, and Campbell confirmed
there was sporadic looting before authorities restored order.
   Jo Smith rode out the storm in her 100-year-old house across from
the Medical University of South Carolina, but said Friday she wished
she would have left town.
   ``I thought I was going to die,'' she said. ``The house was
shaking. I could hear pieces of tin flying off (my) roof.''
   At least 900,000 people were without power in the Carolinas,
officials said. The total included 200,000 or 85 percent of the
homes and businesses in Charlotte, N.C., which felt Hugo's muscle
even though it's 200 miles inland. The fraud and conspiracy trial of
PTL founder Jim Bakker was canceled Friday because of the storm.
   In addition to flooding, fires from natural gas leaks erupted in
low-lying Charleston, where some tree-lined streets were under
several feet of water.
   At least 20 boats washed ashore, including a 50-foot craft that
washed up on a city street, Police Chief Reuben Greenberg said.
   Most of the historic antebellum mansions facing Charleston Harbor
weathered the storm with little cosmetic damage, officials said.
   But Fort Sumter, the first Union holding fired upon by the
Confederacy at the beginning of the Civil War, suffered $1 million
damage when a 17-foot wall of water passed over it, according to
Constance Harriman, assistant secretary of the interior for parks
and wildlife.
   The Pentagon reported Friday that its Air Force base near
Charleston appears to have sustained ``catastrophic levels of
damage,'' according to a statement issued in Washington.
   Seventy miles up the coast, the elite vacation retreat community
of Garden City was smashed, officials said. It was among the
communities under an evacuation order before Hugo hit.
   Love said destruction extended ``as far as I could see.''
   On Pawleys Island, south of Myrtle Beach, authorities said at
least 14 houses had been washed away. Three piers disappeared in
North Myrtle Beach, Cherry Grove, and Garden City.
   Amy Garrison of WKZQ AM-FM said a reporter who was allowed to
tour the islands with civil defense personnel said houses were
sitting in the middle of the road, roads were washed away and trees
and power lines were down.
   Refrigerators, air conditioners and washers and dryers were
floating in the streets. Stairways that lead down to the beach were
sitting in the streets.
   Barrier islands, which were ordered evacuated on Thursday, were
pummeled and flooded. Jack Sellers, a pilot from Columbia who flew
people to the coast to look at their property, said Pawleys Island
had about a 100-to-200-foot wide swath cut through it.
   ``There are now two Pawleys Islands, if you will,'' Sellers said.
   He said two houses that had been on the beachfront were sitting
300 yards or 400 yards away in a marsh.
   Bush's disaster declaration makes federal aid available for such
things as temporary housing, low-cost loans for rebuilding and
grants for repairing roads, bridges and other public structures.
   Hurricane-force winds first hit the South Carolina coast at 9:15
p.m. Thursday. It was the first major hurricane to strike Charleston
since Hurricane Gracie came ashore 70 miles to the south in 1959.
   The eye passed over Charleston about midnight. A wall of water
gushed into City Hall when a chunk of roof on the 188-year-old brick
building blew away during the storm. Phone and electric service to
the city's command post was knocked out.
   ``We've just been flattened,'' said Jerry Stafford, a spokesman
for Santee Cooper Electric Co. ``One building just peeled open like
a can opener.''

   South Carolina today banned shellfish
harvesting and warned against swimming in the ocean and rivers,
saying Hurricane Hugo had left waters choked with sewage.
   Workers also resumed efforts today to reopen a bridge to the
state's devastated resort islands, and officials ordered
construction of an eight-mile-long sand dune to protect the beach
from high tides later this month.
   As tons of supplies poured into the state, relief officials said
they were awash in clothing and urged donors to instead send cash,
food and building supplies.
   Vice President Dan Quayle's wife, Marilyn, returned from a
helicopter tour of the coast Monday sobered by the extent of the
destruction.
   ``It's really incredible. There are areas that look like war
zones,'' said Mrs. Quayle, who helped out Monday taking
applications at a Federal Emergency Management Agency center in
Moncks Corner.
   ``I think people understand that this has been devastating. I
think we can see that in the nationwide outpouring of volunteers
that the whole country understands.''
   Hurricane Hugo slammed into South Carolina Sept. 21 with 135 mph
winds, leaving at least 18 dead, 50,000 homeless, 270,000 jobless,
and homes, businesses, schools and municipal buildings damaged or
destroyed far inland and in North Carolina. In all, Hugo killed 29
people on the U.S. mainland.
   The warning against swimming could last for months and possibly
affect the spring tourist season, said Wayne Fanning of the
Department of Health and Environmental Control.
   The indefinite ban on shellfishing was enacted because the 10
major sewage treatment plants in the Charleston area are not
working fully and only 30 percent of the pollutants are being
removed, Fanning said. When released into rivers, the waste
depletes oxygen in the water, causing widespread fish kills.
   Rain that has hurt recovery efforts continued in some parts of
the South.
   In Monroe, N.C., a community that was in Hugo's path, a man and
woman were killed Monday when their car was washed into a flooded
creek. A search resumed today for a 17-year-old girl who was riding
in the car.
   The nation's generosity toward storm victims has brought a
backlog of donated clothing, including boxcar loads from the West
Coast, said Maj. Ken Bush of the Salvation Army.
   In the hard-hit fishing village of McClellanville about 30 miles
northeast of Charleston, the school is filled with donated clothes,
said Billy Newsome of the American Red Cross.
   ``Used clothing has almost choked us to death,'' he said, adding
what's needed is donations of non-perishable food and building
supplies.
   The Army Corps of Engineers prepared to repair the Ben Sawyer
Bridge _ the only link between the mainland and the devastated
resorts of Sullivan's Island and the Isle of Palms. The storm left
the swing bridge hanging at a 45-degree angle with one end
submerged in the water.
   Workers were to float barges under the dangling section and use
the rising tide late today to help raise the bridge, said corps
spokesman Rod Ruffennach. Then cranes will swing the bridge back
into position.
   The bridge will be left in position for cars to traverse until
experts determine whether they can repair the swing mechanism that
opens the bridge to allow boats to pass on the Intracoastal
Waterway.
   The Corps also announced that two contractors will pour sand on
eight miles of beaches from North Myrtle Beach to Pawleys Island
later this week.
   The sand is meant to block further erosion of hurricane-damaged
property during a surge of high tides expected in mid-October.
   Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said 60 trucks carrying
canned food, clothing and other necessities rolled into the city
Monday.
   The mayor also said the city's dawn-to-dusk curfew, in effect
since the storm, has been shortened to 9 p.m. to 5 a.m., but was
still being enforced by the National Guard.
   Riley said about 90 percent of the city's hotels have reopened
and many restaurants are back in business.
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., took to the Senate floor Monday
and continued his criticism of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, which is coordinating the federal government's response to
the disaster.
   ``FEMA does not have but 10 centers in South Carolina 10 days
after the disaster,'' he said. ``And, as far as I know, they still
haven't given out a financial grant yet.''
   Damage in South Carolina alone has been estimated at $3 billion
or more, with crop damage placed at $100 million.

<TEXT>
   Hurricane Hugo's six-hour blast left
Folly Beach unrecognizable even to its mayor. Up the coast, the
storm's wake left two other barrier islands cut off, and sliced
another in two.
   Folly Beach, the town and island just south of Charleston,
virtually lost its entire beachfront row of homes.
   ``I don't know where we are,'' Mayor Bob Linville said during a
tour of the area. ``All of my usual landmarks are gone.''
   One missing dwelling was the Atlantic House Restaurant, which had
survived years of serious erosion that left it literally sitting
atop pilings in the ocean, approachable only by foot bridge. After
Hugo, all that remained was its red shingle roof.
   ``About 30 percent of the houses on the island are no longer
habitable, if they're even here,'' said Claude Wade of the Folly
Beach Police Department.
   Linville estimated the damage at tens of millions of dollars and
said hundreds of buildings had been damaged or destroyed.
   Most of the seaward houses in the town of 2,000 residents either
were cracked open or without roofs or windows.
   Along the ocean, support poles for beach houses had nothing to
support, their houses having been washed away by Hugo's 12- to
17-foot tidal surge. Arctic Avenue, about 50 feet from the ocean,
looked like a dirt road, covered with sand and the debris of smashed
beach houses.
   The storm showed that the destruction was often a game of chance.
One house was knocked off its foundation and with a wall missing.
But a china cabinet remained standing as did two plates inside.
   Demolished houses spewed mattresses, clothes, and furniture along
the beach.
   The Holiday Inn, which sits on a slab of concrete 50 feet from
the ocean, seemed to weather the storm remarkably well despite its
proximity to the ocean. Its upper floors remained intact even though
the first floor was demolished. Farther up the coast, two barrier
islands _ Sullivan's Island and the Isle of Palms _ were cut off
from land because the storm knocked out its only link _ the
swing-span Ben Sawyer Bridge.
   On the Isle of Palms, which hosts the U.S. Clay Court Tennis
Championships, the hurricane ripped the fishing pier out of the
water and destroyed million-dollar waterfront homes.
   About 100 boats that had been docked at the Wild Dunes Marina
were ``stacked up like cordwood'' across the marina on Goat Island,
said Ben Moise, a state Wildlife and Marine Resources Department
official.
   Hugo created a 100- to 200-foot-wide channel of water through
Pawleys Island, midway between Charleston and Myrtle Beach,
according to Jack Sellers, a pilot from Columbia who flew people to
the coast to check their property.
   ``There are now two Pawleys Islands, if you will,'' Sellers said.
   Back on Folly Beach, Dean DuBani walked along the streets Friday
afternoon carrying a small satchel and looking for a ride.
   While many other heeded evacaution orders before the storm,
DuBani said he remained and partied with some other people in an
ocean front house as Hugo smashed ashore.
   ``It was incredible,'' he said. ``Everything was just floating
by.''
   DuBani said he left the house when it began breaking up, and
walked across the street to a neighbor's house whose door had been
blown open.
   ``I got scared and just grabbed my clothes. This is all I have
left,'' he said, pointing to his pouch that contained a fishing
pole, a can of beer, some swimming fins, a snorkel, several shirts
and a few pairs of pants.
   ``Thinking about heading to Key West,'' he said before hitching a
ride out of town with a blonde woman in a sports car.
   But Bud Tetric was determined to stay.
   ``Going to rebuild,'' he said of his demolished house. ``I pay
taxes, and, if I pay taxes, I should have full use of my property.''

   Hundreds of National Guardsmen patrolled
ravaged streets against looting today, and police reported more than
90 arrests as residents returned to begin the long task of
rebuilding from Hurricane Hugo.
   Chainsaws buzzed, crews worked around the clock to restore power
and telephone communications, and insurance agents across the
Carolinas braced for claims that could run into the billions from
the region's most devastating hurricane in 30 years.
   ``It is the worst storm, the worst disaster, I've ever seen
anywhere,'' Gov. Carroll Campbell said after surveying the
destruction by helicopter. ``We're going to be a long time digging
out of this and rebuilding.''
   The hurricane was blamed for 18 deaths in the Carolinas and two
in Virginia.
   In the six hours Hugo and its 135 mph winds surged through South
Carolina, it flattened dozens of homes and buildings, snapped trees,
twisted bridges and washed scores of boats ashore. Mayor Joseph P.
Riley Jr. said damage in his 3-century-old city alone might reach $1
billion.
   ``There's just destruction everywhere,'' said Riley, who imposed
a 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew.
   Police reported isolated cases of looting. Fifty people were
arrested in Mount Pleasant, across the Cooper River from Charleston;
12 in North Charleston; and at least three in Charlotte, N.C. In
Charleston, police Sgt. Thomas Gardner said today that 27 people
were arrested Friday and early today for looting and one for
violating curfew.
   ``It was very quiet last night. I left at 1 a.m. and the only
thing I saw were police cars and National Guardsmen,'' Gardner said.
Two people from New Orleans, he said, were posing as relief workers
who then would take people's possessions; they had not been charged
yet.
   The governor deployed 2,600 National Guardsmen to patrol streets,
enforce the curfew, help remove debris, purify water and perform
other duties.
   At a news conference today, Riley said power should be restored
by tonight at hospitals, but he could not estimate when residents
might get power. Mail delivery could resume Monday, and he
recommended that people boil water before drinking it.
   Up to half a million customers across the state were without
power as of late Friday. In inland Columbia, people lined up at an
ice warehouse with coolers. Some areas of Charleston were without
water, and residents were told to boil their drinking water.
   Two hundred miles inland, Charlotte, N.C., also sustained heavy
damage, and nearly 80 percent of the customers in the city of
375,000 were still without power this morning, said Duke Power Co.
spokesman Joe Maher.
   There were 14 deaths in South Carolina from the storm itself,
related traffic accidents, and heart attacks suffered during
cleanup, according to the state Emergency Preparedness Division. In
North Carolina, three deaths in the Charlotte area were blamed on
the storm, and a 6-month-old baby died in Union County when a tree
crashed into a house.
   Two people were killed by Hugo after it moved into Virginia as a
tropical storm. In the Caribbean, where Hugo first touched land, the
storm killed at least 27 people and left 50,000 homeless.
   ``All things considered, we lucked out in a lot of ways,'' said
Chipp Bailey, spokesman for Mecklenburg County Emergency Management
in Charlotte, where the most serious injury reported was a broken
pelvis suffered by a woman when a tree crashed through her roof.
   The hurricane and its tidal waves of up to 17 feet smashed ashore
at Charleston late Thursday. After being downgraded to a tropical
storm, Hugo advanced farther west than expected, whisking through
Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio and western Pennsylvania, where the
National Hurricane Center stopped tracking it.
   By the time it reached Pittsburgh on Friday night, Hugo was
generating winds under 40 mph and was no longer classified as a
tropical storm. As it fizzled early today, Hugo's dying remnants
darted through Canada's St. Lawrence Valley and became lost in
another weather front, according to meteorologist Joe Harrison of
the National Weather Service in New York.
   ``We really can't find it anymore,'' Harrison said.
   President Bush declared seven South Carolina counties _ with a
total of 750,000 residents _ a disaster area. The declaration frees
up federal aid for housing, loans and grants for rebuilding.
   Hundreds of insurance adjusters have come to South Carolina to
process the damage claims, but it will be days before they begin to
catch up, said state Insurance Commissioner John G. Richards.
   Along the coast, Folly Beach, Isle of Palms, Pawley's Island,
Myrtle Beach, Cherry Grove and Garden City were devastated.
   ``Garden City for all practical purposes is gone,'' said Horry
County administrator M.L. Love after he toured the small
unincorporated town near Myrtle Beach. He said damage there could
run in the hundreds of millions.
   Residents of the Isle of Palms and Sullivan's Island, which were
among the hardest-hit barrier islands, were kept from even
inspecting their homes because the Ben Sawyer swing bridge _ the
only link to the mainland _ was knocked out. About 100 boats that
had been berthed at one marina were ``stacked up like cordwood,''
said Ben Moise, a state Wildlife and Marine Resources Department
official.
   Pawley's Island had a 100-foot channel of water through it.
   ``There are now two Pawley's Islands, if you will,'' pilot Jack
Sellers said after flying over the island.
   Although the Pentagon had dispatched planes and ships from
Charleston's Air Force and Naval bases as Hugo approached, the
installations suffered perhaps $50 million in damage, said Sen.
Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.
   Charleston, a city of about 65,000 people, took the full force of
Hugo.
   Most of the historic antebellum mansions facing Charleston Harbor
weathered the storm, but Fort Sumter, the first Union stronghold
fired upon by the Confederacy at the beginning of the Civil War,
suffered $1 million damage when a 17-foot wall of water roared over
it, federal officials said.

<HEAD>South Carolina's Damage Estimates Revised Upward; Charleston Recovering</HEAD>

   Although damage estimates in the wake of
Hurricane Hugo were hiked upward to more than $4 billion, the
return of carriage rides and parking tickets are signs that
historic Charleston is trying to get back to normal.
   Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said the city had made an ``absolutely
remarkable'' recovery in two weeks since the hurricane lashed the
city with its 135 mph winds.
   ``The city is open, the curfew is over and we invite the people
of the state and the country to come to Charleston,'' Riley said.
But he noted that the recovery will take longer for those who lost
homes, possessions or jobs in the hurricane.
   Horse-drawn carriages were to be back on the streets this
weekend and the city will start ticketing parking violators on
Monday, the mayor said.
   Meanwhile, the Ben Sawyer Bridge _ the only link between the
mainland and the Isle of Palms and Sullivans Island about 10 miles
north of Charleston _ is back in place, said Carol Todd,
spokeswoman for the Army Corps of Engineers.
   She said the corps finished its work about 2 a.m. today, but
that she does not know when the swing bridge will open to traffic.
Officials from the state Highway Department were inspecting the
bridge this morning, she said.
   The bridge _ one end of which was submerged in the Intracoastal
Waterway by Hugo's winds _ was lifted onto barges Wednesday. But a
broken cable prevented the barges from positioning the bridge back
on the road before today.
   Hugo hit the coast Sept. 21, leaving at least 18 dead in South
Carolina, and damaging and destroying homes, businesses, schools
and municipal buildings. In all, 29 people were killed on the U.S.
mainland and at least 33 in the Caribbean.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell said Thursday that damage from the storm
was revised upward to $4 billion to $5 billion. Previous estimates
had been closer to $3 billion.
   State and local governments would pick up about 25 percent of
the $200 million cleanup cost with the federal government covering
the rest.
   The state highway commission suggested a 1-cent increase in the
gasoline tax to help pay for the cleanup, but Campbell said he
would first shift funds from other programs before increasing taxes.
   Riley, who had asked Campbell to request Army troops to help
clear debris, said Thursday he wrote to President Bush himself when
the governor rejected the idea.
   In a letter to Campbell, Riley and two other mayors said the
state has been inundated with as much debris as one might expect to
collect over 50 years. They said private contractors could not meet
the cleanup demand and local governments couldn't afford to pay
them.
   But Campbell said the cities can still contract with private
contractors and would have to pay 12 percent of the cost.
   Also Thursday, National Hurricane Center Director Bob Sheets
said damage from the storm could have been halved had coastal
structures been built to the tougher hurricane building codes of
south Florida.
   ``The extent of the damage is far more widespread than I've seen
from any previous hurricane,'' said Sheets, in the state to tour
storm damage.
   Workers used bulldozers to rebuild dunes along beaches scarred
by the hurricane. Private contractors were supported by 550 Army
troops and Marines using 100 dump trucks to haul sand to build up
eight miles of beach in Myrtle Beach.
   Tides at least 2 feet above normal are expected along the coast
from Oct. 14-18 caused by the moon coming unusually close to the
Earth, said Ms. Todd.
   Campbell hopes to have 65 miles of dunes rebuilt along the
state's northern coastline before the high tides hit.

<HEAD>Tropical Storm Hugo Poses Threat of Heavy Rain In The Northeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Hugo lost some of its fury as it roared northward
Friday, fading to a tropical storm and then dwindling to an unnamed
storm that nevertheless brought heavy rain and the threat of
flooding from Tennessee to New York.
   Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches were possible in the storm's
path, and forecasters warned that isolated tornadoes were possible
from Virginia to Pennsylvania.
   The storm produced 6 inches of rain at Savannah, Ga., in 24 hours.
   Hurricane Hugo packed winds of 135 mph as it hit the South
Carolina coast Wednesday night. Its eye passed just east of
Charleston, moved northwest to just west of Sumter and entered North
Carolina just west of Charlotte.
   The strong wind downed thousands of trees, damaged roofs,
destroyed homes, blew over signs and bent steel towers to the
ground. Hugo dumped 3.16 inches of rain in about 12 hours at
Charlotte, and during the early morning produced wind to 69 mph with
gusts to 87 mph.
   Thunderstorms associated with Hugo also produced wind gusts to 60
mph at Myrtle Beach, S.C., and wind gusts to 109 mph at Sumter, S.C.
At Snowshoe, W.Va., wind Friday gusted to 60 mph.
   Tree damage was so extensive in North Carolina that the state
forest service had to be called in to help clear the debris and
downed trees.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended from Mississippi and Alabama
to the lower Great Lakes region and New York state Friday afternoon.
Heavier rainfall totals for the six-hour period ending at 8 a.m. EDT
included 3 inches at Savannah, Ga., 1 inch at Myrtle Beach, S.C.,
and .98 inches at Birmingham, Ala.
   Strong northwesterly winds were ushering cold Canadian air into
the north central United States. Showers and thurderstorms were
reported over southwest Texas and southern New Mexico.
   Forecasters posted flood watches for western Massachusetts and
western Connecticut and flash flood watches for Vermont and eastern
New York state. They posted overnight freeze warnings for Minnesota,
South Dakota, northwest Iowa and northern and west-central Wisconsin.
   The cold spot in the nation Friday was West Yellowstone, Mont.,
with a low of 26 degrees.
   Afternoon temperatures were warming into the 80s across the
southern Atlantic Coast and from south-central Texas through eastern
Texas to the central Gulf Coast; in the 90s in the desert Southwest;
in the 40s across the Dakotas, eastern Montana and northern
Minnesota.

FT  20 MAR 93 / Travel Focus - Golfing Holidays: Florida's fun, in rain or
sun
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RAIN smashed against the windscreen. It was hard to see beyond the end
of the bonnet, so I stopped searching for the golf club and returned to my
hotel. You get used to that in Florida in late summer. Torrential rain falls
almost every afternoon and is followed within minutes by the sun. Soon the
ground is steaming.
I was in the north-east, the Palm Coast-Daytona Beach area. The Palm Coast,
two hours' drive north of Orlando, is a parcel of land the size of greater
London where ITT is building a community of 20,000 homes. It has tennis,
riding, biking, any water-borne sport and five golf courses. I was there for
golf.
I had mentioned to David Leadbetter, the well-known coach, that I was going
golfing in north-east Florida and he urged me to play Hammock Dunes. The
name had a ring to it. 'It's great,' said Leadbetter, so to play Hammock
Dunes became a primary objective.
I started, however, at Cypress Knoll, 25 minutes' drive from the Sheraton
(Palm Coast) Resort where I was staying. Cypress Knoll, carved out of
swampland, was designed by Gary Player. It has such narrow fairways that I
nearly went an entire round without using my driver, something I have never
done in 40 years of playing golf. My frustration was offset by the beauty of
the surroundings. A heron swooped down in front of one tee. A swallow-tail
butterfly fluttered past another. There were water moccasins everywhere and,
apparently, an 8ft diamond-back rattlesnake.
Next morning I left the Palm Coast and drove south to Daytona Beach. Indigo
Lakes is semi-private, which means it is open to anyone for a few thousand
dollars in membership. Accuracy was demanded but not as much as at Cypress
Knoll. The fairways are generous and some of the greens enormous.
Then it was the turn of Cypress Head, another semi-private course, designed
by Arthur Hills in Port Orange, just south of Daytona. Because the water
table is so close to the surface in Florida, any earth that is moved to dig
a bunker or sculpt a mound reveals water - the dominant feature on most of
Florida's courses.
Not so at Cypress Head. It has holes like those at some of Britain's famous
inland courses. Thickets containing oaks, pampas grass, willows, thistle and
wax myrtle had to be skirted or driven over and although there was water on
many holes, it was neither intrusive nor overpowering. I could play Cypress
Head again and again.
Good news awaited me at my motel. I had a starting time at Hammock Dunes the
next morning. I celebrated with a swim in the Atlantic. Although it was late
afternoon the sand on Daytona's 24-mile-long beach was hot underfoot.
Hammock Dunes is an ultra-private new club on the Palm Coast. It had only
112 members last August, one per acre. What sticks in my mind is not the
excellent condition of the course or the number of challenging holes.
Instead, I was struck by the attention to detail on the practice ground. I
went to limber up and found a pile of balls laid in such a way that must
have taken several minutes to do. It was the same at all of the 15 positions
on the practice ground.
Nor is it all golf. Within 60 miles are Disneyland, the Epcot space centre
and Universal Studios. This somewhat unsung part of Florida represents a
realistic alternative to Spain and Portugal for a spring or autumn golfing
holiday.
John Hopkins was a guest of British Airways Holidays and Destination
Daytona. One-week holidays including golf at 10 courses in the Palm Coast
and Daytona Beach area start at Pounds 589 (flight and hotel) plus Pounds 89
for the golf. British Airways Holidays: Pacific House, Hazelwick Avenue,
Three Bridges, Crawley, West Sussex RH10 1NP, tel: 0293-611311; Destination

<TEXT>
   With sore knees and aching backs,
residents of this tiny resort town declared victory Monday in their
Sand Castle War with Myrtle Beach, S.C.
   ``We came, we fought, we are victorious,'' Nabiel Shawa,
administrator of this town of 1,500, said after surveyors measured a
sand castle built during the weekend.
   The castle, which included dragons and Teen-age Mutant Ninja
Turtles, measured 34,503 feet, or 6.53 miles _ enough for Long Beach
to retain title to the world's longest sand sculpture.
   A continent away, Myrtle Beach officials conceded that the sand
castle its residents had created was only 26,834 feet, or 5.1 miles.
But the South Carolina sand builders didn't take defeat lying down
on the beach.
   ``We've decided we are going to go again _ (on the) Fourth of
July,'' said Eric Eiseland, spokesman for the Myrtle Beach Chamber
of Commerce. ``All we're saying is it'll be longer than 6.5 and less
than 100.''
   Shawa said he wasn't sure Long Beach was ready to rejoin the
battle in a month. ``We might let them hold the title, at least for
awhile,'' he said. ``We're a little sore in the knee from being in
the sand, we're a bit wind-burnt and, quite honestly, tired.''

   Resorts on opposite sides of the
continent are battling to build the world's longest sand sculpture
in a down and dirty fight.
   ``We shall fight them on the airwaves. We shall fight them in
the newspapers. Most importantly, we shall fight them on the
beaches,'' proclaimed a group of civic leaders in the tiny resort
community of Long Beach, Wash.
   A similar coalition of civic leaders in Myrtle Beach, S.C.,
issued a declaration of war.
   Last June, about 2,000 people carved a world-record sand
sculpture 15,063 feet long at Myrtle Beach. But the record fell in
July when Long Beach sculpted a sea serpent of 16,040 feet _ just
over three miles long.
   Myrtle Beach hopes to reclaim the record in a one-day attempt on
June 1, while Long Beach, a community of about 1,300 year-round
residents, begins work on a new sculpture May 31.
   Even before the first sand is turned, the contest has turned
gritty.
   Both cities have toll-free hotlines to muster support for the
battle and officials in Myrtle Beach, which has a year-round
population of 60,000, hope 5,000 will take part.
   Long Beach expects about 1,500, but that doesn't concern City
Manager Nabiel Shawa.
   ``One rugged Northwestern sand castle builder is worth a dozen
East Coasters,'' he said.

   All dressed up with no place to go, a covey
of cab drivers looked on as city officials hailed a new cabbie
dress code.
   ``What we have tried to do is make sure that cab drivers are
clean and neat, and that they don't have objectionable odors,''
City Councilman Joel Wachs told reporters at a downtown taxi stand.
   Effective Tuesday, the ordinance forbids cab drivers from
wearing tank tops, cut-off shorts and dirty clothes. White socks
are out. Thongs are out. Chest hair, displayed beyond the second
button, is out.
   Fines for dress code violations will be assessed by Traffic
Department inspectors to taxicab companies under a complex formula
that allows each company to amass a certain number of points before
penalties would be imposed.
   Hollywood fashion arbiter Mr. Blackwell said in a telephone
interview that he welcomed the change.
   ``I'm a little tired of getting into a cab, and they show up in
an undershirt, and they've got armpits hanging out,'' Mr. Blackwell
said.
   The cab drivers who watched the news event said they generally
accepted the dress code, although a few objected.
   Nicolas Castellanos, wearing a red satin tie with an L.A. Taxi
logo, shrugged as he said, ``If you don't like to dress well,
you're never going to do it.''

   Banks reopened, a trickle of mail was
delivered and trash collection resumed in this hurricane-battered
city Monday, but a cold downpour hindered efforts to restore power
and worsened damage to roofless homes.
   Two inches of rain fell, and temperatures were in the 60s. An 80
percent chance of showers was forecast for Tuesday.
   ``It's going to make it harder to accomplish anything, going to
make everything a little more miserable,'' said Kay Robinson, a
meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
   At Isle of Palms, a barrier island where martial law was
declared to preserve order, residents boarded ferries for their
first look at destruction wrought by Hugo since they were evacuated
Thursday. A bridge to the mainland and Charleston was wiped out.
   Residents were allowed to fill one suitcase each before they
were asked to leave again. The shattered houses made the one-time
seaside paradise look like a war zone.
   ``It looks like what happens after artillery fire,'' said Tom
Harper, a retired Air Force officer.
   Residents of Garden City were still unable to return to their
elite resort community on a 60-mile stretch of South Carolina's
coast known as the Grand Strand. The town's entrance was guarded by
National Guardsmen, but that did not prevent looting.
   ``There was a lady just filling her bags with stuff,'' said
shopowner Connie Brewer. ``I've caught people stealing here three
days straight. It's like stealing from a graveyard.''
   It was far from a normal workday in Charleston, where electrical
service was restored to hospitals but hot meals and water for
drinking and bathing was were still in short supply.
   Late Monday, Mayor Joseph P. Riley said the city's water system
was pumping potable water and 400,000 residents did not have to
continue boiling water before drinking it.
   The downpour hampered utility crews toiling to string power
lines. In homes already hit by Hugo's blustery winds, rainwater
compounded matters by seeping through damaged roofs in this
300-year-old city.
   ``There's a greater chance of problems with hot wires because of
the standing water,'' said Brian Duncan, a spokesman for South
Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Co. ``When it's wet, it just slows you
down.''
   Frustration grew in some of the hardest hit neighborhoods, where
residents patched damaged roofs with plastic sheeting to keep out
the rain.
   ``The whole town's going to be called `Hell Hole' soon. That's
what it's going to be, one big hell hole,'' complained Gerald Dean.
   Seven C&amp;S bank branches and automatic teller machines opened in
Charleston, allowing residents to cash checks to buy gas and other
supplies. Other branches opened along the coast.
   ``We've been out of money since Thursday,'' said Edith Myrick, a
customer who needed cash to buy gas and food.
   ``I thought of everything in the world to prepare for the storm,
but I didn't think of money,'' said Emmit Neal. ``We've got trees
to cut down and you've got to have money to pay folks.''
   John Jordan, a C&amp;S official in Charleston, said offices would be
open four hours a day until power is restored.
   ``If it hadn't have been for the rain, we would have been
swamped,'' he said. ``We have some locations where there are
literally lines out the doors.''
   Riley pleaded for donations of money, lumber, canned food,
disposable diapers and clothing. He set up a relief hot line.
``We've got a lot of people who are hurting here and they need our
help,'' he said.
   A curfew remained in effect for Myrtle Beach and Charleston,
where the National Guard patrolled with bayonetted M-16 rifles to
discourage looters. In North Carolina, about 550 National Guardsmen
patrolled, 350 of them in Mecklenburg County.
   Power was restored Monday to more than 200,000 people in the
Carolinas, but at least 546,000 remained without service. It could
be a month before full service is restored, utility officials said.
   The 12th strongest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland this
century slammed South Carolina with 135 mph winds late Thursday.
The six-day rampage of Hugo and its remnants killed at least 61
people _ at least 33 in the Caribbean and 28 in the United States.
   ``We're looking at damage between $1 and $2 billion,'' said Bob
Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables,
Fla. He toured the South Carolina coast Monday.
   State and local officials have estimated damage at $3 billion or
more.
   President Bush on Monday declared four inland North North
Carolina counties as disaster areas eligible for federal help. Bush
previously declared seven South Carolina counties disaster areas.
   Insurance agents went house-to-house, gathering estimates and
handing out claim checks.
   Some of Hugo's victims may not be able to rebuild under a state
law designed to curb beach erosion by limiting development. All
reconstruction and repairs close to the water will require a permit
from the South Carolina Coastal Council.
   ``We are considering an order that will allow people to repair
houses provided they are less than 66 and two-thirds (percent)
damaged,'' administrator Steve Moore said. The council will send
crews out to confirm the damage before work can begin.
   In Sumter, 180 miles inland, residents suffered through a fourth
day without electricity, water and food.
   ``We don't know what's going on, when we'll get help,'' Kelly
Brown said. ``We've had grits for the children for two days, but
the Sterno's giving out.''
   In Myrtle Beach, beaches were off limits because of
contamination from sewage. The problem was blamed on residents who
refuse to conserve water.
   ``People just can't shower until they utterly can't stand each
other,'' said Pat Dowling, a city spokesman. ``They should also
avoid flushing until it's absolutely necessary. If people don't
cooperate, we'll have to turn the water off.''
   The storm also took its toll on more than half of the state's
cotton crop, leveled much of the corn fields and put the soybean
harvest in doubt, officials said. Agricultural losses were
estimated at $45 million to $50 million.

   Newspapers in cities pummeled by Hurricane
Hugo found the storm was a journalist's dream and a publisher's
nightmare as they labored to get out the big story without power,
water or passable roads.
   Most papers in the storm's path through South Carolina managed
to keep printing, but it wasn't easy.
   In Columbia, The State newspaper temporarily housed two other
papers. The staff of the Charleston papers didn't go home for
several nights. In Myrtle Beach, The Sun News staff used portable
toilets because the city sewers were out of commission.
   ``We got the paper out (Friday) and have been doing it ever
since,'' said Bob Hawkins, an editor at The News and Courier and
The Evening Post in hard-hit Charleston.
   ``A couple of nights everyone slept on the floor at the
newspaper,'' Hawkins said. ``We didn't smell too good.''
   The newspaper's emergency generator provided enough electricity
to run the printing press, computers and a few lights, but the
staff was still without running water Monday.
   Hugo struck South Carolina late Thursday, killing at least 17
people and leaving more than $3 billion in damage.
   Some papers were able to gather and print the information their
readers needed to cope during the storm's aftermath, but couldn't
manage delivery.
   In Georgetown, 10-foot waves lapped up against the windows of
the Georgetown Times. Two delivery vans were swallowed up, and
employees delivered the paper in their own cars.
   Saturday's paper was delayed one day because the newspaper
building was blacked out Friday.
   The storm was ``a journalist's dream, but at the same time a
nightmare,'' said Ralph Parkman, publisher of the thrice-weekly.
   The copy editing staff of The Sun News in Myrtle Beach was sent
140 miles to Columbia to work on Friday and Saturday editions at
The State, a sister newspaper. Deadlines were moved up, but
carriers still weren't able to deliver to all subscribers because
some roads were inaccessible.
   To conserve water, Publisher Michael Pate ordered some unusual
equipment for the office.
   ``We had to bring in porta-potties,'' he said.
   The State newspaper had to restart its presses a few times
because of power fluctuations, managing editor Bobby Hitt said. The
paper also housed some members of The Sun News staff and helped the
Charleston paper paste up its pages.
   The Item in Sumter couldn't publish Friday or Saturday because
the power was off and no generators were available, managing editor
Graham Osteen said.
   ``Everyone was totally immobilized. We couldn't even get out of
town to produce a paper,'' he said.
   The staff printed its Sunday and Monday papers at The Times and
Democrat, 85 miles away in Orangeburg.
   ``The response we've been getting is people were unbelievably
grateful to get a paper'' Sunday, Osteen said. ``They've had very
little information.''
   Most radio and television stations in the area were off the air
for a few days following the storm.
   The Island Packet in Hilton Head, which is printed at The
Gazette, had problems getting carriers to deliver its Friday
edition because the island had been evacuated.
   Then again, ``we had no one to deliver it to Friday morning,''
editor Fran Smith said.

Hurricane Hugo and its remnants:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SOUTH CAROLINA:
   Charleston _ At least 17 deaths reported, with damage estimated
at $1 billion or more. About 50,000 people in the area were still
out of their homes today. A dusk-to-dawn curfew remained in effect.
Charleston Harbor reopened to limited ship traffic Tuesday. Power
was restored to about 20 percent of customers.
   Columbia _ Trees and power lines down. 25,000 people remained
without electricity Tuesday.
   Isle of Palms and Sullivan's Island _ Residents continued to
return home Tuesday by boat, but under police escort and only to
look at their homes and collect a few belongings before returning
to mainland. Downed power lines and trees and leaking propane gas
create a dangerous situation. The only bridge to the mainland was
washed out.
   Garden City _ Among the hardest hit areas. Water surged as much
as three blocks inland. Electricity was restored to most of the
city by Tuesday.
   Hilton Head _ Less damage than expected, mostly roof and water
damage. Some broken windows, downed trees and power lines.
   Murrells Inlet _ A marina and dock destroyed, as well as several
homes. Most of the town had electricity restored Tuesday.
   Myrtle Beach _ Damage estimated at more than $600 million in
Horry County. High-rise motels remain standing, but swimming pools,
first-floor lobbies, restaurants and parking lots are damaged. Some
hotels and motels reopened Monday, but a curfew remained in effect.
   Pawleys Island _ Entire island without electricity, but most of
mainland had power restored Tuesday. At least 14 homes destroyed.
   Rock Hill _ Damage estimated at $11 million in York County.
Electricity still out in several areas.
   Sumter _ Damage estimated at more than $100 million in Sumter
County. Sixteen houses and 160 trailers destroyed, about 900 suffer
major damage. Seventy-five percent of the people still without
power or water.

   People caught by Hurricane Hugo last
year might disagree, but forecasters here say the deadly storm may
have had a positive side effect _ it got the public's attention.
   And one forecaster says hurricane seasons may be getting worse.
   Hugo, which caused an unprecedented $10 billion in damage,
killed 28 people in the Lesser Antilles islands and an additional
29 in South Carolina.
   But it would have been much more deadly if it had hit almost
anywhere else, says Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane
Center.
   At the advent of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from
June 1 to Nov. 30, Sheets and other hurricane experts are using
Hugo's example to get the attention of complacent coastal residents
who've never experienced such fury.
   ``We'll take advantage of the fact that there was a Hugo last
year and raise people's awareness,'' said Sheets. ``The
consequences of not being prepared are too great.''
   Early warnings about Hugo last September allowed 350,000 people
to evacuate safely, and in South Carolina the worst of the
hurricane struck the Francis Marion National Forest between
Charleston and Myrtle Beach, Sheets said.
   It heavily damaged the fishing village of McClellanville and
several small rural communities, but the population there is sparse.
   If Hugo had struck a major coastal population center, the
destruction would have been greater than most Americans have ever
seen, according to computer simulations known as SLOSH models, for
Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes.
   With SLOSH, forecasters can predict the height of the storm
surge _ the mass of water piled up by the storm that is a
hurricane's most destructive component _ anywhere along the U.S.
coast by punching in a storm's speed, size and intensity, Sheets
said.
   ``The population density in South Carolina is a lot different
from the Florida coast, New Jersey or Galveston, Texas,'' Sheets
said. ``Compare that situation to the Miami-through-Palm Beach area
_ all of Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties would have been ...
destroyed.''
   Hugo was the worst hurricane to strike the southeastern U.S.
coast since Betsy hit the Florida Keys in 1965, killing 74 before
it went on to Missisippi and Louisiana. Since then, the population
of areas such as south Florida has ballooned and most residents
have never directly experienced a hurricane.
   According to one of the nation's leading hurricane experts, Hugo
may have been the first in a new era of killer storms.
   ``No one knows for sure, but the odds are, Florida and the East
Coast are going to get it,'' William Gray, professor of atmospheric
science at Colorado State University, told a national conference of
weather experts this month.
   Gray came to this conclusion after his usually accurate
predictions for hurricane activity were off the mark last year. He
had figured the 1989 season would be relatively mild, with only
four hurricanes; instead, seven hurricanes and four tropical storms
killed a total of 84 people.
   ``He blew it pretty bad,'' Sheets said. ``But then he looked at
the rainfall over Africa, and found an amazing correlation between
rainfall there and hurricane activity over Florida.''
   Gray realized the 30-year drought in Africa's Sahel region
corresponds almost exactly to the years when no major hurricanes
have struck the southeastern coast.
   ``Whether one causes the other is uncertain. They both may
reflect larger-scale events. But the Sahel is now getting up to
near-normal rainfall,'' Sheets said.
   Gray plans to release his predictions for 1990 on June 5.
   Tropical storms have been recorded in the Atlantic in every
month except April, but are rare outside the June 1 to Nov. 30
season. Last week, a preseason tropical depression brought heavy
rain to Cuba.
   A tropical depression becomes a tropical storm and is given a
name if its sustained winds reach 39 mph; it becomes a hurricane if
winds reach 74 mph.
   The names for Atlantic hurricanes and tropical storms this year
are: Arthur, Bertha, Cesar, Diana, Edouard, Fran, Gustav, Hortense,
Isidore, Josephine, Klaus, Lili, Marco, Nana, Omar, Paloma, Rene,
Sally, Teddy, Vicky and Wilfred.

   Army engineers raised a bridge dangling
at a 45-degree angle in the water today in an effort to restore the
link to two islands cut off from the South Carolina mainland by
Hurricane Hugo 13 days ago.
   High tide this morning helped lift the 500,000-ton bridge, and
workers used a crane to restore it to its stand.
   Officials said they hoped to have the ends of the Ben Sawyer
Bridge connected to the road later in the day so that it could be
inspected and reopened to traffic Thursday to hurricane-devastated
Sullivan's Island and the Isle of Palms.
   Without the bridge, building and cleaning supplies have had to
be flown or ferried over in boats.
   ``The people just wanted to get back in their homes and get
started digging out,'' said Melvin Anderegg, mayor of Sullivan's
Island. ``Everywhere you look over there, people are cleaning up
and moving things.''
   The Coast Guard had to turn away dozens of boaters who filled
the waterway to watch the bridge repair. Officials nevertheless
were eager for the public to know that life is returning to normal
in an area that boasts 60 miles of beaches and attracted 10 million
visitors last year.
   More than 1,000 truckloads of debris a day are being removed
from Charleston, the city where the Civil War began.
   ``We've bounced back from Hurricane Hugo and visitors should not
cancel their plans to come to Charleston but should come right
ahead,'' said Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr., who wore a T-shirt saying
``Charleston S.C. We're Going Strong.''
   The mayor said Tuesday that 90 percent of the city's hotels have
reopened, and a 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew should be lifted shortly.
   Criticism of federal relief efforts continued along with the
recovery.
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., called for the General Accounting
Office, Congress' watchdog agency, to investigate the
``incompetent'' work of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   Hollings again complained that the agency has not opened enough
offices in the 22 South Carolina counties declared a federal
disaster area. There are about 10 offices opened in those areas.
   FEMA spokesman Bill McAda said he would welcome an
investigation, and said the agency was fulfilling its role of
aiding long-term recovery.
   ``I believe we're doing that and under the circumstances doing
it as fast as it can be expected to be done,'' he said.
   That view was seconded by Marilyn Quayle, the vice president's
wife, who helped at disaster and American Red Cross centers in
Charleston on Tuesday.
   ``From what I've been able to observe, FEMA, very frankly, got a
bum rap,'' she said.
   The agency has 350 workers in South Carolina to process
applications from people seeking low-interest loans and grants to
rebuild homes and businesses.
   Hurricane Hugo roared into the South Carolina coast Sept. 21,
leaving at least 18 dead, 50,000 homeless, 270,000 jobless, and a
swath of damage extending into North Carolina. In all, 29 people
were killed on the U.S. mainland.
   Damage in South Carolina alone has been estimated at at least $3
billion.
   In the community of Murrells Inlet about 10 miles south of
Myrtle Beach, author Mickey Spillane examined the wreckage of his
home and office, where he has written detective novels since 1963.
   One section of a wall was gone, and first editions of his books,
including ``I, The Jury,'' and ``My Gun is Quick,'' had
disappeared, as well as a manuscript in progress. But the author
wasn't too upset.
   ``Hey, not to worry,'' he said. ``I'll make (the manuscript) up
in two weeks, ... maybe three. That's how long it takes to write a
book.''

   Myrtle Beach may have been rated the
East Coast's tackiest tourist spot, but the owner of a miniature
golf course sporting pink flamingo and gorilla statues says such
attractions represent good, clean fun.
   The book, ``The Worst of Everything,'' also rates Los Angeles
the tackiest vacation spot in the West and gives Panama City, Fla.,
that distinction for the Gulf Coast.
   Al Tirrell, owner of Jungle Golf, called the tacky label ``the
most outrageous lies I've ever heard.''
   ``It's a family beach. We're newer, we're cleaner, Tirrell said.
   Vacationer Charlie Jolley, of Mars Hill, N.C., was sympathetic.
``I'd much rather see the plain beach, but you don't come here
expecting it all to be coconut palms,'' Jolley said Tuesday.
   The book's author, Don Lessem, asked authorities in dozens of
fields for their opinions on the worst.

<DATELINE>LUTHERVILLE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An elementary school principal paid off
an unusual bet with pupils by donning a tuxedo and bow-tie and
eating a lunch of pizza and cola atop the school's sun-drenched
roof.
   Below, on the school grounds of Lutherville-Timonium Elementary
School, 500 pupils shouted triumphantly, ``Eat, eat, eat.''
   The scene Tuesday was an odd victory celebration for the
students, who were challenged at the beginning of the school year
by principal Fred Brown to read 1 million pages by the end of the
school year.
   The prospect of seeing him eat lunch on the roof of the school
was the reward.
   ``We're not sure whether it (Brown's offer) was a flip remark,''
said librarian Doris Glotzbach. ``But we picked up on it and
wouldn't let it go.''
   There were doubts about whether the students could get through
enough books to reach the goal, but the chance of putting Brown on
the roof apparently proved incentive enough.
   ``It did the job as far as motivating students to read,'' said
fifth-grade teacher Dennis Kimmel. ``They were carrying around
books with them all the time.''

   Low-lying and coastal areas near Fernandina Beach on the northern
Florida coast next to Georgia were under a voluntary evacuation.
   Predictions called for tropical-storm force winds and less than 5
inches of rain.
   Three nursing homes were evacuated in Fernandina Beach, and
patients were moved out of Nassau General Hospital on Amelia Island.
Schools in Nassau and Duval counties were closed. Most busineses in
Fernandina Beach closed Thursday afternoon.
   Shelters were set up in Jacksonville but civil defense
authorities did not plan evacuations.
   Surfers headed into the bigger than normal waves at Jacksonville
Beach.

McIntosh counties.
   Thousands fled barrier islands and coastal areas.
Bumper-to-bumper traffic stretched at least 30 miles inland from
Savannah. Hotels and motels were booked to capacity in Savannah and
as far inland as Statesboro and Hinesville.
   Coastal school systems canceled class for the rest of the week.
   The National Weather Service said the storm was taking a gradual
northward turn, with the eye headed toward Myrtle Beach, S.C.,
indicating Georgia would be spared the brunt of the storm.
   Authorities still expected flooding, but less damage.
   Officials at Georgia Southern planned to play their game Thursday
night against Middle Tennessee State at Savannah, Ga.

   Gov. Carroll Campbell ordered a mandatory evacuation of coastal
barrier islands and shorefront, and dispatched national guardsmen to

   In Charleston, City Hall was boarded up, businesses were closed
and classes at public schools and universities canceled.
   Hospitals in Charleston stockpiled supplies, discharging patients
well enough to go home and moving others to hospitals inland. At one
hospital, officials also prepared for an influx of maternity
patients, since some studies indicate that low atmospheric pressure
could advance labor.

   Evacuations were ordered or recommended for six counties on North
Carolina's coast. Residents of barrier islands and low lying areas
within a half mile of the Intracoastal Waterway were told to
evacuate.
   A flood watch was in effect for the entire state and a tornado
watch was issued for parts of central and eastern North Carolina.
   Shelters were open and a curfew was declared from 7 p.m. until
further notice at Wrightsville Beach. Other evacuated areas were
under 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfews.
   Residents bought tape, lamp oil, flashlights, bottled water and
other necessities. Plywood sold briskly to be used in boarding
windows and doors. Other hot items were flashlights, ice chests and
batteries.

   Morris Dweck was counting on the
allure of the Middle East to drum up business when he added a
roadside genie and changed the name of his miniature golf course to
``Treasures of Baghdad.''
   The changes, made well before the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, have not proved popular in the vicinity of Myrtle Beach Air
Force Base.
   ``We've had this place for eight years, and up to this year, it
was known as the Golden Dragon,'' Dweck said of his 36-hole course
at a prime location across from a water park. ``Now we don't have
anybody at all during the day, and only an occasional person at
night, when it's supposed to be the most crowded.''
   Dweck spent $15,000 on a fancy ``Treasures of Baghdad'' sign and
added a roadside turbaned genie sitting cross-legged with a bobbing
head.
   Around town, one of the hottest-selling souvenirs is a T-shirt
featuring a likeness of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein above the line
``Public Enemy Number One.'' The Air Force base sent several A-10
jets to Saudi Arabia.
   ``It's been tough in a few other ways, too,'' Dweck said. ``A
man and his family came by not long ago, got ready to play and
asked us which Arabian country we were from.
   ``I told him we were Jewish and from New York, and he
immediately packed his family up and left,'' he said. ``He was from
Jordan.''

   Vice President George Bush stumped in
South Carolina Monday, saying Sen. Strom Thurmond's endorsement of
rival Bob Dole raises the stakes in the state's March 5 Republican
presidential primary.
   ``I have great respect for Sen. Thurmond,'' said Bush. ``It's
going to make this an even more dramatic ground of confrontation.''
   The South Carolina GOP primary comes just three days before the
Super Tuesday round of contests in 20 other, mostly Southern
states. The four Republican candidates have said their showing in
South Carolina will be crucial leading into Super Tuesday.
   During a three-hour visit to Myrtle Beach, Bush spoke briefly at
a civic club luncheon, addressed about 1,200 students and visitors
at Myrtle Beach High School and then held a series of meetings with
reporters.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell, the chairman of Bush's Southern campaign
accompanied the vice president and said the Dole campaign has
``created a do-or-die situation'' by pushing for the South Carolina
senator's endorsement.
   ``Everybody loves Strom Thurmond, I love Strom Thurmond. I think
they've raised the stakes. They've said, `Now we've got him; now
we're going to win,''' Campbell said.
   Bush called South Carolina ``a key state'' and campaign aides
said he will likely spend at least four more days campaigning in
the state prior to March 5.
   Bush, with reporters in tow, stopped briefly at a luncheon
meeting of the Myrtle Beach Rotary Club at a local seafood
restaurant.
   ``I think I'm going to win in South Carolina,'' Bush said. ``If
I win in South Carolina, I will be the next president of the United
States.''
   Bush flew to the state from Texas, before heading on for
additional stops in Tennessee and Missouri.
   The visit came on the eve of caucuses in Minnesota and a primary
in South Dakota, but Bush said, ``You've got limited resources and
we've allocated to Super Tuesday and South Carolina.''

Environmental change -- from polluted streams to congested highways and 
overdeveloped land -- is affecting the quality of life across the nation. Such 
change is gradual and often goes unnoticed while it happens. 
</P>
<P>
 To measure how various areas have been affected over the decades, The Times 
dispatched reporters to the places where they grew up. This occasional series 
of articles examines how our hometown environments have been altered -- for 
better or for worse. 
</P>
<P>
Farmer James Mishoe does not have time to change out of his Sunday suit and tie 
before he drives his pickup the 12 miles north from Salem African Methodist 
Episcopal Church to this small town. 
</P>
<P>
"Got to work every day," he says, unloading turnips, collards and sweet 
potatoes at his produce stand in the shade of a tall oak tree in the heart of 
Conway's black community. 
</P>
<P>
Mishoe, 59, is on the board of stewards at Salem Church in the town of 
Bucksport, but the troubles he has seen would test the faith of even a 
presiding elder. 
</P>
<P>
His wife's failing health, the end of his family's tradition of tobacco 
farming, the threat of foreclosure on his property and a fire at his farmhouse 
in 1975 have all transformed his way of life. 
</P>
<P>
But, in a way, Mishoe is lucky. He has made a living selling produce since the 
decline of the tobacco market of the 1970s. But now he is intimately bound to 
another habit-forming, some say addicting, pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists. 
</P>
<P>
After unloading part of his produce and leaving his youngest son, Roger, at the 
cash register, Mishoe will drive 14 more miles southeast on Highway 501 to 
Myrtle Beach, for his livelihood is now tied to how much fresh produce he can 
sell from his truck directly to restaurants catering to the tourist trade 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Mishoe moved to Conway while trying to find money to rebuild his farmhouse. Few 
things are the same in Conway, he says, since tourism came. 
</P>
<P>
He's right. I know; I was raised here. 
</P>
<P>
Conway is a little town in the eastern part of South Carolina. Its shift from 
Southern rural backwater to Yankee tourist attraction has begun to put pressure 
on its environment. Developers are bulldozing surrounding forests and farmlands 
for commercial and residential development, pleasure boaters are polluting 
nearby rivers, and population growth -- including many Northern retirees -- is 
causing unease in an area unused to urban congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more subtly, the region's old rural, laissez-faire attitudes, which 
didn't see much wrong with burning trash in the back yard, dumping liquid waste 
in the ground or filling in the wetlands that channel storm runoff, are under 
serious challenge today. And government, so far, has seemed unable to develop 
the infrastructure -- such things as sewers and roads -- quickly enough to 
support the growth. 
</P>
<P>
Conway, population 13,576, is the seat of Horry County (pronounced Oh-REE), 
population 137,989. The county is shaped like a fat slice of sweet potato pie 
and is part of the Pee Dee River Basin, an area of nearly 7,700 square miles, 
about one-fourth of the state. 
</P>
<P>
Six rivers crisscross the basin like veins and arteries on the back of a hand. 
These rivers generally flow southeast, emptying 10.5 billion gallons of water a 
day into the Atlantic Ocean. One of the rivers, the Waccamaw, meanders slowly 
past downtown Conway. 
</P>
<P>
When Hurricane Hugo came ashore in South Carolina last September, the Waccamaw 
briefly flooded its banks. "There was also an awful lot of debris in the 
streets," said Conway city planner Steve Tanner. But there was little permanent 
damage and only a few injuries, caused by downed electrical wires. 
</P>
<P>
"A mugging in downtown Conway would be a major event," said Bill Keeling, 
director of the county museum on Main Street at the edge of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Huge oak trees shade narrow, quiet streets throughout Conway. Such scenes 
appear on brochures now to attract tourists, residents and businesses. "Anybody 
threatens to cut one branch off an oak tree, you get the whole town up in 
arms," said Evelyn Snyder, 82, one of the town's unofficial historians. 
</P>
<P>
The town's black community, where I lived, built its churches and barber shops 
on a street ironically named Race Path and educated its children at a high 
school ironically named after a Boston carpetbagger. The iron web of 
segregation forced the black community (Conway is about 34% black) to shape 
itself around care and concern of its members, one for the other. 
</P>
<P>
I remember that tobacco also shaped the black community. Attendance at the 
all-black Whittemore High School would drop precipitously every 
tobacco-harvesting season. The planters demanded child labor to raise the crop 
out of the sandy gray soil and into the curing sheds. Desperately poor parents 
worked the fields beside their children. 
</P>
<P>
No more. 
</P>
<P>
"One time, boys made $20 a day cropping tobacco. What tobacco field can you 
crop today?" asked Eutrelia P. Dozier, another local historian and librarian at 
Whittemore, now restructured and renamed West Conway Middle School. She is at 
the same school, still the librarian, as she has been since 1954. 
</P>
<P>
Says farmer Mishoe: "When I came home (from military service) in 1960 and went 
to the farm, I sold tobacco for 75 cents a pound. At that time, fertilizer was 
running a $1 1/2 for 100 pounds, or $3 for 200 pounds. Then, in 1979, I sold 
tobacco for 75 cents a pound, and fertilizer was $6 or $10 for 100 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
He gave up in 1981. "Tobacco farming? That's out." 
</P>
<P>
Downtown, the tractors and pickup trucks around which people used to gather and 
talk have been replaced by cars just passing through on their way to Coastal 
Mall, near the northern edge of town. 
</P>
<P>
Now, private and public agencies have started a project called Main Street 
U.S.A. to revitalize downtown and to draw tourists by highlighting its 
"small-town" atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Last May 17, Mayor Ike G. Long Jr. mounted a bulldozer near downtown where the 
Waccamaw River flows, tore a plug of dirt from a temporary earthen dam and 
water from the river rushed into the town's 71-boat marina to mark its official 
opening. The marina is part of a planned 35 1/2-acre riverfront development 
with shops, restaurants, condominiums, office complexes and a boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
Travel-related spending in Horry County for 1987 was $1.4 billion, according to 
the U.S. Travel Data Center, far larger than any other county in the state. 
</P>
<P>
The same year, agriculture in the county generated only $90 million in 
expenditures, said Jack Hutchinson of the South Carolina development board, 
which is responsible for bringing new industry and business to the state. 
</P>
<P>
Myrtle Beach, where Mishoe sells much of his produce, and Conway began to 
interest tourists and retirees when the gasoline crisis hit in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Then, people from the North heading to Florida, their gas tanks running low, 
began to notice South Carolina, Hutchinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism and the growth it has brought have compelled Conway's officials to 
focus on the natural wetlands in the riverfront district between downtown and 
the Waccamaw River. These areas help protect the town's ecosystem, city planner 
Tanner said. 
</P>
<P>
"Cars park in parking lots, trucks park in parking lots, rain comes and the 
runoff goes into the Waccamaw River. . . . Well, if we route drainage through 
the wetlands, it will act as a filtering system for the pollutants, before it 
gets to the river. . . . The water quality of the Waccamaw probably will be one 
of the biggest items that will . . . determine the growth of Conway," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There are other problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Boat owners are horrendous polluters," said Robert Windhager, treasurer of a 
local chapter of the Sierra Club. "They toss shoes, paper, plastic plates" into 
the Waccamaw, "not to mention the gas and oil spills" from their boat engines, 
which threaten local aquaculture, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Such problems are not new to the area. Although Conway itself has had zoning 
laws for years, "Horry County didn't have zoning laws until October, 1988," 
Tanner said. The result? "Around somebody's house you get (an animal) pound on 
one side and an auto repair shop on the other, and the well water starts 
tasting funny and the people get sick," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, "We'll probably be 20 years behind on river and wetlands laws. 'Let's let 
in all the developers and then we'll write a (water protection) law that nobody 
likes,' " he mused. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the town grows. "In 1980, the census showed Conway with 10,240 
people," Mayor Long said. "They say that by the year 2005 Conway, and . . . a 
3-mile radius around Conway, will have 65,000 people. . . . We're annexing 
property coming and going." 
</P>
<P>
Retired people moving south find a slower pace and a lower cost of living here, 
Long said. Upscale joggers in the newer Kingston Lake residential section of 
town run along tree-shaded roads near two-story brick homes with wide lawns. 
</P>
<P>
But, not far away, mobile home salesmen at "independent living centers" sell 
"double-wides" to the less-well-heeled. "Your New Home -- $11,600," one sign 
says. That's the selling price, not the down payment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Areas Resist 
</P>
<P>
Although much of downtown Conway has resisted many of the changes, other areas 
have not. 
</P>
<P>
"You used to be able to drive 501 all the way to Myrtle Beach and see nothing 
but woods," said Reggie Daves of the local Audubon Society. "You can't do that 
anymore. Now you see tire stores, motorcycle shops . . . food places, filling 
stations, golf courses." 
</P>
<P>
Farmers not in the path of development are caught between low land values, 
payments on the mortgage and equipment and the temptation to sell to 
developers, said Draxal Strickland, organizer of the local chapter of the 
United Farmers Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Long adds: "A farmer today could do better if he runs water and sewer 
lines into his property and rents it out as a mobile home park." 
</P>
<P>
Farmer Mishoe's produce stand is right across Highway 501 from Cherry Hill 
Baptist Church, the sanctuary of my youth. On many Sunday mornings after 
service these days, church-goers try to get to Mishoe's stand by crossing 501 
at the light there while beach-goers are streaming down 501 to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the traffic lights change (for crossing 501) for only about three or 
four seconds," said Rev. H. H. Singleton, pastor of the church and head of the 
Conway branch of the NAACP. "People have begun to seek alternative routes, to 
see if they can go down (to a major intersection) and come back up, you see. 
And that's what most of them do." 
</P>
<P>
Tourism thus shapes Conway's quality of life, because the traffic on Highway 
501 shows how much the town lives in the shadow of Myrtle Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Golf courses, resort hotels, beaches, topless bars, crowding and escalating 
land values have put the beach city on the map. That bothers a lot of Conway 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
"Horry County has one of the largest black bear populations in South Carolina; 
there are predatory birds by the millions, but along that beach it's like 
Southern New Jersey," museum director Keeling said. "I have seen traffic backed 
up from Myrtle Beach back through Conway to the county line. . . . One solid 
traffic jam." 
</P>
<P>
To ease beach traffic jams, the state highway department plans to build a 
bypass on Highway 501 around Conway. But a possible route is through prime land 
in private hands, including large tracts owned by International Paper Co. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Long said that the highway department "doesn't want to mess up the bears 
and snakes and alligators and Venus flytraps, so they plan to build a bridge 10 
miles long over the woods . . . at a cost of about 10 times more per mile than 
a regular bridge." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trash Problem Grows 
</P>
<P>
As tourism has grown, the trash problem has also become a major concern. 
</P>
<P>
The Horry County landfill is 5 miles southeast of Conway. All non-hazardous 
waste throughout the county is delivered to the 200-acre site, said Philip 
Barnhill, county director of waste management. (Hazardous waste is supposed to 
be shipped 85 miles east to the Pinewood hazardous waste dump in Sumter 
County.) 
</P>
<P>
One day recently, worn tires were aflame in the tire-dump area in the heart of 
the landfill, giving off thick, acrid smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Mildred Lewis, a resident of Horseshoe, a community just north of the facility, 
believes the landfill is the reason for many illnesses in her neighborhood. 
Recently, she drove through her community of small houses and double-wide 
mobile homes on dirt yards with tall pines and talked about her neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"That woman live there? Her grandson is on disability; been on disability for 
eight years; he ain't but 18. . . . That lady's got cancer; so's her son. . . . 
That man who used to live there died at 43 from a heart attack." 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, the state Department of Health and Environmental Control 
investigated such health claims and found that the problems weren't caused by 
the landfill, according to Barnhill. 
</P>
<P>
The idea that the landfill meets health department standards makes some of the 
state's leading environmentalists laugh. At a conference last summer in 
Columbia, the state capital, they adopted a resolution that said the 
department's environmental standards are so low that the agency "should be 
abolished" if it does not improve. 
</P>
<P>
Some other possible improvements are within reach. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental consultant Marsh suggests that developers should pay higher fees 
for hidden costs, such as road repair and increased sewer maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh said that an associate who looked into the state laws came away 
"horrified at the lax requirements for new roads in South Carolina." 
</P>
<P>
The Audubon Society's Reggie Daves says that citizens need to take more 
independent civic action on environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
A report commissioned by the county government said that the county must 
diversify its industry, improve agriculture and aquaculture technology and 
develop a European trade office, so that there will be less dependence on 
tourism. 
</P>
<P>
But some solutions are not local. "We're going to have to change our throwaway 
society into one that recycles," said County Administrator M. L. Love. "I don't 
think Horry County does any better or worse than any other county in dealing 
with trash. . . . L.A. has the same problem I have." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Crises Loom 
</P>
<P>
Other national solutions are also required, because two major environmental 
crises are on the horizon. The Pinewood dump in nearby Sumter County, the 
state's only site for hazardous wastes, is inadequate and dangerous, said Carol 
Boykin, vice president of Citizens Asking for a Safe Environment, situated in 
Sumter city. Some companies may be tempted to dump such wastes illegally in the 
state's vast rivers and forests, she said. 
</P>
<P>
And the troubled Savannah River nuclear weapons materials plant in Barnwell 
County has been shut down partly because of poor handling of its radioactive 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
Both of those huge facilities are in poor sections of South Carolina counties 
that do not have much political power, Boykin said. "We're being treated like 
Third World nations," she said: Dangerous materials nobody wants are being 
dumped in places few have heard of. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism and other transformations have hit Conway hard. 
</P>
<P>
But "tourism itself is not bad," Keeling concludes. He sees a parallel, though, 
in the quick-up, quick-down experience of oil boom towns, which have fallen on 
hard times recently. "Tourists are like oil with legs," he said. They are a 
boon for a time, but what if they stop coming? 
</P>
<P>
Changes in Conway that did not hit hard hit fast. 
</P>
<P>
"Thirty-five years ago, people were plowing with mules here," Keeling said. "My 
father-in-law can remember riding on riverboats on the Waccamaw River." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Keeling would not suggest that Conway should be stuck in the 19th Century. 
Indeed, anyone can see there are plenty of reasons for this small town to move 
to the 21st Century. But it will take extraordinary leadership, cooperation, 
sacrifice, creativity and vision for Conway to completely skip the 20th.

<TEXT>
   The clock on St. Michael's Episcopal
Church is still missing its gold hands _ mute testimony to the 135
mph winds of Hurricane Hugo that passed this way six months ago.
   But just as yellow-green leaves have sprouted on trees stripped
bare by leviathan winds, South Carolina is mending after the worst
storm to batter its coast in centuries.
   Hugo smashed ashore at Charleston on Sept. 21, killing 29
people, leaving thousands temporarily homeless and thousands more
without electricity for weeks. With damage estimated at $5.9
billion, it was most costly hurricane to ever hit the U.S. mainland.
   Now spring has come around. Horse-drawn carriages drift through
downtown. Azaleas bloom behind wrought-iron fences. The historic
district is cleared of debris and tourist attractions have long
since reopened.
   But in outlying areas, on the sea islands northeast of town, and
in Sumter, 90 miles inland, recovery has been slower, even as
volunteers from across the nation continue to donate time, money
and energy to help in the recovery.
   Leroy Miller, a Mennonite volunteer from Weatherford, Okla., who
arrived in Charleston on Jan. 9, has helped replace roofs on 35
homes through the county's Raise the Roof program. There are still
200 people on a waiting list.
   ``People have a problem understanding why we would do this
without pay,'' Miller said. ``I don't know what to tell them. It's
just another way of reaching out to humanity.''
   Among those he helped was Harriett Yates, who after the
hurricane was forced to make do with a blue tarp to cover the roof
of her tiny, five-room house.
   ``I appreciate it,'' she said. ``I couldn't have done it without
them.''
   On nearby Sullivans Island, which was home to 2,500 people, many
buildings crushed in the 12-foot tidal surge that accompanied the
hurricane still await the bulldozer's blade, and piles of
hurricane-related debris await pickup.
   Julie Britt lost her home, but she moved into an apartment
rather than leave the island.
   ``I have never felt a love of place as much as I love this
place,'' she said. ``The way we deal with it is a blessed amnesia
in which you don't remember how it looked before.''
   On the Isle of Palms, where damage was estimated at $100
million, only about half the 3,500 residents have returned, and
some never will. Mayor Carmen Bunch said many older residents
already were pinched by rising living costs.
   Rebuilding continues slowly in hard-hit McClellanville, where
the shrimping industry was decimated, and farther north in the
resort community of Pawleys Island, which was cut in half by the
hurricane's tidal surge.
   And in many poorer areas, jobs were lost when marginal
businesses were forced to close because of storm damage and
disruption. Marvin Lare, executive director of the South Carolina
Institute on Poverty and Deprivation, said the storm could push
more than 180,000 people in the state below the poverty level.
   In Charlotte, N.C., 200 miles inland, workers still are picking
up tree limbs, brush and other debris at the rate of 32 truckloads
a day, said Linda Sherrill, a spokeswoman for the city. Electrical
crews continue to erect utility poles in a city that was left
virtually powerless after the storm.
   The Charleston council approved a temporary 14 percent property
tax increase to cover storm expenses and make up for declining
collections.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency distributed nearly $100
million to help individuals cover uninsured losses. But, as in any
relief operation, there have been problems.
   FEMA spokesman Frank Mosco said about $500,000 was returned
after the agency discovered people received money they were not
entitled to. As many as 130 people who failed to respond to FEMA
letters asking for repayments could face criminal charges, he said.
   In Carolina forests, crews are using tractors, helicopters and
mule teams to clear thousands of splintered trees. An estimated 1
billion board feet of timber _ 4.4 million acres _ was toppled, a
blow to the $4.3 billion-a-year industry.
   Larry Edmond of the U.S. Forest Service said crews hope to
salvage at least 25 percent of the downed timber. An acre of forest
normally has 3 tons to 20 tons of fuel in the form of fallen
timber. Many spots of forest in the Carolinas have 200 to 1,000
tons per acre of drying debris, officials said.
   South Carolina's $5 billion tourism industry is gearing up amid
optimism that business this summer will be as strong as ever.
Myrtle Beach escaped the brunt of the storm and Hilton Head Island,
another popular resort, was unscathed. Even with the storm, tourism
rose 4 percent last year, the state tourism department says.
   Advertisements promoting the state make no mention of Hugo or
the aftermath. But there are some who believe that such silence is
unneeded, that articles about the state's recovery will be do
nothing but help the economy.
   ``We've had so much additional exposure on Charleston in the
positive sense,'' said Helen Stansell of the Charleston Trident
Chamber of Commerce. ``South Carolina is going strong and coming
back.''

   A state of emergency was declared Sunday in Florida because of
the record cold wave, which stranded travelers and overloaded power
plants and gave parts of the South their first white Christmas in
more than a century.
   Snow drifts stood up to 8 feet high in South Carolina, and
Wilmington, N.C., recorded its greatest snowfall ever _ at least 15
inches. The blizzard caused a 600-foot Navy tanker to run aground
on North Carolina's Outer Banks.
   But warmer weather moved eastward with temperatures hitting 40
at Chamberlain, S.D., and Minneapolis warmed into the 20s after
nearly five straight days below zero. Kansas City, Mo., had a
December record of 16 below zero Saturday, but highs in the 30s and
40s were predicted in the region Monday.
   Temperatures also rebounded into the low 50s in Texas, but
temperatures as low as 11 degrees over the weekend devastated the
lower Rio Grande Valley's citrus crop, and forecasters predicted
more freezing weather on Christmas Day.
   ``It's going to take probably weeks and maybe months to
determine how much damage we've had,'' said Richard Hensz, director
of the Texas A&amp;I University Citrus Center in Weslaco. ``But it's
very extensive.''
   At 5 a.m. Sunday, the wind chill at Orlando, Fla., was about 5
below zero compared with 5 above at Minneapolis-St. Paul, the
National Weather Service said.
   At least 83 deaths have been blamed on the weather since Dec. 15
from the Plains to the East Coast.
   Florida Gov. Bob Martinez declared a state of emergency Sunday
as even Miami plunged to 31 degrees. The cold damaged citrus, sugar
cane and strawberries, stranded holiday travelers and forced
utilities to impose rolling blackouts.
   Record lows were recorded Sunday in nearly every major Florida
city, from 11 in Pensacola to 44 at Key West, where the previous
record of 47 had stood since 1906.
   Records were reported in 56 cities in Alabama, Arkansas,
Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine,
Mississippi, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee,
Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia, the weather service
said.
   Authorities at Plattsburgh, N.Y., spent part of Sunday working
to blast open ice jams on the Saranac River that caused flooding
that forced more than 120 people from their homes at a trailer
park. The city near the Canadian border had a low of 19 below zero.
   Martinez overnight mobilized National Guardsmen and other state
workers to rescue motorists from gridlocked, icy highways. With
many motels packed, emergency shelters were opened in six northern
Florida counties and 5,200 people spent the night in them,
officials said.
   ``There is no one smiling in Florida agriculture today,'' said
Roy Parke of Parkesdale Farms in Plant City, self-proclaimed winter
strawberry capital of the nation.
   The airport for Wilmington, N.C., was shut down by snow Saturday
morning and remained closed Sunday. Snow also closed the airport at
Myrtle Beach, S.C.
   In Florida, the Jacksonville and Gainesville airports remained
closed because of icy runways Sunday. Air service was nearly back
to normal in Tallahassee and Daytona Beach after numerous
cancellations Saturday.
   The North Carolina coast got the most snow Sunday. At least 15
inches fell at Wilmington, eclipsing the city's all-time record of
12{ inches on Feb. 9 and 10, 1973.
   The Hyde County, N.C., sheriff's department reported drifts of 6
to 8 feet. Only large, dual-wheel trucks were able to travel, and
some of them got stuck.
   Wind blowing at 50 to 60 mph on the Outer Banks islands off
North Carolina knocked down power lines as fast as utility crews
could get them back up. Three beach cottages were tossed into the
ocean.
   It'll be the first white Christmas in Wilmington since 1870 and
on the Outer Banks since 1874, the weather service said.
   Early Sunday, the tow line between a tugboat and the Navy tanker
Benjamin Isherwood broke or came off, said Lt. Cmdr. Stephen
Burnett. The vessel drifted until about 4:30 p.m., when it ran
aground, Burnett said.
   Naval officials said the vessel carried no fuel and no injuries
were reported.
   Along the South Carolina coast, the resort town of Myrtle Beach
had 14 inches of snow on the ground Sunday and 8 inches blanketed
streets in Charleston.
   ``I just moved up from Florida in time for (Hurricane) Hugo, and
now this,'' said Rick Hawkins in Charleston. ``Isn't it lovely?
It's a mess.''
   In Florida, Parke of Parkesdale Farms said he expected 40
percent losses. The state's winter strawberry crop is worth some
$162 million.
   ``Significant'' damage was reported to Florida's $3.5 billion
citrus crop and possible damage to the $1.6 billion sugar industry,
Martinez said. The governor's emergency declaration authorized the
state Department of Transportation to loosen weight restrictions on
roads and bridges to help growers move freeze-damaged crops quickly.
   Not everyone complained. ``This is nice. It's not Christmas
without some cold,'' said Louis Dussault of Montreal, strolling
Miami Beach on Sunday with his wife and two children. The city in
Canada had a low of 6 below zero.
   Florida utilities, faced with high demand for electricity,
called for conservation and said there was no excess power to be
bought from frigid Northern states, meaning rotating blackouts
would be imposed for many Floridians through Christmas morning.
   Snow dusted some northern Florida cities, such as Jacksonville,
where icicles hung Sunday morning from rooftops and ice closed
roads and bridges.
   ``It's a winter wonderland in Jacksonville,'' said Mayor Tommy
Hazouri. ``It's a beautiful sight for a city that doesn't get snow
very often, and it's also a dangerous situation for the same
reason.''
   ``They can take it back,'' grumbled resident Randy Dukes. ``I
want a green Christmas.''

   Mickey Spillane has written a special
potboiler for South Carolina troops in Saudi Arabia, and those who
solve the mystery have a chance to win free air travel or hotel
accommodations.
   ``This little story is just a way to keep the guys reminded of
Myrtle Beach,'' said the author, a World War II fighter pilot and
resident of nearby Murrells Inlet.
   The mystery contest designed to entertain members of the 354th
Tactical Air Force, based at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, features
eight weekly installments with clues leading to the whereabouts of
a former South Carolina beauty queen after a fictional kidnapping.
   The story will be sent to military officials via facsimile
machine for distribution to the aspiring pulp-fiction detectives.
   Those who put together the clues qualify for a grand prize of
two round-trip air tickets and several runner-up prizes of hotel
accommodations.
   ``Once they get home, they'll be able to go on a vacation or
take a trip to visit their parents, whatever they want,'' said Maj.
John Elrod, who came up with the idea.

   Hurricane Hugo quickened its pace toward the Eastern
Seaboard on Wednesday as residents gathered supplies and made
evacuation plans, while violence and looting broke out on the
shattered islands in the storm's wake.
   President Bush ordered Army troops to St. Croix of the U.S.
Virgin Islands after National Guardsmen and police reportedly joined
prison escapees and others in wild looting. Armed Coast Guard
crewmen also went ashore to help restore order.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh ordered 100 U.S. marshals and
FBI agents to the island, and Coast Guard cutters evacuated
frightened tourists and residents. Bush also authorized troops to
help hurricane-damaged Puerto Rico.
   Forecasters issued a hurricane watch from St. Augustine, Fla., to
Cape Hatteras, N.C., urging coastal residents to begin taking
precautions. Hugo picked up speed over open water and could come
ashore late Thursday or early Friday.
   ``I think they're looking at this one with a bit of respect,''
city spokesman Pat Dowling said in Myrtle Beach, S.C., as radio and
TV advisories warned: ``Remember the people of Puerto Rico.''
   Since Sunday, Hugo has killed at least 25 people, left thousands
homeless and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage as it
slashed through the northeastern Caribbean with wind of 125 to 150
mph.
   Chaos reigned on St. Croix, as police and National Guardsmen
joined machete-armed mobs on a post-Hugo looting spree. Gunshots
were fired, and ham radio operators heard reports that inmates had
either escaped or been released because of prison damage and were
looting.
   Tourists pleaded with reporters landing on the island to take
them off.
   ``They said, `Please get food! Please get water! Please help us!
They're looting. We've seen police looting. We've seen National
Guard looting. There's no law and order here,''' said Gary Williams,
a reporter for the San Juan daily El Nuevo Dia.
   The U.S. Coast Guard had six ships in the area and sent armed
crewmen from the cutter Bear ashore to help restore order.
   ``Our shore party went ashore and basically determined there was
a complete breakdown of authority. There's a very high indication
that innocent people are going to get hurt in an act of violence
there,'' Lt. Jeff Karonis said in Miami.
   The crew was evacuating ``all people from the island who fear for
their safety,'' the Coast Guard said in a statement. A cargo plane
was ready to supplement the evacuation if needed.
   Tourists sat on the porch of the King Christian Hotel, protected
by hotel employees carrying shotguns.
   ``It was horrendous,'' said Rose Hertzog of Northampton, Pa., who
waited out the storm in a hotel laundry room. ``I thought we were
going to die.
   Thornburgh ordered the 100 marshals and FBI agents to protect
federal officials and property, as well as help bolster local law
enforcement, said David Runkel, a Justice Department spokesman in
Washington. A small team of FBI agents was sent in first to set up a
command post.
   The White House said Alexander Farrelly, governor of the U.S.
Virgin Islands, asked Bush to authorize use of troops to restore
order on St. Croix, but Farrelly on Wednesday night denied making
that request.
   Bush on Wednesday declared the U.S. Virgin Islands a disaster
area and a White House spokesman said a similar declaration was
expected soon for Puerto Rico, which suffered widespread damage.
   The Coast Guard sent cutters to St. Thomas to pick up personnel
and their families whose homes were destroyed. It also was
evacuating 200 American medical students at Montserrat, a British
colony where Hugo damaged nearly 90 percent of the homes.
   Federal relief shipments laden with supplies and rescue workers
from Florida, South Carolina, West Virginia and Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, went to Puerto Rico, while British and French forces helped
Montserrat and Guadeloupe.
   At 3 a.m. EDT Thursday, Hugo's center was about 450 miles
southeast of Savannah, Ga., at 28.2 degrees north latitude and 75.2
degrees west longitude, and was moving northwest at 17 mph, up from
12 mph earlier in the day.
   Hugo's wind speed also rose from 105 to 110 mph Wednesday, but
forecasters said little further strengthening was likely.
   Forecasters said Hugo's path made residents from Savannah, Ga.,
to Charleston, S.C., most likely to be in harm's way, but they were
delaying issuing hurricane warnings until they could make better
projections.
   Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center, said
officials didn't want to spur ``a cry-wolf syndrome'' by triggering
premature evacuation of the resort and retiree communities. But
forecasters said they hoped U.S. residents learned from Hugo's
Caribbean rampage.
   ``When those islands got pounded like they did, that's
remarkable,'' forecaster Martin Nelson said of the relatively low
death toll. ``We gave them a lot of warning, and they apparently
took the warnings.''
   U.S. coastal residents have enough time to prepare, he said.
   ``Let's hope they are,'' Nelson said. ``If later on, they say
`Boy, you sure got that wrong,' that's OK. We'd rather that happen
than have people wake up at 2 a.m. and find a hurricane coming.''
   South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campell put state law enforcement
agencies on alert. `All we can do is to watch now and to wait,'' he
said.
   In Charleston, the historic City Hall was boarded up and school
children were told to stay home Thursday.
   Officials said coastal residents seemed to be taking the right
steps, such as storing emergency supplies and buying materials for
boarding up.
   ``They're buying me out of all my candles, tape, flashlights,
propane fuel, oil and lamps,'' said Tim Brindley, merchandise
manager of K mart in Mount Pleasant, S.C.
   ``I see a lot of people buying water and canned goods like pork
and beans. It's been pretty steady,'' said Bryan Raleigh, manager of
the Market Street Food Lion in Wilmington, N.C., where nearby
Carolina Beach suffered $90 million in damages when hit by Hurricane
Diana in 1984.
   Some took extra precautions.
   ``We're going to church a lot,'' said Dean S. Phillips, town
manager in Bethany Beach, Del.
   The Navy sent its Charleston-based ships to sea to avoid Hugo,
while crews were called Wednesday to their ships at Mayport Naval
Station near Jacksonville for a possible move out.
   ``Like the Boy Scouts, we're prepared,'' said Chief Petty Officer
Art Riccio.
   Adminstrators at the Florida School for the Deaf and Blind sent
home 400 children living in dormitories. ``The decision was to
assume the worst and plan accordingly,'' said Mary Jane Dillon, a
school spokeswoman.
   Bahamians, meanwhile, watched as the hurricane moved away with
little impact.
   ``It's a great sigh of relief for all of us in the Bahamas,''
said meteorologist Michael Stubbs in Nassau. ``Most people want to
be able to enjoy the sea and sunshine here, and now they can.''
   Meanwhile, forecasters said Tropical Storm Iris was being
weakened because of its proximity to Hugo, but could cause more
problems for the Hugo-hit islands.
   ``Satellite pictures show an area of thunderstorms extends south
of the center into the extreme northeastern Caribbean,'' forecaster
Gil Clark said. ``Unfortunately, this activity will be moving
westward over an area that was struck by Hurricane Hugo just three
days ago.''
   At 10:30 p.m., Iris was near latitude 22.0 north and longitude
64.0 west, or 250 miles north-northeast of Puerto Rico. Its winds
were down to 45 mph as the storm moved west-northwest at around 12
mph.

   Afternoons in the little village of Golf are
lulled by the soft hum of electric carts and the pleasant snap of a
good tee shot.
   Not far beyond the back nine, however, the sounds change: trees
cracking under diesel bulldozers and hammers banging out another
clubhouse.
   These are the rhythms of golf in recent years, reflecting a
dramatic surge in the sport's popularity that has spurred a boom in
new golf courses and country club-style housing tracts around the
nation, led by Sunbelt states such as Florida, Texas and South
Carolina.
   Meanwhile, tourism groups, golf schools and clothing
manufacturers are seeking a share of the $20 billion domestic
industry.
   The 32-year-old community of Golf, homesteaded in lonely
woodlands southwest of West Palm Beach as one of the nation's first
golf-oriented developments, is now surrounded by new courses and
billboards promising more.
   ``Now they call this area Golf Lane,'' said John Mosher, manager
of the 131-home village that surrounds an 18-hole course. ``It's
like they can't build enough courses.''
   Actually, they may fall considerably short of demand, the
National Golf Foundation says.
   The Jupiter, Fla.-based trade group predicts nearly 4,000 new
courses may be necessary by the end of the century to accommodate
the burgeoning number of players, from hackers to tournament
professionals.
   ``That's about one every day from now on during the entire next
decade,'' said spokeswoman Kit Bradshaw, who noted 320 new courses
have been built since 1987 with about the same number either
proposed or under construction.
   An estimated 23.4 million golfers are whacking golf balls at
about 13,630 U.S. courses _ an average of about 3,700 golfers for
every 18 holes _ and their ranks could reach between 30 million and
40 million by the year 2000 at present growth rates. In 1980, 15.1
million golfers played on 12,800 courses.
   Florida, which leads the nation with 932 courses, is also No. 1
in planned new golf courses with 53. California, New York and Texas
have more than 750 courses each.
   The age of golf as the exclusive pastime of the rich ended in
the 1960s as golfer Arnold Palmer rose from a modest background in
Pennsylvania to become a legend in the sport, said John Rooney, a
professor of geography at Oklahoma State University and author of
several books on sport and leisure.
   ``That's when more blue-collar and factory workers started to
play,'' he said.
   Golf, however, ranks in the bottom half of the 20 most popular
sports or activities, the National Sporting Goods Association
reported in September.
   Swimming was enjoyed by 71.1 million people, followed by
exercise walking and bicycling.
   But the golf foundation noted nearly half the players are
younger than 40 years old, with the average age 38.1, and may drop
other sports as they age. Also, less than a quarter of all U.S.
golfers are women and their numbers may grow in coming years.
   ``Baby boomers are moving into middle age and taking up a sport
that isn't so physically demanding,'' said Thomas Dorsel, a sports
psychologist at Francis Marion College in Florence, S.C.
   ``I'd also like to think that they are starting to recognize the
almost philosophical aspect of the game. Golf parallels life in so
many ways and it may appeal to people more when they enter a more
philosophical stage of their life.''
   Yet it still takes cash _ and a willingness to part with it _ to
hit the links.
   Sales of clubs and balls have jumped 53 percent since 1984 to
$963 million last year, according to the sporting goods
association. Golf apparel manufacturers sold about $270 million in
merchandise to retailers last year, the Sportswear Manufacturers
Association reported.
   Hefty sums may also be paid to learn to swing the costly clubs.
   ``Money is not the question with many of our guests. The
objective is to learn the game of golf,'' said Fred Griffin,
director of the 3-year-old Grand Cypress Academy of Golf in Orlando.
   For up to $3,000 for a five-day stay, students have access to a
medical team, including a psychologist, optics and muscle experts
and an orthopedic surgeon. On a special practice tee, a
computerized video unit analyzes golf swings for flaws.
   The system records the student's swing then superimposes a
computer graphics model of the stroke of a famous professional
golfer, such as Jack Nicklaus or Palmer.
   ``It's the only one like it,'' said Griffin. ``It's things like
this that people are willing to pay for.''
   Courses, too, are now making special efforts to attract
out-of-town golfers, who spent about $7.8 billion last year on
travel and lodging.
   Consortiums of courses in areas such as Myrtle Beach, S.C.,
Arizona and the Great Smoky Mountains now offer charter golf
vacations. Some tours even provide putting greens at the airport.
   Other tours are specifically aimed at the estimated 13.6 million
Japanese golfers who often pay dearly for a membership to one of
that nation's 1,600 courses.
   In Europe, a ``golf summit'' earlier this month in West Germany
examined the growing crowds at courses from Spain to Sweden. Canada
is scheduled to hold its first golf conference in December in
Toronto.
   ``We're already seeing what happens when there are too many
golfers and too few courses,'' said Ms. Bradshaw.
   Despite forecasts of continued growth, she warned the U.S. golf
boom could be suffocated by the early 1990s unless more municipal
courses are built.
   ``If it starts taking six hours to play a round because of
overcrowded courses, that's when people are just going to say,
`forget it,' and put away their clubs.''

   The images of war wrought by Hurricane
Hugo conjured up memories of another devastating time in South
Carolina history when the carcasses of houses dotted the landscape
and the weary mourned for more than their dead.
   ``I feel like my forefathers must have felt at the close of the
War Between the States. I think we lost life as we know it,'' said
W. Jean Woods, a councilman in neighboring Berkeley County.
   ``Our economy has been laid waste. Our land has been laid waste.
We're all emotionally scarred,'' Woods said.
   This time, the villain wasn't an invading army, although
Charleston has suffered its share of natural disaster in its
glorious 319-year history.
   This time a way of life was gone with a wind named Hugo, a
killer that roared across the Caribbean and struck a bulls-eye on
Charleston before it fizzled off the weather radar screens as a
low-pressure system in western Pennsylvania.
   The hurricane and its remnants killed 33 people in the Caribbean
and 29 in the United States, including 18 in South Carolina. The
12th strongest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland in this century,
Hugo caused an estimated $3 billion damage in this state alone.
   Charleston, a jewel of the Old South now with 65,000 residents,
has weathered much since it was founded in 1670. The British
occupied it in the Revolutionary War; the Union bombarded it in the
Civil War.
   The city survived a disastrous fire in 1861 and earthquakes in
1886 and 1893. Now it can add Hugo to its battle flag.
   Fort Sumter, where the first shots of the Civil War were fired
by the first state to secede from the Union, fell not to
Confederate cannons but to Hugo's tidal surge. It was swamped by a
17-foot wave, sustained $1 million damage and is under repair.
   ``Charleston just won't ever be the same. When the hurricane
hit, it took a piece of Charleston with it,'' said Renee Lappe, 30.
``It looked like a bomb had been dropped. If you ride in the
streets, it makes you want to cry.''
   In all, 63 buildings in Charleston collapsed and 381 have severe
structural damage, officials said. Four of five structures have
roof damage of some degree.
   Some buildings in Charleston date back to the 1690s. Its
historic district sits on a peninsula that sticks out like a tongue
into its harbor, where a fictional Rhett Butler ran the Union
blockade.
   About 75 percent of the city's 3,500 building considered to be
of historical significance were damaged, including 20 to 30 that
were severely damaged or razed. Then as the second part of a cruel
combination punch, the structures were hit by several inches of
rain two days after Hugo left.
   Damage to those buildings was put in the hundreds of millions of
dollars and could take five years to repair, according to teams of
preservationists who rushed to the city's aid from all over the
country.
   ``We're not destroyed, but we're hurt,'' said Lawrence Walker of
the Historic Charleston Foundation, grateful that the
pastel-colored antebellum mansions weren't subjected to more ruin.
   The mahogany altar at the Cathedral of St. Luke and St. Paul was
splintered by a stone roof support that crashed down when Hugo
gouged a gaping hole in the roof of the Roman revival structure
built in 1815.
   ``At least the Yankees aren't shooting at us this time,'' said
the Very Rev. Nelson Koscheski.
   As in any battle, there were heroes.
   In McClellanville, a shrimping village of 500 residents in the
Carolina Lowcountry, Hugo unleashed its mightiest tidal surge of 20
feet. The entire town was devastated. Boats 68 feet long were
tossed into yards as if they were toys.
   Thomas Colleton, 57, hoisted his family of nine up to the inner
rafters of his one-story house as waters flooded in and rose up to
his chest as he lifted the children.
   ``I wanted to be the last one (up),'' Colleton said later.
``When you hear a man screaming for help and nobody can help him,
you know it's terrible.''
   ``Lives are just devastated,'' said Jimmy Scott, 45, as he
scraped the muck from his home. ``It's really gone with the wind
this time. Literally. There's nothing to do but pick up the pieces
and start over.''
   Frances Graham, 74, stacked her furniture and furnishings on the
front lawn in an attempt to dry them. Water had surged 10 feet into
the house. A building she had never seen before was dumped in the
back yard.
   ``It was absolute pandemonium,'' Mrs. Graham said ``We may be
scrounging around for food just like Scarlett O'Hara. We just don't
know where to turn.''
   Charleston issued an emergency ordinance to prevent price
gouging on items such as ice and chain saws. A fist fight broke out
in one ice line.
   Some looting was also reported in Myrtle Beach. ``It's like
stealing from a graveyard,'' shopowner Connie Brewer said.
   But for the most part, people quietly picked up the pieces.
   The National Guard enforced a dawn-to-dusk curfew and martial
law was imposed on the Isle of Palms, one of the barrier islands
that absorbed the brunt of Hugo's ferocity.
   After getting his first look at the devastation, Thomas Harper,
a retired Air Force officer, said, ``It looks like what happens
after artillery fire.''
   Some island and coastal residents who may have lost everything
they had to Hugo faced another devastating prospect: a state law
enacted to curb beach erosion may prevent some from rebuilding.
   And more than a week after Hugo roared through, 203,000 people
were without power, most of them in the Charleston area.
Storm-battered residents coped without electricity, without hot
water for showers, without ways to cook hot food as convoys of
electrical workers strung new power lines.
   They queued up for meals, canned food, ice, air mattresses, gas
lanterns, shoes and clothes at distribution points.
   ``This will keep us alive,'' said a grateful Fesella Ladson, 25,
of Charleston, carrying a cardboard box filled with emergency
supplies.
   The American Red Cross mounted a $42 million relief effort, the
most expensive relief effort in its 126-year history.
   Supplies poured in from around the country, but folks in the
rural areas felt the recovery moved glacier-like.
   Mayor Hazel Parson-Starkes of Ridgeville blamed Hugo for ``the
worst devastation in any of our lives.''
   ``We have no food, water, power or anything. We're pleading for
all the help we can get. I just don't know how we're going to get
through this.''
   Hugo's fury recalled the age-old awe of Caribbean Indians who
bowed before a god of wind named Hurrican.
   In South Carolina, its brute energy created incongruous scenes:
boats blown a half-mile inland, roofs sheared off, trees twisted
into spaghetti-like heaps.
   ``It really rattled us to our roots,'' said Dr. Linda Austin of
the Medical University of South Carolina.
   Somehow, people began rebuilding their homes and their lives.
Some in Charleston found a force more indomitable than the guns of
armies or nature's mightiest forces.
   Kris Holmes waited patiently for a leasing company to put the
roof back on her business, Terrible Tom's Pastry Shop. She hoped to
reopen soon.
   ``It's the spirit of Charleston,'' she said. ``We're survivors.''

   In Cedar Rapids, Iowa _ halfway across the
country from Hollywood _ lives a recent high school graduate with
the perfect name for an actress: Annabeth Gish.
   She shares the last name of one of the cinema's greatest stars,
Lillian Gish, and decided quickly on a career in movies. But
walking the streets, she feels pretty much like any other resident,
even if some have not forgotten last year's ``Mystic Pizza,'' in
which Gish plays a baby sitter who falls in love with the child's
father.
   ``I was baby-sitting for this family at the time,'' she recalled.
   ``They saw this movie and thought, `uh, oh.' I got a lot of
razzing about that. When you're in a high school environment and
people are seeing you play an older character having more mature
things happen, it's pretty confusing.''
   After her latest movie, ``Shag,'' Iowans may be tempted to award
blue ribbons and break into dance upon spotting Gish. The actress
plays Pudge Carmichael, one of four high school senior girls in
1963 who sneak off to Myrtle Beach, S.C., in search of a last
adventure before going off to college and the ``real'' world.
   The film's title comes from a popular dance that Pudge masters.
   ``I read the script and just fell in love with the liveliness,''
Gish said in an interview. ``I wanted to be a part of it, and did a
lot of background on the Shag becuase I had never heard of it. It's
a very big deal down in Myrtle Beach and it kept getting more and
more fascinating.''
   Gish's brief career in show business has also been far from
Hollywood. ``Desert Bloom,'' her film debut, was made in Tucson,
Ariz., while Mystic, Conn., was the setting for ``Mystic Pizza.''
   ``Shag'' was primarily filmed in Myrtle Beach.
   ``I went down a little bit earlier and had the luxury of
learning from some authentic shaggers,'' said Gish, a proud member
of the Shag Hall of Fame. ``It was a different experience for them.
I think they were a little bit wary of what this Hollywood movie
company was going to represent their dance as.''
   The cast includes several relatives of Hollywood stars: Bridget
Fonda is the daughter of Peter Fonda and niece of Jane Fonda;
Tyrone Power Jr. is the late actor's son; Page Hannah is Daryl
Hannah's sister; and Carrie Hamilton is the daughter of Carol
Burnett.
   But Gish is not related to Lillian Gish and set out to be an
actress before even knowing the significance of her last name.
   ``When I was in first grade I went to the Halloween parade as a
movie star. When I was in third grade, I wrote that when I grow up
I would like to be an actress in the movies. I was very into
watching movies. I really enjoyed reading aloud, performing.''
   By the time the aspiring actress turned 13, she was fully aware
of her namesake and wrote for advice.
   ``She discouraged me from getting involved in the business. She
said there was too much talent and not enough work and it was
better to stay in an environment where you where loved and cared
for.''
   But the young Gish had her mind made up. She had been acting in
community theater since age 8 and fell in love with movies,
especially the Cary Grant-Katharine Hepburn screwball comedy
``Bringing Up Baby,'' and Lillian Gish's silent classic ``The
Wind.''
   ``I think Katharine Hepburn was great, being a strong,
individualized woman, playing these great characters,'' she said.
   Gish's stage debut, however, was more humble.
   ``My first play was called `Wylie and the Hairyman,''' she
recalled. ``My mom was the Hairyman and I was the swamp. I wore
tie-dyed long johns, but it was fun. I got to gurgle and bubble.''
   She was soon playing real people and, in 1986, starred as the
perceptive stepdaughter of an alcoholic (Jon Voight) in ``Desert
Bloom.''
   ``Having that as my first experience was really a blessing,''
said Gish. ``It kind of set my path in the right direction. When
you're surrounded by people who are passionate about their work, it
made all the difference.
   She followed with ``Hiding Out,'' and appeared on television in
``Hero in the Family,'' an ABC Disney Sunday Night Movie. Last
year, Gish stayed in Cedar Rapids, finishing her high school
education. This fall, instead of heading for the West Coast, she
will begin classes at Duke University.
   ``I've strived to maintain some normalcy in my life, some
groundedness'' Gish said.
   ``If I had have moved out to L.A., which there were pressures to
do, and started working right away and given up on my education, it
would have been so easy for me to be corrupted or eaten by the
sharks. My parents are like my support system.''

<LEADPARA>  A Ferris wheel carriage in Myrtle Beach, S.C., tipped over when youths rocked
it, killing a 17-year-old boy and injuring two girls, officials said. The boy
and his sister fell into another carriage Saturday night, tipping it over and
knocking another girl about 30 feet to the ground with them, said Rick
Zeckman, manager of the Pavilion of Myrtle Beach amusement park. Ronald Turner
died Sunday of head injuries, a hospital spokeswoman said. His 12-year-old
sister, Crystal, and a 7-year-old girl were reported in fair condition.  </LEADPARA>
