<TEXT>     Industry officials released a downbeat report as the 10-day trade
exposition opened.;    Many companies appeared to be taking a more
conservative approach as they presented new lines, sticking with ideas that
worked well in 1990. That meant more baby dolls for girls, wrestling action
figures for boys and games and toys spun off from TV shows and comic books.;  
 The Toy Manufacturers of America, the trade group that sponsors the big show,
said sales of traditional toys -- those other than video games -- were
virtually unchanged last year. Shipments rose just 0.3 percent in terms of
dollars and 0.2 percent in terms of units.;    The group estimated video game
sales rose 20.9 percent in dollars and 33.8 percent in units.;    Officials
forecast wholesale and retail toy sales would rise 5 percent for 1991, but
they said as much as two-thirds of that increase would be from price
increases, not more sales.;    George R. Ditomassi, the trade group's
chairman, said business was difficult in 1990 because budget-conscious
consumers spent less on toys.;    Several companies expanded their lines of
wrestling toys after that segment sold well last year. Lewis Galoob Toys Inc.
has World Championship Wrestling figures, while Hasbro Inc. and Tonka Corp.
are again offering lines associated from the World Wrestling Federation.;   
Hasbro is going beyond dolls and figures. The company is also selling
wrestling gear for boys, including shirts with photos of well-developed
pectorals imprinted on them.;    Baby and little girl dolls have been big
business the past few years, and manufacturers are again competing to have the
most clever and cutest dolls.;    Hasbro introduced Baby Wanna Walk, while
Mattel extended its successful Magic Nursery line to include pets. Tyco Toys
Inc. added to its extensive Ideal line of dolls by bringing back Thumbelina, a
namesake of dolls that today's mothers once played with.;    Mattel extended
the Barbie line, adding new outfits and signing a licensing agreement with
singer M.C. Hammer of Fremont to create a doll in his likeness to fit in with
the Barbie line.;    Few manufacturers were selling toys connected with the
gulf war.; TOY SALES; More than 1.75 billion toys were sold in 1989, up only;
three percent from 1988. Here's a look at some categories; of toys; ...;

<HL> Boys and Girls Each Have Their Own Toys
(And Firms Still Pitch Them That Way)

   Susan Lehr, a Cincinnati homemaker, was happy to buy her three-year-old son a doll this year for Christmas. 
"But if he starts asking me for Barbie when he's eight," she says, "I'll worry." 

   If current trends are any guide, Mrs. Lehr will have no need to fret. 
American families may be inching toward a time when boys and girls play with the same toys, but the toy industry isn't pushing it. 

   The "liberating" of that industry seems at most to mirror the halting changes in the lives of the adults buying the toys. 
Judging by the sales of items like Kenner-Parker Toys Inc.'s Easy-Bake Oven, for example, small boys, like their fathers, take their first step toward housework by way of the kitchen. 

   But for every little girl exulting over a Lego construction set Christmas morning, there will be many more unwrapping bridal dresses and tutus for My Little Pony, Hasbro Inc.'s pastel plastic horse. 
Dolls that wet, for girls, and laser guns, for boys, are still the natural order in the toy store. 

   The toy industry says that's the way kids and their parents want it. 
"Research shows that girls still prefer the cute and frilly. 
And when boys perceive a product as a girl's toy, they won't have anything to do with it," says Toni Langkau, a publicist who works on toy accounts at Daniel J. Edelman Inc. in New York. 
"You have to have boy-driven products and girl-driven products." 

   Even retailers who cater to parents with progressive ideas about toys say they see ambivalence. 
"Shoppers come in and say, 'I want something for a two-year old girl,'" says Susan Lounsbury, president of Play Fair in Boulder, Colo. 
"At that age, we think, what difference does it make?" 

   For many people, it makes an enormous difference." 
An awful lot of men who wouldn't consider themselves sexist don't want their boys to have dolls," says Greg Larson, president of Larson's Toys &amp; Games in Palm Beach, Fla., and Columbus and Cincinnati, Ohio. 
"We get grandmothers who buy their grandsons dolls; then the fathers come in and return them." 

   Argues David S. Leibowitz, a toy analyst with American Securities Corp. in New York: "It has nothing to do with manufacturers. 
Toys are not sold, toys are bought. 
If the peer group wants the product," he says, it will sell. 

   But Mr. Larson, among others, says the toy industry is the source of strong messages maintaining the great divide. 
"The toy industry is still really sexist," he says. 
"Every year we go to the toy fair, and we come back saying, 'It's not getting any better.'" 

   For example, although Hasbro, the biggest toy maker, also markets board games and other "gender-neutral" items, it organizes its biggest sellers strictly along sex-role lines. 
Its wholesale catalog features a Girls Toys line that includes Real Baby and Get in Shape, Girl! exercise kits. 
The Boys Toys line includes Transformers and Inhumanoids -- small, hard-plastic characters that in a dollhouse might be considered dolls but in an imaginary war zone are known as "action figures." 

   The distinction is meaningful. 
G.I. Joe got a big boost a few years ago when Hasbro retired the old, softer, Barbie-sized Joe and brought him back as a small, hard "action figure." 

   Toy companies trumpet the message in fantasy adventure programs and tied-in advertising on Saturday morning television -- when most peer groups do their own "research." 
Commercials for boys' toys are brash and lively, with bracing music, while spots for girls' toys have a soft, filmy look, pastel tones and music that Jodi Levin, a Toy Manufacturers Association spokeswoman, describes as "perky." 

   Toys meant to mirror real life are also distinguished by gender. 
Photos of Little Tikes' Push About Mower, for example, feature a little boy at work; photos for Push About Vacuum feature a girl. 

   And such distinctions start early. 
The package for Ambi Toys' Baby's First Phone displays an infant in pink, while Baby's First Car shows a child in blue. 
The package for Tomy's Stunt Pilot, for ages three to seven, depicts only part of a child, but a bit of blue collar can be seen. 

   Even where a product would seem to be free of any sex-role association, most companies stick to the color line. 
Fisher-Price this year is selling watches for children only in pink or blue. 
"Why couldn't they have brought it out in yellow or red?" asks Ms. Lounsbury of Play Fair. 

   A spokeswoman at Fisher-Price, a division of Quaker Oats Co., says: "After kids start going to day care or nursery school and watching television, they start asking for gender-specific toys." 
She adds that next year Fisher-Price will include colors that are "hot." 
Kids ages four to nine are "fashion-conscious" as well as gender-conscious, she says. 

   Among the exceptions to the gender line are construction products like Lego System Inc.'s Lego or Habermaas' T.C. Timber, which has a package showing a girl in a frilly dress surveying a toy construction site. 
And many toys for older kids suggest clearly that they are for either sex. 
The marketers at Discovery World balance pictures of boys and girls on the packages for their magnet, microscope and other science kits. 

   Recently, some companies have introduced toys in a "crossover" category -- marketed to make clear that a male with a doll in his arms is still, as one company put it, a "rough-and-tumble" boy. 
American Greetings Corp. produces such sugar-and-spice items as Strawberry Shortcake. 
This year its AmToy division brought out the "first plush action figure" for boys. 

   This toy, says AmToys, is supposed to give boys what girls get from dolls: "a refuge from stress, a means of expressing feelings they can't put into words, an acceptable outlet for aggression." 

   But, says Ms. Langkau, the publicist, while the smallest boys will use a teddy bear for such purposes, "by four or five, they're too macho for that. 
They don't want their friends to see them." 

   AmToys' answer is My Pet Monster, a 24-inch, blue-fur creature with yellow fangs, warts on his nose and a set of handcuffs. 
Televison ads show little boys racing around on their bikes with the Monster or dangling him in front of suitably horrified little girls. 

   Hasbro has gone as far as to introduce a cuddly human doll for boys. 
Kids with My Buddy can even get garments for the doll, although they run mostly to baseball uniforms and workout clothes. 
"There's nothing sissy about him," contends Toy Manufacturers' Ms. Levin. 
"But he's basically a rag doll."

   Nine-year-old history buff Jennifer Johnson flew from
California to Colonial Williamsburg this week. But she won't
have time to watch the fife and drum corps march or tour the
wheelwright's stable. Jennifer came to see a product
introduction.
   The product, named Felicity Merriman, is a new doll line
being introduced by tiny Pleasant Co., a doll and book
concern based in Middleton, Wis. And even though tickets to
the unveiling and related program cost $50 for adults and $30
for children, more than 10,000 people from across the nation
are flocking to Williamsburg to see it.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This is going to be really fun. I'm so excited," says
Jennifer, of San Juan Capistrano, Calif., who ordered her
tickets six months ago. Jennifer's aunt, Dolores Frost,
agreed to join her for the trip from her home in Mauni Lani,
Hawaii. "It's like studying history while playing. Once you
get hooked on these dolls," you want to see more, says Ms.
Frost, 56.
   Indeed, thousands of parents and their daughters can't
seem to get enough of Pleasant's line of historical dolls. In
just five years, the company's sales of dolls and related
accessories have surged to nearly $50 million.
   With such success, five-year-old Pleasant is demonstrating
that sometimes small companies are better suited to discover
and pursue niche markets than larger concerns. "Big companies
are essentially mass-market driven," says Saul Jodel,
president of product development at Lewis Galoob Toys Inc.
"It doesn't pay for us to chase that specialty niche
business."
   Adds Michael Lyden, senior vice president of business
development at Tyco Toys Inc., "We have a hard-enough time
serving our current masters without segmenting the market."
If only a few of the company's retail customers will stock a
specialty toy, Tyco isn't interested in developing it, he
says.
   Pleasant has put together a clever package. Its American
Girls Collection is centered on four 18-inch historical dolls
-- Felicity (1774), Kirsten Larson (1854), Samantha
Parkington (1904) and Molly McIntire (1944) -- aimed at girls
aged seven to 12. Each doll is the heroine of a set of books
that describes her adventures, and each has a line of clothes
and accessories appropriate to her period. Kirsten, for
example, can be dressed in pantalettes and flannel underwear,
and Molly finds a Mickey Mouse flip book in her Christmas
stocking and carries a brown bag lunch because "metal was in
short supply during the war."
   The products are available only through catalogs, and
while the dolls themselves sell for $82 apiece, buying
Samantha and all her accessories would cost more than $1,000,
not including gift wrapping. In addition to the doll lines,
the company sells matching children's clothes (a flannel
nightie for Kirsten costs $18; one just like it for an
eight-year-old is $50). It also offers activity books --
cookbooks and diaries, for example -- and craft kits -- like
embroidery samplers and lacy valentines -- that are linked to
the dolls.
   "Parents get hooked on the education {aspect}, and the
kids think it's a beautiful doll," says toy analyst Thomas
Kully of William Blair &amp; Co. in Chicago. "The book may be the
parent's crutch to justify the expenditure. It gives kids a
story line to identify with."
   With catalogs and direct mail, Pleasant pursues a more
upscale consumer than many retail chains might attract. "We
could never have competed with Hasbro or Mattel for shelf
space," says Pleasant T. Rowland, company president. Still,
she says, "there are enough people in America who care about
this kind of product. They've been immensely loyal and on
their referrals, others have come."
   Ms. Rowland, 50 years old, a former grade-school teacher,
television-news anchor and author of children's textbooks,
founded the company in 1986 after noticing a dearth of
educational toys for little girls.
   Using $1 million from her personal savings plus bank loans
and an outside investor, she hired a small staff to design a
catalog and an assortment of products. Then she purchased
advertisements in magazines like the New Yorker and
Smithsonian and mailed out 500,000 catalogs to affluent
prospects chosen from mailing lists she had purchased.
   To anchor the company product line, Ms. Rowland has
developed a total of 21 books featuring the doll characters.
The books spin tales of summer, birthday and other adventures
that "allow girls to compare and contrast their own lives to
what life would have been like in the past," the company
catalog notes.
   The books, which sold 4.5 million copies last year, are
marketed in major retail chains nationwide, including Barnes
&amp; Noble Inc. and Waldenbook Co., a unit of Kmart Corp., for
about $6 each. Many school libraries also stock the
collection. "It's one of the fastest selling series in
children's books overall," says Donna Passannante, a
spokeswoman for Barnes &amp; Noble. "It's strong competition for
the `Little House on the Prairie' series."
   In "Meet Kirsten," readers learn about the Larson family's
journey from Sweden to a tiny farm on the American frontier
and Kirsten's life in a world of log cabins and one-room
schoolhouses. The doll itself is sold in a blue calico dress
with, the catalog says, "a `grow stripe' at the bottom that
her mother let out as she grew taller."
   The accessories that go with the "Happy Birthday,
Kirsten]" book include a trestle table and matching chairs,
"handcrafted of solid pine," that "are copied from the sturdy
furniture that early Swedish settlers like the Larsons made
for their simple cabins." Also available: handmade stoneware
plates and wooden bowls to set the table for Kirsten's
birthday party.
   Emily Komaromi, a 10-year-old in Fair Oaks, Calif., owns
most of the Pleasant books, as well as two dolls and various
accessories. "I was learning about Victorian times in school.
I wanted to know more," says Emily, explaining the $400 to
$500 investment her parents have made. Emily now hosts tea
parties at her house with several friends and their Pleasant
dolls.
   In its first year, Pleasant had $1.8 million in revenue.
By 1988, its third year, the concern had $17 million in sales
and had started turning a profit. For 1990, Pleasant posted
$48 million in sales.
   Last year, Pleasant introduced a second product line, the
New Baby Collection, to help "parents prepare toddlers for
the arrival of a new baby." A pop-up book with rhyming text
describes to preschoolers how babies are cared for, from
feedings to lullabies. Children can practice their skills
with 15-inch soft-cloth Asian, African-American and white
dolls and their accessories, like diaper bags, baby powder,
stuffed animals and bibs.
   The collection includes infant and children's clothing
that matches illustrations in the book. The baby dolls cost
$54 while the pop-up book is priced at $19.95. Accessories
range from $14 to $78.
   In the $14 billion toy industry, experts agree there's
room in America's playrooms for Pleasant. Long-term success,
however, is far from guaranteed. Pleasant's collection may
soon grow passe. Moreover, there's always the risk of a
competitive response from companies that have, until now,
ignored the niche.
   "Mattel makes $740 million a year with Barbie. Does that
mean it hasn't looked at other doll lines? Of course not.
Mattel is fully capable of designing new lines," warns Steven
Eisenberg, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York.
   Pleasant's future growth may also be limited if it
continues to restrict itself to a relatively small customer
base. For now, the company has no plans to develop
lower-priced dolls.
   Analysts also caution that a reverse phenomenon is
possible -- Pleasant could become too big a trend, too soon.
"The most difficult problem the industry has is not losers
but controlling winners -- winners who become losers because
they can't control their inventory," says Mr. Eisenberg.
Since Pleasant imports its inventory from all over Europe,
Asia and the U.S., orders could back up.
   But Ms. Rowland contends her marketing strategy will
forestall any backlog. "We really don't want to hype this
thing into oblivion," she says. "We've turned down requests
from others to market for us. We built this for the long
run."

   If it weren't for kids, there wouldn't be so many excuses for
adults to visit toy departments at holiday time. There are
thousands of toys marketed, so parents have plenty of fun ahead of
them before letting the youngsters take over. Here is the barest
sampling of what's in the stores:
   DOLLS. Classic baby dolls and what might be called role model
dolls prevail.
   - The Magic Nursery Baby has to arrive before its new owner can
determine its sex, just like a real baby. Each doll comes with a
homecoming garment that dissolves in water, revealing a packet with
a card that tells whether it's a boy or girl. Every 36th doll sold
will have a card that says it's a twin, and a second doll will be
on the way when the card is redeemed with Mattel, the maker.
   - If twins aren't enough, how about Quints? Five little dolls,
complete with accessories that are color coded (to tell them apart,
of course), come from Tyco Toys.
   - Then there's a new batch from the patch. Cabbage Patch Kids
with different facial features, eye colors, hair styles and skin
tones in as many variations as the owners themselves come in
Birthday Kids, Babyland Kids, Kids' Kids that pose, and Babies
reeking of baby powder. Now marketed by Hasbro, Cabbage Patchers
still come with their individual adoption certificates and
thousands of outfits to choose from.
   - Dolls heading out in the world include the Mommy Doll from
Tootsietoy, depicting the working mothers of real life. Briefcases,
jogging sweats, granny gowns, car keys, laundry baskets and babies
of their own accessorize these model moms. According to Cindy
Stern, who created the doll (with toy clothing designer Sue Ogden),
most mothers choose versions of the doll that most resemble
themselves.
   - Artistic aspirations are captured by My Pretty Ballerina by
Tyco Toys. This doll, dressed in tights and leg warmers, can dance
on point and execute arabesques or pirouettes. She comes with her
own practice barre. Separate accessories are performance ensembles
with costume pieces and cassette tapes with music from ``The
Nutcracker Suite'' and ``Swan Lake.''
   - What's a model of a model? It could be a doll from the Real
Model Collection by Matchbook Toys, fashion plates depicting
Christie Brinkley, Cheryl Tiegs or Beverly Johnson. Each doll comes
with portfolio, fashion changes, autographed pictures and beauty
booklet. The real Brinkley, Tiegs and Johnson are donating part of
their doll sales royalties to The Make-A-Wish Foundation.
   - Barbie probably is the Grande Dame of all fashion dolls, and
new versions from Mattel include the Ice Capades Barbie, Barbie and
The Beat, My First Princess, Wedding Fantasy, Air Force Barbie,
Barbie's All-Stars, Nigerian Barbie and Brazilian Barbie. Barbie
also has her first Bob Mackie gown, which the designer created for
the first in a series of collector Barbies.
   - Fashion consciousness has hit paper dolls, too. Lookin' Pretty
Dolls from Ohio Art come with press-on, peel-off vinyl fashions
that can be stored in their own carry-cases.
   - Old-world charm characterizes the Canneto Dolls from Hasbro,
made by a family in Italy. The dolls recall those grandmother had,
with country-print dresses trimmed in lace and flowers, straw or
lacy bonnets and floral bouquets. The dolls come with brushable
hair and soft bodies in baby dolls, toddlers, and little girls.
   CUDDLIES. Plenty of plush, but personalities are emerging.
   - A little fellow called F.R.O.Y.D. is sort of odd looking. He's
yellow, has a Cyrano-type nose and wears a button that says ``I
believe in you!'' He was discovered on a drawing pad one day by
former jewelry designer Carolyne Greene, who got him ready for his
debut in the toy world. F.R.O.Y.D. (for ``I'm for the reality of
your dreams'') says he was there to encourage Columbus, helping him
believe there really was something on the other side of the ocean.
He says he helped Thomas Edison see light bulbs, and Gorbachev find
a new way for Russia. ``Encouraging people to have the confidence
to make their dreams come true is my favorite thing to do. And I
don't need batteries. You can say the only accessory I come with is
your imagination.''
   - Another comforting character is Snobell, a reindeer in plush
from Applause. This pure white reindeer gets his name from the six
bells on his antlers that keep him from disappearing in the snow.
He has gray gloves and a green scarf with red tassels.
   - Also from Applause are Tiny Toons plush toys based on
characters in the Stephen Spielberg animated feature of that name.
These are teen-aged Bugs and Daffy offshoots, including Buster and
Babs Bunny, Plucky Duck, Hamton, Dizzy Devil and Montana Max.
   - Now five years old and still going strong is Teddy Ruxpin, the
talking bear from Worlds of Wonder. Said to be the world's first
animated talking toy, Teddy communicates to kids with moving eyes,
mouth and voice from casettes. This year he comes up with some new
Adventure Series tapes and storybooks, including the Do-Along
Songbook and Fire Safety with Teddy Ruxpin.

To outfit little girls with fantasy wear, Pleasant T. Rowland has the most 
imaginative concept going. Rowland, a Wisconsin entrepreneur, author and former 
teacher, started her Middleton, Wis. firm, Pleasant Co., in September, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
As part of her business she included an American Girls Collection of clothes 
for girls ages 7 to 10, with matching outfits for dolls. All the clothes and 
doll costumes are inspired by the make-believe characters in the accompanying, 
American Girls storybooks that Pleasant publishes. Clothes, dolls and books are 
available by mail order only. 
</P>
<P>
The storybook characters are the old-fashioned kind. No bionic women or road 
warriors here. There is Kirsten Larson, a fictional, Scandinavian girl who 
settles on the American frontier of 1854. She wears country dresses and woolly 
separates that keep her warm on chilly Minnesota mornings. Samantha Parkington, 
an orphan who lives with her wealthy grandmother, has oodles of fancy party and 
day dresses for her activities at Miss Crampton's Academy. The scheming, 
dreaming Molly McIntire, who lives with her mother while her father fights in 
World War II, rounds out the collection of characters, with her all-American 
girl, plaid jumpers, her pj's and raincoats. 
</P>
<P>
Most outfits are available in girls sizes 6x to 16 and range in price from $45 
to $175. The dolls, dressed like various characters, are priced from about $75 
and sold with their own, personal storybook. Their clothes are priced at about 
$16 to $42, with patterns available at $10 each, for home sewers. And there 
seems to be a market for it. Business has more than doubled each year since the 
company was formed, says Tamara Hauck, vice president of marketing and product 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"Little girls are looking to emulate someone, and these characters can be used 
as role models," Hauck says of Kirsten, Samantha and Molly. "The characters 
stand for solid American values such as courage, determination, familial love 
and the rewards of friendship." Hauck contrasts these ideals to the life styles 
represented by typical "fashion" dolls, such as Barbie. "They have sports cars, 
dream houses and other material things," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
Fashions for her storybook dolls and for little girls are all conceptualized by 
Rowland and made of fabrics designed in-house. Cotton twill, taffeta, velvet 
and wool are staple fabrics for clothes, flame-retardant polyester and nylon 
fabrics are used for sleep wear. 
</P>
<P>
Extensive historical research goes into the outfits, most of which (except 
perhaps the prairie dresses) are classics, meant to blend with clothes already 
in a girl's wardrobe. A case in point: the Scandinavian ensemble of woolens are 
hand-knit in black and white yarns to create a Scandinavian pattern indicative 
of those worn at the turn of the century in character Kirsten's native country. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the line are some elaborate accessories for dolls and girls. A 
girl-sized sheared rabbit-fur muff and hat is re-created for Samantha in white 
faux fur. The World War II doll, Molly, has a tiny, monogrammed handkerchief 
containing an authentic 1943 steel penny used during the war when copper was in 
short supply. Some dolls even have paper dolls to play with. 
</P>
<P>
But the accompanying books seem to be Rowland's pride. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no accident that the dolls are sold only with the purchase of a book -- 
they are not available separately," says Hauck. "One of the objectives is to 
encourage young girls to read and to learn about history." 
</P>

The American Girls Collection of dolls and fashions are available through mail 
order only. To obtain a catalogue call (800) 845-0005.

   On Anika Polzin's first trip outside her native
East Germany in November her parents bought her a Barbie doll.
   Now on her second excursion to the western world the
six-year-old is getting wined and dined _ make that milkshaked and
hamburgered _ by Barbie's corporate parents.
   Mattel Inc., manufacturer of the famous fashion doll, brought
Miss Polzin and her family over for a five-day holiday in New York.
They will be guests at a black-tie affair Mattel is hosting tonight
to mark the beginning of the annual American International Toy Fair
and to announce what the company is calling the ``Barbie Summit.''
   Patricia Wyatt, director of marketing for girls toys at Mattel,
said the company thought it was fitting to have Miss Polzin on hand
when they revealed plans for the event that is to be held each year
starting with the first three-day conference in New York during the
week of Nov. 19. Essay contests will be held for girls of varying
ages to compete to become ``delegates.''
   ``Through Barbie we want to bring children from around the world
together,'' Ms. Wyatt said, speaking in the almost reverential
tones Mattel people use in referring to a toy that has been a
must-have for many little girls since being introduced 31 years ago.
   Mattel reckons that enough Barbies have been sold in the doll's
lifetime that if placed head to toe they would circle the earth 3{
times. Sales of the dolls plus her entourage and their
accouterments exceeded $450 million in 1988 and accounted for 40
percent of Hawthorne, Calif.-based Mattel's total revenue.
   The summit will ``give children a forum to express their
viewpoints'' ... and ``help them share their different cultures
with one another,'' Ms. Wyatt said in an interview.
   A new Barbie Summit doll _ appropriately available in four
ethnic distinctions _ outfitted in a shimmering white ensemble will
debut at Toy Fair, an annual trade show. Proceeds from sales of the
doll will be placed in a Barbie Fund, which Mattel will donate to
children's charities.
   The towheaded Miss Polzin was tuckered out Friday afternoon from
a busy day of sightseeing, shopping and a visit to Rumpelmayer's
Restaurant, a favorite Manhattan watering hole with the young,
ice-cream eating set. But she handled an interview at her Waldorf
Astoria suite with admirable aplomb and smiled sweetly for
photographs.
   It was a picture of a beaming Anika clutching a new Barbie that
first attracted Mattel's attention.
   ``We were very moved by the photo,'' Ms. Wyatt said. ``It was
nice to know that Barbie transcended cultures.''
   The caption on the photo, which appeared in newspapers around
the world, gave her name and hometown, Schwanefeld, East Germany.
It said she was photographed after a day of western-style shopping
in Helmstedt, West Germany.
   Mattel's German affiliates easily tracked down Miss Polzin. Only
a few inquiries were needed to trace her in Schwanefeld, a tiny
village, population 270, a few miles from the border with West
Germany.
   Miss Polzin, wearing a new dress and complementing hot-pink
tights, said through an interpreter that she was enjoying her trip
to the United States.
   But signs of jet lag were still evident as she sat on a sofa
beside Minnie Mouse. She and her 10-year-old brother, Maik, and
parents, Eva and Inglof, who works for the East German railroad,
arrived late Thursday night from Frankfurt on a flight courtesy of
Lufthansa airlines.
   They already had been to the Statue of Liberty, and outings to
the Empire State Building, museums and, of course, FAO Schwarz were
planned.

<TEXT>     Black Perkins, who is principal designer for Mattel Toys' fashion dolls,
works out of a studio in a top-secret design center in El Segundo. Each year
she creates 100 fashions for Barbie, the company's billion-dollar baby.;   
Picking up a blond Barbie swathed in pink, Black Perkins with a gentle rip of
Velcro removes a petal overskirt from Barbie's costume-ball gown. Holding it
to her face, she demonstrates how the overskirt doubles as a costume mask for
Barbie's owners.;    "Barbie's clothes are designed to have a lot of play
value," she explains.;    She holds up another Barbie. This one is wearing a
ruffled pink overskirt that, detached and reattached as a hem flounce,
converts a short gown to long. Or, Barbie can toss aside the ruffles on her
pretty white apron and "she's ready to cook.";    Fantasy wardrobe;  If most
of those little girls who own a Barbie -- and most are little girls -- have
never seen their mothers in either pink flounces or a frilly apron, never
mind. Barbie doesn't concern herself with criticisms from feminists that she
is a bimbo, a shop-till-you-drop airhead, a Barbie doll, if you will.;   
"This is not the way adults dress, and it's not the way they're going to dress
as adults," acknowledges Mattel spokeswoman Donna Gibbs. But, she adds, "They
live reality. They want to play fantasy.";    "If it's pretty," Black Perkins
says, "little girls want it." (If it's orange, or green, they probably won't,
she has found.);    Black Perkins did not set out to become designer to the
superstar of toyland. Growing up in South Carolina, she says, "I never had a
Barbie doll." She was 28 before she ever saw a Barbie. That was one fateful
day in the summer of 1976 when she answered a newspaper ad placed by Mattel.; 
  During that job interview -- to which she brought six years' experience
designing clothes for real people -- she was asked to take a Barbie home and
to bring her back in a week wearing a Black Perkins creation.;    What she
created was a floral print voile jumpsuit with full, tiered legs and puff
sleeves and matching wide-brimmed hat. "Really stylish," she recalled, "almost
like a garden party outfit.";    That jumpsuit never went into production, but
it got her the job. Black Perkins was incredulous -- "I couldn't believe they
actually paid people to do that.";    Right off, there were a few adjustments
to be made. As a student at Los Angeles Trade Technical College and later as a
designer for both junior and couture houses in Los Angeles, Black Perkins had
never created for a mannequin only 11 1/2 inches tall. (For the record, Barbie
has a 3 1/2-inch waist, a 5 1/2-inch bust and 5-inch hips.);    Although there
are seven other Barbie costume designers, and eight more who create her
accessories, Black Perkins designs about a fifth of what goes into Barbie's
bulging closets. She scours magazines, snoops through stores, goes to couture
shows in Europe.;    Although Black Perkins does buy on the open market,
increasingly fabrics are custom-spun at Mattel facilities in the Far East,
Europe and Mexico, where the doll and clothes are made.;    Although
seamstresses can fashion two bouffant skirts and 20 bodices for Barbie gowns
out of a mere eighth of a yard of fabric, 75 million yards of fabric have gone
into Barbie fashions over the years.;    The clothes for Barbie and Ken are
unisize, to fit all 11 male and female dolls in the Mattel fashion group.;   
On the conference table in front of Black Perkins stands Christie, Barbie's
black friend who was introduced in 1968. She wears a white lace bridal gown
with a tiny waist, big sleeves and detachable bridal bouquet.;    Christie is
a beautiful "bride," but, in designing for Barbie and boyfriend Ken and
assorted kith and kin, Black Perkins never loses sight of the fact that Barbie
is the star, "always.";    Annual wedding gown;  Barbie gets a new bridal gown
each year, and each year it's her top-selling fashion, with more than 5
million gowns sold. Of course, Black Perkins says, "It doesn't mean Barbie is
getting married. It just means she's dreaming about it." Barbie will never get
married. That would spoil the fantasy.;    Barbie is big business. In 1959 --
the year the doll was introduced -- Mattel sold 351,000 Barbies at $3 retail.
The company estimates sales of 600 million Barbies in 1990.;    A very basic
Barbie, with only undergarments, sells today for $6 or less. But Mattel
selling Barbie dolls is like Eveready selling flashlights. Flashlights require
batteries. Barbie requires clothes. Lots of clothes. To date, Barbie owners
have bought 250 million units of Barbie clothes and accessories. A lame gown
from Barbie's haute couture "private collection" may carry an $8 price tag,
but most are in the $3 to $4 range.;    The Barbie phenomenon has fascinated
psychologists and other observers of the popular culture. Black Perkins has
her own theory. When her 6-year-old daughter, Erika Nicole Perkins, plays with
Barbie, she explains, "She's in control. I'm still in control of what she's
wearing, but Barbie is hers."  </TEXT>

   Is Barbie on the brink of becoming a sales billionaire?
   Can Sewer Surfers break through the clutter of boys' toys?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Will Zen Intergalactic Ninja Warrior survive against the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?
   Toy retailers will ponder these questions as an estimated
12,000 buyers -- seeking to restock depleted store shelves --
pore over 5,000 new toys at the annual American International
Toy Fair in New York next week.
   Amid the uncertainty, one thing is clear: The mood at the
two-week show will be merry. Despite the recession, many toys
were sold out weeks before Christmas in 1991. And after five
years of flat sales, the industry is seeing its first real
uptick.
   "I can't remember as much optimism and buoyancy since
1987," says Sean McGowan, an analyst for Gerard, Klauer,
Mattison &amp; Co.
   The Toy Manufacturers Association estimates that toy
makers sold approximately $9.2 billion of products in 1991,
up about 5% from $8.8 billion in 1990. Says David Miller,
president of the association: "Interestingly, we're seeing
increases in just not the major manufacturers . . . but from
more than two-thirds of the 87 companies that report to us."
   Analysts note that manufacturers' sales in January were up
from a year ago, reflecting in part low inventory levels at
retail and foreshadowing more aggressive orders at Toy Fair.
"Toys "R" Us reduced their inventory by something like 15%
last year," notes John Taylor, an L.H. Alton &amp; Co. analyst.
"We're looking at some pentup demand."
   For the most part, though, exuberance won't be spawning
the extravagant experimentation of the 1980s, when electronic
toys became overnight hits -- and, just as quickly, expensive
flops. Caution remains the mainstay of the industry, whose
motto continues to be growth through diversification and
low-priced toys.
   "I think 1992 will be challenging for toy manufacturers
because of the economy not only in the U.S. but world-wide,"
says Alan Hassenfeld, chairman and chief executive officer of
Hasbro Inc., the nation's largest toy maker, which like many
other makers is concentrating on toys for under $10.
   Nor is the industry's most recent success story Playmates
Toys Inc., maker of the Ninja Turtles, screaming "Cowabunga]"
Turtles sales declined to $300 million in 1991 from $400
million the previous year, say analysts, who are projecting
another decline of $100 million this year. Richard Sallis, a
Playmates vice president, doesn't quarrel with the estimates:
"We're staying with low prices, watching inventory and being
conservative."
   The decline in Ninja Turtles, combined with a leveling off
in the video-game business, has prompted toy manufacturers to
step up production of boys' toys. But that doesn't guarantee
exciting toys in the category. "About 26 new boys' action
figures were shown at Toy Fair last year," notes Jack
Chojnacki, co-president of Those Characters From Cleveland, a
toy-inventing unit of American Greetings Co. "But most are
being discontinued this year."
   This year, toy makers will unveil more than 26 new
action-figure lines. From Hasbro's Kenner unit comes Savage
Mondo Blitzers, warriors that roll on wheels and bear names
like Brains Not Included, Sewer Surfers and Butt Kickers.
Just Toys Inc. will do even better. The New York company
purchased a license to produce Zen Intergalactic Ninja
Warrior from Mark Freedman, chairman of Surge Licensing,
which discovered the Ninja Turtles buried in a comic book.
"Right now, I could retire and go fishing," says Mr.
Freedman. "But I want to see if I can do it again."
   Certain to stir some controversy will be Tyco Toys Inc.'s
Incredible Crash Dummies, made in the likeness of Vince and
Larry, the two dummies featured in the Public Service
Announcements on television promoting the wearing of seat
belts.
   Kids have two options of play. With seat belts on, the
dummies remain in one piece when the test cars (which are
part of the toy line) crash. But without seat belts, the
dummies fly through a collapsible windshield and their heads,
arms and legs come apart when they hit the ground.
   "Kids are always into what the industry calls `crash and
bash,'" says Richard Grey, Tyco's chairman. "Some customers
who have placed orders with us thought there might be some
controversy because there will be activists who will find
things to object to." But he argues, "The violence is done to
dummies, not humans."
   Tyco has high hopes for the line, expecting sales of $40
million to $50 million in 1991. That would better the
first-year sales of $23 million for the Ninja Turtles in
1988.
   Action figures will be crossing the thin pink line into
girls' toys this year, as well. Playmates is coming out with
Swans Crossing, a line patterned after a cast of characters
from a new TV soap opera by the same name for young girls.
   The queen of girls' toys is Barbie. Since 1987, the Mattel
doll's sales have grown at a compounded rate of 13%, notes
John Amerman, the company's chairman. The line accounted for
$840 million of the company's $1.62 billion in revenues in
1991, he says, and could likely reach the $1 billion mark in
a year or two.
   Mattel, the industry's leading doll maker, can expect
stiff competition from Tyco, a large part of whose growth in
the last three years has come from its girls' toys business.
The contest will heat up particularly in the baby and toddler
dolls, a category referred to in the industry as large dolls
-- 18 inches to 20 inches high.
   Analysts say the large-doll segment has grown from $60
million in 1987 to more than $300 million last year. Tyco
this year puts its skating California Roller Baby up against
Mattel's Baby Roller Blade. Both battery-operated dolls can
skate by moving their feet one at a time.
   Pregnancy is also "in" in toyland. Mattel's My Bundle
Baby, has a heartbeat and kicks, which can be felt when
clutched. And Hasbro has Puppy Surprise and Kitty Surprise.
Both carry three to five offspring each. The surprise is
finding out how many there are after each purchase.
   Helped by a real-life baby boom, makers of preschool toys
are having a boom of their own. The preschool toy business
last year grew between 12% and 14%, notes Jill Krutick, an
analyst for Salomon Bros. Inc.
   Pricing isn't as big an issue with many preschool toys,
analysts say. "Parents are entering their prime spending
years," notes Ms. Krutick. Hoping to reach that affluent
crowd, Rubbermaid Inc.'s Little Tikes unit offers a $70 Mini
Van that comes with a toy cordless phone.
   Manufacturers, though still conscious that the nation
isn't out the economic doldrums yet, are taking a few risks
with a limited number of higher-priced toys. For example, CAP
Toys Inc. will show its $90 Nolan Ryan Strike Zone Baseball,
a game whose main feature is a built-in "announcer." Pitch a
ball over the electronically wired plate and the broadcaster
not only calls the pitch but gives an account of whether it
was hit by the batter, where it landed or who caught it.

   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Mattel Inc. wants Barbie, the
ultimate material girl, to strike it rich in Japan.
   After earlier, limited flings that were specifically
tailored for the Japanese market, the company has decided to
sell its toys there much as it sells them in the rest of the
world -- and to sell the same ones rather than specially
designed versions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mattel will unveil today a multimillion-dollar marketing
campaign to capture a chunk of one of the most promising but
formidable of all toy markets. Japan's toy manufacturer
shipments totaled about $3.6 billion last year, second only
to the U.S.'s $11.9 billion.
   Mattel, along with other U.S. toy makers, has had little
impact in Japan so far because of trade restrictions and
other barriers. Now, with change sweeping the Japanese retail
scene, it hopes to cash in on the affluence of Japanese
consumers.
   Japan has 16 million children in the company's target
group of boys and girls up to 10 years old, says Lindsey
Williams, Mattel International's president. By the end of the
decade, he says, Japan should be one of Mattel's top three
markets overseas.
   In today's announcement, Mattel will disclose the
formation of Mattel KK, a marketing subsidiary for Japan, and
the appointment of Dodwell as its marketing partner. Dodwell,
a subsidiary of Inchcape PLC, based in Britain, specializes
in packaged goods and has made extensive inroads in the
Japanese distribution system. The company will also appoint
McCann-Erickson Hakuhodo as its advertising agency.
   Nonetheless, Mattel will face some big hurdles.
Mom-and-pop stores still dominate Japan's tradition-bound
retail system, and retail outlets are linked to a cumbersome
wholesaler distribution network. In addition, while Japanese
consumers can be quite receptive to brand-name American
products, U.S. companies often stumble because of peripheral
issues.
   "Packaging is particularly important in Japan," says Ira
Bachrach, president of NameLab Inc., which has helped
position products there. "You can't depend on advertising
alone; it doesn't have the same direct, immediate impact that
it does here."
   Besides Barbie, the toy maker has high hopes that it will
eventually find a market in Japan for its other basic lines,
such as Hot Wheels die-cast cars and large dolls. Licensing
rights in Japan for Mattel's Walt Disney Co. infant and
preschool toys are being negotiated.
   But a sexier Barbie is leading the charge. Barbie's ties
to Japan date to 1958, when Mattel began manufacturing the
dolls there. And more than a decade ago, Mattel introduced
Barbie to Japanese consumers through a limited joint venture
with Bandai Co.
   But Mattel changed the look of its doll after Japanese
advisers insisted that a bosomy clotheshorse wouldn't appeal
to Japanese girls. As a result, she has sported the dark,
doe-eyed look of an ingenue and a decidedly flatter chest
than the voluptuous blue-eyed model sold everywhere else. Her
limbs also don't bend enough to allow her to hop casually
into a Barbie-sized Ferrari or climb the steps to a
Barbie-sized mansion, lucrative accessories that haven't been
widely available in Japan anyway.
   While market research did indicate that Japanese girls
preferred what they had been conditioned to accept, Mr.
Williams says that in hindsight, Mattel would have profited
from sticking to what works everywhere else. "This enormous
`World of Barbie' that we sell is one of fantasy and
aspiration," Mr. Williams says. "In Japan, we were never able
to develop the concept, because there were never any props."
   There was another problem that Mattel was slow to catch.
Girls in most countries lug shoeboxes stuffed with Barbie
regalia to friends' houses to play. But many Japanese girls
thought the doll belonged on display, like traditional
decorative Japanese dolls. That meant few additional dress
sales.
   Mattel is adopting another American-style twist: Pitch
directly to Junior, not Mom and Dad. United Nations
statistics show that the total discretionary income of
Japanese households now tops that of U.S. households. But
Mattel was operating "under the assumption that the Japanese
mother was a very stern gatekeeper," Mr. Williams says. "Our
recent research shows that the Japanese mother says she'll
buy whatever her girl asks for."
   Mattel will start selling directly to retail outlets,
essentially bypassing the wholesalers who have traditionally
had a lock on toy distribution. Mr. Williams says Dodwell can
help Mattel link up with a network of 1,400 mass merchandise
"superstores." The company also wants to tap into
increasingly popular Western-style shopping malls and into
department stores that attract shoppers interested in such
baubles as limited edition porcelain Barbies.
   Toys "R" Us, the giant U.S. toy discounter with strong
ties to Mattel, is also playing a useful role. Its
preparations to enter the Japanese market are shaking up the
retail end of the business, forcing wholesalers and retailers
to rethink their approaches, Mr. Williams says.
   Mattel thinks it can increase total annual fashion-doll
sales in Japan to between $125 million and $150 million in
three to five years. For the last few years, the fashion-doll
market has been relatively flat at less than $80 million. The
market for all Mattel products in Japan could hit $200
million in gross sales in seven to 10 years, Mr. Williams
says.
   The company is counting on overseas markets for much of
its growth over the next several years. International sales
jumped 36% last year to $750 million, compared with an
overall sales increase of 19%. Total sales were $1.47
billion.
   "We're not betting the company on this, but we're willing
to make a significant investment," Mr. Williams says of
Japan. And after three decades on the periphery, he adds with
a slight smile, "we've learned patience."

FT  17 SEP 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Why grown men dream

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The history of the US Mattel Toys company is the tale of everyday business
folk and a highly successful piece of plastic called Barbie. Last year the
company sold 54m fashion dolls.
This year it is likely to be 65m. 'When you do the arithmetic, that means
somewhere around the world we sell two Barbie dolls every second of every
day of every year,' says John Amerman, Mattel's silver-haired chairman and
chief executive. 'We think we are pretty good at meeting the desires and
dreams of little girls.'
Although Barbie's appeals have waned little throughout its 33-year history,
Mattel's shareholders have not always seen the rewards of it. Five years
ago, the company slumped to a net loss of Dollars 113m (Pounds 57.3m) as it
struggled with high overheads and an unresponsive management structure. But
since then, the company has staged a strong turnaround and last year
recorded operating income of Dollars 113m with analysts expecting further
improvement this year.
The main architect of the revival has been Amerman who has pragmatically
followed some classic marketing prescriptions to return the company to
profitability.
'I like to view Mattel as a consumer packaged goods company that just
happens to sell toys,' he says.
One of the most striking characteristics of the process has been the
constant product innovation which has been essential to increase sales. 'In
the US, about 95 per cent of girls between the ages of three to eight have a
Barbie doll and these girls have an average of seven dolls each. It is
important with a product like Barbie to have clear market segmentation,'
says Amerman.
Mattel boasts a standard My First Barbie doll which retails in the US for
less than Dollars 5.
But in her time, Barbie has also been a beach babe, a Mod, an airline pilot
and a Unicef ambassador. Mattel expects that one of her latest incarnations
as the Ultra Hair Barbie - complete with curlers and styling gels - will
sell 10m items in more than 100 countries.
At any one time there are about 50 models on sale, including limited-line
collectors' items. Mattel has recently discovered it can push the price of
special dolls far higher than previously imagined, breaking through the
Dollars 10 barrier.
Ideas for new dolls stem from several sources. The company conducts 'focus'
group work with girls in different countries to see how they respond to
concepts and has built up an extensive library of girls' magazines to keep
track of changing trends. The company employs 500 designers, development
engineers and model makers who constantly review and revise the Barbie line.
But Mattel has also learnt that it continually has to stimulate the consumer
market by means of heavy advertising and in-store promotions. Analysts
estimate the company spends up to 17 per cent of turnover promoting its
brands.
Mattel has also been able to generate greater consumer interest by winning
additional display space from retailers. To this end, Mattel began a
customer service programme three years ago visiting the biggest toy retail
chains and devising ways of improving operational relationships. Lower
prices have also led to increased sales volumes.
But there are signs that Barbie in the US is reaching the limits of growth
and Mattel is now rapidly expanding into other toy markets and pushing
Barbie harder overseas, where it already accounts for half of all sales.
'The future of our company is in international markets. The wants and
desires of little girls are the same around the world, whether it is combing
a doll's hair, changing their clothes, playing with Ken or thinking about
being an astronaut,' says Amerman.

   Look under Christmas trees across the country
this year, and you'll find packages with the name Nintendo waiting
for millions of children.
   The toy industry has its first mega-hit in two years in the
Japanese-made video game. But there are a lot of smaller, home-grown
hits as well, with familiar names like Barbie, G.I. Joe and Real
Ghostbusters leading the pack.
   Nintendo has surged to the forefront of the toy industry,
although it hasn't created the hysteria that Cabbage Patch Kids did
in the mid-1980s, when some stores had several near-riots as parents
fought over the dolls that were in short supply.
   But even without shoving matches among prospective buyers, the
video game is expected to rack up a phenomenal $1.7 billion in U.S.
sales for 1988, more than double the $800 million it had last year.
By comparison, Coleco Industries Inc.'s Cabbage Patch Kids did $600
million in 1985, their peak year.
   The toy industry as a whole is expecting sales to run about even
or slightly ahead of last year's $12.5 billion, according to the Toy
Manufacturers of America, a trade group. The lion's share of that
business is done at Christmas.
   This holiday season, several Nintendo games are among the
``must-have'' toys: Super Mario Brothers II, Zelda II and Double
Dragon.
   But industry watchers caution consumers to shop early, because
supplies of the chips needed to make the game cartridges have been
tight. Rick Anguilla, editor of the trade newspaper Toy &amp; Hobby
World, predicted, ``You can count on plenty of shortages for
Nintendo softwear.''
   Nintendo represents the first major hit in the toy industry since
Worlds of Wonder Inc.'s Lazer Tag in 1986. The video game also was
the standout last year, when the rest of the industry was in a slump.
   Nintendo's success has given the Japanese company a massive 85
percent share of the video game market, up from 70 percent at end of
1987, Anguilla estimated.
   The company's sales have come at the expense of U.S.-marketed
video games, such as Mattel Inc.'s Sega and Atari Corp.'s video
system. As a result, Hasbro Inc. recently announced it was
discontinuing its Nemo video game.
   Other toy companies, such as LJN, decided against competing with
Nintendo, and instead are producing Nintendo softwear under
licensing agreements, said Anguilla, who commented, ``If you can't
beat 'em, join 'em.''
   The Japanese import was one of the few high-tech items to succeed
in 1987. Consumers spent millions of dollars on Nintendo, but they
shunned other high-priced electronic toys in favor of dolls, board
games and preschool items like play food.
   Seeing this trend, manufacturers put greater emphasis in 1988 on
these toys, which cost less to produce and are more profitable.
   The U.S. companies also gave up their dependence on action
figures _ superheroes, aliens and robots _ tied to television shows.
The toy makers helped produce the shows, but when the segment
declined, they got out of the entertainment business, which had been
another expensive proposition.
   ``A lot of manufacturers out there are getting back to what they
do best, making toys,'' Anguilla said.
   Among the casualties in the action figure segment was Hasbro's
Inhumanoids.
   While the strategy of marketing figures with a TV show is fading,
television tie-ins are not completely dead. Universal-Matchbox's
talking Pee-Wee Herman doll and Kenner-Parker Toys' Real
Ghostbusters are among the TV figures that remain big sellers,
according to Angela Bourdon, a spokeswoman for Toys R Us Inc., the
nation's largest toy store chain.
   Other action figures that are popular are Kenner-Parker's
Starting Lineup, which is based on real-life athletes, and
Playmate's Mutant Ninja Turtles.
   G.I. Joe, Hasbro's military action figure and a perennial
favorite, also continues to thrive.
   Other big sellers among boys' toys are radio-controlled cars; Hot
Wheels by Mattel; and Micro Machines, small cars and trucks produced
by Lewis Galoob Toys Inc.
   Micro Machines have helped Galoob recover from its 1987 slump,
when the company _ like many other toy manufacturers _ over-invested
in expensive high-tech failures.
   For girls, Mattel's Barbie is expected to have her best year ever
as she approaches the grand old age of 30.
   Some newer entries in the doll market are also expected to have a
good season. Those cited by Anguilla and Ms. Bourdon included Lewis
Galoob's Bouncin' Babies, 7-inch-tall, battery-operated dolls;
Hasbro's Dolly Surprise, which has hair that grows; and Mattel's
Little Miss Makeup.
   ``Dolls are going to be a monster category,'' Anguilla predicted.
   Play food _ those miniature cans of soup and vegetables _ was a
surprise hit last year and continues strong in 1988.
   Fisher-Price's Fun With Food, which led the preschool segment in
1987, is doing well again this year. The company has extended the
line to include its Magic Scan Checkout, a pretend supermarket
checkout counter that Ms. Bourdon labeled a big seller at Toys R Us.
   Among board games, Pictionary by Games Gang Ltd. and its
counterpart from Hasbro's Milton Bradley line, called Win, Lose or
Draw, are expected to remain big sellers.
   Securities analysts say the toy industry's strategy shift, plus
extensive cost-cutting among the big U.S. firms, is returning the
business to profitability. Last year, all the major companies except
Hasbro ended up in the red.
   ``In 1988 you've seen these companies stabilize and build a
foundation for future growth,'' said Paul Valentine, an analyst with
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. ``You're going to see a real resurgence by
the American companies.''

   After a 13-year furlough, the original G.I. Joe, is back
-- for limited duty.
   In an unusual move, Hasbro Inc., maker of the doll, has
produced an early version of the Great American Hero
exclusively for Target Stores.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Target, a division of Dayton Hudson Corp., which featured
the doll in newspaper advertisements this weekend, hopes the
doll will give the chain, in Minneapolis, a slight edge in
battling competitors.
   "This is a coup in itself for Target," declared Mark
Pritchard, a Target toy buyer who thought up the idea.
   To be sure, the exclusive arrangement has irked a few
rival toy retailers. "My buyers were aware of this and they
were pretty upset about it," said Ronald Tuchman, president
of Child World Inc., Avon, Mass. But he added, Child World
plans "to aggressively pursue similar deals with toy
manufacturers."
   Indeed, Hasbro, is talking to a couple of toy retailers
about the possibility of striking similar limited edition
agreements to manufacture G.I. Joe, though production
wouldn't be for this Christmas, a spokesman for the
Pawtucket, R.I., toy maker said.
   Such arrangements, though rare in the toy industry, could
become more frequent soon. Mattel Inc., in El Segundo,
Calif., has assigned special staff to explore one-on-one
agreements. It has arranged deals with individual retailers
for the Christmas introduction of a line of Peter Pan
characters called Hook, a company spokesman said.
   The practice is fairly common in other markets. Tony
department stores are eager to get exclusive regional rights
to launch fragrances, such as the new Spellbound, believing
the excitement it generates will give them an edge, no matter
how fleeting. They also cut deals with clothing designers to
be the only chain in their region to carry a style -- and
sometimes an entire line.
   "Retailers are always looking for ways to come up with
exclusives," says Carl Steidtmann, chief economist at the
Management Horizons unit of Price Waterhouse accountants, New
York. "In many cases, they'll put an extra feature on or
change a color and say it's an exclusive."
   Chains today get exclusive rights to everything from
telephones to appliances and mattresses, with only slight
variations from models offered by competitors. In another
twist, Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Chicago, is selling an
exclusive line of Admiral-brand televisions and videocassette
recorders under a licensing agreement with Maytag Corp.,
Newton, Iowa, which owns the trademark.
   Exclusivity can be beneficial for both manufacturer and
retailer.
   "It's a nice piece of incremental business for the toy
maker, and it gives the retailer a point of distinction,"
explained a spokesman for Mattel, which now makes customized
toys and gift sets for a number of retailers.
   Target, for instance, has "Golden Evening" Barbie, a
dress-up doll, that no other chain carries. Likewise Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., a unit of Walton Enterprises Inc., Bentonville,
Ark., has a lavender attired "Ballroom Barbie" and F A O
Schwarz, New York, has "Nights Sensation Barbie."
   For toy makers it is also a less risky approach to testing
new ideas, added a Hasbro spokesman. The company will closely
watch Target's sales to determine the viability of bringing
back the old Joe, he noted.
   Moreover exclusive toys afford retailers the luxury of
pricing items, without worrying about matching a competitor's
tag.
   G.I. Joe is a case under study, at least for a few
retailers.
   The toy -- introduced in 1964 and then pulled from the
market in 1978 -- is 12 inches tall, nearly three times the
size of the Joe found in toy stores today. A collector's
choice, particularly among those who grew up playing with the
doll, the old Joe, in mint condition, commands thousands of
dollars on the market.
   At KMart Corp. in Troy, Mich., boys toy buyer Kerry MacVay
said he was surprised when he heard about the exclusive
arrangement from his Hasbro contacts three months ago. But he
isn't pushing Hasbro to sell him any dolls -- yet.
   "I'm a little more skeptical than the Target people," he
says, explaining that he's taking a wait-and-see approach on
military toys. "My initial thoughts were it's a collectors
item," he adds. "If this works, {Hasbro is} planning on
coming out with a full assortment. They will get behind it
and that's when I will get involved."
   Mr. MacVay acknowledges that, in retailing, "it's
important to get out on the leading edge of something." If
the doll sells well at Target, he admits, "I'll kick myself
for not thinking about it first."
   A spokesman for Wal-Mart said that the discount chain's
toy buyers "haven't had time to talk to Hasbro about it.
Their plans were to talk with Hasbro, but it would be later
in the year."
   Exclusive deals, however, are a delicate matter. Mattel
sidesteps potential controversy by offering to make "private
label" toys for all retailers. The distinguishing point of a
toy could just be the color of a doll's dress or the
trimmings of a car.
   Hasbro apparently has left plenty of room for similar
maneuvering in agreeing to manufacture Target's Joe.
   The new doll, called "Duke," is fashioned after only one
of several hundred G.I. Joe characters, developed over the
years.
   Duke is 12 inches tall, and like the old Joe, comes in a
camouflage outfit made of cloth. The current crop of Joes
come in plastic clothes that are pasted on to the figure. But
not to be outdated, Duke carries a modern electronic light
and sound weapon, included separately in the box.
   The remake of old Joe isn't expected to impact the
collectors' market since the "Duke" character was created
only after the second generation of G.I. Joes was introduced
in 1982, and won't be confused with any from the old cast.
   Target officials won't disclose how many of the Duke dolls
will go on sale. Insiders put the number at 80,000, each of
which is individually numbered and comes in a package,
stamped with a gold seal. The doll retails for $22, a little
more than what the average action figure sells for.
   Duking it out with toy supermarkets, like Toys "R" Us
Inc., Rochelle Park, N.J., and Child World, which offer a
much broader selection of toys, can be a struggle for
department and discount stores. "Duke gives us a little
something extra against the super stores," Mr. Pritchard of
Target said.

<TEXT>  A It may be an innocent gesture, but presenting a Hispanic or Asian child with
a blond, blue-eyed doll may not end up being the gift you intended.;   "By
giving a child only white dolls, you're sending the message to the child that
they should aspire to be white," says Chris Jacobs, an adoption coordinator
with the National Adoption Center in Philadelphia.;   "It will be difficult
for Korean-born children living in white families to accept their heritage if
only white images are put in front of them.";   Slightly older children who
have only been given white dolls previously may need some special introduction
to the new dolls, advises Darleen P. Hopson, co-author of "Different and
Wonderful: Raising Black Children in a Race-conscious Society" (Prentice Hall
Press, $19.95).;   "Don't immediately take away their white dolls, because
children form very strong attachments to them," says Hopson, who studies
children's play with dolls.;   Rather, show your child that you value the new
doll by praising it, holding and playing with it, Hopson says. Then offer it
to your child to hold "for just a few minutes." The goal is to make the doll
irresistible, and when you're satisfied that the child covets it, offer it to
him or her.;   As this aunt from Phoenix has discovered, finding dolls of
various ethnicities can be a challenge.;   "We haven't seen that many quality,
multiethnic dolls at toy shows around the country, particularly in the past
couple of years," says Adrienne Pagel, who operates The Heritage Key, a toy
catalog.;   "Toy companies have been hit hard by the recession, and they're
not willing to put out the money to expand their lines.";   Thanks to the many

   They rolled out the pink carpet at Lincoln
Center, where the celebrities wore pink roses and sipped pink
champagne and pink Perrier. But the guest of honor didn't so much as
blush.
   That's not surprising _ she was Barbie, the doyenne of fashion
dolls, who was honored Monday night for her successful 30-year
career as one of the most popular American toys.
   Mattel Inc. billed the black-tie affair as Barbie's ``Pink
Jubilee'' anniversary party. Company executives said the lavish
party, which helped kick off the annual toy industry fair, was a
fitting tribute to a toy that has shown such remarkable longevity _
and profitability.
   ``Whatever the cost is, I think it's worth it,'' said John W.
Amerman, Mattel's chairman and chief executive officer.
   Although her popularity has waned now and then, Barbie has never
fallen completely out of favor. She has been one of the most
consistent toys in an industry notorious for quickly fading fads.
Barbie was the nation's second biggest-selling toy last year, after
Nintendo video games, according to Toy &amp; Hobby World magazine.
   Each year, Barbie dolls pull in $450 million to $500 million in
revenue for Mattel.
   Part of the doll's success is credited to her adaptability. As
lifestyles and fashions changed over the years, Barbie's clothes and
accessories kept pace.
   Guests at Barbie's party were entertained by teen-age girls
performing the ``Barbie Rap'' and doing the ``Barbie'' dance. The
rap number was interspersed with spoken tributes from several female
celebrities, including singer Melba Moore and actresses Allison
Smith, of the television show ``Kate &amp; Allie,'' and Nancy Dussault,
who has performed in the Broadway play ``Into The Woods.''
   New York Mayor Edward Koch marked the occasion by sending fan
mail.
   ``She has always reflected the times, and today stimulates the
imagination and delight of another generation,'' Koch wrote.
``Barbie's appearance in a wide variety of ethnic guises makes her a
great toy for New York, a city which draws unique energy from its
unparalleled ethnic diversity.''
   An audiovisual retrospective of the doll's 30 years set to tunes
on the pop charts during the different periods cataloged Barbie's
numerous wardrobe changes.
   In the early 1960s, a conservatively dressed Barbie was depicted
as a wholesome 21-year-old with a fun-loving streak who turned up,
bikini-clad, at beach parties every so often.
   Later on, Barbie donned ``mod'' clothing and her normally
clean-cut boyfriend Ken grew his hair almost shoulder length.
   More recently, Barbie has become a briefcase-toting career woman.
   This year finds Barbie characterized as a superstar, decked out
in a star-encrusted tulle gown as the reigning queen of the fashion
doll world. If she lives up to her reputation, the other dolls will
be pink with envy.

FT  23 DEC 92 / Sindy to undergo facelift after angry legal spat with Barbie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINDY, once Britain's favourite doll, is to undergo plastic surgery to
settle a long-running international legal dispute with Barbie, her older and
more successful American rival.
Hasbro, manufacturer of Sindy, agreed yesterday to re-model her head to
distinguish her from Barbie, made by Mattel. The settlement was reached
shortly before a copyright battle between the two US companies was due to go
to the UK High Court next month.
The dispute began after Hasbro acquired the licence to Sindy from Pedigree,
the UK toy company, in 1986 and set about altering her appearance.
The previously demure tweed-clad Sindy suddenly acquired a more glamorous
face, while her body acquired shapely curves.
Mattel responded with a barrage of lawsuits, charging that Sindy had become
an imitation of Barbie.
Earlier this year, stocks of Sindy were seized after a French court ruled
that the doll violated Barbie's copyright. Mattel has also won cases against
Hasbro in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.
Barbie, who is sold in a variety of models and costumes, is believed to be
the most successful toy range of all time. Since she was launched 33 years
ago, more than 700m Barbie dolls have been sold in almost 70 countries, and
Mattel expects sales this year to be worth a record Dollars 1bn (Pounds
600m).
According to Mattel, a Barbie doll is sold every two seconds, and 98 per
cent of American girls between the ages of 3 and 11 own one at some point.
Sindy, born in 1961, has always sold mostly in Britain, where she had the
market to herself until the late 1970s. Today, her sales in Britain are
estimated to be three times greater than the roughly Pounds 8m achieved by
her rival.
Mattel said yesterday that it had agreed to drop all outstanding lawsuits
relating to Sindy and Barbie around the world and that the two companies
would pay their own legal costs.
Just how much difference Sindy's planned facelift will have on sales is
uncertain. According to Mr Barry Walker, deputy chairman of the British
Association of Toy Retailers: 'It's only crusty old blokes in toy showrooms
who care about these things. The kids don't notice.'

FT  29 OCT 94 / Barbie - the virgin queen of a plastic paradise - The
world's most famous doll is 35 but never ages / A look back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
It has been quite a year for Barbie, the most popular doll in history. Born
on March 9 1959, her 35th birthday has been celebrated all over the world;
Columbia Studios is bidding for the rights to make her a film star; and
Sheik Khaled Al Madkour, president of a committee in Kuwait City which
advises the government on religious issues, has declared that to buy her is
forbidden by Islam.
There is no such veto in Monte Carlo where the National Museum is hosting an
exhibition in her honour. It is drawn from the collection of one person:
Jean-Pierre Icardo, an office worker from Nice who has 'between 700 and 800'
Barbie dolls. Now 40, he first saw Barbie in 1964, the year she was
introduced to France. He has been her faithful admirer ever since.
As a child, Icardo was enchanted by all forms of decoration and wanted to
work in the theatre or cinema. As he grew up, he made his own theatrical
tableaux at home and put on entertainments for his friends, using dolls as
actors. But traditional dolls were stiff and it was not possible to dress or
pose them satisfactorily. Barbie, with her long legs, slim body and
beautiful outfits, was the perfect solution. 'I fell in love,' he says,
simply.
After attending Nice University, he took an office job and continued to
weave his theatrical dreams at home, always with Barbie as his star. His
collection grew slowly: the dolls were expensive and his mother saved up to
buy them for him as birthday and Christmas gifts. 'I believed I was unique,'
he says. 'I had no idea there were other grown-ups who were collecting.'
In March 1984, though, a convention of doll and automata collectors was held
in Monaco. Icardo and his mother went along and were astonished to find all
the paraphernalia of an established Barbie collectors' market, including
books with descriptions of the dolls and how to recognise their ages and
dates. In fact, adult collecting of Barbie began in the US in the 1970s and
the first Barbie encyclopaedia was written in 1975. Now, there are Barbie
conventions every year.
Collectors often specialise, some buying only Barbie and shunning her family
and friends, some buying only Barbies from the 1960s, now the most expensive
period. Icardo tries to collect everything from 1964 onwards, conceding that
his collection grows 'only very slowly - the world of Barbie is so huge'.
Mattel, the company that created Barbie, makes limited editions especially
for the collectors' market. Unique examples of older or special dolls, such
as the very early versions made in ivory white plastic, now change hands for
up to Dollars 4,000.
Icardo's devotion extends to Barbie's friends and relations. This year, he
told me, is also the 30th anniversary of her sister Skipper. Her best
friend, Midge, will have her 30th anniversary next year. Ken, Barbie's
faithful consort, was born in 1961. 'But she will never marry Ken,' Icardo
insists. 'She must stay the young teenager for ever.'
When first launched, Barbie was not popular with parents who, rather like
Sheikh Khaled, thought her 'too sexy'. Her popularity with young girls was
instant, however, and there are thought to be 700m of her worldwide. Today,
Barbie and Ken lead a hectic life as their clothes, make-up and hair styles
change constantly with the times: last year alone, Barbie had 100 outfits
from which to choose.
While Barbie's unique proportions have never changed, Ken has been altered
several times. His earliest skinny body has been made bigger and his fragile
flock velvet hair (now much prized if found in pristine condition) replaced
with more practical paint or, for special occasions, wigs.
Their world, too, has expanded from homely junior proms and fraternity
meetings to a frantic round of globe-trotting and activities that include
every kind of sport, making television programmes and even ballet dancing.
Barbie's circle of friends reflects a changing America. Her first black
friend, a girl doll dating from the mid-1960s, was followed by the grown-up
Brad in 1970 and Cara and Curtis in 1975. The first Hispanic and Asiatic
friends appeared in the 1980s and an American Indian was added to the circle
recently.
The all-American girl has only recently been made at home, though.
Originally manufactured in Japan from 1959, Barbie's production cycle has
followed the global trail of multi-national investment and new sources of
cheap labour. She is now made at 15 locations in seven countries: Mexico,
China, Malaysia, Indonesia, UK and Italy, as well as the US.
Some Barbies were produced briefly under licence in various countries, so
allowing regional differences to creep in; this resulted in her being more
sun-tanned in Spain and smaller, with huge cartoon-style eyes, in Japan. But
this has been stopped and uniformity reigns. Icardo considers this 'very
sad'.
Barbie, of course, is not just a pretty face. When I expressed a certain
envy of her lifestyle, and pointed out that she never had to work for a
living, Icardo was quick to disagree. 'She always works,' he said. 'She has
been a model and a singer. This year, she was a doctor. She and Ken have
been in the army, taking part in Desert Storm; and in the 1960s, the great
days of Nasa, she was an astronaut.'
This year's Christmas model will talk and answer questions; one released
earlier swims and dives. Truly, she is a superwoman 'at the centre of her
world', as Icardo puts it. Perhaps, though, it takes another woman to spot a
few snags.
To me, it seems obvious that, as she approaches 40, Barbie faces the same
problems as the women who have tried to emulate her - success, fame, and
glamour do not necessarily bring fulfilment. And few of them have made her
supreme sacrifice. For Barbie - astronaut, soldier, fashion icon - has never
had sex. Forever dreaming of romantic weddings - dresses for which feature
among her sister's outfits, if not her own - her relationship remains
unconsummated.
Despite the sexual message of her appearance - huge breasts, heavy make-up,
ever more sophisticated clothes - Barbie must remain untouched. She is an
Eve who cannot fall, in a paradise filled not with flowers and fruit but
with products. The message she brings is to look, to dream - and then, to
buy.
La Poupee Barbie, Anniversaire a Monaco, continues at the Musee National de
Monaco, 17, Avenue Princesse Grace, Monte Carlo, until September 30. Barbie
can also be seen with 33 outfits specially made for her by top French
couturiers at the Musee Grevin, Paris, until December 31.

<LEADPARA>  CASE 91-6111 in the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals may present itself as a dry
quarrel over jurisdiction between the U.S. Customs Service and the federal
courts. But beneath the arid prose of the warring briefs pulses a desperate
cat-fight between two icons of American womanhood: Barbie and Miss America.;  
 Barbie says Miss America ripped off her head.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  THE SAD CASE OF BARBIE VS. MISS AMERICA  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Stories  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Not the real Miss America, but a new doll based on Miss America, introduced
in February as a joint venture between the Miss America Pageant and Kenner
Products.;    "Miss America" is Kenner's attempt to crack Barbie's 32-year
stranglehold on the toy category known as "fashion dolls." But in March
Barbie's parent, Mattel Inc., complained to Customs that two of the five "Miss
America" models look too much like Barbie.;    Back in 1977, Mattel
copyrighted Barbie's head, making her eternal look of compliant joy a
protected expression -- literally. In April, Customs made a preliminary
finding that Mattel might have a point, and seized a shipment of the "Miss
America" dolls from China, pending a full review. Kenner is now has taken its
case to the 2nd Circuit.;    Miss America's attorney, Carol F. Simkin, says in
papers filed in court that Mattel is trying to assert copyright ownership of
the ineffable.;    "There can be no infringement because the only
similarities, if any, between the doll heads lie not in protectable
expression," said Simkin, "but in those generic features necessary to depict a
fashion doll head and in the common elements inherent in the human face.";   
Arthur J. Levine, Barbie's lawyer, says, "We have absolutely no problem with
anyone creating an 11 1/2-inch doll that Barbie's clothes fit on. But when you
come too close to an American icon, we don't like it.";    Only the face and
head are at issue in the case, which was publicized earlier this month by
Legal Times. While the bodies of the dolls seem astonishingly similar -- the
same impossibly elongated thighs, the same bullet-like breasts, the same
hinged shoulders and convenient pelvic vagueness -- Mattel alleges that two of
the Miss Americas, made from the same mold and named "Devon" and "Tonya,"
stole the design for the head. They also reserved the right to take action
against "Blair," telling customs that only "Racquel" and "Justine" pass
muster.;    To read the briefs is to be swept into a confusing debate over how
American womanhood is idealized in toys.;    Barbie ends up arguing that she
is an act of creative expression as legally "protectable" as a cartoon or a
poem; that she looks nothing like a human being.;    Miss America says that,
if you're going to manufacture stereotypes of feminine beauty, then of course
they're all going to look alike.;    "The faces of fashion dolls must have the
pretty features expected of most fashion models," says Miss America's brief.
"They also must have the stock features commonly used in the toy industry to
make a fashion doll head look attractive, including pert noses, eyes that are
made-up and exaggerated in terms of both size and distance from each other . .
. smiling, full lips, painted-on eyebrows and similarly sized heads.";   
Barbie argues that Kenner's designers might have unconsciously imitated
Barbie: If you're trying to generate an ideal of feminine beauty, this
argument goes, your thoughts are just naturally going to turn to Barbie.;   
Lawyers on both sides of the case -- expected to be decided in the next few
months -- express the belief that there is a somber legal matter at issue
here. Kenner is arguing that a federal court should be able to quickly decide
whether Miss America infringes Barbie's copyright. Barbie -- joined by a
heavyweight coalition of American business interests who have a stake in
preventing imports of cheap foreign knock-offs of their products -- argue that
Kenner's motion would undercut Customs' power to seize infringing imports.;   
Miss America, on the other hand, charges "that Mattel was more concerned with
damaging a competitor's business than protecting its own alleged copyright."; 
  But it's over the specific looks of the dolls that the real biting and
scratching takes place.;    "Devon's eyes are larger and differently shaped
than Barbie's and are positioned near the vertical middle of the head," says
the Kenner brief, "whereas Barbie's eyes are smaller, flatter and lower on the
head; the bridge of Devon's nose is much fuller and her nostrils are less
defined than Barbie's; Devon's lips are thicker and form an open smile, while
Barbie's smile is closed and shows less teeth.";    Unasked in all this legal
activity is the question of which busty, plasticene young lady is the better
role model for America's little girls.;    On the one hand, Barbie has an
impressive resume these days: She is in the Army and the Navy; she has tried
stints as an astronaut, a scuba diver, a doctor, an executive, a rock star and
a veterinarian.;    On the other hand: Can Barbie play the ocarina?  </TEXT>

<HEAD>There's More to Toy Shopping Than Video Games This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Though video games again will be a big hit under
Christmas trees this year, dolls familiar from parents' childhoods,
speedy new miniature cars and other traditional-type toys are
expected to be popular.
   U.S. toymakers likely will have only ho-hum sales during the
crucial holiday season, but business still promises to be slightly
better than last year's flat sales performance.
   ``Most manufacturers are looking at flat sales again. My gut
feeling is it's going to be a little better than anticipated,''
said Larry Carlat, editor of the trade magazine Toy &amp; Hobby World.
   Michael Goldstein, vice chairman of Toys `R' Us Inc., said the
retailer forsees good holiday business based on the performance of
a proven lineup.
   ``We expect to have a good Christmas with strength in video,
dolls, action figures and die-cast cars,'' he said.
   Sales remain brisk for Nintendo home video game systems,
compatible game cartridges and other gadgets that work with the
machines that turn televisions into game screens.
   Fancier, pricier machines from other manufacturers, featuring
souped up graphics, also are moving quickly, confirming that the
three-year-old video game fad hasn't faded.
   From NEC Corp. comes the TurboGrafx-16 system and Sega of
America Inc. is offering Genesis. Both retail for around $200,
making them about twice the price of Nintendo's device.
   Handheld computer games could satisfy shoppers searching for
something slightly different _ if they can find them.
   Transistor radio-sized Game Boy from Nintendo is selling fast at
about $89.99 and the company says it doesn't expect to have nearly
enough to meet demand.
   On Tuesday, Nintendo rival Atari Corp. unveiled its own handheld
video game, called Lynx. It sells for a stiff $179, but features
sharper, color graphics compared with Game Boy's fuzzier,
black-and-white images.
   Nintendo has been a standout for the past two Christmases while
the rest of the toy business was slumping. Nintendo of America
Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of Japan's Nintendo Co. Ltd., estimates
that its sales will grow to $2.6 billion this year from $1.7
billion in 1988. Industrywide, electronic game sales will rise to
$3.4 billion from $2.3 billion, Nintendo says.
   Nintendo's success has come at the expense of American
toymakers, who have been controlling costs more closely and taking
a cautious approach to new product introductions for fear that a
major flop could mean major losses.
   The cost controls and caution have helped U.S. companies
maintain profitability despite lackluster sales growth.
   ``In 1989, we've seen every toy company run a very tight ship,''
said analyst David S. Leibowitz of American Securities Corp. ``The
bottom line for most of the major toy companies will be running
significantly further ahead than the top line.''
   The toy industry is expecting sales, excluding electronics, as
high as $13.25 billion this year, according to the Toy
Manufacturers of America, a trade group. The bulk of that business
is done at Christmas. Sales totaled $12.75 billion in 1988, a small
improvement from 1987's $12.5 billion.
   Besides the wave of video games, this year's popular toys are
likely to include many that have been around for awhile in one form
or another, stores and industry experts say.
   Mattel Inc.'s Barbie remains the darling of the doll world, and
after 30 hasn't encountered a newcomer she can't clobber in sales.
Barbies start at about $11.
   Bigger dolls, some new, some old, also have hit their potential
this year. Oopsie Daisy, a doll that crawls, falls down and crawls
again, is selling well, said Angela Bourdon of Toys `R' Us. The
16-nch baby doll from Tyco Toys Inc. costs around $35.
   The winsomely ugly Cabbage Patch Kids, under new parent company
Hasbro, are attempting a comeback and trying to repeat the buying
hysteria they created in the mid-1980s.
   Other hot dolls are Mattel's Li'l Miss Dressup and Li'l Miss
Makeup, gurgling Baby Bubbles, Tiny Tears and Betsy Wetsy under the
Ideal brand name, and Dolly Surprise from Hasbro Inc.'s Playskool
division.
   Action figures, which start at under $10, will have another busy
Christmas. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles from Playmates Toys Inc.,
Real Ghostbusters and Robocop from Tonka Corp.'s Kenner Products
division are some red-hot figures, as is the granddaddy of them
all, Hasbro's G.I. Joe.
   Miniature cars have proven their popularity and should have
another good year, led by Lewis Galoob Toys Inc.'s Micro Machines.
   Super fast cars were rolled out for this Christmas amid much
fanfare but toy watchers say sales could stall once the initial
advertising roar dies down. The battery-powered vehicles have been
a smash in Japan since debuting there in late 1987. Sporting names
like Hyper Drivers and Record Breakers, these high-performance
model racing cars zoom at around 30 miles an hour.
   The electronic game craze has renewed interest in board games.
Some of the sought-after titles include Encore and Shark Attack
from Hasbro's Milton Bradley Co.
   But analysts doubt any of the abundant lineup of toys will be
sensational enough to steal the limelight from video games.
   ``There are not a lot of new products that are making noise,''
said Carlat, of Toy &amp; Hobby World. ``There's no blockbuster _
except Nintendo.''

<TEXT>     For the past two years, Cathy Meredig has worked to fashion a politically
correct doll whose measurements aren't worthy of the Guinness Book of World
Records. And "Happy To Be Me" was finally unveiled this week.;    "If you look
at Barbie you'll see that her waist is half her chest. And that chest!" said
Brian Leininger, Meredig's husband and partner in their Minnesota company,
High Self-Esteem Toys. "Her eyes take up half her face. She looks like she's
going through life in a daze.";    Leininger said the "Happy To Be Me" doll
has much more realistic proportions. If Barbie had a 36-inch bust she would be
36-18-33, but Happy's less optimistic measurements would be 36-27-38.;   
"Cathy got upset by the message Barbie was sending to kids. Many girls are
very unhappy with their body image," Leininger said. "The fashion industry has
been sending girls a fairy tale but an unhealthy fairy tale. We're saying
you're terrific the way you are.";    Barbie loyalists are dismissing Happy as
just another flash in the pan without the right stuff to knock the Mattel
queen off her throne.;    "Barbie is like a dress model. Everyone knows that
when you have a dress form you adjust it," said Evelyn Burkhalter, founder of
the Barbie Hall of Fame in Palo Alto. "If you talk to any little girl, I bet
there isn't one who would complain about how Barbie's bust measurements relate
to her feet.;    "Barbie has followed fashion; this doll is trying to propose
it," Burkhalter said. "It won't work."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   (During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.) 

   BARBIE, A WELL-GROOMED PLATINUM BLONDE standing less than a foot tall, arrived in 1959 as toylands first "fashion doll." 
Her debut was greeted with skepticism. 
No child (or, more importantly, no parent) would buy a full-fashioned doll, the experts said. 
Last Year, Barbie and her well-dressed playmates produced more than $450 million for Mattel Inc. of California. 
In 30 years, children have bought and dressed more than 500 million of them. 
Mattel figures that 90% of girls aged 3 to 11 own at least one Barbie. 

   Ruth Handler, whose husband, Elliott, had started Mattel, created Barbie, naming her after their daughter Barbara. 
When Barbie caught on (351,000 were sold the first year at $3 a copy) Mrs. Handler produced Barbie's friend Ken, named for their son, a gallery of companions and a stable of pets and favorite cars (the latest, a Ferrari). 

   Barbie, who began as a teen-age fashion model, has appeared as a ballerina, a nurse, a flight attendant, an astronaut, a candy striper, a TV newscaster and a rock star. 
Each role, of course, meant a fresh wardrobe. 
Mattel sells some 20 million new outfits a year at $1 to $8 apiece. 

   The Handlers themselves did not fare quite as well. 
In 1974, the Securities and Exchange Commission descended on the company, charging that it had been reporting false earnings to keep the stock price high. 
The Handlers were forced out as directors and co-chairmen (but not as stockholders) and left saying they "deeply regretted" any damage. 

   But Ruth Handler hadn't lost her creative touch. 
After undergoing a mastectomy in 1970, she found that no one was producing suitable prostheses. 
So she designed her own, called "Nearly Me," and thus began another successful business. 

   And doll makers didn't forget the Handlers. 
This year they were inducted into the toy industry's Hall of Fame at a New York gala.

   A shimmering pink carpet was rolled out in front
of the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center on Monday night for
1,200 guests attending an unusual gala.
   Inside, women received wristlets of pink roses as they entered a
hall adorned with pink festoons. Waiters served pink champagne, or
rosy-hued Perrier if guests preferred, to accompany canapes served
on platters bedecked with pink orchids.
   Lights flashed as cameras recorded several stage and television
celebrities taking part in the festivities.
   But the star of the event didn't blink an eye. That's not
surprising _ she was Barbie, the doyen of fashion dolls who was
being honored for 30 years as a phenomenally successful toy.
   Mattel Inc. billed the black-tie affair as Barbie's ``Pink
Jubilee'' anniversary party. Company executives said the lavish
party was a fitting tribute to a toy that has shown such remarkable
longevity _ and profitability.
   ``Whatever the cost is, I think it's worth it,'' said John W.
Amerman, Mattel's chairman and chief executive officer.
   ``We don't spare the expense in presenting Barbie in a
first-class way,'' added Robert Sansone, Mattel's president.
   Although her popularity has waned now and then, Barbie has never
fallen completely out of favor. She has been one of the most
consistent toys in an industry notorious for quickly fading fads.
Barbie was the nation's second biggest selling toy last year, after
Nintendo video games, according to Toy &amp; Hobby World magazine.
   Each year, Barbie dolls pull in $450 million to $500 million in
revenue for Mattel.
   Part of the doll's success is credited to her adaptability. As
lifestyles and fashions changed over the years, Barbie's clothes and
accessories kept pace.
   Guests at Barbie's party were entertained by teen-aged girls
performing the ``Barbie Rap'' and doing the ``Barbie'' dance. The
rap number was interspersed with spoken tributes from several female
celebrities, including singer Melba Moore and actresses Allison
Smith, of the television show ``Kate &amp; Allie,'' and Nancy Dussault,
who has performed in the Broadway play ``Into The Woods.''
   New York Mayor Edward Koch marked the occasion by sending fan
mail. Mattel's Sansone read the mayor's letter before introducing
the entertainment.
   ``She has always reflected the times, and today stimulates the
imagination and delight of another generation,'' Koch wrote.
``Barbie's appearance in a wide variety of ethnic guises makes her a
great toy for New York, a city which draws unique energy from its
unparalleled ethnic diversity.''
   An audio-visual retrospective of the doll's 30 years set to tunes
on the pop charts during the different periods catalogued Barbie's
numerous wardrobe changes.
   In the early 1960s, a conservatively dressed Barbie was depicted
as a wholesome 21-year-old with a fun-loving streak who turned up,
bikini-clad, at beach parties every so often.
   Later on, Barbie donned ``mod'' clothing and her normally
clean-cut boyfriend Ken grew his hair almost shoulder length.
   More recently, Barbie has become a briefcase-toting career woman.
   This year finds Barbie characterized as a super star, decked out
in a star-encrusted tulle gown as the reigning queen of the fashion

   LOS ANGELES -- Mattel Inc. said it signed an exclusive
licensing agreement with Price Stern Sloan Inc. to produce a
series of books, including a cookbook, based on its Barbie
doll toy.
   The books will add to a plethora of products Mattel is
introducing around the image of Barbie, the world's
best-selling plastic playmate. Already, the toy maker has
unvieled several new Barbie Style products, including a line
of girl-sized costumes, bed sheets and accessories.

   Over time, Mattel has said it plans to take Barbie beyond
the toy category and into children's clothing, beauty
products and other consumer goods -- hoping that by doing so,
the company will bolster sales of the doll.
   Mattel said it is considering several proposals from movie
producers to take Barbie to the silver screen. A Mattel
spokesman said a decision on whether to make a movie hasn't
been made. One consideration the company has always had is
that a Barbie movie, which would show how the doll supposedly
sounds and acts, would impinge on each individual girl's
fantasies about the doll, the Mattel spokesman said.
   Barbie accounted for $600 million of Mattel's $1.2 billion
in total revenue for 1989.
   Los Angeles-based Price Stern Sloan, a publisher and
distributor of children's books, said it plans to introduce
the first of several lines of Barbie books in the spring of
1991.
   In addition, Price Stern said that in July, it entered
into a licensing agreement with Walt Disney Co. to produce an
electronic wand with a Mickey Mouse head and to publish six
books featuring Disney characters.

As She Fights Jem

They Adore 27-Year-Old Doll
And Her Many Costumes;
The Barbie Hall of Fame

   Barbie fetishism among adults is on the rise. 

   Each year, more women and men attend a Barbie convention, where they sell and swap Barbie hatboxes, Barbie barbecue sets and Barbie McDonald's uniforms. 
A Barbie newsletter has nearly 3,000 subscribers. 
And in Palo Alto, Calif., Evelyn Burkhalter regularly conducts tours of her Barbie Hall of Fame. 

   "People are seeing that this is no longer a doll but a representation of our history," Ms. Burkhalter says. 
Adds Peggy Bowling, an Oklahoma City fan, "A lot of women see in Barbie what they would like to be." 

   All this moral support comes at a crucial period for 27-year-old Barbie. 
The Mattel Inc. star is facing serious competition from Jem and the Holograms, a flashy doll rock band made by Hasbro Inc. Jem's creators say she has the social conscience and executive abilities that Barbie lacks. 

   To battle this upstart, Barbie, a woman of many identities and even more costumes, has formed her own rock band, the Rockers. 
In the persona of Rocker Barbie, she is belting out new-wave music and wearing metallic clothes. 
Ken, her longtime beau, isn't a member of the band, touching off speculation that Barbie has dumped him for Derek, the band's hip guitar player. 

   Jem made her debut in February and now ranks No. 16 on the Toy Hit Parade, a monthly list of the industry's top sellers. 
Barbie, who didn't even make the Top 10 last December, rebounded this year to No. 2, trailing Hasbro's long-marching G.I. Joe and edging out Tonka Corp.'s Pound Puppies. 

   Still, Jem is an increasing threat. 
"This is the first time I can ever remember a doll who's climbed up so quickly on the charts," says Thomas X. Murn, the executive editor of Toy &amp; Hobby World magazine, which publishes them. 

   Stephen Schwartz, Hasbro's senior vice president of marketing, offers an explanation for Jem's appeal. 
"Jem is a woman with a purpose. 
She's an executive," he says. 
"Barbie likes to shop. 
Barbie has no personality." 

   Hasbro is full of details about Jem's life: By day, she runs a music company, donating profits to a home for runaway girls. 
By night, with the help of battery-powered magic earrings, she turns into a rock star, dressed in a "shimmering pink lame ensemble" and backed up by the hot female trio of Shana, Kimber and Aja. 
Her boyfriend, Rio, who works as the stage manager, "provides the casual/chic image of TV's 'Miami Vice.'" 

   Jem -- and this is fact now, not fantasy -- has a cartoon show, with her own animated rock videos. 
"Kids are a lot more sophisticated today," a Hasbro spokeswoman says. 
Market research, she says, has found that children five years old and up closely follow rock videos on cable TV and are "absolutely fashion-conscious." 

   In retaliation, Mattel had planned to announce tomorrow the winner of a nationwide search for its first flesh-and-blood Barbie, a real live Rocker Barbie. 
About 500 aspiring rockers, including a seven-year-old tap dancer and a 70-year-old from Illinois, responded to ads seeking "beautiful Barbie look-alikes." 
An album, a concert tour and speaking engagements were planned. 
Alas, the company said yesterday that while the search will continue, none of the contestants so far had the true "Barbie essence." 

   Nevertheless, Rocker Barbie sales are expected to total about $75 million this holiday season, making Barbie Mattel's biggest seller. 
Mattel says Rocker Barbie was the perfect persona to bring the doll to life. 
Last year, she was a computer-literate businesswoman. 
"It was good for Barbie but pretty unexciting," says Candace Irving, a Mattel spokeswoman. 

   Ms. Irving says Barbie is "less flamboyant than Jem," and while it isn't "in her makeup to be tied to any particular cause," Barbie "would be socially responsible, if pressed." 
Ms. Irving, incidentally, denies rumors of romantic friction since Barbie's rock career took off. 
"People acted like it was as big as the Chernobyl meltdown when they thought Barbie dumped Ken," she says, but she insists that "Barbie and Derek are just good friends." 

   Hard-core Barbie fans dismiss Jem as a fad. 
"She's ugly," says Ruth Cronk of New York, the president of the International Barbie Doll Collectors Club. 
"No matter what they come out with, it won't beat Barbie. 
Even Brooke Shields couldn't make a dent." 
Mrs. Cronk's club has grown from 29 members to 3,000 in the past decade. 

   Members get a newsletter, which features patterns for Barbie clothes ("you can make Barbie look like everything from Bo-Peep to pregnant," Mrs. Cronk says), a study of Barbie's family tree and an article about Barbie's pets. 

   Fans enjoy the camaraderie. 
"I thought I was the only person past the age of 13 who appreciated Barbie," says Sibyl DeWein, of Clarksville, Tenn. 
After hooking up with other Barbie fanatics, she says, "I found out I wasn't as smart as I thought I was. 
Until 1972 I didn't even know there was a Spanish-speaking Ken." 

   Mrs. DeWein, who co-wrote a 305-page Barbie encyclopedia, says, "There's no real way to explain the Barbie mystique." 
But Prof. Robin Lakoff, a board member of the women's-studies department at the University of California at Berkeley, ventures an explanation. 

   "You have to look at the reasons why people consider Barbie a desirable feminine image," Prof. Lakoff says, "and that's a rather dangerous thing." 
Barbie, she says, implies that "the role of an ideal woman is essentially to look pretty; she encourages the superficial, the idea that clothing is all." 
The Barbie image, says the professor, is "the airhead who consumes." 

   Prof. Lakoff, who never had a Barbie, suggests a reason for adult women's attraction to the doll. 
"People like to hang on to the security of childhood," she says. 
"As a child, {Barbie} gave them an image of what it was to be a woman. 
When they grow up, they realize it's a lot harder." 

   The next Barbie convention, in June, has the theme "In Oklahoma, Every Day is Christmas with Barbie." 
Mrs. Bowling of Oklahoma City, who is the coordinator, is keeping plans secret, but past conventions included workshops on how to wash Barbie's hair and how to care for Barbie's clothes (ironing isn't recommended). 

   Mrs. Bowling says an increasing number of men attend Barbie conventions. 
One male hairdresser recently wrote of his "all-consuming passion" for Barbie in the Barbie newsletter. 
Michael McDonnell, who has concentrated on Ken collecting since 1971, also says more men are becoming interested in the dolls. 
Mr. McDonnell, an Internal Revenue Service worker from California, has searched for a particular Ken briefcase for 16 years. 
"I can't express how difficult it is to find these things," he says. 
"But I love the thrill of the hunt." 

   Good will usually flourishes among groupies, but Mrs. Bowling admits, "There are power struggles. 
A few people like to think they are the Barbie authority." 

   Mrs. Bowling, who once made herself five exact woman-sized copies of Barbie outfits (it took four months to hand-paint the fabric of one of them), says attention to detail is crucial in collecting Barbie memorabilia. 
"There are some real elusive accessories," she says. 
"There's a thermos with a lid that comes off, and Ken's pants even had a real zipper an inch long." 

   The search for such treasures evidently requires concentration. 
"You have to keep your mind functioning on it daily," Mrs. Bowling says. 
"If you don't study on a regular basis, you forget what you need." 

   The Barbie Hall of Fame, in the back of Mrs. Burkhalter's doll shop in Palo Alto, is the perfect place to study. 
Over 14,000 items sit in glass cases. 
There are black Barbies, Hispanic Barbies, Ken-A-Go-Go, who comes with wigs, and Growing Up Skipper, who races through puberty when her arms are raised. (Skipper is Barbie's younger sister.) 

   Mrs. Burkhalter dismisses a large-lipped Kissing Barbie, calling it as "homely as sin" (which is just as well, since no puckering partner was ever made). 
Also on display are a Barbie-sized Vic Damone album, a pink Barbie commode, and Barbies dressed as Marilyn Monroe, Phyllis Diller and Pat Nixon. 

   A highlight is an original 1959 Barbie, wearing a zebra bathing suit, cat-eye sunglasses and hoop earrings. 
The Hall of Fame doesn't sell its treasures, but there is a market for such items. 
First-run 1959 brunettes, in "mint, in-the-box" condition, go for up to $1,750. 

   Blondes, they say, are slightly cheaper.

   Peek into Santa's workshop today, and you glimpse the
ghosts of Christmas past.
   "Barbie dolls, Monopoly games and Lego blocks will be
piled high under the Christmas tree this year," predicts Paul
Valentine, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.'s toy analyst. "They were
big a generation ago. They are selling well today."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   They are also relatively cheap, which explains why they
are holding their own in these tough economic times. But how
many newer toys and games, including video-game
introductions, will join them under the tree is a matter of
debate. Many toy retailers report store traffic in recent
weeks is down. "The question is, will it pick up and by how
much?" wonders Stephen Sandberg, co-owner of Sanco Toys Inc.,
a toy wholesaler in Foxboro, Mass., whose orders from
retailers haven't been as heavy as in past years. He adds:
"People are saying let's see how can we just get through this
holiday season, keeping damage to a minimum."
   Consider the shopping list of Anita Eichmann, a Boston
school teacher, browsing in a suburban Child World store one
recent weekend. Ms. Eichmann, who two years ago bought a
Nintendo video-game system, this year has picked up a packet
of Roger Clemens baseball cards, a Red Baron model-biplane
kit and a Young Readers Dictionary for her nine-year-old boy.
Her six-year-old girl will get a coloring book, a Barbie doll
and a doll house.
   "Times are tough," says Ms. Eichmann. "Nobody knows which
way the economy is going. As for buying myself a present,
maybe next year."
   Judging by what's selling so far this year, other parents
have similarly modest lists that harken back to the times
when they were growing up. The Erector set, that bygone play
set made by the French firm Meccano S.A., is making a
comeback. This year, the company estimates it will sell
nearly 200,000 units in the U.S., up from "only a few
thousand" last year, reports Stephane Treppoz, vice president
of Meccano Inc., the company's U.S. unit.
   "I don't think all of a sudden in America parents want
their children to become engineers," he explains. "I think
they are looking for basic things. They want something that
will keep their child occupied for a long period of time."
   Topps Co., which claims more than one-third of the $1
billion trading-card business, projects that its
baseball-card business will grow 12% this year and 25% next
year. Another booming business is that of Lego. U.S. sales of
the Danish-made plastic building blocks will climb 25% this
year, estimates Peter Eio, president of Lego Systems Inc.,
the U.S. unit of closely held Lego Group.
   Toys with familiar names sell well in a recession, Mr. Eio
notes. "In this economic climate, retailers prefer not to
take a lot of risks," he explains.
   A newer "old" favorite, Cabbage Patch dolls, also is
selling well. The revamped doll line, acquired by Hasbro Inc.
from now defunct Coleco Industries Inc. in 1989 is expected
to ring up sales of $100 million this year. Though well below
peak sales of $600 million in 1985 at the peak of the Cabbage
Patch craze, sales should be up slightly from last year but
nearly twice that of 1989, thanks to new versions of the doll
such as Crimp and Curl, which comes with a curling iron.
   Analysts say that another new Hasbro introduction, Yo-Yo,
a furry kitten that rolls on wheels, is also selling well and
could hit $50 million in sales this year.
   Another doll on the best-selling charts is Tyco Toys
Inc.'s new Little Mermaid, fashioned after the Disney
character. Projected sales of the toy are $50 million this
year.
   Mattel Inc. should do a tidy $50 million with its Li'l
Miss Singing Mermaid doll and another $50 million from its
Magic Nursery doll, now in its second year. Meanwhile,
Mattel's 32-year-old Barbie remains the reigning queen of the
toy industry. This year, sales of Barbie dolls, clothing,
toiletries and playhouses are expected to reach $800 million,
an 8% increase over last year.
   Other hits include: Hasbro's Nerf Bow and Arrow; Playmate
Toys Ltd.'s Water Babies, which feel like real babies when
filled with warm water; Tyco's Magic Copier, which makes a
copy of pictures drawn on an erasable screen; and Cosie Coop,
a toy car for preschoolers by Rubbermaid Inc.'s Little Tikes
unit.
   Also on the "what's hot" list of Toy Book, an industry
publication, to be published next month is Uno, the card game
by International Games Inc., and model kits by Revell Inc.
   For boys, Playmate Toys' Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,
though past their prime, will claim better than 50% of the $1
billion retail "action figure" market in the U.S. A new entry
in the action-figure category that looks promising for boys,
retailers say, is Mattel's Hook, a line based on a bunch of
Peter Pan characters from Steven Spielberg's "Hook," to be
released next month. Because of the Hook line's late
introduction, however, it is difficult to estimate holiday
sales, a Mattel spokeswoman says.
   Many of the traditional and less-expensive toys are being
helped by the fact that video games have cooled off somewhat.
   Nintendo Co.'s new Super Nintendo system, more powerful
than its original game player, hasn't taken the market by
storm, retailers say. In part that is because, at $200, the
system is pricey at a time when lots of families are pinching
pennies and because rival Sega Enterprises Ltd.'s advanced
Genesis video game, had an 18-month head start in the market.
   "I think there's broad agreement that Super Nintendo is
underperforming and Genesis is overperforming, though it
doesn't sound a death knell for Nintendo," says John Taylor,
toy analyst for L.H. Alton &amp; Co.
   Sega expects to sell 1.6 million Genesis systems this
year, below Nintendo's anticipated sales but better than
expected. Nintendo says it plans to ship 2.5 million Super
Nintendo systems this year and is confident consumers will
buy up at least 2.2 million systems by Christmas. "We're
happy with our current rates of sales," a company spokesman
says.
   Surprisingly though, as sales of Nintendo's older and
less-powerful system is losing zip, a device made by Lewis
Galoob Toys Inc. that simplifies Nintendo games is having a
sales surge. The $50 gadget, Game Genie, was kept off the
market until this fall by legal challenges from Nintendo.
Galoob expects to ship one million units into stores by
Christmas.
   Many of the toys introduced with great fanfare last
February at Toy Fair, the industry's new-product show, have
flopped. Among the disappointments: Mattel's Attack of the
Killer Tomatoes, a line of bug-eyed creatures based on the
Fox Children's Network show; Hasbro's Bucky O'Hare, an
intergalactic rabbit; and Galoob's Harry and the Hendersons
action figures, based on TV characters. While "Robin Hood,"
the movie, was a hit with some parents, Robin Hood toys based
on the movie and made by Hasbro's Tonka unit weren't. The toy
characters "just did OK," says Mr. Taylor of L.H. Alton. The
release of the Robin Hood home video may not help, either.
Rentals and video sales of "Robin Hood" haven't been brisk,
says a spokesman for Fairfield Research, which follows the
home-video business.
   Other licensed toys have done modestly at best, including
Playmate's Garfield the Cat. Playmate is also shipping
Tailspin, based on a Disney cartoon character, to stores but
isn't sure how much to produce.
   Galoob's Suzy Snapshot, a doll that moved to the flash of
a camera, was a flash in pan in the U.S., though overseas
sales aren't bad, analysts say. Sales of Playmate's Toxic
Crusaders, another TV-show-based line of action figures, have
been disappointing, despite some speculation that the toy
could be the next Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. As a result,
the line will be dumped next year.
   "With a few exceptions, I'm reading the market as soft,"
says Richard Sallis, Playmate's senior vice president. "Toys
are not as recession-proof as some people thought they were.
Retailers will be looking for ways to bring consumers into
the stores this Christmas."

   ``Christmas was on its way, lovely, glorious,
beautiful Christmas, around which the entire kid year revolved.''
   That was how humorist Jean Shepherd summed up the holiday season
in the 1983 film ``A Christmas Story,'' the tale of a little boy's
quest for the Christmas present of his dreams, an air rifle.
   And so it is for millions of children - Christmas is the high
point of their year. But this Christmas is a difficult one for many
of their parents, who are concerned about the economy and the
Middle East and have less money to spend on toys.
   Consumers are in a quandry, caught between financial restraints
and wanting to fulfill their children's Christmas wishes.
   Toy retailers and manufacturers already have felt the pinch.
Toys R Us Inc., the nation's biggest toy retailer, suffered a slump
in sales after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August that mirrored
the drop-off in business throughout the retail industry.
   Robert Nakasone, a Toys R Us vice chairman, acknowledged that
these are uncertain times, but he expected a merry Christmas
nonetheless.
   ``People may cut back for durables ... but when it comes down to
your kid at Christmas, it's pretty hard to say no to them,'' he
said.
   Even in relatively poor economic years, he said, Toys R Us has
had some of its best holiday seasons. In 1982, in the midst of the
country's last recession, toy sales for the entire industry rose 13
percent.
   But some industry analysts were not as sanguine. Daniel Barry,
of Kidder Peabody &amp; Co., said toy sales could slip along with other
merchandise sales this season.
   Retailers and manufacturers are concerned because even one less
toy under a Christmas tree, when multiplied by the more than 60
million children age 16 and under in the country, can make for a
poor Christmas season.
   Perhaps the most sensitive area is video games, which again are
on many wish lists this Christmas.
   Retailers and video game manufacturers face several unknowns.
Given the uncertain business environment, no one is sure how many
parents are willing to invest big on Nintendo and other more
expensive video systems.
   The biggest question is whether the new systems, which offer
more advanced technology and more sophisticated graphics and sound
effects than Nintendo, can take market share from the industry
leader.
   Children who have tired of Nintendo games - or whose Nintendo
systems have worn out - are asking for the new units, known as
16-bit systems. A bit is the smallest unit of information in a
computer, and 16-bit systems can process more information and
instructions than eight-bit systems like Nintendo.
   The 16-bit systems, which include NEC Corp.'s TurboGrafx-16 and
Sega's Genesis, must overcome a big obstacle - their price.
   The basic Genesis unit has a list price of $189.95, while the
basic TurboGrafx-16 goes for $159. Those prices don't include game
cartridges, which can run $50 or more apiece.
   In comparison, Nintendo looks like a bargain. Its basic unit can
be found for under $100 in many stores, and many of its cartridges
sell at a discount because there is a glut of them on the market.
   Nintendo's hand-held model, Game Boy, also has a price edge over
its new competitor, NEC's TurboExpress. Game Boy has a list price
of $100 while TurboExpress lists for $249.
   It all comes down to how much parents want to indulge their
children and how much they can and want to spend.
   Manufacturers say they already are feeling the effects of a
cautious consumer.
   ``In a normal year, retailers in October would purchase enough
to take them all the way through Christmas,'' said Ken Wirt, NEC's
vice president for home entertainment.
   But this year, he said, storeowners so far have ordered enough
merchandise to last them only through the Thanksgiving weekend.
   Paul Valentine, an analyst with Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., said
manufacturers of traditional toys, such as dolls and action
figures, have had similar experiences.
   ``The turmoil in the retail industry has definitely had an
impact on the toy industry,'' he said.
   But some traditional toys are expected to be sure winners this
season, analysts say.
   Children's love affair with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is
continuing, so the Playmates Toys Inc. action figures and their
spinoffs, which include videos, books, clothes, watches and games,
should do well.
   The Simpsons are expected to be found in varying forms under
plenty of Christmas trees. Manufacturers have licenses from the
producers of the popular television series for a range of
merchandise including dolls and plastic figures.
   Dolls based on the rock group New Kids on the Block have been
selling well ever since their introduction earlier this year by
Hasbro Inc., and they're expected to be a hit again at Christmas.
   Barbie, Mattel Inc.'s long-reigning queen of toys, continues to
dominate the doll business, with new outfits, a swimming pool and
her own Corvette among the offerings.
   Meanwhile, there's been an explosion of baby and toddler dolls
as that segment continues to thrive. A parent shopping in a
well-stocked toy department or store may dozens of dolls to choose
from, with most ranging from $20 to about $60.
   There are dolls that drink, wet their diapers, fall down, cry,
shiver or take baths, and dolls that can be dressed up, made up or
have their hair dyed. The toy companies have tried to outdo one
another in making their dolls stand out. Hasbro created Baby Uh-Oh,
which soils its diapers after it has been fed. The idea turns some
adults off, but little girls love it and the dolls have been
selling well, according to Valentine.
   Another toymaker, Ideal, has aimed straight for mothers'
heartstrings by bringing back some of the most popular dolls from
30 years ago: Betsy Wetsy, one of the drink-and-wet dolls of the
early 1960s, and Tiny Tears, who weeps having her bottle.
   Besides video games and Ninja Turtles and other action figures,
boys are expected to receive toys based on Hulk Hogan and other
wrestling stars. Standard &amp; Poor's Valentine said Tonka Inc.'s
Wrestling Buddies and Hasbro's World Wrestling Federation figures
have sold well.

   Baby dolls that dirty their diapers and a
30-something Barbie show toymakers aren't taking many chances this
year with costly creations that must compete with video games in a
notoriously fickle industry.
   Analysts and executives say the multibillion dollar business is
largely sticking with the tried and true while supplementing
lineups with new additions that have built-in insurance, because
they are based on film characters, entertainers or existing toys
with proven popularity.
   ``There are people in the industry who are saying that
creativity is going down,'' says Gerald V. Cleary, president of the
Tonka products division of Tonka Corp. ``To some degree there may
be some truth to that. I think the reason for it is the risk
associated with product launches.''
   The old classics and newcomers will be competing for attention
when the toy industry hosts its annual bash beginning Monday. The
10-day extravaganza draws buyers worldwide who hope to spot the
next big craze _ or at least the probable sellers.
   Familiar faces in the form of Barbie, G.I. Joe plus other widely
known dolls and action figures will get prominent billing.
Old-timers Life and Monopoly will share the game spotlight with
newer entries, such as one that made a splash last year, Shark
Attack.
   Hype ranging from a Fifth Avene parade of Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles to appearances by real-life superstars are some of the
weapons toymakers are using to outdo each other in generating
publicity.
   Despite the high jinks and hyperbole, industry analysts predict
a ho-hum year in toyland.
   Sales in the $13 billion industry _ excluding the wildly
successful video game segment _ rose about 5 percent in 1989, says
the Toy Manufacturers of America Inc., sponsor of the 87th Annual
American International Toy Fair. The trade group will release
official figures the first day of the show, which features more
than 1,100 exhibitors.
   ``I think 1990 will continue the trend that began in 1987 of
conservatism,'' said Gary M. Jacobson, a toy analyst at Kidder
Peabody &amp; Co. ``I think industry revenues will be up modestly in
1990. I look to 1991 and the decline of video to free up some
dollars for traditional toys.''
   Nintendo still reigns among systems that turn televisions into
game screens. But a more sophisticated and expensive machine,
Genesis from rival Sega, did well over the holidays, indicating the
market hasn't peaked.
   New software titles will be introduced aimed at keeping the
video game business booming. Sega provided previews of one starring
Michael Jackson that inserts slick dance moves into a game plot.
   Analyst Paul Valentine of Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. says themes of
recent years will be repeated and embellished. Miniatures, dolls,
stuffed animals, and video-game accessories are categories of
concentration. Toys for preschoolers _ too young for Nintendo _
will be emphasized.
   Dolls will proliferate. They'll range from high-tech babies who
eat and cry to Hasbro Inc.'s Baby Uh-Oh, who wets herself after a
bottle-feeding and even suffers simulated diaper rash.
   High-fashion model dolls resemble the real thing. Matchbox Toys'
bevy of Christie Brinkley, Cheryl Tiegs and Beverly Johnson dolls
may put a few worry wrinkles in 31-year-old Barbie's brow.
   A strong 1990 contender could be Tyco Toys Inc.'s $45 My Pretty
Ballerina, said to be capable of toe dancing, even executing an
arabesque or pirouette. Tyco's Oopsie Daisy crawled and stumbled
her way to stardom last year.
   Small has been beautiful for the balance sheets of some
manufacturers, particularly Lewis Galoob Toys Inc. which is
extending its Mico Machines line that has been racing ahead of
Mattel Inc.'s Hot Wheels and Matchbox's vehicles.
   Galoob's success with miniatures has inspired others to downsize
their toys. Hasbro, for example, has decided to offer petite
versions of its famous My Little Pony herd.
   Some toymakers are banking on licensing agreements as tickets to
financial rewards. Hasbro, the country's biggest toy company,
already announced its agreement with the pop music group New Kids
on the Block. The quintet teeny-bopper sensation is spawning dolls,
puzzles and other items.
   By going after a deal with a hot group, Hasbro showed gumption _
something the toy industry must have more of if it intends to
regain market share gobbled up by video games and other competitors
for toy dollars, analysts say.
   ``I think the traditional U.S. manufacturers are going to have
to become aggressive to make inroads against video and to stimulate
sales,'' Jacobson of Kidder Peabody says.
   Lawrence Bernstein, president of Hasbro's toy division, says the
company is pursuing a new strategy: ``We will be far more
aggressive in our approach to new products than we have been in the
past.''
   For years, toy manufacturers have been criticized for playing it
too safe while waiting for the videogame fad to fade, which in some
respects seems to be a self-perpetuating problem.
   The rising cost of creating new offerings and plugging them with
expensive TV commercials has made toymakers conservative. But
retailers, who obviously want to stock winners, typically prefer to
order toys promoted on TV.
   Nonetheless, companies willing to take risks can make a killing
if their toys catch on. Playmates Toys Inc. proved that with the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the third hottest selling toy in 1989
after Nintendo and Mattel's Barbie.
   About two dozen more turtles, new enemies and accessories will
come out in 1990 and probably will get a boost this Easter from the
film starring live actors.
   Playmates, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based Playmates Holdings
Ltd., has done so well with the turtles, which are based on a
comic, that it was able to land what is expected to be a lucrative
license. It won the rights to action figures based on the Dick
Tracy movie from Walt Disney Studios starring Warren Beatty and
Madonna. The film opens June 15.
   Richard Sallis, senior vice president for Playmates, recalls
that when the idea for the turtle figures came up the company
jumped on it despite the risk of a flop.
   ``I looked at the market four years ago and felt a lot of people
weren't doing anything. They weren't taking any chances,'' he said.
``When people aren't doing anything there are a lot of
opportunities.''

RECORD SALES SEND MATTEL'S PROFIT UP 26% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Citing help from Barbie and a strong performance in foreign markets, Mattel 
Inc. reported Thursday that record sales drove its third-quarter earnings up 
26% to $47.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawthorne-based company said sales for the three months ending Sept. 29 
totaled $490 million, compared to $410 million for the same period in 1989. The 
third period is crucial to toy and game manufacturers because it marks the 
first half of retailers' Christmas buying season. 
</P>
<P>
The surge for Mattel, the No. 2 U.S. toy maker in terms of sales, came during a 
period of economic uncertainty for the industry. Wall Street analysts said 
industrywide sales this year have been relatively flat. With a 38% increase in 
foreign sales during the third quarter and a traditionally strong presence 
abroad, Mattel would be buoyed during a further slowdown in the U.S. economy, 
said Gary Jacobson, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Domestically, the toy industry is facing very sluggish demand," Jacobson said. 
"On the international front, business is booming, and Mattel is being helped by 
the weaker (value) of the U.S. dollar in world markets." 
</P>
<P>
The weaker dollar makes Mattel products less expensive and more competitive 
abroad, but many buyers in the United States and Europe are also lured by some 
of the toy maker's newer products, said John W. Amerman, Mattel's chairman and 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Among the sales leaders are Magic Nursery dolls. The large toy is packaged in a 
hospital gown that dissolves in water, leaving underlying clothing and a card 
bearing information on the doll's sex. The Disney Preschool line of toys, 
introduced in 1988, also is enjoying strong sales, Amerman said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Barbie -- introduced 31 years ago -- is still the biggest financial 
boon to Mattel. A 30% increase in foreign sales of Barbie dolls helped boost 
the foreign portion of sales to 55%, Amerman said. Typically, about 50% of 
Mattel's business stems from foreign sales. 
</P>
<P>
"This shows that we're gaining market share around the world," Amerman said. 
"Our competitors are having more difficulty. . . .Our products are well-suited 
for international consumers." 
</P>
<P>
Barbie sales, which account for about 45% of all of Mattel's annual business, 
are surging because other toy makers are concentrating more of their resources 
on toys and games for boys, said Carol Palmer, an analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps 
in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been less competition in girls' lines," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer said Mattel has outperformed industry expectations. She said it is now 
gaining on Hasbro, the No. 1 U.S. toy maker. Hasbro reported an earnings 
increase of 6% in the third quarter, but its sales have not been rising as 
rapidly as Mattel's.

   Marketing:
   As Toy Makers Unwrap New Products,
   They Hope Video Games Are Peaking

   This year, toy makers say, the video-game craze may
finally peak so that toys can rebound from several years of
flat sales.
   Okay, so they said the same thing last year. But in 1991
their wishes may come true. Video-game sales growth slowed a
bit last year, and price-cutting of some video-game software
indicates interest in electronic games may be waning.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So it is with high hopes -- but a healthy dose of caution
-- that toy makers will give more than 10,000 toy buyers a
peek into their bags of new toys at the American
International Toy Fair that begins today in New York.
   There will be lots to see: dolls that dance at the flash
of a camera; Toxic Crusaders, one of many toys that seek to
cash in on the environmental movement; a play photo copier
that reproduces texts and, presumably, other children's
homework; an electronic easel that can be hooked to the
television to make home-made cartoons out of kids' drawings;
and a parade of other toys, including Miss America Pageant
dolls that the reigning Miss America will personally promote
at the show.
   But the 10-day gala glimpse of toys to come -- embellished
with sales spiels, previews of TV commercials and spiffy show
girls -- will offer few clues to whether the industry can
break out after four years of flat sales.
   The Toy Manufacturers Association is expected to announce
today that U.S. toy makers had sales last year of about $8.8
billion, the same as in 1989, while sales of video-game
makers, led by Nintendo Ltd., jumped 24% to $3.1 billion. The
video-game increase wasn't as steep as in previous years, but
this year Nintendo plans to unveil its new generation system,
which has twice the microchip power. Thus, many toy makers
are playing it safe.
   "If you talk to vendors in the Orient," says Jerry Cleary,
president of Tonka Corp.'s products division, "they'll tell
you there's a lot of capacity at the factories right now;
orders are down."
   Adds toy inventor and consultant Bernie Loomis, "At the
moment, the toy industry is in a very conservative stance.
You'll see a lot of extensions of existing lines. Many
manufacturers are struggling and have limited funds."
   Indeed, two toy makers have put themselves up for sale --
Tonka, which recently agreed to be acquired by Hasbro Inc.,
and Lewis Galoob Toys Inc. And Child World Inc., one of the
nation's largest toy retailers, is in financial trouble and
hasn't been able to pay many toy makers for past shipments.
Other retailers are also having problems paying their bills,
shrinking toy makers' profits and potential sales. Tyco Toys
Inc., for example, "expects to lose 5% to 6% of its
{retailer} customer base," says Richard Grey, Tyco president.
"If we sold 500,000 units last year, we'll do 475,000 this
year. Growth will come from abroad."
   Showing their conservative colors, toy makers this year
will introduce toys linked to movies and popular TV shows.
Playmates Toys Inc., which built a fortune on the biggest
risk in recent times, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, will
bring out toys based on the hit TV cartoon "Tailspin" and
Garfield the Cat.
   "It's safe," explains Richard Sallis, vice president of
Playmates. "Rather than starting something from scratch,
you've got instant popularity." Royalties for licenses
usually range from 5% to 10% of sales -- making royalties
cheaper in most cases than, say, promoting a new line of toys
with a season's worth of cartoons.
   Hence from Mattel Inc. comes "Attack of the Killer
Tomatoes," a line of ambulatory bug-eyed creatures based on
the Fox Children's Network show; from Hasbro comes Bucky
O'Hare, an intergalactic time hopping rabbit; and from Galoob
come action figures based on "Harry and the Hendersons."
   Also expect Steven Spielberg's "Hook," due out in
December, to spawn a line of Peter Pan action figures by
Mattel. Meanwhile, Tonka's Kenner unit will offer a merry
line of Robin Hood toys that look like characters in "Robin
Hood," a summer release starring Kevin Costner.
   Toy makers are also seeking shelter in preschool toys, a
market segment that is unscathed by the video-game craze and
has benefited from a population miniboom. Children should be
cleaner this year: A flotilla of toys are for bathtub play,
including Murduck, a bathrobe-clad, battery-operated,
wise-cracking talking duck from Video Technology. It spouts
lines like "you quack me up," and "egg scuz me."
   Toys for small children don't always have tiny price tags.
Little Tykes' Castle, a backyard structure with drawbridges
and chutes children can slide through, will sell for $100.
"Many times grandparents will ask the parent what to get for
little Johnny, and the parent will suggest some of these
toys," says Kimberly Chapman, a spokeswoman for the
Rubbermaid Inc. unit. "For many of them I don't think money
is an issue."
   Indeed, despite the recession, toy makers aren't shying
away from expensive toys. Tyco's radio-controlled Jetstream,
a model airplane whose twin engines are powerful enough for a
takeoff from the ground, will retail for about $200,
including a rechargeable battery pack.
   Carrying a similar sticker price is Video Technology's
Advantage Computer, a real computer that the company says
will be child friendly. Also from Video Technology comes
Video Painter, an electronic sketch pad on which children can
draw their favorite characters. Hook it up to the TV and
watch airplanes, hot-air balloons, monsters, submarines and
people become animated. It will sell for $99.
   Toy makers are also betting big on the environment, with
more than 60 playthings. XTC Products Inc. will launch
Hugg-A-Planet, a stuffed globe. University Games Corp. is
offering a Captain Planet board game, in which rain forests
carry Park Place value. The game is "totally recyclable.
We're using wooden dice," says President Robert Moog.
   Though "in," the environment can turn children off if they
sense the games are disguised classrooms. To avoid that,
Playmates Toys will offer a line of characters named Toxic
Crusaders, based on a new TV show and starring Toxie, a
former health-care executive whose name was Melvin until he
got tossed into a vat of toxins. Humiliated, this nerd turns
chief crusader against Dr. Killemoff, who as leader of the
Pollutant Mutants is out to poison the world. Toxie has an
assistant, Nozone, an acrobatic pilot, who was disfigured
when he accidentally flew through a hole in the ozone. "We
don't want to preach," says Richard Sallis, vice president of
Playmates.
   Another fad: adult board games. In the early 1980s, only
5% of board games on the market were for adults; today nearly
20% of the $1.2 billion business is aimed at adults, says Mr.
Moog. Still, it's hard to come up with a winner, says Steve
Peek, director of Game Inventors of America. Two years ago,
nearly 100 board game businesses were started up. "Today I'd
be surprised if two are still in business," Mr. Peek says.
   George Chanos of San Diego knows the routine well. Two
years ago he left a $100,000 a year job as a lawyer to make
Notable Quotables. "He discovered nobody cared what
Shakespeare said," says Mr. Peek, his printer. So he turned
to People magazine, U.S.A. Today and the National Enquirer
for lines. The new Notable Quotables is more promising. For
instance, players must guess who said, "I think I'm the best
reporter on television." (The answer: Geraldo Rivera.)
   The National Enquirer itself will be the name of a new
game from Tyco. Players draw phrases out of a box and piece
together wacky National Enquirer-style headlines.
   Perhaps the biggest challenge of the year faces Kenner's
Miss America Pageant dolls, which are targeting the market
dominated by Mattel's Barbie, the 33-year-old queen of
fashion dolls. Hasbro has already tried -- and failed --
twice with Jem and Maxie. Last year, Matchbox Toys Ltd.
offered Christie Brinkley, Cheryl Tiegs and Beverly Johnson
dolls. The tally at the end of 1990: Barbie, $740 million in
sales; Matchbox's three dolls, $2 million.

"Absolutely no one under the age of 18 will be admitted to the Toy Fair," warn
the materials supplied to visitors.;    The toy industry is having its
troubles. Christmas was sluggish for most toy makers and retailers, and
disastrous for some. Child World, the second-largest toy retailer after Toys
"R" Us, said last week it was close to finding a buyer for the company.;   
Last week, Tonka Corp., the nation's third-largest toy maker, agreed to be
acquired for $516 million by Hasbro Inc., a deal that would make Hasbro the
world's largest toy company.;    For the fall, Mattel Inc. is coming out with
Shani, a black doll with a Barbie-like fondness for fashion, albeit
African-influenced. Shani means marvelous in Swahili, Mattel says.;   
Inexpensive is also a byword at this year's recession-conscious Toy Fair, as
companies try to introduce toys that are smaller and usually sell for less
than $15.;    Mattel has a whole line of toys smaller than a youngster's hand
and built around the cult film, "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes," in which
crazed fruit wreak havoc on San Diego.;    Hasbro is also introducing Tell Me
Tots, tiny talking dolls less than 5 inches tall that use microchip
technology.;    "Toy Fair is an opportunity for Charles Lazarus to say,
'Here's what we will take and here's what we won't,' " said Sean P. McGowan, a
toy industry analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison &amp; Co., referring to the
chairman of Toys "R" Us.;    Children and parents, speaking through the sales
rung up on computerized inventory systems, will make the real decisions for
toy retailers later in the year.;    "The smart buyers will get a little bit
of this and a little bit of that," McGowan said, "and then let their checkout
scanners determine what they'll buy a lot of.";    Hasbro's Milton Bradley
subsidiary is introducing Splat!, The Bug Squishin' Race Game, in which
hapless arachnids are dispatched with glee.;    Judging by past Toy Fairs,
these annual get-togethers are not particularly accurate indicators of what
will be the hot toys and which toy companies will come out ahead.;    Neither
Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles nor Slap Wraps, the wraparound bracelets, were
products from major exhibitors, yet both were sensations in 1990.;    And the

FT  28 AUG 93 / International Company News: Mattel challenges for top toy
spot - Karen Zagor on benefits of the US group's merger with Fisher-Price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE merger with Fisher-Price will transform Mattel, the number two US
toy-maker, into a worthy rival to industry leader Hasbro, swelling Mattel's
market share from 11 per cent to 15 per cent, just short of Hasbro's 16 per
cent share.
The next biggest company is Tyco, accounting for 5 per cent of the market,
according to Mr Gary Jacobson, analyst at Kidder Peabody. 'I think we will
continue to see smaller acquisitions,' says Mr Jacobson, 'but there is
nothing left of this magnitude.' Tyco, which posted losses for the first
half of this year, is considered too troubled to be attractive to Mattel or
Hasbro.
Mattel, once an unstable performer in an industry noted for its volatility,
has posted steady gains in sales and earnings since 1990. The company owes
much of its strength to the success of core brands, notably the Barbie doll,
Mattel's 34-year old fashion doll which last year accounted for around 50
per cent of sales.
The company, which last posted a loss of Dollars 113.2m in 1987, has found
stability by discarding non-toy assets, cutting overheads and personnel and
focusing on core products at the expense of more faddish toys. Last year, it
earned Dollars 143.8m, up from Dollars 117.2m in 1991 and Dollars 95.5m
1990. But some analysts say Mattel is too reliant on the Barbie doll.
The Fisher-Price deal will ease some of these concerns, reducing Barbie's
share of sales to just under 39 per cent for the combined company with
Fisher-Price contributing an additional 30 per cent of sales. Mattel's other
mainstay lines - Disney-based pre-school toys and the Hot Wheels car line -
will account for 10 per cent and 5 per cent of company sales respectively.
Fisher-Price, which is the dominant player in the infant and pre-school end
of the business, will help bolster Mattel's toy lines in this area. This is
particularly important because Mattel's Disney infant/preschool line has
been one of its weaker areas.
Mattel hopes to broaden Fisher-Price's overseas sales with the help of its
own distribution channels - about half of Mattel's sales are outside the US,
compared with 25 per cent for Fisher-Price.
'We also see opportunities with regards to manufacturing facilities,' says
Mattel. 'We have looked at two Fisher-Price plants in the US and think we
can put some Mattel products, currently produced by vendors, into these
plants.'
Fisher-Price, with a product range including Chatter Telephone, Play Desk
and a wide range of playsets, has been seen as a likely takeover candidate
since 1991, when it was spun off from Quaker Oats.
It earned Dollars 41.3m last year, up from Dollars 14.6m in 1991, but some
toy analysts have long felt that Fisher-Price needed big player muscle to
remain wholly competitive. Mattel, which had approached Fisher-Price at the
time of the spin-off, was the obvious suitor.
'The deal makes sense for both parties,' says Mr Harold Vogel, of Merrill
Lynch. 'Mattel had a need for it and Fisher-Price seemed to have difficulty
competing in a long-term sense against the big toy manufacturers. This gives
Mattel a little bit more balance. Whether it actually accelerates earnings
growth is another story.'
Balance is less of a concern for Hasbro, the world's biggest toy company.
Hasbro's greatest strength is the diversity of its products: it made 1992
profits of Dollars 179.2m compared with underlying earnings of Dollars
122.7m the previous year, excluding restructuring charges related an
acquisition. Products range from a strong preschool Playskool line, GI Joe
action doll for boys and board games, including Monopoly and Trivial
Pursuit.
A bigger Mattel will put pressure on Hasbro to retain its number one spot in
the toy industry, but there is still ample room for both companies to grow.
The combined domestic market share for Mattel and Hasbro is about 30 per
cent, 'leaving a tremendous room for growth', says Mr Jacobson.
Hasbro may even benefit from a more equal rival in Mattel. Stronger Mattel
toys will draw more customers into toy stores and get more products on to
shelves. And increased profits stability will allow Mattel to take greater
risks with its products.
If Mattel and Hasbro continue to grow, they may be more threatening to the
smaller companies than to each other. 'It's going to be more difficult for
small players to survive,' warns Mr Jacobson. 'But there will be niche
categories because, as Mattel and Hasbro get bigger, they will not pay
attention to the smaller niches.'
Moody's Investors Service has placed Mattel's debt ratings under review for
possible upgrade, citing acceleration in Mattel's progress 'in diversifying
its product array from Barbie toys'. Moody's expects the merger to enhance
earnings predictability without increasing debt.

   Hasbro Inc., citing cautious ordering by retailers and the
close-out of a major toy line, said it expects to report an
earnings skid of more than 50% for the second quarter, on a
10% drop in revenue.
   The gloomy forecast by Hasbro, the nation's leading toy
maker, underscores the general sluggishness in the toy
industry. The continued popularity of video games and growing
sales of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, made by Playmates Toys
Inc., have especially hurt companies that make toys for boys.
And only a couple of major companies that make girls' toys,
Mattel Inc. and Tyco Toys Inc., are expected to post healthy
sales gains.

   Also, some hot-selling toys have cooled, and retailers
aren't as keen on toys linked to new movies, says Eugene
Gilligan, editor of Playthings, a trade magazine.
   The share earnings drop predicted by Hasbro were
especially surprising because analysts had been expecting
flat earnings on a sales increase of perhaps 3%.
   Hasbro Chairman Alan G. Hassenfeld said net income
declined to 12 cents to 14 cents a share in the quarter from
$18.2 million, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
fell to about $270 million from $301.4 million. The second
half "looks more hopeful," he said, although he still expects
Hasbro's 1990 earnings to equal last year's $92.2 million, or
$1.56 a share. Revenue will be "flat or increase modestly,"
compared with $1.41 billion in 1989.
   Hasbro, based in Pawtucket, R.I., noticed a conservative
trend in orders beginning in April, with retailers apparently
concerned about stocking too many new and unproven products.
Mr. Hassenfeld also noted that some troubled retailers have
cut back on orders. Ames Department Stores Inc., which filed
for bankruptcy protection in April, purchased about $35
million worth of toys last year from Hasbro. This year,
orders from Ames will be to $2 million to $2.5 million. "It
isn't easy to replace $35 million in revenue just like that,"
Mr. Hassenfeld said.
   Contributing to Hasbro's woes are the weakening sales of
two mainstays, G.I. Joe and Transformers. Sales of both have
been hurt by the hot-selling Ninja Turtles: Playmate
officials expect Turtles sales this year to double from last
year's $100 million level. Another disappointment for Hasbro
has been Record Breakers, a line of race cars, which is being
discontinued.
   The company said business is down in its Playskool, Milton
Bradley and Hasbro Toys divisions, but that has been offset
in part by double-digit sales increases in its international
division.
   On a more optimistic note, Hasbro said two toy lines
introduced in limited quantities this summer are selling
well, World Wrestling Federation figures of professional
wrestlers and Baby Uh-Oh, a doll that dirties its diapers.
Cabbage Patch dolls, purchased by Hasbro last year from
Coleco Industries Inc., are also doing a brisk business. And
the company has high hopes for its long-anticipated New Kids
on the Block dolls, fashioned after members of the popular
rock band.
   Things aren't much cheerier for other toy makers. Lewis
Galoob Toys Inc., South San Francisco, Calif., has sputtered
because of slowing sales of Micro Machines, its line of
mini-cars, and other items.
   John Taylor, analyst for L.H. Alton &amp; Co., anticipates
Galoob will report a second-quarter loss of about 50 cents a
share on sales of $35 million to $45 million. That compares
to a profit of 45 cents a share on $56.1 million in sales a
year earlier.
   Mr. Taylor, who had expected Galoob to post a profit of 13
cents a share for the quarter, revised his projection when
told of the growing inventory of Micro Machines in toy
stores. Micro Machines last year accounted for about 70% of
Galoob's sales.
   Tonka Corp., Minnetonka, Minn., could report a quarterly
loss of 25 cents to 50 cents a share, predicts Robin Young,
an analyst at John G. Kinnard &amp; Co., vs. a profit of one cent
a share a year ago. Mr. Young thinks Tonka's sales will fall
16% to about $160 million from $189 million.
   The decline has come amid Tonka's inability to come up
with hot new toys to replace fading hits like Ghostbusters.
Tonka's total orders as of June 3 had declined 11.6% to $657
million from $743 million a year earlier. Excluding orders
for Sega video games, which the company has stopped
distributing, orders have fallen 7.4% to $651 million from
$703 million.
   Two toy firms which expect to post healthy gains for the
quarter make girls' toys, which skirt direct competition with
video games and the Turtles.
   Mattel, the Hawthorne, Calif.-based maker of Barbie, will
report second-quarter profit of 40 cents a share, up from 33
cents a year earlier, estimates Barry Rothberg, analyst for
Mabon Nugent &amp; Co. Sales are expected to rise about 20% to
$325 million from $272.3 million, largely because of Barbie's
continued success.
   Tyco Toys, Mt. Laurel, N.J., also is gaining sales on the
popularity of three dolls, Oopsie Daisy, My Pretty Ballerina
and Quints. Sales are expected to jump nearly 40% to about
$100 million from $71.7 million in the 1989 second quarter.
   But analysts expect Tyco's profits to only equal the 48
cents it posted in last year's second quarter because its
63%-owned Nasta International Inc. unit has forecast a loss
for the year.
   Among toy retailers, Toys "R" Us Inc., is the exception.
While many discounters and toy chains have held back on new
orders, Toys "R" Us "hasn't been bashful about building
inventory," notes Dorothy Lakner, analyst for Deutsche Bank
Capital. Ms. Lakner estimates that Toys "R" Us second-quarter
earnings will increase 25% to 10 cents a share from eight
cents a share a year ago, restated for a stock split, on a
sales gain of about 22%.

Barbie Left a New Doll in the Dust

   Things are tough all over. 
The stock market is crashing. 
The Democrats are running out of candidates. 
And Jem is losing her one-year-old fight with Barbie. 

   Let us explain. 

   Jem is actually a doll, introduced by Hasbro Inc. last year to challenge Mattel Inc.'s Barbie. 
And for a while, the 27-year-old champion was showing her age. 

   If Barbie was the All-American teenager, Jem -- according to the "story line" that Hasbro gave her -- was a woman of the '80s. 
By day she was an executive, running a music store. 
At night, however, she became the gyrating leader of a rock band. 
Moreover, she had what every young toy dreams of: her own TV cartoon show. 

   But Barbie, who has been through a few changes herself, wasn't about to give way to the competition. 
The veteran quickly acquired an after-hours wardrobe of miniskirts and spandex tights, a spiked hair-do, a rock band of her own and a new boyfriend: her drummer Derek. (Faithful Ken was temporarily dumped.) 

   Mattel's counterattack worked. 
"Suddenly the customers had the option of choosing between a rock star and a rock star and they got a little confused," says Stephen Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing for Hasbro. 
As a result, the lesser-known Jem suffered. 
Hasbro admits it made a few mistakes with the doll. 
For one, Jem was on the homely side, a problem that plastic surgery has since corrected. 

   This year Barbie's sales will top $200 million, vs. only a few million dollars for Jem, estimates Rick Anguilla, editor of Toy and Hobby World, a trade magazine. 
Barbie ranks as the nation's second best-selling toy (behind Hasbro's G.I. Joe), while Jem -- who never got higher than No. 16 -- has fallen off the Top 20 list. 

   Her future "depends on how well she does this Christmas season," says Mr. Schwartz. 
"The truth is we underestimated Barbie a little bit." 

   But it may be too late. 
Harry E. Wells III, an analyst for Adams Harkness &amp; Hill Inc. in Boston, often judges the success of a toy by its reception among the friends of his daughters, all of whom are of doll-buying age. 
Mr. Wells says he never hears the girls mention Jem's name, a sure sign that "Jem's in deep trouble." 

   Meanwhile, Mattel's new "story line" has Barbie back with Ken. 
Retailers report that Ken now has a thicker neck and a bigger Adam's apple. 
Probably from working out.

<HL> A Look at Hasbro's 'Moondreamer' Dolls
Shows Creating a Toy Isn't Child's Play

   It's a tough audience for a little kid. 

   Forty business people are staring at her. 
With pads out and pens poised, they are about to give their verdict on whether the $2 million her backers have lavished on her was worth it. 

   The object of their attention is Crystal Starr, a 5 1/2-inch doll that Hasbro Inc. introduced to analysts and toy-store executives here last week. 
While many parents have only just finished searching for this year's Christmas presents for their children, toy makers are starting to unveil next year's toys. 
A few will be wildly successful -- but far more will fail. 

   "Commercial toy companies might introduce a total of about 40 lines a year," says Henry Orenstein, the owner of Toy Builders, which develops toy ideas and advises toy makers. 
"Out of those, maybe three or four will be mega-hits," with retail sales of $100 million a year, he says. 
"At least 25% of the rest will be flops." 

   Crystal Starr is the central character in a line of dolls called "Moondreamers," which Hasbro has spent two years developing. 
As a look at Moondreamers shows, creating a new toy isn't child's play. 
It has become a lengthy and expensive process as toy companies sift through countless ideas -- Hasbro gets 4,000 a year -- refine the best, shave pennies off production costs and cater to the interests of retailers. 

   In the end, however, the $12 billion-a-year industry is at the mercy of a largely unmeasurable commodity: children's fancies. 

   "If you screw up once -- if the (toy line's) characters aren't exciting or the story line isn't -- the child won't come back for more," warns Bernard Loomis, president of G.L.A.D., a New-York based design and development company. 

   The idea for Moondreamers came from a Vermont illustrator in April 1984. 
The illustrator suggested a cast of characters called "Moon Beamers," who live in "Starry Up" and send dreams full of fun and adventure to children on earth. 

   A line of mini-doll characters is hardly unique. 
Kenner Parker Toys' Strawberry Shortcake and similar lines sold by rival toy companies have been around for several years. 
But Hasbro believed that the falling sales of its competitors' mini-dolls offered an opportunity to fill a niche in the category. 
Additionally, such product lines offer the opportunity for multiple sales as well as licensing rights to put the characters on other products, such as clothing and party-ware. 

   Hasbro also liked the story line. 
"We thought kids would be fascinated with the concept of dreams and where they come from," says Maurene Souza, vice president of marketing for girls' toys. 
The theme also lent itself to another selling point: TV cartoons. 
"The trade now measures a product by its ability to have a cartoon show," says Stephen Schwartz, Hasbro's senior vice president for marketing. 

   Still the Moon Beamers idea needed a lot of fine tuning. 
Enraptured by the concept of dreams, the Vermont illustrator and Hasbro immediately agreed that the characters' names should be changed to Moondreamers. 
The toy maker also decided to aim the doll at little girls; thus, all but one of the original story's male characters were changed to females. 
"You don't sell (a line of) little boys to girls," explains Roseann Radosevich, design director for dolls at Hasbro. (But Bucky Buckaroo, a space cowboy, remained male to add an element of romance.) 

   At the same time, the design team tried to develop what they considered the right look. 
Studies have shown that little girls love to play with long hair, so that was a must. 
But designing the faces was trickier. 
Ms. Radosevich considered an elfish look with pointy features but quickly discarded the idea; another mini-doll, Herself the Elf, hadn't sold well. 
She also avoided faces similar to other mini-dolls. 
"It was a matter of pride," she says. 
"We want to be a trend-setter, not an industry follower." 
She finally found her inspiration in the face of a little girl on the EWOK Adventure TV show. 

   Going from sketches to models proved difficult. 
In some cases, sculptors made the eyes too big or the ears too pointy. 
Other sculptors left too much space between the eyes, nose and mouth, making the faces look too mature. 
At the same time, problems arose with the doll's body. 
Ms. Radosevich had sketched a fairly chunky body, but she didn't like the first prototypes. 
Crystal Starr "really looked fat when we put the clothes on," she says. 
As a result, the models were slimmed down to look more like "a little kid." 
In all, the models took four months to complete. 

   For Crystal Starr's outfit, Hasbro wanted a shimmery, sheer, pink fabric with a high-tech look. 
The company sent samples to a Chinese manufacturer, but was told that the material would cost a steep $20 a yard. 
Instead, Hasbro settled for a cheaper imitation at $2.50 a yard. 
From start to finish, the costumes took eight months to complete in bulk. 

   Finally, confident it had a winner after nearly a year of development, Hasbro gave a sneak preview of the five-doll line to four top toy retailers in September 1985. 

   The retailers were unimpressed. 
"No real magic in the doll," Mr. Schwartz recalls being told. 
"We'd seen that type of thing before," says Thomas Davis of Chapman Harkey, a toy distributor in Charlotte, N.C. Ms. Radosevich was stunned. 
"I had really felt our toy was right," she says. 

   Before abandoning the project, Hasbro visited two shopping malls in New York and New Jersey and interviewed 100 little girls and their mothers to get their reactions. 
Among the results: 75% of the children rated mini-dolls as their favorite kind of doll; 96% said they would ask their mothers to buy Moondreamers; and 75% of the mothers said they would either definitely or probably buy Moondreamers. 

   Encouraged, Hasbro marketers and designers went back to the drawing board. 
They enlarged the line to nine dolls to give it more variety. 
But Moondreamers still needed something to make them stand out from other mini-dolls. 
Last December, the company decided to reexamine an idea that was considered earlier, but seemed far-fetched at the time: hair that glows in the dark, a novelty in mini-doll land. 

   Seven months of work by Hasbro's resident chemist and others gave the company the hair it wanted -- with some compromises. (Crystal Starr's pink hair looks off-white in the dark.) 
Four months ago, Hasbro gave another sneak preview of the improved Moondreamers to select retailers and received an enthusiastic reception. 
The glowing hair provided the "oooh and aaah they had missed in our other presentation," says James Swearingen, a Hasbro marketing director. 

   There are other good signs. 
Hasbro has already licensed Moondreamers for use on clothing and other products, and 30 Moondreamer cartoons are in the works. 
The major dolls will go on sale next month for $7.99 each. 

   Some retailers are still skeptical about the line since Hasbro will have competition not only from existing mini-doll lines but other new lines as well. 
Mattel Inc., for example, plans to introduce Lady Lovely Locks, which has long, silky hair. 
But Ms. Souza, Hasbro's marketing director, remains confident. 
"We're cheaper than theirs . . .," she says. 
"But until you get out there, you never know."

US toymakers are this year showing renewed determination to test the
tolerance of the more politically aware.
Girls can expect to unwrap not only the usual Barbie dolls, furry animals
and miniature teasets. They may even dip into their Christmas stockings to
find a product called Mommy's Having A Baby - a doll which gives birth to a
4 1/2 inch offspring through a Velcro opening in a maternity dress.
'Rub Mommy's soft tummy and you can actually feel the baby,' says the toy
shop catalogue. 'See baby move . . . even decide when Mommy's ready to have
baby. With birth certificate, diaper, bottle and more.'
The manufacturer, Tyco Toys, says the Mommy doll addresses children's
natural curiosity about childbirth and pregnancy in a sensitive way. But
some women have pointed out that is not only politically, but anatomically,
incorrect; a female doctor in Massachusetts has said the doll might lead
children to believe all babies are born by Velcro caesarean.
Other ideologically suspect products this year include Electronic Dream
Phone, a game in which girls dial different numbers to find out which boys
have a crush on them. 'One of 24 incredible guys really likes you. Now you
just have to find out who by calling his friends for clues,' says the blurb.
Girls can progress to another game, Perfect Wedding, in which they plan for
the big event: 'The first to complete her plans and walk down the aisle
wins.'
For boys, the stereotyping seems to consist mainly of satisfying their
perceived appetite for violent confrontation with powerful assault weapons,
like this year's top-selling Nerf Arrowstorm - blasts six soft arrows over
30ft - or the Motorized Thunderstrike - the ultimate battery-operated air
blaster.
Video games are also growing more ghastly. In one, called Night Trap,
players try to prevent a gang of hooded zombies from capturing a group of
scantily clad sorority sisters: if they fail, the killers use a syringe to
suck the women's blood from their necks. It has proved so offensive many
retailers have removed it from their shelves.
On a brighter note, not all the toys on sale are violent or obviously
sexist. Mr Ian McDermott, senior buyer at FAO Schwartz, the Manhattan toy
store, says the best-selling toy is a Dollars 6 (Pounds 4) stuffed gorilla
eating a banana.
'I don't know why, but gorillas always sell well in any shape or form.
People find them amusing, especially if they're licking a banana,' he says.
And best of all, it is of indeterminate sex.

<HEAD>New Kids on The Block `Immortalized in Plastic' as Hasbro Dolls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hasbro Inc. on Monday unveiled dolls modeled
after the five members of the New Kids on the Block in a push by
the big toy manufacturer to spur sales by capitalizing on the
popular singing group.
   The announcement of the line of dolls and accessories was made
at a news conference in Manhattan's Hard Rock Cafe, which houses
rock 'n' roll memorabilia ranging from an Elvis Presley costume to
an Eric Clapton guitar.
   Outside, hundreds of screaming fans _ mostly young girls _
crowded the sidewalk eager for a glimpse of the group that has been
spinning hits out of anti-drug and other wholesome messages.
   The teenagers started converging on the area in the early
morning after being tipped off by a local radio station that their
music idols would be appearing at the news conference, a policeman
at the scene said. He estimated that hundreds, possibly as many as
1,000, young fans were on hand.
   ``What you saw out there is the reason why we're bringing out
the line,'' said Wayne Charness, a Hasbro spokesman. ``We are
grasping on to something that girls can't seem to get enough of.''
   One girl pressed up against the police barricade flanking the
cafe entrance, Geneive Kervandjian, said she was skipping classes
at Russell Sage Junior High 190 in Queens in hopes of seeing the
Kids. Why?
   ``Because they're talented and I like what they stand for _ and
they're gorgeous!'' she chortled.
   Al Carosi, Hasbro's senior vice president of marketing, said it
was the first time the company has entered into a licensing
agreement with a major name in music to create a line of fashion
figures.
   Word of the hookup with the Kids was timed to generate advance
publicity for Hasbro ahead of the line's official debut at Toy
Fair, the industry's annual trade show that begins next Monday.
   The Hasbro line will be on store shelves by August, Carosi said.
A month later a new half-hour Saturday morning cartoon television
show based on the Kids is scheduled to begin airing. A
feature-lenth film starring the Kids will begin shooting in October.
   The centerpiece of the Hasbro line are bendable 12\-inch dolls
made to resemble the five Kids _ Jonathan Knight, his brother
Jordan, Joe McIntyre, Donnie Wahlberg and Danny Wood _ complete
with earrings, ponytails, rings and bracelets. They come dressed in
either casual street clothes or stage costumes.
   The ``street look'' dolls will sell for around $12.99. Each
concert doll, which will sell for about $15.99, carries a pretend
microphone and comes with a cassette of a taped interview in which
a group member answers questions on hot teeny-bopper topics like
dating and kissing.
   The rest of the line, sold separately, includes additional
clothes to augment the dolls' wardrobes, a stage playset including
make-believe instruments, a battery-operated microphone, puzzles
and other items.
   Lawrence Bernstein, president of the Hasbro toy division, said
the company thinks the Kids have a long time before their
popularity peaks and the line should be a lucrative addition to
Hasbro's products, including the G.I. Joe action figures and
Cabbage Patch dolls. Hasbro is the country's biggest toy company.
   The New Kids on the Block, whose members range in age from 17 to
20 and do not play instruments, was assembled in 1984 by Boston
producer Maurice Starr and started its first major tour last summer
as an opening act for former teen-queen Tiffany.
   Donnie Walhberg, who oftens acts as the group's spokesman, said
members were honored to be turned into toys by Hasbro and had no
qualms about using their pop music success in the commercial
venture.
   ``We are being immortalized in plastic,'' Wahlberg said.

   Turtles-on-Ice may sound like tempting
delicacies to adventurous food fanatics but these reptiles are
inedible.
   A band of skating, human-sized Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will
stage an ice show Sunday on a rink in New York's Central Park.
   The show featuring costumed professionals on loan from the Ice
Capades is one of the gimmicks planned for this year's Toy Fair, an
annual outpouring of hyperbole to stoke enthusiasm for new
creations and old favorites.
   Toymakers spare no expense or imagination in dreaming up
attention-grabbing stunts for the annual 10-day event in New York.
   ``This is show biz. This is a fun industry and this sets a tone
of fun, excitement and adventure,'' said Frank Reysen Jr., editor
of Playthings magazine, a trade publication.
   Publicity also is serious business for a multibillion-dollar
industry in which companies rely on the capricious tastes of
children. At the trade exhibition, manufacturers try to hook buyers
from all over the country scouting for inventory that will move off
store shelves quickly.
   Toy Fair visitors _ who must be members of the trade or media
and at least 18 years old _ typically encounter clowns, actors
dressed as cartoon characters, real movie stars, sports celebrities
and outlandish creatures.
   This year a fierce but environmentally friendly intergalactic
ninja named Zen will debut, as will a 12-foot ``BRIKasaurus Tex,''
a dinosaur replica built from BRIK Toy Co. blocks. Another company
plans to assemble the world's biggest crossword puzzle with the
help of 50 schoolchildren.
   Hasbro Inc. will have on hand the New Kids on the Block to pitch
a new doll line modeled on the singing fivesome.
   Super models Christie Brinkley, Beverly Johnson and Cheryl Tiegs
will show up to plug high-fashion dolls from Matchbox Toys (USA)
Ltd.
   Anniversaries are planned for some old-timers in toyland. Etch A
Sketch will be feted for turning 30 by Ohio Art Co. while Tonka
Corp. will pay tribute as its Mighty Tonka Truck line rumbles into
year 25.
   Barbie, who celebrated her 30th birthday last year with much
fanfare, will add a new career in 1990. At a black-tie gala Monday
night, Mattel Inc. will announce that the darling of the doll world
will become an ambassador of international goodwill.
   Mattel will outline plans to sponsor the ``Barbie Summit,''
designed to bring children together from different countries to
talk about world issues. To add drama, the company has flown to New
York a 6-year-old East German girl, Anika Polzin, who had been
photographed clutching a new Barbie on her first visit recently to
West Germany.
   The most tongue-in-cheek publicity pitch may be delivered by the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles courtesy of Playmates Toys Inc. The
figures are based on a comic about four pet turtles endowed with
human proportions after they were doused by a mutagen chemical in a
sewer. They learned Ninja ways from a martial arts master mutated
into a giant rat.
   The turtles, fighting for life, liberty and the pursuit of
pizza, their favorite food, will appear around New York. The
skating show, an Easter Seal benefit, will be followed by a Meet
the Mutants autograph session.
   Industry gimmicks concocted to beseech the press for publicity
reached new levels this year. An actor in a turtle costume peddling
free pizza was dispatched Friday to woo reporters who will be
covering Toy Fair.
   A small party of the turtles and their foes were to troop around
the streets of Manhattan on Monday. A local radio station plans to
interview Wall Street brokers for reaction to New York's first
mutant parade.
   Playmates, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based Playmates Holdings
Ltd., also is aggressively promoting its line spun off from the
upcoming Dick Tracy movie. The film, starring Warren Beatty and
Madonna, opens June 15.
   One hundred pairs of personalized handcuffs were sent to members
of the media. To get the keys, reporters must show up at the
Playmates showroom during the fair.
   About 350 reporters received ``talking'' invitations to see the
Dick Tracy stuff. Cards of walkie-talkie wrist telephones, costing
$8.50 a pop, contained sophisticated circuitry that summoned
individual reporters by name to the Playmates showroom.
   Why go to such trouble?
   ``This is really the only chance of impressing and reaching the
toy buyers about your product line,'' said Timothy Unger, a public
relations executive handling the Playmates account.
   With hundreds of exhibitors at Toy Fair, he said. ``it's very
important that you add as much pizazz as possible to your program.''

   The New Kids on the Block are doing
almost as well in plastic as they are in vinyl.
   A million of the 12\-inch fashion dolls have been sold since
they were introduced a month ago, Wayne Charness, a spokesman for
toymaker Hasbro Inc., said Thursday.
   That's platinum.
   By comparison, the pop group's latest album, In Step, went
triple platinum last month, two months after it was released, said
an official with the Record Industry Association of America, who
asked that her name not be used.
   While not quite as popular as the records, ``retailers cannot
keep their store shelves stocked'' with the dolls, Charness said.
   ``We expect whatever we get for the remainder of the year will
sell out,'' said Stephen J. Sanberg, a wholesale toy distributor
for H. Sanberg and Son-Sanco Toy of Foxboro, Mass. ``It's a
pleasant surprise in a relatively flat toy year.''
   ``It's selling well now and we expect it to continue doing well
through Christmas,'' said Angela Bourdon, spokeswoman for the Toys
'R Us Inc. chain.
   For Hasbro, which had slow sales this year, the doll's
popularity is good news. Sluggish sales in the second-quarter cut
the company's profits to $8.7 million, down nearly 52 percent from
the same period a year ago.
   Alan G. Hassenfeld, chairman and chief executive, said at the
time that he still expected a year-end result similar to 1989,
based on anticipated sales of the New Kids dolls and others
resembling members of the World Wrestling Federation.
   Hasbro, whose line also includes traditional favorites such as
G.I. Joe and Mr. Potato Head, had net sales of about $1.41 billion
last year.
   ``We are extremely pleased by (the New Kids dolls') first-month
performance,'' Charness said. ``Early indications are that we have
a real hit on our hands.''
   There are two styles of New Kids dolls, one in concert clothes
that comes with a tape and retails for about $18, and one in street
clothes that sells for about $15.
   Charness said dolls usually attract girls aged 4 to 10, but the
New Kids also have been selling to young teen-agers up to age 15.
   ``The older girls are using them as a kind of three-dimensional
poster,'' he said.
   It's been five years since a major toy company made a doll based
on a pop group. A Michael Jackson doll, launched by LJN Toys Ltd.
of New York, was on the market for less than a year, but did
``exceptionally well for a short period of time,'' a spokesman
said.
   Other New Kids products marketed by various companies include a
book, beach towels, watches, T-shirts, lunch boxes and a TV cartoon
show.
   Charness said there are plans at Hasbro for New Kids in 1991
``that we think will extend the longevity of the doll,'' but he
would not identify the plans.
   An unidentified toy industry source told The Providence
Journal-Bulletin that a soft, stuffed New Kids doll will be
introduced next year.

   Will there be joy in toyland this year? 

   For the past couple of years, toy sales haven't been ringing up the cash register as often as toy makers would like. 
Last year's sales, at $12.5 billion, were the same as in 1986. 
Many high-priced, high-tech toys failed to sell well. 
Boys' action figures weren't very active. 
And the industry again lacked a megahit. 

   But 1988 is another year, and toy companies aren't giving up. 
They are displaying 5,000 new toys, in addition to the estimated 150,000 already on the market, to 17,000 buyers at the American International Toy Fair this week and next. 

   A visit to the fair gives a peek at what children may be nagging their parents to buy in coming months. 

   ---
   Toy makers talk about going "back to basics." 
Translation: Nobody's counting on a megahit this year. 

   "We're not going out to try to hit home runs," says Stephen Hassenfeld, chairman and chief executive of Hasbro Inc., the nation's largest toy maker. 
"We're a singles and doubles team. 
If one goes out of the park, that's fine." 
Mattel, whose high-priced, talking doll Heather fared poorly last year, is introducing Little Miss Makeup, a $20 doll whose face "makeup" appears with the application of cold water and disappears with warm water. 

   From Coleco Industries Inc. comes Clay the Word; it's like charades, with clues sculpted instead of acted out. 
Tonka Corp.'s Kenner Products unit, in a variation on baseball cards, offers Starting Lineup, 3 3/4-inch-tall figures of real players along with statistic cards, for about $5 each. 
Hasbro's Milton Bradley unit reintroduces two board games from the 1960s, Crossfire and Hands Down, for about $12. 

   ---
   Still, pricey toys aren't totally out. 

   Worlds of Wonder Inc. brings out a GT Super Screamers model race car for about $150 that can go 35 miles an hour on a special track. 
Tyco Toys Inc., for up to $125, offers radio-controlled cars that reach speeds of up to 25 miles an hour. 
In the fall, Mattel will introduce TV Play Along Wheel of Fortune, a $75 console game that will allow fans to "compete" against on-the-air players on the television program. 

   Parker Bros. this summer will introduce Starting Lineup Talking Baseball, a $100 electronic baseball game. 
It pits teams of All Stars against each other, with individual strengths and weaknesses taken into account to determine the outcome. 
Atari Corp. has a Flight Simulator game that mimics real flying conditions; the game works only on a new $149 Atari video-game player. 

   Still, Hasbro and Worlds of Wonder are delaying for at least a year the introduction of expensive new interactive television games, in part to work out any bugs in the technology. 

   ---
   Who are the next Garbage Pail Kids? 

   Worlds of Wonder offers Germs, $5 plastic creatures that "cause" everyday ailments such as hiccups and burps; they're "grosser-looking" than real germs under a microscope, the company boasts. 
Lego Systems, demonstrating the versatility of its plastic building blocks, tells of a 13-year-old Danish boy who put together a two-foot-tall robot; the robot can eat, break up and eliminate bits of pasta. 
When it's full, its eyes turn green. 

   How about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, 4 1/2-inch action figures that are said to have been disfigured by radioactive slime, from Playmates for $4 to $5 each? 

   ---
   Here's one for child philosophers. 

   Milton Bradley scored with Scruples, its adult board game that poses ethical questions. 
So it's introducing Scruples for Kids. 
An example: "You've just had a fight with your sister and you see a caterpillar crawling in her salad. 
Do you tell her?" 

   ---
   As at any party, who's not here can be as interesting as who is here. 

   Rambo has been discharged from further duty. 
After disappointing sales, Coleco has discontinued the movie-based action figure. 
Jem, Hasbro's answer to Mattel's Barbie, has been given the pink slip, too. (Still, Hasbro launches a new assault on Barbie with another doll, Maxie, a highschooler whose claim to fame is waist-length beautiful hair.) 

   Lewis Galoob Toys Inc.'s talking Smarty Bear and Tonka's talking Barkers stuffed dog have been sent to the animal kingdom in the sky.

<TEXT>
   When Ronald Reagan was preparing to debate
Jimmy Carter in 1980, Stanford University economist Michael J.
Boskin had a background role as a practice questioner.
   One administration later, Boskin is providing some answers for
George Bush in his drive for the presidency.
   Boskin, 42, is by all accounts ready to follow Bush to the White
House in January to collect the reward due a highly regarded,
staunchly loyal Republican economist. The influential chairmanship
of the president's Council of Economic Advisers may await if Bush
wins.
   ``Michael is right there at the top'' of the hierarchy of
campaign advisers, said Mark Goodin, Bush's deputy press secretary.
``He is very heavily involved in advising the vice president on a
wide range of economic issues.''
   Boskin's most notable contribution to the campaign is a proposal
he helped to shape for dealing with the federal budget deficit. The
so-called flexible freeze would hold federal spending, except for
Social Security benefits, to the levels of the 1989 budget plus
inflation.
   The political beauty of the plan is that it doesn't commit Bush
to any specific budget cuts. Individual programs would not have to
be frozen, but additional spending in any category would have to be
balanced by reductions in other programs.
   This summer Boskin was quoted widely as saying it could
eliminate the $150 billion deficit, which he sees as the nation's
most pressing economic problem, in four years. But he contended in
a recent interview only that it would achieve the task ``over the
next few years.''
   ``It will depend partly on how the economy does,'' he said. ``I
never said it would entirely eliminate the deficit by 1993.''
   It is that caution and sense of what is both ``eminently do-able
and sound economics,'' as he describes the conditional freeze, that
has earned Bush's trust.
   As part of his growing campaign duties, Boskin now flies around
the country briefing reporters and audiences on the vice
president's proposals. He also prepares position papers and reviews
the proposals of other economists.
   Last May, he was one of a group of experts who visited Bush at
his home in Kennebunkport, Maine, to plot economic strategy. Among
others at that meeting was Martin S. Feldstein, former chairman of
President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, who also remains a
high-profile economic adviser to Bush.
   Boskin, like his counterpart in the Democratic camp, Lawrence
Summers of Harvard University, is at ease mixing economics and
politics.
   ``What's especially good about Michael is that he's had some
practical experience and has a good idea how the world works,''
said Martin Anderson, former domestic policy adviser to Reagan and
Boskin's colleague at the Hoover Institution.
   ``He has an excellent reputation as an economist, and he also
has an idea of the reasonable political thing to do,'' he said.
   A native of New York, Boskin moved to Los Angeles with his
family when he was 6. His father was working as a construction
contractor, his mother as a bookkeeper and then an accountant.
   He studied economics at the University of California at
Berkeley, where he was named the outstanding graduate of the class
of 1967.
   Boskin wrote his dissertation on the effects of welfare and
other income-maintenance programs on the size of the labor force,
winning the National Tax Association's award for outstanding
doctoral dissertation.
   He is described by Anderson as a hard-line Republican, but at
Berkeley in the tumultuous '60s Boskin was known as quite liberal.
   ``I was sympathetic with the goals _ freedom of speech, civil
rights _ and I still am,'' he said earlier this year. ``But I was
not sympathetic with the methods,'' such as student sit-ins and
strikes.
   He went from Berkeley to Stanford, where he has been ever since
except for a year of teaching at Harvard a decade ago and brief
periodic consulting jobs for Congress. Besides his unpaid work for
Bush this year, he has been busy writing two books on economics,
teaching a graduate course in fiscal policy and an introductory
economics course, and acting as West Coast director of the National
Bureau of Economic Research, a think tank.
   Boskin minces no words in his criticism of the economic policies
of Bush's campaign foe. He says Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
would foul up ``one of the best growth episodes in the 20th
century'' that has occurred over the past five years.
   ``That includes a huge reduction in inflation and interest rates
and immense expansion of employment,'' he said.
   While he acknowledges that growth in wages has fallen behind the
pace of the 1950s and '60s, he contends that's a by-product of
rapid job growth and says overall living standards have not
declined.
   ``We have the beginning of some major transformations in the
role of government in the economy. We've had success in reducing
marginal tax rates. ... We have to build on what we have,'' Boskin
said.
   Boskin was sharply critical of Reagan's early policies in his
book entitled ``Reagan and the Economy: The Successes, Failures and
Unfinished Agenda.'' But like Bush, who eight years ago brass who
appears on the new ABC sitcom ``Just the 10 of Us.''
   Commercials begin with the Maxie doll at school or with friends,
then switch to Theiss, the ``real-life Maxie,'' in the same
situations, Charness said, calling it ``innovative advertising for
a fashion doll.''
   The company expects to spend about $7 million on Maxie
commercials and live presentations through the end of the year,
Charness said.
   Maxie comes in several variations: three different ``Making
Waves'' dolls, a ``Looking Smart'' doll with skirt, stockings and
boots; and a scented ``Perfect Prom'' doll with pink mini-gown.
Prices range from $5.50 to $13.
   She also has four friends: Ron, her boyfriend; Carly, another
blonde; Ashley, a red-head; and Kristen, who's black. She has a
myriad of accessories, from a cordless telephone to a locker with
built-in shower.
   Hasbro is betting that Barbie has outgrown some of the potential
market among young girls.
   Barbie is older, ``a yuppie if you will,'' Charness explained.
``We felt there was a real need in the market for dolls that are
younger.''
   Maxie is a high school student who does ``the type of things
girls would (imagine doing),'' Charness said.
   But Mattel, the No. 2 toy company, says Maxie, a long-haired,
perpetually smiling teen with lace stockings, white boots and
various hair do-dads, won't even put a dent in the solid success of
Barbie.
   ``This year, we're selling tremendously more dolls, fashions and
accessories,'' said Jocelyn Carter-Miller, director of marketing at
Mattel, based in Hawthorne, Calif.
   She cited ``unprecedented growth,'' but would not provide
specifics.
   ``I don't feel it's a significant threat to Barbie's No. 1
position as a fashion doll,'' Mrs. Carter-Miller said of Maxie.
``She's been in the No. 1 position for 29 years, and this year is a
record year.''
   And Barbie is not just an executive yuppie, Mrs. Carter-Miller
said, but a teen-ager as well.
   ``Barbie represents everything, from being a teen-ager up to a
doctor,'' she said.
   Barbie, introduced as a teen-age fashion doll in 1959, was an
airline stewardess in the 1960s and 1970s, a registered nurse,
fashion editor, astronaut and skin diver in the 1960s, and a doctor
in the early 1970s.
   ``She has been able to be ageless. That's something that makes
Barbie very special and makes her existence difficult to compete
with,'' Mrs. Carter-Miller said.
   Industry analyst David Liebowitz of American Securities in New
York, although noting that Maxie can wear Barbie's clothes, said
Maxie could not survive if it were merely a Barbie clone.
   ``What we are seeing now are products that aren't competing
head-to-head with Barbie but are slightly differentiated,''
Leibowitz said.
   Steven Eisenberg of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. in New York suggested
that Maxie's lower price range could bolster its competitive
position.
   Although basic-issue Barbies can be obtained for as little as
$4, the $13 top-of-the-line Maxie is slightly less expensive than
the comparable Perfume Pretty edition of Barbie, which sells for
$15.
   ``What Hasbro is attempting to do here is to capture a moderate
share of the fashion doll market at a low price range,'' Eisenberg
said.

<LEADPARA>  The toy business looks a little like a war zone this Christmas -- battles are
raging between video game giants Nintendo and Sega, and between retailers Toys
R Us and Child World.;   Then there's another big skirmish, pitting
manufacturers and merchants on one side and reluctant consumers on the other.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Business  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  KIDS' TOYS SPUR GROWN-UP WORRIES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Who will win? Certainly, the nation's children, but who the other victors
are remains to be seen.;   This much is known: 1991 is expected to be another
flat year for the overall toy industry, with sales not much above levels of
1990. Toymakers and retailers have felt the pinch of the recession and
uncertain economic recovery.;   Nintendo is more costly; "It's not going to be
a banner year. It should be roughly equivalent to last year, maybe a little
better," said John Devine, chief executive officer of Child World Inc.;   The
biggest question is how well Nintendo's new system will do -- not just at
Christmas, but into 1992. The $200 system, with enhanced abilities over its
predecessor, has several hurdles to overcome -- it sports a large price while
budget-conscious consumers are curtailing spending, and it's entering a
saturated video game market.;   Super Nintendo was a big hit when introduced
in August, but sales have slackened since then, said Paul Valentine, a toy
industry analyst with Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.;   The new Nintendo "is going to
be a harder sell than people originally anticipated," he said.;   Other
observers are more upbeat.;   Challenges for Sega, Atari; "You may see a
slowdown after a rush -- then as the Christmas shopping season approaches,
you'll have a regeneration of sales," said Bob Seligman, editor of the trade
publication Toy &amp; Hobby World.;   Nintendo has stiffer competition for its
16-bit system than it had for its highly successful 8-bit units. Sega of
America's Genesis system, which dominated the 16-bit market before Super
Nintendo's introduction, has sold well and is expected to be on many wish
lists.;   A bit is the smallest unit of information a computer can recognize.;
  Both games are well ahead of Silicon Valley's Atari, which has lowered the
price on its Lynx system, and NEC Corp., which offers the Turbo-Grafx line.;  
The video game business may encounter resistance from consumers blanching at
the thought of spending $150 or $200 for hardware and as much as $60 a pop for
games. Millions of parents have already bought 8-bit systems and hand-held
games.;   Valentine also warned that the novelty of video may have worn off
for some kids. He called the 16-bit systems "an evolutionary product as
opposed to revolutionary.";   The nation's biggest makers of more traditional
toys, including Hasbro Inc., Mattel Inc. and Tyco Toys Inc., have done well in
1991, partly because sales of 8-bit video systems began to slide.;   At Tyco,
sales are expected to top $520 million this year, compared with $461 million
in 1990. Chairman Dick Grey attributed the gain partly to the decline in video
sales.;   "Those dollars are going to other boys' toys," particularly
high-action boys toys such as radio-controlled vehicles, he said.;   Analysts
say sales of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles also have fallen from their peak.
But after bringing in $500 million in sales in 1990, the reptilian
crime-fighters from Playmates Inc. are still a force for other manufacturers
to reckon with.;   Old standards are selling better than ever as parents who
grew up in the 1950s and '60s want their children to enjoy the same toys they
did.;   The queen of the perennials is Mattel Inc.'s Barbie.;   "This is not a
toy, this is an institution," said Seligman. "We wish there could be more toys
like that, because this is a flat industry.";   Other evergreens include G.I.
Joe, Monopoly and Lego blocks.;   Retailers say newer toys selling well
include Lewis Galoob Toys' Baby Face, a line of 10 dolls with different facial
expressions, and Playmates' Waterbabies, dolls that jiggle like newborns when
filled with warm water.;   The Disney movie "The Little Mermaid" inspired
manufacturers to bring out dolls based on the mermaid Ariel. Tyco's Little
Mermaid, licensed by Disney, "is doing terrifically," said Valentine.;   Other
dolls, including baby and toddler models that drink, crawl, ride bicycles, tap
dance etc., also are doing well. Cabbage Patch Kids, made by Hasbro, are back
in a variety of sizes and styles.  </TEXT>

   Tonka Discloses
   It Is in Talks
   To Be Bought

   The maker of Monopoly may be leaving the board, a move
that would reduce the number of big players in the
rough-edged game known as toy manufacturing.
   Tonka Corp., whose toy chest also includes Play-Doh and
sturdy dump trucks, disclosed it is holding talks over the
"possible sale of the company."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Reflecting the cutthroat nature of the toy industry, the
nation's third largest toy maker cited its weighty debt load
in the current sluggish retail environment.
   Tonka didn't identify the party or parties with which it's
talking and stressed the "preliminary" nature of the
discussions. But one source close to Mattel Inc., which is
vying to become the top toymaker, identified the El Segundo,
Calif., company as a suitor. Mattel, maker of the popular
Barbie dolls, is said to be particularly interested in
Tonka's line of Parker Bros. board games, including Monopoly,
and its boys' toy line.
   But Tonka officials want to sell the company as a whole
and not in pieces. One Mattel alternative would be to buy
Tonka and then sell the parts it doesn't want. Some industry
experts, however, wondered whether there would be much
interest in the less-desirable portions of Tonka's business.
   Tonka joins a list of slumping makers and retailers facing
deep troubles. Late last week, Lewis Galoob Toys Inc. said it
is considering a possible sale or merger. The San Francisco
toy maker, battered by declining sales of its Micro Machines
miniature vehicles, said it expects to post a 1990 loss of
about $30 million. And Child World Inc., a big toy retailer,
is having difficulties paying its bills.
   The latest Christmas selling season was a dreadful one for
toy manufacturers in general, as buyers cut back because of
recessionary fears. Tonka, for one, was hurt even more
because its licensed toys -- such as its Ghostbusters line --
have largely matured, and new offerings haven't yet produced
any similar big sellers. In addition, an agreement under
which it distributed a video game was terminated at the end
of 1989, trimming revenue.
   Mattel is one of the nation's few financially healthy toy
companies, having recovered from a major restructuring
undertaken three years ago. Mattel and Hasbro Inc. have been
vying for the industry's No. 1 position in toy sales. But as
business has slowed in the U.S., Mattel has been looking
abroad for expansion.
   A Mattel spokesman declined to comment on whether the
company is interested in Tonka's assets. But John Amerman,
Mattel's chairman and chief executive officer, has said over
the past year that the company would consider acquisitions in
areas where Mattel has less of a presence, such as boys' toys
or board games.
   Also, Mattel last October hired David M. Mauer, previously
president of Tonka's U.S. Toy Group, as one of two presidents
of Mattel USA. Mr. Mauer, 41 years old, is charged with
helping Mattel break away from its traditional position as a
girls' toy maker and boost its percentage of toys for boys
from 15% to between 25% and 30%.
   The company has not had a major hit in boys' toys since
its hugely successful HeMan line was launched in the
mid-1980s. Much of Mattel's recent success has stemmed from
old standbys such as Barbie and its Hot Wheels miniature
cars.
   Tonka said yesterday that it expects to report a
"substantial loss" for the fourth quarter and for the year.
It didn't quantify the projected loss, but said it would come
on sales that were flat with the year-ago period at about
$244.7 million.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Tonka shares dropped 75 cents, or 15%, to close at $4.375.
The stock had been trading at just above $3 a share until
moving up on heavier-than-normal trading late last week.
   The Minnetonka, Minn., company loaded itself with debt in
late 1987 to acquire Kenner Parker Toys Inc. for about $555
million. That acquisition gave Tonka, known then for its line
of toy vehicles and promotional toys, some of the most famous
brand names in America's playrooms -- including Monopoly, and
the board game Sorry, along with Nerf balls and the PlayDoh
modeling compound. With Kenner, Tonka also picked up a
company known for its savvy in licensing toys linked to
movies and television.
   From the beginning, industry experts wondered whether
Tonka could absorb the heavy debt that the ambitious purchase
required. Those questions have grown even louder in recent
months.
   Last year, Tonka's strained finances caused it to
negotiate an amended payment schedule with bank lenders, and
both major rating agencies have recently marked down the
company's subordinated debt, citing concerns over what one
called Tonka's "deteriorating" financial situation.
   Through the first nine months of 1990, Tonka racked up
losses of $25.4 million, or $1.74 a share, on sales that
declined by 14% to $541.3 million.
   Tonka may also have to take a charge to cover money owed
it by Child World. Tonka says it is still "assessing" that
situation.

   A Ken doll dressed in Barbie's clothing
wasn't a manufacturing mistake after all. It was a stock clerk's
prank.
   A clerk at a Toys R Us store acknowledged Tuesday he redressed
the doll one night while goofing off. The store fired him when he
confessed.
   ``We always did crazy things like that,'' Ron Zero said of the
antics of the store's late-night stockers. ``We'd hang dolls in the
aisle or put Ken and Barbie in the Barbie house with Barbie
spanking Ken.''
   Carina Guillot bought the Ken doll in the Tampa store last month
while visiting from New Jersey. It was dressed in a purple tank top
and a lace-covered purple and turquoise skirt.
   The doll quickly became a national spectacle _ spoofed by
Arsenio Hall, featured on ``The Joan Rivers Show'' and in Newsweek
and Fortune magazines.
   ``Oh well, it generated a lot of excitement for a while,'' Mrs.
Guillot said.
   The director of the store said he was embarrassed and Mattel,
the doll's maker, said it was vindicated.
   The store clerk said he dressed not one but three Ken dolls in
women's clothes. He resealed the boxes with clear glue.
   He said he doesn't know what happened to the first one, and
store managers have the third one. Store managers say that's not
true.
   Zero said he laughed when he saw news stories about the doll.
   ``It was a kid clowning around,'' said store director Greg
Warren. ``We had one fellow with quite a sense of humor.''
   Warren said Zero was fired for tampering with the Ken dolls and
several other toys.

   Mattel Inc. and Rollerblade Inc., a major maker of skates,
signed a world-wide licensing agreement to sell two doll
lines based on the popular sport. Terms weren't disclosed.
   Los Angeles-based Mattel will launch Baby Rollerblade, a
15-inch doll that skates on replicas of Rollerblade brand
skates, and a Rollerblade Barbie and friends line at a toy
industry trade show next month. The Baby Rollerblade doll,
which will retail for about $36, furthers the toy maker's
push into the large doll category.

   Rollerblade skates, introduced in 1980 as an off-season
training tool for hockey players, have a single blade-like
row of wheels and look something like a cross between
traditional roller skates and ice skates. Rollerblade, based
in Minneapolis, said the dolls will help introduce girls to
its new line of children's skates.

   Beatrice Alexander Behrman, founder of an early
U.S. doll company whose handcrafted Madame Alexander dolls became
collector's items and were exhibited in museums around the world,
died Wednesday at age 95.
   Mrs. Behrman, who was widely known as Madame Alexander, died of
natural causes at her home in Palm Beach, Fla., said spokesman Beau
James. She founded the Alexander Doll Co. in 1923 and sold it to
two New York businessmen in 1988 but remained a consultant.
   Madame Alexander dolls take up to three weeks to craft by hand
and are the foremost collectible dolls in the world. The company
has introduced more than 5,000 different dolls.
   Her doll collections were based on fantasy, historic events,
literature, music art and movies. ``I made dolls for children to
play with and learn from of life and of art,'' she said in an
interview several years ago.
   Mrs. Behrman was the daughter of a Russian immigrant who moved
to New York and established his own toy shop and the country's
first doll hospital. During World War I, she designed and helped
make ``Red Cross Nurse'' rag dolls that were sold by her father's
company.
   She was inspired to start her own line of dolls after shipments
of European dolls to the United States virtually ceased during
World War I. Her husband, Philip Behrman, quit his job with a New
York hat company to run the business end of his wife's firm.
   Mrs. Behrman became known as Madame Alexander in the doll world
with the first of her dolls, rag dolls with mask-type features and
pressed features that she hand-painted. The emphasis on facial
features was a departure from old-fashioned rag dolls with flat
faces.
   By the 1930s, she started making dolls whose heads had painted
features and eyes that closed. Madame Alexander dolls emphasized
lifelike details, right down to the knuckles of fingers and
eyelashes. The dolls also were known for their rooted and
elaborately styled hair and stylish clothes.
   After World War II, she followed the trend to plastic, and made
dolls with vinyl heads and vinyl, hard plastic or cloth bodies.
   In the early 1950s, she won the Fashion Academy Award for her
doll clothing designs. Clothes of all sizes, not just miniatures,
compete for the award.
   The British government commissioned a special design of Madame
Alexander dolls representing Queen Elizabeth II before and after
her coronation in 1953, and her sister, Princess Margaret.
   In 1968, the Smithsonian Institution chose two dolls to include
in its doll collection: the ``Madame'' doll, based on the American
Revolution, and the ``Scarlett O'Hara'' doll from ``Gone With the
Wind.''
   Other well-known dolls were inspired by Alice in Wonderland, the
four sisters in ``Little Women,'' and characters from Charles
Dickens' books. Her line of ``Portrait Dolls'' began production in
the early 1940s. Up to 21 inches tall, the dolls included ``Orphan
Annie,'' ``Renoir Girl'' and ``Nancy Drew.''
   New dolls range in price from $40 to $500, while collector items
sell for as much as $5,000.
   The Alexander Doll Co., headquartered in Harlem, is that area's
largest private employer, with 650 employees.
   Survivors include Mrs. Behrman's daughter, Mildred, and a
grandson. Funeral services will be held Sunday at the Riverside
Memorial Chapel in Manhattan.

   With an uncertain Christmas season under way, toy
company executives said Wednesday they are looking for more
business opportunities overseas to offset the sluggish U.S. retail
market.
   ``The outlook in international markets is brighter,'' John W.
Amerman, chief executive officer of Mattel Inc., said at a toy
industry conference sponsored by the investment firm Bear, Stearns
&amp; Co. Inc.
   Executives generally agreed their industry will feel pressure
from the sagging U.S. economy during the holiday season although
strong products should continue to sell well. Toy sales have
slipped along with sales of other merchandise as consumers,
uncertain about the economy and the Middle East, curtailed their
spending in recent months.
   ``It's really a mixed question,'' said Alan Hassenfeld, chief
executive officer of Hasbro Inc.
   While Hasbro expects a healthy performance from its Cabbage
Patch dolls and Milton Bradley board games, ``it might not be a
buoyant Christmas season,'' Hassenfeld said.
   Overall, the U.S. toy industry has seen slow growth in recent
years, rising from a $12.4 billion market in 1986 to $13.4 billion
last year, according to estimates from the Toy Manufacturers of
America, a trade group.
   This year, the figure is expected to climb to $14 billion.
   Those totals do not include video games, which were hot-selling
items during the 1980s. Nintendo of America Inc. projects that the
company and its licensees will sell about $4 billion worth of video
game products this year.
   But even Nintendo, which dominates the U.S. video game market,
expects to see a drop in sales of its hardware systems this year.
The company does project strong growth in its software game
cartridges.
   ``Rumors of our demise continue to be premature,'' Peter T.
Main, vice president of marketing for Nintendo, said in prepared
remarks at the conference.
   Main said that as the market for his company's products matures,
``software will continue to be the critical ingredient.''
   Hassenfeld said a maturing video game market is a positive sign
for makers of board games, such as Milton Bradley.
   Another encouraging trend is the growth in international sales,
he said. Hasbro, which does about one-third of its business abroad,
expects international sales to increase by more than 30 percent
this year, he said.
   Tyco Toys Inc., with 13 percent of its sales coming in foreign
countries, has a smaller international base but also hopes to
expand it quickly, said Richard E. Grey, chief executive officer of
the company.
   While Tyco expects its sales to grow by about 14 percent in the
next three years, it projects international growth at 30 percent
over the same period.
   At Mattel, which does about half of its business abroad,
international sales grew by 31 percent during the first three
quarters of 1990, compared with overall growth of 19 percent.
   Amerman said the company hopes to strengthen its foreign
business in the near future. In 1991, Mattel plans to introduce a
new line of Barbie dolls in conjunction with Bennetton, the Italian
apparel retailer.
   Mattel, which makes Disney toys, also hopes to see a boost in
business when a new Disneyland opens in Europe in 1992, he said.
   Amerman said Europe has about twice as many young children as
the United States, and while there might be less disposable income
in some European countries, the ``sheer weight of numbers assures
Mattel consistent growth in the early 1990s.''

   Big success has come in small packages for Lewis
Galoob Toys Inc.
   Its tiny vehicles have been zooming off store shelves. Micro
Machines have ridden onto Toy and Hobby World magazine's monthly
lineup of fast sellers all year, consistently finishing in the top
10 places and frequently in the first, second or third slots.
   David Galoob says the company is headed toward being a major
player in the toy business in the 1990s. Analysts are impressed
with its progress so far.
   Galoob provided an early look at next year's toys Friday in a
tour of the company's New York showroom.
   ``Miniature has worked for Galoob and we believe that it can
work again,'' the president and chief executive officer said in an
interview. The company is named for his father, who founded it more
than three decades ago and died in 1971.
   Many of the new toys Galoob will roll out next year continue the
small-size theme that has helped the company stage a strong
comeback from a 1987 industrywide slump. Galoob lost almost $25
million that year but returned to profitability in 1988 by earning
more than $6 million.
   New models of the thimble-sized Micro Machines will be added to
the hundreds already available. Some will have a magnifying lens in
place of a sun roof so children can peer into the teeny interior.
New playsets are being added to the car-wash and service station
already on the market.
   Ultra-small vehicles inside regular-sized Micro Machines will be
brought out in 1990. A motorized train and track set also will be
unveiled.
   The existing collection, which appeals to children's acquisitive
instincts, includes commonplace and fancy cars from diminutive
Rolls Royces to souped-up Dodge Vans. The line also has ambulances,
fire engines, trucks, boats, tanks, planes and trains.
   One 1990 addition to Galoob's miniatures for girls is Secret
Places, a series of dolls in rooms with furniture and appliances
that open to reveal even smaller but virtually identical versions.
New offspring of the successful Bouncin' Baby miniature doll line
will make their debut.
   Galoob started thinking small in 1987 when consumers soured on
high-priced, high-tech toys.
   Keeping prices down _ a package of five Micro Machines can be
bought for under $10 _ proved wise over the past two years when so
much money was being spent on home video games. Children and their
parents haven't had much left over for other toys after buying
Nintendo games.
   ``We were able to live and compete very well with the video game
onslaught,'' Galoob boasts.
   Retail analysts say Galoob is one of the only companies that has
kept coming up with creative products despite the competitive
challenge of video games.
   While industry leaders like Hasbro Inc. and Mattel Inc. turned
to classics like G.I. Joe and Barbie, Galoob has established a new
category of miniature collectibles. In the process, Micro Machines
have whizzed past Mattel's Hot Wheels and Universal Matchbox Group
Ltd.'s matchbox cars to become the most popular collectible vehicle
line in the world.
   The company expects to have $200 million in sales this year, up
from $140 million in 1988. It has managed to do it with less money
to spend on research and development than its larger competitors,
such as No.1 Hasbro, which analysts estimate will have $1.5 billion
in 1989 sales.
   ``It really is a challenge for us to compete with those
gentlemen that have bigger dollars at their disposal,'' Galoob said.
   After previewing next year's toys, analyst Paul Valentine of
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said he upgraded his investment opinion on
Galoob to a strong buy from neutral. ``I was very impressed with
what they had,'' Valentine said.
   Besides the miniature items, one of Galoob's 1990 toys is a
stuffed animal with battery-powered, illuminated eyes that small
children can take to bed as a night light. A talking doll that
moves her lips also is waiting in the wings and will sell for about
$60.
   ``We don't mind getting into higher priced, high-tech toys _ we
just don't want to be dependent on them,'' David Galoob said.
   How well Galoob does outside the miniature category could
determine whether it can make the transition to a big-time toy
company.
   Analyst Walter Kirchberger of PaineWebber Group Inc. said the
verdict is still out on whether Galoob has done enough to diversify
and protect itself if Micro Machines fall out of favor. Micro
Machines will account for more than half of Galoob's 1989 business,
which was the case in 1988 as well.
   It will be tougher for Galoob to impress Wall Street next year
because the company will face a much higher tax rate, eroding
after-tax earnings.
   ``For earnings to be up in 1990, sales will have to be up quite
a bit,'' Kirchberger said.
   Through three quarters of this year, Galoob has earned about $14
million, up more than three-fold from a year earlier, while sales
totaled about $170 million, up 80 percent.
   Eighty-five percent of Galoob's manufacturing is done in China.
The company is trying to spread out to other Asian nations and was
planning to rely more on Thailand and Indonesia even before the
June uprising in China, David Galoob said.
   Growth in the next decade will partly come through acquisitions
and Galoob says the company, which is based in South San Francisco,
Calif., has put aside $40 million for the purpose.
   In the meantime, he expressed confidence about business
prospects despite weakness in the economy. ``There are always
children so the toy industry is sort of recession-proof.''

<HL> Toy Industry Faces a Lackluster Year
---
Absence of Runaway
Hits Is a Major Factor
---
By Jospeh Pereira
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL>
<DD> 07/27/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<IN> WOWI HAS CLO MAT KPT </IN>
<TEXT>
   For the past nine months, G.I. Joe and Barbie doll have been sitting in the one and two slots, respectively, on the bestseller chart for toys. 

   To the toy industry that isn't very good news. 

   It means that runaway hits like Cabbage Patch and Trivial Pursuit, each of which jingled the cash register at more than $500 million a year, are notably absent. 
By comparison, G.I. Joe, projected to bring in $185 million this year, is small potatoes. 

   Last year, without any new hits, the toy industry had lackluster sales. 
And analysts, taking a peek up the road, don't see any blockbuster candidates this year. 
As a result, they are scaling down their estimates of toy sales for 1987. 

   At the start of the year, analysts were projecting a 5% to 7% increases in sales from 1986. 
Thomas Kully, an analyst with William Blair &amp; Co. of Chicago, was among them. 
"Now I'm thinking zero to less than 5% would be more realistic," he said. 

   The second half of the year "is bound to pick up but I don't think it will be enough to save the year," Harold Vogel, a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets analyst, said. 

   Lately, toy makers have been posting disappointing second-quarter earnings. 
In Pawtucket, R.I., Hasbro Inc., the nation's largest toy manufacturer, last week reported a 44% drop in profit on an 11% decline in revenue. 
In Hartford, Conn., Coleco Industries Inc., which sells Cabbage Patch dolls, edged into the black after three quarters in the red, but its second-quarter profit fell 29%. 
And in Fremont, Calif., high-flying Worlds of Wonder Inc. scaled back a planned financing after watching its stock tumble and posting a sharp drop in profit for the quarter ended March 30. 

   The No. 2 toy producer, Mattel Inc. of Hawthorne, Calif., will issue its second-quarter results in mid-August. 
"Don't expect its numbers to be impressive," Mr. Kully said. 
"They'll be at about break-even point." 

   Part of the blame for the current famine is the plenty of the past. 

   Since 1982, the toy industry has been helped by blockbusters such as Pacman, Masters of the Universe and Transformers that caused industrywide sales to multiply sharply. 

   To expect the industry to keep up that pace is unrealistic, said Harry Wells, an analyst at Adams Harkness &amp; Hill in Boston. 
Between 1977 and 1984, annual spending on toys climbed from $65 per child to $168 per child, according to Find/SVP, a New York research group. 
"In those days the industry was like a baseball team with a batting average of .900," Mr. Wells said. 
"Now it's playing .600 ball," he added. 

   "I don't think it's fair to judge things by Cabbage Patch," said Norman Ricken, president of Toys "R" Us Inc. of Rochelle Park, N.J., the nation's largest toy retailer. 

   Mr. Ricken isn't writing off 1987 yet. 
"There are some good products out there. 
Some of them have been late in getting to retailers, like Captain Power (a toy activated by a television set) and Heather Doll, both by Mattel. 
They ought to do well," he added. 

   Others aren't so optimistic. 
Last February, toy manufacturers previewed some of the new products for retailers at a trade show in New York. 
"I didn't really see any excitement on the faces of people as in years past," said Rick Anguilla, editor of Toy &amp; Hobby, a trade publication. 

   In the next few months, Hasbro will introduce Visionary plastic figures portraying characters from a distant planet and Air Raiders dolls and flying objects that operate on air pressure. 

   But Robert Hubbell, Hasbro's vice president, investor relations, isn't predicting another Cabbage Patch phenomenon. 
"Comparing this to the game of baseball, I think Visionaries and Air Raiders will be singles where Cabbage Patch or Trivial Pursuit are home runs. 
But I feel we're still fielding a solid team of steady hitters," he said. 
Using the same analogy, the company's Pogo Bal, third on the Toy &amp; Hobby best-seller chart, is a double, Mr. Hubbell said. 
The company expects Pogo Bal to produce $35 million in sales this year, less than a fifth the sales of its top product, G.I. Joe. 

   Some toys were thought to have potential to become hits this year, but none captured the imagination of the consumer for any length of time. 

   Lazer Tag, Worlds of Wonder's long-nosed pistol that fires infra-red rays, triggered a national craze only for a few weeks. 
Selling for $80 to $130 each, with batteries that had to be replaced often, the game faded in popularity. 
The shooting of a Lazer Tag player in California by a police officer who mistook the youth for an armed prowler didn't help. 

   Hasbro's rock star Jem just couldn't stand up to competition from Mattel's Barbie with its 28-year tradition. 
And talking toys, put out by several companies, didn't climb very high on the charts. 
"Parents couldn't justify paying $70 for something that would hold the interest of their kids for half a week," Mr. Anguilla said. 

   Some toy makers have tried to create new toys based on characters on TV shows, such as "Masters of the Universe." 
The strategy was to use the shows as a promotion tool. 
But their efforts met with limited success. 
"People in the industry thought all you had to do was throw a toy out there with a lot of advertising and an animated show and chances are it was going to succeed. 
Now there is a glut of animated shows," he said. 

   The absence of a blockbuster isn't from lack of trying. 
The fact is no one knows the secret. 
"If I did, I wouldn't be doing what I do," said Hasbro's Mr. Hubbell, suggesting that if he knew what makes a hit toy, he would be in business for himself. 

   "I don't think you're going to get a Cabbage Patch more than once a decade. 
I don't know why, but it doesn't happen," Mr. Kully said.

<TEXT>     Mr. Ryan, who held more than 1,000 patents on inventions around the world,
designed the Sparrow and Hawk missiles when he worked for Raytheon. But it was
his toy inventions that put his engineering genius into households across the
United States.;   Mr. Ryan designed about 35 of the country's best-selling
toys, including the Chatty Cathy talking doll, Hot Wheels and many electronic
toys.;   But his best-known product was Barbie, the tall, slender, young adult
doll that could be purchased with a never-ending wardrobe, boyfriend Ken, and
cars, playhouses and career paraphernalia.;   Never mind that critics said
that the doll -- with its torpedo breasts, tiny waist and disproportionately
long legs -- gave little girls a false and unachievable ideal of the female
adult figure. Just about every girl wanted one anyway, complete with clothes
and accessories.;   Mr. Ryan applied part of the wealth he acquired from his
inventions to a Tudor mansion in 1962 in the upscale Bel-Air neighborhood of
Los Angeles and turned it into a major Southern California party site.;   He
and his then-wife, Barbara, opened the grounds and public rooms of the vast
mansion for charity fund-raisers, annually hosting more than 150 events with

   Boys across America may shake their heads in dismay, but the
courts have spoken: G.I. Joe is a doll, not a toy soldier.
   Hasbro Industries Inc. had sought to get Joe out of duty _ import
tariffs, that is _ by battling the less-than-macho designation of
doll. But a panel of three federal judges wasn't persuaded.
   Not to worry, said company officials in Pawtucket, R.I.
   ``G.I. Joe is still one of the guys,'' said Donald Robbins,
Hasbro vice president and general counsel. ``Boys know who he is.''
   ``Even though G.I. Joe has lost this battle, hopefully he will
not lose his courage for combat,'' wrote Judge Paul R. Michel of the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, upholding the
U.S. Customs Service in a July 12 ruling.
   At issue in the case was not just G.I. Joe's macho image, but a
sizable chunk of his booty from the toy wars. Since Hasbro began
importing G.I. Joe from Hong Kong in 1982, the Customs Service has
imposed a 12 percent tariff, amounting to millions of dollars.
   Last year, Hasbro argued before the U.S. Court of International
Trade in New York that G.I. Joe is just an updated version of the
traditional toy soldier and should not be subject to the duties
placed on imported dolls.
   Although he wears military duds, brandishes a submachine gun and
lugs an assault pack, both the trade court and the appeals court
ruled that Joe fit the standard definition of ``a representation of
a human being used as a child's plaything'' _ in other words, a doll.
   Ten-year-old Michael Ritchie of Allenwood, Texas, who has about
40 G.I. Joe figures, was skeptical.
   ``It's not really a doll,'' he said. ``It'd be weird for me if I
saw a girl playing with G.I. Joe, 'cause I never have. Girls usually
play with a doll or something.''
   ``The decision had an attempt at humor. But they really strictly
applied the dictionary definition,'' M. Barry Levy, who argued the
case for Hasbro, said from his New York office.
   When introduced 25 years ago, G.I. Joe was a pioneer in the
marketing of flexible plastic figurines to boys. Hasbro was always
careful to refer to him either as a ``mannequin'' or ``action
figure,'' never a doll.
   After a lull in sales in the late 1970s, Joe's popularity surged
in the 1980s as baby-boomers began buying their children the same
toys they had as kids. Since 1964, total sales of the G.I. Joe line
have exceeded $1.2 billion, Hasbro said.
   But like other old soldiers, Joe seems to be gradually fading
away. From his original 11{-inch size in 1964, he shrank to 8{
inches in 1976 and then to 3{ inches in 1982.
   At the same time, he has lost some of his maneuverability and now
comes permanently clothed in fatigues, rather than removable
uniforms.
   One thing hasn't changed, however. No matter what the courts say,
Hasbro marketing agents still talk about Joe as an ordinary GI,
dogface, paratrooper, ranger, green beret, grunt or leatherneck.
   Just about anything but a doll.
