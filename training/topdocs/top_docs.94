   Taken promptly, the anti-herpes drug acyclovir can reduce
the severity of a chicken-pox attack for children, a study
found.
   Researchers found the drug, sold under the brand name
Zovirax by Burroughs Wellcome Co., shortened a typical
chicken-pox episode by more than three days in 20% of
children tested. The research, involving more than 800
children and conducted at a number of U.S. medical centers,
found that the drug caused no serious adverse side effects.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The study, led by researchers at St. Louis University
under a grant by Burroughs Wellcome, confirms the preliminary
findings of a much smaller test in children that was reported
early in 1990. The most recent study, reported in yesterday's
edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, was included
as part of an application to the Food and Drug Administration
to market Zovirax against chicken pox. Wellcome is the U.S.
unit of the British drug maker, Wellcome PLC.
   The FDA said a panel of outside advisers to the agency
reviewed the study in early November and "after much
discussion and debate voted that the drug was safe and
effective." The full agency still must weigh the evidence.
Although the drug seems to reduce the severity of itchy
lesions and fever, some doctors have expressed concern about
giving a potent antiviral medicine to young children for an
illness that usually passes in less than a week with no
lasting effects.
   In the recent study, children were given the oral medicine
within 24 hours of the beginning of an outbreak of chicken
pox and were compared with a similar group given a placebo,
or inactive, pill. In most cases, those given Zovirax
developed no new rashes three days into the outbreak, while
20% of those getting placebo were developing new rashes into
the sixth day of the attack.
   Most children getting the drug didn't develop fever or
other symptoms after the third or fourth day, while those
symptoms lasted beyond four days for 20% of those getting the
placebo.
   In an editorial accompanying the study, Philip Brunell of
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, called the benefits
of the drug "moderate," and questioned whether parents could
get the medicine to their children quick enough to be
beneficial. Moreover, he said the drug, priced at $32 for a
treatment, would add $128 million to the annual U.S. health
bill.
   Dr. Brunell said the major hope for fighting chicken pox
is a vaccine, which is being developed by Merck &amp; Co. The
vaccine has been before the FDA for much of the past decade,
and Merck said it plans to reapply to the FDA for approval
with new data late next year. Preventing chicken-pox
infection may prevent the virus from breaking out again later
in life as shingles, a severe rash-like ailment. The vaccine
also may help prevent life-threatening chicken-pox attacks in
children whose immune system is compromised by leukemia.

<HEAD>New Vaccines Proposed For Whooping Cough, Chicken Pox</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A vaccine that would be the nation's first for
chicken pox has been submitted for federal approval, and a new
whooping cough vaccine with less risk of side effects may follow
soon.
   Chicken pox strikes more than 3 million Americans a year, mostly
children. While it is generally just bothersome, a small fraction of
patients suffer harm to the central nervous system or other
complications such as pneumonia or bacterial infections. About 175
Americans a year die from such problems.
   Some calculations suggest that given the medical costs of
complications, a chicken pox vaccine can make economic sense for
society as a whole.
   Merck Sharpe &amp; Dohme of West Point, Pa., in August asked the Food
and Drug Administration to approve its vaccine, which Stanley
Plotkin, chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics said is
already used in Japan and Europe.
   One question is whether a childhood inoculation will lose its
effectiveness in adulthood, a particular concern because chicken pox
is generally more serious when it strikes adults.
   ``We would all like more data'' on the duration of immunity,
Plotkin said. Studies have shown no problem up to 10 years after
inoculation, and vaccinated people who do get chicken pox later
appear to get milder cases, he said.
   The vaccine contains a weakened version of the chicken pox virus,
which in its natural form causes a lifelong nerve infection that can
erupt into herpes zoster, commonly called shingles. Studies suggest
that vaccinated people run a lower risk of later shingles than do
people who had chicken pox, Plotkin said.
   The standard vaccine for whooping cough, called pertussis, is
given in early childhood as part of the
diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, or DTP, vaccine.
   About half of children who get the DTP vaccine run a fever, with
swelling or soreness at the injection site in 40 percent to 50
percent, chiefly due to the pertussis portion of the vaccine,
according to one large study.
   The fever can cause convulsions, usually not a serious problem
but still upsetting for parents.
   In contrast, recent research found that fever appeared in only
about 5 percent of children vaccinated with a new ``acellular''
pertussis vaccine, and localized reactions were minimal, said James
Cherry of the University of California, Los Angeles, School of
Medicine.
   Lederle Laboratories of Wayne, N.J., may be ready by early next
year to ask the FDA to approve the new vaccine, a spokesman said.
The immunization, which eventually would become part of the DTP, is
already used in Japan, he said.
   The infectious disease committee of the pediatrics academy
recently urged the FDA to approve the vaccine, but only for the
booster shots given after age 1, Plotkin said. Experts disagree on
whether it works as well as the standard version when administered
before that age, he said.
   The DTP vaccine is recommended at 2 months, 4 months and 6
months, with boosters at either 15 months or 18 months, and again
before entering school at ages 4 to 6 years.
   The current DTP vaccine has been dogged by concerns that its
whooping cough component can cause brain damage, including mental
retardation and movement difficulties.
   That is ``a highly controversial area,'' Plotkin said. ``My
opinion is that there is no solid evidence that it causes brain
damage.''
   In any case, the Lederle spokesman said, it is too soon to tell
whether the new vaccine would affect rates of brain damage alleged
to result from the current vaccine.

   NEW YORK -- Burroughs Wellcome Co. said the Food and Drug
Administration approved its Zovirax brand of acyclovir for
treatment of chicken pox.
   Zovirax represents the first oral antiviral therapy to
receive FDA approval for treating the disease. Chicken pox is
generally not dangerous in otherwise healthy patients, but
it's one of the most common infectious diseases in children,
affecting about 3.5 million Americans each year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Zovirax, which was first approved in 1982 for the
treatment of genital herpes, had U.S. sales of $299 million
last year. The drug is also used to treat shingles and a type
of encephalitis. Chicken pox is caused by the
varicella-zoster virus, a member of the herpes family of
viruses. Although the new application could significantly
expand the market for Zovirax, doctors expect that acceptance
of a new chicken-pox treatment will be gradual, in part for
economic reasons.
   Burroughs Wellcome, a unit of London-based Wellcome
Foundation Ltd., said studies show Zovirax reduces the
severity and duration of chicken pox by preventing the virus
from replicating. Current remedies for chicken pox treat only
its symptoms, which include fever and a rash that changes
from red blotches into tiny blisters.
   In one study of 815 patients between the ages of 2 and 12,
researchers found that patients receiving Zovirax within 24
hours of being diagnosed had fewer chicken pox lesions, less
itching and earlier evidence of healing. Children treated
with Zovirax began to feel better sooner than those receiving
a placebo. The study found Zovirax also reduced the
proportion of patients with fever.
   Results were similar in a separate study of 68 adolescent
patients with chicken pox. Patients 13 to 18 years old were
treated within 24 hours of developing the rash with 800
milligrams of Zovirax four times daily for five days.
Researchers concluded that patients treated with the drug
recovered faster and had lower fevers and fewer residual
lesions.
   Henry H. Balfour Jr., a physician at the University of
Minnesota Health Sciences Center who studied the drug, said
Zovirax appears especially useful in treating those under 18
who contract more severe forms of the disease. Adolescents
and those who catch it from siblings tend to be sicker than
other patients. "I don't yet recommend treating every kid
with the drug," Dr. Balfour said. "But the harm would be
mostly economic; it's very safe."
   The company said the cost of a course of therapy will be
$30 to $55, depending on the weight of the child. The oral
formulations of the drug are a banana-flavored liquid, a 200
milligram capsule and an 800 milligram tablet. The
recommended dosage for children ages 2 to 12 is 20 milligrams
per kilogram of body weight four times daily for five days.
Recommended dosage for adolescents is 800 milligrams.
   The most frequent side effects reported from treating
chicken pox with Zovirax were diarrhea, abdominal pain, rash
and vomiting, which are consistent with adverse reactions
found in studies of the drug in other applications. Therapy
with Zovirax did not affect antibody response to the virus,
according to the studies.

YOUR BODY: NO RUSH TO USE CHICKEN POX DRUG

Acyclovir, an anti-viral drug used to treat genital herpes, can also shorten 
the duration and misery of childhood chicken pox, suggests a study published 
last week. But parents eager to get their children up and about may be in for a 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
In a random survey, Los Angeles area pediatricians said they are not likely to 
prescribe acyclovir routinely for chicken pox, an infectious viral disease 
marked by fever and blisters that strikes nearly everyone during childhood and 
lasts about five days. Doctors say the study, published in this month's Journal 
of Pediatrics, involves far too few children to warrant an across-the-board 
change in treatment -- at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
In the study, Dr. Henry Balfour, of the University of Minnesota, and his 
colleagues gave oral acyclovir to 50 children with chicken pox. Another 52 
children received placebos. Those taking acyclovir were sick about a day less, 
recovered from fevers more quickly and had fewer lesions. Reducing the course 
of the disease is not just a matter of convenience, experts say. It might 
reduce the likelihood of complications, which can include brain infections on 
rare occasions. 
</P>
<P>
Oral acyclovir will be available in pharmacies by May, said Kathy Bartlett, a 
spokeswoman for Burroughs Wellcome, which manufactures the drug. But it may sit 
a while on Los Angeles pharmacy shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Wilbert Mason, a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases at Childrens 
Hospital of Los Angeles and USC professor of clinical pediatrics, said the 
study won't affect his treatment of chicken pox. "It's a very preliminary 
study. It includes a very small number of patients. We need more substantial 
experience to consider a massive change in treatment." 
</P>
<P>
"I would not prescribe acyclovir except perhaps for an infant," said Dr. Elmer 
Crehan, a pediatrician on staff at Hospital of the Good Samaritan and Childrens 
Hospital of Los Angeles. "I look at this study with interest," said Dr. Loraine 
Stern, a Newhall pediatrician. "But I don't think it should (yet) change 
treatment. I'd put my money on a chicken pox vaccine." 
</P>
<P>
A chicken pox vaccine developed by Merck Sharp Dohme is now under review by the 
Food and Drug Administration, said Faye Peterson, FDA spokeswoman. The vaccine 
-- a live, weakened chicken pox virus -- works by creating an antibody 
response, thus protecting children from getting the disease once they are 
exposed, said Gary Bruell, a spokesman for the West Point, Pa., manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
But the FD questions whether the vaccine, called Varivax, would confer lifelong 
immunity, said Peterson, which is importantbecause chicken pox can be much more 
serious if contracted in adulthood.

Tapping Into the Value of Self-Help Audio, Video Tapes 
</P>
<P>
What's your next goal? To stop smoking? Lose weight? Boost self-esteem? Improve 
your memory? Enhance your sex life? 
</P>
<P>
Audio and video tapes with subliminal messages -- subconscious-level 
suggestions -- are just the ticket, proponents claim. Opponents say the tapes, 
widely available through mail order and bookstores, are long on promises and 
short on scientific claims. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the opinions of two researchers studying the effects of subliminal 
message tapes. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Greenwald, professor of psychology, University of Washington, Seattle 
</P>
<P>
 "These tapes have not yet been demonstrated to be effective. The way to 
determine whether these work or not is to conduct a double-blind study, tests 
in which neither the subjects nor the researchers know whether subjects are 
listening to tapes with or without subliminal messages. Next, pre-tests and 
post tests must be done to determine if the target goal -- losing weight, 
stopping cigarette smoking, improving memory -- has been achieved. Basically, 
this research has not been done nor reported in journals. I am in the midst of 
a series of double-blind studies, which has not yet yielded evidence of the 
subliminal tapes' effectiveness. Let the buyer beware. People who buy these 
tapes risk losing their time and their money." 
</P>
<P>
Irene S. Vogel, psychologist, Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not convinced that the audio subliminal message tapes work, but I think 
the video subliminal message tapes might. I recommend the video subliminal 
message tapes for clients trying to lose weight. People say they notice a 
difference. These tapes project messages on the TV screen. While watching 'The 
Simpsons,' for instance, consumers can also view a self-esteem program that 
tells them, 'I'm worthwhile.' The results are preliminary, but the impressions 
we are getting are favorable."

<TEXT>     Results of the study released today show that acyclovir worked, making it
the first treatment that can reduce the number of chicken pox sores, relieve
itching and generally get children feeling healthy more quickly.;   Virtually
everyone gets chicken pox before adulthood, and about 4 million U.S. children
annually suffer the viral rite of passage.;   Until now, there has been no
effective treatment. While other medicines are sometimes given to relieve the
symptoms of chicken pox, acyclovir is the first to make the disease go away
more quickly.;   The treatment caused no side effects, the researchers said.; 
 "We would not say that every child needs to be treated with this drug for
this infection," said Dr. Ann Arvin of Stanford University, one of the
researchers. "But it is clear that the drug does benefit children.";   The
biggest drawbacks to treatment are probably time and money. The medicine is
worthless unless given to youngsters within 24 hours of an outbreak of chicken
pox.;   Treatment costs $32, and the total expense at least doubles if parents
must also pay for a doctor's visit to get the prescription.;   Still, beyond
the obvious benefit of alleviating a child's discomfort, the cost might be
worth it to parents who are losing time from work while staying home with sick
offspring.;   The study was directed at St. Louis University by Dr. Lisa M.
Dunkle, now a researcher at Bristol-Myers Squibb, a drug company. Stanford was
one of 10 institutions participating. The study appears in today's New England
Journal of Medicine.;   The research was financed by Burroughs Wellcome, which
makes acyclovir. Acyclovir is also used to fight the virus that causes AIDS.; 
 On Nov. 12, an advisory committee to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
recommended that the drug be formally approved for use in children with
chicken pox.;   The study was conducted on 815 young chicken pox sufferers who
took either acyclovir or placebos.;   Researchers like Stanford's Dr. Mark
Winsberg visited sick children at their homes to administer the treatments and
track the progress of their illnesses. Winsberg counted and circled each
chicken-pox spot on each child, using different colors of pens every day.;  
Among the study's conclusions:;   (check) The acyclovir patients uniformly got
better within three or four days. While many of the untreated youngsters also
recovered this fast, about 20 percent were still sick after six days.;  
(check) The benefits of the treatment were apparent within a day as the
children's fevers eased more quickly.;   (check) The acyclovir children got no
new red spots after their third day, while untreated youngsters sometimes
continued to get new spots for several days.;   (check) The treated
youngsters' sores healed faster, and they suffered considerably less itching.;
  Children get chicken pox, also called the Varicella-Zoster virus, simply by
breathing the air near someone who has the disease, or by direct contact.;  
By the time skin lesions and fever appear, the virus has been multiplying
inside the body for about two weeks.;   The bumps begin to disappear after
four days or so, because the body creates antibodies that prevent the virus
from replicating, Winsberg said. Those antibodies remain in the white blood
cells, which is why chicken pox is a one-time-only disease. Chicken pox is
rarely fatal.;   Researchers believe that acyclovir may hinder the virus from
replicating while doing no other damage to the body.  </TEXT>

US REVENUES generated by Zovirax, the world's best-selling anti-viral drug
marketed by Wellcome, the UK pharmaceutical group, could be far higher than
analysts' predictions, according to a leading American virologist.
Dr Richard Whitely, Professor of Paediatrics and Clinical Virology at the
University of Alabama, believes Zovirax will be used by as many as 1m
chicken pox patients over the next 12 months and by as many as 3m a year as
early as 1996.
Previous estimates of Zovirax sales for this illness have been far lower. In
a recent note, SG Warburg, the company's brokers, estimated only 20 per cent
of US patients would use the drug by 1994, generating additional revenues of
only Pounds 15m.
Zovirax, which is used mainly to treat herpes and related infections, was
only licensed in the US for chicken pox early this year.
Between 3.4m and 4m US residents catch the disease annually.
Speaking at a virology conference in Berlin, Dr Whitely said he believed
general practitioners would come under intense pressure form Paris to
prescribe Zovirax for children infected with chicken pox.
Public awareness of the drug's benefits were well known, he said. If
administered within 24 hours of the first signs of chicken pox, the drug can
reduce the number of lesions and the severity of the disease.
Dr Whitely added that doctors may well prescribe Zovirax, which cost between
Dollars 30 and Dollars 55 for a five day treatment, for fear of potential
litigation.
Chicken pox can lead to serious complications in a small minority of cases
and the drug may be able to prevent the disease or lessen its severity.
He warned that the drug's high cost and the problems of quick diagnosis
would prevent all patients receiving Zovirax.

FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: 20% of Wellcome equity expected to be held
in US after Jluy flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADVISERS TO Wellcome, the UK pharmaceuticals group, expect as much as a
fifth of its equity will be held in North America after July's flotation of
up to 50 per cent of its stock.
The company is applying for a 'big board' listing on the New York Stock
Exchange to encourage US investors. Both Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham have
such listings. Their US shareholdings are 27 per cent and 35 per cent
respectively.
The proportion at Wellcome, which is only on the pink sheet and is not
quoted live, is only 2 per cent.
Wellcome is preparing a series of roadshows in Europe and the US, and
possibly the Far East to generate interest in the flotation. The company
believes that after the offer about 5 per cent of the stock will be held in
the Far East and about 5 per cent on the Continent.
Last month Wellcome Trust, the charitable body which owns 73.6 per cent of
Wellcome, was given permission by the Charity Commission to sell up to 417m
shares, reducing its holding in the company to as little as 25 per cent.
The issue could raise more than Pounds 4bn.
Meanwhile, the company announced yesterday it has set up a co-marketing
agreement with Wyeth-Ayerst, a subsidiary of American Home Products, to
promote Zovirax in the US for the treatment of chicken pox.
The move is part of Wellcome's strategy of supplementing its own sales
forces though co-marketing agreements to exploit its marketing weakness. It
has already set up agreements to market Zovirax with Hoechst in Germany,
Sigma Tau in Italy and Sumitomo in Japan.
Wyeth-Ayerst will be responsible for selling the drug directly to
paediatricians, while Wellcome's American subsidiary, Burroughs Wellcome,
will focus on other primary care physicians. Burroughs Wellcome has about
780 sales representatives.
About 3.4m people contract chicken pox in the US each year. Before the
agreement, SG Warburg, the company's broker, estimated additional sales of
Zovirax for chicken pox would be about Pounds 15m by 1994. This assumed 20
per cent of patients would use the drug which costs between Dollars 35 and
Dollars 50 per treatment.
Merck of the US has developed a chicken pox vaccine, but it has not yet been
licenced.
Glaxo, the UK drugs giant, yesterday opened a Pounds 16m research and
development centre at the Madrid high technology park north of the Spanish
capital. The centre will be staffed initially by 75 scientists and
technicians and will eventually have 200.

<TEXT>
   Reye syndrome, a potentially fatal disease
associated with aspirin in childhood flu and chicken pox cases, has
reached the lowest reported level since its discovery _ just 20
U.S. cases last year, officials said Thursday.
   At its peak in 1980, Reye syndrome struck 555 people. The
disease struck 101 Americans in 1986 _ the year in which aspirin
containers were first required to carry warnings about it.
   Since then, Reye syndrome reporting dropped to 36 cases in 1987
and 20 in 1988, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control reported.
   Reye syndrome, first observed in the 1950s, causes symptoms
including severe vomiting and lethargy, and can result in coma and
even death. It usually occurs in children and is usually preceded
by a bout with a viral illness such as influenza or chicken pox.
   Researchers have documented a link between the use of aspirin by
young patients during chicken pox or flu and the subsequent
development of Reye syndrome.
   ``The decline in the number of RS cases since late 1980
coincides with the increased publicity about this association,''
the Atlanta-based CDC said.
   ``That is the reason,'' concluded Dr. Larry Schonberger, a CDC
researcher. ``Study after study shows aspirin is the primary cause
of Reye syndrome. ... CDC's been pushing this since 1980.''
   The 1988 count is the lowest since national surveillance of Reye
cases began in 1976, the CDC said.
   Nine of the 20 reported Reye syndrome patients in 1988 had
suffered respiratory illness such as flu before the onset of Reye;
four had chicken pox. The previous year, 18 of the 36 patients had
respiratory illnesses, and seven had chicken pox.
   In 1988, as in 1987, most cases occurred in January, February or
March, the peak months for flu or chicken pox cases.

<HEAD>Girl Loses Arms, Legs From Rare Toxic Shock Bacteria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 6-year-old girl's arms and legs were
amputated after a rare form of toxic shock bacteria infected
chicken pox lesions on her body, doctors said.
   ``This is exceedingly rare,'' said Dr. John Bradley, director of
the division of infectious disease at Children's Hospital.
   He said he knew of no documented case of this strain of bacteria
infecting children, although there have been dozens of cases
involving adults and it is fatal about 30 percent of the time.
   Jessica Lynn Esquivel was admitted to the hospital April 1 with
what was believed to be a routine case of chicken pox. But a
toxin-producing streptococcal bacteria infected the lesions on her
body caused by the chicken pox and spread to the other parts of her
body.
   The onset of toxic shock caused what Bradley termed ``full
cardiac arrest,'' in addition to kidney, liver and respiratory
failure, before infusions of penicillin began to reduce the effects
of the bacteria.
   Because the illness had obstructed circulation to her limbs,
doctors severed Jessica's legs at the knee and her arms at the
elbow on April 18, Bradley said Wednesday.
   Jessica had been in critical condition after the surgery, but
was upgraded to serious this morning, said hospital spokeswoman
Sharon Ross.
   ``With what we know about this toxin-producing strain of strep,
the shock that we saw here at the hospital was an extremely
difficult one to reverse,'' Bradley said.
   He said he doubted that Jessica's condition could have been
prevented because there is no vaccine for chicken pox and because
of the rarity of the bacteria.
   He said the child would not have incurred the bacteria without
first having had the chicken pox, but that streptococcus infections
as an adjunct to chicken pox are common.
   Dr. Brad Peterson, who treated Jessica, said the girl suffered
damage to her vital organs but they are ```100 percent'' better now.
   Jessica, who had been in an artificial respirator until this
week, is now able to speak. Peterson said the loss of her arms and
legs have been explained to her and that a psychiatrist has been
made available.
   Ms. Ross said a trust fund has been established to help pay for
the child's long-term recovery.
   Lisa Esquivel, 25, said she and her husband, Felix, 27, the
girl's parents, are devastated by the turn of events.
   ``Now my daughter doesn't have hands or feet ... and it's
hard,'' said Felix Esquivel.

<TEXT>
   Reye's syndrome cases have fallen dramatically in
nine years as a result of warnings about the links between aspirin
and the childhood disease, federal health researchers say.
   Just 20 cases of Reye's syndrome were reported in 1988, the
national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday. At its peak
in 1980, Reye's syndrome afflicted 555 people.
   The 1988 count is the lowest since national surveillance of
Reye's cases was begun in 1976, the CDC said.
   The disease struck 101 Americans in 1986, the year in which
aspirin containers were first required to carry warnings about it.
Only 36 cases were reported in 1987, the CDC said.
   The ailment, first observed in the 1950s, causes severe vomiting
and lethargy and can result in coma and death. It usually occurs in
children and is generally preceded by a bout with a viral illness
such as influenza or chicken pox.
   Researchers have documented a link between the use of aspirin by

   ``Study after study shows aspirin is the primary cause of Reye's

termed the 1988 count ``shockingly low'' compared with previous
levels.
   At least 10 of the 36 patients in 1987 died. In 1988, five of 17
patients for whom the outcome is known died.
   Nine of the 20 reported Reye's syndrome patients in 1988 had
suffered respiratory illness such as flu before the onset of the
Reye's; four had chicken pox. The previous year, 18 of the 36
patients had respiratory illnesses, and seven had chicken pox.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration said Monday
it has published a final regulation requiring a permanent and
stronger warning label against giving aspirin to children and
teen-agers with chicken pox or flu because of the danger of Reye
syndrome.
   The new warning, a modification of one already required on
aspirin and aspirin-containing drugs, says: ``WARNING: Children and
teen-agers should not use this medicine for chicken pox or flu
symptoms before a doctor is consulted about Reye syndrome, a rare
but serious illness reported to be associated with aspirin.''
   The new part of the warning is the last phrase: ``reported to be
associated with aspirin.''
   The stronger warning is based on a Public Health Service study
that found a significant association between Reye syndrome and
taking aspirin during chicken pox or flu, the FDA said.
   For one year, aspirin and aspirin products must display an
attention-getting device, such as a flag on the label, alerting
consumers to the new and stronger Reye syndrome warning.
   The new warning and attention-getting statement will be required
on aspirin products sold after Dec. 9, 1988. Until then, the
current warnings may be used.
   Although rare, Reye syndrome is fatal in 20 percent to 30
percent of cases, and some survivors suffer permanent brain damage.
Its symptoms _ severe tiredness, belligerence and excessive
vomiting _ may occur just as a child or teen-ager appears to be
recovering from flu or chicken pox.

   White House officials showed off the renovated historic house on

   ``It is not too grand, but it has elegance,'' said Chief of

   She said the $13 million renovation isn't quite complete and

   General Nutrition Corp., the national health

it made false claims for diet supplements.
   Under terms of the agreement announced Monday by the Federal
Trade Commission, GNC agreed to the payment to be divided equally
among the American Diabetes Association, American Cancer Society
and American Heart Association.
   The agreement settles charges brought in 1984 that GNC falsely
claimed its Healthy Greens diet supplement helped reduce the risk
of cancer, and that other food supplements would promote weight
loss, help muscle growth and retard aging, according to the trade
commission.
   GNC, based in Pittsburgh, operates some 1,100 stores across the

DEATH OF 5-YEAR-OLD UNDER INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES and DAVID REYES, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fullerton police and Orange County social services officials are investigating 
the death of a 5-year-old girl whose immigrant parents knew she was seriously 
ill with chicken pox but did not seek medical care because they had no money, 
didn't speak English and didn't know where to go. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy has ruled out any obvious trauma to the body of Sandra Navarrete, 
but toxicological tests to pinpoint the exact cause of death may take 6 to 12 
weeks, Fullerton Police Sgt. Don Kimbro said. 
</P>
<P>
If the tests show that Sandra died of complications from chicken pox, "now 
we're in that gray area where someone has to determine whether a child can die 
of chicken pox in this day and age," Kimbro said. 
</P>
<P>
"If Mom and Dad did do what a reasonable person should do, it's a tragic 
circumstance. The other side is if . . . the people just allowed this to 
happen, you're looking at negligence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Florencia Navarrete, 33, a recent immigrant from Michoacan, Mexico, said Monday 
that she and her husband, Emilio, also 33, did not seek any medical help after 
their daughter became ill March 22 and steadily grew worse. 
</P>
<P>
Since Sandra's death March 28, Florencia Navarrete has received telephone 
numbers and addresses of clinics in her neighborhood that offer free medical 
help. "Now we have them, " Navarrete said, "but when she was sick, we didn't 
have any. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know. I speak only Spanish and we didn't know how to get one. I 
didn't know how to speak English." 
</P>
<P>
Navarrete said she did not know about the 911 emergency telephone line. She 
also said she didn't know she could go to any hospital and receive emergency 
medical care. And she said she didn't look for a hospital or clinic because "we 
didn't have enough money to get to a clinic. We knew there were many in 
Fullerton (but) we didn't have any money." 
</P>
<P>
Emilio Navarrete has supported his wife and four children with earnings of $740 
a month from his job as a dishwasher at a Fullerton restaurant, Navarrete said. 
The family shares a two-bedroom, $625-a-month apartment with another woman and 
her 9-month-old child. 
</P>
<P>
Sobbing as she recounted the events of last week, Florencia Navarrete said she 
knew that her daughter was very sick and that her temperature was high but that 
she did not have a thermometer in the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Day-to-Day Thing' 
</P>
<P>
"She was very, very hot, but sometimes it (the fever) would go down. It (the 
sickness) was a day-to-day thing. That's how it was for us, day by day." 
</P>
<P>
During her illness, Sandra cried often, Navarrete said. "She kept saying, 
'Mommy, Mommy,' every time she would see me." She was crying "Mommy" when she 
died in Navarrete's brother's car on the way to a hospital in Long Beach, 
Navarrete said. 
</P>
<P>
By now, all the Navarrete children have contracted chicken pox. Eight-year-old 
Areli got a mild case of the disease in February, and Emilio, 7, and Carolina, 
10 months, came down with the disease on the day Sandra died. All are well now, 
Navarrete said. 
</P>
<P>
Medical experts described chicken pox as a highly communicable but generally 
mild childhood disease that rarely results in death. But county public health 
director L. Rex Ehling, a pediatrician, said that an occasional complication of 
chicken pox is encephalitis and that "it can cause death, obviously." 
</P>
<P>
Ehling said that he did not know what caused Sandra's death but added that he 
has been advised that the Navarrete family had visited one of Orange County's 
immunization clinics and that Florencia Navarrete had once visited a county 
family planning clinic. Dr. Gary Wagner, pediatrician in charge of the county's 
immunization clinics, declined to provide a date or purpose for the family's 
visit, citing confidentiality rules. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Fullerton police probe, Sgt. Kimbro said, the Orange County 
Social Services Agency is investigating the child's death for negligence. 
Social Services officials declined to confirm whether such an investigation is 
under way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Very, Very Nice Family' 
</P>
<P>
Some of those who knew the Navarretes described them as caring parents who 
simply did not understand how to get medical care for their child. 
</P>
<P>
Said a spokesman from the Mexican Consulate in Santa Ana who helped the family 
after Sandra's death: "I don't think there's any negligence or child abuse. 
It's a matter of a different culture. It is a matter of a person who doesn't 
speak the language, from a little town." 
</P>
<P>
At Richman Elementary School, where Sandra attended kindergarten, Principal 
Maynard Duncan described the Navarretes as "a very, very nice family -- 
concerned about the children." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that when a child was ill, Florencia Navarrete would come by the 
school to pick up homework. 
</P>
<P>
She was "a very responsible mother" who also visited the school the day before 
her daughter died to inform a clerk that Sandra had chicken pox, Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
"That was just a normal thing . . . so we were not alarmed. We sent home 
chicken pox notices. 'Your child has been exposed to chicken pox.' We had no 
indication that the child was that ill," Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that he did not think that the parents were negligent but rather 
uninformed about where to turn for help. 
</P>
<P>
To remedy that for the Navarretes and other families uncertain where to turn, 
Duncan said the school would soon send out a list "of names and places where 
families can take children in cases of emergency," as well as basic first- aid 
measures parents can take to lower a child's fever. 
</P>
<P>
The school of 720 students located in southwest Fullerton is 55% Latino, 18.5% 
Anglo and 13% Asian. 
</P>
<P>
And like the Navarretes, "quite a few" of the students speak limited English 
and are new to the United States, Duncan said.

   The government said Wednesday it will close a

   The 12-story San Yick refugee center, where 691 people have

   The outbreak of chicken pox began in October, two months after
the facility opened.
   The government opened the facility to accomodate the large number
of Vietnamese who have fled to this British colony from their
communist homeland.

BIRD VACCINES HAILED BY VETS AS A MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH

<P>
The first vaccines designed to shield exotic pet birds from two fatal viruses 
went on the market last week, with veterinarians hailing them as representing a 
breakthrough in avian medicine akin to the human polio inoculation. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, there was no immunization for exotic birds, even though the viruses 
responsible for Pacheco's disease and Psittacine pox kill thousands of 
parakeets, parrots, macaws and related species each year, leaving thousands of 
pet owners heartsick. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Medical Breakthrough' 
</P>
<P>
Avian veterinarian Larry Nemetz, a bird specialist whose Santa Ana clinic was 
among the first to use the vaccines this week, described them as "a medical 
breakthrough in the bird market." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the first recipient at Nemetz's clinic was a scarlet macaw named 
Alfalfa. 
</P>
<P>
The large bird sidled to the far edge of the examining table, but Nemetz was 
too quick. Deftly, he swaddled the bird in an orange towel, stroked its head 
and plunged first one hypodermic into a feathered breast, then another. 
</P>
<P>
Alfalfa screeched. But it was over quickly, as Nemetz released the immunized 
bird to owner Patti Brittain. 
</P>
<P>
"Poor baby," Brittain cooed. "I'm sorry." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One of First in Nation 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Alfalfa was lucky: It was one of the first pet birds in the country 
to be vaccinated against Pacheco's and pox. 
</P>
<P>
A New England firm, Maine Biologic Laboratories, has had Department of 
Agriculture approval since last winter to market the vaccines, but the company 
-- accustomed to developing drugs for chickens and turkeys but not exotic birds 
-- only recently asked a veterinary business to distribute them. 
</P>
<P>
That firm, California Avian Laboratory, made its initial shipments of vaccine 
last week. And Nemetz, who runs the Bird In-House Rehabilitation and Diagnostic 
Clinic in Santa Ana, was among the first to receive it. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Walter Rosskopf, an avian veterinarian from Fountain Valley, also ordered 
the vaccines. "We've been waiting for his kind of thing for years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There have long been immunizations for poultry as well as vaccines for dogs and 
cats -- but none for pet birds, noted Dr. Susan Wells, a zoo veterinarian in 
New Orleans who is president of the 2,000-member Assn. of Avian Veterinarians. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, she said, manufacturers have not considered the bird market a 
lucrative one. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2.5 Birds Per Home 
</P>
<P>
But recently that has changed. A 1987 survey by the American Veterinary Medical 
Assn. estimated that 5 million U.S. households have pet birds, with an average 
of 2.5 birds in those homes. 
</P>
<P>
Avian vets say those figures vastly understate the count. "A lot of us believe 
there are 50 million pet birds," many of them in Southern California, said Dr. 
Alan M. Fudge, president of California Avian Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Fudge and other doctors said the vaccines mark a new era in avian medicine. 
They could prevent outbreaks of pox and Pacheco's when imported birds are in 
quarantine or in pet stores, and the vaccines offer some assurance to bird 
owners that their pets will stay healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at Maine Biologic worked on vaccines for poultry for 32 years but 
ventured into exotic birds just two years ago at the request of importers, said 
Dr. Kenneth Eslen, the company's president. In a normal shipment of 500 
blue-front Amazon parrots that might retail for $1,000 apiece, "it's not 
unusual to lose 30% to 50%" to pox in the quarantine pens, Eslen said. 
</P>
<P>
But the vaccines, made up of dead virus cells, finally offer protection, Eslen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacheco's, named after the Brazilian veterinarian who discovered it in the 
1930s, is a highly contagious disease caused by a herpes virus that destroys 
the liver. 
</P>
<P>
It moves so rapidly that often there are few symptoms -- ruffled feathers or 
yellow droppings. But sometimes, Nemetz said, "The bird says 'Good morning,' 
falls off the perch and dies." 
</P>
<P>
The disease can sometimes be treated with the drug cyclovir, which is also used 
to treat human herpes, Rosskopf said, "but it's so devastating that by the time 
you figure out they have it, they're dead." 
</P>
<P>
Usually, he said, he diagnoses it after death. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Psittacine pox -- which affects birds in the parrot family -- is 
characterized by lesions around the eyes, but these can spread to the throat 
and internal organs, causing death. 
</P>
<P>
"When it gets into an air pipe, the bird just suffocates," Nemetz said. "There 
is no cure. The vet just says, 'I'm sorry. This is the disease.' " 
</P>
<P>
But now, Nemetz and other avian veterinarians said, they can practice 
preventive medicine. Nemetz has telephoned some bird owners, letting them know 
about the vaccines, which he offers at about $18 for both shots. Each vaccine 
also requires a follow-up shot within eight weeks and an annual booster. 
</P>
<P>
Nemetz has also told pet store owners that he will inoculate their birds and 
give them a certificate of vaccination that the birds' new owners can have. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the reaction has been positive. Shelly Pollin, owner of Bird and Board, 
a store in Orange, said she will be vaccinating all her birds and, starting 
early next year, will demand that owners of all boarded birds show proof of 
vaccination. 
</P>
<P>
The new vaccines "are a relief," she said: "I have no experience with Pacheco's 
or pox -- luckily. But I know of people who have. It can be very deadly. It can 
spread quickly," wiping out a dealer's entire stock. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at Nemetz's clinic, he vaccinated Alfalfa's companions, a 
green-winged macaw named Buckwheat and a blue-and-gold macaw named Sparky. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nibbled Her Ear 
</P>
<P>
After the injections, they ruffled their feathers, strutted a bit on the 
examining table, then hopped over to Brittain to perch on her shoulder and 
nibble her ear. 
</P>
<P>
Brittain said she doubts that she will get another bird, so her three macaws 
will probably not be exposed to disease that way. 
</P>
<P>
But, she noted, her family often takes the birds to the beach, and she would 
not want to risk their health. 
</P>
<P>
The birds are like her children, Brittain said. "And I'm an overanxious mother. 
I wouldn't want to take a chance. . . . Like with children, the minute there's 
something new, I want it. I want the best."

FT  18 JUN 92 / Technology: Wellcome's cures for despair - In the run-up to
the drug company's share offer, FT writers look at its Aids and herpes
treatments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
REMEMBER herpes? In the early 1980s a herpes epidemic, carried on a tide of
sexual promiscuity, appeared to be sweeping through the west. Then along
came Aids. Herpes sank from public view.
The disease is still incurable and its incidence is still growing. Up to 40
per cent of US citizens have recurrent cold sores caused by the herpes
virus. As for genital herpes, an estimated 20m US citizens are infected.
Paradoxically, herpes has become even more significant since the discovery
of HIV. Clinicians believe that individuals with lesions caused by herpes
transmit the HIV virus more easily. Effective treatment of herpes may
therefore help prevent the spread of HIV. In addition, Aids patients become
highly vulnerable to viruses of the herpes family, which can prove fatal.
Analysts at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK brokers, estimate that the world
market for anti-herpes drugs increased from Dollars 35m (Pounds 19.2m) in
1981 to Dollars 1bn last year. Wellcome, the leading anti-viral drug
company, has about 70 per cent of this market. Its best-selling drug is
Zovirax, which last year generated sales of Pounds 471m.
Zovirax is a guanine nucleoside analogue which is inert and non-toxic to
normal cells. However, when the drug enters a cell containing the herpes
virus it reacts with an enzyme created by the virus to become a
triphosphate. Once converted, the triphosphate interacts with the virus' DNA
structure and stops the virus replicating.
The mechanism is similar to the effect of AZT on HIV. Zovirax cannot
eliminate the herpes but by preventing the virus multiplying it reduces the
effects and length of herpes attacks.
Since the drug was first licensed in 1981, Zovirax has been used to prevent
the herpes recurring. A recent five-year study demonstrated that patients
with recurrent genital herpes treated with Zovirax were seven times less
likely to have another attack.
The drug has also been licensed for herpes-related diseases. One is
cytomegalovirus (CMV); another is varicella zoster which causes chicken-pox
and shingles.
Much of the sales growth of Zovirax is likely to come from the treatment of
shingles, which often affects the elderly. About four people per 1,000 over
65 years old contract shingles. Zovirax only received a US licence for
shingles in 1991 so Wellcome has just started to exploit the market.
However, because the zoster virus is less susceptible to Zovirax than herpes
itself, the dosing needs to be at least four times greater. BZW estimates
sales for shingles alone will be worth Pounds 100m over the next two years.
The medicine is also being used for transplant patients infected with CMV or
shingles. About 31,400 people received transplants in the US last year and
the number is growing by between 12 and 15 per cent a year.
Transplant patients are given immunosuppressants to prevent their immune
systems rejecting the organ. But an additional effect is to make the
patients highly vulnerable to herpes-related diseases. Myron Levin of the
University of Colorado estimates about 40 per cent of bone marrow patients
have zoster and about 75 per cent CMV. Both diseases are capable of killing
the patients.
Hoare Govett, the UK brokers, estimates that increasing use of Zovirax for
herpes, transplant and Aids patients will allow sales to increase from
Pounds 471m last year to Pounds 875m by 1994.
Competition to Zovirax at present is limited. Any new drugs will need to
demonstrate they are safer, more effective, or more powerful and so need
less frequent doses.
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American group, is developing two compounds,
Famcyclovir and Penciclovir. Both are better absorbed than Zovirax and work
longer.
Meanwhile, Wellcome is developing two compounds, known as 256U87 and 882U87.
At a recent conference in Berlin on herpes, clinicians were told that 256
was absorbed into the body three to four times more readily than Zovirax,
the existing treatment. The drug is in late clinical trials.
Meanwhile, 882 has been shown to be highly effective against CMV. The drug
is in earlier clinical trials to determine the right dosing.
Wellcome hopes to have both 256 and 882 on the market during the mid-1990s.
In the meantime, human behaviour being what it is, demand for its viral
products will continue to increase unabated.

   Only 12 jurors remained Thursday to deliberate
the McMartin preschool molestation trial after a juror was
hospitalized with a rare blood ailment, the judge said Thursday.
   Superior Court Judge William Pounders said he was ``shaken''
after conferring with the juror and his doctor.
   ``If he was asked to continue (to serve in the trial), the next
six weeks is a critical period and might cause his death,'' Pounders
said.
   Although the unspecified blood disease is not contagious,
Pounders said that the juror has a secondary illness of shingles _ a
contagious variant of the chicken pox virus.
   Pounders said it won't be known until next week whether other
jurors have been infected. ``Even though we may have the jurors
coming down with chicken pox, that's at least manageable if not
desirable,'' the judge said.
   He said he would formally excuse the ailing juror on Monday when
the other panelists return to court.
   The juror's dismissal will pare the remaining panel to just 12
with no alternates available. The loss of one more juror could force
a mistrial in the case of Raymond Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy
McMartin Buckey, 62.
   They are charged with 64 counts of molestation in what has become
the nation's longest and possibly costliest criminal trial. Expenses
have topped $15 million.

<F P=106> [Article by Boris Kippel: ``Chicken-Pox Behind Barbed Wire''] </F>
  [Text] The reader will of course be amazed: What sort 
of medical phenomenon is this, has a classical children's 
disease really grown older. No, the problem is not the aging of 
nursery-school chicken-pox, but that the ``contingent behind 
barbed wire'' has gotten younger. This didn't happen overnight, 
by the way. It was not just yesterday that the juvenile 
detention and distribution centers were created, where police 
stand guard over youngsters from 3 to 18 years old behind high 
walls and barbed wire. This is simply the sign of our troubled, 
unhappy times, when gunfire is heard on your own street, when 
your father is taken hostage, when a youngster is tempted with 
lots of money, and an 8-year-old girl is made to lie down for 
sex--these days, life is increasingly more strained in juvenile 
detention centers, and the stories of their lodgers are becoming 
ever more bitter. 
  In the one I visited, young Muscovites, their neighbors from 
the capital's oblast, and youngsters from adjacent countries are 
serving their standard 30-day sentences. Up to 50 young 
runaways, criminals and prostitutes are delivered daily. Here 
they undergo a unique kind of sorting: Some are returned home, 
while others are sent to correction facilities when their guilt 
is established. 
  What typifies this unfortunate contingent today? First of 
all, its rising numbers. In previous years the number brought in 
daily was half of what it is now. If the flow doesn't lessen, 
the center workers assert that it will be impossible to deal 
with it. All the more so because the children's collective has 
to undergo quarantine. There are those with chicken-pox, as 
mentioned above, those with German measles, and those with 
hepatitis. No quarantine is imposed here on venereal diseases. 
Practically one out of every two young boys or girls has 
gonorrhea. They ``love'' this disease, and they try to catch it 
on purpose, so that while en route to the venereal disease 
hospital many of them could escape from the ambulances. They 
also flee from the hospital--it isn't kept under guard, after 
all. 
  Who are these children, these inhabitants of the juvenile 
detention center, these unfortunate youngsters, our hope for the 
future, lousy and plagued by scabies, brought in from train 
stations, and caught in basements and attics? 
  The main group, from 7 to 11 years of age, consists of 
``travelers.'' There are children from 3 to 18 years of age who 
have left home for various reasons. An unsettled home life, 
perpetual drunkenness of parents, and now more rarely a child's 
longing to see the world, compel the children to abandon the 
hearth and set off on a distant journey of tens and even 
hundreds of kilometers, without money or clothing. They travel 
chiefly in trains, on baggage shelves or in vestibules. As they 
travel their long road, people give them food and money. But 
when all of this ends, they begin to steal. In train stations 
the guests to the capital come together into juvenile gangs, 
which then disrobe and rob other adolescents, and sometimes even 
adults, if they are drunk. Fourteen-year-old Sasha rode in from 
the Urals. A man at the train station asked him: ``Do you want 
to earn some money? You can sell beer.'' And so a new 
``station'' life begins. Money, lots of it. The children steal 
from passers-by and divide the loot among themselves. And when 
there's extra money, you can drink, and you can spend some time 
with the young girls in the station--there are many of them 
here, and they're cheap. 
  Station girls are 14-16 years old for the most part, but 
recently 12-year-olds are encountered more often as well. 
  The station life of an adolescent doesn't last long--the 
police catch the children and send them to the detention and 
distribution center. Here they are bathed, deloused, fed and 
sent for treatment. In 6 months the center housed 2,812 persons; 
1,582 of these children were returned to their parents. To those 
who hadn't had their parental rights taken away from them. To 
those who could be located. In recent months many children have 
been arriving from zones of conflict. It is becoming 
increasingly more difficult to send them back home. Inquiries 
take a long time, and often without success. The center's 
associates work on the basis of personal contacts--after all, 
prior to the USSR's disintegration they had worked in this 
system for several years, and so old ties and acquaintances help 
to solve the problems. The question is, how much longer will 
this system work? In the Baltic states, in Georgia and in 
Chechen, there is a unique attitude toward children from the 
detention center. An Estonian or Georgian child will be picked 
up quickly, while a Russian one is not, because, they say, its 
parents are part of an occupying force. 
  The children go around here in pairs. To lunch, and for 
exercise, under the escort of police. As I looked at these pairs 
under convoy, I experienced pain and shame. Days go by, but the 
pain and the shame do not pass.

FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: SB wins UK approval for anti-viral drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham has launched itself into a new and potentially lucrative
healthcare field with the approval in the UK of famciclovir, its anti-viral
drug.
It has been granted a licence from the UK Department of Health to market the
compound under the trade name Famvir for the treatment of herpes zoster,
better known as shingles.
It will allow SmithKline Beecham to challenge the effective monopoly in
anti-viral drugs held by Wellcome, its UK rival.
The business is currently dominated by Zovirax, Wellcome's best selling drug
with annual sales of more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m).
Famvir would go on sale to doctors 'early next year', said SmithKline.
The company would not comment on the pricing of the drug, which has to
secure approvals in all the world's main drug markets to ensure its ultimate
success.
It has submitted famciclovir in more than 20 countries, with US approval
likely next year. About 40 per cent of world sales of Zovirax are in the US;
the UK accounts for about 5 per cent.
SmithKline Beecham is also seeking approval for the use of famciclovir in
treating conditions other than shingles.
Less than one third of Zovirax sales are used in the treatment of shingles;
the rest goes on herpes of the face and trunk, genital herpes and chicken
pox.
Although Zovirax has effectively had a monopoly in the anti-viral market,
this is about to change.
Patents on the drug begin to expire this year, although they remain in force
until 1997 in the US, which accountsfor almost half of total sales.
Wellcome has already launched over-the-counter versions of Zovirax as part
of an attempt to forestall the effect of competition from generic
competition.
Glaxo and Warner-Lambert of the US yesterday confirmed that they have signed
agreements under which they will form a joint venture to develop and market
over-the-counter versions of Glaxo's prescription drugs.
The joint venture will initially concentrate on developing Zantac, the ulcer
treatment that has been the world's best selling drug for several years, for
the non-prescription market.
OTC Zantac would probably be sold as a treatment for stomach upsets and will
be submitted in 1995 to the US Food and Drug Administration for approval.

   St. Joseph's Aspirin for Children, once a
leader in over-the-counter pain relief for youngsters, is slowly
disappearing from medicine cabinets.
   The manufacture of the chewable orange tablets ended in December
1986 as Shering Plough Corp. of Madison focuses on chewable
low-dosage aspirin products for adults concerned about preventing
heart disease.
   Aspirin-free pain relievers and name-brand aspirin products
competed with each other until the American Academy of Pediatrics,
in a report in 1982, said giving aspirin to children suffering from
chicken pox and influenza increased the risk of contracting Reye's
syndrome.
   The illness is fatal in about 20 percent to 30 percent of the
cases, and some survivors suffer permanent brain damage. The
government in 1986 ordered warning labels on all aspirin bottles
about the risk to children and teen-agers of contracting Reye's
syndrome.
   The market ``dropped considerably from 1980 with the Reye's
syndrome business,'' said Terry Kelly, a spokesman for Sterling
Drug Inc. of New York, which still manufactures Bayer's Aspirin for
Children.
   ``We feel there are certain patients for whom children's aspirin
is appropriate,'' Kelly said.
   St. Joseph's Aspirin for Children, first marketed in 1949, was
replaced with aspirin-free tablets called St. Joseph's Aspirin-Free
Fever Reducer.
   Jim Saberton, a consultant with Kline &amp; Co. Inc. in Fairfield,
said Wednesday that the children's aspirin market has become
relatively small with sales of about $15 million in 1986 compared
with sales of about $115 million for the non-aspirin pain reliever
acetominophen that same year.
   ``The risk and work involved in making aspirin is unattractive,
especially since there's acetominophen,'' he said.
   St. Joseph's Aspirin for Children and Bayer Children's Aspirin
each had about $5 million in sales in 1986, with the balance of
sales taken up by generic brands, he said.
   He also said Johnson &amp; Johnson's Tylenol products, which use
acetominophen, cut heavily into sales of St. Joseph's, which once
held 50 percent of the children's pain-reliever market while Bayer
had the other half.
   Lewis Nolan, a Schering Plough spokesman, said, however, that
his company disputes the link of aspirin to Reye's syndrome.
   ``It's been our position that there's been no scientific valid
evidence to link aspirin and Reye's syndrome,'' he said.
   St. Joseph's Low Dose Adult Aspirin was introduced last month,
although the company makes no claim in relation to aspirin's
effectiveness against heart disease. The low dose aspirin product
label advises it not be given to young children, he said.
   Kelly said his company showed higher sales of Bayer Children's
Aspirin during 1987, although he could not say if it was due to
Shering Plough leaving the market.
   ``I think the first increase you saw was ours last year. I
cannot analyze why that is,'' he said.

   Whitehall Laboratories said the Food and Drug Administration approved for prescription sale a liquid form of its ibuprofen drug for children, and an over-the-counter product combining ibuprofen with a nasal decongestant. 

   Whitehall, a division of American Home Products Corp., said its new CoAdvil is the first product to combine ibuprofen, which it markets under the trade name Advil, with another medication. 
CoAdvil contains Advil and pseudoephedrine, a widely used oral drug to relieve nasal congestion. 

   The prescription drug, Children's Advil Suspension, is a fruit-flavored liquid version of ibuprofen, suggested for use to reduce fever and treat signs and symptoms of juvenile arthritis. 
It also is indicated for use by adults to relieve rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis symptoms and other pain. 

   Use of aspirin to treat fever in children has declined, because of concerns about Reye's syndrome, which has been associated with influenza or chicken pox in children who have received aspirin. 

   Whitehall's Advil is the second-biggest over-the-counter pain-relief product, with a 12% share of the $2.2 billion annual consumer-analgesic business. 

   A Whitehall spokeswoman said the company began shipping CoAdvil to retailers yesterday and it will be a "major promotion. 
As the first ibuprofen combination, it is going to be a very big product." 

   Children's Advil Suspension will be available "by the time physicians begin prescribing it," she said.

<HL> Technology: Merck Steps Up Tests of Its Drug For Shrinking Enlarged Prostates </HL>

<CO> MRK </CO>
<IN> PHA </IN>
<DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Merck &amp; Co. plans to begin advanced studies of its experimental drug for shrinking enlarged prostate glands, a drug that analysts believe may be the pharmaceutical giant's next big seller. 

   Speaking to securities analysts here, P. Roy Vagelos, Merck's chairman and chief executive officer, said the prostate drug, called Proscar, appeared in preliminary human trials to be effective and "well tolerated." 
Analysts believe that if the broader, "phase three" human tests go well, Proscar could be a big seller because it would be the first problem-free pill to treat enlarged prostates, a condition that afflicts half of all men over the age of 70 and that is sometimes associated with prostate cancer. 

   Analysts estimate that annual sales of the drug, if proven safe and effective, could range into the hundreds of millions of dollars. 
That's because patients would have to keep taking the drug in order to prevent the problem from recurring. 

   At present, enlarged prostates, which can be painful and inhibit urine flow, are usually treated with surgery. 
There are several other drugs in use or being tested, but they work by inhibiting the male hormone testosterone or by the administration of female hormones, both of which can affect a man's sex drive and performance. 
Proscar blocks an enzyme that turns testosterone into dihydrostesterone, the chemical responsible for enlarging the gland. 
In theory, the drug doesn't affect the normal amount of male hormone available in the body. 

   At the meeting, Dr. Vagelos referred to the drug for the first time publicly as Proscar, its newly christened brand name, an indication to analysts that the drug was advancing steadily through the testing process. 
Dr. Vagelos declined to predict when the drug might be available, but Merck isn't expected to seek approval for the drug for a year or more. 
The drug is also expected to be tested for use against prostate cancer. 

   Dr. Vagelos provided other details of the company's plans at the meeting. 
He said that Merck, based in Rahway, N.J., might consider a new share repurchase plan, though he provided no details. 

   He also said that the company, for the first time, was developing drugs specifically for the over-the-counter consumer health-care market. 
He said such products would be marketed by other companies with experience in that business. 
He declined to name specific products. 

   Dr. Vagelos also reiterated his brash design to field best-selling drugs in every major disease category in every major world market. 
He said that in order to accomplish this, research and development spending will have to rise to about $1 billion a year. 
In 1988, such spending will be about $650 million. 
He said the company expects to have the largest annual revenue of any drug company in Europe by 1992; it already is No. 1 in the U.S. 

   Merck's pipeline of experimental drugs continues to be robust, said Dr. Vagelos. 
He noted that the company just sought government approval to sell a vaccine against childhood meningitis that can be used in much younger children than can be treated with current vaccines. 
He also predicted Merck will apply next year for approval of its chicken pox vaccine. 

   Mr. Vagelos said that in order to market these and other drugs, Merck plans to increase its sales force by 500 this year. 
Such jobs are seen as the plum of the industry because of Merck's extensive line of products. 
The Pink Sheet, a drug industry trade letter, reported this week that Merck had 28,000 applications for the openings. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Merck shares closed at $58.875, down 12.5 cents.

FT  29 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Wellcome chief's strategy to assure
continued growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN ROBB, Wellcome's chief executive, yesterday outlined his strategy to
assure his group's continued profits growth.
He warned that underlying results might be affected in the long term by
political change, and in particular world-wide pressure on prices. The
pricing situation was not getting any easier, he said. In Japan and parts of
Europe it was draconian and he expected further price changes in European
markets.
In the US, Mr Robb said he had no doubt that pricing pressure would become
more difficult, no matter which party won the coming presidential elections.
Payments to Medicaid, the joint state-federal health care scheme for poor
families, were Pounds 8m in the year to August 29 1992 and would rise to
Pounds 40m this financial year. Wellcome's future depended upon its ability
to generate volume growth, said Mr Robb.
The main driving force last year was Zovirax, Wellcome's herpes, chicken pox
and shingles drug. Sales increased 24 per cent to Pounds 586m, twice the
figure achieved three years ago and nearly a third of overall sales.
Mr Robb said Zovirax's potential was by no means exhausted. The group had
gained approval to sell the drug over the counter without a prescription in
New Zealand and Germany, where its patents expire next year.
Meanwhile, Wellcome is in a race with SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American
group, to develop a second generation anti-herpes compound. Wellcome has two
molecules, called 256U and 882C, nearing the completion of their
development. These are due for launch in 1995 and 1996, while SmithKline
Beecham expects to bring Famciclovir, its new treatment, to market in 1995.
Sales of Retrovir, the HIV-treatment also known as AZT, increased 22 per
cent to Pounds 213m, following a disappointing previous year, said Mr Robb.
He warned, however, that Retrovir was now in a competitive environment,
battling against DDI from Bristol-Myers Squibb of the US, and DDC which is
marketed by Switzerland's Hoffman-La Roche.
Mr Robb said sales would continue to grow as Retrovir was used increasingly
in combination with such drugs.
Sales of newer drugs, such as Tracrium, Wellbutrin, Wellferon, Exosurf and
Lamictil, generated Pounds 200m.
Further growth is expected to come from Wellcome's over the counter
operations (OTC), which increased 17 per cent to Pounds 237m.
Mr Robb said Wellcome was seeking ways to expand its OTC business. The
company wanted to gain critical mass in the US and the Continent, but he did
not want to make an acquisition that would dilute earnings, even in the
first year.
Mr Robb said the UK business had been hit by poor penetration of Zovirax and
a high incidence of parallel imports. The organisation had been shaken up,
he said.
US sales rose 16 per cent to Pounds 737m, thanks to a strong performance
from the anti-viral and OTC businesses. European sales increased 20 per cent
to Pounds 590m.
Japanese revenues were up 18 per cent to Pounds 128m, following the
introduction of Zovirax as a treatment for shingles. Other international
sales increased 17 per cent to Pounds 188m.

NEVER TOO LATE TO KEEP IN SHAPE;

AT 73, FOOTBALL HAS PASSED HIM BY . . . BUT NOT FITNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Question: At the age of 73, I have given up all hope of becoming a professional 
football player. But my son keeps after me to do some walking every day because 
he says it will make me feel better. At my age, I feel better doing as little 
as possible. Do you see any good that walking would do for someone my age? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Exercise should be a part of the routine of all people, regardless of 
age, although the type of exercise obviously has to be tailored to the 
individual's particular needs. From what you write in your letter, your son is 
suggesting that you do some walking, not that you become a professional 
football player; there is a difference between the two. 
</P>
<P>
Walking can help an older person maintain muscle strength and agility. Not only 
can this have a beneficial effect on the person's overall well-being and 
quality of life, the physical benefits include a reduction in the risk of 
accidental falls, a serious occurrence in the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I go to a track in a high school in my neighborhood for some walking 
exercise a few times a week, and I meet a lot of other walkers and some runners 
there. Some of the runners check their pulse while they exercise, and I would 
like to know why they do this and what it is that they are looking for. 
</P>
<P>
A: The pulse rate indicates how hard your cardiovascular system is working. 
Many people who engage in aerobic exercise check their pulse by obtaining the 
rate for 10 seconds and multiplying that figure by six to get the rate per 
minute. A healthy 20-year-old, for example, should have a pulse rate after 10 
minutes of exercise in the range of 138 to 174. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Professional athletes go where it's warm to get into shape, but very few of 
us who work for a living can do the same. I jog during the year and I also like 
to keep in shape during the winter months, but I don't know if jogging in cold 
weather is a good idea. Can't it hurt the lungs if you breathe cold air? 
</P>
<P>
A: Breathing cold air is not harmful to the lungs because the body warms the 
air as you breathe it. If the cold air bothers you, however, you might try 
wearing a scarf over your nose and mouth; you may find that this added 
protection makes breathing somewhat easier. 
</P>
<P>
If you decide against running outside in the cold weather, there are a number 
of alternatives. An indoor track is one possibility, and a brisk walk, which 
can even be taken in a shopping center, can be beneficial. A stationary bicycle 
and a rowing machine are other possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I hear more and more about the immune system, especially concerning AIDS. 
Would you please explain just what the immune system is or what it does? 
</P>
<P>
A: The immune system protects the individual from infection and takes part in 
the regulation of normal processes within the body. 
</P>
<P>
As you might expect, it is a complicated network. It consists of organs, 
tissues, cells and regulatory substances that circulate in the blood. 
</P>
<P>
In some diseases, there are changes in the cells. These changes seem to 
contribute to the disease. 
</P>
<P>
An immune response can protect a person from infection. In chicken pox, for 
example, the immune system is stimulated to produce antibodies that will react 
against the virus. Subsequently, on exposure to the virus, the antibodies will 
help destroy it. This is the reason it is a rare event when someone gets 
chicken pox more than once. 
</P>
<P>
The same sequence of events would occur naturally with a disease such as polio; 
however, polio is too dangerous to leave to nature. Therefore, people are given 
polio vaccine, which stimulates the immune system without subjecting the 
individual to the risk of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I know someone who was told by her doctor that she had fibrocystic disease 
but that it is not cancer. If it is not cancer, can you please tell me what it 
is? 
</P>
<P>
A: Fibrocystic disease refers to a variety of benign conditions of the breast. 
It is manifested by a feeling of lumpiness or by breasts that are irregular to 
the touch. As you note in your letter, fibrocystic disease is not a cancerous 
condition, nor does the fact that a woman has fibrocystic disease mean that she 
is going to get cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The condition is very common and has been estimated to occur in as many as 80% 
of women. In fact, some physicians believe that almost all women over 30 years 
of age have some fibrocystic breast tissue.

<TEXT>     It was the 17th consecutive victory for the WVAL-leading Monarchs (20-1,
9-0), ranked first in Santa Clara County and second in the Cal-Hi Sports state
Division IV poll.;    Prospect (15-5, 7-3), ranked No. 4 in the county, only
lost 47-46 to the Monarchs on Jan. 18 at Mitty, and the Panthers had high
hopes late last week that they would have a legitimate shot at winning the
rematch.;    That was before they lost four players for Wednesday's game --
two with injuries and two with chicken pox.;    Heather Sims, a starting
5-foot-9 center, suffered a dislocation and possible torn ligament in her left
knee, and senior guard Heather Gonsalves stretched ligaments in her left ankle
during the Panthers' 64-36 win Monday over Del Mar, said Prospect Coach John
Melvin.;    And reserve guards Caroline McCarthy and Elaine Su missed their
second straight game with the chicken pox.;    "Sims' loss is what really
hurt," Melvin said. "She always does a good job on defense, and she is tough
on the boards.;    "Our girls gave it a great effort tonight against an
outstanding team. Mitty's depth got to us midway through the second half, and
Stahl was unstoppable.";    Stahl improved her team-leading scoring average to
17.5 with a game-high 20 points. Eight her points came during the Monarchs'
14-0 run, which increased a 30-29 Mitty lead late in the third quarter to
44-29 with two minutes, 31 seconds left in the game.;    Stahl also
contributed on defense, helping limit Michelle Miller to two points in the
second half after the Prospect forward scored 12 in the opening two quarters.;
   "Kathy played very well on both ends of the court," said Robb Karr, who
co-coaches the Monarchs with Helen Gengras. "Miller didn't do a whole lot
after we put Kathy on her during the second quarter.";    Said Miller, the
Panthers' leading scorer with a 17 points-per-game average, "They began
sagging on me inside after I had the fast start, and they came out on me when
I moved outside."  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  A CHEMICAL that limits heat-trapping methane in the atmosphere has been
significantly depleted in the Northern Hemisphere, according to a computerized
simulation of atmospheric processes by scientists at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico.;    The naturally occurring chemical, called a
hydroxyl radical, consists of an oxygen atom and a hydrogen atom. It destroys
methane, a highly potent "greenhouse" gas that blocks the escape of heat from

<TEXT>     The Los Alamos results suggest that the amount of the chemical in the
Northern Hemisphere is less than one-third that in the Southern, a depletion
more than twice as extensive as previously thought. Scientists say the
depletion is most likely related to industrial activity.;  Reye's cases;  For
a second straight year, the United States has reported just 25 cases of Reye's
syndrome, a 20-fold drop from 1980, and health officials credit increased
awareness of the link between aspirin and the childhood disease.;    At its
peak in 1980, 555 cases of Reye's syndrome were reported.;    "This is a very
good public health success," said Dr. Joseph Kent, an infectious diseases
specialist with the federal Centers for Disease Control. But, he added, "If we
stop emphasizing 'Don't give aspirin to your children,' it may come back.";   
Reye's syndrome is a potentially fatal disease that has been linked to the use
of aspirin to treat childhood flu or chicken pox. Symptoms include vomiting,
lethargy and even coma.;  Mammoth find;  A Columbian mammoth whose remains
were found at a site near the Havasu National Wildlife Refuge on the Colorado
River in Arizona died about 30,000 years ago -- long before humans entered the
area, archaeologists say.;    Work began last week removing the bones, which
will be cataloged and then stored in a Northern Arizona University repository
in Flagstaff.;    Don Simonis, an archaeologist with the U.S. Bureau of Land
Management, said the bones represent the most ancient mammoth find in the
county and the first to be subjected to intense scientific scrutiny.;  Safer
pregnancies;  Teaching pregnant women to monitor their blood pressure at home
can produce accurate results and reduce unnecessary medication and visits to
the doctor, a new study suggests.;    Researchers reported in a recent issue
of The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology that blood pressure
readings taken at home between regular doctor visits were consistently lower
than those at clinics for 52 percent of pregnant patients.;    In a two-year
study of 59 women, the doctors found that once women learned to monitor their
blood pressure at home, half those who had taken medications for hypertension
before pregnancy were able to discontinue the medicine because of consistently
normal blood pressure levels recorded outside the clinic.;  Hodgkin's virus; 
Hodgkin's disease, a cancer of the lymph nodes that commonly strikes young
adults, may be caused by the Epstein-Barr virus, which is thought to infect
many people, British and Dutch researchers have found. They suggest it may
even be possible to develop a vaccine against the virus that would prevent the
disease.;    The virus is known to produce other types of cancers, but until
recently, researchers had been able to find it in only a small percentage of
Hodgkin's tumors. However, the researchers reported last week in the British
journal The Lancet that they identified a protein from the virus in cancer
cells from 40 of 84 Hodgkin's patients studied.  </TEXT>

   Bob Landecker wasn't going to let
chicken pox keep him from the first day of his new job _ not after
what he went through to get it.
   Landecker was hired Monday by radio station KKSU after he spent
the day sitting on Main Street with a sign reading, ``Hi Hutch. I
am Bob Landecker. I need a job.''
   Cliff Shank, who needed a program director and afternoon
announcer for KKSU, was intrigued.
   ``I stopped by to talk with him,'' Shank said. ``Anyone who has
got the gumption to do that might be someone worth looking at.''
   Landecker went on the air Tuesday despite having chicken pox.
   ``I started breaking out right before my first show,'' said
Landecker, who worked in a secluded room.
   Landecker said he once worked for a public relations company in
Ponca City, Okla. But he said he got the idea to advertise for a
job from a radio announcer in Tulsa who rented a billboard and
received several offers.

   Only hours after he clanged and chimed his
way to his ninth victory in the 25th annual Cable Car Bell Ringing
Competition, Carl Payne already was thinking about next year's
contest.
   ``I have to be constantly thinking of something that's catchy, a
little different,'' the 47-year-old cable car gripman said
Wednesday.
   Payne, who has been at the controls _ and the bell _ of a cable
car for the past two decades, says he is serious about his
bell-ringing art, in which he combines popular songs, everyday
sounds and his own fanciful rhythms.
   On Wednesday, Payne's inventiveness and skill led to victory
against five other gripmen and conductors on the city's cable car
system. The six finalists were chosen from about 30 contestants in
last week's preliminary ``ringoff.''
   While Payne thinks highly of his colleagues, he had special
praise for the winner of the amateur category _ 15-year-old David
Fillippone of Moraga.
   David clanged out a medley of ``Camptown Races'' and ``Good King
Wenceslaus.''
   ``The boy has a lot of talent, a lot of potential for ringing
the bell, Payne said.

   Florida Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul
for the first time experienced the thrill of victory at her own
kind of game.
   Although barred by law from playing the Florida lottery, she is
free to play in other states. She returned Tuesday from a visit to
Illinois with a winning ticket worth $174 from that state's lottery.
   ``It's funny how excited I got; $174 and I won the lottery!''
Mrs. Paul said Wednesday after a meeting of the Florida Lottery
Commission where she revealed her good fortune.
   ``I know this sounds silly,'' she said. ``I've been in this
industry about three years, and it's the first time I've really
experienced the excitement the lottery's about.''
   Mrs. Paul, the director of the Illinois lottery before taking
the Florida job last year, spent $2 on Illinois Cash 5 tickets in
Springfield while visiting her husband, Terry Paul, who still
resides there.
   Mrs. Paul said she matched four of the five winning numbers
drawn Monday night by using her birthday, her husband's birthday
and her ``lucky number,'' 14.
   ``My husband yelled at me for not getting the fifth number
right,'' she said with a smile. ``I said, `It's your fault. It's
your birthday I missed on.'''

Greg Anthony, his face covered with tape because of a broken jaw, looked like a 
masked man. Anderson Hunt, who worried the last two days that he might have 
chicken pox, looked the picture of health. 
</P>
<P>
The two guards inspired Nevada Las Vegas to a 109-86 rout of New Mexico State 
Thursday night, staving off the Aggies' bid to take over first place in the Big 
West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony, who broke his jaw Monday night in a game against Fresno State, shocked 
Coach Jerry Tarkanian by showing up for practice Wednesday. Anthony intended to 
play wearing a hockey helmet and a football facemask. 
</P>
<P>
He decided before the game, however, not to wear the mask and immediately made 
a three-point shot, exciting the crowd of 18,790 in the Thomas &amp; Mack 
Center, and setting the tone of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels (21-4, 13-1 in the Big West) made 13 three-point shots, nine by 
Hunt, who as it turned out had only sinus congestion. Hunt, who came within one 
of tying Freddie Banks' school record for three-pointers, scored 31 points. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony played 32 minutes, scored 10 points and had six assists and two steals. 
</P>
<P>
"Greg was a real inspiration, he played with so much courage," Tarkanian said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time he came out, they were putting oxygen in his nose." 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian was worried. Center David Butler's knee was strained, reserve guard 
Stacey Cvijanovich has a shoulder separation and reserve guard Travis Bice has 
chicken pox. 
</P>
<P>
And the seventh-ranked Rebels, who have won the Big West seven consecutive 
years, were not comfortably in first place as they usually are this time of 
year. In addition, they lost to the Aggies, 83-82, on Jan. 8 at Las Cruces, 
N.M. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the game we had to have," Tarkanian said. "I didn't have a good 
feeling before the game, but our team has great pride." 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas dominated the Aggies (20-3, 11-2) in the first half and were never 
threatened. The Rebels lead the Aggies by 1 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels got off to the emotional start they wanted when Anthony, Hunt and 
Butler made contributions right away. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony and Hunt each hit three-point shots and Butler, dominating the boards, 
had two free throws and a tip-in, and the Rebels led, 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State tied the game, 10-10, but the Rebels, passing the ball crisply 
over New Mexico State's matchup zone defense, went on an 8-2 run, highlighted 
by two three-pointers from Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt stayed hot, swishing two more of the long shots to give the Rebels a 26-16 
lead with 8:45 left. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Aggies couldn't make much headway against Las Vegas' man-to-man 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
"We played about as good as we can in the first half," Tarkanian said. "We 
moved the ball beautifully and our defense was great." 
</P>
<P>
The three-point shooting was contagious. Barry Young came off the bench to make 
two bombs before Hunt made two more in succession to increase the lead to 
48-31. He made another one at the buzzer, and the Rebels led at the half, 
62-39. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had 21 points and Butler scored 17 for the Rebels.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Jean Shiner has been blind from birth. Her
husband, Franklin, can see a little but is legally blind. You'd
figure that bringing up two lively, normal daughters, aged 3 and 5,
would prove an overwhelming burden. Read on.

   Now and then when her daughters were
babies, Jean Shiner would wander the landscapes of their bodies
with her hands. ``I could feel them and know exactly who had a
short nose and who had long fingers. It was neat.''
   Now Esther is 5 and Judy 3, too big to sit still for such
things. But the memory came back recently as Jean applied calamine
lotion.
   The actual location of their chicken pox rash eluded her, but
``I just put it all over them. That way, I figured I'd hit it.''
   Which pretty much sums up the common sense, humor and love Jean
Shiner brings to raising two children she cannot see.
   She's been blind all her life, but that never stopped her from
learning to bicycle, ski or sail. It never stopped her from going
to college, graduating with honors or earning a master's degree.
   Nor did it stop her from falling in love, with a deep-voiced,
articulate man eight years her senior.
   At the Perkins School for the Blind outside Boston, where Jean
boarded from age 5, ``you were encouraged to date sighted guys.''
   ``We had socials. They would bring in sighted kids, but then
you'd never see them again. The idea was you should marry someone
with a pair of eyes to drive you around and read to you and take
care of you.''
   Jean married Franklin Shiner, legally blind from birth. Which
pretty much sums up her attitude about being cared for.
   The Shiners' snug, red-shingled house has an ambiance any parent
can appreciate, from the crunch of a stray Cheerio in the kitchen
to the deflating balloons strewn about the living room, stragglers
from Judy's birthday party. Counting the Shiner kids, the guest
list numbered nine.
   Outside is the timeless small-town summer symphony of chattering
children, barking dogs and hissing lawn sprinklers, punctuated by
slamming screen doors.
   Each time the Shiners' door opens, a bell rings. ``On the first
warm day of the year, when we all opened our doors for the first
time, Judy kept running out,'' Jean explains.
   Today, there's also the steady drone of the TV in the Shiner
living room, a rare concession to chicken pox by a mother faced
with entertaining two house-bound kids, a visitor, and a bored
German shepherd.
   She serves coffee to the visitor, cheese puffs and juice to the
girls, then pours herself a cup of tea and sinks into a kitchen
chair.
   Frank Shiner has already strapped on his backpack and set off
for Montpelier's lone supermarket, a two-mile round trip he makes
every other day. Jean likes to cook and has a well-stocked freezer,
with a braille map.
   On a normal day, Esther and Judy would be outdoors by now,
riding bikes, blowing bubbles or playing with other kids. Lunch is
a prelude to ``quiet time,'' followed by outings to the pool or the
library with Seltzer the guide dog in the lead. Jean grips
Seltzer's harness and Esther pushes Judy's stroller, a formation
perfected over time.
   ``Esther will help me report stores as we walk downtown, if I go
past where I wanted to go,'' says Jean, 36, a slender woman with
youthful good looks and a friendly, confident manner.
   Other animals tend to be Seltzer's downfall, and ``Esther has
learned to spot them a block away. She'll yell `I see a dog! I see
a cat!'
   ``Probably 10 years from now I'll look back and say `How did I
do it?''' For the time being, however, Jean would much rather be
called ``ordinary'' than ``amazing,'' as in, ``Isn't she amazing?
She can walk down the street with her kids and her dog!''
   Esther and Judy find Jean and Frank every bit as ordinary as
most small children regard their parents. ``Mommy is blind and she
can't see and Daddy is blind and he can see a little,'' Esther
explains, in the slightly exasperated voice of big sisters
everywhere. The interview ends abruptly, as the subject loses
interest and wanders back to ``Sesame Street.''
   Esther, immaculate in Oshkosh overalls, is the studious one,
with thoughtful dark eyes, a neat cap of brown hair and dimples
like her mother's. Judy's a disheveled escape artist, hazel-eyed,
round-faced and rambunctious.
   Both girls report each other's mischief except in cases of
conspiracy, as when, in the interest of science, they snuck a
little extra baking powder into their mother's cookie dough. ``They
were really yucky,'' Jean says cheerfully. ``We ate them anyway.''
   In the living room, the sound of crunching cheese puffs stops
abruptly, and Esther pipes up right on cue.
   ``Judy's stuffing her cheeks, Mommy.''
   ``Don't stuff your cheeks, Judy.''
   Jean relies on a combination of intuition and hearing to tell
her when her kids are up to something. Like most mothers, she's
seldom wrong.
   ``They get sat in the chair when I think they're doing
something.'' The most common chair-sitting offense at the moment:
``Looking out the window at neighbors who don't go to bed when they
do.''
   Esther wanders into the kitchen scrunching a brown paper bag.
``Sometimes I do this to bags,'' she says solemnly, then dissolves
into giggles as her mother swoops down and scoops her up in a hug.
``Sometimes I do this to little girls,'' Jean tells her.

<LEADPARA>  Reye's syndrome, the potentially fatal childhood disease linked to aspirin,
has been virtually wiped out, federal researchers say.;    The Centers for
Disease Control on Thursday reported 25 cases of Reye's syndrome for its 1989
reporting year, the same as in 1988. Preliminary reports point to fewer than
20 cases for 1990.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  REYE'S SYNDROME DEFEATED  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     In contrast, 555 cases were reported in 1980, the disease's peak year.;   
"This is a very good public health success," said Dr. Joseph Kent, a CDC
infectious diseases specialist.;    "If we stop emphasizing 'Don't give
aspirin to your children,' it may come back," Kent said.;    Reye's syndrome
has been linked to the use of aspirin to treat childhood flu or chicken pox.
While case counts declined in the early 1980s, Reye's syndrome plummeted after
1986, when aspirin containers first were required to carry precautionary
warnings for parents.;    Symptoms include vomiting, lethargy -- a sign of
brain damage -- and even coma and death. At least 10 of the 25 patients in
1989 died.;    The disease afflicts children from infancy to about age 19,
with most cases occurring in children 5-10 years old. Researchers don't
understand what role aspirin plays in the onset of the disease.  </TEXT>

<HL> The Lives of 4 Toddlers Who Suffer From AIDS </HL>
<AUTHOR> Marilyn Chase </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<IN> PHA </IN>
<TEXT>
   Imagine life in a stainless-steel hospital crib. 
Food and medicine are fed through a catheter implanted permanently in your chest. 
Maybe your mother helps bathe and feed you, but often care comes from a team of surrogates -- doctors, nurses and social workers. 

   At age one, you walked, fed yourself and spoke a few words. 
But the passing months wobble your gait, steal your coordination, and garble and finally silence your words. 

   Infections, fevers and wasting assail your frame until death comes, perhaps as early as age two. 
The final blow may be something as simple and sudden as chicken pox. 
Or death's agent may be the encroaching dementia that turns toddlerhood back into infancy. 
Maybe death comes after a long, arduous battle with pneumonia. 

   Consider the cases of four children who suffer from the virus:
   "A" (full names have been omitted to protect the children's privacy) doesn't see the Mylar balloon and the plush toy dog at the foot of his bed in the Jack Weiler Hospital unit of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. 
At age four, the sturdy, light-brown youngster has been reduced to a vegetative state by AIDS dementia. 
Oblivious to the television set that chatters above his head, his wide eyes stare at the wall, flicking now and then from side to side with involuntary jerks that the doctors say are a sign of neurological damage. 
He hasn't spoken in months. 

   "They're sending him home soon," says Maadhava Ellaurie, an immunologist. 
"There's not much we can do for him. 
The outlook is poor." 

   In nearby Newark, N.J., two-year-old "D" naps serenely in the pediatric ward of the Children's Hospital, a unit of the United Hospitals Medical Center. 
Her green gingham dress is immaculate, her room cheery and crammed with toys. 
Hospital Administrator Linda Antillon explains that this child is the ward's pet; the nurses buy her clothes and take them home to wash. 
Her mother makes rare appearances. 
"I've personally seen her only once in nine months," Mrs. Antillon says. 

   When the child wakes, "she scoots around in a walker, sings, finger paints. 
She's hysterical," Mrs. Antillon adds, eyes brimming. 
The girl says a few words, but her development is suspended at the level of a 10-month-old baby. 
She suffers malabsorption -- an inability to take in nutrients from food -- and must take supplemental feedings intravenously through the Broviac catheter imbedded in her chest. 
Nevertheless, a bedside menu lists macaroni and other foods. 
"She needs to try to eat, to exercise her facial muscles, to help with speech," says Mrs. Antillon optimistically. 
As she sleeps, the little girl puckers her lips like a baby dreaming of the bottle. 

   In New York, on the 17th floor of Harlem Hospital, lies four-year-old "C," awake but slumped dejectedly on her pillow, face to the wall. 
Elaine Abrams tiptoes up to the bedside and whispers, "Hi, sweetie, want to talk?" 
The girl shakes her head sadly and refuses to look her doctor in the eye. 

   "Come closer," Dr. Abrams beckons a reporter. 
"I want you to see how thin she is." 
She lifts the blanket, briefly exposing the girl's twiglike flanks, wrapped in Pampers. 
"C" weighs 22 pounds, as much as an average one year old. 
She has suffered from runaway herpes infections, fevers and wasting and can't tolerate food. 
Her mother is hospitalized three floors below with AIDS pneumonia. 
At home are four siblings in the care of an aged aunt. 
Still, says Dr. Abrams, the girl is "depressed and wants to go home." 

   Harlem Hospital's longest child resident is "J," a mute but animated three year old who has spent two years in residence. 
Another patient who contracted AIDS at or around birth, he suffers cardiac complications, clubbed fingers and a special kind of pneumonia that afflicts AIDS children. 
Called LIP (for lymphoid interstitial pneumonia), it is different from the adult variety, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which is caused by protozoa. 

   A bright-eyed mimic who quickly engages a visitor in a game of knocking down dominoes, "J" uses gestures to cue the hospital staff to his needs. 
Far from helpless, he can hook up his own nasogastric feeding tube and is "quite bright" in Dr. Abrams's view. 
But AIDS-related neurological damage has robbed him of speech and mobility. 
He can sit up but no longer walks. 

   Looking snappy in red suspenders and a "Jesse Jackson for President" button, "J" holds court in the playroom of the pediatric ward. 
One wall is decorated with his egg-crate "spaceship" and his first wobbly paintbrush strokes, dated and displayed by doting nurses. 
Asked about "J's" family, Dr. Abrams shrugs and says, "He has a mother on every shift." 

   Persuading infected parents of infected children to come in for the testing and treatment they need is hard. 
Fear and suspicion, poverty, drug use and denial are formidable obstacles. 

   In Harlem Hospital's "Pink Room" -- named for the pink cards that identify child AIDS patients -- Dr. Abrams comes to check a baby girl playing in a walker. 
"This little girl's parents admit they use crack but deny using needles and told me they are negative for the virus," Dr. Abrams says. 
"I'm calling them in to be retested." 
Turning to the pink-pajama-clad baby, she singsongs sadly, "I don't believe your daddy." 
The baby smiles.

<HEAD>Chicken Pox Keeps Mick Jones Off The Road</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>

   A case of chicken pox made Mick Jones cancel this
fall's ``Big Audio Dynamite'' tour. But Jones vows to come back.
   ``Tighten Up Vol. 88'' is the band's latest album and ``Just Play
Music,'' the first single, is receiving radio play in the United
States.
   With the group planning to resume touring after the new year,
Jones is anxious to regain its previous momentum.
   ``I think it's a growing thing, a matter of getting people to
listen, changing the way they think. I just want to communicate and
play music,'' said the 33-year-old guitarist and songwriter, who
recovered sufficiently to give a recent interview in midtown
Manhattan.
   ``I was getting into the mood where the group was unstoppable,''
he said, before canceling the tour.
   ``We were ravaged by the critics, but the music wasn't for them.
It was for more _ it was music with a reason, with something to say.
You can put us on page 13 of your paper, but you can't ignore us
because the other stuff is going to whither and die.''
   That touch of drama should be no surprise coming from Jones, who
help lead the British punk movement with the Clash a decade ago.
   Jones was born in London in 1955. A fan of such groups as the
Animals and the Kinks, he considered rock 'n' roll ``the most
exciting thing around.'' But in the 1970s, he and many other fans
grew disillusioned with the direction of rock. Punk groups began to
appear as a response to the complacency and indifference of
mainstream rock and society in general.
   Like the Sex Pistols, the Clash were crude, loud, angry and
threatening. In short everything they thought rock 'n' roll should
be. ``It needed to happen,'' said Jones. ``We needed it at that
time.''
   Punk wasn't simply a kind of music, it was an attitude. Jones,
like many who grew up in England in the '60s and '70s, felt that the
more established rock bands had turned their backs on the fans.
   ``The music's just as much about the fans,'' he said. ``They're
very important. They don't want go to the show and just have their
wallet emptied. They've got T-shirts, but they're not anywhere. You
need to take it to the next place.''
   Jones and bassist Paul Simonon were in the punk group London SS
before forming the Clash in 1976 with singer-guitarist Joe Strummer,
previously a member of the 101ers.
   ``At the time I was just expressing myself the only way I
could,'' Jones said. ``We looked at it as if we had a foot in the
door and we were going to go in that door. There has never been
anything like it since.''
   Their self-titled debut album came out in 1977 and contained some
of the most ferocious music ever recorded. As one reviewer noted, it
was music that ``never stops snarling. It's always threatening to
blow up in your face.''
   Jones, who ironically once worked as an inspector of suspected
letter bombs, readily agreed with that assessment.
   ``It was quite a rush,'' he said. ``It sounded beautiful to us.
Music should explode, it shouldn't be contained and well behaved and
do what it's told.''
   Although the Clash went on to record classic albums such as
``Give `Em Enough Rope'' and ``London Calling,'' the members of the
band started feuding and by 1984, the group had broken up.
   ``In the end, we ended up writing our own things and sort of
handing them over. It wasn't as much fun.''
   So Jones decided to start fresh. He wasn't interested in forming
a ``Mick Jones Project''; he wanted prospective bandmates to think
of themselves as equals.
   ```Ideas' was the main word. I wanted to have people with good
ideas and fresh ideas,'' he said. ``I was a good enough musician by
that time. I looked for people who had personality. I didn't want it
to just be me.''
   But Jones couldn't deny who would emerge as the band's leader.
   ``It's a dictatorship,'' he said, smiling, ``but a benevolent
dictatorahip. I wanted to make it a more democratic thing. I try and
listen to the others.''
   Jones pieced together a new group, starting with his friend and
ex-Clash video director Don Letts (credited with ``FX and Vocals'').
He added bassist Leo ``E-Zee Kill'' Williams. Drummer Greg Roberts
was hired through a newspaper ad, and Jones then brought in
keyboardist Dan Donovan who originally came to photograph the band.
   The group was named Big Audio Dynamite (B.A.D.), and drew on a
variety of musical styles, notably reggae. The first record, ``This
Is Big Audio Dynamite,'' was released in 1985, and eventually went
gold in Britain.
   Strummer briefly reunited with Jones to co-write and co-produce
B.A.D.'s next record, ``No. 10 Upping Street,'' with its hit single,
``Badrock City.''

<HEAD>Chicken Pox Keeps Mick Jones Off the Road</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A case of chicken pox made Mick Jones cancel this
fall's ``Big Audio Dynamite'' tour. But Jones vows to come back.
   ``Tighten Up Vol. 88'' is the band's latest album and ``Just Play
Music,'' the first single, is receiving radio play in the United
States.
   With the group planning to resume touring after the new year,
Jones is anxious to regain its previous momentum.
   ``I think it's a growing thing, a matter of getting people to
listen, changing the way they think. I just want to communicate and
play music,'' said the 33-year-old guitarist and songwriter, who
recovered sufficiently to give a recent interview in midtown
Manhattan.
   ``I was getting into the mood where the group was unstoppable,''
he said, before canceling the tour.
   ``We were ravaged by the critics, but the music wasn't for them.
It was for more _ it was music with a reason, with something to say.
You can put us on page 13 of your paper, but you can't ignore us
because the other stuff is going to whither and die.''
   That touch of drama should be no surprise coming from Jones, who
help lead the British punk movement with the Clash a decade ago.
   Jones was born in London in 1955. A fan of such groups as the
Animals and the Kinks, he considered rock 'n' roll ``the most
exciting thing around.'' But in the 1970s, he and many other fans
grew disillusioned with the direction of rock. Punk groups began to
appear as a response to the complacency and indifference of
mainstream rock and society in general.
   Like the Sex Pistols, the Clash were crude, loud, angry and
threatening. In short everything they thought rock 'n' roll should
be. ``It needed to happen,'' said Jones. ``We needed it at that
time.''
   Punk wasn't simply a kind of music, it was an attitude. Jones,
like many who grew up in England in the '60s and '70s, felt that the
more established rock bands had turned their backs on the fans.
   ``The music's just as much about the fans,'' he said. ``They're
very important. They don't want go to the show and just have their
wallet emptied. They've got T-shirts, but they're not anywhere. You
need to take it to the next place.''
   Jones and bassist Paul Simonon were in the punk group London SS
before forming the Clash in 1976 with singer-guitarist Joe Strummer,
previously a member of the 101ers.
   ``At the time I was just expressing myself the only way I
could,'' Jones said. ``We looked at it as if we had a foot in the
door and we were going to go in that door. There has never been
anything like it since.''
   Their self-titled debut album came out in 1977 and contained some
of the most ferocious music ever recorded. As one reviewer noted, it
was music that ``never stops snarling. It's always threatening to
blow up in your face.''
   Jones, who ironically once worked as an inspector of suspected

   A government stamp of approval is no guarantee
a product is safe, so manufacturers should not be exempt from
punishment when an approved product causes death or injury,
consumer advocates said today.
   Four national consumer groups reported that more than 1,300
deaths and thousands of serious injuries in the last 10 years
resulted from the use of drugs and medical devices approved by the
Food and Drug Administration.
   The report was issued as the Senate Commerce consumer
subcommittee held its third hearing on federal product liability
legislation backed by the Bush administration.
   The legislation includes a provision to exempt from punitive
damages in product liability cases those manufacturers whose
products received premarket approval from the FDA or the Federal
Aviation Administration.
   ``There is no principled basis, nor is there a need, to shield
manufacturers from punitive damages just because they have complied
with government standards,'' the report said.
   However, drug manufacturers argued today that under the proposed
legislation, injured victims would be protected and research and
marketing of potentially life-saving drugs would be speeded.
   ``This defense would not prevent full compensation from being
awarded to injured persons,'' said Richard Kingham, an attorney
representing the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association.
   ``There is documented evidence that liability concerns ... about
punitive damages have caused manufacturers to withdraw beneficial
drugs from the market,'' Kingham said.
   ``This is a disincentive to safety,'' he added.
   The study was issued jointly by Consumers Union, Public Citizen,
U.S. Public Interest Research Group and the Consumer Federation of
America. It cited several cases in which FDA-approved drugs and
devices caused deaths or life-threatening and permanent injuries.
   ``It is documentation of the failures of the FDA,'' said Pam
Gilbert, legislative director for Public Citizen's Congress Watch.
   The report said regulatory delays are one reason agency approval
should not be used as an excuse for corporate liability.
   It said that although strong evidence linked Reye's Syndrome, a
rare and often fatal disease, to the use of aspirin to treat
chicken pox and flu in children, it was four years before the
government required warning labels.
   ``In those four years, approximately 3,000 children developed
Reye's Syndrome, about 1,000 children died and many of the
surviving children suffered brain damage,'' the report said.
   The consumer groups also cited the FDA's approval of the
sedative Versed, used in short diagnostic surgical procedures, as a
sign that flaws in the regulatory process make the agency
unreliable.
   ``Several serious flaws in the approval process and subsequent
monitoring of Versed resulted in 40 deaths from cardiac or
respiratory depression in patients using the drug in the United
States,'' the report said.
   Business and industry representatives argue the liability
exception should be included in the bill because regulatory
agencies have more expertise than the courts to set and measure
product standards.
   ``Allowing the courts to second-guess regulatory standards may
result in unjustified imposition of liability,'' Robert C. Holland,
president of the Committee on Economic Development, told an earlier
hearing by the subcommittee.
   The CED is a research organization representing top business
executives and presidents of several major universities.

<HEAD>FDA Approves Drug for Children with `Bubble Boy' Syndrome</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Friday
approved a drug officials say will dramatically improve the lives
of children born with a rare disease that makes them unable to
fight infections.
   About 40 children worldwide are born each year with severe
combined immunodeficiency disease, or SCID, a genetic disorder also
called ``Boy in the Bubble'' disease because some children have
survived only by living in an enclosed, sterile environment.
   Peg-ADA was developed with a $169,000 grant from the FDA under
the ``orphan'' drug program, which is designed to give companies a
financial incentive to develop products for an extremely small
patient population.
   Children with SCID lack adequate immune systems and therefore
are unable to fight even common infections, such as chicken pox or
pneumonia. Most children with the disorder die before they are 2
years old.
   The only cure for the disease, the cause of which is believed to
be lack of an enzyme, is a bone marrow transplant, generally from a
sibling.
   Peg-ADA, made by Enzon Inc. of South Plainfield, N.J., will
allow children for whom bone marrow transplant is not feasible or
has failed to survive outside a sterile environment.
   Only about 20 percent of the children born with SCID find a
compatible bone-marrow donor and only about 30 percent to 40
percent of those have successful transplants, said Donna Chappina,
a spokeswoman for Enzon.
   ``It will have a dramatic effect on improving the quality of
life for the patients and their families,'' said Dr. James Mason,
assistant secretary for health in the Department of Health and
Human Services.
   Once the drug takes effect, children who had been confined to
sterile isolation would be able to live a normal life, going to
school and interacting with other people, Chappina said.
   The company said the drug is the first treatment for directly
correcting an inherited enzyme deficiency disease.
   The drug is administered weekly by injection. It is designed to
replace the missing enzyme adenosine deaminase, or ADA. Because it
does not prompt the body to produce the enzyme, patients must take
the injections for the rest of their lives.
   The product will be marketed under the trade name Adagen.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Wellcome under scrutiny - The Week
Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wellcome, the UK pharmaceuticals group, reports its full-year results on
Wednesday. Few surprises are expected and pre-tax profits of between Pounds
500m and Pounds 505m are forecast (Pounds 402.9m last year).
Sales of Zovirax, its herpes, shingles and chicken pox treatment, should
have topped Pounds 600m for the year, putting it in the world's top ten
selling drugs for the first time.
Wellcome's margins will also be under scrutiny. The new management has
undertaken to increase margins to 30 per cent by 1996. Analysts believe they
should improve 2.4 percentage points to about 27 per cent this year.
Imperial Chemical Industries, Britain's biggest manufacturer, announces its
third quarter results on Thursday. They will be watched even more carefully
than usual because of the proposed split of the company next year into two
separate groups. Pre-tax profits are likely to be grim, at around Pounds
100m compared with Pounds 196m last year.
Most of analysts' predictions for next year are based on an upturn in the
cycle. A gloomy forecast from Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, is likely to
lead to further downgrades.
Marks and Spencer, which singlehandedly accounts for some 30 per cent of the
market capitalisation of the stores sector, is likely to make some
encouraging noises about its trading prospects when it reports its interim
results on Wednesday.
Against a background of ambivalent signals about the state of consumer
spending, M and S's views will be seen as being of critical importance in
gauging sentiment towards the sector.
Stringent cost control measures will have enabled the company to lift
pre-tax profits by as much as 16 per cent to Pounds 250m. The company's
aggressive 'Outstanding Autumn Value' advertising campaign is also likely to
add to its confident mood.
However, M and S's food business, which accounts for 40 per cent of sales,
will have continued to face severe competitive pressures.
Blenheim Group, the exhibitions manager, is expected to announce pre-tax
profits of about Pounds 34m for the year to 31 August when it announces
second interim results on Tuesday.
Analysts will be watching for signs Blenheim's recent rapid growth is
slowing, and for the trading outlook in its important French market.

FT  07 JAN 92 / Technology: Shot in the arm boosts profits - How drug
companies are coming closer to developing an all-in-one vaccine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vaccine production, for long a sleepy sideline of the pharmaceutical
industry, is being rejuvenated through a combination of new technology and
corporate restructuring.
With the help of biotechnology, researchers are developing vaccines for
diseases against which there is no protection today, from malaria to Aids.
At the same time they are working to combine existing vaccines and
ultimately achieve the World Health Organisation's goal of an 'ideal
children's vaccine' which would deliver immunity against all serious
childhood illnesses in a single dose shortly after birth.
The corporate background to vaccine development is changing as fast as the
science, through mergers and alliances which are transforming a patchwork of
national vaccine companies into a handful of global players.
The most important event was the Dollars 785m (Pounds 430m) takeover of
Connaught of Canada by Institut Merieux of France at the end of 1989. That
boosted Merieux's worldwide vaccine sales to Dollars 300m a year - well
ahead of its three leading competitors, Lederle (Cyanamid) and Merck of the
US, and SmithKline Beecham whose vaccine business is based in Belgium.
Together the top four companies account for half of the Dollars 1.3bn a year
world vaccines market.
Meanwhile the single-country vaccine companies are gradually selling out.
For example, Wellcome sold its century-old UK vaccine business to Medeva for
Pounds 20m at the beginning of this year, making Medeva the country's only
commercial vaccine producer.
The next moves on the world stage are likely to be strategic alliances
between the leading companies. Merieux and Merck recently signed a letter of
intent to co-operate on developing and marketing combined childhood vaccines
for the US market and they are waiting for the Federal Trade Commission to
approve the agreement.
'If we get the green light from the FTC, I'm convinced we will then go
further with Merck,' says Alain Merieux, chief executive of the French
company. And there is speculation in the pharmaceutical industry that
Lederle and SmithKline Beecham are planning a vaccines alliance to balance
the link-up between Merieux and Merck.
The primary reason for these alliances, according to Alain Merieux, is that
'the future lies in combined vaccines with multiple antigens'. (Antigens are
the proteins produced by viruses and bacteria which stimulate the immune
system to make protective antibodies.) No single company has enough antigens
to make a good all-in-one vaccine on its own.
Two triple childhood vaccines are already used routinely: DTP against
diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough) and MMR against measles,
mumps and rubella. Jacques Armand, Merieux's vaccine development and
production director, says it will be feasible within two years to expand DTP
into a six-fold vaccine, by adding polio, hepatitis B and haemophilus
influenzae b (the latter is a relatively new vaccine which protects against
a common form of bacterial meningitis).
Researchers are developing methods for combining vaccines in a stable
mixture. 'If there is incompatibility between ingredients, we could use a
dual-barrelled syringe in which some ingredients are kept separate in two
compartments,' Armand adds.
A more serious obstacle to combining childhood vaccines is that the current
strains need to be given at different ages to provoke the best immune
response. It would be impossible for example to add the current measles
vaccine - given at 12 to 15 months - to DTP which is generally given in
three doses at two, three and four months. So the search is on for new
strains that will confer immunity soon after birth.
In the long run, the best hope for a multiple vaccine may lie in genetic
engineering. The favourite approach is to add antigen genes from several
different germs to a single 'Christmas tree' micro-organism. Most
researchers are using viruses of the pox family, which contain large amounts
of genetic material and are therefore attractive targets for genetic
manipulation. They also have a long history as vaccines; the successful WHO
campaign to eradicate smallpox was based on vaccination with cowpox
(vaccinia).
Merieux researchers have chosen canary pox, which normally infects birds, as
their already carried out clinical trials of a new rabies vaccine, made from
canary pox genetically engineered to incorporate rabies antigens.
Animal tests show that a genetically engineered pox vaccine can induce
immunity against several diseases, though the approach is unlikely to
produce a commercial human vaccine for several years. 'A few years ago this
was just a dream, now it's at least part of the way towards reality,' says
Armand.
Multiple vaccines will help the WHO and Unicef (the United Nations
Children's Fund) to achieve their goal of universal childhood vaccination.
Already 80 per cent of the world's children have been immunised against six
leading childhood diseases - measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus,
polio and tuberculosis - compared with only 10 per cent a decade ago. This
has required health workers to make five separate visits and administer
eight doses of vaccine to each child. Combining them into a one-shot vaccine
would bring operational advantages not only to hard-pressed health workers
in the third world but to parents in developed countries who sometimes lose
track of their children's vaccination schedule.
Although the first priority is to improve and combine existing vaccines,
'new vaccines are a close second priority,' says Hiroshi Nakajima, WHO
director-general. Only about 20 diseases have commercially available
vaccines. There are none yet for many diseases that cause widespread death,
including dengue, rotavirus diarrhoea, hepatitis A and E, acute respiratory
infections, meningococcal meningitis, malaria and Aids.
Charles Merieux, honorary chairman of Institut Merieux, believes Aids and
malaria are the two greatest challenges facing the industry. 'An Aids
vaccine is the most exciting scientific challenge and malaria is most
important for helping people,' he says. The worldwide effort to produce a
vaccine against malaria - which kills about 2m people a year, mostly African
children - will be successful within five years, Merieux believes.
Although genetic engineering plays a vital role in making new vaccines,
'there is still plenty of juice left in classical vaccine development,' says
Stanley Plotkin, Merieux medical and scientific director. 'All the different
approaches to an Aids vaccine depend on genetic engineering, but it doesn't
play much of a role in hepatitis A, for example.'
Non-genetic techniques will also improve existing vaccines. WHO is
particularly keen on micro-encapsulation, a new delivery system based on
tiny biodegradable capsules which release vaccine slowly into the
bloodstream in a way that mimics repeated injections.
In the industrialised world, a priority is to produce a new whooping cough
vaccine. The existing one is more likely to provoke damaging side-effects
than any other childhood vaccine. Manufacturers are therefore anxious to
replace the current vaccine, which is based on whole cells of the pertussis
bacteria, with an 'acellular' vaccine containing the most important
antigens.
Although an acellular pertussis vaccine is used routinely in Japan, western
health authorities do not like it because it cannot be administered until
the child is two years old. Large-scale field trials of acellular vaccines
suitable for babies are expected to start in Sweden this year.

Although an acellular pertussis vaccine is used routinely in Japan, western
health authorities do not like it because it cannot be administered until
the child is two years old. Large-scale field trials of acellular vaccines
suitable for babies are expected to start in Sweden this year.

<HEAD>Studies Show Teens Have Greater Resistance To AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teen-agers may be more resistant to the virus
that causes AIDS than other age groups, but they have no better
success in fighting the disease once they get it, according to
research cited in a published report.
   Three recent studies have indicated that teens who are infected
with the AIDS virus are likely to remain free of the disease for
longer than adults or infants, The New York Times reported in its
Sunday editions.
   The Times cited three recent studies of hemophilia patients who
have become infected with the AIDS virus.
   Although the results are preliminary, ``Everything is pointing
in the same direction,'' said Dr. Edward Gomperts of the Children's
Hospital of Los Angeles. ``It is striking.''
   Dr. James Goedert, who is conducting a study at the National
Cancer Institute, said AIDS could resemble chicken pox, measles and
other diseases that are more severe in adults than children.
   ``Whatever controls AIDS in children and teen-agers really needs
to be pursued,'' he said. ``It may have important implications for
treatments and vaccines.''
   In the National Cancer Institute's study of 89 hemophiliacs in
Hershey, Pa., 35 percent of the adults had symptoms of AIDS seven
years after their infection, compared to only 10 percent of those
who were infected as teen-agers.
   In a study Gomperts is conducting at Children's Hospital,
researchers have been keeping track of 30 adult hemophiliacs and 90
adolescents and children who were infected with the virus in the
early 1980s. So far, five of the adults, but only two of the
adolescents and children, have contracted acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   In the third study, the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta
also found greater resistance to the disease among teen-age
hemophilia patients than among adults, Dr. Janine Jason said.
   AIDS is spread most often through sexual contact, contaminated
needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood
products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   As of March 21, 57,024 U.S. cases have been reported to the CDC.
Of those, 31,836, or 56 percent, have died.

FT  02 MAR 92 / Wellcome share offering could raise Pounds 4.5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INTERNATIONAL offering of shares in Wellcome, the drug company best known
for its Aids treatment Retrovir, that could raise more than Pounds 4.5bn at
current prices is expected this summer.
This follows a decision by Wellcome Trust, the medical research charity, to
sell part of its 73.6 per cent stake in the company.
Mr John Robb, chief executive of Wellcome, said last night that the sale
would help investors who had experienced difficulty buying shares because of
the limited number that were freely available.
This view was echoed by Mr Paul Krikler, pharmaceutical analyst at Goldman
Sachs, who said: 'This sale may well go some way to satisfying unfulfilled
investor demand'.
The trust may cut its stake to only 25 per cent, in which case the sale
would raise more than Pounds 4.5bn. However, the offer is subject to market
conditions and to the trust gaining permission from the High Court and the
Charity Commissioners to reduce its holding below 50.1 per cent.
The trust aims to retain at least 25 per cent of the company as a long-term
holding.
Wellcome yesterday confirmed market forecasts that its interim figures, to
be announced on March 26, would show a 30 per cent rise in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 181.2m to not less than Pounds 235m, on sales up from Pounds
731.5m to about Pounds 880m, a 20 per cent improvement. In its last
financial year, to the end of August, the group made pre-tax profits of
Pounds 402.9m.
Mr Robb said he believed the offer would enable Wellcome to build a
shareholder register that more closely matched the international spread of
its business. In its last financial year 44 per cent of sales and a higher
proportion of profits were generated in North America, but less than 5 per
cent of the shares are held there.
The trust has decided that its stake in Wellcome, worth Pounds 7.1bn and
providing 95 per cent of its income, is too great a concentration of its
assets. Wellcome's shares yield only 1.2 per cent and the trust aims to
reinvest the proceeds of the sale to earn a higher return, so making more
funds available for research. The trust is budgeting to spend Pounds 100m on
research this year.
The trust had owned all of Wellcome's shares until the company was floated
on the stock market in February 1986. At that time the whole company was
valued at just over Pounds 1bn. On Friday's closing share price of 1,126p
the capitalisation is Pounds 9.7bn.
The shares have been boosted since flotation by Wellcome's development of
Retrovir, the only widely prescribed treatment for Aids. Wellcome's biggest
selling drug is Zovirax, an anti-viral drug used to treat herpes and
shingles, which has just won approval in the US to treat chicken pox.
Robert Fleming, the merchant bank which arranged the original flotation, has
been appointed to act as global co-ordinator for the offer.

PREP BASKETBALL: RIVAL COACH'S REMARKS INSPIRE AILING LISA LESLIE TO 35 POINTS 
AND 12 REBOUNDS AS THE LADY MONARCHS BEAT BERKELEY, 67-56.

<P>
Morningside High School girls basketball Coach Frank Scott didn't need to give 
his team a pep talk before Saturday's State Division I title game. 
</P>
<P>
Berkeley Coach Gene Nakamura already had seen to that. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by remarks made by Nakamura in a Times' South Bay section story, the 
Lady Monarchs successfully defended their Division I title with a 67-56 victory 
over Berkeley at the Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
In the article, which ran Thursday, Nakamura said that Berkeley was "not awed" 
by Morningside and boasted that Berkeley center Jualeah Woods had "outplayed" 
Morningside's 6-foot-5 Lisa Leslie in a game last year. He also said the 
Yellowjackets planned to play Leslie "head up," without the benefit of a 
special defense. 
</P>
<P>
Scott said he showed the article to his players and brought a copy to Oakland. 
He pulled it out of his clipboard after the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It gave us a little extra motivation," Scott said. "I was shocked that he 
would make those kind of remarks in the newspaper. I showed it to Lisa, and she 
just went into deep meditation right then." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie responded with one of the finest games of her illustrious high school 
career. Despite playing with an undetermined illness, she had 35 points, 12 
rebounds and seven blocked shots. She scored 13 of the Lady Monarchs' last 15 
points after Berkeley had drawn within 52-49 with 4:45 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
"(Nakamura) did a lot of talking," Leslie said. "I think he wanted the 
publicity. It's kind of embarrassing when you start talking before you play." 
</P>
<P>
Nakamura said he didn't regret making his comments. However, he did give Leslie 
credit for making his defensive strategy look inadequate. As it turned out, 
Berkeley didn't have anyone capable of playing the All-American "head up." 
</P>
<P>
"Not too many people can guard that 6-5 girl," he said. "I think she's matured. 
I've seen her when she gets too emotional and gets in foul trouble. She did a 
hell of a job staying under control tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie, who had been plagued by foul trouble in several playoff games, stayed 
out of trouble this time. She didn't pick up her third foul until late in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"She wasn't as aggressive as usual because she wasn't feeling well," Scott 
said. "Maybe that was a blessing in disguise." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie was taken to a hospital after the game as a precautionary measure, 
according to officials at the state championships. Scott said she may be 
suffering from an early case of the chicken pox. Leslie's younger sister had 
the chicken pox two or three weeks ago, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie's illness was reflected in the lack of emotion she showed during the 
game, but it didn't detract from her performance. After Berkeley cut 
Morningside's lead to three points in the fourth quarter, Leslie scored four 
straight baskets to ice the game. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was worried when Berkeley made its move behind point guard Tanda 
Rucker (25 points, including three three-point shots), Scott replied: "We still 
had Lisa in the game. Anytime we have her in the game, I feel confident." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie was able to stay out of foul trouble, but Berkeley wasn't as fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
Woods, the Yellowjackets' 6-foot center, picked up her third foul early in the 
second quarter and her fourth with 5:08 left in the third period. Both times, 
she was benched for several minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"The calls were not going our way," Nakamura said. "If they had gone the 
opposite way, you might have seen a different outcome." 
</P>
<P>
Morningside also received a strong inside game from 6-4 sophomore forward Janet 
Davis, who had 14 points and seven rebounds, and from forward Akiba Flanagan, 
who had a game-high 15 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Monarchs never trailed after reeling off 15 unanswered points to take 
a 23-12 lead early in the second quarter. Davis had six points during the run 
and Leslie scored five. 
</P>
<P>
Berkeley had little success shooting over Morningside's 2-3 zone, making only 
24 of 87 field-goal attempts for 27.6%.

TOXIC SHOCK IN CHILDREN RE-EMERGING, OFFICIALS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: MANY CIVIL WAR SOLDIERS DIED FROM THE COMPLICATIONS OF SEVERE 
INFECTIONS. STILL RARE IN CHILDREN, CASES HAVE BECOME MORE COMMON IN THE LAST 
FIVE YEARS, WITH A SECOND REPORTED IN SAN DIEGO.

<P>
The streptococcus bacterium that invaded the body of a young girl with 
chickenpox, provoking a toxic-shock reaction that led to the amputation of her 
arms and legs, has been found recently in other children, medical officials 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Benjamin Schwartz, with the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, said 
cases in which "strep" has triggered toxic shock in children have occurred 
elsewhere in the country recently, although none have been reported in medical 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, something like this can cause a lot of panic," Schwartz said. 
"Toxic-shock syndrome from streptococcus infections does occur in children, and 
has, although it's very, very rare. They're often related to wounds or other 
skin infections and occasionally occur following pneumonia." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Children's Hospital said this week that the strain of streptococcus 
bacteria found in 6-year-old Jessica Lynn Esquivel had never been seen in a 
child in San Diego or in any documented case in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Jessica, who was admitted April 1 with what was first believed to be a routine 
case of chickenpox, experienced full cardiac arrest, in addition to kidney, 
liver and respiratory failure. On April 18, her legs were amputated at the 
knee, and her arms at the elbow. 
</P>
<P>
A kindergarten student from Imperial Beach, Jessica remains in critical 
condition in the intensive care unit of Children's Hospital. However, Dr. Brad 
Peterson, the physician supervising her care, said he expects her to have full 
liver, kidney and respiratory recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another instance of a San Diego child incurring toxic-shock syndrome 
in conjunction with a case of chickenpox was reported to The Times and verified 
by Children's Hospital on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, 3-year-old Lauren Arnsdorff had to have the tip of her index finger 
amputated and she suffered lung damage. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Marian Melish, professor of pediatrics at the University of Hawaii School 
of Medicine, said cases in which strep infections in children have led to 
serious and sometimes fatal consequences have occurred with greater regularity 
in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
Melish characterized their re-emergence as having a " 'Back to the Future'-like 
effect," not unlike cases that were widely reported during the Civil War and in 
the 1910s and 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
"Complications resulting from chickenpox -- in which the child incurs a 
secondary bacterial infection -- range from the trivial to the severe to the 
fatal," said Melish, who once taught in the pediatrics department of the UC San 
Diego School of Medicine. "Streptococcus and staphylococcus bacteria are 
considered ubiquitous, meaning they're everywhere and can enter a person's body 
any time the skin is broken. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're one of the unlucky few to incur such an infection, the results can 
be devastating and often carry a grim inevitability. In other words, it's very 
hard to rescue people from these things, especially when they lead to toxic 
shock." 
</P>
<P>
Melish said severe streptococcus infections were common during the Civil War, 
killing hundreds of soldiers, and later in history, especially the early part 
of the century. 
</P>
<P>
For whatever reason, she said they're beginning to re-emerge, particularly in 
cases of toxic shock. The lesions caused by chickenpox are just one way the 
bacteria can enter the body. She said any cut can serve as a gateway. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a real 'Back to the Future'-type link here," Melish said. "We're 
seeing a return to the type of strep as dangerous as those in the '40s, the 
1910s, and earlier." 
</P>
<P>
The good news for parents, Melish said, is that a chickenpox vaccine is now in 
the hands of the Food and Drug Administration and may be licensed within a few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knows how far away it is, but they (FDA researchers) seem convinced 
that it can be safe and effective," she said. "I'd say it's only a matter of 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Anne Schuchat, with the Centers for Disease Control, said toxic-shock 
syndrome, regardless of the cause, is "an uncommon occurrence," having been 
reported, as an annual average, in "five cases per 1 million population." 
</P>
<P>
"Fifty-five to 60% of all toxic shock is menstrual toxic shock, the classic 
kind associated with tampons during a menstrual period," Schuchat said. "The 
rest is associated with a number of conditions. These can occur in any time of 
skin lesion -- boils, abscesses or pox-like sores. 
</P>
<P>
"Toxic shock is quite rare, and having it associated with a single condition 
like chickenpox is extremely rare. We've had very few reports of pediatric 
toxic-shock syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Lynn Arnsdorff, a San Diego mother, said her 3-year-old daughter, 
Lauren, incurred toxic shock syndrome following chickenpox last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Arnsdorff said Lauren, a patient at Children's Hospital, ended up having the 
tip of her index finger amputated and incurred minor lung damage, mainly from 
prolonged exposure to the respirator needed to help her breathe during her 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
Children's Hospital officials confirmed this week that Lauren Arnsdorff was a 
patient and a victim of toxic shock. 
</P>
<P>
"But the organism that caused the syndrome was different from that of 
Jessica's," said Mark Morelli, a hospital spokesman. "Lauren's was a 
staphylococcus bacteria, rather than the streptococcus bacteria Jessica had. 
While the shock syndromes were somewhat the same, the organism that affected 
Jessica was far more virulent." 
</P>
<P>
Arnsdorff said her daughter, who had a high fever and was having seizures, was 
taken to Children's on Sept. 8. Two nights later, the symptoms got worse. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us she would not survive the day," Arnsdorff said. "She had heart 
failure, swelling, she was totally puffed up. They put her on massive doses of 
heart medication, but her kidneys failed. 
</P>
<P>
"Although she had the chickenpox, they think she might have gotten toxic shock 
as a result of a tiny little scrape on her toe -- not a pox scrape, but one she 
had before," although doctors aren't certain of the cause. 
</P>
<P>
"We shuddered when we heard about Jessica," Arnsdorff said. "It was like this 
grim deja vu. We were told that it was so rare, in Lauren's case; it might 
never happen again. But, of course, it did, and with this poor child (Jessica), 
it was much, much worse."

   Share-price gyrations and weekend news reports fueled
speculation that a giant secondary stock offering in British
drugmaker Wellcome PLC may be imminent.
   London's Sunday Times reported yesterday that the Wellcome
Trust, a charitable foundation that controls Wellcome, will
announce plans today to decrease its voting stake to 50% from
the current 75%. At prevailing market prices, a public
offering of the Trust's 25% stake would be valued at about
#2.5 billion ($4.41 billion), individuals acquainted with the
situation said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yesterday, a Wellcome spokesman declined to comment on the
news reports.
   On Friday, Wellcome's stock climbed nine pence to 1126
pence a share in heavy trading on London markets. Analysts
initially attributed the price jump to the long-awaited
announcement on Friday that the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration has approved Wellcome's anti-viral medicine,
Zovirax, for treatment of chicken pox. But some analysts
suggested that rumors of a possible Wellcome Trust share sale
also were heating up in London by week's end.

WORRIED SICK OVER ILL KIDS; 
</P>
<P>
SPECIAL DAY-CARE CENTERS GIVE PARENTS AN UNDERUSED OPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With schools opening in Los Angeles and throughout California next week, it's 
time for the fall migration -- the migration of the common cold from home to 
classroom and back. 
</P>
<P>
It's also the time when working parents begin worrying about finding care for 
their kids who are too sick to go to school. 
</P>
<P>
This dilemma of the virus season results in employee absenteeism and turmoil in 
the family, yet the idea of day-care centers for children who have minor 
childhood illnesses is moving slowly in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Even where sick-child centers do exist, they aren't always successful. Two in 
downtown Los Angeles closed last year for lack of usage, apparently because 
parents preferred to stay home with their sick children, the operators say. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 70 centers have emerged nationwide over the last eight years, with 
about 700 slots to fill a need that is estimated at 350,000 children daily, 
according to the National Assn. for Sick Child Day Care. 
</P>
<P>
There are at least 19 million children in the United States younger than 14 
whose parents work full time outside the home and who have no one at home 
during the day, according to a 1986 report by the U.S. Bureau of Labor 
Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Families Coping 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, most families are coping by having the parent stay at home with the 
sick child," said Carla Rayacich, president of a company that is opening a new 
center for sick children in the Silicon Valley community of Sunnyvale this 
week. Rayacich said research by the sick child day-care association estimates 
the annual cost to U.S. business of these absences at $7 billion to $10 
billion, even larger than the cost to employers of illnesses of the workers 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Parents who have to be at work may take their sick children to school or 
regular day care anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"People load the kid up with Tylenol and drop them off, and then they know 
they'll get at least three hours at work before the day-care center calls," 
Rayacich said. 
</P>
<P>
Jamar Schoessow, a school nurse at John Muir and Will Rogers elementary schools 
in Santa Monica, said she sends home about six children a day during the peak 
of the viral season. 
</P>
<P>
Because a child with a common cold is most contagious just before getting 
symptoms, there is no requirement to keep him home if he doesn't have a fever, 
according to California health guidelines for schools. But the misery index 
often brings these children to the nurse's office to lie down and get a little 
TLC, Schoessow said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem has increased particularly in the last two years, she said, since 
her district began accepting students who live outside its boundaries but whose 
parents work in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"They bring their kids sick because the parents work in Santa Monica and come 
from so far, and have no one close by," Schoessow said. "I sometimes keep these 
kids in school the whole day sick -- really sick. Then they come back (to 
school) too soon because the parents have to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand that, because these people who have these jobs are people who 
have worked hard to get where they are. And they need to have a steady job." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Juggling Responsibilities 
</P>
<P>
This juggling of work and child-rearing places enormous strain on parents and 
children, Rayacich said, using the poignant story of a 5-year-old to 
illustrate. 
</P>
<P>
While visiting a center for sick children, Rayacich said, she asked the boy how 
he liked the center and how it compared to having his mother take time off work 
to care for him at home. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it (the center) fine," the boy told her. "It's more fun. I'm not as 
lonely and Mommy doesn't cry." 
</P>
<P>
Sheri Senter, president of National Pediatric Support Services, an Irvine 
company that operates Rainbow Retreat sick-child units in Pasadena, Huntington 
Beach and Newport Beach, said she believes parents are just beginning to 
consider such facilities as an option. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a learning curve," Senter said. "In every needs assessment that we do for 
corporations, sick-child care is coming back number one. People can't miss any 
more days of work. And we're seeing children enter group care at a younger age, 
so they're getting sick more frequently." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the 15-bed center sponsored by Transamerica Life Cos. at the California 
Medical Center in downtown Los Angeles closed in June, 1988, after two years 
because it was never more than one-third occupied, said Sandy Comrie, vice 
president for human resources for the company. 
</P>
<P>
A two-bed unit at the California Pediatric and Family Medical Center, a 
downtown clinic, saw almost no usage so it closed in April, 1988, after eight 
months of operation. 
</P>
<P>
Such problems generally result from not getting the word out to parents, from 
not answering their questions about the concept and from setting up barriers to 
usage, Senter and Rayacich said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Common Questions 
</P>
<P>
The most common parental questions, according to Rayacich: 
</P>
<P>
* How do the centers prevent the spread of disease from child to child? (Toys 
are kept separate, and each child has his own bed with clean linens. Children 
with diseases such as chicken pox are isolated, though some centers won't take 
chicken pox cases.) 
</P>
<P>
* What are the procedures for bringing the child in? (Usually, a phone call at 
least an hour ahead of time to reserve space is required.) 
</P>
<P>
* Should registration forms be filled out ahead of time? (It saves time to do 
this, and also gives a chance for parent and child to tour the center.) 
</P>
<P>
* Does the child need to go to the doctor first? (Some hospital-based centers 
have pediatricians who examine all the children, either for the same fee as an 
office visit or sometimes free. They also will do throat cultures or other 
routine tests. Requiring parents to take the child to the doctor first takes so 
much time that parents tend not to use the sick-child center, Rayacich said.) 
</P>
<P>
* How much does it cost? (Senter's facilities charge $5 a hour to the public, 
$3.50 an hour for corporate-sponsored clients or regular day-care students. 
Torrance Memorial Hospital and Northridge Hospital Medical Center charge $3 and 
$3.25 an hour, respectively. Rayacich's new center in Sunnyvale, called Feeling 
Better Health Day Care, will charge $39 a day.) 
</P>
<P>
Most of the centers are attached to hospital pediatric units and help the 
hospitals build good will as well as fill space. Senter said she believes 
hospitals aren't the best environment for children who are only moderately ill, 
but hospitals can keep down the cost of care by piggybacking the sick-child 
units on existing facilities. Day-care centers can't do that, so they find 
sick-child units too costly, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rayacich's Feeling Better center is expanding the sick-child center concept 
outside of hospital and day-care center, into a free-standing facility just for 
ill children. With 42 beds, it is four times the size of the average unit 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Model for Other Centers 
</P>
<P>
Funded by a group of socially conscious investors, she said, Feeling Better is 
intended as a model for establishment of similar centers around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Given the right promotion, a hospital's sick-child unit becomes an essential 
part of the community, said Betty Nosbisch, director of pediatrics at Covenant 
Medical Center in Waterloo, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
The five-bed Sick Bay child center at Covenant will be five years old this 
fall, Nosbisch said, and "a lot of families have come to depend on us." 
</P>
<P>
One of these parents is Susie Schwieger, assistant director of placement at the 
University of Northern Iowa. Her daughter Anne, 6, and son Matthew, 4, have 
been going to Sick Bay for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Her own traditional upbringing made taking the children there for the first 
time difficult, Schwieger said. "I asked myself, 'Am I abandoning my children 
when they're ill?' " she said. "I grew up in a really traditional home where my 
mom didn't work outside the home. So when we were sick she was there constantly 
at our bedside." 
</P>
<P>
But when the children obviously enjoyed the experience, Schwieger's fears -- 
and guilt -- vanished.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Appeal by Aspirin Maker in Wisconsin Reyes Syndrome
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
an aspirin manufacturer being sued for $10 million by the parents of
a child who contracted Reyes Syndrome.
   The court, without comment, let stand a Wisconsin judge's order
that the maker of Bayer aspirin reveal numerous company records.
   Sterling Drug Inc. said forcing it to turn over some of the
documents violates its free-speech and due-process rights.
   The documents include communications between the corporation and
its lawyers, and between the corporation and a trade association
called the Aspirin Foundation of America.
   A state judge in Milwaukee ruled last November that the company
was not entitled to withhold the documents.
   ``Release of this information will define and narrow the issues
to be tried, increase the chances for settlement and allow for a
fully informed resolution of the case,'' Judge Gary A. Gerlach said.
   Gary and Judith Fox sued Sterling Drug, alleging that their
daughter, Jacqueline, contracted Reyes Syndrome after taking Bayer
aspirin in October 1981 at the age of 10 months.
   Reyes Syndrome, first observed in the 1950s, causes severe
vomiting and lethargy and can lead to coma and death. It usually
occurs in children who have had a bout with a viral illness such as
influenza or chicken pox.
   The U.S. Center for Disease Control said in May that reported
cases of the syndrome reached their lowest level this year _ 20
cases _ since the syndrome was discovered.
   Aspirin containers were first required to carry warnings that
aspirin may cause Reyes Syndrome in 1986.
   The case is Sterling Drug vs. Circuit Court of Milwaukee, 88-1691.

<HEAD>Hmong Resisting Warnings About Lead In Folk Medicine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Folk medicines for ailments such as fever and
chicken pox are contributing to a high rate of lead poisoning among
Hmong children, officials say.
   Last year, the Southeast Asian children made up more than 60
percent of the lead poisoning cases reported to the city public
health division. In the first several months of this year, eight of
13 cases were Hmong, the division said.
   While health officials attribute most of the cases to
environmental factors, such as lead paint chips in old housing and
contaminated soil, they say the Hmong's use of medicinal powders is
a contributing factor.
   Over the past six years, tests of medicinal powders used by some
Hmong families found some with high levels of lead and arsenic,
including one batch containing 90 percent lead, said Tim Ringhand,
a public health nurse.
   Despite warnings, Hmong parents continue using the medicine
because they find it hard to believe their children are in danger,
officials said. There is no Hmong word for lead and effects of lead
poisoning don't show up for years.
   ``For Hmong people, it's not because they're not caring of their
children,'' said Pam Thao, a bilingual health assistant. ``The
problem is they're too protecting. They don't trust outsiders.''
   Some members of the Hmong community said the studies linking
lead to their medicinal powders are an attack on their culture.
   ``We've been using the medicine for years, long before the birth
of this country,'' said Nkajlo Vangh, president of Lao Family
Community of Minnesota. ``I'd like to get a second opinion.''
   Health officials said have no firm idea of how prevalent the
medicinanl powders are because few families admit to using them.
   ``If they took away my Tylenol in (Laos) and gave me powders,
then I'd be angry too. I'd hide my Tylenol,'' Ringhand said.

<LEADPARA>  ONCE upon a time people thought they caught colds from being outdoors, and the
best remedy was chicken soup. Then science came along and proved both notions
wrong.;    Scientists know a lot more about colds these days, including the
200-odd cold viruses now known to be the culprits that make us miserable with
sniffles, sneezes, wheezes and stuffy noses. But science still hasn't done
much to help us feel better when one of these rotten little viruses takes up
residence in our nasal passages.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In fact, yet another time-honored tradition for treating colds is under
assault these days: aspirin and other pain relievers. A study has found that
taking aspirin, acetaminophen or ibuprofen may actually do more harm than good
in getting rid of a cold.;    Since these three pain-relievers are found in
many of the common over-the-counter cold remedies, this constitutes a broad
indictment of some of the most popular potions for relieving the miseries of a
cold. They are found in such products as Tylenol, Anacin, Advil and Contac
Severe Cold Formula.;    Is nothing sacred? Even aspirin?;    "I wouldn't take
it unless you had a headache or a high fever," says Dr. Neil M.H. Graham of
Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. "There's no point in
suffering, is there?";    In a study of 56 people infected with a common cold
virus, some given pain relievers and others placebos, Graham found those given
aspirin or acetaminophen had a weaker immune response to the infection and
produced fewer antibodies to the cold virus. Those given ibuprofen showed the
same pattern, although milder.;    Those taking the active drugs also felt
worse. Graham dutifully measured and rated all their dreadful symptoms, and
described them in most scientific terms: "nasal obstruction" for stuffy noses,
"cervical adenitis" for swollen neck lymph glands, "turbinate swelling" for
swollen mucus membranes and -- perhaps most important -- "mean mucus weight,"
the amount of nasal gunk produced by each afflicted soul.;    The amount of
nasal gunk produced seemed to be prolific no matter what they took.;    Graham
found those taking aspirin were significantly more miserable with stuffy noses
and swollen mucus membranes than those taking the placebos. The same pattern,
although milder, held for those taking acetaminophen and ibuprofen.;    "The
nose symptoms were significantly worse in the aspirin and acetaminophen
group," Graham says. "I think it is related to the immune response.";    Those
taking the active drugs also showed somewhat higher levels of cold virus
"shedding" -- the amount of virus coming out of their noses -- although not
enough to make it statistically significant. Nevertheless, Graham thinks the
remedies may do more harm than good.;    "We think there might be a mechanism
by which these drugs suppress the immune response," Graham says.;    Graham's
study is not the first to find evidence that aspirin or other painkillersmay
worsen some illnesses. One 1989 study, done by others at Johns Hopkins, found
children given acetaminophen (the active ingredient in Tylenol) took longer
than others to recover from chicken pox.;    An even earlier study, done in
1975, found cold sufferers given aspirin had higher levels of virus shedding
than non-aspirin takers.;    Laboratory studies of aspirin and ibuprofen have
shown mixed results, with some suggesting the drugs enhance immune response
and others showing the drugs inhibit immune response.;    Graham says the
study is important not only for cold sufferers, but for the children of
developing countries who are vulnerable to serious illness from upper
respiratory infections. Those children may be weak from malnutrition and
diarrhea, and any suppression of their immune system can be harmful. Upper
respiratory infections are the No. 1 killer of infants in developing
countries, Graham says.;    But not all cold experts are convinced Graham's
study is right. Dr. Jack Gwaltney, who has studied cold viruses for 26 years,
says some studies have found aspirin and other painkillers may help.;   
"There is no question they have an effect on headache and malaise, or just
feeling bad," says Gwaltney, head of epidemiology and virology at the
University of Virginia at Charlottesville. He describes Graham's study as
"preliminary" and says it had too few patients to be considered conclusive.;  
 Despite the fact that Americans spend more than $2 billion a year on cold
remedies, Gwaltney says, research on their effects is scant. "The work is
fairly limited," he says.;    One of the newest notions in cold research is
that the symptoms of misery -- stuffy nose, scratchy throat and mucus build-up
-- are caused not by the cold virus itself, but by other substances produced
in reaction to the virus. Called kinins, these substances may be the best
targets for a new generation of cold remedies.;    "We think they stimulate
the release of inflammatory compounds," Gwaltney says. The inflammatory
compounds, in turn, cause the familiar runny or stuffed noses, sore throat and
heavy mucus that make a cold so mean.;    Gwaltney and Graham say the best
cold remedies are the ones that treat individual symptoms, rather than the
combination remedies that aim to alleviate several symptoms at once.;    In
some cases, the combination remedies have contradictory effects that may
cancel each other out. One ingredient may tend to dry out mucus secretions
while another may try to drain the mucus that has already clogged nasal
passages.;    Folk remedies such as chicken soup, however popular, don't get a
lot of respect from any of the cold virus researchers.;    "Above the
Mason-Dixon line, the remedy was chicken soup," Gwaltney says. "Below the
Mason-Dixon line, it was bourbon whiskey.;    "Neither one of those have any
truly beneficial effect."  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  THE buildup of chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere appears to be slowing for
the first time since the compounds came under attack as destroyers of the
planet's protective ozone layer, says one of the scientists who first
identified the problem.;   "It's a tough call," says F. Sherwood Rowland, a
chemistry professor at the University of California, Irvine. The slowdown
noted in the past year is tiny and "very difficult to measure. . . . But
there's definitely a slowdown." He says it appears that the annual growth in
atmospheric chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, is down by several tenths of a
percent.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  Steroid danger; Patients being treated with steroid drugs may be at increased
risk of severe, possibly fatal infections if they are exposed to chicken pox
or measles, the Food and Drug Administration warned Monday.;   The FDA told
makers of corticosteroid drugs to warn doctors of the potentially serious
complication by relabeling the drugs, which can suppress the immune system.
The steroids are commonly prescribed for children to treat such chronic
conditions as asthma, allergies and juvenile arthritis.; Epilepsy risk; Some
experts have believed that children stricken by convulsions with a high fever
are at significant risk of developing epilepsy, but a British study suggests
that the risk actually is as low as 2.5 in 100.  </TEXT>
