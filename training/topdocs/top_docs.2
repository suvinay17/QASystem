<HEAD>Lower Prices for Spices Reported as Pepper Loses Ground</HEAD>

   The cost of importing pepper and other spices
favored by Americans as food seasonings has tumbled sharply, but
it's still nothing to sneeze at, says the Agriculture Department.
   Last year's import bill was $349.4 million for 191,545 metric
tons of assorted spices, ranging from allspice and anise to
turmeric and vanilla beans. That was down from a record $438.6
million and 208,694 tons in 1987.
   ``It's not an indication that the trend in spice consumption is
being reversed,'' says Rex Dull of the department's Foreign
Agricultural Service. ``Rather, it was a technical correction ...
primarily involving pepper imports.''
   Pepper is the biggest item on the U.S. list of spice imports.
Most is black pepper but there is a substantial amount of white. In
1988, unground black pepper imports were valued at $95.2 million
for 26,939 tons, compared with $147.8 million for 31,372 tons in
1987.
   Indonesia was the biggest supplier last year, followed by India
and Brazil.
   Some relief for the pepper supply was provided in January by the
Food and Drug Administration when it eased an 18-month-old policy
of automatic detention of shipments from India until those had been
checked for possible salmonella contamination. The Indian
government can now certify that pepper meets FDA standards.
   Dull, who works in the agency's horticultural and tropical
products division, said in a recent telephone interview that for
several years global pepper supplies were tight and prices high.
   In 1987, for example, the price of Indonesian black pepper was a
12-month average of just over $2.37 per pound delivered to New York
City. Indian black pepper was almost as high.
   ``There was anticipation that the supply would improve and
prices come down,'' Dull said. ``Prices did come down in part of
1988, but there was fear that drought would reduce India's harvest
and they came back up late in the year.''
   But the increase wasn't nearly as great as the runup of pepper
prices in the mid-1980s. Until September 1985, the New York spot
price of Indian black pepper was less than a dollar per pound.
   Last October, the New York price dropped to an average for the
month of 99.5 cents, the first time in more than three years that
it had been less than a dollar. However, prices quickly regained
lost ground and in March averaged $1.59 per pound.
   Dull is the author of the USDA agency's latest annual report on
1988 spice trade. The report, issued this week, noted that while
pepper was the main reason for reduced imports, there were other
items also affected.
   ``High prices and producer-government controlled marketing
practices have tempered the demand for cassia, nutmeg and mace,''
the report said. ``Smaller crops have resulted in higher prices for
mustard seed, saffron, sesame seed, paprika and Pakistani chili
peppers.''
   Prices of anise, cloves and Java vanilla beans were down,
however, the report said.

   Soybean farmers like to think of foreign
buyers in giant terms, like Japan or Western Europe, but an
Agriculture Department report suggests a shrimp can be a pretty
good customer, too.
   Daryl A. Brehm, U.S. agricultural attache in Jakarta, Indonesia,
says there is a promising outlook for selling more U.S. soybeans to
that Southeast Asian country to feed an expanding shrimp industry.
   ``Exports (of shrimp) are rising, and the potential for
increased production barely has been scratched,'' Brehm says in the
forthcoming May issue of AgExporter magazine published by the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service.
   ``More efficient production methods would call for increased
soybean and soybean meal imports, which make up a portion of
commercial shrimp feeds,'' he said. ``U.S. exports of these items
to Indonesia could benefit from this modernization.''
   The country now has about 250,000 hectares of brackish shrimp
ponds, with a potential to expand to 3 million hectares, and fresh
water ponds _ now covering only 33,000 hectares _ could expand to 1
million, Brehm said. A hectare is about 2.47 acres.
   Indonesian shrimp exports were worth more than $300 million last
year, with Japan taking about 80 percent. And, even with declining
international prices, ``returns from well-managed production are
lucrative, with reports of 100 percent profits not uncommon,'' he
said.
   The American Soybean Association has been providing technical
help to Indonesian shrimp farmers, advocating ``a semi-intensive
system that requires a relatively small capital outlay,'' Brehm
said. A relatively low-cost pelleted feed could be used.
   At present, less than 10 percent of the Indonesian shrimp
farmers used a commercial feed. The association concluded that a
lower-cost feed and education programs could revolutionize the
production of shrimp in Indonesia _ and boost the sales of U.S.
soybeans.

   Peter C. Myers, the No. 2 official at the
Agriculture Department, plans to work for the National Pork
Producers Council in its capital office.
   Myers, 58, will join the council on May 8 as its Washington
executive director of public affairs, the trade association said
Monday. The council represents the nation's hog producers on a wide
range of lobbying and regulatory issues.
   Myers was a farmer in Missouri before joining USDA as head of
the Soil Conservation Service in 1982. He later served as an
assistant secretary and has served as deputy secretary since June
1986.

<F P=106> [Report by Salih Qallab: "Reports of Disagreements Among </F>
Northern Leaders. Hard-Liners Insist on Fighting to the End"]
  [Text] Amman -- A senior Yemeni official has said over the
telephone from Sanaa that a sharp disagreement has erupted among
senior northern leaders over the mission of the UN secretary
general's envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, and the proposal he submitted
two days ago to hold a meeting in Cairo between Sanaa and Aden
delegations.
  The official said that the disagreement necessitated holding
an emergency meeting under Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah
Salih. It was attended by Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar,
speaker of the House of Representatives, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid
al-Zindani, and 'Abdallah al-Anisi, representing the Yemeni
Reform Grouping [YRG]; and by Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Dr.
Muhammad Sa'id al-'Attar, and Colonel 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar,
representing the General People's Congress [GPC].
  The official said that a severe disagreement dominated the
meeting, and that Dr. al-Iryani was the first speaker, maybe in
coordination with President 'Ali Salih. And that he -- that is,
al-Iryani -- stressed that Sanaa has tried everything to resolve
the situation, and it is impossible for things to continue in
this manner forever.
  According to the Yemeni official, al-Iryani stressed that
his
country has become isolated and has lost the support of
neighboring states and numerous Arab states. And that it has
been placed in the category of Iraq and Iraqi President Saddam
Husayn -- which will lead it into an unenviable situation.
  Al-Iryani proposed that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih
personally make an Arab tour to include neighboring states,
Egypt, and some other states in order to break what he termed
the political siege imposed on Sanaa. He also proposed that
southern [as published] deputies make an Arab tour to explain
the northern Yemeni capital's view of the ongoing war.
  The Yemeni official stressed that the YRG leaders -- Shaykh
al-Ahmar, 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anisi, and Dr. al-Zindani, supported
by Col. Muhsin al-Ahmar -- rejected the idea of sending a
delegation to Cairo and insisted on continuing the fighting and
not responding to the UN mediation. They said that Aden is now
in their grasp and that any cease-fire is going to make them
lose the military battle after having lost the political battle.
  The official pointed out that President Salih is in an
unenviable mental situation. That he has made great efforts to
persuade senior members of his leadership to send a northern
delegation to Cairo. And that he threatened to boycott the
meeting before the participants agreed to his proposal in this
connection.
  The Yemeni official noted that the delegation Sanaa sent to
Cairo has a partisan and not an official capacity -- which means
that the northern leadership insists that the dialogue with the
southerners must remain within the framework that existed before
the eruption of the fighting, as discussions were conducted
between the GPC and the YRG on the one hand and the Yemeni
Socialist Party on the other.

received Arthur Hayden Hughes, the U.S. ambassador to our
country. During the meeting, they reviewed the friendly
bilateral ties and the means of promoting them. They also
discussed the efforts currently under way to establish a
cease-fire.
  The ambassador reiterated the U.S. position that what is
taking place in the Republic of Yemen must be handled in
accordance with the provisions enshrined in UN Security Council
Resolution 924, within the framework of the Republic of Yemen,
and with the inalienable rights guaranteed to all members of the
world body by the UN Charter, chief among which are the member
states' rights to sovereignty, independence, and territorial
integrity, as well as the inadmissibility of interference in
their domestic affairs. He added that any handling of the
situation in the Republic of Yemen outside this framework would
prolong the conflict and hamper the urgent solutions required to

region at large.
  For his part, Deputy Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anisi
reiterated the Republic of Yemen's appreciation of U.S. efforts,

You've finally found a Chinese restaurant that you're sure is authentic and you

  [Text] The Political Forces Dialogue Committee [PFDC] has
approved a statement and a decision was made to broadcast it
yesterday, 14 Ramadan [24 February]. Regrettably, however, the
PFDC rapporteur was informed that it would not be broadcast.
The PFDC, which regrets this, hopes that this will not be
repeated. Following is the text of the statement:
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.
Statement issued by the PFDC:
  The PFDC's meeting last night continued until a later hour.
The committee continued its meeting this morning to review the
developments in the national arena, particularly the serious
political and media deterioration. The continuation of such
deterioration will expose the homeland to serious dangers.
  The PFDC had hoped that with the final signing of the
document in Amman all parties would move ahead to implement its
provisions and that the committee would then embark on its tasks
represented by following up and supervising the implementation.
However, it was surprised to see the continuous military and
media escalation.
  As the PFDC condemns these irresponsible acts, it appeals to
the political and military leaders in the state to shoulder
their national responsibilities, to take firm and swift measures
to contain the situation, and to stop the escalation. It also
asks the competent quarters to expeditiously hold investigations
into what took place, to name those responsible, to reveal this
to the people, and to return the military situation to normal.
  All parties must shoulder this historic responsibility
before
God, the people, and our Arab and Islamic nation and be equal to
it unaffected by narrow considerations.
  The PFDC appeals to the people from all walks of life to
stand against any action that threatens the homeland's unity and
safety and to foil the attempts of the advocates of sedition who
aim at harming the homeland.
  The PFDC decided to form follow-up committees as follows:
  1. To set up a military-political committee to follow up the
efforts aimed at halting the deterioration. The committee
comprises: Shaykh Sinan Abu-Luhum, Brigadier General Mujahid
Abu- Shawarib, 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anisi, Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim
al-Iryani, Jarallah 'Umar, Dr. Qasim Sallam, Colonel Husayn
Sharaf (?al-Kifri), and Ahmad Jabir 'Afif.
  2. To set up a media committee which comprises:
'Abd-al-Malik Mansur, Abu-Bakr Badhib, 'Abd-al-Qadir
(?al-Qiyari), Dr. Muhammad 'Abd-al-Malik al-Mutawwakil, and
Muhammad Rawah Sa'id.
  3. To set up a security committee which comprises:
Brigadier General Ghalib (?Mutahhir) al-Qamashya, Colonel Ahmad
al-Himsi, Colonel Ahmad Salim 'Ubayd, Colonel 'Ali Qasim
al-Mansur, Colonel 'Ali Ahmad al-Hubaysi, and Colonel 'Abdallah
Ahmad al-Kibsi.
  The PFDC also decided to hold its next meeting in the Abyan
Governorate on Saturday and to address a message to the prime
minister to remind him of the dates fixed in the accord document
which begin immediately after its signing in accordance with the
provisions of the document.
  We ask Almighty God to preserve Yemen -- land and people --
and to protect us from harm. God is our best supporter.
  [Signed] The Popular Forces Dialogue Committee, Sanaa
  [Dated] 24 February 1994

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,
Presidential Council chairman, this morning received brother
Colonel Mustafa al-Kharrubi, member of the Revolution Command
Council and inspector general in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah.
The Libyan envoy conveyed to the brother chairman a message
from his brother Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the
Libyan 1 September revolution. The message deals with the
brotherly and militant relations between the two countries, as
well as issues and developments of interest to the Arab nation.
The message also deals with the current developments in our
country and the efforts being exerted by brother Mu'ammar
al-Qadhdhafi and other brothers in Libya to bring views closer
and to heal the rift in the Yemeni ranks in order to maintain
the march of unity, democracy, and stability in Yemen. The
message stresses the Libyan brothers' eagerness to support all
efforts and do whatever is possible to contain the current
political crisis in our country, to halt its regrettable
repercussions, and to stand by our people to surmount the
current challenges and maintain Yemeni unity, which is a major
pan-Arab gain and a model for realizing the Arab masses' dreams
of Arab unity.
  During the meeting, the two sides reviewed their brotherly
bilateral relations, the developments of the situation in our
country in light of the efforts being exerted by the military
committee to halt the regrettable military developments, and the
efforts being exerted to begin implementation of the accord
document. Those efforts are designed to end the crisis and
enable the state's constitutional institutions to resume their
responsibilities so that they can move collectively to implement
the contents of the document in a manner that ensures its
success, achieves the national aspirations for a modern Yemeni
state, and entrenches unity and democracy in our country.
  During the meeting, the Presidential Council chairman
expressed thanks and appreciation for the efforts, the sincere
fraternal sentiments, and the outstanding pan-Arab eagerness of
his brother Col. Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi and other brothers in
Libya to help their brothers in Yemen to maintain Yemeni unity.
He noted that the brothers in Libya had a pioneering and
positive role in enhancing the march of unity from the outset
and in supporting all the steps and efforts toward unity that
led to the establishment of the Republic of Yemeni and the
restoration of Yemeni unity on 22 May 1990. He indicated that
Yemeni unity is a pan-Arab accomplishment and an Arab enterprise
of interest to all advocates of unity and good in the Arab
homeland. He added that maintaining this unity is a pan-Arab as
well as a Yemeni responsibility. He emphasized that whatever
the challenges and difficulties, our Yemeni people will maintain
their unity in order to fulfill their aspirations for progress.
  The Presidential Council chairman asked Col. Mustafa
al-Kharrubi to convey an oral message to his brother Col.
Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi. He wished the fraternal Libyan people
continued prosperity.
  The meeting was attended by brother 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anisi,
Yemeni deputy prime minister; Ahmad Ba-al-Khayl, Libyan under
secretary for foreign liaison and international cooperation; and
brother Sartawi Yusuf, charge d'affaires of the Libyan
brotherhood bureau in Sanaa.

<LEADPARA>  I DON'T use the term addictive too often, but Rippa Baci di Dama cookies fall
into that category. The only thing that keeps you from consuming mass
quantities in record time is that these cute numbers are individually wrapped
-- for your protection, you might say.;    The cookies (the name means lady's
kisses) look like miniature hamburger buns with a thin chocolate filling.
They're not cheap, but that's probably a good thing. Prices range from 40
cents to 75 cents for individual cookies and $8 to $10 for half-pound sacks.
Get them at the Gourmet Giraffe in Los Gatos, Caffe Classico in Campbell, The
Coffee Roasting Club in Morgan Hill and Gilroy, Continental Deli in Aptos and
La Villa, Villa Lanza and Marco's, all in San Jose.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  (hbox);    The biscotti wars continue. After writing about biscotti a few
weeks ago, I've been flooded with biscotti from all over the South Bay.;
Venice Biscotti are made in Los Altos. All three varieties have what I call a
good crunch factor -- crunchy enough to hold up under dunking, but not so hard
that you feel as if you were high tackled by Ronnie Lott.;    The amaretto
contain almonds and a subtle flavor of amaretto. Chocolate has that classic
veneer of chocolate on the side. Anisette has a depth charge anise flavor that
continued to mushroom long after I finished munching. I felt as if I had
swallowed a bottle of sambuca.;    Venice Biscotti are sold nationwide and are
available locally at Draeger's in Los Altos, Whole Foods in Palo Alto and
Gene's Quito Market in Saratoga.;    Sheila Weisberg makes low- and no-fat
biscotti in her San Jose home. I liked the low-fat (no shortening but with
nuts or chocolate) better than the no-fat, which I found dry and hard. An
eight-ounce bag sells for $7, and you can mix flavors. No-fat comes in
cinnamon-spice, with and without raisins, vanilla, lemon and anisette. Low-fat
comes in chocolate-nut, orange-almond, chocolate dipped and chocolate
chocolate chip. If you live within a reasonable distance, Weisberg will
deliver. Call (408) 741-0232.;    Finally, (I hope) a Los Gatos company called
Biscotti di Nonna, not to be confused with Nonni's biscotti in San Francisco,
sent me its biscotti. The plain has a hint of anise. It's very nutty and
slightly chewy, rather than crisp and dry. The chocolate-coated (on one side)
version is crisper and slightly dry. Have this one with a cappuccino and hold
the powdered cocoa.;    The only problem is that I lost the company's business
card and there is no listing for Biscotti di Nonna in the telephone directory.
So if you're still out there, Biscotti di Nonna, let us here from you.  </TEXT>

  [Text] Informed diplomatic and political sources in Aden
are certain that Iran's vigorous pursuit of the question of the
islands and its threats against the United Arab Emirates [UAE]
come within the framework of the total coordination, alliance,
and solidarity between this state, known for its stern
fundamentalist system, and the military ruling regime in Sanaa,
which is backed by the tribal fundamentalist and extremist
Reform Party. This party is known for its close links with the
jihad movement and fundamentalist groups in the Arab states and
elsewhere in the world. These sources express the view that
constant and intense contacts are being maintained between the
governments in Iran and Sanaa within a period of less than a
week.
  In this respect the two foreign ministers have met while
officials in Sanaa, the last of whom was 'Abd-al-Wahhab
al-Anisi, the secretary general of the Reform Party, have met
the Iranian ambassador more than three times. The sources
stress that the pressure brought to bear on the UAE is an
attempt to shift it away from the clear stances it has adopted
towards the destructive war launched by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih
against the people in the south of Yemen. The sources are
surprised by this alliance now formed between Iran and Sanaa,
recalling that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih stood strongly on the side
of Iraq during its war with Iran and sent to Iraq over 10
brigades to fight on Iraq's side against Iran.

<DESCRIPT>  FOOD; RECIPE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  ITALIAN biscotti have become a favorite beverage accompaniment, no matter what
our ethnic origin. Nancy Steele of San Jose wants to make them and now she
can, thanks to the following recipe from Betty Shamus, also of San Jose.;
Shamus said, "My Italian Aunt Mary from New England gave me this recipe that
she used for years. I, too, am Italian and these taste like the real biscotti
I remember as a child growing up in Philadelphia."  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Food  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  BISCOTTI FROM A PHILADELPHIA CHILDHOOD  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Readers' Exchange  </MEMO>
<TEXT>      ITALIAN BISCOTTI;  1 pound margarine (4 sticks);  2 cups sugar;  5 eggs;
1 cup milk;  1 to 2 teaspoons anise extract (or vanilla);  6 cups unbleached
white flour;  6 teaspoons baking powder;  1/2 teaspoon baking soda;   In a
large bowl, cream margarine and sugar together. Add eggs; mix well. Add milk
and anise flavoring; mix well. Sift together flour, baking powder and baking
soda then add to creamy mixture, mixing with wooden spoon until blended.;
Put enough dough on a very lightly floured board to roll gently into a log,
approximately 1-foot long by 2-inches wide. The recipe should make about 7 or
8 of these logs. Place on ungreased cookie sheet (she uses Teflon-coated pans)
and flatten with palm of hand. Place two logs on a cookie sheet.;    Bake in
350 oven till light brown, approximately 10 minutes. Remove from oven and
gently cut into 1-inch slices on a diagonal. Put slices on their sides on
cookie sheets and return to 350 oven to toast until golden brown. Turn each
biscotti over and brown evenly on both sides. Makes at least 5 to 6 dozen
biscotti. Cool thoroughly before storing in tin cans. Stays fresh for 3 to 4
months in tins.;  Vegetarian lasagna;  Anne Randazzo, Santa Cruz, requested a
recipe for vegetable lasagna and we received several responses. The following
recipe was sent by Dolores Gruno. She said she would never have taken the time
to write out this lengthy recipe "if it wasn't exceptional.";    VEGETARIAN
LASAGNA;  1 large onion, chopped;  2 cloves garlic, minced;  1 medium green
pepper, chopped;  4 medium zucchini, coarsely chopped;  1/2 cup celery,
chopped;  5 tablespoons oil;  2 1-pound cans tomatoes;  1 8-ounce can tomato
sauce;  1 6-ounce can tomato paste;  1/2 cup dry vermouth;  1 medium carrot,
chopped;  1/4 cup parsley, chopped;  2 teaspoons oregano;  1 teaspoon basil;
1 teaspoon salt;  1/2 teaspoon thyme;  1/4 teaspoon pepper;  9 wide, curly
lasagna noodles (cooked);  2 cups (1 pound) ricotta cheese;  12 ounces
mozzarella cheese, cut in thin slices;  1 1/2 cups grated Parmesan cheese;
In large frying pan, cook onion, garlic, green pepper, zucchini and celery in
oil over medium heat for 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in tomatoes,
sauce, tomato paste, vermouth, carrot, parsley and seasonings. Bring to boil,
stirring to break up tomatoes. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 30
minutes. Remove cover and boil to reduce sauce to measure 5 cups. Spread about
1/4 sauce over bottom of 13- by 9-inch roasting pan. Arrange 3 noodles on top;
dot with 1/3 ricotta; arrange 1/4 mozzarella cheese on top and sprinkle with
1/4 of the Parmesan cheese. Repeat procedure twice. Spread remaining
mozzarella cheese and sprinkle with remaining Parmesan. Bake in a 350 oven 30
to 45 minutes or until bubbly. Let stand 5 minutes before cutting into
squares. Makes 9 servings.;  Calls for help;  Ben Cirelli, San Jose, would
like a recipe for Italian rum cake. He's looking for an old-fashioned variety
that he remembers enjoying in Philadelphia.;    Bill Gravett, San Jose, would
like recipes for scalloped potatoes and crab salad molds.;    Fran Frank, Los
Gatos, is looking for a poppy seed cake recipe.;    Carol Koyama, San Jose,
would like a recipe for "Consumer Report's frozen chicken pot pie recipe,
which was in the magazine at least 15 years ago." She'd also like a similar
one for making small chicken pies that can go from the freezer to the oven or
microwave.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  IF YOU'VE blown your financial budget over the holidays, no doubt you blew
your calorie budget as well, eating rich food and holiday treats like butter
cookies and Christmas fudge.;    And like most of us, you're feeling lethargic
and guilt-ridden, having spent New Year's Day in front of the tube watching
parades and ball games and munching on some fatty rich snacks and drinking
beer and soda.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     So maybe you're thinking it might be time to cut calories and trim some of
the unwanted side effects that have accumulated around the middle from
Christmas over-indulgence.;    Those of you who read my column regularly might
be saying, "Has he gone bonkers?" Although cost has been a prime objective in
the recipes I give you, we've never discussed calories. But, as they say,
there comes a time . . .;    Just because we're cutting calories doesn't mean
we plan to desert some of our primary directives -- low cost and lots of
flavor.;    To me, diet food does not mean cottage cheese and rice crackers
for dinner, but instead, substantial food with good flavor. When you leave the
table, you should feel satisfied and guilt free, otherwise you might be
sneaking downstairs for that late-night snack of ice cream and cookies.;
And, cutting calories does not mean eliminating meat. Instead, meat should be
used sparingly, taking advantage of its full taste to flavor the other
elements of the dish. There should be lots of vegetables and plenty of
seasonings as well.;    Ingredients such as garlic, onions, leeks and
mushrooms add flavor. Ideal examples of this type of eating are Chinese
stir-fry and Italian pasta dishes.;    The dish I have chosen is pork braised
with Napa cabbage. It's an example of Chinese slow cooking where lots of
flavor is infused into the vegetables. In a Chinese restaurant, this dish
would be cooked and served in a clay braising pot.;    Besides Napa cabbage,
other greens would be equally good in this dish. In fact, any leafy vegetable
is delicious when cooked this way. Try bitter mustard greens or turnip greens,
or milder flavored bok choy, savoy or white cabbage. Serve the dish with
steamed rice.;     PORK BRAISED WITH NAPA CABBAGE;  1 pound pork loin chops,
all fat and bone removed, cut into 1-inch dice;   Salt and pepper to taste;  1
teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder;  2 teaspoons peanut oil;  2 cups thinly
sliced onions;  2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger;  1 teaspoon minced garlic;  1
1/2 pounds Napa cabbage, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch slices;  1/2 cup Chinese
rice wine or medium dry sherry;  1 cup rich chicken stock;  1 cup sliced green
onions or scallions;  2 cups coarsely chopped fresh cilantro;  2 whole star
anise;   Season the meat generously with salt, pepper and the five-spice
powder. Brown the meat in the peanut oil in a heavy frying pan or Dutch oven
for 5 minutes, turning frequently. Remove the meat and add the onions, ginger
and garlic. Cook for 10 minutes over medium heat until they are soft. Add the
cabbage and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring to coat with the pan juices. Add
the wine, chicken stock, 1/4 cup of the green onions, 1 cup of the cilantro
and the star anise. Return the meat to the pan, lower heat to a simmer and
cook for 30 minutes.;    Using a slotted spoon, remove the meat and vegetables
to a serving platter, and keep warm. Turn the heat to high and reduce the
liquid remaining in the skillet until it just begins to turn syrupy. Taste for
salt and pepper, degrease and pour over the meat and cabbage. Garnish with the
remaining green onions and cilantro. Serve with steamed rice. Makes 6
servings. Cost: $.75-$1 per serving.  </TEXT>

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anisi
yesterday received an Arab League delegation led by Major
General Muhammad Sa'id Bayraqdar, assistant secretary general
for military affairs. The Arab League delegation is currently on
a visit to our country.
  The two sides reviewed the developments in our country in
light of the war ignited in the homeland by the gang of apostasy
and secession in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leadership.
  The deputy prime minister explained the developments in the
Yemeni arena, holding the secessionist rebellious leadership of
the YSP responsible for igniting the military situation in the
country. He noted that this took place in accordance with a
premeditated scheme and began with the actions of this gang,
which is rebelling against political legitimacy by violating the
framework of the government coalition, paralyzing the legitimate
institutions, casting doubts about them, and obstructing their
role.
  The deputy prime minister expressed his appreciation for the
Arab League's role in shouldering its pan-Arab responsibility to
protect Yemeni unity, which is considered a pan-Arab achievement
that concerns all the sons of the Arab nation, and to support
justice and constitutional legitimacy.

Nothing warms a wintry day faster than a peppery stew from South of the Border.
And nothing accommodates the hurried cook better than almost effortless main
dishes, especially if they can be microwaved a day or two ahead of time then
reheated just before serving.
</P>
<P>
Our Picadillo and Chicken Mole, rich with the flavors of Old Mexico, fill the
bill on both counts. Best of all, they need only a crisp green salad and a
fresh fruit dessert to round out the meal.
</P>
<P>
Like stews made the old-fashioned way, you'll find that both of these Mexican
classics profit from a stay in the fridge because their exotic flavors have a
chance to mellow and marry.
</P>
<P>

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister brother 'Abd-al-Wahhab
al-Anisi has reaffirmed that the war, which was triggered by the
gang of apostasy and secession in the Yemeni Socialist Party
leadership, is between the Yemeni people and a mutinous group
violating the constitutional legitimacy.
  Referring to the concern of the brothers and friends, as
well
as their calls for halting the fighting, he wondered: On what
basis do they call for a cease-fire, and what are the guarantees
that the rebels would resort to the constitutional legitimacy
and its institutions, which were established as a result of the
general elections that were held on 27 April 1993 and that were
(?defined) by everybody.
  The deputy prime minister reiterated our country's rejection
of any interference in its domestic affairs by the Security
Council or any other side, stressing that what is taking place
in the Republic of Yemen is an internal affair. He also voiced
his surprise at some brothers' insistence on the need for the
Security Council to issue a resolution on a cease-fire, although
they know that the issue belongs to the Yemeni people alone.
Such a resolution, he added, will lead to more fighting, which
is sought by those who want such a resolution.
  This came during a news conference he gave at the Prime
Ministry today. Several representatives of local, Arab, and
international television networks, radio stations, and press in
Sanaa attended. It was also attended by 'Abd-al-Rahman Zaydan,
director of the prime minister's office, and [name indistinct],
under secretary of the Ministry of Information.

THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO STUFF A TURKEY
</P>

Next Thursday, eight out of 10 Americans will sit down to a turkey dinner. To
supply the demand, 45 million birds will meet their maker in the weeks leading
up to Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
Our national bird might well have been the turkey. Benjamin Franklin thought it
"a much more respectable bird, and withall a true original native of America."
The bird was already domesticated when the Spanish reached Mexico in 1518. The
Aztecs ate it with a sauce made from chiles and unsweetened chocolate. (The
preparation survives in the Mexican dish mole poblano.) Europeans, usually
finicky about New World foods, adopted the bird with gusto: A 16th-Century
German cookbook listed 20 turkey recipes.
</P>
<P>
One of the problems with turkey is that it's a party animal. You need at least
10 people to eat a small one. If you have a smaller group, you might want to
serve a game bird, such as partridge, pheasant and quail. They are loaded with
flavor and perfect for celebrating Thanksgiving when you have only four to six
guests.
</P>
<P>
Game birds include, in descending order of size, wild turkey, goose, duck,
pheasant, partridge, grouse, squab, dove, thrush (the alouette of the French
children's song) and, the most delicious of them all, woodcock. Game is leaner
than chicken or duck, which makes it a boon with dieters. Prone to drying out,
it does best with a moist cooking method, like stewing or braising. Another way
to keep game birds moist is by wrapping them in bacon or other fat.
</P>
<P>
Game used to be available only to hunters, but more and more of it can be found
at specialty markets and butcher shops. True wild game has the richer (and in
many cases, muskier) game flavor. The pen-raised birds, on the other hand, are
free of such inconveniences as feathers and wayward buckshot. Game farms have
proliferated around the United States; many sell their wares by mail order.
</P>
<P>
Looking for something different for this Thanksgiving? Here are some offbeat
ways to prepare turkey and some game bird recipes for serving small crowds.
</P>
<P>
 In pre-Columbian times, chocolate was consumed as a spice, not a sweet. Its
bitterness goes well with the pungency of chiles. This recipe comes from "The
Complete Book of Mexican Cookery" by Elizabeth Lambert Ortiz (Bantam Books:
1968).
</P>
<P>
MOLE POBLANO (Turkey With Chile-Chocolate Sauce)
</P>
<P>
1 (8-pound) whole turkey
</P>
<P>
Salt
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup oil or lard
</P>
<P>
6 ancho chiles
</P>
<P>
4 pasilla chiles
</P>
<P>
4 mulato chiles
</P>
<P>
2 onions, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
4 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
3 sprigs fresh cilantro
</P>
<P>
1 tortilla or toast slice, diced
</P>
<P>
1 pound (3 medium) tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped
</P>
<P>
1 cup blanched almonds, lightly toasted
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup raisins
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon anise seeds
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander seeds
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup sesame seeds, lightly toasted
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
Cut turkey into individual serving pieces and place in pan along with salted
water to cover. Simmer 1 hour and drain, reserving 2 cups turkey stock. Blot
turkey pieces dry.
</P>
<P>
Heat oil in large skillet. Brown turkey pieces, batch at time, on all sides.
Transfer turkey to platter and reserve fat.
</P>
<P>
Wash chiles. Tear in halves and remove stems, veins and seeds. Soak chiles in
cold water to cover 1 hour and drain. Place chiles, onions, garlic, cilantro,
tortilla, tomatoes, almonds, raisins, anise seeds, cloves, cinnamom, coriander
seeds, black pepper and 2 tablespoons sesame seeds in blender and puree to
smooth paste.
</P>
<P>
Heat reserved fat in turkey pan. Add pureed chile mixture and cook over medium
heat 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and stir in reserved turkey
broth and chocolate. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Gently simmer 10
minutes. Sauce should be very thick.
</P>
<P>
Return turkey to sauce and cook over low heat 30 minutes, stirring
occasionally. Correct seasoning. Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons sesame seeds
over mole poblano and serve at once. Makes 8 to 10 servings.
</P>
<P>
 Partridge is the game bird for people who like dark meat. This recipe comes
from the Hermitage Inn in Wilmington, Vt.
</P>
<P>
ROAST PARTRIDGE WITH DIJON MUSTARD SAUCE
</P>
<P>
1 partridge, cut in half
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons butter, melted
</P>
<P>
Salt
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
1 shallot, minced
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup whipping cream
</P>

</P>
<P>
2 strips crisply cooked bacon, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
Brush partridge with 2 tablespoons melted butter and season to taste with salt
and pepper. Roast bird, skin side up, in oiled pan at 500 degrees 10 to 12
minutes, or until cooked to taste.
</P>
<P>
Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in heavy saucepan. Add shallot and sauce
over medium heat until tender but not brown. Add white wine and boil until
reduced by half. Add whipping cream and cook until reduced by half. Stir in
Dijon mustard, bacon and parsley. Correct seasoning to taste. Pour sauce over
partridge and serve at once. Makes 2 servings.
</P>
<P>
 "When I devised this stuffing, I thought of all the things a quail would eat
in the fall, or at least the things I wished it would eat," says Greg Parks,
chef of the Four Columns Inn in Newfane, Vt.
</P>
<P>
ROAST QUAIL WITH WILD RICE STUFFING
</P>
<P>
8 quail, preferably fresh
</P>
<P>
1 lemon
</P>
<P>
Salt
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
Stuffing
</P>
<P>
Wash quail inside and out and dry with paper towels. Sprinkle few drops lemon
juice, salt and pepper into cavity of each bird. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
Fill each quail with Stuffing. Season birds with salt and pepper. Arrange quail
in lightly oiled roasting pan, breast side up. Tie drumsticks of each bird
together and baste skin with olive oil. Roast at 450 degrees about 20 minutes,
or until cooked to taste. To test for doneness, insert slender skewer into
cavity of bird -- it should feel very hot to the touch. (Parks likes to serve
quail slightly pink.) Untie legs and serve quail at once. Makes 8 appetizer
servings or 4 entree servings.
</P>
<P>
Note: This stuffing would also be good in Cornish game hens or guinea fowl.
</P>
<P>
Stuffing
</P>
<P>
1 cup wild rice
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup butter
</P>
<P>

6 shallots, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
1 sweet red pepper, finely diced

1 large apple, peeled, cored and chopped
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage or 1 teaspoon dried
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper
</P>
<P>
Rinse wild rice in strainer with cold water and drain. Place rice in large
saucepan with 8 cups water. Bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer 40 to 50
minutes, or until grains are just tender. Drain rice.
</P>
<P>
Melt butter in skillet over medium high heat. Add and saute onion, shallots,
garlic, red and green peppers and celery over medium heat 6 to 8 minutes, or
until tender.
</P>
<P>
Toast pine nuts at 350 degrees 5 minutes, or until lightly browned. Mix
together wild rice, onion mixture, pine nuts, apple, sage and Parmesan cheese.
Season to taste with salt and pepper.

  [Text] The higher committee charged with preparing for the
festivals marking the fourth anniversary of the Yemeni Republic
met this morning under brother Deputy Prime Minister
'Abd-al-Wahhab al- Anisi. During this meeting, the conferees
discussed the timetable for the celebrations of the Republic's
national day, the fourth anniversary of unity and the
establishment of the Yemen Republic.
  Despite the difficult circumstances brought about by the
gang
of apostasy and secession in the Socialist Party, the committee
decided to hold festivals to mark this dear anniversary in all
governorates in the country; the anniversary of the day on which
our people's dream and great goal -- the restoration of unity
and the establishment of the Yemeni Republic -- was achieved on
22 May 1990.

  [Text] Lieutenant General brother 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,
chairman of the Presidential Council, yesterday evening received
brother Dr. Khalid al-Karaki, His Majesty King Husayn's adviser.
  Al-Karaki arrived in Sanaa with a Jordanian military team,
led by Major Gen. 'Id Kamil, assistant to the Jordanian Army
chief of staff. The Jordanian team will be partly responsible
for carrying out the military aspect of the accord document
signed in the Jordanian capital. It will also handle part of
the the work of the military committee.
  Dr. al-Karaki conveyed a message from King Husayn to his
brother the chairman of the Presidential Council spelling out
his majesty's efforts to bridge viewpoints and implement the
accord document. The message reiterated Jordan's keenness to
see the accord document translated on the ground as an
achievement that concerns the Arab nation as well as the Yemeni
people. It indicated that it is the duty of all Arabs to rally
to Yemen's unity as a pan-Arab project embodying the aspirations
of Arab unionists and holding out the hope that the dawn of Arab
unity has arrived.
  President Salih and Dr. al-Karaki reviewed Yemeni
developments against the backdrop of the accord document. The
president told him he and the Yemeni people were appreciative of
His Majesty King Husayn's and the Jordanian people's pan-Arab
attitude and genuine concern for unity and democracy in our
country. The president said he appreciated that Jordan was
doing all it could to help Yemen ride out the tough challenges
left by the political crisis. President Salih noted that these
efforts were crowned by Amman hosting the gathering of Yemeni
political and social figures to witness the ceremonies for
signing the accord document. Our people, the president told Dr.
al-Karaki, will always recognize Jordan's brotherly stands that
dramatize the profundity of ties between the two brother peoples.
  The president asked him to convey his greetings to his
brother His Majesty King Husayn and best wishes for the
brotherly Jordanian people. The meeting was attended by brother
'Ali Muhammad al-Anisi, the head of the Presidential Office;
Maj. Gen. 'Id Kamil, assistant to the Jordanian Army chief of
staff; and Fayiz al-Rubayyi', the Jordanian ambassador to our
country.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anisi this
morning received (Chan Chichan), the charge d'affaires at the
embassy of the People's Republic of China in our country.
  They discussed developments in the Yemeni arena and ties
between the two friendly countries.
  During the meeting, the Chinese charge d'affaires underlined
his country's concern for Yemeni unity since it is a factor of
stability in the region.
  For his part, the brother deputy prime minister voiced
appreciation for China's position on the events and developments
in our region. He also expressed the hope that the ties of
cooperation between the two countries will improve for the
benefit of the two friendly peoples' mutual interests.
  The meeting also touched on the discussions that will be
held
at the UN Security Council and our country's position, since
these discussions run counter to the UN charter and constitute a
precedent that will affect not only Yemen, but also other
countries with worse internal situations than those in Yemen.

<F P=106> [By Salah al-Qallab from Aden] </F>
  [Excerpts] It has become almost certain that the
anticipated meeting between Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah
Salih and Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid will be held
in Amman.
  A source at the Follow-Up Committee, which is making
arrangements for this meeting, and which comprises several
leading national and partisan figures, has informed AL-DUSTUR
that the committee's preference is to see the ceremony for
signing the document of understanding take place in the
Jordanian capital under the auspices of His Majesty King Husayn
and the Jordanian people.
  The source added that since the security situation precludes
the holding of such a meeting in Yemen, all parties prefer to
see the reconciliation meeting between the Yemeni president and
his deputy take place in Amman, given the role His Majesty King
Husayn has played to achieve reconciliation, and also due to the
balanced Jordanian position toward the Yemeni crisis from the
outset.
  The source indicated that invitations for this ceremony will
be extended to some Arab leaders, foremost among which will be
Omani Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id, Palestinian President Yasir
'Arafat, representatives of several foreign countries, and Arab
League representatives after coordination is effected between
the Yemeni Government and the Jordanian Government.
  It is clear that the Follow-Up Committee charged with making
arrangements for this meeting, which comprises Shaykh Sinan
Abu-Luhum, Brigadier General Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, 'Abdallah
al-Anisi, Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Culture Minister Jarallah
'Umar, and Ahmad Jabir 'Afif, has agreed to hold the
reconciliation meeting in Jordan in light of the contacts held
within the past four days.
  Given the current security situation, heightened tension,
and
several complicated circumstances, it has become very clear that
it is impossible to hold the reconciliation meeting anywhere in
Yemen. In this regard, several senior Yemeni officials said that
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih refuses to see the meeting take
place in Hadramawt. Similarly, Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim

situation under control, and which might consequently cause a
security disaster. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Salah al-Qallab from Aden] </F>
  [Excerpts] It has become almost certain that the
anticipated meeting between Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah
Salih and Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid will be held
in Amman.
  A source at the Follow-Up Committee, which is making
arrangements for this meeting, and which comprises several
leading national and partisan figures, has informed AL-DUSTUR
that the committee's preference is to see the ceremony for
signing the document of understanding take place in the
Jordanian capital under the auspices of His Majesty King Husayn
and the Jordanian people.
  The source added that since the security situation precludes
the holding of such a meeting in Yemen, all parties prefer to
see the reconciliation meeting between the Yemeni president and
his deputy take place in Amman, given the role His Majesty King
Husayn has played to achieve reconciliation, and also due to the
balanced Jordanian position toward the Yemeni crisis from the
outset.
  The source indicated that invitations for this ceremony will
be extended to some Arab leaders, foremost among which will be
Omani Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id, Palestinian President Yasir
'Arafat, representatives of several foreign countries, and Arab
League representatives after coordination is effected between
the Yemeni Government and the Jordanian Government.
  It is clear that the Follow-Up Committee charged with making
arrangements for this meeting, which comprises Shaykh Sinan
Abu-Luhum, Brigadier General Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, 'Abdallah
al-Anisi, Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Culture Minister Jarallah
'Umar, and Ahmad Jabir 'Afif, has agreed to hold the
reconciliation meeting in Jordan in light of the contacts held
within the past four days.
  Given the current security situation, heightened tension,
and
several complicated circumstances, it has become very clear that
it is impossible to hold the reconciliation meeting anywhere in
Yemen. In this regard, several senior Yemeni officials said that
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih refuses to see the meeting take
place in Hadramawt. Similarly, Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim
al-Bid is opposed to signing the reconciliation document in
Sanaa.
  Several Yemeni officials said that the security situation
and
mutual mistrust will prompt any official who will have to attend
this meeting to bring with him a large number of guards and
escorts to protect him, a number that could exceed
5,000--something which would make it impossible to get the
situation under control, and which might consequently cause a
security disaster. [passage omitted]

CULINARY SOS: A NON-DAIRY MUFFIN LOW ON CHOLESTEROL
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ROSE DOSTI, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR SOS: While vacationing in Flagstaff, Ariz., we had breakfast at Macy's
European Coffee House and Bakery. They had non-dairy peach muffins that were
out of this world. Please see if you can get the recipe for this wonderful
low-cholesterol treat.
</P>
<P>
 -- DEBBIE
</P>
<P>
DEAR DEBBIE: We thought the peach muffins made without dairy products were
quite good. Using oil instead of butter makes the muffins cholesterol-free. The
wheat bran and flour plus oats give the muffins a nutritional boost too.
</P>
<P>
MACY'S NON-DAIRY PEACH MUFFINS
</P>
<P>
1 cup whole wheat flour
</P>
<P>
1 cup toasted wheat bran
</P>
<P>
1 cup oats
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon ground ginger
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
</P>
<P>
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup chopped nuts or seeds (walnuts, pecans, sunflower seeds)
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoon safflower oil
</P>
<P>
2/3 cup honey
</P>
<P>
1 egg
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups diced peaches (fresh, frozen or canned, drained)
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup apple juice
</P>
<P>
Combine flour, bran, oats, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, baking powder and nuts in
mixing bowl. Combine oil, honey, egg, peaches and apple juice in another bowl.
Using rubber spatula or wooden spoon, fold egg mixture into dry ingredients. Do
not overmix. Batter should be wet and sticky, but should hold its form when
mounded in muffin tin.
</P>
<P>
Spoon into muffin cups, using ice cream scoop as measure, so batter is mounded
to about 1/2-inch above top of muffin tin. Bake at 325 degrees 25 to 30 minutes
or until golden brown. Cool slightly before serving. Makes about 14 muffins.
</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: I would love a recipe for albondigas soup for a chilly day.

DEAR SOS: Can you come up with a recipe for Italian biscotti? It's a not very
sweet cookie covered with sesame seeds like the ones I had in Rome.
</P>
<P>
 -- BERNARD
</P>
<P>
Dear Bernard: The biscotti we know are studded with slivered almonds and
toasted. Still interested?

</P>
<P>
Remove from oven and immediately cut each loaf into 24 diagonal slices. Place
slices cut side up on baking sheets. Toast under broiler to brown each side
slightly. Makes 8 dozen.
</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: I think you gave Shirley the wrong recipe for the tuna casserole that
is also our family's favorite. We prefer it made with cream of celery soup
instead of mushroom.
</P>
<P>

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister brother 'Abd-al-Wahhab
al-Anisi returned to Sanaa from Doha this evening at the end of
a visit that lasted several days during which he held talks with
officials in the sisterly State of Qatar dealing with bilateral
relations and developments in the Yemeni arena.
  In a statement to the Yemeni News Agency, SABA', the brother
deputy prime minister said his visit to Doha came within the
framework of continuous contacts and coordination between the
Republic of Yemen and the State of Qatar in the interest of the
fraternal state and the Arab and Islamic nations.
  He added that he conveyed the greetings and appreciation of
the political leadership and the Yemeni people to the leadership
of the State of Qatar and its fraternal people. He hailed the
principled and firm Qatari support for unity and legitimacy, and
hoped that Qatar will be an example for other Gulf Cooperation
Council states in particular, and Arab and world countries in
general in its support for right and the Yemeni people's will.
  Concluding his statement, the brother deputy prime minister
stressed that the Yemeni people will not forget the principled
support for it during the current critical circumstances.

from inside vanilla bean to milk. Add dry ingredients to butter-sugar mixture
in three parts, alternating with milk. Pour into buttered and floured bundt
pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 40 minutes, or until toothpick inserted into cake
comes out clean. Cool, turn out of pan.;    Whisk together glaze ingredients
and pour or brush over cake.;     CAPPUCCINO BRULEE; La Folie;  For brulee

sugar with the water in a small copper pan and bring to a boil. As the sugar
cooks, beat the whites until stiff. Check the sugar. When it reaches 248
degrees or the hard-ball stage, it is ready to use (if you don't have a candy
thermometer, let a drop of sugar fall from a spoon into a glass of cold water;
the sugar should form a ball and hold its shape on the bottom of the glass).
With the mixer on medium speed, pour the boiling sugar into the egg whites,
being careful not to let it fall on the edge of the bowl or on the beaters,
add salt. Beat until cool. Transfer the meringue into a pastry bag and pipe a

<DESCRIPT>  WINE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  THE cognac industry is very interesting. Like the automobile industry, it is
dominated by a few big companies. Hennessy, Courvoisier, Martell and Remy
Martin produce millions of cases every year of cognac that ranges in quality
from good to superb. Most of the production of these industry giants is in the
cheaper V.S. and V.S.O.P. grades, brandies that have only been aged for four
to six years.;    Delamain is different. This small house, located in Jarnac,
France, a few miles from the city of Cognac, specializes in brandies that are
at least 25 years old, all of which come from Grande Champagne, the most
prestigious "cru" or sub-region of Cognac.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Wine
San Francisco-based Anthony Dias Blue is author of "American Wine" and a

<TEXT>     Long history;  The firm is no newcomer to the production of cognac. The
house was established in the mid-18th century by James Delamain, scion of a
Huguenot family. After years in England, Delamain returned to France in 1759
at the age of 21. He immediately became a cognac shipper, using his family
connections to build a healthy export business in the British Isles.;
Although his company was dissolved in 1817, a new entity, Roullet &amp; Delamain,
was established in 1824, marking the formal founding of what is now Delamain &amp;
Co.;    Today Delamain is run by Alain Braastad-Delamain and Christian
Braastad., former managing director of Courvoisier. Braastad-Delamain is the
10th generation of his family to manage Delamain.;    Delamain produces four
different cognacs: Pale &amp; Dry, Vesper, Tres Venerable and Reserve de la
Famille.;    Pale &amp; Dry Tres Belle Grande Champagne ($50) represents 80
percent of Delamain's production. It is blended from cognacs that average 25
years of age. This brandy is pale gold in color and is made in a delicate,
elegant style. There are lovely flavors of vanilla and oak on the palate. The
mouthfeel is soft with some charming touches of smoke, tea and spice on the
finish. (91);    Serene sips;  Vesper ($90) averages 35 years of age. The
brandy is named after the sixth canonical hour when the evening service or
Vespers are celebrated. The idea is to reflect the "serene, ethereal quality"
of the cognac. It is darker in color and more complex than Pale &amp; Dry. It is
vinous and woody with dense, spicy flavors and a silky texture. (93);    Tres
Venerable ($160) averages 45 to 50 years of age. It is darker still and shows
amazing complexity. On the palate there are hints of anise, honey, dried
apricots, toast and smoke. The flavors are long and lingering. (96);
Reserve de la Famille ($350) is an extremely rare, single-cask cognac
distilled by one grower in the Grande Champagne village of St. Preuil. The
brandy has been 55 years in cask. It is the epitome of the mystique and
essence of cognac. It is spicy and complex with elements of toast, vanilla,
smoke, earth and anise. The flavors are long and intense with great depth and
finesse. (98);    The cognacs of Delamain are not easy to find -- the company
makes only 50,000 cases each year -- but they are worth the extra effort that
searching them out may require. If cognac is the king of brandies, Delamain is
the king of cognacs.  </TEXT>

  [Text] In a pre-departure statement in Sanaa today, UN
envoy Lakhdar Brahimi expressed disappointment at the collapse
of yesterday's cease-fire agreement. He stressed that the
conflict can be solved through dialogue between the concerned
parties, but such a dialogue is still not possible as the south
wants a complete halt to battles and full northern commitment to
a cease-fire before anything else. As for the conditions of the
north, here is 'Abd-al-Salam al-'Ansi, chairman of the General
Committee of the General People's Congress, which is led by
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, speaking to our correspondent
Ahmad Birru in Sanaa.
  [Begin al-Anisi recording] To agree to dialogue, the
following conditions should be met:
  1. The Socialist Party should issue a decision abrogating
the secession decision.
  2. It should clearly and frankly announce its acceptance
of the results of the parliamentary elections held on 27 April
[1993].
  3. It should announce its commitment to the
constitutional legitimacy and to dealing with the institutions
accordingly.
  4. The dialogue should take place in Sanaa.
  5. The dialogue should not last more than five days.
  6. The 16 Socialist Party members subpoenaed by the
public prosecutor should not take part in the dialogue. [end
recording]

Article Type:CSO

  [Text] Sanaa--Some of the principal political powers in
Yemen are in the midst of a fierce and foreboding debate
concerning the significance of the awakening of the Bakil tribe
and the extent of the connection of this rising to any of the
governing political parties. The United Bakil Council concluded
the business of its first general conference, which was held in
the region of the Anisi tribes, the day before yesterday, amidst
opposition to it and its rejection by some of the political and
tribal symbols of Anisi, and especially those belonging to the
Popular General People's Congress, the leader of which is the
Yemeni president 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih.
  While these same mentioned that the conference was plagued
with failure because of their refusal to receive it in their
regions, Shaykh Muhammad 'Ali Abu Luhum confirmed in a telephone
call to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the conference was crowned by
success and was attended by about 40,000 people from among the
men of the Bakil tribes and various governorates.
  He confirmed the error of those who portrayed the Bakil
conference as putting forth a call for disunion, when it is
exactly the opposite. Likewise, he rejects any process of
political or partisan polarization.
  He referred to the decisions and recommendations that the
conference issued at the end of its business and which the
closing statement contained. They concentrated on the handling
of the internal issues of the Bakil tribes first, and on the
presentation of a group of special and general issues in various
spheres, the most important of which is working to display the
civilized side of the Bakil tribes, the effective participation
in building the Yemeni state, the preservation of unity and
democracy, the accomplishments of the revolution, the doing away
with any differences in the Bakil framework, and the striving to
end all differences between it and the other tribes.
  The Bakil conference confirmed its devotion to unity and
democracy as an irrevocable choice, and the working towards
sovereignty of the law and the system. It demanded the "sound
rebuilding of the security organizations nationally, and the
reformation of the armed forces so that they protect the country
and its sovereignty and are not a heavy weight on the nation or
a protector or friend of the people in power or in the parties."
  The Bakil tribes demanded to be made a participant, through
their United Council, in any arrangements relating to
state-building issues. [They also demanded] the acceptance of
the Bakil Council's opinion, the necessity of giving the Bakil
people and all the ordinary people an equal opportunity in
public service, including the armed forces and security forces,
without reservation, in the same manner as others from among the
tribes, and the taking of an interest in the rights of all the
families of the martyrs.
  Likewise, the Bakil Council demanded the necessity of
completing the centralization and the granting of full powers to
the people of the governorates and districts, which enables them
to serve their regions according to the system of local
governing. [They also demanded] the rebuilding of the state
organizations, and for the end of the double standard, and
giving the qualified individuals and cadres the positions that
they deserve. They demanded the hastening of the end of the
present crisis, which is on the verge of threatening the unity
of the country, and the necessity of requiring all the political
powers, and especially those within the framework of the
governing coalition, to refrain from all the practices that tend
to cause disunion inside society.
  The statement also demanded that all the parties refrain
from
political provocation that leads to breach of security and
violation of the national constants and hinders the movement of
life. Regarding the army and security, it demanded purging both
of them of the elements whose failure has been proved and which
had a role in frustrating the responsibilities of this
institution, and then replacing them with new elements that are
capable of undertaking their role free and clear of
subordination to people or parties or to the influential people
in power.
  It demanded working to withdraw the armed forces from inside
the cities, doing away with the subordination of the armed
forces to the sections of power, and opening the door of service
to all ordinary people. Likewise, it demanded the changing of
the heads of the armed forces in the various military units who
belong to any one of the sections of power, or those who belong
to one region, and taking another look at the appointment of
these leaders, on the condition that the retirement law be
applied, and the process of blind conscription be stopped.
  In the economic sphere, the statement pointed to the need to
require the government to maintain public funds and to paralyze
the hands tinkering with them, to observe the activity of the
revenue-related institutions and the central bank, to not
monopolize the public funds in the hands of an individual or
party who uses them to buy protections and party and political
loyalties, and [the need] to prevent the administering of the
public funds for anything except what is in agreement with the
regulations and laws, in the framework of what the public budget
of the state establishes.
  It demanded the hastening of putting plans and reform and
growth programs into place, the limiting of luxury government
spending, the checking of the process of issuing money, the
abolishing of what is called invisible clauses and the
application of the principle of financial protection, and the
putting into operation of the principle of "Where did you get
this?"
  Likewise, it demanded the limitation of the number of
workers
in the state institutions, including the army and the security
forces, the opening of the door of compulsory retirement for the
people in high positions of responsibility, the hastening to
finish the establishment of the free economic and trade zone in
the capital, Aden, and the directing of oil revenues towards
what produces a push to the production process and the building
of an agricultural renaissance. The statement touched on the
demand for various services and the treatment of problems of
revenge, and the new manifestations of crime and drugs and the
like.
  The statement concluded with the Bakil Council's assurance
that these demands express the concerns and aspirations of all
the ordinary people, and not just the Bakil people. However, the
Council takes the presentation of these demands upon itself
within the scope of its comprehensive national directives.

<LEADPARA>  Fennel (also called finocchio or anise) gives an exotic flavor to meals. Never
tasted fennel? If you like licorice, you'll probably like it -- once you get
over being surprised that a vegetable can taste like candy. Never seen fennel?
Look along the produce counter for a head of celery that grew lacy,
carrot-like leaves at the top and bulged out squat and round at the bottom. If
it smells of licorice or anise candy, it's fennel.;    Fennel is high in
vitamin A and furnishes calcium, phosphorus and potassium. It's low in
calories. Fennel is available from late summer through early spring. Most
recipes call for trimming the tops, which are reportedly an appetite
suppressant.  </LEADPARA>

<LEADPARA>  THE fermented black beans have been sitting in the door of my refrigerator
since Reagan's first term. They're positioned just above the sweet chili sauce
I bought at a Thai market that has long since gone out of business. And the
tahini just below that? Well, how much hummus can you eat?;   Sound familiar?  </LEADPARA>

BE USED TO CREATE DISHES WORTH REMEMBERING  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Story; See also related article on page 7E of this section.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Perhaps the dark recesses of your refrigerator contain the remains of a
half gallon of Kansas City barbecue sauce (too bad you're just plain barbecued
out). And what about that Vietnamese fish sauce, those funny little capers
(are they still good?) and the family-size bottle of oyster sauce your husband
bought at Price Club because it's cheaper per ounce than the smaller sizes?;
Now, every time you open the refrigerator or pantry door, a dozen half-used
jars of exotic and not so exotic ingredients stare you in the face and bleat,
"Use me! Use me!";   Don't put up with that jabber. Here's what to do with
those sauces and other condiments so they won't haunt you until the next power
failure forces you to chuck the whole lot of them.;   The first rule of using
ingredient leftovers is to take off your culinary blinders. Who says sesame
oil can be used only in Chinese dishes? The other day on KCBS radio, Narsai
David said he uses sesame oil in his bread recipes instead of vegetable oil.
He reasoned that it would give the bread a nice nutty flavor. And because
sesame oil is pungent, he uses less of it than other oils.;   Rule No. 2 is a
corollary of No. 1. Here's an example. If a vinaigrette is made up of oil and
acid (vinegar and/or lemon juice), why can't you mix sesame oil and red wine
vinegar or olive oil and rice wine vinegar?;   Rule No. 3 is to think balance.
If you're combining sharp flavors such as vinegars and spicy condiments,
mellow out the dish with a dab of cream. Or give it a fresh accent with fresh
herbs.;   Rule No. 4 is to have fun. Hey folks, this is food, not nuclear
disarmament. And if your wife says the fermented black bean vinaigrette smells
fishy, so what?;   Here are a bunch of common and not-so-common leftover
ingredients and how to use them up.;    Barbecue sauce;   If the thought of
one more thing on the grill turns you off, try that leftover barbecue sauce
with pasta. Combine a 28-ounce can of chopped tomatoes with half as much
barbecue sauce. Throw in four ounces of sliced mushrooms sauteed in butter
with some chopped onions. Add fresh chopped basil and simmer 20 minutes. Add a
cup of heavy cream and simmer 10 minutes more.;   In general, use in place of
ketchup for dishes such as meatloaf (good old meatloaf hides a lot of things),
on hot dogs, in taco fillings and in baked beans. Or try on pizzas (especially
if you have a little barbecued chicken left over to go with it).;   Fermented
black beans;   Yes, they smell like they've been taken from the compost heap,
but these salted (and partially decomposed) soy beans add a distinctive accent
to Asian and non-Asian dishes alike. Put them in a vinaigrette with olive oil,
garlic and sherry vinegar and toss with bitter greens. Use with hot pepper and
ginger in a sauce for shellfish. They go surprisingly well with tomatoes in a
sauce for pasta or clams (see recipe). Also, try with garlic in a stir-fry of
hearty greens such as kale. To modify their strong flavor somewhat, soak in
warm water for 30 minutes and drain. Or use in a marinade and discard them.;
Fish sauce;   Nuoc mam if you're Vietnamese, nam pla if you're Thai, and
stinko if you're just about anyone else. The flavor of this fish sauce isn't
as strong as the smell. Since both cultures use it in lieu of soy sauce,
substitute it in recipes that call for soy -- sauces, marinades and dressings.
Use in fish marinades with chopped shallots, sherry vinegar and nut oils such
walnut (if it's a mild fish) or sesame oil.;   Use in recipes that call for
anchovy such as tapenade (a puree of olives, garlic and anchovies). Add a
tablespoon to Caesar salad dressing (not as weird as you think; the original
Caesar had Worcestershire sauce, made with anchovies). Add to garlic, white
wine and olive oil as a quick sauce for steamed mussels. If you need a little
fish stock or clam juice but don't have either, try fish sauce, perhaps
diluted with a little water. And with hot pepper, garlic, rice vinegar, lime
or lemon juice and a little sugar, it makes a great all-purpose dip for almost
any fried food.;   Tahini;   A paste of ground sesame seeds, it's most
commonly used in hummus, the Middle Eastern bean dip. But Asian dishes often
use sesame paste, though Asian sesame paste has toasted seeds. So, try it in
cold, spicy Sichuan noodle dishes with leftover chicken. Add garlic to it and
thin with water and lemon juice for taratoor sauce, great on steamed or fried
vegetables or mixed with roasted sweet peppers. Since it has the look and
consistency of peanut butter, use it as such, spread on toast or bagels with
jam (try with Middle Eastern fig jam). Or put in a satay instead of peanut
butter.;   Sesame and other oils;   Use in combination with other oils,
notably peanut, for salad dressings. Use as a simple marinade for meats, fish
and poultry. Asian food expert Bruce Cost suggests adding a little to
scrambled eggs or mixing it with mustard for basting roast fowl. When you run
out of tahini but not chick peas, make this variation of hummus from "Good &amp;
Plenty" by Victoria Wise and Susanna Hoffman (Harper &amp; Row, $22.95): Puree 2
cups drained chick peas with three cloves garlic in a food processor. Add 1/2
cup olive oil, 1/4 cup sesame oil, 2 tablespoons lemon juice and salt to
taste. Puree.;   Use almond and walnut oils for fish and poultry marinades and
in lightly seasoned vinaigrettes for mild greens or fruit. Avocado oil can be
used in dressings (especially with tomatoes) or to give an extra punch to
guacamole.;    Oyster sauce;   Think of this as the Chinese equivalent of A-1
Sauce and use it accordingly. Terrific on grilled steak. Enliven it with some
hot chilies, soy and sesame oil, if you like. A few dashes accent stir-fried
broccoli or greens such as collards. Or try this dip from "The Encyclopedia of
Asian Food and Cooking" by Jacki Passmore (Hearst Books, $25): In a saucepan,
mix 1 tablespoon each soy and oyster sauce with 2/3 cup chicken stock, 2
tablespoons minced scallions, 1/2 teaspoon sugar and 1 teaspoon cornstarch.
Bring to a boil, then stir until thickened.;    Hoisin sauce;   Use this thick
soybean sauce as is for a barbecue sauce or mix in barbecue sauce recipes
instead of ketchup. You can even use it elsewhere as a sub for ketchup such as
in meatloaf (see recipe). Use as a dip or condiment for roast pork. Spread on
tortillas for a Mexican mu shu pork with carnitas.;   Or, try this delicious
hoisin marinade for chicken adapted from "Ken Hom's East Meets West Cuisine"
(Simon and Schuster, $19.95): Combine two teaspoons fresh thyme leaves, six
tablespoons hoisin sauce, four tablespoons rice wine and two tablespoons olive
oil. Split a chicken in half, lengthwise, and rub marinade on halves. Put in a
dish or plastic bag with rest of marinade and let rest at least one hour.
Grill over indirect heat or bake in a 400 degree oven.;    Chili sauces;
There are many styles, flavors and levels of heat, depending on whether
they're from Thailand, Vietnam or China. Use them as dips for fried foods by
themselves or mixed with soy sauce and chopped scallions. Add to meatloaf
instead of ketchup (or hoisin sauce). Or make a delicious barbecue glaze with
sweet Thai chili, red wine vinegar (to cut some of the sweetness) and fresh
chopped basil. Follow as above for hoisin marinade.;   Wines;   Chinese rice
wine (shaoxing): Substitute for sherry or sherry vinegar in recipes. Use it in
marinades for chicken, fish or pork with scallions, ginger, garlic and soy
sauce.;   Sherry: Use in vinaigrettes, in Chinese dishes that call for rice
wine or to deglaze a pan with sauteed chicken breasts or pork medallions.;
Sake: Use in salad dressings, dips for fried foods (with soy sauce) and
marinades for grilled dishes.;   Madeira or Marsala: Deglaze a pan with
sauteed chicken, turkey or veal. Use Marsala to flavor Italian pastry creams.;
  Port: Poach fruit such as pears.;   Ginger;   When fresh, grate fine and use
in marinades, salad dressings and in salsas with fruit (mangoes are especially
good). Or make a simple chutney with leftover jam. Take a half jar of orange
marmalade, peach or apricot preserves, add a tablespoon of ginger (fresh or
candied) and a teaspoon of mustard seeds, if you have them. You can stick
candied ginger inside cored apples with butter and lemon juice and bake them
for a simple dessert now that apples are coming into season.;   Capers;
Throw them in with sauteed veal, chicken or turkey with lemon juice and white
wine or vermouth.;    Anchovies;   Mix a small amount in salad dressings (it
doesn't have to be Caesar salad). Swirl some into beef or lamb stew. Or mix
with garlic and put into slits made in leg of lamb.;   Pickled jalapenos;
Use on pizzas; in mayonnaise, sour cream or yogurt dips; in fruit chutneys and
salsas; and in pasta sauces.;    Star anise;   The best beef stew I've ever
eaten (at Food Street in Mountain View) was loaded with this. It can
substitute for regular anise or fennel.;   Pimentos or roasted peppers;
Saute in olive oil with onions and garlic and throw in a can of drained
cannellini beans for a great side dish. Or toss with green beans, broccoli or
zucchini.  </TEXT>

part of a national environmentalist group's annual butterfly count. Each year
around Independence Day, volunteers traipse through target areas, from the
Coyote Hills in Fremont down to Alviso, to identify and record the presence of
these delicate and richly variegated insects.;    After a bit, the O.s. --
also known as the woodland skipper -- jumped from Marzo's nose to her
eyeglasses, and then woodland-skipped off. Its presence was duly noted on a
score sheet, beside the anise swallowtails, checkered whites and, yes,
monarchs.;    Lane, the educational director of the Santa Cruz Museum of
Natural History, was leading some of the 15 volunteers who met in the San
Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge in Fremont. His charges -- Marzo of
Union City, Barbara Blackford of San Leandro and David Schurr of Oakland --
were equipped with pocket picture books, one net and some butterfly
fundamentals they picked up at a pre-expedition slide show.;    The four spent
most of the day probing plants, squinting into the sun and occasionally
netting the odd insect for inspection.;    The effort does more than simply
tally butterflies, Lane said. "Butterflies are a great tool to assess
environmental change. They're really the canaries-in-the-mine as environmental
indicators.";    And what do they indicate about the environment these days?
His answer isn't exactly a shock: "Loss of habitat.";    "These simple, silly
butterflies are a way to show people what the world is really made of . . .
its phenomenal complexity," he said. "It's a microcosm of everything that's
going on.";    Salt lovers; Throughout the morning, Lane used his position as
butterfly point man to do a little preaching, and teaching, too. For instance,
he explained that butterflies can only drink their nourishment, and that they
like salt.;    So he demonstrated that a woodland skipper often will happily
perch on someone's nose. ("But you didn't really have a sweaty nose," he
assured Marzo.);    Other butterfly facts the volunteers learned:;    (check)
"Butterflies are flying sex machines. All they are here to do is find a mate
and lay some eggs.";    (check) It doesn't hurt a butterfly to pick it up
carefully by the wings. "As long as I don't harm the membrane of the wing,
it'll be fine," Lane said.;    (check) Natural Bridges -- not Pacific Grove --
is the best place to see monarchs.;    The three volunteers, all active in
other environmentalist activities, made a good audience for Lane. But politics
aside, they also expressed appreciation for the butterflies' intrinsic value,
oohing at the fine, colorful details of the temporary captives.;    Before the
day ended, they would visit three more sites, including the Coyote Creek
Riparian Station, proposed site for a baseball stadium for the San Francisco
Giants. The volunteers then turned in their tally sheets to be compiled with
those of others.;    National tally;  The totals won't be known for a couple
of days. The bay results, along with those from 123 other tallies nationwide,
will be evaluated by the Xerces Society, a national conservation organization
devoted to invertebrates.;    "I grew up liking butterflies," said Blackford,
who brought her own net. "I collected them when I was small where I grew up
(in Oakland). There were thousands of them.";    Condos replace habitat;
They're mostly gone now, she added ruefully; they've given way to condominiums
and parking lots.;    Schurr's interest is more recent. As a birdwatcher, "I
decided it's time to learn a little something about butterflies.;    "All this
fits together, you know," he said. "The trees and birds and plants and
butterflies -- it's all one big story."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     Another easy combination is this ginger vanilla sauce, from the 1988
"Sunset Recipe Annual" (Lane Publishing, $19.95): In a bowl, stir together 3/4
cup vanilla yogurt and 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger.;    Or try honey-almond
dip, from the California Strawberry Advisory Board: 2/3 cup non-fat yogurt; 3
tablespoons toasted, slivered almonds, finely chopped; and 2 1/2 tablespoons
honey. Whisk until smooth.;  STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE; 2 pints strawberries,
lightly rinsed, hulled, and quartered;  1/4 cup plus 2 teaspoons sugar; 1 cup
whipping cream;  1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract; 8 biscuits (see recipe below);
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted;   Toss strawberries in a bowl with the
1/4 cup sugar. Let them stand at room temperature for 2 hours, stirring
occasionally.;    Combine cream with vanilla and the remaining 2 teaspoons
sugar, and whip until thick but soft. Cover the bowl loosely and refrigerate.;
   Just before serving, halve the biscuits and brush the bottoms with melted
butter. Spoon some strawberries with their juice and a dollop (or two) of
whipped cream on each biscuit bottom. Cover with the biscuit tops at an angle.
Serve immediately. Makes eight servings.;    One serving with biscuits: 403
calories; 5 gm protein, 39 gm. carbohydrate, 26 gm. fat, 80 mg. cholesterol
and 280 mg. sodium.;    BISCUITS:; 2 cups all-purpose flour; 1 tablespoon
baking powder; 1 teaspoon sugar;  1/2 teaspoon salt; 5 tablespoons unsalted
butter, cold;  3/4 cup half-and-half;   Heat oven to 450 degrees. In a large
bowl, mix flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. Cut the butter into small
pieces and cut it into the flour using two knives, a pastry blender or your
fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.;    Add the
half-and-half and stir gently until the mixture forms a mass. Gather it into a
ball.;    Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface. Knead it for about
30 seconds, and then pat it out to form a 3/4-inch-thick rectangle. Using a 2
3/4-inch cookie cutter, cut out eight circles, using up all the dough.;
Arrange the biscuits about 1 inch apart on a baking sheet. Bake until puffed
and golden, about 14 minutes. Transfer the biscuits to a wire rack and allow
them to cool.;    -- From "The New Basics" by Julee Rosso and Sheila Lukins
(Workman Publishing, 1989).;    (hbox); STRAWBERRIES EN CHEMISE; 1 cup sifted
powdered sugar (more if needed); 1 teaspoon egg white (more if needed);  1/4
teaspoon fresh lemon juice;  Drops of cognac or more lemon juice, as needed;
24 large fresh strawberries, washed rapidly and laid on a rack;   Place sugar,
egg white and lemon juice in a small high-sided mixing bowl and beat one
minute or more with an electric mixer or wire whisk until sugar forms a stiff
mass that makes stiff points when a bit is lifted in the blades of the beater.
Thin out with a drop or two of cognac or more lemon juice -- the icing should
be thick enough to enrobe strawberries. Holding a berry by its topknot, swirl
it in the frosting to cover 2/3 of the way up its sides, and replace on rack.

<LEADPARA>  TIRED of using the same old herbs and spices and getting the same old tastes?
Answering "yes" to the above earns you a ticket to Hebert's lecture on "New
Seasonings For Tomorrow.";    No one knows exactly when our ancestors started
using seasonings to improve the taste of their foods. Man's first taste of
cooked meat presumably came after he accidentally dropped a piece of meat into
a roaring fire, waited until the fire died out and then ate the meat. Later,
he used a stick to remove the meat from the fire before it cooked into ashes.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Food  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  SURPRISING WAYS TO SEASON YOUR FOOD  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Food and Wine  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     It was the taste of smoky meat that enticed our ancestors to seek seasoning
agents. Salt may have been the first, though some give black pepper primacy.;
  Here are some seasonings to whet your appetite.;    (check) CHOCOLATE -- As
strange as it might seem, chocolate is considered by many chefs to be the
seasoner for meat dishes that call for a rich, dark sauce.;     CHOCOLATE BEEF
STEW;  3 pounds beef, cut into 1/2-inch pieces;  3 tablespoons virgin olive
oil;  1 cup onions, chopped fine;  3 cloves garlic, pressed;   Salt to taste;
1 teaspoon flour;  2 bay leaves;  1 cup white wine;  1/2 cup water;  1
tablespoon white vinegar;  1 tablespoon grated bitter chocolate;   In a deep
saucepan, saute the beef in the olive oil for one minute. Add onion and garlic
and cook 2 minutes. Add flour and salt, mixing well. Add remaining
ingredients, except the chocolate. Cover and cook on low-medium heat until the
meat is tender. Remove the meet with a slotted spoon and keep warm. Add
chocolate to the sauce and stir until well mixed. Strain the sauce and serve
it either on the beef or separately. Serves 6.;    (check) COFFEE -- Billions
of cups of coffee are consumed daily, but few people realize that coffee is a
great seasoner. For example, the next time you make hamburgers, add 1/4 cup of
coffee to the mixture. When you want a special treat try spreading a mixture
of 1/4 cup butter, 2 tablespoons coffee and 1/4 teaspoon crushed anise or
fennel seeds inside your favorite bird. And don't pass up this marinade for
meats.;      COFFEE/RED WINE; MARINADE;  1 cup red wine;  1/2 cup cold coffee;
 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary;  1/2 teaspoon dried thyme;  1/2 teaspoon dried
chervil;  2 teaspoons salt;  1/4 teaspoon pepper;  1/2 cup vegetable oil;
Combine all ingredients in a glass or ceramic bowl and whisk until well mixed.
Use for marinating lamb, chicken or beef. When grilling, use the marinade for
basting. Yield: 2 cups.;    (check) CAPERS -- Long associated with fancy
European dishes, capers are often overlooked by American chefs. They have a
slight sting that has earned them the name "mountain peppers.";     TURKEY
BREASTS WITH; CAPER/LEMON SAUCE;  12 thin slices raw turkey breast;   Salt and
pepper to taste;   Flour; 3 tablespoons virgin olive oil;  1/4 cup white wine;
 1/4 cup chicken stock;  3 tablespoons capers;  2 tablespoons minced parsley;
1/2 lemon;    Salt and pepper the breasts. Dip them in the flour and saute
them in the oil until they are done. Remove and keep warm. Pour off all but
one tablespoon of oil, then add wine, stock, the juice from the half-lemon,
capers and parsley. Cook over high heat to reduce and thicken the sauce. Pour
over breasts.;    (check) ANCHOVIES -- The clever chef can turn ordinary
dishes into extraordinary dishes with the help of the anchovy. It is the main
ingredient in the making of the great Italian dipping sauce bagna cauda. Most
salad dressings, like this one below, can get a boost from a touch of
anchovy.;     ANCHOVY SALAD DRESSING;  9 tablespoons virgin olive oil; 1 large
clove garlic, pressed; 3 anchovies, minced; 3 tablespoons wine vinegar;   Mix
all ingredients together. Let dressing stand an hour before using. Serves 4.;
  Wine suggestions: With the Chocolate Beef Stew, try 1987 Beaulieu Rutherford
Cabernet Sauvignon, a big, rich wine that is very drinkable now and will get
better in the next five years.;    With the red wine/coffee marinade used for
beef, try a 1988 Clos du Bois Pinot Noir, a spicy wine with cherry and vanilla
overtones. If a fowl was marinated in the mixture, try a 1989 Callaway
"Morning Harvest" Chenin Blanc -- dry, a wine loaded with the fresh flavors of
peaches and pears.;    With the turkey breasts, try the 1987 J. Lohr Seven
Oaks Paso Robles Cabernet Sauvignon, a wine whose aging in American oak has
imparted a vanilla and spice taste.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  EVERY November, our friend Lupe prepares an elaborate feast of chicken
tamales, candied pumpkin and delicate chocolate merengues for her son, Tomas.
She spends hours shopping for and cooking his favorite foods, eagerly
anticipating how her labor of love will delight him.;   When the feast day
arrives, Lupe packs up her treats, along with some beer, two or three packs of
Marlboro cigarettes, candles and a huge armful of fiery orange marigolds. She
closes up the house and heads off to see Tomas where she always visits him --
at the cemetery.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  THE LIVELY FOOD OF MEXICO'S DAY OF THE DEAD  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Patricia Quintana, an expert on Mexican cooking, is the author of "Taste of
Mexico" and "Feasts of Life." Meg Rose is a New York free-lance writer.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Along with millions of others, Lupe is observing one of Mexico's most
important and ebullient holidays, the Day of the Dead. Celebrated every year
on Nov. 1 and 2, the Day of the Dead is the ultimate example of the Mexican
people's historic adaptability and unique perspective on mortality.;
Contrary to medieval Spain's dark perception of death, indigenous Mexican
religion saw it as just one step in an unending cycle of being.;   Thus, when
the Spaniards introduced the Mexican people to All Souls' Day -- the day when
the faithful prayed for unredeemed souls trapped in purgatory -- some
adjustments had to be made. Rather than a time for solemn prayer, it became a
day of honor -- a buoyant, colorful, bountiful feast that celebrated the lives
of those who had passed on. And it was renamed "El Dia de Los Muertos," the
Day of the Dead.;   Muertos is celebrated today much the way it was hundreds
of years ago.;   Families arrive at cemeteries with armfuls of food and
zempasuchil (marigolds), crowding the once-silent grounds with brilliant
colors, wonderful smells and lively chatter.;   As with every other great
Mexican holy day, food plays a central role in the Muertos celebration. How
could a family better express its love for the deceased than by preparing all
the wonderful foods they enjoyed in life? There is also the hope that the
aroma of spicy dishes will reach the dead and lure them back for the holiday.;
  About a week before Muertos, bakeries fill up with wonderful breads prepared
specifically for the occasion. These rich, heavy loaves sometimes have painted
porcelain heads embedded in their dough or are decorated with braids and
painted with food coloring.;   And at the cemeteries, steaming hot tamales
made with corn husks or banana leaves are placed in huge piles on the graves,
along with rich moles of every variety and a kaleidoscope of colorful flowers,
candies and cookies. In the small villages outside of Huejutla in the state of
Hidalgo, musicians accompany masked performers as they dance atop tombstones
throughout the day on Nov. 2.;   After the deceased have had ample opportunity
to enjoy their food, families relax and feast on what's left, sometimes using
the tomb itself as a sort of picnic table. They then share their ofrendas with
visitors and others who may not have sufficient food to go around.;   The
significance of Muertos is never more apparent than at this moment. While so
many cultures tremble in death's shadow, Mexicans have long danced in a
playful minuet with mortality. This celebration is part of our life-long
fiesta, the last and forever-recurring feast that bridges life and death and
feeds both body and soul.; (hbox);   This special bread is traditionally
shaped in the form of a man, woman or child for the Muertos celebration.;
CANDIED FRUIT BREAD; 1/2 cup lukewarm water; 1 ounce active dry yeast (1
heaping tablespoon); 8 generous cups flour; 1 tablespoon whole anise seeds; 1
cup granulated sugar; 1 tablespoon salt; 10 eggs; 3 cups butter; 3/4 cup
finely chopped candied figs; 3/4 cup finely chopped citron; 3/4 cup finely
chopped candied pineapple; 3/4 cup finely chopped candied pumpkin (optional);
Powdered sugar;  Place lukewarm water in medium bowl. Add yeast and stir until
well dissolved. Add about 1 cup flour and stir until mixture can be shaped
into a ball. If necessary, add a little more water. Cover with clean cloth and
set aside in warm, draft-free spot.;   Place remaining flour on flat surface.
Form well in center of flour and fill with anise seeds, granulated sugar, salt
and eggs. Knead ingredients together, evenly incorporating them. Knead 15-25
minutes until dough becomes elastic and is no longer sticky. (You may knead
with food processor if preferred; it will drastically reduce kneading time.);
 Add yeast mixture and continue kneading until dough is silky. If dough is too
dry (depending on climate and quality of flour), add a little milk to moisten.
Gradually add butter and knead dough until soft. Shape into single ball and
place in greased bowl. Coat with a little oil and cover with clean cloth.
Place in warm, draft-free place until dough doubles in size. Punch down. Cover
and refrigerate overnight.;   The next day, add candied fruits to dough,
kneading briefly. Shape dough into a human figure or make a braid. Place on
greased baking sheet. Cover with cloth and allow to rise again, for 1 hour.;
Bake at 375 degrees 30 to 40 minutes or until bread is golden brown. Remove
from oven and allow to cool. Before serving, sprinkle with powdered sugar.
Serve warm with butter, preserves and cups of hot chocolate. Makes 8 to 10
servings.; (hbox);   No Muertos altar is complete without freshly made flan.;
FLAN (CARAMELIZED EGG CUSTARD);  Burnt Sugar Topping:; 2 1/2 cups sugar; 1 1/3
cups water;  Custard:; 10 eggs plus 4 egg yolks; 2 cups sweetened condensed
milk; 2 cups whole milk; 2 1/2 cups evaporated milk; 2 tablespoons vanilla;
To prepare Burnt Sugar Topping, combine sugar and water in heavy saucepan.
Stir well. Simmer over low heat until sugar completely dissolves and mixture
is dark brown in color. Pour burnt sugar into 10-inch ungreased ring mold,
tipping mold to evenly line bottom. Allow to cool.;   To prepare Custard, beat
eggs and egg yolks together. Pour the 3 milks in separate mixing bowl and stir
well. Blend eggs with milk, then stir in vanilla. Pour custard into prepared
ring mold. Place in pan filled with 1 inch of water. Bake at 350 degrees 1 1/2
hours or until wooden pick inserted into center comes out clean. Allow to
cool, then refrigerate overnight. Unmold before serving. Serve chilled. Makes
8 to 12 servings.; (hbox);  CANDIED SWEET POTATOES WITH CINNAMON AND CLOVES

brown sugar, packed; 2 cinnamon sticks, each 3-inches long; 6 whole cloves;
Potatoes:; 4 large yellow sweet potatoes (1 pound each), peeled; 1/4 cup
butter, melted;  To prepare Syrup, pour water into medium saucepan. Add
sugars, cinnamon sticks and cloves and cook 2 1/2 hours or until syrup is
thick.;   Arrange sweet potatoes in large baking dish with lid. Pour melted
butter over potatoes. Bake, covered, at 350 degrees 2 hours or until done,
basting sweet potatoes with butter every 20 minutes. Test with toothpick or

  [Text] The Political Forces Dialogue Committee concluded
its meetings in Aden, the economic and trade capital, yesterday
by endorsing the Document of Pledge and Accord to build the new
Yemeni state. The document was reached through an agreement
among all parties participating in the dialogue.
  This national document covers the following important issues
covered by the political forces dialogue:
  The accused in disorder cases:
  The document calls for firm measures to arrest fugitive
suspects in cases of assassinations, assassination attempts, and
highway robberies, and in other security violations. It also
calls for immediate legal and public trials for those arrested
in order to implement legal measures and penalties against the
accused without delay. The Political Forces Dialogue Committee
opposes any leniency or hesitation on the part of the competent
forces to take firm legal measures against those involved in
terrorist acts. It affirms the need to expeditiously issue the
regulations governing the carrying of firearms, ensure
compliance with them, and review the current law to make it
tougher in order to limit arms carrying, arms proliferation, and
arms trade, and to make sure that there are no camps or centers
for terrorist training as well as to take the appropriate
measures regarding this.
  Regarding the security and military aspect, the document
affirms the need to remove all checkpoints inside and outside
the cities, whether these checkpoints are affiliated with the
Interior Ministry, Defense Ministry, or both ministries. The
Interior Ministry will be responsible for defining the places in
which security interests require security points, provided that
it cooperates with the Defense Ministry to define the joint
military and security checkpoints.
  The document also calls for general reconciliation among
tribes to stop Yemeni bloodshed. In accordance with this
reconciliation, no acts of revenge will be taken, and anyone who
takes revenge will be considered an outlaw. The competent state
organizations will take firm legal measures against these
outlaws and will define the cases -- which would prompt revenge
-- which took place before the date on which the declaration was
issued. The military units -- which were stationed in the
outskirts in some areas in the Governorates of Ta'izz, Lahij,
Abyan, Shabwah, al-Bayda', and Ma'rib -- will be redeployed in
areas agreed upon by a technical committee from the Armed
Forces. No military patrols will be deployed in the cities, or
along the roads. The police will be in charge of this in
accordance with security requirements. An intelligence organ
will be established in accordance with the law that will define
its structure, tasks, and powers to safeguard national
sovereignty. The document calls for discussing the methods to
end the unofficial armed presence, including the distribution of
weapons to citizens under any pretext. Any such act will be
considered a crime.
  It calls for reorganizing the Ministry of Interior in a way
that the various security units, including the central security
forces, will be incorporated into it, so the ministry will have
control over them.
  It calls for the withdrawal of the armed forces from the
cities, and their redeployment during a period not exceeding two
months in accordance with a consolidated central plan to
reposition, merge, and reorganize them.
  It also calls for a commitment not to move any military
units
or troop or equipment reinforcements, to suspend the
implementation of military exercises, and to confine the
military police's role to that of keeping the security and
promoting the discipline of military units. The military police
will be prevented from carrying out any activity or patrols
which conflict with the duties of the public security. Any
manifestation, or measure, or conduct which would suggest
distinction or preferential treatment among the armed forces
personnel will be banned.
  The officers and soldiers of the armed forces will be
prevented from intervening in the affairs of both citizens and
local authorities. They will also be prevented from carrying
out any activity in their workplaces that would conflict with
the functions of the judicial and executive authorities.
  Recruiting, arming, and mobilizing military units, militias,
the Border Guard, the Popular Guard, and similar units will be
halted, and the units recently formed will be disbanded.
  With regard to assessing the relationship and defining the
powers, the document stresses the need to embody the
Constitution, laws, and by-laws in practice; to spell out the
tasks and powers the Presidential Council, its chairman, and its
vice chairman will enjoy in the course of the performance of
their constitutional duties; and to reconsider the duties and
prerogatives of the Presidential Council Office accordingly.
  The disbursement of public funds outside the purposes
defined
in the general budget's current expenditure and development
expenditure will be banned. There is a need to abide by the
powers defined for disbursement. The powers regarding
disbursement for senior state officials will be defined.
  With regard to the bases of building a modern state and its
bodies, the dialogue committee affirmed that the major task lies
in building the state and repairing the problems from the
previous phase. Our experience since the formation of the
Republic of Yemen on 22 May 1990 has shown that the way of
running state affairs has been an obstacle to the merger of the
two former regimes and to building a united state.
  With regard to the organization of the central authority,
the
document explained the following: The House of Representatives
is the legislative body of the Republic of Yemen, and it is
elected by the people through secret, free, and direct
balloting. The Constitution defines the House's powers, duties,
terms of membership, and its means of nomination and voting.
  The Consultative Council comprises an equal number of
members
representing the local administrative units. These members are
elected by the governorates' councils. The Constitution defines
the number of members from each and every administrative unit,
membership terms, and the method of nomination and voting.
  The document also defines the tasks and powers of the
Consultative Council. The document states that the presidency
of the state constitutes the sovereign power of the state and is
composed of the Presidential Council, which includes five
members elected by the House of Representatives and the
Consultative Council together. The House of Representatives
elects a president and a vice president from among its members.
The term of membership of the Presidential Council has been set
to two electoral terms. The document also identifies the powers
and tasks of the Council as set by the Constitution. It also
defines the tasks and powers of the president, the vice
president, the Presidential Council members, the government, and
the judiciary.
  With regard to local government, the document affirms that
it
must be based on a new administrative configuration of the
Republic of Yemen, revoking the existing administrative
structures and units through which the country will be fully
merged and all manifestations of partition will disappear.
  The document of pledge and accord also defines the powers of
local administration, which shall be based on direct and free
elections. It also defines financial, administrative, economic,
social, security, educational, health, and social services.
  In the field of rebuilding and reorganizing the armed
forces,
the document considers the reorganizing of the armed forces one
of the major issues. The armed forces shall be affiliated
directly with the government. No side shall be authorized to
form a military or semi-military force. A general plan shall be
prepared to rehabilitate, merge, and reorganize the armed forces.
  In the field of education, the document stresses the need to
unify school curriculum. The document urges the formation of a
higher national security council and the identification of its
tasks. The document also stresses the need to reactivate the
central audit and control bureau as a body that is independent
of the executive power. It shall be directly affiliated with
the legislature.
  In the field of economy and financial organization, the
document sets a number of steps aimed at abiding by a general
state budget that defines expenditures and revenues and
nourishes the economy in all fields.
  The document urges abidance by the current Constitution
until
it is amended, providing that an action shall be carried out to
make constitutional amendments within a period of three months
and not exceeding five months.
  The document stresses the need to give the government all
powers and not to interfere in its work in order to enable it to
execute its tasks. The government shall set timetables to
accomplish the set tasks within a month.
  The Political Forces Dialogue Committee shall supervise and
follow up the implementation of the decisions stipulated by the
Document of Pledge and Accord between the parties to the
dialogue of political forces to establish a modern Yemeni state.
  Regarding the necessary security arrangements and conditions
to sign the agreement and begin to implement it, the document
stipulates that a committee should be formed comprising the
parties to the dialogue. The committee shall make the necessary
arrangements to provide the required security conditions to sign
the agreement and establish guarantees for the beginning of
implementation, in coordination with the president and [word
indistinct]. A date shall be set in light of the arrangements
that will be reached.
  Afterward, the participants to the dialogue of the political
forces signed the Document of Pledge and Agreement.
  The meeting also endorsed the formation of a committee to
follow up on the implementation of the seventh paragraph of the
pledge document on making preparations and providing security
conditions to endorse the document in a final manner and to
specify the guarantees for its implementation. The committee
comprises the following brothers:
  Shaykh Sinan Abu-Luhum; Brigadier General Mujahid
Abu-Shawarib; 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anisi; Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim
al-Iryani; Jarallah 'Umar; and [first name indistinct] Ahmad
Jabir, the committee's rapporteur.

<HEAD>Perfume Helps Cows Get Along Better, Produce More Milk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLASSEE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists looking into ways of boosting
milk production have discovered the sweet smell of success in anise
oil.
   Dairy cows got along better when sprayed with the
licorice-scented fragrance, and when cows feel at ease, they give
more milk, say researchers Keith Cummins and Lawrence Myers of
Auburn University.
   ``Most people seem to find a little bit of humor in it,''
Cummins said last week. ``I try to emphasize that this has a
serious application, but it makes me smile, too.''
   Cummins said dairy cows must be regrouped every two to four
weeks to maximize production and feed efficiency, forcing the
animals to re-establish their ``pecking order.'' That results in
biting, pushing and shoving. Cows become nervous and upset, and
milk production drops.
   The loss for a 500-cow dairy could amount to 500 to 700 pounds
of milk a month or more, Cummins said. ``At $14 per 100 pounds, it
adds up,'' he added.
   Anise spray reduces aggression among cows, Cummins said. As the
smell wears off _ usually about the third day _ the pecking order
is already being established.
   Does that mean cows like perfume?
   ``It wasn't because the sprayed cows smelled good,'' Cummins
said. ``What we did was make it so the cows couldn't tell one from
the other.''
   Cummins said research in animal behavior is becoming more
important because of the animal rights issue.
   ``Intensive farming methods are being challenged as to whether
they are humane or not,'' he said. ``So we have to do more research
to make these cows as happy and contented as possible.''

Not so very long ago, basil was, for all intents and purposes, something dried
that came in a jar and was used in making spaghetti sauce. Now fresh basil is
constantly called for -- in salads, soups, sauces, and as a seasoning for
cooked vegetables. Pesto -- the Italian sauce made of basil, Parmesan cheese,
garlic, olive oil and pine nuts -- was a novelty less than a decade ago. Now
it's so ubiquitous it sometimes seems as conventional as catsup.
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, fresh basil has become a year-round commodity on the order of
fresh parsley. Still, it is at its sweetest and best, its most abundant and
least expensive, when grown under the hot summer sun.
</P>
<P>
There are about 45 varieties of Ocimum basilicum, most of them edible and most
of them delicious. In addition to the familiar sweet basil, there are:
</P>
<P>
* Lettuce leaf basil, milder than the standard but with leaves so large they
can be used as wrappers for such items as giant shrimp or strips of chicken
breast.
</P>
<P>
* Piccolo basil, a very ornamental plant whose tiny, highly aromatic leaves are
perfect in herbed oils, pasta salads and similar foods where the bits of basil
should be small but the darkening cut edges of larger leaves would be
unattractive.
</P>
<P>
* Opal basil, whose primary claim to fame is the rich burgundy color of leaves
and stems. The flavor is there, but it's less pronounced and less sweet, and
many find purple pesto more disconcerting than delightful. It does make pretty
herb vinegar, though, and is a fine garnish for pale foods.
</P>
<P>
* Flavored basil is known primarily to gardeners, though well-stocked farm
stands or fancy greengrocers may offer lemon basil, anise basil and cinnamon
basil, all of which do taste like their namesakes. Holy basil is sacred in
India, where it is used in religious rituals, but its fine fragrance is not
accompanied by good flavor, and it isn't (or shouldn't be) used in cooking.
</P>
<P>
* Thyrsiflora basil, also called Thai basil, is the sweetest and most aromatic
of all. Since Thai cuisine seems to be sweeping the country, we can hope the
bright-green leaves of Thyrsiflora will soon be more widely marketed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, big bunches of good old sweet basil are everywhere -- at
supermarkets, farm stands, green markets. This is the season to make big tomato
and basil salads, to shred leaves into the sauteed zucchini and stuff them
under the skins of chicken breasts. Now is the time to put up the pesto. Don't
forget to leave out the garlic if you're going to freeze it; frozen garlic can
turn bitter after only a month or two.
</P>
<P>
And now is the time to experiment a bit, using basil with fruit, for instance,
or to moderate between hot and sweet. It does both in the following, a very
pretty one-dish summer dinner that takes much longer to tell than it does to
make.
</P>
<P>
 Since preparation is quick and cooking is even quicker, be sure to have all
ingredients (including the diners) ready before you turn on the heat.
</P>
<P>
SLIGHTLY THAI WILTED SALAD
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound lean pork (tenderloin or leg), cut in 1/8-inch-thin strips
</P>
<P>
2 fresh hot red chiles (5 inches long and 1/3-inch wide at stem end)
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup chicken stock
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon lime juice
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon soy sauce
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon brown sugar
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons peanut oil
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon minced ginger root
</P>
<P>
2 large cloves garlic, coarsely minced
</P>
<P>
1 scant cup Thyrsiflora basil or 1 heaping cup sweet basil (small leaves and
tips only)
</P>
<P>
2 medium nectarines, cut in 1/2-inch chunks (about 1 cup)
</P>
<P>
Tender inner leaves of 1 medium head romaine lettuce, shredded into ribbons
(about 8 cups)
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup thinly sliced green onions, including about 1 inch green part
</P>
<P>
Plain rice or thin egg noodles
</P>
<P>
Place pork strips on paper towels in single layer and pat dry. Slit hot chiles,
remove half of seeds and cut pods crosswise into thin strips. Place cornstarch
in small bowl, stir in chicken stock, lime juice, soy sauce and brown sugar.
</P>
<P>
Heat large wok over high heat. Add oil, hot chiles and ginger. Cook, stirring
constantly, until chiles are rich brown and ginger is golden. Remove with
slotted spoon and add to chicken stock mixture.
</P>
<P>
Quickly add pork to wok and stir-fry just until meat is white. Stir in garlic,
basil and stock mixture. Bring to boil. Add nectarines. Continue to cook,
stirring, just until fruit is hot and sauce is slightly thickened. Add about
2/3 of lettuce, stir well and remove wok from heat.
</P>
<P>
Make bed of remaining lettuce on serving platter. Arrange pork mixture on top
and sprinkle with green onions. Serve at once with rice or noodles. Makes 4
servings.

  [Excerpts] An Egyptian diplomatic source in Cairo today
revealed that the United States has embarked on contacts with
Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, in an attempt
to end the fighting and start a dialogue between the two parties
to the conflict in Yemen. The same source added that the three
Arab states can ensure indirect dialogue between northern and
southern Yemenis and that they have played a mediatory role
since the beginning of the crisis in Yemen. The source said
this mediation aimed at safeguarding Yemen unity without using
force. The same source said these three Arab states will ask the
northerners to agree on a cease-fire in exchange for canceling
the southerners' unilateral declaration of independence.
  Sanaa took this clear U.S. stand seriously. In the wake of
this U.S. stand, Yemeni Planning Minister 'Abd-al-Karim
al-Iryani announced that the government in Sanaa is holding
contacts with some Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leaders to agree
on holding a dialogue. Al-Iryani, who is close to President
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, added that his government is ready for a
cease-fire in exchange for YSP's recognition of Yemen unity,
which was declared in May 1990 and which has been abandoned by
the southerners.
  Al-Iryani said: Following the secession decision, we cannot
deal, hold a dialogue with, or find a place in politics for YSP
Secretary General 'Ali Salim al-Bid or Haydar Abu-Bakr
al-'Attas, who was charged with forming the government of the
new southern state.
  The second factor which could have influenced the Sanaa
decision is Aden's reiteration today that the southern forces
have regained the combat initiative from northern forces that
had infiltrated over the past three weeks of the fighting.
[passage omitted]
  'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, who reiterated the northern forces'
control over Abyan, Lahij, and Shabwah Governorates, today
admitted that the objective of entering Aden by all means, which
was announced by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, no longer exists. He
said: There might not be a need to enter Aden, as the political
solution could be reached before this. The northern minister
said the Sanaa forces are maintaining their positions on the
eastern front, adding that the northern forces are now preparing
supply bases before moving to the east toward Hadhramaut, where
al-Bid has moved.
