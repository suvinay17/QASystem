<LEADPARA>  Commissioner Fay Vincent on Monday presented a grim scenario of baseball's
financial health, disclosing for the first time that at least eight teams had
not been profitable in 1990.;    Vincent, returning to his office after an
81-day absence caused by health problems, implied that escalating salaries
threaten baseball. He likened them to the junk-bond market of the 1980s.
"Things that look like they make no sense, make no sense," he said.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  See related article this page  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     To underscore his point, Vincent said that at least 10 and possibly as many
as 12 teams can be characterized as having "serious problems." Although he did
not name them, the teams are believed to include the Pittsburgh Pirates, the
Seattle Mariners, the Houston Astros and the Milwaukee Brewers.;    The
Mariners, Vincent pointed out, expect that their total revenues for the coming
season will not match the payroll of the Boston Red Sox.;    Vincent said
"it's hard to convince people there are financial problems," given the huge TV
contracts baseball signed last year and the four-year, $21 million contract
that the Red Sox gave pitcher Roger Clemens last week.;    One person hard to
convince is Donald Fehr, executive director of the Major League Players
Association.;    Asked whether a lot of clubs lost money last season, Fehr
said: "I have no way of knowing if the commissioner's definition of losing
money is the same as mine. For example, the Pirates' losses are all
attributable to their payment of collusion damages. To that extent, they can
claim they lost money, but they're writing off four or five years of expenses
in one year.";    Asked about the commissioner's assertion of "financial
problems," Fehr said, "This kind of advance predicting for the sake of
predicting is curious, given their apparent lack of concern as they negotiate
salaries this winter.";    Economic analysis;    Economists interviewed by the
Associated Press also said big contracts can be justified.;    "It wouldn't
surprise me if $5 million is not unreasonable for Roger Clemens," said Lou
Guth, senior vice president of National Economic Research Associates and a
former economic consultant for baseball's Player Relations Committee. "The
problem isn't with Roger Clemens. The problem is with the middle guys, the $2
million guys with minimal, marginal contributions.";    Asher Blass, a senior
economist with Lexicon Corp., also says the Clemens deal might make sense from
an economic standpoint. "He might pay his way," Blass said. "With the national
and local TV revenue and if they draw 2 1/2 million a year with concessions,
the possible gross is $40 million.";    Blass' doctoral dissertation at
Harvard dealt with the economics of major league baseball.;    "The money is
being spent," he said. "If these salaries were uneconomical, you'd observe
team prices going down. The new franchises are priced at $95 million, and
there are no shortage of takers at that price.;    "It suggests the industry
remains profitable.";    Pirates' problems;  In Pittsburgh, Pirates President
Carl Barger said he is resigned to losing some of the club's marquee players
in the next two years.;    "We can't afford to keep them all," Barger said.;
 Barger made his remarks after outfielder/infielder Bobby Bonilla rejected the
Pirates' four-year, $15.5 million offer. Bonilla, who is asking for nearly $20
million, has threatened to play elsewhere if the Pirates don't sign him to a
long-term deal before his arbitration hearing Thursday.;    The unprecedented
salary escalation over the last five years "keeps going from one plateau to
another . . . and it puts you in a position where you can't keep all of your
home-grown players," Barger said. "Each time we have a further spiraling, I
say it's got to be the end, then there's a signing like Clemens.";    Barger
called Boston's contract with Clemens "irresponsible.";    "It's another
classic example of how ownership is tearing the heart out of baseball for no
good reason," he said. "It was a double-barrel shock . . . the timing -- the
Friday before arbitration -- was incredible, and (the contract) beyond my
wildest imagination. I don't know whether to be angry or depressed.;    "One
of the things that worries me -- even more than the effect of the recession on
baseball -- is that baseball fans will just get sick and tired of hearing
about the economics and get turned off," he said.  </TEXT>

   Who's News:
   Danforth Revels in Role of Pirates' King
   ----

<LP>
   PITTSBURGH -- It's a cool, damp night at Three Rivers
Stadium, and Douglas D. Danforth sits in a heated luxury box,
a scorecard at his side. The retired Westinghouse Electric
Corp. chairman peers out at the field, where the Pirates have
runners on second and third.
   The batter lines a single to right field. Mr. Danforth
leaps to his feet and waves the runners home. "Come on] Come
on]" he yells. Pirates 6, Los Angeles Dodgers 0. "What we
gotta do is get 10 runs ahead and stay there," he exclaims.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   His enthusiasm is understandable. Mr. Danforth became the
Pirates' chairman and chief executive officer two years ago,
instilling a tough bottom-line management style that marked
his years at Westinghouse. In the process, Mr. Danforth has
found new life after retirement, turning a favorite pastime
into a vocation.
   After a bleak season in 1989, the Pirates are giving the
67-year-old Mr. Danforth plenty to cheer about. The
high-flying Pirates have been baseball's biggest surprise
this year, leading the National League Eastern division.
What's more, management believes the scrappy club can sell 2
million tickets, enough to eke out a profit.
   In many ways, Mr. Danforth has far more problems running
the Pirates than he had leading a Fortune 500 company. Among
other things, at Westinghouse he never had to worry about
sore arms, rainouts and daily news coverage. "We only had to
go public once a quarter," he says with a sly grin.
   And he confesses to some frustration. "The biggest
difference in running the Pirates is that you're absolutely
helpless in what happens out there," Mr. Danforth says,
motioning toward the field. "In business, if you have a
product with a reliability problem, you can fix it."
   Nonetheless, Mr. Danforth's friends and family say he's
having more fun than ever with the Pirates. "When people hear
he's the CEO of the Pirates, they think that's the most
wonderful thing," says his high school sweetheart and wife of
47 years, Janet. "Then he'll say he was also the CEO of
Westinghouse, and they'll say, `Oh.'"
   The Pirates' turnaround is particularly sweet for Mr.
Danforth, who five years ago played a leading role in keeping
the team in Pittsburgh. He helped put together a
public-private partnership that bought the club at a time
when many here thought the debt-ridden, last-place team,
which was hurt by a drug scandal involving a number of its
players, was a blight on the city.
   Although those problems have been solved, the Pirates'
nine local corporate owners, including USX Corp. and PNC
Financial Corp., have discovered that owning a baseball team
isn't necessarily a field of dreams. Last season, the Pirates
finished fifth and lost $1.3 million because of an
arbitration ruling that found all baseball owners guilty of
collusion in 1985 and 1986.
   That has led to rumors that the club still may leave
Pittsburgh, its home since 1887. Under the 1985 buy-out
agreement, the team could be put up for sale this year. Mr.
Danforth, however, says only a financial collapse would lead
to a sale.
   The Pirates' chairman has become something of a
mover-and-shaker in the major leagues, heading two different
committees, including one in charge of expansion. The
responsibilities have made for a travel-packed retirement.
   Mr. Danforth has always been passionate about baseball.
Growing up in Syracuse, N.Y., he took dates to minor league
baseball games. He played catcher for Syracuse University --
"I was average but aggressive" -- and his gnarled fingers
evidence his years behind the plate. When he wasn't digging
curve balls out of the dirt, he earned a degree in
engineering.
   He is known for his cool and calculating temperament --
but not with men on base. "Helluva slide]" Mr. Danforth
bellows after the Pirates' Andy Van Slyke scores on a
sacrifice fly.
   But Mr. Danforth doesn't allow emotion to cloud his
management of the Pirates. When the Dodgers bring in a relief
pitcher, Jim Gott, Mr. Danforth says: "He's the guy we dumped
last year. He's got a sore shoulder, and he wanted a
guaranteed contract. We wouldn't give it to him. We pay for
performance."
   He also demands loyalty. He fired the team's general
manager, Syd Thrift, in 1988 after the Pirates had one of
their best seasons in years. Press criticism focused on Carl
Barger, the Pirates' president, even though Mr. Danforth is
chairman. "That's the sign of a good manager," says Bernard
Mullin, the Pirates' senior vice president for business
operations.
   "You've got to work within a structure and Syd couldn't,"
Mr. Danforth says. There are worse fates than being fired,
though. Mr. Danforth breeds llamas on his farm outside
Pittsburgh. A surly creature named Freckles once took a bite
out of his owner. "We made a rug out of him," Mr. Danforth
says.
   At Westinghouse, which has diverse lines of businesses in
broadcasting, financial services and manufacturing, Mr.
Danforth was a paternalistic but demanding executive who set
clear goals, expected them to be met and knew the numbers.
   His impatience with mistakes of any kind is clearly
evident at the baseball game. In the seventh inning, the
Dodgers mount a rally when the Pirates' left fielder boots a
line drive and a run scores. "Oh my God, that was a bad
play," grumbles Mr. Danforth, sipping a beer. "He didn't get
in front of the ball. A bad play."
   Moments later, another run scores when the pitcher drops
the ball covering first base. "Dammit]" Mr. Danforth yells.
Pirates 7, Dodgers 5.
   For the Pirates, Mr. Danforth establishes budgetary
guidelines and meets each year with department heads.
Although he isn't directly involved with player negotiations
and trades, he is consulted on virtually all moves that
affect the bottom line.
   The Pirates have about $38 million in annual revenue,
pocket change compared with Westinghouse's $12.8 billion. But
Mr. Danforth says the two organizations share at least one
attribute. "Marketing's the key, whether it's baseball or
lighting systems," he says.
   Playing in a mid-sized market, the Pirates will never have
the television revenue of teams in larger cities, although
the team must pay competitive salaries with clubs in New York
and Los Angeles.
   Then there's the rain; bad weather has kept attendance low
this season. "The weather has absolutely killed us this
year," Mr. Danforth sighs.
   The Dodgers don't, though. The game ends on a double play.
Pirates 9, Dodgers 5. "We had it all the way," Mr. Danforth
says.

<TEXT>
   It rained hard Saturday night along the Gulf Coast, and on Sunday morning the infield at McKechnie Field here was so wet that grounds crewmen were using plastic bottles to scoop up the standing water.
Yet even a soggy baseball diamond looked good to this refugee from Calgary and other points north.
Wet grass beats dry ice anytime.

   The prospect of a ball game also was welcome to the Pittsburgh Pirates, who make their spring home at ancient McKechnie.
They were anxious to open their Grapefruit League schedule Sunday afternoon against the Texas Rangers.
"Oh, yeah, we're ready," said Andy Van Slyke, the Pittsburgh centerfielder.
"Last year we came into spring training on a catamaran.
This time we got a battleship."

   The Bucs are still souped up by their good showing of late last season, when they won 27 of their final 38 games.
The surge put their full-season record at 80-82, good for fourth place in the National League East.
That might not have been braggable in some precincts, but fourth was the highest the team had finished since 1983, and it followed three straight years in sixth, or last, place.
Moreover, its 16-win gain over 1986 matched St. Louis in the Majors' "most-improved" category.

   Making the showing all the more impressive was the fact that the Pirates employed 49 different players in 105 different starting lineups during the campaign, challenging the New York Yankees' longtime hold on baseball's Team Turnover title.
"Things were so unsettled they were putting names on guys' uniforms with Velcro instead of sewing them on," said quipster Van Slyke.

   General Manager Syd Thrift engineered last season's shuffle, and while he does not rule out further moves, he implies they will be retail rather than wholesale.
"We now have a respectable team," he declares.

   The aptly named Thrift also has an economical team, because many of the 1987 departers were high-priced veterans.
The usual reasoning in these cases is that it is cheaper to lose with a young team than with an old one.
Traded away during the season were such vets as catcher Tony Pena (to St. Louis), pitchers Rick Reuschel and Don Robinson (both to San Francisco), shortstop Bill Almon (to the New York Mets), third baseman Jim Morrison (to Detroit) and second baseman Johnny Ray (to California).
Some of those guys could even play.

   But so, too, could some of the fellas Thrift acquired.
Probably his best deal was an April 1 one that brought in Van Slyke, pitcher Mike Dunne and catcher Mike LaValliere from the Cardinals for Pena.
Van Slyke, a lamppost in St. Louis, became a candidate for mayor of Pittsburgh by batting .293 with 22 home runs and 82 runs batted in.
LaValliere hit .300 and won a Golden Glove award.
Dunne led the Bucs' starting pitchers with 13 wins and a 3.03 earned run average.
The Cardinals won the pennant with Pena, but why be selfish?

   Other key Pirate pickups were relief pitchers Jeff Robinson, who came in the Reuschel trade, and Jim Gott, purchased for the $50,000 waiver price from Toronto.
Both arrived in August and gave the team the relief pitching it previously lacked.
The strapping Gott had 13 saves in 16 opportunities, and permitted just two earned runs in his last 27 innings.

   Home-grown left fielder Barry Bonds, Bobby's son, hit 25 home runs and stole 32 bases in his second big league season.
Second baseman Jose Lind did well enough in the minors to allow Ray to be traded, and hit .322 for Pittsburgh in 35 games.
Doug Drabek and Brian Fisher, acquired from the Yankees in 1986, started a total of 54 games and won 22.
None is older than 26.

   Indeed, except for 31-year-old pitcher Bob Walk, the Bucs could open the season without a player over 30.
That's OK with manager Jim Leyland as long as it doesn't become the season's focus.
"When you're as young as we are, it's tempting to look at the future instead of the here-now," he says.
"You improve by getting better today, not tomorrow.
That's what we'll be stressing and looking for."

   Leyland this spring will look particularly hard at his infield, which is untried except for first baseman Sid Bream.
Rookie Lind is at second base, rookie Felix Fermin and second-year-man Al Pedrique will vie for the shortstop job, and Bobby Bonilla, who last year proved he could hit (15 homers, 77 RBIs), is being moved to third base from first and the outfield.
The husky Bonilla is considered a question mark afield by some, but not himself.
"Playing third is just like playing first, except for the throw," he says blithely.

   Pitching, of course, is 81.3% of baseball, and Pittsburgh's is in the heretofore capable hands of coach Ray Miller.
He earned distinction in that post for a couple of American League pennant winners at Baltimore, so it is noteworthy that he believes his Pirate crew is potentially as able as his old Orioles flock.
"We've got 10-12 guys who can throw 90 miles an hour," he says.
"There ought to be a decent staff in there somewhere."

   Miller believes that pitching is more craft than gift, and hastens to note that this accent on velocity doesn't mean he has strayed from his mound dictum of "work fast, change speeds and throw strikes."
He avers that "all the speed in the world won't make a guy a winner if that's all he's got."
Yet he adds: "It's easier to change speeds when you can throw 90 than 80.
More effective, too."

   That this could be a brighter year for Pittsburgh was suggested in Sunday's spring opener.
Not only did the rain refrain, but the Bucs prevailed, 6-1, breaking a 1-1 tie in the eighth inning with a string of five hits and a walk.
Manager Leyland was pleased, but, this being spring, restrained in his elation.

   "Two bad things can happen after a season like we had last year: The kids can believe the people who say they've got it made, or the ones who say their improvement was a fluke," he said.
"I'd just as soon they forgot the evaluations for now, and read the funnies instead."

BEFORE FENWAY, BEFORE THEY WERE RED SOX, THEY WERE WINNERS;
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: IN THE FIRST WORLD SERIES IN 1903, THE AUTHOR'S GRANDFATHER WAS A
BATBOY.
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Those of us who dared to hope that baseball's league playoffs might produce a
rematch of the first World Series rivals, Boston and Pittsburgh, were done in
by the Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
Ah, well. The record books are one thing, but an oral history is something more
personal. Boston fans, such as myself, younger than 80 will not remember 1918,
the last time the Red Sox won a World Series.
</P>
<P>
But between that 1903 series and 1918, Boston won five of them, and that
generation, of which my grandfather was a part, actually was raised on the
unheard-of notion of regular championship teams. He was present at the
beginning, a 13-year-old batboy on the Pittsburgh bench in Boston in 1903.
</P>
<P>
The Baseball Encyclopedia dutifully records that Boston defeated Pittsburgh,
five games to three, in that classic, which began on Oct. 1. It was a
best-of-nine series, with three games played in Boston, then four in
Pittsburgh, and one back in Boston.
</P>
<P>
My uncle, Raymond A. FitzGerald Jr., now of New York, jotted some notes when
his father, my maternal grandfather, Raymond A. FitzGerald, was near the end of
a long and colorful life at 93.
</P>
<P>
In that conversation, my grandfather crossed decades of wars and depression to
recall the names of the entire Boston team, as if they were lifted from
yesterday's box score. My own check of the Baseball Encyclopedia bears out the
accuracy of that lineup, but in fact, there was a bit more detail in those
all-too brief late-life recollections, such as exactly what positions the three
outfielders played (not in the encyclopedia), and which player served as both
manager and captain (answer later).
</P>
<P>
Baseball fans today can be certain that the curtain's fall on Comiskey Park in
Chicago at the end of this season will only add to the growing legend of Fenway
Park in Boston as a grand and fabled old sporting place on America's landscape.
But a measure of how long ago 1903 was in baseball time is that there was not
yet any Fenway Park for that World Series. The games in Boston actually were
played at a field on Huntington Avenue.
</P>
<P>
The prestigious assignment of batboy, which would quicken the hearts today of
many a kid from coast to coast, was simply a matter of getting to the game
early and managing to be the first to grab the team bats off horse-drawn carts
when they arrived. It was not a chore that many turn-of-the-century youngsters
even thought to seek; and its glamour is conveyed mostly by the passage of
time.
</P>
<P>
It did not seem at all to be that big a deal to my grandfather, who in similar
fashion as a boy had managed to duck past the assembled dignitaries at a
ceremony to ride aboard the first subway car ever to run in America, from
Harvard Square to Park Street. As for the self-appointed role of batboy,
connections with the high and mighty in the baseball front office, which seem
today to be the ticket of admission to batboy status, mattered not a hoot.
</P>
<P>
Any 13-year-old could have done what my grandfather did in the 1903 World
Series, which was simply to get there on foot with a buddy early enough, and
then to say the right thing or wink the right way at the guy driving the
horses. These simple credentials were a mixed blessing, for they ensured also
that exalted batboy status for Game 1 on Oct. 1 of that year would have to be
earned again for subsequent games. After Games 2 and 3 on Oct. 2 and 3, the
series moved to Pittsburgh for the next four games, where presumably, some kids
would reenact their own similar ritual.
</P>
<P>
So a batboy took what he got. If that meant being a Boston kid working the
Pittsburgh bench, so be it. And with such a front-row view of the game, what
mattered? The memory lingered on.
</P>
<P>
After 80 years, my grandfather recited for my uncle the Boston squad: "Cy
Young, pitcher; Lou Criger, catcher; Bill Dinneen, pitcher; Candy LaChance,
first base; Hobe Ferris, second base; Freddy Parent, shortstop; Jimmy Collins,
third base, (and we learn from the oral history, also captain, and manager);
Patsy Dougherty, left field; Chick Stahl, center field; Buck Freeman, right
field."
</P>
<P>
And on the Pittsburgh bench with my grandfather was "the Flying Dutchman," the
great shortstop Honus Wagner.
</P>
<P>
I got to chat a lot with my grandfather about baseball over the years, and
savored what memories he could share as a vital link in the passage of
generations. His generation passed from the scene with the warm memory of
Boston victories -- for Boston did win that year, and again in 1912, 1915, 1916
and 1918 (and the National League Braves, then in Boston, won in 1914).
</P>
<P>
In those heady, boyhood days, the team was not yet even called the Red Sox --
they were the Boston Pilgrims, a name short on gut inspiration -- and he opined
to me later that the team in New York had a much lesser claim than Boston would
have had on the name, "Yankees."
</P>
<P>
My grandfather's coming of age was a time when Yankees were the dominant group
in the cultural and institutional life of Boston, and he remembered the signs
around town intended for him and his batboy friends that said, "No Irish need
apply." Basketball fans of Irish-American descent were to get their Celtics,
and there was a certain logic in his eyes that a New England baseball team
should have been called the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
My uncle, who describes himself as a member of the Jimmy Foxx generation, and
I, an eyewitness from the bleachers on a wonderful October night in 1975 when
Carlton Fisk kept America up late, and my 2-year-old daughter, whose Red Sox
teddy bear was her first toy and who went out to Anaheim this summer to see
Roger Clemens pitch, have all come up dry in three subsequent generations.
</P>
<P>
We who are the pained Red Sox fans of today have lost more than our dear
relatives and their first-hand recollections. We have lost the living memory of
longed-for victory.

MORNING BRIEFING: FOOTBALL'S SANDERS IS PLAYING BASEBALL
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some snickered when Deion Sanders, the fifth pick in the National Football
League draft last month, said he might play major league baseball instead of
pro football.
</P>
<P>
Or both.
</P>
<P>
Like Bo Jackson.
</P>
<P>
Through Friday, playing for the New York Yankees' upstate New York double-A
team, Albany-Colonie, Sanders was hitting .294 after 30 games, had scored 25
runs, hit one home run, driven in six runs, stolen 15 bases in 19 attempts, and
had a .384 on-base percentage -- aided by the fact he'd been hit by pitchers
six times.
</P>
<P>
The Yankees aren't sure what to make of their young center-field prospect, who
played 28 games in the Yankees' system last summer, including five in triple-A.
</P>
<P>
Is he playing minor-league baseball to get the Atlanta Falcons to pay him more
money? The Falcons drafted him as a defensive back out of Florida State.
</P>
<P>
Said Pete Jameson, the Yankees' assistant general manager: "Deion is getting a
taste of pro baseball life. His approach to the game is serious. He's a capable
double-A player who shows some major-league promise.
</P>
<P>
"No one should compare him to Bo Jackson. He'll never hit home runs like Bo.
He's a different kind of player. He's a much better outfielder, for one thing,
although he doesn't have the arm Bo has."
</P>
<P>
He's also a big winner.
</P>
<P>
Through Friday, Albany-Colonie had a 28-8 record, the best in professional
baseball.
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: The Dodgers were one of only four major league teams that opened
the season with no rookies on their roster. Name the other three.
</P>
<P>
Just say nyet: The USC football team will make two trips to Moscow next season.
On Sept. 2 in the Soviet Union, the Trojans will play Illinois in the Glasnost
Bowl. Four weeks later, they will travel to Moscow, Ida., which is just across
the Washington/Idaho border from Pullman, Wash., where they will play
Washington State on Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
Stray Bullets: The Washington Bullets were the only team in the National
Basketball Assn. that did not have a single player who shot 50% or better from
the floor.
</P>
<P>
One way to look at it: Stu Inman, director of player personnel for the Miami
Heat, which was 15-67 in its first season in the NBA, said his team enjoys a
unique position as it looks forward to next month's draft.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the more established teams in the lottery will go for need, whereas
we're not restricted by it," he said. "We need everything."
</P>
<P>
Fetch the keys: Television commentator Dick Vitale doesn't believe that the
Sacramento Kings will take Michigan's Glen Rice with the No. 1 pick in the NBA
draft, as Bill Russell, the club's executive vice president, has suggested.
</P>
<P>
"If Rice is in a King uniform on opening night," Vitale told USA Today, "I'll
be Russell's personal valet and chauffeur that night and maybe get Big Bill's
autograph. They'll either trade the pick or take (Duke's) Danny Ferry or
(Arizona's) Sean Elliott."
</P>
<P>
In a spin: Ron Kittle of the Chicago White Sox is 0 for 14 with 10 strikeouts
against right-hander Mike Boddicker of the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
"The last time I faced him, I took my bats and threw them in the whirlpool,"
Kittle said. "They went around and around, but they didn't hit anything."
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The Boston Red Sox, the New York Yankees and the Pittsburgh
Pirates.
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett, who is a minority owner of the
Miami Miracle, a Class-A baseball team that plays in the Florida State League:
"I like the fact that it's a non-polluting industry with no tall buildings."

<LEADPARA>  SO THE poor, working class Pittsburgh Pirates couldn't match the $29 million
contract the filthy rich New York Mets just gave to baseball slugger Bobby
Bonilla. That's the line from baseball owners and players who love to say the
national pastime operates in "free enterprise.";   In this thinking, the rich
teams in big markets get better by outbidding the small-market teams for
superstar players. This mythology is denser than Babe Ruth's potbelly.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     First, it doesn't explain why two teams from the smallest markets,
Minnesota and Atlanta, were in the World Series and the California Angels were
not and never have been despite spending a mint on superstars.;   The truth is
that major league baseball is a monopoly that earns much of its income from a
regulated, semi-monopoly -- the three television networks. Most teams play in
stadiums subsidized by taxpayers.;   To preserve the league and monopoly,
baseball teams need to protect the weakest teams from going broke, which means
cooperating in ways that would normally violate anti-trust laws. The amateur
draft is an example. Imagine all the hospitals in America taking turns
selecting medical school graduates, giving them no alternatives.;   Baseball's
monopoly used to be ironclad until the courts freed players from the grips of
owners. But all that really changed was that player salaries shot through the
roof, Bonilla's being only the latest.;   We could talk all we want about
owner-player agreements to cap salaries, but that, too, would be monopolistic.
It's futile to try to curb the high bidding, especially when owners are either
too dumb or rich to care.;   The real crime of baseball's monopoly is that too
many cities that can support major league baseball are shut out. They have to
root for minor league teams that exist merely to teach rookie pitchers how to
throw curveballs.;   There is no sound economic reason why the growing Phoenix
market (pop. 2.1 million) can't have a team when the Kansas City market (pop.
1.5 million) does. With a population of 18 million, the New York area could
support four teams, not just two. The Bay Area (pop. 6.2 million and two
teams) could support another in San Jose.;   Expecting the leagues and their
allies in Congress to break the monopoly is a dream. The best American
baseball fans can hope for is true expansion. I mean doubling or tripling the
number of teams, not just two new admissions once a decade.;   Even if big
stadiums are half filled, so what? The optimum stadium capacity for excellent
baseball viewing is about 35,000. Big Shea Stadium in New York doesn't inspire
poetry. But Fenway Park in Boston does. Who benefits from gigantic stadiums
with lousy views? Owners and superstars, that's who.;   True major league
expansion would bring smaller stadiums, better seats and lower prices to
happier fans and taxpayers.  </TEXT>

   Like many sports fans, Robert Frazier yearned to own a
sports team -- but couldn't spare the $90 million or so to
buy, say, a major league baseball franchise.
   In the end, though, the California business owner found a
way for an ordinary mortal to acquire an athletic team: He
focused on small sports and launched the Los Angeles Wings, a
bicycle team. Though sports fans by the million have never
heard of it, the team does compete in a national league. And
it cost Mr. Frazier all of $7,500 to get started in 1988.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While the cost of big-league sports teams has soared in
recent years, entrepreneurs find smaller leagues in minor
sports still offer plenty of opportunity. Besides charging
low prices for their franchises, many of the smaller leagues
struggle to hold down annual costs -- a break for team
owners, such as Mr. Frazier. "After three years we're right
where we wanted to be," he says. "We're anticipating breaking
even in the fourth year."
   Owning the Wings is a far cry from the financial strain of
owning many other teams these days. It cost investors $95
million just to get the right to start a major league
baseball team in Miami. Even minor-league baseball teams have
been changing hands for more than $1 million.
   When Mr. Frazier was seeking a sports team, a friend urged
him to try minor league hockey. But expected entry costs were
over $300,000, and the idea of minor league ice hockey in
Southern California didn't fire Mr. Frazier's enthusiasm. The
fledgling beach volleyball circuit also wooed Mr. Frazier, to
no avail.
   But when the National Cycle League offered Mr. Frazier its
Los Angeles franchise, he leapt at it. Though the league is
still only three years old, it is growing. "We had the chance
to get in on the ground floor," Mr. Frazier says. "And the
idea of over 90 million recreational cyclists -- and
potential fans -- out there appealed to me."
   A big problem developed almost immediately. The
well-established United States Cycling Federation already
dominated bike racing in the U.S.
   The NCL filed a suit against the federation in Los Angeles
federal district court in 1989, claiming that the USCF was
conspiring to kill the fledgling league. Among other things,
the NCL said the USCF threatened to suspend the racing
licenses of riders who race for NCL teams.
   The USCF denied any conspiracy to kill the new league. The
NCL withdrew the suit 60 days later when the USCF agreed to
stop threatening to suspend the racing licenses. Now Jerry
Lace, USCF executive director, says the established
federation would welcome an affiliation with NCL.
   "If they are going to make it, they will need our
support," Mr. Lace says. "We have the finances, the
infrastructure and the riders."
   However, teams in the little league hold some good cards
on their own. For the only race that the Wings were required
to host in their first season, costs totaled $8,000. Of
course, cheap means small: the NCL only had three teams that
first season.
   But there was an an ever bigger break. Unlike nearly every
other spectator sport, bicycle racing doesn't require a
stadium. In an NCL race, riders race around a one-mile loop
of city streets for 50 minutes, with a ten-minute half time.
Points are accumulated in sprints every three laps. The team
with the most points is the winner.
   The bad news is that the lack of a stadium precludes
charging admission, which increases reliance on fees from
sponsors. Revenue needs are low, however. This summer, the
league's third season, Mr. Frazier spent $48,000 for the
complete operations of his team -- less than half the annual
minimum salary for a single major-league baseball player.
Sponsorships and advertising revenue covered just over half
that spending, leaving a deficit for the season, Mr. Frazier
says.
   Some of the sponsorship money is generated directly
through the single home race, but most of the money comes
from selling advertising time on the league's local cable
broadcasts. Profits from television advertising sales vary
according to the market. Production costs for each hour-long
show are usually only about $7,500.
   Mr. Frazier also uses the bicycle races to help his
principal business, Frazier Aviation Inc., an aircraft-parts
producer in North Hollywood, Calif. He invites potential
customers to the home races, and offers them VIP treatment
while they watch the races.
   Of course, teams in the fledgling league have had their
setbacks. The New York team, struggling through its first
year, scheduled a race in early June near Manhattan's South
Street Seaport. Plans were foiled when the Persian Gulf War
welcome-home parade parked tanks on the course. The Gotham
Ghosts had to hold their race in a Long Island parking lot.
   Despite growing pains earlier, the league had a strong
season this year, Mr. Frazier says. "I believe we are here to
stay," he adds.
   Among other signs of growth, the number of NCL teams will
rise to 10 or 12 next year from the current nine, says Peter
O'Neil, the league's commissioner. Teams entering the league
next year will pay $250,000 instead of the $50,000 charged
for this year, he adds. But the increased fees are still
lower than those charged in many sports. Investors from
Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Toronto and Mexico City have
all expressed interest in the NCL, according to Mr. O'Neil.
   As one attraction, the league is still trying to curb
costs -- even as expenses in bigger sports skyrocket. The
commissioner last year received only $9,000 in salary plus
housing and expenses. (The salary is scheduled to rise next
year, but will still be only $35,000.) Riders earn only $50
to $500 a race. And there are no chartered flights in this
league. It's Supersaver seats on American Airlines, one of
the the league's major sponsors this year, along with
Volkswagen of America, the Miller Brewing unit of Philip
Morris Cos., and MCI Communications Corp.
   The NCL's approach has attracted some big names. Former
Pittsburgh Steeler Franco Harris is the principal owner of
the Pittsburgh team. Mr. Harris also heads the league's
merchandising arm, NCL Properties, which licenses use of the
teams' logos.
   The NCL is preparing for its fourth season, which will
start next spring, and Mr. Frazier hopes that the groundwork
for long-term success is in place.
   "If we can attract all those people who own bicycles," he
says, "this league will really take off."

<LEADPARA>  Carl Barger resigned Monday as the Pittsburgh Pirates' president to take the

however, Barger will virtually run both teams indefinitely.;    Baseball's

<MEMO>  Baseball Notebook  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Barger could remain in Pittsburgh until the end of the season even while
selecting key executives -- including a general manager and manager -- for the
Marlins.;    "Sure, you can create some sort of spectrum of conflict, but if
you do, you don't know me," Barger said. "I'll be happy to pass any oversight
test anyone wants to give me. . . . I'll devote 120 percent of my energies to
the Pirates as long as I'm here. I bleed black and gold.";    Barger's new
colors will be aqua and orange, which his close friend, H. Wayne Huizenga, the
Marlins' millionaire owner, chose for his new franchise. The Marlins will join
the National League with the Denver-based Colorado Rockies in 1993.;
Huizenga also didn't see any conflict of interest in Barger working for both
the Pirates and Marlins.;    "We don't have a club to run," Huizenga said.
"For Carl to spend a few more months with the team he helped build and
considers his baby, I see nothing wrong with that.";    Huizenga said Barger
will consult with him on decisions about the Marlins but will have "complete
authority" to run the team. Huizenga said he hopes to hire a general manager
in the next four months.;    Pirates Chairman Douglas Danforth, who also
chaired the N.L. expansion committee, said Commissioner Fay Vincent agreed
Barger could remain with the Pirates for the near future.;    "Based on what
Carl has done in the past, I have every confidence he will be able to handle
the responsibilities of both positions," Vincent said. "I can see how the
(conflict of interest) subject would come up. I'm not naive. But there is
nothing to that. I would think his duties with the Pirates would not last
long.";    Danforth said he would like Barger to remain with the Pirates
primarily to help negotiate a complicated stadium-lease agreement with the
city.;    Barger said he won't stockpile the Marlins' front office with
current Pirates executives.;    "There is an anti-tampering rule in baseball
which the expansion franchises are subject to," Barger said. "Beyond that, I
have a track record of 30 years of honesty and integrity. I would no more raid
or hurt this organization for the betterment of another organization than I
would fly to the moon.";  PALERMO UPDATE: American League umpire Steve Palermo
was improving and doctors upgraded his condition from serious to fair one day
after he was shot while trying to aid two robbery victims in Dallas.;    "We
still don't know much about his recovery time," American League President
Bobby Brown said. "We hope it will be brief.";  ETC.: Doctors have determined
that Milwaukee Brewers center fielder Robin Yount's recent health problem
resulted from a passed kidney stone. The Brewers said Yount might return to
the lineup Thursday. . . . Montreal pitcher Dennis "Oil Can" Boyd, who will
become a free agent after this season, has asked the Expos to either sign him
to a new contract or trade him. . . . Seattle Mariners second baseman Harold
Reynolds was named the recipient of the Roberto Clemente award for his
outstanding service to the community. . . . National League President Bill
White has urged the Rockies' owners to hire a minority in a high-profile
front-office position, the Rocky Mountain News reported. . . . New York Mets
first baseman Dave Magadan is suffering from a small cartilage tear in his
right shoulder and will require off-season arthroscopic surgery.  </TEXT>

IT ALL ADDS UP: OAKLAND'S STEWART IS THE BEST IN BASEBALL;
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS: A'S PITCHER EARNS TOP SPOT IN ANNUAL COMPUTER RANKING BY STATISTICS.
DODGER'S SCIOSCIA IS TOP-RATED NL CATCHER.

<P>
The Oakland A's may not be the best team in baseball, but they do have the best
pitcher, according to computer rankings compiled by the sport's statisticians.
</P>
<P>
Dave Stewart edged Roger Clemens of the Boston Red Sox, 95.984 points to 95.783
on a scale of 100, the Elias Sports Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Stewart has won 20 games or more the last four seasons and was the MVP of the
American League playoffs this season.
</P>
<P>
"There's nobody I'd rather have than Dave Stewart," A's Manager Tony La Russa
said. "He hasn't missed a start in four years."
</P>
<P>
San Francisco outfielder Kevin Mitchell was the top-rated non-pitcher, third in
the overall rankings at 94.759. Mitchell repeated in the National League
outfield, but Lonnie Smith of Atlanta and Barry Bonds of Pittsburgh replaced
Tony Gwynn of San Diego and Eric Davis of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
The rankings, created as part of the 1981 and 1985 strike settlements, are used
to determine free agent compensation. They are based on such statistics as
batting average, plate appearances, home runs and RBIs for hitters, and starts,
innings, ERA, saves and strikeouts for pitchers. Statistics from the 1989 and
1990 seasons are used and averaged.
</P>
<P>
The top 30% in each category are Type A free agents and their former teams get
two draft choices as compensation if they sign with a new team. The next 20%
are Type B players and their former clubs get one draft pick, while the group
making up the 10% below that are Type C players. Their former clubs get a
special draft pick if they don't re-sign.
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who isn't a free agent, having signed a $7-million, two-year contract
extension during the season, took over the top spot from Kansas City
right-hander Mark Gubicza. Clemens was the highest-rated player in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Ryne Sandberg of the Chicago Cubs led National League second basemen for the
seventh straight season in ranking by position, while Barry Larkin of
Cincinnati ended Ozzie Smith's six-year run at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
Mike Scioscia of the Dodgers replaced Tony Pena, then with St. Louis, at
catcher.
</P>
<P>
Will Clark of San Francisco led NL first basemen for the third straight year.
Tim Wallach of Montreal led the league's third basemen, replacing Bobby Bonilla
of Pittsburgh, who in 1989 ended Mike Schmidt's eight-year reign.
</P>
<P>
Doug Drabek of Pittsburgh replaced Orel Hershiser of the Dodgers as the
league's top starting pitcher. Drabek was 22-6 with a 2.76 ERA.
</P>
<P>
Rob Dibble of Cincinnati was the top reliever, replacing Mark Davis, who signed
with Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
In the American League, Stewart's teammate, Dennis Eckersley, led relievers for
the third straight year. Eckersley had 48 saves and a 0.61 ERA.
</P>
<P>
Catcher Carlton Fisk of the White Sox also led his position for the third
consecutive season. Fisk hit .285 with 18 homers.
</P>
<P>
Mike Greenwell of the Boston Red Sox repeated as the top-rated AL outfielder,
but Robin Yount of Milwaukee and Ruben Sierra of Texas replaced Kirby Puckett
of Minnesota and Jose Canseco of the A's.
</P>
<P>
Fred McGriff of Toronto became the fourth player in four years to lead AL first
basemen while Steve Sax of the New York Yankees replaced Julio Franco of Texas
at second base. Alan Trammell of Detroit won at shortstop, while Wade Boggs of
Boston was the top third baseman for the third time in four years.
</P>
<P>
Dwight Evans of Boston and Dave Parker of Milwaukee tied for the lead among
designated hitters. Evans was told Wednesday that the Red Sox will not exercise
his option for the 1991 season.

EXCEPT AL WEST, DIVISION RACES WORTH WATCHING

<P>
In mid-August of a season that has produced a spring training lockout, a prison
sentence for baseball's all-time hit leader and a permanent suspension of the
New York Yankees' owner, attention may finally focus on what remains of the
pennant races.
</P>
<P>
What is the status of the season with 6 1/2 weeks remaining, that half-week
being the rescheduled fallout of the season-delaying lockout?
</P>
<P>
Who's alive? Who's not?
</P>
<P>
It can be said with some certainty that one race is already over.
</P>
<P>
The Oakland Athletics, bidding for a third consecutive American League pennant
and threatening to build a dynasty in an era of parity, have virtually wrapped
up the Western Division title, burying everyone except the surprising Chicago
White Sox in what was thought to be baseball's strongest division.
</P>
<P>
The A's and White Sox are currently playing a three-game series, but regardless
of the outcome, it seems inconceivable that the A's -- with their arsenal of
weapons and the best home and road records in baseball -- will blow a lead of 5
1/2 games to an overachieving team that has been forced to use an average of
almost four pitchers a game, straining what has been a productive bullpen.
</P>
<P>
For the A's, who have won eight of their last 11 games, the final 6 1/2 weeks
will be used primarily to heal -- principally Jose Canseco's injured back and
Rickey Henderson's tender hamstring -- and to gear up for the playoffs, though
Manager Tony La Russa never allows the A's to gear down.
</P>
<P>
It is worth noting that Oakland's 77-44 record before Monday's loss was the
same as it was in 1988, when the A's won 104 games and finished with a 13-game
lead, and was four games superior to last year's, when the A's won 99 games and
finished with a seven-game lead.
</P>
<P>
If the A's win 99 again, requiring a modest pace of .550, the White Sox will
have to win 29 of their final 43 to tie, a .674 percentage compared to their
.588 pace for the season.
</P>
<P>
The A's might not have iced the champagne yet, but they have chilled the
division. Of the hot races elsewhere, it may be a concern to baseball that so
few teams are involved.
</P>
<P>
There is still hope for some in the mathematics, but in reality it comes down
to the Boston Red Sox and Toronto Blue Jays in the American League East, the
Pittsburgh Pirates and New York Mets in the National League East, and the
Cincinnati Reds, Dodgers and San Francisco Giants -- provincially stretching
some -- in the National League West.
</P>
<P>
AL EAST
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox, who lead the Blue Jays by one game, will play a four-game series
starting Thursday in Toronto and a three-game series against the Blue Jays in
Boston on the final weekend of the season.
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox have won five of six from the Blue Jays and seem to have an edge in
the schedule considering: a) they will play their final eight games at home
while the Blue Jays play their final nine on the road, and b) they will play 23
of their final 42 games at home, where they are 38-20, compared to 27-35 on the
road.
</P>
<P>
Both the Red Sox and Blue Jays have been enigmas, to some extent.
</P>
<P>
Boston led the league in team batting as of Monday but was 12th in runs, 13th
in home runs, 14th in stolen bases and first in two categories it would prefer
not to be: number of times shut out and number of double plays grounded into.
</P>
<P>
Toronto leads the league in runs with 600, an average of 4.9 a game, but is
seventh in earned-run average, the inconsistent performance of a staff
considered one of the deepest and best having diluted that consistently potent
offense.
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays, however, had lowered their ERA from 4.38 in May to 4.24 in June
to 3.90 as of Monday and approached the stretch with six sound starters: Dave
Stieb (16-4), Jimmy Key (8-6), David Wells (9-3), Todd Stottlemyre (11-13),
John Candelaria (7-5) and John Cerutti (8-8). All have been down this road
before.
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox, after Roger Clemens (18-5) and Mike Boddicker (11-8), have been
operating with mirrors. How Greg Harris (10-5) and rookies Tom Bolton (7-2) and
Dana Kiecker (4-5) hold up remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
Also, only time will tell if the Red Sox can survive without relief ace Jeff
Reardon, whose anticipated late-September return from a back injury is still
uncertain. Since July 21, when Reardon blew a save in his last appearance, the
Boston bullpen is 1-4 with with five saves and three blown saves.
</P>
<P>
Rob Murphy, who is 0-6, has now been replaced as the closer by a 27-year-old
rookie appropriately named Jeff Gray. Nothing with these two teams is black and
white.
</P>
<P>
NL WEST
</P>
<P>
The Reds, seeking to become the first team since introduction of the 162-game
schedule in 1961 to lead wire to wire, have six games left with the Dodgers and
four with the Giants.
</P>
<P>
They also play their last nine games at home, while the Dodgers play their last
nine and 20 of their last 41 on the road, where they are 28-33.
</P>
<P>
Trailing by 5 1/2 games, the Dodgers are 5-7 against the Reds and will
seemingly have to sweep those six games while avoiding a deadlock in six games
with the Giants.
</P>
<P>
It's a tough road in many ways, particularly since Tim Belcher has joined Orel
Hershiser on the disabled list. Jim Neidlinger and Mike Hartley must get used
to their major league starting roles amid the pressure of a stretch drive. They
are all "must" victories for the Dodgers now, and 22-year-old Ramon Martinez
carries the burden of ace.
</P>
<P>
The Reds, although they boast the league's top ERA of 3.31, are in something of
a similar bind. Danny Jackson is on the disabled list with a shoulder injury
and may be lost for the season, Tom Browning is temporarily sidelined by a
sprained ankle, and Jack Armstrong has lost six of his last seven decisions.
Rick Mahler, Scott Scudder and rookie Chris Hammond, 14-1 at Nashville, are
being asked to pitch some key games.
</P>
<P>
The Reds opened the door again for the Dodgers and Giants by losing four in a
row to the Pirates during the weekend, but pitching wasn't as critical as the
absence of key hits.
</P>
<P>
The Reds are second in the NL in team batting but seventh in runs. Eric Davis,
representing the heart of the order, is batting .224, unable to shake a
yearlong slump. The Reds have gotten this far before. They may need heart in
more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
NL EAST
</P>
<P>
The Mets and A's share baseball's best home record of 40-22, but the Mets play
only 19 more games at home, compared to 23 on the road, where they are 28-29.
</P>
<P>
The Mets, three games behind, are 6-4 against the Pirates but play six of their
remaining eight games against the Pirates in Three Rivers Stadium, including
the last three of the season.
</P>
<P>
The Pirates will play 23 games at home and 19 on the road, and have played well
everywhere in response to predictions that they would fold, yielding inevitably
to the Mets.
</P>
<P>
The fact is, Pittsburgh is solid top to bottom, with MVP candidate Barry Bonds
at the forefront of an offense featuring Bobby Bonilla, Andy Van Slyke and Jeff
King. The Pirates also have a deceptively deep pitching staff that has a better
ERA than the celebrated Mets, 3.53 to 3.63.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen pitchers -- one shy of the major league record -- have posted at least
one win for the Pirates, and eight have registered at least one save.
</P>
<P>
Doug Drabek (16-5) has emerged as a stopper in the rotation, Zane Smith is 2-0
since his win-now acquisition from Montreal and rookie Randy Tomlin has a 1.93
ERA in three starts since his recall from double A, taking the place of Bob
Walk, on the disabled list with a groin strain. And Monday night, Neal Heaton
(11-8) got his first victory since June 24.
</P>
<P>
The Mets have outscored the Pirates by 29 runs, but Darryl Strawberry has only
three homers in his last 26 games and Kevin McReynolds three in his last 46.
</P>
<P>
The Mets have that splendid pitching and a 68-51 record under manager Bud
Harrelson, but the Pirates have shaken off each of New York's challenges,
creating the impression that these Bucs may not stop here, which would be one
of 1990's biggest stories -- on or off the field.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

   Boos for the Pirates' `Killer B's'

   Pittsburgh -- You know you are in Pittsburgh when you get
in a cab at the airport, tell the driver to take you to a
local installation of a national hotel chain and he asks,
"You mean the one donton?"
   You also knew you were in Pittsburgh when, on Monday's
opening night for the National League East champion Pirates,
many in attendance at Three Rivers Stadium greeted the
introduction of the home team's slugging "Killer B's" --
Barry Bonds and Bobby Bonilla -- with another "B" word,
"Boo]"
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bonds, winner of the league's most-valuable-player award
last year, distinguished himself in the off-season by being
awarded a 1991 salary of $2.4 million while losing an
arbitration battle with the team. His subsequent muttering
culminated in a spring-training shouting match with manager
Jim Leyland, during which Leyland was heard to say that if he
ran the team to suit Bonds, his "butt would be managing a
7-Eleven store somewhere," and soon.
   Bonilla finished second to Bonds in the MVP voting. His
losing arbitration case netted him $2.3 mil. The team then
reportedly offered him a four-year, $16 million deal, but he
refused it and his agent characterized later Pirate
bargaining bids as "grandstanding." Bonilla says he'll
probably be a free agent after this campaign, and trade
rumors involving him abound.
   At a time when the average Major League player's salary
exceeds $800,000, and baseball fans discuss paychecks as
readily as prospects, no team rattled the teller's cage
louder than the Pirates in the time twixt the seasons. Doug
Drabek, the team's pitching ace, won a record arbitration
award of $3.4 million. Andy Van Slyke, Bond's and Bonilla's
outfield mate, just signed a three-year pact, effective next
year, worth $12.6 million, the game's fourth-largest on an
annual basis. Pitcher Chuck Heaton, who is making a modest
$1.1 million, raised some eyebrows by remarking that in
today's climate a $600,000 annual salary amounts to
"dogmeat."
   Pirate management, meantime, bemoaned its city's
"small-market" status and allowed that, at those rates,
winning might have become more than it could afford.
   To say that the local burghers swallowed that talk like so
much Rolling Rock would be an overstatement. "There's a
recession on, and here you have people {the players} making
millions {of dollars, of course} and complaining about it.
It's sickening," said Scott Davidson, a roofer from New
Brighton, Pa.
   "Management let a good guy like {first baseman} Sid Bream
go {to Atlanta, via free agency} but they gave the
complainers millions {bucks again}. Where's the justice in
that?" asked Kate Rau, a technical writer from Allison Park.
   It's worth noting, however, that Mr. Davidson and Ms. Rau
were doing their grousing at Three Rivers Stadium, after
having paid to watch the Pirates open against the Montreal
Expos. That is the curious thing about fan reaction to the
salary boom: The more they moan, the more they go to the
ballpark. In 1989, the Major Leagues drew a record 55.2
million people during regular-season action, and last year's
figure fell just 350,000 short of that despite an owners'
lockout that delayed opening day.
   As was reported in this newspaper Monday, every year it
costs more to attend a game than it did the year before; Team
Marketing Report, a sports newsletter, put this season's
day-at-the-park tab for a Typical Family of Four at $76.22,
up 9% from 1990 (although I thought the kids might have done
without those two, $7.85 baseball caps). The newsletter did
not mention anyone having to put a gun to the head of the
household chief to force that expenditure.
   And, indeed, last year, when player salaries also were too
high, the Pirates drew a record 2,049,908 people, and
reserved-seat price increases of $1 or 50-cents here this
year didn't halt a boost in season-ticket sales to 15,000
from 11,000, which alone works out to about 320,000 more
fannies in the seats seasonlong.
   "It is American to complain about money. It is also
American to sit in a ballpark on a sunny day watching the
geometrically perfect game of baseball," declared Pirate fan
Bill Gerstner, an oil-company purchasing agent from Butler.
"I see no conflict in doing both."
   Neither did others who paid to show up on an unseasonably
warm evening in a number -- 54,247 -- that set a Pirate
single-game record for the 105-year-old franchise. Recurrent
episodes of misty rain did not disturb them noticeably, and
while a 7-0 Montreal victory, on a one-hit pitching effort by
veterans Dennis Martinez and Barry Jones, wasn't what they
came to see, it sufficed.
   Apparently voting that he ought to be managing the Bucs
instead of a 7-Eleven, the fans gave manager Leyland a
standing "O" at intro time, and showed that they weren't
totally Bond-proof by cheering that fella when -- what else?
-- his line-drive, seventh-inning single spoiled Martinez's
no-hitter.
   Afterward, in the sanctity of their locker room, the
Pirates gave every indication that they were glad to see the
preseason end and the season begin. The loss, said Leyland
after tipping his cap to Martinez's pitching acumen, was "one
game of 162. I really like this team, and one loss won't
change that."
   Across the way, Bond interrupted his postgame meal to
voice much the same sentiment. "It's just one game," he
noted. "We'll be back tomorrow."
   Bonilla is, generally, a type whose face forms smiles more
easily than frowns, and he allowed that he found the
commencement of hostilities especially welcome. "You put
other things aside when the season starts," he said quietly.
But to a television reporter's question about "the mood in
the clubhouse," he looked aghast.
   "The mood in the clubhouse?]" he exclaimed. "This is just
day one]"
   But he added: "Look around. Ain't nobody throwing stuff.
That must mean the mood is good."

   The pennant race in the American League's Western division
is over, but the drama continues around the cellar-flirting
Seattle Mariners baseball team.
   Actually, the strength of the division makes that standing
misleading: The Mariners are having their best year ever on
the field. It's the cash register that's the problem: not so
much the attendance, which at two million is double the
team's average prior to last year, but the other moneymakers
in modern sports -- television contracts, advertising, luxury
boxes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mariners majority owner Jeff Smulyan, a radio
entrepreneur, blames the Seattle business community for not
backing him up on his big play. Two years after taking over
the team, there's worry he'll use an escape clause in his
lease at the local Kingdome after 1992.
   With player costs mushrooming, Mr. Smulyan projects losing
a total of $20 million this season and next. Not only does he
want the locals to cover the gap, but he says he'll need an
additional $7 million annually to manage a "competitive"
effort. The invoice is due this fall, he says.
   The city is sensitive to owner infidelity because it was
jilted once before, in 1970, when after only one year a
franchise called the Pilots moved to Milwaukee to become the
Brewers. Seattle sued Major League Baseball and forced the
placement of a new team there in 1977. Shortly after the
premiere, however, the town decided it had better things to
do.
   The Mariners were taking so many bad hops by 1985 that
local officials offered better terms. Those concessions will
amount to $28 million by 1996, according to one unsympathetic
politician. This is the sort of stuff (kickbacks from food
and beverages, parking) that sports moguls typically are able
to wangle from local government -- in addition to the
building of bold stadiums like the indoor Kingdome, of
course.
   But Mr. Smulyan is going a bit further. He wants the dough
delivered to the front door. The home county obliged by
helping to buy up empty seats for remaining dates this
season. Other ideas have government making payments on a
Mariner bank loan, or acquiring a stake. Some people believe
the value of sports franchises will continue to rise come
fair winds or foul, and therefore presume a capital gain for
the taxpayers from ownership.
   Seattle wouldn't be the first town to pay up front for the
pleasure of a team's company. In 1985, Pittsburgh floated a
$20 million bond to assist a group buying the Pirates. The
resulting interest-free "equity participation loan" looks a
lot like stock, as no repayment is due until sale of the
team. Montreal just did a sweetheart loan for the Expos. But
actual municipal equity would be unique for big-time pro
sports, if you don't count a community corporation that holds
football's Green Bay Packers.
   Whatever form public assistance took in Seattle, it would
amount to one more drain on taxpayers. Some say fine. Slade
Gorton, a Republican U.S. senator from Washington (and the
man who, as state attorney general, sued to get the Mariner
franchise), drew an interesting parallel in a recent Rotary
speech: "In a way, major-league baseball contributes to the
community in a manner similar to that of the city's art and
cultural establishmentand is almost as unlikely to show an
annual net profit in monetary terms."
   Further, whatever the authorities come up with is likely
to be more than matched by the local businesses that are
roped into the "partnership." But corporate expenditures
usually lead to tax write-offs (advertising, entertainment),
so even that will reflect on public policy.
   Seattle's is just one of many strapped franchises chasing
the rich teams around the budgetary base paths. The M's
revenues are at the bottom end and about 40% of those of the
New York Yankees, for example. Television contracts are the
big difference, and it's going to take a lot of Public
$piritedness to keep pace with the Big Apple bucks.
   Meanwhile, the ante in this game goes up and up. Areas
outbid each other in erecting playing palaces. (Tampa-St.
Petersburg even put one up in the mere anticipation of a
team; it now woos the Mariners.) And one public-sector plunge
isn't the end of it: Witness the fact the Pittsburgh
operation is still shaky, even as it has won two straight
division titles.
   The Pirates' experience belies the notion that making the
Mariners "competitive" will get them over the long-run
financial hump. Indeed, tapping the tax till in places such
as Seattle may simply allow the fat cats of Major League
Baseball to put off an obvious reform such as sharing local
broadcast revenues with their less-blessed brethren in this
Congress-approved trust.
   Even without some great equalizer, Seattle-sized cities
can take heart from evidence that a big population base no
more predicts success on the field than winning ensures
financial soundness. This bit of unorthodoxy comes from
Michael Canes, an economist with the American Petroleum
Institute. As a baseball fan, Mr. Canes naturally loves
statistics. For a recent academic paper, he examined who has
won and lost since baseball's last big expansion in 1969
(omitting the Mariners and Toronto's Blue Jays, both born
later).
   He found that the five American League teams with the most
winning seasons were, in order: Boston, Baltimore, New York,
Detroit and Kansas City. Baltimore and Kansas City are lesser
markets. In the National League, the top five were Los
Angeles, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, New York and St. Louis --
only two were top-tier cities.
   The biggest losers in the American were Cleveland (a
runaway last), Chicago and California (LA/Orange County). In
the National, it was San Diego, Atlanta and Chicago. Half are
in larger markets.
   Mr. Canes conceded that "team expenditures are positively
related to winning. But "city size has little influence on
winning." His suspicion is that a good front office, one that
picks the right players and makes it pleasant to come to the
ballpark, matters most.
   Which brings us back to Mr. Smulyan. Maybe he's done all
he can in a town that loves "caffe latte" more than Cracker
Jack and has fewer kids per capita than anyplace outside of
San Francisco (hence, less demand for autographs, souvenirs
and foot-long hot dogs). Certainly others did worse before
him.
   In that case, if baseball is going to be Darwinian within
its 28-team universe, it might be best simply to have
franchises routinely die off. In reaction to the Canes paper,
one academic suggested emulating European soccer and
regularly booting out the worst two squads, in favor of the
best pair from the minors. (I can hear the cheers all the way
from Buffalo.)
   That might not finish the Mariners after this year's .500
season, but it would be curtains for Cleveland (sorry about
that new stadium, folks). Some high-priced jocks would have
to change addresses sooner than usual, but as it is they seem
to stay in one uniform only long enough to collect on
appliance endorsements and be hauled into court for divorce
or drunkenness.
   Better shut up now, cynic, you're headed for extra
innings. See, you needn't be second-tier to get an attitude.
Try following the Angels in Dodgertown.

$18.5 million contract.;   Finley was 18-9 with a 3.80 ERA in 34 starts for

   Baseball owners are doing better than ever,
increasing their operating profits by 75 percent in 1989 to a
record $214.5 million, according to financial figures obtained by
The Associated Press.
   The 26 teams took in a record $1,241,059,000 in 1989, a 23
percent increase from the previous season. Their operating expenses
were $1,026,550,000, a 16 percent increase from 1988.
   That left them with a pre-tax operating profit of $214,509,000,
or an average of $8.3 million per team. The previous record profit
of $121.6 million was set in 1988 on earnings of $1,007,519,000,
baseball's first billion-dollar season.
   The figures were obtained by the AP from two baseball sources on
the condition they not be identified.
   It was the sixth consecutive season baseball teams increased
their operating profits. Because of the accounting practices of the
various teams, financial figures for 1990 will not be available
until next year.
   Chuck O'Connor, the head of management's Player Relations
Committee, said the figures showed that baseball ``on an overall
basis was doing quite well.''
   ``The difficulty with it,'' he said Tuesday, ``is that you have
to get below the aggregate figures to determine the level of health
of the individual parts that make up the game - the 26 clubs.
There, there's a different story. You can't look at the overall
industry profits and say, `Therefore, my team in Pittsburgh is in
great shape' or `My team in Kansas City is in great shape.'''
   O'Connor said that four clubs lost money in 1989 but that the
figure would become nine based on an apportioned share of the
tentative $280 million collusion settlement.
   Baseball has boomed since the mid-1980s. According to figures
released by the commissioner's office in the past, the 26 teams
lost $66.6 million in 1983 on revenues of $521.6 million, then cut
the losses to $41 million in 1984 and $7.1 million in 1985.
   The teams made $11.5 million in 1986, the season after began
shunning free agents. Two arbitrators found the conspiracy
depressed player salaries and the profit soared to $103.3 million
in 1987.
   In the four years following the start of the conspiracy, the
teams made a total operating profit of $450.9 million.
   However, as part of the tentative settlement of the collusion
cases, owners have agreed to give the Major League Baseball Players
Association a payment that would amount to $280 million as of Jan.
2. Interest will be added if the payment is made after that date.
   One source said that approximately 50 percent of the 1989
revenues came from tickets sales, parking and concessions.
Approximately 20 percent came from national radio and television
contracts, 20 percent from local broadcasting contracts and the
remainder from postseason games, advertising and other
baseball-related revenue.
   Approximately 31.5 percent of the operating revenue was spent on
player salaries, the source said.

NAMES AND NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
* Gold Medal: John Hoover became the 17th member of the 1984 U.S. Olympic
baseball team to reach the major leagues when he pitched in relief for the
Texas Rangers Wednesday night against the Detroit Tigers. Hoover, however, was
sent back to Oklahoma City Saturday. Of the 20 Olympians in '84, only three
failed to play in the majors and each is out of baseball. They are: pitcher Sid
Akins, the Rangers' third-round draft choice from USC; catcher Bob Caffrey, the
Montreal Expos' first-round pick from Cal State Fullerton; and second baseman
Flavio Alfaro, the Atlanta Braves' fourth-round selection from San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
* Wallach Wallop: Expo third baseman Tim Wallach had 26 hits in 66 at-bats in
his last 17 games through Thursday, including eight home runs, six doubles and
23 runs batted in. "I had a streak in '87 when it seemed like I had a run
batted in every at-bat, but I've never had a home run stroke like this," said
Wallach, who has been particularly damaging to the San Diego Padres, going nine
for 14 with three home runs and 13 RBIs in their last three meetings.
</P>
<P>
* Stat Wars: The comparison between baseball's two best outfields doesn't start
and stop with their statistics, but in that regard it's a virtual standoff. The
Pittsburgh Pirates' outfield of Bobby Bonilla, Barry Bonds and Andy Van Slyke
was batting a cumulative .307 through Thursday with 23 home runs and 86 RBIs.
The Oakland A's outfield of Jose Canseco and the Hendersons, Rickey and Dave,
was batting .311 with 28 home runs and 78 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
* Mismanaged: Jeff Russell saved 38 games for the Rangers last season, but his
use by Manager Bobby Valentine this year has been open to question. Valentine
has used Russell in three tie games and five games in which Texas was trailing.
The back-breaker was April 30, when Russell, who has seven saves, was allowed
to make 43 pitches and work three innings of a tie game against the Chicago
White Sox. Since then, he has allowed six earned runs and 12 hits in six
innings in eight games. And now Russell is nursing a sore elbow stemming from
bone spurs.
</P>
<P>
* Odds and . . . : A's relief ace Dennis Eckersley continues to exhibit
remarkable control. Eckersley has faced 149 batters since issuing his last
walk, last August. He is 13 for 13 in 1990 save opportunities and has allowed
one run in 19 1/3 innings this year. . . . Of Ken Griffey Jr.'s 26 major league
home runs, 21 have tied games or put the Seattle Mariners ahead. . . . The
Houston Astros, with their touted pitching and defense, were the only major
league team without a complete game until Mike Scott pitched one Saturday. The
Astros lead the NL in unearned runs allowed. Houston's starting pitchers have
an 8-18 record, failing to get through the sixth inning in 26 of 43 games. . .
. The recall of Shawn Boskie, 23, gave the Chicago Cubs six pitchers 25 or
younger. The others: Mike Harkey, Greg Maddux, Mitch Williams, Jeff Pico and
Steve Wilson. . . . The Braves went into Friday's game against the Phillies at
Philadelphia with a May record of 11-10 and a shot at their first winning month
since May 1987.
</P>
<P>
* . . . Ends: Jeff Torborg, in his second year as manager of the Chicago White
Sox, continues to do it with mirrors. Three of the regular White Sox infielders
-- Carlos Martinez, Scott Fletcher and Robin Ventura -- were hitting .195,
.192, and .138, respectively, through Thursday. . . . The disintegration of the
Toronto Blue Jays' rotation continues. Mike Flanagan has been released, John
Cerutti sent to the bullpen with a 1-5 record and Jimmy Key is sidelined by a
pulled hamstring and strained earned-run average of 5.80. The decision to move
230-pound David Wells into a starting role prompted George Bell to cite the
once-every-five-days' work schedule and say: "He'll weigh 300 pounds by the end
of the year." . . . Add Wells: When he was at triple-A Syracuse, the Blue Jays
fined the team trainer for failing to carry a scale on the road so that he
could be weighed regularly. . . . Marty Barrett, displaced when Jody Reed was
moved to second base, has asked the Boston Red Sox to trade him. Barrett
displayed his frustration the other day by engaging coach Richie Hebner in a
shouting match, prompting Hebner to say he was not Barrett's baby-sitter. . . .
In his first 101 games with the Rangers, Harold Baines drove in 31 runs and hit
.191 with runners in scoring position. "It's one of the great mysteries of our
game," a disappointed Valentine said. ROSS NEWHAN

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- On Sports: Another Remarkable Season </HL>
<AUTHOR> Frederick C. Klein </AUTHOR>

<TEXT>
   What kind of a baseball season was it?
A remarkable one, of course.
They all are.

   It was the year of the balk: 924 of them were called in the Major Leagues, an all-time and, one hopes, evermore record.
But the pitchers didn't squawk too much, because it also was the year they let the air out of the baseball: The 3,180 home runs hit in both leagues was down 29% from 1987.

   For the third consecutive season, no divisional winner repeated; only the Kansas City Royals (1984-85) have managed the trick since the strike-split 1981 campaign.
The Baltimore Orioles opened their season with 21 straight losses; the California Angels closed theirs by losing 12 in a row.

   Jose Canseco, the Oakland A's strong boy, became the first big leaguer to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in a season, and was promptly compared with Ben Johnson.
A $6 million palimony suit didn't keep Boston's Wade Boggs from leading all hitters with a .366 average.
The Chicago Cubs, always remarkable, led the National League in team batting at .261, but were out-hit by their opponents.

   It was a remarkable season in other ways, too.
Here are some examples.

   Most-Remarkable Performance by a Hitter -- San Diego relief pitcher Dave Leiper singled in a run in the 16th inning of a game at Atlanta on Aug. 8.
It was his first time at bat in a seven-year professional career.

   Most-Remarkable Performance by Two Teams of Hitters -- The Colorado Springs Sky Sox and Phoenix Firebirds hit a Pacific Coast League record 13 home runs in a May 7 game at the Sox' mile-plus-high stadium in 40-mph winds.
Former Major-Leaguer Ed Lynch, making his first start for Phoenix, gave up five homers in four innings in a 33-12 defeat.
He retired from baseball the next day.

   Most-Remarkable Fielding Performance -- In the fourth inning of a July 27 home game against Milwaukee, New York Yankee pitcher Tommy John bobbled a roller by Jeffrey Leonard and threw wild past first base.
As Jim Gantner, on base ahead of Leonard, tried to score, John cut off Dave Winfield's throw from the outfield and heaved the ball into the Brewers' dugout.
Told later that he'd tied the Major League record for pitchers by making three errors on one play, held by J. Bentley Seymour of the 1898 New York Giants, the 45-year-old John quipped, "I think I pitched against him in the Eastern League."

   Most-Remarkable Performance by a Pitcher -- Bud Black of the Cleveland Indians hit three of the four batters he faced in the fourth inning of a July 8 game against the Angels at Anaheim.

   Most-Remarkable Pitching Matchups -- May 14 at Houston: Nipper (Chicago) vs.
Knepper (Astros).
June 19 at Chicago: Filer (Milwaukee) vs.
LaPoint (White Sox).
Aug. 23 at Pittsburgh: Browning (Cincinnati) vs.
Dunne (Pirates).

   Most-Remarkable Expenditure -- The Minnesota Twins spent $23,000 for a machine that removes tobacco-juice stains from its artificial-turf field.

   Most-Remarkable Explanation -- "Some players didn't recognize that different behavior is required on a commercial flight than on a charter," said Jim Ferguson, publicity director for the Cincinnati Reds, after team members grabbed stewardesses and threw food on an April 13 Continental Airlines flight to Houston from San Francisco.

   Most-Remarkable Parking Ticket -- Cincinnati manager Pete Rose was tagged for illegal parking on a street near the Reds' ballpark.
The street was Pete Rose Way.

   Most-Remarkable Injury -- Angels outfielder Chili Davis dislocated a toe when he kicked a chair after popping out in a June 26 home game against Milwaukee.
He'd first whacked a punching bag installed by manager Cookie Rojas to allow players to relieve their frustrations, but said he didn't punch it again "because I almost broke my wrist the first time."

   Most-Remarkable Scheduling Change -- Atlanta Braves management moved an Aug. 25 game against Chicago to 5:45 p.m. from 7:35 so cable station WTBS, also owned by team owner Ted Turner, could show a colorized version of the movie "Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" in prime time.

   Most-Remarkable Performance by an Umpire -- Brian Owen, working a Texas League game at El Paso between the home Diablos and the Jackson Mets, thumbed out Diablos' park announcer Paul Strelzin for playing the song "When Will I Be Loved?" on the P.A. system after a disputed call.
The tune begins "I've been cheated . . . been mistreated . . ."

   Most-Remarkable Editing Catch -- Macmillan Publishing Co. deleted the name of Lou Proctor from its latest edition of The Baseball Encyclopedia.
Since 1912, baseball records have included a one-game appearance by Proctor for the St. Louis Browns against the Cleveland Indians that showed him to have walked in his only plate appearance.
Proctor's name was yanked after Macmillan found he was a Western Union telegrapher who'd inserted it in a box score as a prank.

   Most-Remarkable Performance by the Fans -- Milwaukee's Paul Molitor was elected to play second base on the American League all-star team even though he hadn't played the position all season.

   Most-Remarkable Promotion -- The Pittsburgh Pirates, hyping a three-game home series against the Mets in June, ran radio ads calling the Mets "one more thing to hate about New York."

   Most-Remarkable Performance by a Team Executive -- Chub Feeney, president of the San Diego Padres, resigned a day after making an obscene gesture at fans who taunted him during a Sept. 24 game against Houston.
The game had been designated "Fan Appreciation Night."

   Most-Remarkable Quotes -- St. Louis Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog on player-salary arbitration: "The great part is when it's over and the arbitrator asks you what a 'save' is."

   Ex-Yankee slugger Mickey Mantle on Canseco's "40-40" record: "If I'd have known it was going to be a big deal, I'd have done it myself."

   Between servings of roast beef and a cherry-topped chocolate sundae, James "Cool Papa" Bell begins, ever so slightly, to lose his cool.

   So rare for him is this moment of anger that his daughter cries out, "Uh huh, Papa, tell it like it is."
And several at this reunion of Negro Leagues players gather around the fastest man ever to circle the bases.
He inserts his dentures before he speaks.

   "They say we was born too soon, but it wasn't that," the 85-year-old says, bent slightly forward and peering through thick lenses.
"They opened the doors too late."

   In fact, by the time Jackie Robinson broke through baseball's color line in 1947, Cool Papa Bell's legs had given out.
He never played in the Major Leagues.

   At least not in the white Major Leagues.
For three decades, until he retired in 1946, Cool Papa patrolled the outfields of black baseball for the St. Louis Stars, Detroit Wolves, Chicago American Giants and Pittsburgh's Homestead Grays.
He hit like a hammer and ran like a cat.
Satchel Paige, the extraordinary pitcher for the Kansas City Monarchs, once said of Cool Papa's fleetness: He "hit a line drive right past my ear.
I turned around and saw the ball hit his ass sliding into second."

   Last weekend, Cool Papa was honored for his achievements.
He and a handful of other players from the Negro Leagues came here to Three Rivers Stadium, where they were praised on the field and, later, in a banquet room high above it.
Most of the men were part of the 1948 Grays -- the last Negro Leagues World Series champions.
For the record, they took that final series four games to one from the Birmingham Black Barons, which featured a 17-year-old slugger named Willie Mays.

   The Pittsburgh Pirates gave them bronze medallions and a hearty dinner.
Eloquent speakers told of their greatness.
As far as anyone could remember, this was only the second time that a big league team had officially remembered the Negro Leagues.

   Yet the Pirates are the first to concede that a meal can't make up for an eon of injustice.
Behind all of the happiness that the banquet brought, it generated considerable sadness, too.
"It's almost as if the records before 1947 shouldn't exist," says Clarence Bruce, the Grays' second baseman.

   Actually, few Negro Leaguers say they're bitter, or even disappointed.
Most of them are humble and gracious and realize, in the words of the Grays' nonpareil first baseman, Walter "Buck" Leonard, "they just weren't ready for us to integrate with white boys."

   In many respects, their lives were as good as they could be for black Americans of their day.
"They didn't think about going to the Major Leagues," says Phil Dixon, a Negro Leagues historian, "because they couldn't even get in the bathroom in most places."

   They've always been proud of the extraordinary things they could do on the field.
Every year from 1937 through 1945, the Grays won the pennant.
In exhibition games, they regularly defeated white teams.
Several Grays, including Cool Papa, have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.

   To their communities, especially to a cold steel town such as Pittsburgh, these men "brought pride with their stunning abilities," says local historian Rob Ruck.
They traveled to Latin America -- where they were permitted to play on the same teams as white men -- and barnstormed across the U.S. Sometimes, they'd play three games in a day.
No matter where they went, they carried themselves with dignity.

   Some were lucky and, like Willie Mays, eventually found their way to the Majors.
Indeed, nine of the 11 men voted the National League's most valuable player between 1949 and 1959 were former Negro Leaguers, including Roy Campanella, Hank Aaron and Ernie Banks.

   The ones who didn't make it could only look back and do their best to understand the prejudice.
Catcher Josh Gibson, maybe the most talented Gray of all, died at age 36, only months before Robinson broke in with the Dodgers.
"We put up with a lot because we enjoyed playing ball," says Bob Thurman, who batted .345 for the Grays in 1948.
"That's the bottom line."

   Still, for some, the bottom line is the bottom line.
And though no baseball player in the '30s or '40s made anything close to today's towering salaries, the players of the Negro Leagues, not surprisingly, were forced to work hardest for the least compensation.

   Because the Negro Leagues never developed a pension system, as the Major Leagues did shortly after World War II, many of its surviving players have been forced over the decades to live in poverty.
And while the Major Leagues have earmarked proceeds from annual benefit games to older players who missed out, Negro Leaguers have no such program.

   "They're the whipped and forgotten men of baseball," contends Connie Brooks, Cool Papa's daughter.
"They all say it's all right, that it can't be undone.
But it's not all right.
Society has reduced them to nothing."

   Today, though, at least somebody remembers.
Out near home plate, Pirates president Carl Barger asks the crowd "to reflect upon the splendid contributions that the Negro Leagues made . . . to baseball history."
Men, once so lithe, hobble forward.
Buck Leonard uses a cane.
Cool Papa needs someone to support him.
The Grays, almost without exception, turned gray long ago.

   "We cannot make up the opportunities that were missed," Mr. Barger says.

   Vendors, oblivious, move through the bleachers and sell Iron City beer.
On the Astroturf, the Pirates and the Philadelphia Phillies stretch.
Players -- some black, some white -- toss the ball and sprint side by side in the green of the outfield.

   Overhead, the championship flag of the 1948 Homestead Grays snaps in the breeze, right under Old Glory.

   Last winter, baseball teams spent more than ever for
players. This summer, baseball fans can spend more than ever
to watch them.
   The average cost of a big-league ticket is 9% higher this
season, which opens today, and a family of four will drop an
average of $76 on a visit to the ballpark, according to a
survey by Team Marketing Report, a sports-business newsletter
in Chicago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That may be not only dismaying for fans, but also
disquieting for baseball, which has long tried to position
itself as the affordable sport. But, says Alan Friedman, the
newsletter's publisher, "somebody has to pay" for the
increases in salaries and other operating expenses.
   Baseball's lush broadcast deals with CBS and ESPN actually
do more to underwrite salaries than ticket sales. But gate
receipts remain an important revenue source which, unlike the
long-term TV contracts, can be increased from year to year as
costs rise.
   Team Marketing Report developed a fan cost index, or FCI,
measuring total ball-game outlays for a family of four. The
index includes tickets, beer and soft drinks, hot dogs,
parking, programs and souvenir caps. It has risen 72% since
1980, outstripping the 58% rise in the consumer price index.
This year's FCI is 6.3% higher than 1990's.
   Several teams have FCIs closing in on $100, including the
Toronto Blue Jays (US$93.29), the New York Mets ($87.40) and
the Boston Red Sox ($86.02). Toronto's 1990 FCI of $88.97
didn't keep the Blue Jays from setting a major-league
attendance record of 3.9 million, but baseball executives
admit price resistance is becoming an issue. "We're probably
flirting with that area right now," says Jim Ross, marketing
vice president of the Mets, whose advance sales have eased
from a year ago.
   Baseball executives say it isn't fair to hold most teams
accountable for all items in the index. Prices for such
things as food and parking are often set by stadium
authorities, concessionaires or other contractors. "Teams can
exercise strong input {on prices}, but they can't control
them," says Ernie Mullin, former senior vice president of
business with the Pittsburgh Pirates.
   Still, higher ticket prices account for most of the
increase in the 1991 FCI. Among the teams leading the leagues
in average ticket increases this year: the Detroit Tigers, up
15%; the San Francisco Giants, up 16%; the San Diego Padres,
up 18%, the California Angels, up 19%; and the Texas Rangers,
up 22%.
   "It's absolutely a reflection of the cost dynamics," says
John McMichael, the Rangers' vice president, business
operations. "Our last price increase was prior to 1988, and
our salaries have tripled since then." But there's been no
rebellion, Mr. McMichael says; in fact, season-ticket sales
are rising from last year. "The fans understand what's going
on," he says.
   The Chicago White Sox, cited by Team Marketing as having
the biggest rise, at 31%, dispute the finding. Rob Gallas,
the team's senior vice president of marketing, says Team
Marketing was wrong to include new $16 club seats, which the
White Sox didn't have last year and which aren't aimed at the
family market. Box seats rose $1.50, to $13, and reserved
seats rose $1, to $6, but Mr. Gallas says, "Let's keep this
in perspective. I went to the movies the other night, and it
cost me $6.50. Popcorn there runs $3 to $5. We've worked hard
to keep our prices in line."
   A half-dozen teams have held the line on ticket increases,
and Mr. Friedman predicts a number of others will step up
youth-oriented promotions to keep families coming in. And, he
notes, even some of the most costly teams offer bargains. The
Chicago Cubs, with an FCI of $83, offer upperdeck seats to
children for $4 (a 33% discount) at all games. The Mets admit
senior citizens for $1 at four games a year.
   Some teams are relative bargains all the time. The St.
Louis Cardinals finish in the cellar of the Fan Cost Index,
at $64.52, partly because the team, owned by Anheuser-Busch
Cos., has the cheapest beer, at $1.90 a cup. The Cleveland
Indians have the cheapest tickets, an average of $6.75.
   Even some teams whose payrolls have surged have kept fans'
costs in check. The Los Angeles Dodgers' payroll has jumped
65% since last season to $33 million, but the team raised
ticket prices only for box seats. "The competition for the
entertainment dollar is fairly fierce," says Barry
Stockhamer, the Dodgers' marketing vice president. "We think
our value has stood out, and we want it to continue to."
   The Dodgers will instead try to generate more revenue by
vastly expanding food facilities and menu choices (this
franchise does control concessions), opening a new stadium
store and, oh yes, winning. A contending team, it's hoped,
would get fan volume back up to the 3.5 million level of the
early-'80s salad days.
   There's nothing like performance to make pricing
considerations moot, agrees Texas's Mr. McMichael: "It's a
bargain if we win; it's overpriced if we lose."

<LEADPARA>  Former A's pitcher Mike Norris was arrested on suspicion of public
intoxication after a run-in with U.S. Customs authorities on Friday night but
was later released from custody without being cited.;    A spokesman for the
San Mateo County Jail said Saturday that Norris was held until deputies
decided he was sober and then released.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Notebook  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Norris, 36, was arrested about 8:45 p.m. by San Francisco Airport police. A
police spokesman said Norris had caused a commotion by refusing to fill out
declaration forms demanded by customs officials.;    Norris returned to major
league baseball last year after seven seasons. But he was sent to Triple-A
Tacoma at midseason and suffered a rib injury in August. Earlier this month
Norris had said he was hoping to sign a contract with the Class A Reno Silver
Sox.;    Norris, who won 22 games with the A's in 1986, has had a history of
drug problems that twice forced his suspension from baseball.;  ANGELS: Dave
Parker ended a 3-for-22 slump with a two-run homer and Kirk McCaskill pitched
six shutout innings as California broke Cleveland's seven-game winning streak,
beating the Indians 10-0 in Palm Springs.;  BREWERS: Pitcher Ted Higuera, who
has chosen rehabilitation over surgery for a torn rotator cuff, was put on the
15-day disabled list. The Brewers chose to put Higuera on the 15-day disabled
list retroactive to Friday rather than the 60-day disabled list because they
believe he will be able to pitch by midseason.;  CUBS: Chicago reportedly is
close to a deal that would send reliever Mitch Williams to Philadelphia. The
Phillies would send pitchers Chuck McElroy and Bob Scanlan to the Cubs for
Williams and a minor leaguer. Williams apparently wants to be moved because of
his demotion from No. 1 stopper to No. 3 behind Dave Smith and Paul
Assenmacher.;  EXPOS: Former Giant Mike Aldrete, an infielder-outfielder, was
waived.;  PADRES: Pitcher Calvin Schiraldi was placed on waivers for the
purpose of giving him his unconditional release. Schiraldi was scheduled to be
paid $740,000 this year. Instead, he will get about $185,000 from the Padres.;
 PHILLIES: After allowing 11 hits and five runs in seven innings in a 10-1
loss to St. Louis, Terry Mulholland was named Philadelphia's opening-day
starter.;  PIRATES: Pittsburgh won't rush into trading All-Star outfielder
Bobby Bonilla and may keep him all season rather than deal for lesser-quality
talent, General Manager Larry Doughty said.;    A day after team President
Carl Barger said contract negotiations with Bonilla were at an impasse and a
trade was possible, Doughty said it would be a mistake for a pennant contender
such as the Pirates to deal in haste.;    "We're not going to give Bobby
Bonilla away," Doughty said.;    Bonilla rejected the Pirates' four-year, $16
million contract offer last week and asked for a five-year deal at "market
value.";    The Pirates waived pitcher Jay Tibbs for the purpose of giving him
his unconditional release.;  TIGERS: Andy Allanson, a catcher who spent last
year in the minor leagues, was acquired by Detroit in a trade with Kansas City
and placed on the Tigers' major league roster. The Royals received minor
league catcher Jim Baxter, who played only 13 games last year at the Double-A
level before a shoulder injury cut short his season.;  ETC.: Two American
League general managers said Pete Incaviglia may be claimed on waivers.
Atlanta, San Diego and the New York Yankees were mentioned as the leading
candidates. The Texas Rangers tried to trade Incaviglia to those teams before
releasing him Friday. If Incaviglia clears waivers, he will become a free
agent, and Houston and Seattle officials indicated their clubs would talk with
him then. Seattle is tempted to claim Incaviglia, a league official said, but
cannot handle his full salary. The Mariners tried to trade for Incaviglia in
the off-season.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  In 1985, the Pittsburgh Pirates had the worst record in baseball and the
club's worst record in 30 years. But the next season began with hope. The
Pirates had a new general manager, Syd Thrift, a new manager, Jim Leyland, and
a new philosophy.;    "It's my belief that if you really want to build this
ballclub into a championship club, it has to come from your scouting and
player development," said Thrift.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  BASEBALL '91  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The club employed 55 first-year professionals in 1986 -- standouts from
major colleges, junior colleges and high schools.;    In 1990, the Pirates won
the National League East. How many from the class of 1986 were on the
championship roster? Two, a part-time infielder, Jeff King, and a relief
pitcher, Stan Belinda. Three others -- Scott Ruskin, Rick Reed and Moises Alou
-- made contributions.;    By industry standards, the Pirates' class of 1986
was a success. The National Association of Pro Baseball Leagues estimates 8
percent of prospects signed "will make it to the major leagues at one time or
another," said Larry Wiederecht.;    Chet Montgomery, first-year minor-league
director for the Pirates, said "If 5 percent of the players you sign make it,
you've done a good job.";    Nine percent of the Pirates' class of 1986 made
it. The Pirates spent millions to develop a handful of players and their
effort was considered successful.;    Baseball's player development system is
beginning to draw scrutiny. Player salaries and related costs are soaring. Can
clubs afford to spend millions on a development system populated mostly by
players who never will play major-league baseball? Can clubs continue to fund
six to eight farm teams when the payoff is two or three big-league players a
year?;    The Pirates spent $6.8 million in 1990 to develop 216 players.
That's an average investment of $31,481 per player. If 8 percent (17 players)
eventually make it to the major leagues, the Pirates will have spent $6.2
million on 199 players who won't help them except in trades.;    As the 1991
season begins, few teams have made cuts in development programs. No clubs have
eliminated farm teams. The Expos added a Class A team.;    "Putting money into
player development is the right way to go,' said Bob Quinn, general manager of
the Cincinnati Reds. "Look at the nucleus of our championship club. Joe
Oliver, our catcher, came up through our system. Pitchers Tom Browning, Jack
Armstrong, Rob Dibble and Scott Scudder came from our system. In our infield,
(Chris) Sabo and (Barry) Larkin came up from our system. So did outfielders
Eric Davis and Paul O'Neill.  </TEXT>

Padres, making him the third-highest-paid player in baseball.;    Gwynn,
seventh on the Padres' payroll last season, will have an average salary of
$4,083,333 under the extension, which begins in 1993. He is the 40th player

 ORIOLES SIGN PALMER: Hall of Fame pitcher Jim Palmer has accepted a
conditional contract from the Baltimore Orioles and could be in uniform as
early as Saturday, the team announced.;    Terms of the contract weren't
disclosed, but it is contingent upon Palmer's making the team.;    "It's a
performance contract that is fair," Palmer said. "I don't want to be paid for
anything I don't do. I've never operated like that.";    Palmer, who won 268
games in 19 seasons with the Orioles, sounded like a man on a mission.;
"It's just something that happened, and I'd like to see if I can do it," he
said. "I know that no Hall of Fame pitcher has ever tried a comeback, but

hasn't decided whether to reopen negotiations on a long-term contract with the
Pittsburgh Pirates, Bonilla's agent said.;    "That's Bobby's decision,"
Dennis Gilbert said.;    The sides haven't talked since last week, when
Bonilla turned down a four-year, $15.5 million offer and a one-year $3.1
million offer before losing his arbitration case. Bonilla filed for $3,475,000
but will make $2.4 million.;    Bonilla had said he wouldn't negotiate if the
Pirates took him to arbitration, but Pirates President Carl Barger said,
"Anybody will talk if the dollars are right.";  ETC: Spring training opened
under sunny skies in Florida and Arizona. Officially, only pitchers and
catchers were supposed to show up Thursday, and then just to check in. But
rather than merely report, the march of the millionaires began when a lot of
players, batteries included, broke out the bats and balls. . . . Joe Garagiola

MORNING BRIEFING: BASEBALL'S RICHEST: $19-MILLION LINEUP
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most expensive lineup in baseball this season costs $19,494,874 and does
not even include Jose Canseco, Kirby Puckett or Wade Boggs.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press' all-money team does, however, list two Dodgers -- Orel
Hershiser and Eddie Murray. Hershiser's 1989 salary, including a prorated share
of his signing bonus, is $2,766,667, the highest in baseball.
</P>
<P>
In the AP lineup, Hershiser would throw to Gary Carter of the New York Mets,
who earns $2,160,714. The infield would have Murray at first base, $2,244,462;
Juan Samuel of the Philadelphia Phillies at second, $1.45 million; Cal Ripken
of the Baltimore Orioles at shortstop, $2,466,667, and George Brett of the
Kansas City Royals at third, $1,803,979.
</P>
<P>
Samuel played second base last season, but Philadelphia is planning on moving
him to the outfield this year. If he weren't counted, Steve Sax of the New York
Yankees would take over at second at $1,266,667. The most expensive outfield in
baseball would have Jim Rice of the Boston Red Sox, $2,325,385; Andy Van Slyke
of the Pittsburgh Pirates, $2.15 million, and Andre Dawson of the Chicago Cubs,
$2.1 million.
</P>
<P>
The lineup has average batting statistics of .275 with 20 home runs and 79 runs
batted in, not including the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
The payroll of the all-money team increased 5.6% from last year's $18,469,222,
and the players earn an average of $2.17 million.
</P>
<P>
Trivia: Which school holds the longest active streak in the nation for most
consecutive postseason basketball tournament appearances?
</P>
<P>
Greener greens: There is an increasingly acceptable living to be made by
hitting a little white ball around a field. No fewer than 172 golfers earned
$100,000 or more last year by playing the game.
</P>
<P>
The figure includes 112 players on the PGA Tour, 32 on the PGA Seniors Tour and
28 on the LPGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
The way he walks that walk: Willie Wilson of the Kansas City Royals walked only
22 times last season and has never walked more than 39 times in a season.
</P>
<P>
It comes as something of a surprise this spring, therefore, to hear Wilson say,
"I know I need to walk a little more and to improve my on-base percentage (.289
last year, lowest among all leadoff hitters in the American League). Last year,
I was swinging at a lot of balls in the dirt, balls over my head, everything.
That's going to stop. We want to win, and if takes my willingness to walk, I'll
do that."
</P>
<P>
All this from a man who once was quoted as saying, "If I wanted to walk, I
would have become a mailman."
</P>
<P>
That's Cincinnati, Bavaria: Not long ago, Marge Schott, owner of the Cincinnati
Reds, was asked a question:
</P>
<P>
After four consecutive second-place finishes, how long will she wait for the
Reds to win the National League West?
</P>
<P>
"Well, I'm German," she replied, "so I'm not too patient."
</P>
<P>
Not too accurate, either. The Reds' media guide says that Schott is "a native
and sixth-generation resident of Cincinnati."
</P>
<P>
Shuffling along in Buffalo: It's distinctly possible that the Pittsburgh
Pirates' lineup on opening day will be an average of three years younger than
their triple-A Buffalo club.
</P>
<P>
The Bisons could have three starting pitchers over 30, and their lineup will
include such veterans as Rennie Stennett, 38; Steve Henderson, 36; Tito
Landrum, 34, and Reggie Williams, 28.
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: St. John's, whose appearance in the National Invitation
Tournament is its 25th straight in postseason play.
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Butler University basketball Coach Joe Sexson, after reading that he
was going to be replaced: "I just saw this in the paper. It appears that I am
going to resign this weekend."

PIRATES ARE OLDER, WISER -- AND BETTER
</P>
</HEADLINE>

PITTSBURGH
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maturity is taking on some incredibly contorted dimensions in the Pittsburgh
Pirates' clubhouse. On one wall is a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle collage, in
deference to Mike LaValliere, the resident ninja-like catcher. Seated at his
locker, wearing a demonic grin, is Wally Backman, whose remarkable dexterity
with one of baseball's most revered pranks -- the hotfoot -- is evoking awe
from the most seasoned pranksters.
</P>
<P>
Analgesic hot balm is being applied to underwear for the purpose of searing
unsuspecting flesh. Raw eggs are being broken over the heads of grown men.
Young players are being forced to walk through airports wearing platform shoes.
</P>
<P>
It's all part of a maturation process, the Pirates say. Rest assured it's a
level of dementia understood only by baseball players.
</P>
<P>
"We've become a very mature team," outfielder R.J. Reynolds said. "We're mature
in a baseball sense. We're loose, even when we lose. Guys are on each other
constantly, which is good. Nobody on the team is immune."
</P>
<P>
Recent developments have made it imperative for the Pirates to retain a sense
of humor. A startlingly torrid start has been followed by a stretch that is
threatening to become equally horrid.
</P>
<P>
They started 22-9, and their selfless, hero-du-jour style began drawing
comparisons with the 1960 Pirates, a team that stunned baseball by excelling at
such unappreciated endeavors as moving runners along and throwing strikes.
</P>
<P>
The result was a 31-day stay in first place in the National League East. They
fell to second after Friday's 9-8 loss to the Giants but regained first
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's just late May, and that's it," manager Jim Leyland said. "We
aren't even concerned with where we are in the standings."
</P>
<P>
But if the clutch hits continue their sabbatical -- and if Walt Terrell (1-4,
5.18 earned run average) keeps getting pummeled -- some concern may be
inevitable. Maybe the "Ninja Shrine" might have its rabbit's-foot license
revoked.
</P>
<P>
"No way. That's brought us a lot of good luck," Reynolds said. "We bring the
posters on the road with us. They go everywhere we go. They're always there for
us."
</P>
<P>
 -- Center fielder Andy Van Slyke started the craze, which has escalated to the
point that the Pittsburgh Press published an editorial cartoon depicting a
turtle wearing a Pirates cap with the caption: "They're young, they're strong
and they can't be stopped. They're Teenage Mutant Ninja Pirates."
</P>
<P>
LaValliere is a 5-foot-10, 205-pound catcher whose build -- graciously called
"sturdy" by Van Slyke -- earned him a comparison with the gluttonous crime
fighters.
</P>
<P>
It is somewhat appropriate for the Pirates to ally themselves with
pizza-eating, sewer-dwelling superheroes. The Bucs (almost universally called
"Buccos" in these parts) are a curious mix of castoffs, retreads and young
stars who have come together under unusual circumstances to perform beyond
expectations.
</P>
<P>
Of several off-season deals, the free-agent signing of Backman has proved to be
the most significant. After spending last year with the Minnesota Twins, the
former New York Met has moved in at third base against right-handed pitchers.
The move has allowed Bobby Bonilla to take his dangerous bat (.306, 12 homers,
38 RBI) and shaky glove (35 errors in 1989) to right field.
</P>
<P>
Backman, who platoons with Jeff King, is leading off and hitting .340. His
tenacious nature, complete with flying helmets and expletives, has added a dash
of plutonium to the team chemistry.
</P>
<P>
General manager Larry Doughty, criticized in Pittsburgh last year after taking
over for Syd Thrift, used the skills he gained from a career in scouting to
bring depth to the Pirates. He traded with the Yankees for catcher Don Slaught,
who has hit .362 while playing against left-handers. He signed free-agent Ted
Power, who has three saves in a set-up role for stopper Bill Landrum.
</P>
<P>
In March 1989, Doughty traded pitcher Brett Gideon to Montreal for Neal Heaton,
who had a 61-83 record coming into this season. During the lockout, Heaton
added something called a screw-knuckle-change to his
fastball-fastball-fastball. He is now 7-1 with a 2.84 ERA.
</P>
<P>
Backman has garnered the most attention, mostly for his, uh, fiery approach to
the game.
</P>
<P>
Reynolds' eyes widen and his head shakes as he describes Backman's pyromaniacal
talents. If Reynolds were on the Nobel Committee, you get the feeling Backman
would get at least one vote.
</P>
<P>
"He makes the best hotfoots I've ever seen," Reynolds said. "He's amazing. He
takes a whole book of matches, ties them together and lights them with a
cigarette. That gives it a slow burn that just sits there for a few seconds
before BOOM!. It's almost like an M-80. That's how good they are."
</P>
<P>
Presiding over the antics is Leyland, who doesn't come across as the type of
guy who looks upon the game of baseball as one big belly laugh.
</P>
<P>
He has been known to pore over a lineup card for up to three hours before a
game. He chain smokes in the dugout, fretting over strategy decisions. More
than once he has rearranged his office furniture after a loss. "He's an
emotional, intense guy," Van Slyke said. "That's OK, because this is an
emotional game. He's a great guy to play for, because you always know where you
stand."
</P>
<P>
Leyland's demeanor is stern and humorless, in much the same manner as A's
manager Tony La Russa. The comparison is not random; Leyland coached under La
Russa with the Chicago White Sox for four years.
</P>
<P>
"Tony without question made me a big-league manager," Leyland said. "He didn't
make me a manager, but he made me a big-league manager.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be compared with Tony La Russa, though. That's an injustice to
Tony. He's won a world championship. I've won in Evansville and Lakeland."
</P>
<P>
Pirates pitching coach Ray Miller is not conservative with his comparisons. The
Baltimore Orioles' pitching coach from 1978-85, Miller says Leyland is on a par
with Earl Weaver.
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy will rip your rear end, then be the first one to say hello the next
day," Miller said. "He's one of the fairest men in the game, just like Earl. I
think he handles a team as well as Earl. He prepares as well as Earl, and I
didn't think anybody could do that."
</P>
<P>
Preparation has been made easier this year. The Pirates were a traveling
infirmary last year, when they finished 74-88. This year the only injury of
note was suffered by pitcher John Smiley, who broke his pitching hand 10 days
ago by slamming it in a car door.
</P>
<P>
"It was like we had three wheels last year," Reynolds said. "We used to run out
of plays, run out of moves. Now that doesn't happen. Now we're the guys with
the versatility, and Jim knows how to use it. That's what you need for the long
haul, and we ARE in this for the long haul."

<TEXT>     His record string of homers began in Pittsburgh on May 19, 1956, off Jim
Davis of the Cubs. It ended May 28 with his eighth homer, off Carl Erskine of
the Brooklyn Dodgers. The record was tied by Don Mattingly of the Yankees in
1987.;    Long, as a member of the Pirates, was the National League's starting
first baseman in the 1956 All-Star Game.;  BASEBALL: Boston Red Sox pitcher
Roger Clemens appeared before American League President Bobby Brown in New
York in an effort to overturn his five-game suspension at the start of the
season. Clemens, given the suspension plus a $10,000 fine for allegedly making
derogatory comments to umpire Terry Cooney in Game 4 of the A.L. playoffs
against the A's, argued his case along with his agent and two representatives
of the Major League Players Association. Cooney and umpires' representatives
also attended the meeting, which lasted 5 1/2 hours. It was not clear when a
ruling would be issued. . . . The publishers of USA Today said they plan to
launch a weekly tabloid in April devoted exclusively to baseball. The weekly,
which will be called USA Today Baseball Weekly, will begin publication April 5
and have a cover price of $1. It also will be available by subscription for
about $35 a year.;  COLLEGE FOOTBALL: Fullerton State's football program,
which reportedly has been on the verge of being yanked from the university's
athletic budget, may get a reprieve. "I hear the program could be saved," said
a Titans assistant coach, who requested anonymity. "Something is supposed to
come down (today) that will save the team. If they are going to dismiss the
program, then it should happen quickly so these kids can catch on at other
schools." Because of financial problems, Fullerton State offered two of its
home games last season to the visitors in exchange for the $35,000 guaranteed
to visiting Big West teams. San Jose State, originally scheduled to play at
Fullerton State, snatched the opportunity for the extra home date. . . . A
21-year-old Maryland man who was in serious condition after a fall from a
third-floor window of a burning apartment building in Morgantown, W.Va., could
have been killed if West Virginia offensive lineman Ron Bunofsky wouldn't have
broken his fall, fire officials said. Bunofsky, who is 6-foot-4 and 255
pounds, said he was playing cards with his roommates across the street when
fire broke out at the residence of Ernest L. Wallace. "I was able to catch him
under the chest, and he landed on all fours," Bunofsky said.;  MISCELLANY:
Martina Navratilova played her first competitive tennis match in two months,
beating Gabriela Sabatini 6-3, 6-4 in an exhibition in Hong Kong. "It was much
better than I expected," said Navratilova, 34, who had knee surgery late last
year. "I thought I was feeling old, but my knees are good and now I feel 10
years younger.";  . . . The U.S. Soccer Federation and Adidas have agreed to a
new $21 million, four-year sponsorship contract that calls for increased
advertising and support by the shoe company.  </TEXT>

<P>
The most expensive lineup in baseball this season costs $19,388,895 and doesn't
even include Jose Canseco and Kirby Puckett.
</P>
<P>
The best lineup in baseball, using the 1988 Associated Press major league
All-Star team, goes for about $7.5 million less.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Orel Hershiser of the Dodgers is one of only two AP All-Stars to make
the All-Money team. His 1989 salary, including a prorated share of his signing
bonus, is $2,766,667, the highest in baseball this season.
</P>
<P>
On the All-Money team, Hershiser would throw to Gary Carter of the New York
Mets ($2,160,714). The infield would feature Eddie Murray of the Dodgers at
first base ($2,244,462), Juan Samuel of the Philadelphia Phillies at second
base ($1.45 million), Cal Ripken of the Baltimore Orioles at shortstop
($2,466,667) and Wade Boggs of the Boston Red Sox at third base ($1.725
million), the only other All-Star on the team other than Hershiser.
</P>
<P>
Samuel played second base last season but Philadelphia is planning to on move
him to the outfield this year. If he weren't counted, Steve Sax of the New York
Yankees would take over at $1,266,667.
</P>
<P>
The most expensive outfield in baseball would have Jim Rice of the Boston Red
Sox ($2,325,385) in left field, Andy Van Slyke of the Pittsburgh Pirates ($2.15
million) in center field and Andre Dawson of the Chicago Cubs ($2.1 million) in
right field.
</P>
<P>
Salaries were obtained by the AP from several player and management sources.
For Murray and Rice, income deferred without interest is discounted to reflect
present-day value.
</P>
<P>
The most expensive lineup has an composite batting average of .283 with 18 home
runs and 73 runs batted in, not including Hershiser, the pitcher. For
$7,747,728 less, the AP All-Stars average .309 with 19 homers and 89 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
Catching Hershiser on the AP All-Stars would be Benito Santiago of the San
Diego Padres, who at $310,000 once again is the least-highly paid player on the
AP All-Stars. He's also only one of two AP All-Stars not yet eligible for
salary arbitration. Boston outfielder Mike Greenwell is the other.
</P>
<P>
At first base is Will Clark of the San Francisco Giants ($1.125 million), at
second base is Ryne Sandberg of the Chicago Cubs ($890,000), at shortstop is
Alan Trammell of the Detroit Tigers ($1 million) and at third base is Boston's
Boggs.
</P>
<P>
In the outfield are Puckett of the Minnesota Twins ($2 million) in center
field, Canseco of the Oakland Athletics ($1.6 million) in right field and
Greenwell of the Red Sox ($500,000) in left field.
</P>
<P>
The AP All-Star team is actually less expensive than it was last year, when the
payroll of the 1987 All-Stars was $12,101,823. This year the AP All-Stars'
payroll is $11,916,667, a 1.5% decrease and an average of $1.32 million per
player.
</P>
<P>
The payroll of the All-Money team increased 5.0% from last season's $18,469,222
and the players earn an average of $2.15 million.

<P>
They stood at the entrance of the hotel in which baseball's owners were
discussing National League expansion Thursday and chanted, "Let's go Buffalo."
</P>
<P>
About 150 Buffalo boosters had arrived by bus to try to influence the selection
of two new cities in September of 1991.
</P>
<P>
They might not have had the desired effect.
</P>
<P>
Said one member of the commissioner's office, "One of the drawbacks of the
Buffalo area is its proximity in driving distance to three major league cities
-- Cleveland, New York and Toronto. This just re-emphasizes that."
</P>
<P>
The game has begun, with geography and demographics just part of the
consideration as the National League expands for the first time since 1969,
ultimately achieving symmetry with the 14-team American League. The expansion
teams will begin play in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The timetable was outlined at the conclusion of a joint meeting of American and
National league owners Thursday by Commissioner Fay Vincent, National League
President Bill White and the chairman of the league's expansion committee,
Douglas Danforth, who is also chairman of the Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
Danforth said there had been no decision on franchise fees and would not
comment on speculation that fees will be $50 million to $100 million per team.
</P>
<P>
"I can only tell you that it will be more than $10 million," he said, alluding
to the amount charged Montreal and San Diego in 1969.
</P>
<P>
There will be a deposit required when interested groups and individuals return
the official questionnaires that will be available in July.
</P>
<P>
Then:
</P>
<P>
 -- The expansion committee will ask prospective owners to make presentations
in New York before Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
 -- The committee will cut to a "short list" of five or six by Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
 -- The prospective cities or areas will be visited during the first quarter of
1991, with the committee making initial recommendations at the June ownership
meeting and a final recommendation at the September meeting, at which a vote
will be taken.
</P>
<P>
 -- The new clubs will be eligible to field minor league teams in 1992 and
participate in the amateur draft of that year, preceding a dispersal draft in
November, when each select 36 players from the 12 National League teams.
</P>
<P>
Danforth said no decision had been reached on the possibility of the American
League's supplying players in the dispersal draft, but that would be at odds
with previous expansions and would force the National League to share the
franchise fees with the American League, an unlikely consideration.
</P>
<P>
He said that the new teams would not receive national TV income in 1993, the
last year of the current contract.
</P>
<P>
Buffalo, of course, is one of only several cities or areas under consideration.
Among the others: Tampa-St. Petersburg, Denver, Orlando, Miami, Washington,
Phoenix and Northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
Danforth and Vincent stressed the need for local ownership and said the
preference was for baseball-only stadiums with grass fields and no domes, but
in any case baseball must be the primary tenant.
</P>
<P>
Danforth added that the expansion teams would be allowed to play in minor
league facilities for a year or two, but only if new stadiums were being
constructed.
</P>
<P>
He said there are no geographical limitations, that the committee could chose
two East Coast cities rather than two from different parts of the country, and
that the possibility of National League realignment has been discussed only in
a general way.
</P>
<P>
That discussion, it was learned, has centered on the possibility of new teams
in Denver and Florida, prompting possible realignment along the following
lines:
</P>
<P>
West: Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Houston, Denver, St. Louis,
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
East: Atlanta, Florida, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Montreal and New
York.
</P>
<P>
Said the general manager of one Eastern Division team: "As much as it makes
sense geographically, I believe the Cubs and Cardinals would resist moving to a
new division because of the loss of established rivalries."
</P>
<P>
The decision to expand now, when many baseball people contend there is not
enough talent to stock two new teams, represents a response to Congressional
pressure regarding the possible loss of baseball's antitrust exemption.
</P>
<P>
"They bring that up every time I go to Washington," Vincent said, adding that
it is Congress' desire to have six new teams by the end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't rule anything out, but we have made no commitment beyond these two.
</P>
<P>
"It's a complicated process, and what I have said to Washington is, 'Let us see
how these two develop first.' "
</P>
<P>
In other business, the joint ownership voted approval for the San Francisco
Giants to move to Santa Clara if that city approves construction of a new
stadium, which is expected to be a ballot issue there this fall.

<TEXT>     Even an all-black team wouldn't hesitate to adopt a nickname such as Grays,
Clowns, X-Giants or Black Yankees.;    It was the time of black baseball in
America -- the Negro leagues and barnstorming teams -- and it lasted from the
1860s, when the Civil War freed the slaves, until the 1960s, when the
civil-rights movement reached its zenith.;    The Negro leagues were the
product of a society not comfortable with itself, and they produced some
extraordinary ballplayers.;    After 1947, when Jackie Robinson became the
first black player in the major leagues, a few of his Negro league
contemporaries also were able to sign on with big league teams. Only a handful
were recognized by the Baseball Hall of Fame.;    It took World War II and the
racial rantings of Adolf Hitler to focus America's attention on its own racial
hypocrisy, according to historian Jules Tygiel of San Francisco State, whose
best-known baseball work is "Baseball's Great Experiment -- Jackie Robinson
and his Legacy.";    Tygiel -- a historian by profession, a baseball historian
by avocation -- has traced evidence of black baseball players to before the
Civil War in an article he wrote for the encyclopedia "Total Baseball," but he
found the first evidence of teams in Northern cities in 1867 when the Brooklyn
Uniques played the Philadelphia Excelsiors in what was billed as the
"championship of colored clubs.";    The same year, the Philadelphia Pythians,
another black club, sent a representative to the organizational meeting of the
National Association of Base Ball Players, which became the first professional
baseball league, according to David Q. Voight's baseball history in "Total
Baseball.";    The Pythians were barred because the association said "if
colored clubs were admitted there would be in all probability some division of
feeling, whereas, by excluding them no injury could result to anyone.";
That didn't mean professional baseball was an entirely segregated game.;
All through baseball history there were games, mainly exhibition contests,
played between all-white and all-black teams. And there were integrated teams
in the International Association, a minor league with teams in the northern
United States and Canada as late as 1898.;    A black catcher, Moses Fleetwood
Walker, and his brother Welday helped organize an integrated team at Oberlin
College in 1881, and Fleet Walker later played two seasons for the University
of Michigan.;    Walker, not Jackie Robinson, was the first black major
leaguer when he joined Toledo of the American Association in 1884, according
to Tygiel.;    But black players were gradually driven out of mainstream
professional baseball through the rejection of teammates, ugly incidents and
finally outright banning.;    That was the situation that prompted the
formation of the first of a series of Negro leagues that, at times, paid wages
that topped those of the major leagues.;    The first truly successful league
was the Negro National League founded in 1919, by Rube Foster, a
player-turned-executive. Foster's league spawned others such as the Eastern
Colored League.;    Teams and leagues tended toward financial instability,
however, and the best players jumped from team to team and league to league
without penalty. The strongest black teams, such as the Kansas City Monarchs
and Homestead Grays (Pittsburgh), existed outside formal leagues at times,
barnstorming across the country playing league teams, white teams and any
other opponents that could draw paying crowds.;    Negro league teams made
important contributions to the sport. The Monarchs, one of the longest-lived
and most successful clubs, had a portable lighting system built in 1929, so
they could play as many as three games a day. They played the first night
professional baseball game in 1930, according to Tygiel.;    Tygiel said
seasons ran 200 or more games, many of them exhibitions that didn't count in
league standings. Teams often played their weekend games in major league
parks, welcomed by teams such as the Yankees looking for rental revenue on
days they were on the road.;    In the 1930s and '40s, Negro league teams
frequently played exhibitions against teams of major league all-stars to
sellout crowds of black and white fans. Tygiel's research of interracial games
in the 1930s indicates Negro league teams won two-thirds of the games.;
Jackie Robinson's acceptance in the major leagues spelled the end of the Negro
leagues, although their death was slow. It wasn't until 1959, 12 years after
Jackie Robinson first played for the Brooklyn Dodgers, that the Boston Red Sox
ended the all-white era of the major leagues. The Red Sox were the last team
to integrate their roster.;    The Negro American League shrank from 10 teams
in 1948 to four by 1953. Barnstorming black teams continued to hang on. Kansas
City's last East-West All Star Game between black teams was played in 1963.
The Monarchs folded in 1964.;  THE NEGRO LEAGUES; The four most successful

   NEW YORK -- CBS Inc. delayed its third-quarter earnings
report until after the World Series, in a highly unusual move
that foreshadows additional losses beyond the $275 million
pretax deficit the company has already taken on its
billion-dollar baseball contract.
   The broadcasting company said third-quarter earnings,
which should have been disclosed yesterday, will be reported
in November after the completion of an "evaluation of the
carrying values of certain of its major sports rights
properties." Late last year, CBS took pretax losses estimated
at $275 million, and an after-tax loss of $170 million, to
write down the value of the company's $1.06 billion,
four-year baseball pact to reflect its depressed value.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The delay came one day after CBS garnered the lowest
ratings in broadcast history for a Major League Baseball
playoff game. Tuesday's opening contest of the American
League championship playoff between the Minnesota Twins and
the Toronto Blue Jays finished in third place behind the ABC
and NBC networks. The game on CBS was watched by 11.6% of
homes with TV sets. That was lower than last year's opening
National League playoff game, which at the time was the
worstrated championship game ever aired. That contest,
between the Pittsburgh Pirates and Cincinnati Reds, was
watched on CBS by 12.2% of homes.
   Tuesday night, by contrast, Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'s ABC
network grabbed a 16.7% rating, and General Electric Co.'s
NBC network beat CBS with a rating of 14.4% of U.S. homes.
   Many in broadcasting and along Madison Avenue argued that
CBS, then mired in last place in prime-time ratings and
desperate for a boost, vastly overpaid when it signed the
Major League Baseball deal, now in its second season. The
network was hurt further by the severe downturn in ad
spending and a glut in sports programming, which has forced
CBS to sell commercials for the baseball playoffs at rates
lower than in last year's games.
   But CBS had hoped the baseball losses were done with after
taking its large writeoff in last year's fourth quarter. Even
then, the network warned that it would run a loss for all of
1991.
   Now, "It appears CBS doesn't think their initial
write-down on baseball was adequate," said Lisbeth Barron, an
analyst with S.G. Warburg &amp; Co. "It doesn't look good" for
CBS, which has leap-frogged from last place to first in the
three-week-old 1991-92 television season. The rejuvenated
prime-time programming won't help the network's woeful
position in its baseball contract.
   "It's difficult to know how much of this is related to the
poor advertising environment and how much is related to the
fact that CBS simply overspent," Ms. Barron said.
   The baseball playoffs picture will likely get bleaker.
Like the American League finals, the National League playoffs
are between two teams, the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Atlanta
Braves, that are in small television markets and aren't
expected to draw as big of an audience as, say, the No. 2
market Los Angeles Dodgers, which lost the chance to be in
the playoffs by one game.
   However, CBS got some good news when the Toronto Blue Jays
defeated the Minnesota Twins in the second game of the
seven-game series, giving each team one win. The longer a
playoff series goes, the better it is for the network because
excitement, and therefore, possibly, ratings build. The
American League playoffs will not be a four-game sweep by
either team.
   CBS made its announcement after the New York Stock
Exchange closed yesterday. In late trading yesterday, CBS was
down $1.50 at $152.25.
   CBS expects to announce the third-quarter results prior to
early November. A company spokesman said the internal study
of sports costs began "recently," but declined to be
specific. The study will be reviewed by CBS's outside
auditors of Coopers &amp; Lybrand.

<LEADPARA>  Bo Jackson will make his Chicago White Sox debut as designated hitter Monday
night against his old teammates, the Kansas City Royals.;   The White Sox made

Indians, and Jackson was ecstatic about returning to the big leagues as a

<TEXT>     "I'm excited," said Jackson, whose hip was injured in an NFL playoff game
last season. "I'm excited to be back. Most people said I wouldn't play
baseball again.";   Jackson spent the last week testing his hip in six games
with White Sox minor league clubs. He met with trainer Herm Schneider, who
said, "From a medical standpoint, Bo's ready to play major league baseball
again. He's ready in terms of range, flexibility, strength, pain level and
frame of mind.";   Jackson said, "If I strike out four times, that's great,
because I'll be back on the field doing it.;   "I'll probably always walk with
a limp," Jackson said, "but I run better than I walk. So, expect to see me run
a lot."; INJECTIONS FOR GWYNN: Tony Gwynn's left knee was drained and he
received a cortisone shot, procedures that will keep the San Diego Padres
outfielder out of action for at least two more games.;   Dr. Jan Fronek
drained fluid from Gwynn's knee, which has been bothering him since he hurt it
sliding during a game at Houston earlier this month.;   Manager Greg Riddoch,
concerned with the way Gwynn was hobbling to first base, removed the right
fielder after the seventh inning of Friday's game against Pittsburgh.;   After
two days, Gwynn's condition and availability will be evaluated on a day-to-day
basis.;   Saturday's game was only the second Gwynn had missed this season.
After Saturday night's games, Gwynn was leading the National League in
batting, at .323.; ETC.: Pittsburgh Pirates playoff and World Series tickets
will go on sale Tuesday by mail, the team said Saturday. If the Pirates win
the N.L. East, the first two playoff games will be at Three Rivers Stadium.
Games 6 and 7 also will be in Pittsburgh if necessary. If the Pirates play in
the World Series, Games 3 and 4 will be played in Pittsburgh, as will Game 5,
if necessary. . . . The California Angels have purchased the contract of
former New York Mets catcher Barry Lyons, whom the Angels signed as a free
agent June 19. Lyons hit .317 in 46 games with Triple-A Edmonton.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  The Pittsburgh Pirates will make one last push to re-sign Bobby Bonilla, but
they don't anticipate reaching a deal with the four-time All-Star, board
chairman Douglas Danforth said.;   Bonilla, considered the catalyst of
baseball's rebirth in Pittsburgh over the last five years, can become a free

<HEADLINE>  PIRATES TO MAKE LAST BID TO RE-SIGN BONILLA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "He's a great player, a great person, a great guy," Danforth said. "If he
goes, we'll miss him. But we'll wish him well whether he's playing here or
somewhere else. We hope it will be here, but . . .";   The Pirates tried to
re-sign Bonilla during spring training, but talks broke off after Bonilla
turned down a four-year, $16 million deal. After being rejected by Bonilla,
the Pirates quickly signed Gold Glove center fielder Andy Van Slyke to a
three-year contract extension for $12.65 million.;   The two sides did not
resume serious negotiations again until midseason, when the Pirates slightly
increased their previous offer. It was again rejected.;   "We'll take one more
big shot after the season; we don't want to do anything to disrupt a player's
concentration right now," Danforth said. "But I'm not very optimistic. . . .
It's very much a long shot.";   Barry Bonds, a strong contender for his second
straight most valuable player award, has said there is little chance he will
re-sign with Pittsburgh next year if the Pirates don't sign Bonilla, his
closest friend on the team.;   "If they want to keep having championship
seasons here, the Pirates had better pay," Bonds said Sunday. "Maybe it's time
to move on.";   Danforth said the Pirates are committed to re-signing "our
marquee players" but realistically can't afford all of them.  </TEXT>

WOULD YOU BELIEVE THE SANTA CLARA GIANTS?
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICK PETERS, MCCLATCHY NEWS SERVICE
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They don't call them the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
They don't call them the Arlington Rangers.
</P>
<P>
The NBA champions aren't known as the Auburn Hills Pistons.
</P>
<P>
In the NFL, they're not the Foxboro Patriots, the Irving Cowboys, the Pontiac
Lions or the East Rutherford Giants.
</P>
<P>
Why, then, must they be called the Santa Clara Giants?
</P>
<P>
From a provincial standpoint, it's understandable why the folks in the Santa
Clara Valley want their name on the major-league sports map. Surely, there's
more to life than cultivating prunes, peaches and computer chips.
</P>
<P>
But Santa Clara Giants? It has a minor-league ring to it. Can you imagine the
snickering when the National League West standings list Santa Clara with Los
Angeles, Atlanta and Cincinnati?
</P>
<P>
Granted, Giants owner Bob Lurie has consented to the name change. Spurned by
San Francisco, he simply will take his toy down the street and change its name.
That surely will shake up the boys in the financial district.
</P>
<P>
What did anyone expect Lurie to do? He has no choice, other than selling to
owners who would move the Giants much farther away than Santa Clara. If he
wants to keep the team in his beloved Bay Area, he would agree to call them
anything -- perhaps even the Milpitas Giants or the Saratoga Giants.
</P>
<P>
But it's a ridiculous idea. This is a regional baseball team, and it deserves
better than to be named after a suburb.
</P>
<P>
If a change must be made -- and that's a reasonable assumption given the fact
that San Francisco doesn't care that much about its baseball team -- why not at
least give it a regional identity? Something like Bay Area Giants or Redwood
Giants isn't ideal, but it makes more sense.
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara Councilwoman Sue Lasher, who spearheaded the Santa Clara Giants
movement by insisting on a name change, has noble intentions. But how would her
voters feel if such a stubborn stance cost them an opportunity for a
major-league team?
</P>
<P>
Anyone who isn't emotional about the issue might realize that it's far more
important to acquire a team of such stature than to be petty and concerned
about what it is called.
</P>
<P>
THE RIPPER REBOUNDS -- The San Diego Padres were 1-11 in new manager Greg
Riddoch's first 12 games before entering the weekend with a 9-3 record in their
next 12. Much of the credit for the turnaround goes to Jack Clark.
</P>
<P>
He was batting .358 with nine homers and 19 RBI in his last 24 games through
Friday, a hot streak that has led him to announce his intention of remaining
with the Padres despite the likelihood of being granted free agency because of
the recent collusion ruling.
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad there are people in this organization who are patient," Clark said.
"My priority is to stay here. I would like to be a part of this team next
year."
</P>
<P>
Clark, who is in the final year of a $2 million contract, once again is forming
a solid one-two punch with newcomer Joe Carter, who had seven RBI in his last
four games through Friday. Over a longer haul, Carter has 15 RBI in 13 games
after producing only four in his previous 21 games.
</P>
<P>
Craig Lefferts also has contributed, bouncing back from a mid-season slump to
register 11 1/3 scoreless innings. He also has 15 saves and has allowed only
four of 30 inherited runners to score.
</P>
<P>
STREAKING SABO -- While many observers expect Eric Davis to carry the
West-leading Cincinnati Reds down the stretch, third baseman Chris Sabo
continues to be the club's surprising offensive standout.
</P>
<P>
Sabo homered for the fourth consecutive game Friday night, one away from Johnny
Bench's club record, set in 1972. Sabo is among the league leaders with 27
doubles and has a career-high 21 homers. He leads the Reds with 54 RBI.
</P>
<P>
Sabo seems a cinch to erase the record for home runs by a Cincinnati third
baseman. Tony Perez, later a first baseman, hit 25 home runs as the Reds' third
baseman in 1971.
</P>
<P>
The Reds entered play Saturday 11-14 since the All-Star break, losing 3 1/2
games off their lead. A recent 2-10 slump has given new life to the Giants and
the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
Davis has been the most notable culprit, going hitless in five of six games.
Most of the other regulars have been hitting, however, making the Reds' lack of
run production even more mysterious.
</P>
<P>
NO-HITTER INEQUITIES -- When Scott Garrelts of the Giants and Doug Drabek of
the Pittsburgh Pirates lost no-hitters with one out to go in the ninth inning
Friday, it brought the major-league season totals to seven no-hitters and eight
one-hitters.
</P>
<P>
It also brought to mind that no-hitters shouldn't be awarded unless a pitcher
goes at least nine innings, or eight if accomplished by a losing team on the
road, as was the case with Andy Hawkins of the New York Yankees last month.
</P>
<P>
It seems unfair that pitchers receive credit for a no-hitter when a game is
shortened by rain, as the Chicago White Sox's Melido Perez did this season.
Many no-hitters are lost in the eighth and ninth innings. Why should those
pitchers be penalized while others profit from inclement weather?
</P>
<P>
AROUND THE HORN -- Kevin Mitchell has a new hobby. He enjoys watching his new 3
1/2-inch pet boa devour mice. "I dropped a mouse into the fish tank the other
night, and a second later, it was gone," Mitchell said. "Man, those boas are
strong." ... With the Philadelphia Phillies and the Atlanta Braves out of their
division races, the impact of the Dale Murphy trade Friday night was
diminished. "Why block a deal between the Braves and the Phillies?" Giants
general manager Al Rosen asked. One would think Murphy might have gone to a
contender for the stretch drive. It's a strange deal to figure, and with Von
Hayes probably shifting back to first base, Ricky Jordan's future in
Philadelphia appears shaky. ... The Padres are 17-29 since Jeff Brantley broke
Benito Santiago's forearm with a pitch June 14. ... Santiago began his
rehabilitation at Triple-A Las Vegas last week and is expected back next week.
</P>
<P>
Calvin Schiraldi wants to be a starter for San Diego, and he is proving it by
enabling the last 16 runners he has inherited to score. ... Ryne Sandberg
entered the All-Star break with a .335 average, 24 homers and 57 RBI. Since
then he is barely above .200 with one homer and six RBI.

<DESCRIPT>  BASEBALL; PROFESSIONAL; CONTRACT; AGREEMENT; KANSAS; CITY  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  First baseman Wally Joyner signed a one-year, $4.5 million contract with
Kansas City on Monday and repeatedly choked back tears as he discussed his
reasons for choosing not to re-sign with California as a free agent.;   "I am
absolutely thrilled to have an opportunity to play with the Kansas City
Royals," Joyner said in Miami Beach at baseball's winter meetings. "It was . .
. (20-second pause) probably the toughest decision I've made. I've enjoyed my
time with the California Angels. That's where Wally World started. . . . But
in my opinion, I didn't see a future with myself and the Angels.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  ROYALS SIGN JOYNER FOR '92 AT $4.5 MILLION
ASSENMACHER-CUBS DEAL PAYS $7.5 MILLION  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Baseball Notebook; Mercury News wire services contributed to this report.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "My reaction this morning shows my frustration and disappointment that I
couldn't play for a great man like (Angels General Manager) Whitey Herzog. We
tried as best we could with what we had to go with, and it didn't happen.";
Joyner, 29, hit .301 with 21 homers and 96 RBIs last season, regaining the
form of his earlier years. He had reached an agreement regarding salary with
the Angels, but Herzog had said Sunday that the club withdrew an offer because
neither side could agree on "the payout of the contract." Herzog had seemed
bitter about Joyner's attitude in the negotiations.;   Royals General Manager
Herk Robinson said the club voluntarily waived its right to prohibit Joyner
from being a free agent for five more years.;   Joyner indicated the wholesome
environment of the Kansas City area was a key to his decision. "I have a
family that I care an awful lot about, and that was a real big reason I chose
Kansas City. I would like to stay there as long as I can."; CUBS KEEP
ASSENMACHER: The Chicago Cubs retained versatile left-handed pitcher Paul
Assenmacher by signing him to a three-year, $7.5 million contract.;
Assenmacher, 31 today, was 7-8 with 15 saves and a 3.24 ERA in 75 games last
season. He led National League relievers by pitching 102 2/3 innings.; ORIOLES
RETAIN OLSON: Gregg Olson, one of the best young relievers in baseball, was
rewarded with a two-year, $3.75 million contract by Baltimore. Olson, 25, was
4-6 with 31 saves and a 3.18 ERA last season. He set a team record with 37
saves in 1990.; BONDS TRADE AN OPTION: The Pittsburgh Pirates are willing to
trade outfielder Barry Bonds, but it will take a lot to get him, Pittsburgh
Manager Jim Leyland said.;   "We're not going to trade Barry Bonds just to
trade him," Leyland said while discussing the Pirates' options at the winter
meetings. "I'd rather play the 1992 season with Barry Bonds. I think this will
be a big season for him.";   Before the Pirates even got to the meetings,
Bobby Bonilla signed a five-year deal for $29 million with the New York Mets.
Now, they also face the loss of free agents Bob Walk, Mike LaValliere and
Steve Buechele.;   Last week, General Manager Larry Doughty said the club
would trade Bonds if it could not sign him to a contract extension. Bonds,
eligible for free agency after the 1992 season, will be seeking at least $6
million a season.; STATE OF THE GAME: Commissioner Fay Vincent issued his
state of the game speech at the winter meetings, telling baseball officials
that spending was out of control and suggesting a system of revenue sharing
needed to be examined. Vincent has said things like that in the past, and
often times they've gone unheeded.;   Vincent also issued a report on minority
hiring, saying there were more minorities working in baseball, but in the most
high-profile positions -- managers and general managers in the majors -- there
has been almost no progress.; EXPOS TRADE JONES: There was only one actual
deal involving major leaguers Monday. Montreal sent pitcher Barry Jones, who
had demanded a trade, to Philadelphia for young catcher Darrin Fletcher and
cash.; TOP D.H.: Chili Davis of the World Series champion Minnesota Twins was
named the outstanding designated hitter of 1991. Davis, who signed as a free
agent with the Twins last winter, hit .277 with 29 homers and 93 RBIs.;
Frank Thomas of the Chicago White Sox was second and Milwaukee's Paul Molitor
was third.  </TEXT>

   D.B. Sweeney approaches acting the way Shoeless
Joe Jackson played baseball: Just do it.
   ``The best theory I ever heard about acting was from (James)
Cagney,'' said Sweeney, 26, who plays Jackson in John Sayles'
``Eight Men Out,'' the story of the 1919 Chicago White Sox scandal.
   ``You walk in. Plant your feet. Stare the other fellow in the
eyes and tell the truth. All the acting theories I've heard, all
the books I've read ... you can't get it any simpler or purer than
that.''
   ``Eight Men Out'' tells the story of the biggest scandal in
baseball. The 1919 White Sox were widely regarded as the best team
of their time. With such pitchers as Ed Cicotte and Lefty Williams,
and a lineup featuring future Hall of Famers Eddie Collins and Ray
Schalk, Chicago won the American League pennant and were heavy
favorites against the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series.
   No one, however, could play ball like Jackson, a lifetime .356
hitter and outstanding left fielder. Once a mill worker in South
Carolina, he had little education and could not read or write, but
was peerless on the field.
   ``He was very passive,'' Sweeney noted. ``He took the path of
least resistance in everything he could. Everything he did was from
a defensive mode, except on the field, where he attacks.''
   Sweeney wanted to contrast Jackson's athletic grace with his
awkwardness in private life.
   ``On the field, I wanted him to be like (ballet superstar
Mikhail) Baryshnikov. I wanted every move he made to be
beautiful,'' Sweeney said. ``Off the field, I wanted him to be
tentative.''
   Players earned little money in Jackson's era and were often
tempted by gamblers to throw games. Eight members of the White Sox,
including Jackson, agreed to, or were aware of, an effort to
deliberately throw the series against Cincinnati.
   The Reds won the series and the White Sox' poor play aroused
widespread suspicion. The following year, Commissioner Kenesaw M.
Landis permanently banned Jackson and his seven teammates from
baseball.
   No one could ever prove that Jackson, who batted .375 in the
World Series, ever tried to throw a game. More likely, he was
punished for being aware of the fix and not trying to stop it.
   ``They don't kick you out of the Pentagon for knowing about
fraud,'' Sweeney said, adding that Jackson, who died in 1951,
should have his name cleared and be inducted into the Baseball Hall
of Fame.
   Daniel Bernard Sweeney was born and raised in Shoreham, N.Y. He
attended Tulane University and hoped to play major league baseball
until tearing ligaments in his right knee.
   The injury convinced Sweeney to pursue a career in acting, and
he transferred to the performing arts division of New York
University. After graduating in 1984, he appeared in the Broadway
revival of ``The Caine Mutiny.''
   He made his film debut in Sidney Lumet's ``Power,'' and has
since appeared in Francis Ford Coppola's ``Gardens of Stone'' and
``No Man's Land.''
   Although Sweeney has not appeared on stage in two years, he
still prefers the working atmosphere of the theater.
   ``On `No Man's Land,' there were about four producers, one
director to start the film and one to end it. We had five different
writers. And by the way, we also have these actors,'' he said.
   ``In a play, even if it's a Neil Simon play on Broadway, it's
going to have to be about the actors or nobody's going to come. I
enjoy acting on stage better because there are less people with
walkie-talkie's in your face.''
   Sweeney felt an immediate rapport with Sayles (``Brother From
Another Planet,'' ``Matewan''), and enjoyed working with him on the
set.
   ``We met in New York and talked for about an hour. We talked
about Roberto Clemente (the late Pittsburgh Pirates star). John
likes the Pirates. He's a real blue-collar man. Those are the right
reasons to like a baseball team,'' he said.
   ``I had access to John all the time. We had a great
relationship. We would just check in with each other to gauge each
other's continued enthusiasm.''
   To prepare for the film, Sweeney traveled to Kenosha, Wis., and
worked out with the local minor league team.
   ``Kenosha is a good town for Jackson. A real blue-collar town.
Everybody there works for one of those corporations. I think
there's a similar ethic about work that Jackson might have grown up
with.
   ``That's the world where Jackson came from.''
   Playing Jackson boiled down to forgetting about everything
except baseball.
   ``I tried to stand there and clear my mind,'' Sweeney said. ``He
would just stand and take his three swings and more often than not,
hit it, and hit it well. In my daily life, I have to deal with bank
statements, acting, associates and friends and things. It's often
like a juggling act.''

National League.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>OKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Oakland Athletics swept to the
American League pennant and their third straight World Series
Wednesday in a 3-1 defeat of the Boston Red Sox, whose pitching ace
Roger Clemens was ejected by an umpire.
   In the National League playoffs, the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the
Cincinnati Reds 3-2 to stay alive in the best-of-seven series.
Before a hometown crowd, the Pirates relief pitcher Bob Patterson
extinguished a ninth-inning rally by intentionally walking one
batter to load the bases and getting the next man to ground into a
double play. The Reds lead the series, three games to two.
   American League Playoff Game 4 was the second victory in the
series for pitcher Dave Stewart, and his eighth straight win in a
head-to-head matchup with Clemens. The Boston ace was ejected in
the second inning for arguing over balls and strikes with umpire
Terry Cooney.
   A wild 10-minute game interruption followed. Clemens charged the
plate and shoved another umpire. Several Red Sox spilled onto the
field, along with two water coolers and a trash bin full of bubble
gum and sunflower seeds from the Boston dugout.
   Stewart maintained a two-hit shutout until the ninth inning,
when Ellis Burks doubled and scored on a Jody Reed single. Relief
pitcher Rick Honeycutt took over and sent Boston to its eight
straight playoff defeat.
   The A's, the first team to reach the World Series three straight
times since the 1976-78 New York Yankees, will begin their baseball
championship defense Tuesday night in either Cincinnati or
Pittsburgh.

<TEXT>     Dave Henderson is so much fun to watch that he sometimes watches himself on
the scoreboard TV. He makes a great catch, he takes a bow. He waves to his
fans. He smiles. He prances. He dances. He hits a home run and minces around
the bases.;    Nobody in baseball has more fun playing than Dave Henderson.;
 It's not about loving to play. If that's all it was, we'd give you Cal Ripken
Jr., the man of a thousand nights in a row. It's not about playing hard, or
we'd be talking about Will Clark or Carney Lansford. It's not about being
exciting, like Ozzie Smith, or intense, like Kirk Gibson.;    It's all those
things and one thing more: joy.;    Dave Henderson plays the game with
unbridled, unabashed joy. He plays as if he just found out this morning that
he's in the major leagues. He plays the way you think you'd play.;    Only one
player in baseball comes close to matching Henderson's day-in, day-out
enthusiasm. His name is Ozzie Guillen and for the next four days at the
Coliseum, the Chicago White Sox shortstop and the A's center fielder will
provide a lively sideshow to the main event. The series opens tonight.;
Meanwhile, if you'll direct your attention to the third-base line, we'll
introduce the All-Fun Team. Enjoy the game. These guys do.; CATCHER: Boston's
Tony Pena works while sitting on his butt. He's a chatterbox, whether he's in
the clubhouse or behind the plate. "He always says how ugly I am, like I
should be wearing the mask," says Henderson.; THIRD BASE: George Brett, third
base? Sure. George Brett, fun? "He's one of the first guys I think of,"
Guillen said. So be it.; SECOND BASE: Jose Lind of the Pittsburgh Pirates. As
a hobby, he jumps over teammates while they're standing around the infield.;
SHORTSTOP: Ozzie Guillen. The camera pans the White Sox dugout and there's
Guillen, sitting on Carlton Fisk's lap like a baby. The evil eye, the voodoo
curse -- he's like the Chicken without the uniform.;    "I like to have fun. I
like to do crazy things," Guillen said. "So far, I've played for three
managers and they've all understood."; FIRST BASE: Joe Carter, Toronto.
Nominated by both Henderson and Guillen, he's an outfielder. But the outfield
is full.; OUTFIELD: Capt. Dave Henderson is joined by Seattle's Ken Griffey
Jr. and Minnesota's Kirby Puckett. Think of how many times you've seen Griffey
Jr. come off the field wearing that big, mouthy grin. Puckett just looks like
fun. Henderson agrees, but "I might have to drop Puck for Kruk." Puckett or
Philadelphia's John Kruk or Pittsburgh's Andy Van Slyke? We'll leave it to the
manager.; MANAGER: Tony La Russa, no way. Roger Craig, not now. Seattle's Jim
Lefebvre is so alive he's almost combustible, but the guy having the most fun
not playing this game is Tommy Lasorda.; STARTING PITCHER: Despite Henderson's
wishes for Larry Andersen, and at the risk of destroying team chemistry, the
choice is Pascual Perez. He pistol-shoots his strikeout victims and has been
known to make pickoff throws between his legs to first base. But the clincher
is that Perez occasionally does the "moonwalk" on his way off the field.;
RELIEF PITCHER: None. We're staying with Pascual all the way -- if he can find
the ballpark.  </TEXT>

   D.B. Sweeney approaches acting the way Shoeless
Joe Jackson played baseball: Just do it.
   ``The best theory I ever heard about acting was from (James)
Cagney,'' said Sweeney, 26, who plays Jackson in John Sayles'
``Eight Men Out,'' the story of the 1919 Chicago White Sox scandal.
   ``You walk in. Plant your feet. Stare the other fellow in the
eyes and tell the truth. All the acting theories I've heard, all
the books I've read ... you can't get it any simpler or purer than
that.''
   ``Eight Men Out'' tells the story of the biggest scandal in
baseball. The 1919 White Sox were widely regarded as the best team
of their time. With such pitchers as Ed Cicotte and Lefty Williams,
and a lineup featuring future Hall of Famers Eddie Collins and Ray
Schalk, Chicago won the American League pennant and were heavy
favorites against the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series.
   No one, however, could play ball like Jackson, a lifetime .356
hitter and outstanding left fielder. Once a mill worker in South
Carolina, he had little education and could not read or write, but
was peerless on the field.
   ``He was very passive,'' Sweeney noted. ``He took the path of
least resistance in everything he could. Everything he did was from
a defensive mode, except on the field, where he attacks.''
   Sweeney wanted to contrast Jackson's athletic grace with his
awkwardness in private life.
   ``On the field, I wanted him to be like (ballet superstar
Mikhail) Baryshnikov. I wanted every move he made to be
beautiful,'' Sweeney said. ``Off the field, I wanted him to be
tentative.''
   Players earned little money in Jackson's era and were often
tempted by gamblers to throw games. Eight members of the White Sox,
including Jackson, agreed to, or were aware of, an effort to
deliberately throw the series against Cincinnati.
   The Reds won the series and the White Sox' poor play aroused
widespread suspicion. The following year, Commissioner Kenesaw M.
Landis permanently banned Jackson and his seven teammates from
baseball.
   No one could ever prove that Jackson, who batted .375 in the
World Series, ever tried to throw a game. More likely, he was
punished for being aware of the fix and not trying to stop it.
   ``They don't kick you out of the Pentagon for knowing about
fraud,'' Sweeney said, adding that Jackson, who died in 1951,
should have his name cleared and be inducted into the Baseball Hall
of Fame.
   Daniel Bernard Sweeney was born and raised in Shoreham, N.Y. He
attended Tulane University and hoped to play major league baseball
until tearing ligaments in his right knee.
   The injury convinced Sweeney to pursue a career in acting, and
he transferred to the performing arts division of New York
University. After graduating in 1984, he appeared in the Broadway
revival of ``The Caine Mutiny.''
   He made his film debut in Sidney Lumet's ``Power,'' and has
since appeared in Francis Ford Coppola's ``Gardens of Stone'' and
``No Man's Land.''
   Although Sweeney has not appeared on stage in two years, he
still prefers the working atmosphere of the theater.
   ``On `No Man's Land,' there were about four producers, one
director to start the film and one to end it. We had five different
writers. And by the way, we also have these actors,'' he said.
   ``In a play, even if it's a Neil Simon play on Broadway, it's
going to have to be about the actors or nobody's going to come. I
enjoy acting on stage better because there are less people with
walkie-talkie's in your face.''
   Sweeney felt an immediate rapport with Sayles (``Brother From
Another Planet,'' ``Matewan''), and enjoyed working with him on the
set.
   ``We met in New York and talked for about an hour. We talked
about Roberto Clemente (the late Pittsburgh Pirates star). John
likes the Pirates. He's a real blue-collar man. Those are the right
reasons to like a baseball team,'' he said.
   ``I had access to John all the time. We had a great
relationship. We would just check in with each other to gauge each
other's continued enthusiasm.''
   To prepare for the film, Sweeney traveled to Kenosha, Wis., and
worked out with the local minor league team.
   ``Kenosha is a good town for Jackson. A real blue-collar town.
Everybody there works for one of those corporations. I think
there's a similar ethic about work that Jackson might have grown up
with.
   ``That's the world where Jackson came from.''
   Playing Jackson boiled down to forgetting about everything
except baseball.
   ``I tried to stand there and clear my mind,'' Sweeney said. ``He
would just stand and take his three swings and more often than not,
hit it, and hit it well. In my daily life, I have to deal with bank
statements, acting, associates and friends and things. It's often
like a juggling act.''

   But Delay in Baseball Season
   Complicates the Task;
   Toronto's Passover Woes
   ----

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- If it hadn't been for professional baseball's
32-day lockout, pious Jewish fans of the Toronto Blue Jays
wouldn't have been in such a tizzy.
   The Blue Jays had been scheduled for an off-day today. But
the week-long delay in the baseball season's opening has sent
them to Arlington to play the Texas Rangers tonight. Both
teams would then fly to Toronto for what was rescheduled as
an afternoon game tomorrow.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But that would violate a players' association rule: No
team can play a day game on the day after a night game if
that would require an airplane flight of more than 90
minutes.
   So tomorrow's game was again rescheduled, for tomorrow
night -- when many Jewish ticketholders will be observing the
Seder, or Passover supper, at home. In a four-day period, the
Blue Jays got 150 telephone calls complaining of the
conflict. "It's caused quite a stir here," says Gary Oswald,
a spokesman for the team.
   The Blue Jays have decided to offer refunds to the
frustrated ticketholders, but that isn't the end of their
scheduling woes. Another rescheduled game with the Rangers is
set now for Aug. 6. That, however, would mean games on 21
successive days for the Blue Jays, and the players'
association rules require a day off after 20. In this case,
the association is being asked to waive the rule.
   Multiply such problems by the major leagues' 26 teams,
each of which can gain a financial edge in advantageous
scheduling, and you get an idea why baseball scheduling is
too complicated to trust to computers.
   The job largely falls instead on a soft-spoken,
publicity-shy married couple on New York's Staten Island,
Henry and Holly Stephenson. Few fans have heard of them, and
the Stephensons would just as soon keep it that way; they
have troubles enough satisfying people like George
Steinbrenner. The Stephensons only reluctantly discuss their
job with an outsider.
   Their firm, Stephenson Systems Co., spends about eight
months a year scheduling 2,106 baseball games under a
contract with Major League Baseball, a league organization
headed by the commissioner. Nobody involved will say how much
the contract is worth, except that it is less than $1 million
a year.
   Scheduling a season is tough enough. Changing a single
game is something like pulling an orange from the bottom of a
neatly stacked pile in a grocery.
   In 1987, the Montreal Expos were to play in a new stadium,
but nobody knew whether it would be finished in time for the
opener. So the Stephensons put Montreal on the road for the
first two weeks, confounding the schedules of at least three
other National League East teams.
   One was the Pittsburgh Pirates. They usually enjoy a
preponderance of home games in June, when warm weather draws
larger crowds. The revised schedule meant more home games in
chilly April. "It severely hurt our attendance," says Bernie
Mullin, a Pirate executive. "The schedule can make a
tremendous difference" in attendance and revenue.
   The Stephensons try not to resort to doubleheaders to make
up for lost days. Owners dislike them because they generate
less revenue than two single games. This year's season delay
will mean more doubleheaders than usual, though.
   Mr. Steinbrenner, principal owner of the New York Yankees,
has groused for years about American League scheduling. The
Yanks draw bigger home crowds against old rivals like Boston
and Baltimore, especially in the summer, than when they play
some newer teams. "I don't like the way scheduling has been
done, and not many are completely satisfied," says Mr.
Steinbrenner, though he concedes the Yankees are getting a
fair shake in heavy-drawing home games this summer.
   In the American League, after the Stephensons turn in
their draft schedule, most of the complaints from
dissatisfied teams come to the league's scheduling committee.
Dick Wagner, a special assistant in Major League Baseball,
was fielding calls in his office last month, when the first
week of the regular season still had to be rescheduled. "I'm
not Houdini, chief," he told one caller. "I'm sorry to do
this to you, but everybody's going to be hurt."
   Long before opening day, questionnaires sent to the major
league teams give them a chance to make special requests.
   The Expos and the Toronto Blue Jays always want to play in
the U.S. on July Fourth, but not on July 1, which is Canada
Day. The Boston Red Sox have always played at home on
Patriots' Day in Massachusetts. The Minnesota Twins always
want to be away on the third weekend of May. Might as well
be; it's the opening day of wall-eye season.
   In New York, the Mets want to be home when the Yankees are
away, and the Yankees want to be home when the Mets are away.
The same is true for the other two-team places, Chicago, San
Francisco-Oakland, and Los Angeles-Anaheim. "They don't
always get what they want," Mrs. Stephenson says.
   In 1984, the Texas Rangers asked to be home when the
Republican convention kicked off in Dallas, to attract
convention-goers. But in San Francisco, site of the
Democratic convention, the Giants asked to be put on the
road, partly to avoid congestion. Also, the All-Star game
would be played in San Francisco the preceding week, making
the Giants games that would follow seem anticlimactic. Both
teams got what they wanted.
   In many stadiums, baseball isn't the only thing going on.
There are also rock concerts, trade shows and professional
football. The conflicts keep cropping up to make things tough
for the schedulers. That often means they have to do another
version of the schedule. "We did up to 14 in one year," Mrs.
Stephenson says.
   The Stephensons were living in Greenwich Village and
writing software as New York City employees in the 1970s when
by chance they met George Faust Sr., father of a friend. Mr.
Faust, then director of broadcasting for the National
Basketball Association, mentioned that the NBA was having a
hard time finding somebody to program its schedule on a
computer. It was then being done entirely by hand by
80-year-old Steve Gottlieb, who was preparing to retire.
   A year later, the Stephensons, who yearned to start their
own business, volunteered for the job. They soon learned
there was no way to do a schedule entirely by computer.
   In 1981 they were offered the Major League Baseball
contract. They also scheduled the now-defunct North American
Soccer League and still do the Major Indoor Soccer League.
The NBA now does its own scheduling, though.
   From the time the Stephensons start the schedule in
December until they turn in a rough draft a few months later,
they are always working a season ahead. The next four months,
they work with league scheduling committees to review and
revise.
   Teams that get bad breaks one season usually get favored
treatment the next. The Stephensons and the committees stick
to the system they know best, a mixture of pencil and paper
and computer, arranging blocks of games in repeating patterns
and then resolving the inevitable conflicts with owner
demands, players-association rules and competing events.
   So far as the Stephensons are concerned, the 1990 season
is ancient history now. They're busy working on 1991.

MORNING BRIEFING: TO DRAW MORE, SIMPLY VISIT THE DEEP WELL
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Offhand, which would you say were the two worst baseball cities in the National
League in 1990?
</P>
<P>
If you rate the teams according to attendance by market size, as the Pittsburgh
Press did recently, the answer is New York and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, who outdrew every other National League team in gross attendance
with 2,925,853, ranked 11th in attendance by market size, with 21,248 per
100,000. And the Mets, second in gross attendance with 2,617,300, occupied the
deep cellar with 14,444 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
Add attendance: The newspaper's chart showed the Pirates third, with 80,950 per
100,000, behind Cincinnati, with 126,954, and St. Louis, with 101,042.
</P>
<P>
Baseball fever? Greater Pittsburgh hasn't necessarily caught it. The Pirates
drew only 45,611 for Game 3 of the National League playoffs Monday and 50,461
for Game 4 Tuesday. Capacity for baseball at Three Rivers Stadium is 58,729.
</P>
<P>
Last add attendance: Pirate General Manager Larry Doughty did his part before
Monday's game. Walking outside the stadium, he saw a young man waiting by one
of the gates.
</P>
<P>
Doughty asked him what he was waiting for. The man said he was hoping to get in
but couldn't afford a ticket. Doughty handed him a ticket for a third-base box
seat.
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What was the only major league game in which every player on one
team finished with the same batting average he had when the game began?
</P>
<P>
Bad news, so-so news: For Fresno State, what good could possibly come from its
73-18 mauling at the hands of Northern Illinois Saturday?
</P>
<P>
Maybe the Bulldogs can take solace in a statistic. By surrendering only 73
yards passing, they moved from 11th place to a tie for ninth in the NCAA
Division I-A pass defense ratings.
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Northern Illinois offense attempted only six passes, completed
four and spent most of its time running the ball for 733 yards.
</P>
<P>
Throw in the towel: Washington Post columnist Tony Kornheiser, on the
harassment of Boston Herald reporter Lisa Olson in the New England Patriots'
locker room: "Keep Olson out and you discriminate. You break the law.
</P>
<P>
"And the commissioners of all the major sports won't let that happen -- because
they're all lawyers. They know women will take them to court and beat the pants
off them."
</P>
<P>
Now it can be told: The Chicago Cubs defeated Philadelphia, 4-3, last
Wednesday, the final day of the season, to tie the Phillies for fourth place in
the National League East.
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the credit went to the Cubs' manager . . . Andre Dawson.
</P>
<P>
Manager Don Zimmer said he let his right fielder make all the decisions.
</P>
<P>
Dawson, sitting at the manager's desk in the clubhouse, said: "I was kidding
around before the game, saying I was going to manage. Zim said, 'Go ahead and
manage.' "
</P>
<P>
Add Dawson: Said Zimmer: "All I told him was I wanted (Greg) Maddux to win his
15th."
</P>
<P>
Before Dawson pulled him after eight innings, Maddux (15-15) gave up seven hits
and had a season-high nine strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
Said Maddux: "I didn't mind coming out after the eighth inning. I was tired and
struggled the final three innings. It would have been silly to stay in."
</P>
<P>
As any fourth-place manager could tell you.
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Bob Feller's opening-day no-hitter against the Chicago White Sox
at Comiskey Park in 1940.
</P>

IS THERE A LIMIT TO SALARIES?;
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: BANKRUPTCY FOR A MAJOR LEAGUE TEAM IS CONSIDERED POSSIBLE BY SOME
EXECUTIVES BECAUSE OF THE COST OF FREE AGENTS.
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The 1990 baseball free-agent auction is nearly over, a hyperactive exercise in
free enterprise. Along the way, contracts worth millions of dollars were
bestowed upon great and mediocre players.
</P>
<P>
In one 30-day stretch between November and December, 29 players were signed to
contracts totaling $209 million, at an annual average salary of $2.4 million
for an average of three years.
</P>
<P>
In neon, the figures flashed across the tote boards of the national pastime:
Darryl Strawberry for $20.2 million! George Bell for $9.8 million! Franklin
Stubbs for $6 million! Matt Young for $6.4 million?
</P>
<P>
If ownership's apparent desire to mug itself so willingly leads fans to assume
that surely the money must be there, there is another way to look at baseball's
increasingly bizarre balance sheet: What if a team went broke trying to pay the
free-agent freight?
</P>
<P>
It's not so strange a thought. Sure, there are still three years left on CBS'
and ESPN's $1.46-billion deals, which gives each owner about $14 million
annually. Sure, baseball attendance keeps breaking records.
</P>
<P>
But with so much money being spent so freely, the idea that one day a
ballclub's salary expenses may so exceed its revenues that it could go broke is
not out of reason's realm.
</P>
<P>
"I think you might have more than one team go bankrupt and no buyer out there
willing to take the responsibility for it," says General Manager Al Rosen of
the San Francisco Giants, who in the last month committed $33 million of owner
Bob Lurie's money to lure pitchers Bud Black and Dave Righetti and outfielder
Willie McGee to Candlestick Park.
</P>
<P>
Lurie had previously made commitments totaling $30 million to Will Clark and
Kevin Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
"You'd hope it wouldn't come to bankruptcy," says Bob Quinn, general manager of
the Cincinnati Reds. "But knowing (baseball's) history, it might have to come
to it. We always come close to the brink before taking action."
</P>
<P>
The question to answer over the next few years -- assuming a continuing salary
spiral that could produce an average player salary of $1 million, from the
current $597,000 -- is this: Would a team's bankruptcy make a dent in the
skyrocketing salaries?
</P>
<P>
"It would certainly be a rare occasion for a sports club to go bankrupt," says
the Kansas City Royals' president, Joe Burke. "But you know, I don't even know
if a bankruptcy would stop the salary spiral."
</P>
<P>
Says Lurie: "If a club went bankrupt tomorrow, I don't even know if it would
matter. Teams would say, 'It's your problem, not ours.' "
</P>
<P>
If Lurie is right, it is even more likely that little sympathy would come from
the players' side. After all, the players' association has proved highly
unsympathetic to the owners when they cry poverty.
</P>
<P>
Agent Jack Sands, who negotiated a two-year, $2.2-million deal for Willie
Wilson on Dec. 3 that shifted him from Kansas City to Oakland, says:
"Bankruptcy won't happen. But if it does, the players wouldn't say the party's
over, the owners were right and let's give back the family jewels."
</P>
<P>
Sands insists that a team owner on the brink of bankruptcy would find willing
buyers, especially in the four cities recently eliminated from consideration as
expansion-team sites. "The commissioner won't let a team go broke," Sands adds.
</P>
<P>
In fact, a team going belly-up would not be a Chapter 11 bankruptcy. If no
successor owner loomed in the wings, the team would be handed over to the
league to operate and sell.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to talk about a team going broke," says Deputy Commissioner Steve
Greenberg. "But to remain competitive on the field, you have to compete for
talent. Some teams will have to make a decision to lose millions of dollars by
signing players or to compete with less expensive, less experienced players,
which means you don't compete. Going broke is an extreme, and a rational person
would hopefully choose to go with a skeleton crew."
</P>
<P>
Even if the sight of an owner filing a bankruptcy petition at federal court is
unlikely, though, it is probable that some financial woes will descend upon
some, maybe even many teams, for several reasons. Increased salaries are the
obvious culprit. Payrolls of $30 million will soon be common, and revenues must
flow in if those obligations are to be met.
</P>
<P>
And consider the future financial stability that seemed assured with the
CBS-ESPN contracts that expire after the 1993 season. Some teams barely put
their hands on the cash before handing much of it right over to the players.
</P>
<P>
"That TV money went through us like ships passing in the night," says Pirate
President Carl Barger.
</P>
<P>
The Giants, for instance, will pay $17.7 million to their five free-agent
signees this season, $3.7 more than the club's share of the TV riches. The
Athletics have far exceeded their annual national TV booty with their
re-signings of Jose Canseco, Dave Stewart, Dave Henderson, Bob Welch, Dennis
Eckersley and Rickey Henderson.
</P>
<P>
Not to be ignored in the equation is the effect of the $280-million collusion
penalty levied against owners earlier this year for rigging the free-agent
markets in 1985, 1986 and 1987. Each team will pay $10.76 million to the
players' association in installments over 15 months, starting Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
Also of concern to some recently purchased teams, such as the Texas Rangers and
Seattle Mariners, is the cost of paying bank loans used to finance some of the
acquisition costs.
</P>
<P>
"Some teams will have to make some very difficult decisions," says Jeff
Smulyan, part owner of the Mariners, who adds that the Mariners' debt is not
onerous. "I don't see a bankruptcy happening, but you could see some economic
misery."
</P>
<P>
Owners in small markets certainly have the greatest reason for financial
concern, especially when they see how much more in TV-and-radio rights fees
their big-market brethren receive. How can the have-nots, with no more than $5
million to $7 million in broadcast fees, play the free-agent sweepstakes game
when the haves play the sport with $15 million to $50 million?
</P>
<P>
Well, in some cases, they can. Take the peculiar case of the Royals, with only
$5 million in rights fees. Weep not for the Royals -- at least as long as owner
Ewing Kauffman is there. Kauffman is a generous, civic-minded septuagenarian
who built a billion-dollar fortune in pharmaceuticals. He wants to win so badly
that he will spend obscenely to make Kansas City proud.
</P>
<P>
So what if bestowing millions of dollars last year on pitchers Mark Davis and
Storm Davis proved to be a bust? Since November, he has signed pitcher Mike
Boddicker for three years at $9.25 million, outfielder-designated hitter Kirk
Gibson for two years at $3.3 million, and left-hander Dan Schatzeder for a year
at $700,000.
</P>
<P>
"We thank the good Lord every day Mr. Kauffman's here," Burke says. "He's not
operating the ballclub for his own profit. We lost money in 1990 and we've
assured him we'll lose money in 1991."
</P>
<P>
So profoundly does Kauffman want to win that he does what other fabulously
well-to-do owners won't: He subsidizes player signings with his own cash.
</P>
<P>
Says Burke: "We can't compete with other teams as far as our income, so we have
to have an owner willing to spend his own money. We don't pass higher salary
costs on to the fans. We pass it on to Mr. Kauffman."
</P>
<P>
In Pittsburgh, however, the thought of going back to the team's partners is
unconscionable, says Barger.
</P>
<P>
"They won't subsidize the team," he says. "We won't go back to them for
operating capital."
</P>
<P>
Obviously, when the Pirates' bill for future free-agents Bobby Bonilla and Andy
Van Slyke comes due next year and the bill for Barry Bonds and Doug Drabek
comes due in 1992, Barger will play with fiscal fire if they pay all four what
they're worth, or community fire if they let their corps of stars depart.
Already, the Pirates have allowed free-agents Sid Bream and R.J. Reynolds to
leave for the Braves and Japan, respectively.
</P>
<P>
"If I said every one of our players will be with us, I'd be frivolous," Barger
says. "We have a strategy that we hope will keep us competitive."
</P>
<P>
In fact, small-market teams such as the Pirates, Braves, Royals and Reds must
find ways to resist the impulse to bid on free agents the way such big-market
giants as the Dodgers, Angels and Mets do. Developing a productive minor league
system is certainly the alternative, but free agents are so tempting when a
team has a hole tailor-made for the right free-agent veteran.
</P>
<P>
The Reds' Quinn has a quaint credo -- "Know when to say when!" -- when costs
butt up against need. Having lost pitcher Danny Jackson, Quinn re-signed
pitcher Tom Browning for four years at $12.5 million, and second baseman Bill
Doran for three years at $7.3 million, then chased Zane Smith around the
financial bases -- but stopped when he felt Smith's agent manipulating the Reds
to jack up the Pirates' offer.
</P>
<P>
"Sanity comes in when you hang up the phone," says Quinn. "I said, 'Consider
the click of the phone your answer.' We know our fiscal restraints, but you
have to be man enough to live by them."
</P>
<P>
Still, adding $19.5 million in new salaries (while shedding Jackson's
$1.15-million 1990 contract) does not presage the dawn of austerity.
</P>
<P>
Both players and owners are looking toward a newly named joint economic study
committee to sort out the future of player compensation. Earlier this year,
during the 32-day spring training lockout of players, owners proposed a
revenue-sharing plan. The players balked and the owners shelved the idea.
</P>
<P>
Any type of revenue-sharing -- modeled partly on the NBA's revenue-sharing and
salary cap system -- must mediate the disparities in local TV-and-radio income
between the rich and poor clubs. Persuading the Yankees to pool their
$50-million-plus in annual rights fees with teams getting $5 million will
surely be difficult for the have-not owners.
</P>
<P>
The question now is whether the study committee, whose members include Paul
Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, can resolve the knotty
compensation issues that have roiled baseball's management-labor relations.
</P>
<P>
Well, Volcker wrung inflation out of the national economy in the 1980s. Maybe
he can find a way to solve baseball's salary inflation in the 1990s.

BISONS BULLISH THEY'LL DRAW MILLION FANS AGAIN
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN F. BONFATTI, Associated Press
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BUFFALO, N.Y.
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Buffalo Bisons are trying to become the first minor-league team to draw at
least a million fans in back-to-back seasons. But owner Bob Rich Jr., said
they're not getting any help from the schedule-makers or the weatherman.
</P>
<P>
"We have 16 (home) games in April. That's going to put us a little bit more
behind the eight-ball," Rich said prior to Wednesday's season-opener. "I think
we'll have a better shot after we get through April of knowing if the million
is do-able."
</P>
<P>
The Bisons' American Association opener against the Louisville Redbirds
illustrated Rich's concerns.
</P>
<P>
Snow over the weekend turned to rain earlier in the week. But temperatures
remained around 40 degrees and, combined with a healthy breeze, helped make for
a number of no-shows at 19,500-seat Pilot Field.
</P>
<P>
"If we have inclement weather throughout April and it shuts down a bunch of
games, it's really going to be tough because last year, we were 85% occupancy,"
said Rich.
</P>
<P>
Still, 18,614 seats were sold for the opener and a season-ticket base of 9,000
assures the team will sell at least 640,000 tickets this year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Bisons set a single-season minor-league attendance record with
ticket sales of 1,186,561.
</P>
<P>
Aggressive promotions and the novelty of a beautiful new downtown stadium
helped bring the fans in. But that loyalty didn't translate into on-field
success.
</P>
<P>
The Bisons, the Pittsburgh Pirates' top farm team, finished two games above
.500, but were third in the four-team American Association East, 17 games
behind division-winning Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
Rich was clearly disappointed with the team's performance and vowed, along with
the Pirates, to have a more respectable club this season.
</P>
<P>
"The Pirates have really worked hard," Rich said. "They have a new organization
evaluating new talent and they've worked hard to get us a winner."
</P>
<P>
But Rich's first move was to lure Albuquerque Dukes manager Terry Collins out
of the Los Angeles Dodgers' system to replace Rocky Bridges, a career
minor-league manager whose low-key approach to winning angered Bison fans and
Rich.
</P>
<P>
Collins, 39, was Manager of the Year in each of the past two seasons in the
Pacific Coast League and led the Dukes to the PCL title in 1987.
</P>
<P>
"The most significant improvement over last year is the addition of Terry
Collins," Rich said. "He's our kind of guy. The people here want to see
athletes in all sports hustling and giving it their all."
</P>
<P>
Collins admitted he took a career gamble in leaving the Dodgers organization,
where he had been for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
"To come over here is a challenge, and that's what I'm accepting it as; a
challenge to go out and accomplish here what we accomplished the last couple of
years in Albuquerque," Collins said.
</P>
<P>
Rich made it clear to the Pirates he wanted some veterans to supplement
Pittsburgh's prospects.
</P>
<P>
So the Pirates went out and signed several players with major league
experience, including 34-year-old Tito Landrum, 36-year-old Steve Henderson,
33-year-old Jim Pankovits, 31-year-old Bill Scherrer and 38-year-old Rennie
Stennett, who hadn't played baseball in five years.
</P>
<P>
Landrum, Scherrer and Stennett didn't make it past spring training, but
Pankovits will be Buffalo's second baseman this season and Henderson will play
behind -- and tutor -- Pirates outfield prospect Steve Carter.
</P>
<P>
"Here's a guy who's got 10 years in the big leagues, he's got nothing else to
prove, and yet if you watch him play every day, he plays like he's 23," Collins
said of Henderson. "He's going to be a big asset to us all year."
</P>
<P>
The conflict between the desire to win and the essentially developmental nature
of minor league ball has soured many a relationship between a parent team and
its farm club.
</P>
<P>
But Collins said those two goals aren't necessarily incompatible.
</P>
<P>
"One of the things Pittsburgh -- and all of baseball -- is looking for is a
winning player, a player who knows what it takes to win," Collins said.
</P>
<P>
A competitive team will help the Bisons as they shoot for another million fans
at Pilot Field this season, which will in turn help Rich's goal of a major
league team in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you're going to see teams move out of existing cities,
especially with the anticipation of expansion, which is so much more prevalent
this year," said Rich, noting new baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti
has listed adding two National League teams as one of his priorities.

<LEADPARA>  IT WAS 1973, and San Diego had just drafted two-sport star Dave Winfield from
the University of Minnesota. Don Zimmer, then the Padres' manager, was
supposed to give the big outfielder a courtesy look before shipping him to the
minor leagues.;    "Right away I called (General Manager) Buzzie Bavasi,"
Zimmer recalls, "and I said, 'Let's keep him. He's better than what I got.' "  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Some information in this report was obtained from writers in other cities.
N.L. Report  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Zimmer kept him, and it not only started Winfield's career quickly but
illustrated the manager's willingness to take chances on young talent. Zimmer
has showed that penchant from time to time, and the most recent example came
with his announcement last week that Gary Scott, 22, is the Chicago Cubs' new
third baseman.;    Scott, who has played only one full season of pro baseball,
hit .521 (21 for 41) in the first two weeks of exhibitions and showed good
instincts in the field. He will replace Luis Salazar, who will remain with the
team in a utility role. Third base had been the only large question mark for
the Cubs, who also added George Bell in left field, and Danny Jackson and Dave
Smith to their pitching staff.;    "I know there are certain managers who
don't like to play young players," Zimmer said. "I say give a guy a chance to
play. See what he can do.";    Two years ago, Zimmer insisted that young
catchers Joe Girardi and Rick Wrona could carry the Cubs through the stretch
drive of a pennant race. The Cubs won the National League East. If the
pitching holds up, Scott could be the missing piece in a World Series
contender. The third-base job was split last season among Salazar, Domingo
Ramos and Curtis Wilkerson.;    "I don't think (pressure) will bother him,"
Zimmer said of Scott. "He's just a good player with a good head on his
shoulders.";  BIG DEAL? While Bobby Bonilla was asking for $20 million over
five years from Pittsburgh, management was asking for a great deal itself.;
The Pirates, who could lose the outfielder to free agency after this season,
offered him to the New York Yankees for outfielder-first baseman Kevin Maas
and outfielder Roberto Kelly. The Pirates originally had asked for Maas and
two minor league prospects, but they felt that a proven outfielder also would
be needed in any such deal. Maas hit 21 homers in 79 games as a rookie last
season.;    "It'd be a good deal for the Pirates," said Bonilla, who was
raised in the Bronx, a mile from Yankee Stadium. He knows that if he was with
the Yankees, he would be at least a $4 million player. With the Pirates, he
tentatively will make $2.4 million this season, despite two consecutive losses
in salary arbitration.;    Bonilla, 28, hit .280 last season with 32 homers
and 120 RBIs, the most RBIs by a Pirates player since Willie Stargell drove in
125 runs in 1971.;    "I understand the economics," Bonilla said. "If I stay
in Pittsburgh I'll have a good year, and if I play somewhere else I'll have a
good year. I always give all I've got.";  NOBODY'S BUSINESS: Padres General
Manager Joe McIlvaine said he is concerned about the escalation of baseball
salaries, but he also is concerned about the public's knowledge of them.;
"The worst thing that happened to baseball was the publishing of salaries,"
McIlvaine said. "I'd like to see it as it used to be, when a man had his own
salary. All those human imperfections build on one another.";  PRIME POSITION:
When Atlanta left fielder Lonnie Smith underwent arthroscopic surgery on his
left knee Wednesday, it all but locked up the starting job for Deion Sanders.;
   Smith will miss up to three weeks of the season. Sanders, who came to camp
with a more low-key approach after being released by the Yankees, was hitting
.351 through Wednesday. He had scored a team-leading nine runs and had stolen
three bases.;    "We told him we would give him this opportunity when we
signed him," General Manager John Schuerholz said of Sanders, who had figured
to be playing at Triple-A Richmond. "But the guy has made us take notice.";
HAIL THE CHIEF: Earlier this spring, Commissioner Fay Vincent escaped a
hailstorm at Scottsdale Stadium by ducking into the A's dugout.;    "Hey,
Commissioner," a player told him, "this weather is terrible.";    "It really
is," Vincent agreed.;    Then, the player looked at him and said, "Hey, you
had an earthquake at the World Series, it rained at the (1990) All-Star Game,
and look at you today. Maybe it's you.";  NO TAKERS: Giants Manager Roger
Craig said he talked with Pittsburgh Manager Jim Leyland on Thursday in a
continuing effort to find recently waived outfielder Rick Leach a home. Craig
said the Pirates' recent acquisition of Gary Varsho from the Cubs left no such
room.;    "I think Leach will be a great rookie-league coach or manager --
when he's finished," Craig said. "He has so much enthusiasm. You can suggest
these things, but he thinks he still can play. And he can, if you find a team
that will give him a chance.";  AROUND THE HORN: For the curious, here is how
Barry Bonds and father Bobby compare 717 games into their respective careers:
Bobby leads in batting average, .275 to .265; home runs, 128-117; RBIs,
393-337; and steals, 181-167. Barry leads in walks, 377-321, and has struck
out 295 fewer times. . . . A Clark has led the National League in walks in
each of the past four seasons, Jack three times and Will once. Will leads N.L.
players in that category this spring. . . . Houston shortstop Rafael Ramirez
has had more errors than walks in each of his 11 major league seasons. . . .
Cincinnati pitcher Tom Browning has led the league in starts four of the past
five seasons. Robin Roberts, Don Drysdale and Phil Niekro are the only other
pitchers who have led the league in starts as many as four times since 1900.  </TEXT>

WHAT LOCKOUT? BASEBALL'S BACK

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A capacity crowd at Boston's Fenway Park cheered today as Red Sox pitcher Roger
Clemens fired the first pitch of the 1990 baseball season, which began a week
late because the owners and players were embroiled in a contract dispute.
</P>
<P>
No bitterness was evident in the stands, where fans seemed to take a
better-late-than-never attitude.
</P>
<P>
"People forgive them," said one Boston fan, William Cullen of Cherry Valley,
Mass. "We're Americans. You love a thing, you're going to go."
</P>
<P>
Toni Giamatti, widow of the late Baseball Commissioner Bart Giamatti, threw out
the ceremonial first pitch at Fenway, where the Red Sox faced the Detroit
Tigers.
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, Giamatti's successor as commissioner, Fay Vincent, threw
out the ball at New York's Shea Stadium before the Mets took on the Pittsburgh
Pirates. Mets pitcher Dwight Gooden followed with the first real pitch of the
game -- and, like Clemens, he threw a strike.
</P>
<P>
There was no game in Cincinnati, marking just the third time since 1876 that
the Reds have opened on the road. Because of the revised schedules, the Reds
play tonight in Houston, where the Astrodome is celebrating its 25th
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to be at home, so it's not going to be as big a deal,"
Cincinnati's Tom Browning said. "The crowd's not going to be part of the
hoopla."
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, the Cubs and White Sox were each home today. The White Sox,
starting their last season at Comiskey Park, played Milwaukee, and the Cubs are
to face Philadelphia in the first night opener at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
The Oakland Athletics, trying to become the first World Series winner to repeat
since the New York Yankees in 1977-78, open at home tonight against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
To make it to the World Series, the Athletics will have to win their third
straight American League West title and hold off California and Kansas City,
two teams that improved through free agency.
</P>
<P>
The Angels signed Mark Langston and the Royals got National League Cy Young
winner Mark Davis along with Storm Davis, a 19-game winner for Oakland last
season.
</P>
<P>
"It just seems the way those two teams have improved that it's going to take a
lot of wins to finish first," Oakland manager Tony La Russa said. "What we
really stress is taking care of our business. If I had to pick one club to deal
with, it would be this one."
</P>
<P>
In other AL openers, Baltimore was at Kansas City this afternoon and Seattle is
to play the Angels tonight. In the NL, San Diego played at Los Angeles during
the day and Montreal is at St. Louis tonight.
</P>
<P>
A lot of players are starting the season in new places. Joe Carter is in San
Diego after being traded for Sandy Alomar Jr., Carlos Baerga and Chris James.
The New York Mets sent Randy Myers to Cincinnati for John Franco in a swap of
relievers, and the Mets dealt Juan Samuel to Los Angeles for Mike Marshall and
Alejandro Pena.
</P>
<P>
Free agency also reshaped rosters and the salary structure, increasing the
average pay to nearly $600,000. Kevin Bass is in San Francisco, Pete O'Brien is
in Seattle, Dave Parker in Milwaukee, Pascual Perez with the Yankees, Oil Can
Boyd in Montreal, Craig Lefferts in San Diego, Hubie Brooks in Los Angeles, and
two old Mets have moved -- Keith Hernandez to Cleveland and Gary Carter to San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
Some players are returning from long absences. Dave Winfield is with the New
York Yankees after missing last season with back problems. Pitcher Greg Mathews
is with St. Louis after missing last year with elbow trouble. Mike Norris, a
22-game winner with Oakland in 1980, is again with the Athletics, making a
comeback at age 35 after physical and drug problems forced him out of the major
leagues in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Some players won't be on the field on opening day. Paul Molitor, Kirk Gibson,
Todd Worrell, Rick Sutcliffe and touted rookie Ben McDonald of Baltimore are
among those on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
Others won't be anywhere. Darrell Evans, with 414 career home runs, was
released by Atlanta in spring training. Joaquin Andujar, who hoped a strong
showing in the senior league would help his comeback, was cut by Montreal.
</P>
<P>
Alomar, Todd Zeile of St. Louis, John Olerud of Toronto and Marquis Grissom of
Montreal are rookies likely to make an impression.
</P>
<P>
Some familiar faces are back, too. Nolan Ryan starts tonight for Texas at home
against Toronto.
</P>
<P>
Ryan, 43, needs 11 victories to reach 300. He won 16 last season for the
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
"There's some records I don't care that much about, but I do want to win 300
games," Ryan said. "It's probably the only time I've ever gone into a season
shooting at a statistic."
</P>
<P>
The Toronto at Texas game is one of those rescheduled because of the lockout.
On Tuesday, the two teams will play as previously scheduled, this time in
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
President Bush and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney will toss out the
first balls at the SkyDome when the Rangers, owned by Bush's son, travel to
play the Blue Jays.

<LEADPARA>  FIRST BASE -- Not a strength of either team. Gimpy Sid Bream will be a focal
point at the start because of his reluctant move from Pittsburgh as a free
agent after last season and his invaluable guidance for the Braves this
season. But Bream will give way for the three games after tonight to rookie
Brian Hunter (50 RBIs in only 271 at-bats), who bats against left-handers and
came through with big second-half hits. Pittsburgh also platoons with a
veteran against left-handers (Gary Redus, .143 vs. Atlanta in 1991) and a
rookie against right-handers (Orlando Merced, .333 vs. Atlanta). Edge: Even.;
  SECOND BASE -- Pittsburgh's Jose Lind had a big playoff homer last fall, and
he has been steady if not spectacular this season. Atlanta's Jeff Treadway hit
.320 in 306 at-bats this season, and he was 9 for 20 against the Pirates. But
Treadway has a sore wrist that will require winter surgery, so light-hitting
Mark Lemke starts instead. Edge: Pirates.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  N.L. POSITION-BY-POSITION MATCHUPS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     SHORTSTOP -- Jay Bell hit only .178 against Atlanta this season, but he
otherwise emerged for Pittsburgh as much more than the game's best sacrifice
bunter. Bell's 1990 backup, Rafael Belliard, went to Atlanta over the winter
and is basically a Jose Uribe who solidifies the defense but is an easy out.
Edge: Pirates.;   THIRD BASE -- This series will showcase the MVP favorites,
including Atlanta's Terry Pendleton. He played third with his usual aplomb and
came out of nowhere with his offense, winning the batting title with a .319
average. His leadership can't be overlooked, either. Pittsburgh acquired
former Stanford standout Steve Buechele from Texas in the second half, and no
one has a better glove at third. No. 6-hitting Buechele will force the Braves
to pitch to No. 5 hitter Barry Bonds, which is something the Braves didn't
have to worry about in the regular season. Edge: Braves.;   CATCHER --
Atlanta's Greg Olson made the All-Star team in 1990 and faded in the second
half; this season, he took over around midseason, when Mike Heath was injured,
and went on to become one of the team's top clutch hitters. Pittsburgh still
platoons Mike LaValliere against right-handed pitchers and Don Slaught against
left-handers, with success. Edge: Braves.;   LEFT FIELD -- Bonds for
Pittsburgh. Lonnie Smith for Atlanta. Edge: Pirates.;   CENTER FIELD --
Atlanta's Ron Gant was in the 30-30 club for the second consecutive season,
finishing with 32 homers, 34 steals and 105 RBIs. Pittsburgh's Andy Van Slyke
is the league's best at the position, and he hit .265 with 17 homers and 83
RBIs. Edge: Braves.;   RIGHT FIELD -- Atlanta's David Justice probably would
be in the MVP picture had he not been knocked out for two months in midseason
with a back ailment. He still finished with a .275 average, 21 homers and 87
RBIs. Justice is a better fielder than Pittsburgh's Bobby Bonilla (.302, 18
homers, 100 RBIs), but everyone in baseball is salivating over the Pirates'
slugger, who becomes a free agent when his season ends. Edge: Even.;
STARTING PITCHING -- Tonight's opener could be a matchup of back-to-back Cy
Young Award winners, with Pittsburgh's Doug Drabek the 1990 recipient and
Atlanta's Tom Glavine the leading candidate this year. Drabek was better than
Glavine in the second half and is hard to beat at Three Rivers Stadium;
Glavine was the All-Star starter and should be accustomed to the commotion.
Both staffs have three starters capable of dominating hitters (also Zane Smith
and John Smiley for Pittsburgh, and Steve Avery and John Smoltz for Atlanta).
Atlanta has the edge with the fourth starter: Charlie Leibrandt is in the
playoffs for his third team, and his six-game winning streak in the pennant
race was a major factor; Pittsburgh's Randy Tomlin had a 2.98 ERA in 27 starts
but was 8-7. Edge: Braves.;   RELIEF PITCHING -- Neither bullpen has a Lee
Smith-type hammer, although late-season pickup Alejandro Pena has converted
his last 11 save opportunities for the Braves. Pittsburgh's bullpen by
committee, featuring Stan Belinda, Bill Landrum and Roger Mason, somehow gets
it done. Edge: Even.;   MANAGERS -- Atlanta's Bobby Cox will win the
postseason award, not only for the team's mere presence in the playoffs but
for how he got the Braves through the midseason absences of Justice and Bream
as well as the late-season loss of Otis Nixon to a failed drug test. On the
other hand, Jim Leyland had to deal with the Bonds flap in spring training and
has been able to keep the Pirates focused amid constant economic issues. With
Whitey Herzog out of the league, Leyland probably is the best of today's N.L.
managers. Edge: Pirates.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Andy Van Slyke does not consider himself "The Great White Hope" of the
Pittsburgh Pirates, but he did give them a great deal of hope Wednesday.;
Van Slyke homered and doubled to drive in the first two runs in a 5-1 victory
over Atlanta in the opening game of the National League playoffs. He was the
center of attention afterward because of that reason, and also because of a
race issue started a day earlier by teammate Barry Bonds.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Bonds had called Van Slyke "The Great White Hope" during a discourse on the
Pirates' payroll problems. Van Slyke was signed last winter to a three-year,
$12.6 million contract. Bonds lost in arbitration, and teammate Bobby Bonilla
turned down a contract for the same average salary.;   When told that some
players who make $2 million are not worth that much, Bonds had said, "They
ain't black. And you guys know the truth. Everyone knows what's going on with
this team. Open your eyes. Wipe those glasses. You know what's going on. You
don't want to write it. You just want to goad Barry Bonds into saying it.";
Bonds then called Van Slyke "The Great White Hope" and added, "Do you think
Bobby Bonilla should make more than Andy Van Slyke? He's worth more. I think
so. But I'm happy for Andy. He's a great guy. He deserves it. That just means
I'll make more.";   After Wednesday's opener, Bonds said Van Slyke was the
"catalyst" for the team. When Van Slyke was told that, he said, "The way
Barry's been talking about me, I thought I was the catalytic converter.;   "I
realize what Barry's saying and it doesn't bother me," Van Slyke said. "He's
saying what he feels, and I don't really take it that way. I think he says it
tongue in cheek. On a baseball field, I would hope we're beyond the color
barriers of this game, and I believe we are.";   On the field Wednesday, Van
Slyke gave the Pirates just the start they were seeking. He homered off Cy
Young Award candidate Tom Glavine on a 3-and-2 breaking ball in the first
inning, and in his next at-bat followed a single by Jay Bell in the third
inning with an RBI double to right-center.;   Van Slyke has big problems
against most left-handed pitchers, but oddly enough, he is 13 for 35 (.371)
against Glavine in his career.;   "He just happens to be one of the
left-handers I do hit," Van Slyke said, "and because I do, I'm glad he pitches
for the Braves. . . . I think it was important for the club to get off to a
quick start, get the crowd into it and hopefully get the Braves' momentum
stopped a little.";   Van Slyke scored after his double when Bonilla singled
to left, helped by an awful throw from left fielder Lonnie Smith. The Braves
continued to look more like the old Braves than the new, blowing a big chance
in the fourth inning.;   Mark Lemke led off with a shot past first baseman
Gary Redus and could have settled for a double, but he chugged toward third.
Bonilla missed the cutoff man, but Lemke still was nailed at third on the
throw by Bell, the shortstop.;   "Getting Lemke at third was the play of the
game," Bonilla said. "If we don't get him, that may have let them back in the
game.";   The way Doug Drabek was pitching, all the Braves could hope for was
an injury that might knock him out. Which is what occurred in the sixth
inning, and even that didn't matter. Drabek doubled home Steve Buechele, but
was thrown out trying to stretch it into a triple. Drabek had to withdraw
after that because of either a bad cramp or a strained left hamstring, one of
which he said will be determined when he comes to the park today.;   The
Braves never seriously threatened, finally breaking up the shutout on David
Justice's ninth-inning homer off reliever Bob Walk.;   "It was the first time
for a lot of our guys, and I could see us being over-anxious," Justice said.
"But once we got to the third and the fourth inning, it was a regular game for
us.";   The problem was, it was over by then.; HOW THEY SCORED;   Pirates 1st

<LEADPARA>  Bobby Bonilla said Tuesday that there is a "99.9 percent chance" he will not
be back with the Pittsburgh Pirates next season. Barry Bonds said he would be
"right behind him.";   That is what it boils down to for the Pirates as they
meet the Atlanta Braves tonight in the opener of the National League playoffs.
The Pirates are in the unusual position of beginning a postseason with the
knowledge that there probably will be no chance of being back soon.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  THIS COULD BE LAST HURRAH FOR PIRATES  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  '91 Baseball Playoffs  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     There was so much talk of a "last hurrah" during Tuesday's workouts at
Three Rivers Stadium, it was as if this were to be the last run of "Gigi" or
the final concert by The Who. The Pirates are making only their second
consecutive playoff appearance, and yet the now-or-never mentality is
pervasive. Pittsburgh is a small market, and looking at today's baseball
economy, there seems virtually no chance the Pirates could re-sign Bonilla
and/or Bonds after this and the 1992 seasons, respectively.;   "Maybe a few
people might disagree, but all you have to do is take a look at the whole
situation," Bonilla said. "We're just going to do our thing. It's great for
baseball that Atlanta is in the playoffs, but we've got things to do.;   "It's
probably a 99.9 percent chance I ain't gonna be back here. . . . All you've
got to know is the history of the negotiations. I haven't really thought about
it much lately. It's in their basketball court now.";   Asked if this would be
a particularly emotional series for him, Bonilla said, "No. I'm looking
forward to playing many more, no matter where I'm at.";   Bonilla was given
what some would call a serious offer by the Pirates, four years for $16.8
million. But he and his agent are seeking a five-year contract worth $25
million or more, and they probably will find it. Both New York teams are
interested, and California has entered the picture. Whitey Herzog recently
took over as Angels director of player personnel, and he has promised to give
82-year-old owner Gene Autry a World Series title. Doug Danforth, the Pirates'
chairman of the board, has said he will make one last pitch at Bonilla, but he
conceded that the prospects of a return are unlikely.;   Bonilla hit a
career-high .302 with 18 homers and 100 RBIs this season. Bonds hit .292
behind him, with 25 homers and a career-high 116 RBIs, and with his all-around
game should have at least equal value when he becomes eligible for free agency
after the 1992 season.;   "If Bobby leaves, I'm right behind him," Bonds said,
"because that man has made this the best two years of my life. . . . I've been
here when we were sixth, when we made it up to second, when we dropped to
fifth, and now through two division titles, and I'm not going backward. If the
Pirates don't want to give us a chance, then I'm going to help someone else.";
  Bonds and Bonilla have another motivating factor besides the future, and
that is the past. They vanished in the last playoffs, a six-game loss to
Cincinnati. Bonilla hit .190 and Bonds .167. While Bonds said he "forgot about
it after we lost," Bonilla recalled some dominating pitchers.;   "Cincinnati
had (Norm) Charlton, (Rob) Dibble and (Randy) Myers," Bonilla said. "They were
outstanding. Not too many people were hitting them all year.";   The Braves'
bullpen poses no such threat, but these teams match up about as evenly as
possible. Atlanta won nine of the regular-season meetings, but those were
before: (a) Pittsburgh added Steve Buechele for protection behind No.
5-hitting Bonds in the order; and (b) Atlanta lost leadoff man Otis Nixon to a
drug-violation suspension.;   "We've got a game to win, and that's our focus,"
Braves third baseman Terry Pendleton said. "We've done that all year long. The
hype will be bigger, but we'll approach it the same way."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Steelers Founder Dies at 87</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with new background. A version also moved

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Art Rooney Sr., who bought the Pittsburgh
Steelers in 1932 for $2,500 in racetrack winnings and turned the
team into a National Football League powerhouse in the 1970s, died
today. He was 87.
   ``At 7:45 a.m. this morning the Chief ... passed away in his
sleep with his family at his bedside,'' said Dr. Theodore Gelet,
Rooney's personal physician.
   Rooney had been in a coma since Monday. He was admitted to Mercy
Hospital with a stroke Aug. 17 after becoming dizzy at the team's
offices at Three Rivers Stadium.
   Rooney's Steelers struggled for 40 years until the 1970s, when
coach Chuck Noll and quarterback Terry Bradshaw led the team to
dominance in the NFL, becoming the only club to win four Super Bowl
games.
   Rooney's reputation for honesty, sincerity and benevolence won
him thousands of friends and once prompted Supreme Court Justice
Byron White, known as ``Whizzer'' during his Steeler playing days
in the 1930s, to say:
   ``There is no man in the world I respect more than Art Rooney.''
   Yet ``The Chief,'' as he was known, was a shrewd entrepreneur
and race-track operator who earned millions before turning over his
sports empire to his five sons in the late 1960s.
   Despite his wealth, Rooney never left the decaying neighborhood
on Pittsburgh's North Side where he grew up. His daily rituals _
Mass at a neighborhood church, five-minute walk to the stadium,
cigars and chats with reporters _ rarely changed.
   ``I'm a Pittsburgh guy,'' Rooney would say.
   Born Jan. 26, 1901, in Coultersville, Pa., Rooney was one of
eight children of a saloon keeper who moved his family to
Pittsburgh in 1903. As a youngster, he played where Three Rivers
Stadium now stands.
   Though his Steelers brought him the most fame, Rooney's first
love was horse racing. His racing holdings once included Yonkers
Raceway in New York, a dog track in Florida, the William Penn
Racing Association at Liberty Bell near Philadelphia and the Green
Mountain Race Track in Vermont.
   He even blamed his love of racing for the Steelers' early
football failures: ``I didn't give it the time. I was always going
to the race track.'' It wasn't until after 1969, a 1-13 season,
that the Steelers' luck changed. Rooney's son Dan, the team's young
president, hired away Baltimore Colts' assistant coach Chuck Noll
to lead the club. Then, in the first round of the college draft,
the Steelers took a promising defensive lineman named Joe Greene.
   The Steelers' first-round pick in 1970 was a brash quarterback
named Terry Bradshaw, who threw just six touchdown passes and 24
interceptions that season.
   ``When I was getting a lot of heat early on, he was the one who
told me, `You're going to be great. Don't worry about what those
guys are saying,'' Bradshaw said of Rooney.
   ``There was no other owner like him,'' Bradshaw said. ``He was
an original. He was a Northern Dancer, a Joe Namath _ one of a
kind.''
   The team went on to win Super Bowls in 1974, 1975, 1978 and 1979
and were hailed as ``The Team of the Decade.''
   Rooney, one of Pittsburgh's finest athletes, played football
against Jim Thorpe, baseball against Negro League greats Satchel
Page and Josh Gibson and was a superior boxer asked to represent
the United States in the 1920 Olympics.
   He is survived by his sons: Dan, the Steelers' president; Art
Jr., a vice president and former scouting director; and Pat, Tim
and John, who are involved in various family-related businesses.
   Funeral services will be held Saturday morning in Pittsburgh.
