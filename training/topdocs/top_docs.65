   The cost of America's failure to ensure that
pregnant women receive proper care can be calculated in the
millions of dollars. But it also can be measured in the tortured
body of an infant born too soon and too small, as Mitchell
Landsberg finds in the last of a three-part series, ``Surviving
Year One.''

   Eric could almost fit in his father's hand,
if his father were there to hold him. He is so small, so weak, so
sick - a little boy pushed into the world far before his time.
   He is kept alive by machines. Machines make Eric breathe, and
machines keep Eric warm. Machines feed him and machines record his
heartbeat, his pulse rate, his temperature.
   He lives in a sterile glass crib, surrounded by banks of
blinking lights, tangled in a webbing of tubes and splints and
bandages. His eyes and his mouth open and shut, and he writhes
gently. For all the machinery, it is human suffering that contorts
his face and a human will that keeps his tiny heart beating.
   It shouldn't have been this way. Eric was born six months into
his mother's pregnancy, without benefit of meaningful prenatal care
or decent nutrition, and most likely with the damaging effects of
drugs.
   Now Eric, like his sister before him, is in the neonatal
intensive care unit at the Children's Hospital of New Jersey. Here,
in the corroded core of one of America's poorest cities, doctors
and nurses struggle daily to save babies who enter life too soon,
too sick and too small.
   ``This is so typical,'' says social worker Debbie Beacher, who
has just finished listening to Eric's mother recite her story of
drug abuse and homelessness. ``An unwed mother, young, a drug
abuser, has a baby born prematurely that ends up in this unit.''
   It is like this around the nation, in cities big and small, in
places like the Hospital for Sick Children in Washington, D.C., and
Valley Children's Hospital in Fresno, Calif.
   ``We're seeing a growing need for our kind of hospital in just
the past few years,'' said Dr. Edna Leung, a pediatrician at the
Hospital for Sick Children. ``It's sad. We enjoy what we do ... but
we just wish we could make some of these problems go away.''
   The problems won't go away, and their legacy is children like
Eric. Society pays, and the costs are enormous.
   It costs about $600 to administer prenatal care to a woman
during the nine months of a normal pregnancy. Drug treatment for a
crack addict costs about $5,000.
   Without prenatal care, without drug treatment, the risks of a
woman delivering a premature, low birthweight child increase
dramatically. And so do the costs.
   It costs an average of about $25,000 to treat a low birthweight
infant - one under 5.5 pounds. For extremely low birthweight
babies, under 1.65 pounds, the average is more than $100,000.
That's an average. Some cost far more.
   Once, the point would have been moot - such tiny babies would
have died at birth. But medicine has made tremendous strides in
saving them.
   Between 1980 and 1987, the infant mortality rate in the United
States dropped by about 20 percent. During the same period, the
percentage of infants born to mothers who had no early prenatal
care scarcely changed, and the percentage of low birthweight
infants actually increased.
   Since birthweight is the single most important indicator of
infant health, the meaning is clear: Children are being born sicker
than ever, and medicine is using superior technology to keep them
alive.
   In Fresno, Dr. Nadarasa Visveshwara has been treating a baby
that weighed exactly 1 pound at birth. The child's mother, who is
on Medicaid, had received very little prenatal care.
   The baby is now six months old. The medical bills have topped
$750,000 and probably will be around $1 million by the time the
child is released from the hospital.
   The prospects for the child ever enjoying a productive life,
Visveshwara said, ``are very poor.''
   Does he ever ask, is it wise to save such children?
   ``Almost all the time,'' he said, ``because we hesitate to
produce an infant who will be a burden to the parents and to
society, and who won't be able to lead a productive life. ... But
the baby always gets the benefit of the doubt.''
   Eric, whose real name is being kept confidential, weighed
slightly more than 2 pounds at birth. In 1960, his odds of
surviving infancy would have been about one in 10. Today, they are
better than 50-50.
   His medical bills are around $100,000 and climbing, and his
parents have no ability to pay. His birth was costly, but not in
financial terms alone. There is an incalculable cost in pain and
suffering, in emotional distress and social disruption.
   These are statistics for extremely low birthweight infants,
those somewhat smaller than Eric:
   -90 percent will suffer respiratory problems.
   -70 percent will have brain hemorrhages.
   -80 percent will have heart problems.
   -50 percent will have liver problems.
   -5 percent to 10 percent will be blind.
   -2 percent to 3 percent will die of Sudden Infant Death
Syndrome.
   Of those who survive, 40 percent will be mildly handicapped, 40
percent will be severely handicapped and 20 percent will be normal.
   There's more. Premature infants are much more likely than other
children to have cerebral palsy. They are much more likely to have
learning disabilities later in life. And children who spend their
infancy in a hospital will have difficulty bonding with their
families, a trait also widely attributed to children exposed to
drugs in the womb. The longterm emotional costs are yet unknown.
   ``There's just not that closeness, and these kids have more
difficulty when we get them home,'' said Dr. John H. Niles Jr.,
president of the Medical Society of the District of Columbia.
``They're just not the joy that a baby should be.''
   ``It's like a Vietnam kind of thing,'' Niles added. ``These kids
have been in a battle, and there are going to be some scars. And
society is going to pay for those scars.''
   The easiest way to avoid the scars, most people believe, is to
make prenatal care widely available and do whatever it takes to get
women to take advantage of it.
   The most commonly repeated statistic about prenatal care is that
every $1 spent on it will save $3.30 in future medical costs.
   Dr. Shyan Sun, director of neonatology at the Children's
Hospital of New Jersey, is a skeptic. He shuffles through a file
drawer to pull out a list of everything his patients have going
against them. They are poor, they are young, they are unmarried,
uneducated; they abuse drugs, they drink, they smoke.
   ``One cannot naively believe that prenatal care alone will solve
the problem,'' Sun insisted. ``I am not optimistic that we will
make a difference in the near future. We still have to take care of
all these social problems.''

   Older women can now get pregnant after menopause
with the help of a method of test-tube fertilization that bypasses
one of the seemingly absolute barriers of biology.
   With this technique, doctors remove eggs from a healthy donor,
fertilize them in a lab dish with sperm and then implant them in
the infertile woman's womb.
   Its developers say the new method should allow healthy women to
routinely get pregnant and give birth after the change of life,
even when they are in their 40s, 50s and perhaps 60s.
   ``The menopausal woman can have a family using this
technology,'' said Dr. Mark V. Sauer of the University of Southern
California, who was among the first to offer the method.
   Of course, because the mother does not provide the egg, she is
not the genetic parent of her baby. Nonetheless, after she receives
the fertilized egg, she undergoes a normal pregnancy and delivery.
   Sauer's clinic charges $8,000 for each fertilization. In
addition, couples must pay $1,500 to the egg donor.
   This novel approach represents a way to circumvent the shutdown
of the ovaries, usually around age 50, that ordinarily represents
the end of a woman's reproductive life. But not any longer.
   ``The limits on the childbearing years are now anyone's guess,''
wrote Dr. Marcia Angell, executive editor of the New England
Journal of Medicine.
   ``Perhaps they will have more to do with the stamina required
for labor and 2 a.m. feedings than with reproductive function.''
   Sauer reported his findings in Thursday's issue of the journal.
It was the second report in two days offering the hope of pregnancy
for infertile women.
   In Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association,
doctors reported that a new device that opens blocked fallopian
tubes with a tiny balloon can offer a simpler and cheaper method
for helping some infertile women become pregnant than previously
available.
   The implantation technique reported by Sauer has gone into
widespread use among menopausal clients of fertility clinics across
the United States during the past two years.
   Among the first treated was a 42-year-old patient of Sauer from
El Monte, Calif The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
lost the use of her ovaries after she underwent chemotherapy for
cancer four years ago.
   Her test-tube baby, a girl, was born eight months ago.
   ``I didn't think I would ever be pregnant when my ovaries quit
working,'' she said. ``I was so happy. The baby seems like a
miracle to me.''
   Last week, she received the fertilized egg of what she hopes
will be her second child.
   Sauer said that up to 10 percent of women go through menopause
naturally by age 40. In his report, he described attempts to
achieve pregnancy in seven women in their early 40s.
   After giving the women hormone treatments to prepare their wombs
for pregnancy, doctors fertilized eggs from three donors and
implanted them. Six pregnancies were established. One ended in
miscarriage, and one was stillborn. Five normal babies were born,
including a pair of twins.
   Sauer said the success rate appears to be about three times as
high as in ordinary in vitro fertilizations, a technique that has
become widely used during the past decade to help infertile
couples. Typically, eggs are removed from a woman's ovaries,
fertilized outside her body and then put into her womb.
   Sauer said he believes the donated eggs work better because they
come from young women at the peak of their fertility and because
the recipients have not been hormonally stimulated to produce their
own eggs.
   It is possible that women approaching menopause could preserve
their own eggs for implantation, but freezing human eggs is still
experimental and it's unclear if it would work, doctors said.
   Dr. Howard Jones of Eastern Virginia Medical School, who
performed the nation's first successful in vitro fertilization,
said he has achieved pregnancies in 16 post-menopausal women over
age 40 using the same techniques.
   ``The key thing here is the donor eggs,'' Jones said. ``The eggs
are not as old as the mother. The pregnancies behave according to
the eggs rather than the mother.''
   Sauer said the major limit to the technique is the health of the
mother, not her age. Women in their 50s who are free of heart
disease, diabetes and other ailments may still be good candidates
for pregnancy, and having children after 60 is possible though
unlikely.
   The technique reported in the Journal of the American Medical
Association is designed for a particular type of blockage, present
among only 10 percent of the estimated 1 million American women who
have blocked fallopian tubes. The procedure, which requires neither
surgery nor general anesthesia, is similar to the use of balloons
to open heart patients' clogged arteries.

   An experimental vaccine may act as a
contraceptive for as long as six months without serious side
effects, according to a preliminary study of 30 women.
   In the study, the vaccine created blood proteins, or antibodies,
in the women that attacked a key hormone required for pregnancy,
researchers said.
   The effectiveness of the proteins could not be tested directly
because the test subjects had already been surgically sterilized.
But the level of proteins appeared to be high enough to block
pregnancy, researchers said.
   No significant side effects appeared in the women studied, said
the scientists from Australia, Ohio State University and the World
Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. The study appears in
Saturday's issue of The Lancet, a British medical journal.
   Several groups are also studying vaccines similar to the one
used in the new study, said Gabriel Bialy, chief of the
contraceptive development branch of the National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development.
   Some foreign governments have approved use of match-stick sized
capsules that are implanted just under the skin of a woman's arm
under local anesthetic. By slowly releasing a drug, they provide
contraception for five years unless removed sooner.
   A variety of strategies is needed to allow choices in birth
control, Bialy said.
   The vaccine was designed to spur the immune system into making
antibodies that attack a hormone called human chorionic
gonadotropin, which is produced during pregnancy.
   Animal studies had shown that an antibody attack on this hormone
can halt pregnancy at an early stage, researchers wrote.
   Scientists are not sure whether the attack prevents the
blastocyst, a clump of cells that grows from a fertilized egg, from
implanting itself in the uterus wall, or whether it prevents
further development soon after implantation, Bialy said.
   Implantation normally takes place six or seven days after the
egg is fertilized.
   The study focused on 30 women, ages 26 to 43. Twenty received
one of five dosage levels of the vaccine and the rest a placebo
injection. Each received two injections, six weeks apart, in the
buttocks. They were studied for six months after the first
injection.
   All vaccinated women showed antibody levels that apparently
would be high enough to block pregnancy, researchers said.
   On average, the four women who got the highest dose exceeded the
critical antibody level by the fifth week after the first
injection, and stayed above that level after six months. Two women
remained at or above the level for nine and 10 months, researchers
said.
   Women who received lesser doses reached the critical level about
six weeks on average after the first injection, which was at the
time of the second injection, and stayed there almost six months.
   No participants showed any serious side effects, researchers
said. Several in the highest-dose group had mild and temporary
muscle pain within two days of the injection.
   Twenty-five of the 30 women reported no change in their
menstrual patterns. Of the remaining five, one who had received a
placebo reported an early menopause. Three who received the vaccine
had slight bleeding, called spotting, between periods and one
reported excessive menstrual bleeding.

   For the first time, medical researchers are proposing to
give hormone drugs to healthy women to prevent breast cancer.
   In a move that would be revolutionary for any type of
cancer, scientists are talking seriously of using so-called
chemoprevention in women who have a higher-than-average risk
of developing breast cancer. Such women include those who
have a family history of breast cancer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Such high-risk women would be treated with drugs that
affect the female hormones that play pivotal roles in the
development of breast cancer. The drugs include tamoxifen,
which blocks the effects of the hormone estrogen on breast
cells, and human chorionic gonadotropin, which can simulate
the protective effects on breast cells of pregnancy.
Tamoxifen, sold under the brand name Novaldex by Imperial
Chemical Industries PLC of England, already is used to
prevent recurrences of breast cancer in women who have had
the disease.
   Such "hormonal intervention is an appropriate and
effective avenue to reduce the incidence of breast cancer,"
declares David T. Kiang, a cancer specialist at the
University of Minnesota, in an editorial in this week's issue
of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.
   Dr. Kiang's editorial was the second time in a matter of
days that scientists have suggested treating healthy women to
prevent breast cancer, from which 44,500 American women will
die this year, according to the American Cancer Society. Late
last week, at a meeting sponsored by the American Cancer
Society, a British cancer specialist reported that
researchers in his country are in the early stages of what
may become a full-scale test, involving 15,000 healthy women,
to see if tamoxifen can prevent breast cancer.
   A similar American study, to involve 16,000 healthy women,
is now in planning, Bernard Fisher told the cancer society
gathering. A breast surgeon at the University of Pittsburgh,
Dr. Fisher has coordinated several multi-institutional U.S.
trials of new breast-cancer treatments.
   In his editorial, Dr. Kiang says, "Accumulating evidence
has confirmed that endocrine {hormone} manipulation is
effective in preventing the development of rodent and human
breast cancer." In humans, he notes, a 1989 report showed
that daily doses of tamoxifen for two to five years after
surgery for the initial breast cancer reduced a woman's risk
of a tumor in the other breast by 45%.
   The effectiveness of chemoprevention in rodents was
demonstrated by a University of Wisconsin mouse experiment
reported in the same issue of the cancer institute's journal.
The experiment used mice that are highly susceptible to
breast cancer. Though breast cancer in mice is often caused
by a virus, it resembles human breast cancer in that hormones
have "a profound effect" on the development of the breast
tumor, V. Craig Jordan and his colleagues at the university's
Clinical Cancer Center in Madison explain.
   These specially bred mice ordinarily begin developing
breast tumors at six to 10 months of age, and almost all have
the disease by 20 months of age. In three-month-old mice, the
researchers implanted capsules that steadily released
tamoxifen for up to 17 months. Of these treated mice, 80%
remained free of breast tumors for up to six months after
tamoxifen treatment was stopped. Thus, the treatment
protected the mice essentially for a lifetime.
   The Wisconsin scientists cautioned that there are major
differences between human breast cancer and mouse breast
cancer. "Nevertheless, the concepts illustrated in the
present study may provide additional support for the use of
tamoxifen as a chemopreventive agent in breast cancer," they
wrote.
   In the cancer journal, researchers at the American Health
Foundation in Valhalla, N.Y., reported that a diet high in
fiber and low in fat cut in half the the incidence of breast
tumors in rats. The researchers speculate that the dietary
fiber might lower the amount of estrogen circulating in the
rats.
   The answers to when chemopreventive treatments should
begin and how long they should last already are being sought
in a British study, Trevor Powles, a cancer specialist at the
Royal Marsden Hospital in London, told the cancer society
last week. Preliminary tests on 200 women were promising. "We
were unable to show any evidence of unacceptable toxicity,"
Dr. Powles said.
   Tamoxifen is thought to work by blocking the proteins on
breast cells that ordinarily serve as receptors for estrogen,
the female sex hormone. Estrogen promotes the growth of
breast tumors in some women, but it also prevents bone loss,
or osteoporosis, and protects women against heart disease.
So, the researchers worried that tamoxifen might be
double-edged, preventing breast cancer but boosting the risk
of heart disease and bone loss.
   But, Dr. Powles said, two years of taking tamoxifen
produced no evidence "of increased bone loss or any
detectable adverse effect on {blood} clotting, and serum
cholesterol was significantly reduced." The British
researchers already are lining up medical centers for a
15,000-woman trial, he said.
   One major problem of tamoxifen as a breast-cancer
preventive is its use in women of child-bearing age, Dr.
Kiang writes. Because it interferes with the effects of
estrogen, tamoxifen treatment "may be deemed impractical in
young women because it would disrupt their normal family
life," he explains. Dr. Kiang notes that women who have never
been pregnant are at higher risk of breast cancer than women
who have had children.
   One alternative to tamoxifen for young women may be human
chorionic gonadotropin, a hormone produced during pregnancy.
It is sold as a drug by several companies. In tests on rats,
human chorionic gonadotropin produced a pseudopregnancy and
triggered full maturing of the breast glands, Dr. Kiang
notes.

   An epidemic of dangerous pregnancies in which the
fetus develops outside the womb is afflicting expectant mothers,
many of whom have had a common and often symptom-free sexual
infection, researchers say.
   The number of such pregnancies _ called ectopic pregnancies _
increased fourfold from 1970 to 1985, hitting 78,400 women that
year, researchers reported in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   A woman's risk of developing an ectopic pregnancy, which causes
11 percent of maternal deaths, more than doubles if she has had the
bacterial infection chlamydia trachomatis, the researchers said.
   They based their conclusion on tests of 306 women with ectopic
pregnancies and 266 women with normal pregnancies.
   Chlamydia is an epidemic in itself, infecting an estimated 4
million people a year, more than any other sexually transmitted
disease, according to the national Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta.
   An unlooked-for finding of the study was that women who douched
had almost as high a risk of developing ectopic pregnancies as
women who had a history of chlamydial infection, the researchers
said.
   The reasons are unclear, but the findings support previous
studies, said the researchers. They speculated that douching may
propel bacteria from the lower genital tract to the normally
sterile upper genital tract.
   When bacteria invade the upper genital tract, the resulting
infection can scar the Fallopian tubes, blocking the normal path
that eggs travel from the ovaries to the womb.
   That is what often happens in untreated chlamydial infections,
said Julius Schachter, a co-author of the study and a professor of
epidemiology and laboratory medicine at the University of
California, San Francisco.
   ``What is dangerous is that it (chlamydia) can cause an upper
genital tract infection without causing symptoms,'' Schachter said
in a telephone interview.
   ``The first time a woman finds out she's had it is when she has
a bad outcome ... either infertility or ectopic pregnancy.''
   In 97 percent of ectopic pregnancies, the fertilized egg lodges
in the Fallopian tubes, where as the fetus enlarges, it can rupture
the tubes or cause severe bleeding.
   Such pregnancies, though dangerous, can now be detected early
and ended surgically.
   ``You can't prevent this by treating a symptomatic woman because
she's never had symptoms,'' Schachter said. ``What we need is a
chlamydia control program to reduce infection and prevent
complications.''
   Such a program _ involving routine screening of sexually active
young people and treating those found to be infected _ already
exists for gonorrhea, Schachter said.
   That disease infects an estimated 1.5 million people a year and
is another major cause of ectopic pregnancy, says the CDC.
   Starting a control program for chlamydia would cost an estimated
$50 million, he said, citing a CDC figure.
   ``That would be highly cost-effective, because chlamydia costs
billions of dollars in complications,'' said Schachter, who has
previously reported that chlamydia infects up to one in 20 pregnant
women, 60 percent of whom pass it to their newborns, who may get
pneumonia or eye inflammation as a result.
   Schachter and his colleagues also recommended further research
into the practice of douching. Changes in douching habits, if they
reduced ectopic pregnancies, could have a quicker impact than a
chlamydia control program, they said.
   However, Dr. Bruce B. Dan of the American Medical Association
disagreed. He called for caution in blaming douching for ectopic
pregnancy and said physicians ``would do better by telling women at
every opportunity how to protect themselves from acquiring
chlamydial infections.
   ``This strategy would also serve to decrease the incidence of
gonorrhea, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus infection (which
causes AIDS), and hepatitis B infection, something a change in
douching habits is unlikely to do,'' Dan added in an editorial
accompanying the study.
   A related study in Wednesday's Journal found that most of 323
pregnant women with chlamydial infections responded to antibiotic
treatment, and suffered significantly fewer pregnancy problems than
those who didn't respond to treatment.

   Researchers Take Big Step

   Schering-Plough Corp. scientists said that they have taken
a major step toward developing human monoclonal antibodies, a
long-sought goal of the biotechnology industry.
   Human monoclonal antibodies, if they can be developed,
probably would replace many of the mouse monoclonal
antibodies that currently are the foundation of a
fast-growing branch of the biotechnology industry. The human
monoclonal antibodies would be less likely than the existing
mouse antibodies to trigger an immune response in human
patients. Such an immune response often limits the number of
times a patient can be treated with mouse monoclonal
antibodies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Monoclonal antibodies often are called the "magic bullets"
or "`guided missiles" of the medical world. They are
laboratory-made versions of the antibodies that animals and
humans produce to fight off invasions of "foreign" proteins
such as those on viruses. A breakthrough in the mid-1970s has
spawned a dozen or more companies that either produce or are
developing monoclonal antibodies that selectively attack the
proteins on cancer or other diseased cells, blood clots,
bacteria, viruses, hormones and other biological substances.
The antibodies are being used both to treat disease and to
diagnose infections or conditions such as pregnancy.
   In a report appearing in this week's issue of Science,
researchers at Schering-Plough's Laboratory for Immunological
Research in France say they've figured out how to culture or
grow human antibody-producing cells in the test tube. These
are white blood cells known as B cells. Until now, scientists
have been able to culture human B cells in the test tube only
if the cells have been transformed by a virus into cancer
cells. The human B cells being grown in France are completely
normal.
   The French researchers have kept cultures of normal human
B cells going for as long as two months, said Allan Waitz,
head of Dnax Research Institute in Palo Alto, Calif., the
Schering-Plough subsidiary that oversees the French
laboratory.
   The French development is a major advance "although we're
some distance from producing human monoclonals," Mr. Waitz
said.
   The head of a major antibody manufacturer, Centocor Inc.
in Malvern, Pa., agreed. The ability to culture human B cells
"obviously is a very significant contribution although I
would say it adds more to the basic research effort than to
methods of producing monoclonals," Hubert Shoemaker, chairman
and chief executive officer of Centocor, said.
   Both executives explained that the advance may help
overcome a major roadblock to human monoclonal antibodies. To
make monoclonal antibodies, biologists have to undertake
procedures that are permissible in mice but not in humans.
They first have to infect the animal with the protein that
will be the target of the antibodies. Once the animal has
begun developing antibodies against the protein, its spleen
is removed and the antibody-producing B cells removed. These
B-cells are then fused with mouse cancer cells to create a
clone or clump of identical cells that proliferate
indefinitely in the test tube and churn out flasks full of
antibodies that attack the original target protein.
   Scientists can similarly produce human monoclonal
antibodies but only if they can obtain B cells from a human
who happens to be making antibodies against a desired target
protein. The B cells making the desired antibodies can be
fused with human cancer cells to create the long-lived
test-tube clones that produce the antibodies. Centocor, for
instance, is currently awaiting federal clearance to market
such a human monoclonal that attacks and neutralizes a
bacterial toxin that causes blood poisoning.
   The rub is that the researchers can't go around infecting
humans with target proteins in order to get the B cells that
make a desired antibody, Centocor's Mr. Shoemaker explained.
   The Schering-Plough advance may solve this problem,
according to Messrs. Waitz and Shoemaker. The next step, they
said, is for the scientists to learn how to infect the
laboratory-grown human B cells with target proteins so that
they'll churn out antibodies to the proteins.
   Schering-Plough isn't currently in the monoclonal antibody
business but is applying for patents on the advance, Mr.
Waitz said. If granted, the patents would give the company
unusual protection in the monoclonal antibody field since the
methods of culturing mouse B cells in the test tube aren't
covered by patents, he said.

<HEAD>Study Says Diabetic Women Can Avoid Miscarriages</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pregnant women with diabetes can reduce their high
risk of miscarriages by keeping their blood sugar levels under
control, a study shows.
   The study tried to settle a long-running debate over whether
diabetes increases a woman's risk of miscarriage.
   It found that the higher the blood sugar level in diabetic women,
the higher the risk of miscarriage. However, women who keep their
sugar levels in the normal range have no higher risk of this than
women without diabetes.
   ``Diabetic women can be reassured that if they achieve reasonably
good metabolic control during pregnancy,'' the researchers wrote,
``their risk of spontaneous abortion is no higher than that among
non-diabetic women.''
   The study was based on a comparison of 386 pregnant women who
took insulin for diabetes and 432 without diabetes. Overall, 16
percent of the women in both groups had pregnancy losses. However,
blood sugar levels were higher in the diabetic women who had
miscarriages.
   The study was directed by Dr. James L. Mills of the National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development. It was published in
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Donald R. Coustan of Brown
University said counseling diabetic women who want to have babies is
the single most important thing doctors can do to prevent
miscarriages and birth defects.
   ``Diabetic women must be made aware that the time to prevent
birth defects and spontaneous abortion is before conception, and
contraceptive advice should be offered so that every pregnancy can
be planned in advance,'' he wrote. ``Rarely do we encounter such a
simple and compelling opportunity to prevent human suffering.''

<TEXT>
   A vaccine that makes the body attack sperm was
100 percent effective in tests with female and male guinea pigs,
the first demonstration of contraception without fail from a
vaccine, scientists reported today.
   The study, which also found the effects of the vaccination
temporary, raises the prospect that a similar vaccine might work in
women and men.
   But ``there are many things about it that would have to be
changed or improved to make it a useful method for either
agricultural animals or humans,'' said researcher Paul Primakoff.
   The vaccine is designed to prevent fertilization, which may make
it more widely acceptable than another vaccine already in human
testing that stops development of the embryo, other scientists said.
   Primakoff and colleagues at the University of Connecticut Health
Center in Farmington, Conn., reported the experiment in the British
journal Nature.
   None of the 25 female guinea pigs that were vaccinated before
mating had litters, nor did the mates of the six immunized male
guinea pigs. Animals that received sham immunizations for
comparison purposes remained fertile.
   Eleven of 24 females tested had regained fertility by nine to 11
months after the immunization, and all four of the longest-studied
group had delivered litters by 15 months. Among males, four of six
had regained fertility by seven months after the immunization.
   In a telephone interview, Primakoff said his team has since
produced contraception in 17 other male guinea pigs.
   The vaccine is designed to make the body's disease-fighting
immune system attack a protein found in guinea pig sperm. The
details of just how that blocks fertility in guinea pigs are not
known, Primakoff said.
   But immune system proteins called antibodies, taken from the
immunized females, prevented sperm from binding normally to guinea
pig eggs in the test tube. That suggests the vaccine blocks
fertilization within vaccinated females, Primakoff said.
   In males, the vaccination triggered an invasion of the testicle
by immune system cells. That is ``not something you would want
going on in your body'' because of the potential for long-term
harm, Primakoff said.
   So to produce a human male vaccine, researchers would have to
find a way to trigger just the antibodies without the rest of an
immune system reaction, he said.
   No evidence indicates the guinea pig vaccine would work in
humans, nor is there any assurance that human sperm contains a
suitable protein target for a similar vaccine, he said.
   Richard Bronson, director of the reproductive endocrinology
division at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, called
the research ``very encouraging.''
   It suggests research into a sperm-targeting vaccine is ``heading
in the right direction,'' he said.
   The 100 percent contraception rate makes the results ``really
terrific,'' said Nancy Alexander, director of applied fundamental
research for the Contraceptive Research and Development Program at
the Jones Institute of Reproductive Medicine in Norfolk, Va.
   A vaccine that prevents fertilization might avoid religious and
cultural implications of another kind of vaccine that has already
begun preliminary human testing, she said.
   That vaccine blocks the action of a hormone called human
chorionic gonadotropin. Scientists are unsure whether the blocking
prevents the blastocyst, a clump of cells that grows from a
fertilized egg, from implanting itself in the uterus wall, or
whether it prevents further development soon after implantion.
   Implantation normally takes place six or seven days after the
egg is fertilized.
   Researchers overseas have shown the hormone-blocking vaccine is
safe in humans and are preparing to start testing its
effectiveness, Alexander said.

<HEAD>Study Finds One-Third of Pregnancies End in Miscarriage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new test reveals that most miscarriages happen
during the first month of pregnancy, long before women even realize
that conception has occurred.
   ``We can say that the majority of early pregnancy loss appears
to be unrecognized,'' said Dr. Allen J. Wilcox, who directed the
study.
   His work suggests that 22 percent of all pregnancies end
spontaneously in the first month, before women know they are
pregnant. Another 9 percent result in miscarriages after the
pregnancy becomes apparent.
   The study confirmed what many scientists have long suspected:
The female body discards a large portion of its fetuses in the
first month or so after conception.
   Wilcox said the body probably rejects fetuses because they are
defective. When researchers study later miscarriages in which fetal
tissue is recovered, they find that half show gross genetic
abnormalities.
   ``It's reasonable to speculate that the same would be true in
these very early losses,'' Wilcox said.
   The study found that 31 percent of all pregnancies ended before
birth, but the true rate of miscarriage is probably even higher,
since the test missed miscarriages during the first week after
conception.
   An editorial published with the study in the Thursday issue of
the New England Journal of Medicine speculates that half of all
pregnancies may end in miscarriage.
   Wilcox, a researcher at the National Institute of Environmental
Health Sciences in Research Triangle Park, N.C., based his findings
on a newly available test that spots a pregnancy hormone.
   The study was conducted on 221 healthy young women who had
decided to stop using birth control and get pregnant. The
researchers collected urine and checked it for traces of human
chorionic gonadotropin, a hormone produced by the fetus.
   This substance shows up in a woman's urine when the fetus
attaches itself to the wall of her uterus, usually about a week
after conception.
   Wilcox noted that many physicians tell women to resume birth
control and ``let their uteruses rest'' for a few months after a
miscarriage. But he said this may not be necessary, at least after
very early pregnancy losses.
   Wilcox said the miscarriages did not mean that a woman could not
have children, and almost all of those who had unrecognized
miscarriages were able to get pregnant again within two years.
   Dr. A. Brian Little of Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal, who
wrote the editorial, said in an interview that ``there are many
exciting things'' about the study.
   He said the test, which is not yet commercially available, may
allow doctors to pinpoint more accurately the causes of
infertility. For instance, if the test shows that infertile women
are having early miscarriages, it will help rule out several
possible reasons for their problems.
   Little said the test should also help doctors check on the
progress of test tube, or in vitro, fertilizations.

   WASHINGTON -- The multivitamin supplements that many women
take during pregnancy aren't generally necessary, because
proper diets can provide most of the nutrients expectant
mothers need, an Institute of Medicine study concluded.
   A lengthy study by medical and nutritional experts found
that "iron is the only known nutrient for which requirements
cannot be met reasonably by diet alone." It recommends
low-dose iron supplements during pregnancy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, the study takes a more relaxed view of weight
gain during pregnancy, saying that increases in the range of
25 to 35 pounds are appropriate for women of normal
prepregnancy weight. The new range is an increase from the 20
to 25 pounds suggested 20 years ago.
   These recommendations, which are in line with existing
standards, aren't likely to have much impact on current
practices. Taking multivitamin supplements, which include
iron, during pregnancy "is a deeply ingrained custom; it's
generally regarded, particularly by patients, as something
that you do," said Roy Pitkin, the chairman of the medical
school and the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the
University of California, Los Angeles. Dr. Pitkin headed the
study for the Institute of Medicine, which is affiliated with
the National Academy of Sciences.
   However, Dr. Pitkin suggested that part of the Institute's
report, entitled "Nutrition During Pregnancy," could moderate
growing interest in the so-called periconceptional use of
vitamin supplements -- their use in a span of several months
immediately before and after conception. Several recent
studies have reported the periconceptional use of vitamin
supplements containing folate, or folic acid, may provide
some protection against neural tube defects, which can cause
such birth defects as spina bifida. But the study concluded
that there isn't enough evidence to support a recommendation
for periconceptional use of vitamins.
   The vitamin industry promptly attacked the panel's
finding. J.B. Cordaro, president of an industry group called
the Council for Responsible Nutrition, said, "This
outrageously anti-health report potentially dooms thousands
of children to an early death or at best substantial
disability due to serious birth defects." The Council said
there is "growing evidence that women who take multivitamins
containing folic acid as part of their normal life style have
a signficantly lower risk" of having babies with neural tube
defects.
   The panel recommended further research on the connection
between multivitamins containing folate and neural tube
disease. In the meantime, it suggested that women of
childbearing age increase their consumption of fruits,
vegetables, legumes and whole-grain breads and cereals, all
good sources of folate.
   The study, which was sponsored by the maternal and child
health bureau of the Department of Health and Human Services,
recommends that women of normal prepregnancy weight who are
carrying single fetuses aim for a weight gain of about one
pound a week during the second and third trimesters.
   Its recommendation is somewhat higher than the 22 to 27
pound range suggested by the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, but it's in line with the
weight-gain many physicians feel comfortable with, Dr. Pitkin
said. Over the last few decades, physicians have become more
relaxed about weight gain during pregnancy. In general,
larger weight gain reduces the number of low birth-weight
babies, but it also can make it more difficult for mothers to
lose weight after pregnancy, the report warned.
   The report notes that women of less than normal weight
should gain in the range of 28 to 40 pounds.
   Although the report recommends against the use of
multivitamin supplements for most women, it says that
high-risk groups -- women who are malnourished or carrying
more than one baby, along with smokers and drug and alcohol
abusers -- should take supplements.
   The college agrees multivitamin supplements aren't
necessary for healthy women on well-balanced diets. However,
unlike the institute, the group recommends supplements of
folic acid, as well as iron.
   Leading multivitamin supplements for pregnant women are:
Materna from the Lederle Laboratories division of American
Cyanamid Co.; Natalins from the Mead Johnson division of
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.; and Stuartnatal and Stuart Prenatal
from Stuart Pharmaceuticals, a division of ICI Americas Inc.
ICI is a subsidiary of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC.
   Kate Ruddon, an official of the college, agreed that
another finding that multivitamin supplements aren't
necessary won't change use patterns. "Our recommendations
have been around for a long time, and most fellows of the
college know what they are and most still recommend a
multivitamin supplement," she explained.

   Researchers discovered the gene responsible for the illness
often mistakenly called elephant man's disease but known correctly
as neurofibromatosis. They then made the surprising finding that
the gene was a genetic cancer switch, suggesting that
neurofibromatosis was related to cancer.
   The tumors associated with neurofibromatosis may be a kind of
halfway point between normal tissue and cancer tissue. The finding
promises to speed research toward both a cure for neurofibromatosis
and an understanding and possible new treatments for cancers of the
brain and nervous system, scientists said.

   Doctors reported a new method of test-tube fertilization can
produce pregnancy in menopausal women. The technique involves
removing eggs from healthy donors, fertilizing them in a lab dish
and implanting them in the womb.
   ``The limits on childbearing years are now anyone's guess,'' the
New England Journal of Medicine editorialized. ``Perhaps they will
have more to do with the stamina required for labor and 2 a.m.

cancer in its normal form but allowing cancer to grow when it is
defective. The study is an important step toward ultimately using
the exploding knowledge of cancer genetics to devise new

infirmities of old age, such as failing eyes and dying brain cells.
But scientists said it may be as close to the fountain of youth as

Birth control research moves slowly, but it is moving, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
Among the technologies working their way through the investigational pipeline
are:
</P>
<P>
Norplant: An implantable contraceptive that inhibits ovulation and also
thickens cervical mucous, impeding sperm penetration. Six match-size silastic
capsules are implanted in the upper arm and release the ovulation-inhibiting
hormone levonorgestrel over a period of five years.
</P>
<P>
The Population Council, the New York-based nonprofit organization that
developed Norplant, filed for FDA marketing approval last August, but has not
yet received it, spokeswoman Sandra Waldman said.
</P>
<P>
A potential drawback: A change in bleeding, including prolonged menstruation or
"breakthrough" bleeding, said Dr. Donna Shoupe, a USC assistant professor of
obstetrics and gynecology who's studied Norplant.
</P>
<P>
 Expected effectiveness: 97%-99%.
</P>
<P>
 RU-486: Perhaps the most controversial technique under study in the United
States, RU-486 is manufacturer's shorthand for a drug that interrupts pregnancy
in early stages. In France, it was withdrawn from the market in October, 1988,
after a campaign by pro-life advocates. Two days later, however, the government
ordered the drug back on the market.
</P>
<P>
A so-called anti-progestin, RU-486 works by "blocking the effects of
progesterone, the hormone that supports pregnancy," said Dr. David A. Grimes, a
professor of obstetrics/gynecology and preventive medicine who's studying the
drug at USC. In the absence of progesterone, the lining of the uterus breaks
down as it would in a normal menstrual cycle.
</P>
<P>
In the last four years, 13 different regimens have been tested on 300 women in
USC studies, Grimes said. Most promising: a single 600-milligram dose that
interrupted pregnancy 90% of the time in 50 women studied.
</P>
<P>
Taken within two weeks of a missed menstrual period, the drug is 80% effective,
according to a new report by Washington's nonprofit Population Crisis
Committee, and even more so when combined with synthetic prostaglandins.
Possible side effects include hemorrhage and incomplete or failed abortion.
</P>
<P>
 Expected effectiveness: 95%.
</P>
<P>
 Nonscalpel Vasectomy: Under study by the Population Council and VasTech
Medical Products Inc., of New Brunswick, N.J., nonscalpel vasectomy promises
almost immediate recovery. After a local anesthetic is administered, scrotal
skin is punctured with a Vasocclude, a device much like a stapler with
preloaded clips, and the device is maneuvered near the vas deferens or
spermatic duct, which is sealed off by a clip.
</P>
<P>
Clinical studies are scheduled to start this year.
</P>
<P>
 Expected effectiveness: 99%.
</P>
<P>
 Plug Sterilization: In this potentially reversible male sterilization
procedure, two tiny puncture holes are made in each vas deferens, then two
silicone plugs are inserted into the ducts. A tiny space between the two acts
as a trap for sperm that may have gotten past the first plug.
</P>
<P>
"The vas is hardly damaged," said Dr. Lourens Zaneveld , a professor of
obstetrics and gynecology at Chicago's Rush University. "When the plugs are
removed, a small suture recloses the duct and the hole closes almost
immediately."
</P>
<P>
Preliminary clinical studies, under way here and in South America, showed a
third of the men were sterile but in two-thirds, some sperm still passed by the
plugs.
</P>
<P>
 Expected effectiveness: 99% as contraceptive; 90% reversibility.
</P>
<P>
 Anti-Sperm Vaccine: Human studies are expected to begin this year or next for
a vaccine that attacks sperm and reduces their "fertilizability," said
Northwestern researcher Dr. Gerald Zatuchni , a professor of obstetrics and
gynecology at Northwestern University in Chicago, Ill. First, an enzyme called
lactic dehydrogenase is extracted from the sperm and injected into his partner.
She, in turn, develops antibodies that attack the sperm, reducing motility and
ability to fertilize eggs.
</P>
<P>
 Expected effectiveness: 90%.
</P>
<P>
 Injectables for Women: A biodegradable microcapsule of norethindrone, the same
synthetic hormone found in most oral contraceptives, is injected into the
buttocks, allowing for slow release of the hormone. Farthest along in clinical
trials is a 90-day capsule; 30-day and 6-month systems are also being
developed, said Zatuchni.
</P>
<P>
 Expected effectiveness: 99%.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Injectables for Men: Periodic injections of a synthetic version of the hormone
testosterone may reduce sperm counts to zero or other safe levels, researchers
say. Testosterone inhibits sperm production much like oral contraceptives
inhibit ovulation, said Dr. C. Alvin Paulsen, a researcher and professor at the
University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
Other researchers, including Dr. Ronald S. Swerdloff, director of the UCLA
Population Research Center and professor of medicine at Harbor-UCLA Medical
Center in Torrance, are studying injections of testosterone combined with other
substances that together "turn off" the sperm production system.
</P>
<P>
 Expected effectiveness: Unknown.
</P>
<P>
 Female Condoms: "When people first look at a female condom, they're not too
impressed," said USC's Shoupe, one of several researchers investigating various
types of female condoms, also called intravaginal pouches. The one she's
studying looks like a plastic tube with a ring at each end. The upper ring is
inserted like a diaphragm to prevent sperm passage while the other is
positioned near the vaginal opening. Prelubricated with the spermicide
nonoxynol-9, such condoms may help prevent the spread of sexually transmitted
diseases, researchers say.

<HEAD>Women Get Pregnant After Menopause with Test-Tube Fertilization</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The latest medical technology lets women turn back
their biological clocks and get pregnant after menopause, but also
raises questions about how old is too old for child rearing.
   Doctors say they can extend women's baby-making years well into
their 40s, 50s and perhaps 60s, providing a second chance for those
who waited too long to start families. However, some doctors have
doubts about the wisdom of childbearing for those who are well past
nature's own cutoff.
   ``Because we can do something technically does not mean we
should do it indiscriminately,'' said Dr. Zev Rosenwaks. ``The
ability to become pregnant is a physical sign of what nature itself
expects of a woman. You cannot push nature past the point where you
interfere with safety.''
   Rosenwaks is head of the fertility clinic at New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, one of several hospitals around
the country that has begun using the new technology.
   The process, described in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, is a variation on the now-routine process of in vitro
fertilization, conception in the lab dish. Ordinarily, doctors
remove eggs from an infertile woman's ovaries, mix them with sperm
and then put the embryos into her womb.
   However, this is not possible if the woman's ovaries have
stopped working, the change of life known as menopause. Until
recently, that was the end of the reproductive line for women.
   But now, doctors are removing eggs from healthy young donors and
implanting them in older women after they have been fertilized with
sperm. Because the mother does not provide the egg, she is not the
genetic parent of her baby, but still undergoes a normal pregnancy
and delivery.
   The major limits to the technique are the health of the mother
and the cost - $8,000 for each attempt plus a $1,500 payment to the
egg donor.
   In the journal, Dr. Mark V. Sauer of the University of Southern
California described the use of the technique on seven women over
40 whose ``ovaries didn't last as long as their desire to have
babies.''
   Menopause usually occurs around age 50, but in about 10 percent
of women the ovaries stop working by age 40. Sometimes these women
have delayed having children, often while they establish their
careers.
   ``Many women are coming in 40 years of age or older. They have
an air of desperation. It's their last chance,'' said Dr. Anne
Wentz, who has a ``geriatric infertility'' practice at Northwestern
University.
   Pregnancy is riskier for older women than young ones. They are
more likely to have high blood pressure, premature labor and
bleeding. Wentz and others noted that there is simply no way to
know the effects of carrying and delivering a child on a women in
her 50s and beyond.
   ``We don't have any data on that. It opens up a Pandora's box,''
said Dr. Steven Bayer of New England Medical Center.
   Others noted that older women should carefully think about
whether they have the stamina to deal with 2 a.m. feedings and
other rigors of bringing up babies.
   ``There is concern about progressively older individuals trying
to provide parenting for an infant and a child as it grows up,''
said Dr. Machelle Seibel of Faulkner Hospital in Boston. ``I have
no right to say what is the right age, but at some point there has
to be limits to what age is appropriate.''
   Dr. Kamren Moghissi of Wayne State University added, ``Some of
them won't live to see their kids get married or even graduate from
college. The natural lifespan for women is around 80 years, but
some women die at age 60 or 65. These women obviously won't see
their children grow up.''
   While the image of the ticking biological clock became a
familiar one for young professional women in the last decade, there
is some evidence of a reversal in the popularity of postponement of
childbearing for a career.
   A Time magazine poll of 505 Americans ages 18-24 taken last
month by Yankelovich Clancy Shulman found 51 percent put having a
long and happy marriage and raising well-adjusted children ahead of
career success.

   Federal health officials recommended that all
pregnant women be tested for hepatitis and that newborns of
infected women be vaccinated, to prevent 3,500 babies a year from
becoming potentially doomed hepatitis carriers.
   ``It is now evident that routine screening of all pregnant women
is the only strategy that will provide acceptable control'' of
mother-to-child hepatitis B transmission, the Centers for Disease
Control said.
   Each year in the United States, about 16,500 babies are born to
mothers with hepatitis B infections. About 3,500 of those infants
become chronic hepatitis B carriers, and it is estimated that more
than 25 percent of them will die of liver cancer or cirrhosis.

   An experimental birth control vaccine shows
promise for blocking pregnancy for six months without significant
side effects, a preliminary study suggests.
   The vaccine spurred the immune systems of women volunteers into
making proteins, called antibodies, that block the action of a
hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin, which is produced
during pregnancy.
   The vaccine's effectiveness could not be tested directly because
the women had been surgically sterilized. But animal studies had
shown that an antibody attack on the hormone could halt a pregnancy
at an early stage, researchers wrote.
   The study is described in Saturday's issue of The Lancet, a

<HL> Technology -- Health: Latest Study On VDTs Adds To Safety Fears </HL>
<AUTHOR> Bill Paul (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<IN> EDP </IN>
<TEXT>
   A mouse experiment in Sweden is likely to add more fuel to the debate over the safety of video display terminals, particularly for pregnant women.

   The experiment at Sweden's University of Agricultural Sciences found that pregnant mice exposed to magnetic pulses suffered twice the incidence of early fetal deaths as unexposed mice.
The findings lend support to the results of an earlier study.
How relevant the experiment is to human exposure is unclear since the magnetic fields used in the experiment were several times stronger than those surrounding the video terminals used for computers.

   But the mouse experiment comes on top of several other similar laboratory experiments as well as a controversial epidemiological study indicating that miscarriage rates are higher than normal among women who work with VDTs.

   Irving Selikoff of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York says the Swedish mice studies provide a "good index of suspicion" that there is a problem but added that translating animal observations to humans is difficult, and thus human research is needed.

   The results of the new mouse experiment haven't been formally reported in a scientific journal.
But they are being publicized by Microwave News, a New York newsletter devoted to reporting health and safety issues surrounding VDTs and other electrical and electronic equipment.

   Hakon Froelen, the Swedish scientist who carried out the experiment, has previously reported an earlier mouse experiment that produced similar results.
He confirmed the Microwave News report.

   Another Swedish study, at the Karolinska Institute in 1986, found that pregnant mice exposed to VDT-type magnetic pulses experienced a significantly higher rate of malformed offspring.
Also, a recent study coordinated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, found that VDT-type magnetic pulses caused abnormalities in chicken embryos.

   Some 15 million VDT terminals are in use in the U.S., the Council on Scientific Affairs estimated last year, with about three million added each year.
Of the 10 million or so Americans who use a terminal much of the day, about half are said to be women of child-bearing age.

   Much of the concern over the safety of video terminals stems from a recent, widely publicized epidemiological study by the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program in Oakland, Calif.
It found that female clerical workers who use VDTs more than 20 hours a week had more than twice as many miscarriages as women who didn't work with VDTs.
The Kaiser study wasn't designed to determine why the miscarriage rate rose.

   VDT makers maintain that their terminals are safe, and even the one manufacturer sponsoring research on whether VDT radiation poses a health risk, International Business Machines Corp., says it's doing so only to "help settle the public debate," according to a spokeswoman.
IBM declined to comment on the most recent mice study because it hasn't seen the report yet.

   Dr. Selikoff is part of a group of Mount Sinai doctors who have so far been unable to obtain funding from the federal National Institutes of Health for a proposed $3 million study on the effects of VDT radiation on pregnant women.
Such a study, Dr. Selikoff contends, "should have been done 10 years ago.
He adds: "If, in the future, we're going to expose tens of millions of people to VDTs, we'd better find out now" if they pose a serious health problem.

   A woman who suffered several failed pregnancies
had eggs from her ovaries removed and fertilized in vitro, then
frozen, enabling her to have fraternal ``triplets'' born 21 months
apart.
   Jane Mohr of Manhattan Beach, Calif., said in the August issue of
Redbook that she had several ectopic pregnancies that resulted in
the rupture of her Fallopian tubes or required surgery to remove the
fetus. An ectopic pregnancy is when the fetus implants itself in the
tube, rather than the womb.
   On June 26, 1986, Mohr had 10 eggs removed for fertilization with
her husband's sperm after she was given a combination of hormones
called Pergonal to stimulate her ovaries' production of eggs.
   Dr. David R. Meldrum, an in vitro fertilization specialist at
University of California-Los Angeles Medical Center, implanted four
fertilized eggs in Mohr's uterus. On Feb. 15, 1987, she gave birth
to a baby boy after a Caesarean operation.
   In March 1988, Mohr was implanted for the second time with three
embryos from the 1986 fertilization. On Nov. 29, Mohr had two
daughters delivered by Caesarean section.
   The three children developed from separate eggs fertilized by
individual sperm; in scientific terms, they are simply fraternal
siblings _ brother and sisters.
   The process of twinning, which causes multiple births, is the
division of a single, fertilized egg to form two, or three, or more
complete organisms.

Rhonda Gale took a red-eye flight from Los Angeles to Chicago one day in early
1989, arriving in Chicago just as the sun was rising. Carrying a cooler
containing vials of her husband's blood, Gale climbed into a limousine and was
driven to the University of Chicago Medical School.
</P>
<P>
Medical staff there took the blood from Gale and, several hours later, injected
a mixture containing Philip Klein's white blood cells under the skin on Gale's
arm. She flew home the same day.
</P>
<P>
After several months and a second trip to Chicago, Gale and Klein were on their
way to achieving a long-held dream: Gale soon became pregnant. And after three
previous miscarriages, this pregnancy resulted in the birth of twin girls.
</P>
<P>
Gale and Klein are among a growing number of couples seeking a new and
controversial treatment for repeated miscarriage. Called paternal leukocyte
immunization, the treatment involves transferring immune-boosting white blood
cells from the potential father to the potential mother before conception in
order to improve the chances that the mother's body won't reject the fetus.
</P>
<P>
Candidates for the treatment are couples who have had three or more unexplained
miscarriages early in the pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
While the treatment is still under investigation, it offers some hope in an
area of obstetrics that has been one of the last to benefit from a wide range
of new reproductive technologies.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have realized astounding success in the last decade in the treatment
of infertility. Through advances in surgery, hormone therapy, in vitro
fertilization, donation of eggs and sperm and surrogacy, the process of getting
people pregnant now holds many options.
</P>
<P>
But staying pregnant can present another problem. When the cause of miscarriage
is known, treatment is often available to improve the chance of a successful
pregnancy. But for unexplained miscarriage, physicians traditionally could only
tell couples to keep trying or consider artificial insemination with donor
sperm.
</P>
<P>
"Recurrent pregnancy loss is something of an orphan among medical specialties,"
says Dr. Pamela J. Boyer, who is studying the paternal leukocyte immunization
at UCLA School of Medicine. "There aren't a lot of options (for treatment), and
there aren't a lot of people interested in it. There hasn't been a good place
for patients to go."
</P>
<P>
Beyond the issue of treatment, the emotional aftermath of miscarriage and its
effect on couples who desperately want children has been ignored by the medical
profession, says Susan Speraw, a registered nurse and doctoral candidate who is
studying the subject for her thesis at the California School of Professional
Psychology.
</P>
<P>
"There really is no literature on the psychological aspects of miscarriage.
It's like a nonentity," she says. "I think the general concept is that because
the pregnancy is lost so early it doesn't have much meaning to the couple."
</P>
<P>
Speraw's ongoing study of couples who have experienced early miscarriages shows
most feel a loss -- "even if it's just a loss of hopes and dreams."
</P>
<P>
In recent years researchers have learned that miscarriage is exceedingly
common. Most pregnancies spontaneously end within the first 28 days, before a
woman usually knows she's pregnant. Of pregnancies that are confirmed by a
physician, another 15% to 25% end in miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
About half of those miscarriages are due to genetic defects of the fetus or
structural problems that prevent the mother from carrying the fetus, such as a
weakened uterus or cervix or hormonal problems.
</P>
<P>
Another large group of couples -- several thousand, according to fertility
experts -- experience repeated miscarriages for unknown reasons.
</P>
<P>
Despite the important advance that paternal leukocyte immunization might
represent, some fertility experts are concerned that couples are seeking the
treatment before studies have shown that it actually works or why it works.
</P>
<P>
"It's at a semi-experimental status," says Dr. Susan Cowchock, a researcher at
Jefferson Medical Center in Philadelphia who has been using the technique for
about five years. "There is plenty of evidence that it's helpful, but I don't
think anyone would feel it's standardized treatment yet."
</P>
<P>
Several thousand couples worldwide -- many in England -- have undergone the
therapy. But only a few small, controlled studies have compared the success of
couples treated with paternal leukocyte immunization to untreated couples, says
Dr. D. Ware Branch, an assistant professor at the University of Utah.
</P>
<P>
At Utah, physicians are attempting to conduct a large, controlled, double-blind
study but are having trouble attracting couples to the study because the
couples fear they might be assigned to the untreated control group.
</P>
<P>
Yet Branch says the study is necessary because evidence is lacking that the
treatment works.
</P>
<P>
"I think we don't really know if it works," he says. "Physicians over the years
have felt confident about things that haven't panned out. I think (the
interest) is well- intentioned, but circumstantial evidence often doesn't hold
up to closer scrutiny."
</P>
<P>
The treatment was first suggested in 1981 in research published by a British
physician, W.P. Faulk, and Chicago physician Alan Beer, who treated Gale.
</P>
<P>
Both physicians were interested in studies that show immunological factors play
an important role in establishing a successful pregnancy. And researchers say
the studies related to paternal leukocyte immunization could illuminate basic
mysteries of the immune system.
</P>
<P>
Normally, the human body rejects foreign material. Organ transplants, for
example, are rejected unless the patient receives special, potent drugs to
prevent the body from recognizing the organ as foreign tissue.
</P>
<P>
Since a fetus has half its genetic material from its father, a woman's body --
theoretically -- should react to the fetus as foreign material.
</P>
<P>
Because that usually doesn't happen, pregnancy has long been a source of
wonderment to biologists. Years of studies have suggested that the mother's
body secretes protective antibodies in response to the fetus that keeps the
fetus from being rejected by her immune system. Changes in the mother's immune
response during pregnancy have been detected, but experts disagree on which of
these might be the protective factors.
</P>
<P>
"Somehow this baby that is half the father sits there and grows," Boyer says.
"I've always been fascinated by that process."
</P>
<P>
Because of this paradox, some experts suggest that couples with repeated,
unexplained miscarriages have similar immune system characteristics that
somehow interfere with the normal protective mechanism. If the father and
mother share similar immune system characteristics, "the baby, ironically, is
not different enough so the mother doesn't recognize it enough to lay down the
protective layer," says David Hill, laboratory director at the Center for
Reproductive Medicine at Century City Hospital, whose program is an adjunct to
Beer's popular program in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
"This condition can be tested for by taking blood from the husband and the wife
to see if this type of sharing phenomenon occurs," Hill says.
</P>
<P>
Receiving an injection of the potential father's blood -- in effect, an
immunization -- causes numerous responses in the woman's body, not all of which
are understood, Boyer says. But when the "immunized" woman becomes pregnant,
her body apparently recognizes the genetic material and responds appropriately
to protect the baby.
</P>
<P>
"Her body has learned from the immunization to recognize her husband's cells
and respond appropriately," Boyer says. "But no one seems to know how it
actually works."
</P>
<P>
Cowchock says the explanation is not that simple.
</P>
<P>
"(The treatment) may have nothing to do with interaction between the husband
and wife," she says. "No one knows why it might be helpful. It might be helpful
in a mild way."
</P>
<P>
While similar genetic material between the mother and father might be part of
the problem, something else is probably going wrong in the mother's ability to
recognize the fetus, Boyer says.
</P>
<P>
"The going theory now seems to be that's it's a recognition problem," she says.
"(The fetus) has to be recognized and there has to be a response."
</P>
<P>
Despite the mystery of how it works, Cowchock and other researchers say their
studies show that couples who undergo the treatment have a 75% to 80% chance of
carrying their next pregnancy to term.
</P>
<P>
But statistics show that women who have had three miscarriages have a 30% to
40% chance of carrying the next pregnancy to term without any treatment. So
it's impossible to know if the treatment helped couples or if they would have
been successful anyway, Boyer says.
</P>
<P>
"Thirty to 40% are going to be successful anyway," Boyer says.
</P>
<P>
But a growing number of patients are true believers.
</P>
<P>
Gale and Klein began trying to conceive in 1986. Because Gale had
endometriosis, a condition of abnormal tissue growth outside the uterus, the
couple underwent a procedure called gamete intra-Fallopian transfer, or GIFT,
in late 1987. GIFT involves placing a mixture of eggs and sperm in the
Fallopian tube.
</P>
<P>
Gale, an attorney, got pregnant three times with GIFT but miscarried all three
times.
</P>
<P>
After the third miscarriage, Gale made an appointment with an adoption lawyer.
</P>
<P>
"I'd had enough," she said. "I had been tested for everything. I knew something
was the matter, but no one could figure out what it was."
</P>
<P>
But while pursuing adoption, Gale and Klein heard about paternal leukocyte
immunization. They shipped blood samples to Beer and were informed that the
treatment might help them. Blood types do not matter except where the mother
has an Rh negative blood type while the father is Rh positive, which could lead
to complications.
</P>
<P>
Gale traveled to Chicago twice for transfusions. She became pregnant a few
months later through a GIFT procedure. Early in the pregnancy, Gale received
another boost of her husband's blood. The twins, Allison and Juliana, were born
Feb. 11.
</P>
<P>
Gale says some doctors familiar with the couple's history have told her they
doubt that the treatment was responsible for the successful pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
But, she says, "I really believe that without this treatment my kids would not
be born. I don't really think you can dispute it."
</P>
<P>
Depending on the amount of laboratory tests needed, the treatment ranges from
several hundred dollars to $2,000, experts and patients say.
</P>
<P>
Some insurers vary in their decision to cover the cost of the treatment. But
those who call the American Fertility Society in Birmingham, Ala., an umbrella
organization for fertility treatment centers, are told that the treatment is
still under investigation, says spokeswoman Joyce Zeitz. "We have to tell them
it's purely experimental," she says.
</P>
<P>
The completion of the double-blind study at Utah could help resolve many
questions about the treatment. Utah officials are offering couples free
treatment to enter the study. Couples who are assigned to the control group and
don't achieve a full-term pregnancy will be offered paternal leukocyte
immunization later at no charge, Branch says.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, research on why the treatment works could yield significant
information.
</P>
<P>
According to Hill, researchers are intrigued by the possibility that the
treatment might improve the odds for couples who have no success at in vitro
fertilization or GIFT.
</P>
<P>
An immune problem might also be a factor for couples with unexplained
infertility -- about 10% of all couples who cannot achieve pregnancy.
</P>

"We don't know whether or not this thing can be extrapolated to the in vitro
fertilization experience. But there is some evidence that this is so," Hill
says.

UCLA is also performing research on key immunological aspects of the treatment
that might be beneficial in organ transplantation, Boyer says.
</P>
<P>
But even a modest reduction in miscarriage rates is significant, Boyer says.
Women who miscarry often feel at fault because so little is known about the
causes of miscarriage. In the past, some women have been told by doctors that
they have a psychological aversion to pregnancy, she says.

"It used to be something people covered up," she says. "The standard
(treatment) was to tell people to try again. It has really been in the last
five years that this has changed. This is a legitimate medical problem. This
isn't something you should suffer with and bury. You should get help."

PATERNAL LEUKOCYTE IMMUNIZATION
</P>
<P>
Several thousand couples who desire to become parents experience repeated
miscarriages for unknown reasons. Some medical experts now suspect that the
woman's body is failing to recognize the genetic material of the fetus and
rejecting the fetus.
</P>
<P>
How paternal leukocyte immunization works:
</P>
<P>
1. The couple have blood tests to identify the similar characteristics of their
immune systems.
</P>
<P>
2. The husband's blood sample is processed to remove the white blood cells, key
immune-system cells.
</P>
<P>
3. The husband's white blood cells are transfused to the wife, triggering her
body to produce antibodies and other immune responses crucial to recognizing
and protecting a fetus that is half the father's genetic material.
</P>
<P>
4. After the woman conceives, signals are released from a layer of tissue
surrounding the fetus -- the trophoblast -- alerting the woman's body to
produce protective cells and antibodies, protecting the fetus from rejection.
</P>
<P>
According to the theory, the woman's body has learned from the transfusion to
recognize her husband's genetic material.

<HEAD>Study: Balloon Technique Opens Blocked Tubes in Infertile Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new device that opens blocked fallopian tubes
with a tiny balloon can offer a simpler and cheaper method for
helping infertile women become pregnant, doctors reported today.
   However, the technique is designed for a particular type of
blockage, present mong only 10 percent of the estimated 1 million
American women who have blocked fallopian tubes.
   The procedure, which requires neither surgery nor general
anesthesia, is similar to the use of balloons to open the clogged
arteries of heart patients, according to the report in today's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
   The balloon is mounted on a flexible tube called a catheter and
threaded through the womb into one of the fallopian tubes, which
connect the uterus to the ovaries. Once the balloon is in place,
doctors inflate it to open the passage.
   Dr. Edmond Confino, the study's lead author and director of
education in obstetrics and gynecology at Mount Sinai Hospital
Medical Center in Chicago, said the procedure could reduce by
two-thirds the cost of treating women with blockages, who now
usually choose between microsurgery or test-tube fertilization.
   The procedure is expected to cost a third as much as test-tube
fertilization, which totals about $6,000, succeeds about 20 percent
of the time and results in only a single pregnancy. Microsurgery,
in which the patient's abdomen is opened, typically costs up to
$10,000, Confino said.
   A surgeon not involved in the study said he believes the
technique offers no significant advantages over still another
method, simple catheterization. Simple catheterization uses the
flexible tube itself to clear the blockage.
   ``I'm not against the technique, it's just another variation,''
said Dr. Rafael Valle, associate professor of obstetrics and
gynecology at Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago.
   Confino said the balloon device is superior to regular
catheterization because it causes far fewer puncture wounds and
provides longer-lasting results.
   The device is designed to treat proximal tubal occlusion, or
blockage of a tube near the point where it enters the uterus.
   It isn't designed to treat the much more common distal tubal
occlusion, which is blockage farther up the tubes where they pick
up the egg from the ovary. This type afflicts 90 percent of the
women with blocked fallopian tubes.
   The balloon procedure, called transcervical balloon tuboplasty,
is awaiting Food and Drug Administration approval. In tests, the
procedure opened one or both tubes in about 135 of 150 women, and
about 45 conceived, Confino said.
   Confino said the study covered the first 77 subjects, all of
whom had proximal blockage. Seventy-one of them had one or both
tubes cleared. Six couldn't be cleared.
   In 13 of the 77, after doctors cleared the proximal blockage,
they found distal blockage that could not be cleared, the report
said. Among the remaining 64 subjects, 22 became pregnant within a
year, it said.
   Seventeen had normal deliveries. Five miscarried. One patient
had a pregnancy that developed outside the womb and had to be
ended.
   In two cases of the 77, the tuboplasty procedure punched a
pinpoint hole in the wall of the fallopian tube, but no
complications resulted, the researchers said.

<TEXT>
   The French drug RU 486 blocks pregnancy after
conception by interfering with a hormone that is essential to the
maintenance of pregnancy.
   The hormone, progesterone, is secreted normally during the latter
half of the menstrual period, said Dr. Irving Spitz, the director of
clinical research at the Population Council in New York, who is
studying the drug.
   ``One of the major effects of progesterone is to mature the
lining of the uterus so the egg can be implanted,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
   Researchers had been searching for such a drug for more than two
decades, Spitz said. ``This is the first drug to be found that could
actually block the action of progesterone,'' he said.
   When progesterone's action is blocked, the uterus sheds its
lining. Any egg that might have been fertilized and implanted in
that lining is shed along with the uterine lining.
   RU 486 itself terminates pregnancy in about 75 percent of women
who use it during the first six weeks of pregnancy, Spitz said. To
boost the drug's effectiveness, doctors also prescribe a
prostaglandin, one of a group of hormone and hormone-like chemicals
in the body.
   The prostaglandin causes uterine contractions. The combination of
RU 486 and the prostaglandin is effective in about 95 percent of
women during the first six weeks of pregnancy, Spitz said.
   The drug's manufacturer recommends that it be taken in one dose,
followed three days later by a dose of prostaglandin, Spitz said. In
France, the drug is given only at abortion clinics, so that doctors
can monitor its effectiveness. The drug is not available over the
counter.
   Doctors will want to counsel the 5 percent of women in whom the
drug is not effective, he said. And some women who take it will
bleed excessively.
   The entire process of terminating pregnancy is usually complete
in seven to 14 days, Spitz said.
   Spitz said he is not aware that anyone in the United States has
taken steps to market the drug. To do so, a company would be
required to file a new drug application with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.
   It would likely take at least several years before such an
application would be approved, Spitz said.
   Hoechst Roussel Pharmaceuticals in Somerville, N.J., which is
affiliated with the drug's French manufacturer, Roussel Uclaf, said
Friday it had no plans to study or market the drug.
   Gynopharma Inc., also of Somerville, had been rumored to be
negotiating to market the drug in the United States. It has since
denied that it has plans to do so.
   Laura Giles, spokeswoman for Gynopharma, said Friday that the
company has not negotiated with Roussel Uclaf and is not petitioning
the FDA to allow marketing of the drug.
   Spitz said that RU 486 blocks progesterone by interfering with
progesterone ``receptors'' on cells in the uterus.
   ``It works very similar to a lock and key,'' he explained. ``All
hormones work on receptors. The receptor is the lock; the hormone is
the key.''
   The drug causes nausea and vomiting in 13 percent or 14 percent
of women who use it, he said. It sometimes causes bleeding and pain
as well, but those are ``normal accompaniments of the abortion
process,'' Spitz said.

<HEAD>Blood Test Could Target Women Likely to Miscarry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A simple blood test conducted before pregnancy
might be a new way of identifying women at high risk of
miscarrying, according to research published in a British medical
journal.
   Writing in the Nov. 10 edition of The Lancet, the researchers
said it was the first time that measuring hormone levels before a
woman conceives has been found to predict whether a pregnancy will
be successfully carried to term.
   The doctors tested for the luteinising hormone (LH), which
controls ovulation.
   Dr. Lesley Regan, Dr. Elisabeth Owen and Professor Howard Jacobs
tested 193 women planning to become pregnant. The women ranged in
age from 21 to 43, with a median age of 30.7.
   The obstetricians from the Rosie Maternity Hospital, Cambridge
and University College Medical School wrote that 88 percent of the
women with normal LH levels conceived within 18 months. Only 67
percent of the women with abnormally high LH levels conceived
within that period.
   In the normal LH group, 12 percent of the women suffered
miscarriages. In the high group, 65 percent miscarried.
   The doctors concluded that a raised serum LH concentration in
the early phase of pregnancy confers a substantial risk of
miscarriage. The finding offers the possibility of a simple
predictive test for women before pregnancy.
   An abnormal result could also be used to identify patients that
could be treated to suppress excessive secretion of LH.

<LEADPARA>  FOR four months, a 34-year-old Tennessee male nurse endured daily shots of an
experimental anti-hormone drug to stop his sperm production. The shots kept
his wife from getting pregnant without taking birth control pills. When he
stopped the shots, his sperm count returned to normal.;   A 35-year-old
Indiana biomedical engineer had a plug inserted in his sperm duct for six
months. His wife didn't get pregnant, and when the experimental plug was
removed, there was every indication his fertility would have returned. He then
had a previously planned vasectomy.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     A 26-year-old Washington father of two boys traded his condoms for
experimental weekly hormone injections. Sterile for six months, he enjoyed
spontaneous sex with his wife until March. Then the trial ended, the shots
stopped and his sperm production resumed.;   These three men and the
experimental strategies they helped test are on the brink of a revolution in
contraception -- a safe, reversible "male pill.";   The nickname is a misnomer
because a pill's concentrated dose makes it too toxic to be safe. But whatever
form a new male contraceptive takes, it will be the first since mass-produced
condoms became possible 150 years ago with the advent of vulcanized rubber.;
Such a drug could be on the market by the year 2000, scientists say -- if
research budgets increase. But at current funding  levels, it could take twice
as long.;   Historically, the pharmaceutical industry has heavily funded birth
control studies for women, but that hasn't been the case for men.;   The
barriers;   Here's why:;   (check) Liability. The greatest barrier to
developing new contraceptives is the risk of lawsuits, according to
"Development of Contraceptives -- Obstacles and Opportunities," a 1990 report
by two federal agencies, the National Research Council and the Institute of
Medicine.;   The pharmaceutical industry hasn't forgotten what happened to
A.H. Robins Co. in the 1970s, when nearly 200,000 women using Robins' Dalkon
Shield intrauterine device complained of injuries ranging from infections to
sterility. The settlement cost the firm $2.5 billion. Then it went bankrupt.;
 (check) The graying of America. The pharmaceutical industry, along with the
rest of the medical community, has turned substantial attention to the
concerns of an aging population.;   "I think we should have a well-stocked
contraceptive supermarket, where men and women can pick and choose," said Carl
Djerassi, the Stanford University chemistry professor who pioneered
development of oral contraceptives for women in 1960. "But we are in a
geriatric society, not a pediatric one. We are worrying about heart disease,
cancer, inflammatory diseases, not contraception.";   (check) Marketability.
Even if male contraceptives become cheap and simple, will men, whose bodies
aren't at risk for pregnancy, bother to take them? And can women trust them
to?;   "Think about how hard it is to get these Joes to use a condom when they
know they could die from a coital act," says Gabriel Baily, director of the
contraceptive development branch of the National Institutes of Health in
Washington, D.C.;   The few researchers;   NIH is one of a handful of agencies
that finance virtually all U.S. male contraceptive research. Along with NIH,
the United Nations' World Health Organization and the U.S. Agency for
International Development's Contraceptive Research and Development (CONRAD)
program provide financing and administrative assistance to research
facilities.;   Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. in Raritan, N.J., is the only U.S.
company researching male contraceptives. And its work is limited to screening
new compounds for possible animal experiments, said Rich Salem, a company
spokesman.;   The sparse government and private financing supports medical
schools, private medical centers and research clinics.;   That research has
generally focused on two approaches. One, the use of hormones or anti-hormones
to fool the reproductive system into shutting down, could cost an estimated
$100 million to perfect. The other, a silicone implant designed to work like a
reversible vasectomy, could cost $16 million to $20 million.;   But the annual
combined NIH and CONRAD budgets for male contraception studies are only $3.75
million, a pittance considering it costs more than $3,000 to send one man
through a clinical trial, NIH's Baily said. Female contraception research gets
twice that amount -- $7.5 million annually.;   Focus is on women;   With
research so limited, no fundamentally new contraceptive has reached the U.S.
market since the woman's birth control pill was introduced 31 years ago. In
fact, while dramatic gains have been made in the past five years in
understanding male reproduction and how to short-circuit the process, women's
birth control continues to dominate budgets and national debate.;   Yet for
twice the money, female contraceptive researchers are only revamping old
ideas. The contraceptive implant Norplant, for example, was approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug administration late last year and hailed as America's first
new birth control method since the Pill. But the contraceptive is merely
another method of administering synthetic progesterone -- the same drug used
in women's oral contraceptives.;   Some researchers hope that support from the
pharmaceutical industry might come serendipitously, as a lucky breakthrough in
a related research area.;   Similar research;   For instance, Syntex Corp., a
Palo Alto-based pharmaceutical company, is studying a drug treatment for
prostate cancer. The cancer is aggravated by testosterone and the experimental
drug reduces testosterone levels -- just as some experimental contraceptives
do.;   The pharmaceutical industry also must consider whether cultural and
biological obstacles will prevent male contraceptives from being as lucrative
as those for women.;   Contraceptives were originally developed in part
because women wanted responsibility for their own bodies. Will they trust men
with that responsibility?;   "It's the woman who is subject to pregnancy.
(Women) want to know they are in charge," says Roberta Synal, spokeswoman for
the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.;   It's also been a lot easier
to prevent the fertilization of one egg a month in a woman than it is to stop
the 200 million to 400 million spermatozoa found in each man's ejaculation,
said Dr. Lauri Tom, an endocrinologist at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in
Torrance.;   Side effects;   Problems remain with experimental male
contraceptives' side effects and methods of delivery.;   Even the best have
side effects that include weight gain, allergic reactions, loss of libido and
possibly even heart and liver disease.;   Researchers also haven't been able
to overcome the toxic effects of a contraceptive concentrated in pill form. So
all current experimental drugs are administered through daily or weekly
injections -- an inconvenience customers probably won't be willing to accept.;
  Undaunted, researchers say they can make an effective, easy-to-use male
contraceptive. But without increased financial support, research will drag on
beyond the end of this century, said Dr. Spyros Pavlou, an endocrinologist who
directs male contraceptive research at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in
Nashville.;   "If we had all the money we need, we could have a male
contraceptive in the next five or six years," he said.; Derailing
reproduction; Researchers are working on ways to keep men from impregnating
their sex partners. Here's how the normal human male reproductive system works
and how three experimental strategies interfere with the process.; 1.
Hypothalamus; Sperm production starts here with the release of
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). This hormone stimulates the pituitary
gland.; 2. Pituitary gland; GnRH prompts release of luteinizing hormone (LH)
and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).; 3. Testes; LH prompts release of
testosterone. FSH prompts release of sperm and protein called inhibin.;
Testosterone; Male hormone maintains sex drive, hair, muscle, bone mass. Drop
in blood testosterone level signals hypothalamus to produce more GnRH and loop
begins again.; Sperm; Inhibin; Drop in blood inhibin level signals
hypothalamus to produce more GnRH and loop begins again.; STRATEGY 1; Fooling
the hypothalamus; 1. Man gets injection of testosterone and enanthate, a
compound that extends testosterone's effectiveness.; 2. Testosterone tells
hypothalamus that blood levels are sufficient, so GnRH production shuts down.;
3. With no GnRH, there is no FSH. With no FSH, there are no sperm.; Side
effects: Weight gain, acne, with long-term potential hazards including heart
and prostate disease.; STRATEGY 2; Stopping GnRH production; 1. Man gets
injection of a chemical antagonist that acts on hypothalamus.; 2. Antagonist
blocks release of GnRH.; 3. With no GnRH, there is no FSH. With no FSH, there
are no sperm.; Side effects: Antagonist can cause low blood pressure, allergic
reactions. Plus, no GnRH means no LH and thus no testosterone. Shots of
replacement testosterone required to prevent loss of sex drive and function.
Replacement testosterone can cause same side effects as Strategy 1.; STRATEGY
3; Blocking the sperm path; Normally, sperm travel from the testicles through
the vas deferens, mix with fluid from the seminal vesicle and exit through the
penis.; This strategy blocks that path. Two silicone plugs connected with a
nylon thread are inserted in the vas deferens.; Plugs can be removed to
restore fertility.; Side effects: Some men suffered tissue decay at implant
site.  </TEXT>

STUDY FINDS STRESSFUL JOB NOT HARMFUL IN PREGNANCY;

<P>
MEDICINE: HEALTHY, PROFESSIONAL WOMEN ARE AT NO GREATER RISK THAN OTHER

<P>
Professional women who work long hours in high-stress jobs during pregnancy are
just as likely as others to have healthy babies, according to a new study that
researchers say offers reassurance to prospective mothers among the growing
ranks of working women.
</P>
<P>
The study, published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that
physicians-in-training who worked about 70 hours a week while pregnant were at
no greater risk than others of having their pregnancies end in miscarriage,
stillbirth or other problems.
</P>
<P>
Nor were they more likely to give birth early.
</P>
<P>
"We can say that for . . . generally healthy, upper-middle class women, that
virtually any type of work during pregnancy is probably not going to harm their
pregnancy," said Patricia Shiono, an epidemiologist with the Center for the
Future of Children in Los Altos.
</P>
<P>
Shiono and the other researchers, headed by a pediatrician from the National
Institutes of Health, cautioned that their findings apply to healthy, affluent
women. They did not study lower-income and disadvantaged women or women with
already complicated pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that women in the study who worked especially long hours -- 100
hours or more a week -- were more likely to have a preterm delivery. Babies
born early and therefore underweight face a greater risk than other babies of a
variety of health problems.
</P>
<P>
"If there is any sign of complications, obstetricians are likely to advise
women to slow down (their work schedules). We would agree with that," said Dr.
George G. Rhoads, a co-author of the paper. "These findings should not be
construed (to mean) that you should work through thick and thin."
</P>
<P>
It has long been believed that women who become pregnant during a medical
residency face an increased risk of complications. Earlier studies have
produced mixed results, but some have found an added risk of preterm delivery,
delays in fetal development and other problems.
</P>
<P>
The issue is considered important not only because of the extraordinary demands
made upon medical residents, 28% of whom now are women; it is also of interest
for what it reflects about the effects of work in general on the ability to
bear a healthy child.
</P>
<P>
Obstetricians say the risk seems to vary from occupation to occupation and that
it is difficult to generalize about what women should do, but many believe that
jobs requiring heavy lifting and long hours of standing may be especially
risky.
</P>
<P>
"If it's a sedentary job, people can work until fairly close to delivery unless
they run into medical complications," said Dr. Palmer C. Evans, an
obstetrician-gynecologist in Tucson. "But if they're doing very heavy, manual
work, a lot of times they need to stop sooner than that."
</P>
<P>
The study, based on a survey of 4,412 women physicians, is the largest
conducted, the researchers said. They compared the women to 4,236 wives of male
residents, many of whom worked during pregnancy but only about half the hours
of the women residents.
</P>
<P>
The researchers, headed by Dr. Mark A. Klebanoff of the National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development, found that 13.8% of the pregnancies among
the medical residents and 11.8% of the other women ended in miscarriage -- a
difference too small to be significant.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the two groups had comparable percentages of stillbirths,
under-developed babies and ectopic gestations, in which the fertilized egg is
deposited outside the uterus. The residents were more likely to have had
preterm labor and preeclampsia (pregnancy-induced hypertension), but not
preterm birth.
</P>
<P>
Klebanoff said it was hard to know what to make of the increased risk of
preterm labor and preeclampsia without examining each woman's medical records.
But he speculated that the residents and their obstetricians may have been
especially alert to symptoms.
</P>
<P>
The only group that showed significant differences in rates of preterm delivery
were the 143 medical residents who worked 100 hours or more a week during
pregnancy. They were approximately twice as likely as the others to deliver
their baby early.

   An estranged couple's fight over the
fate of seven fertilized human eggs goes to court Monday and may
provide a legal precedent in cases where technology has bent the
traditional course of parenthood.
   Junior Lewis Davis is seeking to prevent his wife, Mary Sue
Davis, from attempting to become pregnant with any of the eggs now
that they are getting divorced. Davis, who filed for divorce in
February, says he no longer wants to have a child with her.
   The eggs were taken from Mrs. Davis and fertilized with Davis'
sperm in an in-vitro fertilization program the couple entered at a
Knoxville hospital six years ago in hopes of having a so-called
``test-tube baby.''
   ``I consider them life,'' Mrs. Davis, 28, said shortly after her
husband filed for divorce. She has said that the eggs are the
result of years of surgery, tests and self-administered injections
and are her best chance at having a child. ``I would love to be a
mother,'' she said.
   She also said she would consider raising the child by herself
and not asking for child support.
   Davis, 30, countered at the time that it would be unsettling
``to know that ... 10 years from now I could be walking down the
street and bump into my child and not know it.''
   In-vitro fertilization was first used successfully in 1978 with
the birth in England of Louise Brown. Eggs are surgically removed
from a woman's ovary and combined with sperm in the laboratory. The
resulting fertilized egg is then implanted in the woman's uterus in
hopes a normal pregnancy will result; other fertilized eggs can be
frozen for later attempts.
   Mrs. Davis says she had five tubal pregnancies after the couple
was married in 1979, one resulting in a ruptured fallopian tube.
Surgery was done to tie the other tube before the Davises entered
the in-vitro program administered by Dr. I. Ray King.
   There were originally nine fertilized eggs; two were
unsuccessfully implanted before the couple's marriage broke down.
   The Davises did not sign a contract specifying what should be
done with the embryos if circumstances changed such as a divorce,
or the death of one or both of them. King says that was an
oversight, but he added that any such agreement probably could be
contested in court anyway.
   But the lack of a contract leaves Blount County District Court
Judge W. Dale Young with no prior agreement on which to base his
decision, and with little legal guidance. Attorneys for both
parties said in briefs there was no legal precedent they could cite
to help guide Young's decision.
   ``There is no legal precedent that says very early embryos are
legal persons with rights,'' said John A. Robertson, a law
professor at the University of Texas. ``The state (of Tennessee)
could choose to protect them if it wished, but the state hasn't
done that.''
   The only state to take such action is believed to be Louisiana,
which has a law saying embryos are entitled to the full protection
of the law and cannot be owned or destroyed.
   In the Tennessee case, Charles Clifford, Davis' attorney, argues
that the embryos are joint property and can be disposed of like
other assets in a divorce. Giving Mrs. Davis sole discretion over
the embryos would deprive Davis of the right to decide whether to
sire offspring, the lawyer argued.
   Jay Christenberry, attorney for Mrs. Davis, argues that Davis is
trying to reverse a condition as old as Adam and Eve _ it has
never, he says, been within the man's power to cancel a pregnancy
once an egg has been fertilized.
   These embryos are in cold storage, not in Mrs. Davis' body. But
even in so primitive a form, with only four to eight cells, they
represent potential life, Mrs. Davis' attorney said.
   Robertson, who has written articles on the legal and ethical
aspects of in-vitro fertilization and the rights of embryos, is
expected to be called as a witness by Davis' attorney. He argues
that the case should be decided in favor of the person who would be
hurt worse by losing, which he says is Davis.
   ``It would seem that the party who wished to avoid parenthood
would be hurt worse if the embryos were used,'' he said. ``The
other parent can go out and create new embryo and try to have
children.''
   However, Mrs. Davis' chances of trying further in-vitro
fertilization could depend on her remarrying. Chicago attorney Lori
B. Andrews, a specialist in reproductive technology law, said she
knows of no in-vitro fertilization clinic that will take a single
woman as a patient.

NEWER TECHNIQUE FOR DETECTION OF BIRTH DEFECTS CALLED SAFE
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK, Times Medical Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recently developed technique for early prenatal detection of birth defects is
generally "safe and effective," but is slightly riskier and more prone to
failure than amniocentesis, a more widely used technique usually performed
later in pregnancy, according to a new study being published today.
</P>
<P>
The federally sponsored study of about 3,000 women aged 33 years or more found
that the increased risk of fetal loss associated with the newer technique,
chorionic villus sampling, was 0.8% higher than that associated with
amniocentesis. An accurate diagnosis of fetal chromosomal abnormalities such as
Down's syndrome was obtained 97.8% of the time, compared to 99.4% of the time
with amniocentesis.
</P>
<P>
Chorionic villus sampling, or CVS, is "here to stay" but "it will not replace
amniocentesis," said Dr. Lawrence D. Platt of County-USC Medical Center, an
expert practitioner of the two techniques who was not involved in the new
study.
</P>
<P>
Chorionic villus sampling is performed during the third month of pregnancy. The
tissue for laboratory analysis is obtained from the placenta, the connection
between the fetus and the mother, which contains cells that are almost always
genetically identical to those of the fetus.
</P>
<P>
Amniocentesis is usually performed between the 15th and 20th weeks of
pregnancy, although some obstetricians are doing the procedure earlier. In this
technique, fetal cells and fetal proteins from the amniotic fluid, the liquid
that surrounds the fetus, are analyzed.
</P>
<P>
Platt said chorionic villus sampling "clearly carries the advantages of earlier
prenatal diagnosis," such as reduced patient anxiety and decreased risk to the
mother when a birth defect is detected and an abortion carried out.
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned that chorionic villus sampling also suffered from some of the
"inherent limitations" of earlier diagnosis, such as a small increased risk of
miscarriages, an increased number of uncertain diagnoses that require further
testing and an inability to detect problems that do not manifest themselves
until later in pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
Another drawback is the inability of chorionic villus sampling to detect neural
tube birth defects, such as anencephaly and spina bifida. In addition, some
parents may elect to terminate pregnancies for non-medical reasons, such as sex
selection. Such terminations are rare when the sex of the baby is not learned
until later in pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
There were 25 elective abortions of "chromosomally normal" fetuses in the
chorionic villus group, including about 15 for sex selection, compared to two
such elective abortions in the amniocentesis group, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
Many within and outside the medical community object strongly to parents
aborting a pregnancy because a fetus is not of the desired sex. Some medical
centers have policies against performing prenatal diagnostic techniques for sex
selection.
</P>
<P>
Results similar to those in the new U.S. study were found in a Canadian study
of 2,787 women that was published in the Lancet, a British medical journal, in
January.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian study had the advantage of randomly comparing the two procedures,
while the American study did not; according to the new report, the primarily
well-educated private patients who were studied at UC San Francisco and six
other major medical centers resisted a "vigorous effort" to randomly assign
them. Instead, they were given a choice between the techniques.
</P>
<P>
Platt and another expert in maternal-fetal medicine said the data from both
studies underscored the need for women to seek medical care early in pregnancy
and to discuss with their physicians the pros and cons of the increasingly
complicated array of prenatal diagnostic tests.
</P>
<P>
They also predicted that publication of the study would accelerate a trend
toward wider availability of chorionic villus sampling.
</P>
<P>
Chorionic villus sampling "is a viable alternative to amniocentesis in the
hands of experienced people," said Dr. John Williams III, the medical director
of the Prenatal Diagnostic Center of Southern California, a private facility in
Beverly Hills. Williams, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at
UCLA, said he performs 15 to 20 procedures a week at his center, which along
with UC San Francisco is one of the busiest CVS facilities on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
L.A. Performance Rate
</P>
<P>
Over the last two years, about 1,500 of these procedures have been performed in
Los Angeles, compared to more than 22,000 amniocenteses, Platt said. An
estimated 50,000 to 60,000 of the procedures have been performed worldwide,
according to Williams.
</P>
<P>
Some insurers, such as Kaiser-Permanente of Southern California and Blue Cross
of California have covered chorionic villus sampling since late last year.
Others, such as Blue Shield of California and Medi-Cal, the
government-supported insurance program for the poor, do not cover the procedure
because they consider it experimental.
</P>
<P>
In addition, physicians offering the procedure must receive specific approval
from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration because the catheters, or thin
sterile tubes, through which the sampling is performed are considered
experimental and none is approved for marketing. About 30 physicians nationwide
are estimated to have such authorization.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the status of the catheters, a knowledgeable FDA official said
that they are likely to remain under investigation for some time. To date none
of the companies that manufacture them have requested marketing approval and
submitted the necessary data for review, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Chorionic villus sampling was developed in the early 1980s. During the
procedure, the catheter is inserted into the uterus through the vagina under
the guidance of an ultrasound machine. A small amount of placental tissue is
then removed through the tube. The procedure can also be performed by inserting
a needle into the uterus through the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results of the sampling are available within a day and final
results -- which require culturing cells in a laboratory -- within one to two
weeks. The total cost in Los Angeles is about $1,300 to $1,400, Platt said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Level of Discomfort
</P>
<P>
During amniocentesis, a needle is inserted into the amniotic fluid through the
abdomen, also under ultrasound guidance. Because the fetal cells must be grown
extensively in a laboratory, complete test results are usually not available
for several weeks. The total cost in Los Angeles ranges from $800 to $1,100,
Platt said.
</P>
<P>
Both procedures take 10 to 30 minutes to perform. According to Platt, the level
of patient discomfort is similar, although he said the majority of patients
seem to find chorionic villus sampling less painful.
</P>
<P>
Both techniques are most frequently used to screen for Down's syndrome and
other chromosomal abnormalities, which are most common in mothers aged 35 or
older. As part of the chromosome analysis, the sex of the baby can be
determined as well. The techniques can also be used to screen for inherited
genetic diseases, such as Tay-Sachs disease, cystic fibrosis, muscular
dystrophy and sickle cell anemia.
</P>
<P>
The new study was sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
Results in 2,278 women who had chorionic villus sampling were compared to those
in 671 women who had amniocentesis.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rate of Losses
</P>
<P>
The total rate of pregnancy losses, including spontaneous abortions,
termination of abnormal pregnancies, stillbirths and neonatal deaths, was 7.2%
in the group that underwent chorionic villus sampling and 5.7% in the group
that had amniocentesis. The highest rate of pregnancy loss followed chorionic
villus procedures in which multiple attempts to obtain placental tissue were
required.
</P>
<P>
After adjustment for differences in the ages of the mothers and the fetuses --
which influence the expected rate of fetal loss -- the researchers said the
"total loss rate" for women in the chorionic villus group exceeded the rate for
the amniocentesis group by 0.8%.
</P>
<P>
The most common symptoms after the procedures were cramping and spotting; these
were more common in the chorionic villus group. None of the pregnant women
suffered serious infections, although such infections are known to be a rare
complication of chorionic villus sampling.

<HEAD>Test-Tube Babies Now Global Phenomenon</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-In Vitro Decade</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Since the world's first ``test-tube baby'' was
born in England 10 years ago, the medical technique that made her
life possible has spread around the world and spawned an array of
treatments to help childless couples.
   ``It's been astonishing. ... The ideas are coming from
everywhere,'' said physiologist Robert Edwards, who with the late
gynecologist Patrick Steptoe pioneered the technique known as in
vitro fertilization.
   ``There have been some amazing advances,'' especially in
unlocking some of the mysteries of early human growth and
hereditary diseases, Edwards said.
   Originally developed as a treatment for women with blocked
Fallopian tubes, in vitro fertilization has produced a range of
techniques such as embryo freezing, womb-leasing and egg donation
to treat infertility in both men and women.
   Virtually every industrialized country has an established in
vitro program, and many developing countries, such as China, India
and Egypt, have entered the field.
   Because few countries keep records of in vitro births, no
precise estimate exists of their number worldwide.
   However, a survey by AP bureaus indicated at least 10,000
test-tube babies have been born since the first, Louise Joy Brown,
on July 25, 1978.
   Britain, Australia, France, the United States, West Germany,
Belgium and Austria account for the majority of test-tube babies
worldwide.
   But fledgling programs also have been set up in Asia, the Middle
East and Latin America, often in defiance of religious and economic
objections.
   In the conservative Islamic nations of the Middle East, for
example, theologians initially balked at in vitro because of the
Koran's teaching against Western-style adoption procedures and
birth outside marriage. But clinics have sprung up in Saudi Arabia
and Egypt, mainly catering to the wealthy, and two clinics are
expected to open soon in Bahrain.
   Italy, meanwhile, has established a flourishing test-tube baby
program despite the Roman Catholic Church's objections to
artificial reproduction.
   China, while imposing a strict one-child-per-family regime to
control its population of more than 1 billion, announced the birth
of its first test-tube baby this year. India's first test-tube baby
was born two years ago.
   In vitro researchers say assisted conceptions produce a
statistically negligible addition to the population, and Edwards
says those who criticize populous countries for promoting new
childbirth methods ``should re-analyze their own view of life.''
   ``A Chinese woman has the same urge to have children as a
British woman,'' he said. ``You can't just set aside a group of
patients and leave them to suffer in silence.''
   Despite the proliferation of clinics, the Steptoe-Edwards
technique remains a costly, hit-and-miss proposition available to
only about 5 percent of childless couples.
   ``Nearly 10 years after the first baby was born as a result of
in vitro fertilization, this treatment is still largely
unsuccessful,'' said a report in the June 25 issue of the British
Medical Journal.
   It said the latest figures show that in Britain only 11 percent
of women got pregnant and 9 percent had a live baby after a single
cycle of treatment, and other countries with advanced programs had
similar success rates.
   The treatment has brought ``an awful lot of joy and happiness
for a lot of people, but also a lot of disappointment,'' said Dr.
Peter Brinsden, deputy director of the Fertility and In Vitro
Fertilization Unit at London's Humana Hospital, Wellington.
   Eventually, he expects the success rate ``to creep up to 20 to
30 percent,'' but noted, ``It's a long way down the road.''
   Brinsden and his colleagues are among world leaders in the
latest in vitro spinoff known as gamete intrafallopian transfer, or
GIFT, in which doctors transfer egg and sperm directly into the
Fallopian tube for fertilization in the womb.
   The Humana unit has reported a 31.2 percent success rate with
GIFT, but it has the drawback of being available only to women with
at least one unblocked Fallopian tube, the normal site of
conception.
   Although Edwards said his clinic at Bourn Hall, near Cambridge,
has a much higher pregnancy rate than average, he acknowledged that
the biggest in vitro advances have been in research into hereditary
diseases, rather than improving the technique's success rate.
   Under the Steptoe-Edwards technique, ova are removed from the
mother, mixed with the prospective father's sperm in a laboratory
dish and reimplanted in the mother's uterus.
   To increase the chances of pregnancy, doctors now routinely use
drugs to stimulate ovulation and fertilize and implant three or
four embryos at a time, resulting in a high incidence of multiple
births.
   Australia, which began in vitro research as far back as 1971 and
has produced an estimated 2,000 babies, has pioneered the storing
of frozen embryos in liquid nitrogen.
   The procedure, which saves embryos for later use if the first
attempt at pregnancy fails, has proved highly controversial.
   In 1983, a quandary developed over what came to be known as the
world's first ``test-tube orphans'' _ embryos left in Australian
cold storage after their American parents died in a plane crash.
The embryos were offered to a childless couple last December, but
it is not known whether they were ever used.
   An estimated 10,000 frozen embryos are now stockpiled around the
world _ 3,000 in France, 1,000 in Britain and most of the others in
Australia, raising concerns over their fate should their parents
die or decide not to claim them.
   Australia, France, West Germany, Sweden, Italy and Spain have
all taken steps to regulate in vitro. But the most comprehensive
nationwide controls are expected to emerge in Britain, where the
government has proposed legislation covering the entire field of
fertility treatment and embryo research.

PERSONAL HEALTH: SCIENCE MAY HAVE ENABLED OLDER WOMEN TO BECOME MOTHERS, BUT
SOME EXPERTS WONDER IF OLDER MOMS HAVE THE ENDURANCE NECESSARY FOR
CHILD-REARING.

<P>
Motherhood, it seems, is not necessarily just for the young. Thanks to medical
progress, the young-at-heart now qualify, too.
</P>
<P>
Just ask Barbara Strong who, at 42, gave birth this year to a daughter, years
after physicians told her she would never have children because of ovary damage
from drug treatment for breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
On a recent weekday morning, Strong, a psychiatrist, played with Christina, 8
months old, and Juliana, 1, the daughter she adopted with husband Robert
Wilson. In a few hours, she'll dash off to care for patients.
</P>
<P>
Life is busy and fulfilling, Strong says.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think at 40 you're over the hill," she says with a laugh, hauling
Juliana upstairs.
</P>
<P>
Strong became pregnant in June, 1989, after doctors implanted an embryo
conceived in a test tube from her husband's sperm and an egg from a donor, a
young woman who lives near Strong in El Monte.
</P>
<P>
Although Strong's ovaries were not adequately producing eggs, she and other
menopausal women are able to bear children successfully if they receive an
embryo from donor eggs and hormone injections in the first three months of
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
The results of one study on seven women, including Strong, were published in
last week's New England Journal of Medicine. Of the seven women, ages 40 to 44,
four gave birth to healthy babies.
</P>
<P>
The use of donor eggs for in vitro fertilization is not new. But what has
evoked widespread fascination is the discovery that some women who are
technically menopausal can still carry a child. Some researchers now refuse to
put an age limit on motherhood.
</P>
<P>
But the brave-new-world science raises at least one practical question that
can't be answered until long after baby leaves the nursery: How will pregnancy
and raising babies play in middle age? While some argue that older parents have
numerous advantages over younger ones, others contend that although the spirit
may be willing, the body just may be not be able to cope with the rigors of
child-rearing.
</P>
<P>
Some experts point out a downside to middle-aged motherhood: The medical risks
to both mothers and babies increase substantially when the parents are over 40.
And some sociologists say children of older parents sense a difference in their
upbringing.
</P>
<P>
But according to 40-ish mothers like Strong, babies born as the biological
clock is ticking are wholeheartedly -- sometimes desperately -- wanted. The
parents are often financially stable, secure in their careers and calm in their
management of children.
</P>
<P>
Strong and Wilson always wanted to have children, Strong says, but postponed
starting a family to pursue careers after their marriage in 1975.
</P>
<P>
They decided about seven years ago to start a family, when Strong was 36 and
Wilson was 37. But the long-anticipated plunge into parenthood was sidetracked
by several traumatic events.
</P>
<P>
Strong miscarried her first pregnancy. She became pregnant a second time, but
just a few weeks before the child was due, she delivered a stillborn baby. The
couple was determined to try again when Strong discovered she had breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
The cancer was successfully treated, but the chemotherapy Strong received
damaged the function of her ovaries -- the organs that produce eggs. Her
physicians advised her to forget about having children.
</P>
<P>
"I still had a little bit of function of my ovaries. But the doctors thought
that women at 38 are too old to have children," Strong says. "But I didn't give
up."
</P>
<P>
Strong frequently reads medical journals, and one day she saw a brief article
by USC physician Mark Sauer on the use of donor eggs and embryo transfer for
women over age 40.
</P>
<P>
At the time, the couple was considering finding a surrogate, who would be
artificially inseminated with Wilson's sperm, to carry a child.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to have a baby so badly," Strong says. "We were thinking about using
a surrogate, but I thought if I could experience pregnancy and childbirth, I
didn't want to give that experience to another woman."
</P>
<P>
Strong knew the medical risks of having a child increase after age 40, but they
are not considered extreme. Infant mortality increases to 12 deaths per 100,000
live births when women reach age 40, compared to 9 per 100,000 at age 30.
Maternal mortality rates are also higher at 40 (80 per 100,000 live births at
40 versus 20 per 100,000 at age 30).
</P>
<P>
Older women are at greater risk for complications during pregnancy, such as
hypertension and diabetes, and often require delivery by Cesarean section.
</P>
<P>
The risk of genetic defects is also much higher among older women when the
woman's own egg is used. The risk of Down's syndrome, for instance, is 1 in 30
at age 45 compared to 1 in 952 at age 30.
</P>
<P>
However, when the egg is donated by a younger woman, scientists don't know if
the rate of genetic defects will resemble that of the younger donor or that of
birth mother.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that an older woman is going to have a higher risk for
her and the baby," says Dr. Geoffrey Sher, executive director of the Pacific
Fertility Centers, which has offices in several West-Coast cities. "There is a
higher rate of prematurity, bleeding, high blood pressure and of having a
C-section."
</P>
<P>
Because the success rate for in vitro fertilization is much lower for women
over 40, many infertility programs will not accept these women as patients,
Sher says. Sher, who has researched several new techniques for evaluating the
chances of an older woman becoming pregnant, believes that practice is
discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
"Should older women get pregnant? Whose choice is it? If a woman is over 40 and
wants to have a baby, do you and I have a right to deny her that? We don't have
that moral or ethical right," he says.
</P>
<P>
In hopes of carrying a baby, Strong contacted a Southern California fertility
clinic that performed the procedure but required the couple to find their own
egg donor. Strong placed an advertisement in a newspaper, found a donor and
received an embryo transfer early in 1989. But the transfer failed.
</P>
<P>
Strong and Wilson adopted Juliana but later contacted Sauer, who had donors
available and made her part of his study. Strong got pregnant with the first
embryo transfer.
</P>
<P>
"I really wasn't counting on it working, so I was surprised when I got
pregnant," Strong says. "I guess all you need is one good egg."
</P>
<P>
What one needs for 18 years (at least) of intensive parenthood is more complex.
But Strong dismisses the idea that younger people have an edge on parenting.
</P>
<P>
"I think when you get a little older, you are more relaxed and you have more
financial stability," Strong says. "I think maybe your family means more to you
at that point."
</P>
<P>
Strong says she and her husband thought about the potential for becoming ill or
disabled later in life when they are trying to raise teen-agers. But, Strong
says, "Life expectancy is 77 or so now. You still have a long productive life
in front of you. And illness can happen to a younger woman as well."
</P>
<P>
Other women are equally confident of meeting the challenges of motherhood at
mid-life. Susan (a pseudonym) is four months pregnant. In her 40s, she thinks
her age gives her an advantage at parenting -- even if it puts her at a
disadvantage for getting pregnant.
</P>
<P>
She too is carrying a child conceived from a donor egg and her husband's sperm
and was part of Sauer's study. No one but her doctors and husband knows the
genetic makeup of the child she will bear in five months.
</P>
<P>
"We got married a bit later in life," she says. "We both wanted to have
children. We have established careers. We're educated, professionals. We really
want to be parents."
</P>
<P>
Susan admits that rising for 2 a.m. feedings might be more difficult than it
would have been back in the days when she didn't arrive home from a party until
that hour.
</P>
<P>
"I may not have quite the energy I had when I was 20, but I'm sure we're going
to find a way to cope with that," she says.
</P>
<P>
And there is precedent for older parenthood. Men have been fathering children
into old age since Adam. And women are having babies, naturally, at older ages.
According to one Census Bureau finding, the number of women 35 and older giving
birth for the first time has quadrupled in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
"I know quite a few people in their later 30s who are having babies," Susan
says. "I don't feel like I'm alone. I really don't know many people in their
20s anymore who are having babies."
</P>
<P>
Carol Pulitzer, a Mill Valley woman who underwent conventional in vitro
fertilization (her egg and her husband's sperm) is typical of a growing number
of women who are ready for motherhood at a time when their bodies aren't. The
urge to have a baby didn't hit Pulitzer until age 35.
</P>
<P>
"I was not crazy to have a child. Then I hit this age where I said, 'Hey, wait
a minute,' " says Pulitzer, 44. "I started trying and figured I would get
pregnant right away. I was so surprised that I couldn't get pregnant right
away. It got to be something that I had to conquer."
</P>
<P>
She succeeded on her third attempt at in vitro fertilization and now has a
19-month-old son. While Pulitzer thinks she is better equipped for parenthood
now, she worries that her son might have preferred a younger mother.
</P>
<P>
"I had a father who was very old. I grew up very worried that my father was
going to die on me. I think it's something we'll have to deal with. We'd have
other problems if we'd had (a child) when I was 20."
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles sociologist Monica Morris, one of the few researchers who has
studied "older" parenthood, has a far less rosy view of what is to come for
change-of-life babies.
</P>
<P>
The author of the 1988 book "Last-Chance Children: Growing Up With Older
Parents," Morris' study of 22 adults raised by parents older than the norm
found that many wished their parents had been younger.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that children know there is a difference," says Morris, a
sociologist at Cal State L.A. "OK, so women can have babies at 39, 40, God help
us, 50. People are still not asking, 'What will this mean to children? What
will it mean to have a parent who is as old as your friends' grandparents?' "
</P>
<P>
About half the respondents in Morris' survey were largely unaffected by having
older parents. But the other half, she says "really loathed their position."
</P>
<P>
Morris says that while older parents are better off financially, she says it is
a myth to think that people in their 40s and 50s are as physically fit for
parenthood as younger people.
</P>
<P>
"People will say, 'Well, things are different now. Now we're going to live
longer and be healthy.' It isn't like that. Fifty isn't 20. You can have a face
lift if you want, but the body parts are older. You get more tired."
</P>
<P>
Still, Morris does not dispute that these children and their parents often
share a deep love.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say don't do it," she says. "I would never tell people not to have
children. The point I was trying to make is you just can't push these issues
aside. You have to think about these things and about what you can do."
</P>
<P>
For instance, her research revealed that children of older parents tend to be
happiest if their parents spend a lot of time with them.
</P>
<P>
"Go to the football game with your kid, even if you can't play football," she
says.
</P>
<P>
Strong agrees that 40-ish is not a prime time to have children, and, she says
with hindsight, she would have done things differently.
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to limit your options, which is what I did," she says. "You
don't want to say, 'At 40, I'll have my children.' But I still think this is a
great opportunity for women in their 40s. Having a child of your own is such a
great experience." It's even kind of fun to have beaten -- well, fooled -- the
biological clock.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Strong underwent another embryo transfer and will soon find out if
she is pregnant. And Pulitzer is set to begin medical tests to evaluate her
chances for a second pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
Childbirth at 45?
</P>
<P>
"Piece of cake," Pulitzer says.

<HEAD>Genetically Engineered Hormone Holds Out Hope for Treating
Infertility</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers say they're encouraged by animal
tests of a genetically engineered human hormone for treating one of
the more common forms of infertility in women.
   ``It does everything we want it to do so far,'' said Dr. James
Simon, one of four authors of a study in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   The hormone, produced by recombinant gene-splicing technology,
is called rechLH and is biologically identical to the substance
produced by a woman's pituitary gland to induce ovulation, called a
luteinizing hormone, or LH.
   ``In primate testing, rechLH initiated ovulation, it helped
stimulate normal hormonal production through the entire menstrual
cycle, the eggs were fertile and the monkeys produced embryos,''
Simon said.
   ``But until we try it in humans, we can't be sure all the
advantages are real,'' said Simon, who is director of the
Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility Services at the
Georgetown University School of Medicine.
   Serono Laboratories Inc., the worldwide pharmaceutical concern
that is developing rechLH, estimates it could be seven to nine
years before the product is clinically tested on humans, approved
by the Food and Drug Administration and put on the market.
   One of the more common causes of infertility in women is
hormonal abnormalities that prevent a woman from regularly
producing fertile eggs.
   The hormonal abnormalities, in turn, can frequently be traced to
a woman's inability to produce either LH or another hormone, called
a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), in the proper sequence and
ratio.
   Supplies of both FSH and LH used to treat infertility are now
extracted from the urine of post-menopausal women.
   Sources of pure FSH, which causes follicles in the ovary to grow
and mature prior to the start of ovulation, have been available
commercially for about a year.
   Prior to development of rechLH, no source of pure LH existed.
   ``The delicate balance between the two hormones is what makes up
a menstrual cycle, and getting both together limited our ability to
mimic the normal pituitary processes,'' Simon said. ``By having a
pure source of LH, we can add it back in such a way to tailor the
relationship to each individual we treat.
   ``And that says nothing about the obvious advantages of
availability and consistency of production we can maintain by being
able to produce rechLH through genetic engineering,'' Simon said.
   LH also is involved in sperm production and rechLH may help
battle sterility in men as well, said Simon, though its potential
application for males now is much less understood by researchers.

<HEAD>New Medical Technology Allows Women To Turn Back Biological Clock</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Ricki Bingham never doubted she would have a child, but when the
time finally felt right she was 37 years old. And it was too late.
   ``I saw a future in which I was childless ... and it was
terrifying,'' said Bingham, one of thousands of women each year who
undergo premature menopause.
   No one had warned the Hyattsville, Md., woman that putting off
pregnancy could mean forfeiting the experience altogether.
   She despaired until discovering a new medical procedure that
offers post-menopausal women a chance to turn back their biological
clocks.
   Bingham, who did her homework on infertility, became pregnant 14
weeks ago after undergoing the new procedure in which her husband's
sperm was mixed with a younger donor's egg - in this case her
sister's - and placed in the hormone-stimulated womb.
   ``Ten years ago I would have run out of options,'' said Bingham,
40, a contractor with the U.S. Energy Department.``It's a miracle
that something like this is possible. But you also have to
understand what the negatives are.''
   The new procedure, detailed last week in the New England Journal
of Medicine, enables women well into their 40s, 50s and perhaps 60s
to bear children.
   The woman undergoes a normal pregnancy and delivery, but because
the egg is taken from a donor, she is not the genetic parent.
   The technology also raises questions about the wisdom of
deferring childbearing into a woman's later years, when such risks
as high blood pressure and premature labor are higher.
   Infertility specialists aren't recommending the new technology
as a routine alternative to natural conception. The procedure costs
$8,000 and finding donors, who receive an additional $1,500, can be
very difficult.
   ``If I were in front of a group of 31-year-old women, I'd
suggest they seriously think about initiating their attempt at
conception in the near future,'' said Dr. Benjamin Sandler, a
reproductive medicine specialist at Mount Sinai Medical Center in
New York.
   ``This form of therapy is a last chance,'' said Sandler, whose
clinic has created 50 post-menopausal pregnancies over the last two
years. ``For a woman who has lost her reproductive capacity, it is
a way to take a baby home.''
   But what happens after that baby arrives home? Do older women
have the stamina necessary to chase after toddlers? Will they live
long enough to see those toddlers grow into adulthood?
   ``You wonder what our children will be like,'' said Wendy
Fiering, a 42-year-old architect who has been trying to get
pregnant.
   ``I'm very excited about all the advances,'' the Cambridge,
Mass., resident said. ``But this reproductive experience has made
me realize that ... when all is said and done, the younger years
are probably what it's designed for.''
   That is not to say, all the women agreed, that motherhood
belongs to a particular age group. Connie Chung and Glenn Close are
just two of many women who have pursued over-40 pregnancies.
   Still, to manipulate the biological clock is to tamper with one
of nature's absolutes. Some women said the idea of artificially
delaying life's cycles is troubling.
   Although menopause generally occurs around age 50, the ovaries
have stopped working in up to 10 percent of women by age 40. And
for those women, the new in vitro technology comes as a blessed
second chance.
   ``It's not about having it all,'' said Beth Hall, who directs
the Northern California chapter of Resolve Inc., a national
infertility support and information network.
   ``It's for those of us that are in that late childbearing age
range, the baby boomers who grew up being able to accomplish what
we wanted,'' said Hall, who adopted a baby girl after
unsuccessfully undergoing fertility treatment.
   ``Our mothers were not out there to say, `Look, if you choose to
pursue a career there is risk associated with that,'' said Patty
Delaney, who had her first child at 34 and began having menopausal
hot flashes a year later.
   ``I'd figured I had plenty of time,'' said Delaney, 47, who
lives in Washington and administers federal AIDS programs. ``So
whe I was told I probably would not have another child, I had to
acknowledge the years I could have ... but chose not to.'''
   Though she finds the ``genetic roulette'' troubling, Delaney
said she might have considered the new in vitro procedure 10 years
ago. But since her early menopause, she has been diagnosed with
Hodgkin's disease, a form of cancer.
   ``We've been the cutting edge generation and it's painful,''
Delaney said. ``It's wonderful that women have more choices. Now we
have to share them with our sons and daughters. We have to tell
them: `Be advised. Know that if you choose (to postpone pregnancy)
you may face adversity.'''

   In this nation of 1 billion people, who are
multiplying faster than the government wants, Dr. Zhang Lizhu is
working to help infertile couples have the one baby Chinese law
allows.
   The Beijing Medical University researcher recently saw the
success of three years of work when a 39-year-old primary school
teacher bore China's first test-tube baby, a girl.
   The birth, nearly 10 years after the world's first test-tube
baby, Louise Joy Brown, was born in England, was celebrated as a
national achievement, proof that China can master advanced medical
procedures.
   It also was a sign of the government's relatively recent support
for programs to help the infertile, overcoming opponents who argue
that the last thing China needs is more babies.
   Large families once were a tradition in China, and boys were
favored because they could help support the family later on. But
with the population burgeoning, the government instituted rigorous
birth control measures in the late 1970s and each couple was
restricted to one child. The government's goal is to achieve zero
population growth by the year 2000.
   The penalties for couples who have more than one child can a
fine and the loss of valued government or work benefits.
   But there was rejoicing when Zheng Mengzhu, the 8{-pound,
test-tube girl was born March 10, for it meant a breakthrough for
those couples unable to have the one child permitted by law.
   Mengzhu's picture and her mother's were published on the front
pages of leading newspapers, and China Central Television broadcast
an operating-room interview with the mother after the delivery by
Caesarean section.
   ``If she's clever enough and studies hard I want her to become a
doctor or lawyer,'' said the mother, Zheng Guizhen, who spent her
entire nine months of pregnancy in the hospital to ensure nothing
went wrong.
   ``Everything was smooth,'' said Mrs. Zhang, the doctor. ``She
had some morning sickness but no high blood pressure.''
   But Mrs. Zhang is taking no chances with this baby, a small
symbol of China's progress in medicine. She isn't letting the
mother and child make the arduous, four-day trip to the family's
home in rural northwest China until the weather is warmer and the
baby is several months old.
   Meanwhile, Mrs. Zhang is closely watching the progress of a
woman pregnant with China's second test-tube child, due in May.
   She also has conducted two gamete fallopian transfers, an
alternate method of artificial fertilization in which the doctor
places the mother's eggs and father's sperm together in the woman's
Fallopian tubes, instead of in a laboratory dish.
   Mrs. Zhang's first attempt ended in a miscarriage, but the
second resulted in the birth of Zheng Mengzhu.
   Mrs. Zhang, aided by eight other doctors, began her test-tube
baby program in 1984 at the Beijing Medical University's No. 3
Teaching Hospital. In 1986, the government made producing a
test-tube baby one of the goals of China's Five-Year Plan, and
appointed Mrs. Zhang to head the effort.
   The government allocated the yuan equivalent of only $108,000
for the task, a sum Mrs. Zhang said showed ``spiritual support''
but fell far short of the need.
   To observe the procedure in action, she and two assistants
visited doctors in the United States who did pioneering work in the
field.
   But her own relatively primitive laboratory facilities, she
said, could not match those of the American doctors. In winter, she
had trouble just keeping the lab warm enough for the delicate egg
and sperm cultures. Many Chinese public buildings have little or no
heat.
   Mrs. Zhang said she implanted artifically fertilized eggs in the
wombs of 14 patients without success before the two pregnancies
resulted.
   ``I feel just a bit relieved that I fulfilled what I said I
would,'' Mrs. Zhang said after Mengzhu's birth. ``Actually it's
nothing very outstanding _ it's almost the 6,000th test-tube baby
worldwide _ but in China I think it's very hard to do this work due
to our facilities and public opinion.''
   Many believe China has no need for artificial fertilization when
the natural birth rate threatens to outpace the food supply.
   ``One of the reasons we started this program quite late is that
we knew there would be different opinions,'' Mrs. Zhang said.
``Everybody knows China is overpopulated.''
   But the law permits all couples to have one child, she added,
even the infertile. She said hundreds of women have written or
visited to seek her help, some in tears because of family pressure
to produce a child, especially a son.
   ``Probably the woman will be mistreated by her mother-in-law
because she can't give birth,'' Mrs. Zhang said. ``Some even think
of suicide.''
   Mrs. Zheng, China's first test-tube mother, said as she
breastfed her baby, ``Most people can't understand how a woman
suffers when she hasn't had a baby.
   ``For 20 years, I expected I would have a child but couldn't. If
Dr. Zhang had not given me a child I would not have wanted to keep
living.''
   China does not keep statistics on the number of infertile
couples. Mrs. Zhang estimated that about 50,000 women might be
candidates for test-tube fertilization, but emphasized that no
studies have been done.
   Traditionally, women who could not become pregnant made
offerings to the Earth God and ate herbs believed to increase
fertility. Mrs. Zhang said some herbs appear to help in individual
cases, although the reason has not been researched.
   Since 1981, sperm banks have opened in several major cities,
including Beijing, Canton, Shanghai and Chungking. They have
claimed dozens of pregnancies.
   At least four hospitals or research institutes in addition to
the Beijing Medical University have begun test-tube baby programs,
although none has yet produced a pregnancy.

   An experimental AIDS drug injected into two
pregnant monkeys reached their fetuses, raising hope that it might
block AIDS virus infection of human babies by their mothers,
scientists said today.
   If used early enough in pregnancy, it might ward off perinatal
AIDS infection, said study co-author Daniel Capon of Genentech Inc.
of South San Francisco.
   The drug reached the fetuses about as easily as a human mother's
natural proteins do as they build up disease resistance within
babies, researchers said.
   The drug, called a CD4 immunoadhesin, has shown promise against
the AIDS virus in the test tube, but its effectiveness in people is
not yet known.
   The standard AIDS drug AZT can also reach fetuses, crossing the
placenta ``quite well,'' said James Balsley of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
   Researchers are testing AZT's safety in pregnant women and plan
to test whether it can block perinatal transmission of the AIDS
virus, he said Wednesday.
   Some 1,734 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome in
infants who were infected by their mothers have been recorded by
the federal Centers for Disease Control. Scientists do not know
details of how babies are infected, but many infections appear to
happen during pregnancy, with some during birth.
   A child born to an AIDS-infected woman runs a 20 percent to 40
percent risk of being infected by the mother, studies suggest.
   The new work is reported in today's issue of the British journal
Nature by Capon and others at Genentech, and Jerome Groopman and
colleagues at Harvard Medical School and New England Deaconess
Hospital in Boston.
   The immunoadhesin they studied is a man-made hybrid of parts of
two natural proteins. One protein, called CD4, is found on the
surface of some cells in the body. The other protein, an
immunoglobulin, plays a key role in the body's disease-fighting
immune system.
   The new study and previous research show that in the test tube,
immunoadhesins can block the AIDS virus from infecting cells, and
can trigger the killing of infected cells while leaving healthy
cells alone.
   To test the drug's ability to cross the placenta, researchers
injected two rhesus monkeys near the end of their gestational
periods with immunoadhesins and then infused more drug for 24 hours
before performing Caesarian sections.
   Blood from the newborns contained about 3 percent of the
concentration of immunoadhesins that their mothers' blood had,
researchers reported. Other experiments have shown that natural
maternal immunoglobulins reach human fetuses at about the same
rate, study authors said.
   With maternal immunoglobulins, Capon said, the fetal level
builds up over time. A similar accumulation of immunoadhesins might
occur if the drug is given early enough in pregnancy, he said.
   Gwendolyn Scott of the University of Miami School of Medicine,
who is studying perinatal AIDS virus infection, called the
immunoadhesin idea ``an exciting concept in terms of perhaps
another way that perinatal transmission might be interrupted.''
   Questions about safety of the fetus would have to be studied,
she said in a telephone interview.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women with an abnormal immune condition related
to the thyroid may be twice as likely to suffer miscarriages early
in pregnancy, a study has found.
   But an independent researcher and authors of the report
published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association cautioned that the finding needs further study.
   ``This is the first time anything like this has been found,''
said one of the study's authors, Dr. Alex Stagnaro-Green of the
endocrinology division of Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New
York. ``Before women need to start worrying about this, this study
will have to be replicated.''
   The report is the first to link miscarriages with the presence
of two thyroid auto-antibodies - thyroglobulin and
thyroidperoxidase. An auto-antibody is a type of antibody, but
instead of aiding the body in fighting off disease, it works
against it, Stagnaro-Green said.
   It's unclear what causes the two thyroid auto-antibodies, but
researchers know they are related to a disfunction in the way the
immune system typically works, he said.
   Stagnaro-Green said the study, ``is an important finding in that
it's another instance in which immunological factors have been
linked to miscarriages.''
   Women who test positive for either thyroglobulin and
thyroidperoxidase don't suffer from common hormonal disorders such
as an overactive or underactive thyroid, Stagnaro-Green said.
   ``It really has nothing to do with the hormonal balance,'' he
said. ``The only way to tell whether these auto-antibodies are
present is through a blood test.''
   In the study, researchers at Mount Sinai screened 552 women from
seven obstetric practices in New York during their first trimester
and found that 108, or 19.6 percent, tested positive for thyroid
auto-antibodies. The rest tested negative.
   Researchers then collected information on whether the women
carried the pregnancy to full term. Of the 492 women available for
follow-up, 10.2 percent suffered a miscarriage.
   The report said that 8.4 percent who tested negative for the
auto-antibodies miscarried. Seventeen percent, or twice the rate,
miscarried among women who had tested positive for the
auto-antibodies, the report said.
   Stagnaro-Green said further studies would have to verify his
results, and to determine a cause-and-effect.
   A doctor not associated with the study agreed.
   ``The results of this study are certainly interesting, but also
need to be looked at with caution,'' said Dr. Elliot Main, an
assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology who runs a
reproductive immunology lab at the University of California, San
Francisco.
   Main said the incidence of women who tested positive for the
auto-antibodies - nearly 20 percent - was high.
   ``One should always be suspicious when that large a share of a
group that is otherwise normal reflects an abnormality,'' he said.
``They could suggest some false positives.
   Main also said a study needs to address the question of whether
the process of miscarrying somehow leads to the development of
auto-antibodies, rather than the other way around.

   Genetic Defect Spotted

   In 3-Day-Old Embryo

   RESEARCHERS diagnosed a genetic defect in a three-day-old mouse embryo in an experiment directly applicable to humans.

   Prenatal diagnosis of genetic defects as early as the sixth week of pregnancy is increasingly common today.
But the mouse experiment at a Medical Research Council laboratory in London shows genetic defects can be detected three days after conception using a new American-developed gene-copying technique.

   The experiment, applicable to many genetic disorders, involved beta-thalassemia, a severe blood anemia resulting from a missing hemoglobin gene.
It's an inherited human disorder that's been duplicated in mice.
In the experiment, mice with the defective gene were mated.
Three days later, before the new embryo had become implanted in the uterus, it was washed out of the mother mouse.
The embryo had progressed only to a clump of eight identical cells.
One cell was teased out, and its DNA extracted.

   Using the new technique developed by Cetus Corp., called the polymerase chain reaction, the scientists rapidly made millions of copies of the section of DNA that ordinarily contains the hemoglobin gene, providing enough copies to test.
A genetic probe showed the hemoglobin gene was missing, the researchers report in the medical journal Lancet.

   In the report, two molecular biologists suggest such embryo diagnosis can be used by couples at high risk of passing a genetic defect to a child.

   For example, infertile couples who have the woman's eggs fertilized in the test tube usually have several eggs fertilized at a time.
When the fertilized cells divide to eight cells, a single cell from each embryo can be tested for genetic defects.
A healthy embryo can be picked for implantation and defective ones discarded.

   Or in other couples, the embryo could be temporarily taken out and tested three days after conception and returned if healthy, or discarded if not.

   Yeast Adapted to Make

   Gene-Spliced Drugs

   AN OIL COMPANY finds a sideline in the microscopic world of yeast.

   In the early 1970s, when the "world food crisis" was a major worry, Phillips Petroleum Co., like several other big companies, began developing "single-cell protein," edible protein made by microbes feeding on non-edible materials.
Phillips found and improved a yeast, "Pichia pastoris," which made protein from natural gas-derived alcohol.
It also could convert glucose from farm wastes into edible protein.
Single-cell protein never panned out, and most companies abandoned such research.

   But Phillips persisted, calling in scientists from the Salk Institute.
They've now adapted the yeast to making genetically engineered drugs.
Like the bacteria used by genetic engineers, the yeast can take in human genes and churn out human proteins for medical use.
But the yeast genetic apparatus is more like that of animals than the bacterial genetic apparatus.
Thus, the proteins from the yeast are molecularly more like human proteins than those from bacteria.

   The oil company claims its yeast system also is better than bacteria at high-volume production of genetically engineered drugs.
Chiron Corp., an Emeryville, Calif., biotechnology firm, is seeing if the Phillips yeast can be used to make its genetically engineered human proteins.

   Peeking Inside Arteries

   From Outside the Body

   VISUALIZING BLOOD vessels without poking catheters into the body may come out of research at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories.

   Strokes, heart attacks, leg pains (intermittent claudication) and other problems stem from clogging of the arteries by cholesterol-rich deposits.
At present, doctors can see how badly an artery is clogged only by inserting a thin catheter into the artery and injecting a fluid that makes the arteries visible on X-rays.

   A non-invasive method is being researched by biophysicist Lynn Jelinski at the AT&amp;T unit.
It relies on the fact that certain atoms give off detectable signals when subjected to an intense magnetic field.
It's the same phenomenon used in the new MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanners being used in hospitals in place of X-ray scans.

   In the Bell Labs experiments, an MRI-type of machine, synchronized with the heartbeat via an electrocardiogram, rapidly flashes a magnetic field on and off as blood passes a certain point in a vessel.
The rapidly flashing return signals from excited hydrogen atoms in the blood give a "stop-motion" movie of the blood-filled vessel, (like the "stop-motion" seen in disco dancers when a strobe light is flashing).

   The scientists have experimented on the tiny neck arteries of rats.
They've been able to measure the minuscule movements of the artery wall as the beating heart raises and lowers the pressure of the flowing blood, a first for such tiny blood vessels, they report in Nature, a scientific journal.
They now are experimenting with measuring blood flow.
The ultimate hope is that the technique could identify diseased vessels.

   A new technique that allows diagnosis of
inherited diseases in an unfertilized human egg before conception
is being described as an important step toward the prevention of
genetic diseases.
   On Friday, researchers reported that they had diagnosed cystic
fibrosis in a human egg before conception. They said the technique
could be used with many other inherited ailments, including
muscular dystrophy, hemophilia and sickle cell anemia.
   The technique could satisfy some abortion opponents' objections
to fetal diagnosis, said Yury Verlinsky, director of the
Reproductive Genetics Institute at Illinois Masonic Medical Center
in Chicago.
   These diseases can now be diagnosed in the fetus before birth.
But such diagnosis often leaves the parents with no option but to
terminate the pregnancy if the fetus carries the disease.
   The new technique of pre-conception diagnosis makes abortion
unnecessary, Verlinsky said in a telephone interview.
   ``I feel it's going to be the technique of choice for the
families who are carriers for genetic diseases,'' he said. ``It's
better to avoid abortion and to have this technique to conceive
only a normal child.
   ``I get letters from right-to-life people who say this is good
research,'' Verlinsky said.
   Dr. Norbert Gleicher, director of the Center for Human
Reproduction at Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago, called it ``a
very, very important advance. In practical terms, this is a very
important step and a very smart concept.''
   An important limitation of the technique is that it can be used
only in conjunction with in-vitro fertilization or IVF, the
``test-tube baby'' technique in which an egg is fertilized in a
laboratory dish and the resulting embryo is implanted in the
mother's womb.
   ``IVF, which is what you're involved in, has a limited success
rate,'' said Dr. Laird Jackson, director of the division of medical
genetics at Thomas Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia.
   In other words, many eggs judged to be free of disease using
pre-conception diagnosis will fail to result in births because of
the difficulties of in-vitro fertilization.
   Nevertheless, technical advances in the future could change
that, Jackson said. And pre-conception diagnosis was clearly of
value for parents who are opposed to abortion, he said.
   Last November, Verlinsky reported the development of the new
technique at a meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics.
His report of the pre-conception diagnosis of cystic fibrosis
appears in today's issue of The Lancet, a British medical journal.
   The technique makes use of a cell called a polar body that is
discarded by an egg as it matures, Verlinsky said. An immature egg
contains a pair of each of the 23 human chromosomes.
   As the egg matures, it discards one set of chromosomes in the
polar body and retains one set. The sperm that later fertilizes the
egg imports a set of the father's chromosomes, so the fertilized
egg is back to full strength with a pair of each chromosome.
   Verlinsky analyzes the genes in the polar body to determine
whether the remaining genes in the egg carry the cystic fibrosis
defect.
   On Thursday, Dr. Alan Handyside and colleagues at Hammersmith
Hospital in London reported the first birth of children who were
examined for genetic diseases by screening test-tube embryos before
the embryos were implanted in their mothers.
   In that technique, an egg fertilized in a test tube is allowed
to divide until it forms an embryo of eight cells. One cell is
removed and analyzed for genetic defects. If the embryo is healthy,
it is implanted in the mother's womb.
   Verlinsky, who has also experimented with that technique, said
it could be used in conjunction with the pre-conception screening
in circumstances in which the pre-conception screening alone was
not enough to assure that the fetus did not carry a genetic disease.
   The research team at Hammersmith Hospital also is experimenting
with pre-conception diagnosis, Jackson said.
   The pre-conception diagnosis of cystic fibrosis currently is
limited to children of the 70 percent of cystic-fibrosis carriers
with the most common of the many genetic mutations that can cause
the disease, Verlinsky said.

<HEAD>Improved Down's Syndrome Test Found More Accurate, Safer, Cheaper</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new screening test that is more accurate,
safer and far less expensive than existing ones for prenatal
detection of Down's syndrome could be available for widespread use
in two or three years, researchers say.
   If the test were given to every pregnant woman in the United
States, it could catch 60 percent of the estimated 5,000 cases that
occur annually, compared with the maximum 20 percent detection rate
possible with existing tests, the researchers say.
   Down's syndrome is the nation's most common disorder of the
chromosomes _ the microscopic threads in each cell that carry
genes, which govern hereditary characteristics.
   Down's syndrome is characterized by mental retardation, a broad
face and slanting eyes.
   The existing test uses a procedure called amniocentesis, in
which a small amount of the amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus is
withdrawn and fetal cells in the fluid are examined for the
presence of chromosomal defects.
   The procedure costs about $1,000 and leads to miscarriages in
about one in 200 mothers who receive it, doctors said.
   The new test, done by measuring the levels of three substances
in the mother's bloodstream, identifies women at highest risk of
having children with Down's syndrome, said one of the authors of
the study, Jacob Canick, a biochemist at Brown University and Women
and Infant's Hospital, both in Providence, R.I.
   The other authors include Dr. James Haddow of the Foundation for
Blood Research in Scarborough, Maine, and Dr. Nicholas Wald of the
Medical College of St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London.
   In the absence of such a test, doctors assess risk based only on
the mother's age _ the older the mother, the higher the risk. The
new test provides a much more accurate assessment of risk, Canick
said in a telephone interview Friday.
   The researchers measured three substances to assess risk:
alpha-fetoprotein, estriol and human chorionic gonadotropin, all
made by the fetus or placenta and carried in the mother's
bloodstream. Risk of Down's syndrome was linked to low levels of
alpha-fetoprotein and estriol and high levels of human chorionic
gonadotropin in the mothers' blood, said Haddow.
   The test will probably cost $50 to $60, and because it is a
simple blood test done on the mother it carries no risk of
miscarriage, Canick said.
   In the study, the test was done on mothers during the second
trimester of pregnancy, when amniocentesis is usually performed.
   Prenatal detection of a birth defect could lead a physician to
recommend abortion.
   In a study reported in the current issue of the British Medical
Journal, Canick and his colleagues found that the test was accurate
enough to enable doctors to detect 60 percent of all cases of
Down's syndrome in the United States if it were given to all
pregnant women.
   Amniocentesis is now recommended for pregnant women over age 35.
If it were given to all of them it would identify only 20 percent
of Down's syndrome cases, Canick said.
   Dr. Aubrey Milunsky, director of Boston University's Center for
Human Genetics, said of the findings: ``There is every likelihood
that this order of efficiency or detection will be attainable. It's
likely to be an extremely valuable screening method for prenatal
detection for not only Down's syndrome,'' but also other chromosome
disorders.
   Milunsky, who was not connected with the study, said he will
shortly publish his own study in the American Journal of Obstetrics
and Gynecology showing that similar testing can be effective as
early as the eighth to 12th week of pregnancy.
   In May, researchers announced that a government study found that
another method of determining chromosome abnormalities in a fetus
as early as the eighth week of pregnancy was safe and accurate.
   The technique is called chorionic villus sampling. Using a
special device, a doctor snips off a tiny piece of chorionic villus
tissue, which grows from an enveloping membrane that eventually
gives rise to the placenta. The tissue, which is genetically
identical to the fetus, is then tested for abnormalities.

<HEAD>Study: Ultrasound Can Replace Amniocentesis for Finding Birth
Defects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ultrasound scans on pregnant women can accurately
detect spinal abnormalties and other severe birth defects without
raising the risk of miscarriage the way amniocentesis does, a study
today concludes.
   When blood tests signal the possibility of spina bifida and
other serious problems, doctors routinely perform amniocentesis, a
test that removes amniotic fluid for analysis. This technique is
generally safe but carries a small risk of triggering miscarriage.
   The new research suggests that ultrasound, which uses sound
waves to take pictures of the fetus and carries no known risk, is
also a highly accurate way of checking for these birth defects.
   ``We may have to modernize our way of thinking,'' said Dr. Beryl
R. Benacerraf, a co-author of the study. ``I wouldn't say that
nobody has to have amniocentesis. But women can choose. They need
to be involved in the decision and given the odds.''
   Pregnant women are frequently given a blood test to check for
elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein. While many things can cause
this protein to be higher than normal, there is a 1 percent chance
that it means the baby has a defect.
   To make sure the fetus is healthy, doctors frequently withdraw a
sample of amniotic fluid with a needle to see if it, too, contains
elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein. Its presence may indicate
spina bifida, abdominal wall malformations and other serious birth
defects.
   In the study, researchers found that if a woman has an elevated
alpha-fetoprotein level and a normal ultrasound scan, there is a
less than one-tenth of 1 percent chance that her baby will have
defects associated with the protein.
   However, if she opts for amniocentesis, there is a half of 1
percent risk that the test itself will terminate the pregnancy.
   Dr. Allan S. Nadel, principal author of the study, noted that
some women may still want to rule out the slight risk of a birth
defect, even if that might also pose a small risk of losing their
pregnancy.
   The study was conducted at Brigham and Women's Hospital in
Boston and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   Doctors reviewed the ultrasound findings of 51 fetuses with
spina bifida and related abnormalities that were delivered or
aborted at the hospital. In every case, ultrasound had correctly
identified the birth defects.
   However, the doctors cautioned that ruling out these defects
requires sophisticated ultrasound equipment in the hands of doctors
who are well trained in its use. They said this expertise is
available in most large medical centers.
   Amniocentesis is also frequently recommended for pregnant women
over age 35 to check for Down's syndrome. Ultrasound is not
routinely used to screen fetuses for this birth defect.

   A woman fighting for control of seven
frozen embryos in an unprecedented divorce case on Thursday was
awarded temporary custody by a judge who ruled that life begins at
conception and the woman should be allowed to carry them to term.
   Blount County Circuit Judge W. Dale Young, ruling in favor of
Mary Sue Davis over her estranged husband, Junior Lewis Davis,
declared that their embryos were children not property.
   ``I'm thrilled. It's definitely what I wanted,'' Mrs. Davis told
a news conference in Titusville, Fla., where she now lives.
   Davis said he would appeal in the state court system, and
potentially beyond. ``They are going to force me to become a father
against my wishes,'' he said.
   Mrs. Davis said she would not try to get pregnant immediately.
``I'm waiting to see about the appeal then hopefully after that try
to have a child,'' she said. ``I could (try) at any time, but I have
to recover from all of this and then consider starting the program.''
   She added that the earliest she would try to get pregnant was
January.
   ``As far as we are aware, this is the first judicial decision
which has declared an embryo a human being,'' said Charles Clifford,
Davis' attorney, adding that he would ask the court to prevent Mrs.
Davis from implanting the embryos until appeals are settled.
   Clifford said the ruling could conflict with the Supreme Court's
landmark Roe vs. Wade decision allowing women to have abortions.
Janet Mayfield, the attorney who will handle Davis' appeal, said the
decision might also conflict with state laws on property interests
and anatomical gifts.
   The case grew out of the decade-old technology of ``test-tube
babies,'' or in-vitro fertilization. The Davises became embroiled in
the dispute after they were unable to have children and turned to in
vitro fertilization.
   The couple produced nine embryos in December under the guidance
of Dr. I. Ray King at a Knoxville clinic. Two were implanted in Mrs.
Davis but failed to develop. The others were put in cold storage.
But then, Davis sued for divorce in February.
   During testimony in August, Davis, 31, said he would feel ``raped
of my reproductive rights'' if Mrs. Davis were allowed to implant
the embryos without his consent.
   Mrs. Davis, 29, argued the embryos represent her best chance of
becoming a mother. She contended that Davis was seeking a right not
normally given to a man _ whether a child should be born after he
has fertilized the egg of his mate.
   After declaring the four- to eight-cell embryos to be children,
Young in effect treated the case like a custody dispute, in which
the overriding concern is the best interest of the child.
   ``From fertilization, the cells of a human embryo are
differentiated, unique and specialized to the highest degree of
distinction,'' the judge said. Thus, he said, ``human life begins at
conception.''
   Young said Mrs. Davis could have temporary custody so that she
could have the eggs implanted in her womb in hopes of becoming
pregnant. Child support, visitation and final custody will be
decided if a birth results, he wrote.
   ``It was the toughest decision of my life as a judge,'' Young
said in an interview. ``On a scale of 1 to 10, it was a 10. I have
agonized over it.''
   Young's ruling relied on a 1988 federal appeals court decision
from Florida affirming the reliability of DNA profiling in
determining a person's individuality _ ``that the life codes for
each special, unique individual are resident at conception and
animate the new person very soon after fertilization occurs.''
   The judge said the Roe vs. Wade decision was ``in directly the
opposite direction'' from Davis vs. Davis. ``Everything the court
said in Roe vs. Wade dealt with the constitutionality of abortion
statutes,'' he said. ``That issue was not before this court.''
   But Clifford said the Roe decision ``contains some explicit
language that says that a fetus, which of course is much further
along than an embryo, is not a human being for the purposes of the
United States Constitution.''
   Regina Smith, executive director of the Pro-Life Council of
Connecticut, called the court's decision ``a victory for unborn
children.''
   Ellen Clayton, an associate professor of law and pediatrics at
Vanderbilt University, called the ruling ``a disaster ... that could
have implications on in vitro research and abortion.''
   In the in vitro process, eggs are extracted surgically from a
woman's body and mixed with sperm in a laboratory dish. Those that
are fertilized can be implanted in the womb. Testimony indicated the
success rate for the procedure averages about one in five.
   The Davises' divorce is not yet final. In his ruling Thursday,
Young instructed Mrs. Davis to file final papers that would complete
the proceeding. The couple did not contest other issues such as
division of household property.

<HEAD>Arteries May Produce Signals Leading To Clogged Arteries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deposits that clog the body's arteries,
contributing to heart disease and other problems, may result in
part from hormones produced by the arteries themselves, new
research suggests.
   ``Our results illustrate that the cells of the blood vessel wall
are not mere bystanders in disease of the blood vessel wall but can
play an active role by secreting important hormones,'' says Dr.
Peter Libby of Tufts University.
   Deposits on the artery walls contribute to heart attacks, high
blood pressure and other circulatory problems. These deposits,
known as plaque, are made of fat as well as overgrowth of smooth
muscle cells.
   The new research shows that muscle cells taken from plaques
produce a powerful hormone, platelet-derived growth factor, that
stimulates the muscle cells to grow. If so, arteries may become
clogged because their cells are both producing this hormone and
responding to it by growing. Why is still unclear.
   Platelet-derived growth factor was first isolated from
platelets, blood cells that help to form clots. However, research
has shown that other cells can also make this hormone.
   The study, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, was
conducted on cells in test tubes. Researchers say cells in the body
may act differently.

<HEAD>Mountain Lions Are Surrogate Moms For 10 Wildcat Embryos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experts hope surrogate mothers will
help save the endangered Florida panther.
   The implantation of 10 embryos _ one of them half panther _ in
two Texas mountain lions, marks the second use of in vitro
fertilization in cats, says Tom Logan of the state Game and
Freshwater Fish Commission. ``The success rate for the procedure in
humans is about 17 percent. Since it's only been done to one other
cat, and since that was only a month ago, there's no way of telling
what the odds are for our two surrogate mothers.''
   Researchers mixed 50 eggs from three Texas mountain lions with
sperm from a Florida panther and two mountain lions to get the
embryos, which were implanted June 3 by Dr. Melody Roelke at the
University of Florida veterinary school.
   ``We should be happy if even one embryo is carried to full term
and is born,'' said Roelke, of the Florida Panther Reintroduction
Project. Pregnancies in the cats are 93 days long.
   Mountain lions are used because they are nearly identical
biologically to panthers and because wildlife laws forbid the use
of endangered animals in any experimental program. Experts believe
no more than 30 panthers remain.
   The first in vitro attempt was last month at the National Zoo,
Logan said. That involved a leopard cat, said Roelke.

   Fetal brain tissue implanted in two Swedish
Parkinson's disease patients appears healthy six months after
surgery, and a University of Colorado researcher says that may
signal new hope for sufferers of the disease.
   The two transplants are believed to be the first monitored
closely enough to produce scientifically reliable results, said Dr.
Barry J. Hoffer, professor of pharmacology at the University of
Colorado Health Sciences Center and part of an international team
responsible for the clinical trials.
   Hoffer said it's too soon to tell if the tissue transplanted
late last year will produce noticeable improvement in the
recipients, two middle-aged women in advanced stages of the
neurological disorder that affects 500,000 Americans.
   Parkinson's is a progressive destruction of nerve cells. Victims
suffer tremors and increasing muscle stiffness until they cannot
move normally.
   In the experimental therapy, a small cluster of brain tissue is
removed from an aborted fetus and injected into the patient near
the base of the brain. In animals, the fetal cells develop into
nerve cells that produce dopamine, a central nervous system
transmitter that Parkinson's disease patients lack.
   The use of fetal tissue has sparked controversy in anti-abortion
circles.

<HEAD>Researchers Closing In On Alcoholism Gene</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers say they're on the trail of a gene
that could lead to a blood test to identify people vulnerable to
alcoholism.
   A study of 30 families, each with at least two alcoholic male
siblings, showed a possible link between alcoholism and the MNS
blood group, a genetic marker determining blood type, says Shirley
Y. Hill of the University of Pittsburgh's Western Psychiatric
Institute &amp; Clinic.
   ``Eventually, we may be able to screen people and tell them how
great their risk is of being an alcoholic,'' Ms. Hill says.
   Among members of any one family, the alcoholics' MNS blood group
had similarities not apparent among the blood group in the
non-alcoholics, she says. ``We don't know what the gene is. It
could be a gene that affects the way people react to alcohol, the
way the brain reacts. It could be a gene that's important in
developing a compulsive personality.''
   Research points to the existence of such a gene, but not its
location. Studies show that children of alcoholics face four times
the risk of becoming alcoholics themselves, even when separated
from the alcoholic parents at birth and adopted by a non-alcoholic
mother and father, Ms. Hill says.
   The findings are to be published in the journal Alcoholism:
Clinical and Experimental Research.

   Two women who received fertilized eggs in their
fallopian tubes through a new non-surgical procedure have produced
the nation's first births to result from that technique.
   The procedure involves guiding a tube through the cervix to the
fallopian tube, where it deposits two or three fertilized eggs.
   It is called non-surgical ZIFT, for zygote intrafallopian
transfer. Previously, the fertilized eggs were deposited through
surgery and general anesthesia.
   The new non-surgical approach is less expensive and can be done
more often to establish pregnancy, Ricardo Asch of the University
of California, Irvine said Wednesday.
   One girl was born April 9 by normal delivery, according to a
university spokeswoman. One girl was delivered by Caesarean section
on April 12, according to the Genetics &amp; IVF Institute of Fairfax,
Va.
   The second girl was premature at 36{ weeks, but was pronounced
healthy soon after birth, the institute said. The girl and her
mother are doing well now, institute director Joseph D. Schulman
said Wednesday.
   Asch said putting fertilized eggs in the fallopian tube, rather
than in the uterus as is done with standard in-vitro fertilization,
gives them a better environment for development.
   ZIFT is a variant of GIFT, or gamete intrafallopian transfer, in
which unfertilized eggs and sperm are put into the fallopian tube
to achieve fertilization there.
   Asch said ZIFT is preferable to GIFT if the prospective father
shows a low sperm count or if the woman has proteins called
antibodies that can attack the father's sperm.
   Schulman estimated that only about 20 percent to 30 percent of
women who go to an in-vitro fertilization center are candidates for
GIFT or ZIFT, because those procedures require that the fallopian
tubes not be damaged.
   Martin M. Quigley, president of the Society for Assisted
Reproductive Technology, said Wednesday he did not know of any
previous American births from non-surgical ZIFT.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Technology: Concepts for a fertile market - Many drug
companies have stopped developing contraceptives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Contraceptives have become a Cinderella subject for pharmaceutical research.
No fundamentally new techniques have been developed since the 'pill' 30
years ago, and even the long-term contraceptives recently introduced in the
US and some European countries - Depo-Provera injections and Norplant
implants - originated in the 1960s.
At last month's Population Summit, held in India by the world's scientific
academies, Kerstin Hagenfeldt of Stockholm's Karolinska Hospital estimated
that global funding of contraceptive R&amp;D amounts to just Dollars 57m (Pounds
41m) a year, of which governments and non-profit organisations provide 61
per cent and pharmaceutical companies 39 per cent. This is little more than
2 per cent of worldwide contraceptive sales (worth between Dollars 2.6bn and
Dollars 2.9bn a year).
'Many large pharmaceutical firms that in the 1960s and 1970s played an
active and essential role in developing contraceptive products have stopped
their activities in this area in the last decade,' Hagenfeldt said.
The world contraceptive market is currently dominated by four companies:
Johnson &amp; Johnson and American Home Products of the US, Schering of Germany
and Akzo of the Netherlands.
Reasons put forward for the industry's diminishing research activity include
more stringent regulatory requirements than for any other type of drug, a
risk of expensive product liability lawsuits of the sort that drove the
Dalkon Shield manufacturer A H Robins to bankruptcy in 1986, and opposition
to contraception by the Roman Catholic church and other religious groups.
'Contraceptive development is difficult in the sense that you're dealing
with products that may be used by perfectly healthy people over many years.
They therefore have to be extremely safe and effective,' says Hans Vemer,
international medical director of Organon, Akzo's pharmaceutical subsidiary.
The basic principle of hormonal contraception is to use synthetic sex
hormones (oestrogens and/or progestogens) to suppress ovulation. The
hormones also thicken the cervical mucus, making it more difficult for sperm
to enter the uterus, and thin the endometrium (lining of the womb) so that a
fertilised egg is unlikely to implant and grow.
Although today's contraceptive pills work in fundamentally the same way as
their forerunners 30 years ago, they contain a different balance of hormones
in lower doses. The standard 'combined pill' now has only 30 micrograms of
oestrogen, compared with 150 micrograms in the 1960s. There is also a range
of 'multi-phasic pills' in which the doses change during the month.
Long-term clinical studies sponsored by the World Health Organisation show
that the pill is safe, despite the health scares of the 1980s - so safe
indeed there are moves in the US to permit the dispensing of oral
contraceptives without a prescription. The pill may slightly increase the
risk of developing breast cancer and heart disease, but it has a protective
effect against some cancers of the reproductive system. Long-term use
reduces the chance of developing ovarian cancer by 40 per cent.
Oral contraceptives are highly effective at preventing pregnancy when taken
regularly but they are liable to fail through forgetfulness or gastric
upsets. Therefore, researchers have been working since the pill's
introduction on more reliable ways of administering contraceptive hormones.
The two injectable contraceptives in worldwide use today, Depo-Provera and
Noristerat, were invented in the 1960s. They are prescribed extensively in
some developing countries, but health concerns and political controversy
have kept them off the market in several industrialised countries. The US
finally approved Depo-Provera last year after its manufacturer, Upjohn, won
a 25-year battle to convince the Food and Drug Administration it was safe.
Depo-Provera contains tiny crystals of progestogen suspended in a
water-based solution which is injected every three months into the muscle of
the buttocks or arm. The hormone leaches slowly into the bloodstream from
the crystals. Its failure rate - about two pregnancies per 1,000 women per
year - is considerably lower than the pill.
More recently, WHO has sponsored the development of two monthly injectable
contraceptives, Mesigyna and Cyclofem, which contain a combined low dose of
oestrogen and progestogen. They avoid the main side-effect of Depo-Provera -
irregular menstruation. Both are being manufactured locally in several
developing countries.
Norplant, an implant to prevent pregnancy for up to five years, was designed
in the 1960s by the Population Council, a charity based in New York, and
developed during the 1970s by Leiras, a contraceptive manufacturer in
Finland. They are licensing it for sale by various international drug
companies. It was launched in the US two years ago by American Home Products
and in the UK last month by Roussel of France.
Norplant consists of six flexible rubber rods, each about the size of a
matchstick, which are inserted (under local anaesthetic) beneath the skin of
the upper arm. They release progestogen at a steady rate into the
bloodstream. If the woman wants to conceive, the capsules are removed.
According to Hemant Shah, a US pharmaceutical analyst, Norplant sales shot
up from Dollars 50m in 1991 to Dollars 140m in 1992, but are likely to fall
to about Dollars 110m in 1993. The decline is not a sign of disenchantment
but a result of Norplant's long-term action; the women most enthusiastic
about the implant had it fitted last year. However, some state authorities
have aroused controversy by allegedly putting unfair pressure on teenagers
from deprived and minority backgrounds to accept Norplant.
Several second-generation implants are in clinical trials and are expected
to reach the market before the end of the century. One is Norplant II, which
has two rods rather than six. Another is Implanon, a single rod system
developed by Organon, which provides two to three years of reliable
contraception; it is injected under the skin with a hypodermic syringe.
Vaginal rings are a third type of long-acting contraceptive undergoing
clinical trials. They release hormones slowly through the skin of the
vagina. Candidate rings have been developed by Organon, the Population
Council and WHO. Unlike implants and injections, they can be inserted or
removed by the user without professional help.
Another technique, pioneered by Leiras, is to combine hormonal contraception
with the intra-uterine device. Its Levonova IUD, recently approved for sale
in three Scandinavian countries, releases very low doses of progestogen
directly into the uterus for up to five years.
All today's contraceptive drugs - as opposed to barrier methods such as
condoms which are not covered in this article - are based on hormones. An
entirely different approach is to produce a birth control vaccine, by
inducing the immune system to immobilise either sperm or eggs or one of the
hormones that are essential for human reproduction.
Six contraceptive vaccines with various mechanisms of action are in the
early stages of clinical trials, although the safety and efficacy
requirements are so stringent that none will be available commercially until
the next century.
The immunological approach could produce a safe male contraceptive - and
satisfy complaints that all products so far, apart from the condom, have
been aimed at women.
'Since a man produces millions of spermatozoa at a time, it is far more
difficult to develop an adequate oral or hypodermic contraceptive for men,'
says Willem Bergink, director of Organon's fertility research programme.
'But we know some women are infertile because they produce antibodies
against sperm.' The solution may be to make men produce antibodies against
their own sperm.

   Condom instructions written in Spanish are too
complex to be understood by many Hispanics in the United States, a
researcher says.
   ``The use of condoms has assumed a prominent role in the national
strategy for prevention of AIDS, particularly in high-risk Hispanic
communities in the Northeast,'' said Robert O. Valdez, an assistant
professor of public health at the University of California, Los
Angeles.
   ``Yet a number of Hispanics are not literate in English or
Spanish. The result is a public health dilemma because many Hispanic
people are unable to read information such as condom instructions,''
he said.
   Only 13 of 25 condom brands purchased in Los Angeles included
instructions in Spanish, and all of those ``required reading ability
at the ninth- to 11th-grade level, which is well above the average
for most Hispanics in the United States,'' said Valdez said.
   The study by Valdez and other researchers was published recently
in the Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences. They cited a 1976
National Chicano Survey, which found that one-third of U.S.
Hispanics between age 15 and 45 said they were illiterate in English
and nearly 40 percent in Spanish.
   An earlier UCLA study found college-level reading ability is
required to understand most condom instructions written in English.

<HEAD>Beer Bottles Are Temporary Homes In Pygmy Octopus Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pygmy octopuses usually live in shells
abandoned by other sea creatures, but a ecologist Janet Voight was
able to study the small animals by luring them into empty beer
bottles.
   ``They decided the beer bottles are just as good as shells,''
said Janet Voight, a University of Arizona doctoral student.
   Unlike the giant Pacific octopus, which weighs about 50 pounds,
the Pacific pygmy octopus weighs between three-quarters of an ounce
and 1{ ounces. It lives throughout the Gulf of California,
particularly in shell-rich northern gulf areas of Cholla Bay near
Sonora, Mexico.
   Using brown beer bottles, Voight was able to trap and study 800
octopuses during a year. She removed each animal from its bottle,
anesthetized, weighed, and measured it, and checked its reproductive
status. The octopuses then were revived and released.
   The study helped Voight determine that pygmy octopuses have a
lifespan of 5{ to eight months, increasing their weight a
thousandfold, from .00141 ounces when hatched to adult weight
averaging 1.41 ounces.
   Since they grow so rapidly, researchers are investigating using
pygmy octopuses for food, Voight said.

<HEAD>New Surgery For Tubal Pregnancies Reduces Pain, Saves Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An operation that can treat tubal pregnancy on
an outpatient basis is less painful and costly, and just as safe and
effective as major abdominal surgery usually used for the problem, a
study concludes.
   About 2 percent of all pregnancies in the United States are tubal
pregnancies, in which a fertilized egg attaches to the wall of a
Fallopian tube instead of making its way to the uterus. The fetus
will die within three months of conception but must be removed
earlier to protect the mother's health, said Dr. Michael Vermesh, an
assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University
of Southern California.
   Both surgical methods involve removing the doomed fetus through
an incision in the Fallopian tube under general anesthesia.
   In the standard surgical method, laparotomy, access to the tube
is gained through a sizable incision in the abdomen. In a
laparoscopy, a tubular viewing device called a laparoscope is
inserted through a small incision in the navel, while the surgery is
performed with instruments inserted through another tube, inserted
through a second incision just below the public hair line.
   In the USC study, 60 patients were randomly assigned to received
either laparotomy or laparoscopy. Laparotomy patients required a
three-day hospital stay and spent four weeks disabled at home;
laparoscopy patients could go home the day of surgery or a day
later, and resumed normal activities in a few days.
   ``Pain and discomfort are greatly reduced with laparoscopy,'' and
savings from shorter hospital stays averaged $1,500 per patient,
Vermesh said.
   Length of surgery, degree of complications and preservation of
fertility were about the same for both groups.
   Laparoscopy is suitable only for pregnancies in which the
Fallopian tube hasn't ruptured and the fetus is small enough _ no
more than about 1{ inches across _ to be removed through the
surgical tube, Vermesh said.
   Only a handful of medical centers offer laparoscopy for tubal
pregnancy, although the laparoscope is widely used for diagnosing
such pregnancies and other pelvic abnormalities.

<HEAD>Vaccine Works on Mice; Human Version Years Away</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists at the National Institutes of
Health say they hope laboratory experiments on mice may point the
way toward development of a long-acting contraceptive vaccine for
women.
   The researchers reported Thursday that a vaccine developed using
genetic engineering techniques produces contraception for up to
nine months in female mice.
   The contraceptive vaccine works by preventing fertilization of
eggs by sperm, rather than by interfering with development of the
fetus after conception or inducing abortions.
   Findings from the research were published in Science, the
journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   Asked how long it will be before the work may lead to
development of a human contraceptive vaccine, researcher Jurrien
Dean said: ``Well in excess of a decade, but that's just
speculation.''
   In the meantime, he said: ``I think that it has potential
application probably in veterinary medicine and agriculture. But
our main hope, as basic scientists, is that these studies will
stimulate investigations into these types of immunologically based
contraceptive agents.''
   The researchers focused their attention on the zona pellucida, a
layer of proteins surrounding egg cells produced by the ovaries in
all female mammals. One of the proteins serves as the receptor for
the male sperm cell when fertilization occurs.
   Previous studies at NIH and elsewhere had shown that if the zona
pellucida is coated with certain antibodies _ proteins that produce
specific immune system reactions _ injected into test animals, then
sperm cannot fertilize the egg.
   In the new research, scientists used genetic engineering methods
to precisely identify the zona pellucida's molecular binding site _
a small protein known as a peptide _ for a fertilization-blocking
antibody.
   A synthetic version of the binding-site peptide then was made in
the laboratory and used to vaccinate female mice. After being
vaccinated with the peptide, the mice produced their own antibodies
serving to prevent fertilization.
   This contraceptive effect lasted up to 36 weeks in the mice used
in the NIH experiments.
   Dean said it was significant that ``this very precise (genetic)
engineering provokes a specific, focused antibody response to just
a small part of the zona protein. We believe that this may be
important in avoiding any side effects such as damage to the ovary
or to other organs.''
   Identifying the antibody binding site involved cloning the
particular genes, or segments of genetic material, which control
formation of the zona pellucida protein.
   ``It turns out that the zona genes are conserved among
mammals,'' Dean said in an interview. ``That means that very
similar genes are present in dogs, cats, cows, rats _ any mammal
you pick, including humans. And therefore, if we can work out the
strategy in a model system like mice, we might be able to transfer
those observations to other animals.''
   The mouse experiments were conducted by a six-member team led by
Sarah E. Millar of NIH's National Institute of Diabetes and
Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Dean is also affiliated with that
institute.

<HEAD>Engineered Antibody Cures Diabetes In Laboratory Mice, Says
Researcher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An engineered antibody developed to attack a
type of immune cell in the body has been shown to cure laboratory
mice of diabetes, a California researcher said Thursday.
   Dr. C. Garrison Fathman of the Stanford University Medical
Center said that in an experiment that has lasted for more than a
year his team demonstrated that a special monoclonal antibody could
block the destructive action of a T-cell lymphocyte that is thought
to play a role in causing diabetes.
   Fathman said the antibody was used in a laboratory animal called
the nonobese diabetic mouse. This type of mouse normally develops
diabetes and is bred to enable researchers to study the disease.
   Normally, he said, the mice of this strain develop diabetes
within 150 days and die within a short time.
   But in the Stanford experiment reported in the journal Science,
mice treated with the monoclonal antibody were cured of diabetes
and all but three have lived for 450 days. Two control groups of
mice that were part of the experiment died of diabetes after
receiving either none of the antibody or small doses, said Fathman.
   The scientist said that although the research is promising, it
does not offer any immediate hope of curing diabetes in humans.
Fathman said the technique must undergo studies in primates before
it could be applied to humans even on an experimental basis.
   Furthermore, Fathman said the treatment would never be
appropriate for patients who already have diabetes because by then
``the disease has gone too far in the destructive process.''
   The monoclonal antibody used in the research was developed to
attack a type of lymphocyte that has on its surface a protein
called the L3T4 marker. When injected, the antibody will seek out
and kill cells with this marker.
   Lymphocytes with the L3T4 marker are thought to be the pilot
cells in an attack on the pancreas, the organ that secretes
insulin. This lymphocyte is thought to start a cascade effect that
results in the insulin-secreting beta cells of the pancreas being
destroyed by the body's own immune system. Once the beta cells are
destroyed, the body can not produce insulin, a hormone essential
for the metabolism of sugar.
   Fathman said his team used three groups of the nonobese diabetic
mice. One group received none of the monoclonal antibody. A second
group received one large dose of the antibody. The third group
received a large dose, plus smaller weekly doses.
   The experiment began when the mice were 90 to 110 days old. At
that point, said Fathman, the destructive process that leads to
diabetes was well started, with the beta cells of the pancreas
already under attack.
   By 260 days, 80 percent of both the untreated mice and the mice
which received a single dose of the antibody were diabetic or dead.
Among the 25 mice that received weekly doses of the antibody, only
two were diabetic. Fathman said the treatment may have started too
late in the process for these two mice. A third mouse in the
treated group died later of other causes.
   All treatment was withdrawn 150 days after it started and the
fully-treated mice remain healthy.
   Fathman said in a telephone interview that the treated mice now
have passed the age of 450 days and are maintaining normal levels
of sugar in their blood, evidence that they are not diabetic.
   ``We clearly have prevented them from reverting to the diabetic
state,'' he said. ``They are cured.''
   Fathman and his co-workers reported on the experiment in
Science, the journal of American Association for the Advancement of
Science. The magazine was published Friday.

   KEYSTONE, Colo. -- While the field of AIDS research boasts
few breakthroughs these days, scientists at a meeting here
heard a report about a provocative French vaccine test, plus
a variety of new insights into treating the epidemic.
   The reports inspired hope that researchers might be able
to avoid the use of dangerous killed-virus vaccines, to find
ways to block transmission of the virus by pregnant women and
to evade the problems of toxicity and resistance to the drug
AZT. New treatment strategies, including gene therapy and
immunotherapy, also got a hearing.

<TEXT>
   The weeklong meeting earlier this month, one in a series
of annual winter symposiums held by the University of
California at Los Angeles, drew about 750 participants to
this Rocky Mountain site.
   From the Pasteur Institute in Paris came word of what may
be the first protein-based vaccine to protect a chimpanzee
against infection by the virus that causes acquired immune
deficiency syndrome. If confirmed, it will be the first time
an animal has been shielded from infection without resorting
to a killed-virus vaccine. While a success in animal tests,
killed-virus vaccines still strike many researchers as too
risky to use in uninfected humans.
   Marc Girard, a vaccine researcher at Pasteur, reported
preliminary success in a test of two chimpanzees vaccinated
with "cocktails" of synthetic protein fragments. These
cocktails, though different, included a key ingredient in
common: a synthetic protein fragment that copies a part of
the AIDS virus's outer coat that scientists think could spark
a potent immune response. It's called the "V3 loop."
   Both vaccinated animals were then exposed to live AIDS
virus. Six months later, both chimps appear to be free of
infection, according to a lymph node biopsy and PCR
gene-amplification techniques. "Whether protection against
infection was achieved, however, will not be known until the
animals have been monitored at least one year," Dr. Girard's
report cautions.
   "It's great," responded Jorg Eichberg, an animal vaccine
researcher at the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical
Research in San Antonio, Texas. "Unfortunately, (the
Pasteur's approach) is a little bit of a hodgepodge since the
animals got different things." In addition to the piece of
the V3 loop, one animal got a shot of killed virus, while the
other animal's vaccine was supplemented by other viral
proteins. Also, he noted, the control animals, which became
infected, were tested at different times.
   The next challenge will be to unravel which ingredients in
the immunizing cocktail were responsible for protecting the
animals -- a major puzzle that obscures the meaning of the
experiment for now. "But it doesn't detract from his
success," Dr. Eichberg said.
   Wade Parks of the University of Miami said 33% of the
babies born to infected mothers carry the AIDS virus. He and
others are conducting a test of AZT in pregnant women. Other
researchers noted that all pregnant women may not be equally
infectious -- an insight that could lead to a different kind
of treatment.
   Hans Wigzell of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm said
his studies of pregnant women infected with the AIDS virus
disclose that those women with the highest levels of certain
antibodies against the "loop" portion of the virus's coat
tend not to transmit the infection to their babies.
   Dr. Wigzell said he is laying the foundation for a program
to give passive immunization -- that is, infusions of
antibodies -- to expectant mothers. Dr. Wigzell added he
planned to discuss the approach with officials of the World
Health Organization. "The problem is that you probably need
(large amounts) of immunoglobulin-G," an expensive antibody
infusion, to shield the growing fetus until delivery, he
said.
   Several studies shed new light on the uses and problems of
the drug AZT. Douglas D. Richman, who discovered
drug-resistant virus strains in chronic AZT users, said his
group and others have narrowed down the cause of this
resistance to four precise mutations of a single gene that
encodes a viral enzyme, reverse transcriptase. Dr. Richman
said his lab now can screen patients using PCR technology to
detect which ones carry the resistant mutant viruses.
   The bad news is that resistance sharply curtails the
drug's usefulness after two years of AZT treatment. The good
news is that resistance doesn't extend to all other drugs in
the AZT family. Also, the new low-dose regimens and early
treatment appear to slow the emergence of drug resistance, he
added.
   The theme "less AZT is better" resounded even more
tellingly in the studies of Lawrence Corey of Children's
Hospital of Seattle. Dr. Corey said he stumbled on a
serendipitous finding while conducting a study evaluating
combination therapy of AZT and acyclovir, a herpes drug. The
combination possessed no special synergy, he found. But in a
group of patients with AIDS-related complex, or ARC, he found
the most effective AZT dose wasn't the currently favored 600
milligrams a day, but half that amount.
   To prompt a panoply of clinical improvements, including
weight gain, rises in T4 immune cells, reduced symptoms and
lower blood levels of virus, "the most effective dose of AZT
was 300 milligrams a day," he said.
   "The minimum effective dose of AZT still isn't known," he
said, admitting that his observation is far from conclusive.
But he said the findings call for a formal study comparing
300 milligrams of AZT with the current 600 milligram regimen.
   New strategies against the AIDS-linked cancer, Kaposi's
Sarcoma, or KS, may emerge from studies by Barbara Ensoli and
Robert Gallo of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda,
Md. Dr. Gallo said his experiments show that KS lesions grow
in response to the protein poured out by an AIDS virus gene
known as TAT. In the test tube, KS growth is inhibited by
adding antibodies to the TAT gene.
   Dr. Ensoli added that an anti-serum to certain natural
human growth factors, including interleukin-1 and basic
fibroblast growth factor, also curb growth of KS cells in the
laboratory. Dr. Gallo's team didn't indicate whether such
observations could lead to a practical therapy for the tumor.
Nor did he address his collaboration with a Japanese firm
believed to be developing an experimental treatment for KS.
Dr. Ensoli also declined to comment.
   Other groups developing experimental treatments were less
reticent at the Keystone meeting. Gene therapy for AIDS is
being investigated at the laboratory of W. French Anderson at
the National Institutes of Health. Richard Morgan, a member
of the Anderson team, said he is using animal tumor viruses,
stripped of their infectious powers and armed with new genes,
as a means of inducing human cells to produce a potential
host of therapeutic substances. The first such substance to
be spliced is synthetic CD4, a copy of the AIDS virus's
target site on human cells. Because synthetic CD4 can pose as
a decoy, sopping up the virus and sparing human cells, the
Anderson team is testing whether gene therapy could give
humans the ability to produce CD4 or other AIDS drugs.
   Robert Redfield of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center,
said he has used a synthetic-protein vaccine made by
MicroGeneSys Inc., West Haven, Conn., to alter the immune
response in five out of eight infected volunteers. Elevated
antibodies and immune cells were detected in the five
responsive volunteers, who also showed less decline in their
T-cells than the three who didn't respond to the treatment.
Dr. Redfield, who is working to assess prospects for eventual
immunotherapy, said the continuing trials show that patients'
immune response can be turned up without toxicity. In a
larger study of 30 patients, he hopes to "refine our
understanding" of immune regulation and disruption in
infected people.
   In another test, Joyce Zarling and her co-workers at the
Seattle-based Oncogen unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. said
they are working with a highly toxic protein derived from the
poisonous pokeweed plant. The scientists experimented with
pokeweed antiviral protein, or PAP, and aimed it at human
T-cells (one of the virus's main targets) by fusing it with a
monoclonal antibody. The team reported the protein curbs
virus production by infected cells, but spares 90% of
uninfected cells. Because the toxin is derived from a common
plant, outside observers warned that activists should eschew
home experiments: Consuming pokeweed can cause a
leukemia-like condition that can be fatal.
   San Francisco physician Marcus Conant, in collaboration
with a unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson, said a controlled study of
the immune-modulator thymopentin in 90 infected volunteers
slowed the disease process. Dr. Conant said the group
receiving a placebo experienced two cases of AIDS and two
cases of ARC, while the drug group had none. However, to
confirm validity of his findings, he said, "We need a study
in at least 800 patients." Given difficulties in recruiting
study volunteers, he said, that could be hard to do.

   Women who let sexually transmitted diseases go
untreated run the risk of dangerous pregnancies, researchers say.
   Medical investigators at the national Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta explored 22 possible problems they thought might
lead to ectopic or tubal pregnancies, in which the fetus develops
outside the womb.
   Their study is reported in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   Ectopic pregnancies occur tens of thousands of times annually,
and account for 10 percent of all U.S. maternal deaths and are a
major cause of infertility, the researchers said.
   They examined 274 cases of ectopic pregnancy diagnosed from 1935
to 1982 in Rochester, Minn., and compared the cases with 548
live-birth deliveries during the same period among similar women.
   One of four problems researchers identified more often among
women with ectopic pregnancies was previous pelvic inflammatory
disease, an infection of the upper genital tract that can result
from untreated diseases of the lower tract.
   The study's lead authors, Polly A. Marchbanks of the CDC, said a
history of venereal disease alone does not appear to increase
ectopic pregnancy risk, but appears to increase risk if it advances
to the upper genital tract.
   That means women have another good reason to seek medical help
if they think they have a sexually transmitted disease, she said.
   Other problems in women with ectopic pregnancies were previous
infertility for at least one year and having undergone reproductive
surgery of the Fallopian tubes, the researchers said.
   And they found a strong association between conception while
using an intrauterine birth control device and ectopic pregnancies.
Women who had an ectopic pregnancy were 13.7 times more likely to
have been using IUDs at the time of conception than women in the
comparison group, the study said.
   A CDC researcher not involved in the study, Dr. Nancy Lee, said
that figure is inaccurate because it compares two groups that
shouldn't be compared: women using birth control and women using no
birth control.
   In an ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized egg lodges somewhere in
the abdomen besides the womb. In 97 percent of cases, the site is
in the Fallopian tubes, where as the fetus enlarges, it can rupture
the tubes or cause severe bleeding.
   Though ectopic pregnancy is dangerous, it can now be detected
early and the pregnancy ended surgically before damage makes a
woman infertile, wrote Dr. Robert N. Taylor, in an editorial
accompanying the study.

   English schoolgirl Louise Joy Brown is about to
celebrate her 10th birthday, a milestone for her and for in vitro
fertilization, which since the girl's conception has given hope to
infertile couples around the world while also raising ethical
questions that won't go away.

   Doctors and nurses in scrub suits the colors
of sherbet wheeled another patient into the operating room for a
brief procedure placing fertilized eggs in her womb.
   Everyone involved hoped they would cling there and grow into a
pregnancy, but everyone knew they probably would not.
   The scene played out on a video monitor over the heads of
Georgeanna and Howard Jones, whose in vitro fertilization clinic
gets credit for about 400 ``test-tube babies,'' including the first
in this country.
   In a month, the woman on the screen would receive a phone call,
telling her whether or not she was pregnant. Roughly three times in
four, even at the best centers like the Jones Institute for
Reproductive Medicine at Eastern Virginia Medical School, the
answer is no.
   ``It's always hard,'' said the 77-year-old Dr. Howard, as
colleagues call him.
   ``But,'' said Dr. Georgeanna, who's 76, ``it more than
compensates when you call to say yes.''
   On Monday, it will be 10 years since in vitro technology was
proven with the birth of Louise Joy Brown in Britain, the first of
an estimated 10,000 such infants born to infertile couples around
the world.
   In vitro fertilization has become routine medicine, a
multimillion-dollar business and a catalyst of new ethical debate
with each research advance.
   At least 169 in vitro centers operate in 41 states in this
country alone, and with the proliferation have come questions that
practitioners and policy-makers are now being pressed to answer:
   _ Why isn't success more common?
   _ Are in vitro clinics and their practices adequately regulated?
   _ Why does in vitro cost so much _ $4,000 to $6,000 on average
per attempt _ and should insurance companies or taxpayers help pay
the bill?
   _ Why has the federal government maintained a de facto
moratorium on financing research?
   _ Have some clinics taken advantage of a vulnerable patient
population to make a profit?
   ``Some clinics are selling false hope,'' asserted Gary Ellis,
director of a just-completed study of infertility for the
congressional Office of Technology Assessment.
   ``A clinic knows if it has had any babies born. A clinic that
keeps admitting people in the front door and does not have any
births _ I ask you: what are they selling? They're selling false
hope.''
   He and others stressed that only a minority of clinics fell into
that category. But the vast market for infertility services _ 2
million to 3 million American couples unable to have babies _
enhances the danger of charlatanry and fraud.
   ``You can charge these people more, because they're more
desperate,'' said Gina de Miranda, who founded a consumer
protection group in Texas for infertile people after her own years
of frustration and sadness.
   ``What you've had is a whole lot of clinics opening all over the
United States with varying rates of success. And in order to break
even they've got to get more patients in and charge them as much as
they can,'' she said.
   Infertility treatments cost Americans $1 billion last year _ $66
million of that for what has become the treatment of last resort,
in vitro fertilization, according to the OTA study.
   Mrs. de Miranda, whose lobbying made Texas one of the five
states, along with Maryland, Massachusetts, Hawaii and Arkansas, to
require insurance companies to offer coverage of in vitro, advises
anyone thinking of the procedure to ask questions.
   Patients need to know more than the basics of in vitro: the
hormonal stimulation of the woman to produce more than one egg in a
month, the retrieval by doctors of as many eggs as possible, the
mixing of those eggs with the husband's sperm in a petri dish, and
the implanting of fertilized eggs, or embryos, in the uterus.
   Patients should ask, among other questions suggested by Mrs. de
Miranda's group: how long a program has been in operation, its rate
of live births, how many retrieval procedures recover a mature egg,
and how often the procedure is canceled before the embryo implant
stage.
   Success rates should be spelled out, she and others said,
stressing the need for clear definitions _ for example, a
``pregnancy'' defined early in chemical terms may never produce a
baby _ and hard numbers.
   A recent report by 41 U.S. in vitro centers claimed a combined
rate of clinical pregnancy, determined by detectable fetal
heartbeat, of 17 percent per embryo transfer. Calculating
miscarriages and other loss, the chance of having a baby after one
embryo transfer was 11 percent.
   The centers surveyed were among the nation's most successful;
scores of others still have recorded no births.
   The Jones Institute reported that 500 patients underwent 736
stimulation cycles last year. In 537 cases, embryos were
transferred. Of those, 169 clinical pregnancies occurred, or 23
percent per attempted stimulation; 29.5 percent per embryo
transfer. The miscarriage rate was 24 percent.
   Noting that even fertile couples have only a 25 percent chance
of achieving a pregnancy in any one month of trying, Howard Jones
said he's pleased with his center's total of about 400 babies to
date.
   ``It sounds so easy to do: you get an egg and get some sperm,
you put 'em together and you transfer them _ nothin' to it,'' he
said, smiling. ``In fact, it's not easy. It's a very demanding and
exacting science and art,'' to interpret sometimes contradictory
signals to harvest eggs at just the right moment of maturation.
   ``It just doesn't seem to be a technique that's easily taught
and transferable.''
   Even so, 41 states have at least one IVF center. California has
22, Texas 14 and New York 11, according to the OTA report. The nine
states without centers are Alaska, Arkansas, Idaho, Maine, Montana,
New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming.
   Waiting lists for the established centers can be as long as two
years. But the report also noted, ``nearly half (of all centers)
have yet to achieve a live birth.''
   Most centers are not-for-profit, though some are for-profit
adjuncts of research hospitals and still others operate strictly as
profit-making concerns.
   ``Who monitors the quality of care at these clinics?'' asked
Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., chairing a congressional committee hearing
last month on the proliferation of in vitro centers.
   Noting that guidelines set by a professional group, the American
Fertility Society, are voluntary, he answered his own question:
``There are no federal or state requirements for accreditation or
reporting. There is, in fact, no public accountability at all.''

   Researchers in California this week began testing a novel
therapy against a tumor-causing gene that is implicated in
particularly aggressive cancers of the breast and ovary.
   The therapy, developed by scientists at Genentech Inc. of
South San Francisco, is being administered in a clinical
trial at the University of California at Los Angeles.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the test, 20 women will receive a monoclonal antibody,
a kind of immune therapy, against an oncogene called HER2.
Oncogenes are pieces of the genetic code that go awry to
provoke cancer. This particular oncogene, normally found in
single copies in the cells of healthy people, is multiplied
20 to 40 times in the cells of cancer patients. In such
patients, the gene produces 50 to 100 times the normal amount
of a protein that stimulates unchecked growth of malignant
cells.
   Breast cancer strikes about 150,000 women in the U.S. each
year, and ovarian cancer affects an additional 20,000.
Overexpression of this HER-2 oncogene is found in about 30%
of breast and ovarian cancer cases. Often, these are cases
with the poorest prognosis, in which median survival is only
about one year, or one-sixth the life expectancy of cancer
patients who don't overproduce the gene.
   Initiation of the clinical trial follows more than six
years of collaboration by the UCLA and Genentech researchers.
   "We're excited because we're not just delivering an
antibody to tumor cells. We know this particular protein
plays a role in tumorigenesis. And we have an antibody that
appears to inhibit the tumor," said Dennis Slamon, associate
professor of medicine at UCLA and director of the Revlon/UCLA
Women's Cancer Research Program.
   Dr. Slamon, who is directing the Phase I safety trial,
helped discover the link between excessive amounts of the
oncogene and the aggressive forms of breast and ovarian
cancer.
   The monoclonal antibody, an immune system product targeted
against the HER2 protein, is designed to inactivate its
oncogenic power and inhibit the growth of cancer. The therapy
was developed by Genentech senior scientist Michael Shepard
and his co-workers, using mouse antibody. So far the
monoclonal has inhibited tumor cells in the test tube and in
mice, but this doesn't ensure success in humans.
   Use of monoclonals derived from mice has been blamed for
the generally disappointing results in human tests of such
therapies so far. With few exceptions, notably in lymphoma,
monoclonals have failed to make major inroads against human
cancer. This may be because mouse monoclonals can provoke
human beings to mount an immune reaction against the therapy,
limiting its effectiveness.
   The Genentech team, however, is working on a second
version of the therapy, rendering it more like natural human
antibodies. This is done by fusing the mouse monoclonal to a
human antibody called immunoglobulin-G. The hope is that this
second version will be able to better rally the immune system
against cancer and spark the body's own killer cells to
attack the tumor, Mr. Shepard said.
   Another problem that has thwarted progress by monoclonals
against cancer is that many other oncogenes produce their
malignant proteins deep within a cell, where it is
inaccessible to therapy. But the HER-2 protein sits exposed
on the cell surface, where it may be more vulnerable to
attack by such treatment.
   Because the initial test is a safety trial, Dr. Slamon
said the team will first determine toxicity and appropriate
dose levels of the treatment. If successful, the test would
be broadened to see whether it is effective in curbing the
cancer, he added.

<HEAD>Indianapolis Hospital Reports Twins Born With New Fertility Method</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A fertility method new to the United States
is safer and less expensive than other artificial methods, a doctor
said Thursday in announcing the birth of twins to a couple who used
the procedure.
   In peritoneal ovum sperm transfer, or POST, mature eggs are
removed from the mother's ovaries and placed along with sperm into
the peritoneal cavity, near the ends of the fallopian tubes. The
egg enters the fallopian tubes, where it is fertilized, and travels
to the uterus for the remainder of gestation.
   Unlike in vitro fertilization, the procedure can be done in a
doctor's office in less than an hour with only local anesthesia,
said Dr. Carolyn B. Coulam, medical director of the Center for
Reproduction and Transplantation Immunology at Methodist Hospital.
   With no hospitalization required, POST costs about $4,000,
compared with $6,000 for in vitro fertilization, Coulam said.
   ``The risks are remarkably less. Moreover, the costs are less,''
she said.
   The doctor said Jane and Michael Donlan of Indianapolis became
the parents of the first children conceived in the United States
under the procedure. Craig Thomas Donlan, who weighed 7 pounds 4
ounces, and his fraternal twin brother, Kyle Robert, at 6 pounds 6
ounces, were born 12 minutes apart Saturday night without
complications.
   Coulam said she believed the first children born under a similar
POST procedure were in London, based on a report of three
pregnancies there in 1987. She said she knows of no others.
   ``We are just thrilled that this procedure has helped us extend
our family and bring us these two beautiful babies,'' Mrs. Donlan
said, surrounded by her family, including a 7-year-old daughter,
Erin. ``It's just really extremely frustrating to be infertile and
not know why.''
   Coulam said Mrs. Donlan, 35, suffered from unexplained
infertility, like about 20 percent of the 3 million infertile women
in the United States. Such women may be able to bear children as a
result of the POST procedure, but it will rarely help the remaining
80 percent, Coulam said.
   ``It does require the patient to have normal fallopian tubes, so
the fallopian tubes pick up the egg and transfer it to the
uterus,'' Coulam said.
   In in vitro fertilization, the egg is fertilized by sperm in a
laboratory dish and surgically transferred to the uterus. Under a
third method, Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer or GIFT, the egg and
sperm are surgically transferred to the fallopian tubes for
fertilization, Coulam said.
   Methodist, the only hospital in the country federally approved
to use the catheter that implants the eggs and sperm in POST
procedures, has one other ongoing pregnancy and two that have
failed, including the first by the Donlans, in the past year,
Coulam said.
   Mrs. Donlan and her 42-year-old husband are computer programmers.

^Experts Say Pregnant Women Can Gain Weight Safely, Don`t Need
Vitamins</NOTE>

   Pregnant women who eat balanced diets don't
need extra vitamins and can safely gain more weight than previously
believed, according to guidelines released Wednesday by the
Institute of Medicine.
   The guidelines, based on a review of studies on nutrition, weight
gain and pregnancy, said the average woman who gains 25 to 35 pounds
during pregnancy is more apt to produce a healthy, normal-weight
baby. The study said also that, with few exceptions, vitamins and
other food supplements are of no value in pregnancy.
   In effect, said Lindsay Allen, a professor of nutrition at the
University of Connecticut, the study committee concluded that Mother
Nature may know best.
   ``Women, when they are not told to restrict their diet during
pregnancy, normally gain this amount of weight (25 to 35 pounds),''
said Ms. Allen, who was a chairman of a study subcommittee. ``What
we are doing is recognizing that dietary restriction in pregnancy is
not a good idea. Normal weight gain is better.''
   ``Evidence that the committee reviewed is the reported experience
of large groups of women,'' said Dr. Roy M. Pitkin, a UCLA
obstetrician who chaired the study committee. ``In a sense, this
brings health recommendations in line with what is actually
happening.''
   Officials in the nutritional supplement industry were uick to
dispute the committee findings that said vitamin pills were of no
value in pregnancy.
   ``This outrageously anti-health report potentially dooms
thousands of children to an early death or at best substantial
disability due to serious birth defects,'' J.B. Cordaro, president
of the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a vitamin industry
organization, said in a statement. ``This report is a recipe for
risk and the people who prepared the report must be held accountable
for any potential harm which may come from following their advice.''
   Cordaro cited studies that showed some nutrients, such as folic
acid, may reduce the risk of spina bifida and other neural tube
birth defects.
   Ms. Allen said, however, that the committee found earlier studies
to be inconclusive. Furthermore, she said, the amount of nutrient
sufficient to affect birth defect rates would be consumed in a
normal, balanced diet.
   Weight gain in pregnancy has been a major issue in medicine since
the 19th century, when physicians believed overeating led to large
babies and difficult labors. In recent years, most doctors have
followed guidelines established in 1970 by the National Research
Council that advised women to gain no more than 25 pounds during
pregnancy.
   But Ms. Allen, who gained just over 30 pounds during her own
recent pregnancy, said members of her committee studied new
statistical data that shows ``women can gain more weight and have
babies who are bigger and healthier at birth. They used this new
supporting evidence to say that weight gain should be higher than
recommended previously.''
   The report said weight gain during pregnancy should be evaluated
on an individual basis, considering the woman's height and body
type. Tall, underweight women, the study said, should gain between
28 and 40 pounds during pregnancy, while obese women should gain
only about 15 pounds. Ms. Allen said this follows a weight gain
pattern that women seen to follow naturally.
   How fast pregnant women gain weight is important. The committee
said a gain of one pound a week is best during the second and third
trimesters of pregnancy for the average woman, while overweight
women should gain at half that rate.
   ``A smooth, steady weight gain usually is an indication of an
increase in lean and fat,'' a committee statement said. ``Sudden or
erratic gain may indicate fluid retention, a possible signal of
toxemia or other problems.''
   For normal women eating balanced diets, Ms. Allen said vitamin
pills and other food supplements are not needed and could even be
hazardous.
   ``We find it irresponsible to suggest that supplements are needed
when we can't find any evidence that women taking healthy balanced
diets will gain any benefit from them whatsoever,'' she said.
``We've done a very thorough search of the literature and the data
are just not there to make a case that all women need the
supplementation of nutrients.''
   An exception is for iron pills.
   ``Supplements of 30 milligrams of ferrous iron are recommended
daily during the second and third trimesters'' for the general
population of pregnant women, the study said.
   But Ms. Allen said that even iron supplements should be used with
caution since dosages above 30 milligrams interfere with the
absorption of other essential nutrients. And Pitkin said that iron
pills during the first trimester of pregnancy can aggravate nausea.
   Ms. Allen said an excess intake of some other nutrients, such as
vitamin A, could adversely affect fetal development.
   As with weight gain, the use of supplements should be evaluated
on a case-by-case basis, the committee said.
   Ms. Allen said added nutrients may be appropriate for women who
do not eat a balanced diet, or who are carrying more than one baby,
or for women at higher risk because of tobacco, alcohol or drug
abuse.
   Ironically, the study was released a short time after Ms. Allen
and her husband became parents.
   ``I gained 31 pounds _ well within the guidelines,'' she said.
   The study was organized by the National Research Council for the
Institute of Medicine. Both are organizations affiliated with the
National Academy of Sciences, a private organization chartered by
Congress to advise on scientific issues.

   In a pioneering program begun a year ago at a
Cleveland clinic, doctors are making infertile women pregnant by
taking eggs from a volunteer donor, fertilizing them with the sperm
of the recipient's husband and implanting the eggs in the
recipient's uterus. There have been some successes and some
failures, but the director of the program says, ``We're on the
right track.''

   Two women told repeatedly they were hopelessly
infertile because they lack ovaries have become pregnant through an
anonymous egg donor program.
   To protect their privacy, the Cleveland Clinic has closely
guarded the identities of the two women, describing them only as in
their early 20s, one a housewife and another a farm wife. One lives
in Ohio, the other in another state.
   ``These are women who have been told for years and years they
would never get pregnant,'' says Dr. Martin M. Quigley, who directs
the program at the clinic. ``They were as sterile as you could
get.''
   The two women are the first successes in a program that involves
taking eggs from a volunteer, fertilizing the eggs with the sperm
of the recipient's husband and implanting the fertilized egg in the
recipient's uterus.
   ``As far as we know, we are the only people in the world that
have a voluntary, anonymous egg donor program,'' Quigley says.
   Since the program began a year ago, eight women have undergone
fertilized egg implants. In addition to the two pregnancies, four
women have failed to become pregnant so far and two are awaiting
pregnancy tests.
   ``We're on track,'' Quigley says.
   When the program was announced, the Cleveland Clinic received
500 inquiries in the first week, more than 90 percent of them from
women interested in donating eggs to infertile women.
   Unlike sperm donors for artificial insemination, ``Women's eggs
are a heck of a lot more difficult to come by than men's sperm,''
Quigley says.
   The clinic invited 68 women to go through a rigorous donor
screening program which includes a medical history, psychological
evaluation, detailed briefing on the procedure and the possible
risk and a review by an ethical expert who makes sure the donor
understands everything.
   A key part of the program, Quigley says, involves matching egg
donors and recipients to try to provide women with babies similar
in physical appearance to what they might have expected if they had
become pregnant naturally.
   ``The matching has been incredible,'' Quigley says.
   He recalls that one day one of his aides familiar with one of
the women in the matchup was able to pick out the other woman as
she waited in a cafeteria line because they looked so much alike.
   He says the screening also weeds out donors who might have
sexually or genetically transmitted diseases.
   The clinic and its staff make no promises about the type baby
that might result. A recipient consent document also warns that
``there is no guarantee the recipient will become pregnant.''
   The procedure usually takes about 20 minutes and can be
uncomfortable, Quigley says. Donors are offered a painkiller.
   The eggs are combined with the sperm and up to three of the
fertilized eggs are inserted into the would-be mother. Using more
than three at a time would increase the chances of a multiple
birth, Quigley says.
   Donors are paid $900 to $1,200 for their time involved in the
screening, subsequent blood testing and the actual egg collection.
``We're certainly not paying for eggs,'' Quigley says.
   If the recipients become pregnant, they face up to 12 weeks of
hormone treatments because they lack the ovaries needed to control
the hormonal body changes required to maintain a pregnancy.``We
have to maintain the pregnancy artificially,'' Quigley says.
   Lori Andrews, an expert on reproductive law with the American
Bar Foundation in Chicago, says ``we could see a case'' in which a
woman who donated eggs as part of her own attempt to become
pregnant through in vitro fertilization might sue for visitation
rights with a baby created with her donor eggs.
   But Quigley's program faces less risk of such legal problems,
she says, because donors are volunteers who are paid only for their
time and effort. He said they have no hope themselves of becoming
pregnant through in vitro fertilization.
   The only law in the nation regulating egg donations was enacted
in Louisiana to prohibit payments to a donor, Ms. Andrews says.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Infertility is a problem among aging, wildborn
gorillas, and few zoo gorillas were born in the wild. By adapting a
human artificial fertilization technique for use on wildborn
gorillas, scientists hope to expand the genetic pool and guard
against inbreeding.

   Becky and Mimbo have the same
problems as many infertile couples, but theirs have greater
ramifications: They represent a possible threat to their species.
   Infertility among aging, wildborn gorillas prompted specialists
to adapt a human artificial fertilization technique for use on
Becky, a lowland gorilla at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in Colorado
Springs.
   ``The hope is to have a diverse genetic pool so the gorillas
don't become inbred, by managing the population to the maximum
genetic representation of all captive gorillas,'' says Dr. Paul
Calle, Cheyenne Mountain Zoo veterinarian.
   ``If three of 10 gorillas are responsible for 80 percent of the
offspring, the contribution of the others get lost over time.''
   Estimates by experts on the wild gorilla population range from
10,000 to 70,000.
   Only 15 percent to 20 percent of the 297 captive gorillas in
North America are wildborn, or of the foundation stock for carrying
on the bloodline. Experts say many of them are reaching the end of
their reproductive years.
   Such is the case with Becky, 32, and Mimbo, 26, who have just one
surviving offspring.
   The Denver and Cheyenne Mountain zoos are working under a
two-year grant from the Institute of Museum Services. Last
September, they assembled a team including zoo veterinarians, an
infertility specialist and a reproductive physiologist to perform
Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer (GIFT) on Becky. It was the first
reproductive procedure ever tried on a gorilla, according to Dr.
Richard Cambre, a Denver Zoo veterinarian.
   Becky did not become pregnant, but the surgery did provide
information on the gorilla's reproductive system that could increase
the chances for success when she undergoes the procedure again.
   Similarities in the reproductive systems of humans and gorillas
make gorillas likely candidates for artificial fertilization
techniques such as GIFT, says Dr. William Yee, a University of
California at Irvine infertility specialist who performed Becky's
surgery.
   ``We learned that, like in humans, gorillas respond
differently,'' Yee says. ``It seemed (Becky's) eggs were not mature
enough.
   ``In the normal process of reproduction, after the egg is
released, the Fallopian tube picks up the egg from the ovary. Inside
the Fallopian tube is where fertilization occurs.
   ``With Gamete IntraFallopian Transfer, we're placing the eggs and
sperm inside the tube so when we're finished, we're assured the egg
and sperm are present in the spot where fertilization occurs.''
   GIFT has a live birthrate of 25 percent among women, compared
with 17 percent with in-vitro fertilization, he says.
   Similar efforts have been made at the Dallas Zoo, where three
gorillas have undergone unsuccessful reproductive surgeries
following Becky's, says Naida Loskutoff, a Ph.D. candidate at Texas
A&amp;M who participated in Becky's procedure.
   Eggs were collected for future artificial inseminations from a
32-year-old and a 17-year-old physically unable to bear offspring.
The third, like Becky an infertile female in her 30s, was
artifically inseminated, Loskutoff says.
   Conservationists find the prospect of apparently infertile
gorillas producing offspring encouraging for the species' future.
   In cases where a species exists only in captivity, often because
of habitat destruction, zoos have crossed the line from
entertainment to conservation to ensure the species' survival,
Cambre says.
   The goal in such cases is to return the species to the wild once
survival can be ensured, he says.
   Their numbers don't place lowland gorillas among the most
endangered species, but they are among the biggest draws to zoos.
Experts say their popularity has increased since the recent film,
``Gorillas in the Mist,'' which depicts Dian Fossey's work with the
more severely endangered mountain gorilla.
   ``If you sit and watch a family of gorillas, you see a little
insight to human behavior,'' says Lester Fisher, coordinator of the
Species Survival Plan gorilla committee based at Chicago's Lincoln
Park Zoo.
   Natural breeding among captive gorilla groups is preferred over
surgical procedures, and Fisher says the natural method is proving
increasingly successful, especially among larger zoo populations.
   ``Our breeding program in our North American SSP has definitely
turned the corner,'' Fisher says.
   To that end, the SSP committee for lowland gorillas documents the
family trees of captive gorillas in North America and monitors
inter-zoo transfers of the animals to avoid inbreeding and the
subsequent loss of genetic diversity.
   ``Genetic diversity means the animals carry a variety of genes,
representing a cross-section of the population,'' Fisher says. ``In
the wild, if you have normal groups, you would have total genetic
diversity.
   ``Since we are no longer taking the animal from the wild, we are
dealing with a captive population and we have to look at a bigger
picture so we can look specifically at the problems of managing
husbandry and reproduction.''

   A study seen as ``very good news for women in
their 30s'' concludes today that those who delay motherhood until
they establish their careers face little unusual risk of delivering
premature or stillborn babies.
   The researchers did not check for Down's syndrome and other
genetic disorders _ which are more common among older women's
babies _ because virtually all the mothers underwent testing for
such problems during pregnancy.
   The study in today's New England Journal of Medicine shows that
if those in their late 30s and 40s successfully get pregnant for
the first time and avoid miscarriages, chances are good they will
have healthy children.
   The number of women delaying their first pregnancies until late
in their reproductive lives has increased dramatically. According
to federal statistics, the rate of first births among those in
their 30s has more than doubled since 1970, and among those in
their early 40s, it has increased 50 percent.
   ``Most, although not all, previous studies suggest they might be
at an increased risk of low birth weight infants and stillbirths as
well as certain other complications,'' said Dr. Gertrud S.
Berkowitz, who directed the latest study.
   ``That's why women over the age of 35 have generally been
considered to be at high risk.''
   But her study, based on 3,917 pregnancies, shows that older
women have only a slightly increased risk of producing unusually
small babies, and they are no more likely than younger first-time
mothers to deliver prematurely or have stillbirths.
   ``Overall, their data represent very good news for women in
their 30s who are contemplating their first pregnancy,'' Dr. Robert
Resnik of the University of California, San Diego, said in an
accompanying editorial.
   Berkowitz, an epidemiologist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine
in New York, said her findings should reassure women who were like
those who took part in the study _ largely white, well-educated
non-smokers who had private insurance, received prenatal care and
delivered in sophisticated medical centers.
   ``Even though this is a very unique group, it typifies women who
are delaying childbearing,'' said Berkowitz. ``By and large, it is
women who are doing it for career reasons.''
   The findings do not mean, however, that women can postpone
childbearing indefinitely and still be assured of having a baby. As
women age, they become less fertile, and even when they get
pregnant, they are more likely to have miscarriages.
   The study also showed that those older than 35 are twice as
likely as younger women to have some health complications of
pregnancy, including diabetes and high blood pressure.
   At Boston's Beth Israel Hospital, Dr. Henry Klapholz said many
doctors have come to accept that women can safely have babies into
their 40s. But, he cautioned, women over 40 may unexpectedly go
through menopause, ending all chances of pregnancy.
   ``If you are going to do it, you should do it as soon as you
can,'' Klapholz said. ``But if you want to put it off until you are
in your 30s or 40s, there is a very good chance of getting pregnant
and having a successful outcome.''
   In his editorial, Resnik said that the message of the latest
research ``is clear and highly optimistic.''
   ``Given sound genetic diagnosis and counseling, together with
appropriate prenatal care and the judicious management of labor and
delivery,'' he wrote, ``the increasing number of women postponing
first pregnancies can look forward to excellent outcomes.''
