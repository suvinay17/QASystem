<LEADPARA>  The Rose Garden, an affluent seedbed for San Jose mayors, is emerging as
prized turf for city council map makers in a debate that could jar the
political base of Councilman David Pandori.;    The neighborhood, named for a
city garden at Naglee and Dana avenues, is bounded roughly by Interstate 880,
The Alameda, Bascom Avenue and the Shasta-Hanchett area. It now straddles two
districts: Pandori's downtown and Councilwoman Nancy Ianni's Willow Glen
district.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  THORNY ISSUE OF S.J. REDISTRICTING MAY UPROOT
MAYOR-RICH ROSE GARDEN  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Pandori's chunk includes the West Hedding Street home of Mayor Susan
Hammer, who represented the district until last year. Former Mayor Janet Gray
Hayes lives close by, and other mayors have also come from the garden's
stately streets. The area is mostly white and relatively wealthy.;    With
strong support from the Rose Garden, Pandori won a very close election last
November.;    Now 1990 census data and a majority of council-appointed map
makers threaten to strip the garden from Pandori's district and substitute
heavily Hispanic Alviso. The result would unite the garden in Ianni's domain.;
   The proposed map is one of the first in San Jose's once-a-decade political
reorganization. In general, district lines must move from west to east this
year to account for swift growth in Berryessa, Alum Rock, Edenvale and
Evergreen.;    The majority's map is on view in a public hearing tonight,
along with another drafted by John Marshall Collins, an attorney Pandori named
to the redistricting panel. His map would keep Pandori's half of the Rose
Garden in the downtown district.;    Pandori would not comment. Collins could
not be reached Wednesday. Ianni said she wouldn't "speculate.";    But
Hammer's redistricting strategist, Bob Brownstein, offered this: "If I was
David, I wouldn't view this as a potentially mortal blow." Brownstein reasoned
that Pandori has plenty of time -- three-plus years -- to work with a new
constituency.;    The 11-member panel must finish a plan by mid-July. The map
will be reviewed next by a small group named by Hammer, and then the council
must vote on it. So plenty of politicking remains before a new map is
approved.;    Other key changes include extending Blanca Alvarado's Alum Rock
district up the eastern hills to Alum Rock Park and thrusting Joe Head's
Almaden district north from Blossom Hill Road to Capitol Expressway.;  IF

<LEADPARA>  The number of predominantly Hispanic city council districts in San Jose would
drop from two to one under a plan approved Thursday night by the commission
charged with redrawing political boundaries.;    Over the objections of
Councilwoman Blanca Alvarado's representative on the 2-month-old commission,
the 11-member body adopted a map that will reduce the number of Hispanics in
Councilman David Pandori's District 3 from the current 52 percent to 48
percent.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  HISPANICS MAY LOSE 1 OF 2 DISTRICTS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "I don't think we tried hard enough" to keep the district predominantly
Hispanic, said Angel Rios, the Alvarado appointee.;    But John Marshall
Collins, Pandori's commissioner, cried foul, arguing that Rios was trying to
boost the Hispanic percentage at the risk of politically splitting
long-established communities.;    "It's just race, race, race," Collins said.
"That's not the only factor here. I cannot accept it. . . . It's not the way
we do things in this country.";    The only remaining predominantly Hispanic
district would be Alvarado's District 5 on the East Side, where Hispanic
percentages would drop only slightly to 56 percent.;    One reason that the
Hispanic percentages in the two districts are decreasing is that Asian voting
power is increasing. While the percentage of Hispanics in the city grew from
23.2 to 26.6 between 1980 and 1990, the percentage of Asians increased from
8.2 to 19.5 percent.;    If the city council adopts the commission's plan,
Pandori would pick up the Alviso and North San Jose areas from District 4,
Shirley Lewis' northeast district. District 3 would also cross Highway 101 at
Santa Clara Street, a move aimed at unifying the Portuguese community on both
sides of 101.;    Under the commission's plan, Pandori will only lose a small
Rose Garden area near Park and Naglee avenues.;    At one point several weeks
ago, the commission was leaning toward handing most of Pandori's Rose Garden
constituents over to Councilwoman Nancy Ianni. But Pandori, who won a narrow
victory last November over Pete Carrillo with strong Rose Garden support, won
on that score.;    One reason that Pandori's district had to change so much
was that Councilwoman Pat Sausedo's district grew so fast during the past
decade. Decreasing the number of people in her district creates ripples
throughout the others.;    Aside from Rios -- who was supported in a letter by
Ray Villareal, Councilman Jim Beall's appointee -- the only other dissenter in
approving the final map Thursday was Collins. But the attorney said he
objected for a different reason. He thought Pandori's district had been
twisted out of shape.;    Rios' suggestion to increase the number of Hispanics
to at least 50 percent would have involved tinkering with the boundaries even
more.;    The majority of the commission eventually agreed that District 3's
lines had been redrawn enough -- and they decided to leave the Hispanic
percentage at 48 percent.;    The once-a-decade map changes will now be
reviewed by a small panel named by Mayor Susan Hammer. Then the city council
must approve it.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  SAN-JOSE; HISPANIC; GROUP; ELECTION; ZONING; CHANGE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Aided by powerhouse attorney Joaquin Avila, a Latino political action group
Thursday unveiled a new map of San Jose City Council districts that aims to
protect Hispanic voting blocs while bolstering chances a Hispanic could soon
capture the downtown seat.;    Avila has made political history in several
recent voting-rights cases, notably a successful Hispanic challenge to
Watsonville's city council electoral system.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  LATINO GROUP HAS NEW MAP
S.J. COUNCIL DISTRICTS TARGETED FOR CHANGE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The Hispanic he boosts could be Pete Carrillo, who wore several hats while
watching the City Hall news conference from the sidelines.;    Carrillo is
president of the Latino Issues Forum and an aide to Councilwoman Blanca
Alvarado, who represents the majority Hispanic Alum Rock district. He is also
a politician of no small ambition, who lost a razor-close race last November
to downtown Councilman David Pandori.;    However, Carrillo gave the
obligatory denial Thursday to suggestions of any personal political
motivations. His interest, he said, lay only with his political action group.
He said he had given no thought to running again since November.;    At least
one observer wasn't buying the disavowal.;    "They're looking for an edge
that a Hispanic candidate can get in the next election," Councilman Jim Beall
said. "And the guy that's the candidate is the head of the group.";    Once a
decade, the city must reorganize its 10 city council districts, responding to
new census data. San Jose's map-making is in the midst of a tortuous series of
hearings and revisions that will wind up in the council's lap this fall.;
The Latino Issues Forum map would make 53 percent of the downtown district
Hispanic -- a level equal to the current map but about 5 percent more than a
proposed map drawn last month by a redistricting panel appointed by city
commissioners.;    A majority of the panel argues that for the good of the
city the downtown district needs to lose some Hispanic population. But that
argument doesn't sway Avila, who gave a guest lecture last spring to the
redistricting commission. "We have a very serious problem with taking away
Latino population from (the downtown district)," said Avila, who hinted at
legal challenges if he doesn't get his way.;    Alvarado is ensconced in a 57
percent Hispanic district that is generally considered a safe Latino seat.
Avila said the downtown could reach that level in the next 10 years if it
remains intact.;    Ironically, Pandori, Carrillo's one-time opponent, is
touting another alternative to protect the Hispanic population.;    A map
drawn by Pandori's commission representative, John Marshall Collins, proposes
a 53 percent Hispanic concentration. The chief difference between his map and
Avila's is that Pandori would not put Alviso, the city's northern extremity,
in the downtown district.;    Pandori could not be reached for comment.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  SAN-JOSE; MAYOR; CITY; POLITICS; COUNCIL; MINORITY; POPULATION  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Mayor Susan Hammer on Monday announced her new political map for the 10 San
Jose City Council districts -- a plan that drew endorsements from Hispanic
leaders, muted praise from some Asians and outrage from the downtown
councilman.;   Hammer said at a news conference that she expects the council
-- which now includes one Mexican-American member and one of Hispanic and
Japanese ancestry -- will add at least two or three minority members by the
next time the map is redrawn, in 2001.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  HAMMER DRAWS PRAISE, CRITICISM IN PROPOSAL FOR
REALIGNED DISTRICTS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Hammer's map comes after other citizen-drawn maps -- including one
recommended by a council-appointed panel -- percolated through City Hall. Her
map must still be approved by the city council at a meeting Dec. 3.;   The
mayor continued to stress what has become the dominant theme of her first-year
administration: political pluralism.;   To San Jose's minority group members,
which number more than half the populace, she said, "The goal of the plan I
present to you today is to give these new voices a powerful message: The doors
of City Hall are, and will be, open to you.";   Redistricting is like
dominoes. Push one, and nine fall. In this case, Hammer pushed the downtown.
She concentrated the Hispanic population as much as possible in the district
represented by rookie Councilman David Pandori, raising the Hispanic
percentage from 52.6 percent to 55 percent and answering complaints aired last
summer by the Latino Issues Forum and its attorney, voting rights specialist
Joaquin Avila.;   This did not raise Pandori's ire. In fact, he proposed
nearly the same Hispanic percentage as Hammer -- 54.2 percent.;   What burned
him was that Hammer bumped some neighborhoods southwest of Stockton Avenue,
which he considers part of the downtown core, into a different district. Under
Hammer's plan, half the Rose Garden, Garden Alameda and College Park -- which
includes Bellarmine College Preparatory school -- would join the district
represented by Willow Glen Councilwoman Nancy Ianni.;   "They're part of the
central area, and Susan has drawn a map that ignores that fact," said Pandori,
arguing that those neighborhoods need an open door with the same council
member who represents the nearby airport and sports arena.;   Hammer, asked
about potential council critics, said: "I don't think any city council member
is threatened by it.";   Decisions on the downtown district reverberated
throughout the map. Hammer left Alviso and the industrial corridor in North
San Jose in the Berryessa district represented by Shirley Lewis, instead of
grafting it to downtown. Mayoral aides said they believed rapidly growing
North San Jose might ultimately dilute the downtown's Hispanic population.;
The consequence, some map experts said, was that Lewis' District 4 grew less
in Asian strength than it might have. District 4 will now be 37.4 percent
Asian, an increase from the current 35.4 percent, but still less than the 40
percent some Asian leaders wanted. In the Evergreen district to the southeast,
Hammer pushed the Asian percentage from 30.2 percent to 35.3 percent, again
short of the 40 percent target.;   "We have to acknowledge her effort. We
can't say she didn't pay attention," said Lam Duc Nguyen, deputy executive
director of the Indochinese Resettlement &amp; Cultural Center, who lobbied Hammer
Friday for higher numbers.;   The mayor and her aides, explaining why they
couldn't support the 40-40 Asian goal, said it was unrealistic.;   Nguyen
accepted the criticism. "It's painful, but it may be true.";   Then there was
Councilman George Shirakawa, who stood and smiled at a Latino Issues Forum
news conference, endorsing the mayor's plan even though he was handed a
political lemon. His District 7 now jumps east of Highway 101, embracing two
police-targeted Project Crackdown neighborhoods between the freeway and King
Road -- Lanai-Cunningham and Stonegate. Shirakawa already has two crackdown
areas on his hands, Santee and Los Arboles.;   As he ducked out of the
conference, Shirakawa was asked whether he liked straddling 101. He replied:
"For the good of the community, yes, it's a fair way to go. I'll leave it at
that."; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; The city council will discuss the mayor's map at
7:30 p.m. today in the council chambers at City Hall, 801 N. First St. Final
approval is scheduled for Dec. 3.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Savas Alvarez foresees the salvation of Alviso, the San Jose bayshore hamlet

<HEADLINE>  ALVISO SEEKS POLITICAL CLOUT
S.J. REDISTRICTING PLANS POSE PLENTY OF QUESTIONS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "We can make Alviso a political campaign issue," said Alvarez, 41, a
carpenter and president of the Alviso Community Organization. "That way we can
get commitments from the candidates: What are you going to do for us?";   The
first step, however, is for the city to decide whether there will be a
campaign next year. That question is now in the hands of San Jose's political
mapmakers, who are redrawing district lines for the first time in a decade,
and deciding who will represent this North Side neighborhood.;   It is but one
of several issues that will soon land in the city council's lap, as
redistricting comes to a head. Tonight a special citizens panel is expected to
reject a map of council lines that was drafted last summer by a redistricting
commission. This development will leave Mayor Susan Hammer and her 10 council
members with these problems:;   (check) Should Alviso and the long First
Street corridor north of Highway 101 move from Shirley Lewis' Berryessa
district to David Pandori's downtown district? The Alviso issue is
particularly sensitive because it's been neglected by most politicians for the
24 years it has been part of San Jose.;   Lewis will leave the council after
next year, meaning her seat is up for election; Pandori just won his seat last
year, so that position isn't up for grabs again until 1994. The commission's
map would have given Alviso to Pandori. Some influential old-timers, including
Richard Santos, son of a former Alviso mayor and a Lewis foe, would rather go
with Pandori.;   (check) Should the downtown district shift from nearly 53
percent Hispanic population, as it stands now, to 48 percent, as the
commission proposed? Many Latinos say this move would dilute their voting
strength. Voting rights attorney Joaquin Avila is pressuring the city to back
down.;   (check) Should the Asian populations within Berryessa and within Pat
Sausedo's District 8 be concentrated to 40 percent? Some Asian legal experts
share Avila's ire and, likewise, want their political clout to reflect their
community's phenomenal population growth. But the Asian communities, unlike
the Hispanics, are geographically more dispersed, making a majority Asian
district unlikely.;   The review panel, a group of five experts appointed by
Hammer to study the commission's work, is expected to formally reject the
draft map tonight because, in part, these dilemmas remain unresolved.;
Alviso is only one of several issues, but it could touch a soft spot with city
officials, who are mindful that the neighborhood is not as well served as it
could be.;   Its population, now more than 2,000, is heavily Hispanic. Its
voting clout, in a district of about 80,000, is small. Its symbolic
significance is large.;   "It would be better if it was left in District 4,"
said Shirley Lewis, speaking of her own council turf. "District 3 (downtown)
is such a complicated district, and Alviso needs special attention.";   IF

<MEMO>  Analysis

<TEXT>     New district boundaries drawn over the next few months are likely to
reflect the emerging power of the city's Asian and Hispanic communities. They
may also show how politicians maneuver to protect or expand their base of
support and how neighborhoods guard old identities or sink new roots.;
Politicians and mapmakers predict most new districts will resemble their
forerunners. There is neither outcry about flagrant gerrymandering from the
last map nor talk of starting the new one from scratch.;    But a few
districts will change radically, notably the home base of Councilwoman Pat
Sausedo. District 8, the city's largest in area and population, is home to
Evergreen and a long swath of hills and open space to the south and east.;
The city estimates that District 8 now has 103,720 people, an outsize chunk of
the city's 1990 population of 780,000.;    It takes little math to figure the
population equilibrium point for new districts: 78,000. Sausedo's district
needs to lose about 25,000 people. As her district goes, so goes the rest of
the city. Pinch something from it, and ripples will flow everywhere else.;
If an axis were drawn through San Jose from northwest to southeast along The
Alameda and Monterey Highway, it would cut districts roughly into two kinds:
to the northeast, those above the population equilibrium; to the southwest,
those below it.;    The counterweight to District 8 is District 9. The
Cambrian area, represented by Councilman Jim Beall, must gain nearly 20,000
people. Ray Villarreal, a real estate lobbyist whom Beall picked for the
11-member Redistricting Advisory Commission, said he figures the district may
move south and east.;    But he is loath to invade the north. "I would hate to
see any splitting of Willow Glen," Villarreal said.;    The last round of
redistricting nibbled at the southern fringe of Willow Glen. So Villarreal
raises a fundamental question: Which neighborhoods are inviolable, and which
may be carved?;    Another key issue is race and ethnicity. Recent
anti-discrimination lawsuits in Watsonville and Los Angeles have paved the way
for an ethnic political revolution in those cities, dramatically opening the
city council to Hispanic communities.;    San Jose points instead to a slower
political evolution. Two Hispanics already sit on the city council here. Three
other districts -- downtown, Berryessa and Evergreen -- are less than
half-Anglo and growing ripe for a successful minority candidate.;    There are
two Hispanics on the advisory panel, named last month by the city council to
draw a recommended map, but there are no Asians or blacks.;    An attorney for
San Jose's Asian Law Alliance, Jacquelyn Maruhashi, has warned the panel that
it should listen to Asians, the city's fastest-growing minority. "If we're not
able to get input into the process, you're inviting a lawsuit," she said.;
On Thursday, mapmakers got their first glimpse of what new districts could
look like. Five hypothetical maps drawn by city planners showed boundaries
migrating north and east in several configurations.;    All five showed
Alviso, the city's northern extremity, migrating from Berryessa's District 4
to downtown's District 3. Downtown and Alviso would make an odd marriage
indeed, but planners stressed that the maps were only a non-political first
stab.;    Some officials don't believe the maps will change much at all. Bob
Brownstein, a policy aide to Mayor Susan Hammer, predicted changes would be
"routine and technical, a little shifting of the margins.";    Such margins
could prove crucial. Hammer herself benefited from a marginal change 10 years
ago, when a finger of land southwest of The Alameda was tacked onto District
3. Previously, The Alameda bounded the district. The finger happened to
include Hammer's West Hedding Street home, and she won the downtown council
seat in the next election.;    The mayor denies that she influenced that
decision, pivotal to her career. "I probably was, at best, oblivious to the
process that was going on," she said.;    This time around, Councilman David
Pandori will be watching the downtown margins closely.;    In November,
Pandori, an Anglo, beat a Hispanic candidate by a few hundred votes in a
Hispanic-majority district. Some say Pandori's re-election prospects in 1994
hinge on the movement of edges of his district, which needs to lose nearly
8,000 people.;    Pandori dismisses such talk. He sees downtown as the city's
most coherent district, and he sees its lines as rock-solid. "It would bother
me if people started drawing the boundaries in a way that didn't reflect
geography," he said.;    Councilman Joe Head may also need to watch his
margins. Head, the only council member eligible for re-election in 1992, won
his Almaden seat by 5 percent in 1988.;    Two other council members who could
run again in 1994 -- Trixie Johnson in District 1, the West Valley, and George
Shirakawa in District 7, central San Jose -- were elected by wider majorities.
They have less to lose.;    Because of a new two-term limit, the rest of the
council must step down by the end of 1994. The limit may squelch some
redistricting politics. Incumbents can't dig trenches when they must leave
office every eight years. But people jockeying to replace them will certainly
try to bend mapmakers' ears.;     IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; The redistricting
panel meets most Thursdays through July 11 at City Hall, Room 204. All
meetings are public. Its first public hearing is set for May 23 at 7 p.m. in
the council chambers.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  While a showdown over Hispanic voting power faces San Jose City Council map
makers, the political road show called redistricting arrives Tuesday evening
in Alum Rock, the heart of the city's Hispanic community.;   The hearing, the
first of three this month, gives the public a chance to say exactly which
neighborhoods should be represented by which council districts, and whether
proposed political maps fragment or unify discrete interest groups.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  HEARING ON S.J. DISTRICTS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Once every 10 years, the city must redraw its 10 council districts. This
year more than ever before, San Jose and governments throughout California are
being pressed to grant the new power that Hispanics claim as their due.;   In
San Jose, the trickiest map is undoubtedly District 3, home of downtown
Councilman David Pandori, which encompasses San Jose International Airport,
part of the Rose Garden and poorer areas near Interstate 280 and Highway 101.;
  Plan trimmed percentage; Two months ago, a majority of 11 council-appointed
map makers drew a downtown district that sliced the Hispanic population by
one-twentieth, from just under 53 percent to 48 percent. This group said the
fraction was too small to make a difference. Instead, it touted the five
districts it drew with combined ethnic majorities -- lumping blacks, Asians
and Hispanics together.;   Still, the Latino Issues Forum, headed by former
downtown council candidate Pete Carrillo, cried foul. Backed by voting-rights
experts, the forum last month made public a plan to save the Hispanic bloc.;
Other maps, including one Pandori supports, also make a Hispanic majority.
Asians, too, are pushing for more power in the city's north and east.;   One
more complication: Five council seats are up for grabs next year -- four of
them vacant -- and potential candidates are anxious not to be bumped from
their power base.;   Mayor's review panel; The whole matter now sits with
another panel, a five-member review board named by Mayor Susan Hammer. The
council must agree on the final map later this fall.;   The panel, which is
hosting this month's hearings, includes Fernando Zazueta, a Hispanic attorney
and Hammer's campaign treasurer; Hope Nakamura, a board member for the Asian
Law Alliance; Lela Llorens, a black San Jose State faculty member; and two
whites, Peter Haas, a San Jose State political scientist; and Judge John
Kennedy, retired from Santa Clara County Superior Court.;   Some panel members
reached by phone Sunday avoided the Hispanic question. Not Zazueta. "It's
clear to me that the (first mapmaking group) seems not to have paid heed to
one of its principal reasons for being: not to dilute, if possible, one
particular voting group," he said.; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; The Redistricting
Review Panel will hold three public hearings: 7 p.m. Tuesday at the Eastside
Senior Center, 2150 Alum Rock Ave.; 7 p.m. Thursday at Pioneer High School
cafeteria, 1290 Blossom Hill Road; and 7 p.m. Sept. 19 at City Hall, 801 N.

<LEADPARA>  In approving San Jose's new political map for the 1990s, the city council was
forced Tuesday night to make a wrenching choice between slicing small
increments of power from ethnic minority groups and shaving neighborhoods from
council members who fought to keep them.;   The debate ended in Mayor Susan
Hammer's favor, as the council voted 10-1 to adopt a map barely changed from
the one she unveiled two weeks ago. The map held fast to ethnic population
counts some judge crucial to moving more Asians and Hispanics into City Hall.
Only Councilwoman Shirley Lewis voted no.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  S.J. POLITICAL PLURALISM PREVAILS AS HAMMER-BACKED
MAP IS ADOPTED  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The mayor was tugged in two opposite directions -- neighborhood unity vs.
political pluralism -- two themes that served her well in her election a year
ago. It was a difficult choice because the margins on both sides were so
small.;   On one hand were council members David Pandori, Trixie Johnson and
Lewis, who argued for bringing a small piece of the Berryessa School District
back into the Berryessa council district and the Garden Alameda neighborhood
back into the downtown council district.;   On the other were Hammer and the
rest of the council, who argued against cutting two-tenths of a percentage
point from Berryessa's Asian population (finally adopted at 37.4 percent) and
against cutting one-tenth of a point from the downtown's Hispanic population
(adopted at 55.0 percent).;   Council members said that the number of people
at stake amounted to less than 100 people in each case, from districts of
about 80,000 apiece.;   Said Pandori, who voted for Hammer's map in the end
after supporting two failed amendments: "All of us truly do find ourselves
unified in trying to maximize minority population and keeping neighborhoods
together. The trick has been balancing those two things.";   Hammer refused to
budge. "I cannot reduce the ethnic voting power in any district . . . to
accommodate the interests of one small neighborhood," she said.;   But
neighborhoods, no matter how small, are the bread and butter of every council
member, and it clearly pained some to vote against the residential interests.
"Those of us who voted on the other side also voted in the best interests of
the city," said Councilman Joe Head, explaining his tilt in this case toward
the minority groups.;   The mayor's map had the backing of Hispanic political
activists, but some Asian leaders criticized it for not pushing their clout
further in Evergreen and Berryessa.;   The Berryessa issue may take on more
political significance in next year's council elections. Carm Grande, a
candidate to replace Lewis, spoke out for the councilwoman and the Berryessa
School District.;   Margie Fernandes, a top mayoral aide who is also running
in Berryessa, did not speak out at the hearing but said that she backed Hammer
on the issue.;   In the end, nearly every council member lined up with the
mayor, including those who did well by themselves and those who lost back-room
battles. Councilman Jim Beall got last-minute help when the mayor moved his
Cambrian Park District 9 eastward to Guadalupe River. Beall, not
coincidentally, is planning a $325,000 bike trail and footpath along the
river.;   Then there was Vice Mayor Pat Sausedo, who supported Hammer's map
despite losing control over a controversial new neighborhood of up to 990
homes she supports for Edenvale. "We are not all going to have every little
aspect of what we would like," Sausedo said. "But redistricting is not
supposed to accommodate all of our personal desires."  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  ANALYSIS; SAN-JOSE; SPACE; CHANGE; POLITICS; CITY; COUNCIL  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Two of San Jose's spiciest political issues -- redrawing city council
boundaries and managing growth in South San Jose -- merged Thursday when Mayor
Susan Hammer picked the winner of a turf war between two councilwomen for
control of a major new neighborhood proposed in Edenvale.;   The struggle
between Pat Sausedo and Judy Stabile topped a dramatic week at City Hall --
one that saw a major development proposal hit an unforeseen roadblock thrown
up by a school district and a new political map for San Jose that promises
increased clout for ethnic minority groups.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  MAYOR SETTLES TURF WAR ON S.J. COUNCIL  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Analysis  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Vice Mayor Sausedo, who supports the housing proposal by Shea Homes and
Gibson Speno Co., clashed with Stabile, who is fighting to keep the 92 acres
zoned for industry.;   Each wanted the land in her district, and Hammer, after
waffling last weekend, said Thursday she would side with Stabile, meaning that
the developers will face much tougher negotiations over zoning for the land if
the proposal passes a key planning hurdle on Dec. 10.;   Ironically, the mayor
supports the development of up to 990 new homes, which passed the council Nov.
14 on an 8-3 vote. The project now faces another review because of 11th-hour
protests aired earlier this week by the cash-crunched Oak Grove School
District, which serves the neighborhood.;   The Sausedo-Stabile struggle is
perhaps the most interesting political development to emerge since Hammer
unveiled her map for San Jose's 10 city council districts Monday.;   The
council, which solidly supports most of Hammer's redistricting plan, will vote
on it Dec. 3.;   Other bits of political intrigue surrounding the plan
include:;   (check) A bid by Asian interest groups to get the mayor to raise
voting power by a few critical percentage points in the Berryessa and
Evergreen districts. By bumping densely Asian apartment complexes between
Mabury and McKee roads from the Alum Rock district to Berryessa, some say, the
Asian population in the northern district could creep up past the 37.4 percent
Hammer gave it.;   (check) A bid by downtown Councilman David Pandori to
reclaim nearly 3,000 mostly white residents in the College Park and Garden
Alameda neighborhoods. Hammer had moved them into a district west of
Pandori's, in a move aimed at concentrating Hispanic strength downtown.;
(check) A gentlemen's agreement cut between councilmen Jim Beall and Joe Head,
who represent southwest San Jose. Beall agreed to let Head keep control of the
old Almaden Winery site, where a park and community center are planned just
south of their common district boundary, Blossom Hill Road. And Head raised no
qualms when Beall moved east, across Almaden Expressway, snaring a piece of
the Guadalupe River.;   The cooperation between Beall and Head contrasted with
the battle between Sausedo and Stabile.;   Sausedo represents District 8,
largely based in Evergreen, north of the Silver Creek Hills and nestled
against the Diablo Range. Her current lines also include a large part of
Edenvale, between the Silver Creek Hills and Monterey Highway, jumping over
Highway 101.;   Sausedo now controls the acreage for the developers' housing
proposal and has been a force in shepherding the controversial project past
some significant barriers at City Hall, including the objections of top
administration officials who want the land kept preserved for the city's
industrial tax base.;   Stabile represents District 2, based northeast of the
Santa Teresa Ridge and west of the proposed housing.;   A map Hammer floated
privately to council members last week gave Stabile all of Edenvale, through
the Silver Creek hillsides, which form a natural barrier to Sausedo's
territory.;   But the mayor said Sausedo objected strongly to giving up the
territory, so the boundary was switched over the weekend. When Hammer
announced her map at a news conference, it showed Sausedo's district reaching
Coyote Creek, which happens to be the western property line for the
developers.;   This meant that Stabile would essentially represent all the
homes between the Santa Teresa and Silver Creek hills except those proposed by
the developers. Stabile protested.;   "I want it from ridgeline to ridgeline,"
she said.;   This week, Hammer reversed her position -- though her support for
the project remains solid.;   But the mayor conceded that Stabile could now
play a key role in the proposal's future.;   "Council members have a lot of
power in land use issues and working with the planning department," Hammer
said. "They can either expedite them and make them happen or they can throw up
roadblocks.";   Sausedo and Stabile could not be reached for comment Thursday
afternoon. Steve Speno, spokesman for the developers, was also unavailable.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Merlin Olsen would have burst with pride at the formal sensibilities of San
Jose Mayor Susan Hammer's chief aide, Gary Robinson. Looking to spruce up the
council's sixth-floor reception room, Robinson queried other council offices
about whether they might like flowers. Sure, came the response. So every week,
the room now gets a new $28 floral arrangement, a cost of less than $1,500 per
year. A few of the council aides were a bit surprised when they saw that the
bill for the flowers was tacked on to the council's general tab. But no one is
griping publicly. "I don't mind," said Councilman David Pandori. "I don't
consider it a big deal." And Robinson? "We've gotten compliments but no
complaints," he said.; BEATING THE ODDS  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In the down times between high-tech conventions and political dinners, the
San Jose McEnery Convention Center rents space for an increasingly popular
activity: Hispanic dances (In memory of the Lord Mayor, we forebear dwelling
on the irony). In fact, the dances have become so popular that the city
officials have been forced to plan a drawing among competing promoters for
1992 dates. The drawing itself may be a bit, well, tilted. According to a
letter we obtained from convention-meister Ellie Oppenheim, only three of 30
interested promoters are eligible. They are Al Rodriguez, of LUZ-AL
Promotions; Ari Evans of El Mundo International and Amador Bustos of Radio
KLOK/KBRG. We asked Jim McBride, Oppenheim's deputy, why those three got
special treatment. "They've all been here in the past and had successful
events," he said. "We don't want to saturate the market and kill everybody
off."; WHITE CHRISTMAS;   Wanna know the real spirit of Christmas? Get out
your handkerchiefs. The lead from a Santa Clara County press release last week
read, "The holiday season of giving marks the time for a very important
year-end contribution: Santa Clara County property taxes." . . . Add another
name to the list of potential candidates in city council District 6, Willow
Glen and the Rose Garden: Tom Hayes, an official with Applied Materials. Hayes
is not without friends in politics: Applied Materials' CEO is James Morgan,
husband of State Sen. Becky Morgan . . . Finally, it's fair to say that
Sunnyvale City Councilman Stan Kawczynski desperately needs -- or needed -- a
proofreader. Before the recent election, Kawczynski mailed out a two-page
leaflet that trumpeted his achievements with atrocious spelling. A few
examples: He talked about the threat of groundwater contimination; pledged to
be more resposive to the needs of citizens, underscored his committment to
Sunnyvale; and, maybe best of all, said that his proffession was as a
financial adviser.; MASSED TRANSIT;   The fate of Santa Clara County bus line
72 may not seem like earth-shattering stuff: But since all politics is local,
even this obscure route through downtown had its moment. With the consent of
the city council, San Carlos Street is about to be closed through the San Jose
State University campus on a trial basis. Because line 72 now runs down San
Carlos, its route must be changed. The transit people initially proposed
running the 72 south on 13th Street to Reed Street, and then westward to
First. This went directly through the Naglee Park neighborhood, vigorously
defended by Supervisor Zoe Lofgren and Councilman David Pandori. At Pandori's
suggestion, the transit people now seem ready to accept a new alignment that
would bring the route across San Carlos to 11th Street; north on 11th and west
on San Fernando Street. Before they did, an intriguing group of power-brokers
actually rode the 72 through the neighborhood to judge how difficult the turns
were. Transit spokeswoman Deborah Wetter said they included transit chief
Larry Reuter, former Supervisor Susanne Wilson, Pandori, and Lofgren aide Mike
Boenninghausen.; UNPREFERRED RISK;   Amid the carping about credit card rates,
one class of loan victim has been forgotten: the politician. Or more
accurately, the politician's donors. Consider the case of San Jose
Councilwoman Blanca Alvarado. Alvarado's campaign records show that she loaned
her re-election campaign $15,000 in two installments last year. They show she
repaid the loans with $1,363 in interest, which works out to between 22 and 25
percent per year. Is Alvarado getting rich off her own campaign? Hardly. The
councilwoman says she obtained the loans from Plaza Bank and Cupertino
National Bank. And that was the interest they charged her.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     And Trixie Johnson, the third council newcomer in 1991, established herself
as an environmentalist and slow-growth voice on a council that is leaning more
and more toward business and development interests.;   These three are the
first wave of new faces for what promises to be radical change on the council
over the next three years. Term limits will oust all other council members
except Joe Head and Mayor Susan Hammer by January 1995.;   Interviews with
council members and analysis of the year's voting record from council minutes
show these patterns:;   (check) Pandori, who represents downtown, lost more
council votes than any other member. But he won credit from some for sticking
to his principles. The year produced 38 split votes during open council
meetings. Twenty times Pandori was on the losing side; 10 of those were
solitary, quixotic no votes.;   (check) Shirakawa, elected from south and
central San Jose, is closely allied with 11-year council veteran Blanca
Alvarado and is most likely to diverge from the council majority on an issue
touching minority interests. He lost six votes.;   (check) Johnson,
representing the West Valley, styles herself an heir to Shirley Lewis and Judy
Stabile, two councilwomen who will leave office after 1992. On the losing side
only four times, Johnson is well liked and viewed as much more of an insider
than her predecessor, Lu Ryden.;   Of the three, Pandori probably made the
strongest impression in his first year. It seemed, from day to day, that
people either liked him or despised him, often for purely personal reasons.;
A former aide to ex-Mayor Tom McEnery, Pandori takes an aggressive, rational,
analytical approach to issues that strikes some people as annoying and aloof
and often costs him politically. Once he accused City Manager Les White of
driving "a loophole the size of the Caldecott Tunnel" through the council's
budget policy.;   Hammer said this about Pandori in June: "David is maturing
in how he deals with the council and city staff. That's going to serve him
well. He at first had a tendency to alienate people in the comments he would
make. I think he realizes that to be effective, you have to be a little more
circumspect about what you say in public.";   Five months later, as she was
redrawing the downtown district boundary against Pandori's wishes, Hammer
still sounded like a dean counseling a rambunctious schoolboy:;   "It may be
that from time to time he publicly sounds a little strident. We all go through
learning how to achieve what you achieve up here. Once you establish a
personal relationship, then you can be more effective on a professional
level.";   Still, Pandori got results, especially on downtown neighborhood
issues. His biggest victory was slowing expansion of San Jose International
Airport because of noise protests.;   The picture of Shirakawa and Johnson is
less clear. Both tend to let others lead debates.;   Shirakawa's strongest
stand came in April, when he opposed renaming the city's convention center
after McEnery. The vote was probably influenced by criticism minority groups
gave the former mayor during his second term.;   Shirakawa, who could not be
reached for this article, also pushed for affirmative action in city business
deals and devoted himself to schools relations and a 4,000-unit housing plan
for Communications Hill, in the center of his district.;   He was viewed as
genial and friendly, but also, at times, frustrated. "He was overwhelmed at
first," said Johnson. "I'm not sure he's enjoyed it. He's actually said so. I
asked, 'Are you having fun?' and he said, 'No, not really.' ";   Johnson seems
Shirakawa's mirror opposite, a government veteran who knows budget and
planning lingo, enjoys intercity diplomacy and environmental energy policy.
She, along with Pandori, voted against the general plan amendment that opens
92 acres in Edenvale to housing, a measure Shirakawa supported.;   Shirakawa
is burdened with several drug-plagued Project Crackdown neighborhoods.
Johnson's biggest district issue is street trees uprooting sidewalks. "It's
the thing I hear the most about, believe it or not," Johnson said. "Even more
than crime and traffic."; SAN JOSE'S CITY COUNCIL ROOKIE ROSTER; David

<LEADPARA>  MAYOR Susan Hammer's redistricting plan is imperfect, like every other
redistricting plan proposed for San Jose so far. But it gets the city's
priorities right on some key issues, and it's the basis for a good map.;   The
redistricting committee mandated by the city charter drew a map last summer
that reduced the Hispanic concentration in District 3, the downtown, to under
50 percent. That would have left San Jose with only one Hispanic-majority
district -- an indefensible plan, which a review panel rejected.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Under Hammer's map, District 3 is 55 percent Hispanic, and Asian-Americans
gain strength in Districts 4 and 8 -- although the map splits some heavily
Asian neighborhoods that other proposals kept intact.;   Uniting ethnic groups
often is accomplished at the expense of neighborhoods and school areas, and
some tinkering may be in order. For instance, Councilman David Pandori says
it's wrong to remove the Garden Alameda neighborhood from District 3.
Residents there are boiling mad about the new arena and ought to be able to be
in the downtown district. He claims the change would require little change in
the Hispanic percentage.;   Other areas may need another look as a result of
public reaction, which began at a meeting last night. But there is no way to
form districts that make everyone happy.;   The mayor's map is a big
improvement over most of the earlier proposals in one area: It keeps Alviso in
District 4 instead of moving it into District 3, where it would need to
compete for attention with time-consuming issues like the airport and downtown
redevelopment.;   Alviso would have been lost in District 3, and many of its
leaders knew that. It can be a much higher priority in District 4, which has
fewer high-profile problems.; FOLLOW-UP . . . The next public hearing on the
redistricting plan, followed by the council vote, will be 7 p.m. Dec. 3 at
city hall, 801 N. First St.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  If he didn't know already, City Manager Les White learned Monday how tough it
is to balance San Jose's budget at the expense of the city's men and women in
badges and blue.;    In its first public airing Monday morning, White's plan
to delay hiring nearly two dozen new officers next year to help close San
Jose's worst fiscal gap in a decade ran into a noncommittal mayor, a skeptical
city council and one councilman's flat accusation of a power grab.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  WHITE TAKES HEAT FOR PLAN TO STALL HIRING
OF COPS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Claiming that White's police cuts had skirted the council and mayor's
budget blueprint, Councilman David Pandori upbraided the manager with
surprisingly harsh language. Pandori charged that White was usurping key
policy tasks rightfully assumed by elected officials.;    "You're taking some
minor language in this proposal and building it into a loophole the size of
the Caldecott Tunnel," Pandori said. "I know you're squirming in your seat,
Les.";    In a sharp denial, White pounded the dais with his fist, insisting
that he was bringing his best professional judgment to the council. "If you
don't want the manager doing that," he said, "then what do you want the
manager doing on the budget?";    While none of Pandori's cohorts was quite so
scathing, several indicated they wanted the manager to serve up more budget
options -- options that would include something besides stretching out the
police hiring plan from five years to six.;    A few, however, supported
White, saying the police department should not be off-limits when the city
needs to close a $20 million deficit.;    "I don't think there is anything in
this budget that is so sacred that we can't at least discuss it," Councilwoman
Blanca Alvarado said.;    The so-called "police five-year plan" was born after
two officers died in a 1989 downtown shootout. Then-Mayor Tom McEnery agreed
to hire 45 officers a year through 1993 and the city's police union dropped a
lawsuit alleging a personnel shortage.;    This year, the force is budgeted
for more than 1,100 sworn officers. The rest of the five-year plan would bring
135 more officers on board.;    White proposes saving $1.4 million by pushing
back hiring dates. Next spring, 22 would be hired, then 90 in the following
two years, then the final 23 by 1994.;    White went beyond Mayor Susan
Hammer's March proposal for a simple three-month delay in hiring this year's
batch of 45 officers. Though she agrees with most of the rest of his budget,
Hammer has remained distant from White's police proposal, in what some
observers say is a political maneuver to make her own plan more palatable.;
Sgt. Mike Fehr, president of the Police Officers Association, said his group
would back Hammer's plan but not White's.;    Assistant Chief Fred Abram, in a
ticklish position because he is vying for the soon-to-be-vacant police chief's
post, said the police department needed to share budget pain with other
departments.;    "We're getting 22 new positions," Abram said. "That's more
than anyone else (in the city) is getting. That's a tough call on Les White's
part.";    White's "call" may become the budget's defining issue.;    Mike
Ferrero, business agent for the city's major employees union, the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, supports the budget as it
now stands. If White's judgment is overruled, Ferrero said, "it could upset
the delicate balance that's built into this budget."  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Testimony on Mayor Susan Hammer's proposed political map for San Jose's 10
city council districts on Tuesday night showed a widening rift between
Hispanic leaders, elated with the plan, and Asian leaders, upset that the
mayor didn't help them enough.;   Dozens of people from Alviso came, too, to
demand that the city pay more attention to problems in that long-neglected
bayside neighborhood. They demanded an Alviso master plan from the mayor, who
granted their wish to stay in the Berryessa district instead of moving to
downtown, as some had proposed.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  HAMMER'S REMAP PLAN PLEASES HISPANICS, MIFFS ASIANS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The council, which considered the plan late into the night, is scheduled to
debate it again and vote Dec. 3.;   There was stark contrast between reactions
of the city's two leading ethnic groups.;   The Latino Issues Forum, the
Mexican-American Community Services Agency, La Raza lawyers and other Latino
groups streamed into the council chambers to congratulate the mayor, who in
her map released Monday significantly increased Hispanic power in two council
districts in central San Jose.;   "This is a plan for the 1990s," said voting
rights attorney Joaquin Avila. "It is a plan that can best provide access to
the political process for our Latino community.";   But Richard Konda,
representing the Asian-Pacific Islanders for Fair Reapportionment, said Hammer
should have been able to reach a 40 percent Asian concentration in the
Berryessa and Evergreen districts, instead of the 37 and 35 percent levels she
drew.;   And Lam Duc Nguyen, of the Indochinese Resettlement &amp; Cultural
Center, said: "I would like to share the joy of our Hispanic groups. But as an
Asian-American, I support Richard Konda's position.";   Other Asian leaders
argued that because the group accounted for much of the city's growth during
the 1980s, it should have been rewarded with more voting clout.;   Hammer said
Asian power was hard to achieve because Asian neighborhoods are generally more
dispersed than Hispanic neighborhoods.;   Some people came to defend their
neighborhoods, not their ethnicity. Some wanted to keep the College Park and
Garden Alameda areas, southwest of Stockton Avenue, in the downtown district,
instead of moving to the Willow Glen district as Hammer proposed. Some wanted
to keep traditional Berryessa areas from leaching into Alum Rock.;   Alex
Rubin, a College Park activist on noise issues surrounding San Jose
International Airport, gave the council a petition urging that the area remain
represented by downtown Councilman David Pandori.;   In other action Tuesday,
the council deferred acting on a proposed card-room tax.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  One San Jose councilman who voted last month for a controversial new housing
development in Edenvale now says he has changed his mind because of protests
raised by an elementary school district.;   But it's unclear whether the
switch by Councilman David Pandori will tilt the council against the Shea
Homes/Gibson Speno Co. proposal when it comes back to a vote Tuesday night.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  EDENVALE PLAN LOSES BACKER ON S.J. COUNCIL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "This is an individual decision," said Pandori, who wants to study the
housing proposal next year side by side with other large planning issues. He
was one of eight ayes for the developers on Nov. 14. "I still fundamentally
agree that the city has to provide an equal amount of housing and jobs.";   As
it finishes another year of tinkering with San Jose's long-range planning, the
council will face at least two tough growth issues in South San Jose. The
Edenvale proposal could create up to 990 new homes on a vacant 92-acre parcel
east of Highway 101. And another potentially divisive proposal could bring 436
homes on 40 acres of an old golf course near Cottle Road and Santa Teresa
Boulevard.;   If those two are approved, it would mean that plans for 3,210
new housing units passed muster this fall. Those homes will help push San
Jose's population well beyond its estimated 1991 population of 791,645.;
Politicking on growth has been heavy in the past week, as developers make the
rounds of council members to lobby for votes, and developer foes, like
Councilwoman Judy Stabile, try to push the other way.;   Councilman Joe Head,
for instance, was spotted lunching on Wednesday with representatives of Gibson
Speno Co. at a restaurant near City Hall. Head had argued that the housing
will help drive industrial growth in South San Jose, but he was one of three
key council members -- the others were Pandori and Nancy Ianni -- who decided
last month to hear the complaints of the Oak Grove School District. Unless
those three had agreed to reopen the hearing, the deal would have been done.;
 Head, asked later about the meeting, described his vote as "very firm" in
favor of the developers, which is no surprise around City Hall. But he said he
had leaned on them to help Oak Grove schools. "I want to make sure they're
talking," Head said.;   The educators want $10 million for a school to handle
the children from the new neighborhood. But Hardy Childers, an assistant
superintendent, said Thursday, "We haven't gotten any answers yet." Other
alternatives, which Childers said are less palatable, include adding portable
classrooms to existing schools and long-distance busing.;   Another key issue
is fire service. Fire officials say the neighborhood would be seven to 11
minutes away from the closest firefighting response, well below the standard
service goal of four minutes.;   If a new station were built, city officials
say they would have a hard time funding the engine and truck companies to
staff it. Assistant Fire Chief Lee Suess said staffing alone would cost at
least $1 million and possibly up to $2.5 million a year, a large sum when the
city already faces a $20 million budget shortfall.;   However, Mayor Susan
Hammer and other City Hall sources say the proposal is still likely to pass,
even if the schools and fire issues remain up in the air. "I don't know if
everything's going to be worked out by Tuesday, but there have been some very
positive discussions," Hammer said.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; The city council
will meet at 7 p.m. Tuesday to vote on Edenvale and other general plan
amendments in the council chambers, 801 N. First St., San Jose.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  The San Jose City Council gave itself a 10 percent pay raise and Mayor Susan
Hammer an 11 percent raise Tuesday afternoon -- though the mayor and
Councilman David Pandori pledged their new dollars to favorite city programs
because of the city's tight budget.;    The 9-1 council vote, which followed
the advice of a citizen salary commission, locked salaries in place for two
years at $52,800 for the 10 council members and $80,000 for the mayor. The
raises take effect July 1.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The council is in the midst of solving a $20 million budget shortfall. But
no one from the public spoke against the raises at the meeting.;    Council
members reasoned that the raises weren't outlandish, averaging roughly 5
percent a year. And they said flatly that they were worth it.;    Said Vice
Mayor Pat Sausedo: "The city is getting a bargain for what we're being paid. I
challenge anyone to look at my calendar.";    The council also discussed
proposing a ballot measure to pay the vice mayor more for the extra work that
comes with the job.;    Pandori voted against the raise. "My preference would
be to defer it for one year, given the city's present fiscal condition," he
said. Pandori said he will donate his $4,800 to needy city projects in his
district.;    Hammer said she will give her $8,000 to a new program called
"San Jose Best" that funnels money to schools for anti-gang and anti-drug
programs and curriculum enhancement.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  SAN-JOSE; CITY; FINANCE; BUDGET; FORECAST; REPORT  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  San Jose's number crunchers have handed Mayor Susan Hammer and the city
council a crushing report, pinpointing the city's projected deficit next year
at $20.6 million and predicting the financial picture will get worse in the
near future.;   "We're in the bottom of a pile of dung, fiscally," said Bob
Brownstein, Hammer's budget chief.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  S.J. FACES WORSENING FISCAL GAPS
NEW STUDY BLAMES SHRINKING REVENUES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     In a report released Friday, city budget director Larry Lisenbee blamed the
shortfall on slumping sales and property tax receipts and bulging expenses for
employee salaries, garbage service and police and fire staffing.;   The report
suggests that local government treasuries are often the best measure of how
well the economy is performing. Much more than trickling down, the national
recession has rained on City Hall. The upshot will undoubtedly mean tax
increases or deep service cuts next year -- maybe both.;   Five months after
Hammer trumpeted that she balanced a lousy budget with no layoffs or new
taxes, she may be facing both.;   In May, San Jose was eyeing a $10.3 million
budget shortfall for the 1993 fiscal year out of a general fund spending plan
of $419 million. That was before the retail market fell through the floor.
Estimates now show sales tax collections in San Jose down $7.2 million.;
"The May forecast assumed that an economic recovery would be well under way by
this point in time," Lisenbee wrote. "That clearly has not happened.";   A
year ago, Lisenbee calculated that the city could climb out of deficits within
five years, showing general-fund surpluses by 1995. Now he predicts nothing
but funding gaps through 1996.;   "This forecasted trend should concern us
more than the size of the deficit in any given year," Lisenbee wrote.;
Scenarios to climb out of the mess will emerge next week when the council
reviews the grim news and Hammer's plans to combat it.;   The plan, to be
released Tuesday, is still under wraps.;   However, Hammer has indicated she
expects to order a hiring freeze and favors a new gambling tax on card tables
at the Garden City club, as soon as possible.;   The city is studying several
other tax increases, including higher levies on cigarettes, car rentals,
out-of-state phone calls and entertainment tickets.;   Council members are
weighing in with other ideas.;   Councilwoman Blanca Alvarado wants to look at
higher fees on telephone, water and wastewater utilities, plus a steeper tax
on real estate sales. Councilwomen Shirley Lewis and Pat Sausedo would eye a
higher business tax on garbage dumps and charges to city-run enterprises.;
Other council members want to examine spending cuts and fee increases before
they look at taxes.;   On Friday, Councilman David Pandori brought up a wholly
different idea. Likening the city to a university, which should maintain
high-quality services no matter what the economy, Pandori proposed that the
city create its own endowment fund.;   By sloughing off $1 million in city
revenue each year and making high-rate, long-term investments, Pandori
calculated that San Jose could have an endowment worth $1 billion in 50 years.
Councilwoman Trixie Johnson has advanced a similar idea.;   But that notion
assumes the council has the political will to save those millions, instead of
spending as much as it can as soon as it can. Such will can be in short stock,
looking up through a dung heap.;   "Most funds like that start in a surplus
year," said Hammer's aide, Brownstein. "Very few people start them in a cut
year."  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  As downtown  San Jose becomes a more popular night spot, city officials
unfamiliar with overseeing a "24-hour city" have wrestled with defining what
type of night life they want.;    On Tuesday, the city council took the first
steps toward adopting a long-awaited ordinance, one that would allow
nightclubs throughout downtown, rather than creating a nightclub district.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  MORE AREA FOR S.J.'S NIGHT LIFE
ALL OF DOWNTOWN CORE, NOT JUST ZONE, WEIGHED  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "I think it's important that the city encourage and permit nightclub uses
throughout the downtown core," said Councilman David Pandori, who, along with
Mayor Susan Hammer, drafted a memo to the council that will become the basis
for the nightclub ordinance.;    The memo outlined four basic guidelines for
the future ordinance:;    (check) Nightclubs should be allowed throughout the
downtown core area. The policy that was proposed last year recommended
encouraging nightclubs in San Pedro Square, the Market Street area and the San
Antonio Plaza Redevelopment Area.;    (check) Rules regarding nightclubs
should be applied consistently to all areas downtown. The planning
commission's policy recommended excepting San Pedro Square from the guidelines
discouraging nightclubs from dominating certain streets. The memo stated that
San Pedro Square, like all areas downtown, should have a mixture of uses.;
(check) The new policy should apply to new nightclubs only. The redevelopment
agency had proposed applying the nightclub policy to existing as well as new
clubs.;    (check) Nightclubs will be discouraged from locating "adjacent to
or near residential areas." The planning commission's recommendation was that
the ordinance forbid nightclubs within 450 feet of residential areas. The memo
recommends "a more flexible guideline.";    The council has been criticized by
potential nightclub owners for not being receptive to clubs outside the
Pavilion Shops and other redevelopment areas. Last year, plans for two new
downtown clubs were thwarted. In one case -- the proposed Main Event club on
South First Street -- the controversy centered on its location across Gore
Park from an existing residential neighborhood and the future site of a
condominium project. Backers of the club eventually withdrew their plans.;
The council will also look at the possibility of letting clubs remain open,
but not serve alcohol, after 2 a.m., but that proposal was sent back to staff
for further evaluation. Also sent back for further study was a proposal to
establish an entertainment permit, which would be approved by the police
department.;    "These are all very sound recommendations," said Hammer. "I
think it's important that we diversify the nightclubs to other parts of the
downtown area. The Broadway area of San Francisco is exactly what we don't
want in San Jose."  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  NEIGHBORHOOD; PARK; PUBLIC; SAFETY; CRIME; DRUG; SAN-JOSE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Faced with a roomful of downtown residents demanding that their neighborhood
parks be purged of crime and drugs, Councilman David Pandori last week
reaffirmed his support for a ranger program for the parks.;    Pandori also
announced that the city's Project Crackdown has been expanded into the area
around Roosevelt Park, considered the most troubled park in downtown.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Pandori said he and Mayor Susan Hammer have agreed on the funding in this
year's budget of at least one ranger for the downtown area and that he still
hopes to get more.;    The two programs come in response to longstanding
protests from residents who say the area's five parks -- Roosevelt, Backesto,
William Street, Ryland and St. James -- have become havens for gang activities
and drug dealing.;    Residents at the March 6 forum sponsored by People
Acting in Community Together (PACT) told of being approach by drug dealers,
seeing youths armed with weapons and fearing for their safety when at the
parks.;    "It's disappointing that I have to put (my daughter) into the car
and drive to a park because we can't enjoy our own park," one resident told
the roughly 100 people who attended the meeting. "I don't feel safe there.";
 Kay Lee, a PACT member, said she, too, has stopped visiting her neighborhood
park. "We used to go to Roosevelt Park because it was within walking
distance," she said. "But I always had to be aware of the surroundings and
didn't feel safe there.";    The forum on the status of the parks had been
planned weeks ago but took on a new sense of urgency when members of PACT
became concerned that San Jose's fiscal crisis might cause the ranger program
to be dropped from this year's city budget.;    At the meeting, PACT members
displayed large posters quoting Pandori's past support for the rangers program
when he was a candidate for the District 3 council seat in 1990. They also
posted charts showing that crime at the parks increased last year.;    Pandori
reassured the residents he was working to bring rangers to the downtown parks
and said he hoped that the program -- along with Project Crackdown -- will
make the parks safer for people to enjoy.;    "I will not vote for a budget in
the city of San Jose that does not have a pilot ranger program," he said.
"I've always had that commitment; I never lost that commitment.";    If the
program is approved, the unarmed rangers would work to keep the parks free of
crime and drug activity. Rangers are already used at larger citywide parks,
but their work there is largely limited to maintenance and youth programs.;
The program is attractive because it puts uniformed city officials in the
parks at a fraction of the salaries it would cost to pay police officers.;
One resident complained that having only one ranger to patrol the parks would
be insufficient, but Pandori said the proposal is a step in the right
direction. "It's a lot better than what we have now," he said.;    Pandori
insisted he said nothing to make PACT organizers believe he was not going to
support the rangers program.;    "We have completely different views on that,"
he said. "But we agree now.";    Project Crackdown involves getting residents
and several city agencies, including the police, together to coordinate
neighborhood activities, graffiti abatement and increased police protection.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  ELECTION; CHANGE; SAN-JOSE; RELATION; HISPANIC; MINORITY; OPINION  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  IN 1980, the Census found that Hispanics made up 22 percent of San Jose's
population. Today, according to the 1990 Census, the city is 30 percent
Hispanic.;   Given those numbers, you'd think the Latino Issues Forum would be
clamoring for more political clout, trying to expand Hispanics' voting power
when San Jose adjusts its city council district lines. Instead, it finds
itself fighting just to keep from losing ground.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  ELIMINATING A HISPANIC MAJORITY DISTRICT IS WRONG  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Barbara Vroman is associate editor of the Mercury News editorial pages.
Commentary  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The redistricting committee's recommended map, known as the C map, cuts the
number of Hispanic-majority districts from two to one. It keeps a Hispanic
majority in District 5, the East Side, but it reduces the Hispanic percentage
in the downtown's District 3 from 52.6 percent to 48 percent.;   And because
of a rigid redistricting process, Hispanics have an uphill battle to keep
their voting strength in District 3.;   The Latino Issues Forum's attorney,
Joaquin Avila, cites voting rights laws and threatens to sue if the C map
isn't changed.;   Decisions should not be made solely to avoid a lawsuit. You
do what's right and defend the consequences. But to me, eliminating one of the
city's Hispanic majority districts just isn't right.;   It sends entirely the
wrong message. At a time when San Jose is supposed to be trying to bring more
minorities into government, this proposal says wait -- as soon as you get
close to having real voting power, we're going to notch you back a few pegs.;
 The redistricting committee, chaired by Richard Garcia, argues that the
current 53 percent majority of Hispanics in District 3 still isn't enough to
guarantee election of a Hispanic candidate, so cutting it a few points is
permissible. Pete Carrillo, president of the Latino Issues Forum, lost the
last council election in District 3 to David Pandori.;   But 10 years ago,
District 3 was only 45 percent Hispanic. The percentage has grown almost eight
points since then. At that rate, those neighborhoods would approach 60 percent
Hispanic by the end of this decade. District 5 is now 57 percent, and it sends
Blanca Alvarado to the city council.;   Setting District 3 Hispanics back five
points now makes it unlikely that they will approach 60 percent before the
next census. And what happens then? Will the next redistricting committee turn
the clock back as well?;   The current committee tried to balance the desire
of Hispanics and Asians to gain voting power with the wishes of neighborhoods
to remain united. Citywide, neighborhoods seem to have come out on top.;   Not
that neighborhoods are unimportant. At a hearing last week, Valerie Johnson
made an eloquent plea that her Warner Heights Homeowners Association stay in
District 8. Johnson says development in District 8 will affect Warner Heights,
and the association will have more clout if it's in the same district. She's
absolutely right.;   In fact, considering the issues city government deals
with, neighborhood power may be more important than ethnic-group power in most
cases. I'd hate to see San Jose dissolve into racial politics, pitting one
group against another.;   The thing about District 3, though, is that the C
map both disperses its Hispanic population and divides its neighborhoods. If
you apply the neighborhood test to draw a downtown district, it's easy to end
up with a majority of Hispanics.;   Besides, with all the alternative
proposals floating around, I believe there must be a way both to get District
3 back over 50 percent Hispanic, crossing that psychological threshold, and to
protect most neighborhoods. A few may be divided -- but then, a few in
District 3 that are now cut by the C map would be reunited. It won't be easy
to sway the city from that C map, though.;   A majority of the redistricting
committee defends it, even though everybody admits there wasn't enough time to
come up with alternatives. The review panel holding hearings on the plan will
listen to criticisms of the C map, but it won't talk about alternative
proposals. Framing the discussion that way rules out creative compromises.;
Ray Villareal and John Marshall Collins, both members of the redistricting
committee, continued trying to come up with alternatives after the deadline --
and found themselves villains in the eyes of the rest of the committee.;
Villareal originally helped draw the C map but later decided it did not do
enough to enhance minority voting power. Collins' goal was to find a better
plan for District 3's current neighborhoods, not to increase minority
concentrations.;   Ironically, Collins' map ends up giving District 3 the
highest Hispanic concentration of any current proposal -- 53.4 percent -- by
creating a compact, urban district.;   Villareal's map takes 3 just over 50
percent, and the Latino Issues Forum keeps it about where it is now, at 53
percent.;   Collins was named to the committee by Pandori, whose political
interests would be better served by the C map than by Collins': Pandori's main
appeal has not been to minorities. But he feels strongly that the downtown
neighborhoods should stay together -- placing him in an odd and unspoken
alliance with Pete Carrillo, the LIF president, who's likely to challenge him
again for the council seat.;   It's tempting to dismiss the LIF's protest as
an elect-Carrillo ploy, but that's too simplistic. The LIF has been making the
rounds of school boards, pushing them into district elections to give
Hispanics a better chance, and it was knee-deep in the county's redistricting
process. It would be in this fight even if Carrillo still lived in Morgan
Hill.;   Asian-Americans also are seeking greater power through redistricting.
They are just emerging as a political force, and they're likely to gain some
influence. At least, they don't stand to lose a majority district, as
Hispanics do.;   District 3 can and should remain a Hispanic-majority
district, and it can be done by grouping together related downtown
neighborhoods. The failure to make that happen will be a chilling sign not
only to Hispanics but to all minorities inching toward real power in San Jose.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  MAYOR; SAN-JOSE; SUPPORT; LIFESTYLE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Mayor Susan Hammer and five San Jose City Council members were sworn into
office Monday in an early evening ceremony that drew almost 1,200 well-wishers
to the city's Convention Center.;    In a three-minute speech, Hammer
reiterated her pledge to "embrace the diversity of San Jose."  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  HAMMER HAILS S.J. DIVERSITY
CITES STRENGTH IN DIFFERENCES AS SHE, 5 OTHERS
TAKE OFFICE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "We rejoice in our differences and recognize them as our strengths," she
said, "because in the end the legacy of how we dealt with one another will be
far more important than any structure we build or any program we implement.";
  Hammer seemed to be attempting to differentiate herself from her
predecessor, Tom McEnery, who squabbled with the Hispanic community over
various downtown building plans.;    "We begin tonight a new era in San Jose's
history," Hammer said. "Juntos si podemos. Together we can do it.";    Among
those who applauded Hammer's brief speech were McEnery, San Francisco Mayor
Art Agnos, and Santa Clara County supervisors Rod Diridon and Ron Gonzales.
U.S. Rep. Don Edwards, D-San Jose, was to have introduced Hammer, but his
flight was delayed by bad weather. Gonzales substituted for him.;    Despite
the speechmaking and the catered reception that followed, Monday's ceremony
was strictly pro forma. Hammer and the others, who took office Jan. 1 under
city law, all were sworn in earlier at a series of private ceremonies in
December.;    Hammer, 52, was sworn in Dec. 26 by Superior Court Judge John
Flaherty, a longtime family friend, who again administered the oath Monday.
The gathering, held in the mayor's office, was attended by Hammer's husband,
parents and children.;    Other council members, including the three newly
elected representatives, repeated their oaths individually in front of City
Clerk Andrea Membreno.;    "We already had the circumstance, this is the
pomp," joked Andrea Leiderman, aide to council veteran Jim Beall, who is
beginning his last four-year term.;    It won't be the last of that pomp. The
mayor's Unity Breakfast, a tradition started eight years ago by McEnery, is
scheduled for Jan. 23. It is there that Hammer will deliver her first State of
the City speech.;    Monday's inauguration was put together to give the
politicians' supporters and city residents a chance to celebrate publicly,
said Gary Robinson, Hammer's chief of staff.;    "It seemed like a good way to
kick into a new administration . . . with a lot less than a full-blown gala,"
Robinson said. "I think people are pleased and believe it's a good way for the
new administration to begin. We haven't heard a word of criticism.";
Robinson and his staff had expected about 750 to attend the event, but by
early Monday afternoon more than 1,000 people had said they would be there.;
 Although Hammer's staff sent out about 2,000 invitations, the ceremony and
reception were open to everyone at no charge.;    The catered reception that
followed the mayor's brief speech and the oaths featured cheese, fruit,
vegetables, egg rolls, wine and Calistoga water.;    The $10,000 price tag
will be paid mostly from a part of the mayor's budget that was set aside for
the transition, said Robinson. Any cost overrun will most likely be paid from
money in Hammer's "Friends Committee" campaign account, he said.;    In
addition to Hammer and Beall, who represents District 9, the other newly
sworn-in council members are veteran Blanca Alvarado from District 5 and
newcomers Trixie Johnson from District 1, David Pandori from District 3, and
George Shirakawa from District 7.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     An 8-3 council majority paid tribute to Tom McEnery, the city's 61st mayor,
by renaming the edifice for the man it called a seminal downtown visionary.
McEnery ended eight years as San Jose mayor in December.;    "A lot of people
participated in making this city what it is today, but only one person led,"
said Councilwoman Shirley Lewis, who voted for the name change with Mayor
Susan Hammer and council members Joe Head, David Pandori, Pat Sausedo, Trixie
Johnson, Nancy Ianni and Judy Stabile.;    Council members George Shirakawa,
Jim Beall and Blanca Alvarado dissented.;    Other opponents were members of
the Korean War Veterans Association, the American G.I. Forum, and the Veterans
of Foreign Wars, who touted a "San Jose Memorial Convention Center." Said Mike
Borquez, commander of VFW Post 344: "You should start by memorializing the
many, instead of the few.";    Several Hispanic representatives were also
passionate opponents, including Al Rodriguez, the owner of KAZA-AM 1290, a
Spanish-speaking radio station, and Sofia Mendoza, a community activist.;
"Name the street he lives on McEnery Street, and put the Fallon statue in his
front yard," said Mendoza, alluding to the controversy over city pioneer
Thomas Fallon that tainted McEnery in the eyes of many Hispanics.;    But
there was plenty of testimony in McEnery's favor.;    The San Jose Juniors
showed up 40-strong to vouch for McEnery, who has supported the 2-year-old
teen-age volleyball club since it began two years ago. "Mayor McEnery deserves
the recognition for all the things he's done with youth," said Emely Bigge,
17, a senior at Independence High.;    In other issues, the council designated
the Jose Theater a city landmark and hiked residential garbage collection
rates from $7.59 per household to $9.80 per month, effective July 1.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  THE SAN JOSE City Council has delivered a body check to local culture by
deciding that Pamela and Bill Resch cannot hold salon-style piano recitals in
their home.;   This is the couple, you may remember, who were busted last
summer after two undercover San Jose vice squad officers attended a recital at
which Pamela Resch performed works by Beethoven, Chopin and Liszt.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  A SOUR NOTE FOR S.J. CULTURE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     This is the same vice squad, you may also remember, that gets naked and
goes to any length to bust suspected prostitutes.;   Anyway, the recital issue
came down to whether the Resches were running an illegal business. For seven
years, they've performed salon-style concerts in their storybook cottage in
San Jose's Naglee Park neighborhood and charged admission -- $25 per guest.;
This included a glass of wine along with a piano recital by Pamela Resch, who
has played concert halls in New York, London and Vienna.;   Until the
Beethoven bust last summer, the only charge against her had been a 1980 New
York Times review saying she'd been "too unbridled" with a Bach piece in
Carnegie Hall.;   BUT LAST summer, the state Alcoholic Beverage Control office
called to remind the Resches that they couldn't serve wine without a state
liquor license. They stopped.;   But a police investigation continued. The
officers turned up evidence that the Resches lacked a business license. Their
house was not zoned for commercial (concert) use. They owed back business
taxes. They owed penalty payments in addition to back business taxes.;   They
started the recitals to recapture the 19th-century world of classical music,
when there were no great concert halls and so Beethoven and Chopin and Haydn
performed in patrons' homes.;   The question before the city council Tuesday
night was whether that was an appropriate activity for a 1990s San Jose home.;
  Councilman David Pandori, whose district includes the Naglee Park
neighborhood, proposed designating the Resches as artists in residence and
giving them a conditional permit to resume their concerts.;   "Allowing these
concerts can enhance the quality and uniqueness of our city," he said.;   The
proposal was narrowly drawn to limit sound, audience size and parking, and to
prohibit booze -- restrictions the Resches agreed with. But it also opened the
way to designate other artists in residence in other downtown neighborhoods.;
 Seemed like a neat idea for a city whose current cultural notoriety comes
from landing the Sharks, a National Hockey League franchise.;   MORE THAN 100
concertgoers wrote letters of support. More than 40 supporters showed up
Tuesday night. Neighbors even signed a petition saying they had no problems
with noise or traffic.;   Pandori, joined by Mayor Susan Hammer and council
members Jim Beall and Nancy Ianni, voted for the ordinance. Seven turned it
down.;   Their problems ranged from deciding who is an artist in residence to
discriminating against neighborhoods outside the downtown area to law
enforcement.;   "So they voted against us, but they let people hold Tupperware
parties in their homes and hold garage sales without having business
licenses," Bill Resch said Wednesday morning as he prepared to cancel the
couple's annual Christmas Bach celebration.;   In fairness, it should be noted
that Mayor Hammer and several council members, including several who voted
against their home concerts, told the Resches they would help them find a more
public facility.;   But you've got to wonder, the way things have gone, just
what they might have in mind.;   The Cow Palace maybe? Between periods, while
they sweep the ice at the Sharks games?  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  ANALYSIS; SAN-JOSE; CITY; MANAGEMENT; GOVERNMENT; OFFICIAL  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  As City Manager Les White mulls a dozen police chief candidates and carves a
leading role for his office in the city's pursuit of a new baseball stadium,
he shows convincing proof that a council-appointed manager still can drive San
Jose government.;   The departure of Tom McEnery from the mayor's office in
December gave White a chance to co-opt power on two fronts: New Mayor Susan
Hammer had to prove she could fill McEnery's shoes, and Redevelopment Agency
Executive Director Frank Taylor, White's peer and sometime rival, lost his
most potent patron.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  CITY MANAGER EMERGES AS POWER IN SAN JOSE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Analysis  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Ten months later, as the power vacuum gives way to power-sharing, White has
emerged as a catalytic force in a consensus-driven, coalition form of
government. At the same time, White and city council members say Hammer shows
all signs of assuming the strong-mayor role McEnery bequeathed her.;   At
Hammer's lead, doors are open everywhere in City Hall. Hammer meets with
White. Hammer meets with Taylor. Hammer meets with White and Taylor. White and
Taylor are seen on long tete-a-tete walks. All three meet one-on-one,
regularly, with city council members.;   Leslie Robert White, 51, a native of
Dinuba, a Tulare County farm town, was named city manager in May 1989. A
6-foot bear of a man with a salt-and-pepper beard and an occasionally volcanic
temper, White has an activist view of his role in government.;   Asked to
comment on his power, he said, half in jest, "Like most city managers, I feel
there's never enough of it.";   At times, White chafes at the city charter
checks and balances that dilute his authority, such as the council's veto
power over his department head appointments. But he admits, "I have to be a
realist and deal with the cards that have been dealt.";   This year White has
built his coalitions quietly, increasing his influence without upstaging the
mayor or the council.;   Consider the case of the ballpark. While the mayor
takes credit for the initiative to lure the San Francisco Giants, White has
put two of his deputies, Darrell Dearborn and D. Kent Dewell, squarely in the
middle of the stadium team.;   Straightforward stuff, on its face. Because
taxes may be raised to pay for the stadium, White has a legitimate claim on
the project.;   But the redevelopment agency -- an arm of government outside
White's domain -- has budgeted $40 million for the stadium and is paying the
lion's share now for consultants that White and his deputies will help manage.
The stadium site, near Highway 237 and Zanker Road, is in a redevelopment
area, but last spring, Hammer said she had to twist Taylor's arm to get him to
support the stadium.;   And when two council reports were produced last month
for the stadium initiative -- one by Hammer, working with White's staff, and
one by Taylor's staff -- Hammer called the agency memo "totally misleading."
It put forward a long-term cost -- $860,000 -- that was at odds with the
$640,000 sum the mayor had used at her news conference days earlier.;   This
all adds up to a large role for White, and a peripheral role for Taylor, in
what Hammer calls San Jose's "biggest project ever.";   "The agency's role is
much more limited on the Giants," Hammer aide Bob Brownstein said. "It's
essentially a city project. Frank is basically a downtown-oriented
redevelopment director. He didn't cede authority (because) he never competed
for authority.";   Then there is the police chief selection, a choice White
will make this month. His pick to succeed Joe McNamara could put a lasting
mark on the city, perhaps outliving White's own term in office.;   As with the
stadium effort, White has asserted his authority while consulting the mayor
and the council and spreading the credit around. He held a public forum in
May. He sought council help in crafting interview questions. Then, last
weekend, he closed up shop, sequestering his staff and the 12 semifinalists in
a hotel while he led the grill sessions.;   The choice, he said, is his to
make. The council won't challenge him.;   Rookie Councilman David Pandori, who
earlier this year accused White of grabbing power, now speaks of him as a team
player.;   "The administration works through the mayor's office," Pandori
said. "Whether it's on the budget, whether it's on the Giants, on any issue,
they coordinate with the mayor. That practice has been ingrained here in the
city.";   Pandori's comments underscore White's most effective trait: to be
everywhere behind the scenes, and nowhere stealing the show.;   White's
influence is so well-hidden that an elementary civics lesson can seem
startling. In the city charter, Article III says simply: "The municipal
government established by this charter shall be known as the Council-Manager
form of government." Nowhere does it mention the mayor.;   Councilman Joe
Head, an advocate of the strong-mayor government and no stranger to power
himself, said: "The manager is a very powerful position, and Les is a very
powerful person, no question about that. . . . The importance of the manager
is now getting some focus. He's getting a chance to make some sexy decisions."  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  SAN-JOSE; POLICE; OFFICIAL; EMPLOYMENT  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  The last time San Jose hired a police chief, there was no community forum, no
head-hunting search firm, no city council politics.;    Instead, there was
just then-City Manager Ted Tedesco, who simply went out and found somebody he
liked: Joseph McNamara.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  S.J.'S HIGH-CALIBER SEARCH FOR TOP COP
EXTENSIVE SELECTION PROCESS DRAWS SCRUTINY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     But times have changed since Tedesco's 1976 solo search. Community groups
want a role in selecting the next chief. Council members can veto City Manager
Les White's nominee.;    Choosing McNamara's successor is arguably White's
most important decision since he himself was appointed two years ago. It is
doubly sensitive in a city with no ethnic majority and a new mayor actively
crusading against drugs and gangs -- and for "diversity.";    Members of the
Hispanic community tout two local candidates, Hispanic-American deputy chiefs
Lou Cobarruviaz and Luis Hernandez. "This is a historic opportunity," said
Victor Garza, president of the local American GI Forum, a Hispanic-American
veterans group.;    The decision is White's, unless the council vetoes his
choice. Council members -- and Mayor Susan Hammer -- say they will have only
indirect influence on White's nomination.;    But sensing the political mine
fields, White has installed a methodical, cautious -- and widely praised --
hiring plan. It includes a public brainstorming session on the ideal new
chief, held last month; a national talent search, under way soon; and a
battery of interviews and background checks before the chief is hired in late
summer or early fall.;    For now, White is casting a broad net. He wants
candidates from inside and outside the city, women and minority members, and
those with "sensitivity to the interests and needs of a diverse population.";
  Once White gets a field of 15 or so from San Francisco-based head-hunting
firm Slavin Nevin and Associates, he'll put each through the paces:;
(check) Grilling by a pair of five-member panels composed of people from
community groups and professionals in government and law enforcement.;
(check) Back-to-back one-on-one meetings with White and Assistant City Manager
Regina V.K. Williams, who oversees the police department and has hired police
chiefs in Richmond, Va., and Ypsilanti, Mich. Williams has already influenced
this hiring round; the May forum, a San Jose first, was modeled after one she
held in Richmond.;    (check) A lengthy psychological exam.;    (check) A
meeting with some top city officials, including Fire Chief Robert Osby.;
White will then pick three or four finalists, keeping the names secret from
almost everyone, except Hammer.;    Then the fun starts.;    While reporters,
city officials and police try to uncover the short list, White will discreetly
check references. If a candidate is from out of town, White, Williams or a key
subordinate will take an unannounced field trip to gauge that community's
sentiments. How the potential chief fares in his hometown paper is crucial.;
 Decision time;    By late summer or early fall, White will reveal his choice
to the city council. Hammer will meet the nominee before White lets the
council interview the candidate. A 1986 city charter amendment granted the
council the power of advice and consent whenever the manager appoints a
department head.;    It's similar to how the Senate reviews presidential
nominees but with key differences: Interviews are done in closed session, and
so far no one has been rejected. Since 1986, the council has approved several
city directors, but this will be the first fire or police chief nominee
grilled.;    Before the grilling starts, the council will help shape the
questions White asks his short list candidates, but its influence on the final
choice will come sparingly, if at all.;    Little lobbying so far;
Councilwoman Blanca Alvarado said she has already rejected some in her
district who want her to lobby for a minority member. "I don't intend to do
anything," she said. "I have to rely on the city manager's judgment.";
Hammer and her staff are also giving White leeway. "It's the manager's
prerogative to bring forth one candidate," the mayor said.;    In interviews
with elected officials, only Councilman David Pandori floated a challenge to
White's authority. "It would be interesting to come up with a short list
rather than just one name," he said, allowing that White had the right to make
the final nomination.;    "I'd be very interested in having the ability to
question a short list of candidates.";    Asked if he would consider Pandori's
idea, White said: "No. You can't get too many people involved in managing the
city. Next question.";    So far, lobbying from community groups has been
limited largely to the May forum, which drew praise for McNamara and hopes
that the new chief would be just as progressive. It also won White kudos from
minorities and the council. "Les seemed to hear us," said Paul Wysocki, a
political activist for gays and lesbians.;    One intriguing plug has come
from Ronald L. Havner, who oversees the city's police academy at Evergreen
Valley College. Havner wrote White on behalf of Deputy Chief Cobarruviaz. As
the summer winds on, similar testimonials for the city's other top cops --
Acting Chief Fred Abram, deputy chiefs Tom Frazier, Bill Mallett and Hernandez
-- are likely to pour into city hall.;    White said he will listen to
everyone equally. "I don't run this place like a monarchy or some fiefdom.";
 White unlike predecessor;  He stands in contrast to former City Manager
Tedesco -- now an American Airlines executive in Dallas -- who in May 1976
fired former Chief Robert Murphy without consulting council members, saying
the chief had lost control of a police force that was "overly aggressive.";
"If I was going to take responsibility for firing Murphy, then I was going to
take the responsibility for finding a replacement," said Tedesco, who served
from 1973 to 1978. " . . . I viewed it as my choice and my decision.";
Tedesco did not advertise for candidates. "My assumption was the best people
are not out there . . . applying for a job.";    Nor did he hire a search
firm. "Suppose they don't come up with the right ones? Then you've to send
them back (out).";    Instead, he phoned chiefs at 25 large cities and asked
them who they considered the top five or six police chiefs in America.
"Interestingly enough," Tedesco said, "the same names kept coming up.";    He
called them up and encouraged them to apply -- including Kansas City chief,
Joe McNamara.;    In August 1976, Tedesco announced the hiring of McNamara,
who raised officers' standards and improved race relations. When McNamara
retired last month, many hailed him as the nation's finest police chief.;
Tedesco criticized White's forum, which let citizens voice what qualities they
wanted in a chief, saying it accomplishes little and abrogates the manager's
responsibility. "You democratize the thing to the point of absurdity," he
said.;    But Tedesco fully realizes that his method has gone the way of the
dinosaur. "I can't give Les any advice," Tedesco said. "He is a city manager
in a different time."  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  SAN-JOSE; NEIGHBORHOOD; PARK; CRIME; SAFETY; PROTEST  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  An aroused downtown San Jose neighborhood, fearful of crime near its park,
held a candlelight vigil Wednesday night and demanded more city spending and
police patrols to snuff increasing problems with gangs and drugs.;   The
protest foretold dilemmas the city council will face early next year when it
tackles a $20.6 million budget shortfall in a second straight year of terrible
fiscal news. Though city services may be cut, parks and police remain potent
political touchstones throughout San Jose.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  A RISING DRUMBEAT AGAINST CRIME
S.J. NEIGHBORS PROTEST PARK'S DANGERS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Joined by Councilman David Pandori, more than 100 people bundled up in the
night air to walk a solemn square around Backesto Park. They started at North
13th and Jackson streets, holding tapered candles, and walking to the martial
beat of a tenor drum.;   "I played here as a child, my daughter played here as
a child, and now the kids can't even play," said one marcher, Marlene Perez,
40, who lives on North 16th Street.;   The 10 1/2-acre park, one of 143 in San
Jose, is the focal point of a working-class neighborhood on San Jose's North
Side, traditionally ethnic Italian but recently turning Hispanic and Southeast
Asian.;   It is known for its lighted softball diamond, its singular orange
tent covering bocce ball courts, and the folksy neighborhood eateries at two
of its corners, Rollo's Donut &amp; Coffee Shop and Emma's Taqueria.;   People in
the neighborhood suspect that crime has grown in and around Backesto since
Roosevelt Park, a few blocks southeast, became a targeted Project Crackdown
area in March.;   Project Crackdown is a city program to clean up
neighborhoods and stop illegal drug sales.;   At an evening meeting in Holy
Cross Church, organized by People Acting in Community Together, people talked
about thugs gathering in the park at night, wearing what appear to be gang
colors. Merchants were said to be harassed by vandals. "Drug houses" were said
to proliferate in the area.;   The Rev. Chuck La Verde, a charismatic Catholic
priest, told Pandori and Police Chief Lou Cobarruviaz: "Remember the Alamo.
Remember Pearl Harbor, they were saying last week. Remember Backesto Park.";
Crime statistics are inconclusive. From March 16 to Sept. 15, according to one
police report, seven incidents were reported in Backesto, resulting in four
arrests and one citation. During the same period in 1990, 11 incidents were
reported, resulting in one arrest and six citations. And conversations with
police who know the area suggest that crime has not moved from Roosevelt to
Backesto.;   But city parks official Nancy Johnson sympathized with people's
fears. "Perception is reality," she said in an interview. "If they perceive
something is changed, that is their reality.";   And Pandori, in an interview,
said that the neighborhood is right to be vigilant. "Project Crackdown is more
a result of failure than success," the first-term councilman said. "The idea
on the North Side is not to let things deteriorate. It's a legitimate point.";
  To that end, Pandori is proposing a police call box near the park, more
lighting, graffiti cleanup, more police and park rangers, and a police
community advisory group.;   Many of these proposals are small-ticket items.
But it remains to be seen how many new cops and rangers San Jose can afford.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  LETTER  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Last Tuesday evening I attended a downtown theatrical performance which was
very avant-garde in its concepts. The minor players had all the best lines and
the star of the show, a well established actress, let down her mask and gave
us all a glimpse at the private side of a very public person.;   I really
believe the producers of the show deserve top billing in the discredits. They
staged the show carefully. They funded many of the players and pulled off a
coup by duping many of the performers into believing they were their parts.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION>

<MEMO>  Letters to the Editor  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The theater? The San Jose City Council chambers. The star? Mayor Susan
Hammer. The players? The unemployed and the Oak Grove School District. The
producer? The developers behind the Levin General Plan Amendment in the
Edenvale area. The remaining cast? Excluding the six council members who voted
with Mayor Hammer for reconsideration, the rest of us were and remain . . .
victims.;   Let's get to the plot. San Jose has a general plan. The city
planner understands it, police officers and firefighters understand it, the
head of parks and recreation understands it, the school board understands it.
Most everyone understands it -- except developers and friends. Mayor Hammer
either doesn't understand it, or chooses to ignore it, as she does when
various heads of city departments attempt to clarify the situation for her.;
OK, now to the nitty-gritty. 600-900 new houses to be built on a piece of land
designated industrial. It's called affordable housing. Houses between $200,000
to $300,000 (as I said, affordable housing). A piece of land, designated
industrial, unequipped to deal with educational needs, police and fire
protection requirements or the inherent traffic implications. None of these
were satisfactorily addressed in the environmental impact report. All of the
aforementioned services have been stretched to their limits.;   It would have
been very easy to know at whom to boo and hiss and whom to applaud, if it
weren't for the unemployment problem. My heart hurt. These were mothers and
fathers, friends and neighbors begging for a chance to work. I want them to
work. I want to tell them it will be better.;   The Levin Plan Amendment is
not the answer. It is a short-term solution to a long-term problem that will,
in fact, greatly exacerbate this problem. I understand their fears, as do the
developers. Empathizing and playing on the fears and weaknesses of others were
the bases for the antithetical arguments given at the meeting. As I stood
waiting for my turn at the podium and a chance to speak, I realized Mayor
Hammer greeted her friends on a first-name basis, and all her friends were
pro-developers.;   I am outraged. Councilman David Pandori earned high marks
for his efforts, as did the other three council members who voted against the
mayor and endured despite her condescending attitude toward them. They fought
for what is right and I hope we all will continue to do just that. Recall
Mayor Hammer. We need someone who takes our lives as seriously as she takes
her own name.;   -- Yvonne Rafi;   San Jose  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  EDITORIAL; SAN-JOSE; CITY; COUNCIL; POLICY; HOUSING; DEVELOPMENT  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  ARE a few hundred new houses worth the cost of abandoning San Jose's
principles of prudent planning for growth?;   No. But some city council
members seem ready to approve housing in the middle of open land in Edenvale,
pure urban sprawl, because they think it will attract industry.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  WRONG HOUSING IDEA
MORE REASONS WHY SAN JOSE CITY COUNCIL SHOULD
REJECT THE EDENVALE PROJECT  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     They're going by anecdotal evidence, much of it passed on by the developers
who want to build the housing -- Shea Homes and Gibson Speno. Yet the city's
professional staff is convinced this plan is bad: It will drain services from
existing neighborhoods, and it may even harm efforts to market redevelopment
land.;   San Jose got to be the way it is -- sprawling, often impossible to
serve with mass transit -- because of just this sort of growth: approved
because developers asked, not because of good planning.;   The city tried to
change that in recent years. But now Mayor Susan Hammer is sending a different
signal.;   She's not the only one changing direction. Councilwoman Pat Sausedo
had opposed a 1988 housing plan in Edenvale industrial land because, according
to council minutes, "the council needs to look at the economic plan
comprehensively, not on a piecemeal basis." Yet now she's the head cheerleader
for this far more damaging project.;   More surprising is the change by Joe
Head, who two years ago opposed a similar plan because, again according to
minutes, "any major general plan change must be plan-centered, not
site-centered." He says he changed his mind because he's impatient with the
city's slowness in finding room for more single family homes.;   But that's an
argument to speed up planning studies, not to toss the principles out the
window.;   The lack of planning eventually struck Councilman David Pandori,
who at first supported this year's Edenvale proposal. He now says he will vote
to study the site further, joining the three original opponents of the plan in
their effort to seek a compromise with the mayor.;   George Shirakawa and
Blanca Alvarado should join them as well: Both represent low-income
neighborhoods that need more police protection and code enforcement, not less.
This housing will drain those services from their areas.;   The council made a
bad decision last month, but that can be reversed Tuesday, when the hearing on
the plan is reopened.;   Hammer prides herself on action, not study. But there
is no honor in action that disregards the best interests of the city. The
council should study how best to use Edenvale land and then -- only then --
consider proposals to develop it.; FOLLOW-UP . . . The hearing will be 7 p.m.
Tuesday at city hall, 801 N. First St., San Jose.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  While Mayor Susan Hammer keeps mum on her most significant development vote
since taking office, two of California's home-building giants have forged an
alliance to persuade the city to open up a large South San Jose tract for
housing.;   The city council will vote tonight on whether to convert 92 acres
of industrial land in Edenvale to a cluster of up to 990 homes, developed by
Shea Homes, the Gibson Speno Co. and Kaufman &amp; Broad South Bay Inc. All three
helped bankroll Hammer's 1990 mayoral campaign.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  HOME BUILDER ALLIANCE TO TEST CITY'S RESOLVE
EDENVALE PROPOSAL CALLS FOR UP TO 990 DWELLINGS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The developers face a very close vote, though some City Hall nose counters
predict they'll win in a 7-4 roll call, with Hammer's backing.;   Kaufman &amp;
Broad joined forces about a month ago to build the homes with Shea. The
newcomer's arrival has political resonance around City Hall because Hammer
cast a swing vote exactly three years ago to allow a nearby Kaufman &amp; Broad
development, over the strenuous complaint of then-Mayor Tom McEnery.;   The
Edenvale parcel, owned by Monterey Highway businessman Richard Levin, is now a
grazing field tucked between Highway 101 and the Diablo Range, just north of
Coyote Valley. For eight years, city officials have viewed it as a site for an
industrial campus, one piece of a hoped-for economic engine called "Silicon
Valley South.";   The plan aimed to build jobs on the city's southern fringe
before housing, in a bid to ease freeway congestion and lay away prime land
for San Jose's tax base.;   Shea Homes -- builder of the huge Silver Creek and
River Oaks projects in Evergreen and north San Jose -- and Gibson Speno --
supplier of capital and political know-how -- applied in March for an
exception to that policy. They argued that jobs won't come unless housing is
built first.;   The application is coming to a head with the city's annual
general plan hearings.;   Hammer, who met with the developers a week ago,
won't say how she's leaning. Vice Mayor Pat Sausedo, whose district
encompasses the parcel, wouldn't return phone calls. Council members Nancy
Ianni, George Shirakawa and Blanca Alvarado say they're undecided. Jim Beall
is leaning toward the project. David Pandori and Joe Head say they're for it.
Judy Stabile, Trixie Johnson and Shirley Lewis say they're against it.;
Hammer, who apparently has not lobbied the council on the amendment, said
Wednesday afternoon the media has "blown the issue out of proportion.";   But
Lewis said the developers "see a window of opportunity here with the new
leadership, and I think they're testing that. I don't think the council will
fold on this.";   On Nov. 14, 1988, when Kaufman &amp; Broad brought a similar
issue to the council, Hammer, Ianni and Beall voted for it in the majority,
while Sausedo, Alvarado, Lewis and Stabile voted no.;   That 500-unit project,
known as California Maison, now sits just west of the Levin property, at
Monterey Highway and Bernal Road. It sells about eight units a week, starting
at $150,000 -- "the fastest-selling community in Northern California," boasted
Roger Menard, Kaufman &amp; Broad's South Bay president.; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED;
The city council will meet at 7 p.m. tonight to discuss the general plan in
the council chambers at 801 N. First St.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  EDITORIAL; AIRPORT; NOISE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  THE convenience and economic benefits of having an airport downtown are not
without cost.;    But in deciding the future of San Jose International
Airport, the city council needs to keep in mind that the benefits far outweigh
the drawbacks.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  THE SOUND OF GROWTH
NEGOTIATE NOISE CONTROLS; BUT REMEMBER, CLEARLY
THE AIRPORT MUST EXPAND  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     For the past several months, city officials have been listening to
complaints from people who live near the airport and fear that a proposed
master plan for expansion will make their neighborhoods unlivable.;    The
proposal would triple the number of passengers using the airport to 21.2
million per year by 2010. It would increase the number of flights coming and
going per hour from 18 to 44.;    Meanwhile, American Airlines can't fill up
its flights to Tokyo because the planes would be too heavy to take off on San
Jose's short runways. And on two occasions, the Tokyo flight had to make a
fueling stop in Oakland because a full tank would have kept it grounded here.;
   That's ridiculous. Clearly the airport must grow. Runways must be long
enough to handle overseas flights, and the growth of population and business
in Silicon Valley demands better overall service.;    Councilman David
Pandori, who represents neighborhoods near the airport, worries that it's
growing for the sake of growth, with too little attention to specific needs
and too little concern for noise and other problems. He wants further study of
those issues. That's fair.;    Mayor Susan Hammer also says the proposed plan
needs more study and, like Pandori, believes noise controls and curfews should
eventually be part of city law. That's fair too, as long as the rules are
negotiated with the airlines first to make certain they're reasonable.;    The
city takes a measured approach to planning for land development; it doesn't
fill up every open space with the maximum density. Airport growth should be
planned the same way. Before approving the master plan, council members must
be certain that the airport really needs to handle 21 million people by 2010,
and they need to understand the traffic and noise impacts of that growth on
the rest of the city. They need more information before they can vote on a
master plan.;    But the airport is a tremendous asset to this city, and to
remain one, it must grow. And neighbors have got to face the fact that nothing
will ever make it quiet.; FOLLOW-UP . . .; A public hearing on the airport
master plan will be held at 7 p.m. Tuesday at San Jose City Hall, 801 N. First
St.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Two years after losing a bitter battle to add fast-moving Asian tile wagering
in its San Jose poker club, Garden City on Tuesday handily won its latest
high-stakes gamble with the San Jose City Council.;    The council finally
approved the club's request to substitute the so-called Asian games -- super
pan nine and double-handed poker -- for panguingue, known as pan.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  S.J. CARD CLUB WINS OK FOR TWO NEW GAMES  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Mercury News Staff Writer Michelle Guido contributed to this report.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Double-handed poker is almost identical to pai gow, a Chinese tile game
that the council rejected two years ago. Then, however, the council did
approve substituting Texas hold-em for straight poker.;    Mayor Susan Hammer
said after the meeting that she may present her proposal for raising gambling
taxes or fees later this week. Garden City already pays more than $250,000 a
year in fees, but other cities that allow gambling charge much more.;
Hammer contends that the fee proposal is not related to permission to change
games but is simply a way of whittling down the city's projected $24 million
budget deficit.;    Despite the possibility of higher fees, the 8-3 vote was a
major victory for the club's owners, the Dalis family.;    "It lets us stay
competitive with other card clubs in the area," said Nicholas J. Dalis, a
former club president.;    Favors fewer restrictions;  The council vote was
not the only good news for Dalis and his family, which owns the 40-table club,
the largest in Northern California. Councilwoman Shirley Lewis hinted that she
thinks the club should be allowed to offer any game that's legal in the
state.;    "I don't think there's any other business in town that has to go
through this kind of thing," Lewis said.;    Police, who argue that poker
clubs are magnets for crime, groaned at the prospect.;    Tuesday's revision
drew strong opposition from the police department, on paper at least. The
council made it clear that it didn't want to listen to police crime statistics
and other arguments again.;    The only vocal opposition came from a woman who
said her husband is undergoing therapy for a gambling problem.;    "I don't
know how you can allow more games when it should be closed down," Nidia
Fonseca Hanson said. "My husband has been approached by bookies, solicited by
prostitutes while playing there. . . . The problem is, you don't know what
it's like to be called by bookies threatening to throw acid in your face if
you don't pay them thousands of dollars.";    Hammer noted that the club is
legally licensed and was not seeking an increase in tables, total number of
games or betting limits. She said a request to substitute games is a
legitimate way to "keep up with changing demographics of this city.";
'Asian games';    Super pan nine and double-handed poker are known as "Asian
games" because they originated in China and are tremendously popular among
Chinese and Vietnamese. The games are fast-paced and high-stakes, with
thousands of dollars changing hands within minutes, police say.;    Hanson
persisted, referring to the Dalises' pending trial in Superior Court on
conspiracy and tax charges stemming from an alleged multimillion-dollar
profit-skimming operation said to have been run by Nick Dalis, and to
additional charges that club owners tried to expand their political power by
arranging illegal campaign contributions.;    "Doesn't that cast aspersions on
their honesty?" she asked.;    Hammer retorted, "One of the things I like
about this country is, people are innocent until proven guilty.";    But
Councilwoman Trixie Johnson, who was criticized during her campaign last year
for accepting Garden City donations, said she would rather not vote for game
changes "until after the legal clouds have cleared." She was joined in her
opposition by David Pandori, who did not take donations from the club, and
Nancy Ianni.;    Majority backs Hammer;  The rest of the council members
supported Hammer. They included George Shirakawa, who said he has played cards
at the club for more than two decades.;    In other action Tuesday:;
(check) The council unanimously approved Councilwoman Blanca Alvarado's
proposal to give residents a new conduit for police misconduct complaints.
Under her plan, a deputy city manager will be designated as "community
relations liaison" to receive and track the complaints.;    Alvarado's plan
also asks the city attorney's office to look at the legality of existing
procedures for public disclosure of the number, types and disposition of
misconduct charges filed against officers.;    (check) The council took the
first step toward redrawing the city's 10 council districts, based on the 1990
census. On a unanimous vote, the council approved Hammer's plan to appoint a
committee to set redistricting guidelines so that another appointed group can
get to work immediately when detailed census figures are released.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  AUTO; HOUSING; COST; CONTROVERSY; SAN-JOSE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  A group of parking lot owners wants the city of San Jose to put the brakes on
a plan to prop up downtown commerce by expanding free and city-subsidized
parking.;    Among the biggest losers under the new plan are owners of private
lots near the city-owned Market Street Garage, including former Mayor Tom
McEnery's family, owners of a surface lot across San Pedro Street.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  PARKING LOT OWNERS FIGHT S.J.
PLAN WOULD EXTEND SUBSIDIES TO SOME  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Under the proposal, that garage and a lot at Market and San Carlos streets
will offer free parking after 6 p.m. and on weekends. Free parking would also
be available at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center after 9:30 p.m.;    A
city-subsidized validation program already available at other city-owned lots
and some private lots and garages would also be expanded, increasing the
number of subsidized parking spaces downtown to 5,240.;    Although the
McEnerys could not be reached for comment, the owners of several other lots
say they are hopping mad because the expanded freebies will lure customers
away. Attorney James Boccardo, who owns several lots, has fired off a letter
to Mayor Susan Hammer warning that "unless sober second thought" prevails, the
parking firms will sue, claiming unfair government competition with private
business.;    The private firms also claim the city has vastly underestimated
the money it will lose. Currently, the city estimates lost revenue at some
$217,000 annually. The new program would cost another $150,000 in annual lost
parking fees, according to staff estimates.;    But private-lot owners say the
real cost could be five times as high, based on the current $3-per-night
charge imposed at most downtown lots.;    A "total realistic cost" would be
closer to $2.3 million annually, concluded Albert Schlarmann, a CityPark
executive. That would include staffing garages -- like the one under the
Pavilion -- that participate in the validation program, and lost weekend
daytime revenue and other labor costs, he said.;    Joe Bass, the city's
director of streets and traffic, said he has not seen the private-lot owners'
figures, though he admitted that the costs of the program are "probably
higher" than staff estimates that were developed a few years ago.;    "I doubt
if it's in the millions," Bass said, guessing that the expansion would cost
less than $200,000.;    City politicians, who have bemoaned the downtown
parking situation for years -- and who have to listen to merchants complain
about slow business -- seem anxious to do something more to lure more people
downtown.;    "All the city facilities ought to be part of the program," said
Councilman David Pandori, who represents the downtown.;    The city council is
scheduled to consider the expansion concept next week, with a finalized plan
completed by September. Bass acknowledges that private parking firms have "a
valid point . . . this is going to affect some of them.";    "But they're
still surviving. The lots we see still seem to be functioning well."  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  San Jose Mayor Susan Hammer plans to step up efforts to lure the Giants away
from San Francisco by asking for $640,000 to pay consultants to study the
design, site and financing for a proposed South Bay stadium.;   Hammer's plan
-- expected to be announced at a news conference today -- includes $200,000 to
begin designing the stadium at Highway 237 and Zanker Road before voters
approve the site or the plan.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  GIANT PLANS STEP UP
HAMMER SEEKS CONSULTANT FEES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Expects majority backing; Hammer will make her request at next Tuesday's
council meeting and said she expects the majority of San Jose's council
members will back her plans.;   "If you're about to undertake the biggest
project ever in the city, it seems to me that you spend a bit of money
beforehand to make it work," the mayor said Tuesday.;   The money would be
taken from $10 million that was set aside earlier this year by the city's
redevelopment agency for economic development around the stadium site. No one
has provided estimates of how much it would cost to build the stadium.;
Action sought before vote; Hammer will ask that the $200,000 design fund be
spent before residents vote on a stadium plan next April or June. If voters
approve, spending money now will ensure that the stadium can be finished
before April 1996, according to Deputy City Manager Darrell Dearborn.;   "To
preserve the schedule we'll need to spend that money in advance," said
Dearborn. "To ensure that it is constructed in 40 months we may need to begin
architectural design before an election.";   City ordinances forbid San Jose
from building a stadium without voter approval. However, City Attorney Joan
Gallo said those ordinances don't prevent the city from doing exploratory work
on a stadium.;   In addition to the $200,000 design fund, Hammer wants to set
aside $320,000 for attorney Stan Berliner, who negotiated with the Giants
during last year's unsuccessful attempt to get county voters to pass a stadium
proposal.;   Berliner's contract would cover all negotiations with the
baseball team as well as negotiations with the state of California for 55
acres that the state owns within the 138-acre proposed stadium site. Berliner
also would research the legality of using taxes or other financing to build
the stadium.;   Berliner was paid $366,567 by the Joint Powers Authority, the
city-county agency that oversaw last year's failed Santa Clara stadium plans,
and was criticized by some associated with that deal for charging exorbitant
rates.;   In the current contract, he said he is giving San Jose a "government
rate" that cuts $40 off the usual hourly rate of Berliner partners and up to
30 percent off the rate of associates and paralegals.;   He also said that
although he has helped the San Jose Sharks hockey team negotiate a lease with
the city, he has no conflict of interest now working for the city with the
Giants.;   Gary Robinson, Hammer's chief of staff, said Berliner was chosen
because of his past experience in Giants negotiations. He also finished a
$20,000 contract with the city this summer for which he and Dearborn traveled
to Baltimore, Denver, Cleveland, Arlington, Va., and Milwaukee to study new
stadium proposals and financing plans.;   Hammer's request also includes
$25,000 for unforeseen costs and $95,000 for two financial advisers -- Tim
Mueller of Peat Marwick, who worked with the JPA during last year's stadium
negotiations, and Sam Katz of Philadelphia's Public Financing Management, who
advised the Giants. Dearborn said Katz helped pioneer the idea of financing a
stadium with the sales of luxury boxes at Miami's Joe Robbie Stadium.;
Hammer's support on the council appears solid, but some members, including
Trixie Johnson and David Pandori, questioned whether the consultants cost too
much.;   "I'm willing to go down the road for a while yet," Johnson said,
adding doubtfully, "It's an awful lot of money." Asked for her position, she
said, "It's a yes, but I haven't signed off on the dollar amount yet.";
Pandori said Berliner's contract may be too expensive, but agreed that the
city needs to spend some money to develop a ballot proposal.;   "Obviously we
can't just make one up," Pandori said.;   Meanwhile, the city of Santa Clara
is putting together a rival proposal for a stadium at the site voters
considered last year.;   The Santa Clara City Council voted Tuesday to spend
up to $37,500 to hire a congressional lobbyist to push an amendment to the
1986 federal tax law that would get the city tax-free financing for a joint
public and private stadium. The money was a loan from the general fund to the
city's Sports and Open Space Authority.;   However, congressional sources were
doubtful that the city could get such an amendment passed.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  San Jose Mayor Susan Hammer, facing a second straight year of lousy financial
news, gave her prescription Tuesday for an ailing city budget: the deepest
spending cuts of the past decade, a hiring freeze starting this week, and a
new gambling tax on card rooms.;   The city is short an estimated $20.6
million for next year's spending plan of $433 million, a bill due starting
July 1992. The city council appears ready to swallow most of the medicine, but
with little enthusiasm.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "We're getting to a point now where we don't have so many choices," said
Councilman Jim Beall. "We're desperately trying to avoid laying off people.
We're into pain now, real deep pain.";   Hammer is asking City Manager Les
White to plan cuts for most city departments of 9 percent, with 2 percent for
the police and fire departments. Then the city council will choose from these
measures next spring when it approves a new annual budget.;   Such cuts
haven't been talked about since the 1982 recession and the 1978 property tax
rollbacks from Proposition 13.;   "This is by far the worst I've seen," said
Hammer, who first ran for city council in 1982. Five months ago, the mayor and
council balanced a budget gap of equal magnitude for the fiscal year that
began July 1.;   Then, the city had healthy reserves. Now, the treasury is
thin.;   Hammer's recommendations, which she will spell out at a news
conference this afternoon:;   (check) Freeze hiring across the board, except
for sworn police and firefighters. The more jobs kept open now, the mayor
reasoned, the easier it will be to shuffle employees after cuts are enacted,
avoiding layoffs. This step nets $5 million through June, from which $3
million would be applied toward the next fiscal year's deficit.;   (check)
Shift $3.8 million from a savings kitty left over from last year, and skim $1
million from a separate fund for streets and traffic improvements.;   (check)
Tax city card clubs, which now pay only token annual fees, raising nearly $2.5
million. Most council members and Hammer are high on this tax. The owners of
the Garden City card club, San Jose's largest, have reportedly agreed to it,
but they could not be reached for comment. The mayor also wants to look at
several other new fees and taxes, but the gambling tax was singled out as the
easiest first hit.;   (check) Find $10.3 million in spending cuts --
essentially half the shortfall. City Manager White said he "generally agrees"
with this strategy. "We're going to have to bite the bullet harder this time,"
he said. Police and fire will probably be insulated from most cuts, but
libraries, park maintenance and other basic services will be threatened. So
will the staffs of the mayor and council.;   The council, which plans to
debate these proposals Thursday, was moody about the news and divided on a few
points.;   "I'm not quite sure the freeze is going to work, because we froze
last year," said Councilman George Shirakawa.;   Said Councilman David
Pandori: "The hiring freeze was overdue. It should have been done four months
ago.";   The economic mess, caused in large part by slumping sales tax and
property tax revenues, could force the council to start taking a more
pro-growth, pro-business stance on development issues.;   Hammer, for example,
was talking up the building of a baseball stadium in North San Jose and
development of an industrial park planned for the city's southern fringe.;
The Coyote Valley Research Park, just north of a controversial housing
preserve, exists in name only. If businesses were to approach City Hall about
starting "Silicon Valley South," Hammer said, "Let me tell you, they'll get
the open-door, first-class treatment from every department in this city.";
The mayor also said she would take a long look at a new tax on cigarettes, if
it proves legal for cities to enact such levies.;   "I don't mind taking on
the tobacco industry at all," Hammer said. "I can't think of a better issue to
take 'em on."; BUDGET BALANCING ACT; Mayor Susan Hammer proposed these actions
to avoid a projected $20.6 million shortfall in San Jose's general fund for
fiscal 1993. The city council will consider the proposals Thursday.; ...; Cut

arrested for conducting a business in their home without a license.  </LEADPARA>

CLASSICAL MUSIC CONCERT AT RESCH HOME  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Story; See also related article on page 1D of this section.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Nestled near San Jose State University, with its English garden and
stained-glass windows, the two-story house is an ideal setting for the Reschs'
19th-century-style recitals, what Pamela Resch now calls "my criminal
activities as a concert pianist.";   On that Sunday afternoon in July, concert
guests watched as uniformed police finger-printed Bill Resch -- jazz musician,
music teacher, trumpeter and orchestra coordinator for the San Jose Civic
Light Opera -- on his front lawn, in his tuxedo.;   "We couldn't believe what
we were seeing," says Cathy Yoshimoto, a Los Gatos resident who attended with
family and friends. "(The police) could have been more discreet. It was
obviously not a rock concert or a brothel. Why would they make such a scene?";
  It is a scene that has brought to a halt the Reschs' 7-year-long series of
classical music concerts -- even though the charges have been dropped. It is
also a scene that has aroused the support of friends, guests, neighbors, city
councilman David Pandori, Supervisor Zoe Lofgren -- and even conservative
pundit William F. Buckley Jr.;   Support pours in; Supporters have inundated
the mayor's office with letters protesting the arrest and pleading for the
concerts to continue. Buckley, who hosted a concert by Pamela Resch in his New
York home, wrote in an Aug. 19 letter to Mayor Susan Hammer:;   "I do hope you
will intervene in the matter and uphold the singular reputation San Jose
enjoys as a town hospitable to fine artistic events." Both Hammer and Buckley
were unavailable for comment.;   The issue will be heard by the city council
Nov. 19, when Pandori, representing the downtown area, will introduce a
proposal allowing the concerts to continue.;   "Good music isn't limited to
big concert halls," Pandori says. "We should bring the local zoning code up to
date to allow this activity in someone's home, with appropriate controls to
make sure it doesn't impact on adjacent areas.";   "I don't have to think
twice about supporting Pamela," says Yoshimoto, who plans to attend the
meeting. "We have to save her gift to the community. She's one of San Jose's
treasures.";   "I never knew a community could be so supportive -- once you
feel that strength behind you, you don't feel afraid anymore," says Pamela
Resch, a San Jose native who has performed world-wide.;   "I'm hopeful the
issue will be resolved," says Supervisor Lofgren. Of the police investigation,
she adds, "To put that kind of effort into something that isn't bothering
anyone -- when you've got drive-by shootings -- is bizarre.";   Upholding the
law; Wysuph says "this is not the crime of the century," but adds it was
"simply a case we followed up on. (The Reschs) were running a commercial
enterprise in violation of the law.";   "I'm not into people violating rules,"
Lofgren says, "but part of having a great city is allowing events like this to
flourish.";   Wysuph himself says of the event: "It was a wonderful afternoon.
(Pamela Resch) is an accomplished pianist. And if she were performing legally,
I would not hesitate to attend one of her concerts on my own time.";   But the
police sergeant may not get that chance, unless the city finds a way to
resolve the issue.;   The problem, Bill Resch says, is a "Kafka-esque
nightmare. The city says 'get a business license,' then it says we can't get
one. One hand says we can keep the concerts if we pay back-taxes; another hand
says pay the back-taxes but discontinue the concerts; a third hand says don't
pay anything and we'll try to find a way to keep the concerts. It's nuts down
there; no one seems to know what's going on.";   Meanwhile, the Reschs are
pinning their hopes on the upcoming city council meeting and on Hammer, who
wrote in a July 29 letter to Lofgren: "I am working . . . to find a way to
allow the recitals to continue.";   The city has never received complaints
about the concerts. It was a newspaper ad placed by the Reschs in the Metro
weekly for their June concerts that attracted the vice squad's attention. The
squad often scans ads for leads on illegal activities, Wysuph says.;   "We
thought perhaps there was a violation in the dispensation of alcohol without a
license," he says. The ad describes concert refreshments as: "complimentary
drinks, killer brownies, cheese puffs.";   The issue, says Chris O'Hanlan of
San Jose's Alcohol Beverage Control, "was brought to my attention by the San
Jose Vice Unit. I gave Mr. Resch a call (on June 21) and let him know in a
low-key style that if he offers alcoholic beverages and takes money for
tickets, that constitutes a sale. He didn't realize he was breaking the law.";
  Bill Resch says he told O'Hanlan: " 'Then we'll stop doing it."' Mr.
O'Hanlan said he'd call the vice squad and let them know. I thought that was
the end of it.";   But it wasn't the end of it. For one thing, O'Hanlan and
Wysuph disagree on whether paying guests can bring their own alcohol to the
recitals.;   O'Hanlan says, "Mr. Resch asked if it was all right if people
brought their own (alcohol). I didn't see a problem with it.";   Wysuph does.
"Charging admission to the recitals and allowing guests to bring their own
alcohol (is) still on the dark side of the law." In any case, Wysuph says,
"The alcohol was not cited for.";   "The next thing I knew," O'Hanlan says,
"there was a question if (the Reschs) were operating without a business
license. That's out of our jurisdiction.";   "We attended the concert," Wysuph
says. "She (Pamela Resch) was running a business from her residence, and she
was operating a commercial enterprise inside a residential zone. That's what
she was issued a citation for.";   Husband takes the rap; But it was Bill
Resch, not Pamela, who was cited.;   "That's another strange little twist,"
says Pamela Resch. "It's the Pamela Resch salon concerts. But the police
arrested Billy. Don't you think it was sexist of them to arrest Billy --
instead of me?;   "I'm not anxious to be arrested, but what happened to Billy
is obscene. I hope nothing like this happens to another artist ever again."  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  You may have followed the stories recently about KQED-TV's lawsuit to make the
death penalty safe for home viewing. Technically, that case is still hanging
fire -- although it looks as though the warden of San Quentin will prevail in
his efforts to close the execution to all the media. One intriguing sidelight
dealt with just who the Deukmejian administration initially selected as press
witnesses. Before the KQED suit, the San Quentin administration picked 14
reporters by name, including the now-retired Jack Schriebman of the Associated
Press; Anne Krueger of the San Diego Tribune; Dan Morain of the Los Angeles
Times, Larry Hatfield of the San Francisco Examiner; Barbara Simpson, then of
KCBS radio; and Rebecca LaVally, of Gannett News Service.; When it looked like
execution for Robert Alton Harris -- the famous Cheeseburger Killer -- the
list was then passed on to Deukmejian's press secretary, Bob Gore. Gore
specified only news organizations, not reporters. His reasoning was that the
state shouldn't make assignments. But there was at least one noticeable
oddity. For Sacramento, Gore picked the NBC television affiliate and the
Sacramento Union, not its far larger competitor, the Sacramento Bee. KQED's
attorneys seized on this as evidence of favoritism, asking Gore whether this
was because of unfavorable columns by the Bee's Dan Walters. Our television
writer David Rosenthal, who covered the trial, says that Gore denied the
charge. Gore said Walters' work had no impact on selection. But the press
secretary wasn't able to remember why he chose the right-wing Union over the
liberal Bee. FYI: The Mercury News was omitted from Gore's list. Not so the
San Francisco Chronicle and the Examiner.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  INVOKING GHOSTS; Ex-San Jose Council Member Lu Ryden may be gone from public
office. Her spirit, however, lives on. Last week, the council invited her back
to give the invocation. And naturally, it was proceeded by a little banter.
When Mayor Susan Hammer asked Ryden how she was enjoying her retirement, she
replied, "Tremendously. I've been reading the paper every day and enjoying it
even more," an obvious reference to the city's financial woes. Echoing Abe
Lincoln, Ryden then reminded the council that "God put you here to rule over
people . . . for the benefit of the people." She asked God's blessing on the
11 council members, saying, "They need your guidance (because they face) many
temptations . . . keep them from the temptation of putting their own needs
first. . . . Help them also to realize that even though they're here for a
short time, their decisions can be felt for a lifetime."; A PARTISAN PAEAN;
The good thing about blue-ribbon panels is that there are no strings attached.
Well, hardly any strings. Take the list of folks who have been appointed by
the city council to draw new districts for city elections. The chairman,
Richard Garcia, is a former member of the San Jose Unified School Board. Steve
Schell is a spokesman for Hewlett-Packard. Sherri Sager is an aide to
Supervisor Mike Honda. Brian Grayson is an aide to Norm Mineta. Professor H.
Brett Melendy is married to Marion Melendy, an aide to Nancy Ianni. And the
august John Marshall Collins, appointed by Councilman David Pandori, is the
husband of Supervisor Zoe Lofgren. Lofgren, you may remember, endorsed Pandori
in the last election. All told, a savvy group. Rest assured that someone's
interest will be protected.; TO THE HUSTINGS;    A few bits and pieces: Bob
Livengood, the director of the Building Industry Association, is stepping down
as of May 3 to go back to managing his three 7-11 stores. Livengood has not
ruled out another try for public office, possibly for Dom Cortese's Assembly
seat. Insiders at City Hall speculate that his departure may give the BIA a
reason to ask for delay in various fee increases planned by the council.
That's what happened two years ago when Livengood took over.  . . Political
consultants Roger Lee and Carol Beddo have signed on attorney and developer
Phil DiNapoli as a client. In fact, we're told they plan to move into
DiNapoli's building in Park Center Plaza. . . . Finally, the Oakland City
Council's rules committee has bestowed two seats in the city's skybox at A's
games to former Mayor Lionel Wilson. "It's a nice gesture," said current Mayor
Elihu Harris. (box)  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  SAN-JOSE; RESTAURANT; GAMBLING; CLUB; TAX; CITY; COUNCIL; BUDGET  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  For years, even as San Jose police were desperately trying to shut it down,
city officials were able to count on their friends at the local poker parlor
for big campaign bucks.;   Now, struggling with a second consecutive $20
million-plus budget deficit, council members hope the biggest card room in
Northern California will help bail them out to the tune of at least $2 million
a year.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  S.J. GAMBLES ON CARD CLUB TAX
CITY FORESEES GARDEN OF CASH  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     And some police and other law enforcement officials wonder whether the
city's new reliance on the club as a cash cow might not mean carte blanche for
Garden City should it want to expand, increase the current $200 betting limit
or add games.;   San Jose actually has three card clubs, but it is the
40-table Garden City that will bear the brunt of a proposed new tax that would
siphon up to 11.5 percent of the club's gross receipts into the city's general
fund.;   In a climate under which most businesses would balk at new taxes,
Garden City is unique. Club executives actually suggested a new tax earlier
this year.;   The club's business has been booming since it introduced "Asian
games" earlier this year. More than 100 new employees have been registered
with the police department, and the parking lot at Stevens Creek Boulevard and
Saratoga Avenue is overflowing -- so full that the club now leases space down
the block for employee parking and runs a shuttle bus to the club.;   That
apparent prosperity is the direct result of city council approval of ordinance
changes that allowed the new games.;   Though club officials suggested the new
tax some time before part-owner Nicholas J. Dalis approached the council about
the new high-stakes games, Mayor Susan Hammer said at the time that the two
issues were not related.;   Hammer announced her plans to study a gross
receipts tax on March 20, the day after the council approved the lucrative new
games.;   Dalis and other Garden City executives did not return telephone
calls, but they have not publicly complained about the proposal, which would
boost their annual fees and taxes from about $250,000 to almost 10 times
that.;   Hammer, who prefers to think of the card room tax as "a fantastic
source of revenue for the city," has also considered such taxes to help pay
for a new baseball stadium. She dismissed questions about whether she now
would feel pressured to help the club expand, and bolster city coffers even
more.;   "I don't know," she said. "I haven't really thought about that.";
Pandori against expansion;   David Pandori, one of three council members who
voted against the new games, said it makes sense to tax the club as long as
it's there, but that he will not vote for any expansion or new games.;
Deputy City Manager Darrell Dearborn, who oversees the city budget, said the
council "just needs to be aware" of the situation when it considers other
rules for the club.;   Dearborn is more concerned about another possibility.
He fears that the city will become dependent on income that could evaporate if
Garden City loses its license, a threat that has been hanging over the club
and 11 officers and employees since they were indicted in 1987.;   "It's a
source of revenue that may not be dependable," Dearborn said of the proposed
new tax. "As they go, so goes the revenue source.";   Skimming indictments;
The Garden City principals face conspiracy and tax charges stemming from an
alleged multimillion-dollar skimming operation, and 10 of the 11 are charged
with violating state campaign contribution laws. Investigators believe they
tried to expand their political pull by arranging for dozens of club employees
to make campaign contributions that the club later reimbursed. A trial date is
scheduled to be set Dec. 17.;   Since the indictment, most of the employee
contributions have stopped, but Garden City officials continue to be generous.
For example, Dalis and club associates contributed more than $6,000 to Hammer
last year. Councilwoman Blanca Alvarado got at least $3,250, and most other
council members also pulled in hefty contributions.;   Former Police Chief
Joseph McNamara, who said he would yank the club's license if Dalis and the
others were convicted, called the new tax "cynical.";   'Cynical way' to raise
money;   "I think it would be questionable for the council to rely on a source
of income from a business that has been accused of ill behavior a number of
times, with an indictment and criminal case pending. That's a pretty cynical
way for government to raise funds . . . by raising fees of someone accused of
breaking those laws the council has passed -- and state law.";   McNamara's
successor, Lou Cobarruviaz, said he, too, would rescind Garden City's license
if convictions result.;   But meanwhile, he does not oppose the tax.;   "I
realize the city is in a critical situation. . . . We have to be practical,"
Cobarruviaz said.;   Even if Dalis or any of the others is convicted, and the
license is revoked, there is still a chance that others could buy out the
shareholders and hold on to the license by "cleaning house.";   The city's
card room ordinance gives the police chief authority over license transfers,
but Cobarruviaz said he believes that Hammer and the council should decide
that policy issue.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  SAN-JOSE; CITY; COUNCIL; SUPPORT; SPORTS; FACILITY; BASEBALL  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Cajoled by Mayor Susan Hammer and a stream of developers, labor leaders and
civic bigwigs, the San Jose City Council voted Tuesday to put $640,000 toward
a ballot date next spring with the San Francisco Giants.;   Zeroing in on a
site near Highway 237 and Zanker Road, the council agreed to begin various
stadium studies and sign a contract with attorney Stan Berliner to negotiate
land deals and ballpark financing with the baseball club.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  S.J. OKS $640,000 FOR BALLPARK CAMPAIGN  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The vote on half of the funding was a unanimous 11-0. But Councilman David
Pandori voted against the $320,000 pact with Berliner, saying it was too
expensive.;   Because the $640,000 was taken from the Redevelopment Agency's
long-range budget, agency officials calculated that the financial impact four
years down the road actually would be $860,000. This would account for
interest lost by spending the money earlier than planned. But Hammer said the
higher figure was "totally misleading.";   The council rhetoric was
predictable. Most argued, as Hammer did last week, that money needs to be
spent before the city can reliably estimate the ballpark's cost, which so far
is a huge unknown. Sample: "This is a basic plan to get some facts before the
voters," said Councilman Jim Beall.;   But what the public said was more
lively. Some words were heated, some highfalutin, and some just plain hot
air.;   Paul Freiman, chairman of Syntex Corp., said San Jose would evoke the
glories of Socratic Athens in ancient Greece. "San Jose is rapidly approaching
a new height as a city," Freiman said.;   Testimonials piled on from
organizations such as the Associated General Contractors of Santa Clara
Valley, the San Jose Police Officers' Association, the Building Industry
Association and the Central Labor Council of Santa Clara and San Benito
counties.;   Marian Holt, president of the San Jose Convention &amp; Visitors
Bureau, had the best hyperbole of the day. "We might even think about renaming
our bay, to San Jose Bay," she said.;   Grumpy taxpayers, too, had their say.
"I object to organizations such as the Giants who expect public money to pay
for million-dollar baseball players," said Virgil McVicker.;   Said the
like-minded Ross Signorino, "Mr. Lurie and the Giants will be making millions
at the poor people's expense.";   Perhaps the most understated commentary was
offered by Jordan Spaulding, who lives in Mobilepark West, on Nicholson Lane
near the stadium site. "Why was the Zanker Road site preferred over others?"
he asked. "What kind of information will we have regarding noise, and stadium
lights, and traffic?";   Hammer replied that Spaulding and other critics would
get a full airing of their concerns about the stadium's site and cost when the
council next takes up the issue, in December or January. Until then, the
ballpark drive is back in the hands of consultants and a small army of mostly
anonymous city officials.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  SAN-JOSE; MAYOR; DEVELOPMENT; POLICY  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  UST before squeaking by Frank Fiscalini to become mayor of San Jose last year,
Susan Hammer sounded as if she would personify the unbroken chain of rational
urban planning that stretched from Norm Mineta to Janet Gray Hayes to Tom
McEnery.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Perspective  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  HAMMER POUNDING ON DOOR OF GROWTH  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Philip J. Trounstine, the Mercury News political editor, writes on local,
state and national politics.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "You can't be talking about neighborhood services on the one hand and
expanding the urban service area on the other," she said in an interview at
the Mercury News. "It doesn't work. It dilutes from those services.";
Defending her role in the November 1988 6-5 vote to convert 54 acres of prime
industrial land to build housing, Hammer said:;   "That was a unique piece of
property. That was included in the Edenvale industrial reserve by a council
that I wasn't a part of. It's not contiguous to any of the other industrial
reserve. It's surrounded on a couple of sides by housing.";   Although she had
in fact been a member of the council that brought the land into the city
limits in May 1983 specifically for industry, Hammer's statement -- and her
defense of Coyote Valley this summer -- seemed to suggest that the decision to
convert Edenvale land for homes was "a one-instance thing.";   Now we know it
wasn't.;   Hammer's slow-growth rhetoric, with which she tagged Fiscalini and
Councilwoman Shirley Lewis as more pro-growth than she, looks now less
indicative of her true outlook than her earlier "housing, housing, housing"
mantra.;   Despite her contention that it is being "blown out of proportion,"
the recent 8-3 vote converting an additional 92 acres of Edenvale industrial
land for up to 990 homes represents the most significant breach of planning
philosophy and practice in San Jose in the past 20 years.;   Not since the
first urban development policy was adopted by San Jose in 1970 has any mayor
presided over a land-use change that was so thoroughly opposed by planners,
economic development officials and redevelopment experts -- not to mention
environmentalists, school districts and controlled-growth advocates.;   San
Jose, with its continuing shortage of jobs compared to housing, remains a
bedroom for job-rich cities like Palo Alto, Sunnyvale and Santa Clara.
Building new homes -- which cannot pay for the police, fire, library,
recreation and other services they demand -- is an inexorable drain on
existing residential neighborhoods.;   "The conversion of 100 acres of land
from industrial to residential land uses would have profound implications for
the future viability of the city's economic development strategy," the
planners warned.;   "The proposed amendment threatens the equilibrium that San
Jose has attempted to achieve by balancing demands associated with economic
development, housing and transportation.";   Against this line of reasoning,
developers Drew Gibson and Steve Speno (Gibson Speno), Reid Gustafson (Shea
Homes) and Roger Menard (Kaufman &amp; Broad) pointed to the regional lack of
housing as compared to jobs.;   Moreover, they argued new industry won't
locate in San Jose's Edenvale industrial area unless much more housing is
built nearby.;   Finally, they held, the Edenvale land isn't all that great
for industry anyway.;   Hammer, who let soon-to-retire Councilwoman Pat
Sausedo front for the project, was terse.;   "This community needs to do
something to give our economy a kick in the rear, if you will," she said. "I
believe it will make a very, very ideal housing site.";   Hammer's aide Margie
Fernandes expanded on the issue last week for her boss, who was out of town.;
 "She'd like to see some economic development activity -- be it in the
construction trades -- and she believes that the housing will attract
industry," Fernandes said.;   "Susan's an action-oriented mayor. A lot of us
can be planners. But she is the mayor and she is not afraid to make tough
political decisions based on reality, not on a plan that was made 10 years
ago.;   "History is fine," Fernandes said. "But we can't all get hung up on
symbols here. Susan is a real mayor of a real city.";   She is not, however,
the first "real mayor of a real city.";   Norm Mineta was the first mayor to
challenge the developers. In 1972 he forced out the late pro-growth City
Manager A.P. "Dutch" Hamann and hired controlled-growth manager Ted Tedesco.;
 In 1974, Janet Gray Hayes fought against the old guard developers and the
Mercury News to become mayor. Her slogan: "Let's make San Jose better before
we make it bigger.";   Throughout her tenure, Hayes held off attempts to crack
open Coyote Valley and -- with only a few exceptions -- to expand the city
limits.;   McEnery won the mayor's race against Councilman Claude Fletcher in
1982. His winning slogan: "It's time for San Jose to stop growing out and
start growing up." And that's what the city did during his tenure -- building
up its downtown while holding at the fringe.;   Now comes Hammer.;   In June
1989 she was already arguing that "if you don't link the housing and the
transportation with the jobs, your transportation capacity and housing are
gone before you ever get the jobs.";   "Are you talking about converting
industrial land to housing?" I asked her then.;   "No," she said. "Some of
that may have to be done. I don't know. What I want to happen is a situation
where the city is in control of this. I don't want to see a situation like
what happened last general plan (November 1988) where we began to piecemeal
these decisions and the council doesn't have any control over it.";   Although
Councilman David Pandori -- and possibly others -- are having second thoughts
about their historic piecemeal decision in Edenvale, Fernandes said the mayor
is unwavering.;   "It was the right decision," Fernandes said last week. Well
then, would Fernandes, who plans to run for city council in Berryessa, have
voted the same way?;   "I don't know," she said. "I think it's an unfair
question. . . . It was a political decision made by a political
office-holder.";   Indeed. (box)  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  THE Oak Grove School District learned the hard way that you can't count on San
Jose for good city planning when powerful developers take their case to the
city council.;   Not any more.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  HOUSING IN NOWHERE
SAN JOSE DEVELOPMENT WOULD OVERWHELM A STRUGGLING
SCHOOL DISTRICT  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The district had filed written objections to a Gibson Speno/Shea Homes
housing plan for Edenvale's industrial area. But Superintendent Anthony Russo
says he didn't show up at last week's council meeting because it never
occurred to him that the council might approve the plan -- a pocket of housing
in the middle of nowhere, pure sprawl, which goes against everything the
city's general plan has stood for.;   But Russo was in a time warp. Under
former mayor Tom McEnery, the plan would have been laughed out of City Hall.
Under Mayor Susan Hammer, developers now know that if they come up with
excuses to put housing anywhere it suits their needs, the council is ready to
listen. This plan sailed through on an 8-3 vote.;   Fortunately, some council
members are willing to listen to Russo as well. The hearing on the proposal
will be reopened Dec. 10, and the council has one last chance to stop this bad
development.;   The mayor wasn't one of those willing to listen, however.
Hammer -- who normally prides herself on bending rules for a good cause --
grasped a technicality and tried to keep Oak Grove from making its appeal. It
was Councilman David Pandori who opened the door for the district, joined by
by Joe Head and Nancy Ianni, as well as the three council members who
originally opposed the housing plan: Judy Stabile, Trixie Johnson and Shirley
Lewis.;   When Hammer was running for mayor, she published an unfair campaign
pamphlet that claimed Shirley Lewis was more pro-growth than she was. The hit
piece was based on Lewis' approval of some large developments, but this
Edenvale plan points up the real difference between Lewis and Hammer. Lewis
supports thoughtful growth based on solid planning principles. Hammer's
principles turned to putty this fall when developers came calling.;   Oak
Grove sees the problem with this housing plan that Hammer misses. It's the
isolation of the neighborhood, cut off by the freeway, which makes it
impossible to absorb the kids in existing schools and will force Oak Grove to
build a new one, at a cost of $10 million. That isolation also will make the
neighborhood difficult and expensive to provide with city services, such as
police and fire protection. It will be a drain on existing neighborhoods.;
But it will be more profitable for developers than leaving the land for
industry.;   Judy Stabile has a good suggestion. She says this tract should be
re-evaluated as part of the city-wide general plan review. Before the city
considers changing it from industrial land to housing, a task force should
examine the impacts on the schools and on city services.;   That's a sensible
approach to this proposal. That's what the council should vote for on Dec. 10.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  SAN-JOSE; SANTA-CLARA; COUNTY; POLITICS  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  In the hubbub of Christmas, you may have missed the strange but intriguing
case of the electoral mother-in-law. Since it's coming to court Tuesday, we'll
replay it: Byron Pipkin and Greg Yoder, two candidates who finished out of the
running for the two four-year seats on the San Jose Unified School District
board, have brought the suit. They're alleging that one of the winners, Louis
K. "Bud" Towner, should be disqualified. Their reason? They say Towner did not
live in the district -- and that his real home was at 1054 Mitchell Court in
Campbell.;    Towner disputes this charge, calling it "sour grapes." He told
our reporter Bill Romano that he moved to his mother-in-law's home at 1070
Glenbrook Avenue in Willow Glen last August. While he acknowledges owning the
Mitchell Court property, he says his residence is in San Jose. And he has
changed his voter registration to reflect that. But not every authority got
the message. The DMV still lists Towner on Mitchell Court. County records show
he still enjoys a homeowner's exemption there. The San Jose post office, which
delivers to Mitchell Court, shows no change of address for Towner. And Pipkin
and Yoder say that neighbors have told them that Towner continues to live on
Mitchell.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Whether this is enough to invalidate Towner's election will depend on the
legal interpretation of residency. But Pipkin, a Sunnyvale public safety
lieutenant who finished third after Towner and Rich Couser, says the principle
is particularly important with the onset of district elections. "If we can't
keep out someone who's not even in the district, how are they going to keep
five people in their proper districts?" he asked.; TOLD BRIEFLY;    A few bits
and pieces: Deborah Larson, the City of San Jose's finance director, quit last
week, saying she had accomplished what she intended and needed time to write
and paint. You may remember that her wedding to chief budget analyst Greg
Larson was one of City Hall's major social events last year . . . Catherine
Pandori, the wife of new council member David Pandori, showed up at the year's
first council meeting last Tuesday with the couple's 11-day-old son . . .
Expect to see a major zoo outside the new Hall of Justice on Hedding Street
when it opens tomorrow. The powers-that-be have built the courthouse before
finishing the parking garage across the street. . . . You may wonder why the
Susan Hammer inauguration went off so smoothly last Monday. It's because the
ceremony was rehearsed word for word. Little circles were even drawn for the
participants to stand in. A production of Roger Lee and Carol Beddo, who were
everywhere with their walkie-talkies  . . Wittingly or unwittingly, the new
mayor snubbed her predecessor, Tom McEnery. Hammer introduced a host of
elected officials, including San Francisco Art Agnos. She neglected to mention
McEnery. It couldn't have been a payback for his lack of endorsement. Could
it?; BREACH OF ETIQUETTE;    Has the move for term limits reached a bit of a
barrier? After San Jose and the state of California imposed term limits last
November, Councilman Norm Shaskey of Mountain View, a self-styled populist,
figured he could start a movement to do the same for the Board of Supervisors.
He figured wrong. At a council meeting Tuesday, Shaskey put forward a
resolution asking the supes to put a two-consecutive-term-limit measure before
voters. It is an idea that may not sit well with, say, Supervisor Rod Diridon,
the senior member of the board, in his fifth term. Shaskey also wanted to ask
other cities to sign up. But the motion died for lack of a second. Said
Mountain View Councilwoman Pat Figueroa: "There was no interest in it. I have
no idea why he chose to put it on. It hit us as a great big surprise."; BUY AT
THE RACK;    If you've been following the recent musical chairs game with the
valley's bureaucrats, you could make a persuasive case that the move of city
manager Thomas Frutchey from Los Altos Hills to Campbell was simply a career
step upward. When he took the $90,000 job early this month, Frutchey, 41,
praised Campbell as a place that has "has real community feeling and spirit,
based on traditional values." It's no secret in Los Altos Hills, however, that
Frutchey regularly clashed with the Mizz Nordstrom of the town council, Toni
Casey. You may remember her as the one who suggested a while back that the
town government should emulate Nordstrom's standard of service. "There's been
a feeling that Tom can't get anything done," said one of our sources. "He's
frustrated personally." Frutchey, incidentally, is the second high-ranking
town official to depart recently: City Planner Ann Jamison is also gone.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  SAN-JOSE; CITY; COUNCIL; HOUSING; DEVELOPMENT; CONTROVERSY; ANALYSIS  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  The San Jose City Council's vote in Wednesday's early hours for new housing in
Edenvale marked a watershed for the city's growth policy, with portents for
developers, would-be politicians, the San Jose economy, underfunded schools
and Silicon Valley home buyers.;   The five hours of debate leading up to the
council's 7-4 vote for hundreds of new homes in Edenvale showed that changing
92 acres from industry to housing use was more than a simple matter of
recoloring San Jose's planning maps, despite Mayor Susan Hammer's initial
gambit to downplay the issue.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  EDENVALE VOTE REFLECTS EASIER GROWTH POLICY  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Analysis  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     For Hammer, who conceded that the hearing had raised her consciousness
about the straits of schools, the vote was above all a worthwhile gamble to
catalyze San Jose's economy.;   She knew the housing would burden the Oak
Grove School District and East Side Union High School District. She knew that
beat cops and fire trucks and parks crews would be challenged to cover new
ground in the city's southeast corner. But she couldn't pass up a chance to
make San Jose more marketable.;   "It is better to face the problems of
economic growth rather than economic stagnation," the mayor told perhaps 200
people, from an original crowd of nearly 700, who stayed after midnight to
witness the red and green flashes on the vote board. "That is the very, very
heart of the reason I supported this general plan amendment.";   For
developers, who struggled with then-Mayor Tom McEnery through most of the
1980s, the vote signaled that the council is ready to make a deal even if the
city's professional staff is unanimously opposed.;   The Gibson Speno Co. and
Shea Homes can now cash in an option secured during the height of the McEnery
era from landowners headed by businessman Richard Levin. Though the general
plan allows up to 990 homes on the property, east of Highway 101 and Coyote
Creek, the developers, allied with Kaufman &amp; Broad South Bay Inc., plan to
build 600.;   With prices from $150,000 (for attached townhomes and condos) to
about $300,000 (for detached homes), the developers will make plenty of money
even if fees and assessments are heavier than usual.;   For home buyers, the
vote showed a council anxious to build new homes in new neighborhoods, at
prices aimed toward Silicon Valley professionals. Council members Joe Head,
Pat Sausedo and George Shirakawa drilled this point over and over, but the
affordability of the homes for first-time buyers remains debatable.;   "I'm
unwilling to believe that the fiscal situation in the (school) district and
the city is such that our only reasonable choice is to do nothing and give
up," said Head, who is up for re-election next spring. "This is a good plan
for housing, for families, on the most affordable scale that private industry
can provide.";   For declared and potential council candidates, the vote meant
a new political issue for 1992, when five seats are at stake. Judi Brauns and
Robert Perro, of the southern District 2, and J. Manuel Herrera, of Berryessa
District 4, spoke against the project. Terry Hayden, in Evergreen District 8,
spoke for it.;   "People who live there are opposed to it, so my position is
no," said Perro.;   For the schools -- backed by council members Judy Stabile,
David Pandori, Shirley Lewis and Trixie Johnson -- the vote meant more budgets
written with cuts and prayers. Officials from the Oak Grove elementary and
East Side high school districts pleaded for a no vote or guarantees that the
new neighborhood's impacts would be wiped clean by developers.;   Oak Grove
and Shea Homes were making progress in talks before the vote, but not enough
to change the district's stance. Shea put forward a package said by a
developer and a Hammer aide to be worth $4 million, aiming for but not
guaranteeing a new elementary school east of the freeway. District officials
valued the package somewhat lower, and kept their bargaining line of $10
million for a new school.;   Superintendent Anthony Russo put the dilemma in
words the council could understand: "It would be analogous to the city taking
its operating dollars for parks, and buying another park, and then trying to
maintain them all. They would all deteriorate.";   Hammer's response was warm
words ("We all, we all, share that concern") and a proposed new task force to
study school fees early next year. But to Oak Grove parents, the mayor's
sympathy seemed insincere.;   Said Debbie Peevyhouse: "I don't know what her
motivation was, but it wasn't for the people. That wasn't in her heart."  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Faced with a 45 percent cut in its water use, the city of San Jose has taken a

city's image.;    All city-owned fountains will be turned off.  </LEADPARA>

WATER SAVINGS SEEN AS SYMBOLIC  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Mercury News Staff Writer Cathie Calvert contributed to this report.
Drought Year 5  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The city council voted to turn off the fountains -- even though they use
reclaimed water -- because they give the "perception" of wasting water.;    "I
can appreciate that argument, but the reason I voted against it is that we're
feeding the misconception" that the city has been wasting water in the
fountains, said Councilman David Pandori.;    "That's what is ironic. We're
going to shut off the fountains, and we're going to have to use the same
amount of water to shut them off.";    Even though the fountains won't be
working, they will remain full of water, because if the fountains are left
dry, the plaster in them deteriorates. Among the fountains to be shut off are
the ones at the Center for Performing Arts, Plaza Park, the old convention
center, the new convention center, the Children's Discovery Museum and St.
James Park. The fountains along the transit mall will also stop spouting.;
"The difficulty we face is that if the fountains are on, people get the
impression that we're not serious about saving water," said Councilman Joe
Head, who, along with Pandori and Councilwoman Shirley Lewis, voted against
turning them off.;    "The symbology says we're serious, even though the
actual turning off of the fountains doesn't save anything.";    Head said
water used in the fountains is all reclaimed water that gets dumped into the
bay if it is not used. The reclaimed water is not suitable for drinking, but
is perfectly suited for watering trees or operating fountains.;    The
reclaimed water comes from two places -- the city's sewage treatment plant and
an underground spring on the San Jose International Airport property.;
According to Michelle Yesney, director of the Office of Environmental
Management, the city has been using reclaimed water from the "dewatering
operation" at the airport to fill the downtown fountains for the past two
years.;    The new parking garage and baggage terminal are on top of the
underground spring, and the city has to pump about 100,000 gallons each day
into a pond so the buildings won't flood. Head said that at some point, the
city will use that water to nourish the airport landscaping.;    Councilwoman
Judy Stabile voted for turning off the fountains because, she said, allowing
the fountains to run sends the wrong message to San Jose residents.;    "It's
an irritant to people to see the fountains running in the middle of a
drought," Stabile said. "We know it's reclaimed water, but the general public
doesn't know that. The message should be that we're all in this together and
that saving water, even if it's in small amounts, is important.";    Council
members say the fountain shutoff is the first step in a series of water
cutbacks they will have to make to meet the impending Santa Clara Valley Water
District rationing levels. In addition to shutting down the fountains, the
council also decided in a separate vote to ban plantings on public lands,
including parks, until 1992 and to suspend the surface watering of mature
trees.;    Also under consideration are a variety of measures from postponing
new parks to forbidding developers from landscaping planned housing tracts.  </TEXT>

Shirakawa, three politicians who help set the city's drought policy, have
failed recently to meet water-saving standards, a survey of council members'
water bills shows.;    Hammer's account with the San Jose Water Co. shows her
conservation lagging by enough water to supply an average household for a year
-- an aberration, she says, caused by a leaky toilet and a ruptured pipe
during the winter freeze. The mayor denies that she is a water waster and
offers as proof a clean water record for 1989 and most of 1990.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Both Ianni and Shirakawa slightly exceeded their annual allotments, which
were 80 percent of what they used in 1987. Rationing tightens to a 75 percent
allotment starting in May.;    Ianni, like Hammer, blamed the bill on the
freeze, while Shirakawa said his 29-year-old son and 25-year-old daughter take
long, repeated showers.;    "You know young people, you have to battle them
for conservationism," Shirakawa said. His kids recently moved back into the
house.;    Ianni could not be reached for comment. But she said in a note that
she had fixed a leaking irrigation valve "as quickly as I could and since then
(I) have been back on track.";    Hammer and her husband, Phil, live in a
five-bedroom, four-bathroom house on West Hedding Street. The mayor says they
shower quickly, flush sparingly and go easy on the landscaping. "We just don't
use a lot of water," she said.;    But in November, she discovered a problem
with an out-of-the-way toilet and had it fixed. Then, one day in December, she
came home to find a pipe burst outside, shooting water 20 feet in the air. "It
was like a geyser, like Yellowstone," she said.;    It took several hours
before the water company cut the spout, she said.;    As a result, Hammer
said, her water bank went from a surplus of 76 ccfs in September 1990 to a
deficit of 155 by February. Before the leaks, Hammer had kept surpluses for
more than a year, her records show.;    A ccf -- 100 cubic feet -- is 748
gallons of water. In a normal year, the average household in San Jose would
use 17 ccfs per month, water company officials say. During the drought, the
average has dropped to 13 ccfs.;    Hammer's deficit grew to 214 ccfs by
April, according to records provided by the mayor's office. Maribel Alvarez, a
spokeswoman for the mayor, said that Hammer may have more plumbing problems
but that they have either been fixed or will be soon.;    "We have exhausted
the subject," Alvarez said, when asked for further explanation.;    Hammer
said she soon will apply for an adjustment to her account to reflect the
plumbing problems. The water company's hardship policy is to scan fix-it
receipts and review individual cases. It sometimes makes adjustments.;
Sharon Whaley, a water company spokeswoman, said 80 to 85 percent of the
company's 203,000 customers have positive bank balances, meaning they are
meeting the rationing goal.;    Whaley said the company would not comment on
individual customer's bills. The private company, which serves most of San
Jose, routinely denies public access to its records. The Mercury News obtained
the water bills by asking council members for copies.;     Who's saving;

<LEADPARA>  From the steely glass edifices of downtown, to the leafy streets of Willow
Glen, to the raw new tracts of Evergreen and Berryessa, city council politics
is crackling through San Jose with more electricity than at anytime in the
past decade.;   A new two-term limit will bump four councilwomen from the
10-member council after 1992, meaning that local politics could be just as
lively next year as, say, the twin U.S. Senate races crisscrossing California.  </LEADPARA>

HOT RACES SEEN FOR 4 OPENINGS  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     "It's a free-for-all. It's crazy," said Carl Lindstrom, one of as many as
half a dozen candidates eyeing the North San Jose seat Shirley Lewis won in
1980.;   The same could be said of Judy Stabile's South San Jose district,
Nancy Ianni's Willow Glen district, and Pat Sausedo's sprawling southeast
district. These Democrats have formed the core of a liberal, environmentalist
council for most of the 1980s. The term limit passed last year knocked the
struts from under that core.;   Republicans could capitalize on the openings.
The GOP now has no voice on the ostensibly non-partisan council -- a total
shutout. Dan Minutillo, a former mayoral and council candidate, hopes to
change that.;   "We will have Republicans in every single council race," said
Minutillo, who heads a group that calls itself the "Republican Candidate
Development Committee." "It's a great opportunity. We can't go much lower than
we actually are.";   Traditionally, parks, crime and traffic are the meat and
potatoes of council elections. But citywide issues could supplant parochial
concerns next year, especially if a baseball stadium measure is on the spring
ballot.;   Lewis' District 4 -- encompassing Berryessa and, for now, Alviso --
illustrates forces pulsing throughout the city: mayoral influence, council
heir-making, redistricting wrangling and emerging ethnic power.;   The
District 4 race will test Mayor Susan Hammer's strength after her first year
in office. Hammer's longtime aide, Margie Fernandes, now the mayor's land-use
policy director, has all but declared her candidacy. Fernandes is now making
the back-room rounds for endorsements. She plans to leave her city job Jan. 1
to run full time.;   '1,000 percent' backing; Hammer has said Fernandes will
have her support "1,000 percent," meaning that the 45-year-old aide should
have plenty of money.;   Lewis is expected to back Chuck Reed, 43, the
attorney who directed her failed 1990 mayoral campaign-- if he decides to run.
Reed admits he is still iffy, but Lewis would make a potent patron.;   Carm
Grande, 55, the fireplug former leader of the San Jose Police Officers'
Association, said he's running. Grande, a former Republican who just switched
his registration to "decline to state," will probably get lots of ink simply
for his populist quotability.;   He's already ripping Hammer and Fernandes,
painting them as insiders, out of touch with "average folks" like him. "Is
Margie Fernandes going to come out and criticize redevelopment?" Grande asked,
tauntingly. "She can't. She's part of it. Margie Fernandes is not going to
shoot her benefactor in the foot.";   'Berryessa insider'; Fernandes wouldn't
take the bait. Her reply: "I'm a Berryessa insider. I've been volunteering in
Berryessa much longer than I've been working for the city of San Jose.";   Ben
Menor, 41, a former aide to Supervisor Ron Gonzales and a Philippines native,
is running from another platform altogether: Berryessa's growing Asian
population. During the 1980s, the district's Asian population rose by 20,300,
an increase of more than 200 percent. Menor moved into Berryessa a year ago,
but he said he has been planning to run for the past 20 years and lists a
string of grass-roots Filipino activities to back it up.;   Menor may have to
fight Lindstrom for that base. Lindstrom, 37, is also Filipino. A Democratic
Party activist, Lindstrom acknowledges that he needs solid Asian support. But
in the next breath, he says: "I'm not running as a 'minority candidate.' The
challenge of an ethnic candidate is to transcend his community and run in the
mainstream.";   J. Manuel Herrera, elected last year to the board of the East
Side Union High School District, is also thinking about running.;   Awaiting
remapping; Like candidates elsewhere, the District 4 bunch is waiting to see
what happens this fall with the city's political maps. It's hard to start a
candidacy when you don't know who your voters will be.;   The once-a-decade
task of remapping is winding slowly through City Hall. Radical surgery to
district lines is unlikely. But District 4, for instance, could lose Alviso, a
Hispanic bastion in the city's northern extremity. A politically sleepy
neighborhood, Alviso is beset by toxics and code-enforcement problems. The
right candidate, touching the right nerves, could make Alviso's plight a
campaign issue.; Rumored candidates; These people say they may run or are
rumored as candidates for the June 1992 council primary.; District 2;

<LEADPARA>  IT'S NOT that certain San Jose cops have any distaste for classical music or
consider Beethoven, Chopin and Liszt any threat to the community.;    In fact,
vice squad Sgt. David Wysuph and Officer Jim Roach said they enjoyed the piano
recital they attended undercover a couple of Sundays ago at the home of Bill
and Pamela Resch.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  RECITAL'S BUST ORCHESTRATED  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     It's not that the Resches' Naglee Park neighbors were complaining, either.;
   Nevertheless, as two dozen guests were filing out following the recital, as
Bill Resch was standing in his tuxedo and tails, a San Jose police officer
busted him.;    "I was fingerprinted and cited in full view of my neighbors
and house guests," he complained in a letter to Mayor Susan Hammer and City
Councilman David Pandori. "There was absolutely no warning given. I was told
by the policeman that I was the subject of an ongoing investigation.";
Which leads you to wonder, with cops complaining about being chronically
shorthanded, with neighborhood streets going unpatrolled and violent crimes
going unprevented, how did this Beethoven bust ever come about?;    The first
clue came from an ad in Metro, the San Jose weekly newspaper, inviting
classical music enthusiasts to a Sunday recital. Guests would be greeted at
the door of a restored 19th-century home and treated to a glass of wine as
part of the $25 admission.;     COME TO find out, the cops routinely comb the
weekly newspaper for ads for potential illicit businesses. A shorthanded
police force uses every trick it can.;    Anyway, vice Sgt. Wysuph contacted
the state Alcoholic Beverage Control office, which contacted Resch on June 21
and asked if he was serving wine at the recitals.;    "I told them that we did
not serve wine, but had an open bottle of wine on the buffet and that people
could help themselves if they wanted," Resch said.;    This, Resch was told,
was illegal. He needed a liquor license to serve booze to guests who have been
paying to hear the couple play in their home for the past seven years.;    But
at the recital Sunday, June 23, the Resches informed the guests there would be
no more wine. The next day, they called the ABC to say they were complying. If
their guests wanted wine, they could bring their own.;    Meanwhile, the vice
squad continued its investigation and came up with a stack of offenses.;
The Resches lacked a business license. Their house was not zoned for
commercial (concert) use. They owed back business taxes, even though their
business was not supposed to be a legal business. They owed penalty payments
in addition to their back business taxes.;     ON SUNDAY, July 7, the two vice
officers purchased tickets and joined the other guests who paid to hear Pamela
Resch perform works by Beethoven, Chopin and Liszt.;    After the applause
died, the officers slipped outside, contacted a patrol car and the bust came
down.;    "This shows how efficient the city can be," Councilman Pandori said
sarcastically. "It's surprising that with all the problems that cry out for
attention, the police department spent so much time on this. This is clearly a
case of misplaced priorities.";    Pandori complained to acting Police Chief
Fred Abram. Two days later, Abram ordered the police citation dropped.;
"Clearly, we were out of our sphere of influence," he said.;    So, I asked,
it had nothing to do with the music?;    "No. The officers reported they
thought the music was great," Abram said.;    Maybe the officers' report, or
rather their musical review, will be circulated through City Hall on behalf of
the Resches, who are negotiating to get a business license, clear up their tax
problems and resume their recitals.;    It would lend a touch of class to the
whole farce if the cops who busted the pianists gave them a standing ovation.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  San Jose's burgeoning ethnic population is bound to result in greater
political clout for Hispanics and Asians, politicians say, but it is unlikely
that the ethnic makeup of a largely Anglo city council will change right
away.;    "At first blush, it looks like an opportunity for more minority
representation on the city council," said Mayor Susan Hammer, whose city no
longer has an ethnic majority.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Other politicians and those who will be involved in redrawing boundaries
for city council districts said that ethnic power is already in evidence but
that power may not be entirely dependent on electing more members of minority
groups to the council.;    "We're starting to see an increase in influence
throughout the city and county -- and that doesn't necessarily translate into
electing minority candidates in every case, just as long as a candidate has
our best interests at heart," said Pete Carrillo, president of the Latino
Issues Forum of Santa Clara County.;    In fact, Hammer, an Anglo, has made
ethnic diversity and involvement a theme, with forums and rallies and other
ways of encouraging ethnic diversity in city government.;    Nevertheless,
Carrillo's group and the Asian/Pacific Islander-Americans for Fair
Representation have joined to push for redistricting that will give minorities
a better crack at representation on boards, councils, commissions and in state
and federal offices.;    In San Jose, members of so-called minority groups,
taken together, have grown from a 37 percent share of the population in 1980
to a slight majority -- 50.4 percent. Asians -- the fastest-growing ethnic
group, with a 191.4 percent increase -- are concentrated in areas on the north
end of the city and in the central core. The Hispanic population, which grew
41.1 percent, now accounts for more than half the people on the city's east
side and in parts of the central city.;    The 10-member city council has two
non-Anglo members. District 5's Blanca Alvarado is Hispanic. District 7's
George Shirakawa is Hispanic and Japanese-American.;    Both districts,
especially Alvarado's, have significant Hispanic populations.;    In fact,
when the city began electing council members by districts in 1980, an effort
was made to establish District 5 boundaries so that it was likely a Hispanic
would be elected.;    The district boundaries will be redrawn later this year
based on the new census information. The city charter calls for 10 council
districts that split the population evenly among them. That means council
boundaries will have to be shifted to reflect the new-growth areas in the
north and the south, such as Berryessa, Evergreen and Almaden Valley.;
"When you combine the minority population figures and the concentrations of
that population -- that's pretty compelling. . . . In the long term that means
it's likely minorities will tip the scales in elections from school boards to
city councils to higher offices," Carrillo said.;    That appears already to
have happened in the Alum Rock School District, where all five school board
members are Hispanic.;    The Census Bureau uses the term "Hispanic" to
describe people of Latin American or Spanish ancestry. As used by federal
officials, it can include blacks or whites, as well as people of Asian and
American Indian descent.;    The Mercury News has substituted the term "Anglo"
for what the Census Bureau calls "non-Hispanic whites.";    Bob Brownstein, a
longtime participant in local politics, said minority groups can still wield
considerable clout even if they aren't grouped in a single district.;    "A
strong voting minority is better off having 30 percent of its population in
two districts than 60 percent of it in one because the power is spread out,"
Brownstein said.;    An example of that theory is mobile home owners' groups,
which are scattered across the city, but whose members are politically vocal
and active.;    "They're tremendously influential because they affect several
different districts," Brownstein said.;    But if there's a low voter turnout,
he said, "you want them in one district because it takes virtually all of them
to make a difference.";    Traditionally, turnout in District 5 has been half
of that in predominantly Anglo District 10, even though the districts have
roughly the same population.;    So the real challenge is encouraging
participation from the ethnic groups.;    In a multi-ethnic society,
Brownstein said, you have to find a way to involve the biggest group. "There's
hardly a situation where an ethnic majority isn't in power that you don't have
mega-trouble," Brownstein said. "This state's going to be an incredible
political laboratory in the next decade."  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  SAN-JOSE; GAMBLING; CLUB; CITY; TAX  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  City officials still want a cut of the action at the Garden City Card Club,
but will reduce their proposed tax take slightly because the card room's
owners complained that San Jose is harder on poker parlors than most other
cities.;   The revised tax lops about 1 percent off the gross receipts tax
that council members will consider Tuesday. Under the new plan, the sliding
tax scale now tops out at 10.5 percent of the club's take.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  SAN JOSE OFFERS NEW DEAL IN CARD CLUB TAX PROPOSAL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Aimed at reducing deficit; Designed to help defray a projected $20
million-plus budget deficit, the tax originally was to have been considered by
the council two weeks ago. But the measure was delayed after card room partner
Nicholas J. Dalis and club attorney Frank Nicoletti -- who proposed the tax
earlier this year -- complained that the city wanted too much, council members
said.;   Mayor Susan Hammer's budget staff hopes the tax will raise at least
$2 million annually, although no one is certain of the amount because the club
has never before been required to report its gross receipts to the city.;
Since Hammer's official proposal two weeks ago, the card club has argued that
other highly taxed clubs, most of them in Southern California, are allowed to
offer virtually any game that is legal under state law, which specifically
forbids only 12 games.;   Meant to discourage games; San Jose's card room
ordinance, originally written to discourage the clubs and eventually eliminate
them from the city, allows the club to choose which three of six approved
games it will offer. The choices were written into the ordinance during the
last two years after intense lobbying by Dalis and his family.;   Despite the
reduction in the tax proposal, card room officials still are complaining about
the rules that limit the games they can offer, several city council members
said.;   "It (expansion of the number of games at Garden City) is not on the
agenda, but it really is," acknowledged Councilman Jim Beall, who said he has
not decided how he will vote on the tax.;   At least seven other council
members said they favor the tax, which ensures its passage Tuesday.;
Councilman George Shirakawa said he expects the addition of more games to be
raised in January when the council takes another look at its budget.
Councilwoman Shirley Lewis already has suggested the 40-table club be allowed
to offer anything that is legal under state law. Councilwoman Judy Stabile
said she agrees.;   But Hammer's budget chief, Bob Brownstein, said Friday
that expansion "is not in the cards, from the mayor's perspective.";   That
most likely means the issue will be raised by someone else, though it may not
prove as popular as the tax. Two council members who said they will vote for
the tax, David Pandori and Nancy Ianni, said they will not support any new
games at the club.;   The issue is particularly dicey because Dalis and 10
other club principals face conspiracy and tax charges stemming from an alleged
multimillion-dollar skimming operation. Ten of the 11 also are charged with
violating state campaign contribution laws for allegedly arranging
contributions to politicians to expand the cardroom's political pull. Most
city council members received contributions.;   A trial date has not been set.
But convictions or a plea bargain in the case could result in the loss of the
club's license, which could place the city's newest revenue source in
jeopardy.;   In that case, council members said, the city should collect what
it can while it can.;   "As long as it's there, we should tax it," Ianni said.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  After cloistering themselves behind closed doors Friday, members of Mayor
Susan Hammer's stadium commission emerged with a list of "findings" that
surprised no one and left unanswered key questions about the ballpark deal.;
 Instead of going to the San Jose City Council next week as expected, the
report was put on hold until the council returns from its monthlong vacation
in early August.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  REVELATIONS ARE FEW
STADIUM QUESTIONS REMAIN AFTER PRIVATE SESSION  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     So the council will have to work fast if it wants to place a stadium
measure on the November ballot. Hammer said it could also go before voters
next April or June.;    As expected, the commission avoided pinning a price on
the project, working instead with the $160 million estimate developed in last
year's unsuccessful effort to build a Santa Clara stadium for the San
Francisco Giants.;    The commission also declined to say what portion of the
stadium tab taxpayers should bear.;    And, as expected, the commission
reported that:;    (check) The best site is a 138-acre plot near Zanker Road
and Highway 237.;    (check) The city should own the stadium outright or in
partnership with the Giants or some other private entity.;    (check) Odors
from the nearby sewage treatment plant are slight and can be eliminated
easily.;    (check) The city could use a variety of taxes, including a tax on
admissions and parking at the stadium, to help pay the bills. However, the
commission did not say which of the taxes it preferred.;    At a drizzly
afternoon news conference outside City Hall, the mayor hailed the commission's
results as "a very important milestone" in bringing the Giants to San Jose.
Earlier this week, the council tentatively set aside $40 million in
redevelopment money for the stadium.;    Hammer's remarks drew boos and
heckling from a small crowd of placard-toting homeless advocates who want the
city to spend more on housing.;    Asked whether all future stadium meetings
will be public, Hammer said, "I'm not going to make any guarantees.";
Earlier Friday, commission officials barred Mercury News reporters and the
public from their final meeting, despite arguments by the newspaper's
attorneys that closing the meeting violated the Ralph M. Brown Act, the
state's open-meeting law.;    Before and after the meeting, commission members
refused to comment on why the meeting had been closed or they evaded the
issue, insisting that nothing newsworthy was said. None, including elected
officials on the commission, said the meeting should have been open.;    All
other meetings of the 29-member commission have been open to the public.;
Replies ranged from a "no comment" offered by William L. Gates, an aide to
state Sen. Alfred Alquist, to a shrug from Santa Clara County Supervisor Ron
Gonzales.;    "I'm not concerned about it," Gonzales said. "I don't see what
the big issue is, myself.";    Sunnyvale Councilman Larry Stone, who began his
career arguing for open meetings in his hometown, said, "As it turned out, I
wouldn't have been uncomfortable if you (reporters) had been here." But Stone
argued that sensitive financial negotiating points with the Giants might have
been broached during the meeting -- reason enough, he said, to close it.;
Closed meeting opinions;  San Jose Councilman Joe Head agreed with Stone. But
councilmen Jim Beall and David Pandori -- who are not on the commission --
said the meeting should have been open.;    "It's disgusting that an issue of
such public importance was closed to the public," Beall said.;    When closing
of the meeting was announced Thursday, City Attorney Joan Gallo said the move
was legal because the commission is not a legislative body. She cited a
footnote to a 1989 court decision involving a commission appointed by San
Francisco's mayor.;    But Mercury News attorneys Edward P. Davis Jr. and
Donna Timmerman argued that the San Francisco ruling does not apply in San
Jose, where, unlike San Francisco, the mayor is a voting member of the city
council.;    New argument surfaces;  On Friday, however, Gallo offered another
argument for closing the meeting, saying the mayor's commission was nothing
more than a select group of personal advisers.;    "It isn't a board; it isn't
a commission," Gallo said. "They can call them what they want . . . but they
were not appointed by the council.";    Retorted Davis: "We've poked a hole in
her first argument and now she's got another one. I still believe we have a
Brown Act violation.";    Though Gallo argued that Hammer's assembled advisers
are not publicly accountable, the public supports their work in a multitude of
ways, down to the taxpayer-financed doughnuts and coffee provided at weekly
meetings.;    Two deputy city managers staff the group. So do members of the
mayor's office. The group meets in City Hall conference rooms. And the group
used city letterhead to announce its findings.;    "Brown Act or no Brown Act,
there are very few legitimate interests in closing these proceedings," said
Tom Newton, staff attorney for the California Newspaper Publishers
Association. "You've got a highly newsworthy event. Why not open it up?"  </TEXT>
