<HEAD>Fred Silverman's Programming Instinct Still Working</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Fred Silverman's famed ``golden gut''
instinct as a television programmer still seems to be in working
order.
   Silverman, former network wunderkind, now an independent
producer, got CBS to move his faltering series, ``Jake and the
Fatman,'' to Wednesdays. In the most recent ratings period the show
had jumped to 21st place, up from 43rd the week before.
   The show also won the time period, beating NBC's ``A Year in the
Life'' and ABC's ``Hooperman'' and ``Just in Time.''
   ``If you have a show with inherent strength, it's to everyone's
advantage to try to save it,'' Silverman said in an interview.
   ``The time period can be as important as the show itself. `Jake
and the Fatman' had been on on Tuesdays, where it was up against
ABC's `Moonlighting' and later NBC's `Hunter.' It was tough
competition and we had no lead-in to speak of.''
   The lead-in for ``Hunter'' is another Silverman show,
``Matlock.'' And if ``Jake'' stayed on Tuesday nights, its
competition would be a third Silverman series, ``In the Heat of the
Night,'' on NBC.
   Silverman was head of programming at CBS when it was No. 1 in
the ratings in the 1970s. He moved to ABC as entertainment
president in 1975, and ABC was soon the ratings winner for the
first time. The ``golden gut'' tag came from his acknowledged
decision-making on gut reaction.
   In 1978, he became president of NBC, but in three years was
unable to budge the network out of third place.
   After Silverman left NBC, he started his own production company.
Besides the three network series, his company also produces the
highly successful ``Perry Mason'' movies for NBC. He also plans to
bring back ``Burke's Law,'' the 1963-66 ABC series starring Gene
Barry, as a series of TV movies. He is working on a movie series
for Home Box Office about a former cop who becomes a lawyer, a role
he says would be good for Charles Bronson.
   ``My area of greatest expertise at the networks was the
half-hour comedies,'' said Silverman. ``I want to get into
comedies. Most of the shows in syndication are comedies that I
developed at the networks.''
   In ``Jake and the Fatman,'' William Conrad stars as J.L.
``Fatman'' McCabe, a tough district attorney. Joe Penny is Jake
Styles, his smooth and mysterious special investigator. The show
made its debut last September.
   ``My feeling is that when you change a show to a new day and
time it takes about a month to settle in,'' said Silverman. ``The
history of television has shown that sometimes you can save a
failing show by moving it to a new time period. It's more than just
wishful thinking. `Bonanza' was on Saturday against `Perry Mason'
its first two years. It barely survived, but RCA wanted to keep it
on because it was in color and was helping to sell color sets.
   ``Then NBC moved it to Sunday nights at 9 o'clock. After that it
was in first place or near first for the next 10 years. `The Dick
Van Dyke Show' floundered its first year on Tuesdays. It was a
Procter &amp; Gamble show and they insisted it get a shot in another
time period. It became a hit on Wednesdays.''
   ``All in the Family,'' ``M-A-S-H,'' ``Hawaii Five-0'' and
``Cannon'' were also shows that benefited by a time change.
   ```All in the Family' started on Tuesday nights between `Hee
Haw' and `The CBS News Hour,''' said Silverman. ``I don't think
anybody had any great faith in it. But we were having trouble with
a show on Saturday night and moved `All in the Family.' It just
exploded.
   ```M-A-S-H' just died on Sunday night, then it was moved to
Saturday behind `All in the Family.' It became second in the
ratings. `Hawaii Five-0' didn't do well until CBS switched it with
`The Jonathan Winters Show.' `Cannon' started at 9:30 p.m. Tuesday,
where it was up against the ABC movie and `Marcus Welby, M.D.' The
next year we moved it to Wednesday and it became a hit.

<HEADLINE>  DICK VAN DYKE LOOKS BACK, THEN AHEAD TO CAREER  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Television  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  IN A prime-time television world where things seem to be making less sense all
the time, try figuring this: Jerry Van Dyke stars each week in a network
series (ABC's "Coach"), and his brother, Dick Van Dyke, doesn't.;    This is
the same Jerry Van Dyke who once starred in a show called "My Mother, the
Car," and this is the same Dick Van Dyke who headlined what many still
consider to be the finest TV comedy series ever: "The Dick Van Dyke Show.";   
Not that Dick is harboring any bitterness. He is, in fact, his brother's
biggest fan, saying of Jerry's "Coach" role, "It's the best thing he's ever
done. It's the perfect part for Jerry.";    It isn't even that Dick wishes he
were starring in a series. He complains half-heartedly that no one will let
him retire when what he really wants to do is take it easy.;    It's just that
when you're a living comedy legend like Dick Van Dyke, people expect you to
work. One might also figure that he could earn a series regular's role
whenever he wants.;    Not so. Despite the viewing public's seeming taste for
nostalgia, the biggies from television's past have had a tough go of it when
trying to rekindle their series careers. Lucille Ball found out the hard way;
likewise Mary Tyler Moore, several times.;    Dick Van Dyke, too, has tried
comebacks. He met with limited success in the 1970s with "The New Dick Van
Dyke Show," but in 1987, "The Van Dyke Show," in which he starred with son
Barry, lasted only 12 episodes.;    But just when we might presume that Van
Dyke, 65, would yell "Uncle!" and opt for his oft-stated goal of
semi-retirement, hanging out in his Malibu digs with his seven grandkids and
going sailing and traveling at every opportunity, he's back for more.;   
Sunday night's NBC made-for-TV movie "Daughters of Privilege" starred Van Dyke
as a Florida newspaper mogul locked into a power struggle with his three saucy
adult daughters.;    Van Dyke returns Wednesday in a guest-star role on an
installment of CBS's "Jake and the Fatman." He portrays an eccentric doctor
accused of murdering a hospital administrator, who spearheads his own
investigation to clear his name.;    Interestingly, both projects are designed
to serve as pilots for future series. "Daughters of Privilege" is intended as
a possible soap. The "Jake and the Fatman" doctor role could spin off into a
weekly drama series with Van Dyke as star.;    Dick Van Dyke -- the new Marcus
Welby?;    "Well, not quite," Van Dyke said. "But I do like the character a
lot. He's an old-fashioned doctor, a veteran teacher and practitioner. I could
see myself playing him all the time.";    He wasn't nearly so enamored of his
"Daughters of Privilege" publishing magnate, because it's "so vastly different
from my real personality.";    In fact, Van Dyke believes he "didn't do very
well" in the film part, "and it shows.";    It was the antithesis of Van
Dyke's role as comedy writer Rob Petrie on the old "Dick Van Dyke Show," a CBS
show that ran for five seasons (1961-66) -- four of them at the top of the
ratings. It alternated for No. 1 with "The Beverly Hillbillies.";    Van Dyke
reflects on that time with Mary Tyler Moore, Rose Marie, Morey Amsterdam and
Richard Deacon as "the funnest five years of my life. I got spoiled rotten
working with Carl (Reiner, the show's creator and producer).";    The success
of "The Dick Van Dyke" show is simple to trace in retrospect, Van Dyke finds.;
   "Carl was such a student of human behavior," he said. "He wrote to our
speech patterns, our rhythms, the way we really spoke. All we had to do as
actors was play ourselves. We really all were the way we appeared in real
life. That's the real secret why it works so well. It was simple but
brilliant.";    The show holds up well because of the timeless way in which it
was written, Van Dyke adds.;    "One of the smartest things Carl did, and
which shows never seem to do anymore, is leave out any slang or catch phrases
of the day," he said. "There's no current-event talk to muddy up the plot. It
was just human relationships, which are always timeless."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>CBS Announces Fall Schedule: No `Equalizer,' `Beauty &amp; the Beast'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS is adding three new comedies to its Monday
night lineup and shifting its schedule on every night except Sunday
as it looks to shore up its prime-time schedule after a second
third-place ratings finish.
   The network, which announced its fall schedule Friday, is
dumping ``The Equalizer'' and ``Beauty &amp; the Beast,'' but keeping
critically praised but low-rated ``Tour of Duty.''
   It also is bringing back TV veterans Richard Chamberlain and
Lindsay Wagner in new series. Chamberlain will play a Hawaii doctor
and Wagner a zookeeper.
   NBC announced a basically unchanged prime-time schedule earlier
this week. ABC is scheduled to announce its 1989-90 fall lineup
next week. The new season begins Sept. 18.
   To quiet the expected howls over taking ``Beauty &amp; the Beast''
off the schedule, CBS Entertainment President Kim LeMasters said:
``We are not abandoning the show.''
   He said the network has ordered 12 episodes as ``backup.''
   ``We don't want to rush it on the air, because it needs a little
bit of work, and we want to tend to it, because we consider it a
precious commodity to our schedule,'' LeMasters said.
   The producers were unconvinced, however.
   ``They went out to murder the show,'' said Paul Witt of
Witt-Thomas Productions, which also produces the canceled
``Heartland.''
   ``They did give us a backup order for 12 shows, but that's a
face-saving gesture,'' he said. ``We're not angry yet. We're still
too stunned.''
   ``Beauty &amp; the Beast'' had emerged as the only hit among CBS'
new shows in the 1987-88 season. This season, delayed by the
writers' strike of last summer, it was taken off the air
temporarily and tried in other time periods. Its ratings dropped.
   As for ``The Equalizer,'' LeMasters said, it ``was a very, very
tough call,'' but was dropped because of lackluster ratings. The
crime drama had been on the air for four seasons.
   The Vietnam War drama ``Tour of Duty'' remained for its third
season despite mediocre ratings.
   ``It deserves to be on the schedule,'' said LeMasters. ``It says
a lot about our network and the kind of shows we want to be
associated with.''
   ``Paradise,'' a Western starring Lee Horsley, and ``Murphy
Brown,'' a comedy starring Candice Bergen as a network newswoman,
were the only new shows brought back for a second season.
   CBS is adding three new half-hour comedies to Monday night in an
attempt to bolster ``Murphy Brown,'' ``Designing Women'' and
``Newhart.''
   Other returning series included ``Murder, She Wrote,'' ``Jake
and the Fatman'' and ``Wiseguy'' and the durable soaps ``Knots
Landing,'' ``Dallas'' and ``Falcon Crest.'' New dramas were added
to Tuesday night instead of made-for-TV movies.
   All three of the news division's prime-time shows made the cut:
``60 Minutes,'' ``48 Hours'' and ``West 57th,'' the latter to be
``reformatted'' with the additon of anchorwoman Connie Chung.
   ``Rescue: 911,'' a midseason replacement, also returns.
   Gone are midseason replacements ``Live In'' and ``Heartland''
and the long-running ``Kate &amp; Allie,'' whose stars had not wanted
to return for another season.
   The new comedies are: ``Major Dad,'' starring Gerald McRaney
(``Simon &amp; Simon'') as a newlywed and recently retired Marine;
``The People Next Door,'' a fantasy starring Jeffrey Jones as a
cartoonist whose imaginings turn real, co-starring Mary Gross as
his psychologist wife; and ``The Famous Teddy Z,'' from ``Frank's
Place'' creator Hugh Wilson, starring Jon Cryer (``Pretty in
Pink'') as a young, hotshot Hollywood agent.
   The new hourlong shows are: ``Wolf,'' starring Jack Scalia as an
ex-cop working to clear his name; Chamberlain's tentatively titled
``The Hawaiian''; Wagner's ``A Peaceable Kingdom''; ``Top of the
Hill,'' starring William Katt as an idealistic surfer elected to
fill the unexpired term of his ailing congressman father; and
``Snoops,'' starring Tim and Daphne Reid, formerly of ``Frank's
Place,'' as Washington professionals _ he a noted criminologist,
she a protocol officer at the State Department.
   Here is CBS' fall schedule, night by night:
   Monday: ``Major Dad,'' ``The People Next Door,'' ``Murphy
Brown,'' ``The Famous Teddy Z,'' ``Designing Women,'' ``Newhart.''
   Tuesday: ``Rescue: 911,'' ``Wolf,'' ``The Hawaiian.''
   Wednesday: ``A Peaceable Kingdom,'' ``Jake and the Fatman,''
``Wiseguy.''
   Thursday: ``48 Hours,'' ``Top of the Hill,'' ``Knots Landing.''
   Friday: ``Snoops,'' ``Dallas,'' ``Falcon Crest.''
   Saturday: ``Paradise,'' ``Tour of Duty,'' ``West 57th.''
   Sunday: ``60 Minutes,'' ``Murder, She Wrote,'' ``CBS Sunday
Movie.''

CBS MAKES SEASON'S FIRST CHANGES; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE NETWORK PULLED 'E.A.R.T.H. FORCE' AND 'LENNY.' 'THE FLASH' WILL 
MOVE TO A NEW TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
CBS, off to a fast start in the 18-day-old fall TV season, moved quickly 
Thursday to keep its momentum by yanking the low-rated "E.A.R.T.H. Force" and 
also pulling the sitcom "Lenny" until it finds a better time slot for the 
blue-collar comedy. 
</P>
<P>
Streamlining its schedule as it prepares to broadcast up to three weeks of 
baseball's Major League Baseball playoffs and World Series, CBS also postponed 
the Oct. 25 debut of another series, "Sons and Daughters," and moved several 
other shows to new time periods. 
</P>
<P>
"E.A.R.T.H. Force," a series about a team of environmental protectors that 
debuted Sept. 16, apparently became the season's first cancellation as CBS 
announced that it "has been placed on hiatus" and "had its last regularly 
scheduled broadcast" last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of "Lenny," another new show, CBS said that it definitely will 
return to the schedule in a different time period. It had aired Wednesdays at 8 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
With the baseball playoffs a possible make-or-break period during the new 
season for CBS, the network -- which has finished third in prime time for the 
past three years but is a solid second thus far into the 1990-91 season -- 
appeared to be dumping or moving its ratings deadwood in preparation for a real 
run at No. 1 NBC. 
</P>
<P>
In a key move, CBS Entertainment President Jeff Sagansky also pulled Dan 
Rather's successful "48 Hours" from its new late-night Saturday slot and gave 
it the important 8-9 p.m. time period opening the Wednesday lineup, starting 
Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>
"48 Hours" did well last season against NBC's 8 p.m. Thursday powerhouse, "The 
Cosby Show." 
</P>
<P>
Now, "48 Hours" will lead into two other series upon which CBS is depending on 
Wednesday: the reliable ratings entry "Jake and the Fatman" and "WIOU," an 
upcoming new show about a local TV news operation, which many observers feel 
may be the network's best freshman program. 
</P>
<P>
CBS also made moves to strengthen its Thursday and Saturday lineups. On 
Thursday, "Top Cops," a reality show about police stories, switches from an 
hour to a 30-minute format and goes up against "Cosby," "The Simpsons" and 
"Father Dowling Mysteries," beginning Oct. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, "Top Cops" knocked off both NBC's "Hunter" and ABC's "Cop Rock" 
head-to-head. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursdays, CBS will move its comic-book entry "The Flash," which has 
started stronger than expected, out of direct competition with "Cosby" and "The 
Simpsons." It will follow "Top Cops" from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m., with CBS hoping 
the carryover last half-hour of the show will draw viewers away from NBC's 
"Cheers." 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out CBS' Thursday lineup will be "Doctor, Doctor" and another reliable 
ratings winner, "Knots Landing." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturdays, CBS has revamped its 9-11 p.m. lineup after dumping "E.A.R.T.H. 
Force" and moving "48 Hours." Starting Nov. 17, "Wiseguy," with Steven Bauer 
replacing Ken Wahl, will be a weekly entry. Beginning Nov. 24, it will be 
joined by "Broken Badges," a series about an undercover crime-fighting unit. 
</P>
<P>
"Wiseguy," which has been shown in late-night reruns in recent months, will be 
CBS' entry against ABC's "Twin Peaks." 
</P>
<P>
CBS said that while "Lenny" will return soon, "Sons and Daughters," a family 
drama, has been "postponed until a later date." 
</P>
<P>

   ABC's ``Coach'' is a winner.
   The formula _ lovable bruiser of a dad, plus teen-age daughter
equals laughs _ is as old as the Gipper. But in this incarnation,
some decent writing and an especially fine cast add up to a nice
little comedy.
   Craig T. Nelson plays Hayden Fox, football coach for the
Minnesota State Screaming Eagles, a tough guy with a soft spot for
the ladies in his life _ his sportscaster girlfriend, played by
Shelley Fabares, and Kelly (Clare Carey), his teen-age daughter from
a long-ended marriage who shows up to attend college.
   Jerry Van Dyke is a hoot as assistant coach Luther Van Dam, a
perpetually befuddled sort whose mouth runs more than the team's
best halfback.
   In Tuesday's preview episode, he must ride herd on a
buffalo-sized player who has to lose 11 pounds by Saturday's game.
``Maybe we could get him some of that hippo-suction they talk
about,'' Luther suggests. Bill Fagerbakke rounds out the regulars as
big, dumb Dauber Dybinski, a career college junior.
   The show, from ``Newhart'' creator Barry Kemp, has a preview
Tuesday night, then moves to its regular time period on Wednesday
where it will be paired in later weeks with the much-less-appealing
new ``Anything But Love'' _ but more on that some other time.
   In the preview episode, written by Mark Ganzel, Kelly lets slip
that she has a date with a professor. Dad promises not to interfere.
But through the process of elimination he finds the English
professor he suspects of daring to mess with his daughter.
   ``Forty, single and published _ just the kind of guy I have no
respect for,'' he complains to Luther.
   He pays a visit to the professor, and though he brandishes the
professor's bust of Shakespeare _ Fox thinks it's ``some president''
_ he is proud of the fact that he does not resort to physical
violence. Luther later agrees helpfully: ``If you didn't hit him or
break his statue or anything, that's good.''
   Wednesday's episode, written by Kemp, is the pilot for the show.
Kelly shows up and considers living with her dad, complicating his
long singlehood.
   It's tough out there in the big leagues, but ``Coach'' deserves
to have a nice, long season.

   Elsewhere in television:
   `FATMAN' REDUX _ ``Jake &amp; The Fatman,'' the show George Bush once
suggested everybody tune to rather than watch Democratic
presidential candidates, returns to the CBS schedule on March 15
with a two-hour episode. It replaces ``The Equalizer,'' which is
going on hiatus and WILL return, no kidding. In the new incarnation,
ex-cop J.L. ``Fatman'' McCabe has retired to Hawaii (Hey! Let's move
the show to Hawaii!) where he still gets involved in crimes and
teams up with special investigator Jake Styles (Joe Penny). ...
   JUST TRYING TO GET SOME SLEEP _ Charlie Gibson, who celebrated
his second anniversary as co-host of ABC's ``Good Morning America''
on Thursday, says the job is just swell _ except for the minor
problem of sleep deprivation. He figures since leaving the Capitol
beat in Washington to take over for departed co-host David Hartman,
he's lost 2,000 hours of sleep. That's 83 days, including nights. If
anyone has seen these lost hours of sleep, please send them to ABC.
Charlie will give you a nice nap as a tip. ...
   THOSE WACKY GOVERNORS _ C-SPAN will have live coverage of the
National Governors' Association annual mid-winter meeting in
Washington, D.C., starting Sunday. The meeting goes through Tuesday
morning. ...
   MOONWALKS DU JOUR _ The Arts &amp; Entertainment Network is off to a
head start in the race to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the
landing of Apollo XI on the moon, and will run NBC's coverage of the
events as they originally aired in July 1969 on the 20th anniversary
this summer. The coverage will air in three parts: ``Liftoff'' on
July 16, ``Moonwalk'' on July 20 and ``Recovery'' on July 24. A&amp;E
did the same thing on the Kennedy assassination 25th anniversary.
... The Showtime pay cable channel has acquired ``Moonwalker,''
Michael Jackson's 1988 feature-length anthology film. The
entertainer stars as himself in a series of vignettes, including the
41-minute centerpiece of the film, a battle against evil Mr. Big,
who tries to destroy the world by getting kids hooked on drugs.

<TEXT>  KEVIN Arnold, our teen hero of "The Wonder Years," finishes junior high in
tonight's episode, presumably to start high school next fall, when the show
returns for its fifth season.;    But I wonder what Kevin will be doing if the
show lasts as long as "Dallas" did and returns for its 13th season in the fall
of 1999?;    Think what you like, but I doubt Kevin's still going to be as
winsome when he's 22 or so. ABC may have to chemically mess up the hormones of
actor Fred Savage, who plays Kevin, if they want him to remain terminally
cute.;    For that matter, I don't think I want to see Winnie Cooper, Kevin's
on-again/off-again girlfriend, after puberty gets through with her. I think
she's going to turn out to be one of those burly truck-stop mamas with a
shrill little girl's voice.;    I'm also reasonably certain Kevin's older
brother, Wayne, is growing up to be Sean Penn, which is sort of like not
growing up at all.;    And Kevin's pal, Paul Pfeiffer, already is outgrowing
his role as resident nerd. Soon he'll be big enough to punch out the "hoods"
on campus and won't need to be Kevin's sidekick anymore. In fact, Kevin's
beginning to look like Paul's sidekick.;    My point: "The Wonder Years" may
be one of those TV shows with a limited future. Thank goodness. The worst
thing that could happen would be for it to last 13 seasons, desperately trying
to retain its charm.;    The truth is: Most TV shows are programmed to
self-destruct long before that. I call it the "Shadow Syndrome" after the old
CBS series "The White Shadow," which went only three seasons.;    Even if the
ratings had been good, which they weren't, "The White Shadow" couldn't have
lasted much longer than that, because most of the leading characters were high
school kids -- played by guys in their 20s -- who were bound to graduate some
day.;    The only series with high school characters dumb enough to stay in
high school 13 years was "Welcome Back, Kotter." Fortunately, the network
wasn't dumb enough to keep it on that long. So, let's face it, no TV show
about school kids is going to last as long as "Dallas.";    Long-running TV
shows are rare. Most that manage to go past 10 years feature adult actors who
aren't going to outgrow their roles. They kept the original "Lassie" series on
17 years not only by changing collies every three or four years, but also by
dumping the kids at the first signs of either facial hair or training bras.;  
 "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" lasted 14 seasons, but if little Ricky
had grown up to be a plumber instead of a rock star, the whole family might
have been put out to pasture much earlier.;    Danny Thomas got 13 seasons out
of the show that started as "Make Room for Daddy" and ended as "Make Room for
Granddaddy." By the end of the 12 seasons logged by "My Three Sons," it seemed
like most of the sons had sons.;    So, as long as we're thinking along these
lines, why not speculate on what some of our favorite TV shows will be like if
they last as long as "Dallas"? Starting with:;    (box) "The Golden Girls" --
It's 1998, and the setting has shifted to the Balmy Sands Nursing Home, where
Dorothy (Bea Arthur) keeps spitting up on her bib; Blanche (Rue McClanahan) is
coming on to a guy on a respirator; and Sophia (Estelle Getty) is now a
tactless ghost who rattles her chains when everybody's trying to watch
"Murder, She Wrote." Rose (Betty White) visits when she's not on the lecture
circuit.;    (box) "Doogie Howser, M.D." is now known as "Calling Douglas
Howser," which reflects its progression from a whimsical comedy about a
16-year-old genius surgeon to a one-hour action drama about a trouble-prone
physician/detective (Neil Patrick Harris) who tackles cases with the help of
his faithful aide, Vincent (Max Casella).;    (box) "Full House" will be known
as "Full House: The Next Generation" by its 13th season in the year 2000. Bob
Saget and David Coulier left in the 1990s to host game shows. The show now
focuses on 23-year-old D.J. (Candace Cameron), the divorced mother of three
kids, who lives in the same full house, where she also takes care of her teen
sister Michelle (Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen) and her "uncle" Jesse (John
Stamos), an alcoholic ex-rock musician.;    (box) "Quantum Leap" enters its
13th season by moving to its 116th new time period. This season Sam (Scott
Bakula) will play a girl for the 38th time, give birth to a baby for the 21st
time and wind up in the body of a black man for the 17th time.;    (box)
"Parker Lewis Can't Lose" will no longer take place in high school by 2003 but
will take place in prison, where Parker (Corin Nemec) is a trustee and Musso
(Melanie Chartoff) is the warden. Musso's sex change operation was the
highlight of the ninth season.;    (box) "Jake and the Fatman," which became
just "Jake" in the 1994-95 season when William Conrad left to become
commercial spokesman for Fatburgers, continues with Joe Penny as detective
Jake Styles. However, CBS has warned Penny that if his rapidly gaining weight
tops 300 pounds, the show will be retitled "Jake IS the Fatman" at
mid-season.;    (box) "Family Matters," which became "Urkel's Family" in its
fifth season, now concentrates on grown-up nerd Steve Urkel (Jaleel White),
who's now counselor to his own "family" of nerds at an urban high school.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>CBS Brings Back Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore _ In
Back-To-Back Shows</HEAD>

   CBS announced Thursday it is canceling
``Cagney &amp; Lacey'' and bringing back Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van
Dyke in separate comedies this fall as the network struggles to get
out of third place in the ratings where it ended up this season for
the first ever.
   In an effort to draw younger viewers, the network is adding a
number of comedies, including a half-hour romantic comedy based on
the hit movie ``Dirty Dancing.''
   ``Cagney &amp; Lacey,'' one of CBS's most popular and prestigious
shows, has been canceled, and the critically acclaimed ``Frank's
Place'' has been put on the shelf until a place in the schedule can
be found for it, CBS Entertainment President Kim LeMasters said.
Also held back for mid-season were ``Kate &amp; Allie,'' ``Simon &amp;
Simon'' and ``Jake and the Fatman.''
   Besides ``Cagney &amp; Lacey,'' other shows cut from the schedule
are ``Eisenhower &amp; Lutz,'' ``High Mountain Rangers,'' ``Houston
Knights,'' ``The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.''
   Van Dyke and Miss Moore, who played a married couple on the
1960s hit ``The Dick Van Dyke Show,'' will star in back-to-back
comedies on Wednesdays.
   In ``The Van Dyke Show,'' at 8 p.m. Eastern time, stars Van Dyke
and his real-life son, Barry, in a comedy about a turbulent
relationship between a father and son. Van Dyke plays a star of
Broadway helping his son run a struggling theater company.
   Miss Moore, whose yet untitled show follows at 8:30 p.m., plays
an independent divorcee named Annie Block who hooks up with a
recently widowed construction engineer played by Edward J. Moore.
Eileen Heckart plays Annie's ultraliberal mother, and John Randolph
plays his archconservative father.
   Patrick Cassidy and Melora Hardin star in ``Dirty Dancing,''
based on the movie starring Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey. The
two play headstrong kids in the 1960s working at a resort owned by
her father, played by McLean Stevenson of ``M-A-S-H'' fame.
   Candice Bergen, in her first series, stars as a successful
television reporter in ``Murphy Brown.''
   Other new shows:
   _``Close To Home,'' a half-hour comedy about the relationship
between a teen-age girl (Royana Black) and her father (James
Naughton).
   _``Almost Grown,'' an hour drama that follows a New Jersey
married couple (Tim Daly and Eve Gordon) through three decades,
with an emphasis on the music that bound them through dating,
mating, maturing and enduring.
   _``Paradise,'' an hour drama about a Western gunfighter (Lee
Horsley) who unexpectedly ``inherits'' his sister's four young
children.
   _``TV 101,'' an hour drama about a journalism teacher (Sam
Robards) who tries to bring a high school newspaper into the
television age. It's the first show from Grant Tinker's GTG
Entertainment.
   LeMasters said taking ``Frank's Place'' off the schedule was
``one of the toughest decisions I had to make.''
   ``It's an extraordinary show,'' he said. ``But what it boiled
down to was, would I put it on the schedule to be bounced around,
or would I take the heat and hold it for an advantageous time
period.''
   He said CBS was committed to 13 episodes of ``Frank's Place.''
   ``The decision to cancel the Emmy-winning drama `Cagney &amp; Lacey'
was a close call and was not made until Tuesday,'' said LeMasters.
``But the show had suffered the slings and arrows. We felt it was
time for it to go off before it got beaten up more.''
   ``Cagney &amp; Lacey'' was canceled in 1983, but CBS brought it back
the following year after a letter-writing campaign by fans.
   LeMasters said ``Kate &amp; Allie'' was being held back because he
wanted to take a more aggressive approach to Monday programming.
   LeMasters said the decision to retain two news shows, ``48
Hours'' and ``57th Street,'' in addition to the popular ``60
Minutes'' was unrelated to the writers strike. News show writers
are not member of the striking Writers Guild of America. LeMasters
said the shows were kept on the schedule on the basis of quality.
   The writers strike, which began March 7, threatens to delay the
beginning of the new season for the networks, though NBC will be
able start in September with prime-time coverage of the Summer
Olympics. CBS announced last month that it would delay the season
at least until late October.
   Talks between producers and the striking writers recently
resumed through a federal mediator.
   Here is the CBS prime-time schedule for the fall:
   _ Monday: ``Newhart,'' ``Coming of Age,'' ``Murphy Brown,''
``Designing Women,'' ``Almost Grown.''
   _ Tuesday: ``TV 101,'' ``CBS Tuesday Movie.''
   _ Wednesday: ``The Van Dyke Show,'' ``The Mary Tyler Moore
Series,'' ``The Equalizer,'' ``Wiseguy.''
   _ Thursday: ``48 Hours,'' ``Paradise,'' ``Knots Landing.''
   _ Friday: ``Beauty and the Beast,'' ``Dallas,'' ``Falcon Crest.''
   _ Saturday: ``Dirty Dancing,'' ``Close to Home,'' ``Tour of
Duty,'' ``West 57th Street.''
   _ Sunday: ``60 Minutes,'' ``Murder, She Wrote,'' ``CBS Sunday
Movie.''

<HL> CBS to Introduce 8 New TV Shows In Its Fall Lineup </HL>

   The CBS television network, attempting to rebuild its prime-time schedule after finishing this season in last place, will introduce 5 1/2 hours of new programming for the new TV season next fall. 

   The five new half-hour comedies and three new hour-long dramas announced yesterday are part of a costly and risky reshaping of the CBS schedule. 
CBS Inc.'s network hasn't had a new hit in four years. 
It may face an uphill battle: The writers' strike has idled production; CBS didn't show any film clips in unveiling the schedule; and in one case, a new comedy featuring Mary Tyler Moore, CBS hasn't even decided on a name. 

   CBS is renewing six series introduced in the past year -- including "Beauty and the Beast," Vietnam drama "Tour of Duty" and news shows "48 Hours" and "West 57th" -- despite their dismal ratings. 
Four other series will be bumped from the fall schedule but will be kept in production for later broadcast, a costly move. 

   CBS also is canceling eight shows, including "Cagney &amp; Lacey," the acclaimed show with policewomen, even though its ratings are considerably higher than some of the series that will stay on the air. 

   Kim LeMasters, who became CBS Entertainment president in the fall of 1986 and who conceded his future may depend on how the new schedule fares, hailed the lineup. 
He said it aims at luring younger viewers, whom advertisers prize the most, at a time when CBS's audience is by far the oldest. 
The changes also aim at dropping some old shows in favor of new ones that may have a longer life ahead. 

   Among CBS's new shows are the vehicle for Ms. Moore and "The Van Dyke Show," produced by former NBC President Grant Tinker's new company. 
It features an aging, longtime CBS star -- Dick Van Dyke -- and his son, Barry, who team up to run a faltering theater company. 

   Another comedy, "Murphy Brown," casts the actress Candice Bergen as a "wildly successful" TV star reporter. 
Mr. LeMasters approved the show despite his own doubts that Ms. Bergen is right for the comedic part, and even after she did a test reading that he said was "abysmal." 
He said he approved it on the strong urging of Diane English, one of the show's two executive producers. 

   CBS also will aim at the younger audience with the one-hour drama "TV 101," about a young journalism teacher; "Close to Home," a comedy about a daughter-father relationship; and a comedy bearing the name and plot of the film "Dirty Dancing." 

   But most of the nine new shows CBS introduced last fall also wooed the young, and most flopped. 
Only three return ("Beauty and the Beast," "Tour of Duty," and slick undercover-cop show "Wiseguy"), and none ranked higher than 49th among prime-time shows. 

   Two other new shows introduced last season will be in production but won't start in the fall lineup. 
They are "Frank's Place," about a New Orleans restauranteur and the most critically acclaimed of CBS's new shows from last season, and "Jake and the Fatman," whose major claim to fame was a plug by Vice President George Bush during a primary debate. 
Two older series, "Kate &amp; Allie" and "Simon &amp; Simon," also will be made for airing later in the season. 

   Among the shows CBS canceled: "The Oldest Rookie," "My Sister Sam," "Houston Knights," "The Law and Harry McGraw" and three recent midseason replacements -- "Eisenhower &amp; Lutz," "High Mountain Rangers" and "Trial and Error." 
One midseason replacement, "Coming of Age," about a cantankerous retiree couple, will be renewed.

   The Who, a British rock band of the 1960s,
fell short of a sellout for their 25th anniversary concert, but for
devoted fans, their performance at the University of Colorado was a
hit.
   The band's reprisals of favorites _ from the overture to
``Tommy,'' the explosive ``Baba O'Riley'' and ``My Generation'' _
had the crowd cheering Sunday evening.
   ``We'll go as far as we have to go to see them,'' said Jon
Ellingson, 27, of Wayne, Neb., reverently dressed in a Union Jack
T-shirt and jeans. ``We've got our flags, our hats, our bandanas.
... We'll be listening to them as long as we can.''
   Fewer than 47,000 of the 57,000 tickets pre-purchased by Boulder
radio station KBCO were sold.
   ``Some people say it was the way we promoted the show, or that
The Who may not be the group that baby boomers wanted to see,'' said
KBCO's 40-year-old general manager Ray Skibitsky.
   ``If I knew the answer,'' he said, ``I would have sold out the
show.''

   Will they have to rename the show ``Jake and the
Trim Man?''
   William Conrad, 68, has lost a sizable portion of the girth that
led to the title ``Jake and the Fatman'' for his CBS series,
currently filming here for the upcoming season.
   ``I was down to 242 from 290 pounds,'' Conrad said in an
interview published Monday. ``This year, I was way down to 235. But
after I worked a couple of weeks, I was really tired. And I needed
to eat. So I know I've put back a couple of pounds. But I want to
get down to 220.''
   He says it hasn't been easy to lose weight in Hawaii, famed for
its international mix of cuisine.
   ``I do love that island food,'' he said. ``But the killer is the
mai tais and the chi chis _ Gosh! I can drink those all day long.''
   Conrad says the Fatman's role, rather than his waistline, will
expand this season.
   ``I simply didn't have enough to do,'' he said. ``I'd show up at
the end of the show and say something like, `Well, is everything OK,
Jake?' Now I look forward to going to work, not only because I have
more to do, but because the scripts have been absolutely great.
We're rolling.''

   Don Johnson has fans so worked up here to
meet him or find out where scenes are being shot for his new movie
that some have taken the extreme measure of seeking help from the
Chamber of Commerce.
   The former star of ``Miami Vice'' and director Dennis Hopper on
Monday began filming ``Hot Spot,'' a crime thriller and love story
that is touted as being in the tradition of the steamy ``Body Heat.''
   Very few residents in this town of about 10,600 about 25 miles
north of Austin have voiced concerns that the movie appears to be
headed to a solid ``R'' rating. Bedroom scenes between Johnson and
Virginia Madsen are to be filmed in a 96-year-old stucco mansion,
according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
   ``What I tell everybody,'' said Chamber Executive Director Debra
Gore, ``is if you have Don Johnson in town you're going to have to
expect that,'' she said.

   It's a long way from Butcher Hollow, Ky., to
Boston's Symphony Hall, but country singer Loretta Lynn and her
sister, Crystal Gayle, didn't worry as they waited to rehearse with
the Boston Pops Orchestra.
   ``Well, of course, I did sing one time with Luciano Pavarotti,''
Mrs. Lynn recalled. ``We did an opera song. Don't ask me which one.
You know how opera songs are.''
   The sisters were interviewed by TV Guide magazine as they
prepared for their ``Evening at Pops'' program, scheduled to air on
PBS stations Aug. 25. Their comments appear in the Aug. 19 issue of
the magazine.
   Miss Gayle said her more citified ``pop'' style is one reason for
her success.
   ``There's only one Loretta Lynn,'' she said. ``If I were real
country, I probably wouldn't do as well because people would say,
`She's just trying to sound like her sister.'''
   The sisters teamed up with the 100-piece orchestra to perform
``We've Come a Long Way, Baby,'' ``Wrong Road Again,'' ``One's on
the Way'' and ``Rocky Top.'' Mrs. Lynn was asked if the Boston Pops
was the largest orchestra she'd ever appeared with.
   ``Well, they're the loudest,'' she said.

   Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke will be back
on CBS in separate new series this fall, but ``Cagney &amp; Lacey'' are
gone.
   Also canceled are ``Houston Knights,'' ``High Mountain
Rangers,'' ``Eisenhower &amp; Lutz'' and ``The Smothers Brothers Comedy
Hour.''
   ``The decision to cancel the Emmy-winning drama `Cagney &amp; Lacey'
was a close call and was not made until Tuesday,'' said CBS
President Kim LeMasters. ``But the show had suffered the slings and
arrows. We felt it was time for it to go off before it got beaten
up more.''
   ``Cagney &amp; Lacey'' was canceled in 1983, but CBS brought it back
after a letter-writing campaign by fans.
   The critically praised series ``Frank's Place'' isn't in the
fall lineup, but LeMasters said it would return next season as soon
as there is a protected time period where it can stay put. ``Kate &amp;
Allie'' and ``Jake and the Fatman'' are also being held until later
in the season.
   Taking ``Frank's Place'' off the schedule was ``one of the
toughest decisions I had to make,'' said LeMasters. ``It's an
extraordinary show. But what it boiled down to was, would I put it
on the schedule to be bounced around, or would I take the heat and
hold it for an advantageous time period?''
   Other shows that were new in 1987 that did make the
second-season slate were ``Coming of Age,'' a mid-season
replacement, ``Wiseguy,'' ``Beauty and the Beast'' and ``Tour of
Duty.''
   CBS has already announced that its new season will begin a month
late, in October, because of the strike by the Writers Guild of
America.
   When it does get underway, there will be new comedies from Mary
Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke, who played husband and wife in the
popular 1960s sitcom ``The Dick Van Dyke Show.'' This time they'll
have separate shows, but they'll air back-to-back on Wednesdays.
   In her show, yet to be named, Moore will play a New York
divorcee. In ``The Van Dyke Show,'' Van Dyke plays a Broadway star
trying to help his more cerebral son, played by Van Dyke's
real-life son, Barry, keep a struggling theater group going.
   The network has added several new comedies to the schedule in an
effort to draw younger viewers. Among these is ``Dirty Dancing,''
based on the hit movie of the same name. Patrick Cassidy and Melora
Hardin will play the Patrick Swayze-Jennifer Grey roles.
   Candice Bergen will make her television series debut in ``Murphy
Brown,'' playing a big star from a popular network news show.
   Other news shows are:
   _``Close to Home,'' half-hour comedy starring James Naughton,
Royana Black, Mirian Flynn, Steve Vinovich and Bryan Cranston,
about a father and teen-age daughter (Naughton, Black) adjusting to
life with mom, who has left to ``discover'' herself.
   _``Almost Grown,'' one-hour drama about three decades in the
life of a marriage with emphasis on music, starring Tim Daly and
Eve Gordon as the couple who meet and marry in the '60s.
   _``Paradise,'' one-hour drama set in the 1890s starring Lee
Horsley as a gunfighter who inherits his sister's four young
children.
   _``TV 101,'' one-hour drama starring Sam Robards as a journalism
teacher who returns to his old high school to teach television
reporting.
   ``Van Dyke,'' ``Close to Home,'' ``TV 101'' are the first series
from GTG Entertainment, Grant Tinker's new production company.
   CBS News was celebrating the retention of the all three hours of
prime-time news programming. It had been rumored last week that
either ``48 Hours'' or ``West 57th'' would have to go. ``60
Minutes'' is a top-10 show. But when the schedule was announced,
all three shows were in the lineup, in their same time periods.
LeMasters said the decision had nothing to do with the writers
strike _news show writers are in a different union _ and the shows
were retained strictly on the basis of merit.
   Here is the CBS prime-time schedule for the fall:
   Monday: ``Newhart,'' ``Coming of Age,'' ``Murphy Brown,''
``Designing Women,'' ``Almost Grown.''
   Tuesday: ``TV 101,'' ``CBS Tuesday Movie.''
   Wednesday: ``The Van Dyke Show,'' ``Mary Tyler Moore,'' ``The
Equalizer,'' ``Wiseguy.''
   Thursday: ``48 Hours,'' ``Paradise,'' ``Knot's Landing.''
   Friday: ``Beauty and the Beast,'' ``Dallas,'' ``Falcon Crest.''
   Saturday: ``Dirty Dancing,'' ``Close to Home,'' ``Tour of

   Sunday: ``60 Minutes,'' ``Murder, She Wrote,'' ``CBS Sunday

   CBS Inc. unveiled its most radically restructured fall prime-time television schedule ever in a gamble to revive its stagnant ratings. 

   The company said its second-ranked television network, which posted its lowest prime-time ratings ever in the just-ended 1986-87 season, will replace eight of its 22 hours of weekly prime-time programming in September and bring back 15 current series. 

   That is the most hours of programming ever replaced by the CBS network, topping the 7 1/2 hours it scrapped in fall 1977, CBS research officials said. 
In recent seasons, CBS typically has replaced five or fewer hours of programming each fall. 

   Among other changes, CBS said it will drop two of its current three nights of movies, or four hours of programming in movies alone. 
And at the critical 8 p.m. EST start of prime time, it is introducing new shows -- mainly hourlong dramas -- on five nights. 

   "It's a daring schedule," said Joel M. Segal, executive vice president for Ted Bates Worldwide Inc., New York. 
"They've taken extraordinary steps to stop their decline." 

   CBS previously has acknowledged that its network posted operating losses for the 1986 fourth quarter and this year's first quarter because of its lower ratings and the soft national advertising market. 

   CBS historically has been the top-ranked network, requiring fewer changes in its schedule than its rivals. 
But for the past two seasons, CBS has finished second behind a powerful National Broadcasting Co., which has been helped by "The Cosby Show" and other hits. 

   "We hope we're going to be right up there nip and tuck" with NBC this fall, Laurence A. Tisch, CBS president and chief executive officer, said. 
"And maybe we'll be ahead." 

   CBS said it will introduce seven new dramas but only two new half-hour comedies. 
Among the new shows are "Tour of Duty," a one-hour drama about a platoon of young U.S soldiers on combat duty in Viet Nam in the late 1960s; "Beauty and the Beast," a one-hour version of the classic story set in present-day New York; "Jake and the Fatman," starring William "Cannon" Conrad as a tough district attorney; and "Frank's Place," a comedy about a very proper college professor who inherits a New Orleans restaurant. 

   Canceled shows include "The Wizard," "Outlaws," "The New Mike Hammer" and "Scarecrow and Mrs. King." 
CBS officials said the network's "West 57th" news program tentatively will return to the schedule in fall, but that its future hinges on its summer ratings. 
If canceled, CBS then will be replacing nine hours of shows in September. 

   Replacing old shows is always a gamble for any network because existing shows at least have defined audiences and track records, and replacements may attract even fewer viewers. 
But they could also turn out to be hits, and CBS hasn't had a new top-10 show since the debut of "Murder, She Wrote" in fall 1984. 

   By dropping movies, CBS hopes to improve the odds that it will develop more hit series. 
Despite the large number of movies, miniseries and specials, a network's fortunes typically rise or fall on the strength of regular series programming. 

   CBS also hopes in part to build its 8-to-9-p.m.-EST time slot. 
Under the concept of "audience flow," a viewer hooked into the schedule at 8 p.m. will tend to watch the shows that follow on that network, helping programs later in the evening. 
NBC's strength has been in its ablility to program well at 8 p.m. 

   CBS, however, has "not been successful in recent years with youth-appeal comedies or youth-appeal dramas" at 8 p.m., said Betsy Frank, senior vice president and associate research director for DFS Dorland, New York. 
"This year, they are trying to reach adults at 8 p.m. -- there's really not much for kids throughout this schedule." 
But, she added, "There are so many new shows, there is so much that can go wrong." 

   NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., said it will replace only four hours of programming in fall, while ABC, a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., is expected to announce its new schedule shortly.

CBS MAKES SEASON'S FIRST CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CBS, off to a fast start in the 18-day-old fall TV season, moved quickly 
Thursday to keep its momentum by yanking the low-rated "E.A.R.T.H. Force" and 
also pulling the sitcom "Lenny" until it finds a better time slot for the 
blue-collar comedy. 
</P>
<P>
Streamlining its schedule as it prepares to broadcast up to three weeks of 
baseball's Major League baseball playoffs and World Series, CBS also postponed 
the Oct. 25 debut of another series, "Sons and Daughters," and moved several 
other shows to new time periods. 
</P>
<P>
"E.A.R.T.H. Force," a series about a team of environmental protectors that 
debuted Sept. 16, apparently became the season's first cancellation as CBS 
announced that it "has been placed on hiatus" and "had its last regularly 
scheduled broadcast" last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of "Lenny," another new show, CBS said that it definitely will 
return to the schedule in a different time period. It had aired Wednesdays at 8 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
With the baseball playoffs a possible make-or-break period during the new 
season for CBS, the network -- which has finished third in prime time for the 
past three years but is a solid second thus far into the 1990-91 season -- 
appeared to be dumping or moving its ratings deadwood in preparation for a real 
run at No. 1 NBC. 
</P>
<P>
In a key move, CBS Entertainment President Jeff Sagansky also pulled Dan 
Rather's successful "48 Hours" from its new late-night Saturday slot and gave 
it the important 8-9 p.m. time period opening the Wednesday lineup, starting 
Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>
"48 Hours" did well last season against NBC's 8 p.m. Thursday powerhouse, "The 
Cosby Show." 
</P>
<P>
Now, "48 Hours" will lead into two other series upon which CBS is depending on 
Wednesday: the reliable ratings entry "Jake and the Fatman" and "WIOU," an 
upcoming new show about a local TV news operation, which many observers feel 
may be the network's best freshman program. 
</P>
<P>
CBS also made moves to strengthen its Thursday and Saturday lineups. On 
Thursday, "Top Cops," a reality show about police stories, switches from an 
hour to a 30-minute format and goes up against "Cosby," "The Simpsons" and 
"Father Dowling Mysteries," beginning Oct. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursdays, CBS will move its comic-book entry "The Flash," which has 
started stronger than expected, out of direct competition with "Cosby" and "The 
Simpsons." It will follow "Top Cops" from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m., with CBS hoping 
the carryover last half-hour of the show will draw viewers away from NBC's 
"Cheers." 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out CBS' Thursday lineup will be "Doctor, Doctor" and another reliable 
ratings winner, "Knots Landing." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturdays, CBS has revamped its 9-11 p.m. lineup after dumping "E.A.R.T.H. 
Force" and moving "48 Hours." Starting Nov. 17, "Wiseguy," with Steven Bauer 
replacing Ken Wahl, will be a weekly entry. Beginning Nov. 24, it will be 
joined by "Broken Badges," a series about an undercover crime-fighting unit.

<DESCRIPT>  FALL; TELEVISION; SHOW; LIST  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  RENEWING "Northern Exposure," re-signing Carol Burnett and routing "The Flash"
back to comic books, CBS announced its new fall schedule Friday, a
comedy-laden lineup it hopes will continue the network's climb out of the
Nielsen cellar, where it fell last year.;    "CBS was the only network to
increase its prime-time audience, broaden its demographic base and lower its
average age this past season," network entertainment president Jeff Sagansky
said in a statement accompanying the announcement.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  CBS PINS FUTURE ON COMEDY LINEUP FOR ITS
COMEBACK  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Television  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "The Flash," a very expensive, heavily promoted video version of the
comic-book character, was part of that drive to lower the age of the network's
average viewer, which seemed until recently to be just shy of Methuselah.;   
But the show never caught on and will not be back in the fall; neither will
"Dallas," whose cancellation was announced a few weeks ago. Also disappearing
are "Guns of Paradise," "The Antagonists," "Doctor, Doctor," "Good Sports" and
three shows that will never return from the dreaded hiatus: "WIOU," "Lenny"
and "Family Man.";    Occupying one of the former "Dallas" slots next season
at 9 on Fridays will be a new version of "The Carol Burnett Show.";   
Burnett, whose first variety incarnation ran 13 seasons on CBS in the '60s and
'70s, had been doing a half-hour sketch show on NBC the last two years. When
she wanted to revert to variety and expand to an hour, NBC let her go, and she
was quickly snapped up by CBS.;    "Northern Exposure," which crept onto the
network quietly last summer and managed to become one of the few critical and
viewer hits when it returned this spring, will be back in the same 10 o'clock
Monday slot, where it replaced Sharon Gless' "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill" at
midseason.;    "O'Neill," which gathered too few viewers to survive on one of
the network's best rating nights, will return in the fall but at an even
tougher time: opposite "Cheers," the top-rated show of the season, at 9 on
Thursdays.;    Other shows being renewed and staying where they are include
"Murphy Brown," "Designing Women," "Evening Shade," "Jake and the Fatman,"
"Top Cops," "Rescue 911," "Major Dad," "Murder, She Wrote" and "Knots
Landing.";    As for new shows, the network will throw a pair of sitcoms at us
to start both Wednesday and Friday nights, while bringing on a new Stephen
Cannell show at 10 on Fridays and a comedic drama about a con artist in the
witness-protection program in Palm Springs at 10 on Saturdays.;   
Descriptions and times of the new shows:;    "The Royal Family," at 8 on
Wednesdays, brings Red Foxx back to television, as a retired Atlanta mail
carrier, with Della Reese as his wife, whose daughter and three children move
in with them.;    "Teech," at 8:30 Wednesdays, stars Phil Lewis as a young,
black music teacher who is laid off from his job in Philadelphia and winds up
at an all-white boarding school.;    "Princesses," at 8 Fridays, stars Julie
Hagerty, Fran Drescher and Twiggy Lawson as three single women sharing a New
York penthouse through twists of fate that could happen only on television.
From Barry Kemp, creator of "Newhart.";    "Brooklyn Bridge," at 8:30 Fridays,
is about an extended family in Brooklyn in 1956, when the streets were safe
and doctors made house calls. From Gary David Goldberg of "Family Ties.";   
"Palace Guard," at 10 Fridays, stars D.W. Moffett, Marcy Walker, Tony Lo
Bianco and Noelle Parker in a Cannell show about a master hotel thief turned
security chief.;    "P.S. I Luv U," 10 Saturday, stars Connie Selleca as a con
artist and Greg Evigan as the police officer posing as her husband. Earl
Holliman is her boss.  </TEXT>

but the dwindling numbers of network viewers confirmed that the summer rerun
season has hit full stride.;    For the second consecutive week, ratings
released by the A.C. Nielsen Co. dropped to single digits. According to
figures released Tuesday, CBS finished first with a 9.6 average.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     ABC was a close second with 9.4. NBC, hampered by lackluster ratings for
its broadcasts of two National Basketball Association Conference finals games,
was third with a 9 average, failing to place any shows in the top 10.;    Each
ratings point represents 931,000 homes.;    ABC scored a hit with the final
episode of "thirtysomething." The network's recent cancellation announcement
helped make May 28's closing episode the No. 4 show on television last week.; 
  A rerun of ABC's comedy favorite "Roseanne" was the most watched program
last week, followed by a repeat of the network's "Coach" series.;    CBS's "60
Minutes," one of the few non-reruns in the top 10, finished third.;    The
back-to-back CBS Monday night comedies "Murphy Brown" and "Designing Women"
tied for fifth. ABC's "20-20" newsmagazine was seventh. CBS's reality drama
"Rescue 911" was eighth.;    ABC's Friday night hits "Family Matters" and
"Full House" finished ninth and 10th respectively.;    Tying for 10th place
was a rebroadcast of the pilot for "All in the Family," the classic CBS series
that debuted 20 years ago. Co-created by Norman Lear, "All in the Family" is
being reshown for six weeks alongside Lear's new program "Sunday Dinner.";   
The older series' pilot fared much better than the new program's opening
episode. "Sunday Dinner" tied for 20th place.;    In the network news ratings
battle, ABC won again, this time with an 8.6. CBS and Dan Rather were second
with 7.6. NBC and Tom Brokaw were third with 7.2.;    Here are the prime-time
television ratings as compiled by the A.C. Nielsen Co. for the week of May
27-June 2. The information provided shows rank, title, network and rating. The
top 20 listings also include the total homes in millions.;   1. "Roseanne"

Dean Hargrove doesn't seem to sweat. His sleeves are buttoned and his tie is 
invariably knotted neatly in place. His desk is serenely clear of clutter, his 
office accented with red poinsettia and French lithographs. 
</P>
<P>
He is soft-spoken, reticent, the picture of equanimity. 
</P>
<P>
But Dean Hargrove's profession is murder and mystery. Four times a week. Rain 
or shine. 
</P>
<P>
He is executive producer of "Matlock" on NBC, "Jake and the Fatman" on CBS, 
"Father Dowling Mysteries" on ABC and "Max Monroe: Loose Cannon" on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
The A.C. Nielsen Co. counting staff figures that Hargrove's shows had a 
combined viewing audience last week of between 120 million and 130 million 
people. 
</P>
<P>
And that doesn't include the 38 million who watched his fifth series last 
Sunday, the recurring "Perry Mason" adventures on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
What with people around like Aaron Spelling, Norman Lear, Stephen Cannell and 
others who are renowned for sheer television bulk, it's uncertain if Hargrove 
can claim a Guinness World Record as a creative writer-producer. But in 
observing him over several weeks in casting sessions, story conferences and 
assorted meetings trying to solve unsolvables, he seems to stretch human 
endurance. 
</P>
<P>
Life in television is life on the cutting edge of deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
One of the gags around his office -- like gallows humor -- is that if something 
is demanded four days or more from this moment, that's "an eternity." 
</P>
<P>
As of this week, Hargrove and his merry band had produced 51 episodes this 
season, had five more in production and had 17 scripts in various stages of 
writing, rewriting and pre-production. 
</P>
<P>
A status report on each series: 
</P>
<P>
"Perry Mason" is in its fifth season of three or four movies a year, with 
Raymond Burr in the not-unfamiliar role. A first cut of an episode shot in 
Paris before Christmas, to play in May, was just turned in. Another installment 
begins shooting Monday in Denver. And NBC just ordered six more movies. 
</P>
<P>
"Matlock," starring Andy Griffith in his fourth season as a country-folks 
lawyer, is shooting its 18th and 19th episodes (a two-parter) for the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Jake and the Fatman," with William Conrad and Joe Penny in their third season, 
is doing its 18th episode this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Father Dowling," which shoots in Denver, premiered Jan. 4 on ABC 
(matriculating from a short run on NBC), with Tom Bosley as the high-collared 
investigator and Tracy Nelson as Sister Steve. Episode 10 started Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Loose Cannon" opened on CBS Jan. 5, starring Shadoe Stevens as an L.A. cop who 
has perfected a style of reckless abandon. Episode 6 is being completed. But 
the series -- pummeled by the critics and disdained by viewers -- was pulled 
after Friday's episode and, Hargrove shrugged, "they (CBS) will bring us back 
in March in a different time period and we'll see." 
</P>
<P>
Hargrove takes a simple approach to pressure: "It's turning out scripts," he 
said. "I mean, I think producing a TV series is essentially producing scripts. 
Every eight days somebody's got their hand out for another script." 
</P>
<P>
He works on a series "until it finds its speed or own internal rhythms." Then 
the day-by-day duties are handled by the staff. 
</P>
<P>
But: "Well, there's always going to be problems -- most of which you can never 
anticipate. You deal with them and move on. I've had to make a couple of trips 
to Hawaii (where "Jake and the Fatman" is filmed) where I fly over, get off the 
plane, have meetings and get on the plane and fly back. 
</P>
<P>
"The only time I ever really feel the pressure is like starting these two new 
shows from a standing start. I have to put together a staff and I've got to put 
enough scripts together and I'm looking at those dates (deadlines)." 
</P>
<P>
His partners are Fred Silverman, who does the dealing for the team, and Viacom 
Inc., the entertainment conglomerate. It puts up the money. 
</P>
<P>
Silverman is a legend of the business with stints as programmer at all three 
major networks. His image has been Couch Potato Supreme -- one of the rare few 
TV executives who will "admit" that they watch TV and love it. 
</P>
<P>
He talked show details with Hargrove most every day until felled by a coronary 
in November. "Now I do a couple hours of work every other day," Silverman said 
from his Malibu beach house. "I hope very shortly to be back to a fairly normal 
schedule." 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledges that he and Hargrove are "an unlikely odd couple -- Dean is 
lower-key, kind of WASPish. I'm more volatile. He's from Kansas; I'm from New 
York. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
One of their producers said that they're most anxious to get a sitcom on the 
air because of all their murder shows. "We call them," he said, "the Beasts of 
Brentwood." 
</P>
<P>
Assessing "dailies" (each day's shooting) or episodes in varying stages of 
editing can be an exercise in anguish, since it essentially is a matter of 
assembling bits and pieces of the story so that it results in a reasonable 
logic. 
</P>
<P>
Hargrove sits behind his desk, visitors on the sofa. They all eyeball the TV 
set as the cassettes run. 
</P>
<P>
He told the producer and editors one day that the music was too thin in one 
"Loose Cannon" scene and too big in another. 
</P>
<P>
He froze the tape when NBC called. The network has this idea about opening 
"Matlock" next season with an episode in Japan, for the promotional value. NBC 
wanted his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Back to the tape. Producer David Solomon spotted graffiti on an alley wall that 
Max drives by: "Is that the Crips (the L.A. gang)?" Hargrove laughed: " 'Fraid 
they're gonna sue?" 
</P>
<P>
Hargrove looked at cryptic notes: This sequence he didn't believe. One action 
needed to be "punctuated more"; "this scene just lays there for me." 
</P>
<P>
In one "Loose Cannon" episode, Max is trying to trap a hit man and gets himself 
up in blackface as a cook with some sort of twisted dialect. Might have been an 
attempt at Pakistani. 
</P>
<P>
Solomon reported that "Shadoe wants more of that scene. How he got a cut of the 
show, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Hargrove: "He got a cut of this show?" 
</P>
<P>
Director Chris Hibler: "That shouldn't ever happen." 
</P>
<P>
Solomon: "It should never happen. But he did and called about changes in that 
scene." 
</P>
<P>
Hargrove: "We should find out how it he got it (the tape). I don't want to 
persecute him. Just make sure it doesn't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
Solomon: "I said, 'Where did you get it?' He said, 'I'm not talking.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hargrove shares a suite on the Universal Studios campus with Joel Steiger and 
Joyce Burditt, his key "Matlock" producers. On one of the walls in his office 
there's a monster photograph and autograph of Boris Karloff and a quaint 
picture of half of Alfred Hitchcock looking around a corner outside Studio 18. 
Through the window to the lot, you can see the caricature of Hitchcock's round 
cheeks against the screening theater bearing his name. 
</P>
<P>
With a shag of hair, with the smallest flecks of gray, Hargrove, 52, is 
laid-back, Midwestern proper. He looks trim. He noticed a paunch last August 
and now brings in an exercise pro three early-morning half-hours a week. 
Hargrove has lost 29 pounds, bought some new ensembles, and is holding. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't strike you as a funny guy but "I still see myself as a comedy writer 
basically" and "if there is a common trend in the shows, I would hope it would 
be a sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
He started off straight enough -- born in Iola, Kan., went to Wichita State 
(political science), UCLA film school, then jokes on the original "Bob Newhart 
Show." 
</P>
<P>
Other employments: "Man From U.N.C.L.E.," "Girl From U.N.C.L.E.," "It Takes a 
Thief," "Name of the Game" (Gene Barry's segments), "Columbo," "McCloud," 
"Madigan," "McCoy," "Holvak," "Me and Mom" and "Return to Mayberry." 
</P>
<P>
But it's hard to see the writer -- which is how Hargrove sees himself. He 
leaves few clues around. 
</P>
<P>
There's a typewriter covered in the corner, next to a computer, new and unused. 
"I never learned it," he said. (Secretary Ann Farina figures that he's afraid 
of the technology.) 
</P>
<P>
There are no shreds of old notes and misdirected scenes scattered around, sure 
signs that a writer has been there. 
</P>
<P>
Hargrove is all calm and composure. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Griffith calls him "the quiet man." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, the former actress Brenda Scott, who runs Fables, an antique store in 
Studio City, asserted that "it's taken me forever just to get him to do the 
minimum talking." 
</P>
<P>
In a craft given to frustrations and tantrums, where's the temper? 
</P>
<P>
One of his "bosses," Henry Schlieff, chairman and CEO, Viacom Broadcasting and 
Entertainment Groups, New York, marvels that Hargrove is "almost unique in that 
(Hollywood) environment," referring gingerly to "the diversity of personalities 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
The NBC executive on "Matlock," Charisse McGhee, director of drama programs, 
said that the extent of Hargrove's temper in disagreements with her are 
something like "Are you ever going to leave me alone on this?" 
</P>
<P>
Billy Campbell, director of current series at ABC and the contact on "Dowling," 
only recalled a single time when Hargrove raised his voice: "When he and I 
played basketball at his club one Sunday morning, because I didn't pass him the 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
Hargrove knew Gerry Conway as a writer with Marvel Comics and worked with him 
on a long-ago project. Conway came in to talk with Hargrove and was assigned to 
rewrite a script. He was sent "Loose Cannon" scripts. Then he came in to see 
the boss. 
</P>
<P>
"What we'd like to do is run it through your typewriter," Hargrove said. "And 
we should make it a little more urban, a little more contemporary. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The script came from Brian Clemens, a writer-producer of some special regard 
since he co-created "The Avengers," a most celebrated English series. He now 
works as executive story consultant via phones and faxes from his home in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
The plot is tricky -- the episode is called "Tricks" -- about a silent movie 
star whose nephew is immersed in the arms racket. Plus other complications. 
(Director Dan Attias instructed an actress during the audition for another key 
role, "She's an undercover FBI agent who's chasing a terrorist -- but she's got 
amnesia. So you don't really need to know that anyway. . . .") 
</P>
<P>
Hargrove said the basic structure of the scripts works well: "I don't think you 
have to do much in terms of plotting. At this point, we just wanted to get you 
to get a pass at it." 
</P>
<P>
Conway: "How about the humor?" 
</P>
<P>
Hargrove: "The humor in it should be a little more like the humor you read in 
the other scripts." 
</P>
<P>
Conway: "Seemed a little more distant." 
</P>
<P>
Hargrove: "Exactly. Brian is British and, you know, there's a slight idiomatic 
difference. I mean, he's terrific and he has some very nice things. As I say, 
this is not to make work. If you find parts of it in terms of dialogue you 
like, don't feel that you're obliged to do anything to it. But I'd like to get 
basically your fingerprint on it." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Conway's eventual rewrite was adjudged on the button and 
Hargrove promptly gave Conway a "Dowling" assignment. 
</P>
<P>
What makes for good television? "I don't know how to answer," Hargrove said. 
"That's always a matter of opinion. There are successful programs and there are 
good programs and sometimes they're the same programs. How often, that's the 
question." 
</P>
<P>
His shows are obviously popular but, if not critically attacked, "they're 
usually critically ignored. I'd say 'Matlock' has never been acclaimed, but I 
don't think it's ever been badly reviewed. 'Loose Cannon' got some bad 
reviews." 
</P>
<P>
The appeal is traditional-form, old-fashioned mainstream mystery. 
</P>
<P>
The stories are outlined in enormous detail before scripting: "Once we have the 
premise, the next thing that we want to know is the finish," he said. "Then you 
know how to get there. Say that we're constructing a 'Matlock' story. We work 
out the murder. We work out who the suspects are. And then we jump to the end 
and say, 'Well, what's the finish? What's the finish clue?' " 
</P>
<P>
The "Perry Masons" are especially by-the-book mysteries: "They have to be. It's 
a tradition. You now only have a society of people who pay a lot of attention 
to 'Perry Mason' but the Erle Stanley Gardner estate is very specific about 
maintaining those traditional elements. We send them copies of the scripts and 
the shows." 
</P>
<P>
The approach is taking a personality and designing the show for him, "because 
if we feel we can get the right character married to the right star then we 
have a chance of doing something that's going to be popular." 
</P>
<P>
Adjustments are made. "Jake and the Fatman," for example. 
</P>
<P>
"It's changed radically," he said. "It started out telling what we call open 
mysteries, where you saw the killers in advance. We tried to play it slightly 
film noirish. We used old standards for all the song titles, integrated them 
into the musical underscore for each episode. Then, when the show was renewed, 
part of the condition was that we take it to Hawaii. Then the show changed and 
became a much more straight-forward cop show." 
</P>
<P>
After a zillion shows, how does he keep from going back to the same old well 
for ideas? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I guess that's a question you can ask almost anybody who does a series. 
When you hit the 90th episode or beyond, you have to try not to get stale. What 
we try to do on 'Matlock' is to vary the format of the show, or bend it a 
little bit, do variations on the central them, so that we're not to hidebound 
that it becomes overly familiar to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good question. It's one that we ask ourselves quite a bit and I guess 
what happens is we get attracted to ideas that are off form simply because we 
want to avoid repeating ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Hargrove and his troops have had to throw out virtually completed 
episodes because they just couldn't make the twisted mystery work to any 
reasonable degree of logic. 
</P>
<P>
But despite his achievements in murder and mystery, he wants to do a comedy 
series: "At the moment, we're dealing with everything we've got. But at that 
point where we sit down to start doing some new development, which would 
probably be next year, that's certainly going to be part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever eventuates, in the world of TV programming, you never get too distant 
from humble. 
</P>
<P>
He had one lesson one day during an audition. One young man said it was good to 
see Hargrove again; Hargrove had hired him for his first TV acting job five 
years ago on a TV movie, "Goldie and the Bears." 
</P>
<P>
Hargrove paled, as if someone had kicked him in the gut: "Oh my god," he said, 
"that goes back." 
</P>
<P>
They exchanged niceties. The actor did well enough on his reading (but not well 
enough to get cast). When he left everybody wanted to know about "Goldie and 
the Bears." 
</P>
<P>
"I blocked it all out," Hargrove said. "Something you don't want to be reminded 
of. . . . It was Warner Bros. I got assigned to it." 
</P>
<P>
The plot: Three former Chicago Bears players and the detective daughter of 
their dead coach take on a hot case of spies and murderers. Starring Stephanie 
Faracy, Ben Davidson, Terry Hogan, Julius J. Carry III and Thomas Rhiner. 
</P>
<P>
Solomon wanted to see a cassette. 
</P>
<P>
Hargrove wanted to change the subject: "Nothing's available on that one."

"The Equalizer" and "Kate &amp; Allie" were canceled and "Beauty and the Beast" 
was relegated to backup status as CBS made room Friday for 7 1/2 hours of new 
prime-time programming for the 1989-90 TV season. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing them and such first-season fare as "Jesse Hawks," "Hard Time on 
Planet Earth," "Live-In" and "Heartland" will be three comedies, one 
reality-based series and five dramas, including one in which Richard 
Chamberlain, who achieved stardom on "Dr. Kildare" in the early 1960s, returns 
to series TV as a doctor.

CBS' other new shows are also peppered with former series stars, among them 
Lindsay Wagner, Tim Reid, Gerald McRaney, Jack Scalia and William Katt. 
</P>
<P>
Of 14 series that CBS introduced in the 1988-89 season, only the Candice Bergen 
comedy "Murphy Brown" and the family series "Paradise" were renewed for a 
second season. Among the casualties were "TV 101," "The Van Dyke Show," the 
Mary Tyler Moore vehicle "Annie McGuire," "Dirty Dancing," "Close to Home," 
"Almost Grown" and "Coming of Age." Also being dropped come fall is the Tuesday 
night movie slot. 
</P>
<P>
Kim LeMasters, president of CBS Entertainment, said that declining ratings had 
necessitated the cancellation of the four-year-old "Equalizer" series, but he 
emphasized that the network has not abandoned the two-year-old "Beauty and the 
Beast," whose ratings also dropped this season. Twelve episodes have been 
ordered, he said, but they will not begin in the fall because the fantasy drama 
is going to undergo creative revamping. 
</P>
<P>
In a satellite press conference from New York, LeMasters said that "Beauty and 
the Beast" had suffered more damage from last summer's Writers Guild of America 
strike than many other shows because its literate scripts required extra 
writing time. It was dealt another blow by the Teamsters strike, he said, which 
forced writers to keep most of the action cloistered in the underground world 
that the Beast inhabits because that was "literally the only standing set" and 
new ones could not be built. 
</P>
<P>
Also being revamped, but on the fall schedule nonetheless, will be CBS' 
low-rated news magazine "West 57th," now to be anchored by Connie Chung 
following her well-publicized defection from NBC in February. LeMasters said 
the series' tentative new title is "West 57th With Connie Chung." 
</P>
<P>
CBS' other prime-time news hours, "60 Minutes" and "48 Hours," also will return 
in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
The fall schedule features an all-comedy night on Monday, with three new shows 
-- "Major Dad," "The People Next Door" and "The Famous Teddy Z" -- interspersed 
with the network's successful comedies of last year, "Murphy Brown," "Designing 
Women" and "Newhart." 
</P>
<P>
The lineup also will introduce an all-new Tuesday night, with the reality-based 
show "Rescue 911," featuring real-life acts of heroism by firefighters, 
paramedics and other emergency workers, hosted by William Shatner, followed by 
the hour drama "Wolf," a private eye show set in San Francisco and starring 
Jack Scalia, and "The Hawaiian," which sets miniseries king Chamberlain ("The 
Thorn Birds," "Shogun") loose on "Magnum, P.I." turf as a doctor at a large 
metropolitan hospital in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Here are descriptions of the other new CBS series: 
</P>
<P>
"Major Dad": Stars Gerald McRaney (of "Simon and Simon") and Shanna Reed in a 
comedy about a peacetime marine adjusting to life on a stateside base, as well 
as entering into a new marriage with a newspaper reporter and becoming father 
to her three daughters. 
</P>
<P>
"The People Next Door": Stars Jeffrey Jones, Mary Gross, Jaclyn Bernstein, 
Chance Quinn and Christina Pickels in a fantasy-comedy about a cartoonist with 
a new psychologist wife and two children whose imaginary characters magically 
spring to life. 
</P>
<P>
"The Famous Teddy Z": Features Jon Cryer ("Pretty in Pink") as young Teddy 
Zakalokis, a kid from the mail room of Unlimited Talent Agency who 
inadvertently becomes the agent for the "greatest actor in the world." The show 
co-stars Alex Rocco, Milton Selzer, Jane Sibbett, Tom La Grua and Josh Blake. 
Lainie Kazan had been cast as Teddy's mother, but she left the show because of 
creative differences with the producers; the role is being rewritten as Teddy's 
grandmother and will be played by Erica Yohn. 
</P>
<P>
"A Peaceable Kingdom": A family drama starring Lindsay Wagner "The Bionic 
Woman," "Jessie") as Rebecca Cafferty, the managing director of a large 
metropolitan zoo, trying to juggle job duties with raising her young children. 
Tom Wopat stars as Dr. Jed McFadden, a curator with a romantic interest in 
Rebecca. 
</P>
<P>
"Top of the Hill": A drama involving the adventures of a 29-year-old surfer and 
outdoorsman who is the "newest, youngest and most unlikely" member of 
Congress." William Katt ("The Greatest American Hero") stars. 
</P>
<P>
"Snoops": "Frank's Place" duo Tim and Daphne Maxwell Reid star in a mystery 
drama as Chance and Micki Dennis, a Washington, D.C.-based criminology

<HEAD>Writer Dean Hargrove Has Two New Series</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's an accomplishment when a writer can get
even one television series going, but Dean Hargrove has two hits on
the air and next week launches two more shows.
   ``Father Dowling Mysteries,'' previously on NBC, makes its debut
on ABC next Thursday. ``Max Monroe: Loose Cannon'' premieres on CBS
on Friday.
   Hargrove also created NBC's ``Matlock'' and CBS' ``Jake and the
Fatman.'' Earlier, he also developed the very successful series of
``Perry Mason'' movies for NBC. His frequent collaborator is Joel
Steiger.
   ``Everybody has a theory about why a show is successful,'' said
Hargrove. ``I think the audience basically is attracted by
characters, and when you have that perfect wedding of character and
performer you have a success.
   ``Most successful TV series are identified by a name: Lucy,
Archie Bunker, Columbo, J.R. Even with shows like `thirtysomething'
or `L.A. Law,' I think people tune in for the characters.
Basically, I tailor shows for the stars, like Andy Griffith, Bill
Conrad and Tom Bosley.''
   ``Loose Cannon'' stars Shadoe Stevens as Max Monroe, a police
detective whose wild and unconventional tactics have earned him the
nickname of Loose Cannon. Stevens is a rock 'n' roll disc jockey
who is host of ``American Top 40'' and a panelist on ``Hollywood
Squares.''
   ``It's a new kind of show for us,'' said Hargrove, whose partner
is Fred Silverman, former president of NBC and former head of
programming at CBS and ABC. ``The series we've done so far have
been traditional, middle of the road series.
   ``Working with Shadoe gives us an opportunity to design a show
that's offbeat and contemporary. It has a strong vein of humor. I
think almost all successful shows have had humor. I got my start as
a comedy writer and I still think of myself as a comedy writer.''
   ``Father Dowling'' stars Tom Bosley and Tracy Nelson as two
ecclesiastical snoops. He's the good father, Frank Dowling, and
she's Sister Steve. Father Dowling is always running afoul of
church hierarchy in the person of James Stephens as Father
Prestwick, the bishop's aide. The show's set in Chicago, but like
``Perry Mason,'' it's filmed in Denver.
   The next ``Perry Mason'' movie, however, has been filmed in
Paris. It's the 14th in the series since Silverman sold the project
to NBC.
   ``Fred talked to Raymond Burr, got the rights and got NBC
interested,'' Hargrove said. ``He asked me to write the script. We
thought it would be a good idea to bring in a younger character, so
we cast William Katt as Mason's investigator.
   ``My notion was to put a detective story in the middle of `Perry
Mason.' The detective gets an assignment early and goes off to
pursue it. Perry Mason carries on his mystery-solving, and the
detective works on solving another element of the case. Katt has
left, but we use the same technique with Bill Moses.''
   In the show set in Paris, Mason defends an American Marine
officer in a court-martial.
   Hargrove grew up in Iowa and began writing student films while
in college. He attended the UCLA Film School as a graduate student,
but dropped out to write professionally.
   His first job was writing for ``The Bob Newhart Show,''
Newhart's first series on NBC in 1961-63.
   ``Newhart was the button-down mind just out of Chicago,'' he
said. ``We wrote a lot of telephone routines for him. Roland Kibbe
hired me and we later worked together on `Columbo' and `Madigan.' I
also wrote for `The Man From U.N.C.L.E.' because they wanted to
bring a sense of humor to the show.''
   Hargrove wrote the pilot for ``The Girl From U.N.C.L.E'' and was
story consultant for ``It Takes a Thief.'' He wrote and produced
Gene Barry's segments on ``Name of the Game.'' He was also producer
and writer for such series as ``Columbo,'' ``Madigan,''
``McCloud,'' ``McCoy,'' ``The Family Holvak'' and ``Me and Mom.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   TRUE STORY _ NBC's ``Midnight Caller'' will look at the effects
of the Oct. 17 Northern California earthquake in a special episode
for Tuesday, Jan. 2. The cast and crew, which experienced the
earthquake while working in San Francisco, does an episode called
``Based on a True Story.'' Guest stars John Beck and Sydney Walsh
play producers trying to film a TV movie about the earthquake, as
seen from the perspective of radio personality Jack Killian, played
by Gary Cole.

   Who's News:
   Tinker Gets Serious With a New TV Drama

   CULVER CITY, Calif. -- Grant Tinker's latest show, "WIOU,"
is a one-hour drama about a struggling Midwest TV station
that just can't seem to get anything right.
   The same might have been said about Grant Tinker Gannett,
or GTG Entertainment, the ill-fated joint venture between the
former chairman of the National Broadcasting Co. and Gannett
Co. That three-year partnership was terminated last March
after a series of programming failures, including a costly
syndicated version of the Gannett-owned national newspaper
USA Today, and prime-time series such as "TV 101" and
"Raising Miranda" for CBS and "Baywatch" for NBC. The shows
weren't liked by critics or viewers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now, like the fictional TV station that will be depicted
in "WIOU" for CBS Inc.'s network, Mr. Tinker is poised to
begin again, this time without a company handing him a blank
check. He has yet to find another financial partner despite
hiring the investment-banking firm of Furman Selz Mager Dietz
&amp; Birney in January. New backers may well be leery; Gannett
spent more than $40 million in prime-time production costs,
more than another $45 million on "USA Today on TV," $24
million to buy the Culver City studios for the venture and
another $25 million in renovations.
   Mr. Tinker insists the need for a new backer "is not that
urgent," and "we're not as desperate as you might think." The
production of "WIOU," which will premiere this fall, is being
financed by Orion Television Entertainment, a unit of Orion
Pictures Corp. "Orion's development season didn't work as
well as they might have hoped, so they're a willing partner,"
says Mr. Tinker. Orion has three series on the 1990-91
network prime-time schedule; the other two are "Lifestories"
on NBC and "Equal Justice" on ABC.
   Nevertheless, Mr. Tinker's difficulty in jump-starting his
career as a supplier of TV shows underscores the fickle
nature of the broadcasting business. While he was chairman of
NBC in the early 1980s, Mr. Tinker turned around the
third-place network, focusing on high-quality shows such as
"Cheers" and "Hill Street Blues." Before joining NBC, Mr.
Tinker had built one of the most respected small programming
suppliers, MTM Entertainment, which produced "The Mary Tyler
Moore Show" and "The Bob Newhart Show."
   With such past successes under his belt, Mr. Tinker seemed
like a sure bet for Gannett, which had been anxious to enter
the television-production business. But three of Mr. Tinker's
first offerings never made it past their initial production
orders from CBS, and NBC canceled "Baywatch" after one
season. Other projects, including a situation comedy about
two bakers and another about an alien visiting Earth, didn't
make it past the pilots.
   In part, Mr. Tinker appears to be a victim of changing
tastes and expectations among viewers, who have come to
expect the unexpected, whether it's the oddball nature of
"Twin Peaks," or the off-kilter animated family, "The
Simpsons." So, Mr. Tinker is eschewing his trademark
touchy-feely situation comedies, and betting instead on a
hard-edged office drama, the first project of the new GTG --
which no longer stands for Grant Tinker Gannett, but now
conveniently stands for Grant Tinker Group. Notes Mr. Tinker,
"It saves on new stationery and business cards."
   Mr. Tinker, 64 years old and looking fit, trim and
relaxed, says he doesn't quite understand all the attention
placed on his start-up attempts. "You get tired of people
taking hits on you for things that didn't work," he says
evenly. "Sure, I'm disappointed the Gannett venture turned
out as it did. It was a disappointment. But it takes a while
to get up to speed."
   Other network bosses have tried to make the transition
into programming with mixed results, and success often takes
years. Fred Silverman, Mr. Tinker's predecessor at NBC,
failed as an independent producer for four years in the early
1980's, but finally struck pay dirt with a
made-for-television film based on the vintage TV character
Perry Mason. He is now one of the most successful independent
producers for television with four one-hour dramas,
"Matlock," "Heat of the Night," "Father Dowling Mysteries"
and "Jake and the Fatman," spread over the three major
broadcast networks. He also has an animated series, "The
Pigsburg Pigs," for News Corp.'s Fox Broadcasting Co.'s
Saturday morning lineup this fall.
   "Grant Tinker has nothing to prove to anybody," says Mr.
Silverman. "I had huge flops when I first started." He cited
as examples "Thicke of the Night," a syndicated talk show
with Alan Thicke that disappeared shortly after its premiere,
and a situation comedy, "We Got It Made." "That failed
twice," he says. "Once on network, once in syndication. In
television production, you can be a hero one day and a bum
the next day."
   But Mr. Tinker's snail's pace surprises even some
supporters. "I would have expected more Grant Tinker shows on
the air by now," says Warren Littlefield, president of NBC
Entertainment. "Grant's the first to admit he's made
mistakes, and he's certainly someone I'd bet on for future
success."
   Mr. Tinker has hired some younger executives, notably the
creators of "WIOU," Kathryn Pratt, 38, and John Eisendrath,
31, both novices to prime-time television. Both, however, are
veterans of TV newsrooms, having worked at WBBM, the
CBS-owned station in Chicago, where Ms. Pratt was an on-air
health reporter and Mr. Eisendrath was a writer-producer.
They joined GTG and worked as story editors on "TV 101,"
which depicted a high school TV-production class.
   "They're writing about what they know about," says Mr.
Tinker. "We're going back to what we did at MTM. We always
believed in letting writers do what they want to do."
   Initial reaction to "WIOU" is positive. Tom Shales, the
Washington Post's influential TV critic, wrote that the show
"is certain to restore luster to" Mr. Tinker. He described
"WIOU" as a "high-gloss, quality show with a fresh, flashy
cast . . . a snappy, crackling, richly entertaining hour in
the tradition of `L.A. Law.'"
   Mr. Tinker is creating and producing "WIOU" even though,
he says, "doing dramatic shows for TV isn't much of a
business right now." One-hour dramas aren't selling well in
the syndicated market, as opposed to half-hour comedies. It
is in syndication where production companies make their
money. Studios sell their shows to networks for less money
than it costs to produce them in the hopes of making a
financial killing in syndication.
   Sitting with his feet up on a coffee table, shoes off
revealing pale pink socks, Mr. Tinker says, "You know, it's
funny. At MTM, we had four, five shows going at once. Here,
we have only one." But he adds, "that's how I want it now.
Slowly start over. First get one on the air and have it
stick, then another, and then another. We'll be fine."

<LEADPARA>  CBS'S "Dallas" finale was the No. 2 show on television, but NBC was the No. 1
network in the latest weekly ratings battle.;    The two-hour episode that
ended the 13-year "Dallas" run gave the Texas Ewing clan its best rating since
1987. NBC, aided by back-to-back first-place finishes for its "Switched at
Birth" miniseries, won the overall network race, with a 13.5 average rating.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Figures released Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. showed CBS in second
place, with an overall network average of 12. ABC was third, with 10.8.;   
Part 2 of "Switched at Birth" was the most-watched show on television last
week. Part 1 of the NBC miniseries finished first in the previous ratings
period.;    CBS's "60 Minutes," which usually hovers near the No. 1 spot, fell
to No. 6.;    Some spring replacement series continued to do well against
traditional hit series:;    ABC's "Dinosaurs," about life in the prehistoric
suburbs, tied with NBC's three-year-old "In the Heat of the Night" for 17th
place, and NBC's "Seinfeld" finished in a two-way tie with network favorite
"The Golden Girls" for 11th place.;    ABC and Peter Jennings won again in the
network news race, this time with a 9.8 average rating. NBC and Tom Brokaw
were second with 8.2. CBS and Dan Rather were last with 7.9.;    Here are the

<TEXT>     Each rating point represents 931,000 homes.;    A repeat of CBS's "60
Minutes" was the No. 1 show on television. ABC's "20-20" placed second, and in
the No. 3 slot was a rerun of NBC's favorite barroom comedy "Cheers.";    An
encore presentation of NBC's docudrama movie "A Cry for Help: The Tracey
Thurman Story," which portrayed the real-life trauma of a Connecticut woman
left paralyzed by her abusive husband, ranked fourth.;    NBC's reality-based
series "Unsolved Mysteries" was fifth. CBS's original presentation of Stephen
King's "Golden Years" mini-series tied for sixth place with a rerun of ABC's
blue-collar, wisecracking family on "Roseanne.";    The premiere of ABC's
high-concept comedy series "Hi Honey, I'm Home" (which also plays on cable's
Nick at Nite channel) ranked 13th.;    In the network news wars, ABC continued
its winning streak, this time with a 9 rating. NBC was second with 7.5. CBS
was third with 7.4.;    Here are the prime-time ratings as compiled by the
A.C. Nielsen Co. for July 15-21. The information provided shows rank, title,

   Our star, recently turned 50, is waking up,
smelling the coffee, and starting to give up that infatuation with
young love. But memories linger...
   Sound like the plot for a TV movie?
   It's actually the plot for television itself, advertising and TV
executives say, as shows like ``The Golden Girls'' draw big
audiences and stars like Bob Newhart, Andy Griffith, Angela
Lansbury and Carroll O'Connor shine.
   ``The audience is getting older,'' said David Poltrack, CBS
senior vice president for planning and research. ``The major
population shift is the aging of the baby boomers. When they were
young television was very youth-oriented.
   ``Gradually, the television networks are recognizing that the
advantage is to go with this aging baby boomer generation.''
   Johnny Carson, at 64, is still the most popular talk show host.
And when CBS' ``Lonesome Dove'' bowled over the competition last
spring with aging Texas plainsmen Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee
Jones, ``Perry Mason'' took the case and saved NBC from disaster.
The Raymond Burr role appeals mainly to older viewers.
   While the population is aging and older people have more
disposable income, advertisers are slow to recognize the changes.
   ``We don't go as far as CBS would like us to go,'' said Betsy
Frank, a vice president of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the world's largest
ad agency. ``CBS has always been more successful when it programs
for a more mature audience. Even ABC is making some concessions
toward older audiences. Its `ABC Mystery Movie' has older stars and
should do well with older viewers on Saturday night. But Fox
Broadcasting has succeeded by targeting a very young audience.''
   Nonetheless, Frank sees a shift to buying demographics of age
25-54.
   Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment, agrees the
audience is aging and has more money, ``but you also have to look
at consumer habits.
   ``Is the person who is 61 years old who's bought Maxwell House
Coffee for 40 years really a good target for your new Vienna Roast?
I recognize that they have more income but I would be careful about
their buying habits.
   ``Our standard approach is to come up with a good show that has
as widespread an appeal as possible. `Golden Girls' is a show that
recognizes the graying of America but it's universal in its appeal.
It attracts teen-agers and young people as well. It defies
advertisers who thought it would be a show that would appeal to
only people over 50.''
   Tartikoff believes older viewers will be more of a factor in the
1990s.
   ``The phenomenon of shows about older people is quite new to
television,'' said Michael Dann, a consultant who formerly headed
programming at CBS and NBC. ``We always had older people in family
shows, but the shows were always about kids and their problems.
What you have now are shows built around the problems that older
people face. The remarkable thing about `The Golden Girls' is that
its audience cuts through all age groups. One show is a hit, two is
a trend. You clearly have that taking place today.''
   The problems older characters face aren't geriatric. They're the
usual mix of romance, sex, appearance, divorce, and the conflicts
of human nature.
   Although favorable demographics is still the preferred method of
advertiser selection, audience size is important and becoming more
so, Dann said. ``Years ago I personally canceled Jackie Gleason
with a 37 share and Red Skelton with a 36 share. You won't find a
television executive doing that today.
   ``Things are so competitive today with new delivery systems and
a fourth network that it's difficult to get a large rating for a
new show. I don't know of anybody today who would cancel a show
with a 30 share.''
   Poltrack said Fred Silverman has become adept at producing hit
shows that appeal to older viewers. ``In the Heat of the Night,''
``Matlock,'' ``Jake and the Fatman,'' and the ``Perry Mason''
movies all have older stars. ``The Father Dowling Mysteries'' was
dropped by NBC but has been picked up by ABC.
   In the new season, CBS' ``Island Son,'' ``Snoops,'' ``Wolf,''
``Major Dad'' and ``Peaceable Kingdom'' are aimed at older viewers.
So are ABC's ``Chicken Soup'' and NBC's ``The Nutt House,''
``Hardball'' and ``Mancuso FBI.''
   Movies and miniseries also lean heavily toward the older
audience.
   ``The networks are sticking with stars and shows that have
worked in the past,'' said Frank. ``It's not that we're seeing the
graying of television. What we're seeing is each network
concentrate more on the things they do best. Because older viewers
do watch more television, you may be seeing more older stars that
appeal to that audience.''
   Poltrack contends that the network trend toward more news and
reality shows is based on more than just the fact that such shows
are less expensive.
   ``When people pass 40 they become more interested in news and
information-based shows. The networks are losing audience to
competitors but the news and information shows are stable. You'll
see more of these shows in the 1990s.''
   A dissenter is Paul Schulman, media buyer for 14 big companies
representing $175 million in network ads. ``I think `The Golden
Girls' was a phenomenon in itself and all the imitations will bite
the dust quickly. When you buy time on shows that appeal to older
people you pay for an enormous waste of circulation. ``Young people
are still the key to high prices on a network. The most expensive
show on TV today is `Cheers' because of its enormous appeal to the
18-49 audience. `The Cosby Show' has a higher rating, but it
attracts a large number of kids. The aim of every network
programmer is to get another `Cheers' or `Roseanne.' At CBS,
`Wiseguy' doesn't get a big rating but that's the show all the
advertisers ask for because of its young demographics.''
