FT  20 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Kissing
goodbye to a Christmas tradition - The problems of British apple growers are
hitting supplies of home-grown mistletoe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Will the kissing have to stop? And if it does, will this be the result of a
machiavellian plot hatched by the European Union? Moreover, if every
red-blooded Brit observed rules established over generations might the
practice already be dying out? Not because of a punitive quota but simply
because of market forces.
I refer of course to the possibility of a crisis in the mistletoe business
and to the tradition that dictates one berry should be removed from each
sprig of the foliage for each kiss that takes place beneath it.
Fortunately such rules are regularly ignored and the season of goodwill
usually permits pursed lips to press against one another, according to
custom, an unlimited number of times without berries being removed. Which is
just as well, because were that not the case, I would be looking forward to
a very dull Christmas.
In the absence of any of the parasitic plants on our own apple trees, the
other day my wife bought a small sprig of mistletoe in our local Norfolk
town. It weighed between three and four ounces, complete with a dozen or so
berries, and it cost her Pounds 1. Indeed, she refused to buy any more at
such an extortionate price. Perhaps she was also trying to tell me
something.
But I had already established that at auction in Tenbury in Worcestershire
(or 'the orchard', as Queen Victoria is said to have dubbed the town), the
price was about 75p a pound last week. Somebody in the supply chain, which
admittedly stretches from the West Midlands to East Anglia seems to be
making a pretty good margin.
Because of the association of mistletoe with apple trees it can only get
dearer in the future.
Although it will grow on poplar and occasionally on oak trees, its favourite
'host' is the apple. It establishes itself on the trees as a result of the
beak-cleaning activities of songbirds, especially mistle thrushes. Having
fed in mistletoe berries (which are poisonous to some species) the birds
apparently, get seeds stuck in the crevices of their beaks  - like grape
pips between our teeth. Not having tooth picks readily to hand, the birds
scrape the seeds out of their beaks on to the rough bark of apple trees and
'plant' them where they grow. Mistletoe derives its nourishment from the sap
of the trees.
UK apple growers have had a rough time in recent years as fruit from other
countries has displaced indigenous varieties. French Golden Delicious have
been a particular problem, although one British apple grower suggested the
French should be hauled up before the courts under the Trades Description
Act for naming the variety delicious. They come in during our own season
and, being a very high yielding variety, cost much less to grow than best
British apples such as Cox.
The disappearance of almost half of Britain's apple trees since the country
joined the Common Market in 1973, is not the only cause of the mistletoe
shortage; nor will the grant-aided grubbing out of a further 13 per cent of
British orchards, as a result of a recent EU scheme to cut community
production and attempt to raise the price of apples to economic levels,
necessarily affect future supplies of mistletoe.
For the EU rules state that the apple orchards to be grubbed must be
composed of young trees, not more than 20 years old and capable of bearing a
full crop of fruit. They must also be planted at a density of not more than
160 trees an acre. In other words, the orchards that will go will be modern,
hedge-type plantings enabling easy picking from the ground.
But parasitic mistletoe is only allowed to grow on big old trees in
traditional orchards. Fifty-year-old or more cider and cooking apple trees
are much the best  - the ones not covered by the EU scheme. One of the
reasons for this is that most of those trees are uneconomic for fruit
production, on their last legs and almost ready to fall down in any case.
Many are only retained to provide shelter for sheep flocks that graze the
orchards and for the side-line cutting of mistletoe.
It may be, therefore, as these old trees disappear, that in future years,
sales of traditional winter greenery held at Tenbury market on the four
Tuesdays before Christmas each year will have fewer bunches of local
mistletoe mixed among the holly and Christmas trees. Indeed these annual
auctions have already begun to attract entries from northern France where
mistletoe is plentiful especially on the ubiquitous poplars.
But disparaging locals say the French stuff is not as good. For a start it
is usually a different, less attractive variety. But worse than this is the
way it is presented: dehydrated and squashed following the long journey
across the channel.
The French, you see, have no real appreciation of the plant nor of any
tradition of kissing under the mistletoe in spite of their racy reputation.
Only the British have revered mistletoe from the time of the ancient Druids
and today its magical and licentious powers are exclusively enjoyed in the
English-speaking world.
And when you think of it, kissing in France is only a series of ritual pecks
on the cheek  - perhaps because of the preponderence of garlic in the diet.
The British are the deliverers and recipients of full frontal smackers and
long may there be sufficient English mistletoe around to enable and enhance
that excellent Christmas tradition.

<TEXT>     Around here, it's everywhere, growing wild and fast and furious in fat
little clumps, hanging from bare branches of the mesquite, elm and water oaks
like ornaments on a Christmas tree.;   "We have gone out and collected
mistletoe for years and years and years," Seider said. "My parents did it. My
mother-in-law did it. My wife does it.";   And now his son, Ashley, 14, is out
climbing trees on weekends trying to yank down the mistletoe.;   Mistletoe --
an evergreen with thick leaves and clusters of tiny white berries -- has long
had its lure. Ancient priests once handed out sprigs as good-luck charms, and
people hung it over their doors to ward off evil.;   In Scandinavian
mythology, mistletoe was associated with the goddess of love. Some think that
is the root of the romantic Christmas custom: kissing under the mistletoe.;  
Tradition has it that a person caught standing under the mistletoe must
forfeit a kiss. The kisses must equal the number of white berries.;   Nobody
around here pays much mind to that tradition -- probably because it's so
difficult not to stand under mistletoe.;   Today, much of the fresh mistletoe
bought and sold at Christmas comes out of trees within 100 miles of Priddy,
population 75. (They're sure about that number because somebody drove up the
street once and counted everybody.);   In a red-brick warehouse along Priddy's
main street, the smell of mistletoe is in the air. Leftovers are on the floor
of Tiemann's Holiday Mistletoe Co. Trash bins are filling with mistletoe that
didn't quite make the grade. (Not green enough or too few white berries.);  
People of old may have thought mistletoe was magical because the plant grows
high up in the tree without touching the ground, fueling beliefs that
mistletoe was "heaven-sent.";   Texans, however, know better.;   The mistletoe
is in the tree because it is eating dinner there.;   "It is a parasite. It has
roots that grow down into the wood and they actually feed on the tree. If it
gets bad enough, it will kill the tree," said Jerral Johnson, a plant
pathologist at Texas A&amp;M University. "We get a lot of calls from people who
want to get rid of it.";   But that's hard to do. Scientists have yet to
develop herbicides that kill mistletoe without killing the tree. So once it
takes root in the tree, like an unwelcome holiday guest, it's hard to get rid
of.;   "I don't care much for mistletoe myself," Seider said. "But it sure
comes in handy at Christmastime."; Facts and myth; (box) Semiparasitic
evergreen plant -- North American variety is Phoradendron serotinum -- that
attaches itself to trees, then taps through bark to draw out nutrients.; (box)
Berries are poisonous to humans and most animals but not birds.; (box) In
North America, it is found mainly on deciduous trees.; (box) State flower of
Oklahoma.; (box) In Norse mythology, mistletoe killed Balder, the god of
beauty, goodness and light. All living things had sworn an oath not to harm
him, and because of that, the gods would throw things at Balder with seeming
impunity. But the god Loki, who was jealous of Balder, found out that
mistletoe alone hadn't sworn the oath. Loki made a mistletoe dart and guided
the blind god Hoder's hand as he threw it. The dart killed Balder instantly.;

HOW TO HAVE YOURSELF A MERRIAM-WEBSTER'S LITTLE CHRISTMAS

THE LANGUAGE of Christmas has hardly changed since Chaucer's time. That's 
because the essence of this holiday is tradition and change is resisted. We 
have carols and wassail and Christmas trees and the exchange of gifts, and 
nobody wants it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
Now and then we see a pink Christmas tree, and it is probably plastic, but such 
trifling innovations don't change the spirit of the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
According to Merriam-Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, the words 
Christmas, yule, wreath, mistletoe, holiday, holly and angels date from before 
the 12th Century. Carol, Xmas and wassail are also many centuries old. 
</P>
<P>
The word Christmas itself comes from the Old English word Christes maesse, 
which literally means Christ's Mass, and it is celebrated throughout the 
Christian world on Dec. 25. 
</P>
<P>
During the first few centuries of the church, however, it was celebrated on 
various days in January, April, May, September and October, because the early 
theologians disagreed on Christ's birth date. Finally, in AD 340, the Pope 
settled on Dec. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Webster's sets to rest a common misconception about the word Xmas, which is 
often thought of as a sort of sacrilegious, modern, shortcut slang word for 
Christmas. Not so. 
</P>
<P>
The word Xmas has perfectly good credentials. The X in Xmas is a symbol for 
Christ from the Greek letter chi, the first letter of Christos. A chi looks 
much like our X, and the word Xmas has been in use since 1551. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, it still looks like slang to me. 
</P>
<P>
Yule, another word that means Christmas, also dates from before the 12th 
Century and is related to the Old Norse word jol, which originally meant a 
pagan winter feast. Yuletide first appeared in English during the 15th Century. 
</P>
<P>
To "troll the ancient yuletide carols" is a tradition that dates to the singing 
of the "heavenly host" of angels on the first Christmas day: "Glory to God in 
the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men." 
</P>
<P>
Carol comes from the late Latin choraula, meaning choral song; it dates in 
English from the 14th Century. Troll means to sing, and comes from the 15th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
To go a-wassailing is to sing carols from house to house. Originally wassail 
was an Old Norse toast -- ves heill, meaning "be well." From that term came the 
name of the cheerful holiday concoction made of wine, beer, cider, spices and 
sugar. 
</P>
<P>
Few words have been added to the Christmas lexicon in recent centuries, but 
Scrooge -- a name we get from the born-again miser of Charles Dickens' beloved 
story, "A Christmas Carol" -- is an exception. 
</P>
<P>
Even more recently, the word grinch has become popular. A grinch is 
anill-tempered cynic invented by Dr. Seuss in his children's book, "The Grinch 
Who Stole Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Decking the halls with leaves of holly originated among the ancient converted 
Danes. They believed that holly was used for the crown of thorns at the 
Crucifixion, and that the red berries represented drops of blood. 
</P>
<P>
The use of mistletoe goes back to the pagan Druids. It is a parasite that grows 
on apple and oak trees. Druid priests made a solemn rite of collecting it from 
oak trees. People paid them for pieces of the plant, believing that it kept 
witches away. 
</P>
<P>
The present notion that strangers may kiss under its aura is much more benign. 
(If the Druids were right, one is not in danger of kissing a witch.) 
</P>
<P>
As for Santa Claus, that name is a corruption (through the Dutch Sinter Claes) 
of Saint Nicholas, a 4th-Century bishop of Myra, in ancient Lycia (Turkey), who 
was much beloved of children and sailors for his alleged miracles in their 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
How this hazy figure became the jolly fat man who drives reindeer through the 
sky, squeezes down chimneys and leaves toys for children in millions of homes 
at Christmas is beyond my learning. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, I don't believe in him, and I don't think parents should con their 
children into believing in him, either. 
</P>
<P>
Children with normal intelligence will soon figure out that the old fellow is a 
fraud, and they will never trust their parents again. 
</P>
<P>
This breach of faith at an age when children are entirely dependent on the 
parents for their perception of truth and reality can never be mended. 
</P>

   The Holidays are here, the Holidays are there,
the Holidays are, in fact, nearly everywhere.
   America must love its holidays, at least judging by the files of
the federal government, since the nation has no fewer than 110
places called Holiday.
   From Holiday Hills, Ark., to Holiday Acres, Del., and from
Holiday Shores, Mo., to Holiday Resort, Tenn., these festive
appellations sprinkle the land.
   And that's not all. A look at the U.S. Geological Survey's
Geographic Names Information System shows 89 Christmases across the
country, along with seven places called Santa Claus, three Yules
(all in Colorado) and even one poinsettia _ Poinsettia Park in Polk
County, Fla.
   The U.S.G.S. names information system, which has collected more
than 2 million names of places and geographic features for use in
federal mapping and data programs, shows Texas is tops in Christmas
country with 10 places using that name, while there are three
Christmases in Florida and seven each in Arizona and California.
   There's Christmas Knob in Oneida County, N.Y., and Christmas
Cove in Maine; Christmas Camp Lake in Louisiana and Christmas
Landing in Alabama.
   Presiding over Christmas are the seven Santa Clauses, including
the community of Santa Claus in Toombs County, Ga.
   Others include Santa Claus churches in Alaska and Indiana;
locations called Santa Claus in Arizona, Indiana and Minnesota;
Santa Claus Spring in Nevada and Santa Claus Rock in Utah.
   For the decorative, there are 542 spots nationwide called holly,
more than enough to decorate the lone wreath: Wreath Hill in
Campbell County, Wyo.
   Folks more inclined to snuggle up and kiss on the holidays can
find ample comfort in a dozen Mistletoes.
   Mistletoe Mine in Nevada might be a good spot, since it's no
longer active; or perhaps Mistletoe State Park in Columbia County,
Ga.
   They could walk Mistletoe Trail in Maryland, study their skills
at Mistletoe School in Shasta County, Calif., drift across
Mistletoe Lake, Minn., and perhaps even end their days at Mistletoe
Cemetery in Goliad County, Texas.
   If festive song is desired, some 30 Noels mark this land from
Noel Bay, S.C., to Noel Creek, Mont.; Noel, Colo., and even Noel
Ditch in Seneca County, Ohio.
   Looking for a white Christmas? Perhaps it can be found at the
nation's 563 ``snow'' place names.
   There's Snow Hill, Conn., where a white Christmas is likely, and
Snow Brake in Tallahatchie County, Miss., where the chance is
smaller. Others include Snow Lake, Neb., Snow Pond, N.H.; Snow
School in North Dakota and Snow Cemetery in Windham County, Vt.
   And just to round up the seasonal decorations with a traditional
Christmas Tree, the nation's place names include 5,073 spots with
``pine'' in their names, as well as 98 ``spruces,'' 735 ``balsams''
and 130 places named ``fir.''
   ``Tinsel'' appears only twice _ for lakes in Michigan and
Wisconsin _ but for other decorations there are 129 ``garland''
locations as well as 358 ``bells,'' 138 ``angels'' and 434 places
in the United States with ``light'' in their names.

   The Christmas tree has its roots firmly
planted in the fertile soil of American tradition, nostalgia and
the Ellipse south of the White House.
   Official lighting ceremonies for the living Colorado blue spruce
will be held Dec. 15 this year, with President and Mrs. Reagan
expected to preside for their final time.
   Transplanted from Pennsylvania a decade ago, it is known
officially as the National Community Christmas Tree and serves as
the focus of the annual Pageant of Peace.
   In addition to that national Christmas tree, a variety of
smaller trees will mark the holiday season in the capital city.
   The National Christmas Tree Association is maintaining tradition
by supplying a tree for the White House.
   The national grower's group condcts an annual contest with the
winner getting to send a tree to the Executive Mansion.
   This year the tree is coming from Snowcrest Tree Farms in
Montello, Wis., operated by Irv Daggett.
   A score of other trees including those at the Capitol are
provided by the U.S. Forest Service.
   The centerpiece tree for the Capitol this year will be a 50-foot
balsam fir scheduled to be cut Nov. 26 in the Manitee National
Forest in Michigan. Lighting of that tree will be Dec. 14, on the
West Lawn of the Capitol.
   The Forest Service will also provide trees for the Supreme
Court, House and Senate dining rooms, Department of Agriculture and
a variety of other federal agencies.
   The lighting of a national Christmas tree began only with
President Calvin Coolidge in 1923, but having such a tree in the
White House goes back at least to Franklin Pierce in 1856.
   Theodore Roosevelt once tried to discourage the use of Christmas
trees, fearing that their popularity would deplete the forests.
   But the tradition, older than the nation itself, continues.
   Indeed, it likely stems from tree-worshiping religions that
flourished in central Europe thousands of years ago.
   Use of greenery indoors at festival times has been reported from
the Roman era, but the first instance of Christmas Trees was seen
in the 1600s in Germany, coming to this country with the many waves
of immigrants from that nation.
   In addition to trees, popular seasonal decorations include
holly, ivy, mistletoe and, on occasion, nearly any other green
plant that can symbolize faith in the coming of spring.
   One custom apparently English in origin and currently widely
popular is kissing under mistletoe. The ancient Druids and Norsemen
long considered this plant to have magical qualities, expecting it
to cure some diseases, promote fertility, nullify poison and avert
misfortune.

   A student truck driver cramming for his
final driving exam discovered he needed to review the chapter on
how to stop without hitting things.
   A semitrailer truck operated by Robert Kernes, 59, of Des
Moines, sheared off a utility pole and wiped out a traffic light
Monday. Kernes said he drove off the road to avoid hitting two cars.
   ``I don't think I got a very good grade on that one,'' said
Kernes, who has been attending the Iowa Truck Driving School of
West Des Moines for three weeks. His final exam, scheduled for
Tuesday, was postponed.
   Kernes and his instructor, John Hutchinson, received minor
injuries and Kernes was ticketed for failure to control a motor
vehicle. Damage was estimated at $10,000.
   Richard Rost said it was the school's first mishap since 1986.
The school boasts more than 100 graduates a year.
   ``We haven't made a decision but I would not say he's completely
flunked out,'' said Rost, a school official.

   Mistletoe may make a good excuse for kissing
at Christmas, but the parasite isn't good for much else and
certainly shouldn't be Oklahoma's state flower, says an arborist.
   Mistletoe robs trees of nourishment, reduces growth and damages
foilage, said Don Massey, owner of CRD Tree Services Inc.
   ``Having mistletoe as the state flower is like having a chainsaw
as the state flower,'' Massey said Tuesday. ``It's good for kissing
under and that's about it.''
   Massey said he wants to drum up support for a change. He said he
doesn't have a replacement in mind, but his efforts will focus on
getting people to realize how mistletoe damages trees.
   ``We have a history of changing names of things to incorporate
new ideas, a new sense of priority,'' he said, listing highways,
stadiums and shopping centers as examples. ``Mistletoe has become
an outdated state flower.''
   Mistletoe has hung in there. It's had official recognition
longer than the state. It was named the territory flower in 1893.
Oklahoma didn't enter the union until 1907.

   His mom says he's a ham who doesn't
understand what's happened, but 16-month-old Andrew Payton Nestler
is a looker.
   The blue-eyed blond with a great smile has won a national
``Cutest Baby Contest'' sponsored by Life magazine.
   Andrew, son of Andrew and Robin Nestler of Pleasanton, was the
readers' choice among 12 finalists picked from more than 20,000
photographs submitted by proud parents and grandparents all over
the country.
   Robin Nestler, 32, said she submitted a snapshot of her youngest
son swinging in a hammock after her neighbor urged her to enter the
contest.
   ``I thought I would never do it,'' she said. ``It seemed
ridiculous. There are thousands and thousands of babies.''
   ``It was close, the final tally was real close,'' said Robert
Pondiscio, a spokesman for the magazine in New York.
   Now she's juggling telephone calls from television talk show
producers.
   A Life reporter and photographer spent two days with the family
and the result is a big photo spread in this week's Life. Andrew,
who was awarded $25,000 in savings bonds, is taking it all in
stride.
   ``He's kind of a ham and likes to climb on things,'' said Robin
Nestler. ``He's just so normal. He doesn't understand what's
happened,''
   But his older sister, 5-year-old Ryan Elizabeth, does. She likes
to follow Andrew around the house calling him ``cutest baby.''
Their brother, 4-year-old T.J., is unimpressed, preferring to ``run
around in a Batman cape and mask fighting crime,'' Robin Nestler
said.

   A beaming Barbara Bush showed off the White
House Christmas decorations Monday, from a towering tree garlanded
with Nutcracker dolls and ballet slippers to a gingerbread house
guarded by a miniature Millie.
   ``It's ravishing,'' exclaimed the first lady as she led a
preview tour of the White House, brimming with garlands, bows,
poinsettias, 47 trees, 54,000 lights and even a sprig of mistletoe
above the Grand Staircase.
   An estimated 100,000 visitors will troop through the mansion to
view the finery over the holiday season.
   President Bush complained Monday of having ``a touch of the
flu,'' but he was host of a congressional ball for 700 guests
Monday night. The Bushes planned seven other Christmas parties over
the next 10 days.
   Mrs. Bush had seen most of the decorations as they went up over
the weekend, with the help of 40 volunteers from the florist
industry and White House staff. Several grandchildren helped pelt
the trees with artificial snow.
   But she got her first glimpse of White House Executive Chef Hans
Raffert's gingerbread house, dressed up as the witch's cottage from
Hansel and Gretel. The wayward children are in the front yard,
along with the witch, a snowman and, stretched out in front of her
own doghouse, Millie.
   ``It's just beautiful, Hans. Absolutely spectacular,'' Mrs. Bush
told the chef, who has created gingerbread houses each Christmas
for the past 21 years. ``Prettier than ever.''
   The Nutcracker ballet provided the theme this year, with the
official 18{-foot high Fraser fir tree in the Blue Room festooned
with porcelain dolls and beaded ballet slippers.
   Mrs. Bush credited the White House staff with the handiwork,
including doll's costumes made from scratch. Giant toy soldiers are
posted along the room's walls.
   ``Everybody in the White House had a part - the carpenters, the
electricians, everybody,'' she said, including a plumber who
constructed a castle from plastic pipes.
   An 18th century Italian wood and terra cotta nativity scene is
prominently displayed in the East Room, as it has been every
Christmas since 1967.
   Mrs. Bush also gave reporters a glimpse of the Bush's personal
Christmas tree, upstairs in their private quarters in the Yellow
Oval Room. The tree, a 16-foot Fraser fir, overlooks the Truman
Balcony in the center of the mansion.
   It is filled with the family's own decorations, including a
crocheted snowman that she and her eldest son, George, made years
ago. Mrs. Bush also spotted a wooden rabbit nestled in grass, the
last survivor from a set of 10 that her mother gave her in 1945,
the year they were married.
   The first lady said there was only one thing that she or the
president wanted this Christmas: ``Peace.''
   Asked about Pentagon restrictions on Christmas celebrations for
the U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, Mrs. Bush said, ``It's too bad.
But you know, when in Rome, I guess you have to do what the Romans
do.'' But she said nothing can stop them from celebrating the
holiday in their hearts.
   Pressed on what other gifts would be under the Bush tree, the
first lady said, ``I have way too much in life, as does George
Bush.'' But she said, ``I'm giving him something he needs.''
   The Bushes will spend Christmas at Camp David, the presidential
retreat in Maryland, with their children and grandchildren.

<LEADPARA>  THERE was a time, I admit, when I was happy to kiss women I had never met.

<HEADLINE>  KISS-UNDER-MISTLETOE POLL SMACKS OF COMMERCIALISM  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Recchi is a columnist for the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., News &amp; Sun-Sentinel.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     So I would not have been a very good candidate for the "mistletoe poll" I
read about early this week.;   For those who haven't seen it, the poll asked
1,005 people to choose from a list of celebrities the one they would most like
to meet under the mistletoe.;   Within a minuscule margin of error, the
results were predictable.;   Women chose Mel Gibson, Paul Newman, Kevin
Costner, Harrison Ford, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Norman Schwarzkopf, Michael
Jordan and Warren Beatty.;   Men picked Paula Abdul as their first choice,
followed by Julia Roberts, Michelle Pfeiffer, Candice Bergen, Madonna, Demi
Moore, Whitney Houston and Annette Bening.;   Of course, you are skeptical of
my assertion that I would not be interested in kissing any of those people. I
suspect even my wife would not believe it.;   But it's true. Kissing someone I
don't know has about as much appeal to me as planting a smack on a hunk of raw
beef.;   So to me, the question is not why wouldn't I, but why would I want to
engage in casual osculation with a stranger? Why would anyone?;   No, I take
that back. I understand why anyone would. Like I said, there was a time when I
did. There were games of spin the bottle and post office when I was a kid.
There were also games of pony express (which is just like post office only
with more horsing around).;   Kissing females I barely knew was fun in those
days. But then, so was making crude noises with my armpit when the math
teacher had his back turned.;   In all modesty, I believe I've matured quite a
bit since those days. Having married an excellent kisser nearly 20 years ago,
the thought of kissing a stranger seems silly.;   Press my lips against
Madonna's? With all due respect, I'll pass. And for the same reason Grandma
Recchi once gave me for not putting coins in my mouth: "You don't know where
they've been.";   Besides, would it mean something? Nope. Would it change my
life? Perhaps, but only for the worse -- particularly if someone in my family
found out.;   In all fairness, however, those questioned in the mistletoe poll
probably didn't give it that much thought.;   We see so many of those
frivolous polls that most people don't bother to question them. As a
columnist, however, it is part of my duty to do exactly that.;   This one, for
example, was conducted by Bruskin Associates for a major credit card company.
Why, you wonder, is a credit card company interested in knowing who has the
most tempting kisser?;   It's not. But the people who run that company know
that there is a public fascination with such polls. They pop up throughout the
year, telling us which celebrity has the squarest jaw, the best derriere,
sexiest eyes, best wardrobe and worst wardrobe.;   The results make perfect
fillers for TV and radio news, as well as for newspaper "people" columns.;  
In this case, it fulfills two purposes for the credit card company.;   The
most subtle of these is the mention of mistletoe, reminding us that Christmas
is only two months away, so maybe we should unholster that credit card and
start shopping. Sure enough, one of the other "revelations" in the poll was
that two-thirds of us don't start Christmas shopping until November.;   The
other, more obvious benefit to the credit card company is that its name is
mentioned free in many newspapers and on TV and radio.;   That I have
neglected to mention it here can be attributed only to pure spite.;   Maybe
I'm not as mature as I thought.  </TEXT>

   When poor pupils at a small school on an
Indian reservation wrote Santa Claus asking for pencils and
notebooks, touched postal workers responded by buying the children
more than 150 gifts.
   ``They weren't asking for things like computers and Nintendo
games,'' said Twila Fairtrace, secretary to the West Palm Beach
postmaster. ``These letters were different because they were asking
for the basics. Most of them asked for school supplies.''
   Fairtrace, who during the Christmas season reviews letters to
Santa, told co-workers about the 21 letters from Ahfachkee School on
the Big Cypress Indian Reservation. About 60 workers then raised
money for gifts for the school's 48 pupils.
   Gift-wrapped presents delivered to the children Friday included
pencils, pens, notebooks and reams of paper, as well as clothing and
toys.
   ``What really got to me,'' postal worker Dawn Haugen said, ``was
when one little girl was telling some others, `Look what I got! I've
got pencils and paper and crayons and glue and everything!'''
   When a kindergartener hugged post office ``elf'' Joann
Goodbridge, the woman was so overcome with emotion she ran behind a
van used to deliver the gifts.
   ``When that little girl threw her arms around me, I just lost
it,'' Goodbridge said. ``I couldn't help crying.''
   Tom Bernos, assistant principal at the south-central Florida
school, said the little girl has 15 brothers and sisters.
   Postal workers said the project boosted morale.
   ``I walked into work, and everybody's there early, on their own
time, wrapping presents,'' said employee John Nasipak. ``We're
thinking about seeing if we can't make this an annual project, using
different schools in needy neighborhoods.''

   During the month of December, Mistletoe
Postmaster A.B. Couch said he handles twice as much mail as he does
all the rest of the year.
   ``They send it here to get the `Mistletoe' postmark on it,''
Couch said. ``I don't count the mail, but I suppose about 500 pieces
came in this morning.''
   The mail arrives by the only route to the tiny post office _ a
twisting, six-mile gravel road.
   ``The story goes that the post office got its name because trees
on the surrounding hills were full of mistletoe,'' said Couch, the
postmaster since 1969. ``That bad winter of 1977 about wiped it out,
though.''
   There isn't much in Mistletoe besides an abandoned Presbyterian
church, some barns and Couch's wood-frame house.
   Inside the house, the kitchen is to the right, the U.S. Post
Office to the left.
   Until December, Couch and his assistant postmaster _ his wife of
22 years, Judy _ process about 2,300 pieces of mail for the 16
customers tucked among the Owsley County hills.
   But in December, mail from all over the country and several
foreign nations arrives at the post office, addressed to him.
Inside, Couch finds addressed, stamped envelopes, onto which he
stamps the coveted postmark and then mails the finished products
back out.
   Couch said he doesn't keep track of who sends what, so he's not
sure whether he has customers who mail to Mistletoe year after year.

<DATELINE>MAMMOTH CAVE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 50-foot vaulted ceilings of a
section of Mammoth Cave helped Christmas carolers create an unusual
sound.
   ``You would think when you go down in a cave you'd get echoes,
but you don't,'' said Ron Wagner, musical director of the Mammoth
Cave Cavemen Barbershop Chorus. ``It's almost perfect down there.''
   The cave's acoustics, which in years past have attracted opera
stars, violinists and Shakespearean actors, surrounded the carolers
with a rich, resonant sound.
   ``It was very moving. It's kind of religious down here in the
cave,'' said Carolyn McNeill of Bowling Green.
   About 800 people, mainly residents from western Kentucky counties
surrounding Mammoth Cave National Park, attended the carroling
session Friday night 150 feet below the earth's surface.
   The event was inspired by an 1883 Christmas party thrown by
guests at the Mammoth Cave Hotel, said Mark Willis, special-events
coordinator for the park. That group decorated a cave room with a
cedar tree covered with ribbons, strung popcorn and sang carols by
the light of whale-oil lamps.
   The performers, including church choirs and area singing clubs,
took their turns on a natural stage of cave rubble.
   The performance, which lasted more than an hour, ended when the
singers led the crowd out of the cave in a candlelight procession.
   As they headed to the surface for cookies, hot chocolate and
apple cider, the group sang ``Silent Night.''

FT  11 DEC 93 / Gardening: How impulse can cost you the earth - Robin Lane
Fox finds astonishing price differences at garden centres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We all watch the retail price index for its ups and downs: I am a keener
observer of the impulse index. This tells you what percentage you have to
pay for buying on the spur of the moment and not shopping around.
In December, it outperforms the FT index. It is particularly fascinating to
keen gardeners who are, usually, peasants at heart. The index tells them
something about fellow gardeners who are not such peasants and are not so
keen on the dirty bits of their shared pastime.
To work out the index, you must price what you want at two or three
different places on the road into central London. Begin with its origin,
then its first significant urban outlet, and then its final resting place in
the vibrant heart of today's capital where everybody is cutting each other's
throat.
Those of us who go back to a product's origin are said in the trade to be
'sourcing'. My sourcing begins where the wolds first become evident in the
Cotswolds. Away from the A40, white-flowered jasmine, 3ft high, is being
sold by growers at prices between Pounds 5 and Pounds 7; large-flowered
cyclamen, with eight to 10 flowers and as many young buds, cost Pounds 3;
small cyclamen persicum cost Pounds 1.50, also in full flower and bud;
mistletoe costs Pounds 1, and you could throw in a few universal pansies if
you really wanted them.
Similar growers extend westwards through the former Vale of Evesham, and
nobody would buy from them merely on impulse: you must have decided what you
want from a plastic tunnel, even if you are then tempted to add something
else.
To plot the impulse index, you then follow the items eastwards into London.
I begin with the simplest example. Mistletoe is simply mistletoe, on a
two-pronged branch without any scope for debate about British Standards or
quality guarantees. Now, two of the capital's leading garden centres are the
Clifton Nurseries in Little Venice and the Chelsea Gardener in Sydney
Street. Unlike me, they have to pay their staff, buy only the best and pay
business rates on top. Which brings me back to mistletoe. In the wolds, it
costs Pounds 1; in Oxford's garden centres, it sells for Pounds 1.40
upwards; but in the vibrant heart of London, at the Chelsea Gardener, it
costs Pounds 5.
The index really jumps when it comes to jasmine. There are plenty of buds on
my two jasmines, 4ft high on their bamboo canes. I bought them last year for
Pounds 5 apiece but I really should be touting them in London. White jasmine
in Little Venice is selling at my size for Pounds 40 each, while in Sydney
Street it costs Pounds 49.95.
Naturally, you would want me to plot the impulse index for Christmas trees,
but they have become as hard to follow as the subtle variations between
fresh, freshly squeezed, pure and real orange juice. Clifton Nurseries
issues a helpful guide to the options, reminding us - rightly - that the
traditional Norway spruce is the first to drop its needles; that the
Nordmann fir is a soft grey-green and less of a dropper; and that the
thickly-branched blue spruce is the best at keeping its needles.
In Oxford garden centres, a 4ft-high blue spruce costs Pounds 12.35; in
Sydney Street, it is Pounds 32.95. A 7ft traditional Norway Dropper will
cost you Pounds 7 in the wolds (the traditional pricing of Pounds 1 a foot
still holds up farmers' driveways), Pounds 12 in Oxford, Pounds 21.50 at
Clifton and Pounds 22.95 at the Chelsea Gardener.
I am not sure that sourcing accounts for any of the Oxford-London
differential as all the shops have left previous labels on their blue Norway
spruces. These state that the trees have all been sourced from the same
place - the Yattendon Estate, which flogs them off in a coniferous bit of
Berkshire.
Urban garden centres thrive on impulse and occupy extremely valuable sites,
so who am I to wish them other than the best of luck? It must be fun putting
the stickers on the big specimens which must set somebody's impulses racing:
Pounds 152 for a standard holly at Clifton Nurseries; Pounds 99 for a bay
tree in Chelsea. The latter tempted me mightily with some camellias with
immaculate leaves and upper shoots about 6ft high: they cost Pounds 84 each
for people who cannot wait.
Londoners may be particularly impulsive, but the truth is that shoppers at
garden centres anywhere will go over the top for a plant which looks upright
and 'fully grown'. Why not trim the side stems of your shrubs and sell them
off as standards at five times the price? In Oxford, an ordinary
yellow-berried cotoneaster is costing Pounds 29.95 already in a standard
shape. It might be worth running it up to the Kings Road in Chelsea on spec
to see if you could palm it off on somebody for as much again.
Are my fellow gardeners nits? From a nurseryman, Pounds 5.50 would buy you
my top Christmas present for anyone who is keen and green: the cream and
grey-green rhamnus, which will flourish on a south or west wall. It costs
more in a garden centre; in Little Venice, it is Pounds 9.95, and in Chelsea
it sets you back Pounds 14.95, with no variation in quality.
Certainly, the nits are impatient: if you look on plants as interior decor
which go in a 'room outside', perhaps it is not so nittish to go straight
out and buy one which jumps the queue of two growing seasons and is
needlessly big. I do, however, appreciate the nit traps.
If bigger is better from the buyer's point of view, why not apply the
principle and the index to anything which grows? At Clifton Nurseries, you
can buy a lump of Alchemilla mollis, the unstoppably vigorous Lady's Mantle,
for Pounds 6.95 in an above-average pot. You can add the cypress spurge
which used to be such an invasive menace for farmers in East Anglia until
the grain barons sprayed it. For Pounds 6.25, you can buy enough of a piece
to run wild through a shaded flowerbed and give you stupendous growth on
your investment if only you can find a Londoner who is willing to go over
the top for too much of it.
Christmas shopping is supposed to be bad for the nerves and even worse for
the feet. Gardeners, I suggest, could enjoy a day's comparison from one shop
to the next. We may be peasants underneath, but the impulse index livens up
life even for country mice in towns.

popularized in holiday traditions, occurs as a drooping yellowish evergreen 
bush on the branch of a host tree. The white berries of the plant, consumed by 
fruit-eating birds without ill effect, are poisonous to humans and other 
animals.

<HEAD>Congressional Report Critical of Mail Standard Change</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Postal Service should rescind a decision
to reduce delivery standards for some mail, according to a report
prepared for Congress.
   The post office cut back some overnight delivery areas in July,
saying the changes would save money and improve efficiency. The
agency said the changes would slow delivery of only about 5 percent
of first-class mail.
   The change could slow delivery of as many as 4.3 billion pieces
of mail over a year, according to the report by the House
Government Operations Committee and titled ``Just Say Slow.''
   In 1989, the post office carried 85.8 billion pieces of
first-class mail. Five percent of that would be 4.3 billion.
   The report issued Monday said the Postal Service implemented the
change without demonstrating that it would lead to any improvement
for the public.
   ``Our investigation indicates that many customers - especially
those in rural America - will suffer because of the new
standards,'' Rep. Bob Wise, D-W. Va., said in a statement.
   Wise is chairman of the government information subcommittee of
the House Government Operations Committee, which released the
report.

<HEAD>NTSB Chairman Presses States to Lift Licenses of Drunken Drivers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal safety official wants a national
campaign to persuade 21 states to pass laws to confiscate the
licenses of drivers who fail or refuse drunken-driving tests.
   James L. Kolstad, chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board, told a meeting of the National Commission on Drunk Driving
that license confiscation is a ``simple, direct and inexpensive''
way to attack a problem blamed for 60 deaths a day or nearly 22,000
fatalities a year.
   Such laws already have been passed by 29 states and the District
of Columbia, and Kolstad said Monday they have resulted in
substantial decreases of drunken driving.
   Kolstad's proposal, recently listed as one of the safety board's
``most-wanted'' safety changes, would require the immediate
confiscation of a license if a driver either fails a sobriety test
or refuses to take one.
   Under the program, a driver is given a temporary license and
given the option of an administrative hearing.
   ``That hearing establishes only one basic fact: did the driver
indeed fail the test or refuse to take it?'' Kolstad said. ``If the
answer is `yes,' the driver's license is revoked on the spot.
   According to the Safety Board, the 21 states which have not
passed such laws are: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina,
South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington.

<HEAD>White House Christmas: 47 Trees, Mistletoe, and Gingerbread Millie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House Christmas decorations are
ready for the estimated 100,000 visitors who will troop through
over the next few weeks.
   ``It's ravishing,'' exclaimed Barbara Bush on Monday as she led
a preview tour of a White House brimming with garlands, bows,
poinsettias, 47 trees, 54,000 lights and even a sprig of mistletoe
above the Grand Staircase.
   President Bush complained of having ``a touch of the flu,'' but
he was host of a congressional ball for 700 guests Monday night.
The Bushes planned seven other Christmas parties over the next 10
days.
   Mrs. Bush had seen most of the decorations as they went up over
the weekend, with the help of 40 volunteers from the florist
industry and White House staff. Several grandchildren helped pelt
the trees with artificial snow.
   The Nutcracker ballet provides the theme this year, with the
official 18{-foot high Fraser fir tree in the Blue Room festooned
with porcelain dolls and beaded ballet slippers.
   Mrs. Bush also gave reporters a glimpse of the Bush's personal
Christmas tree, upstairs in their private quarters in the Yellow
Oval Room and filled with the family's own decorations.

<TEXT>     People have been under the impression that eating a poinsettia can cause
death. Not so, says the Society of American Florists. The only reported death
from someone's eating a poinsettia came about the turn of the century, and
that was not confirmed.;   But eating a poinsettia probably will cause nausea
and even vomiting, according to poison-control centers.;   There's an obvious
answer. Keep the plants out of the reach of children and pets.;   (check)
MISTLETOE -- A wonderful plant. I love the excuse it gives to smooch.;   But
eating this plant is a definite mistake. Diarrhea and vomiting almost always
result, and a few deaths have been reported.;   Again, keep it out of the
reach of children and away from pets. Because mistletoe is usually hung, make
sure it is secure.;   (check) HOLLY -- The beauty of this plant belies its
danger.;   The leaves and berries hold toxins that can cause diarrhea and
vomiting and even damage your nervous system. A number of deaths have been

EVERGREENS -- Perhaps the least toxic of all the holiday plants, they
nevertheless are not something you want your child or pet to eat. They contain
terpenes (related to turpentine).;   Again, nausea and vomiting can result.
Your child or pet would have to eat a lot of evergreens, though.;   Both real
and artificial holiday plants often have some sort of toxic material added or
sprayed on them.;   Even if they aren't a serious hazard, the joy of the
holidays shouldn't be diminished by the sickness of a loved one.;   Use common
sense when decorating. When in doubt, keep it out of reach.  </TEXT>

   Residents of this seaside community
can kiss holiday mistletoe goodbye, along with Christmas trees and
sleigh bells, because the city has given traditional street
decorations the heave ho-ho-ho.
   Rudolph has been replaced by Flipper. Jonathon Livingston
Seagull outranks the snowman.
   Old St. Nick will ride into town under a wave of ocean-themed
vinyl banners depicting sea gulls, dolphins and kelp.
   ``The generic candle and Christmas wrapping could go in Des
Moines or Cincinnati,'' said artist Laddie John Dill.
   ``I wanted something that was more tailored to Santa Monica ...
which has become the arts center of California,'' added Dill, who
designed the banners with graphic artist John Van Hamersveld.
   The Santa Monica Area Chamber of Commerce commissioned the 225
banners, which are being strung up on lampposts this week. Each
3-foot-by-7-foot banner shows a gull, dolphin or sea weed.
   ``We didn't want to just make it Christmas bells and carolers,''
said Michael Segal, who headed the design project as a member of
the chamber's central business district advisory group.
   ``The kelp gives a mistletoe feeling, the dolphins are in a
wreath design and the gull looks like a Christmas dove of peace,''
Segal said.

   This Ohio River city's version of
Hollywood's sidewalk of stars honoring entertainment greats will
star anyone who wants to pay $40.
   For that fee, city officials will engrave the donor's name in a
brick that will be part of a new sidewalk at the city's Harris
Riverfront Park.
   Proceeds from the sale will go toward improvements at the park,
Mayor Bobby Nelson said.
   The city's Urban Renewal Authority plans to install 1,548
engraved bricks and will flank them with 3,846 pieces of plain
masonry.
   ``We're not tearing anything up. We're just adding to it,'' said
Ed Diehl, city urban renewal director.

   Cody Jacobs is giving thanks for a year
that's been his dream come true as one of former President Ronald
Reagan's biggest fans.
   Jacobs' good fortune started last summer when he was named one
of five Reagan Scholars and awarded four years free tuition at
Reagan's alma mater, tiny Eureka College.
   Then, the 19-year-old Arkansas City, Kan., native was elected
freshman class president, putting him right on his self-imposed
schedule for reaching his ultimate life's goal: president of the
United States.
   Next week, Jacobs is going to California to meet his idol and
role model.
   ``This will fullfill my lifelong dream,'' Jacobs said from his
dorm room, where the walls are covered with pictures of the Gipper,
framed letters from the former commander-in-chief and campaign
posters.
   ``I'm a total Reagan fanatic,'' Jacobs said. ``It started in
fourth grade when a teacher sparked my awareness in politics with a
real intense history lesson on the presidency.''
   School officials say Jacobs' devotion to Reagan is genuine.
   ``Cody is unique and may be the most politically inclined of the
Reagan Scholars we've had since the program started in 1983,'' said
Rolf Craft, director of the scholarship program.

ARTISTS ADD A TOUCH OF THE SEA TO THEIR YULETIDE DESIGNS FOR SANTA MONICA

<P>
Westside artists Laddie John Dill and John Van Hamersveld have designed 
original holiday banners for Santa Monica that will feature gulls, dolphins and 
kelp instead of the standard holly and mistletoe. 
</P>
<P>
"Both John and I felt that a leading arts community such as Santa Monica should 
have original, distinctive artwork for the holidays," said Dill, an 
internationally known artist who lives in Santa Monica. Dill said he and Van 
Hamersveld chose a marine theme, instead of "the generic candle and Christmas 
wrapping thing," because they wanted the banners to relate to the seaside 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioned by the Santa Monica Chamber of Commerce, the holiday decorations 
consist of 225 3-by-7-foot vinyl canvas banners that will be hung from light 
posts throughout the city. Each side will bear one of three designs: a gull, a 
school of dolphins and fish and a flowing arrangement of seaweed. 
</P>
<P>
Each image is distinctively marine, Dill noted, but suggests the holidays. "The 
seaweed almost reads like mistletoe." 
</P>
<P>
Dill, whose studio is in Venice, and Van Hamersveld, who lives and works in 
Malibu, collaborated on the designs using fax machines in their studio offices. 
Dill made initial drawings, Van Hamersveld said, "then I drew over them and 
cropped the designs." 
</P>
<P>
The images appear on the banners silk-screened in white. The banners also 
feature colored backgrounds hand-painted by Dill. Dill said he used durable 
vinyl acrylic paints for the abstract backgrounds. To paint the hundreds of 
banners, Dill spread them on the floor of his hangar-like studio. "It looked 
like an Iranian rug dealership," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Teri Klass of Dill's staff coordinated production of the decorations. 
</P>
<P>
Dill said he and his collaborators, who donated their services, originally 
proposed that the word heal -- a reference to their concern for the health of 
Santa Monica Bay -- appear on the banners. The chamber felt the reference was 
too negative, Dill said, and the artists opted instead for the words peace, 
friendship and joy. 
</P>
<P>
Though much less abstract than most of Dill's work, the banners are still 
decidedly contemporary. "The banners have a little more of an abstract edge to 
them than you might find in Des Moines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The decorations will go up the day after Thanksgiving and remain until Jan. 7. 
They can be reused each year. 
</P>
<P>
Van Hamersveld said the finished banners are "beautiful, like a Christmas 
card." A Chamber of Commerce official, who asked not to be identified, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past we've had very traditional Christmas decorations. That's a polite 
way of saying they were lousy."

   Saturday night, Jennifer Thoren hung up her stocking with
care, left out a cup of cocoa and cookies for Santa and went
to bed with visions of sugarplums dancing in her head. Yes,
Saturday.
   For 11-year-old Jennifer, Dec. 22 -- the winter solstice,
when daylight starts growing longer again -- is the day that
matters, not Dec. 25. 'Tis the season, solstice celebrants
say, for sending solstice cards, trimming solstice trees and
exchanging solstice gifts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Solstice predates Christmas by many centuries," says
Robert Brooks, a 54-year-old auto-plant machine repairman,
who lives in Madison Heights, Mich. Pagan solstice
celebrations date back 2,000 years before Christ was born, he
adds. "We feel the holiday was kind of taken over by modern
religion."
   Mr. Brooks happens to be an atheist, so he's prone to be
put out by all the hoopla celebrating the birth of Jesus. But
atheists are hardly the only ones who celebrated the winter
solstice yesterday. Wiccan followers, or witches, observe the
day with gift exchanges, decorated trees and candle-lit
ceremonies. Planet Drum, an ecological education group in San
Francisco, gathers hundreds of members around a bonfire for a
ceremony involving drumming and music. No one knows for
certain how many other people observe the day.
   Nacolle Parsons, of Salt Lake City, Utah, for one, feels
extremely "put upon" this time of year. "I get so tired of
{Christmas carols} being crammed at me. Everywhere, there are
Christmas sales. No one else's ideas get accepted," grumbles
Ms. Parsons, who manages a fan club for actor Mark Hamill.
   Not that solstice celebrants are a bunch of Grinches.
Children found stockings stuffed and presents under their
Christmas, uh, solstice trees yesterday morning. "You've got
to do something so your kids don't feel different or left
out," explains Ann Zindler, a housewife in Columbus, Ohio.
   Even Santa Claus is acceptable. Despite his historical
connection with St. Nicholas, solstice celebrants contend
that Santa is a secular figure in America, not a religious
one. "I'm not heartless," says Ellen Johnson, a homemaker in
Rockaway Township, N.J., who adds that her three-year-old son
"can enjoy the character just like everybody else."
   Jennifer Thoren strings popcorn for her family's solstice
tree, sings "Santa Claus is Coming to Town" and explains to
friends at her San Francisco school why she celebrates the
solstice. To make it easier, this year her mother, Pamela,
addressed children at her school about winter solstice, the
date when the Earth's axis begins to tilt toward the sun and
days start getting longer. "We think it's only fair for kids
to see the other side of the coin," says Ms. Thoren, a
health-care worker.
   Still, some things are avoided, even though there are no
set traditions for the winter solstice celebration. Patricia
Wilkinson, a homemaker in Phoenix, Ariz., shuns traditional
angel and drummer-boy ornaments for her solstice tree,
instead using homemade egg-shell ornaments adorned with
ribbons and buttons. "They represent a new beginning,"
explains Ms. Wilkinson. She and her husband, Walter, don't
exchange gifts on solstice; instead, they invite some of
their atheist friends over for a potluck dinner.
   But many solstice celebrants send solstice cards, with
greetings like, "Solstice Claus is coming to town]" and
"Merry Solstice." A few cards poke fun at religion, offending
some people. "These are anti-Christian {messages}, not
pro-pagan. They're vicious," says Rev. Donald Wildmon,
president of the American Family Association, a Christian
activist group in Tupelo, Miss. "These people see Christians
having a good time celebrating and they feel left out.
They're seeking joy but they'll never find joy by pulling
others down."
   Still, many historians say Christians appropriated the
holiday from the pagans. No one knows for certain when Jesus
was born, but "most scholars believe Jesus was born closer to
spring or summer," says Delores Carpenter, associate dean of
Howard University's School of Divinity.
   Winter solstice was being observed as a sacred celebration
of the sun god by ancient Egyptians as early as 1996 B.C. and
as late as about 274 A.D. in Rome, says Loyd Allen, associate
professor of church history at Southern Baptist Theological
Seminary in Louisville, Ky.
   In the years following the first recorded Christmas
celebration in 336 A.D., Christians copied many solstice
traditions, including gift giving, feasting, the decorating
of evergreen trees and the use of holly, mistletoe, candles
and wreaths.
   Despite all the history, some solstice celebrants have
adopted a distinctly contemporary approach. When it comes to
music, computer programmer Chris Allen of Salt Lake City
eschews traditional carols, preferring such favorites as the
Beatles' "Here Comes the Sun." Says Mr. Allen: "It fits right
with the season."

   Aaaah, chestnuts roasting in volcanic fires, 48
million years ago.
   Christmas didn't start in this part of the world, but there is
geologic evidence that many of its trappings existed in the Pacific
Northwest during the Eocene Epoch.
   Chestnuts, and forerunners of the traditional fir Yule log, were
roasting in volcanic fires 48 million years ago in north-central
Washington, before there were noses for Jack Frost to nip.
   ``We have the oldest fossil records of Christmas trees - the fir
lineage - the oldest records of mistletoe, of holly and of Castanea
(edible) chestnut, and the oldest fossil records of gooseberry,
wild currant, apple, blackberry, and pear,'' said Wes Wehr,
paleobotany curator at the University of Washington's Burke Museum.
   ``And, oh yes, also the oldest fossil record of cranberry,'' he
said. ``I guess what I need to do is find the fossil turkey, and
then we're ready for dinner.''
   Evidence of the precursors to some of today's plants, including
those used to celebrate Christmas, were found the past several
years at fossil sites 100 miles apart, in Republic, Wash., and
Princeton, British Columbia.
   Besides plants, the Republic site has been rich in insect finds,
Wehr said Friday.
   ``Besides other things, we're getting the only records of the
North American Eocene earwigs, and we have the earliest fossil
record of the cutter bee,'' Wehr said.
   The plants and insects, along with early fishes, were preserved
when a heavy layer of volcanic ash suddenly fell on a shallow lake
that covered what is now Republic, a town of 1,000 people.
   The fossils have been gathered by Wehr and other scientists from
around the country at a shale cliff on the north side of Republic.
He started digging at the shale rocks in 1977, after there had been
occasional fossil finds. The site, with a small museum, has gained
status in paleontology circles.
   ``It's one of the great places in North America to see fish,
insects and plants, all associated,'' Wehr said. ``It's been
interesting to begin collecting a few specimens on what was a
corner lot, and have it become a place where scientists come from
around the country.''
   Some of the leading paleontologists from around the United
States, and from other nations, are expected to attend a workshop
at Republic in June.
   Visitors, including tourists, are also given a tour of the
Stonerose Interpretational Center, then encouraged to start
breaking rocks.
   Many important scientific finds have been made by people who
can't even spell paleontology, Wehr said.
   ``Often you will have a 9- or 10-year-old student break open a
rock and they have found a distinct new species,'' Wehr said. ``It
makes it all much more real.''

   The Associated Press reported erroneously
on Wednesday that mistletoe has been banned from the campus of
Moorhead State University. University President Rolland Dille says
he asked department heads to remove mistletoe if they received
complaints, but did not ban it from the campus.
   The story also said Margaret Potter, a psychology teacher, filed

Although she complained, Potter says she did not file a formal

   Mistletoe has been banned from Moorhead

   University President Rolland Dille agreed with instructor
Margaret Potter, and the affirmative action officer then ordered
the ban Monday.
   ``I'm not against Christmas, honestly,'' said Dille. ``But we've
come a long way in eliminating some of the customs that encouraged
a very different treatment of women. In my opinion, mistletoe tends
to sanctify uninvited endearment.''

<HEAD>Holiday Decorations, Use Care</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The annual crop of holiday greenery is
sprouting in American homes. Enjoying those decorations also means
using some care to avoid fire and keep children from poisoning
themselves accidentally.
   Some of the most popular plants used for holiday decorations are
poisonous, according to the National Clearinghouse for Poison
Control Centers.
   Holly is popular because of its bright green leaves and red
berries, but the berries can be dangerous if eaten.
   Swallowing the berries can lead to diarrhea, vomiting and
depression of the central nervous system, the Poison Control Center
says.
   Mistletoe berries are another danger, containing chemicals that
can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, high blood pressure
and even collapse of the circulatory system, medical authorities
say. In addition, diarrhea, weakness, low blood pressure and other
problems can occur from eating any part of the yew plant.
   Those lovely red poinsettias can be troublesome too. Health
officials say that if any part of the plant is swallowed it can
cause abdominal discomfort, while the milky sap from the leaves can
cause an irritation or dermatitis in some people.
   Another decoration danger is fire, with Christmas trees and other
greenery a major problem.
   Try to keep the tree as moist as possible, the Consumer Product
Safety Commission urges. After bringing it home cut off a few inches
of the base and place it in water. And keep the tree well watered
when in use.
   Buyers should avoid dry trees, of course. A good test is to pull
on some needles and see if they resist. The harder they are to pull
off, the better.
   If the cut part of the tree is sticky with resin, that's a good
sign.
   Try bouncing the tree on the ground a bit: a shower of falling
needles tells you that it's too dry.
   When going to bed or leaving the house turn off lights on trees
and other decorations, the commission said. And never use candles on
trees or near greens.
   Check all lights for broken bulbs and frayed wires before
installing them, and discard any damaged strings.
   Never use lights on a metallic artificial tree. A faulty string
can cause the entire tree to become charged, potentially causing an
electrocution. This type of tree can be brightened by a spotlight
shining on it.
   Other safety suggestions from the Safety Commission include:
   _Artificial snow sprays can irritate the lungs if inhaled. Read
the directions carefully and follow them.
   _Wear gloves when decorating with spun glass ``angel hair'' to
avoid irritation to eyes and skin.
   _Use plastic ``tinsel'' rather than the leaded kinds which could
be hazardous if ingested.
   _In homes with children be especially careful of using fragile
decorations or items with sharp points or which resemble candy or
food.
   _Before lighting any fire make sure trimmings and wrapping paper
are clear of the area. Do not burn wrappings in the fireplace.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Kiss goodbye to the Christmas holly,

   From Mr OLIVER CHASTNEY

<TEXT>
Sir, Reflecting on David Richardson's informative and amusing article
(Farmer's Viewpoint, December 20) on the rise and fall of the mistletoe
futures market, I suggest it may spark off frantic scenes at Tenbury Auction
during the run-up to next Christmas - international traders talking urgently
into their mobiles and giving knowing winks towards the gavel as another
couple of pounds of the precious twigs and berries pass over the trading
floor.
Aside from all that, I wonder if Mr Richardson could enlighten me on any EU
rules regarding the possibility of grubbing up my holly bush. This is the
second year in a row it has failed to produce a single berry. I am seriously
considering a set aside policy for that part of the garden. This Christmas
we have again had to buy the stuff.

A WARHOL CHRISTMAS: CLICHED BUT CLEVER

SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If somebody found a bunch of shopping lists with doodles by Andy Warhol, you 
can bet they'd be snapped up by some salivating collector and grandly exhibited 
in a burst of fulsome PR. So it isn't surprising that the Center for Decorative 
Arts in San Juan Capistrano is making a fuss over a set of Christmas cards 
Warhol made for Tiffany &amp; Co. in the early 1960s, on view through Dec. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the seemingly low-key, ultratraditional designs for the cards reflect 
some of the central concerns of Warhol's own work. He was, after all, the 
artist who deliberately sought out such banal or well-known subjects as 
Campbell Soup cans, Brillo boxes and the faces of Jackie Kennedy and Marilyn 
Monroe. He presented these subjects as mindlessly repetitive, identical images 
suited to an era of mass media, mass production and mass ennui. 
</P>
<P>
The cards, which Warhol designed while he still worked as a commercial artist, 
offer images of fruit baskets, Christmas trees with birds and baubles, kids 
holding hands, a sled filled with presents -- the most uncreative and cliched 
subjects imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, these subjects were likely to please the average card-buyer looking 
for something pretty and seasonal. A major consumer in his own right (as 
posthumous auctions of his bric-a-brac made clear), Warhol always had a 
brilliant grasp of consumer habits. 
</P>
<P>
The watercolor originals are cheerily executed in the unsettling colors 
(avocado greens, hot pinks) stylish in the late '50s and early '60s. They also 
are full of Warhol-style repetitive imagery: To make the trio of holly leaf, 
fern leaf and mistletoe Christmas trees that appeared on a card from about 1963 
(precise dates apparently are unavailable) Warhol repeated the same four-branch 
segment over and over. The eye reads the juxtaposed branches as a tree, 
although the branches aren't actually connected to each other. 
</P>
<P>
Other images, such as the two designs of Christmas trees made with little 
stars, seem to have been hand-stamped onto the paper -- a primitive form of 
mechanical reproduction. ("Christmas Tree With Continuing Stars" is actually a 
fine little conceptual exercise. The whole paper is dotted with colorful stars 
which "fall" like snow, except where they are printed in close, overlapping 
formation to form the outline of a tree. Warhol's penciled-in triangular 
guidelines are visible under the mass of stars.) 
</P>

In 1962 Warhol pioneered the concept of having his "paintings" silk-screened by 
assistants rather than painted by (his) hand. So making designs for 
mass-produced cards was right up his alley. 
</P>
<P>
Even the fact that they were made to be sold by a ritzy Fifth Avenue jewelry 
store probably suited him to a T. As others have pointed out, Warhol's art was 
the reflection of an affluent society. Wealthy people shelled out more for 
Warhol's screen-printed portraits of themselves than they would have paid for 
ordinary, painstakingly hand-painted portraits. 
</P>
<P>
So, far from merely being a hungry artist's potboilers or curiously banal 
mementoes of a world-beating career, the cards are full-fledged pieces of 
Warholiana. And it just so happens that Tiffany's is reissuing two cards each 
year beginning this Christmas -- a savvy move in an era that once again is 
likely to ooh and ah over the sweetly traditional motifs. But we know better. 
</P>

 Fourteen Christmas card drawings by Andy Warhol are at the Center for the 
Study of Decorative Arts through Dec. 23, along with Christmas trees decorated 
by 10 designers. The center, at 31431 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano, 
is open from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. A $3 donation is

FT  24 DEC 93 / Property: Is there a Dingley Dell left in England? - Gerald
Cadogan, in search of an old-fashioned Christmas, has been turning to
Pickwick Papers for home-buying inspiration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Where do our back-to-basics political leaders find guidance for an
old-fashioned Christmas? Not from a Church abandoning its time-hallowed
prayer book. Nor from the monarchy, where family values are clouded. But
they could turn to Charles Dickens' account of Christmas at Dingley Dell, in
Pickwick Papers, the icon of Victorian Christmas.
Not that Pickwick is Victorian at all. The first monthly part came out in
April 1836, when William IV was king and Dickens only 24, and the last in
November 1837 when the 19-year-old Victoria had been queen for just a few
months.
Nevertheless, Dingley Dell is enshrined as the ideal mid- 19th century
Christmas, linked in our imaginations with trees, cards, crackers and
presents, which are all post-Pickwick.
The Christmas tree reached Britain only when Prince Albert, of
Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, brought the idea from Germany. Dickens called it 'that
pretty German toy' and liked 'its multitude of little tapers'. But a
Pickwickian Christmas has to be icy.
When Dickens was a boy, the Thames froze and there were frost fairs, and
sliding and skating as at Dingley Dell, where Pickwick fell through the ice.
At an old-fashioned Christmas there must be hot wassail to drink; games,
singing and dancing; mistletoe to kiss under, and a large fire. The
highlight of the Christmas Eve party at Dingley Dell is the ghost story of
the sexton Gabriel Grub and the goblins. Christmas Day starts with oysters.
Church receives a single sentence. 'Mr Benjamin Allen fell fast asleep:
while Mr Bob Sawyer abstracted his thoughts from wordly matters by the
ingenious process of carving his name on the seat of the pew.' Then a
'substantial lunch' with 'strong beer and cherry brandy' leads to an hour on
the ice.
Is there a wintry paradise now around which the snow wraps a cocoon of
good-heartedness? If it has turned cold, Fryers House in Braughing Friars in
Hertfordshire, a traditional, timber-framed house on offer from Mullucks
Wells for Pounds 315,000, has a large natural pond that is ideal for skating
and is close to the house if anyone should fall in.
For tobogganing, try the South Downs in Sussex, if you do not find them too
steep. (As a boy, I broke my arm on a sledge in Sussex.) In the middle of
the downs at East Dean near Chichester and Midhurst is The Thatched House of
brick and knapped flint, which Jackson-Stops is selling for Pounds 265,000.
It also has a ghost, who knocks on the front door in the early morning. A
hundred years ago two flint knappers lived in the house and took turns to
wake each other up at 5am. The ghost has even appeared at the door as a tall
man in black cloak and wide hat.
In East Sussex Old Rectory Cottage is at the foot of the downs, in
Folkington near Eastbourne (Strutt &amp; Parker, Pounds 275,000). And mid-county
at Fulking, also by the downs, Nettledown Cottage is the place for a
get-away-from-it-all Christmas. Stock up with food and drink, as it is at
the end of a long Wenceslas-taxing farm road. Joint agents are Humberts and
Fox &amp; Sons, and the price is Pounds 395,000.
The Christmas fire at Dingley Dell would fit into the 12ft wide fireplace
and bread oven of Abbotsford, 17th century, thatched and full of beams, near
Thorverton in the valley of the river Exe north of Exeter. Stags offers it
for Pounds 125,000. More expensive is the Northmoor estate in the valley of
the river Barle on Exmoor, where large herds of wild red deer suggest
Christmas. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, in Exeter, is selling it in lots for
around Pounds 640,000 in all.
A Dickensian-sounding name is one of the attractions of Bleke House, a
Regency property on the edge of Shaftesbury in Dorset, with views over
Blackmore Vale (Savills, Pounds 245,000).
Restoration House near the cathedral in Rochester has real associations with
Dickens. It is a large 16th-17th century house with carved ceilings and
grand fireplaces, and is listed Grade I. Here Charles II spent his first
night in England on returning to take the throne in 1660. Its name became
Restoration House.
Dickens used it as Satis House in Great Expectations where Miss Havisham
lives frozen in time, the cake for her never-to-be wedding overhung with
cobwebs and sitting on a yellowed tablecloth.
Great Expectations begins at Christmas time, without the cheer of Dickens'
earlier Christmasses. The escaped convict, a 'fearful man, all in coarse
grey, with a great iron on his leg', catches young Pip among the graves at
the side of the church porch and frightens him into stealing not only a file
from his brother-in-law, Joe Gargery, the blacksmith, but brandy, mincemeat
and a pork pie from Mrs Joe.
At the end of the book Satis House is for sale in lots. The house was to be
sold, gutted for building materials, and pulled down. Luckily that has not
happened. But it needs a lot of money for restoration, 'far more than the
usual Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 300,000', says Robin Tillett, of Knight Frank
&amp; Rutley, in Tunbridge Wells. The asking price is Pounds 250,000. It has a
good-sized garden. Inside it does not look changed from how it appears in
Country Life photographs in 1924. Further information: Fox &amp; Son, Haywards

<TEXT>
   Czechoslovaks who took to the
streets only two weeks ago to demand democratic reform were out in
force Sunday morning but this time to shop for Christmas.
   As political leaders searched for a new president for the
nation, crowds lined up in Wenceslas Square to buy candles set in
sparkled pine cones and gold-sprayed mistletoe. Later, they
returned to celebrate the naming of a new government.
   But revolution or not, it was Silver Sunday.
   Stores open on Sunday only during the three weeks before
Christmas. Bronze Sunday, the first, is subdued. Gold, the last, is
chaos. Silver is merely frenetic.
   Mothers with prams plowed through crowds in the biting cold.
Speakers blared ``White Christmas'' sung in Czech by someone who
was not Bing Crosby.
   Scrawny trees sickened by acid-rain were on sale. But on
Prague's picture-book Old Town Square, a giant healthy fir was
alight with gay color.
   Tinsel and ornaments hung in windows displaying fish food and
deodorant. Fake snow made of plastic foam swirled over stacks of
grapefruit juice labeled in Arabic in the window of one store.
   At the department store Kotva, shoppers clogged the escalators
on all five floors.
   Fathers in the toy department eyed models of flashy cars they
could not possibly afford.
   From the basement cheese cooler to the fourth-floor furniture
display, shoppers pawed over merchandise with a touch of
resignation. The most desirable items were marked ``sold.''
   Ladislav Trojan, a Prague cab driver perusing the thinly stocked
electronics department, shook his head and made his point in
halting English:
   ``Problem is not to be expensive. Problem is to be.''
   That is, few quality goods were to be had at any price.
Czechoslovakia has kept itself out of debt by spurning consumer
imports from anyone but Soviet bloc partners.
   Politics pervaded the scene in posters taped to walls and
windows, but shoppers had other things on their mind.
   Martin Cipro, a philosophy student wheeling a full basket in the
Kotva food section, paused for a brief interview. ``I think there
will be more to buy with freedom,'' he said, edging off toward the
canned fruit.
   On an open square near Kotva, artisans of Czechoslovakia's
minuscule private sector sold clay bells, ceramic jewelry and odd
bits of decoration in a market that appears only at Christmas.
   The busiest stand sold walnuts and apples.
   No Santa Claus was in sight. The Slavic St. Nicholas wears a
robe and miter, carries a fancy shepherd's crook and does not hang
out on street corners.
   Each Dec. 6, costumed St. Nicks flanked by devils and angels
help begin the holiday season with a moonlight procession on the
medieval Charles Bridge. This year, a horned and tailed marcher
carried a sign reading:
   ``Even devils stay clear of the hellish politics of the
Communist Central Committee.''
   On Silver Sunday, however, a new government was sworn in, the
first not dominated by Communists in 41 years. President Gustav
Husak resigned.
   Off Wenceslas Square, a tree seller named Ludek said he thought
business was about the same as last year. ``But this is a much
happier Christmas,'' he said.

   The Halloween candy has barely been eaten, and the
Thanksgiving turkey won't be dressed for weeks. But already,
it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.
   Turn on the tube at random, and you'll see holly and
mistletoe, or expensive toys wrapped up in bows. Hasbro
Inc.'s Playskool toy line kicked off its holiday campaign
last night on NBC's "L.A. Law." Lionel Corp.'s Kiddie City
toy-store chain started its Christmas advertising on
television last month. And Tott's champagne is already
ringing in the holidays for E.&amp;J. Gallo Winery.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "In this kind of environment, a lot of advertisers are
trying to get a jump start," says Dan Owen, president of
Playskool, Pawtucket, R.I.
   Once upon a time not very long ago, the Christmas selling
season began after Thanksgiving. Advertisers didn't dare trot
out the Christmas trees and snow scenes until after Santa
Claus made his first appearance at the annual Macy's
Thanksgiving Day Parade.
   But over the past few years, advertisers have steadily
pushed forward the "holiday season," this year rolling it all
the way up to Halloween. TV viewers last weekend were
bombarded by Christmas messages, and more are on the way
every day. The way things are going, next year's Christmas
season may start just after Labor Day.
   Yet the early advertising assault may well backfire. For
starters, "there's no evidence earlier advertising will
increase {sales} volume at all," notes Larry Light of
Arcature, a Stamford, Conn., marketing consultant.
   The early birds may be able to gain market share at the
expense of competitors, Mr. Light says. But if everybody
advertises early -- and it sure looks as if they are -- then
that advantage is wiped out, too. With advertisers all
rushing in long before Thanksgiving, "then you have increased
marketing costs without increasing share or volume," says Mr.
Light. In other words, everybody loses.
   Most advertisers aren't planning to spend more than last
year, they're just starting earlier. That means they may be
blowing their budgets before people are really ready to buy.
When consumers finally are ready to listen, the ad spending
may already be wiped out. Worse, the Christmas selling season
may peak too early. The already troubled retailing industry
doesn't need yet another season of "after-Christmas"
discounts and sales beginning well before Christmas Eve.
   Advertisers, though, aren't listening. They can't afford
to wait, since so many competitors are starting now. All want
to be on the consumer's mind before he or she even starts
shopping.
   "When it's Christmas time, you don't have to tell anybody
to shop," reasons Alan Pollak, whose Pollak Agency in
Metuchen, N.J., creates ads for Kiddie City. His goal is "to
get people to think of Kiddie City earlier," so it is
top-of-mind when they do go shopping.
   Kiddie City desperately needs to keep sales levels high
because Lionel currently is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings. The chain ran its first TV spots in October,
about a month earlier than usual. It began its radio campaign
in September, and ran some test ads as early as August. Most
recently, Kiddie City has been hawking its layaway policy
with the intentionally ungrammatical "If you lay away, you
won't lay awake." Notes Mr. Pollak, "In this economy, that's
important to a lot of people."
   Playskool started its new prime-time campaign about two
weeks earlier than last year. "By starting earlier, it's
going to give us a longer selling season," says Playskool's
Mr. Owen. "In a relatively soft retail environment, I have a
major opportunity to increase market share this year."
   Playskool is combining its early start with more ads in
prime time in an attempt to muscle in on recession-wracked
competitors. Each ad in its new campaign, dubbed the
"Playskool Photo Album," features "snapshots" of family life
and prominently highlights several toys.
   Marketers pushing for a head start are taking their cue
from such advertisers as Time Warner Inc.'s Sports
Illustrated magazine, which typically begins its
Christmas-themed TV ad campaigns in October. Its commercials,
which are direct-response subscription pleas, "seem to do
better the earlier we start," explains Linda Warren, consumer
marketing director. "Others have realized it works. The
stores are starting to catch on," she suggests.
   Indeed, many advertisers are forced to get their messages
out early because the stores themselves have already begun
pushing Christmas merchandise. Boxes of Christmas cards
appeared in September. And with a full 46 days till the
yuletide, department stores are already loading up on the
tinsel and canned carols.

   The assortment of 12 Christmas cards
includes smiling Santas and bouquets of holly wrapped in messages
of love, an angel of peace playing a flute, a pair of doves
floating above mistletoe and fir.
   No doubt greeting cards drawn by professional artists, you say?
No. They were crafted on Death Row by 10 inmates, two of whom have
been executed since their ink drawings first were published.
   Before his death in September 1987 for killing a probation
officer, Joseph Starvaggi envisioned the spirit of Christmas as a
floating angel playing the flute as the Star of Bethlehem shines
through her wing.
   Starvaggi's Angel of Hope is the second most popular card.
   The most frequently ordered Death Row design was drawn by Bob
Black, 43, convicted for the 1985 contract slaying of his wife. His
sketch shows an inmate hunched over a Bible inside a prison cell,
barren except for a paper Christmas tree and paper star taped to
the wall.
   The cards are marketed by Help Our Prisoners Exist, a support
group for Death Row inmates and their families that advocates the
abolition of capital punishment. The 12-card assortment sells for
$8.
   ``The cards show that Death Row inmates are sensitive human
beings,'' said Ken Robison, a stepfather of a Death Row inmate and
HOPE co-founder.
   ``A person influenced by drugs or alcohol or mental illness or
passionate rage can commit a terrible crime. We can't diminish that
fact,'' Robison said. ``That does not take away from the fact that
they are caring, creative people and they have a message.''

   Mistletoe and holly no longer deck the halls,
and everyone has stopped singing carols, but the interest in
Christmas trees here is almost as high as it was a month ago.
   The trees are being hauled into the marshes and swamps in a
battle to slow erosion of the region's wetlands, which are
disappearing at the rate of about 50 square miles a year.
   ``Everybody wants to take part. It's great. Instead of just
throwing out your Christmas tree, you can send it to save a
marsh,'' said Bob Thomas of the Louisiana Nature and Science Center.
   Environmentalists hope the trees will collect sediment and form
barriers to waves, protecting the shoreline. The project, in its
third year, also has a side benefit: It saves space in dumps.
   The program was started by John Day of the Coastal Ecology
Institute of Louisiana State University.
   Day and some graduate students built a line of fences across an
eroded marsh and filled it with tree limbs and native bamboo. The
project, which had to be done by hand, was impractical, Thomas said.
   ``It was not something that was going to catch on. It had to be
done in January and February when the vegetation had died down. It
was cold and you'd sink into the water and ooze up to your waist,''
he said.
   Day believed Christmas trees would do the job, but he didn't
think he could get enough of them. The Nature and Science Center
put out the word, however, and the trees came pouring in.
   There was so much interest, the project was expanded this year.
Instead of making people haul their shedding trees to the Nature
Center, curbside pickups were organized.
   ``We get more than we can use,'' Thomas said. ``We only have
funding to put in 12,000 trees and a lot of people are disappointed
when their tree just gets left for the trash.''
   Contractors sank posts into the marsh, and the trees, some still
twinkling with strands of tinsel, are laid between the posts. A
fence is placed on top of the trees, said Gretchen Binet, the St.
Charles Parish official who oversees the swamp work.
   ``It will affect 6,000 acres of marsh when it's done. We can see
results already,'' Binet said. ``It's damping the wave action,
protecting the shoreline. You can see the sediment around the
fences already. Instead of washing away it's growing there.''
   The state spent $35,800 to stack the trees into the fences that
were set up last year. Other costs are minimal, said William
Conner, an assistant at the Coastal Ecology Institute.
   Landfill owners have helped collect the trees, and duck hunters
help place the trees in the swamps, Conner said.
   Preliminary studies are being compiled, he said. So far, they
think the trees help, but they're still unsure how much.
   ``You can see the sediment around the fences. Mud flats are
being created. It looks very hopeful. You can see the buildup, but
we don't know how fast it will work,'' Conner said.
   He hopes that sediment will cover the trees completely before
they decompose, making a long-term barrier.
   ``The areas we're working in were once marsh, but are now open
water,'' Conner said. ``We hope to see grass take root and a marsh
established again. It could be one of the best presents ever left
by a Christmas tree if it works.''

<TEXT>
   Those who fancy this seaside
community as an artist colony replaced banners depicting holly,
carolers and sleigh bells with slick holiday fare of dolphins, kelp
and gulls.
   The first of 225 banners were fastened to lampposts near the
entrance to the Santa Monica Pier on Tuesday morning.
   ``They wouldn't make much sense in Toronto or Cincinnati or Des
Moines, but they make a lot of sense here at the city by the bay,''
said artist Laddie John Dill during unveiling of the arty lamp pole
decorations.
   Word spread this week that the new banners were going up and
telephones began ringing incessantly at Santa Monica Area Chamber
of Commerce offices.
   The marine theme was too much of a departure from the religious
significance of the season, residents complained. The Chamber of
Commerce was taking Christ out of Christmas and the Santa out of
Santa Monica.
   ``Most of the calls involved concern we had done away with the
traditional Christmas decorations,'' said chamber president Duane
Nightengale. The chamber sponsored the $15,000 replacement project.
   ``The traditional decorations are going to be up as well,'' said
the chamber's Dave Paradis.
   It is true the carolers, holly and bells on the old banners are
gone, Nightengale said, but the Nativity scene still adorns
Palisades Park and garland has been strung up at Fourth Street and
Wilshire Boulevard.
   Michael Segal, who headed the design project as a member of the
chamber's central business district advisory group, said the
``strong marine motif'' captured the city's uniqueness.
   ``The kelp gives a mistletoe feeling, the dolphins are in a
wreath design and the gull looks like a Christmas dove of peace,''
Segal said.
   Adding to the holiday ambiance of gulls, kelp and sea mammals
were the words ``Peace,'' ``Friendship'' and ``Joy.''
   Dill designed the 3-foot-by-7-foot banners with graphic artist
John Van Hamersveld. ``They look like greeting cards, don't they?''
asked Hamersveld.
   ``I wanted something that was more tailored to Santa Monica ...
which has become the arts center of California,'' added Dill.
   Soviet emigre Suzy Hartwick, squinting on a sunny day at the
edge of the continent, smiled and said, ``They are very nice. I
love Christmas. It reminds me of home when I had a home.''

RE-CREATING CHRISTMASES OF THE PAST;

<P>
HOLIDAYS: MANY HISTORIC RANCHOS AND MANSIONS WILL FEATURE DECORATIONS AND

The idea of sharing, woven throughout our holiday customs, was evident in the 
Southland even a century or more ago. Today, many ranchos and historic mansions 
re-create this spirit of giving at Christmastime in festivities open to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
The vast open fields surrounding them are long gone, victims to housing tracts 
and shopping malls. But many of the stately homes belonging to the Southland's 
early families still stand, decked out for the holiday season in motifs 
diligently researched from written and oral history. 
</P>
<P>
For Pamela Young, curator at Rancho Los Alamitos in Long Beach, the weeks 
before the annual holiday open house at the historical rancho are hectic. The 
house must be decorated with fresh greens, flowers, and fruit. Following the 
tradition of the Bixby family, who lived on the rancho, a 16-foot tree must be 
cut down to fit the 10-foot-high ceiling in the living room, because they liked 
the bushy effect of the full branches. 
</P>
<P>
Actors and other volunteers from the Long Beach area are recruited to play 
Bixby family members and friends who might have attended Christmas Eve 
festivities there in 1923. Hundreds of cookies must be ordered, and gallons of 
mulled cranberry punch must be brewed.

"Our goal is to re-create the feeling of hospitality that existed on the 
ranch," Young says. "There was a tradition of a Christmas Eve party for ranch 
employees, family and friends. I hope the visitors will leave this year's open 
house with a feeling of having had a warm, happy experience and several years 
from now will remember the event with nostalgia." 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Los Alamitos, "Company for Christmas," 6400 Bixby Hill Road, Long Beach, 
(213) 431-3541. Open house Wednesday through Friday, 6-8:30 p.m.; also Dec. 10, 
noon-4 p.m. Reservations are a must. 
</P>
<P>
At the Newland House in Huntington Beach, docent training chairman Marsha 
Johnston said: "We want our guests to feel the warmth of Christmas as it would 
have been celebrated by a pioneer family at the turn of the century. Mrs. 
Newland used to can the produce of the 500-acre ranch and make relishes and 
preserves. She and her daughters would pack baskets to take to neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, people socialized and sang carols. "We want to show 
how a small community worked together in the past," says Jo Anne 
Viserta-Galinis, keeper of the country store at Newland House. 
</P>
<P>
This Christmas, the Newland House will be decorated with antique and replica 
dolls and toys. Greens will festoon the pictures in the dining room and parlor. 
The table will be set with the original Newland family's red and white 
ironstone china. 
</P>
<P>
"We cheat a little," Viserta-Galinis says. "We aren't sure that the Newlands 
had a Christmas tree, but we know people now want to see a tree, so we'll have 
one in the parlor." 
</P>
<P>
 Newland House, 19820 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach, (714) 962-4112. Dec. 15, 
costumed docents interpret the history of the city's oldest residence at a 
special open house, 7:30-9 p.m. $2 donation. The 1898 farm home will be 
decorated for Christmas from Wednesday on. Open Wednesday-Thursday 2-4:30; open 
Saturday-Sunday noon-4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
At the Workman-Temple Family Homestead in the City of Industry, authenticity is 
the objective of the holiday decor. 
</P>
<P>
"When you pass through the gates of La Casa Nueva, you enter the 1920s, circa 
1928," says Max van Balgooy, director of education and public affairs for the 
Homestead Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Both indoors and outdoors, the Spanish-colonial revival mansion will be 
decorated to portray a party in progress -- a tea honoring guests from Chicago 
visiting the Temple family for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
In the living room, the ceiling-high tree will be trimmed with crepe paper, 
blown glass and homemade ornaments fashioned from light bulbs painted black and 
coated with glitter. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a fantasy look popular in the late 1920s," says van Balgooy. "We 
learned how to make the ornaments from an old copy of Popular Mechanics. 
Visitors may be surprised to see garlands of artificial greens. In the late 
'20s there was a conservation movement that tried to keep people from denuding 
the local hillsides of greenery." 
</P>
<P>
Visitors will sip tea laced with flavorings popular in the '20s -- candied 
ginger, rum balls, gum drops and loaf sugar. 
</P>
<P>
Van Balgooy is looking forward to portraying a character, Bob Lambert, at the 
tea. 
</P>
<P>
"Researching and creating the character has made me study the period," he says. 
"I'm going to try to incorporate typical sayings such as 'Jeepers.' I'm not an 
actor, but it's fun to step back in time and become someone else. I like Bob." 
</P>
<P>
Workman and Temple Family Homestead Museum, 15415 E. Don Julian Road, City of 
Industry, (818) 968-8492. "Mistletoe and Holly-Berries Christmas Tea" Dec. 10, 
1-6 p.m. A 1928 afternoon tea. Free, but advance reservations required. Holiday 
tours Tuesday-Friday, 1-4 p.m. and Saturday-Sunday, 10 a.m.-4 p.m. between next 
Saturday and Jan. 7. Reservations suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Living history is also a part of the festivities at the Los Cerritos Adobe in 
Long Beach, originally part of a large sheep ranch that belonged to another 
branch of the Bixby family. 
</P>
<P>
"We are aiming toward an entertaining and educational look at Victorian times 
on an isolated ranch," says Steve Iverson, curator. "We want to re-create 
Christmas 1878, because from our research we know that 1878 was the first time 
in many years Mrs. Bixby was able to celebrate the holiday with all of her 
sisters and her father." 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the annual open house will be greeted by the blacksmith and the 
ranch foreman, who are busy repairing the wagon, which, according to family 
records, broke down while bringing the Christmas tree to the ranch in 1878. 
</P>
<P>
From the blacksmith's workshop, visitors will troop to the dining room where 
they will see costumed actors packing gifts for the Basque and Mexican 
sheepherders who must spend Christmas Day in the fields. The room is decorated 
with greenery, wreaths and a kissing ball over the table. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors will nibble on lumberjacks (a New England molasses cookie) and Boston 
cookies (a type of sugar cookie), both washed down with spiced hot cider. 
</P>
<P>
"We want visitors to Los Cerritos adobe to go away with the idea that our 
values today are similar to those of a century ago," says Ellen Calomiris, 
director. "People still celebrate the holiday with family and friends. They 
think of others in need and want to do something for them." 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Los Cerritos, 4600 Virginia Road, Long Beach, (213) 424-9423. "Deck the 
Halls for an 1870's Christmas," Friday and next Saturday, 6:30-8:30 p.m.; 
reservations required. Immediately before the two open houses, the ranch will 
offer its traditional free pinata party for young children 6-6:30 p.m. The 
adobe will close for that half-hour. No reservation required for Dec. 10 open 
house 1-4 p.m. Donation $2; children 5 and younger free. 
</P>
<P>
According to some scholars, the traditions of Yankee settlers in early 
California replaced the customs of the Mexican and Spanish colonial period. 
Richard Senate, site manager of Olivas adobe in Ventura, says: "Prior to 1900, 
Hispanic customs were considered old-fashioned and undesirable." 
</P>
<P>
"In the early 1920s, there was a romanticization of the Hispanic culture of 
early California," says Dr. Michael Heisley, curator of folklore at Southwest 
Museum. "There was a revival of Spanish-colonial architecture. Elements of 
authenticity and imagination combined to make a fantasy heritage." 
</P>
<P>
Senate says the Olivas adobe aims for authenticity in the annual re-enactment 
of Las Posadas, a procession commemorating the journey of Joseph and Mary 
through Bethlehem in search of lodging. 
</P>
<P>
"People have told us that our posadas resemble what they have seen in Mexico 
and Latin America," Senate says. "We try to keep them as traditional as 
possible. The candlelight procession resembles an opera. All the words are sung 
in Spanish. Some people have complained about the darkness, but I feel that the 
candlelight gives visitors a feeling of the rural environment and adds to the 
mystical quality of the evening. We want people to know that there's more than 
one way to celebrate Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Senate says that early in the 19th Century, an adobe rancho home would be 
decorated with a nacimiento, small statues portraying the Nativity scene. 
Christmas celebrations would begin with the saint's day of the Virgin of 
Guadalupe, Dec. 18. The posadas would begin nine days before Christmas. Gifts 
would be given to the children on Jan. 6 (Twelfth Night). 
</P>
<P>
Olivas Adobe, 4200 Olivas Park Drive, Ventura, (805) 644-4346. Las Posadas Dec. 
16, 7-9 p.m. Actors will dress in 19th-Century Mexican attire. Visitors are 
encouraged to dress in ponchos or typical attire. Traditional refreshments 
served. A shuttle bus will transport visitors from Olivas Park Golf Course to 
the house. Event will be canceled if it rains. Free. 
</P>
<P>
Every year since 1968, George and Vivian Obern have been hosts for an open 
house at the Hope mansion in Santa Barbara. It was built in 1878 as the center 
of Hope Ranch, a 4,000-acre sheep ranch. In 1967, the Oberns bought the house, 
then in a state of disrepair, as a 25th wedding anniversary gift to one 
another. Although they have never lived in the house, they have restored it to 
its original Victorian splendor. 
</P>
<P>
"We started the open house as a Christmas present to our neighborhood," Vivian 
Obern said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope House, 399 Nogal Drive, Santa Barbara, off Hollister Avenue at the end of 
State Street, (805) 682-3175 . Open house Dec. 10, 1-4 p.m. Free. 
</P>
<P>

DIANNE KLEIN: IT'S FOR WOMEN -- CHRISTMASES PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dianne Klein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My husband announced the other night that he had bought my Christmas present. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, you can always take it back," he added next. 
</P>
<P>
Usually he delivers that thoughtful line as he hands me the gift itself, so 
this represents a progression. 
</P>
<P>
Who knows, maybe this time when he gives me the present the sales receipt will 
be tucked next to the bow -- just to make things simpler, more streamlined. 
</P>
<P>
I've noticed that this has emerged as a general pattern in my husband's holiday 
habits over the past few years. He's cutting back, unilaterally. 
</P>
<P>
Recently he announced over lunch with friends that all of his Christmas 
shopping was done. When I heard him say this, I turned, incredulously at first, 
thinking about my sister's husband, my father, his mother, not to mention my 
own mother, but then I stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Of course he's done. He's a man. 
</P>
<P>
Men don't do Christmas shopping, not really, not in the sense of making lists 
and checking them twice and certainly not if they have wives or girlfriends. 
</P>
<P>
Men say things like, "The mall's too crowded" or "I don't know what to get," 
and with such penetrating insights, they excuse themselves. ("And besides, it's 
Saturday. There's a game on!" some have been known to add). 
</P>
<P>
So instead, they'll ask the women they know to pick up something for their 
mother, their father, brother, nieces, nephews, sister and grandmother -- since 
you're going anyway -- and these women will nod, maybe even smile. They will 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
I know about this, you understand. I am one of the biggest suckers around. 
</P>
<P>
Let me say right here that I am not a woman with a lot of spare time on her 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
I do not relish crowds, or waiting in line 15 minutes at the cash register, or 
going upstairs to customer service for a box, which usually doesn't fit anyway, 
and then like a rabbit leading the greyhounds, enticing at least one cruising 
motorist to follow me so closely toward my parked car that a front tire comes 
within inches of clipping my heel. 
</P>
<P>
But I go. I shop, box and wrap. This year, my husband mailed. I asked him to. I 
had more shopping to do. 
</P>
<P>
So why do I do this? I am a feminist. I believe in equality of the sexes, equal 
pay for equal work. And when has my husband ever shopped for my relatives? Try 
never. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, I've been asking around. Not one woman friend of mine can remember a 
time when her husband or boyfriend went on a solo shopping spree for her 
relatives. Forget about them actually doing it, but an offer might be nice. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings me to another holiday truth, one that I am not entirely proud of. 
As much as women may complain about doing it all themselves, there is a certain 
perverse joy to it. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas is supposed to be infused with that warm, fuzzy feeling. Everybody 
expects this and women, usually, make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
We shop, bake Christmas cookies, thread banisters with ropes of fake pine 
needles, heap holly and pine cones atop mantles and dangle mistletoe over 
doorways. 
</P>
<P>
Men sometimes string lights and pick up a carton of eggnog at the supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, no doubt about it, this is a sexist, inequitable distribution of labor. 
But at least women are in control, thank God. 
</P>
<P>
One friend of mine, a professional woman with a 14-year-old son, says she's 
been orchestrating Christmas all of her married life. She doesn't particularly 
enjoy it, she explains, but she married young and didn't know any better. Now 
she knows too much. 
</P>
<P>
Lord knows what kind of presents her husband would come back with if he were 
set loose in the mall. Better she should do it herself than be mortified by 
gifts that will bear her name too. 
</P>
<P>
Another working mother says she addresses all of her family's Christmas cards, 
including those mailed to business acquaintances she has never met, because 
even her doctor has better handwriting than her husband does. 
</P>
<P>
And one woman I talked to is still buying the gifts for her in-laws even though 
she and her husband of 16 years have recently divorced. (Obviously, this is a 
clinical case.) 
</P>
<P>
As for my own husband, while Santa's helper he is not, I don't mean to imply 
that he's some sort of Scrooge either. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, in fact, he really went out on a limb. While I was taking a nap 
after an exhausting morning of shopping, he brought home a Christmas tree and 
set it up in the living room. This was supposed to be a nice gesture, in the 
spirit of the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
But when I came down the stairs, not only was I surprised, I was stunned. Keep 
in mind that I was barely awake, so I wasn't in full command of my senses. 
</P>
<P>
I told him that the tree looked, uh, a little small and suffice to say, he did 
not take it well. He told me that I could go out and get my own tree, which, 
true to my Christmas nature, I did. 
</P>
<P>
I dragged off his tree, shoved it in the back of the station wagon, returned 
it, bought a new one and installed it in the living room -- all by myself. When 
it was done, I was tired, scratched, cold and not very happy. 
</P>
<P>
But I was back in control. And I have to admit, it felt good. 
</P>

   Shawn Pryer and Jennifer Crandon had
planned to get married next summer but they decided a Christmas
surprise for their parents would be more fun.
   So the northeast Kansas couple bypassed their church and took the
minister along as they headed out Thursday to Santa's house at the
Manhattan Town Center Mall.
   The former Miss Crandon, 23, who works at a hair salon at the
mall, wore a long white dress with train and veil. Santa wore red as
he gave her away.
   ``We just like doing stuff that's unique and fun,'' Pryer said
Friday. ``And we'd never heard of anyone doing something like this
before.''
   He said the couple planned to go home Christmas Eve and tell
their parents.
   ``It's like a Christmas present to both sets of parents,'' said
Pryer, 21, a student at Kansas State University. ``We're just going
to wait and see whether they notice (the rings).''

   Although chances for snow were slim in the
Indianapolis area, at least one local youngster will have a white
Christmas.
   Cara Curtis, 10, earned the honor when she won the city
Department of Parks and Recreation's first Wishing for a Winter
Wonderland essay contest.
   A dump truck pulled up in front of her family's home Friday
morning, and delivered ice shavings that had been collected at the
city's two ice rinks.
   Cara and her friends raced through the man-made snow, slipping
and sliding and making snowballs _ one of which landed squarely on
the nose of Mayor William H. Hudnut III.
   Cara's winning essay selected from 1,044 entries talked about the
magical qualities of snow.
   ``You can pretend that you are trudging through the arctic with
penguins sliding into the sparkling water when you play in the snow.
Or you can travel to an enchanted land or become an Olympic figure
skater swishing around on the glittering ice.''

   Her home was gutted by a fire blamed on a
short in Christmas tree lights, but Diana Bojorquez said the holiday
has been salvaged by the generosity of others.
   Even as the fire burned Thursday morning, people began offering
help, Ms. Bojorquez said Friday.
   ``Maybe it's because it's the Christmas season,'' she said. ``It
started when we were standing outside watching our home burn. People
gave us clothing and my daughter a pair of shoes right there.
   A collection among city workers in this community 200 miles north
of Los Angeles produced $575 in cash, furniture and a 15-pound
Christmas turkey for Ms. Bojorquez and her 7-year-old daughter,
Adrienne.
   ``It's going to be a nice Christmas after all,'' Ms. Bojorquez
said.

   Some truck stops in Georgia are providing
Christmas trees, decorations and a variety of holiday treats to help
cheer up lonely drivers who cannot be with their families.
   At the Perlis Truckstop along Interstate 75 in central Georgia,
truckers will be greeted by Santa Claus and free Christmas dinners,
said general manager Leon Perlis.
   ``They're very appreciative of it,'' he added. ``Most of them are
feeling poorly because they're not at home on Christmas.''
   John Lee, restaurant shift manager at the Truckstops Of America
location in Conley, said his truck stop would provide a free buffet
meal that includes turkey, chicken, ham, stuffing, yams and pumpkin
pie.
   ``We appreciate them,'' Lee said. ``We're not a greedy outfit.
We're just trying to say `Happy Holiday.' They've got to have a
place when they're away from home.''

   There's no Santa Claus in Oregon.
   There is a Christmas Creek, Christmas Lake, Christmas Lake
Valley, Christmas Valley, Noel Creek and Mistletoe. But Santa Claus
is in Indiana.
   There are at least 88 places nationwide with Christmas in the
name, according to the Geographic Names Information System developed
by the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Board on Geographic Names.
   There also are several Santa Clauses, a smattering of Noels and
an occasional Holly or Carol or Star or Holiday among the 2 million

   A father is keeping alive the memory of his
dead son with acts of Christmas kindness for residents of a school
for the retarded.
   C.J. Moore, 58, collects and recycles about 10 tons of aluminum
cans a year so he can treat residents of the Hammond State School to
dinner and presents.
   C.J. Moore III, or Jay, was 16 when he died eight years ago. He
was retarded, but never stayed at the Hammond State School.
   Moore and his wife, Gloria, held their first party at the school
about 10 years ago, using money he earned by walking the highways
picking up aluminum cans and stashing bags of them in the woods
until he could bring his pickup truck around. He owned his own scrap
metal company.
   Now, diabetes keeps him from walking much, and he relies on other
people to donate cans at collection bins at grocery stores, camp
grounds and in his front yard in Hammond, 35 miles northwest of New
Orleans.
   Some 40 residents of the school receive a box of candy, a dollar
bill and other gifts adding up to $35.
   ``You might say, `Well, that ain't many,' but when you've got to
wrap 320 gifts, it is,'' Moore said.

   Some people claim to like fruitcake, so maybe there are
even fans who cheer the annual December ritual of lawsuits
challenging public displays of creches and menorahs. Still,
maybe next year the American Civil Liberties Union could just
send out greeting cards to mark the season the way the rest
of us do.
   The ACLU has managed to get the Supreme Court to rule
often enough in cases over the years that by now no one knows
when a holiday display supposedly violates the Establishment
Clause. The justices seem to require some secular quota for
any exhibit of religion. Cities spend the other 11 months
considering whether to show the Three Wise Men riding into
town on plastic reindeer or maybe erect a Frosty the Snowman
to light the menorah.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This year's lawsuits include one that began before
Christmas 1989. The ACLU challenged the right of Ottawa,
Illinois, to display 16 paintings depicting the life of
Christ in a public park. The lawsuit dragged on so long that
the city and the local Jaycees who organized the exhibit
dropped out of the case, transferring the display to another
group that agreed to defend it in court. San Diego is
considering privatization as a solution to the church-state
problem that a federal court said was created by crosses atop
Mount Soledad and Mount Helix, longtime symbols of the city.
The question in Casper, Wyoming, is whether a creche is
secular enough if there's also a Christmas tree and an
ice-skating display.
   The good news is that even the ACLU has its limits. The
Washington Post reported that an anxious parent asked the
local branch office to sue a school for daring to include
"Christmas, holly and mistletoe" on a spelling test. The
ACLU's Arthur Spitzer told the parent that there was no
constitutional problem here. "We decided not to take any
action," Mr. Spitzer said. "And people say the ACLU has no
judgment." Have a very merry holiday, Mr. Spitzer.

first of the spring flowers -- the narcissus -- have started to come up. The
last of the fall fruit -- the persimmons -- are still on the trees. And the
last rose of summer continues to bloom its heart out.;   Wacky?  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  SPIRIT OF RESILIENCE SHINES IN CALIFORNIA  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Commentary; Witt is a free-lance writer living in Oakland.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Yep, just like all us folks who live out here. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
At least you'd think we're the fruitcake state if you believe all the rude
things the national media have said about California's sanity in the past two
years.;   First, they questioned the wisdom of our rebuilding in earthquake
country after 1989's World Series shaker. Then they -- our fellow Americans
"Back East," as virtually all West Coasters call any place east of Sparks,
Nev. -- slandered us for continuing to sing California's praises after the
Great Oakland Hills Fire.;   Time magazine devoted one of its apocalyptic
cover stories to us. And some shrew phoned a radio call-in show to gloat, "You
Californians hang yourselves. You live like you are in some Hollywood script,
and now the chickens have come home to roost.";   All those Back Easters
missed the point. Which is -- it takes a certain spirit to live here. You
either got it. Or you don't. In which case you probably didn't emigrate here
to begin with.;   Case in point A: our friends Brenda and Bill. Their
Christmas card this year is one of those photo cards with a preprinted
message. "Somehow 'Joy' just didn't seem quite right," Brenda told me with a
wicked grin. "So I picked 'From our house to yours.' ";   I snapped the
picture for them -- the day their kids came home from college to view what was
left of their house. Or rather, what wasn't left after the firestorm.;   The
family is standing in a row in front of the fireplace -- like many another
Christmas card pictures. Only the fireplace is perched on a column of bricks
about 10 feet above where they are standing -- in what probably had been the
downstairs bath, before the upstairs and roof came crashing down.;   No, "Joy"
wouldn't have been quite right this year, but it wouldn't have been all wrong
either.;   Case in point B: Ethel Golder, a white-haired elder sitting at the
next table at one of those wonderful California neighborhood places where
patrons can lunch outside every day on the deck. Unless it rains. Which it
hardly ever has in the past five years. Which is one reason we had such a
terrible fire.;   "I thought my next adventure would be the great hereafter,"
Mrs. Golder remarked. "Now this." She said it with a wide smile and an even
wider gesture that seemed to embrace the challenges ahead.;   Case C: Fire
victims Valma King, 101, and her 95-year-old sister Iola Imhof lost incredible
things when their house near the Claremont Hotel burned. Newspaper clippings
of their father's shoot-out in Texas with outlaw Billy the Kid. A tintype of
an uncle who served on the Union ironclad the Monitor. A gunpowder horn their
great-great-great-grandfather used at the battle of Lexington and Concord.;  
"It's dirty pool to do this to us at this time of our lives," the elder sister
told the Oakland Tribune, then added, "Ah well, 'gone with the wind.' ";   One
last case: Brenda's next-door neighbor, an octogenarian who had built his
little house more than a half-century ago for his bride.;   All of this is to
say that somehow it has been very reassuring to be a Californian this
particular Christmas season. The nation may be deep in recession, but here we
have rediscovered the resilience of human beings.;   To celebrate life in the
darkest days of winter is an old family tradition -- a human family tradition.
Our pagan ancestors did it with mistletoe. In Oakland this year, we may be
celebrating with poppies and lupines. Within days of the fire, the same
helicopters that scooped water out of lakes to quench October's blaze were
dropping seeds on the blackened hillsides, which now are turning green.;  
Which is a sure sign of Christmas in California.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  THIS is the start of the holiday party season, that frightening time of year
when many of us are forced to sip watery eggnog and mingle in stuffy
wood-paneled basements adorned with velvet Elvis paintings while a scratchy
rendition of "Jingle Bell Rock" plays maddeningly in the background.;   Sadly,

<HEADLINE>  THE HOLIDAY PARTY: WHAT'S TO HO-HO-HO ABOUT?  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cowherd is a columnist for the Baltimore Evening Sun.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Gone are the wonderful parties where drunks reeled about spouting
gibberish, your tipsy neighbor would brush against the chafing dish and set
her dress on fire, and at least one couple feverishly groped under the coats
in the upstairs bedroom.;   In fact, if you attempt to have a good time by
drinking, eating or (God forbid) smoking with gusto at a party today, a member
of the Health Gestapo will no doubt tap you on the shoulder and politely (but
firmly) remind you that your behavior is incredibly self-destructive -- and
that you would be far better off with a bottle of Evian and something from the
fresh vegetable tray.;   Unfortunately, there is rarely a broom handle nearby
with which to deliver a crisp whack across the knees of this person. So what I
do is quickly reach for the fireplace poker and jab the person sharply in the
stomach, making it clear that his or her views on non-alcoholic beverages and
low-calorie snacks are not compatible with my own.;   In any event, here are a
few recommendations for the holiday host and hostess:;   Here is my feeling on
mistletoe. If you have to put it up, for God's sake, let's not make a big deal
about it. And let's not start with that kissing nonsense if someone steps
under it, either. Please. Don't make me use this poker again.;   A personal
aside to the inevitable dieter at the party: No one wants to hear about it,
OK? No one wants to hear a lot of whining about how you're blowing your diet
and will probably hate yourself in the morning. Hey, I'm starting to hate you
right now. If you can't handle all the food, go lock yourself in the hall
closet until this is over. We'll knock on the door when it's time to clean
up.;   Please (and I'm down on my knees now), no tiny paper plates for the
food. This is a pet peeve of mine. Instead of those miniature plates designed
for the Keebler Elves, let's break out some plates that an adult would use.
That way your guests can help themselves to more than one meatball at a time
without resorting to putting the rest in their pockets, the way I do.;  
Speaking of meatballs, not everybody in the world is watching their weight,
OK? Honestly, I have been at parties where the spread looks like something
served in a cell on Devil's Island. So in addition to the carrots, celery
sticks, bean sprouts, etc., don't be afraid to lay out real food: Buffalo
wings, taco dips, mozzarella sticks, the whole song and dance.;   Sure, you'll
probably have a half-dozen people keel over in the driveway from arterial
blockage, but at least they'll check out with smiles on their faces.;   Let's
take it easy with the Christmas music. I can't stress this enough. After
listening over and over and over again to "The Twelve Days of Christmas," many
people develop a painful throbbing in their temples. Others become so
disoriented that they will stagger outside, take off their clothes and lie in
the middle of the street.;   Even worse are those parties when the hostess
suddenly gets a crazed look in her eyes and chirps: "Hey-y-y-y, everybody!
I've got an idea! Let's all sing Christmas carols!";   Hoo, boy. Next thing
you know, she's herding everyone in front of the piano to sing "Frosty the
Snowman" or some equally sappy tune. From there the party degenerates until it
resembles a Perry Como Family Christmas on mescaline.;   Know when to bow out
of a conversation. If you're talking to someone and his eyes start to close
and his chin begins to droop until -- bang! -- his head smashes into the
coffee table, it is a fairly safe bet that this person is tiring of the
conversation.;   Even with words, know when to say when.  </TEXT>

FT  22 DEC 92 / Farmer's Viewpoint: Mr Boardman hopes for a season to be
jolly - Britain's only professional grower finds the holly business
profitable but risky
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONG BEFORE the word diversification had any obvious relevance to farming, a
young friend of mine decided he would earn a bit of extra Christmas income
from selling sprigs of holly from the trees in the hedgerows on his farm. He
had cashed in on them modestly before when he had allowed gypsies to trim
his trees for a few pound notes. But this time, he decided he would retail
his crop in the local town and maximise his returns.
Previous experience had taught him that the berries on his holly trees were
particularly attractive to hungry birds. So, to deny them the opportunity of
ruining his enterprise by eating his profits, he went out with his pruning
shears while the trees were full of red berries in early November.
It happened to be a very good year and he was thrilled at the quantity of
full-berried holly he was able to cut. But there is no market for the stuff
until a couple of weeks before Christmas, so to protect it against predatory
birds he carefully carted it all down into the cellar of his old farmhouse.
For the following few chilly weeks he took enormous pleasure in watching
hordes of songbirds fluttering around his neighbours' holly trees. Every
berry they ate, he thought, would increase the value of his cellarful of
perfection. Indeed he spent many winter evenings calculating the size of the
windfall that would be his and working out how to spend it. Eventually, in
the middle of December, he judged the time was right to bring up the holly
and make a killing on the market. But when he went to collect it from its
hiding place he discovered to his horror that while he may have stopped the
birds from eating his berries he had forgotten about the mice in his cellar.
They had clearly enjoyed an early Christmas dinner and scoffed the lot.
Last week I visited a professional holly grower. Indeed he claims to be the
only one in Britain. His holly trees were an imaginative gift, in 1938, from
his late father. He has over 1,000 of them on 3 acres of his 200-acre
(80-hectare) fruit and arable farm and he can identify and name in excess of
100 different holly species that are growing there.
His name is Peter Boardman and his farm overlooks the valley of the Ant at
How Hill, one of the most beautiful spots in the Norfolk Broads.
Throughout his life he has studied holly in Britain and abroad. He has
propagated dozens of different varieties, both the plain green-leaved and
variegated, and many imported from other countries, in an experimental
corner of his farm near the house. He talks knowledgeably about them; about
the need for a few male, non-berry bearing trees in a plantation to
pollinate the females, which are the ones with berries, and the fact that it
takes 15 years for a holly tree to produce a viable amount of holly to cut
and market. Even then there is no guarantee that the trees will produce a
full-berried crop each year.
He too has to cut his vulnerable holly early to avoid problems with hungry
birds. But careful observation over many years has shown that only a few
varieties are attractive to them before Christmas, so these are always cut
first. And Mr Boardman's professional way to cut holly and keep it fresh and
bright until the market is ready for it is in a sealed, mouse-free cold
store.
Once Christmas spirit begins to flow, the red-berried sprigs are brought
out, packed in cardboard boxes (of the type usually used for chrysanthemums)
and sent off to wholesale markets around the country. Many go to the New
Covent Garden market at Nine Elms in London and to the new Spitalfields
market. Each box holds about 9 lb of holly in a good year. That is to say
when there are plenty of berries, for they are far heavier than the wood and
the leaves. Mr Boardman expects to receive something over Pounds 1 a lb from
the wholesaler and hopes to harvest a crop of about 1 tonne an acre.
But where does the compulsion to bring expensive, prickly vegetation into
our houses at Christmas time originate? Apparently it comes from a mixture
of pagan and Christian traditions and dates back, at least, to the druids.
They believed its evergreen characteristic meant that the sun never deserted
the holly tree and that it was a sacred plant. It was therefore their custom
to decorate their houses with holly so that woodland spirits might take
refuge in it from the rigours of winter.
On the other hand, some say that holly is a corruption of a Holy in
Christian terms. Moreover the German word for holly is Christdorn and it is
symbolic of the crown of thorns worn by Jesus at Calvary. The berries, the
legend goes, take their red colour from Christ's blood.
Some of the superstitions associated with holly, however, are rather more
secular. For instance, in some parts of England and Germany it is believed
that if rough, prickly holly is brought into a family house the husband will
dominate the home for the year ahead. If the holly has smooth leaves and few
prickles, however, the wife will rule.
Inevitably holly is claimed to have medicinal properties. 'A dozen ripe but
undried berries eaten in the morning', an ancient herbal states, 'will expel
wind and is good for colic'. And American Indians were said to make a kind
of purgative tea with the berries.
Even more horrific to contemplate was the recommendation that to be soundly
thrashed with holly branches was the finest possible cure for chilblains. At
least, I suspect, it would stop a sufferer complaining about them ever
again.
These days medicinal markets do not feature in Peter Boardman's budgets. He
restricts his holly sales to the Christmas period for harmless commemorative
wreaths and decoration. But is it profitable?
On the face of it a potential gross return of well over Pounds 2,000 an acre
seems attractive. But as Mr Boardman points out, it is high risk. For some
years there are no berries and therefore no sales. It is very
labour-intensive and the prickles make cutting rather uncomfortable work.
The market is entirely seasonal and a very short season at that and there is
a 15 year wait, following planting, before there is any return at all.
His greatest competition comes from what I will politely call itinerant
entrepreneurs, who strip and often damage trees, sometimes with permission
and sometimes without, in order to make a fast buck. But the fact that he
alone in the UK has a professional holly garden, and that a small one, is
eloquent testimony to the fact that there is not enough money in it to make
it a reliable farming diversification.

FT  24 DEC 92 / Skiing: Leadville, living on a legend - Arnold Wilson visits
an old mining town which is finding new ways to survive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNOLD WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christmas Eve, 1881. Leadville, Colorado.
'WITH HUGE spruce logs crackling in the fire-place, the scene presented on
this eve of the gladsome Christmas is far from dispiriting. Carroll, warn
out from the day's work, is asleep in his bunk, doubtless dreaming of the
yule log and mistletoe, and fat stockings and plum pudding. Summers and
Temple are enjoying a game of cards called 'hunky-punky' over there by the
fire, and I am not so sure but that their thoughts also are far away,
mingling unconsciously with those of loved ones in distant New England
homes.'
Albert Morrison, a young prospector started this letter to his impoverished
mother and fiancee, Charlotte, in New York State.
'As tomorrow will be Christmas Day,' he wrote, 'I will have plenty of time
to complete this letter . . .'
But the letter never was finished. At one minute after midnight, the shack
shared by four prospectors was enveloped by a snow-slide leaving the men
frozen as in a tableau of life, with Albert's hand still holding his pen.
The scene later described by a rescue party provided an enduring myth for
the highest skiing town in the US.
Some 101 years later, it is a freezing night in Leadville - sometimes known
as the 'city in the clouds'. Ski lift operators from the local resort of Ski
Cooper and further afield at Copper Mountain, Breckenridge and Keystone have
returned to their homes for the night. The ornate, relic-filled and slightly
kitsch Silver Dollar Saloon has emptied on to a street corner. And Attorney
Neil V. Reynolds, the local judge, puts his Holmesian pipe down and picks up
a microphone.
'Ladies and gentleman,' he announces. 'We have just heard that Santa Claus
has arrived in Leadville]'
There are cheers from a smallish crowd of children and parents who have
assembled on the sidewalk outside the white courthouse - all exhaling
dragon's breath as the temperature dives in the town which is perched at
10,150 ft beneath Colorado's highest peaks: Mount Elbert and Mount Massive.
Leadville's Christmas tree - a mere 12ft high - is about to be illuminated.
There is a NASA-style countdown to the big moment.
'Five-four-three-two-one-ZERO]' It is a small flicker for mankind as a score
of tiny - almost pathetic - fairy lights are switched on. The little tree
does not exactly light up the sky. But it is symbolic of a special town. A
town that has twice been left for dead. And twice refused to die.
Leadville - past residents included Jesse James, Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp
 -is one of Colorado's oldest mining centres. In 1893, when along with other
old mining towns which were later to become famous ski resorts, such as
Aspen, Telluride, Crested Butte, Breckenridge, Park City and Alta, Leadville
had its heart torn out by a government decision to end the silver standard.
The boom years of silver were over.
Christmasses in Leadville became bleak: if they were lucky, children
received an orange, a stocking full of candy, a brief chat with Santa Claus
and a visit to the Dreamland or Empire Theatre to see the latest film.
While Breckenridge became an official ghost town, with a population of just
seven, and the other mining towns struggled for survival, the mining
community at Leadville picked themselves up and started again with a
different quarry: molybdenum, used as a strengthening agent in steels.
Molybdenum was certainly a strengthening agent for Leadville. The town
thrived again, until almost exactly a century after the silver crash,
competition from Russia and South Africa, where molybdenum could be produced
more cheaply, brought the town's second mining era to a close.
Today there are still working mines dotted around Colorado, but unlike the
good old bad old days, they are now run by small groups of amateurs, or so
highly mechanised that they no longer provide much employment for
Leadville's close-knit, hardy populace.
What makes Leadville tick and survive today is skiing in winter - and
tourism in summer. Ski Cooper is a fairly small, hillbilly ski area seven
miles from Leadville. At Chicago Ridge, there is some excellent snowcat
skiing on runs such as Leaning Tree Drop-off, Heavenly Traverse, Tree Shots,
Middle Earth and Buckeye Trees.
Richard 'Rocket' Mathews drives the cat and Stu Schaefer guides (they
exchange roles from time to time.) The resort, where troops of Colorado's
celebrated 10th Mountain Division trained during the war, is ideal for
families with its moderately gentle terrain. Apart from weekends, the trails
are empty. So with the once-celebrated mines in California Gulch long since
fallen silent, there are few options for those seeking employment. One is
working in the resorts of Copper, Breckenridge, Keystone and Arapahoe Basin.
There is a housing shortage in those resorts which brings pressure to live
out of town. Leadville, where housing is much cheaper since the mining boom
went bust, is an obvious choice. So daily, mountain staff have to make the
cold and sometimes dangerous journey to and from work. Sometimes the road is
blocked by snow. But however hazardous such commuting may be, nothing
compares with the regular tragedies experienced down the mines. In one
seven-month period during May, 1880, 26 miners were killed and almost 50
seriously injured in accidents.
Of these 62 per cent were 'shaft-related', 26 per cent were caused by
mishandled or faulty explosives, four per cent by cave-ins and rock-falls,
four per cent by fumes, fire and suffocation and a final four per cent by
drowning or crushing. But the death of Albert Morrison and his friends was
perhaps the saddest.
Santa Claus arrives in Leadville this month in a glistening, new fire engine
on which is inscribed: 'Leadville and Lake County Fire &amp; Rescue'. Under the
red costume and white beard is Jim O'Neil, who is 75 and has been playing
the role for decades. Like almost every other elderly man in Leadville, he
used to work at a local mine.
'Now give a big welcome to Santa Claus,' says Judge Reynolds.
Leadville is still searching for its role in the 21st century. With such
resilient folk, Leadville will probably get by for the time being with
skiing and tourism. But if you ask Reynolds what the citizens of Leadville
will do in the long term, now that the mining era is over, he says: 'We
haven't decided yet.'

'It's a mistaken idea that animals know what is poisonous. . . . Unfortunately, 
a number of pets are poisoned by plants, and the diagnosis is missed because 
the unsuspecting owner doesn't realize the pet has ingested a toxic plant. 
</P>
<P>
CHRISTOPHER CAUBLE 
</P>
<P>
Veterinarian 
</P>
<P>
Pets can wreak havoc with a garden. And vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous plants, including many natives and so-called weeds, can be harmful, 
even fatal, to companion animals, and pet-loving gardeners must know which ones 
they are. 
</P>
<P>
"The No. 1 problem plant for toxicity in this region is oleander," said William 
Emboden, a professor of biology at Cal State Northridge and the author of 
numerous botany books. 
</P>
<P>
"Every part of oleander is toxic, even when dried, and ingesting just one leaf 
can even kill a human," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Oleander is a common sight in Southern California because the drought-tolerant 
plant is widely used as a hedge. While small animals usually leave it alone, 
there are many cases of horses and cattle eating oleander. 
</P>
<P>
"Daturas are another species which is deadly, and should be treated with 
extreme caution," Emboden said. 
</P>
<P>
Evergreen shrubs that can be trained to grow as small trees, daturas are also 
known as Angel's Trumpet or Brugmansia and are closely related to the native 
California annuals or perennials, jimson weeds. 
</P>
<P>
The large tubular flowers, usually white, are highly fragrant and very 
poisonous. 
</P>
<P>
"One variety, Datura inoxia, a perennial herbaceous shrub, is the most 
dangerous because the velvety leaves contain toxins at the surface," Emboden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"An animal, or human, can be affected just by touching their leaves. Cats, 
which would not normally eat this plant, can be harmed just by walking by and 
brushing the leaves." 
</P>
<P>
Research during the past decade has revealed that many plants have developed 
the ability to deter insects and herbivorous animals from munching on them by 
developing toxins. In this co-evolution process, the animals have developed 
methods of detoxification to protect themselves from the toxins in the plants 
they do consume. 
</P>
<P>
However, dogs and cats haven't developed these self-protective mechanisms, and 
puppies and kittens, particularly, are at great risk because they explore their 
world with their mouths. 
</P>
<P>
"So many hundreds of plants can be toxic, and as a rule, puppies are more 
aggressive and less discriminating about what they eat, so they're usually at 
risk," said Dr. Francis Galey, a specialist in veterinary toxicology at UC 
Davis. "They will chew on seeds, bulbs, branches, pits, and even leaves." 
</P>
<P>
"Plant toxicity varies according to the season. We get a number of calls at 
Christmas because mistletoe and holly berries are deadly to animals and too 
many people don't know it." 
</P>
<P>
He added that some plants have an undeserved reputation for toxicity. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, poinsettia has been labeled as toxic, but latest research has shown 
that the plant it not highly toxic. However, it does cause vomiting in the 
animals that eat it and for that reason pets should be prevented from access to 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Galey also pointed out that pet owners sometimes become confused when they see 
their pet eating a plant and then vomiting, mistaking an effect for the cause 
of pet poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
"Since dogs and cats will try to ingest grasses or other greenery if they have 
gastrointestinal upsets, which cause them to vomit, the unknowing pet owner may 
think the plant has caused the vomiting when in reality it didn't," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always best to be cautious and check with a veterinarian." 
</P>
<P>
There is a widely held -- but erroneous -- belief that animals possess a native 
wisdom or intuition that keeps them from eating poisonous substances. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mistaken idea that animals know what is poisonous and won't consume 
anything that is," said veterinarian Christopher Cauble, who operates Mobile 
Vet and treats his animal patients in their home environment. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, a number of pets are poisoned by plants, and the diagnosis is 
missed because the unsuspecting owner doesn't realize the pet has ingested a 
toxic plant," he said. "Because I see the animals in their own homes, it's 
possible to determine if the animal is sick because of what it consumed." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, he was called to euthanize a Great Dane dying of kidney failure. The 
dog wasn't responding to medication, and the underlying cause of the kidney 
failure couldn't be determined. The owner didn't want to see his dog suffer any 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were in the garden, deciding on the most suitable spot for burial, I 
spotted large quantities of pigweed and questioned the dog's owner why it was 
growing there," Cauble said. 
</P>
<P>
"He explained that the dog had enjoyed chewing on the plant, and I knew that 
was the source of the problem. The plant contains toxic amounts of oxalates 
that form crystals in the dog's kidneys. Unfortunately, it was too late to cure 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Charla and John Hutcheson were more fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
They live in Arcadia near the Los Angeles County Arboretum, and their garden 
was overrun with gophers. They decided to plant gopher spurge, a type of 
euphorbia. It did rid their garden of gophers, and almost killed their 
3-month-old Tibetan mastiff. 
</P>
<P>
"Because Maharenee chewed everything she could, I didn't permit her in my 
garden alone," Charla Hutcheson said. "I was outside with her, and just took my 
eyes off her for an instant. She consumed half a gopher spurge plant before I 
could stop her. I was uneasy for two days since I knew the plant caused 
hemorrhaging in gophers. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure enough, in just a few days I saw her bloody stools and summoned Dr. 
Cauble to treat her. Fortunately, since we knew the reason for the problem, we 
medicated her and saved her life. But I was annoyed that the mail order company 
that sells this plant claims it won't harm domestic animals. Obviously, that's 
not true." 
</P>
<P>
Since the Hutchesons still needed the gopher spurge to protect their garden, 
they protected Maharenee by building an enclosed patio in which she was 
confined when she wanted to be outside. 
</P>
<P>
Toxicity in plants is complicated by the fact that not all parts of the plants 
may be toxic, or they may be toxic just at certain times of the year. The 
amount consumed is also relevant, for with the exception of oleander (Nerium 
oleander) and castor beans (Ricinus communis), one bite is rarely fatal. 
</P>
<P>
"If a pet owner suspects plant poisoning, it's best to rush the animal to the 
family veterinarian or local emergency pet hospital," advised Dr. Barbara Hook, 
a certified veterinary toxicologist with the Los Angeles County Veterinarian's 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
"People should be aware that there's a big difference between animal and human 
systems, and some surprising things are poisonous to pets. For example, onions 
can be deadly to animals and, of course, are safe for human consumption." 
</P>
<P>
She also suggested that if at all possible, the pet owner should take a sample 
of the vomitus to the veterinarian. "The sample will usually contain the 
ingested plant, and the vet can save valuable time by seeing what actually made 
the animal sick," she said. Take the plant as well for identification. 
</P>
<P>
Although dogs and cats are the most common companion pets, other pets such as 
rabbits, birds and turtles should also be safeguarded from plants that are 
labeled as toxic. While hundreds of plants are considered toxic, the following 
are the most likely to be found in Southern California: 
</P>
<P>
Azaleas and rhododendrons (Rhododendron spp.) -- Large quantities of the green 
leaves must be ingested before lethal poisoning occurs. 
</P>
<P>
Boxwood (Buxus) -- These evergreen shrubs are widely used for hedging and 
edging. All parts are toxic. 
</P>
<P>
Castor bean (Ricinus communis) -- The seeds are very toxic and just two can 
kill a human. Since only the seeds are toxic, this popular, fast-growing shrub 
can be safely included in the garden by removing the flowering head from the 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
Datura -- also known as Angel's Trumpet. All Datura species are poisonous. 
Jimson weed (Datura stramonium) is an abundant native of this region. Its seeds 
are most likely to cause toxicity in pets. 
</P>
<P>
English Ivy (Hedera helix) -- Although both the foliage and fruits are toxic, 
the poisonings reported have been from the fruits. 
</P>
<P>
Heavenly bamboo (Nandina domestica) -- The leaves contain cyanide. 
</P>
<P>
Larkspur (Delphinium) -- All species of larkspur and delphinium should be 
considered poisonous. The plants are most toxic in their early growth and seed 
stages. 
</P>
<P>
Monkshood (Aconitum napellus) -- Also known as wolf bane, it was cultivated in 
Europe for centuries and used to poison wolves. 
</P>
<P>
Oleander (Nerium oleander) -- Because oleander is bitter, animals rarely eat 
it. But puppies and kittens may be at risk if allowed to play among its dried 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Ornamental tobacco (Nicotiana) -- Nicotiana is a fragrant flowering ornamental 
in the tobacco family that, although toxic, rarely causes death in the animal 
ingesting it because the nicotine is absorbed slowly in the body. 
</P>
<P>
Oxalis -- There are many varieties of this low-growing perennial, and one is 
such an aggressive grower in this region that it's considered a weed. All 
species contain oxalates. 
</P>
<P>
Pigweed (Amaranthus spp.) -- A member of the Amaranth family, grown for 
ornamental leaves and grain, Pigweed is considered a weed and contains 
oxalates. 
</P>
<P>
Purple foxglove (Digitalis purpurea) -- the leaves are poisonous. 
</P>
<P>
Spurges (Euphorbiaceae) -- Besides gopher spurge, other types of euphorbia are 
poisonous. Perhaps the most widely known is poinsettia. Its milky sap irritates 
skin and gastrointestinal tracts of puppies, kittens, and birds. 
</P>
<P>
Yew (Taxus spp.) -- Both the foliage and twigs are toxic. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, many popular garden ornamentals are grown from bulbs or corms, 
and these can be poisonous. The bulbs of tulips, daffodils, amaryllis and iris 
should be stored and planted where pets can't have access to them. 
</P>
<P>
New research reveals that feeding avocados to birds, rabbits and cats can cause 
severe toxic reactions, and even death in birds. Apricot and peach pits contain 
cyanide, and pets should never be allowed to consume them. 
</P>
<P>
Some vegetables too can be toxic to animals. These include spinach, rhubarb 
stalks, potato vines, onions and tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
One of the main reasons poisoning by plants goes undetected in companion 
animals is that it's difficult to diagnose by symptoms alone. Different plant 
toxins affect the gastrointestinal system, the nervous system, or the 
circulatory system. 
</P>
<P>
Also, pets are poisoned more often by insect or rodent poisons than they are by 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
But with careful planning, it's possible to enjoy gardens and pets without harm 
to either. Know what you grow, and as a general precaution, don't permit pets 
free access to a garden containing any plants that can be potentially harmful 
to them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Toxic Plants in the Home 
</P>
<P>
Some houseplants can also be toxic. Kittens and cats confined indoors are at 
risk because they're likely to chew plant leaves when they're bored, playing or 
even teething. Puppies will also consume plants, in addition to other prized 
household items. 
</P>
<P>
Pet birds will also spend a good deal of their time chewing, tasting and 
nibbling. If they have access to plants, they'll include them in their 
explorations. 
</P>
<P>
The following houseplants are considered toxic: Cutleaf philodendron, 
dieffenbachia (dumb cane), elephant ear (taro), eucalyptus (dried or partially 
dried, which are dyed or chemically treated for flower arrangements), holly, 
mistletoe, philodendrons, poinsettia and pyracantha.

FAMILIES GET TIPS ON COPING WITH ALZHEIMER'S DURING HOLIDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The elderly Hollywood man was talking about Thanksgiving at a recent workshop 
on helping families cope with Alzheimer's disease during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"The holidays are great," said the man, 80, who takes care of his 
Alzheimer's-afflicted wife of 51 years. Thanksgiving is not only good for the 
person with the disease, he said, "it's also good for the care-giver because it 
gives them a chance to relax with other people." 
</P>
<P>
The man smiled. And then he burst into tears. 
</P>
<P>
The holidays are often hellish for families dealing with Alzheimer's and other 
conditions that produce dementia or loss of cognitive abilities. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood man, for instance, was uncertain whether he and his spouse would 
be able to join their son in San Diego for Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
His wife has been suffering from a bladder infection recently, and her 
progressive brain disorder is constantly producing new deficits and 
complications. Since she became ill, the woman is anxious whenever she travels. 
Her husband worried that the unfamiliar pounding of the wheels of the train 
would unnerve her. 
</P>
<P>
It is almost too much to bear, especially alone, the man made clear. When you 
have Alzheimer's in the family, he said before his tears drove him from the 
room in embarrassment, "everybody walks away." 
</P>
<P>
At a recent workshop in Century City, the Los Angeles chapter of the 
Alzheimer's Assn. and the Westside Consortium of Senior Services offered 
Alzheimer's care-givers practical advice and the bitter solace of knowing that 
others are suffering too. 
</P>
<P>
"The holidays are often a very joyful time, but they can also be very, very 
difficult," said Lynn Morishita, program director for the Center for Geriatric 
Health at Century City Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The grown-up children of people with Alzheimer's routinely feel cheated, the 
experts said. The children gather around the table, remembering when mom or dad 
successfully stage-managed beloved holiday traditions, and they see only loss. 
</P>
<P>
"Holidays carry a lot of emotional wallop," said Nina Luce, a Santa Monica 
marriage and family counselor who specializes in geriatric issues. "We remember 
how it was and, if we don't get it, we're crushed." 
</P>
<P>
Holidays often precipitate a crisis among siblings, the speakers pointed out. 
Family members who live elsewhere often come home for the holidays only to 
discover that a parent or grandparent is much worse than they had realized from 
long-distance phone calls. Brothers and sisters sometimes blame the sibling who 
does most of the care-giving, who in turn typically feels overburdened. 
</P>
<P>
The experts agreed that a good first step in dealing with Alzheimer's is to 
have a family consultation with a caseworker or someone else with expertise in 
dementia and the medical, emotional and legal problems it creates. The earlier 
the family begins to think about these issues, the better, they said. For 
example, Jewish Family Service, Santa Monica, is a nonprofit agency that 
provides such services to anyone on a sliding fee scale. 
</P>
<P>
The experts also recommended that the family arrange to have the affected 
individual evaluated at a good geriatric health center. Some of the 
deficiencies associated with Alzheimer's are treatable, they said. For example, 
better diet may help a little. "A lot of older people are living on toast and 
tea," Luce pointed out. A complete evaluation will not only reveal what's wrong 
with the affected person, it will also help the family take full advantage of 
those abilities that remain, Morishita said. 
</P>
<P>
Two sisters at the workshop admitted that they dreaded the thought of 
Thanksgiving. They planned to fly to Arizona, where they were to have a turkey 
dinner with their father, then visit their mother, 66, who has been 
institutionalized with Alzheimer's for almost a decade. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real depressing," the younger sister said. "They have all these cards and 
ads on TV, and they just make you feel worse." 
</P>
<P>
Morishita said such sadness is normal. The person with dementia "is here, but 
they are not the person they were." Their loved ones, she said, "are grieving 
all the time." 
</P>
<P>
One reason the holidays are so difficult is that they underscore the role 
reversal that is one of the most painful aspects of dealing with dementia. 
</P>
<P>
As Joyce Brunelle, who does public relations for the Westside consortium, said: 
"Two things that life never prepares us for are parenting and parenting our own 
parent." Unfortunately, she noted, the intense emotion that Alzheimer's 
triggers in a family often complicates the coping process, which involves 
making difficult decisions about everything from where the patient will live to 
who will control his or her money. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be very practical at this stage," Brunelle said. "You have to be 
very dispassionate about it." 
</P>
<P>
The speakers urged care-givers to give themselves a break over the holidays. 
Less is more, the experts said. Don't try to replicate the lavish holidays of 
the past, but pick a few favorite traditions and concentrate on them. 
Simplified holiday activities are also easier on the person with Alzheimer's, 
who is often unsettled by changes in routine and unusual bustle and clutter. 
</P>
<P>
Start to prepare the affected person for the upcoming holiday well in advance 
by marking the calendar, having daily discussions of what the family will do, 
playing holiday music and, when feasible, making holiday foods. 
</P>
<P>
As Thanksgiving gives way to Hanukkah and Christmas, gifts become a problem. 
</P>
<P>
People with dementia often enjoy videotapes of family members, the experts 
said. And Brunelle noted that some people like to give a donation in the name 
of the person with Alzheimer's to a charity that was especially important to 
him or her before life changed forever. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
At the Alzheimer's workshop, occupational therapist Laura Caron-Parker offered 
these tips for holiday safety and stress reduction: 
</P>
<P>
* Remember that a Hanukkah menorah and candles on a holiday table are potential 
dangers to the person with Alzheimer's. Put all matches and lighters away after 
using. If you can child-proof your house for the holidays, you can make it safe 
for the person with dementia, Caron-Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
* Use only unbreakable ornaments on the Christmas tree and hang them with 
ribbon, not metal hooks. Remember that such traditional holiday plants as 
poinsettia and mistletoe are poisonous if ingested. 
</P>
<P>
* Avoid blinking holiday lights. They seem to increase the confusion and 
agitation of people with dementia. Shiny, reflective wrapping paper that causes 
visual distortions also seems to have this effect and should be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
* Gifts should be kept out of sight until they are exchanged. Left under the 
tree or elsewhere in the open, they increase visual clutter. The person with 
Alzheimer's may also open gifts that are left out, no matter who they are meant 
for. 
</P>
<P>
* Limit the number of holiday visitors, prepare them for the changes they will 
see in the affected person, and schedule their visits for morning and early 
afternoon, when people with dementia are usually at their best.

</P>
<P>
"You have to be very practical at this stage," Brunelle said. "You have to be 
very dispassionate about it." 
</P>
<P>
The speakers urged care-givers to give themselves a break over the holidays. 
Less is more, the experts said. Don't try to replicate the lavish holidays of 
the past, but pick a few favorite traditions and concentrate on them. 
Simplified holiday activities are also easier on the person with Alzheimer's, 
who is often unsettled by changes in routine and unusual bustle and clutter. 
</P>
<P>
Start to prepare the affected person for the upcoming holiday well in advance 
by marking the calendar, having daily discussions of what the family will do, 
playing holiday music and, when feasible, making holiday foods. 
</P>
<P>
As Thanksgiving gives way to Hanukkah and Christmas, gifts become a problem. 
</P>
<P>
People with dementia often enjoy videotapes of family members, the experts 
said. And Brunelle noted that some people like to give a donation in the name 
of the person with Alzheimer's to a charity that was especially important to 
him or her before life changed forever. 
</P>
<P>
Occupational therapist Laura Caron-Parker offered these tips for holiday safety 
and stress reduction at the Alzheimer's workshop. 
</P>
<P>
* Remember that a Hannukah menorah and candles on a holiday table are potential 
dangers to the person with Alzheimer's. Put all matches and lighters away after 
using. If you can child-proof your house for the holidays, you can make it safe 
for the person with dementia, Caron-Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
* Use only unbreakable ornaments on the Christmas tree and hang them with 
ribbon, not metal hooks. Remember that such traditional holiday plants as 
poinsetti a, mistletoe and holiday are poisonous if ingested. 
</P>
<P>
* Avoid blinking holiday lights. They seem to increase the confusion and 
agitation of people with dementia. Shiny, reflective wrapping paper that causes 
visual distortions also seems to have this effect and should be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
* Gifts should be kept out of sight until they are exchanged. Left under the 
tree or elsewhere in the open they increase visual clutter. The person with 
Alzheimer's may also open gifts that are left out, whomever they are meant for. 
</P>
<P>
* Limit the number of holiday visitors, prepare them for the changes they will 
see in the affected person and schedule their visits for morning and early 
afternoon when people with dementia are usually at their best.

ON VIEW / MARY LOU LOPER: SANTA ANITA KEEPS PARTIES ON TRACK 
</P>

<P>
The day after Christmas, Santa Anita was keeping the spirit bright in the 
Directors Room high above the race track in Arcadia. Chairman of the Board 
Robert P. Strub and his wife, Betty, of San Marino hosted their traditional 
opening-day luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
Chatting over Christmas gifts and the expected January slump in parties were 
Santa Anita President Clifford and Karen Goodrich, Mary and Arthur Crowe and 
Violetta and Bill Dougherty. Santa Anita's director of racing emeritus, Frank 
Kilroe, got cheery hellos, along with Dorothy and Ray Rogers, Martha Chandler 
and William Croxton, Jacqueline and Peter Dailey, Connie and John Gavin, Marion 
and Earle Jorgensen, Fielder and Lotsie Webster and Philip and Mary Hawley. 
Mary Frances and Bob Morgan and Candi and Taylor Grant came from Newport Beach, 
Walter and Sheila Hoffman from Ventura and John and Norma Bowles from Los 
Olivos. 
</P>
<P>
At the rail watching Moon Madness win the first race were Felix and Barbara 
McGinnis, Anne Brophy and Carl McGinnis. Lynn and Clement Hirsch were excited 
about entering their Magical Mile in the Malibu Stakes race. 
</P>
<P>
Among prominent horse owners in the Turf Club were Clarence and Dorothy 
Scarborough of Midland, Tex. Biggest social days this season are the Charles H. 
Strub Stakes, Feb. 10; the Santa Anita Handicap, March 9, and the Santa Anita 
Derby April 6. 
</P>
<P>
OPINIONS: Everywhere this holiday season, people compared invites. The 
consensus: fewer black-tie events (Barbara and Marvin Davis and Henry and 
Caroline Singleton canceled their traditional Christmas parties) and more teas. 
</P>
<P>
There was an onslaught of cocktail open houses with mirth abounding, but the 
serious question everyone asked was, "Do you think there'll be a war?" Worry 
took the edge off fun. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, among the many hosts and hostesses giving lively parties with 
guests eating too much and exchanging hugs and kisses under the mistletoe were 
Debbie and Terry Lanni, Beverly and Larry Thrall, Cheryl and Bill Doyle, 
Priscilla and Curt Tamkin, Carolyn and Chuck Miller, Barbara and Chuck 
Schneider, Carolyn and Maury DeWald, Debby and Bill Appler, Gretchen and David 
Seager, Phoebe and Joe Vaccaro, Liz and Craig Black, French Consul General 
Gerard and Naomi Coste, Fred Nason Jr. (celebrating his 60th birthday), Veva 
and Kingston McKee, Jess and Phyllis Marlow, Nancy and Bill Burrows and Connie 
and Bob Butler. Whew! 
</P>
<P>
DAY LIFE: If the evenings were filled with parties, the days were filled with 
teas and luncheons. One of the special teas was at the glorious contemporary 
home of Kitty Moses, with Maggie Edwards, Paty Kouba and Doris Coleman 
co-hosting. More than 150 ladies attended, receiving little scrolls as they 
left advising "Take Time." Such as, "Take time to think -- it is the source of 
power." And, "Take time to laugh -- it is the music of the soul." 
</P>
<P>
Alice Avery hosted a mammoth tea at the Los Angeles Country Club for 450 women. 
</P>
<P>
At another tea at the club, Louise Griffith and Joyce Stuart sent their guests 
off with miniature gold baskets containing three tea bags. 
</P>
<P>
In Hancock Park, Suzanne Rheinstein had the silver tea urns polished and 
gleaming for a friendly affair, and in Pasadena, at Dina Oldknow's tea, 
daughters and granddaughters in lace and velvet outnumbered adults. 
</P>
<P>
At the tea parties, the most common phrase is "tea food is my favorite food" -- 
as the cucumber and chicken salad sandwiches and the lemon bars, fudge and 
baklava were devoured. 
</P>
<P>
SITDOWN: One of the most joyous parties was the one Stephen and Jane Ackerman 
gave upstairs at the Bistro. After good friends dined and danced, they joined 
hands in Christmas carols and even a few tears, signaling that in almost every 
family joy and sorrow mix, and friends are awfully nice to be there to help 
lead you through. 
</P>
<P>
Another night, the fireplaces their home set a cozy ambiance for Jane and 
George Barretts' sit-down for 50. 
</P>
<P>
HEARTS: Romantic touches have marked the season. Valet parkers had a heavy job 
parking the cars at Carol and Mike Inman's home in Bel-Air at the party 
honoring their son, Peter, and his wife, Lori, wed last month in a formal 
ceremony in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrating the engagement of Melissa Swann Winston and Dennis Victor Alfieri, 
Edward and Patty Turrentine sent invitations wrapped in gold and burgundy silk 
cording. The black-tie event also heralded the grand opening of the 
Turrentines' (he's an interior designer) magnificent Italian ballroom, where 
dancing continued until the wee hours. 
</P>
<P>
In Pasadena, Amie Lu and John Haake and Jan and Buzz Hanson honored Paul 
Anderson and Elizabeth Murphy at a shower with holiday pizazz. They'll be 
married Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
LUNCHEONS: The Blue Ribbon at the Music Center and its president, Joanne 
Kozberg, filled the Grand Hall of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for a Christmas 
luncheon before the Joffrey's "The Nutcracker." 
</P>
<P>
Roger and Joanne Kozberg brought daughter Lindsey home from Princeton. Andrea 
Van de Kamp had daughter Diana, Harriet Deutsch had granddaughter Cari Deutsch 
and Dody Booth brought daughter Stephanie. 
</P>
<P>
Jenny Rutt took over the Pavillion at the Bistro Garden to host 60 for a 
luncheon. Launched with chat and green ravioli, the affair finished with 
giggles and ice cream and chocolate. As a surprise, the hostess asked Neiman 
Marcus to do a mini-fashion show of ball gowns. Rutt provided favors of 
Christmas red lipsticks and tied-up boxes of lemon drops for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Over at the Bistro Garden at Coldwater, the Luminaires Juniors (supporting the 
Doheny Eye Institute), including Mary Milner and Diane Avery, were in the 
holiday spirit.

CANDLELIGHT BALL TURNS INTO A FAMILY AFFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sentiment is everything. Ball Chairwoman Susan Baggott influenced Juniors of 
the Social Service Auxiliary to hold the Candlelight Ball at the Biltmore 
because her husband proposed to her in the hotel's Rendezvous Court. Orchestra 
leader Jerry Bruno got the nod because he played for her wedding reception. 
Colleen Casey, who usually sings with Michael Carney's Orchestra, was honored 
vocalist because she was Susan's Kappa Kappa Gamma sister at USC. Susan's uncle 
Msgr. William Barry, recently honored by the Vatican, gave the invocation. Even 
baby Lorna Baggott, 16 months, was in the arms of her mother during the 
reception line with dad Bob and Juniors president Donna Melone and her husband 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone's joyous. It looks as though the ball, a salute to philanthropist 
Dorothy Leavey, will net more than $125,000 (up from $92,000 last year) for 
Regis House community centers. And because of that Susan's parents, Lorna and 
Jack Barry; Sister Petra Keller, director of the Sisters of Social Service, and 
a committee including Linda Breen, Bridget Loftus, Sally Frawley, Mary McGraw 
and Theresa Dunn are ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
TABLOID: Mix costumed carolers and Dickens' characters Fagin and Mr. Micawber 
with garlands of greenery and bedecked trees. Spread mistletoe and holly on the 
tables. Place the 75-voice USC Concert Choir with Rodney Eichenberger on the 
balconies of the Crystal Room of the Biltmore. 
</P>
<P>
Bring in the organ grinder and the vintage harmonium for 19th-Century parlor 
readings. And position the grand piano on stage with Dudley Moore. That was the 
rare fun of the USC Friends of Music, Dudley Moore and Dickens evening. 
</P>
<P>
Decking the halls for music scholarships were Joyce Sprafka and Friends 
president Lucy Hubbard and School of Music dean Larry Livingston. Honorary 
chairwoman Flora Thornton gathered around Marion and George Scharffenberger and 
Eric Small. More in the audience of 400 were former U. S. Atty. Gen. William 
French Smith and his wife Jean; Lorna Reed; George and Mary Lou Boone and 
Virginia and Simon Ramo. 
</P>
<P>
PREVIEW: Jewels and 18th-Century tables will be under Christmas trees after the 
Junior League of Los Angeles' preview of its 10th annual Antiques Show at the 
Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. President Robin Nenninger and show chairwoman 
Carole Gascou invited the first chairwoman Connie Lynch and her husband Terence 
as well as past chairmen to attend the black-tie affair. And co-chairwomen 
Gwendolyn Hatten Baker and Doris Lebo staged dining midst the antiques -- the 
better to buy. The net is a hefty $100,000 for AIDS and cancer counseling hot 
lines and guides for the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
FOOTLOOSE: Big news at The Bachelors of Los Angeles stag night was that New 
York's Lester Lanin has been signed to fly in his orchestra for the 85th 
anniversary Bachelors Ball next year. He played the party hosted by Queen 
Elizabeth and Prince Philip to honor Prince Edward on his birthday.

FT  24 DEC 92 / Who's festival is it anyway?: A look at the origins of
Christmas in ancient pagan rituals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTMAS has little to do with Christ. This is not to say that a Christian
festival has been hijacked by commercialism, although plenty of preachers,
in their Christmas sermons, will assert precisely that.
No: it means that neither the date nor the components of Christmas bear much
relation to Gospel accounts of the birth of Christ, nor even to early
Christian practice. The image of the babe born (away) in a manger among
cattle (lowing) in (bleak) midwinter, in the (little) town of Bethlehem, on
which so much of our celebratory apparatus depends, is mostly fantastical.
Mark and John tell us nothing about the nativity, Matthew refers to
Bethlehem, but locates the birth in a perfectly ordinary house and all Luke
gives is the detail of the feeding-trough used as a cot. The animals are
picturesque extras and Biblical scholars tell us that the birth more likely
took place in Nazareth with April the probable month.
Some time in the fourth century AD the Christian authorities decided to
align the birth of Christ with the winter solstice, as reckoned on the
Julian calendar. This was a purely pragmatic move, designed to accommodate
the manifold oriental heathens who were used to saluting the nativity of the
sun on December 25.
The compromise with paganism has not stopped there, of course. The extra
vegetation we admit to our homes to hail Jesus (or the sun) would make all
sorts of infidels happy. Bacchanalian ravers would snatch for themselves our
ivy wreaths; Druids nod reverently towards our mistletoe; and savage
Norsemen drink bumpers to the yule log. And so on. It all ought to be common
knowledge, if we ever bothered to think about it.
Meditating on Christmas Past is a useful exercise, however, particularly
when trying to imagine Christmas Future. That is, the nature of an end of
year festival in a society which is predominantly secular and religiously
pluralistic. Those who feel that Christmas is in danger of losing its
integrity might reflect on some statistics emergent from a series of
religious censuses taken between 1970 and 1987.
John Clayton, professor of religious studies at the University of Lancaster,
has drawn attention to the trends implied by these statistics. According to
the present pattern of growth and decline in membership of Christian and
non-Christian faiths in Britain, by the year 2000 adult affiliation to the
Anglican church will have slumped to just over one and a half million.
This is a little less than the projected membership of the Roman Catholic
church. Both Anglican and Catholic numbers have been markedly declining
since 1970, although in the case of the Anglicans, it is not clear how many
'born-again' associates of the church show up in these statistics.
Membership of the reformed churches (including Scottish Presbyterians) is at
more steady level, but is dropping to slightly more than one million.
Methodists have steadied, too, at about half a million.
It will not surprise anyone familiar with certain parts of London and
certain old industrial centres in the north of England, that the religious
sect showing the most significant growth is Islam. In cities such as
Bradford, the statistics are confirmed in physical change: chapels converted
to curry-houses and mosques the size of hypermarkets being erected.
Assuming that Moslem adherence in Britain is not affected by secularisation
 -which may not be a safe assumption - and continues at its current
strength, the number of Moslem worshippers will roughly equal that of
Anglicans by 2000, and go on to outnumber them over the following decade.
Other non-Christian sects are increasing in numbers, although on a much
smaller scale. None the less, by the end of the millennium there will be
more Sikhs than Baptists in this country.
To publicise these figures on Christmas may seem alarmist, insofar as they
evoke a ghost of Christmas Future who speaks no comfort to those who want
December 25 reserved as a celebration of the birth of Christ. But the
importance of the statistics is easier to grasp at Christmas than at any
other time.
Christmas is a rite of passage, tailor-made for a secular and multicultural
community. It is a hotch-potch of creeds and rituals which ought never to
have been yoked together, yet survive as a coherent whole. The ghost of
Christmas Future is not a monster: his message is the same as the message of
Christmas Past.

<TEXT>
   The winter solstice is nearly upon us again, an
event long celebrated as marking the triumph of the unconquered sun
but today more often dreaded as the start of winter.
   Overshadowed in this season of religious holidays and the
approaching new year, the solstice was once the most popular of
pagan celebrations.
   It marks the lowest point of the year for the sun's apparent
travel, occurring at 10:28 a.m. EST, on Dec. 21, according to the
U.S. Naval Observatory.
   After the solstice, the sun begins spreading its warming rays
farther and farther north until reaching a zenith at the summer
solstice in June.
   Primitive societies, fearing the sun's departure, often developed
complex folk tales about the change in seasons, and learned to
celebrate the winter solstice as a time of rebirth foreshadowing the
coming return of summer.
   Indeed, sociologists note that many aspects of this event were
incorporated into Christian festivities marking the birth of Jesus,
which is now a major event of this season.
   To residents of ancient Rome the season was known as Saturnalia
and was celebrated with raucous merrymaking. That has since been
generally toned down, or at least postponed until New Year's eve.
   The Germanic tradition called Yule remains popular in many areas,
however. That feast incorporated burning of a special yule log,
decorating with plants such as holly, ivy and mistletoe which were
thought magical, and drinking wassail toasts.
   Gail Cleere of the Naval Observatory reports that great bonfires
were lit atop hills in hopes of encouraging the return of the sun.
   Today, most calendars list this date as the start of winter
despite the fact that there are no ``official'' definitions of the
seasons.
   Meteorologists, for example, consider winter to begin Dec. 1. In
medieval times Nov. 23 was considered that season's beginning, and
most people simply judge winter's arrival by how cold they feel when
they go outdoors.
   At any rate, the coming months mark the coldest time of the year
thanks to the fact that, although the sunlight is gradually
increasing, it takes some time to overcome the cooling that has been
underway during autumn when the light was on the decline.
   That thermal lag notwithstanding, spring will come, to be
welcomed by those following medieval tradition on Feb. 22, by
meteorologists on March 1, by calendar makers on March 20 and by
most folks on the first balmy day.

<TEXT>
   Santa Claus might be a thin, disagreeable
character in a stiff-brimmed hat if not for the 19th-century
cartoonist Thomas Nast.
   Nast, from whose pen also came the Democratic donkey and the
Republican elephant, gave Santa his present shape _ short, fat and
jolly man with a stocking cap and a long white beard _ as a morale
booster during the Civil War.
   Previously, Santa Claus was sometimes depicted as tall, thin and
domineering, and often had black hair and a stiff-brimmed hat, said
James I. Robertson, a history professor at Virginia Tech in
Blacksburg.
   ``There was no stereotype of Santa Claus at that time,'' he said.
``He tended to be in all shapes and sizes.''
   Nast, as a 21-year-old artist at Harper's Weekly in 1863, drew a
short, fat, bearded Santa bringing gifts to Union troops in a
star-spangled jacket, a cap and striped pants, Robertson said.
   ``The drawing boosted the spirits of soldiers and civilians alike
because it showed the spirit of Christmas had come to the Civil
War,'' the professor said.
   Nast was influenced by Clement Moore, whose 1823 poem ``'Twas The
Night Before Christmas'' depicted a twinkly-eyed, white-haired Santa
smoking a pipe, the professor said.
   Almost every year after, Nast drew a similar Santa. ``Hence the
American Santa Claus took shape by repetition. We just became
accustomed to this same figure,'' Robertson said.
   One aspect of Nast's Santa Claus did not make it to the 20th
century _ ``Nast always put a sprig of mistletoe on his cap,''
Robertson said.

<TEXT>
   Every soldier in the U.S. Army's
1st Cavalry Division is getting a gift package for Christmas - even
if it's only a pair of government-issue green socks.
   Services to mark the birth of Jesus and secular yuletide symbols
such as Christmas trees are being hidden behind closed tent flaps
so as not to offend the Moslem hosts of the Desert Shield
deployment.
   Carols are sung in combat boots and Christmas spirit is as hard
to find as reindeer in a camel herd, so troops fight to keep their
minds off the thousands of miles separating them from loved ones.
   ``If I start thinking about it, I get lonely,'' said Army Spec.
Robert Dennett, 29, of Rutherford, Texas, whose three kids will be
opening Christmas gifts without him. ``My wife said she was going
to save a bunch of presents 'til I got back and do Christmas all
over again.''
   Christmas was intentionally subdued in Saudi Arabia, where
strict Islamic codes ban the worship of other religions. That means
songs like ``White Christmas'' are preferred over ``Silent Night''
on the military radio stations.
   The only celebrity to visit is Bob Hope, the war-horse
troubadour who first entertained U.S. combat troops 50 years ago.
   Meals and mail provided some Christmas cheer.
   Military cooks prepared 150,000 pounds of rolled turkey and
4,000 whole turkeys for the 280,000 U.S. service members brought to
Saudi Arabia after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. The goal is
to get a hot Christmas dinner to all the troops, even those closest
to the Kuwaiti border.
   The main lifeline to home is the average of 400 tons of mail a
day, hauled in on at least five planeloads.
   Inmates at Szabo Correctional Services at Dublin, Calif., sent
boxes of cookies to officers. Josefina Ceja of Pomona, Calif.,
dispatched homemade tortillas to her son. Another mom sent a
finger-painting set.
   ``Even the camels see the mail trucks coming because the troops
feed them cookies,'' said Major Gen. William ``Gus'' Pagonis, head
of logistics for the largest U.S. military operation since Vietnam.
``Like other creatures of the wild, they learn real fast the GIs
will feed them.''
   So many packages addressed to ``any soldier'' were received that
each of the 20,000 soldiers of the 1st Cavalry Division can expect
to get a Christmas package. Those who don't get a civilian gift can
expect to get military T-shirts, underwear and socks.
   ``It might be a pair of green socks. It might be a Frisbee. But
we've got one gift for every soldier,'' said Maj. Steve Stacey, the
division's personnel officer.
   He also delivered the 1st Cavalry's message to the folks on the
home front: ``Although we're homesick and we miss you, we're with
you in spirit. We can't send any presents, so we send your our
love.''
   Midnight Mass has its own subtleties in the sand. Some services
were to be moved up to dusk. That way, troops wouldn't violate the
military ban on lights in the desert night.
   Lt. Theodore Borger, one of three Roman Catholic priests tending
to the spiritual needs of the 1st Marine Division, was planning
about 20 services.
   He was going to break out his special folding combat altar, but
was not going to deliver any special message.
   ``There will be others that will talk to them about the evil or
war. That's not my job,'' said Borger, 35, of Ottumwa, Iowa.
   Meanwhile, troops entertained themselves by singing lyrics to
their favorite holiday tunes. The Marine version of ``Jingle
Bells'' went like this:
   ``Dashing through the sand, with an M16 in hand, terrorizing the
land, looking for Hussein. Treads on tracks will ring, giving
troops a fright, opens up the door, we get out and fight.''
   A few Marines stuck up stockings in their tents, and Cpl.
Vincent Buck, 21 decorated the radiator grill of his truck with a
plastic holy wreath his mother sent from Santa Barbara, Calif.
   His dad sent mistletoe.
   There were not to be any Christmas spirits of the alcoholic
variety because of Saudi Arabia's strict ban on booze. So Maj. John
Porter of the Army's Battle Command Training Program made other
plans.
   ``We're going to have a party on the beach,'' said Porter, 38,
of Leavenworth, Kan. ``We're going to have near-beer, near-wine,
and the next morning we're going to wake up with near hangovers.''
   Some combat training has been scheduled for Christmas Day, but
most troops will have a light day.
   ``It's just another day in the desert,'' said Pfc. Mark Idleman,
19, of Wilson, Okla., a tank crewman with the 32nd Armored Regiment
of the 1st Cavalry Division.
   ``Christmas is a bad topic over here,'' said Lt. Tyler Randolph,
24, of MacLean, Va., who serves in one of the units of the Army's
18th Airborne Corps. ``It just makes you miss everybody more.''

   'Cause the amount of food that we'll consume
   It will cause our bellies to balloon.
   -- "Ain't No Time for Diets"
                                                                                                       

   O.K., so "White Christmas" it isn't. But rhythm and blues
singer Janey Clewer is still hoping her new song about the
travails of dieting during the holidays will help push her
new Christmas album to the top of the charts. "I think
there's a place for both old and new Christmas music," says
Ms. Clewer.
   Fat chance.
   Each December, with visions of dollar signs dancing in
their heads, songwriters and singers come out with new
Christmas tunes to add to the hundreds that already have been
recorded. The 1980s brought such would-be classics as "Wreck
the Malls," "Somebody Stole My Santa Claus Suit," "Funky,
Funky Christmas," "The 12 Pains of Christmas" and "Santa Got
a DWI."
   Most flop, miserably. "Basically, Christmas is etched in
stone as far as the market goes. It's hard to break that,"
says Troy White, national director of progressive music for
Epic Records, a unit of CBS Records Inc. "Artists hope
they'll have the next `White Christmas,' but it doesn't
happen."
   But they keep trying anyway because writing a hit
Christmas tune is the next best thing to cornering the market
on mistletoe and Christmas trees: Each year, different
singers record the hits -- and the royalties flow in. Since
1945, when Mel Torme and Robert Wells wrote "A Christmas
Song" (better known by its first line: "Chestnuts roasting on
an open fire"), more than 550 versions of it have been
recorded, by everyone from Ramsey Lewis to Barbra Streisand
to Fred Waring and the Pennsylvanians. Messrs. Torme and
Wells still each receive more than $100,000 a year in
royalties. "It's a bloody king's ransom," says Mr. Torme.
   "Silver Bells," written in 1950 for a Bob Hope movie
called "The Lemon Drop Kid" and since recorded by everyone
from Elvis Presley to the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, still
brings in more than $50,000 a year in royalties for each of
its two writers, Ray Evans and Jay Livingston. "We wrote it
very reluctantly because psychologically we believed all the
good Christmas songs had already been written," says Mr.
Evans. "Luckily, it was first sung by Bing Crosby, so it sold
around 125 million records." Bing Crosby also, of course,
sang "White Christmas," the best-selling Christmas single
ever.
   If it's any encouragement to modern-day Christmas song
writers, even unlikely melodies have become classics. It took
Donald Gardner just 30 minutes to write "All I Want for
Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth" in 1944 for a second-grade
class he taught in Smithtown, N.Y. Three years later, he
played the tune at a music teachers' conference for a friend,
a representative of a music-publishing company, who liked it.
It was recorded by Spike Jones, released in 1948 and sold 1.8
million records in seven weeks. Mr. Gardner knows of 25
different versions -- including one by Dread Zepplin, a
reggae-rock band -- but he's sure there are more. "I scout
around every year just to see what's there. On Dec. 26, I
turn into a pumpkin."
   But coming up with a new hit is nearly as hard as spotting
Santa coming down the chimney. The last Christmas singles to
make Billboard Magazine's weekly top 10 list for pop music,
both in December 1958, were "The Chipmunk Song" by David
Seville and the Chipmunks (best known words: "Alvin] ALVIN]")
and "Jingle Bell Rock" by Joe Beal and Jim Boothe. "Chipmunk"
ranked No. 1 and was on the charts for 13 weeks. "Jingle Bell
Rock," sung by Bobby Helms, ranked No. 6 and was on the
charts for 21 weeks.
   A Christmas song hasn't even made it into Billboard's top
100 singles since 1984 ("Do They Know It's Christmas?" which
was part of a charity album to aid the Ethiopian famine, and
"The Greatest Gift of All" by Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton.)
One problem is that the topic is awfully well worn. Ms.
Clewer says writing Christmas music is "lyrically confining
because you have to conform to Christmas and find some new
twist." And most folks prefer golden oldies anyway. "Nat King
Cole, Barbra Streisand, Frank Sinatra -- all those lines sell
steadily every year," says Robert Stapleton, district manager
at Tower Records in Boston.
   Moreover, new Christmas songs get little radio air time
because stations have curtailed playing carols. Unlike the
Christmas shopping season, which has expanded, now starting
before Thanksgiving, the Christmas carol season has been
shrinking. Once as long as six weeks, it now is only two or
three weeks.
   KJLH in Los Angeles, for example, began playing 10
Christmas songs a day about 18 days before Christmas. It has
14 carols on its frequent-play list, only four of which were
released in 1990. The top requested carol? "The Christmas
Song," recorded by Nat King Cole in 1946.
   For lesser-known artists, this is bad news. "Lack of
exposure of new songs prevents them from being accepted,"
says Harold Bronson, managing director of Rhino Records Inc.,
a Los Angeles record company. So, to compete with the songs
of Christmases past, many musicians have abandoned schmaltz
for smirks. Consider 1987's "Wreck the Malls:"
                                                                                                       

   Wreck the malls this Xmas season
   Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
   Blow your cash for no good reason
   Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
                                                                                                       

   Such songs irritate purists like Mr. Torme, 65. Of 1986's
"Santa Got a DWI," Mr. Torme says, "How would real Christians
feel if Santa came home drunk?" Adds Clarence James, an
analyst for a Stamford, Conn., finance company who buys a few
Christmas albums every year, "Christmas is not a funny time
of year. It has very serious meaning. Singing `Grandma Got
Run Over by a Reindeer' {a 1979 tune} isn't my idea of
Christmas. . . . Just by the very title, I wouldn't buy it.
If I heard it on the radio, I'd change the station."
   Judging by some recent hits, realism may be in. Barry
Manilow's hot-selling new album, "Because It's Christmas,"
which has sold 600,000 copies in just one month (Billboard's
No. 40 album this week), includes a song he co-wrote with the
late Johnny Mercer titled "I Guess There Ain't No Santa
Claus." Some of the lyrics:
                                                                                                       

   I got evenings to share that nobody will spare.
   I guess there ain't no Santa Claus.
   I don't flirt. I don't dance. 'Cause I don't get a chance.
   I guess there ain't no Santa Claus.
                                                                                                       

   Why so gloomy? "I didn't want to write about `Winter
Wonderland' or `Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.' I think we
have enough of that," says Mr. Manilow. "I wanted to write
more of a jazz album . . . aimed at adult, romantic
feelings."
   Eric Mercury's 1989 song "Christmas Presence" on the
"Christmas Cheers from Motown" album tells about a little
girl longing for her absent father to return home for
Christmas. Mr. Mercury is sure that the song is so close to
reality for many of today's children of divorced parents that
it just might become a classic. "White Christmas, chestnuts
roasting, I love that stuff. But it doesn't exist anymore,"
he says. "It's a different society now than when all those
songs were written."
                                                                                                       

   "I Guess There Ain't No Santa Claus" was written by Eddie
Arkin, Barry Manilow and Johnny Mercer and published by BMPI
Music, Lismore Music and Somisongs. "Ain't No Time for Diets"
was written by Janey Clewer and Randy Waldman and published
by Preacher's Kid Publishing and Great Randini Music. "Wreck
the Malls" was written by Bob Rivers, Dennis Amero and Brian
Silva and published by Solid Smash Music Publishing Co.

<TEXT>
   Donald R. Leal ("Yellowstone Burns as Park Managers Play Politics," editorial page, Aug. 26) described well the dilemma facing park managers trying to "preserve" the living, changing biological entity that a forest is. 
The fires in Yellowstone, which have consumed upward of one-fourth of the park's forests as of this writing, provide a stark lesson in the ecology that has governed nearly all of North America's forests over eons of time. 

   Lightning and, later, primitive man burned them regularly. 
When the first U.S. cavalry unit entered the park in 1870, Lt. Gustavus Doane reported that "the woods were . . . on fire in every direction." 
These fires, he said, were set by Indians hunting wildlife. 
The white man ran the Indians out, of course, thus beginning a transformation of the park. 

   Yellowstone's lodgepole pine forests are today grossly overaged, ranging up to 400 years old. 
Lodgepole becomes an old tree by age 60 to 80 and thereafter easily falls prey to insects and disease. 
The park's forests are now riddled with mountain pine beetles, one of the most destructive pests in western North America. 
In most of the park, more than half the trees are dead or dying. 
Dwarf mistletoe, a parasitic plant, infests the geriatric stands, further weakening them to beetle attacks. 
Fallen trees lie in jackstrawed piles everywhere, a furnace of fuel waiting for the spark that finally came. 
It's a sick old forest. 

   The beetles are also active in federal forests outside the park, but there the U.S. Forest Service has been permitted to salvage the dead trees, removing the wood and saving it for man's use. 
This reduced the intensity of fires there, and logging roads aided firefighters in controlling them more quickly. 
No one advocates logging in the park, but what is happening there demonstrates the fallacy of the "hands-off" philosophy Mr. Leal says environmentalists have forced on park managers. 

   The lesson for us is that, in forests not set aside as parks or wilderness areas, we can prevent such wholesale destruction under management programs that renew the forest by harvesting mature trees, removing the fuel for use in products and generating new growth. 

   What will happen next to Yellowstone's burned-over forests? 
Lodgepole is a tree peculiarly adapted to renewal by fire. 
It produces cones that may remain tightly shut over the life of the tree until opened by the intense heat of fire. 
So the burned areas are well seeded, so much so that they will resprout in even-aged "dog-hair" thickets so dense that neither man nor game animals can penetrate them. 
Park people who are predicting the resurgence of open meadows will find that those openings close up quickly, since at the extreme as many as 175,000 tightly packed lodgepole pines per acre may soon cover the land. 
These dense thickets become grossly stagnated and can persist indefinitely. 

   The short-term effect of the fires will be to stimulate growth of aspen and other herbaceous plants, and this will produce an explosion of wildlife numbers. 
When the lodgepole thickets take over the land, however, a major die-off of wildlife will follow. 

   In the meantime, snags of the old forest will be falling, and new jackstrawed piles of fire-killed trees may result in major fires again some years from now. 
This could help to thin out some of the dog-hair stands and provide more open spacing once again for the surviving trees. 

   And then it will all begin again.

   President, American Forest Council
   Washington
   ---
   It is ironic that the ideology of the Wilderness Society's Steven Whitney (letters to the editor, Sept. 12) tells him that a forest managed by a logging company is worse than a burned forest: "Turning over our national parks and forests to the private sector may make sense to a logging company, but not to a sportsman, tourist, scientist, eagle or grizzly." 

   Though no one has found a way of polling animals, I wager that grizzlies and eagles would rather live in a managed forest than die in a burning forest. 
As for sportsmen, tourists and scientists, why wouldn't they rather visit green, managed forests than desolate, charred woodlands? 

   Apparently the "environmental elite" would rather see their cherished forests go up in smoke than allow the private sector to save the environment.
