   ``Work to Start At Once on Two Forks Reservoir,''
proclaimed a headline in The Denver Post 61 years ago, touting a
project that would free the city from worry about future water
supplies.
   That 1928 report proved to be a bit optimistic. Not an ounce of
concrete has been poured at the proposed dam site on the South
Platte River 25 miles southwest of Denver.
   And now the federal Environmental Protection Agency may be about
to scuttle the dam, whose cost has ballooned from $6 million in
1928 to current estimates of $500 million to $1 billion.
   In an unusual move, EPA Administrator William Reilly began the
veto process on the 1.1 million acre-foot dam project March 24. He
said it simply was too costly environmentally: It would inundate a
gold-medal trout stream and possibly damage a Nebraska wildlife
habitat.
   Dam supporters can make a final appeal to save the project. EPA
spokesman Rich Lathrop said the review process could continue
through December.
   Although the city has adequate supplies at least through the
next quarter century, its leaders haven't decided where to turn for
water beyond that if Two Forks is defeated.
   ``We planned well and there's no crisis,'' said Monte Pascoe,
president of the Denver Water Board, which spent decades developing
the proposal.``We're trying to plan equally well for the next 25
years, and we're being told we can't do that.''
   The city currently diverts mountain water across the Continental
Divide from the Rockies' Western Slope.
   The dam has been touted by supporters as the best solution to
the area's future water needs.
   Opponents, such as National Audubon Society President Peter
Berle, have called the dam an ``environmental and economic
monstrosity'' that would destroy scenic Cheesman Canyon in Colorado.
   They also say it would alter the South Platte's flow downstream
into Nebraska and affect fragile habitat for 240 species of
migrating birds, including the endangered whooping crane and the
sandhill crane.
   Two Forks, just downstream from the confluence of the South
Platte and its North Fork, would stand 615 feet _ about half the
height of the Empire State Building _ and would be 1,700 feet long,
and from 160 to 467 feet thick. By comparison, Hoover Dam, one of
the highest concrete dams in the world, is 726 feet tall astride
the Colorado River and 1,244 feet long with a 660-foot thick
concrete base.
   Hoover Dam's reservoir, Lake Mead, on the Arizona-Nevada border,
stores about 29.7 million acre-feet of water _ one acre-foot is
enough water to cover one acre to a depth of one foot _ and covers
about 255 square miles.
   Two Forks, however, would store only 1.1 million acre-feet. It
would cover 13.28 square miles and the small community of Deckers.
   Denver leaders have considered a dam on the river since 1896 and
the city began acquiring land for the project in 1923.
   The most recent attempt to build a dam intensified in 1981 when
the Denver Water Board asked the Army Corps of Engineers to study
the dam's potential environmental impact.
   In 1986, the board and the Metropolitan Water Providers, a group
of 42 suburban water suppliers, formally applied for a construction
permit.
   The Corps issued a draft environmental impact assessment in 1987
that identified Two Forks as the most environmentally damaging of
seven proposed dams on the river, but it also said Two Forks was
the most cost-effective way to meet the area's water needs into the
21st century.
   Metropolitan officials are making contingency plans in addition
to continuing the fight for Two Forks, and the Denver Water Board
last week formalized water restrictions. Under the new policy,
Denver may decide each September whether to restrict additional
water connections outside city limits, and may implement rate
increases in Denver and the suburbs to which it sells water.
   Most of the cities in the metropolitan area purchase water from
Denver.
   Pascoe said the board has an adequate supply to meet needs in
Denver in the immediate future but ``there's no room for error.''
   ``We honestly don't think other supplies for water will be very
easy to find,'' he said.

PORTER RANCH GRADING PLAN BIGGEST EVER; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPER WANTS TO MOVE 40 MILLION CUBIC YARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plan to develop 1,300 hilly acres in Porter Ranch calls for moving enough 
earth to fill the Rose Bowl about 50 times. 
</P>
<P>
The developer of the $2-billion residential and commercial project estimates 
that 40 million cubic yards of earth must be graded during a 20-year 
construction period. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles city officials say they have not kept a running total of grading 
approved in recent history, but they cannot remember a single project in the 
city with more grading than proposed in Porter Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody remembers anything in terms of grading on that scale," said Frank 
Orbin, assistant chief of the city Department of Building and Safety's grading 
division. "Not even close to that size." 
</P>
<P>
"We're certainly up there," Paul Clarke, spokesman for Porter Ranch Development 
Co., said about the huge amount of grading proposed. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics of the development proposal say the grading and reshaping of the 
hills north of the Simi Valley Freeway are excessive. But Clarke noted that 
existing Los Angeles zoning law allows home construction that would result in 
substantial grading anyway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Least Controversial Segment 
</P>
<P>
The least controversial part of the Porter Ranch proposal is development of 
single-family houses, and that portion of the plan alone accounts for about 80% 
of the project's estimated grading, according to the developer's environmental 
impact report. 
</P>
<P>
The development firm, run by Beverly Hills builder Nathan Shapell, wants to 
build 2,195 single-family houses, 800 multifamily housing units and 7.5 million 
square feet of commercial space in the hilly Porter Ranch area of Chatsworth. 
City Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents the area, has recommended reducing 
the commercial area to about 6 million square feet and adding 400 multifamily 
housing units. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Planning Commission is scheduled to consider the plan Thursday, 
although the panel is awaiting a decision from the city attorney's office on 
whether two members have a conflict of interest that would bar the commission 
from hearing the matter. 
</P>
<P>
If the commission cannot hear the application, the Board of Referred Powers, 
which is made up of City Council members, would have to make recommendations on 
the plan to the full council. 
</P>
<P>
To comprehend the amount of grading proposed for the Porter Ranch project, 
consider how much soil it would take to fill the Rose Bowl. Since the facility 
has a volume of about 814,000 cubic yards, according to the city of Pasadena, 
the amount of earth to be graded at Porter Ranch would fill the stadium about 
50 times. 
</P>
<P>
Or consider the amount of concrete used to build Hoover Dam in Nevada -- 3.25 
million cubic yards. The amount of earth to be graded in Porter Ranch would be 
about 12 times that amount. 
</P>
<P>
The 40 million cubic yards to be graded, if massed into a giant cube, would be 
1,026 feet high. By comparison, City Hall is about 450 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
Workers operating 100 bulldozers eight hours a day, five days a week would need 
at least two years to grade 40 million cubic yards, said Frank Byron, an 
engineer with McCoy Construction Co., a Calabasas firm that specializes in 
grading. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke has described the project as the largest in the city's history by one 
landowner on one piece of land. The elevation of the hilly site ranges from 
1,150 to 1,850 feet above sea level. 
</P>
<P>
The grading is described in the project's environmental impact report as "cut 
and fill." "Cut" refers to the taking of land off hilltops, and "fill" refers 
to the movement of that earth into valleys. In other words, little or no earth 
is removed from the site, which becomes more level. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hillside Development 
</P>
<P>
The grading proposed for Porter Ranch would take place over the life of the 
project, development company officials said. And the environmental impact 
report points out that far smaller hillside developments in Los Angeles have 
resulted in moving more earth per acre or per home than is proposed in Porter 
Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in the Santa Monica Mountains, the 117-acre Bel-Air Crest Estates 
project resulted in 6.7 million cubic yards of grading, or about 57,000 per 
acre. The grading proposed for Porter Ranch is about 30,000 cubic yards per 
acre. 
</P>
<P>
With any project, heavy grading can become necessary because housing demand and 
the high cost of land prompt developers to make projects as dense as possible, 
said Brian Heller, an Agoura Hills builder. 
</P>
<P>
Building more homes means doing more grading, Heller said. "If the land prices 
hadn't escalated so much and demand hadn't been so high, they could have built 
five-acre lots" in Porter Ranch, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, McCoy Construction recently completed grading 56 million 
cubic yards for a 3,500-home project in the San Clemente area, Byron said. The 
original estimate was 30 million cubic yards, but buttressing the project to 
prevent landslides resulted in nearly twice as much grading, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke, the Porter Ranch spokesman, noted that the total amount of grading in 
the past 20 years for the 5,000 existing homes in the Porter Ranch area of 
Northridge probably exceeds 40 million cubic yards, although the homes were not 
approved as a single project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sheer Amount 
</P>
<P>
Still, the sheer amount of grading has drawn criticism from some opponents of 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
"There won't be anything left of nature when they get through," said Jan 
Hinkston, founder of the Santa Susana Mountain Park Assn. "It's too much of an 
impact." 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously 40 million cubic yards is egregiously too much," said Robert Birch, 
a spokesman for the PRIDE residents group, which opposes the project. 
</P>
<P>
The developer's environmental impact report said the grading effects would be 
minimal because of various measures to control erosion and prevent landslides. 
But the report also addresses how the project's reshaping of hills would affect 
the visual appearance of the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Development of the specific plan area would permanently alter the visual 
character of the site from surrounding areas," the report said. "Views of 
existing undeveloped rolling hills would be changed to views of residential and 
commercial development and landscaping with some open space remaining." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Big Dig 
</P>
<P>
City Hall gives some perspective to the amount of soil that would be moved at 
Porter Ranch. The development calls for an estimated 40 million cubic yard (a 
cube 1,026 ft. on all sides of grading during the 20-year construction period. 
It is the largest total amount for any Los Angeles project in recent memory, 
although builders of smaller hillside projects in the city have graded more per 
acre or per housing unit. The total amount of earth that would be moved in 
Porter Ranch is about 50 times the volume of the Rose Bowl and 12 times the 
volume of concrete in the Hoover Dam. A fleet of 100 bulldozers would take at 
least two years to complete the job.

FT  24 MAR 93 / Business and the Environment: America reaches the bottom of
the barrel - Worldwide water / Efforts at conservation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY Californians had already made up their minds, but after one more big
snowstorm over the Sierra Nevada at the end of February, Governor Pete
Wilson made it official: the state's six-year drought is finally over.
The latest blizzard left snow equivalent to an estimated 44m acre feet of
water; only the Columbia and upper Missouri basins are still dry. But the
end of the drought seems unlikely to halt a significant change in water
policy, particularly in the west, where for 90 years government engineering
works have wrestled the region's rivers out of their beds to bring water to
city pipes or - accounting for 80-90 per cent of water use in the west -
farm irrigation.
Even without the drought, the west was coming to the bottom of the barrel in
its search for new rivers to dam and divert; there will be no more Hoover
dams. 'The big projects may return about the same time as dinosaurs come
back to earth. We can't afford them, and there is no place to put them,'
says David Getches, a specialist in water law at the University of Colorado
School of Law.
Now, more attention is being paid to in-stream uses - fisheries, recreation
and the preservation of ecosystems. 'The challenge is that most of the water
is already allocated under a system that did not recognise the value of
these in-stream uses,' says Craig Bell, executive director of the Western
States Water Council, which groups representatives from the governments of
each state.
Indian nations, too, are claiming their water rights under the terms of
their treaties with the US. Wyoming's supreme court recently awarded nearly
half the water from the Bighorn river to the Shoshone and Arapaho.
Recently, there have been notable examples of re-allocation. Dams in the
Pacific north-west must now control their outflows in the interests of the
local salmon species which their construction put in peril, while the Glen
Canyon dam, on the Colorado River, has been forced to stop the water
releases that were eroding the beaches of the Grand Canyon.
The Central Valley Project, California's largest water delivery system, last
month announced it would allow nearly a fifth of its throughput, some
600,000 acre feet, to flow straight into the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta to
help restore the habitat of such species as the endangered delta smelt -
even though this leaves farmers in the San Joaquin valley, the project's
biggest beneficiaries, with barely a quarter of the water they requested.
This reassessment is not confined to the west. The Kissimmee river in
Florida, which the Army Corps of Engineers spent millions of dollars
canalising in the 1960s, will now be restored to its natural state at the
cost of further millions in order to save the wetlands around Lake
Okeechobee, at the northern end of the Everglades.
Rivers are not the only source of water, but states such as Arizona are
pumping groundwater at unsustainable rates, and excessive pumping has caused
widespread land subsidence in states as far apart as California and Florida.
Efforts to conserve water, meanwhile, have gained momentum, especially in
the west, and are expected to continue despite the formal end to this
drought.
The average water bill in Los Angeles has doubled in the past six years, and
the Metropolitan Water District, southern California's biggest supplier,
plans a further 22 per cent price rise this year. Many cities have adopted
new, water-saving construction requirements such as smaller toilet cisterns
or low-flow showers, and some local governments allow the use of 'grey'
water, which has been used once for something relatively clean, such as
bathwater, to be used for other purposes - flushing toilets or watering
lawns.
At the same time, the beginnings of a market in water are starting to
emerge. California and Idaho now have water banks run by the state. Some
deals, for instance between Los Angeles and the Imperial Valley system, have
built on the principles of conservation, with farmers agreeing to adopt more
economical irrigation methods or to grow less water-intensive crops in order
to free water to be sold to the city.
Getches foresees such exchanges reaching across state lines, with California
buying water from the states of the upper Colorado basin, which under-use
their allocations under the 1922 Colorado River Compact.
But quantity is only one side of the water equation; quality, too, is at
issue, with the Clean Water Act likely to come up for reauthorisation by
Congress this year. Since the first act, in 1972, many of the problems of
sewage and industrial water pollution have been largely addressed. But
non-point source pollution, especially run-off of pesticides and fertilisers
from agricultural land, has not been dealt with.
Some estimates put the cost of complying fully with the Clean Water Act,
which sets the goal of making rivers fishable and swimmable, at Dollars
110bn (Pounds 77bn) - although the Environmental Protection Agency has
estimated that 58,000 jobs are created for every Dollars 1bn invested in
sewage treatment.

<HEAD>Construction Pioneer Stephen Bechtel Dies at 88</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stephen Davison Bechtel Sr., an
engineering and construction giant whose accomplishments included
Hoover Dam and an entire city in Saudi Arabia, has died after a
brief illness. He was 88.
   Bechtel, longtime head of the company in San Francisco that bears
his family's name, died at Merritt Peralta Medical Center Tuesday.
At his family's request, the nature of his illness was not disclosed.
   Under Bechtel's guidance, the company built Hoover Dam, the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid
Transit system and the Saudi Arabian city of Jubail. The company
also built thousands of miles of pipelines and helped pioneer the
field of nuclear power.
   A doodle on the back of an envelope was often all the information
Bechtel needed to envision a huge project. The 718-mile Canadian
Trans Mountain Pipeline started that way over lunch in 1949.
   A native of Aurora, Ind., Bechtel joined his father's
construction firm at age 19 after serving in World War I and
attending the University of California at Berkeley.
   He was named president of W.A. Bechtel Co. in 1935 following his
father's death. Bechtel began to transform the business into one of
the world's largest international engineering and construction
companies. The company is now called Bechtel Group Inc.
   Bechtel remained president until 1960, when he turned over
day-to-day responsibilities to his son, Stephen Davison Bechtel Jr.,
but remained active in the company as chairman of the board.
   In 1965, he retired to the position of senior director. He
remained active in the organization's activities until his death.
   Forbes magazine last year estimated his wealth at $390 million.
   Among dozens of honors and citations received during his
lifetime, Bechtel received four honorary doctor of laws degrees and
an honorary doctorate of public service.
   He was named to Fortune magazine's Hall of Fame for Business
Leadership, and was among the ``Top Ten Construction Men of the
Half-Century,'' named by the American Society of Civil Engineers.
   Fortune called Bechtel ``the boldest and maybe the biggest
builder in the world,'' and added his name to a list that includes
Henry Ford, John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie.
   Besides his son, Bechtel is survived by his wife, Laura Peart
Bechtel of Oakland; a daughter, Barbara Bechtel Davies; seven
grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren.

   Calvin Coolidge thought it was a bad
idea. So did Herbert Hoover, insisting that a government agency
competing with private business was ``the negation of the ideals
upon which our civilization has been built.''
   But for Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Tennessee Valley Authority was
a chance to show what the government could do to help people help
themselves in hard times.
   TVA, now a sprawling, controversial agency with an annual budget
of more than $5 billion, was born in 1933 as part of the New Deal,
Roosevelt's remedy for the Great Depression.
   Like other Roosevelt reforms, such as the Civilian Conservation
Corps and the Works Progress Administration, TVA was designed to put
people back to work while improving their quality of life.
   The result was a government entity unique in the United States _
an independent agency charged with nurturing an entire region with
flood control, navigation and cheap electrical power.
   TVA, declared Roosevelt, should be ``clothed with the power of
government but possessed of the flexibility and initiative of
private enterprise.''
   Perhaps in any other period of American history or in any other
region except the destitute South of the '30s, TVA wouldn't have
worked.
   But for people eking out an existence in the cotton fields of
Mississippi or the mountains of North Carolina, it was a
bureaucratic blessing that raised them from darkness into light.
   In 1933, the Tennessee Valley had a per capita annual income of
$168, only 45 percent of the national average. About 62 percent of
the people _ more than twice the national average _ farmed. Only
28.6 percent _ half the national average _ worked in manufacturing,
trades and services.
   By 1985, the region's per capita income was 77.6 percent of the
national average. Just 4.4 percent of the population worked in
agriculture, while 74.2 percent were in manufacturing, trades and
services.
   TVA got its start when Sen. George Norris of Nebraska began
introducing bills in the 1920s to make an idle munitions complex in
Muscle Shoals, Ala., part of a government agency to develop the
Tennessee River basin.
   Coolidge and Hoover vetoed the measures, but Roosevelt endorsed
TVA as part of his ambitious recovery program.
   The fledgling agency was given $100 million to start, and
promptly found itself in a dogfight with private utilities led by
Wendell Willkie, president of the giant Commonwealth &amp; Southern Corp.
   ``The Tennessee River touches seven states and drains the
nation,'' said Willkie.
   But TVA Director David E. Lilienthal, insisting that people
wanted public power, set out to create a demand by setting rates at
rock-bottom prices and selling electric appliances to TVA customers.
   In Tupelo, Miss., the first city to buy TVA power, consumption of
electricity went up 83 percent in the first six months.
   Willkie was unimpressed. ``Every time somebody turns on a light
in Tupelo, Miss., the entire country pays for it,'' he said.
   The battle ended in 1939 when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld TVA's
constitutional right to exist and sell electricity.
   In the meantime, TVA was working to fulfill the grand dreams of
Roosevelt and Norris, touching virtually every aspect of life in the
Tennessee Valley.
   In addition to creating construction jobs, dams like Norris and
Wheeler and Chickamauga improved navigation and created flood-free
sites that lured businesses already attracted by the prospect of
cheap power.
   There are 39 dams in TVA's water control system, and the agency
estimates they've prevented about $2.2 billion in flood damage _
more than five times TVA's investment in the system.
   The once-treacherous Tennessee River is now navigable 650 miles
from Knoxville to the Ohio River. In 1933, annual barge traffic was
940,223 tons; now it's more than 36 million tons a year.
   The munitions complex in Muscle Shoals became a leader in
developing fertilizer to enrich soil depleted by decades of growing
corn, cotton and tobacco.
   New agricultural methods such as terracing, contour farming,
strip cropping and soil surveys were introduced to regenerate the
land and increase farm income.
   Although the region has 40 percent less farmland than in 1933,
the per-acre yield has more than doubled.
   More than 2.1 million acres stripped bare by poor logging
practices were reforested. Steps were taken to control local pockets
of malaria. Libraries established for TVA construction workers were
converted to regional use.
   At the agency's 30th anniversary celebration in 1963, President
John F. Kennedy said, ``The work of TVA will never be over.''
   ``There will always be new frontiers for it to conquer. For in
the minds of men the world over, the initials TVA stand for
progress, and the people of this area are not afraid of progress.''

in Seoul neared completion Friday on the line separating North and
South.
   The first phase of the South Korean ``peace dam'' is scheduled
to be finished next month. The Olympic Games open in Seoul on Sept.
17.
   The rockfill dam sits in a valley close to the Demilitarized
Zone separating the two Koreas. It will cut off the flow of the Han
River, which originates in North Korea and runs past Seoul before
flowing into the Yellow Sea.
   Construction began in late 1986, shortly after North Korea began
building a hydroelectric dam on an upper stream of the river.
   Despite North Korea's repeated claim that its dam was designed
only to generate power, Seoul officials suspect that it also is
intended to unleash a ``water offensive'' against South Korea.
   If the North Korean dam collapsed, about 26 billion tons of
water could submerge most of Seoul and surrounding areas with a
``nuclear force,'' South Korean officials say.
   ``We have done something which was considered difficult to be
done in time,'' Chung In-ho of the government's Industrial Site and
Water Resources Development Corp. told reporters visiting the dam
site near Hwachun, a border town 55 miles northeast of the capital.
   South Korea is building the dam on a phased program designed to
match the progress of the North Korean dam under construction about
22 over the DMZ.
   South Korea hurried the first phase of the project in fear that
North Korea would try to flood some major sports facilities in
Seoul along the Han River before the Olympics.
   ``If North Korea attempts to flood us, the damage would be far
beyond our imagination,'' Lee Hee-sung, chief designer of the
state-run Industrial Site, said.
   Lee said South Korea poured $250 million into the first phase of
construction. The dam would eventually cost more than $600 million
U.S. dollars, he said.
   The dam will be at least 215 feet high, but it could be made
higher to match the North Korean dam, he said.
   He said satellite and other military intelligence reports show
that North Korea is also accelerating work on its dam, digging
diversion tunnels that made the river bed dry so that ground work
for the dam could start.
   The South Korean engineer said he believes that the Soviet Union
is helping North Korea with the construction.
   Lee questioned the economic feasibility of the North Korean
project, saying that when it is finished in four or five years, the
dam could probably utilize only 10 percent of water it takes in.

<TEXT>
   Hydro-Quebec plans to advance the construction dates of three hydroelectric dams in the James Bay region of northern Quebec. 

   Originally, Hydro-Quebec's development plan called for the dams -- costing a total of 7.5 billion Canadian dollars ($6 billion) -- to be completed between 1995 and 1997. 
The new plan calls for completion of all three between 1995 and 1996. 

   A spokesman for the provincially owned electric utility said the decision to advance the construction dates results from agreements reached in the past year for the sale of large blocks of power to utilities in New York state, Vermont and Maine. 

   The three dams, to be built on the La Grande River system, will have total generating capacity of 2,464,000 kilowatts. 
The dams, known as LG-1, Brisay and Laforge-1, will be the first new basic-load capacity built by the utility since completion of the LG-4 dam in 1986. 
In 1982, the utility delayed earlier plans to build the dams because of a huge energy surplus that resulted from the first 15 billion dollar phase of the James Bay project. 

   Construction continues on two other large hydroelectric projects, one in the James Bay area, to provide peak-load power. 

   The spokesman said Hydro-Quebec hopes construction of LG-1, the largest of the three dams, can begin this year, with work on the other two expected in 1989.

<LEADPARA>  When state and federal officials discussed California's water future with
Congress earlier this month, they delivered one of their clearest messages
with what they didn't say. Dams, reservoirs, canals -- formerly government's
first line of defense against long-term shortages -- were scarcely mentioned.;
   Instead, the federal commissioner of reclamation, whose agency once devoted
itself to plumbing the West, talked of conservation. Later, the state
resources secretary chuckled as he recounted a congressman's plea to tap the
vast runoff of northern rivers.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  STATE WATER PROJECTS FACING A DRY FUTURE
ENVIRONMENT, POLITICS, MONEY GET IN THE WAY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Underlying the testimony was an emerging truth of Western water politics, a
truth California's drought -- almost paradoxically -- is helping to reinforce.
The era of big water projects is gone, perhaps never to return.;    Political
obstacles;  Today, the financial, environmental and political obstacles to new
water development loom with the imposing force of a Hoover, Shasta or Grand
Coulee. Even relatively small projects -- like a Los Banos reservoir or an
expanded south delta pump station -- must contend with near-billion-dollar
price tags, regulatory requirements and widespread public disapproval.;   
"There are certainly some people who may look at this drought as the
opportunity to dust off some old discredited notions and say if only we had
this dam or that one, we'd be in fat city," said Edward Osann, director of
water resources for the National Wildlife Federation. "But there are some
basic reasons why those projects haven't happened and aren't going to
happen.";    It's not that there's a shortage of ideas. Four years ago, for
instance, the state and federal government quietly considered replacing Shasta
Dam in North Central California with a structure some 200 feet higher to store
more water. For years, Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn has proposed
siphoning off part of the Columbia River to slake Southern California's
thirst. Bigger dreamers talk of water from British Columbia, even Alaska. All
of these projects are technically feasible.;    Money issue; But these days
any water project, whether practical or fanciful, runs smack into the issue of
money.;    Were this 50 years ago, a parched California might expect a flush
federal government to offer dams and canals gratis. After all, the government
did just that when it took over the Central Valley Project in the mid-1930s.
But today, water project funds flow from Washington only under the strict
cost-sharing requirements of laws passed by a far more tightfisted Congress in
the deficit-ridden 1990s.;    "State officials look a lot more closely at
these things now that they have to put up their own money," Osann notes.;   
Meanwhile, the costs themselves have skyrocketed: A dam or canal today is at
least 10 times more expensive than it was 20 to 30 years ago. Inflation has
contributed to that rise. So too has the fact that the cheapest projects have
long since been built. In a state that already claims 1,200 dams on its 800
rivers, the only untapped flows are the ones that can't be had without a
60-mile tunnel through mountain rock, or some similarly expensive engineering
feat.;    And any such project would run into an even stiffer barrier: the
last 20 years of environmental law. No longer can a government agency
construct a dam without guaranteeing fresh water flows for fish, suitable
habitat for neighboring wildlife or survival for nearby endangered species.;  
 "You can look around the state now and see a lot of things you just couldn't
build the same way today," said Hal Candee of the Natural Resources Defense
Council. He cited the Friant Dam northeast of Fresno, which intermittently
leaves stretches of the San Joaquin River almost dry, as one example.;   
Rivers off limits;  Other projects couldn't be built under any circumstances.
The Klamath and Eel rivers, which contain nearly 16 percent of the state's
total freshwater runoff between them, were declared off limits to development
in the early 1980s.;    These obstacles exist and endure, observers agree,
because people seem to support them. The politics of water in California have
changed drastically in the last 20 years. Agribusiness interests that once
pushed dams and canals are fragmented, while the environmental groups that
fight those projects are stronger.;    "There's so many groups out there now
that have the power to block things, and no one group any more that has the
power to get something accomplished," said former Assembly Speaker Robert
Monagan.;    Nowhere was that clearer than in the 1982 campaign to build a
43-mile waterway through the Sacramento Delta, the so-called Peripheral Canal.
Even though it could hardly be called a major project -- the canal would have
moved just 700,000 acre-feet per year, less than 3 percent of the state's
annual consumption -- environmentalists and Northern California activists
combined to send it to a crushing defeat.;    Today, according to a January
Los Angeles Times poll, the prospects would be even worse. Just 10 percent of
those polled statewide said they favored a Peripheral Canal. And only 26
percent backed "building more dams" to meet the state's long-term water
needs.;    In the face of such sentiment, the traditional pro-development
forces are lying low. Reclamation Commissioner Dennis Underwood -- in sharp
contrast to his build-we-must predecessors -- even talks as if the new climate
is no problem.;    "This agency, since 1902, has been building an
infrastructure, a plumbing system for the West," he said. "Now that we've done
that, we can look at managing that system in a way that enhances the quality
of life. That's a natural evolution.";    But some others are frankly
mystified.;    "The days of the big water project can't be over," said former
Gov. Pat Brown.  </TEXT>

WILLOW BEACH, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huge trout no longer have a huge following here, unless you count the people 
who gaze at the thousands of pictures on the walls of the Willow Beach Marina. 
</P>
<P>
It's impossible not to notice the five-pounders, the 10-pounders, or even the 
21.3-pound rainbow trout mounted in a glass case on the wall behind the bar. 
</P>
<P>
"Were all these fish caught here?" a first-time visitor, seemingly amazed at 
the display of photographed trout, asks a sales clerk. 
</P>
<P>
She nods, smiling to others who know as she does that this weekend fisherman is 
building his hopes on history. 
</P>
<P>
The fish that made the stretch of Colorado River immediately below Hoover Dam 
one of the country's best rainbow trout fisheries have long since disappeared. 
The 3,000 or so pictures on the Willow Beach "Wall of Fame" are mostly of fish 
caught before 1980, and scientists to this day can only theorize about what 
caused the decline. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time this decade, however, bigger trout are showing more 
frequently, perhaps indicating that all hope is not lost for the embattled 
fishery. 
</P>
<P>
"Upriver, this year is the best it's been since the flood went over," says Bill 
Tennis, 75, a regular here for the last 40 years. He is referring to the 
high-water conditions in 1983, when Lake Mead flowed over the Hoover Dam 
spillway, sending a 450-foot-wide waterfall cascading down the dam's 726-foot 
concrete walls. "The moss is growing back and they're bringing in some pretty 
nice fish." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Ard, 39, a Glendora resident who has come here almost every year since he 
was 7 years old, agrees, saying: "I've seen more four-, five- and six-pounders 
than there were a couple of years ago." 
</P>
<P>
A 10-pound rainbow was caught in December of 1987 to back their claims of the 
fishery's possible rejuvenation. 
</P>
<P>
Still, these fishermen are admittedly over-optimistic if they think that the 
trophy-sized rainbows that made this stretch of river famous will thrive again 
as they once did in the confines of Black Canyon, where jagged lava peaks and 
walls 1,000-feet high rise like moonscape from the water's edge. 
</P>
<P>
There have simply been too many changes in the river. 
</P>
<P>
Duke Crowe, 72, arrived here just after World War II. He witnessed the taming 
of the mighty Colorado by a series of dams built to meet the needs of Los 
Angeles. "It was isolated back then, wonderful," Crowe recalls. "In those days, 
if you saw three boats in the area, it was a big deal. You'd go over and shake 
their hands and ask where they're from." 
</P>
<P>
The late Cliff Barnson, called by locals the greatest trout fisherman ever, was 
here before the completion of Hoover Dam in 1936, when, as Tennis puts it, "the 
river was a river." Barnson died in his sleep of heart failure two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, navigation by boat was hazardous and access by land was limited 
at best, according to Crowe. 
</P>
<P>
What trout there were -- Nevada fisheries personnel say there were none until 
they began stocking just before 1960 but Barnson, Tennis and Crowe, revealing 
wallet-sized photos of trout they caught in the late 1950s, say otherwise -- 
were mostly sub-three-pounders. 
</P>
<P>
"They were not the real big ones . . . no trophies, just native fish that were 
in the river," Tennis says. 
</P>
<P>
Labor demands grew, though, and towns such as Boulder City, Nev., Bullhead 
City, Ariz., and Parker, Ariz. sprang up to house the builders of dams and 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
Davis Dam was erected in the late 1940s and Lake Mohave was created; the river 
above it backed up and access was improved. The rapids Crowe spoke of 
disappeared, giving way to deep channels and swelled shores. Ringbolt Rapid, an 
insignificant ripple between Willow Beach Resort and Hoover Dam, is now 
recognized as the southernmost rapid on the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
"It's roaring in September," jokes owner Ron Opfer of the Willow Beach Resort. 
"On a scale of one to 10, it's a .0025." 
</P>
<P>
Farther downriver, Parker Dam was built and Lake Havasu was born. Recreational 
opportunities grew in the area and the crowds flocked to these reservoirs on 
the river. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers of fishermen increased rapidly in the late 1960s as word spread of 
a tremendous rainbow trout fishery at 600 feet above sea level in the middle of 
a desert, where temperatures have reached 127 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
No snow. Not even the scent of pine. Just plenty of rainbow trout, which grew 
abnormally fast in the nutrient-rich water that flowed out of Lake Mead at a 
cool and comfortable 52 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"They would make you lift anchor and give chase," Crowe says of the spirited 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Janisch, Arizona fisheries chief, agrees. "We're talking monster trout," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Trout proliferation began in earnest when Arizona and Nevada began stocking 
programs, dumping fingerlings immediately below the dam. The fishery improved 
even faster after 1962, when the Willow Beach National Fish Hatchery, located a 
short distance upriver from the marina, took over that task. 
</P>
<P>
George Engelage of Whittier says that, during a four-month period in 1972, he 
caught 10 trout weighing 6 1/2 to 16 3/4 pounds. In 1974, the 11-mile stretch 
between Hoover Dam and Willow Beach yielded 286 rainbows from five to 15 3/4 
pounds each. 
</P>
<P>
The fabled Barnson used a homemade lure he called the Big T to reportedly catch 
more than 1,000 rainbows of more than five pounds apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Richardson, former California inland fisheries chief, describes the 
stretch of river in 1974: "I don't know of a place on the continent that 
compares to it. Lakes and streams on the High Sierra, Alaska, Canada, Montana, 
Wyoming and Idaho produce giant rainbows, but not in this quantity." 
</P>
<P>
The fishery peaked in 1976, when 476 rainbows of at least five pounds were 
caught. Only 244 were caught in 1977; 225 in '78; 186 in '79 and 92 in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Fishermen became concerned as the fish became increasingly scarce. Biologists 
set forth to determine what was transforming a superb fishery into one of the 
"put-and-take" variety, as Janisch calls it today. 
</P>
<P>
The hatchery stocks the river below the dam each year with 1,700,000 fish. 
</P>
<P>
Fishermen blame the decline on the overflow of the dam in 1983, which 
introduced striped bass into the system. Biologists discount that theory, 
however, saying that striper predation in the river is minimal, adding that the 
water that flows into the river from Lake Mead is too cold for striped bass, 
most of which moved downriver to warmer water. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the stripers have established a population and many of today's 
striper fishermen are former trout fishermen. Tennis, himself, boasts of having 
caught a 29 1/2-pound striper. His wife, Kay, caught one weighing 22 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
But whereas fishermen have their theories on the demise of "trout heaven," all 
biologists have to go on is speculation here and an educated guess there. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has a lick of data on this," says Larry Paulson, director of Lake Mead 
research at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. "Everybody's speculating. But 
I've said all along that the reason they lost the trout fishery down below 
Willow Beach and into Lake Mohave was the cutback of phosphorous loading from 
Las Vegas Wash." 
</P>
<P>
Phosphorous produces the algae that feeds plankton, which in turn feeds shad -- 
introduced into the Colorado from Tennessee in 1955 -- which makes for a 
healthy trout fishery, according to Paulson. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in the mid- to late 1970s, phosphorous flowed unimpeded into the lower 
end of Lake Mead and consequentially throughout the system (below it). Then in 
1981, the Advance Wastewater (tertiary) Treatment Plant began to take the 
phosphorous out." 
</P>
<P>
Because the flow rate has increased considerably since 1981, the amount of 
phosphates entering Lake Mead has also increased, suggesting a possible reason 
for the increased moss growth below the dam and a somewhat improved fishery. 
</P>
<P>
Janisch, meanwhile, claims that the building of dams and reservoirs upstream 
from Lake Mead serve as "nutrient traps" and that unless his department is able 
to supplement nitrates and phosphates, which he says are necessary to produce 
the aquatic insects needed by trout to survive, the fishery will never improve. 
</P>
<P>
But as part of the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, the Willow Beach area 
falls under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Park Service, which Janisch says won't 
allow such a program because of "concerns about altering the environment for 
downstream users. 
</P>
<P>
"When Lake Mead was built in the 1930s, the system above it was wide open and 
every time you'd get spring rains and floods you would have large volumes of 
nutrients coming out of Lake Mead, which would rejuvenate the fishery, provide 
all the phosphates and nitrates, and the same would be true at Willow Beach," 
he says. "Water would pass on through the dam and you would have a relatively 
productive system." 
</P>
<P>
The Glen Canyon Dam (built 286 miles above Lake Mead in 1966), is the primary 
culprit, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the case, people such as Ard will still come here to fish the crystal 
waters, to tour beautiful Black Canyon and gaze at the desert bighorn sheep and 
coyotes on the hillsides, and to hope for the best. 
</P>
<P>
"Trout fishing is most relaxing, and when I come here I just want to relax," he 
says. "It's still good fishing. The size is just not there." 
</P>
<P>
Not yet, anyway.

  [Text] Yichang, May 2 (XINHUA) -- An equipment leasing 
market will be built for the construction of a gigantic water 
conservancy project at the Three Gorges on the middle reaches of 
the Chang Jiang river. 
  Yuan Guolin, deputy general manager of the China Chang Jiang 
River Three Gorges Development Corporation, said that his 
company, which is in charge of building the dam, welcomes large 
domestic and foreign equipment manufacturers to come to 
establish an equipment leasing market at the dam construction 
site. 
  The dam which is designed 185 meters high and nearly 2 km 
long will take 17 years to finish. When completed, the 
hydroelectric plant will have a generating capacity of 17,800 
megawatts. At present, preparations for the project has entered 
its peak time of digging, giving rise to great demands for large 
construction equipment and machinery. 
  As public bidding has been adopted in the construction of 
different sections of the entire project, the deputy manager 
explained, many contractors of different sections of the project 
do not have enough fund to buy the whole set of equipment needed 
in the actual building. 
  "If they can afford to buy all the construction equipment 
needed, it still would eventually lay idle after completion of 
the contracted section," said the deputy general manager, adding 
that construction speed would also be greatly affected by the 
period to import equipment after winners of a bid are decided. 
  The deputy general manager said that his company would adopt 
preferential measures to lure domestic and overseas equipment 
manufacturers to lease their products at the Three Gorges area, 
while continuing to import some large equipment to lease to 
companies which have contracted construction of sections of the 
project. 
  According to him, the China Chang Jiang River Three Gorges 
Development Corporation has already bought large construction 
equipment and machinery worth 200 million yuan and has leased 
them to companies which need the machinery for construction.

   President Turgut Ozal cut the flow of
the Euphrates River with the push of a button Saturday, diverting
its waters to a reservoir and raising fears of tension with
Turkey's arid downstream neighbors.
   ``Starting with the name of Allah all-forgiving and for the
benefit of our people,'' Ozal said as he pushed the button at the
end of a cord extending from a channel at the giant Ataturk dam.
   During the one-month stoppage, Syria and Iraq will get 75
percent less water from the tributaries of the Euphrates, the
1,460-mile-long river that has been the lifeblood throughout
history for the area, once ancient Mesopotamia. The river already
slows to become a sluggish stream before joining the Tigris at the
Shatt-al-Arab waterway in Iraq and emptying into the Persian Gulf.
   Commando forces stood guard on heights in the reservoir area
while 10,000 people watched the ceremony at the dam site about 60
miles north of the Syrian border.
   White, blue and pink clouds mushroomed from smoke bombs exploded
on the opposite side of the river during the ceremony, as water
gushed down the middle of the dam's three derivation channels.
   Once the Southeast Anatolia project of 15 dams and 18
hydroelectric power plants is completed, Turkey will have a
stranglehold on both the Euphrates and Tigris rivers.
   But in a speech, Ozal promised Syria and Iraq that ``Turkey
would never use the water of Euphrates as a threat.''
   ``This was a technical necessity but we have taken all possible
care not to cause any damage to our neighbors,'' Ozal said.
   Ozal proposed that Turkey's neighbors invest together in
infrastructure projects as he said European countries had done. He
did not give details.
   Turkey views the dam and a chain of others to be built in the
future as crucial for the economic development of its backward
southeastern region, providing much-needed electricity and water
for crop irrigation.
   It says the monthlong stoppage of water will allow engineers to
fill a reservoir to a height of 396 feet and build a concrete plug
for a diversion channel as part of the construction project.
   Syria is more dependent than Iraq on the river, because Iraq
also has the Tigris running through its territory. But being
upstream, Syria could keep more of the Euphrates waters in its own
reservoirs and allow a trickle to Iraq.
   Syria has made no public statement on the water cut. Iraq said
it would send a senior envoy to Ankara on Sunday to discuss
problems arising from the reduction in the Euphrates flow.
   Iraq sent its deputy foreign minister, Nizar Hamdoun, to Turkey
last month to ask for a cut in the Euphrates flow of two weeks
instead of the planned one month. Turkey said two weeks was not
enough time.
   Hamdoun told reporters that the cutoff would not provoke a
full-blown crisis in Iraqi agriculture, but it would still cause
damage in some areas.
   Turkish officials have taken an Iraqi delegation to the dam
construction site to explain the situation, Foreign Ministry
officials said.
   Turks maintain that since November they have released extra
water to Syria and Iraq, to allow them to store water in their
reservoirs for use during the shortfall.
   A state waterworks official at the dam site said that since
November, Turkey had released 4.42 billion cubic yards of water
downstream, and 1.1 billion cubic yards of it had been allowed into
Iraq by Syria.
   Ozal said the construction of the massive dam by Turkish workers
and engineers showed ``what we are capable of doing.''
   There has been talk in newspapers and diplomatic circles of
possible future strains among the countries of the mostly arid
region since Ozal said last summer in an off-the-cuff remark that
Turkey could block the Euphrates River waters to punish Syria for
providing support to Kurdish guerrillas waging war for independence
in southeast Turkey.
   When completed in 2006, the Southeast Anatolia project will
produce 22 billion kwh of electricity annually and irrigate an area
of 4 million acres.
   The additional energy should double the yield of many crops in
Turkey and produce $5 billion worth of surplus in the country,
which is agriculturally self-sufficient, officials say.
   The first of the Ataturk dam's eight electricity-generating
units is scheduled to go into operation May 1991.

   A series of explosions at a space shuttle
fuel plant rocked this southern Nevada city Wednesday, destroying
the facility and a marshmallow plant, killing at least one person,
injuring 96 and leaving scores of others missing.
   Flames and orange smoke rose 100 feet into the sky and buildings
shook 10 miles away in Las Vegas after the midday explosions at the
Pacific Engineering &amp; Production Co. of Nevada. The plant
manufactures ammonium perchlorate, an oxidizer used in fuel for the
shuttle's solid rocket boosters, but NASA said the accident was not
expected to delay resumption of shuttle flights.
   ``What we see is pretty much total devastation,'' said Fred
Gibson, an executive at the plant.
   All roads to Henderson, a town of 25,000 midway between Las
Vegas and Hoover Dam, were closed because of concern that toxic
gases might escape.
   At the command post near the blast site, Clark County Fire
Spokesman Mark Hector said at least one person had been killed.
   Emergency workers were forced to stand by for fear of additional
explosions. State records showed 125 people worked at Pacific while
the next-door Kid Marshmallow Plant employed 85, but few employees
of either plant had been seen at hospitals, authorities said.
   ``There are people out there who are probably dying,'' said
Janet Smith, a spokeswoman for Mercy Ambulance in Las Vegas, whose
company dispatched ambulances to the site. ``This is going to be a
daylong and nightlong event because no fire unit has been out there.
   ``People are out there on the desert wandering aimlessly'' if
they were lucky enough to have escaped, she said.
   David Coats, administrator of Saint Rose de Lima Hospital, said
96 injured people had been brought in. He said most of the injuries
were minor but at least three were critical.
   Gibson, asked if toxic products could have leaked, said the
plant's ammonia tanks could not be seen. ``We can't tell at the
moment whether these tanks are secure.''
   ``One of our pieces of equipment malfunctioned and caught on
fire. The fire spread quickly and there was an explosion,'' Gibson
said. At least two blasts followed the main blast within seconds.
   He said the smoke was so thick he couldn't see if any of
Pacific's buildings were still standing. ``I suspect there are
none,'' Gibson said.
   Emergency workers warned residents away from the area as smoke
billowed across the entire Las Vegas Valley. All schools in the
area were evacuated and closed for the day, United Blood Services
of Las Vegas made an emergency appeal for contributions to help
victims, and hospital workers were called in or put on standby
throughout the area.
   One victim with an open skull fracture was being flown by
helicopter to Valley Hospital in Las Vegas, said Tina Ashcraft,
Life Flight helicopter dispatcher.
   ``Our windows blew out. It blew the frame off the door. We are
probably five or six miles away. The thing is on fire,'' said Lee
Hall, secretary at the Henderson Convalescent Hospital.
   Ms. Hall said hospital officials were checking for injured
patients and employees. ``A window blew up in somebody's face,''
she said.
   Several people injured in the blast were taken to nearby Saint
Rose De Lima Hospital, where the explosion also shattered windows,
hospital spokeswoman Marcia Hawkins said.
   Ms. Hawkins said many patients were cut and bruised.
   ``The windows blew. The workers are helping the patients,'' Ms.
Hawkins said. ``It's near here and all we can see is the black
cloud of smoke.''
   In Las Vegas, buildings shook and a huge plume of smoke was
visible in the air. People leaving offices for the noon hour stood
on the streets, gawking at the smoke.
   A worker at Hoover Dam, Bob Baker, said he was deep inside the
dam when the blast rattled windows at the power plant in the belly
of the facility. He did not feel the dam itself shake.
   Jay Herman, an engineer who was less than two miles from the
plant site, said he heard three blasts, the first ``worse than any
sonic boom. I thought it was a plane crash but there was too much
smoke.''
   He said the second blast five minutes later `` almost knocked us
over'' and when the third hit, he crawled under a desk. ``I thought
it was a nuclear bomb.''
   NASA said in Washington that Pacific Engineering provides the
ammonium perchlorate to Morton Thiokol, NASA's prime contractor for
the motors, as well as to some Department of Defense programs.
   Don Amitor, a spokesman for NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center
in Huntsville, Ala., said Morton-Thiokol had enough ammonium
perchlorate in supply for the next five shuttle launches. Under the
present schedule, the fifth launch would be in mid-1989.
   Amidor said a Kerr-McGee plant, also in Henderson, is capable of
making enough ammonium perchlorate for boosters to support eight
space shuttle flights a year.

<TEXT>
   Those who knew him and the global works of
his construction dynasty took stock on Wednesday of the energetic
life of master-builder Stephen Bechtel Sr.
   ``This guy was a builder,'' said former San Francisco Mayor
Joseph Alioto. ``This was a guy who moved the Earth.''
   Bechtel, 88, died Tuesday in Merritt Peralta Medical Center in
Oakland after a brief illness.
   From the construction business his father built out of the ashes
of San Francisco's earthquake of 1906, Bechtel created one of the
world's largest engineering and construction firms, the privately
held Bechtel Group Inc.
   The company built Hoover Dam, pipelines, mines, whole seaports
and harbors, scores of hotels, towering buildings and transportation
systems on seven continents. Among its projects still under
construction is Jubail, an entire Saudi Arabian city of 250,000.
   In World War II, a Bechtel project turned out 560 ships for the
Navy.
   Fortune Magazine called him ``the boldest and maybe the biggest
builder in the world.''
   He retired as board chairman in 1965 but continued as senior
director and roving ambassador for the company. He never completely
retired.
   ``My father was a remarkable man,'' said Stephen Bechtel Jr., who
took over as chairman of Bechtel Group Inc. ``He was also the best
of fathers.''
   Born in Aurora, Ind., in 1900, Stephen Davison Bechtel was a
world business leader who knew presidents, prime ministers and kings
on a first-name basis.
   Bechtel in 1949 overheard an oil company executive remark that a
pipeline from Alberta, Canada, across the Rockies to the Pacific was
a great idea. Bechtel sketched out the plan on the tablecloth.
   A few years later, 80,000 barrels of oil flowed through the
718-mile Canadian Trans-Mountain Pipeline. It was called one of the
most remarkable pipeline engineering feats in history.
   Bechtel managed construction of the four-county Bay Area Rapid
Transit system, and the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, which
Bechtel commuted over from his Oakland home every working day.
   Despite the crush of bridge traffic, which sets most motorists
griping, Bechtel thought it was quite a nice thing to do every day
on the way to his 32nd-floor office in the company's San Francisco
headquarters.
   ``It's a very pleasant ride, and traffic isn't that bad'' he told
a reporter in a rare interview.
   Bechtel was one of the University of California at Berkeley's
most successful dropouts. In a hurry to get on with his vision, he
quit college in 1920, but the university named him Alumnus of the
Year in 1952.
   Berkeley Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman hailed Bechtel's ``loyalty
and generosity'' to the university, particularly in establishing a
$6.3 million engineering center.
   Bechtel leaves his widow, Laura, and their two children, Stephen
and Barbara Bechtel Davies. Funeral services were private.

A $28.5-million upgraded water diversion system under construction near Saticoy 
will save Ventura County an additional 4.2 billion gallons of water each year, 
United Water Conservation District officials say. 
</P>
<P>
A concrete-and-steel dam will replace an earthen structure that now diverts 
nearly 14 billion gallons of Santa Clara River water each year for county use. 
</P>
<P>
The structure, scheduled for completion in March, will stretch 1,740 feet 
across the river basin and rise 25 feet from the riverbed. A specially 
constructed fish ladder will allow rainbow trout to pass from one side of the 
structure to the other. 
</P>
<P>
Water diverted from the Santa Clara River basin is pumped into shallow dirt 
ponds covering 133 acres near Saticoy. Once in the ponds, the water naturally 
percolates through the soil and replenishes the ground-water supply. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the one near Saticoy, the United Water Conservation District 
operates diversion systems in Piru and El Rio along the Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
The improved Saticoy area diversion system will prevent the further intrusion 
of seawater into the Oxnard plain, according to Fred Gientke, United Water 
Conservation District general manager. 
</P>
<P>
More fresh water is being pumped out of the Oxnard plain than is pumped in, 
Gientke said. As a result, underground fresh-water levels have been brought 
down below sea level, and about 25 square miles of the Oxnard plain have been 
contaminated by the intrusion of seawater. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers use 75% of the water pumped out of the Oxnard plain, Gientke said. The 
remaining 25% is used by the cities of Oxnard, Ventura, Camarillo and Port 
Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers and growers are charged $13.50 per acre-foot of water, but local 
municipalities pay $40.50 per acre-foot. One acre-foot of water, or 325,000 
gallons, is about the amount used by a family of four in one year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the new dam will be capable of diverting up to 56,000 acre-feet of 
water per year from the Santa Clara River, most of the river water will flow 
into the ocean. Each year, the river washes about 110,000 acre-feet of fresh 
water, or 35.7 billion gallons, into the Pacific Ocean. JONATHON GAME

A Flood Is Coming
From Pyongyang

North Korea Denies It All

   Water-diversion schemes often cause tension between nations. 
But North Korea and South Korea, the Hatfields and the McCoys of the international set, have elevated a dispute over a hydroelectric dam to new levels of histrionics. 

   To hear U.S. ally South Korea tell it, North Korea has mobilized 50,000 soldiers to build a $1.62 billion dam six miles north of the demilitarized zone that separates the two Koreas. 
The Kumgangsan Dam would then be blown up. 
And the explosion would send a 20 billion-ton wall of water down the Han River toward Seoul, the South's biggest concentration of people and factories. 
A slightly different scenario has the North releasing water from a partially filled reservoir behind the partially built dam so as to disrupt the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. 

   As a countermeasure, South Korea has started collecting public donations for a $700 million "Peace Dam" on its side of the DMZ and about 70 miles upstream from Seoul. 
The southern dam would sit idle, its only purpose being to deflect the flood Seoul says North Korea might let loose. 
The dam is being designed to send the flood back to North Korea. (Five conventional flood-control dams already are in place on the Han between the DMZ and Seoul.) 

   The North confirms that it is building a dam (actually, four dams) but says the South's contention that any such structure has aggressive purposes is a "preposterous lie." 
The biggest dam, according to Pyongyang Radio, would impound only one-eighth the water Seoul claims it would, "and therefore could not possibly threaten the South with flooding." 
On the contrary, the North says, it would help control flooding in the South by reducing the flow of the Han. 
In other words, think of it as a service to South Korea. 

   Seoul officials, says Pyongyang, are "ignobly babbling" about the dam "to divert the disgruntled public attention in South Korea and to bring under control a crisis facing their quaking fascist rule by artificially creating an anti-Communist confrontational commotion." 
Which is quite a mouthful. 

   Of course, the South has good reason to impute malevolent motives to the Northern army's dam-construction activities. 
The two countries technically have remained at war since the 1950-1953 Korean conflict, in which U.S. and United Nations forces aided the South while China sent "volunteers" to fight for the North. 
The unpredictable and rigidly Communist North, which has been ruled by the all-but-deified Kim Il Sung since the war, has engaged in activities that are as threatening as they are bizarre. 

   The North has been caught digging three tunnels under the DMZ, presumably to move troops and equipment. 
North Korean soldiers at the DMZ truce village hacked to death two unarmed U.S. soldiers who had tried to trim a tree in the zone. 
And North Korea is believed to have been behind the 1983 explosion in Rangoon, Burma, that killed 17 visiting South Koreans, including four cabinet officials, and narrowly missed killing South Korean President Chun Doo Hwan. 
Burma convicted two North Korean officers of planting the explosives; Pyongyang denies having taken any part in the bombing. 

   North Korea, which has significantly bolstered its armed forces in the past decade, is a very real military threat. 
With 40,000 U.S. troops in the South, the threat has obvious international meaning beyond the borders of the two Koreas. 
But South Korea has backed away from comments its defense minister made early in the anti-dam campaign last fall that the South would be forced to take "self-defensive measures" -- military as well as economic -- if North Korea continued building the dam. 

   Certain critics of the Seoul government actually see some truth in Pyongyang's accusations that the South is trying to divert attention from anti-government demonstrations by students and others that have flared in recent months. 

   The South's Peace Dam, says Edward J. Baker, the assistant director of Harvard University's Yenching Institute, "is intended to scare the daylights out of the people." 
Adds Selig S. Harrison, an associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace: "The {South Korean} government often uses tension with the North as a reason for domestic suppression. 
There is an increasing feeling among the people that it is overdone. 
Both sides use such absurd propaganda." 

   The campaign to raise $700 million in contributions from the public for the Peace Dam has already collected more than 10% of that sum, remarkable in a country in which annual wages average less than $5,000. 
Everyone from school children to corporate magnates has been inundated with appeals made on television and in newspapers. 

   The government has organized televised rallies. 
Maps and drawings of the potential water devastation -- with a high-water mark one-third the way up the 25-story Daewoo Building and across the top of the National Assembly building -- have been distributed so South Koreans can decide for themselves whether their heads will be above water when the torrent comes down the Han. (South Korean experts say the flood will take 12 to 16 hours to reach Seoul if the North Korean dam is breached, hardly enough time to evacuate a city of eight million people.) 

   Some South Koreans suspect that recent frequent showings of the American movie "Force 10 From Navarone" about Allied commandos who destroy a dam in World War II in order to flood German defenses downstream were part of the government's dam campaign. 
"I think they are trying to tell us something," says an executive of Daewoo Corp., a leading South Korean company. 

   The government says it isn't using the dam issue to divert attention from political dissent at home. 
But Choi Chang Yoon, the vice minister of the Culture and Information Ministry, says a major aim of the dam crusade is to reacquaint South Koreans with the threat from the Communist North. 
He notes that nearly two-thirds of South Korea's population was born after the Korean War ended 33 years ago and that many no longer believe that the North poses a threat. 

   "Their anti-communism is wavering because there is no contact with North Koreans," says a government prosecutor. 
"Their feeling toward North Korea is getting more moderate." 

   There is no way to independently assess whether North Korea's intentions for the dam truly are sinister; intelligence is poor. 
And one doesn't know what to make of the North's public-relations salvos responding to the South's charges. 
Pyongyang even took the unusual step of holding a press conference for foreign reporters and issued a "white paper" dismissing the South's claims. 

   One North Korean assertion does have a certain scary credibility to it. 
North Korea says that blowing up an expensive dam to flood the South would be a waste of good explosives. 
To do the job would take a blast equivalent to a nuclear bomb. 
Better to drop it directly on Seoul. 
That would be "a hundred times better in destructive effect," says Li Choong-Sung, the vice chairman of the North Korean power commission. 

   Pyongyang maintains that its new dam is designed to generate electricity and prevent flooding, and in the latter respect it would be an incidental boon to South Korea. 
Pyongyang says the dam will be only 400 feet high and will impound only 2.6 billion tons of water, not the 20 billion tons that Seoul says would be held behind a 650-foot-high dam, which is nearly as high as the Hoover Dam on the Arizona-Nevada border. 
The total capacity of all four North Korean dams being built in the area would be just 4.7 billion tons, Pyongyang contends. 
The North hasn't replied to a South Korean offer to provide enough electricity to replace what would be produced by the new dam if only Pyongyang would cancel the project. 

   The South says its own Peace Dam will be 726 feet high and will take eight or nine years to complete, which means that it would be finished several years earlier than the North Korean dam, whose reservoir could take five years just to fill with water.

  [Text] Zhengzhou, May 28 (XINHUA) -- Four Chinese and 
foreign companies have won the bid for three major parts of the 
World Bank financed Xiaolangdi water control dam construction 
project on the middle reaches of the Yellow River. 
  The Inpergilo company of Italy, the No. 14 Water Conservancy 
and Hydroelectric Engineering Bureau of China, and Dumiz Company 
of France and the No. 6 Water Conservancy and Hydroelectric 
Engineering Bureau of China, which are selected among more than 
30 Chinese and foreign companies, have been given the jobs of 
building the dam, culverts and spillways, and facilities for 
generating electricity. 
  They have formed two international joint management groups 
to 
achieve best effect and will soon start work on the construction 
site. 
  Xiaolangdi water control dam is among the first of its kind 
in China to select builders through international bidding and 
the practice is in accordance with requirements of the World 
Bank. 
  Earlier reports also showed that the Xiaolangdi water 
control 
project, situated 40 km north of Luoyang city, Henan Province, 
has won a loan of 570 million U.S. dollars from the World Bank. 
  As a project to introduce World Bank loans, the Xiaolangdi 
water control dam has received the assessment of 15 delegations 
sent by the World Bank since 1988. 
  Through concerted efforts from Chinese and foreign experts, 
the Xiaolangdi Dam is believed to have basically met the 
requirements for appraisal from the World Bank in aspects such 
as engineering technology, dam safety, relocation of people, 
budgetary estimates of projects, economic and financial 
analysis, consultancy of supervised management in construction, 
training program of technical workers, and the drafting of the 
tender documents. 
  Preparatory work for the Xiaolangdi water control project, 
which was initiated in September 1991, has been completed ahead 
of schedule after two years' efforts from 15,000 builders. 
  The preparatory work has cost about 1.2 billion yuan (about 
137 million U.S. dollars). It includes facilities for 
transport, water and electricity supplies, telecommunications 
and facilities to house the construction workers, according to 
earlier reports. 
  The relocation of the first 10,000 local residents in the 
construction area -- mainly in Jiyuan and Mengjin Counties of 
central China's Henan Province -- has also come to an end, with 
full support from local governments and farmers concerned. At 
the same time, the Ministry of Water Resources has also 
established a department in charge of construction and a 
department responsible for supervised management in accordance 
with international common practices, as well as management 
information system of projects. 
  More than 300 supervisory engineers have been brought in 
from 
across the country to attend training courses where lectures are 
given by World Bank officials. 
  When completed, the Xiaolangdi water control project will be 
the largest conservancy works on the Yellow River and will be 
China's second biggest after the Three Gorges Dam on the Chang 
Jiang. It will play an important role in diverting the Yellow 
River flow, preventing floods, generating power and controlling 
sediment, according to experts. 
  The experts say that the entire project, which will take 11 
years to finish, together with other reservoirs nearby, will 
enable the lower reaches of the Yellow River to absorb a flood 
of a magnitude that occurs only once in one thousand years.

   Finally, the corps proceeded.
   The decision to build the dam was vindicated before construction
was completed, Green says. In 1982, fire destroyed the Heppner Post
Office, the store next door and a vacant building near the center of
town. None could have been rebuilt under the FEMA restriction.
   Ed Hiemstra remains one of the most outspoken opponents of the
Willow Creek Dam. From his back yard, he has a clear view of the
dam's wet face.
   ``We can see it's disintegrating, but they're not telling us
anything,'' he complains. ``They were looking for a sparsely settled
area so they could experiment with this new type of dam, and now
we're stuck with it.''
   It was the first in the world to employ a quick and inexpensive
construction technique in which concrete is built up in layers like
a cake instead of molded and slabbed.
   Twenty dams have been built since the roller compacted concrete
construction (RCC) method was pioneered at Willow Creek. And
engineers are still perfecting the technique.
   As Ronnie M. Lemons wrote in the October 1988 issue of ``Civil
Engineering'' magazine, ``Even with the technology as it exists
today, RCC dams leak...As yet there is no consensus on how to stop
those leaks.''
   When it first was filled in 1983, the Willow Creek Dam leaked
nearly 3,000 gallons a minute. A $2 million grouting project in 1984
reduced the leakage by 95 percent.
   A greater problem than leaking, however, may be the corrosion of
the dam from within.
   In 1984, a study by environmental engineer William Funk of the
Washington State University Water Research Center predicted water
quality problems at Willow Creek.
   With experience in other cattle and sheep-feeding areas, Funk
could predict a watershed rich with the kind of nutrients that can
destroy concrete. While not opposed to the dam, he said its
construction weighed heavily on his mind.
   ``I expected to see a real mess there,'' he says.
   Corps scientists were surprised to find water quality
deteriorating more rapidly and dramatically than Funk had
anticipated. After four years of study, they still are not sure what
it all means.
   ``We're not alarmed, but we are concerned,'' says Doug Larson, a
lake scientist who has spent years studying the waters behind Willow
Creek Dam.
   ``We have all the compounds present that can deteriorate
concrete. We just don't know how intense they are. The big question
is: How quickly is this happening?''
   He says the answers are at least eight months away. Consultants
are studying the geochemical processes occurring in the dam and the
reservoir, while others are analyzing the presence of volatile
methane gases and the effect of concrete-corroding acids.
   ``The corps' reputation and future is on the line,'' says Cliff
Green. ``They can't say, `You've got a problem and it may break _
send us a post card.' They have to do something.''
   David Sykes, publisher of the Gazette-Times newspaper, says the
corps already has lost credibility among the residents of Heppner.
   In an angry editorial, Sykes demanded an independent analysis of
the dam's safety.
   ``We need more than a dose of the corps' publicity machine,''
Sykes wrote. ``We need some action, to tell the truth, and it should
come from our elected representatives.
   ``Word is out that the Willow Creek Dam is sick. The Corps of
Engineers says everything is fine. But we, the people of Heppner,
need a second opinion.''

<HEAD>Environmentalists Pleased That Bush Emphasizes Federal Cleanup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists are applauding President
Bush's budget emphasis on repairing damage caused by construction
of dams and other federal water projects.
   ``The president said he wanted to be known as the environmental
president,'' David Campbell, an economist with the Wildlife
Federation, said Monday. ``This actually is a fairly good start.''
   ``We've been arguing for years that both the Corps of Engineers
and the Bureau of Reclamation have overdue mitigation,'' he said.
``We should be redirecting these agency budgets from all this
harmful construction into something more environmentally
beneficial.''
   The $3.2 billion for the 1991 fiscal year for the Army Corps of
Engineers _ about the same as sought last year _ designates several
million dollars for environmental repairs and continues funding for
construction projects under way, but offers no money for new
projects.
   ``The civil works program and budget reflect the new emphasis
placed by the administration on maintaining and restoring the
environment,'' the corps said in its explanation of the budget.
   Major provisions addressing environmental concerns are:
   _$16 million for construction of juvenile fish passage
facilities on the Columbia and Snake Rivers in Washington, Oregon
and Idaho.
   _$20 million to begin acquisition of 88,000 acres to mitigate
environmental losses caused by construction of the
Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway Project in Alabama and Mississippi.
   _$13 million to plan repairs to the environment damaged by
construction of Richard B. Russell Lake in South Carolina and
Georgia, and areas of Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas and Missouri after
navigational improvements were made on the Missouri River.
   Campbell noted Congress gave the administration authority in
1986 to seek federal funds for the next five years to buy private
land around the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway for environmental
restoration, but the administration didn't act until this year's
budget _ the last year of the authorization.
   Campbell estimated $20 million should be enough to acquire about
47,000 acres this year.
   The fisheries on the Columbia River also are desperately needed
to restore salmon to the waterway which Campbell called ``decimated
by the dam-builders,'' who started building on the river in 1935.
   The president has asked for $1.039 billion, including $616
million in construction outlays, for the Bureau of Reclamation, an
agency within the Interior Department that assists in the
construction of irrigation reservoirs in the arid West.
   The proposal calls for a halt to federal spending on the
Garrison Diversion Unit in North Dakota, which was authorized by
Congress in 1965 to provide water to the eastern section of the
state through canals and rivers.
   The president's budget calls Garrison is ``an uneconomic and
environmentally destructive project which would require in excess
of $1 billion to complete.''
   No major new construction starts are proposed. However, dam
safety work and environmental damage mitigation at existing
projects, and most water projects already in construction would
receive continued funding.

  [Text] Vientiane, January 11 (KPL) -- The construction of a 
hydro-power dam on Ho River in the Province of Champassak is in 
progress, said the head of the project, Mr. Bounkeut 
Khamphaphongphan. 
  The main work done in the past two months includes building 
a 
26-km road from Lasasin area to the construction site of the 
dam. The road is the first to link the area and the province of 
Attopeu. 
  The dam construction is a project the Government of Laos has 
signed a contract with a construction company of South Korea in 
the form of BOT 'build-operate-transfer'. This means that the 
investor puts money into building the facility then recovers its 
cost within 30 years. The Lao party holds a share of 20 per 
cent. After the period, the facility will be transferred to the 
Lao Government. 
  According to the official, now equipment worth U.S. dollars 
five million has reached the site, and field survey has started 
using a seismic equipment to define the construction site. 
  Another work to be done soon is determining water and forest 
areas for catchment, areas for conservation of bio-diversity, 
areas for tourism and areas where evacuation of people will be 
made. 
  This building project was scheduled for four years. The 
water current will be blocked in May 1996 and trial operation 
will be in the middle of October 1996. The hydro-power dam has 
a 150 megawatt capacity. The height of the dam is 80 metres 
while the width of its foot is 300 metres. The dam crest will 
be used as a road for vehicles to go to Attopeu District and 
Vietnam.

   Supporters of the proposed Two Forks Dam in
Colorado say they may go to court to challenge a decision by
federal environmental officials to kill the project.
   If the veto of the dam by the Environmental Protection Agency is
sustained, it could set a precedent for similar projects, they
said.
   William H. Van Schooneveld, chairman of the Metropolitan Water
Providers that sponsored the Colorado dam, said, ``This decision
affects not just Denver, but it may be the end of all big water
projects. If EPA can veto this, there really isn't any project that
anybody can develop that can pass the EPA.''
   ``There are a lot of grounds for (a federal court) appeal,'' he
said.
   Conservationists hailed the EPA action.
   Hope Babcock, general counsel for the National Audubon Society,
said, ``The era of building these enormous projects is over.''
   EPA announced the veto of the dam Friday night, confirming
earlier unofficial reports.
   The proposed Two Forks Dam would be the largest non-federal
water project in the West. It had been supported by Reagan
administration officials.
   Assistant EPA administrator for water, LaJuana S. Wilcher,
announced Friday she would uphold the recommendation of EPA's
Denver office to bar construction of the 615-foot dam just
downstream of the confluence of the South Platte River and its
North Fork.
   The city of Denver and 40 suburban water providers sought
approval to construct a 359-billion gallon reservoir southwest of
Denver to meet water needs well into the next century. The Army
Corps of Engineers said in March 1989 it would grant a permit to
dam the river, subject to EPA review.
   Conservationists opposed the project because it called for
flooding 30 miles of scenic river and ruining 14 miles of top-class
trout fishing.
   Denver proposed a smaller, 147-billion gallon reservoir and a
package of measures aimed at minimizing harmful environmental
effects.
   ``The applicants made a good-faith effort to downscale the
project size and compensate for the loss of wetlands and aquatic
resources,'' Wilcher said.
   ``However, the smaller project would still flood 24 miles of
freely flowing, scenic stream and almost 11 miles of gold medal
trout fishery. ... It would inundate an area of unquestionable
natural beauty that provides a diversity of fishing and
recreational opportunities and a rich aquatic habitat close to the
Denver metropolitan area.''
   The Army's environmental impact statement in 1988 identified
several other choices. Wilcher said EPA agreed that ``less
environmentally damaging, practicable alternatives exist,'' and the
agency would ``make every effort to provide timely comment and
guidance on other alternatives.''
   Big dams have made possible the growth of big cities and big
farms in the West. Critics say that too many water resources have
been diverted, threatening the balance of nature.

<TEXT>
   Goose Prairie has been described as
``a bit of heaven,'' but residents fear a plan to enlarge a nearby
reservoir may sink the outskirts of their pristine haven in a
watery grave.
   Life in the Cascade Mountain village would be altered forever if
the Bumping Lake reservoir is expanded to more than 13 times its
present capacity in an effort to help drought-stricken Northwest
farmers, residents say.
   But after three decades of debate, Rep. Sid Morrison, R-Wash.,
who represents Bumping Lake and Goose Prairie, says he will sponsor
a bill calling for the expansion. Other area congressmen have
pledged to support the legislation.
   ``It will commercialize the Goose Praire area,'' complained Chet
Clark, who lives in the remote mountain village during the summers.
``You'll have people, construction workers, staying there.
   ``It will have quite an impact on the hiking, the fishing and
the camping.''
   The village, with five permanent residences, 14 summer cabins
and a couple of businesses, is at the end of a narrow blacktop
road, near Mount Rainier National Park.
   Huge evergreens absorb noise and sunlight, giving the area a
cathedral-like stillness. The Bumping River, named by Indians
because of its rocks, races a few feet beyond the edge of the road.
The snow-covered Cascade Range looms overhead.
   ``Goose Praire is a bit of heaven in all seasons,'' Supreme
Court Justice William O. Douglas, a dogged environmentalist, wrote
in his 1974 autobiography, ``Go East, Young Man.''
   Douglas, who grew up in nearby Yakima, first came to Goose
Prairie as a boy and wrote of it in his memoirs after making a home
there away from Washington, D.C.
   ``Goose Prairie is now a part of a technological society which
may in time destroy it,'' wrote Douglas, who died in 1980. ``But
the values of the Prairie are so precious, so unique _ that all who
love the Goose Prairies of this continent will put up a valiant
fight to preserve them.''
   Those words proved prophetic, as environmental groups have lined
up against the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation plans to expand the
reservoir.
   ``Douglas I'm sure would be turning over once again to see this
perennial project has arisen,'' said David Ortman, Northwest
representative for Friends of the Earth and a leading opponent of
the project.
   Ortman said greater water conservation efforts, not bigger
reservoirs, are needed. The dam would inundate 1,600 acres of
never-logged old growth forests, some hundreds of years old, which
provide habitat for creatures not found elsewhere, he said.
   In addition, there would not be enough water to fill the
reservoir for many years, leaving unsightly mud flats, he said.
   Bumping Lake is one of five reservoirs that provide irrigation
to the half-million-acre Yakima Project. Built in 1910, the 60-foot
dam backs up 33,700 acre feet of water that drains from the slopes
of the Cascades, providing water for the fertile but arid Yakima
Valley.
   The $150 million expansion project would include a 240-foot high
dam 4,000 feet downstream from the existing dam, 2 miles from Goose
Prairie. The new dam would create a 458,000 acre foot storage
reservoir.
   A total of 3,000 new acres would be inundated, including some
summer cabins and campgrounds at the lake. The village itself is
below the dam and would not be covered by water, but expansion
opponents fear their lifestyle would be disrupted and resources
like hiking trails would be destroyed.
   The dam is just outside the boundaries of the William O. Douglas
Wilderness area, where such developments would be prohibited.
Douglas opposed just about all development in the area.
   ``I was teaching at Yale when news came that a road would take
the place of the trail'' (to Goose Prairie), he wrote. ``I almost
wept at the thought of pot-bellied, cigar-smoking men roaming
through a sacrosanct valley and polluting it with the noise and
fumes of cars.
   ``I wrote, I protested, complained, but progress won out, as it
usually does.''

   Gov. Roy Romer today recommended that a permit be
issued to build the $500 million Two Forks dam and reservoir, but
he attached a slew of conditions and said the project should be
built only as a last resort.
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has the final say in issuing
the permit for the project, which has been proposed by the Denver
Water Board and a group called Metro Water Providers, a consortium
of 42 Denver-area water providers and municipalities.
   Col. Steve G. West, district engineer for the Army Corps of
Engineers, said the governor's recommendation will be one of many
factors considered in deciding whether the project is in the public
interest.
   Two Forks would be built just downstream from the confluence of
the South Platte River and its North Fork, about 25 miles southwest
of Denver. It would flood 20 miles of scenic Cheesman Canyon, a
prospect that has upset environmentalists and sportsmen.
   ``Colorado should build Two Forks, in my judgment, only as a
last resort,'' the governor told a packed news conference at the
state Capitol. He added that he believes it has only a 50-50 chance
of being constructed even with his approval of the permit.
   ``I am challenging the state to find an alternate solution and I
think I can,'' Romer said.
   Denver officials say Two Forks would add 98,000 acre-feet of
water to the city's water system, enough to meet Denver's water
needs through the year 2035.
   Project planners say Two Forks' 615-foot-high dam and reservoir
would take two years to design and five years to build, meaning it
would be usable in 1995 at the earliest.
   Proponents have painted the project as crucial to the
metropolitan area's growth. Opponents say it would needlessly wipe
out 20 miles of Gold Medal trout fishing and nearby recreation
areas and would pose a threat to whooping crane habitat and
irrigators along the Platte River in Nebraska.
   Romer said he wants to save Cheesman Canyon and possibly make it
a state recreational area. But in order to do so, he said, his
favored alternative _ a dam and reservoir west of the Two Forks
site _ may have to be be built, flooding the town of Bailey.
   ``There is a cost in saving the canyon. The cost is in moving
Bailey,'' Romer said.
   The governor said he would recommend a 25-year shelf life for
the project, meaning it could be built anytime during that period.
   But he attached conditions to his approval of the permit: a
metropolitan-area water conservation program; creation of a
Metropolitan Water Authority to plan distribution of water supplies
in the Denver area; a requirement that metro water providers share
existing water supplies, and full implementation of a mitigation
plan to replace wildlife habitat and recreational facilities if Two
Forks is ever built.

   The construction of the Xingo dam, a
massive public works project of the outgoing administration of
President Jose Sarney, is being halted because of a cash shortage,
company officials announced Monday.
   A three-company consortium in charge of building the dam said
the federal government was $138 million behind in payments to the
project.
   As a result, the consortium must halt construction within 24
hours and lay off 2,050 workers, officials said.
   ``We've gone as far as we could, but we're convinced that we're
never going to see this money, '' said consortium superintendent
Ruiter Neto Campos at a Monday press conference in the northeastern
city of Recife.
   However, Campos said the group will resume work if the
government pays its debt.
   The dam was being built on the Sao Francisco River in
northeastern Bahia state.
   A $110 billion foreign debt coupled with growing internal debt
has drained federal coffers and stalled numerous public works.
   The 5,000-megawatt Xingo dam, projected to cost $2.5 billion, is
considered essential to supplying northeastern Brazil with
electricity by 1994. The dam is about 20 percent complete.

  [Text] The Namko Hydroelectric Dam project will be built in 
Oudomsai Province with a generation capacity of 1,500 kilowatts. 
The dam structure will consist of a 6-meter high concrete water 
brake to house the primary and secondary power generators 
located on an area of 498 square meters, propelled by water from 
a 1.95 by 3.275 meter window of the 836-meter long water tunnel. 
An irrigation canal 1,934-meters long will be built from the 
dam to irrigated areas. The construction of the project will 
begin in November 1994 and will be completed within 26 months 
with a loan of 59.9 million yuan from the PRC Government. A 
construction contract for the project has already been signed 
with the PRC's National Comprehensive Tools Import-Export 
Company. 
  The contract to build this hydroelectric dam was signed in 
Vientiane on 17 June between Sommano Phonsena, representing the 
Electrification Installation Company of the Lao People's 
Democratic Republic [LPDR] and Ms. (Ze Ping-fu), representing 
the PRC's Comprehensive Tools Import-Export Company, in the

   They're few in number, and their sky-island
habitat has long lain undisturbed. But 180 tiny Mount Graham red
squirrels could prove a big obstacle to construction of the world's
most powerful optical telescope.
   The University of Arizona wants nothing more than to coexist
with the mountaintop rodents, an endangered subspecies. But the
builder of a $200 million observatory atop 10,709-foot Mount Graham
is having to tread carefully.
   The 8-ounce squirrel, or Tamiasciurus hudsonicus grahamensis,
has touched off a two-year ecological controversy that has split
the scientific community, pitted one federal agency against
another, and drawn environmentalists into a battle against
telescope proponents from as far away as the Vatican.
   U.S. District Judge Alfredo C. Marquez will hear closing
arguments Monday afternoon on whether a third federal biological
study is needed before construction begins this year on two smaller
telescopes.
   If all goes smoothly, the Columbus Project, a 600-inch-diameter
device expected to be six times more powerful than any telescope in
use, will be built in the mid-1990s on the 8.6-acre tract in the
Pinaleno Mountains 110 miles northeast of Tucson.
   Just 180 of the squirrels, which have been traced back 10,000
years or more, are believed to remain, and Mount Graham is their
only known habitat.
   Opposition groups say perching the telescopes on Emerald Peak,
one of Mount Graham's three peaks, can only assure that the
squirrels become a biological footnote.
   ``It's biologically indefensible to develop on that mountain,''
said Dr. Robin Silver, spokesman for the Maricopa Audubon Society.
``We will win this case. The question is will we win it before the
university wreaks too much destruction on the mountain?''
   The university, argued its vice president for research, Michael
Cusanovich, ``is the most likely participant to provide the basis
for the Mount Graham red squirrel's recovery.'' It spent more than
$200,000 last year on research and monitoring and will put aside
more than $100,000 annually for several years, he said.
   A two-mile access road for the Mount Graham International
Observatory has already been built. But opponents have so far held
up construction of the observatory buildings.
   The squirrels apparently have some militant supporters. One
mailed an anonymous death threat to telescope proponent Conrad
Istock, head of the University of Arizona's ecology and
evolutionary biology department.
   Eleven of the department's 28 faculty members and 41 of 58
graduate students have voiced opposition to the observatory. But
students at the 38,000-student university later voted down by 57
percent to 43 percent a nonbinding initiative opposing the
observatory. Fewer than 5,000 students voted.
   In July 1988, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service concluded in a
biological report for the U.S. Forest Service, the site's landlord,
that the telescopes could coexist with the squirrel.
   Arizona's congressional delegation then pushed through
legislation ordering the Forest Service to grant the university a
special-use permit allowing construction.
   But an environmental coalition intervened with a lawsuit.
Naturalists have staged demonstrations outside the Vatican Embassy
and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.
   The university says it will advertise soon for construction bids
for the two smaller telescopes, one of which is partly financed by
the Vatican Observatory. Pope John Paul II is among the Vatican's
astronomy buffs.
   Two biologists who took part in the Fish and Wildlife Service
study alleged in depositions that officials at the agency ordered
researchers to argue in favor of construction.
   The agency's regional director, Mike Spear, upheld the study as
``biologically sound.'' But, last month, after the construction
site was designated as a critical habitat, Spear called for a
review study.
   However, the Forest Service says the congressional act
authorizes the first three telescopes and exempts them from further
review.
   Spear said the Endangered Species Act makes clear there should
be reconsultation before change in the habitat, while Forest
Service regional chief Dave Jolly said Congress intentionally
skirted the Act.
   University officials contend that poor cone crops in recent
years have hurt the squirrel population, that hunting, logging, use
of off-road vehicles and Christmas tree-cutting have been stopped
because of the planned observatory, and that 60 to 80 acres will be
reforested.
   Silver, who is a wildlife photographer, likened the squirrel's
predicament to that of the snail darter, a 3-inch fish that delayed
the Tennessee River dam project for six years during the 1970s
before it was transplanted to the Hiwassee River.
   ``They're very similar in that the developmental groups managed
to ignore ecosystem destruction and focused the issue on one
creature that was easily demeaned in their project,'' Silver said.
   The dam was completed with Congress first amending the
Endangered Species Act in 1978 to allow an exemption from the law,
then exempting the dam from any law that would hinder its
construction, he said.
   Dan Campbell, director of the Nature Conservancy in Arizona,
says Mount Graham has Arizona's greatest density of black bears,
and is the farthest south that elk can be found in the United
States.
   ``It's the general habitat which we really need to protect and
conserve in order to protect the species,'' he said. ``It's like a
lifeboat. If you keep the lifeboat from sinking, then the species
stay there.''

<LEADPARA>  HERBERT Hoover is funnier than "Charlie Hoover." Hoover vacuum cleaners are
funnier than "Charlie Hoover." Hoover Dam is funnier than "Charlie Hoover.";

<MEMO>  Television  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Though Kinison is unfunny most of the time, he's not the reason the show
offers fewer laughs than Hoover Tower.;   Better jokes in graffiti;   No,
blame that on the stupid premise -- Kinison is the 8-inch-tall alter ego of a
business exec, played by Tim Matheson -- and the stupider writing.;   There
are better jokes on bathroom walls all over America than in the 22 minutes of
torture the producers sent out for preview. That was the second episode,
because they were still tinkering with tonight's show.;   "Charlie Hoover" is
a crude variation on one of Fox's other unfunny shows, "Herman's Head,"
introduced just a couple of months ago. In that one the gimmick is that a guy
named Herman has four characters who represent different aspects of his
personality talking in his head; in this one, Matheson has the miniature
Kinison on his desk -- and the worst laugh track in the business.;   'Get a
Life' is back;   Fox is packaging this mess with the return of Chris Elliott's
"Get a Life," (9:30, Chs. 2, 35, 40). If you liked that show last season,
you'll probably like it again. If you didn't, don't bother giving it another
shot. It's as infantile and post-Letterman as before -- a blessing to some and
a curse to others. You know who you are.  </TEXT>

<P>
The tall metal towers look like giant legs striding across seemingly endless 
deserts, tramping up and over lofty mountains, marching through towns and 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
And, if you look closely, sometimes you see in the distance tiny dots climbing 
or clinging to the glistening soaring steel, like spiders on enormous webs in 
the sky. 
</P>
<P>
The animate specks are the linemen who erect, maintain and repair the 100- to 
250-foot-high electrical transmission towers. 
</P>
<P>
These high-wire acrobats of the utility world stroll nonchalantly across iron 
beams 100, 200, 250 feet in midair, hang sideways and upside down from their 
precarious perches securing huge bolts with giant wrenches. 
</P>
<P>
By the time they're in their early 40s, most of these men are ready to climb 
off the towers to find less strenuous work on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good money. Sure it's always a risk. The idea is not to get careless, not 
to get electrocuted, not to fall," explained veteran towerman Richard 
Dominguez, 40, who says he will keep doing this job as long as he can. 
</P>
<P>
He had scrambled down in no time from the peak of the 150-foot tower under 
construction in the desert near Laughlin. It was lunchtime, and he was hungry. 
</P>
<P>
It was high noon on a 100-degree-plus day. Dominguez gulped a cold soft drink, 
wiped the sweat from his leathery face and continued talking about the job he 
swears he would not trade for any other. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting to be in the air. You always have the feeling you are doing 
something not everyone can do. When the power goes out anywhere on the 
conductor lines on Southern California Edison Co. transmission towers, we're 
the guys who get it back on as fast as we can." 
</P>
<P>
Edison has 24,000 huge transmission towers carrying 69,000 to 500,000-volt 
electrical conductor lines along a 12,000-mile path from Hoover Dam, from the 
Palo Verdes nuclear plant near Phoenix, from generating plants, from dams on 
both the eastern and western slopes of the High Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
The towers carry power for 10 million people in 14 Central and Southern 
California counties, for homes and apartments, schools and stores, factories 
and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The 185 linemen who service these towers deal with it all -- windstorms, 
snowstorms, salt storms, earthquakes, fires, floods, torrential rains, dense 
fog, subzero cold and 120- to 130-degree heat at all hours of the day and 
night. When there is an outage, they go. Another 64 brave souls do the same 
kind of work for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which provides 
electricity to 3.4 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
Now and then a lineman is killed or seriously injured in a fall or is 
electrocuted. It doesn't happen often, but the danger is always there. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Bratten, 42, shot and wounded at Tay Nihn in Vietnam with the 9th Infantry 
Division, has been an Edison Co. towerman for 23 years. "I took three shots of 
13,800 volts several years ago. It burned the wedding ring off my finger, but I 
survived and came back after a few days to recuperate," Bratten recalled. 
</P>
<P>
He told how his father advised him to apply for a job with a utility company 
"for security" after he got out of the Army. "I took the telephone, gas and 
Edison Co. test. Edison paid more. So I came here. I was asked if I was scared 
of heights. I said I didn't think so," Bratten said. 
</P>
<P>
He worked on the towers until six years ago, when he became a tower 
construction foreman, and now works only on the ground. "That's a long ways up 
when you're in your 40s. By the time most men get to be Dominguez's age they 
get jobs on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"Working in the air is a wonderful job for young men. It pays $19.68 an hour 
for a journeyman (after serving a three-year apprenticeship) with lots of 
overtime and out-of-town subsistence money. You get in your late 30s and early 
40s and you wear out. 
</P>
<P>
"It's strenuous work. The older you get the tougher it gets. Leg and back 
operations are part of the job. I've had eight operations on my legs. The 
cartilage is gone on both legs. I loved every minute on the tower and miss it a 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
There's plenty to be fearful about in this line of work -- height, wind, 
electrocution. 
</P>
<P>
"We're up there in 20- and 30-mile winds all the time," said Steve Berczik, 40. 
"Winds can blow towers over. Last year, a 100-mile wind leveled eight towers 
out by Blythe." 
</P>
<P>
Stan (A-to-Z) Alachniewicz, 34, who became a towerman five years ago after 
losing his job when the Kaiser steel plant in Fontana closed, had to conquer 
his qualms about working at great heights. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overcame Fear 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't real fond of heights," he said. "Some guys sign on and have to quit 
because they can't stand heights. But I had to get a job to support my family. 
When you need to do it, you got to overcome that fear, but it still bothers me 
and everybody else at times." 
</P>
<P>
Alex Garcia, 27, 3 1/2 years on the job, served four years in the Marines and 
knew he could hack it because he was lowered 200 feet on ropes from 
helicopters. "The first climb of the day you still get a little nervous. You 
try to be extremely careful at all times and watch what you're doing. Edison 
drills the safety factor into our heads all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Racine, 41, a foreman who worked in the air for 18 years, and was also 
wounded in the Vietnam War while in the Army, told how new men on the job spend 
six months to a year as groundmen sending material and tools to the linemen on 
towers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are as safety conscious as you can be but sometimes there are accidents and 
we do get hurt, no doubt about it. But that's understandable considering the 
heights the men work at and working around live wires with tremendous voltage. 
You hold on tight, strapped to steel with a web belt while working." 
</P>
<P>
Racine was on a tower when a fellow worker was electrocuted and helped lower 
the man's body to the ground. Dwayne Ryssman, 29, who flies gliders in his 
spare time, said wives don't want to know about the job or think about what 
their husbands do from day to day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Erecting Tower 
</P>
<P>
The 10-man crew erected the tower near Laughlin in three days to bring more 
power from the Edison generating plant here to a nearby Nevada Power Co. 
facility providing additional electricity for the fast-growing gambling resort 
community on the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
Putting a tower together is much like constructing a giant piece from a Erector 
Set with ground crews and a huge crane hoisting steel beams to linemen on the 
tower who set them in place and bolt them together. "It takes more than a 
screwdriver and a pair of pliers to put it together," laughed Alachniewicz. 
</P>
<P>
If the towers are accessible, the linemen drive to the job, but more often the 
towers are in rugged inaccessible desert or mountainous terrain and the men 
have to be flown in by helicopter or walk from one to two miles to dense 
forested areas from lumber roads or fire breaks. 
</P>
<P>
The linemen are often away from their families from a week to a month. And 
during natural disasters or power failures, working 40 to 60 hours nonstop 
without sleep is not that uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be easier ways of making a living, but I wouldn't trade this for 
love nor money," insisted Berczik, his sentiments echoed by the other human 
spiders working in midair with web belts strapped tightly to the 150-foot tower 
nearing completion at Laughlin.

OUTLOOK IMPROVES FOR ORANGE COUNTY FLOOD CONTROL 
</P>

<P>
Two multimillion-dollar dam projects in West Virginia may help Orange County 
squeeze $20 million out of Congress to finally begin construction of the 
long-delayed Santa Ana River flood-control project. 
</P>
<P>
Approved 2 1/2 years ago, but not yet financed, the Santa Ana River project has 
been designated a top priority by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The agency 
has declared the Santa Ana River the worst flood threat west of the 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the House of Representatives, seeking to trim the federal budget 
deficit, decided against financing any of the agency's new water projects, 
including the Santa Ana River venture. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, officials working to get financing for the massive Santa Ana 
River undertaking, which is expected to cost nearly $1.4 billion and take years 
to complete, said they are encouraged about the prospects for beginning 
construction in the 1990 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, for fiscal year '89, Congress did not fund any new projects. We 
believe that was only a one-year policy," said David C. Kenyon, acting chief of 
the programs division of the Army Corps of Engineers' civil works directorate. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very optimistic that we will end the moratorium on new starts this year," 
said Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento), a member of the House Appropriations 
Committee's energy and water subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the new optimism is the corps' inclusion high on its proposed 
funding list this year of two projects in West Virginia -- $17.9 million to 
replace an old dam-and-lock system on the Monongahela River and $20.8 million 
for a similar project on the Kanawha River. 
</P>
<P>
Those two projects, which were not in last year's proposal, are expected to 
provide a special incentive to a key player in the funding process, Sen. Robert 
C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), to clear the logjam over new money for flood control. Byrd 
is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and a member of the energy 
and water subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
"That was smart thinking on their (the corps') part," said James F. McConnell, 
Orange County's lobbyist in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Highland), a leading supporter of the Santa Ana project, 
said, "I'm not sure that the corps has (made) those sorts of links." However, 
he added: "Stranger things have happened in the business of making sausage." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expresses Reservations 
</P>
<P>
Approval by the Senate Appropriations Committee is seen as a major hurdle for 
the project. Last month, Sen. Mark O. Hatfield (R-Ore.), ranking minority 
member of the Senate panel, publicly expressed reservations about beginning new 
water projects if long-term financing cannot be assured. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the project believe that the House will be more receptive to 
flood-control fund requests. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Orange County's congressional delegation said Fazio and Lewis are 
leading the lobbying push for the Santa Ana River project, which is designed to 
ease the danger of disastrous flooding in Lewis' San Bernardino County 
district, as well as Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The Corps of Engineers has estimated that in the kind of flood disaster that 
might occur every 200 years, the rising river could kill as many as 3,000 
people and cause as much as $11 billion in property damage over its 100-mile 
course from the mountains in San Bernardino County to the ocean near Newport 
Beach. The river slices through about 30 miles of Orange County's most densely 
populated urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
During recent hearings before the energy and water subcommittee, Lewis urged 
the panel to approve $32 million to begin the flood-control work. That request 
was endorsed by the full Orange County congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tremendous Help' 
</P>
<P>
"We've had tremendous help from the members" from Orange County, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials expect that in the next week or two, the subcommittee will receive 
word from the full Appropriations Committee on how much money it may spend on 
water projects. Once that figure is known, prospects for the Santa Ana project 
will become clearer, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Although a number of members have requested that we appropriate more for the 
project than (the $20 million) in the President's budget, it is too early to 
determine whether we will be able to augment that amount," Fazio said. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher, in an interview, said he has repeatedly raised the issue with the 
subcommittee chairman, Rep. Tom Bevill (D-Ala.). "The man who's got more 
leverage on this knows firsthand that we're going to have thousands of our 
citizens dead if this doesn't go through," Rohrabacher said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said: "I consider it to be a crucial year as far as the project's chance 
of coming forward. The next four or five years don't look easy in terms of 
budget considerations." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Begin Building Dam 
</P>
<P>
The $20 million requested this year would allow the corps to begin constructing 
a new dam in San Bernardino County on the upper Santa Ana River, to be called 
the Seven Oaks Dam, and pay for other preliminary engineering and design work. 
The new dam would be 550 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
A quarter of the $20 million would pay for acquisition of wetlands near the 
mouth of the Santa Ana River to provide protection for two birds -- the 
California least tern and Belding's sparrow, whose habitats would be endangered 
by the project. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the project would raise the level of Prado Dam by 36 feet to 
accommodate storage of an additional 195,000 acre-feet of water and upgrade 
flood channels along the Santa Ana River and Santiago Creek. Included would be 
major improvements to the Talbert Channel, the failure of which led to 
widespread damage in the 1983 floods. Some channels would be lined with 
concrete, while others would be graded and widened. 
</P>
<P>
All but $364 million of the total project cost of nearly $1.4 billion would be 
paid by the federal government.

<DESCRIPT>  SANTA-CRUZ; PROBE; ALTERNATIVE; WATER; CONSUMER  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Looking for ways to expand its limited water supply to overcome droughts and
meet population growth in the coming decade, the city of Santa Cruz is
literally "testing the waters" of 13 potential new water sources.;    The
alternatives range from relatively inexpensive, politically acceptable
solutions, such as using treated wastewater for landscape irrigation, to
highly controversial, multimillion-dollar undertakings such as constructing a
dam along the county's north coast.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  SANTA CRUZ HOPES TO TAP NEW WATER SOURCES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "We're going to need to expand in some manner," said Ann-Marie Mitroff,
conservation coordinator for the Santa Cruz Water Department. "Otherwise we
could get into a situation where we'll be rationing almost every year.";   
The population served by the Santa Cruz Water Department is expected to grow
from the current 80,000 to 105,000 by the year 2005.;    Last week, the city's
water commission recommended hiring a Walnut Creek engineering firm to rank
potential new water sources based on cost and environmental impact. The city
council is expected to award a $370,000 contract to that firm, Camp, Dresser &amp;
McKee, at its meeting tonight .;    Under terms of a draft contract, the
company would conduct a detailed study of 13 new sources outlined in the
city's 1989 master water plan. Engineers would report to the council in fall
1992 with a list ranking the projects.;    The council then could decide
which, if any, of the options to pursue. Any change would represent the first
major expansion of Santa Cruz's water system since Loch Lomond Dam was built
on Newell Creek in Lompico in 1962.;    In past years, water source issues
have touched off intense controversy in Santa Cruz.;    The slow-growth
politicians who have controlled city government since 1981 have staunchly
resisted calls to build dams, arguing that creating new reservoirs would open
the way for rampant development and lead to destruction of the environment.;  
 The last time the issue surfaced, in 1987, former Mayor John Laird was
successful in killing a plan to build a dam on Zayante Creek.;    Five
successive years of drought have forced city residents to ration -- and
possibly to become more sympathetic to a new dam, he said Monday.;    A new
dam almost certainly would alleviate the need for rationing during future
droughts.;    However, construction costs would raise water bills, wilderness
would be destroyed and pressure for increased development would grow, Laird
said.;    "People just have to decide what trade-offs they're willing to
make," he said.;    Some of the options engineers will study include:;   
(check) Enlarging Loch Lomond. Raising the dam height to 14 feet would allow
storage of millions of gallons of additional water. The project would mean a
costly relocation of the reservoir's ranger headquarters and new recreational
facilities.;    (check) Drilling new wells. Since 1979, however, water
officials have spent $500,000 searching for a major underground aquifer
without much luck.;    (check) Building a desalination plant. Although
alluring for a coastal city, a plant to convert saltwater to drinking water
would cost about $60 million.;    (check) Other dams. Dams could be built on
Baldwin or Laguna creeks on the north coast, or on the upper San Lorenzo River
or Zayante Creek.  </TEXT>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration sought funds Monday
for 10 new flood control and navigation projects, including several
Congress refused to launch last year.
   It requested $88.5 million in its fiscal 1990 budget for the Army
Corps of Engineers projects. Six were in last year's Reagan budget,
but Congress refused to start any. The four new projects are in
Ohio, Texas, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
   The number of new projects has slumped in recent years under the
pressure of tight budgets and a 1986 law requiring local communities
to put up a share of the initial cost.
   The budget calls for a new system of paying for maintenance on
the Bureau of Reclamation projects, largely bypassing the
congressional appropriations process.
   For the third year in a row, the bureau, which operates in the 17
westernmost states of the lower 48, proposed no new construction.
Sixty percent of the bureau's construction spending would be devoted
to three projects _ the Central Arizona Project, the Central Utah
Project and the Central Valley Project in California.
   The budget calls for no substantial construction money for the
controversial Garrison Diversion Unit in North Dakota until 1994,
though $8.75 million would be earmarked to complete certain
facilities and secure those already built.
   Similarly, the Animas-La Plata Project in Colorado and New Mexico
was allocated only $3.7 million to bring to a ``reasonable
conclusion'' pre-construction activity and equipment purchases.
   The bureau would spend a total of $946 million, down 14 percent
from $1.103 billion this year. Its construction budget would be $655
million, down 7.2 percent from $706 million this year.
   The corps' spending would total $3.2 billion, down 1.7 percent
from $3.26 billion. Its construction spending would total $1.22
billion, up 8.9 percent from $1.12 billion.
   While the 10 new projects would require $85.5 million in start-up
funds, there was no estimate of how much the projects would
ultimately cost.
   Congress must appropriate funds for maintaining the bureau's
projects, including the gigantic dams it runs in the West whose
power is sold by the power marketing administrations of the Energy
Department.
   Some revenues from the bureau's dams and irrigation canals are
tagged as owed the Treasury for operation and maintenance, but
Congress must appropriate the money anyway. The bureau wants to use
those earmarked funds on its own.
   ``As a result of the increased managerial flexibility afforded by
the revolving fund, the bureau will be better able to coordinate its
plans for the operation and maintenance of existing dams, power
plants and irrigation facilities,'' the budget document said. The
Bonneville Power Administration and the Western Area Power
Administration ``will be full partners in approving budgets,
projects and priorities.''
   The budget called for spending $222 million on maintenance, up
from $177 million this year. But $107 million will come from the
revolving fund.
   ``There's quite a (maintenance) backlog we have to catch up on,''
Interior undersecretary Earl Geljde told reporters.
   Here are the 10 new Corps of Engineer projects. If two figures
are shown, the second figure represents the amount for construction
the administration requested last year. An ``F'' denotes the project
is for flood control; an ``N'' means a navigation project.
   The dollar figures are in budget authority, which usually
approximates actual outlays during the year. Outlay figures were not
immediately available.
   _Cache Creek Settling Basin, California, $5.5 million, $3.25
million, F.
   _Santa Ana River Mainstem, California, $20 million, $15 million,
F.
   _Ramapo and Mahway rivers, Mahwah, N.J. and Suffern, N.Y.,
$330,000, $300,000, F.
   _Sheyenne River, Riverside to Horace, N.D., $5.5 million, $2.7
million, F.
   _Nonconnah Creek, Tennessee and Mississippi, $1.5 million, $1.5
million, F.
   _Lock Haven, Pa., $7.6 million, $1.0 million, F.
   _Nelsonville, Ohio, levees on the Hocking River, $2.415 million,
F.
   _Point Marion Lock and Dam No. 8, Monongahela River, Pennsylvania
and West Virginia, $17.9 million, N.
   _Sims Bayou, Houston, Texas, $4.0 million, F.
   _Winfield Lock and Dam, West Virginia, $20.8 million, N.
   The Point Marion and Winfield projects listed construction funds
in last year's budget requests but were not shown as proposed new
starts because the corps said the money was for pre-construction
activities.
   The Sheyenne project is expanded from the one proposed last year,
extending to Horace instead of stopping at West Fargo.

  [Text] Wuhan, February 25 (XINHUA) -- Construction of a 
ship lift at the Geheyan key water control project on the 
Qingjiang river, which empties into the Chang Jiang river 
eastward of the Three Gorges, started recently. 
  The building of the ship lift project, which requires a 
total 
investment of more than 200 million yuan, is aimed at 
establishing a reliable basis for the design and construction of 
another ship lift at the gigantic water control dam at the Three 
Gorges on the Chiang Jiang, said engineers responsible for the 
construction of the ship lift on Qingjiang river. 
  According to them, the main technical indexes of the ship 
lift under construction, designed and being constructed by the 
Wuhan Ship Building Company, observe a general proportion of one 
to ten with the ship lift to be built at the Three Gorges water 
control dam. 
  The ship lift now under construction is a major part of the 
Geheyan water control project. The ship lift, consisting of two 
separate vertical ship lifts, is expected to have a maximum 
lifting height of 122 m and a maximum lifting weight of 15,000 
tons when completed and put into use in 1997, said the engineers. 
  Construction of the ship lift at the Geheyan water control 
project of Qingjiang river is of great importance for promoting 
the economy of Hubei and opening up mountainous southwestern 
Hubei in the Qingjiang river watershed.

FT  11 NOV 93 / US agencies to pull out of Yangtze Project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO US government agencies are to end their involvement in China's
controversial Three Gorges project to build the world's largest dam on the
Yangtze river.
The Bureau of Reclamation, which is in charge of irrigation and water
management in the US, and the Army Corps of Engineers, whose
responsibilities include flood control and navigation, will sever their
involvement in Three Gorges after they have completed work on a hydrological
database.
Although the bureau and corps had only a consulting role in Three Gorges,
their withdrawal is a symbolic blow to the credibility of the project, which
opponents charge will displace 1.3m people and flood nearly 100,000 hectares
of China's best farmland.
Competing with each other in the 1930s and 1940s, the two agencies
symbolised an era of monumental civil engineering when the US believed it
could bend nature to its will with ever bigger dams such as Bonneville,
Hoover or Grand Coulee.
The Bureau of Reclamation said its withdrawal from Three Gorges reflected
the change in the agency's mission since the Clinton administration took
office. 'We are not really in the dam-building business any more. We are a
water resource management agency now,' a bureau spokeswoman said.
The bureau falls under the aegis of Mr Bruce Babbitt, interior secretary,
who has launched an ambitious attempt to transform the federal government
into a better steward of the land and resources under its control. However,
the US withdrawal is also a comment on the appropriateness of massive dams
such as Three Gorges. 'We wouldn't support such a project in the US now, so
it would be incongruous for us to support it in another country,' the bureau
said.

<LEADPARA>  U.S. GOVERNMENT dam operations are severely damaging the riverside environment
of the Grand Canyon, according to the Department of Interior's own study.;

heart of this country's most famous national monument.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  GRAND CANYON DAMAGE
HOW DAM IS DESTROYING COLORADO RIVER ENVIRONMENT  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Fryar Calhoun is co-author of "California Whitewater: A Guide to the Rivers."
He wrote this article for Perspective.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Yet while a team of experts devotes years to the laborious process of
writing an environmental impact statement, dam operations continue as usual.; 
 Glen Canyon Dam, towering 710 feet above the riverbed of the Colorado a few
miles upstream from the Grand Canyon, is operated by the Bureau of
Reclamation, an agency of the Department of the Interior. The
federally-subsidized electricity produced at the dam is sold at
bargain-basement prices by the Western Area Power Administration, a branch of
the Department of Energy, to publicly-owned utilities, agricultural irrigation
districts and rural electric cooperatives in 15 Western states.;   Dam
operators schedule peak releases of up to 31,500 cubic feet per second (cfs)
for the afternoon hours when demand for electricity is at its highest. The
water surges through the Grand Canyon, destroying fish and wildlife habitat
and washing away beaches. Then the operators turn the river almost completely
off later in the day and on weekends when peak power demand declines. Within a
few hours, flows fall as low as 1,000 to 3,000 cfs.;   The "normal" pace of
the devastation is accelerated by occasional flood releases, which result from
keeping Lake Powell too full. An unexpectedly large runoff -- due, for
example, to late spring snowstorms in the Rockies -- can threaten to overtop
the dam. To avert this disaster, the dam operators release enormous amounts of
water through the spillways, scouring out even more beaches.;   Before Glen
Canyon Dam was built, the Colorado River ran free and wild from its headwaters
in the Rocky Mountains all the way through the Grand Canyon and into Lake Mead
(the huge reservoir behind Hoover Dam, which was built in the mid-1930s).
Average flows in the Grand Canyon ranged from a winter low of about 5,000 cfs
to around 50,000 cfs during peak snowmelt in late spring and early summer. In
a dry winter, flows dropped to around 1,000; in a wet year, the river peaked
as high as 150,000. Water temperature varied from just above freezing in
winter and spring to an average high of over 80 degrees Fahrenheit in late
summer and early fall.;   During most of the year the sediment-laden river was
a muddy reddish-brown in color -- hence the name "Colorado," which means "red"
in Spanish. Every year, the river washed away the sandy beaches with high
flows in the spring and early summer. Then, as flows dropped in the summer, it
re-created them by depositing fresh sediment carried from far upstream.;  
After the dam; This natural cycle was interrupted in 1963, when water began to
be held in Lake Powell, the enormous reservoir behind newly-completed Glen
Canyon Dam. The seasonal cycle of low and high flows disappeared, to be
replaced by a computer-driven schedule of dam releases determined by the
demands of power consumers.;   No longer was the Colorado allowed to fulfill
its yearly task of destroying and replenishing the beaches in the Grand
Canyon. The river was swallowed up in the still waters of Lake Powell, and the
sediment it carried began to be deposited in the upper reaches of the
reservoir. From then on, beaches washed away by high water below the dam would
simply disappear.;   Seasonal differentials in water temperature also changed
radically. The intake structures for the dam's electrical turbines are located
far below the surface of the reservoir, so the water released to the Colorado
River in the Grand Canyon now remains cold all year long. Water temperatures
range from about 41.90 degrees in winter to 53.60 degrees in summer.;   Native
fish have had enormous difficulty adapting to the year-round cold water, the
fluctuating flows, and the loss of habitat, especially backwaters. Two
species, the bony-tailed chub and the Colorado River squawfish, are now
extinct in the Grand Canyon, though they cling to life elsewhere in the
Colorado River. Another fish unique to the Colorado and Little Colorado
Rivers, the humpback chub, is on the endangered species list.;   The
fluctuating flows also cause plenty of problems for tens of thousands of
recreational boaters and fishermen.;   The studies; After ignoring the problem
for years, in 1982 the Department of the Interior authorized its own study.
The results, announced in 1988, confirmed what environmentalists and
scientists had long been claiming: The river environment of the Grand Canyon
suffers daily, ongoing damage due to dam operations.;   At first, Secretary of
the Interior Manuel Lujan attempted to stall by proposing more research.
Finally, in response to pressure generated by a nationwide letter-writing
campaign, in July 1989 he directed that an environmental impact statement
(EIS) be prepared.;   The EIS process is now under way but years from
completion. Any final resolution of the question will take still longer.
Meanwhile, except for brief periods set aside to test the effects of different
flow schedules, fluctuating peak-power releases go on as usual, and the damage
continues.;   The options; Although the final decision will likely fall to
Congress, the team charged with preparing the EIS is considering a variety of
proposals on how to operate Glen Canyon Dam in the future.;   Sad to say, the
Bureau of Reclamation and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) still
want to run the dam as a peak-power operation, continuing the present schedule
of daily release fluctuations with only slight modification. Power demand
would still be king.;   These federal agencies propose to mitigate the effects
of the releases by building a small "reregulation" dam just upstream from
Lee's Ferry to "smooth out" the changes in the river level downstream. They
admit that some erosion of the beaches would continue, so they would bring
machinery into the Grand Canyon to pump sediment from the river channel onto
the most heavily eroded beaches, then shore up the beaches with rocks taken
from the mouths of nearby tributaries. (So far, they haven't proposed pouring
concrete.);   Various scientists and private environmental groups are
sponsoring a range of alternatives that would do far more to protect the Grand
Canyon. Their approaches vary in detail, but they agree on the key element:
eliminating the huge daily fluctuations and occasional devastating flood
releases that wash the beaches away.;   Base load vs. peak power; Any of these
environmentally sound alternatives would be a vast improvement over the
present regime. All would change the emphasis of Glen Canyon Dam operations
from peak power to base load production. In other words, the dam would deliver
steady, predictable amounts of electricity around the clock instead of
increasing its output to meet daily peak power demand.;   No energy would be
lost by the implementation of any of these alternatives. All the water going
through the dam would still produce electricity. The total amount of
electricity generated would remain the same, but it would be produced at
different times of the day.;   True, this change would mean that the utilities
that now buy Glen Canyon peak power would have to look elsewhere for it. That
might mean paying higher market prices. But the impact on consumers'
electrical bills would hardly be significant.;   Cheap, subsidized
electricity; Glen Canyon Dam, like other major WAPA-Bureau of Reclamation
dams, is being operated as if its purpose were solely to provide the cheapest
possible power. (Currently, WAPA sells its federally-subsidized electricity at
a wholesale rate of about 1.45 cents per kilowatt-hour, leas than a third of
the market price.) In practice, concern for the dam's impact on the river
environment and encouragement of energy conservation -- parts of WAPA's stated
mission -- are conspicuously absent.;   WAPA and the publicly-owned utilities
that buy its power are prohibited from making a profit on their sales of
electricity. Yet nothing in the wording of WAPA's mission says that its
consumers are guaranteed prices far below what most Americans pay. And
artificially cheap prices provide no incentive to conserve.;   Does anyone --
even the government -- have the right to destroy the Grand Canyon's river
environment just to save favored consumers a few pennies on their electrical
rates?;   The solution;   The solution can be stated very simply: Manage Glen
Canyon Dam properly to protect the Grand Canyon. That means eliminating the
radical peak power releases that cause the wide daily fluctuations in flows,
and making sure that Lake Powell isn't so full that the dam operators have to
release flood flows again.;   The immediate goal is to persuade Congress to
force the Department of the Interior to modify or eliminate peak-power
releases during the time it takes to complete the EIS. The ultimate goal, of
course, is for the government to operate Glen Canyon Dam with due regard for
the downstream river environment.;   The Grand Canyon is too valuable a piece
of our national heritage to be sacrificed to a power plant.  </TEXT>

   British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority is offering electricity to the U.S. under long-term contracts beginning in 1995 from a proposed $1.24 billion (U.S.) hydro project. 

   Construction of the 900,000-kilowatt Site C dam, on the Peace River in northern British Columbia, could begin in 1989 if delivery contracts are signed this year with purchasers in California and the Pacific Northwest, said Chester Johnson, chairman of the government-owned utility. 

   The executive declined to disclose the price for the power, but said revenue from the export sales would have to cover the project's construction cost. 
He said the electricity would be competitive in an energy market in which crude oil is priced at $25 a barrel; crude currently sells for about $18 a barrel. 

   The project will help the provincial economy by providing 2,000 construction jobs, Mr. Johnson said at a news conference here. 
After the export contracts expire, the province would gain the dam for its own needs without any financial outlay, he added. 

   He said that the U.S. electricity purchasers would have to sign firm take-or-pay commitments so that the province wouldn't bear the risks if energy markets proved weak during the contract period. 
Take-or-pay commitments require purchasers to pay for delivery of contracted amounts of energy whether or not the supplies are needed. 

   An export market for the dam's power was confirmed in a six-month study by utilities in British Columbia, Washington, Oregon and California, he said. 
The study's 11 sponsors, including the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and San Francisco's Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., said the market would last for at least 20 years after 1994. 

   Direct costs of the dam and generating station are estimated at $1.05 billion with new transmission lines in British Columbia costing a further $187.5 million. 
The cost of expanded transmission lines in the U.S. was estimated at $15 million. 

   Strongly opposing the Site C project, which would be subject to regulatory clearances, are British Columbia environmentalists, who fear the impact on the Peace River watershed. 
Some electricity users in the province also fear they may have to pay more for power if the project doesn't recover its costs. 

   British Columbia currently has a power surplus equal to half the 1,843,000 kilowatt capacity of its newest dam, completed in 1983 for $2 billion. 
But the province expects the surplus to disappear by the mid-1990s because of increased domestic demand.

  [Text] Yichang, January 25 (XINHUA) -- With the full 
support of the central government, Yichang City in Hubei 
Province, has stepped up the pace of construction of a 
communication network that serves the largest water conservancy 
and power project -- the Three Gorges. 
  Preparations for an international airport have started. 
According to a preliminary plan, the airport will be built in 
two phases. The first phase will involve the construction of a 
2,600- meter runway and the second phase will involved a 
3,200-meter runway. The first phase, estimated to cost 350 
million yuan, is scheduled for completion in 1995. 
  Work on a deep-water harbor capable of accommodating ships 
of 
3,000 tons is to start soon near the dam site. The project is 
expected to cost 120 million yuan. 
  With a designed handling capacity of 10 to 50 million tons 
annually, the port will be used to transport materials needed in 
the construction of the Three Gorges Project, of which 
preliminary projects have started. 
  Meanwhile, a highway bridge across the Chang Jiang River at 
Yichang will be built soon. 
  The Three Gorges Project, which was launched two years ago 
by 
the Chinese Government, is one of the world's largest water 
conservancy and power projects. A dam 185 meters high and 
nearly 2 km long will be thrown across the Chang Jiang River 
before the year 2010.

Three Southern California counties and the U.S. Army formalized an agreement 
Thursday that clears the way for the construction of flood-control barriers 
along the Santa Ana River, with Orange County being the major beneficiary of 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties and the Army Corps of Engineers 
will share the cost of the $1.1-billion project to improve flood control along 
the river that authorities say has the worst potential flood problems west of 
the Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
In October, $20 million in federal funds were authorized to initiate the 
project. The agreement says that each year the federal government will 
appropriate additional funds until the project is completed. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of Orange County need to realize how important this project is and 
how devastated the county will be, with the loss of life and structural damage, 
if a flood does occur," said Costa Mesa Mayor Peter Buffa, who is chairman of 
the Santa Ana River Flood Protection Agency. "It's just hard to picture it 
right now because the river is dry." 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana River project includes the construction of a new dam, to be 
called "Seven Oaks," four miles upstream from Mentone in San Bernardino County; 
raising Prado Dam in Riverside County by 30 feet to expand its capacity from 
195,000 to 363,000 acre-feet; widening and deepening channels along the lower 
river through Orange County and those along Santiago Creek, and the 
construction of a drain in Corona. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the project will enhance and preserve marshland and wetlands for 
endangered waterfowl, fish and wildlife species at the mouth of the river, 
according to William Zaun, Orange County's director of public works. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County, which will be the major beneficiary of the massive project, will 
pay the major share of the local costs, estimated at more than $400 million.

   The Environmental Protection Agency has
decided to veto construction of the Two Forks Dam in Colorado, the
largest non-federal water project in the West, it was reported
today.
   The Washington Post said EPA Administrator William K. Reilly is
expected within a few days to announce a decision to block the
billion-dollar dam, which the city of Denver had sought to increase
water supplies for its suburbs.
   But EPA officials said today that while action will be taken
soon on a review board's recommendation that no dam be built at the
site, no decision has yet been made.
   The officials, who commented on condition they not be identified
by name, said Riley will not make the decision himself but has
delegated it to LaJuana S. Wilcher, the EPA's assistant
administrator for water.
   One official confirmed that Ms. Wilcher is ``working on a
document'' but added: ``Until it is final it is inappropriate to
tell you what's in it.''
   The dam has been the focus of an intense battle between
environmentalists and supporters of increased development.
   The proposed project called for flooding much of Cheesman
Canyon, a wilderness area between two forks of the South Platte
River.
   The Post said it obtained a draft of the decision, which said
the dam would lead to ``unacceptable adverse effects,'' including
loss and damage to fisheries and recreational opportunities.
   Denver has ``practicable, less environmentally damaging
alternatives'' to provide water for the new suburbs in the front
range of the Rocky Mountains, Reilly is quoted as saying.
   Monte Pascoe, a Denver Water Board commissioner, told The Post
the decision is ``unbelievably shortsighted. You're saying squeeze
more out of the existing system and get right up to a drought
before you recognize the problem.''
   The Army Corps of Engineers in March 1989 approved a permit to
build the dam, and former Reagan administration officials had
indicated support for the project.

<F P=106> ["Page 5 Report" by Sathit Manatsurakun: "Water Diversion </F>
From Salween River To Replenish Phumiphon Dam -- Many Questions 
Need To Be Answered"] 
  [Summary] "It appears that many obstacles face the program 
to build seven dams in the Salween River basin in the 
Thai-Burmese border area to draw water from branches of the 
Salween River to branches of the Chao Phraya River to replenish 
the Phumiphon dam in order to feed 22 central region provinces, 
including Bangkok. 
  "In addition to opposition from the local people, which 
already has started in some areas, the government program will 
have to face scrutiny by private development organizations, 
student environmental groups, and academics who have demanded 
fair distribution of resources. The obstacles will be just as 
intense as those found against the efforts to build other dams. 
  "The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand [EGAT] has 
been assigned by the government to make a feasibility and 
environmental impact study of the program, which involves the 
construction of at least seven dams. 
  "They are: the Mae Lamao-Mae Tun Project in Mae Sot 
District, Tak Province; the Huai Khanaeng-Mae Tun Project in Mae 
Ramat District, Tak; the Upper Nam Pai-Mae Taeng Project in Pai 
District, Mae Hong Son; the Nam Ngao-Mae Tun Project in the area 
where Sop Moei Subdistrict, Mae Hong Son and Tha Song Yang 
District, Tak Province merges; the Lower Nam Pai-Mae Chaem 
Project in Muang District, Mae Hong Son; the Nam Moei-Mae Tun 
Project in Mae Ramat District, Tak; the Upper Salween-Mae Taeng 
Project in Burma north of Chiang Dao District, Chiang Mai. 
  "It is estimated that the seven projects will be able to 
divert 6 billion cubic meters of water to Phumiphon Dam. 
  "Because the program will involve drawing water from 
international waterways for domestic use, the program originator 
has to employ 'offensive public relations' as well as tactics to 
push ahead its program on the basis of international 
geopolitical factors. 
  "According to a source in EGAT's Phumiphon Dam Replenishment 
Project working team, Minister Attached to the Prime Minister's 
Office Sawit Phothiwihok, who is in charge of EGAT, has a policy 
to push ahead the program in three ways: 
  "First, the study for the projects which are located in 
Thailand, such as the Huai Khanaeng-Mae Tun Project, can start 
promptly. The project is located about 600 meters from the bank 
of the Moei River on the Thai-Burmese border. A Thai-UK treaty, 
signed while Burma was a British colony, stipulates that the 
banks of the Salween and Moei Rivers serves as the border, with 
the two rivers being neutral territory. Therefore, it should be 
no problem to pump water from the Moei River that flows into 
Huai Khanaeng Khito in the high tide season. 
  "Second, on the project which is located in the area 
straddling the Thai-Burmese border -- the Nam Moei-Mae Tun -- an 
agreement must be reached with Burma to enable Thailand to seek 
loans confidently from international financial institutions and 
to ensure that there will be no problem with the ethnic minority 
groups waging a liberation war nearby. 
  "Third, Thailand should not ask Burma to permit it to study 
the projects located in Burmese territory, such as the Upper 
Salween Project, unless Burma wants such projects implemented in 
order to sell water and electricity to Thailand. Only under 
these conditions should Thailand negotiate with Burma on a 
government-to-government level. 
  "The source said: `This policy was reached after considering 
the question: what would we do if Burma asks to conduct a study 
on the Chao Phraya River basin?' 
  "In any event, it appears that the EGAT will choose to 
implement more simple projects based on engineering and economic 
considerations first." 
  The EGAT organized a seminar recently to gauge reaction to 
two projects -- the Mae Lamao and Huai Khanaeng projects -- on 
which it already conducted preliminary studies. The people who 
will be displaced by the projects clearly opposed the 
construction, while academics and private development 
organizations made many observations. 
  "The seven private development organizations which 
participated in the seminar made the following proposals: 1. a 
public hearing should be conducted regarding water needs and 
resource management in the Chao Phraya River basin; 2. the study 
on environmental impact should be expanded to cover the Salween 
River basin as well; 3. an independent committee comprising 
specialists, local leaders, and representatives of private 
development organizations should be formed to monitor the 
environmental impact. The committee should participate in every 
stage of the projects until after completion of project 
construction." 
  [Begin box] 
<H5>  Mae Lamao-Mae Tun Project </H5>
  The dam is 60 meters high. It will dam Mae Lamao stream 
about 15 km from where it merges with the Moei River in Mae 
Lamao National Forest Reserve in Mae Sot District, Tak Province. 
It will be located about 120 km west of the Tak provincial 
town. The reservoir will inundate 4,190 rai of land and contain 
94.3 million cubic meters of water. The project cost will be 
5,342 million baht. It will irrigate 18,000 rai of farmland and 
divert 356 million cubic meters of water through a tunnel to 
Phumiphon Dam 
<H5>  Huai Khanaeng Project </H5>
  The dam will dam Huai Khanaeng Khitoe stream about 600-1,600 
meters from where it merges with Moei River. The exact size and 
site of the project is still under study. It will be located in 
Mae Ramat District, Tak Province. The reservoir will encompass 
about 1,400 rai and will divert 600-800 cubic meters of water to 
Phumiphon Dam. The project is estimated to cost about 5,068 
million baht. [end box]

FT  07 APR 92 / A million must move for China's next great wall: Yvonne
Preston surveys some of the human and environmental costs of the Three
Gorges Dam project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By YVONNE PRESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE middle reaches of the majestic Yangtze river, sheer cliff faces and
mountains rise from turbulent waters to form the Three Gorges, an
inspiration to Chinese poets and artists down the centuries.
One of the world's scenic wonders, it is the site of the planned Three
Gorges dam, an engineering project - given the go-ahead by the Chinese
parliament last Friday - which will not only change the landscape forever,
but cost more than 1m people their homes, and swamp 23,800 hectares of
arable land, 657 factories and mines, 139 power stations and 956km of roads.
The scheme, incorporating the biggest hydro-power station and largest
ship-lift in the world and an unprecedented five ship locks, is costed at
57bn yuan (Pounds 6bn) at 1990 prices. Such is the controversy surrounding
it that a third of the deputies in the normally tame National People's
Congress failed to give it their rubber-stamp vote.
The Three Gorges - Qutang, Wuxia and Xiling - will be dominated by the
reservoir which will stretch out behind the 185-metre high dam when it
reaches the proposed 175-metre water level 15 years from the start of
construction. The 600km reservoir will be a tranquil body of water, twice
the width of the present turbulent river, improved navigation being one of
the project's proclaimed benefits.
Others are flood control in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze  -
and power, for which China has an insatiable appetite. The project will
generate 84bn kw/h of hydro-electric power a year, one-eighth of China's
1991 output.
The water level in Qutang, the smallest and most westerly of the Three
Gorges, only 100 metres wide at its narrowest point, is set to rise 90
metres. In the hillside town of Wanxian at the western approach to the
Gorges, population 30,000, the level the water will reach is marked on
buildings. Few will be above.
The town will be re-built back from the river with some of the 18.5bn yuan
allocated to resettlement from the project's budget of 57bn yuan. Some
private scepticism was expressed in Wanxian county, which has a high
proportion of all the people to be moved, that the money promised by the
central government would be forthcoming.
The reservoir will flood 19 counties and municipalities in the two provinces
of Sichuan and Hubei, swamping hundreds of populated areas, including the
cities of Wanxian and Fuling with 100,000 people. Altogether 140 towns and
hundreds of villages are to go, though officials claim none will be totally
submerged.
The dam will cost 1.13m people their homes by the time the project nears
completion in the year 2008. Tang Dengqing from the Yangtze River Water
Resources Commission in Wuhan, responsible for helping to plan new cities
and towns and develop barren land for displaced farmers, says moving so many
people is unparalleled in the world. It is the most serious of all problems
associated with the dam, he says.
Sites have been chosen for the new cities and an overall broad plan mapped.
Experiments in moving have been conducted, though reports say people show
reluctance to go. The new county town of Badong, 2km from the original site,
has basically taken shape after five years construction.
Those to be resettled from urban areas - 60 per cent of the total - are less
of a problem than peasant farmers, says Tang. Scratching a poor living from
terraced plots often high on mountain sides, they must now be moved higher
to still less hospitable land.
There are also conflicts of interest between provinces. Hubei province,
down-river of the dam gains from flood control, cheap power and new jobs,
but has only 15 per cent of the people to be displaced.
Upriver of the dam the much poorer and heavily populated Sichuan province
gets 10 per cent of the power but is home to the remaining 85 per cent of
the people to be displaced.
Sichuan faces an increased risk of flooding, as the water level up-river
rises. There is an additional risk that the accumulation of silt will affect
navigation to Chongqing, Sichuan's largest port. Deputy director of the
Three Gorges project office in the city, economist Sun Lai Yan, says 50,000
people within the municipal area will have to move. Many have urged the
government to do more research on the project before going ahead.
The governor of Sichuan province, Zhang Haoruo, cast his vote for the dam at
the weekend, but even he acknowledges the majority of Sichuanese are
opposed.
There have been rumours, officially denied, that elder statesman Deng
Xiaoping, born in Sichuan, had expressed reservations.
Through the 40 years of debate since the project was first proposed,
uncertainty has inhibited development along the affected area, which remains
poor and lacking in investment funds. The point is re-iterated by official
spokesmen backing the scheme. Critics remain concerned about the risk of
reservoir-induced earthquakes, the threat of river banks collapsing, and the
accumulation of silt in the first 50 years of operation, affecting
generating capacity and shortening the dam's useful life.
Money is another question. China can afford it, the minister for water
conservancy and power, Yang Zhenhuai, said in Beijing after the vote. Funds
would come from the state, from the generation of power which would begin
nine years after the start of construction, from the sale of bonds and from
preferential foreign loans.
Harnessing the Yangtze has been an aspiration of the Chinese Communist Party
since Mao Zedong visited the dam site in the 1950s. The appeal of an heroic
project to today's leaders is a powerful impetus behind the largest
construction project since the founding of the People's Republic.

Supporters and opponents agreed Friday that the veto of the Two Forks Dam 
project in Colorado could spell the end of huge projects aimed at diverting 
water in the water-scarce West. 
</P>
<P>
But both sides also agreed that the decision by the Environmental Protection 
Agency to kill the Denver-area project would not spell the end of the fight 
over a project that pits developers against conservationists. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA confirmed Friday that it would not approve construction of the Two 
Forks Dam project, the largest non-federal water project in the West. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's assistant administrator for water, LaJuana S. Wilcher, said she 
would uphold the recommendation of the EPA's Denver office to bar construction 
of the 615-foot dam just downstream of the confluence of the South Platte River 
and its North Fork. 
</P>
<P>
"The applicants made a good-faith effort to downscale the project size and 
compensate for the loss of wetlands and aquatic resources," Wilcher said. 
</P>
<P>
"However, the smaller project would still flood 24 miles of freely flowing, 
scenic stream and almost 11 miles of gold medal trout fishery. . . . It would 
inundate an area of unquestionable natural beauty that provides a diversity of 
fishing and recreational opportunities and a rich aquatic habitat close to the 
Denver metropolitan area." 
</P>
<P>
The city of Denver wants the project to increase water supplies for its 
suburbs. The project calls for building the dam to creating a reservoir on the 
South Platte River, southwest of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"This decision affects not just Denver, but it may be the end of all big water 
projects," said William H. Van Schooneveld, chairman of the group behind the 
project. "If EPA can veto this, there really isn't any project that anybody can 
develop that can pass the EPA." 
</P>
<P>
Hope Babcock, general counsel for the National Audubon Society, agreed on the 
veto's significance. 
</P>
<P>
"It says once again that the era of building these enormous projects is over," 
she said, adding that the agency has previously used its veto powers under the 
Clean Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of those vetoes are final, however, and a federal court in Virginia 
recently reversed a veto. "There are a lot of grounds for appeal," Van 
Schooneveld said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Denver Water Board has fought like crazy for this project over the years," 
Babcock said. "I would be amazed -- they have a lot of high-priced lawyers -- 
if they didn't go to court on this." 
</P>
<P>
Big dams have made possible the growth of big cities and farms in the West. 
Critics say that too much water has been diverted, threatening the balance of 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
The Army Corps of Engineers in March, 1989, approved a permit to build the dam, 
and former Ronald Reagan Administration officials had indicated support for the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Babcock said the veto decision "is extremely significant, in particular, 
because of what it says about Reilly and his EPA." Reilly was appointed by 
President Bush.

<DATELINE>HARSUD, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 40,000 people linked arms and sang
``We Shall Overcome'' in this remote village Thursday to protest a
planned dam project that would wipe out farm land and forests and
leave about 1 million people homeless.
   Protest organizers said the participants, who traveled by bus,
trucks tractors and even on horseback, live along Narmada River,
one of India's longest and holiest waterways.
   The protesters joined hands and formed a 4-mile-long chain to
symbolize their determination to save Harsud and 572 other villages
that will go under water if the dams are constructed.
   Environmentalists, social workers, film stars and politicians
called for the project to be permanently shelved.
   ``We shall not move, the dam is our doom!'' the protesters
chanted.
   The rally was organized by the Save Marmada Committee, which has
spearheaded a year-old campaign against the Narmada Valley Project.
   The plan calls for construction of four major dams and about
3,000 smaller dams on the 805-mile-long Narmada River and its 41
tributaries.
   Environmentalists say the project would destroy an estimated
865,500 acres of forests, 495,000 acres of farming land and force
an estimated 1 million people to leave their homes.
   They also contend that some of the country's richest
archeological sites and oldest fossils would be under water.
   ``We chose Harsud to symbolize the protest because it is the
largest village that will be submerged by the projhect,'' said
Vinod Raina, spokesman for the Save Narmada Committee.
   Harsud, a town of 15,000 people in central India, is 15 miles
from the river, which originates at Amarkantak in Madhya Pradesh
state and flows through the states of Maharastra and Gujarat. It
empties into the Arabian sea.
   The government said it plans to proceed with the project, which
is expected to generate electricity, irrigate fields and solve
drinking water problems in Gujarat, which is often plagued by
drought.
   The government said it would provide land elsewhere for
displaced villagers, but most don't want to leave their homes.
   ``I don't want to drown in Narmada water and I don't want to
leave the village where I was born and grew up,'' said Bhure Singh,
a 55-year-old farmer. Singh's village, Mallan Goan, would be
submerged if the plan drafted in 1948 is carried out.
   During the speeches, youngsters went through the crowd seeking
autographs from film stars and other celebrities in the crowd.
   ``If my village is drowned, this autograph book will remind me
of this day,'' said 15-year-old Mavin Jain.

   Hungary has asked U.S. experts for help
in a controversial, multi-billion dollar hydroelectric dam project
on the Danube river, the official news agency MTI reported Friday.
   The news agency said the government is consulting San
Francisco-based Bechtel Group Inc. about the dam's operation and
the likely environmental consequences of its construction.
   The Gabcikovo-Nagymaros dam on the Hungarian-Czechoslovak border
has pitted the communist government against environmentalists who
say the project and its 140-mile rerouting of the Danube will flood
fertile farmland and destroy natural forests and wildlife.
   Hungarian and Austrian environmentalists oppose the project.
Czechoslovak scientists also questioned the environmental
consequences of the project.
   Construction began in early 1980s and a completion date has been
pushed back several times. Government officials hope to complete
the project by 1990.
   Seventy percent of the construction work in Hungary will be
carried out by Austrian companies in exchange for 15 years of
electricity for Austria from the finished project.
   The new openness evident in Hungary's state-run media and
politics in the past six weeks prompted unprecedented public
coverage of environmentalists' complaints about the planned dam and
raised questions about halting construction.
   Similar vast projects in the Soviet Union were halted in the
past two years as Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
increased openness brought more attention to environmental
questions and catastrophes.
   In June, parliamentarian Zoltan Kiraly proposed that work on the
project be suspended while a team of foreign experts evaluated its
economic efficiency.
   His proposal for suspension was rejected, but word that the
government plans to consult Bechtel Corp. indicated it is now
willing to bring in foreign experts.
   The government is to report to the Parliament on the project in
the fall.
   Officials maintain that stopping construction would cost about
$1.1 billion in payments to Austria, Czechoslovakia and Hungarian
companies for breach of contract.
   Officials estimate the cost of completing the dam at $1.08
billion. Environmentalists contend inflation will push costs to
$2.6 billion.
   MTI quoted Ervin Zsuffa, deputy minister of environment and
water management, as saying the Bechtel study should examine
environmental aspects of the project so that water and energy
management could be adjusted accordingly.

   The head of the Environmental Protection Agency
ordered a review today of a controversial proposed dam and reservoir
in Colorado, a move said by agency officials to be a first step in
killing the project.
   EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said he was concerned about
the Two Forks Dam project southeast of Denver because, as it was
approved earlier this month by the Corps of Engineers, it ``could
result in very serious adverse environmental impact.''
   The action amounted to a veto of a permit issued by the corps,
said Jim Scherer, the EPA's regional administrator in Denver, who
had leaned in favor of allowing the dam to be built.
   One senior agency source called Reilly's announcement ``the first
step'' in a process that is expected to scuttle the controversial
dam. ``This is the door through which you have to travel to get to a
veto'' of the entire project, said the official, speaking on the
condition that he not be identified further.
   The Two Forks dam project on the South Platte River southwest of
Denver has been the center of a bitter fight between
environmentalists and Denver area officials who say it is needed to
meet the region's future water needs.
   EPA Administrator William K. Reilly ordered the agency's regional
office in Denver ``to begin a review of potentially unacceptable
adverse enviromental effects'' the $500 million dam project might
pose.
   ``I am not convinced that the (Two Forks) dam project as proposed
will avoid environmental harm to the extent practicable or that the
proposed permit conditions will minimize or compensate for damage to
fisheries, wildlife habitat and recreation areas,'' Reilly said in a
statement.
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., who has fought the Two Forks project
because of concern that it will harm wetlands in western Nebraska,
said in a telephone interview that Reilly's decision is expected to
kill the proposal.
   ``Those of us who have been fighting this proeject have won,''
said Exon. ``The EPA director has done everything that we asked him
to do. There's nothing more that he could have done. ... I think
this is the practical end to this project.''
   Reilly said the proposal as outlined by the Corps of Engineers
permit issued earlier this month ``does not resolve the critical
environmental issues'' that have surrounded the controversial
project.
   Environmentalists have said that EPA's decision on the dam will
be a barometer of how the Bush administration intends to deal with
environmental and conservation issues.
   City officials in Denver argue that the dam is needed to meet the
water needs of the metropolitan area in the late 1990s and beyond,
but environmentalists have said the 615-foot-high dam and reservoir
would be devastating to wildlife habitat up and down the river.
   Environmentalists have been urging Reilly to intervene in the
decision on the dam because the agency's regional administrator, Jim
Scherer, has indicated he favors the project if certain assurances
are included to protect the environment.
   Opponents of the dam said the provisions included in the
tentative construction permit approved by the Corps of Engineers
earlier this month do not satisfy the environmental concerns.
   ``You can hardly think of anything worse (environmentally) than
this project,'' said Daniel Luecke, an attorney for the
Environmental Defense Fund in Denver. ``It's an enormous project.
It's the most destructive way of supplying water to the city of
Denver.''
   Environmental concerns centered on the fact that the dam and
reservoir would flood a vast area where the South Platte and its
North Fork meet about 25 miles southwest of Denver. It would flood
about 20 miles of the scenic Cheesman Canyon, which has some of the
best trout fishing in the state and is home for a variety of
wildlife.
   The project also has been attacked by Nebraska officials who fear
that the dam will reduce the flow of water into the Big Bend region
of western Nebraska and the wetlands that have been a favorite
resting spot for whooping crane and numerous other birds.
   The project was proposed by the Denver Water Board and a
consortium of 41 Denver area water providers and municipalities.
   Proponents have said the dam is crucial to the region's growth.
They argue that the population of the Denver area will grow from 1.5
million people to 2.5 million people by the year 2035 and that such
growth will outstrip the area's water supply if the dam is not built.

   If you thought the northern spotted owl caused conflict in
the Pacific Northwest, watch the fate of the Snake River
sockeye. This salmon, one of five salmon species in the
Columbia River system, wasn't seen last fall in the upper
reaches of the Snake River, where it normally goes to spawn.
The National Marine Fisheries Service has recommended that it
be listed as an endangered species; if the interior secretary
does so, a battle over allocation of water in the Columbia
basin will begin.
   Sockeye salmon are in trouble because of the eight major
dams on the Columbia River system. Fish ladders help adult
salmon returning from the sea get around the dams, but young
salmon trying to migrate to the sea in the spring are sucked
into the turbines. Many salmon are killed by predators,
disease and warm water when they are trapped in slack water
behind the dams. All told, nearly 90% of the young salmon are
lost, mainly because water flows are insufficient to push the
juveniles to the Pacific.

   If the sockeye is listed as an endangered species, dam
operators will be required to let more water flow downstream.
That means the water would not be stored in the spring to
meet peak summer demand. As a result, electricity prices
could rise as much as 33%, and ranchers and farmers could
lose several million acre-feet of water that now irrigate
orchards, vineyards, forage and crops.
   There is not enough water for both salmon and man because,
throughout the Columbia system, vast federal subsidies have
led to overbuilding of dams and overuse of water. Irrigators
pay only a tiny fraction of the construction costs of these
dams; and on even that payment they have a grace period of 10
years during which they are exempt from repaying federal
loans. And when they finally do repay, it is without
interest. Such concessions add up to a more than 90% subsidy
of agricultural water users. Electricity consumers are not so
lavishly supported by the taxpayer, but Columbia system rates
are still as much as 40% less than elsewhere in the country.
With payments so low, the incentive has been irresistible to
expand irrigation and energy production far beyond the level
people would demand if they were paying the true cost.
   In the past, environmentalists and sports and commercial
fishermen -- people who had an interest in preserving salmon
-- were largely outside the political process that made
decisions about water supply and allocation. Now that they
have won political power through the Endangered Species Act
and popular opinion, they are preparing to use that power in
the same way that farm interests once did -- to seize control
of the Columbia's water for their own interest.
   But rather than more political allocation of water, the
sockeye salmon needs a healthy dose of free market
environmentalism. By establishing clear, transferable rights
to water, which do not exist now, a market can evolve. Rather
than lose their water, some irrigators might give it up
willingly for an attractive price, tailoring their uses more
carefully and perhaps wasting less. Some electric utilities
might buy peak power elsewhere. The adjustments would be made
voluntarily and judiciously, without the rancor caused by
forced transfers.
   Consider the Gunnison River in Colorado. Because rights to
its water were clearly owned, the Nature Conservancy has
succeeded in protecting an endangered fish, the humpback
chub. Pittsburgh and Midway Coal Co. had held rights to
Gunnison water, which it had planned to divert for oil-shale
development. The Nature Conservancy persuaded the coal
company to transfer to it 20,000 acre-feet of water, which it
then left in the stream. Similarly, the Nature Conservancy
has purchased water from irrigators to increase the amount of
water that flows through the parched marshland of the
Stillwater National Refuge in Nevada.
   Unfortunately, rights to Columbia River water cannot be
traded among interested parties. If it were legal for
organizations interested in the preservation of salmon to
purchase water rights, they could bid for low-valued water
and leave it in the stream. But today in the Pacific
Northwest, environmentalists have only one option -- to use
their political power to wrest water from other uses.
   That power, however, might not prevail for long. In 1992
the Endangered Species Act will be up for renewal by
Congress. Given the tremendous conflict the act has
generated, it will be under severe challenge. Rep. William
Dannemeyer (R., Calif.) is considering introducing
legislation that would enable water marketing on federal
projects. Such progressive legislation offers a much better
way of preserving stream and wetland habitat.
Environmentalists have embraced water marketing elsewhere
because it reduces waste. It is time for them to put their
money where the endangered species are.

  [Text] Yichang, Hubei Province, April 24 (XINHUA) -- China 
started construction on the Three Gorges Dam as ground was 
broken on a temporary set of ship locks here this morning in 
Yichang, central China's Hubei Province. 
  So far, earth work on three big projects for the Three 
Gorges 
Dam has begun on one side of the dam, including permanent ship 
locks, a power station and the temporary ship lock and lift 
system. 
  Earth and rock work for these three projects adds up to 
39.24 
million cubic meters, accounting for one-third of the dam's 
total. 
  The first phase of the permanent ship locks work, which 
started on April 17, is 3,800 meters long and nearly 100 meters 
in depth. The two-way five-staged locking and lifting system 
will have an annual handling capacity of 50 million tons and is 
to be the biggest of its sort in the world. 
  The one-way one-staged temporary ship locks with a handling 
capacity of 3,000 tons aims to ensure normal water traffic 
during the dam's construction.

   The Canadian government approved the construction of two dams on the Souris River that will provide flood protection for a large area of North Dakota. 

   The project had been delayed for six months by the objections of environmentalists who claimed it would have detrimental effects on water fowl and fisheries. 

   The project is estimated to cost $120 million Canadian dollars (US$101.9 million). 
The U.S. government said it will contribute US$45 million. 

   The construction of the dams "will alleviate a destructive cycle of drought and flood," Lucien Bouchard, Canadian Environment Minister said. 

   The Rafferty and Alameda dams will regulate the flow of water on the flood-prone Souris River, which flows from southeastern Saskatchewan across the Canada-U.S. border into North Dakota and loops north into Manitoba. 
It will save the U.S. more than US$7 million a year in flood damage. 

   But lowering the river's water level will have some "detrimental" impact on two wildlife refuges and some fisheries in North Dakota, said a Canadian Environment Department official. 

   The reduction in the river's water level could reduce waterfowl breeding 65% to 95% in low-flow years, said Weston Wilson, an engineer with the Environmental Protection Agency. 
He said revenue from a sport fishery could be lost six years out of 10. 
The fishery now generates revenue of about $4 million a year. 

   There are always "some trade-offs" said John Bailen, Souris River project manager for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
He said the U.S. government will spend $9 million to reduce the impact. 

   In Canada, the project will create two reservoirs to store water for irrigation and provide cooling for an electric power generation plant. 

   Construction of the partially completed dams was halted in April by a Canadian court that ordered further environmental review of the project.

<HL> Europe: Danube Dams Threaten Hungarian Reforms </HL>

   Now that Mikhail Gorbachev has seized the full reins of power in the Soviet Union he'll presumably press on with making the Soviet economy more like that of Hungary. 
So it would be timely to take a look at the furor going on behind the Iron Curtain over the Czechoslovak-Hungarian hydroelectric project being built on the Danube -- which has entangled Austria in an embarrassing mess. 

   The great Danube dams have emerged as a white elephant, characteristic of Stalinist central planning -- monstrously expensive, of dubious utility, ruinous to the environment and contrary to popular will. 
Yet the Hungarian government of Karoly Grosz is having difficulty making the adjustment that a rational, market-oriented approach would require. 
The authorities in Budapest are denying that the system is a waste, as an energy shortage is possible in the 1990s. 
Mr. Grosz is complaining bitterly that the regime's opponents are blowing the project into "a political issue." 
The dams on the Danube, in any event, have become one of the issues splitting the Hungarian party and endangering the Grosz regime. 

   Widespread opposition in Hungary began to mount as details of the plans -- launched secretively 17 years ago -- dribbled into public view and as site-preparation began last fall on Hungary's dam at Nagymaros. 
The Czechoslovak work on its Gabcikovo portion, glasnost watchers will note, raised no strenuous opposition and is nearing completion. 
In Budapest, though, mass demonstrations, biting articles in the state-monitored press, selectively aired opposition in the Academy of Sciences, and criticism from political figures are pressuring the Grosz regime to reconsider the project. 

   The dam controversy spilled over into Austria, where the Greens forced the abandonment in 1985 of a nearly complete dam at Hainburg, near the Hungarian and Czechoslovak border. 
Vienna then struck a deal to buy electricity from the Hungarian part of the project, which the Austrians' participation made possible. 
Austria's critics accuse it of exploiting the nondemocratic conditions in Hungary and to export there its environmental problems and construction overcapacity. 
Financing has been guaranteed by the Austrian government on a contract to deliver to Austria over 20 years most of the Hungarian share of the project's electricity output, augmented by power from other sources such as Hungary's Paks nuclear plant, which is enlarged. 

   The Austrian opponents, including some "green" conservatives in the People's Party, have questioned in Parliament the morality of Austria's participation. 
Some support canceling the credit guarantees. 
The Austrian chancellor, Franz Vranitzky, has stated that Nagymaros was "purely a Hungarian decision" and that Austrian construction companies involved are bound by their contractual obligations. 

   The project is in a flat region engineers agree is ill-suited for hydroelectric power. 
The system requires altering 120 miles of the Danube, damming it for a drop of 70 feet at Gabcikovo and 27 feet at Nagymaros and rerouting 97.5% of the water flow over 20 miles. 
The system is said to be a serious threat to, among other things, the drinking water for three million people, farmlands and forests. 

   Benefits meanwhile will be negligible. 
The plants would, beginning in the year 2015 when deliveries to Austria end, supply only 2% to 3% of Hungary's power requirements. 
Equivalent investment in modernizing the country's antiquated energy-guzzling industry, critics point out, would not only save at least as much power but would enhance productivity. 
Associated benefits -- navigation, flood control, a linkup to an international power grid and the use of the Nagymaros dam as a highway bridge -- are either marginal or could have been achieved by other means much more cheaply and effectively. 

   The project's actual costs, let alone huge associated expenses for things like environmental-protection, and waste and water treatment, have not been disclosed, though Mr. Grosz has conceded that "now, we would not launch the project because the money is needed in other areas." 
Indeed, resources are being diverted to the barrage. 
Badly needed sewerage and water treatment facilities in two major cities, Miskolc and Debrecen, for example, have been postponed. 

   The government is claiming that the restoration and contract-penalty costs of abandoning Nagymaros would exceed the expense of completion. 
Abandonment would cost $1 billion in hard currency, argue the rulers of Hungary, which already owes $18 billion to non-socialist lenders. 
The government says the construction will cost the equivalent of $1 billion. 
Austrian financing for a third of the originally estimated construction costs obligates Hungary to pay principal and interest with 11 billion Austrian schillings worth of electricity beginning in 1996. (At current exchange rates, that's worth $830 million.) 

   The construction cost projection was made four years ago and assumed a 5% to 6% annual inflation rate. 
This year prices in Hungary are climbing by more than 17% and, according to Hungary's most authoritative economic weekly, HVG, will likely remain in the double-digit range for the next two years. 
Recent unofficial figures in Budapest newspapers put the cost of the construction alone at $1.25 billion, while estimates from the West go much higher. 

   Government promises to protect the environment are no easier to accept than its cost estimate. 
It agreed years ago to go along with scientists' recommendation to install a system to monitor water quality. 
To establish monitoring constants, scientists say, the devices should be in place five years before the system starts up. 
Completion is less than three years away, yet there is still no monitoring system. 

   Budapest is pushing ahead with work toward making the project irreversible -- the lining of the riverbed with concrete -- while attempting to seem reasonable and democratic by having ordered up expert opinions on the costs and legal implications of abandonment and by preparing to justify its decision before Parliament at the fall session, starting Wednesday. 

   To appease public opinion Budapest has begun to lobby with Czechoslovakia, the worst industrial polluter in the upper Danube, to complete treatment facilities before the start-up. 
Budapest may even agree to a ban on a peak-shedding operation, though Czechoslovakia, which gets half of the power from the complex, may not without big penalties. 
Peak-shedding would involve stopping the river flow for lengthy periods -- which is said to have the most detrimental of all the project's environmental effects -- to fill the upriver Gabcikovo reservoir and then release large amounts of water when electricity demand peaks. 

   Thus it seems that it's where rhetoric collides with costly projects involving bricks and mud that perestroika and glasnost meet their toughest test. 
Mr. Grosz has called completion of the project a question of "prestige." 
But the credibility of would-be economic reformists depends in large part on eliminating white elephants of the sort conceived by the Stalinists. 
A market system would already have written off the Danube dams.

FT  30 SEP 92 / India's dam-busters: Environmental concerns threaten the
future of a Dollars 3bn World Bank development project, writes Stefan
Wagstyl
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Manibeli, a village of thatched huts, muddy river banks and an ancient stone
temple, will tomorrow top the agenda at a World Bank meeting in Washington.
The bank's directors are due to debate the future of one of the bank's most
controversial large-scale development projects - the construction of a huge
dam across the Narmada River in north-western India.
The Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.73bn) project will supply drinking water to about
30m people through a 75,000km network of canals, the world's largest, and
generate torrents of electricity. However, it will also flood - partly or
completely - land belonging to some 240,000 of India's poorest people. They
include tribal villagers, such as the inhabitants of Manibeli, which is
located on the Narmada in Maharashtra state.
Most of the 230 families of Manibeli have already moved out to resettlement
sites purchased by the dam authorities. But most of the 30 or so who remain
say they are ready to drown rather than move from their land or the
surrounding forests which provide them with food, firewood and medicinal
herbs. Mr Narayan, the 45-year-old headman, says: 'We will not leave; our
parents are buried here.'
The villagers' stand has brought to a head the long-running battle over the
dam's construction. Critics, led by environmental lobbyists, want it stopped
on the grounds that too little consideration has been paid to the protection
of local communities or the environment. Supporters - including the World
Bank - say the benefits outweigh the costs and that displaced villagers are
being resettled on better terms than in previous schemes.
The project was first discussed as long ago as 1946 and the foundation stone
was laid by Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, in 1961.
However, the scheme was delayed by protracted disputes between the three
states through which the Narmada flows - Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya
Pradesh. It was 1979 before they were resolved and 1985 before the World
Bank approved a Dollars 450m loan.
By then, environmental lobbyists, both in India and elsewhere, were winning
public support for their concerns about large-scale construction schemes. In
1986, Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the late prime minister, acknowledged that India's
big dams had failed to deliver the promised benefits. 'Perhaps we can safely
say that almost no benefit has come to the people from these projects.'
Mr Gandhi and the World Bank saw the Narmada scheme as a chance to learn
from past mistakes. They insisted the three states leading the scheme
compensate displaced villagers in ways which safeguarded their economic and
social well-being. They also demanded a detailed environmental master plan.
However, even though large-scale construction started in 1989, the three
states failed to meet the conditions imposed upon them. A trickle of
complaints from environmental activists became a flood, and last year the
World Bank ordered an unprecedented independent review by Mr Bradford Morse,
a US development aid administrator.
Mr Morse's report, delivered this summer, shocked the bank. He concluded
that most of the environmental lobbyists' complaints were justified. 'The
projects as they stand are flawed; resettlement and rehabilitation of all
those displaced by the projects is not possible under prevailing
circumstances, and the environmental impacts of the projects have not been
properly considered or adequately addressed,' Mr Morse wrote.
He expressed particular concern about compensation for those villagers whose
rights to land had never been recorded and about the continuing absence of
any environmental master plan. Mr Morse stopped just short of recommending
abandoning the project.
World Bank experts accept many of Mr Morse's criticisms, but argue there is
time to make improvements before the main dam's completion in 2000. The
three states make the same point, adding, belligerently, that the dam will
be built with or without the World Bank.
The bank's directors are unlikely to abandon the main dam and canals when
they met on Thursday. But they could well refrain from funding other dams
the states plan along the Narmada. And they could insist that Mr Morse's
objections are met before more bank money is spent on the scheme.
That will not entirely satisfy the Manibeli villagers. But they will have
the comfort of knowing they have secured better compensation than they might
have thought possible even a year ago. Moreover, they will have helped to
force a wholesale reappraisal of the project - and, by extension, of the
value of large-scale irrigation schemes everywhere. As a World Bank official
in India says: 'We have learnt some important lessons here.'
