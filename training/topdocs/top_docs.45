   A protective cage like those required on
newer buses would not have prevented the fuel tank of a church bus
from being punctured in a fiery crash that claimed 27 lives, the
state fire marshal says.
   Fire Marshal Bill Martin said the location of a three-inch gash
on the front of the 60-gallon tank and pictures of the metal cages
required in newer buses had convinced him that whatever pierced the
tank probably would have passed between the bars of a cage.
   ``In this situation, the way this accident occurred, that cage
would have had little or no effect,'' Martin said in an interview
Thursday.
   The converted school bus owned by the Radcliff First Assembly of
God Church burst into flames after being hit head-on by a pickup
truck traveling the wrong way on Interstate 71 near Carrollton on
Saturday night.
   Twenty-seven of the 67 people on board died of smoke inhalation
in one of the nation's deadliest bus crashes. The driver, who was
allegedly drunk, has been charged with 27 counts of murder.
   Jean Fasone, head of the National Transportation Safety Board
team investigating the crash, said Martin's findings could prove
true. The NTSB team will continue trying to determine whether a
cage would have minimized damage to the fuel tank.
   Although his report will not be complete for several weeks,
Martin said the fuel tank probably was punctured by another piece
of the bus.
   In addition to the gash, NTSB investigators reported this week
that the fuel tank had been pushed back 26 inches and off one of
the two straps that fastened it to the bus.
   A protective cage might have held the tank in place, resulting
in an even larger hole, Martin said.

   The fuel tank of a bus that burst into a
fireball when a pickup truck slammed into it head-on didn't meet
federal safety requirements, investigators said after the truck's
driver was charged with 27 counts of murder.
   At the time of the accident, one of the nation's deadliest bus
crashes, truck driver Larry Mahoney's blood-alcohol level was
nearly 2{ times the legal definition of drunkenness, authorities
said Monday.
   John Ackman, Carroll County commonwealth's attorney, said he
planned to seek the death penalty against Mahoney, 34, who was in
serious condition at Humana Hospital-University of Illinois.
   Mahoney's northbound truck was traveling in the wrong direction
on Interstate 71 when it struck the church bus filled with
teen-agers and adult chaperones returning from an amusement park
near Cincinnati.
   Twenty-seven people were killed and 42 injured. The victims died
from smoke inhalation as they tried to scramble out of the burning
bus, said state medical examiner Dr. George Nichols. Seventeen
people remain hospitalized, most in critical or serious condition.
   The former school bus used by the First Assembly of God Church
in Radcliff did not meet post-1977 safety requirements for a caged
fuel tank, said Joseph Nall, a National Transportation Safety Board
investigator.
   The tank had a 3-inch gash and was pushed back 26 inches by the
crash's impact, Nall said Monday night.
   Asked if a caged tank might have prevented the fire, Nall said,
``That's the ultimate question we'd like to answer, but now it
would be premature.''
   The 1977 Superior bus with a Ford chassis, which the
manufacturer said was equipped to carry 66 passengers and a driver
_ the number aboard the night of the crash _ did not appear to be
overloaded, according to Nall.
   Some survivors said the seats that were supposed to hold three
people were too small, resulting in some people hanging in the
aisle.
   ``There were too many people on that bus,'' said Conrad Garcia.
He said he had to sit on a girl's lap in the back row because the
bench wasn't wide enough.
   NTSB investigators will remain in Kentucky for several more
days, and it could take up to 10 months before a final report is
released, Nall said.
   Investigators on Monday examined the accident site, about 45
miles northeast of Louisville, and noted some braking by both
drivers before the accident, Nall said.
   Only two survivors were interviewed as of Monday night, but more
interviews of witnesses were planned, Nall said.
   Federal investigators attempted to interview Mahoney on Monday,
but ``he would not talk to investigators for reasons of his own,''
Nall said.
   Mahoney, who was served with warrants in his hospital room, will
be arraigned once he is released. District Judge Stanley
Billingsley denied bond.
   Tests on Mahoney, of Worthville, found a 0.24 blood alcohol
level, said state police Capt. Neal Brittain. State law defines
intoxication at 0.1.
   Mahoney had a drunken driving arrest in 1984, for which he paid
a fine, and pleaded guilty twice to disorderly conduct, court
records show.
   He was twice divorced and has been living with his first wife.
He has two children.
   A friend, Dennis Mefford, said he was with Mahoney until 8:30
p.m. Saturday, about 2{ hours before the accident. Mahoney was very
tired, he said.
   Mahoney, a chemical operator at M&amp;T Chemical Co. in Carrollton,
had worked 12-hour shifts for three consecutive days before getting
off at 7 a.m. the day of the accident, Nall said.
   ``I can't remember seeing him drive in that bad a shape,''
Mefford said.
   Friends described Mahoney as a quiet man who likes to hunt and
shoot pool.
   ``He was just an easy-going, good ol' country boy,'' said
Mefford's wife, Linda. ``He was a little backward _ shy and
quiet-spoken. But people should know that he wasn't some kind of
wild maniac.''
   Flags were at half-staff Monday in Radcliff and sympathies were
spelled out on marquees and display signs at businesses and
restaurants in the main business district.
   Among those killed were Army 1st Sgt. Lee Williams' wife, Joy,
and two daughters.
   ``He has no one else,'' said Jean Grimes, Joy Williams'
identical twin. ``Joy and the kids were all he had.''

<HEAD>Report: Cage Around Bus' Fuel Tank Wouldn't Have Helped</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The crash and fire that killed 27 people
on a church bus probably would not have been prevented by a
protective cage around the vehicle's fuel tank, a state fire
marshal reported Tuesday.
   After examining fuel-tank cages on other buses, investigators
concluded ``the protective cage is to prevent the tank from being
torn away during collision and not to protect it against
puncture,'' the report said.
   The report confirmed that the fire which engulfed the bus owned
by Radcliff First Assembly of God church was caused by gasoline
gushing from a puncture, 2{ to 3 inches long, in the fuel tank.
   The bus, carrying 67 people home from an outing at an Ohio
amusement park, and a pickup truck going the wrong way collided
near Carrollton on Interstate 71 on May 14.
   The truck driver, Larry Mahoney, 35, of Worthville, was driving
while drunk, authorities said. He was indicted Friday on 27 counts
of murder _ one for each victim of the crash _ and pleaded innocent.
   The puncture probably was caused by one of the bus' front leaf
springs and the fuel tank was pushed 24 to 26 inches to the rear of
its normal position, the report said.
   ``Given the location of the puncture with respect to where the
cage would have been, it is doubtful ... that a protective cage
would have prevented the puncture of this particular tank in this
particular incident,'' the report said.
   The report said investigators could not pinpoint the source of
ignition. But investigators confirmed that the bus' front door was
knocked from its mounts, blocking escape.
   The 1977 Superior bus, bought by the church from a school
system, was among the last models manufactured before fuel-tank
cages became a federal requirement on school buses.
   The fire marshal's report recommended escape-exit windows and
roof hatches in new and old buses. The state has ordered
``pop-out'' emergency windows on new buses and recommended them for
old ones, but decided against action on roof hatches.
   The report's other recommendations included relocating fuel
tanks away from the side door of a bus; requiring emergency escape
training for passengers who ride buses on daily or weekly
schedules; restricting use of flammable materials in seats; and
improved driver training.
   Meanwhile, residents of Carroll County, where the accident
occurred, on Monday turned over a petition to the county clerk,
calling for a referendum Oct. 4 on banning liquor sales.
   A group called Concerned Citizens for Better Life gathered 1,076
signatures, more than twice the 509 needed for the alcohol sales
referendum. By Tuesday, Judge-Executive Robert Westrick had not
verified the signatures.
   A 1985 vote that let Carrollton businesses sell liquor by the
drink was decided by just 13 votes.

   The driver of a pickup truck that
collided with a church bus in a fiery weekend crash was charged
with 27 counts of murder Monday after blood tests showed he was
legally drunk at the time.
   Larry Mahoney, 34, of Worthville was served with warrants at
Humana Hospital-University of Louisville, where he is in serious
condition, officials said. A guard has been posted at his door,
police said.
   Carroll County Commonwealth's Attorney John Ackman said he will
not hesitate to seek the death penalty in the Saturday night crash
on Interstate 71 that killed 27 people returning from a church
outing at an amusement park.
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board said
at a news conference that the converted school bus did not meet
post-1977 safety requirements for a caged fuel tank.
   Joseph T. Nall, an NTSB board member, said the bus's fuel tank
had a 3-inch gash in it and had been pushed back 26 inches by the
impact of the crash.
   When asked if a caged tank might have prevented the fire that
enveloped the bus after the accident, Nall said, ``That's the
ultimate question we'd like to answer, but now it would be
premature.''
   Tests on Mahoney found a .24 blood alcohol level, said Capt.
Neal Brittain of the LaGrange state police post. Under state law, a
blood alcohol level of .10 creates the legal presumption of
intoxication.
   District Judge Stanley Billingsley denied bond. Mahoney will be
arraigned once he is released from the hospital, according to the
district court order.
   The case will go to the grand jury on June 6, Ackman said.
   Federal safety officials began an inquiry Monday into the
collision. Nall said investigators attempted to interview Mahoney
on Monday, but ``he would not talk to investigators for reasons of
his own.''
   Nall also said that the 1977 Superior bus with a Ford chassis,
which the manufacturer said was equipped to carry 66 passengers and
a driver _ the number aboard the night of the crash _ did not
appear to be overloaded.
   Some survivors have said the seats that were supposed to hold
three people were too small, resulting in some people hanging in
the aisle.
   ``It is not something we have corroborated to our
satisfaction,'' said NTSB spokesman Alan Pollock.
   Pollock said investigators on Monday examined the accident site,
about 45 miles northeast of Louisville, where Mahoney's northbound
Toyota pickup truck slammed head-on into the First Assembly of God
bus in the southbound lanes.
   In addition to checking the emergency exit, investigtors would
check the rescue process, maintenance records of the bus and their
drivers' records, said Alan Pollock, a spokesman with the National
Transportation Safety Board.
   ``We also want to talk to some of the survivors and witnesses to
the accident,'' Pollock said, and investigators hope to get ``some
kind of profile on the pickup truck and what it might have been
doing that night.''
   Authorities said it still isn't known why the truck was
traveling the wrong way.
   State officials said they hope to have positive identification
of all the bodies by Tuesday.
   The state medical examiner, Dr. George Nichols, said at a news
conference Monday that all of the victims died from smoke
inhalation. ``There was no significant bodily injury,'' he said.
   The Kentucky Post reported Monday that Mahoney pleaded guilty in
1984 to drunken driving and was fined $300 plus court costs and
$140 for traffic school. His license also was suspended for six
months, the newspaper said.
   His blood-alcohol level in the 1984 case was .16 percent, the
newspaper said.
   A friend of Mahoney's, Dennis Mefford, said he was with Mahoney
until about 2{ hours before the accident occurred. He said Mahoney
was very tired from having worked a double shift at M&amp;T Chemical
Co. in Carrollton.
   ``I can't remember seeing him drive in that bad a shape,''
Mefford said. ``It's really tore everybody up around here that
something his tragic could happen. It's unbelievable, simple
unbelievable.''
   Pollock also said the driving records of Mahoney and the bus
driver, John Pearman, would be reviewed.
   State police trooper Jim Mudd said state police investigators
talked briefly with Mahoney but did not disclose the conversation
because the case is still under investigation.
   Dental charts of the victims were sent to the University of
Louisville on Monday for matching with dental records, said David
Jones of the state medical examiner's office.

<HEAD>Government Investigating Treatment of Animals from Stranded Soviet
Circus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB McMAHON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The humane society has prodded the U.S.
Department of Agriculture into investigating complaints that a
Soviet circus tour that went bust left some animals cooped up in
undersized cages.
   Bears, chimpanzees and dogs from the Great Circus Bim Bom are
barely able to move in their cages in Newburgh, N.Y., according to
Lisa Landres, an investigator with the Humane Society of the United
States.
   So on Thursday the group's regional office in Flanders, N.J.,
asked the government to look into the case, she said.
   Seven handlers from the circus are caring for the 59 animals,
many of them horses. The company that contracted to transport the
animals is paying to feed them.
   The broke circus performers are stranded at a pair of suburban
Atlanta hotels.
   Ms. Landres said the cages are ``very ramshackle, old and
dilapidated and far too small.'' She said a 7-foot-tall grizzly
bear weighing about 1,000 pounds is bent over in a cage and other
animals are even more cramped.
   ``It's really sad. The three lions are in there like sardines.
The primates are in cages just about the size of their bodies,''
she said. ``The same with the dogs.''
   Agriculture Department spokeswoman Marlene Stinson said a report
on the case will be completed next week. If conditions are found to
be unacceptable, the animals could be moved to better quarters, she
said.
   Ms. Landres said the humane society holds the tour operator
responsible and not the animals' current guardians, the Alex
Nichols Agency Inc. of Elmont, N.Y.
   For its part, the Nichols concern disagreed with the society's
view of the animals' treatment.
   Operations manager Ed Hayes said the agency has spent up to
$5,000 a day to care for the animals and to house their Russian
handlers. He said all but the lions are allowed out of their cages
for exercise.
   ``You just don't take a lion out and walk it around in the
middle of Newburgh,'' Hayes said.
   Hayes said he's offered to place the animals in bigger cages if
the humane society can find some.
   He blames the predicament on the tour operator, International
Showbusiness Inc. of Clearwater, Fla., saying it failed to promote
the shows properly and seek the right backing.
   ``They were not prepared for this circus,'' he said.
   Andy Trueman, the circus' managing director, has attributed the
problems to the tour's original Kuwaiti backers, Waleed A.A. Ahmad
and his father, Khoorsheed Ahmad.
   They withdrew after losing $331,000 and a promised 10 percent of
the receipts, said their lawyer, Brooks Savage. They never intended
to back the whole tour, Savage said.
   The Bim Bom circus performed just two shows before canceling a
scheduled 32-week U.S. tour two weeks ago after running out of
money.
   The 138-member all-star circus, which includes performers from
60 Soviet circuses, arrived in the United States March 31.
   It performed in Hershey, Pa., and Knoxville, Tenn., then
canceled the tour in Johnson City, Tenn., after the trip's backers
withdrew their support. The circus' performers and production staff
moved to suburban Atlanta, where their stays have been supported by
benefactors.
   The animals were trucked from Johnson City to a Newburgh
facility run by the Nichols agency.
   ``They would have been out on the side of the road tied on a
guardrail somewhere if we didn't come along,'' said Hayes.
   The agency is owed $47,000 plus about $30000 more in animal care
expenses, he said.

<TEXT>     "Well, sure we had a little business going there," Patterson said, one hand
on his enormous brass belt buckle engraved "California Ram Hunt" -- the name
of his ranch. "What's the difference if they put the thing to sleep in a zoo
or if somebody wants to mount it on the wall and appreciate it?";    Federal
and state investigators charge Patterson with purchasing a number of
endangered animals, including Bengal tigers, for "big game hunts" on his ranch
in southeastern Monterey County. Investigators say the third-generation
Monterey County rancher charged hunters to shoot the animals and take their
stuffed carcasses home as trophies. He is charged with 27 misdemeanors; Dawn
Patterson faces four counts.;    Kenneth J. Oravsky, a taxidermist who
allegedly prepared the trophies for Patterson, also was charged with 28
misdemeanor counts. The three face up to a year in prison and a $1,000 fine
for each misdemeanor.;    The majority of the charges involve violations of
endangered species laws and permit procedures.;    Monterey County Municipal
Court Judge Alan Hedegard set June 10 for the Pattersons' trial. No trial date
has yet been set for Oravsky.;    Federal officials also are looking into the
case.;    Investigators say some of the animals, which hunters paid up to
$3,500 to kill, were shot less than 100 feet from their cages. Others, too
tame to leave their enclosures, were shot in the cages and dragged outside for
photographs of the hunters with their catch, according to court records.;   
While most of the customers who came to the ranch have not been identified,
one client, Nicholas Miljevich of Saratoga, was charged in a separate
complaint with possessing a dead tiger, leopard and mountain lion. He asked
the court Thursday for a public defender to represent him.;    The Pattersons'
lawyer, Singh Aulakh of Visalia, said he would mount a political defense of
his clients, charging that their civil rights have been violated, though he
did not mention how. He also threatened to file suit against the county. While
acknowledging that the animals were killed at the Patterson ranch, he will
argue that shooting the sometimes toothless, elderly cats in their cages was
"more humane" than letting them die natural deaths.;    "I don't see any big
deal, I don't see any big deal to this at all," Aulakh said. "Yes, they were
shot on the grounds of Patterson ranch, but you should see what I have on my
wall. In a way they're putting an animal out of its misery. My God, if you
look at the pictures of these animals, I think you'll agree that this is the
best thing that could have happened to them.";    Like many ranchers in these
rolling foothills, Patterson has long conducted legal boar and ram hunts on
his property. But early in the spring of 1990, animal dealer Thurston Comstock
of Dragoon, Ariz., approached them about buying exotic cats for hunts, Dawn
Patterson told investigators. They had previously bought bighorn sheep and
goats from Comstock for hunting.;    She told investigators that Comstock
delivered two Bengal tigers and one black panther, a leopard and other animals
to their ranch.;    Some of the animals had been sedated, caged and placed in
the center of a truck trailer, investigators said, and the rear of the trailer
was then filled with sheep to obscure the cages from agricultural inspectors
at the state line.;    After arrival, the cats were kept in livestock trailers
for a few days and fed goat meat and chickens, Dawn Patterson said.;    In a
telephone interview last week, Comstock denied transporting exotic animals to
the Pattersons' ranch.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     In 1985, Congress refined the Animal Welfare Act with the aim of improving
conditions for the thousands of laboratory animals now used in the United
States for experimentation and research. I sponsored an amendment to that law
calling for changes in the care of primates -- chimpanzees, baboons, rhesus
and other monkeys -- to enhance their "psychological well-being.";   Personal
outrage; I insisted on the amendment after visiting a research facility of the
National Institutes of Health near Washington. To my shock and dismay, I found
that the primates were confined in individual cages about the size of a small
shower stall.;   These well-built steel structures were to be the "homes" of
individual animals for several years. I also learned that only a few
facilities routinely provided even limited exercise for the animals out of the
cages.;   The U.S. Department of Agriculture has now promulgated regulations
to enforce the law, but unfortunately it has failed on two important issues:
primate cage size and the exercise of dogs.;   The same cages; The new USDA
regulations specify exactly the same cage sizes for primates that weigh as
much as 105 pounds: Envision a small cell 3 1/2 feet wide and 8 feet long with
a 7-foot ceiling and you have the picture. The smaller 3-foot cages are deemed
suitable for primates weighing as much as 55 pounds.;   One of the regulations
requires provision for "normal postural adjustment" by the animals.
Apparently, NIH and USDA believe "normal" adjustments are met as long as the
baboon confined in one of the 3-foot cubes can stand on all four feet, turn
around and sit down. But what about standing upright, lying down stretched out
or stretching their arms? And in some research institutions animals live in
their cages for years and are only occasionally let out.;   Is it humane for
these animals to be so confined?;   Also unkind to dogs; Congressional intent
on exercise for dogs also is not met in the new regulations. The new
regulations require only that individually caged dogs be released. This
excludes dogs that are confined two at a time in a double cage system or in
other groupings. USDA officials offer as a rationale for this that dogs in
double cages can exercise all the time and thus need not be released.;   The
USDA veterinarians add that since another regulation provides for daily
cleaning of the cages, such as in the case of a double-size cage with two
beagles, the only feasible method would be to remove the beagles to clean the
cage. In other words, while the dogs are out of the cage they can exercise as
they wish.;   Good for research, too; There is an axiom that the best medical
research is performed on normal, healthy animals and that some research
results may be questionable when abnormal animals are used. Indeed, the
"psychological well-being" amendment has resulted in improvements and
innovations at a significant number of research facilities.;   Keeping a
primate alone in a small cage for years degrades psychological well-being,
according to many primatologists, including Jane Goodall.;   There is a
lawsuit in federal court to address the inadequacies of the regulations. As a
former legislator, I would be disappointed if the issue could not be settled
without leaving it for a court decision.;   University research institutions
tend to brush off criticism from animal-rights activists as an effort to limit
medical research. Yet there is plenty of room for improving the care of
animals while advancing research. These dual causes do, in fact, complement
each other.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Safety Officials Had Thought Bus Riders Would Have Time to Escape</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Before the bus accident that left 27
people dead of smoke inhalation, federal safety officials were
confident that riders would have enough time to escape a burning
bus before it was engulfed by flames, a top official testified
Wednesday.
   ``Up until May 14 of this year, we were patting ourselves on the
back for the good job we had done,'' said Ralph Hitchcock, director
of the office of vehicle safety standards for the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration. ``Now we're reviewing all of our
standards for bus safety.''
   Twenty-seven people died that night when a school bus owned by
the First Assembly of God church in Radcliff burst into flames upon
impact with a pickup truck on Interstate 71 near Carrollton. All
survived the crash but couldn't escape the smoke.
   The pickup truck driver, Larry Mahoney, 35, of Worthville, has
pleaded innocent to 27 counts of murder as well as other charges,
including drunken driving.
   ``We believed that there were sufficient exits to allow the
people to get out in a reasonable amount of time and, up until this
crash, I don't think we've had any indication that that was not
so,'' Hitchcock said.
   Hitchcock's testimony came on the second day of National
Transportation Safety Board hearings on the fatal crash. In other
testimony, a consultant for Ford Motor Co., which built the bus'
chassis, said a cage around the bus' fuel tank may not have
prevented the fire.
   Hitchcock said results of bus interior-flammability tests had
indicated passengers on a school bus would have enough time to get
out of a bus before it burned.
   ``We had never had an occurrence where anyone was unable to get
out on a timely basis because of flammability problems,'' he said.
``There were some close calls, but they were able to get off.''
   Hitchcock testified that it usually takes 1{ minutes to evacuate
a bus and four to five minutes for a bus to become engulfed in
flames. However, in the Carrollton accident, flames blocked the
front door, leaving a rear emergency exit as the only door.
   ``We're talking about millions-to-one probability that all of
the factors are going to add up here to cause a problem,'' he said.
``We don't design our requirements to prevent one-of-a-kind
accidents.''
   John Habberstad, a consulting engineer specializing in accident
reconstruction, testified that a cage around the fuel tank may not
have stopped the fire. The bus was built shortly before new
regulations requiring such a cage went into effect.
   The tank was punctured by a piece of the bus' spring assembly
that broke off shortly after impact, he said.
   ``It wasn't until some 50 feet down the road (from impact) that
a free-flying projectile (the spring assembly) penetrated the
tank,'' Habberstad said. ``The tank guard is not designed to
prevent penetration by an object such as this. It's meant to
protect intrusion from something like the pickup.''
   The NTSB's hearings end Thursday. The board will report on the
crash's probable causes and recommend how to avoid similar
accidents, but it has no power to require implementation.

<HEAD>Tiger Bites off Zookeeper's Arm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Bengal tiger bit off a 19-year-old zookeeper's
arm as she was giving it water with a hose from outside its cage at
a northern Japan safari park, police said today.
   A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
attack occurred Tuesday at the Tohoku Safari Park Zoo in Fukushima
state, 150 miles northeast of Tokyo.
   Kimie Nagasaku, told police from her hospital bed that she was
giving the animal water from outside the cage when it bit off her
right arm at the elbow, but she declined to discuss details, the
official said.
   The official said police believed she might have put her hand
into the cage as she guided the hose. The tiger could not have
reached through the 2-inch space between bars in the cage, he said.
   Akihiko Ando, a zoo official, said other keepers heard a scream
and rushed to the tiger's cage. Ms. Nagasaku had fed the tiger and
cleaned its cage daily since April 1, officials said.
   Ando said it was the first case of anyone being hurt by an
animal at the zoo since it opened 11 years ago.
   There are about 130 carnivorous animals in the zoo and about 1
million people visit it annually, he said.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Cause of Gash Evidently Determined</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COVINGTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The gasoline tank on a church bus that
erupted into flames after being hit head-on by a pickup truck was
ruptured by a piece of the bus's springs, a published report says.
   Twenty-seven people _ mostly teen-agers _ were killed in the May
14 disaster on Interstate 71 near Carrollton. The driver of the
pickup, Larry W. Mahoney, 34, has pleaded innocent to 27 counts of
murder in the case.
   In its Friday editions, The Kentucky Post of Covington quoted an
unidentified source as saying the leaf-spring assembly broke loose
from the bus's frame, causing a 3-inch gash in the gas tank. The
leaf-spring assembly is a shock absorber built on curved strips of
metal.
   The newspaper quoted the source as saying that a protective cage
required on modern buses might not have prevented the tragedy.
   ``If the tank had been in a cage as now required on similar
buses, the puncture and ensuing fire might have happened a fraction
of a second sooner,'' the source said. ``I don't believe a cage
would have prevented the gash.''
   Alan Pollock, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety
Board in Washington, D.C., confirmed that investigators found a
3-inch gash in the tank of the First Assembly of God bus. He would
not say whether they have linked the puncture to the leaf spring
assembly.
   Meanwhile, the state police traffic accident report on the
disaster was filed Friday, but the 20-page report does not say what
caused the gash in the gas tank.
   State Police Capt. Neal Brittain said some details of the wreck
are not known. He said he could not discuss a cause of the
explosion ``simply because we can't'' at this time.
   He said a detailed reconstruction of the wreck will follow in a
supplemental report in two to three weeks.
   ``We want to make sure everything done in the reconstruction is
accurate,'' he said.
   The newspaper quoted its source as saying the reconstruction
indicates the bus driver turned to the left to avoid the pickup and
was hit on the right corner by the door.
   A left-hand curve lay just ahead of the bus. A night vision test
indicated the bus driver probably was not aware of the pickup until
the vehicles were about 350 feet apart, the newspaper said.
   At 350 feet, the drivers of vehicles traveling toward each at 60
mph would have approximately two seconds to react, according to the
report.
   The speed of the two vehicles has not been revealed by the
safety board or the state police.

<TEXT>
   A court ruled Friday that an egg
producer who kept his 2,000 hens in small cages was not guilty of
cruelty to animals, as alleged by animal rights activists.
   ``The verdict is a great relief. It would have been too much to
be found guilty of cruelty to my 2,000 hens,'' Karl Wettre was
quoted as saying by the national NTB news agency after his
acquittal.
   The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
claimed that by keeping hens in small cages, Wettre violated
national legislation to allow animals' natural development and
behavior.
   But the court found that Wettre observed Norwegian regulations
stipulating that a hen should have at least 112 square inches of
cage space in which to live.
   NSPCA chairman Toralf Metveit was quoted as saying: ``I'm
disappointed but not surprised.''
   The society was ordered pay $15,600 in court costs.

<TEXT>
   Students shouted ``Tiger bait! Tiger,
bait!'' at a man who for nearly five hours occupied the outer cage
of Louisiana State University's 500-pound Bengal tiger mascot
before he surrendered.
   The intruder, Moacyr Cezar, a 49-year-old native of Sao Paulo,
Brazil, who has lived in Baton Rouge two years, merely wanted a
job, authorities said.
   He seized the keys of the cage from a student trainer Wednesday
evening and then demanded in broken English and Portuguese to speak
with LSU basketball coach Dale Brown, said university spokesman
Gary Ballard.
   Marksmen stood by with tranquilizer guns in case the tiger got
loose. A police SWAT team also stood by.
   At one point, some of the hundreds of students who came to watch
chanted: ``Tiger bait! Tiger bait!'' _ the cry used at LSU sporting
events when opposing teams enter.
   Cezar surrendered after talking with Jose Vargas, LSU's center
who is from the Dominican Republic.
   ``He's upset, man. He's going to be all right,'' Vargas said
after Cezar surrendered.
   Cezar was booked on first-degree robbery, criminal mischief and
criminal trespassing, said police Sgt. Greg Phares. No bond was set
immediately.
   Ballard said Cezar served for the past two semesters as a
proctor who was given room and board in LSU's athletic dormitory in
return for his services as an unpaid supervisor.
   ``He wants a job. He has some sort of problem with his temporary
visa. He says he wants a work permit,'' said Ballard.
   Although authorities said they feared he had a pistol and heard
him say he had a bomb, Ballard said no weapons or bomb were found
when the standoff ended.
   Cezar himself was never in danger from the tiger, a 13-year-old
named Mike IV who paced restlessly behind him. And though he
threatened to free the tiger, Cezar didn't leave the barred outer
cage that surrounds the main cage where the big cat actually lives.
   At one point, negotiators passed a document between the cage's
bars to Cezar. Ballard said it was an application for employment.
   Brown, in Florida, was told of the incident but had no immediate
plans to return, Ballard said.
   Brown's wife, Vonnie, and some of LSU's Spanish-speaking
basketball players were among those who talked with Cezar.

<TEXT>
   A former Ford Motor Co. executive said
today a protective cage around the fuel tank of a church bus
probably would not have prevented a fire that killed 27 people.
   The testimony came at Larry Mahoney's trial on 27 counts of
murder in a wrong-way collision between the bus and Mahoney's
pickup. His attorneys say he unknowingly may have drunk
vodka-spiked soda pop before the May 14, 1988 crash.
   Twenty-four youngsters and three adults died in the accident on
Interstate 71 near here after flames consumed the bus from the
Radcliff First Assembly of God Church.
   Although a cage probably would not have prevented the fire,
former Ford vice president Thomas Feahney testified, ``there was
technology available that could have prevented this tragic
accident.'' He did not elaborate.
   The automotive engineer said the impact caused gasoline to
squirt ``like a flame thrower'' into the passenger section.
   On Monday, defense attorneys sought to establish that the former
school bus had safety defects that caused it to burst into flames.
The victims died of smoke inhalation or burns rather than of
injuries from the impact.
   ``Part of the defense has been the claim of involuntary
intoxication,'' defense attorney William Summers told reporters,
explaining the significance of testimony that a friend gave Mahoney
a cocktail of Diet Pepsi and vodka.
   ``To voluntarily drink something, you've got to have some idea
of what you're drinking,'' Summers said.
   Mahoney, 36, a factory worker from rural Owen County, is charged
with 27 counts of murder, 12 of assault, 42 of wanton endangerment
and one of drunken driving.
   His blood-alcohol level after the crash tested as high as 0.24
percent _ nearly 2{ times the state's definition of intoxication,
according to earlier testimony.
   Among those testifying Monday was Phil Downey, a longtime friend
of Mahoney's who was with him at a gathering he left less than an
hour before the 10:55 p.m. crash.
   Downey recalled Mahoney asking Kelly Osborne, a friend at the
gathering, what he was drinking. He said Osborne gave Mahoney a cup
of Diet Pepsi and vodka, saying, ``This is better for you than any
ld beer you ever drank.''
   Mahoney drank the mixture, Downey testified.
   Under cross-examination by Assistant Attorney General Paul
Richwalsky Jr., Downey said Mahoney appeared drunk when he drove
away.
   ``He shouldn't have been driving,'' Downey said.
   Summers said he would try to prove Mahoney didn't know what was
in the cup.
   The defense contends unsafe design of the 1977 school bus is to
blame for the deaths. A federal investigation after the crash found
the bus's exposed fuel tank prone to fire.
   Also testifying Monday was state Fire Marshal John William
Martin, who said the fire wouldn't have been prevented by a
protective cage around the bus' gas tank. The blaze erupted after a
piece of the bus's suspension punctured the tank.
   Martin said it couldn't be determined if the thick black smoke
that filled the bus and was blamed for most of the deaths was
caused by the burning of gasoline alone or the burning of plastic
seat covers and cushions.

   A man demanding to talk with Louisiana
State University's basketball coach entered the outer cage of LSU's
Bengal tiger mascot Wednesday but gave up after a five-hour
standoff, authorities said.
   LSU spokesman Gary Ballard said that the intruder had threatened
to free the 13-year-old, 500-pound tiger but that marksmen with
tranquilizer guns were nearby. The man had also claimed to have a
bomb in a bag, Ballard said.
   At one point, students who came to watch chanted: ``Tiger bait!
Tiger bait!'' _ the cry raised at LSU sporting events when the
opposing team enters.
   The man was recognized by students as Moacyr ``Bruno'' Cezar, an
ardent fan of the basketball team who lives in LSU's athletic
dormitory in return for doing work around the place.
   ``He wants a job. He has some sort of problem with his temporary
visa. He says he wants a work permit,'' said Ballard. At one point,
negotiators passed a document through the bars to him. Ballard said
it was ``an application for employment.''
   Cezar surrendered at 10:10 p.m. after talking with Jose Vargas,
the Spanish-speaking LSU center who is from the Dominican Republic.
Accompanied by a priest and two detectives, Cezar was taken to the
police station.
   No charges had been filed by late Wednesday night.
   ``He's upset, man. He's going to be all right. He'll talk to you
tomorrow,'' Vargas said.
   The coach, Dale Brown, was in Florida, but his wife, Vonnie, and
some of LSU's Spanish-speaking basketball players were among those
trying to talk Cezar out. Cezar is a Brazilian who speaks mainly
Portugese.
   Brown was told of the incident but had no immediate plans to
return, Ballard said.
   Cezar had entered a cage surrounding the one in which the tiger
is kept by taking the keys from the animal's trainer, who was
cleaning the cage, said Ballard.
   ``This individual walked up and demanded the keys to the cage.
He threatened the trainer. The trainer thinks he had a gun, but
he's not sure,'' Ballard said. No weapons or bomb were found when
the standoff ended, he said.
   Ballard said the intruder for a time held both the trainer and
an unidentified young woman inside the cage as his hostages.
   A police SWAT team stood about 100 yards away during the
standoff.
   By nightfall, hundreds of students, LSU officials and reporters
had flocked to the cage between the football stadium and the arena
where the basketball team plays.
   LSU spokesmen said the intruder had been befriended by Brown and
had become one of the LSU basketball team's most enthusiastic fans.
Ballard said the man also had been enrolled in an LSU program to
improve his English.
   ``He's been a volunteer observer of LSU basketball for the past
two years and has been quite close to Coach Brown,'' said Ballard.

<TEXT>     "You're talking about Tony the Tiger here," said Bill Talkin, a special
agent for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service investigating the Monterey County
case. "It's really atrocious.";    At the 5,000-acre Patterson Ranch in
southern Monterey County, the farthest one of the rare cats got from its cage
before it was shot was 100 feet, witnesses said. One of the animals was so
docile it wouldn't leave its cage while the trophy hunters who paid to kill it
stood waiting, Talkin said. The cat was shot to death in its cage and skinned,
Talkin said.;    But one of the ranchers charged in the case, Floyd Lester
Patterson III, 44, said in a telephone interview that the 38 criminal charges
filed against him, his wife and a taxidermist are overblown.;    "The way
they're talking about it, they're talking like it was a crapshoot or
something. It wasn't nothing like that," Patterson said. "I'm a hunter; I lead
guided hunts. There's nothing wrong with that.";    Patterson's attorney did
not return several calls made to his Visalia office.;    Talkin said federal
authorities confiscated photographs and videotapes of black jaguars, tigers,
leopards and mountain lions being shot on the Patterson property. He said they
were tipped off by a former assistant to Kenneth Oravsky who helped the
taxidermist skin, stuff and mount the endangered cats for clients of the
ranch.;    Talkin said that hunters came from all over the United States to
hunt at the ranch, but he said the number of people who participated in the
shoots is unclear.;    David McMullen, assistant regional manager of the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service in Portland, Ore., said that trade in endangered
species in the United States is relatively rare. With only several thousand
Bengal tigers left in the world, he termed dealing in them and other big cats
for profit and shooting them "despicable.";    "It's a rigged shoot, I don't
like to call it a hunt," McMullen said. "I guess their desire is to get a
trophy for their trophy room. And there are people willing to pay money to
shoot an animal when it comes out of a cage.";    Leopard, jaguar and mountain
lion hides cost about $5,000 on the black market, McMullen said. A Bengal
tiger hide can run more than $10,000, he said.;    Many of the animals used in
the black market hunting trade are zoo animals sold when they are too old or
sick to exhibit, then funneled to smugglers who deal in the endangered species
for profit, investigators said.;    The Patterson Ranch is a working cattle
ranch that has been in the same family for several generations, Monterey
County officials said. But most of the cattle on the ranch have been sold as
feed became scarce during the drought. As a result, the Pattersons appear to
have stepped up their operation of what they call "California Ram Hunt" -- so
named for the legal guided hunting tours of exotic sheep, boars and deer they
run on the ranch.;    ...; Investigators say it is unclear how long the
illegal hunts were taking place.;    Patterson, his wife Dawn Patterson and
Oravsky could each be sentenced to five years in jail and be ordered to pay
$50,000 for each animal shot on the ranch. They will be arraigned in King City
Municipal Court on May 9.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  I'm writing to urge people to boycott Circus Vargas.;    The life of a circus
animal is one of misery and deprivation. Every major humane society in the
United States is against circuses due to their abuse of animals, and many
European countries have banned or restricted the use of animals in
entertainment.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  FOR ANIMALS, CIRCUS MEANS ONLY MISERY AND
DEPRIVATION  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Letters to the Editor  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Living quarters for the animals are often as small as possible for ease of
handling on the road, and the animals are confined to those cages when not
performing. This means, for example, that tigers -- which in the wild may
range over 1,000 square miles -- are restricted to cages as small as 12 feet
by 6 feet. Unable to move around normally, the animals become bored and
neurotic. Often, the cages are too hot or too cold, and it is common for
animals to go without food, water or veterinary care for long periods of time
due to the circus' tight time schedule.;    Consider the "tricks" circus
animals perform. Fire inspires fear in all animals; the only way an animal
would jump through a hoop of fire is if the only alternative is punishment.
Circus animals perform tricks because they have been brutalized with whips,
prods and sharp hooks.;    In addition, circus rings commonly mix animals of
incompatible species. Lions and tigers are mortal enemies, as are bears and
the big cats. Animal deaths and injuries have occurred from such abnormal
combinations.;    When one knows the truth behind the happy circus facade,
it's difficult to be entertained by it.;    Those of us living on the Central
Coast are lucky to have ample opportunity to see wild animals. We have
endangered whales in Monterey Bay year-round, elephant seals at Ano Nuevo,
deer at Big Basin and sea otters, sea lions and sea birds in Santa Cruz and
Monterey.;    If you are a parent thinking of taking your children to the
circus, please consider these humane and natural alternatives. If we are to
live in a peaceful world, we must give the animals peace as well.;    --

<HEADLINE>  JURORS PICKED IN CATS TRIAL
HUNTING-RANCH OWNERS INDICTED ON 44 COUNTS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Floyd and Dawn Patterson were arrested in April for allegedly charging
hunters a fee to kill tigers, lions and jaguars, including some old and
toothless animals that refused to budge from their cages and were shot from
less than 100 feet away.;    In a 44-count indictment, investigators accused
the Pattersons of charging hunters $3,500 to kill the wild cats, get pictures
taken with the dead animals and then take them home after they were stuffed.
The indictment cited the killing of two Bengal tigers, one spotted leopard, a
black jaguar, a crossbred cat and two mountain lions.;    The misdemeanor
counts, most of which deal with violations of the endangered-species law and
permit process, carry a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a $1,000 fine
each.;    Jury selection began Monday. About 8,000 people live in King City,
and many prospective jurors were dismissed after saying they knew the
Pattersons well enough to be possibly biased.;    Some potential jurors were
excused after saying they couldn't stand the thought of helpless animals being
killed.;    "I just feel too strongly about shooting caged animals," one woman
said before she was dismissed.;    Outside the courtroom, the Pattersons'
attorney, Singh Aulakh, said his clients did not do anything wrong by giving
hunters a chance to kill some unusual wild game at their California Ram Hunt
ranch. He said there's no state law against wild-game hunts.;    "It's not a
crime to shoot these animals," Aulakh said. "I don't know what all the fuss
and excitement is about.";    In early June, Monterey County taxidermist
Kenneth Oravsky, 45, pleaded guilty to six misdemeanor counts of illegal
possession of endangered animals. In exchange, lawyers promised him a maximum
sentence of six months in jail and a $10,000 fine. He also agreed to testify
against the Pattersons.  </TEXT>

Joe Maynard is a tough-talking trucker who loves exotic big cats but has a hard 
time getting along with the state officials who try to regulate how he cages 
and cares for his rare leopards and tigers. 
</P>
<P>
"They try to tell us how to run things, but they've got no expertise 
whatsoever," said Maynard, a wiry, bearded man who spends 14 days at a time as 
a cross-country truck driver. 
</P>
<P>
Maynard and his wife Jeanne run the Exotic Feline Breeding Compound Inc. a 
private, nonprofit zoo located west of this small desert town in Kern County, 
about 80 miles north of Los Angeles. Many of the 40 wild cats caged here are 
endangered species, some are owned by zoos that have loaned them to Maynard for 
breeding. 
</P>
<P>
State regulators say the Maynards are operating a zoo without proper 
accreditation and have been keeping wild animals without a state permit that 
has been required since 1985, when new animal protection laws went into effect. 
The facility does not meet new state standards, primarily because its cages are 
too small, state inspectors say. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to 1985, the compound was exempt from state regulation because it was 
classified as a private zoo, officials said. But under the new law, such 
facilities must meet standards set by the American Assn. of Zoos, Parks and 
Aquariums, a national organization created to upgrade animal protection and 
public safety criteria. 
</P>
<P>
Already operating on a shoestring budget funded by donations and paid 
memberships in their zoo, the Maynards said, they want to upgrade their cages 
to association standards but have little money with which to do so. They have 
built one big new cage, for the snow leopards, but most of their funds must go 
for care and breeding, Maynard said. 
</P>
<P>
"The bureaucrats in Sacramento are wrong. . . . We have a bona fide zoo," 
Maynard argued, claiming that the compound should be exempt from state 
regulations because it is a designated federal research facility and has the 
necessary federal permits to handle and transport endangered species. State 
officials agree that he has the federal permits, but say the new state rules 
must be applied. 
</P>
<P>
Maynard has little nice to say about state officials, but his whole demeanor 
changes when he walks among the big cats, talking about breeding programs and 
the need to keep the rare cats from becoming extinct. He is gentle with the 
felines. 
</P>
<P>
"All my life I've loved big cats," he explained. He bought his first leopard 20 
years ago for $600. The couple lived in Northridge then. "I wanted to breed . . 
. these leopards because they were being killed off and I wanted to do 
something to save them." 
</P>
<P>
The Maynards moved from Northridge to Simi Valley, then to Kern County in 1977, 
buying 68 acres to make room for their cats. Doing the work himself, Maynard 
built the cages and fenced off the compound. In 1983 the Maynards formed the 
nonprofit corporation and sold 2,000 memberships to finance the operation. Last 
year they raised $134,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Maynard has no college degrees, he has a good reputation among zoo 
professionals active in the work of saving exotic cats. Breeding the animals in 
captivity is essential to the effort to save them from extinction, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
The Maynards' unusual collection includes seven North Chinese leopards, a pair 
of snow leopards from the Himalayas, on loan from the San Diego Zoo, several 
big Siamese tigers and three tiny Temminck's Golden Cats. The compound -- a 
haphazard mix of old cages, new construction and mobile homes -- is open to the 
public, without charge. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got one of the best collections (of North Chinese) leopards in the 
country . . . in terms of genetics." said veterinarian Allen Schoemaker of the 
Riverbank Zoo in Charlotte, N.C. Schoemaker keeps breeding records on the 90 
Chinese leopards in captivity. No one knows how many of these rare cats still 
exist in the wilds of northern China. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Competent' 
</P>
<P>
"His knowledge of (big cats) . . . is very superior from what you'd expect in 
the private sector," said Pat Morris, a zoo veterinarian and assistant 
professor of wildlife medicine at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. 
Morris, one of Maynard's medical consultants, added, "He is very competent." 
</P>
<P>
State Department of Fish and Game officials concede that Maynard cares about 
animals but insist that his facilities must now meet state standards. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past we had no serious problems with him, but the law has changed," 
said Celeste Cushman, a department spokeswoman. The state's caging and fencing 
standards had to be upgraded to protect both the animals and the public, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Maynards' cats are housed in cages that are about 10 by 20 feet. 
Each contains a heavy plywood shelter. The flooring is dirt and few of the 
cages have double-gated entryways to prevent escapes. As Maynard builds new 
cages, he is adding these safety features. 
</P>
<P>
When the Maynards failed to comply with the department's demands, the state 
Fish and Game Commission stepped into the controversy. At first the Maynards 
refused to participate in commission hearings, but in February they appeared to 
present their case. The commission gave the couple 90 days to come up with a 
plan detailing how they will meet state standards within three years. 
</P>
<P>
"No one wants to take animals away from him," said Harold C. Cribbs, the 
commission's executive secretary. Cribbs said the department has been 
cooperating with Maynard on developing such a plan. If a plan cannot be worked 
out, the commission could seize the animals, Cribbs said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, state game wardens are asking the Kern County district 
attorney to file misdemeanor charges against the Maynards for importing a North 
Chinese leopard in January, in violation of a department order. The animal is 
on loan from the Omaha Zoo. The state had instructed the couple not to obtain 
any more animals until they are in compliance with state laws. 
</P>
<P>
Maynard denied that he violated the law, saying that he had a valid federal 
permit to transport the leopard from Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
"They (state wardens) came here with the cops . . . (and) said we'd brought 
that cat in illegally," Maynard said. Zoo keepers who work with the Maynards on 
a regular basis say they are not put off by the compound's physical facilities 
because the couple cares for its animals and works to preserve threatened 
species. 
</P>
<P>
"It's true their facilities . . . don't meet (public) zoo standards," said Dr. 
Lee Simmons, director of the Omaha Zoo. "But by all reports . . . Joe Maynard 
doesn't fall short on animal care. . . . (He) really cares about his animals."

   A 450-pound Siberian tiger named Miguel crashed
through a window to attack and kill an employee at the Houston Zoo
this morning, zoo officials said.
   Ricardo Tovar, 59, was killed after the tiger went crashed
through a 2{-foot-wide window that was part of his cage, said John
Werler, zoo director.
   ``It cut him up and ate him up pretty good,'' said Houston Fire
Department paramedic Howard Shaw.
   Shaw said Tovar, a 10-year-employee of the zoo, was found by a
co-worker about five minutes after the 7:45 a.m. attack. The tiger
was outside in a natural habitat display while Tovar was in an
interior hallway when the attack occurred.
   The tiger crashed through a window, attacked the zookeeper and
dragged him outside. The animal ran into an enclosed part of its
cage after zoo curator Tom Dieckow fired three shots and sprayed a
fire extinguisher to scare it. The animal was not wounded.
   Werler said the Siberian tiger would probably not be destroyed
because it is an endangered species.
   The tiger initially was reported to be named ``Rambo,'' the
other male Siberian tiger at the zoo. One of Tovar's jobs was to
feed the big cats.
   About 90 minutes after the attack, an orange sheet was draped
over what appeared to be a body on the ground at the zoo's tiger
display. The display was roped off with yellow tape.
   The zoo opened for business about 10:30, about 30 minutes later
than usual.
   The tiger has been isolated in its cage, officials said.
   The Siberian tiger is the largest of eight types of tigers and
can measure up to 13 feet and weigh as much as 720 pounds.

<LEADPARA>  In the first such case in California, two Monterey County ranchers were
convicted Tuesday of 42 counts of violating state endangered species laws when
they illegally imported exotic animals to their sprawling property and charged
hunters to kill the big game at close range.;    A King City Municipal Court
jury deliberated for seven hours before finding Floyd Patterson, 35, and Dawn
Patterson, 31, guilty of every count on which they were tried. Investigators
say Floyd Patterson charged hunters up to $3,500 to shoot the animals and take
their stuffed carcasses home as trophies. He was convicted on 35 counts and
Dawn Patterson on seven counts as an accomplice.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I don't think it's ever going to happen in the state of California again,"
said the prosecutor in the case, Monterey County Deputy District Attorney Russ
Scott. "I don't think anybody's going to take the chance.";    During the
trial, Scott detailed an extensive commercial hunting operation through a
calendar and business ledgers seized at the ranch. Hunters paid a package fee
to the Patterson business, California Ram Hunt, and were given food and
lodging at the ranch house.;    Cat hides in courtroom;  Jurors were shown
photographs of Floyd Patterson and his hunter clients posing with freshly shot
Bengal tigers, a spotted leopard, a black jaguar and several other species of
cats listed by the federal government as endangered species. Cat hides
confiscated from the Patterson's Lockwood ranch lay on the floor of the
courtroom during much of the proceedings, and a Bengal tiger skull was passed
around to jurors.;    Prosecution witnesses testified at the two-week trial
that eight cats were killed at the Patterson ranch between May and July 1990.
The witnesses included an accomplice in the hunting operation, the taxidermist
who skinned and mounted the dead animals. He pleaded guilty to reduced charges
earlier this month in exchange for his testimony.;    "I'm stunned," Dawn
Patterson said.;    "I don't hold anything against the jury," said Floyd
Patterson who has promised to appeal. "I don't think they understood all the
evidence.";    Taxidermist depicts shootings;  The taxidermist, Kenneth
Oravsky, 45, told jurors that each of the animals was taken in its cage to an
isolated part of the ranch and then shot by a hunter with gun ready standing
about 150 feet away. All of the animals, he testified, were shot less than 100
feet from their cages. One, too tame to leave the enclosure, was dragged out
by a lasso around its neck and shot just outside the door of the cage.;   
Oravsky testified that during the first cat hunt at the ranch, the
hunter-client fainted and had to be revived with CPR before he could fire his
gun and kill the animal.;    Despite the graphic material evidence that the
cats were killed at the mountainous ranch property, prosecutors had a
complicated time constructing a case against the Pattersons. California law
does not specifically prohibit the killing of cats which are not native to the
state. Of the cats shot at the ranch, only the mountain lion is found in
California in the wild. Prosecutors told the jury the Pattersons imported the
other cats through Thurston Comstock, an animal dealer in Arizona.;   
Animals' care regulated;  The care and treatment of exotic animals brought
into the state is strictly regulated, however, through an elaborate permit
process that controls their transportation, confinement and sale. It is on
violations of those laws, as well as injury to California mountain lions, that
the Pattersons were tried.;    "I think we're seeing that people recognize
that we do have a population of endangered species that exists around the
world," said John Foster, a California Fish and Game investigator who worked
with the prosecutor in the case. "I think people recognize that these
populations need safeguards and so we have regulations that try to prevent the
commercial sale of parts of these animals.";    "By no stretch of the
imagination were any of these animals hunted," Foster said. "They were brought
here through a black market, pulled out of their cages and shot.";    Similar
cases in other states;  Scott said the conviction marks the first time in
California such a big-game business has been uncovered and tried. Other cases
have been prosecuted recently in Texas and Oklahoma, he said.;    The attorney
for the Pattersons, I. Singh Aulakh, declined last week to mount a defense,
calling prosecution of the case "inept.";    Monterey County Municipal Court
Judge Alan Hedegard scheduled the Pattersons sentencing for Aug. 2. They face
a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a $1,000 fine on each count.  </TEXT>

COUNTY CONTINUES BAN ON COYOTE JAW TRAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ban on the use of steel-jawed leg traps to catch coyotes that wander too 
close to homes in Topanga Canyon and other rural communities was continued 
Tuesday by Los Angeles County officials. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Mike Antonovich said a six-month experiment by county 
trappers using box traps to catch coyotes without injuring them has been 
inconclusive and must be widened. 
</P>
<P>
Between now and Nov. 30, trappers employed by the county's agricultural 
commissioner will receive special training on how to bait the walk-in cage 
traps and also will be asked to test leg snares that are being used to catch 
coyotes in Canada, Antonovich said. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural Commissioner E. Leon Spaugy ordered the initial half-year cage 
trap experiment in October after a coyote caught in a jaw trap in Topanga 
Canyon chewed its leg off to escape. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, county trappers have failed to catch a single coyote in 
the four walk-in traps they put out in hilly areas the animals roam in search 
of food. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the cages -- which capture coyotes when they step inside to get at food 
bait -- have been damaged by either animals or vandals, officials said. During 
the past six months, trappers would normally have caught up to 60 coyotes in 
leg traps, said Richard Wightman, head of the county's trapping program. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich said the results of the first six-month trial were inconclusive 
"because the traps were not being baited properly and because there wasn't a 
sufficient number of them." He said funding will be made available to purchase 
more cage traps, which cost about $125 each. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles animal control officers will be asked to show the county trappers 
how to use the cage traps, Antonovich said. At the same time, inexpensive leg 
snares that humanely capture coyotes will also be tested, he said. 
</P>
<P>
County trappers will be authorized to use the old-style jaw traps in 
emergencies to catch coyotes that are menacing neighborhoods, Antonovich said. 
The agricultural commissioner's office has about 150 of the leg traps, which 
cost about $5 each. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly public safety is the top priority and the agricultural commissioner 
is free to take whatever steps are necessary when lives are threatened," 
Antonovich said. 
</P>
<P>
The extension of the jaw-trap ban was sought by Lila Brooks, director of a 
Hollywood-based group called California Wildlife Defenders. Her organization 
has pressed for the elimination of such traps for years. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks said cage traps have proven effective when used by trappers who know how 
to properly bait them. She said leg traps have been outlawed in several other 
California counties. 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. County trappers have never used box traps before and do not have the 
skill and experience to catch the target animals," she said.

<TEXT>
   Police firing anesthesia darts to subdue a
lion and a tiger that escaped their circus cage miscalculated the
dosage and killed the animals, the circus manager said.
   Two tigers and two lions escaped Wednesday their cage via an
open door at the Circo Ruso in this northern city while an animal
trainer was rehearsing a new routine with them, manager Angel
Cristo said.
   Cristo said he and several assistants managed to return one of
the tigers to the cage, but the other three animals fled the circus.
   Police found the animals nearby. One of the officers armed with
the darts fired on the animals.
   ``Unfortunately the dose used to put the two lions and the tiger
to sleep was excessive, and two of the animals died from a heart
attack,'' Cristo said.
   The other lion was returned to the circus. No one was injured,
Cristo said.

<HEAD>Savage Says Daughter's Death After Leopard Attack Was Destiny</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An entertainer whose 2-year-old daughter
was mauled to death by a leopard used in his act said Friday that
her death was an act of fate.
   ``We have no choice over life or death,'' Joe Savage said at a
news conference. ``The cage that was involved in this was locked
... how and why this happened is nothing short of mystical.''
   Nikka, daughter of Savage and his girlfriend, Kimberly Wilson,
died of head wounds, blood loss and shock after the attack
Wednesday, doctors said.
   The leopard, Tabu, got out of its cage outside Savage's farm
house in suburban Nashville and mauled the child.
   The cat was tranquilized after the attack and died a short time
later while being taken for a 10-day quarantine to the Tennessee
Wildlife Resources Agency Center.
   ``I think that he (God) protected her from growing up in this
world, this society that is worse than any Amazon jungle,'' Savage
said.
   Savage flew to Nashville Thursday from Las Vegas where he was
performing. He leads a touring rock `n' roll act in which he sings
and performs with pythons and leopards.
   Police said the attack was an accident and didn't anticipate any
charges.
   Savage's older daughter, Julie Saccio, 24, said in a telephone
interview from her home in Charlotte, N.C., that she has taken care
of her father's five leopards occasionally but feared only Tabu.
   Ms. Saccio, who said her father legally changed his name for
show business reasons about 15 years ago, said she took care of the
leopards most recently in January and February.
   ``The black ones (leopards) were pretty tame. It was just Tabu _
my dad raised Tabu with a Rottweiler, and after that dog was killed
in California, that cat went nuts,'' Ms. Saccio said.
   ``My dad was the only one who could get around it.''
   Ms. Saccio said she lives with her mother, Emily Saccio, and
that she has a brother, Joey, also in his 20s.
   Police Chief Joe Casey said authorities think Ms. Wilson left
Nikka outside for a moment while she went into the house, ``and
when she came out, the cat was on the kid.''
   Four other cats also escaped from the cage but police and
wildlife officials herded them back in.
   Ms. Saccio said she didn't know how the cats could have gotten
loose.
   ``The fences were tightly secured. That's why I thought maybe
she (Ms. Wilson) had cleaned the cage or fed them, then left it
unlocked,'' Ms. Saccio said. ``These animals are very smart.
Leopards can turn a knob.''

<LEADPARA>  Two Monterey County ranchers and a taxidermist were accused Tuesday of
illegally importing tigers, leopards and mountain lions to their sprawling
ranch -- then charging people to kill them at close range and take their skins
home as trophies.;    Floyd Lester Patterson III, Dawn Patterson and Kenneth
Oravsky, all of Lockwood, face 38 criminal charges connected with the big game
hunt that Monterey County officials say they ran regularly on their cattle
ranch.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BIG GAME HUNTS ON RANCH ALLEGED
COMPLAINT: ENDANGERED SPECIES IMPORTED, KILLED  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The complaint says people paid up to $3,000 to kill an endangered animal,
which was released from a cage and shot almost immediately.;    District
Attorney Klar Wennerholm of Monterey County said Oravsky, a taxidermist, then
skinned and stuffed the big cats and mounted them for the customers to take
home as trophies. He said customers often bought videotapes of the kill.;   
Federal officials are still looking for a man who they suspect was paid to
smuggle the animals from Arizona, Missouri, Colorado and Mexico. It is a
violation of federal law to deal in tigers, mountain lions and leopards for
profit, and it is against both state and federal law to shoot any of those
animals under most circumstances.;    The complaint says some of the animals
were zoo animals sold when they were too old to be kept on exhibit.;   
Wennerholm said that, from May to July 1990, the three months when he
investigated activity at the ranch, at least nine animals were killed. He said
it is unclear when the shootings began and how long they continued.;    While
most of the customers who came to the ranch have not yet been named,
Wennerholm did release the name of one client: Nicholas Mitchell Miljevich of
Los Gatos. He was charged in a separate complaint with possessing a dead
tiger, leopard and mountain lion.;    Investigators serving a search warrant
on the Patterson ranch in November said they confiscated tiger skulls and
skins as well as photographs and videotapes of the game hunt.;    "I've never
seen anything like that before," said Bob Koch, a California Fish and Game
supervisor who visited the ranch. "I was really surprised that, in this quiet
community, that this kind of thing could happen.";    Hunting is fairly common
on the mountainous cattle ranches of Monterey County -- everything from
squirrels to wild turkeys, pigs and sheep. Some ranchers are licensed as
hunting guides and legally charge people to hunt on their land.;    But,
Wennerholm said, "In the more than 20 years I've been in this job, I've never
seen anything like this. It looks like they just let them out of the cages and
then shot them.";    The three suspects, who could not be reached for comment
Tuesday, are scheduled to be arraigned May 9 in King City Municipal Court. If
convicted, they could face six months in jail and a $5,000 fine.  </TEXT>

   The oom-pah-pah of a tuba and the jangle of a
tambourine were the first clues that things were not quite normal
in the Queens Midtown Tunnel early today.
   Then a police van came out on the Manhattan side with flashing
lights. It braked in front of the more than 100 spectators gathered
along the road and its megaphone crackled to life: ``Do yourself a
favor and don't touch the cages.''
   What brought out the crowd, which ranged from grandmothers to
infants?
   ``Word of trunk,'' one spectator said.
   It was Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus' annual
three-mile parade of animals as the big top moved into Madison
Square Garden for its six-week run.
   The caged lions and tigers came first, 14 of them in two strands
of cages linked together and pulled by trucks. The animals paced
back and forth.
   ``Here pussycat,'' someone in the crowd yelled.
   ``Living things in Manhattan that are not people, and are not
cockroaches!'' yelled Amy Slaton, a 30-year-old art critic. ``This
is the happiest night of my life.''
   The crowd roared as the elephants appeared at the tunnel exit.
Ninteen were linked with long strands of chains, walking mainly two
abreast. The cry went up, ``Wooo-oooo! Elephants! Elephants! AAAAll
Right!''
   Paula Van Meter was wearing an elephant nose and ears in honor
of her sixth trip to the parade.
   ``Sometimes dignitaries get to ride on the elephants,'' the
41-year-old Brooklyn resident said. ``That would be worth running
for office.''
   ``I wish we had a little baby elephant,'' said a child.
   After the elephants came 15 horses, five zebras and six camels.
   The rear was brought up by a Department of Sanitation street
sweeper, busy at work.
   One elephant rider was Richard Dunne, a 37-year-old lawyer from
Baltimore, who said he bought the ride at a charity auction. He
would not say how much he paid, only that it was expensive and
worth the money.
   ``It was like a gigantic horse,'' Dunne said. ``It's so fresh
for New York. Everyone is smiling and happy, even the cops were
happy.''

   The police van's megaphone issued a strange
warning to the crowd of over 100 people hovering around the
Manhattan exit from the Queens Midtown Tunnel early Wednesday.

   Up from under the river came Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey

   A former New Yorker living here was astonished
when a Denver policeman showed up at his front door, apologized and
ripped up a four-point traffic citation he had issued just a day
earlier.
   ``In New York, this just doesn't happen. I couldn't believe
it,'' said Joe Milotta, 34.
   But the action by Patrolman Glen Miller, an eight-year veteran,
didn't surprise Deputy Chief Cliff Stanley.
   ``He has, on more than one occasion, admitted his mistakes,''
Stanley said. ``Police officers are human and we do admit our
mistakes. In fact, we encourage it.''
   Miller said he mistook Milotta's car for a similar vehicle that
used an emergeny lane to avoid morning rush-hour traffic on March 9.

   Rush County farmer Andy Ariens has a
built-in barometer so accurate it has earned him a countywide
reputation as an ace weather prognosticator.
   ``I told Trudy before we got married, `Now, there's something
you need to understand about me,''' said Ariens, 56. `` `Whenever
there's a storm on the way, I'll go off to bed and I'll just sleep
right through it. I may sleep all afternoon and all night long if
you let me.'''
   Ariens also reads the winds and watches the behavior of animals
and insects to predict Mother Nature's plans. He said if he sees an
ant cover its hole or if cows refuse to graze, he knows it is going
to rain.
   Neighbors say Ariens has a 90 percent accuracy rate. He
correctly predicted the ice storm that coated central Indiana March
3.
   So what's his forecast?
   ``In two weeks, we'll have above-normal temperatures, say around
the first of April,'' Ariens said recently. ``It'll be a wetter
spring than last year, so planting season should be a little
later.''
   The last two weeks of spring will be quite cool with below
normal temperatures, he added.

FT  13 JUN 94 / Cages 'cause extreme suffering' to battery hens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Battery cages cause extreme suffering to egg-laying hens, a government
adviser on animal health has found after a wide-ranging review of scientific
evidence.
Mr Mike Baxter, director of Brunel University's Design Centre, concluded
that hens suffer in a number of ways by not being able to perform natural
functions in very small cages. His report, published today, is likely to add
to pressure on the government to restrict battery farming.
Groups such as the animal welfare society the RSPCA have long campaigned for
battery farming to be banned. About 85 per cent - or 40m - of Britain's
egg-laying hens are kept in battery cages. Last month the Commons
agriculture committee in a report on the poultry industry concluded that a
ban on battery cages would not be a realistic propo-sition.
The committee said: 'Non-cage systems have their own welfare drawbacks and
any wholesale switch to alternative systems would not necessarily enhance
the overall welfare of laying hens.'
The government says it is pushing Brussels to review European Union rules on
battery hens. New regulations come into force in January, increasing the
amount of space each hen must have from 450 sq cm to 600 sq cm.
The egg industry has said that the costs of any further changes in the
regulations would be too great a burden.
Mr Baxter, who sits on the government's Farm Animal Welfare Council, says in
his report in The Veterinary Record that hens are unable to perform natural
nesting functions in a wire mesh cage. There is nowhere for them to perch,
they cannot indulge in dust-bathing or foraging and their bones are weakened
by lack of movement.
The Farm Animal Welfare Council was set up by the government in 1979 as an
independent body to advise on legislation. The council has not yet made any
official recommendations on battery hens.

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 127-pound orangutan escaped from its
cage by unscrewing four large bolts.
   Visitors at Kansas City Zoo's Great Ape House screamed, but no
one was hurt during the animal's brief dash to freedom Wednesday,
zoo officials said.
   ``You've got all these women pushing kids in strollers trying to
get out of there,'' said Beth Cooper, who was in the building with
her husband and two toddlers. ``It was kind of funny.''
   The zoo's public relations director, Jori Glazer, said no one was
injured and the female orangutan, named Cheyenne, was only out of
her glass cage about 20 minutes. The 18-year-old ape, who's been
caged since 1983, was tranquilized by a veterinarian and back in her
cage Wednesday evening.
   Mrs. Cooper said about a dozen people were in the ape house when
they noticed Cheyenne prodding at the window of her cage.
   ``She unscrewed the bolts and just pushed the glass away,'' Mrs.
Cooper said. ``She must have been working on it quite awhile to get
them out. They are huge bolts.''
   Mrs. Glazer such an escape had never occurred before at the
30-year-old circular ape house. She said Cheyenne was never out of
zoo keepers' sights and no one was in danger, adding:
   ``Of course, we moved all the people to the other side of the
zoo. With any wild animal, you never know.''

   A different kind of animal prowled the streets of
New York City in the wee hours today.
   At 1 a.m., the first stage of the procession emerged from the
Queens-Midtown Tunnel onto the dark streets of Manhattan.
   First came the police cars with their flashing lights. Then came
the tigers.
   In cages.
   ``That one was big,'' exclaimed Manhattanite Anita Nirenberg.
``Can you imagine scooping that litter box?''
   About 75 people gathered in the cold clear night and cheered as
the circus came to town.
   ``Ooh'' they said, and ``Aahh.'' And ``Uh oh'' as the odd empty
tiger cage passed.
   The Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus animals travel by
train to Queens, then march through the tunnel and across Manhattan
to Madison Square Garden. Trucks pull the tiger cages.
   The procession included about 20 elephants, some with riders and
many linked trunk-to-tail. Next came teams of prancing white horses
and a pair of camels, then pairs of llamas and black ponies.
   One of the parade spectators, Jackie Markland, said she journeyed
all the way from the eastern tip of Long Island but doubted she'd
buy a ticket to see the real show.
   ``I actually don't like the circus,'' she said.

CAT 'RESCUER' MAY GET JAIL IN FREEING OF 45 FELINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Todd Vailette, according to Lancaster authorities, is a brand-new kind of cat 
burglar. 
</P>
<P>
They're accusing him of burgling cats. 
</P>
<P>
Vailette illegally let the cat out of the bag -- actually, about 45 cats -- on 
the night of Nov. 6, when he turned loose the feline inmates from more than 16 
cages at the Antelope Valley Animal Care Shelter, alleged Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Sheilah Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
He was familiar with the shelter, having spent several weeks working there in 
October as court-mandated community service in lieu of a fine for a traffic 
infraction, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Vailette was found on the premises with a kitten on his shoulder after the 
cages were opened, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Vailette neither admitted nor denied the break-in in an interview Thursday. But 
he said that while working at the shelter, he was disturbed by the conditions 
in which the cats lived, especially the feral cats -- those classified as wild. 
They were kept 10 to 12 in a cage, and when they were fed, "only the big cats 
got to eat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is not a member of any animal rights group, but has saved cats from 
harm in the past. A year and a half ago, he rescued a cat from pit bulldogs 
that were killing other cats, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said Vailette -- who faces six misdemeanor charges including grand 
theft, trespassing and interfering with an officer -- could face up to a year 
in jail if convicted. She noted that those convicted of petty theft in Antelope 
Valley courts routinely receive a minimum of two days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"Up here, we don't just give them a fine and say bye-bye," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts is scheduled to be arraigned Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Shelter manager Dan Sturkie said that although Vailette may have wanted to help 
the cats, "he didn't do them any favor." His act will cause more cats to suffer 
in the end by leading to the births of more feral kittens, Sturkie said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Vailette also inconvenienced shelter personnel, now burdened with 
trying to hunt down the escaped cats. 
</P>
<P>
So far, they've found only six.

   When her husband suggested the family could use more cash,
Janice Henke got herself a job _ trapping skunks.
   ``When I come in from an unsuccessful skunk expedition, my
husband won't let me come in the house unless I take off every
stitch, including my sneakers, and hang them in the tree,'' says
Mrs. Henke, who lives far enough outside of Glens Falls, N.Y., that
there are no neighbors nearby.
   Then it's into a shower and ``I leave my clothes outside for a
week or so.''
   Most of the skunks live through the ordeal and only about one in
20 takes a shot at her with its personal perfume, she says.
   As both a licensed wildlife rehabilitator and licensed nuisance
wildlife agent, she must first decide which situation applies when
a potential customer calls.
   ``You have to decide who's distressed. Is it the people or the
creature?'' she says. ``Generally, it's the people.''
   The animal is in distress if it can't get away.
   If the animal could leave if it wanted to, but doesn't care to
just now, it's the people who are in distress.
   If it's the people who are distressed, the cost is $25 per skunk.
   Normally, it's a simple matter of setting a box trap outside the
hole the skunk is using to get under a building or through a fence.
But there are exceptions.
   ``The lady called me in a panic because, she said, `there's a
skunk in my washing machine,''' Mrs. Henke says. ``I'd never had
that before.''
   The skunk apparently fell into the machine after climbing
through a basement window broken by the woman's children.
   Skunks are a major problem in upstate New York where they are
attracted to man's warm dwellings and groomed lawns,'' said Mrs.
Henke in an interview during this year's North American Wildlife
and Natural Resources Conference in Denver. She is a lobbyist for
the National Trappers Association and executive vice president of
Furbearers Unlimited.
   As winter approaches, skunks begin to den up and sometimes a
dozen or more will hole up under a house or mobile home.
   Disputes among skunks are settled in a manner that leaves a very
unpleasant aroma for the homeowner above.
   Mrs. Henke uses a wire box trap, ``which is pretty good sized,
so when the animal considers entering it, it won't touch his sides
or back. I used a Twix bar for bait, caramel flavor.''
   Next morning, if the homeowner finds an occupied trap ``I'll
come with my skunk blanket.''
   It's an ``old yellow blanket'' with a hole in it so she can
watch the animal while she moves up on it, holding the blanket up
so it can't see a human.
   Some skunks react aggressively to the approaching blanket,
stamping their front paws.
   She waits, then lowers the blanket over the cage, ``figuring if
he's going to spray he's going to do it now or never.''
   Then she wraps the cage in the blanket, places the package in
the back of the pickup truck and takes it to a spot on state land
where ``hopefully there aren't any houses around.''
   ``Then I uncover the end of the cage, remove the door, and if he
doesn't come out by himself, I pick the cage up and give him a
heave-ho, and he rolls over and gets up and trundles off through
the woods.''
   While buildings, with such things as warm water pipes, are a
source of comfort, lawns are a source of food. Lawns are full of
grubs, primarily the larvae of June bugs and Japanese beetles, she
says.
   ``They hunt those by smell and they dig and it looks like a lawn
has been ravaged by a pick of hogs if the skunk has been really
industrious,'' she says.
   Then, it's time for the wire trap and old yellow blanket.

<TEXT>
   David Shepherdson's job is to take the boredom out
of life for the animals at the London Zoo, putting something more
into their day than sleeping, eating and watching humans.
   He has piped gibbon music into the the gibbon cage.
   For the mongooses, he has provided pieces of hollow wood filled
with crickets for the animals to try to catch. ``Cricket
dispensers,'' he calls them.
   He plans a light-and-sound show for the orangutans.
   The lanky 28-year-old Englishman, whose doctoral thesis had him
tracking wild badgers by radio at night, became behavioral
enrichment officer six months ago at the London Zoo, the first
British zoo to have one.
   Believing a little work for the animals is healthy, too,
Shepherdson is making some species work for their dinners.
   ``Zoos should show the animal as it behaves in the wild,'' he
said. ``For example, in the wild, most species spend more than 50
percent of their time foraging for food. ... In the zoo, they get
fed once a day.
   ``You have a choice _ either change the environment, or you
don't keep the animals properly.''
   Trevor Paul, director of research at the Universities Federation
for Animal Welfare, the independent body co-sponsoring
Shepherdson's post, says the project also works well for people who
visit the zoo.
   ``There isn't a great deal of point in them seeing an animal
sitting in a corner behind bars,'' he said.
   He and Shepherdson say that while zoos in many countries are
making cages more natural, few have spent much time studying animal
behavior in relation to their habitats.
   The 161-year-old London Zoo's gibbon monkeys never did much
loafing in their tree-lined outdoor enclosure, but with the change
in their zoo habitat they've become much more feisty.
   Gibbons usually have one mate for life and assert their
territory by singing. London Zoo's pair weren't as musical as they
should have been until Shepherdson hung stereo speakers near their
cage and played taped gibbon duets twice a day.
   Thinking they have neighbors, the gibbons now sing, too.
   Shepherdson is also working on a computer keyboard to produce
sounds, food or even slide shows when orangutans operate it.
   Paul said an electronic organ failed to excite the apes, ``so
we'll try to get a keyboard which does more things than produce
sound.''
   Simple toys, often involving food, are best for most animals,
Shepherdson said.
   He had praise for Hal Markowitz, a U.S. behavioral enrichment
pioneer who installed a machine to toss meatballs into a serval's
cage, but added that he believes more naturalistic tools should be
explored.
   Recently Shepherdson equipped the ring-tailed lemurs' cage with
poles that sway like the trees in the primates' native Madagascar.
   Paul said one of the best ways to simulate natural behavior ``is
to make an animal work for its food (and) spend normal amounts of
time foraging.''
   In the kinkajous' cage, carrots, bananas and apples hang from
the ceiling, some tantalizingly out of reach for the weasel-like
creatures.
   Before getting the snacks, the female paced for hours _ one of
the first signs of boredom, said Shepherdson, watching as she
pursued a banana just beyond nose-reach.
   ``Even tortoises pace, I'm told,'' Shepherdson added. ``It's not
a lack of space, it's what you have in that space that's
important.''
   After a cage is outfitted, zoo workers watch the animals for
hours to see how they respond.
   ``In every case so far, there's been a beneficial effect,'' said
Shepherdson. ``If every zoo in the country did these things, it
would be a great step forward in animal welfare.''

<HEAD>Moscow Circus Accused of Mistreating Its Performing Bears</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Toronto Humane Society claims the famed
Moscow Circus is mistreating its performing bears by confining them
in small cages and on Monday it threatened court action.
   David Bain, a Humane Society investigator, said the 12 brown
bears are being psychologically mistreated by being held in cages
measuring about 3 feet by 4{ feet.
   He said the society will file a complaint accusing the circus of
cruelty to animals if it doesn't provide larger cages or better
treatment by Wednesday.
   Arthur Fogel, a promoter of the Soviet company's tour that
includes shows in New York City next month, said the bears are
``treated great'' and the Humane Society was misleading the public.
   Fogel, of Concert Productions International, said the bears are
excercised daily and Bain's contention that they are confined up to
16 hours a day ``is totally inaccurate.''
   He said the bears are raised by their Soviet trainers from birth
and are in excellent health. ``I'm glad the trainers can't
understand English,'' he added. ``If they heard what is being said
about their bears they'd be very upset.''
   Bain said the bears' daily training routines, in which they walk
on their front legs and ride bicycles, are not adequate exercise
for the animals, which weigh from about 195 to 300 pounds.
   He said the bears ``are suffering from severe behaviorial
problems'' because of the psychological strain of confinement.
   The circus begins a three-week run Wednesday at the Canadian
National Exhibition in Toronto, with the bears performing once or
twice a day.
   Bain also criticized the circus for its treatment of a pregnant
Siberian tiger shipped to Canada. He said the animal gave birth
during a 15-day sea voyage from the Soviet Union to Montreal.
   Circus manager Ted Thrasher said the tiger was transported by
sea because it would have been traumatized had it been moved by
airplane.
   Bain insisted the tiger should not have been moved at all.
   He said the other animals in the circus appeared to be healthy.

<HEAD>Zoo Keeper Recovering After Mauling by Leopard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A zoo keeper who screamed ``help me! help
me!'' after a 70-pound Persian leopard bit his neck was up and
about Wednesday, a day after the attack, a hospital spokeswoman
said.
   Alan Feinberg, 41, was in fair condition at San Francisco
General Hospital, where doctors stitched up his wounds, said the
spokeswoman, Gloria Rodriquez.
   It was the second attack by an animal at the zoo this year.
   Zoo officials were investigating why the female leopard, named
Fatima, attacked Feinberg, a zoo keeper for 18 years. Zoo director
David Anderson said the 14-year-old leopard may have attacked as
the keeper reached into the cage for a bone.
   Feinberg was standing in the keeper's area of the cage when the
attack occurred. He had apparently opened the gate that separates
the keeper's area from the exhibit area, Anderson said, making it
possible for the animal to attack. The gate to the exhibit area is
supposed to remain closed.
   ``Keepers are never supposed to be in there,'' he said. ``Maybe
he thought the animals weren't in there.''
   The mauling took place as a group of schoolchildren watched.
   ``The leopard had him by the neck and wouldn't let go until the
other keeper came and poked him,'' said Berry Accius, 15, of San
Rafael.
   ``I thought the leopard was going to kill him,'' said Othon
Franco, also 15 and from San Rafael. ``He was screaming, `Help me!
Help me! Get him off! Get him off!'''
   Senior zoo keeper Tony Colonese, alerted by a visitor, ran to
the cage and poked the leopard with a shovel until the animal
released Feinberg. Other keepers pulled the injured man from the
cage.
   A spokesman for the zoo said it was investigating the attack.
Veterinarians examining Fatima found only superficial wounds,
probably caused by the shovel.
   Contacted at the hospital, Feinberg refused to comment.
   In February, a keeper's back was fractured when he was knocked
into a moat by a 7,000-pound elephant.

   Federal indictments unsealed Friday
charged 170 people as members of a huge, international drug ring
linked to Panama's Manuel Noriega that dealt in more than $1
billion worth of marijuana and cocaine.
   Noriega was not charged in the indictments, which disclosed that
that the Panamanian strongman allegedly laundered profits from the
sale of marijuana shipped to a Louisiana shipyard.
   ``This organization is sophisticated, well orchestrated and
rivals any multinational corporation,'' U.S. Attorney Joe Cage
said. ``Its sole motivation, greed and money, caused its scope and
influence to transcend local, national and international
boundaries.''
   Cage said the indictments resulted from the same federal
investigation that led to Noriega's indictment in Florida on
charges of laundering U.S. drug money through Panamanian banks.
   If Noriega had not been indicted already in Florida, ``in my
opinion, there would have been sufficient evidence for an
indictment'' here, said Judith Lombardino, lawyer for the federal
Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force.
   Cage said the widespread, 2{-year-old federal investigation
extended into Florida, North Carolina and Michigan.
   The indictment alleges that 170 people conspired to import
nearly 1.5 million pounds of marijuana into the country. Of the
170, more than 100 also are accused of traveling to Lafayette to
arrange the importation of 280,000 pounds of marijuana.
   Cage said 500,000 pounds of marijuana was imported to and
distributed from Lafayette and several thousand pounds of cocaine
was flown to Shreveport.
   The Louisiana investigation centered to a large extent on
shipments of marijuana believed to have been unloaded at the
Intracoastal Drydock and Shipbuilding Co. on the Vermilion River
near the town of Bancker, La.
   The federal grand jury charged Abbeville, La., residents William
E. Faciane and James C. Faciane, both employees of the family owned
shipyard with importing 500,000 pounds of marijuana to the Bancker
site.
   Noriega is alleged to have laundered profits from the sale of
280,000 pounds of marijuana shipped there, the indictment alleges.
   Cage refused to comment on any details of Noriega's alleged
involvement with the drug ring or whether Colombia's Medellin
Cartel was involved. In a federal indictment handed up Feb. 4 in
Miami, Noriega was charged with taking protection money from the
cartel.
   Cage would not identify any of those indicted as ringleaders,
nor would he pinpoint a headquarters for the drug ring.
   ``Each and every individual named in the indictment allegedly
played a vital role in the success of this organization. There is
no such thing as a minimal role in planning and executing a network
of this size.''
   Many of those charged in the 131-page indictment were identified
as ``John Doe.''
   Among those indicted are several foreign nationals believed to
be involved in the systematic trafficking of marijuana and cocaine.
They include David Arrana, Cesar Cura, Vanderbilt Bowie Davis,
Lucio Cardona, all of Colombia;
   Edward ``Gill'' Bodden of the Cayman Islands; Felice Napolitano
of Panama; Ed Whyte, a Canadian citizen living in Jamaica; and
Carlos Zayas-Castro of Colombia and the Cayman Islands.
   Cage said several arrests have been made, but he refused to say
how many.
   He said the federal government's Organized Crime Drug
Enforcement Task Force headed up the investigation, code named
``The Bulldog.''
   The investigation resulted in the indictment of at least 82
other people in the federal judicial districts in North Carolina,
Florida and Michigan.

<HEAD>Research Animals Freed From Cages at University</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP)  Hundreds of mice, rats and hamsters used
for research were released from their cages at the state University
of New York at Buffalo Medical School, but no animal rights group
claimed responsibility.
   The animals were found scampering around five rooms Saturday
morning by a technician arriving for work, said school spokeswoman
Linda Grace-Kobas.
   ``They opened the cages, and the mice and the rats (and
hamsters) got out of the cages, but they did not escape from the
rooms,'' she said.
   There were no signs of a break-in or indication why the animals
were released.
   ``Usually animal rights people leave a message,'' she said.
``There were no notes. No `Save the Animals.' This was strange. It
seemed random. It seemed pointless.''
   University officials were trying to determine what effect the
animals' release will have on research projects in which they were
used, she said.
   ``By letting them out, it disrupts the experiments,'' she said,
adding that some of the experiments are based on the animals being
in a closed enviroment.
   Also, since not all the animals were tagged, researchers may not
be able to determine which animals belonged to what experiments.

<HEAD>After 27 Years: Steppin' Out with Zoo Atlanta's Famous Gorilla</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto upcoming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Willie B. found it's a jungle out there.
   Zoo Atlanta's famous gorilla saw something Friday he hasn't seen
since he was captured in Africa 27 years ago: green grass beneath
his feet and open sky above his head.
   As reporters and photographers watched from behind trees and
across a protective moat, the 30-year-old lowland gorilla stepped
hesitantly into his new outdoor quarters, a $4.5 million simulated
rain forest where he will live near 13 other gorillas and a host of
other apes.
   Skeptical of those watching him, he spent almost an hour
stepping back and forth from his enclosed shelter before he seemed
secure enough to run atop his hill, scamper for food and begin
ripping down tree limbs.
   ``I think he has responded well. He came through. He seems to be
enjoying his environment,'' beaming Zoo Atlanta Director Terry
Maple said.
   Last month, Willie B. was moved from his tile-walled,
steel-barred cage _ his home since he arrived at the zoo in 1961 _
into the new indoor quarters he will use for sleep and shelter.
   After five weeks to grow accustomed to the enclosure, with his
keeper of 14 years often sleeping nearby to keep him company, he
was allowed to roam free. Zoo officials don't know if he can
remember being outdoors.
   In a physical last month, Willie weighed in at 460 pounds, about
60 pounds overweight, but not too bad after 25 years in a cage,
Maple said.
   For now, Willie will live in an area of his own, adjacent to
three ``families'' of gorillas on loan from Emory University's
Yerkes Primate Research Center. They're all separated to prevent
fights. Zoo officials hope that within a year, he can be introduced
to another gorilla _ probably a female, with whom they hope he'll
breed.
   The new exhibit, according to Zoo Atlanta officials, is the most
advanced gorilla habitat at any zoo. Named the Ford African Rain
Forest and built with $1 million from the automaker, it's the
latest stage in a $26 million renovation at the 99-year-old zoo.
   The exhibit will open to the public June 11.
   Just four years ago, the U.S. Humane Society named the zoo one
of the nation's worst. The U.S. Department of Agriculture slapped
sanctions on the zoo for poor record-keeping on animal care. The
deaths of star animals made national headlines and political
turmoil gripped the city-owned attraction.
   In 1985, Maple, a Georgia Tech animal behavior specialist who
helped turn around the New Orleans zoo, was named director, and
operations were handed to a non-profit agency. Maple took to
calling Zoo Atlanta ``the world's next great zoo,'' and proceeded
to convert the old facility into a modern, natural animal habitat.
   ``It's a great day for Zoo Atlanta,'' Maple said.``As of this
moment we have arrived as a big-league zoo.
   Plans call for a complete renovation by 1991, with animals
roaming in natural habitats rather than cages.
   As for Willie B., Friday was not his first time in the
limelight. In 1981 an Atlanta TV station handed him a suitcase to
recreate a popular luggage commercial which showed an ape bashing _
but not breaking _ the product.
   Willie ripped the leather cover off the suitcase, ripped the two
sides apart from the hinges, filled one half with water and drank
from it.

RULING THE ROOST;

BUSINESS STARTED ON A WING AND A PRAYER NOW FEATHERS HIS NEST

<P>
Owners of pet birds no longer need to feel guilty about keeping their feathered 
friends in cramped quarters. All it takes is $4,000 or so to give the creatures 
room to spread their wings and a leisurely life of luxury. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Jim Durant, some birds have been flying their old crowded coops into 
roomier, better-appointed cages -- up to 40 feet tall -- made of solid brass 
and copper, some trimmed with marble and beveled glass. 
</P>
<P>
His Santa Ana-based firm, James Durant Aviaries, is a leading maker of 
world-class bird cages. Among the avian cognoscenti, Durant is to bird cages 
what Godiva is to chocolates. 
</P>
<P>
The cages are sold to such customers as the Hilton Hawaiian Village, the Hyatt 
Regency Macau in Hong Kong and just plain folks. Well, maybe not so plain -- 
Durant could be called cage-maker to the stars. His customer list includes a 
rock star or two, an oil mogul in Kuwait, and actors Chevy Chase and Patrick 
Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
Working out of a cramped shop piled high with half-built bird cages, feeders 
and brass pedestals, Durant controls the business from concept to delivery. 
With the help of two assistants -- sometimes more, depending on his backlog -- 
Durant takes from 30 hours to several months to produce any of his 13 standard 
models or to custom-design something even more spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has made cages as small as 10 by 12 inches, Durant is best known 
for his large creations, such as the cage he designed for the Hyatt Regency in 
Chicago. The 40-foot-tall cage measures 17 feet in diameter and will cost in 
the low six figures. 
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to deluxe cages, size is not the only reason that Durant 
rules the roost. Creature comforts include solid brass ladders or swings, 
hand-formed feed cups and cast legs on the brass and copper bases. 
</P>
<P>
Even with price tags that match what some people pay for a car, Durant's 
customers keep flocking to his establishment. He estimated that he sells 100 to 
150 cages a year for an average price of $3,200 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
A diminutive eccentric who wears a queue, Durant is nonchalant about why his 
business has taken off. "A lot of times, people just want something special," 
he said. "Some people hunger for quality in everyday products." 
</P>
<P>
Customers with that appetite are like Gloria Allen, a San Francisco-area bird 
breeder, who has five Durant cages. Her assortment includes a model that's 
Durant's piece de resistance -- an eight-foot-tall, seven-foot-wide custom cage 
with a beveled glass top and drawers of jade marble that match the marble in 
Allen's fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
After plunking down roughly $14,000 for the cage, Allen said Durant's prices 
are "absolutely awful. But if you're a person who cares to attire your home 
with only the best, what you want is a Jim Durant cage. He has no imitators -- 
there is no finer-quality cage." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, when Durant started building cages, he had no idea that 
anyone but him gave a hoot about what their pet cages looked like. A civil 
engineer, Durant indirectly got into the cage business in 1970 when a friend 
gave him a parrot. When he could not find a cage he liked, he began building 
one himself. 
</P>
<P>
Durant spent about a year welding together brass and copper before he finished 
the six-foot-tall cage. "I wanted it to be perfect," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
He showed his creation to the local pet store, which asked him to make two for 
them to use in the shop. Within two weeks, the cages flew out the door -- one 
for $250 and a considerably larger one for $500. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Durant's business advisers told him the idea of a bird cage business 
was, well, for the birds. What they had not figured was that some veterinarians 
and avian authorities estimate that there may be up to 200 million pet birds 
nationally -- nearly double the combined number of cats and dogs. 
</P>
<P>
By 1974, Durant had started his business on a wing and a prayer. But within a 
few years, the business really took off, after a friend persuaded Durant to run 
an ad in Architectural Digest. 
</P>
<P>
The exposure gave Durant instant access to high-income shoppers and interior 
designers, who thought his product was just the thing to show off such rare 
birds as macaws and cockateels. 
</P>
<P>
The uniqueness of Durant's merchandise is the sort of thing that can make you 
want to buy a bird. In fact, that's exactly what Patrick Duffy, the "Dallas" 
star did. A while back, when Duffy ordered his cage from a catalogue, he did 
not realize that the cage -- intended for his small bird -- was actually 
designed to fit a giant parrot. 
</P>
<P>
"He ended up leaving his little bird in the same cage," Durant said, "and went 
out and bought a parrot to go in mine."

   A 16-month-old boy strapped into a car seat
was mauled to death by a 200-pound leopard that escaped from its
cage at the family's farm, authorities said.
   The child's grandmother had left the car door open after a
shopping trip Friday.
   ``She had carried a couple of packages into the house and
returned to get the child,'' said Ronnie Huntley, chief investigator
with the sheriff's department. ``That's when the leopard made its
attack.''
   ``The grandmother fought the leopard off,'' then drove the boy to
the hospital, he said.
   The child, Holden Brown-Cline, died at Chesterfield General
Hospital, officials said. The grandmother, Wilma Cline, was treated
for minor cuts.
   The boy's parents, Bob and De'Ann Cline, were in Pennsylvania on
Friday. They keep 12 lions and other big cats at their farm, and
take them to fairs and malls throughout the Southeast.
   Officials were unsure how the animal escaped, but Huntley said it
appeared the animal may have simply pushed against its cage enough
to bend the lock and escape.
   Huntley said officials tried to keep the animal cornered until
representatives from a zoo in Columbia could arrive and sedate the
animal. Cheraw is 80 miles northeast of Columbia.
   But the animal tried to flee, leading Chesterfield County Sheriff
Ralph Freeman to order it shot and killed, Huntley said.
   Freeman said they will investigate the death before deciding
whether to file charges.
   But Huntley said authorities were aware of the animals and had
checked on the situation before.
   ``It's appeared from our past observation that the animals were
well taken care of,'' he said. ``These folks are trainers and this
is just one of those unfortunate freak accidents.''

<HEAD>Colossus Steps Out For First Time In 20 Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An ape billed as the world's largest
lowland gorilla in captivity got its first look at the outside
world since it was captured as an infant 20 years ago.
   ``He's never really had the wind in his face, the rain in his
face, the sun on him in 20 years,'' said Pat Quinn, director of The
Zoo.
   Colossus, estimated to weigh at least 550 pounds, moved
cautiously and clutched a security blanket in his powerful hands
Friday as he ventured from his cage into an outdoor enclosure.
   The 6-foot, 2-inch ape never strayed more than a few feet from
the cage door for the first hour, but soon was roaming throughout
the 6,000-square-foot pen.
   The lumbering gorilla pounded his fist against the 1\-inch-thick
glass enclosing the observation area, causing spectators to recoil.
One woman was so stunned she dropped her camera.
   Until he was moved here Sunday, Colossus had spent nearly all
his life in a 240-square-foot indoor cage at Benson's Animal Park
in Hudson, N.H. The Zoo bought him for $37,800 at auction when
Benson's closed last October, but he remained there until the new
facilities could be built.
   Colossus was brought Sunday to The Zoo but kept inside until
Friday so he could become accustomed to his new suite of two
adjoining cages before being reintroduced to the outdoors.
   When the door to his cage was opened, Colossus clutched his
blanket for security and peeked out several times before extending
his right hand through the opening.
   He did this several times, putting one arm out and then both,
before he finally climbed out. Then he withdrew several more times
into the cage.
   ``Come on, son, come see me,'' Quinn shouted.
   At one point, the ape bent over to smell the grass just outside
his door before bounding back inside.
   ``He doesn't know what it is,'' Quinn said. ``He's figuring out
what this new texture is under his feet.''
   In New Hampshire, the gorilla never felt anything underfoot
except concrete and steel, said Quinn.
   The Zoo plans to breed Colossus. But first the giant ape will
have to learn how to behave like a gorilla _ he has not seen
another member of his species since his capture, Quinn said.
   Quinn said he wants to obtain another bachelor male or a
non-productive female as a mentor for Colossus before selecting a
mate.

<LEADPARA>  Charlotte Sandquist unhooks the leather leash she keeps slung around her
shoulder and enters a cinder block kennel at the Humane Society of Santa Clara
Valley. She's greeted by a symphony of barks and howls, and the dogs in the
first few pens perk up and follow her with their eyes.;   But these aren't the
dogs she's come for.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     She passes them by and finally stops at cage 104, where dog number 220160
wags his tail and gives Sandquist a raspy bark.;   This is the part of the job
Sandquist hates.;   The animal, a black Australian cattle dog who was picked
up a week before, has already overstayed his welcome. Most strays without ID
only get three days.;   Now it's decision time, or as Sandquist calls it, time
to "play God.";   Should this dog live or die?;   Around 27,000 dogs and cats
are euthanized at the shelter every year, and once or twice a week it's
Sandquist's job to decide which ones will be next.;   "I never thought I'd
have to make decisions like this. It doesn't feel right," said Sandquist, who
has worked at the humane society for over a year. "Sometimes you don't think
about it and sometimes you do think about it. The times you think about it is
when it's tough.";   Sandquist leads the dog into the shot clinic, where
she'll check his health and temperament. The test is important: If he passes,
the dog will be put up for adoption. If not, he'll be given a lethal dose of
sodium pentobarbital.;   This used to be a full-time position, Sandquist said
as she checked her patient's gums and then began to take his temperature. The
burnout rate got to be so high, though, that the job is now rotated among four
adoption counselors.;   "If you're in here every single day doing this, you
get really worn down," she said. "I couldn't do this every day. It would
desensitize you -- either that or you'd go insane.";   The dog has a high
temperature, something Sandquist had suspected. Back in his cage she had
noticed him barking hoarsely, as if he had a sore throat.;   These are signs
that the dog probably has kennel cough -- a generic name for a variety of
airborne respiratory diseases commonly transmitted in kennels. Although the
cough is easy and inexpensive to cure, Sandquist said the shelter doesn't have
the space or money to care for every dog who contracts it.;   "This is what's
hard," she said, slipping her patient a couple of biscuits, which he gobbles
down in seconds. "I know that with just a little bit of medicine this dog
would be fine. But a healthy dog could take his place. Instead of putting a
sick dog up for adoption, even though it's treatable, we can put a healthy dog
in his cage.";   Sandquist once again reaches for the leather leash and leads
dog number 220160 back to his concrete cage where, for the next hour or so, he
can stare through his wire fence at the terrier snoozing across the aisle, or
bark hoarsely with the other dogs he hears all around him.;   Then it's off to
"E.R.," the euthanasia room.;   "It smells like death," Sandquist said of the
euthanasia room. "That's the first thing, the biggest thing, that you notice.;
  "Once they get out there, they definitely know (what's going to happen). You
can just see it by the way they react.";   Sometimes, she said, her decisions
on who lives and who dies has nothing to do with health or temperament. Often
there's just not enough room to house all of the 38,000 animals that arrive at
the shelter throughout the year.;   Some of these Sandquist can't get out of
her mind. Like the droopy-eared cocker spaniel puppies that came in several
months ago. They were perfectly healthy, "gorgeous" dogs, she said, but she
had to walk them back to E.R.;   "We weren't allowed to put puppies into
adoption then. That was the only reason," she said. "That made me cry.
Perfectly beautiful animals.";   Sandquist figures she's hardened a bit since
then. Although when her day is done she still takes home sadness, the stress
of her job often manifests itself in anger instead of tears. Sometimes she
finds herself irritated by little things, or snapping at someone for no good
reason, she said.;   On her first day of work she was a wreck, Sandquist
remembers.;   "I hated it. I told everybody, 'I can't ever do that again. I
don't want to make that decision, I don't want to be the one.' ";   With time,
though, she decided she couldn't lay the responsibility on anyone else.;   Her
stress also emerges as anger toward people who think Humane Society employees
don't care about animals, or that they get some sort of pleasure out of
euthanizing them.;   But Sandquist, 27, doesn't fit the description of such a
monster. She's an active, single woman, whose short blond hair and blue eyes
convey her Swedish citizenship. After graduating from Penn State a year ago
with a double major in Spanish and international relations, she moved to San
Jose, where she lives with her two cats and her boyfriend.;   Despite the sad
parts of her job, she sees a good side.;   The good side is finding just the
right owner for just the right cat, or bending the rules occasionally and
getting the county vet to treat an animal, even though its time is supposed to
be up.;   "I make up for having to send that one dog down by doing something
positive in another area," she said.;   Earlier that morning, Sandquist was
checking an orange tabby named Hubcap who'd been surrendered by its owner the
day before. The cat's profile, provided by the previous owners, said they were
giving him up because he scratched a child. That's one point against adoption,
Sandquist said.;   But now he's being very cooperative, letting Sandquist
check his teeth without too much protest, and responding with purrs to
Sandquist's gentle voice and touch.;   Often, she'll stay with an animal in
the E.R. and hold it while it's injected, to help them through it, she said.; 
 "This is my kind of cat," she said of the orange tabby who has now jumped
from the exam table and onto the counter. "Big, male, really friendly. If
there was something wrong with it I'd probably go to my supervisor" and ask
for special treatment.;   Sandquist makes a note on the cat's paperwork,
saying it doesn't do well with children, and then puts him into a fresh cage
in the adoptable cat room. This one will have two more weeks worth of chances.
These are moments that make the job easier, she said.;   "In a way this job is
a nice change of pace," she said. "In here, I really have close contacts with
the animals. It's tough to have to play God, but since the majority of them
get put up for adoption, that outweighs the bad."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Coach Bails Out Man Who Threatened to Loose Tiger</HEAD>

   A man who threatened to loose a
500-pound Bengal tiger on the Louisiana State University campus
unless given a job ``snapped'' and deserves compassion, the
school's basketball coach said Thursday.
   Coach Dale Brown signed a $10,000 bail bond to free from jail
Moacyr ``Gato'' Cezar, who locked himself in the outer cage of the
LSU mascot for more than four hours Wednesday. Cezar, 48, was
charged with criminal mischief and robbery.
   Brown last summer had befriended Cezar, who worked in LSU's
basketball dorm and had demanded to speak to the coach during the
standoff.
   ``What happened to Gato could have happened to any of us,''
Brown said after Cezar was freed from jail and taken to a hospital
for psychiatric evaluation. ``His personal problems were
overwhelming and he snapped.''
   School officials won't make any decisions about Cezar's future
until the charge is settled, said university spokesman Jim Crain.
The man filled out a job application during Wednesday's standoff,
but officials made no guarantees.
   Cezar, a former star Brazilian basketball player, was befriended
by Brown when the coach visited Sao Paolo last summer.
   He was a teacher in Brazil and came to this country on a
temporary visa. He supervised the LSU basketball dormitory while
taking courses to improve his English.
   Cezar, a father of two, needed money to send to his family and
wanted a work permit because his visa was expiring, Brown said.
   ``He is a frustrated, proud man who was just looking for a job,
who didn't want charity,'' said Brown.
   Cezar seized the cage keys from a student trainer Wednesday,
threatening the man with what turned out to be a toy gun, officials
said. He entered only the barred outer cage that surrounds the main
cage containing the tiger.
   An LSU basketball player Jose Vargas, a native of the Dominican
Republic, talked Cezar out of the cage.
   At one point during the standoff, some of the hundreds of
students who came to watch chanted: ``Tiger bait! Tiger bait!'' _
the cry raised at LSU sporting events when opposing teams enter.
   ``To those of you who shouted `Tiger bait,' what can I say?''
Brown said. ``May you never experience sadness and loneliness and
may you find a love that you couldn't give last night.''

<HEAD>City Pet Store Features Exotic Animals For Display</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COLLEEN DISKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leopards and llamas and doves. Oh my.
   Those are among the exotic denizens of Animal Kingdom, a pet
store that serves as a zoo for urban children and home for show
business animals.
   In addition to the usual assortment of puppies, kittens,
reptiles and fish, the store has a leopard that stars in
commercials, a duck that used to appear on a children's program and
an organ grinder's monkey that shares his cage with a toy fox
terrier.
   ``We have one rule about our exotic animals _ they have to be
able to work,'' said general manager Steve Maciontek. ``That way
they aren't just sitting in their cages all the time. That's not
good for them.''
   So Joshua the llama pulls a cart at parades, Luther the leopard
appears in commercials, and the 30-odd doves in the store are
rented out for weddings, serving as centerpieces at the bride and
groom's table.
   Maciontek said the 10,000 square-foot store has a special
exhibitor's license that allows it to house and display the 35
exotic animals it rents out, but never sells.
   When they're not earning their keep, the store's animals serve
as entertainment for customers and school children who visit the
store for free tours.
   ``When I get an inner city kid that's never been to a zoo, and I
see his eyes light when he sees the leopard, it makes it all
worthwhile,'' Maciontek said.
   The store on the city's north side averages at least two tours a
day during summer. Maciontek said the purpose is not only to expose
children to animals, but to teach them about caring for pets and
exotic animals.
   Twice a month, employees take animals to hospitals and nursing
homes, offering ``pet therapy'' to patients, Maciontek said.
   ``What we're trying to get across with our store is that animals
are only as wild as we make them,'' he said. ``People are shocked
when we go right into the cages to clean the animals, and the
leopard or the tiger licks our hands.''
   Only one of the store's animals is endangered, a rhinoceros
hornbill named Harriet. The 10-pound black-and-orange horned bird
is similar to a toucan.
   Federal officials inspect the store every year, checking to see
that the animal cages are large enough and that they're being fed
the right diet.
   Maciontek said the store occasionally gets complaints from
animal rights activists who don't think traditionally wild animals
should be in captivity. But he contends that the animals are
well-cared for and fare better than they might if they were in the
jungle.

<LEADPARA>  DEAR ANN -- As a 73-year-old, longtime reader, I was appalled by the letter
you printed recently about the woman who kept her dog in a cage when she went
to work in the morning and took him out when she came home at night.;    I
never in my life put a dog in a cage, nor did I ever tie one up. I trained all
my dogs myself and none of them made a mess anywhere. Cages are for wild
animals, not loving pets.;    -- San Diego Reader  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  WOMAN CAGES HER DOG, DRAWS BITING CRITICISM  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     DEAR SAN DIEGO -- You would not believe the mail generated by that letter.
Although in my response I quoted two well-respected authorities, the reading
public would have none of it. Read on:;    I was heartsick when I read the
letter about the little dog who was kept in a cage all day. And to think that
a respected veterinarian and a spokesperson from the Anti-Cruelty Society said
it didn't hurt the dog and was OK to do. If such treatment isn't animal abuse,
I don't know what is.;    --Beaumont, Texas;    I own a retail pet store. It
tears me up when I know or suspect a customer is buying a crate to confine a
puppy while the owner is at work. A puppy's bladder and bowels aren't equipped
to handle that kind of confinement. I was amazed at the authorities you quoted
who said it was perfectly OK and the dog "didn't mind." I wonder how they
would like that same treatment.;    -- Richmond, Va.;    I'll bet you've never
had a letter from a dog before. Well, Ann, when I heard talk around the
kitchen table about keeping me in a cage, like some lady in your column did to
her dog, I thought it was time I spoke up. I would hate it. I love being free
to run around the house. I know what I can do and what I can't do, and believe
me, I behave myself. Please tell your readers that people who aren't home all
day should get stuffed animals, not real ones.;    -- Bow Wow Smith,
Charleston S.C.;    The letter about keeping dogs caged did it. I am
contacting my newspaper and asking the editor to discontinue your column. Your
far-out views are doing a great deal of harm to the moral fiber of our country
and it is obvious that you are no friend of animals.;    -- Madison, Wis.;   
I am a veterinary assistant in Kentucky. I'm sure a lot of people are going to
write and complain about the woman who kept her dog in a cage while she
worked. May I say a few words in support of the idea? First, it's unwise to
use the word "cage." "Kennel" is better. A dog left alone for several hours
can become mighty bored. It is much safer for a bored dog to be in an enclosed
space (like a baby in a playpen) than roaming around a house or apartment
chewing through electrical cords, getting into the trash, pulling down
draperies and curtains, and gnawing at the furniture. The kennel may sound
cruel but it is by far the better alternative. I know you're going to get
blasted by the public even though the authorities you cited are top-notch.
Their stand is correct.;    --Louisville, Ky.;    DEAR L.M.L. -- Thanks for
coming to the rescue. Now that you've explained it in the simplest terms, I
hope people understand.  </TEXT>

   Whoopi Goldberg plans to boldly go where no
comedian-actress has gone before with a new role as an ``alien
humanoid hostess'' in the ``Star Trek: The Next Generation''
television series.
   Miss Goldberg's character, Guinan, will be seen in occasional
episodes of Paramount Television's syndicated show, which is
entering its second season, according to a news release.
   The ``Ten-Forward'' lounge where Miss Goldberg's character will
preside is new to the series and will give its writers a chance to
show characters relaxing.
   ``I've always been a Trekkie, so I thought it was time for me to
boldly go where no man has gone before,'' said Miss Goldberg, 32,
referring to the original ``Star Trek'' show's opening line
describing the mission of the Starship Enterprise.
   Goldberg has starred in several movies and won a Golden Globe
and an Academy Award nomination in 1985 for her role in ``The Color
Purple.'' Her latest movie, ``Clara's Heart,'' will be released
next month.

with breast cancer was made into a television movie, said she owes
her recovery to God and her husband, Andy.
   ``Andy was really terrific with me,'' said Miss Jillian, 37, who
underwent a double mastectomy three years ago.
   Miss Jillian urged women to perform breast self-examinations,
saying she discovered her cancer through such an examination.
   ``If it's a question of a breast and a question of life then
there's no question at all,'' Miss Jillian said last week in a
speech at East Tennessee State University.
   ``Whatever your faith is, if you're not familiar with it, find
it,'' she said. ``I have no courage or strength but whatever God
gives me.''
   Her battle with cancer was chronicled in the television movie,

he'd like to return the favor by raising the market, but declined,
saying ``that's not my field.''
   The archbishop of New York stopped by the exchange Monday to
thank the traders for a $71,000 contribution to the Cardinal's
Committee of the Laity, which supports shelters for the homeless,
soup kitchens, parochial schools and other Roman Catholic charities.
   ``You've had your reverses down here on Wall Street, but you've
maintained your courage and your faith,'' he told exchange workers
on the trading floor.
   ``I wish I could lift the market up for you, but that's not my
field,'' he added.
   The cardinal strolled around the trading floor several times,
inspiring bursts of applause. He shook hands with traers beneath
the dozens of green computer screens and electronic stock-price
tapes that line the room.

   A 176-pound Bengal tiger attacked its 17-year-old
trainer and broke her neck at a show for junior high school
students, police said today.
   The tiger bit Tomiko Omi on Monday when she unchained the animal
to begin the show inside a cage at the Shiratori Zoo in Kagawa,
southwestern Japan, a police official said.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the tiger
pulled away from Omi when another trainer near the cage shouted
``stop'' and lashed the animal with a whip.
   He said Omi was taken to a hospital with a broken neck and
injuries around her shoulder. But her life was not in immediate
danger, the official said.
   Omi has been a trainer for 21 months, the official said.

   A man charged with murdering 27 people in
a bus crash hadn't been drinking heavily the day of the accident,
relatives and a friend testified Monday as the defense opened its
case.
   Also testifying was Kentucky Fire Marshal John William Martin,
who said a smoky fire that engulfed the church bus still would have
occurred if the vehicle had been equipped with a protective cage
around its gas tank.
   The defense maintains that Larry Mahoney was not drunk when his
pickup slammed into the bus on May 14, 1988, and that the 27
victims were killed because the bus was unsafe.
   Mahoney admits drinking the day of the crash, driving on the
wrong side of Interstate 71 and striking the loaded church bus. He
is charged with 27 counts of murder, 42 counts of wanton
endangerment, 12 counts of assault and a count of drunken driving.
   Defense attorney William Summers asked Martin if a protective
cage around the gas tank might have prevented the fire that
followed the crash. Police say the gas tank was punctured by a
piece of the bus' front suspension after the collision.
   ``It's my opinion it would not have prevented the puncture in
this case,'' Martin said.
   The fire marshal also testified that plastic seat covers and
cushions in the bus were combustible, but later added that the
smoke that filled the bus might have come from the burning gasoline
alone.
   The former school bus, built in 1977 before more stringent
federal safety standards went into effect, had been sold as surplus
to the First Assembly of God church.
   Following the crash, Martin issued a report recommending that
new school buses be designed with diesel engines, additional
emergency escape doors and windows, and with gas tanks in the
center, rather than on the side.
   The defendant's mother, son and best friend followed Martin to
the witness stand, all testifying that Mahoney was not drunk when
they saw him the day of the accident, which occurred just before 11
p.m.
   Anthony Mahoney, 17, testified that he didn't see his father
drink, nor did he seem intoxicated when he left their trailer at
about 1 p.m.
   Mary Mahoney said her son wasn't drunk, and didn't consume any
alcohol, when he visited her at about 4:30 p.m.
   Mahoney's best friend, Dennis Mefford, testified that he thought
Mahoney had been drinking but was not intoxicated when he visited
Mefford's house at about 6:30 p.m.
   Mefford described Mahoney as a moderate drinker who finds that
hard liquor bothers his stomach. He said Mahoney drank one can of
beer while eating pizza, and then left with another can.
   The defense is expected to complete its phase of the trial by
Friday. It remained uncertain whether Mahoney would testify.

   Mike Larimer, whose house is full of snakes

slithery serpents the way most folks do.
   ``There's a lot of people who just don't understand snakes,''

kill a lot of rats and spiders and keep the rabbit population under
control, too.''
   He has plenty of chances to see snakes up close at home. Some
stay coiled up in tanks and cages. Sheba, a 50-pound python, has her
own room.
   ``Sheba's a little too big for a cage,'' Larimer said during a
recent interview at his home.
   Larimer's 10-foot prize pet could grow three times as long if she
eats enough of the live rabbits he keeps around for snake food.
   ``I'm really proud of her,'' Larimer said.
   In addition to the snakes, Larimer has a neon-green iguana named
Charlie, a tarantula dubbed Octy II, a pair of piranhas and some
frogs.
   ``Everything I've got but Charlie and my python came from the
woods,'' he said. ``Why buy it from the pet store when you can get
it for free? It's a lot more fun that way, too.''
   Larimer likes other animals, but says there's something special
about a scaly pet that slithers and hisses instead of barking all
night.
   ``Once you get over your fear of them, they make just as good a
pet as a cat or a dog,'' he said. ``They're a lot more interesting
to watch. They make nifty knots.''

   A three-legged cat dubbed Tripod
after its rescue from a drain pipe last month has a new home and a
new name.
   Connie Moon, one of 15 people who helped rescue the animal Oct.
22 after a leg got caught in a trap, adopted the cat last week and
renamed it Bandit.
   Mrs. Moon's sister, Amy, started the cat rescue effort when she
spotted the feline walking down a street, dragging the leg trap.
   Amy Moon said Monday that she tried to follow thet cat to see if
she could help it, but the animal darted away. Others joined in the
search for the hurt cat, including a police officer, three
firefighters, a humane society official and the Moon sisters.
   Connie Moon adopted the cat from the South Wood County Humane
Society, which cared for the animal and arranged for the amputation
of the right front leg injured by the trap.
   She said Bandit appears to be getting along with her other cat,
Precious.
   ``They didn't like each other at first, and hissed at each
other,'' Mrs. Moon said. ``But now they`re drinking out of the same
bowl.''

<LEADPARA>  THE CALVES specially raised to produce a gastronomic delicacy deceptively
named "milk-fed veal" spend their entire lives chained in pens less than 2
feet wide and 5 feet long.;    Those stalls are so small the animals cannot
ever groom themselves, turn around or even lie down in a natural position.
They must walk in their own urine and excrement, and inhale ammonia produced
by their wastes.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     To minimize muscle development and accelerate weight gain, they are allowed
no exercise. Instead, hundreds of calves typically are confined for their
entire lives to a single darkened building in which even the flow of fresh air
is restricted.;    They have no access to their mothers' milk, to solid food
or to drinking water. Instead, they are constantly fed a milky substance laced
with assorted antibiotics.;    To ensure that their meat will be the premium
"milk-fed" light color after slaughter, they are kept in an anemic state
through the withholding of adequate iron from their diets.;    That depressing
description, acknowledged by industry officials to be essentially accurate, is
offered by the Humane Farming Association, a small but feisty organization
based in the San Francisco suburb of San Rafael.;    Dedicated to the
elimination of "factory farming," HFA also seeks to generate public opposition
to what it says are similarly abusive practices in the commercial production
of other animals.;    Of the 95 million hogs born in this country every year,
80 percent initially are placed in undersized cement pens or wire cages. When
the pigs reach a weight of 50 pounds, they are transferred to equally
confining finishing pens. The hogs remain there, with only 6 square feet of
space apiece, until they are fattened to a slaughter weight of slightly more
than 200 pounds.;    The treatment of White Leghorns, the most popular strain
of egg-laying chickens, is especially disturbing because the industry has no
use for male chicks. The breed cannot be raised as broilers for human
consumption and only the females can lay eggs.;    "So half of all chicks
hatched each year, the males, are simply tossed into plastic garbage bags,"
says HFA. "Though some companies gas them, most simply allow them to suffocate
under the weight of other chicks dumped on top. Sometimes they are ground up
for animal food -- while still alive."; ' So half of all chicks hatched each
year, the males, are simply tossed into plastic garbage bags.  ';  The
surviving females have their beaks seared off by hot blades when they are a
month old. Two months later, they are packed into wire "battery cages" to
begin their work as "layers" producing more than 250 eggs apiece per year.;   
Four or five hens typically are crowded into a single cage whose floor
dimensions are only 12-by-18 inches. As many as 250,000 birds are housed in a
single building. When their egg production starts to dwindle at the age of
about 1 1/2 years, they are dispatched to slaughterhouses.;    So goes the
short, horrific life of animals raised on factory farms.  </TEXT>
