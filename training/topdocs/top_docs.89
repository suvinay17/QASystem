VIDEO A 'CELEBRATION OF SEX' -- MADONNA

ABC's "Nightline" today aired Madonna's too-hot-for-MTV video in its steamy 
entirety, and Madonna -- the picture of propriety in a buttoned-up black dress 
-- defended the clip as a "celebration of sex." 
</P>
<P>
"Why are we willing to deal with the reality of violence and sexism and why 
aren't we willing to deal with sexuality?" she asked in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're going to have censorship, let's not be hypocrites about this," the 
pop singer added. "Why is it OK for 10-year-olds to see someone's body being 
ripped to shreds? . . . Why do parents not have a problem with that?" 
</P>
<P>
Her "Justify My Love" video, which was rejected by the cable music station last 
week, features the bra-and-garter-belt-clad singer in an encounter with a 
lover, played by her real-life boyfriend, Tony Ward, in a Paris hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The video portrays the couple's fantasies, which run to bisexuality, voyeurism, 
group sex, cross-dressing and mild sadomasochism. 
</P>
<P>
"Half of me thought I was going to get away with it," said Madonna, speaking 
via satellite from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
She said the video -- with its chains, black leather and crucifixes -- was 
about "honesty . . . and the celebration of sex. There's nothing wrong with 
that." 
</P>
<P>
The video -- with some naughty bits electronically altered -- had appeared 
previously on NBC's "Saturday Night Live" and on CNN. It also was shown 
uncensored on The Jukebox Network, a pay-TV channel. 
</P>
<P>
Before it was shown on "Nightline," ABC lawyers screened the video, said Laura 
Wessner, a spokeswoman for the program. 
</P>
<P>
"They determined to go ahead with it because of the news value of the video, 
the late air time, and the focus of the discussion," Wessner said. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewer Forrest Sawyer asked Madonna to address herself to feminists who 
have criticized her boy-toy image. 
</P>
<P>
"I may be dressing like the typical bimbo, whatever, but I'm in charge," she 
answered. "I'm in charge of my fantasies, I put myself in these situations with 
men."

   Madonna, a master at making videos that generate
almost as much controversy as they do record sales, wants to know
why violence is acceptable for television and steamy sex scenes are
not.
   Madonna appeared on ABC-TV's ``Nightline'' early Tuesday in an
interview just after the news program aired her too-hot-for-MTV
video ``Justify My Love'' in its entirety.
   The video, rejected by MTV last week, features the
bra-and-garter-belt-clad singer in an encounter with a lover,
played by her real-life boyfriend, Tony Ward, in a Paris hotel.
   The video is intended to portray the couple's fantasies, which
run to bisexuality, voyeurism, group sex, cross-dressing and mild
sadomasochism.
   She told interviewer Forrest Sawyer via satellite from Los
Angeles that the video - with its chains, black leather and
crucifixes - was about ``honesty ... and the celebration of sex.
There's nothing wrong with that.''
   But she said she thought there was a double standard at work on
television.
   ``Why are we willing to deal with the reality of violence and
sexism and why aren't we willing to deal with sexuality?'' she
asked.
   The appearance got the show its highest overnight ratings this
year, ABC said Tuesday.
   The 30-minute show averaged a 10.2 rating in overnight A.C.
Nielsen Co. ratings from 25 cities. Those ratings represent nearly
half of the nation's 93.1 million TV households.
   The program's national ratings won't be in until next week, but
ABC projects that they also will be the highest this year for
``Nightline,'' said spokeswoman Laura Wessner.
   Monday's show was preceded by ABC's telecast of the San
Francisco 49ers-New York Giants' football game, which very likely
helped the ``Nightline'' ratings by giving the show a big lead-in
audience, Wessner said.
   Monday's ``Nightline'' marked the first time a major network had
run Madonna's much-publicized video without first censoring parts
of it. But the video's first uncensored national telecast was
Thursday, when it was shown on The Jukebox Network, an interactive
cable network.
   Despite the appearance of Madonna and her video on
``Nightline,'' the show's ratings champion probably will remain Ted
Koppel's May 27, 1987, interview of fallen TV evangelist Jim Bakker
and Bakker's wife, Tammy.
   That one-hour special broadcast averaged an 11.4 national
rating. A ratings point in 1987 represented 87.4 million homes.

<HEAD>Madonna Files Divorce Petition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress-singer Madonna and estranged
husband Sean Penn have agreed on a division of property and filed a
petition for divorce, court records show.
   The Los Angeles County Superior Court petition to dissolve the
stormy three-year marriage cited irreconcilable differences as the
reason for the split, and seeks restoration of the singer's former
name, Madonna Ciccone.
   It also said community property and financial obligations shared
by the couple ``have been disposed of by written agreement.'' No
details were disclosed in the two-page petition filed Jan. 25.
   Madonna publicist Liz Rosenberg said last week that Penn would
get the couple's Malibu home and the singer would keep the New York
apartment. Madonna bought a $2.9 million Hollywood Hills home
earlier this month.
   Penn's attorney, Marcy Rosenblum, declined to comment, and
publicist Lois Smith didn't return telephone calls Wednesday.
   It is the second time the sultry songstress has taken steps to
end her 1985 marriage to Penn. She first filed a Superior Court
divorce petition in 1987, but later withdrew it.
   The latest divorce action follows a Dec. 28 incident in which Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputies were called to the
couple's Malibu home after the hot-tempered Penn allegedly beat
Madonna. No charges were filed.
   Madonna rose to fame with her hits ``Borderline'' and ``Like a
Virgin,'' and is perhaps best known by the title of another song,
``Material Girl.'' She starred in the movies ``Desperately Seeking
Susan'' and ``Shanghai Surprise,'' a box office dud co-starring Penn.
   Penn rose to stardom in the movie ``Fast Times at Ridgemont
High'' and went on to appear in ``Taps,'' ``The Falcon and the
Snowman'' and ``Colors.''
   Penn served more than half of a 60-day jail term in 1987 for
violating parole by punching a movie extra during filming of the
movie ``Colors.'' He was on probation at the time for punching a man
he accused of trying to kiss Madonna in a nightclub in April 1986.

   Actor Sean Penn and singer Madonna have
separated and are planning to end their turbulent, three-year
marriage, a spokesman for the pugnacious actor said Thursday.
   The announcement follows a nullified divorce filing from late
1987 and several well-publicized fights between the hot-tempered
Penn and photographers, one of which led to a 60-day prison term.
   New divorce rumors have swirled around the couple for months.
   ``It is true,'' spokesman John West said. ``Sean and Madonna are
separated. They plan to divorce and it's amicable.''
   Bob Merlis, a spokesman for Madonna's record label, Warner Bros.,
said that Madonna brought the divorce action. ``I assume (the
divorce was filed) in Los Angeles,'' he said.
   Telephone messages left with Penn's lawyers were not immediately
returned.
   Madonna, a singer best know as the ``Material Girl,'' won stardom
with her hits ``Borderline'' and ``Like a Virgin.'' Her latest album
for Warner Bros., due out late next month, is titled ``Like a
Prayer.''
   Penn, who has starred in the movies ``Colors,'' ``The Falcon and
the Snowman,'' ``Bad Boys,'' and ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High,''
is appearing in on the Los Angeles stage in ``Hurlyburly,'' a play
about Hollywood decadence.
   A spokesman for the play, Jay Schwartz, said that Penn would
complete the play's run to Jan. 15.
   The couple married in August 1985 in a Malibu ocean-bluff
ceremony that was buzzed by press photographers in helicopters.
Madonna, whose full name is Madonna Louise Ciccone, appeared in nude
photographs in Playboy and Penthouse magazines the month before the
nuptials.
   The couple starred together in the ill-fated 1986 feature
``Shanghai Surprise,'' in which Madonna played a missionary
smuggling opium in the Orient.
   The pugnacious Penn served more than half of a 60-day prison term
in 1987 for violating parole by punching a movie extra.
   Penn was on probation from an earlier case that stemmed from a
fight he had with a man he accused of trying to kiss Madonna in a
nightclub in April 1986.
   In an interview that year, he spoke fondly of his wife. ``Nothing
that I could possibly come up with is as important as her,'' he
said. ``No movie, nothing is as important as her. And that's about
the best answer I can give.
   ``No whale, no nuclear war, no starving nation is more important,
either.''

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Critique:
   Madonna Louise, the Bad Goddaughter
   ----
   By Raymond Sokolov
</HL>

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12
</SO>
<LP>
   New York -- In one of the more perplexing moments of her
new film, "Truth or Dare," Madonna defends herself against
the moral strictures of the Vatican. She says she is proud to
be an Italian-American brought up in a country where free
speech is protected. And as an artist, she refuses to censor
what she does on stage -- touch her privates (so to speak).
   Madonna Louise Ciccone, named after both her spiritual and
her secular mothers, almost never loses sight of her
Italian-American Roman Catholic roots in the calculated and
constant self-exposure of "Truth or Dare." The sex-miming,
with hand and with bottle, got most of the attention a year
ago during the actual tour the film commemorates. But the
profanation of an Evian bottle (symbol of yuppie fitness and
dietary fad) shocked nobody in the packed movie theater where
I saw "Truth or Dare" on Monday. In fact, the nicely turned
out young people in their plain-Jane prep uniforms gave
Madonna a round of applause for her oral skill and
exuberance.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But what about the profanation of that older symbol, the
cross? With all the clucking over blasphemy in the work of
Salman Rushdie, where is the fury over Madonna's flaunting a
crucifix in a churchlike set while simulating various acts
not condoned by orthodoxy? The Vatican, of course, objected,
but the Vatican also arrested the comedian Don Novello when
he showed up there in his costume as Father Guido Sarducci.
Isn't Madonna's cross-capering just as trivial a spoof,
something to shrug off?
   Perhaps, but she is up to something nastier than Mr.
Novello, something much more fundamentally subversive about
Catholicism and her heritage in general, especially in the
new film, something hovering between reverence and nastiness.
When she lures her family in front of the "cinema verite"
camera, she's ostensibly honoring them and her past, but
there's always an edge to the scene. Sometimes, the nastiness
is overt, sarcasm about a brother's troubled life; sometimes
the sneer is muffled, with her father, whose clumsiness and
home-spun morality mock themselves in this setting. It's no
favor to your dad to sing "Happy Birthday" to him on the same
stage where you've just been pretending to masturbate while
singing "Like a Virgin."
   Madonna, from the little joke of her Christian name to the
huge power of her scabrous popularity, has been "pushing
people's buttons" in a peppy, light-hearted way about deep
matters: family, gender, ethnicity. In the offstage world
most of us live in, these issues cause all kinds of trouble,
from charges of insensitivity to demands for racially
separate high school proms to riots in Washington and
terrorism in Northern Ireland. Madonna skates on this thin
ice, saucily turning the real anger people might feel about
parents, Catholics, Right to Life priests or sex roles into
an evening of pleasant song and steamy gyration, froth that
will bubble away.
   Of course, it won't, and that's what Madonna is so
astutely playing off, the real world of Italian-American
roots, most especially the negative stereotype of Godfather
violence and corruption that got a new shot in the arm this
spring in this city when it transpired that Gus Bevona, who
called out his union of apartment workers without a vote and
then settled their (his?) strike without a vote, was earning
around $400,000 before you counted the union salaries of
several other Bevonas.
   So Madonna makes cheerfully decadent sport out of her
background. She is the bad Goddaughter. It's only a pose, of
course. She's not advocating any life style, she says (except
maybe the life style of a pop star, which she recommends to a
member of her troupe who seems to be wavering about her
career). I believe her. Her lack of commitment to any clear
idea, her playing at evil is what prevented any serious
public backlash to her antics, even in moral Toronto.
   So her main sin is a minor one, a sin against the Holy
Ghost, against truth: She keeps talking about Detroit as her
home town. As a real native Detroiter, I want to remind
everyone that Madonna is from Bay City, Mich., a nice place
in the thumb of the state's lower peninsula.
   Nice was not enough for Ms. Ciccone. She split for New
York, found work, variously, as a dancer, a nude
photographer's model and, fatefully, in the rock-club
demimonde. One thing led to another, as they say, but along
the way she hung out at the fringes of the city's bohemian
arts vanguard and learned a thing or two. Bay City met East
Village.
   This is the cultural hybrid attitude that Madonna purveys
on the stage. She is the runaway from the boonies who has met
advanced artists and performers and has learned to mouth
their lingo. From a place where nothing went, she fetched up
where anything goes. Now she's singing anthems of
polymorphous, anticlerical liberation, taking a pop version
of downtown Manhattan avant-gardism of the '70s to every
corner of the globe. And getting filthy rich at it. Our Lady
of Evian.

<HEAD>Christian Group Calls for One-Year Pepsi Boycott Due to Madonna Ties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

   A Christian organization called Friday for a
boycott of Pepsi because the soft drink maker refused to cancel its
contract with the singer Madonna, who also is starring in a steamy
music video set in a church.
   The American Family Association, based in Tupelo, Miss., said it
was asking people not to drink Pepsi for a year because Pepsi
rejected its request to cancel a contract with Madonna for her
appearance in a Pepsi commercial.
   ``It is indeed unfortunate that Pepsi would give Madonna millions
of dollars for the right to promote her as a role model for our
youth,'' said Donmald E. Wildmon, executive director of the
association.
   The group publishes a monthly Christian magazine that claims a
circulation of 380,000. Pepsi has not said how much it is paying the
singer although published reports have estimated it at between $2
million and $5 million.
   Asked if the boycott was simply an attempt at censorship, Wildmon
said, ``Pepsi doesn't have to withdraw the commercial. Just don't
ask me to pay my money to help pay for Madonna's contract.''
   At Pepsi-Cola Co. headquarters in Somers, N.Y., spokeswoman Becky
Madeira said, ``It is regrettable that he is taking this action
because it is difficult to definitively make a value judgment.''
   She said Pepsi officials had talked to Wildmon and hoped to set
up a meeting at which it could ``discuss his concerns at greater
length.''
   The company has previously said its commercial with Madonna was
entirely separate from the singer's music video. Both the commercial
and the video feature her new song, ``Like a Prayer.''
   Pepsi bought time on the top-rated shows in 40 countries on March
2 to launch its new two-minute commercial called ``Make a Wish,''
which featured the first public broadcast of ``Like a Prayer.''
   The commercial showed Madonna watching a home film of her eighth
birthday, and then trading places with the young girl who played her
as a child.
   On March 3, Madonna's music video debuted on the MTV cable
network.
   It tells a story of a woman who goes to the rescue of a man
wrongly accused of attacking another woman. The video shows Madonna
seeking refuge in a church, dancing among burning crosses, kissing a
statue that come to life, freeing an accused man and then kissing
him.
   Wildmon said his group interpreted the character Madonna plays in
the video to be symbolic of Jesus Christ while the man she rescues
symbolizes a priest.
   ``But the video's symbolism of Christ having sex with a priest,
suggesting the priests _ indeed all Christians _ are sexually
repressed is blatantly offensive. That is absolutely repugnant to
Christians,'' he said.
   Pepsi pulled its Madonna ad from MTV after the cable network
began running the video, although a source close to Pepsi said it
was so the commercial would not compete with the video rather
because of than reservations about the video.
   Pepsi officials said they still plan to sponsor a worldwide
concert tour by Madonna and to run shorter versions of the
two-minute Pepsi ad with the singer on broadcast television.

   Pepsi-Cola Co. changed its plans to run its new
two-minute commercial with pop star Madonna on MTV last weekend
after the cable network started running the singer's potentially
controversial new music video, a source close to the soft drink
maker confirmed Wednesday.
   The Pepsi ad with Madonna, which was dubbed ``Make a Wish'' and
included an abbreviated verision of her new song ``Like a Prayer,''
debuted last Thursday on what Pepsi said were top-rated television
shows in 40 countries.
   The next day, the cable network MTV began running a separate
music video designed to herald the launch of the singer's new song.
   The video shows Madonna in a black slip, dancing among burning
crosses and seeking refuge in a church where she kisses a statue of
a saint who comes to life.
   Pepsi had planned to run the two-minute ad last weekend on MTV,
but withheld it while the video is running, according to the source
who spoke on condition he not be identified.
   The source said the change in plans was motivated by a desire to
avoid competing for attention with the video and not by worries
about the controversy that could be stirred by the video.
   Carole Robinson, a spokeswoman for MTV, said the network has
received no complaints about the video, which has been running since
last Friday.
   Liz Rosenberg, a spokesman for Warner Brothers Records, Madonna's
record label, said the record company had received no complaints
here about the video.
   She said a state-run television network in Italy delayed its
plans to carry the video last weekend after a Catholic group
objected to what it had heard may be in the video. But she said the
network has since reviewed the video and plans to begin airing it
within the next 10 days.
   Tod MacKenzie, a spokesman for Pepsi, declined to comment on
whether the Pepsi ad was withdrawn from MTV but said the company had
not changed its overall ad campaign plans.
   He said those plans were to air the two-minute version of the
commercial before the song was released and then air shorter
versions of the two-minute ad after the singer's record had begun to
rise on the record charts.
   The single of Madonna's song was released earlier this week, and
the album is due out later this month.
   MacKenzie said he could not say when the shorter ads will begin
appearing.

   NEW YORK -- Call it "Madonna meets Wonder Woman on Wall
Street."
   By day, the new Marvel comic book heroine Nightcat has a
gig as aspiring pop singer Jacqueline Tavarez. By night, she
stalks the city in skin-tight leather and slices up bad guys.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In real life, though, Jackie Tavarez actually is a
struggling singer who performs under the moniker Nightcat.
Her promoters, trying to get her noticed, have linked her
image to an alter-ego super heroine, signing Marvel Comics
legend Stan Lee to create a comic book all her own.
   Sound weird? There's more. Ms. Tavarez's backers have set
up a publicly held company, dubbed Black Cat Entertainment
Co., to profit from her many exploits. In addition to the
live performer and the comic book, there is a Nightcat record
album, and a video is in the works. "It's as if Madonna were
a public company," says Black Cat's chairman, Charles Stein.
   Except that Jackie Tavarez is a long way from being a pop
star. Her debut album still hasn't sold out its first run of
just 25,000 copies.
   But the new comic book has the makings of a hit.
Nightcat's premiere issue, which went on sale in early April,
has already sold out its initial run of 70,000 copies. For
the debut issue of a $3.95 heavystock book, that is "a very
good, strong sale," says a spokeswoman for Marvel Comics. A
typical Spiderman or Superman, by comparison, might sell half
a million copies but retails for only $1 and is printed on
cheaper paper.
   The idea of making a comic book character a pop star isn't
new. More than two decades ago, "Archie" gave rise to the
Archies, who sang one of the most saccharine hits of all
time, "Sugar, Sugar." In the late '70s, going in reverse,
Marvel produced a series of comic books based on the
heavymetal band Kiss. And this year, Time Warner Inc.'s DC
Comics unit is creating a fantasy comic book for rock star
Prince, who tours this summer.
   Buyers of the premiere issue of "Nightcat" get lots of
violence, a little bondage, the obligatory mad scientist --
and plenty of skin. The heroine wears thigh-high stiletto
boots and a skimpy, black leather top that laces up the
center, similar to the get-up Ms. Tavarez wears -- in real
life -- on stage. "It looks like an S&amp;M outfit," the
21-yearold singer concedes.
   In the first issue's climactic scene, Nightcat, armed with
new powers after an accidental injection of "cat serum,"
battles a scantily clad villainess on the roof of a
skyscraper to avenge her father's death. "I dunno, for a
modern, happening chick, you sure sound like a dork]" the
Nightcat taunts. "Now that we've finished discussing my
verbal proclivities," her nemesis retorts, "you may prepare
to die]"
   If the project catches on, Black Cat Entertainment could
post some pretty profits. The comic book market this year is
expected to approach $500 million at retail, according to
Comics Buyer's Guide. A strong character can sell up to
500,000 copies a month.
   More importantly, the typical comic-book buyer is likely
to be part of the biggest chunk of the music-buying market:
males from teen-agers to 30-year-olds. The new company will
get a 5% share of comic-book sales and an 8% cut of album
revenue. The singer herself receives a fourth of Black Cat's
take.
   The comic book promotion was the brainchild of Ms.
Tavarez's manager, Don Kessler. He approached Mr. Lee, the
chairman of Marvel Comics and creator of the Incredible Hulk,
Spidey and a passel of other super heroes.
   Mr. Lee met with the young singer and immediately felt she
had "something feline-seeming" about her. The story line uses
the singer's real name and has her sing lyrics from her
songs. It also engages in a bit of wishful thinking, with one
page showing the Nightcat gracing magazine covers, including
Time's. And it introduces a funky new sound effect --
"Snik-Snik," when Nightcat unleashes her talons.
   Ms. Tavarez, for her part, had wanted to be a journalist.
But she found success in modeling in high school, making her
mark saying "Fayva wow]" in TV commercials for the shoe
company.
   The aspiring singer, who was born in the Dominican
Republic and raised in the tough Bushwick section of
Brooklyn, gushes at the chance to "express myself for good
things." In subsequent issues of the comic book, she says,
she hopes to focus more on her Hispanic background and
address more socially significant issues.

   Paula Abdul doesn't mind being
known as a former Laker Girl but the four MTV Video Music Awards
showered on her ``Straight Up'' video should help sideline the
cheerleader image.
   ``You don't want to see me weep, do you?'' she asked the audience
Wednesday night as ``Straight Up'' collected trophies for best
female video, dance, choreography and editing.
   ``I owe a lot to being a Laker Girl,'' the ex-cheerleader for the
Los Angeles basketball team said backstage. Only nominations for
best new artist and breakthrough video didn't pan out.
   Madonna, veteran rocker Neil Young and newcomers Living Colour
also were top winners at the sixth-annual event.
   Young's satirical ``This Note's for You'' won the coveted best
video award, although MTV once banned the video, ostensibly because
it contained commercial messages.
   Madonna won the Viewers' Choice trophy for ``Like a Prayer.'' Her
``Express Yourself'' video earned direction honors for David
Fincher, the art direction trophy for Vance Lorenzini, and best
cinematography for Mark Plummer.
   ``I guess this means you like me, you really like me,'' Madonna
told the crowd in a joking echo of actress Sally Field's ``You like
me'' acceptance speech at the 1984 Oscars. ``And I'd like to thank
Pepsi for causing so much controversy.''
   The Pepsi Cola Co. in April withdrew its TV commercial featuring
Madonna and its sponsorship of her tour. The commercial featured a
burning cross and other images that offended some Christians.
   Living Colour, a band that blends rock, funk, reggae and jazz,
won the best group, new artist and stage performance awards for
``Cult of Personality.'' They accepted by satellite from Pittsburgh,
where they were performing in concert with the Rolling Stones.
   ``Veronica'' gave Elvis Costello the male video honor, and
R.E.M's ``Orange Crush'' captured the post modern category.
   The career-achievement Video Vanguard award went to pop singer
George Michael.
   Rap went to D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince for ``Parents Just
Don't Understand.''
   ``This is a dream come true,'' said Fresh Prince, 19, who urged
all of the ``kids out there'' to ``stay away from drugs and all that
stuff.''
   ``Kiss'' by Art of Noise featuring vocals by Tom Jones was named
breakthrough video of the year.
   Guns 'N Roses had the best heavy metal video with ``Sweet Child
O' Mine'' and the combination of Irish rockers U2 and veteran
bluesman B.B. King earned a best video from film trophy for ``When
Love Comes to Town'' from the concert movie ``Rattle and Hum.''
   The show, with host Arsenio Hall, featured performances by Miss
Abdul, Cher _ in a leather jacket and skimpy teddy _ Def Leppard,
Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, and Madonna.
   Comedian Andrew Dice Clay made what became his last MTV
performance, a routine filled with obscene and unprintable poems and
comments about overweight women and sex.
   MTV Vice President Barry Kluger suddenly appeared at a backstage
press rome and issued a statement of apology: ``Andrew Dice Clay did
not do this in rehearsal and we were very surprised by it. Based on
this experience, Andrew Dice Clay will not be appearing on MTV in
the future.''
   Two stars had major disappointments. Michael Jackson's work was
nominated in eight categories, including best video for ``Leave Me
Alone,'' but came away with one special effects trophy.
   Jody Watley, the Grammy Awards' best new artist of 1988, had six
nominations for her ``Real Love'' video and came away emptyhanded.

   Former Laker Girl Paula Abdul's
energetic ``Straight Up'' video won four trophies at the sixth
annual MTV Video Music Awards as Madonna claimed the Viewers' Choice
and three technical honors Wednesday night.
   ``I owe a lot to being a Laker Girl,'' Abdul, who began her
career as a cheerleader for the National Basketball Association team
here, said backstage at the Universal Amphitheatre. ``It was a great
vehicle to start off.''
   Abdul's video, which drew on cheerleading dance styles, took best
female video, dance, choreography and editing.
   Veteran rocker Neil Young earned best video for the satirical
``This Note's For You,'' which MTV once banned from broadcast,
ostensibly because it contained commercial messages. The video
satirized rock star endorsements of products, and featured Michael
Jackson and Whitney Houston lookalikes.
   Madonna, who was nominated six times, got the Viewer's Choice
award for ``Like a Prayer.'' Her ``Express Yourself'' video earned
direction honors for David Fincher, the art direction trophy for
Vance Lorenzini, and best cinematography for Mark Plummer.
   ``I guess this means you like me, you really like me,'' the
singer said after receiving her Viewers Choice award, in a joking
echo of actress Sally Field's ``You like me'' acceptance speech at
the 1984 Academy Awards.
   ``And I'd like to thank Pepsi for causing so much controversy,''
Madonna added.
   The Pepsi Cola Co. in April withdrew its television commercial
featuring Madonna and also its sponsorship of her tour. The
commercial featured a burning cross and other images that offended
Christian groups, particularly Roman Catholics.
   The Viewers Choice is a popularity award determined by telephone
votes and ballots received by mail and fax machine.
   Funk rockers Living Colour won best group, new artist and stage
performance awards for ``Cult of Personality.'' They accepted their
trophies backstage at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh, where they
were performing with the Rolling Stones.
   Stones' lead singer Mick Jagger presented the best group video
trophies during the live satellite remote.
   Elvis Costello got the male video honor for ``Veronica,''
R.E.M.'s ``Orange Crush'' captured the post-modern category.
   Madonna, taking a sultry stage pose with a cigarette and a
two-woman entourage, introduced the career-achievement Video
Vanguard award to pop singer George Michael. The award had been
announced in advance.
   D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince won the rap award for
``Parents Just Don't Understand.''
   ``This is a dream come true,'' said Fresh Prince, 19, who urged
all of the ``kids out there'' to ``Stay away from drugs and all that
stuff.''
   ``Kiss,'' by Art of Noise and featuring vocals by Tom Jones, was
hailed as the year's breakthrough video.
   Guns N' Roses won the heavy metal category for ``Sweet Child O'
Mine'' and the combination of Irish rockers U2 and veteran bluesman
B.B. King earned a best video from film trophy for ``When Love Comes
to Town'' from the concert movie ``Rattle and Hum.''
   The awards show, hosted by Arsenio Hall, lasted 2{ hours and
featured performances by Abdul, Cher, Def Leppard, Jon Bon Jovi,
Richie Sambora, and Madonna.
   A performance by MTV comic Andrew Dice Clay was filled with
obscene, unprintable poems and comments about overweight women and
sex. MTV Vice President Barry Kluger quickly went before reporters
backstage and apologized for the material.
   ``Andrew Dice Clay did not do this in rehearsal and we were very
surprised by it. Based on this experience, Andrew Dice Clay will not
be appearing on MTV in the future,'' Kluger said.
   The comic had already left before Kluger's statement.
   Pop superstar Michael Jackson had the odds in his favor going
into the show, but he cashed in only one of his eight nominations,
earning a special effects trophy for Jim Blashfield.
   Jody Watley came up emptyhanded despite six nominations for
``Real Love.''
   Puerto Rican singer Chayanne won best Latin rock video in the
International Viewers Choice award, a popularity contest determined
by telephone votes and ballots received by mail and fax machine.
   Nominations were made in 18 general and professional categories.
The additional special categories included Hall of Fame, Viewers
Choice and International Viewers Choice, the latter for best
European, Australian, Japanese and Latin rock videos.
   Jackson was a multiple winner at the first MTV Video Music Awards
in 1984, taking the special Viewer's Choice, choreography and
overall performance honors for ``Thriller.'' But even then he was
overshadowed by Herbie Hancock's six awards for ``Rockit.''
   Jackson didn't get another MTV award until last year, when he was
given a special Video Vanguard award.
   And despite an emphasis on stunning visuals, Madonna didn't win
an MTV award until 1986. Her second came in 1987.
   In the short history of the MTV awards, Peter Gabriel was the
biggest winner of a single year, collecting nine silver statuettes
for ``Sledgehammer'' in 1987.
   The first and second MTV awards were staged at Radio City Music
Hall in New York City. The 1986 show originated from both the
Universal Amphitheatre and the Palladium in New York. Since then the
amphitheater has been its home.

JUDGE RULES THAT MADONNA CAN'T JUSTIFY HER HEDGE; 
</P>
<P>
LAWSUITS: THE POP STAR MUST CUT BACK SHRUBBERY AND A PINE TREE AT HER HOLLYWOOD 
HILLS HOME, ENDING A TWO-YEAR BATTLE WITH NEIGHBOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When you live in a neighborhood where high walls, stately trees and imposing 
hedgerows can block a neighbor's million-dollar view of the city below, the 
question is: How tall is too tall? 
</P>
<P>
Now, in a posh section of the Hollywood Hills where rock star Madonna and 
neighbor Donald J. Robinson have been squabbling over the height of trees and 
bushes surrounding the singer's home, comes the answer from Los Angeles 
Superior Court Judge Sally Disco: Eight feet for the driveway hedge. At the 
roof line for the offending pine tree. 
</P>
<P>
In a written ruling released Thursday, Disco ordered Madonna to trim her hedges 
and the tree -- and pay real estate broker Robinson's attorneys' fees too. 
</P>
<P>
So ended a two-year legal dispute that wound up in court last week, as Robinson 
sought to prevent the pop diva from blocking his panoramic view with her 
protective landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very pleased," Robinson said after Disco's ruling was made public. "We 
all have these magnificent views, and whatever it takes to protect, I will do." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson sued Madonna, whose last name is Ciccone, in March contending that she 
had failed to comply with a written agreement about the trimming and height of 
the pine tree, driveway hedges and other landscaping on her property on Oriole 
Way. 
</P>
<P>
By failing to control her shrubbery, Robinson contended, she had reduced the 
value of his $3.5-million property, on the hillside above Madonna's, by $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The singer countersued, accusing Robinson of trespassing and making "abusive 
and derogatory statements." Her attorney charged that the neighbor "cut a hole" 
in the hedges separating the two properties to "stare at her." 
</P>
<P>
Disco rejected Madonna's charges of trespassing or "peeking," but agreed with 
the singer that six cypress trees interfering with Robinson's view had already 
been removed. 
</P>
<P>
"Judgment is to be entered in favor of the plaintiff and against defendant to 
trim the acacia hedge at the bottom of the driveway . . .," Disco said, "not in 
excess of eight feet at any time . . . and to trim the pine tree to the south 
of the pool. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if an appeal was contemplated, Madonna's attorney, Meghan Serwin, said: 
"I don't know at this time." 
</P>
<P>
At Madonna's home, the bottom of the driveway was sealed by an electrically 
controlled iron gate. Over an intercom system, an unidentified woman said there 
would be "no comment."

<TEXT>
   Before Martika could even speak, she was
thinking about singing and dancing.
   ``I feel like I've done it before, probably in a previous life''
explained the 20-year-old singer and actress, who has released her
self-titled debut album. ``I think when I came out ofmy mother's
womb I was ready to be a performer. Most people don't have that. I
can never explain why. God only knows.''
   Born Marta Marrero, she began dance classes at 4 and was soon
giving recitals at school. Martika, the daughter of Cuban
immigrants, also paid close attention to the new phenonema of music
videos on television.
   ``Yeah, it was big,'' she recalled. ``I grew up on MTV. When I
was 14, MTV was taking off. That's when I got into pop. Culture
Club, Duran Duran and Madonna came out.''
   Impatient to break into show business, Martika was calling
agents at age 11; she had no interest in pursuing a conventional
career.
   ``I have friends who say, `I hate my job. I wish I could do
something else.' I say, `Go do it.' I really believe you should
follow your heart even if you have to go through rough times.
   ``I know I wanted it badly enough, I would have starved for it.
Better that than making a lot of money in an office and being
unhappy for the rest of my life.''
   Rock singer Madonna would prove to be a major influence on the
aspiring star, who admired her determination to succeed.
   ``Madonna's been really inspirational for me because she took
herself from nothing to the hugest female pop star alive. She
introduced the whole dance music scene. She paved the way for the
rest of us. People still don't take her seriously, but she's still
making records.''
   Martika also chose to professionally use just one name, but
denied getting the idea from Madonna. Afterall, Cher had done it
before.
   ``Even when I was younger, I thought it would be cool to have
one name, to have a unique name like Martika,'' the singer said.
``I started using it when I was 16. I was acting, and my agent said
I should save having one name for my recording career. Casting
directors would complain to the agencies that I didn't have a last
name.''
   Martika landed a minor role in the 1982 film version of
``Annie.'' She went on to appear on several television shows,
including ``Silver Spoons,'' ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' ``Hardcastle &amp;
McCormick'' and the children's variety series, ``Kids
Incorporated.''
   When she turned 18, she set her sights on the music industry,
spending a year preparing songs with producer-writer Michael Jay
(Miami Sound Machine, Stephanie Mills). She needed just two months
to record the album, a collection of dance tracks and ballads.
   The first single, ``More Than You Know,'' reached the Top 20,
but Martika's favorite song on the album is the anti-drug ``Toy
Soldiers,'' which she wrote herself.
   ``I was a little hesitant because I had only written two songs
before and they were light songs. I came up to Michael and said I
wanted to write about drugs. It was the first time I got the nerve
to write about something that was scary for me to talk about, so I
did,'' she said.
   Martika wrote the song about a friend who had been addicted to
cocaine.
   ``He can't listen to it,'' she said. ``It gives him the chills.
He says it affects him too much. He knows it's about him. He loves
it. he thinks it's a beautiful song, but when he listens to my
record, he skips over that.''
   Martika also does a dance version of Carole King's ``I Feel the
Earth Move.'' The young singer was just 3 when King's classic
``Tapestry'' album was released and knew little about her work.
   ``I listened to the melody once and put it away because I didn't
want to be influenced by her performance. I wanted to do it my
way,'' she said. ``Doing a remnake, you get the opportunity to
revive something for the older generation but you can also
introduce a great old song to kids who never knew it existed.''
   Fans should be warned that Martika does not expect to stay in
music very long. Although she considers singing her first great
love, Martika would eventually like to concentrate on movies.
   ``I think an actor can grow old a bit more gracefully,'' she
explained. ``I see myself doing pop music while I have the energy
and then getting married and doing one film every year or two.
There are so many parts of me outside of Martika the singer.
There's a real person in here somewhere.''

Could it be h i m? 
</P>
<P>
Gasps of anticipation were heard in the Summit arena here as a man in bright 
yellow Dick Tracy overcoat and hat stepped from the shadows to join Madonna on 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
Could it be Warren Beatty, the star of the upcoming movie about the famous 
comic book detective . . . the man who has been reported for months to be 
Madonna's beau? 
</P>
<P>
After all, this was the opening night of the 12-city U.S. leg of Madonna's 
lavishly designed "Blond Ambition" tour, and the singer-dancer, who plays 
Breathless Mahoney in the film, is better at capitalizing on the moment than 
anyone in pop music. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna was on MTV so much over the weekend that you'd think she was holding 
the cable channel hostage -- and her show 'n' tell escapade with Arsenio Hall 
last week may have been the most electric hour of TV since the debut of "Twin 
Peaks." 
</P>
<P>
Beatty may yet slip into the overcoat and hat on the tour -- maybe even at the 
Los Angeles Sports Arena, where the tour begins a five-night engagement on 
Friday. The Summit audience, however, had to settle just for Beatty's recorded 
voice. The man in the Tracy outfit last Friday was part of Madonna's cast, and 
he merely danced with her as a tape played a Madonna-Beatty duet from her 
upcoming album, which includes songs from the film. 
</P>
<P>
But the buzz in the arena sparked by the possibility of Beatty's presence, 
however, underscored the way Madonna's personal life has become so entwined 
with her professional life. 
</P>
<P>
More than just a star or a performer, Madonna -- in the style of Elvis Presley 
and Michael Jackson -- is above all a Celebrity. The highlight of the show for 
many in the audience is when she walks on stage -- when they have a chance to 
see her in person. 
</P>
<P>
That's what makes Madonna's lastest single, "Vogue," such a terrific piece of 
pop. The record and accompanying video are marvelous expressions of the 
narcissism associated with pop celebrities -- works that mock Madonna's own 
celebrity status while saluting glamour icons from the past. 
</P>
<P>
Sample lines: 
</P>
<P>
 They had style, they had grace 
</P>
<P>
 Rita Hayworth gave good face. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauren, Katharine, Lana, too 
</P>
<P>
 Bette Davis, we love you. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Strike a pose 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing to it. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, Madonna's enormous success is based on her ability to strike the 
best poses. She comes up with a new image and look for every magazine cover, 
not to mention every video. 
</P>
<P>
That continuing preoccupation with appearence can be annoying. But the 
impressive thing about the "Blond Ambition" tour is that the 
singer-actress-dancer doesn't simply rest on celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
Much like Michael and Janet Jackson, Madonna sacrifices the spontaneity of the 
normal rock concert experience for the more carefully choreographed and formal 
presentation of the Broadway theater. 
</P>
<P>
Despite an endless array of costume changes (Madonna doesn't go on the road to 
press the flesh, but to bare it) and a cast of seven male dancers (also 
sometimes outfitted with items from her lingerie closet) and two female back-up 
singers, the most striking thing about the Summit show was how the one-time 
"boy toy" has evolved into such an accomplished entertainer. 
</P>
<P>
The "Blond Ambition" show is even structured with theatrical acts. Act I begins 
with a scene of industrial dreariness, reminiscent of the film "Metropolis." 
The seven bare-chested dancers look like workmen, drained of energy and 
personality. But they come alive as the opening songs, including "Express 
Yourself" and "Where's the Party," invite the audience to forget the day's 
frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
Act II touches on sex and salvation, a familiar pop theme. Madonna -- her hair 
in a severely drawn ponytail throughout show -- moves from the sexual fantasies 
of "Like a Virgin" through the questions of religion and guilt reflected in 
"Like a Prayer." 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood is the backdrop of Act III, which focuses on songs from the upcoming 
album and a good-natured, beauty parlor staging of "Material Girl" inspired by 
'50s movie musicals. The formal part of the show ends, appropriately, with 
"Vogue."

Where Madonna's music is often criticized, quite justifiably, for lacking the 
substance and imagination of pop's most compelling figures, there is an 
uplifting edge to her performance. 
</P>
<P>
Her energy and accomplishments stand as symbols of the ability of one to make 
the most of one's opportunities and talents. She has long seemed blessed with 
blond ambition, but it has never been blind ambition.

<HEAD>Madonna Video Withdrawn After Charges It Is Blasphemous</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The distributors of rock star Madonna's new single,
``Like a Prayer,'' decided not to release the video immediately on
Italian television because of protests from a Roman Catholic group,
news reports said Saturday.
   The conservative Catholic group Famiglia Domani charged the video
was blasphemous, and it threatened to go to court to block the
broadcast, newspapers said.
   The video was to be shown Tuesday on the popular program ``Notte
Rock'' (Rock Night) on state-run RAI television.
   Officials of Madonna's Italian record company, WEA, announced
after a meeting with RAI officials Friday they had decided ``to
suspend the television distribution of this video for some days, to
keep any more controversy from arising.''
   Representatives of Famiglia Domani acknowledged they had not seen
the video, first shown in Italy on Friday at press screenings.
   According to Italian journalists who saw the video, it shows the
following:
   The singer witnesses an attack on a girl by a group of white
boys, who then escape. A black man who arrives on the scene is
accused of the assault.
   Madonna, wearing a slip, seeks refuge in a Baptist church and
pauses before a statue of a black saint, whose face becomes that of
the accused man. The statue cries tears of blood and comes to life.
   The rock singer develops cuts in her hands resembling the wounds
of the crucified body of Jesus.
   Madonna gives the statue a kiss then goes to police and tells
them the accused man is not guilty.
   Several newspapers said the screening should put to rest rumors
the video would show Madonna as a nun romantically involved with a
crucified Christ.
   The Milan daily Corriere della Sera said State Prosecutor Alfredo
Rossini had asked to see a copy of the video Friday. Famiglia Domani
has threatened to seek court action to block broadcast of the video,
newspapers said.
   ``In reality, this scandal should deflate like a bubble,'' the
Rome-based La Repubblica said. ``But we are in Italy, and before a
problem (racism) so ably raised by the puritan moralism of the
Americans, we can be sure that the sexy slip that Madonna wore into
the church will be enough to irritate those who at all costs seek a
public scandal.''

<LEADPARA>  IT'S A real challenge to parody something that's already ridiculous enough to
qualify as self-parody, but comic Julie Brown pulls it off with sirens wailing
in her hilarious sendup of Madonna called "Medusa: Dare to Be Truthful," which
premieres tonight at 10 as a Showtime comedy special.;   The format is a
verite-style rockumentary about pop star Medusa (Brown) during her latest
world tour. Of course, it's really a "mockumentary" version of Madonna's own
1990 film, "Truth or Dare."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     We get to see Medusa as she really is backstage -- Brown suggests she's an
ignorant, sex-driven tyrant, but didn't we already assume that? -- and as she
is while performing some of her biggest hits, including "Party in My Pants."; 
 Brown, the red-headed star of MTV's "Just Say Julie" series, in which she
spoofs the people usually seen on MTV, wears a blond wig and all the
Madonna-esque outfits we've come to know so well. She manages a credible
Madonna-style singing voice and apes the familiar dance routines cleverly
enough to fool casual viewers who may be zooming their way through the
channels with a remote-control device.;   Be forewarned that this is
unreasonably foul and overwhelmingly vulgar. Presumably, that won't bother
Showtime's regular subscribers, who expect their comedy to be pretty rank.;  
Among the high/lowlights:;   (check) Medusa tells us, "I've had sex with
everybody I wanted, except Gorbachev. His wife kept interrupting by coming
into the bathroom.";   (check) Medusa looking into her mirror and posing the
philosophical puzzler: "Am I pretty when there's nobody to see?";   (check)
Medusa complaining, during rehearsal, that the giant phallus she's rising
toward the ceiling on "isn't working.";   That's because this is only the
"rehearsal penis," says road manager Chris Elliott (of Fox's "Get a Life").
"The real penis is still in the shop.";   (check) Medusa performing a rather
personal service for the cinematographer, who won't put down his handheld
camera because, "I don't think we're supposed to do that.";   (check) Medusa
performing before thousands of fans during a volcanic eruption in the
Philippines, then chewing out her staff for not doing a "volcano check" in
advance.;   (check) Medusa declining a dare from the crew to demonstrate her
special lovemaking skills with a banana, but meeting their challenge by
draining the juice, pulp, seeds and rind from a large watermelon.;   (check)
Medusa discussing her next film, in which she plays "Heidi," who's now a
grown-up Nazi skinhead, trying to deal with her sexuality while dancing with
goats.;   (check) Medusa taking us on a tour of her hometown. ("There's the
phone booth where I lost my virginity.");   (check) Medusa arguing with her
temperamental actor ex-husband, Shade Penn, over her creative originality.
(She claims to have dreamed up three original ideas: copying Marilyn Monroe,
grabbing her crotch and grabbing her crotch harder.);   Along the way, Medusa
meets a number of "guests" who play themselves, including Bobcat Goldthwait
and, of all people, game show host Wink Martindale. (He invites her to a party
at his motel room.) Among the others on hand: Carol Leifer and Tom Kenney.;  
We also get to see her in some of her hit videos. Best of them is "Like a
Video (I Want to Play You All the Time)," a delicious parody of Madonna's
"Like a Virgin.";   You may not have thought it possible to make Madonna look
sillier than she already does, but this is a devastating parody that covers
almost all the possibilities. It alternately leaves you limp from laughter and
from abject nausea. Julie Brown deserves at least an ACE award. She may not be
invited to Madonna's next party, but she'll probably have all the other
invitations she'll ever want. (box)  </TEXT>

   Irish pop singer Sinead O'Connor
breezed past American bombshell Madonna for top honors at the
seventh annual MTV Music Video Awards, in a ceremony marked by a
protest against censorship.
   The outspoken O'Connor took video of the year, best female video
and best postmodern video for her stark ``Nothing Compares 2 U''
during the three-hour ceremony broadcast live Thursday night.
   Madonna's ``Vogue'' video won for direction, cinematography and
editing. Madonna, dressed in an 18th century French costume
bursting at the bust, performed a racy version of the video during
the awards show.
   Ex-Eagle Don Henley beat Billy Idol and M.C. Hammer in the best
male video category for ``End of the Innocence.'' But Hammer's ``U
Can't Touch This'' won in rap and dance categories.
   O'Connor's closely cropped head as she sings ``Nothing Compares
2 U'' predominates the winning video. Even when she starts crying,
the camera angle doesn't change.
   O'Connor caused a flap last month when she threatened to walk
out on an audience of 9,000 at the Garden State Arts Center in New
Jersey if the state-owned amphitheater played the national anthem
before her show.
   ``I'd like to say I had a great respect for people of all
countries, including American people,'' she told the sellout MTV
crowd, which gave her a standing ovation.
   ``I don't see aesthetically what national anthems have to do
with any country,'' she said after the ceremony.
   She said the incident taught her to be ``much more conscious of
other people's feelings and not so obsessed with my own.''
   The rap group 2 Live Crew performed ``Banned in the USA,'' a
version of Bruce Springsteen's ``Born in the USA.'' The performance
sparked a dance-fest by audience members who waved bumpers stickers
reading, ``Censorship is UnAmerican.''
   The rappers decried the banning of their explicit ``As Nasty as
They Wanna Be'' album from some record stores.
   ``It's a damn shame. It's racist,'' said lead singer Luther
Campbell.
   It was a disappointing night for last year's big winner, Laker
Girl-turned-megastar Paula Abdul, whose ``Opposites Attract'' video
was shut out, despite six nominations. Last year, Abdul won for
best female, dance, editing and choreography for her ``Straight
Up'' video.
   Michael Penn walked away with the new artist award for his
densely written ``No Myth'' and two older groups enjoying new
success also picked up awards: the B-52's for best group and art
direction for their exuberant ``Love Shack'' and Aerosmith for
metal-hard rock for ``Janie's Got a Gun.''
   Janet Jackson, sister of pop icon Michael Jackson, was named in
advance as the recipient of the 1990 Video Vanguard award, MTV's
highest honor.
   Noted more for onstage drawing power than historical
significance, the MTV Awards were broadcast live on the Music
Television cable channel from the Universal Amphitheater.
   Emceed by late-night talk-show host Arsenio Hall, the show's
lineup also included on-stage performances by Aerosmith, Jackson,
World Party, O'Connor and a one-time reunion of New Edition.
   Last year, comedian Andrew Dice Clay was forever banned from MTV
for delivering a routine laden with obscene and unprintable poems
about sex and overweight women during the video awards show.

<HEAD>Madonna, Sean Penn to Divorce</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pop singer Madonna has filed for divorce to
end her turbulent three-year marriage to actor Sean Penn, a
spokesman for her record label said.
   ``I assume (the divorce was filed) in Los Angeles,'' Warner Bros.
spokesman Bob Merlis said Thursday. He did not say when she made the
filing.
   ``It is true,'' said John West, a spokesman for Penn. ``Sean and
Madonna are separated. They plan to divorce and it's amicable.''
   The announcement follows a nullified divorce filing from late
1987 and several well-publicized fights involving the hot-tempered
Penn, one of which led to a 60-day prison term. Divorce rumors have
been swirling around the couple in recent months.
   Madonna rose to fame with her hits ``Borderline'' and ``Like a
Virgin,'' and is perhaps best known by the title of another song,
``Material Girl.'' She has also starred in the movie ``Desperately
Seeking Susan'' and David Mamet's Broadway play, ``Speed-the-Plow.''
   Penn, who has starred in the movies ``Colors'' and ``The Falcon
and the Snowman,'' is appearing in Los Angeles in ``Hurlyburly,'' a
play about Hollywood decadence. A spokesman for the play, Jay
Schwartz, said Penn would complete the play's run to Jan. 15.
   The couple married in August 1985 in a Malibu ocean-bluff
ceremony that was buzzed by press photographers in helicopters. They
starred together in the flop 1986 film ``Shanghai Surprise,'' in
which Madonna played a missionary smuggling opium in the Orient.
   The pugnacious Penn served more than half of a 60-day prison term
in 1987 for violating parole by punching a movie extra. At the time,
he was on probation for fighting a man he accused of trying to kiss
Madonna in a nightclub in April 1986.
   In an interview that year, he spoke fondly of his wife. ``Nothing
that I could possibly come up with is as important as her,'' he
said. ``No movie, nothing is as important as her. And that's about
the best answer I can give.''

POP EYE: MADONNA VIDEO WILL STEAM UP STORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN

<TEXT>
<P>
They don't call her the Material Girl for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Just hours after learning that MTV had refused to air her new "Justify My Love" 
video, Madonna and her record label, Warner Bros. Records, were following the 
classic marketing maxim: If you have a lemon, make lemonade. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than submit the steamy clip to other TV outlets, the Madonna/Warners 
team has decided to take advantage of the budding controversy by selling the 
video. Warners/Reprise Video will release the "Justify My Love" clip Dec. 18, 
making it the first video single ever marketed as a home video. A Warners 
spokesman said that the label will probably price it at $9.98. 
</P>
<P>
Industry cynics, who have seen Madonna cleverly court controversy in the past, 
wonder if the shrewd pop seductress had planned to sell her clip all along, 
hoping that sales would be fueled by media coverage of the MTV ban. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, says Warners publicity chief Bob Merlis."The plan to sell the clip only 
came about after we learned MTV wouldn't program the video." Speaking through a 
Warners spokeswoman, Madonna would only say: "This is my interpretation of my 
song. I think it's a very romantic video and I felt I was exercising my freedom 
of speech and expression." 
</P>
<P>
The flap came at a particularly awkward time for MTV, which had planned to 
debut the new clip during its much-ballyhooed Madonna-thon this weekend. 
Officially, all MTV would say was: "We respect Madonna's work and think she 
makes great videos. But this one is not for us." 
</P>
<P>
MTV execs said that the clip was rejected by its standards committee, which 
previews all new videos -- and customarily requests artists to edit or trim 
objectionable scenes. However the committee apparently found the Madonna clip 
so provocative that no amount of editing would make it acceptable. "This 
decision went all the way to the top," said one staffer. "There was no way we 
could even edit this. I can't believe Madonna ever thought we could air it." 
</P>
<P>
What are we missing? Since Warners wouldn't send us the clip, Pop Eye talked to 
several insiders who had seen the video, which was directed by video wiz 
Jean-Baptiste Mondino (who did Madonna's "Open Your Heart" clip) and co-stars 
Tony Ward, Madonna's current paramour. 
</P>
<P>
The clip begins with a trench-coated Madonna entering a hotel hallway, carrying 
a suitcase. As she begins to writhe along with the song's rhythms, she is 
joined by her boyfriend, who begins smooching with her. They quickly retire to 
a nearby bedroom, where they make love (he's shirtless, she's clad only in a 
bra and panties) amid a series of racy fantasy scenes. After considerable 
footage featuring various erotic poses and apparent sex, the clip ends with 
Madonna, giggling with pleasure, fleeing the hotel, suitcase in hand. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very sexually ambiguous video," one observer said. "You see women you 
think are men, women with painted-on mustaches. You see Madonna making love 
with her boyfriend and then kissing another woman, while he watches them. There 
are orgy-type fantasy scenes, where you see people in S&amp;M-style clothing 
and a woman in suspenders with her breasts exposed. Some people will probably 
say it's really wild. I just got the feeling Madonna had been watching too many 
Zalman King movies." 
</P>
<P>
Will the video sell? "Madonna fans tend to want everything -- they'll 
definitely pay $10 for the new video, especially if it's controversial," said 
Tower Video store manager Jay Smith. "Right now she's very hot. We had about 
200 copies of her video collection and went right through the whole initial 
shipment."

   Actress-singer Madonna and actor Sean
Penn apparently have reached an amicable agreement to end their
stormy three-year marriage and divide their property, court records
show.
   A divorce petition filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court
cited irreconcilable differences and seeks restoration of the pop
singer's former name, Madonna Ciccone.
   It also said community property and financial obligations shared
by the couple ``have been disposed of by written agreement.'' No
details were disclosed in the two-page petition filed Jan. 25.
   Madonna publicist Liz Rosenberg said last week Penn would get the
couple's Malibu home and the singer would keep their New York
apartment. Madonna recently bought a $2.9 million Hollywood Hills
home.
   ``That's it,'' Penn publicist Lois Smith said Wednesday. ``She
kept one and he kept the other.''
   The divorce action follows a Dec. 28 incident in which Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputies were called to the
couple's Malibu home after the hot-tempered Penn allegedly beat
Madonna. No charges were filed.

   Former heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad
Ali is taking on K mart Corp. and another company for knockout
stakes over an order of shoe polish.
   Muhammad Ali Champion Brand Co., owned by the ex-fighter, is
suing K mart and Melville Corp. for allegedly balking on a contract
for shoe polish and failing to sell the polish in 500 stores,
according to motorcycle stunt driver Evel Knievel, a spokesman for
Ali and senior vice president of his company.
   ``They only put it in about 60 stores. That's a breach of
promise,'' said Knievel. ``I don't know why they would do that.''
   The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, seeks $550
million in damages, as well as $30,000 for attorney's fees and money
owed to creditors.
   Arthur Morrison, the attorney for Ali's company, said K mart and
Melville backed out on their order when the Muhammad Ali shoe polish
was delivered.
   Arthur Richards, general counsel for Melville in Harrison, N.Y.,
refused to comment.
   Orren F. Knauer, director of investor relations at K mart's Troy,
Mich., home office, said nobody was available to comment.

   A sculptor is preparing to unveil the
life-size likenesses of rock legends Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and
J.P. Richardson, a.k.a. the Big Bopper, 30 years after they died in
a plane crash.
   ``It looks good,'' J.P. Richardson III, the Bopper's son, said of
photos he's seen of the sculpture by Port Arthur artist Doug Clark.
   Richardson, 29, of Houston, and other members of the Holly and
Valens families were invited to a reception Thursday night to get
their first look at a sculpture of the Bopper, who sang the classic
``Chantilly Lace,'' and a companion bronze of Richardson with his
arms around Holly and Valens, of ``La Bamba'' fame.
   Clark said the latter work is intended to show the trio as if
they were standing for a picture just before boarding the fateful
flight on Feb. 3, 1959, from Clear Lake, Iowa, to Fargo, N.D.
   Jiles Perry Richardson Jr. gained fame in southeast Texas as a
disc jockey in nearby Beaumont and as a club performer.

   An attorney for Johnny Paycheck has asked
for a delay in the country singer's resentencing for the 1985 tavern
shooting of another man.
   Paycheck, 50, was convicted May 17, 1986, of aggravated assault
and tampering with evidence in the Dec. 19, 1985, shooting of Larry
Wise in a Hillsboro tavern. Wise was grazed in the forehead,
recovered and testified against Paycheck.
   The singer, best known for his song, ``Take this Job and Shove
It,'' has remained free while appealing his conviction and has been
doing concerts, lawyer Ralph Buss said Wednesday.
   Buss said he asked the Ohio Supreme Court on Wednesday to forbid
lower courts from taking any action in the case until the high court
rules on Paycheck's argument that a mandatory three-year prison
sentence for use of a firearm during a crime was imposed improperly.
   If the Supreme Court agrees, it would delay Paycheck's
resentencing scheduled for Monday in Highland County Common Pleas
Court.

<HEAD>Pepsi Expects 250 Million Worldwide Will See New Ad With Madonna</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pepsi-Cola Co. hopes to reach a worldwide
television audience of 250 million today as its two-minute
commercial with pop singer Madonna makes its debut in 40 countries
from Turkey to Thailand.
   The commercial, which will be aired in the United States on NBC
during the top-rated ``The Cosby Show,'' also marks the first public
airing of Madonna's new song ``Like a Prayer,'' an unusual forum for
a song's debut.
   Pepsi officials, who previewed the commercial for reporters
Wednesday, said they tried to place the ad on the top-rated evening
show in each country.
   They refused, however, to disclose how much it cost to produce
the ad, to hire Madonna or to buy the advertising time.
   The commercial will appear first in Japan and follow the time
zones around the world before finishing on the West Coast of the
United States.
   The commercial opens with Madonna watching a grainy home movie of
her eighth birthday party, where she gets a new doll and sips on a
bottle of Pepsi.
   As the spot unfolds, the little girl in the movie and the
grown-up pop singer trade places.
   As she sings her new song, Madonna finds herself dancing with a
group of teens on the street, with uniformed school children at a
grade school and finally in a church where a gospel choir sings with
her.
   Those shots are mixed with glimpses of the little girl, played by
8-year-old actress Heidi Marshall, exploring Madonna's apartment,
finding clues to what her life will be like when she gets older.
   When the little girl finds her alter ego still has the doll she
was given on her eighth birthday, she looks back at the screen and
trades places with the singer once again.
   Madonna, back in her chair watching the movie, raises a Pepsi can
and offers a toast to the birthday girl: ``Go ahead, make a wish.''
   Bill Katz, an account executive for Pepsi's advertising agency,
BBDO, said the ad will be edited into 60-second and 30-second
versions for subsequent showings.
   It was directed by Joe Pytka, whose work for Pepsi has included
commercials featuring singer Michael Jackson and actor Michael J.
Fox.
   Pepsi long has used pop singers in trying to create a youthful,
energetic image for the soft drink, which trails only Coca-Cola in
the soft drink market.
   It is breaking ground by launching a singer's new release in its
commercial. With Michael Jackson, Pepsi waited until his songs were
at the peak of their popularity before launching commericals
featuring them.
   Madonna's single of ``Like a Prayer'' is scheduled to be released
Tuesday, followed two weeks later by her new album. A music video
that differs from the ad is slated to debut Friday on MTV: Music
Television, the cable TV music channel.
   Katz said Pepsi is confident that the song will be a hit and said
other performers may decide to launch songs on commercials after
seeing the Pepsi ad.

Madonna is frequently in the tabloids. Stigmata sightings are frequently in the 
tabloids. So the purportedly shocking imagery of the pop singer's controversial 
new video clip "Like a Prayer" could be Weekly World News' dream come true: 
Madonna Bears Stigmata. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to early reports, however, Madonna does not make love to a Christ 
figure in thevideo. Wrong dream sequence. (Where was she when Marty Scorsese 
needed her?) 
</P>
<P>
Whatever is or isn't in this highly stylized clip -- which is currently airing 
exclusively on MTV -- the key question in the wake of the uproars over "The 
Last Temptation of Christ" and "The Satanic Verses" will no doubt be: Is the 
video blasphemous? 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't even come close. It's a secular love song that has no more to do 
with religion than "Like a Virgin" had to do with virginity. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the imagery in the video isn't very much designed to be provocative 
and irreverent. 
</P>
<P>
So far as it's possible to tell amid all the symbolism and jump-editing, the 
racism-related story line goes something like this: Clad in revealing lingerie, 
Madonna enters an empty church where she is drawn to a statue of a young black 
man robed in white -- a saint or a martyr, perhaps? -- behind bars. She lies 
down on a pew and is apparently overcome by a vision, while the statue comes to 
life. 
</P>
<P>
In this vision, the scenario of a recent crime is unveiled before her: A group 
of white thugs attacks and stabs a white woman, but a black man who comes to 
her aid is arrested. Madonna is then awakened from her vision by a raucous 
black choir marching through the church. She trots down to the local jail, 
where she vouches for the jailed man's innocence before the police -- who 
presumably believe the fever dream of a woman who is standing at the sergeant's 
desk wearing only a brassiere and a slip. 
</P>
<P>
That's the story line, but there's more -- much more -- that could conceivably 
shock or offend. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna sings in front of a field of burning crosses. Madonna handles the 
murder weapon, a knife, and suddenly is supernaturally afflicted with bleeding 
nail wounds in her palms. Madonna does an uninhibited, giddy little dance with 
a gospel troupe, and at one point gets down on her knees while a choir member 
puts a hand on Madonna's forehead, faith healer-style. Rather than fall 
backward from the healing touch, Madonna appears as if she might be about to 
fall out of her bra. 
</P>
<P>
Are the protesters lined up yet? 
</P>
<P>
Madonna would no doubt argue that her detractors exaggerate the video's sexual 
content, which is minimal if you don't count immodesty of dress. 
</P>
<P>
She wants to show that she can amply display her hourglass figure and still be 
a complete innocent, guiltlessly joining a choir in a place of worship at the 
happy finale with a childlike glee. Indeed, she even dances with a little boy 
-- a scene reminiscent of her superior video a few years back for "Open Your 
Heart," in which, playing a stripper, she danced off into the sunset with a 
young boy. 
</P>
<P>
For video aficionados, "Like a Prayer" is heartening for its bold use of a 
narrative approach -- something seen less and less of late. At its best, the 
conceptual pop video can serve as a resurrection of the silent film, telling 
stories without dialogue, as here. 
</P>
<P>
But how clever is the story being told? At its core, "Like a Prayer" is a 
rather basic redemptive tale, one perhaps bogged down more than buoyed by its 
weighty and often gratuitous symbolism. It's an attention-grabber with some 
nice cinematic touches, but the only viewers it's likely to truly move are 
those whose hands reflexively jerk toward phones or picket signs at the 
slightest provocation. 
</P>
<P>
Which may be part of the idea.

LIZ SMITH: 'JUSTIFY MY LOVE' VIDEO FEATURES MADONNA'S NEW GUY 
</P>

<P>
MADONNA IS in Paris getting ready to begin making the video of her new single, 
"Justify My Love." This is one of two fresh songs on her greatest-hits 
compilation titled "Immaculate Collection." 
</P>
<P>
The star co-wrote this song with Lenny Kravitz, a guy who knows a lot about 
controversial women. (He is wed to "Cosby" kid Lisa Bonet.) Madonna's husky 
rendition of the song isn't something one would get up and dance to -- recline 
to, maybe. "Justify My Love" is to be directed by Jean Baptiste Mondino, who 
put the blond one through her paces for the "Open Your Heart" video in which 
she played a peep-show dancer. 
</P>
<P>
The singer's new steady guy, Tony Ward, will have a prominent role in the 
video. He could be the reason Madonna's faction is saying that "Justify My 
Love" will be Madonna's "sexiest and most romantic video ever." But don't 
"they" always say something like that? All I know about Tony Ward is that he is 
like a taller, darker, sexier version of Sean Penn and said to be a very sweet 
person. 
</P>
<P>
SO, WHY, with all this plush hype, didn't Madonna show up at Glamour magazine's 
big "Ten Women of the Year" awards for 1990, or send a representative? Insiders 
claim it was because Glamour's art department retouched Madonna's teeth, 
filling in the gaps in their cover photo. And SHE didn't like that one bit. 
Glamour described the star as "personifying women's power of 
self-determination." You got that right. 
</P>
<P>
ANJELICA HUSTON is startlingly blond in her new movie, "The Grifters," and the 
dark beauty says she enjoys the change. She explains: "Wearing the blond wig 
immediately made me feel different. . . . As a blonde I got a kind of 'halo' 
effect. But I was a serious, no-nonsense blonde. Sometime though, I'd like to 
be one of those real fun blondes." 
</P>
<P>
"The Grifters" has some good word-of-mouth and opens for one week in December 
to make it eligible for the Academy Awards.

<HEAD>Pepsi Drops Ads Featuring Madonna After Video Creates Controversy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An uproar over the religious imagery in
Madonna's ``Like a Prayer'' music video has doomed the
entertainer's Pepsi commercials.
   Pepsi-Cola Co. confirmed Tuesday it is dropping the ads even
though the soft drink maker had no connection with the music video,
which some groups found sacrilegious.
   Pepsi's decision is similar to a recent series of incidents in
which corporations have bowed to pressure from consumers and
religious activists over corporate sponsorship of programs the
critics deem objectionable.
   Spokesman Tod MacKenzie said Pepsi heard from consumers who
complained about the music video because they thought it was
Pepsi's commercial. Both the commercial and the video featured the
same Madonna song, ``Like A Prayer.''
   ``It's an unfortunate situation,'' he said.
   Marty Blackman, head of a New York-based consulting firm that
advises businesses on the use of celebrities, said Pepsi should
have known Madonna would prove controversial.
   ``This was a personality controversial enough that you know you
have to do your homework, your research and it wasn't done,'' he
said.
   But Jesse Meyers, who publishes Beverage Digest in Greenwich,
Conn., said he found it sad that any group can ``dictate to a
consumer goods company what they can and can't do.''
   The Pepsi commercial featuring Madonna was run only twice in the
United States in early March.
   The ad, which featured the first public airing of her song
``Like a Prayer,'' made its debut March 2 in 40 countries. It ran a
second time in the U.S. on a late-night show March 3 and continues
to run overseas, where there have been no complaints of confusion
of the ad and the video, MacKenzie said.
   Pepsi had planned to cut the two-minute ad into shorter versions
for replay here after Madonna's song built a following.
   But in scrapping those plans, Pepsi joined several companies
that have altered advertising plans after consumers blamed
advertisers for the moral content of broadcasts.
   Ralston Purina Co., Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Tambrands Inc. and
others recently either have cancelled ads or instructed their ad
agencies not to buy more time on shows after consumers objected to
the programs' content. Two shows in particular that prompted
protests are NBC's ``Saturday Night Live'' and Fox Broadcasting
Network's ``Married ... With Children.''
   The trend has alarmed some constitutional rights advocates, who
say advertisers are opening the door to even more activism by
self-styled moral advocates and to self-censorship by programmers
who may want to avoid a fight.
   But Pepsi's case is somewhat unique because it was blamed for
something it did not produce.
   The Pepsi ad featuring Madonna, titled ``Make a Wish,'' showed
the singer posing as a woman watching an old home movie of her
eighth birthday party.
   The woman and the child traded places in the commercial, with
Madonna singing ``Like a Prayer'' and dancing in school and in a
church while the youngster browsed through the woman's apartment.
   Pepsi said it created the ad without ever seeing the music video
that accompanied the release of the ``Like a Prayer'' single.
   The music video, released a day after the ad ran, showed a woman
assisting a man wrongly accused of a crime. Madonna kisses a statue
that comes to life, dances among burning crosses and is afflicted
with cuts on her hand resembling the wounds Christians believe
Jesus Christ suffered during crucifixion.
   A Mississippi-based religious group, the American Family
Association, and the bishop of Corpus Christi, Texas, separately
called for one-year boycotts of Pepsi products because of the
video's imagery.
   Both boycotts were called off last week after Pepsi officials
told the bishop and the AFA it planned to discontinue using the
singer in its ads.
   The Rev. Donald Wildmon of the AFA said Pepsi also planned to
withdraw its sponsorship of a Madonna concert tour, but Pepsi had
no comment on that. Pepsi reportedly paid Madonna about $5 million
under a one-year contract that included commercials and the tour.
   Liz Rosenberg, a publicist for Madonna at Warner Bros. Records,
said the singer had no comment on Pepsi's action.

<TEXT>
   Madonna, the pop singer turned actress,
celebrated her 30th birthday with a Broadway stage performance and
a private party with her actor-husband, Sean Penn, and other guests.
   But Tuesday's celebrations were continuing today, Penn's 28th
birthday and the couple's third anniversary.
   ``Despite all the predictions, they're still together,'' said
publicist Liz Rosenberg.
   Madonna is working in the Broadway production of David Mamet's
``Speed-the-Plow,'' playing the secretary of a hard-boiled
Hollywood producer.
   ``She has never missed a performance in her life, so 30th
birthday or not, she'll be on stage,'' Ms. Rosenberg said before
Tuesday night's performance.
   Madonna and Penn planned to entertain a celebrity group of
birthday partygoers after the performance, but kept the invitation
list secret, her publicist said.
   Madonna, born Madonna Louise Ciccone, has produced the hit
singles ``Material Girl'' and ``Papa Don't Preach.'' She also has
starred in such films as ``Who's That Girl'' and ``Desperately
Seeking Susan.''
   The couple, known as much for their run-ins with star-gazing
photographers as for their entertainment work, maintain a home in
Malibu, Calif., where they are often seen doing their own grocery
shopping or stopping for hamburgers.

POP BEAT LASER BIN: PIONEER HAS AMBITIONS FOR MADONNA CONCERT DISC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can Madonna sell laser-disc players as well as she sells herself? 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer Artists, the nation's leading distributor of music-related laser discs, 
hopes so. 
</P>
<P>
In a move virtually unprecedented in the video industry, Pioneer has just 
released Madonna's "Blond Ambition World Tour Live" exclusively on laser disc. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, video packages of this nature are released on videocassette two to 
six weeks before they are released on laser disc. In this case, however, "Blond 
Ambition" won't be released on videocassette for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Galloway, president of Pioneer Artists, said he hopes the fact that an 
artist of Madonna's stature would release a video only on laser disc will send 
a signal to millions of potential laser customers that the new format has 
finally come of age. 
</P>
<P>
Because laser discs offer substantially better picture and sound quality than 
videocassettes, there have been predictions for years that laser discs will 
eventually capture a large share of the prerecorded video market, much the way 
that its sister format the compact disc has become a major force in the album 
market. But it hasn't happened yet. 
</P>
<P>
Though the price of laser players has fallen dramatically in recent years (now 
less than $400 in some combination models that play CDs and lasers), there are 
still fewer than 500,000 players in homes around the country -- a statistic 
that has left laser manufacturers understandably frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the public's slowness to move into laser-disc players is that, 
unlike videocassette machines, you cannot yet make your own laser recordings 
with home laser equipment. Still, it is so much more fun to watch a movie or 
music program, such as "Blond Ambition," on laser disc that almost everyone 
exposed to the format becomes a salesperson for it. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, these converts hold on to their VCRs to record programs off 
television the same way pop fans keep their tape decks for specialized uses 
even after they've begun buying most of their new albums on compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
Galloway said that the laser exclusive with Madonna grew out of an agreement 
last spring for Pioneer, the electronics hardware and software giant, to 
sponsor her tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I contacted her manager, Freddy DeMann, long before the tour started in hopes 
of getting the laser-disc rights to any video that was going to be shot in 
association with the tour," Galloway said. DeMann was meeting with potential 
corporate sponsors at the time, Galloway said, and he asked if Pioneer would be 
interested in sponsoring the tour. The company apparently jumped at the 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"Madonna is the ideal artist to reach the new demographics that we are hoping 
to attract with the new, low-priced combination CD and laser players . . . the 
young, hip 18-35 audience," Galloway said. 
</P>
<P>
"Until these low-priced players arrived, laser discs were considered something 
just for the high-end market . . . a rich man's toy. But that has changed and 
Madonna seemed the ideal artist to drive that point home." 
</P>
<P>
And what about the "Blond Ambition" package itself? 
</P>
<P>
The video is based on the same concert in Nice that HBO broadcast live last 
summer, but the new, edited laser version offers much more of the vitality and 
charm of the show itself than the HBO special. 
</P>
<P>
At just $29.95 for a two-hour concert program, the laser disc is also a much 
better buy than the five-minute "Justify My Love," the much-ado-about-nothing 
video single that sells for $9.98. 
</P>
<P>
It's still hard to believe that a program as distinguished as "Nightline" would 
devote an entire half-hour to showing the video and asking Madonna the same 
question 22 different ways: "Haven't you finally gone too far?" 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing in "Blond Ambition" that is likely to earn the singer a return 
appearance on "Nightline" -- though it is interesting to see how the mock 
masturbation sequence during "Like a Virgin" appears to have been a model for 
the bedroom fantasies outlined in "Justify My Love." 
</P>
<P>
What "Blond Ambition" does, however, is show that Madonna isn't just a 
masterful pop strategist. She's also someone with considerable imagination and 
talent. She's not a great singer or writer, but she infuses her music and her 
concerts with a sense of personality, spirit and, yes, ideas. 
</P>
<P>
A few of the sequences in "Blond Ambition" are silly and self-conscious, but 
most are witty and engaging, making it an especially winning package.

<TEXT>
   The MTV Music Video Awards, not
noted for their cultural significance, produced a curious mixture
of censorship protests and upset victories at their seventh annual
ceremony.
   Irish pop singer Sinead O'Connor breezed past American bombshell
Madonna during Thursday night's three-hour show and took top video,
best female video and the postmodern awards for her stark ``Nothing
Compares 2 U.''
   Madonna, who performed a racy version of her ``Vogue'' video
dressed in an 18th century French costume bursting at the bust, won
for direction, cinematography and editing _ none of which go to her.
   O'Connor created a flap last month when she threatened to walk
out on an audience of 9,000 at the Garden State Arts Center in New
Jersey if the state-owned arena played the national anthem before
her show.
   ``I'd like to say I had a great respect for people of all
countries, including American people,'' she told the sellout crowd
at the Universal Amphitheatre, which gave her a standing ovation.
   ``My attitude over the national anthem was in order to draw
attention to the censorship issue,'' she added. ``When it's racism
disguised as censorship it's even worse.''
   The group 2 Live Crew performed ``Banned in the USA,'' a rap
version of Bruce Springsteen's ``Born in the USA,'' which sparked a
dancefest by audience members waving bumper stickers reading,
``Censorship is UnAmerican.''
   The rappers, whose ``As Nasty as They Want To Be'' album has
been banned by some record stores, called the reaction to their
explicit music racist.
   ``It's a damn shame. It's racist,'' said lead singer Luther
Campbell.
   Ex-Eagle Don Henley beat Billy Idol and M.C. Hammer in the best
male video category for ``End of the Innocence.'' But M.C. Hammer's
``U Can't Touch This'' won in rap and dance categories.
   Janet Jackson won the 1990 Video Vanguard award, MTV's highest
honor. The sister of pop icon Michael Jackson is the first woman to
have the five highest spots on the Billboard charts with cuts from
a single album.
   Aerosmith, which won the metal-hard rock award, also won an
unofficial ``viewer's choice'' honor, in which members of the TV
audience telephoned a 900-number to declare their favorite group.
   Here's a list of the winners of the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards:
   VIDEO OF THE YEAR: ``Nothing Compares 2 U,'' Sinead O'Connor.
   MALE VIDEO: ``The End of the Innocence,'' Don Henley.
   FEMALE VIDEO: ``Nothing Compares 2 U,'' Sinead O'Connor.
   GROUP VIDEO: ``Love Shack,'' B-52's.
   METAL-HARD ROCK VIDEO: ``Janie's Got a Gun,'' Aerosmith.
   NEW ARTIST IN A VIDEO: Michael Penn, ``No Myth''.
   VIDEO FROM A FILM: ``Cradle of Love,'' Billy Idol.
   RAP: ``U Can't Touch This,'' M.C. Hammer.
   DANCE: ``U Can't Touch This,'' M.C. Hammer.
   POST-MODERN: ``Nothing Compares 2 U,'' Sinead O'Connor.
   BREAKTHROUGH VIDEO: ``Sowing the Seeds of Love,'' Tears for
Fears.
   DIRECTION: ``Vogue,'' David Fincher.
   CHOREOGRAPHY: ``Rhythm Nation,'' Anthony Thomas, Janet Jackson.
   SPECIAL EFFECTS: ``Sowing the Seeds of Love,'' Jim Blashfield.
   ART DIRECTION: ``Love Shack,'' Martin Lasowitz.
   EDITING: ``Vogue,'' Jim Haygood.
   CINEMATOGRAPHY: ``Vogue,'' Pascal Lebeque.

   Pepsi-Cola Co. said Wednesday it had signed pop
star Madonna for a global ad campaign that industry watchers said
would chart virgin waters by debuting a song in a television
commercial.
   Pepsi _ firing the latest volley in the newly escalating
marketing war with Coca-Cola Co. _ also will sponsor a planned world
tour by the actress-singer later in 1989 after the release of
Madonna's first album in three years, ``Like A Prayer.''
   The Madonna announcement comes on the heels of industry leader
Coke's new ad campaign aimed at pushing sales of Diet Coke past
Pepsi, currently second in the market behind Coke Classic. That
effort marks the first time a major diet soda has squared off
directly against a leading sugared competitor, signaling a new
intensity in the years-old cola wars.
   Coke earlier this month signed pop singer George Michael for a
series of Diet Coke commercials, on top of a campaign already
featuring hockey star Wayne Gretzky, model Elle MacPherson and
``Miami Vice'' star Don Johnson, a one-time Pepsi pitchman.
   ``What's obviously shaping up is George Michael and Diet Coke
versus Madonna and sugar Pepsi,'' Coca Cola USA spokesman Anthony
Tortorici said. ``Frankly, we like those odds.''
   Terms of the Madonna contract were not disclosed, but if history
is any guide the deal with the brash singer of ``Like A Virgin'' and
star of the movie ``Desperately Seeking Susan'' should be in the
millions.
   Pepsi's award-winning ad campaigns featuring pop music began in
1984, when the number two soft-drink company signed Michael Jackson
and his brothers to a $5.5 million, one-year deal that was the
largest of its kind at the time.
   Two years later, Pepsi signed Jackson for a reported $10 million
to develop commercials over a three-year period. Rock stars Tina
Turner, David Bowie, Lionel Ritchie and the Miami Sound Machine also
have appeared in Pepsi ads.
   ``Pepsi has really pioneered the entire music marketing
phenomenon,'' Pepsi USA spokesman Tod MacKenzie said. ``People
expect us to be on top of what's new, what's hot and what's next.
Madonna is next.''
   ``I think we set the trend and others have followed,'' he said.
   Modeled as mini music videos, the Pepsi ads have taken the common
tactic of celebrity promotions a step further by using popular songs
as the center of a direct sales pitch.
   The Madonna deal adds another twist: using a commercial to debut
a song aimed at a popular audience.
   Pepsi said the title track to ``Like A Prayer'' would be heard
publicly for the first time in a commercial to be aired in prime
time early next month. The single is scheduled for release March 3
with the album to follow March 15, Warner Bros. spokesman Bob Merlis
said.
   ``I don't recall anyone orchestrating the debut of a new record
in a TV commercial,'' said Ken Barnes, editor of Radio and Records,
a music industry trade publication in Los Angeles. ``It's a new
stage in the marriage between commerce and the arts.''
   Barnes said pop songs long have emerged from commercials _
including the Carpenters' ``We've Only Just Begun,'' originally a
bank ad, and the recent British single ``The First Time'' by Robin
Beck, which was spun off a Coke commercial.
   ``But gearing an actual planned commercial release for a TV spot
I think is a new approach,'' he said.
   Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, and Pepsi-Cola, based in Somers,
N.Y., dominate the $43.2 billion U.S. soft-drink business.
   According to the industry newsletter Beverage Digest, Coke
Classic topped all brands last year with 20.1 percent of domestic
sales. Pepsi was second with 18.7 percent, followed by Diet Coke at
8.2 percent and Diet Pepsi at 5.2 percent.

PEPSICO BACKS USE OF VIDEO IN AD CAMPAIGN

PepsiCo. said Tuesday that it stands behind its controversial Madonna 
advertising campaign. Despite the religious and sexual nature of the singer's 
new "Like a Prayer" video, from which portions of a much-publicized Pepsi 
commercial have been drawn, the firm said it has no plans to kill its ads or 
pull them from broadcasters airing the video. 
</P>
<P>
Tod MacKenzie, a Pepsi spokesman, disputed news reports that the company had 
pulled the ads from broadcast, saying that the response to the campaign "has 
been overwhelmingly positive." 
</P>
<P>
MacKenzie's statement followed two days of confusing and often conflicting 
reports regarding the Madonna video and commercial. 
</P>
<P>
The Reuters news agency had reported Monday that Pepsi was withdrawing the ad, 
and quoted Pepsi spokeswoman Becky Madeira as saying that the Madonna video 
"could be misinterpreted by a lot of people to be offensive" and that the 
company would "not advertise on any program that carries the . . . video." 
</P>
<P>
Those reports, which were widely reported by broadcasters and other newspapers, 
were incorrect, MacKenzie said, but he refused to comment further on the 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Pepsi officials met to discuss the Madonna situation on Tuesday 
and reaffirmed their support of her and the advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
MacKenzie said Madonna's flashy two-minute commercial, which debuted in the 
United States last Thursday during NBC's perennially top-rated "The Cosby 
Show," would be aired again, but that no dates had been officially scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial was shown in 40 countries during the opening day of the 
advertising campaign, Pepsi said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pepsi spokesman also said the nature of the video in no way threatens the 
one-year endorsement deal between the soda company and Madonna -- reportedly 
secured to the tune of $5 million and including highly visible support of a 
world-wide concert tour that may begin in summer or fall. 
</P>
<P>
"This (deal) is a separate project (from Madonna's other singing and acting 
ventures)," MacKenzie said, stressing that Pepsi representatives had not seen 
the full video before the premiere of the commercial. "We would not presume to 
be involved with the rest of her career." 
</P>
<P>
A weekend wire service story said protests from a small Catholic organization 
in Italy prompted Italian state television network RAI and Madonna's Italian 
record company, WEA, not to air the video in Italy. But on Monday, Liz 
Rosenberg, a spokeswoman for Warner Bros. Records in the United States, said 
that was not the case and that the video had been shown to Italian broadcasters 
who found no reason not to air it. According to Rosenberg, the clip would begin 
airing in Italy within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
As of Tuesday, neither Warner Bros. nor MTV -- which has exclusive U.S. 
broadcast rights to the video for two weeks -- had received any calls 
protesting the video, and both said there were never any plans to cease 
broadcasts of the video. According to MTV spokeswoman Carol Robinson, the Pepsi 
ad (which uses non-controversial parts of the video) was not airing on MTV, but 
other Pepsi commercials were running as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Rev. Donald Wildmon, executive director of the Tupelo, 
Miss.-based American Family Association and one of the most vocal protesters 
against the movie "The Last Temptation of Christ," told The Times that he 
anticipated no organized protest against the video. 
</P>
<P>
"This (video) is only one little narrow piece of a big pie," said Wildmon, who 
had not seen the clip, but had read descriptions of its use of religious and 
sexual images. "I'm not saying it's not offensive. It is offensive. But we 
don't plan on making a crusade of it." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview printed in the current issue of Rolling Stone magazine, Madonna 
does not address the video itself, but discusses her feelings about religion 
and her Catholic upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she prays, the singer-actress said: "Constantly. I pray when I'm in 
trouble or when I'm happy. When I feel any sort of extreme. I pray when I feel 
so great that I'll think I need to check in with myself and recognize how good 
life is. I know that sounds silly. But when it seems there's so much bull 
around, it's important to just remind myself of the things I have to be 
grateful for. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, when I'm feeling really bad or sad, I pray to try to 
reassure myself. It's all kind of rationalization. I can't describe the way I 
pray. It has nothing to do with religion." 
</P>
<P>
She also said that she did not think she would raise any children she may have 
as Catholics, but still feels the faith to be an important part of her: 
</P>
<P>
"Once you're a Catholic, you're always a Catholic -- in terms of your feelings 
of guilt and remorse and whether you've sinned or not. Sometimes I'm wracked 
with guilt when I needn't be, and that, to me is left over from my Catholic 
upbringing. Because in Catholicism you are born a sinner and you are a sinner 
all of your life. No matter how you try to get away from it, the sin is within 
you all the time."

Two lines in a Wednesday news report on the controversy surrounding pop singer 
Madonna's "Like a Prayer" video were inadvertently dropped from a paragraph, 
which resulted in an inaccurate statement from a PepsiCo spokesman that it had 
withdrawn its Madonna ads. The paragraph, which dealt with conflicting news 
reports about the soft drink company's support of the singer since the video's 
premiere last Friday, should have read that those reports were incorrect.

LIZ SMITH: MADONNA TRIES CHANGE OF FACE IN NEW VIDEO

WHO NEEDS hit movies? That's what I say after getting an advance peek at 
Madonna's to-die-for, utterly fabulous new video called "Vogue." Wait until you 
see Madonna in glorious black and white, singing and vamping in this tribute to 
the glamour goddesses of the past. 
</P>
<P>
The title "Vogue" refers not to the fashion magazine but to the dance style 
where one strikes poses. Madonna says: "It's about attitude . . . giving face . 
. . making the most of what you have!" And does this woman ever "give face"! 
She has never looked so appealing, or so reminiscent of Monroe, Harlow, 
Dietrich. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous videos, this one won't cause any outrageous controversies. 
Madonna is dressed to the teeth (well, OK, let's just say to the bosoms). There 
is no religious imagery and no vulgarity. This is a video even an old-fashioned 
mother might love. 
</P>
<P>
MADONNA'S "Blonde Ambition" tour begins in the summer, to coincide with her 
hotly awaited performance as Breathless Mahoney -- singing and dancing to fresh 
new Stephen Sondheim songs -- in the big-screen movie "Dick Tracy." Oh, yes, 
there's a guy named Warren Beatty in this film, too. There were reports by the 
opposition that Madonna and Warren's romance has died. But last weekend, these 
two took in the new French group Les Negresses Vertes at the Roxy in Los 
Angeles. Madonna sat on Warren's lap, nibbled his ear, and behaved like a woman 
in love. 
</P>
<P>
DON'T SAY I didn't warn you of the possibility that another, very big shoe may

Monday. But no, Mrs. Trump WON'T be suing for divorce.

<P>
BROADWAY HAD another great first night this week when Kathleen Turner sizzled 
into her opening of "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" at the Eugene O'Neill Theater. 
There was a ripple of black-tie civilization that night, hinting of the past 
and making us wonder if civilized theater may really be making a comeback. (We 
had some neat indications of this in "Orpheus Descending," "Grand Hotel," 
"Gypsy," "A Few Good Men," "Tru" and "City of Angels" already this season.) 
</P>
<P>
"Cat" is my least favorite of all Tennessee's plays and I've seen its four 
major versions, including Gadge Kazan's original and the sanitized 1958 movie. 
But who could quibble with any excuse to see Kathleen? 
</P>
<P>
And who can ever resist the poetry of Tennessee Williams, including his great 
closing speech by Maggie about "beautiful weak people who give up too easily"? 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the actor's actor, Charles Durning (coming into his own after a 
long career), as Big Daddy. He brought a truly sensitive and unusual brightness 
to his man-to-man talk with his son Brick, the athletic god who is sinking into 
alcoholism.

   Sizzle. Sizzle. Ouch!
   The people who run MTV, the cable channel that televises music
videos, think Madonna's rendition of ``Justify My Love'' is too hot
to handle and they've decided to ban it.
   After viewing the fantasy-filled video that features
bisexuality, cross-dressing and mild sadomasochism, MTV honchos
decided, ``This one is just not for us,'' said spokeswoman Carole
Robinson.
   The queen of undulating underwear expressed mild surprise.
   ``Why is it that people are willing to go to a movie and watch
someone get blown to bits for no reason and nobody wants to see two
girls kissing or two men snuggling?'' she asked.
   But she added, ``MTV has been good to me and they know their
audience. If it's too strong for them, I understand that.''
   The black and white video, shot in Paris, was supposed to
premiere on MTV on Saturday during a weekend ``Madonnathon.''
   ``Justify My Love'' is one of two new singles on Madonna's
recently released ``The Immaculate Collection'' anthology.
   MTV was promoting the video's premiere with a snippet showing
Madonna, in black lace, and her real-life beau, Tony Ward, locked
in a steamy, suggestive embrace in a hotel hallway.
   ``That was the only portion of the video we had received,''
Robinson said. After MTV's acquisition committee reviewed the whole
video, ``We passed on it,'' she said.
   The ``Madonnathon'' will go on as planned, she added.
   Robinson said the decision to ax the video caused no friction.
``We love Madonna. We've had and will continue to have a terrific
relationship.''
   But don't weep too much for the ``Material Girl.''
   The video, which one music critic described as being ``Marilyn
Monroe meets `Cabaret' in the S&amp;M Hotel,'' is being packaged as a
single by Warner Bros. and is due in stores by Dec. 18.

   Dr. Benjamin Spock says American society
is sick and getting sicker, and one of its worst ailments is
``excessive competitiveness.''
   Most children are brought up to believe ``you're in this world
to get ahead, kid,'' Spock said in a commencement speech Monday at
Yale University's School of Epidemiology and Public Health.
   Little League baseball should be abolished, he said, because it
``takes the fun out of athletics at an early age.''
   ``We ought to raise our children with quite a different spirit _
not primarily to get ahead,'' said Spock, whose landmark 1946 book
``Baby and Child Care'' has sold 32 million copies.
   He also recommended that teen-agers take part in volunteer
activities, from working in hospitals to tutoring children.

   Madonna's untamed look once drew stares
from classmates at Rochester Adams High School, but today's
students at her alma mater seem unimpressed that she's back in town
for two concerts.
   ``The kids that are here and are 14 years old were born the year
she graduated,'' said Nancy Ryan-Mitchell, who was Madonna Louise
Ciccone's counselor. ``To these kids, though they know she's from
the community and the school, it doesn't touch them personally.''
   Madonna will perform Thursday and Friday at The Palace in Auburn
Hills, a Detroit suburb.
   Five years ago, when her ``Virgin Tour'' came to Detroit, the
students adorned a bulletin board with memorabilia hailing the
alumna-turned-pop star.
   Madonna was an unconventional student in her senior year,
drawing attention for wearing little makeup and not shaving her
underarms.
   ``She had a real European kind of attitude, a real cosmopolitan
flair,'' said Tim Lentz, Madonna's choir teacher. ``She dared to be
different.''

   The poetry of Allen Ginsberg and the
music of Philip Glass are combined in a new production about ``the
decline of the American empire.''
   ``The Hydrogen Jukebox,'' which premiered over the weekend at
the Spoleto Festival U.S.A., is based on Ginsberg's poems dating to
the 1960s. The festival production features six singers and a
six-piece orchestra.
   Each scene is built around a poem; the subjects include the
Vietnam War, ecology and cocaine trafficking.
   ``The Hydrogen Jukebox'' is about the ``decline of the American
empire,'' Ginsberg said.
   ``It's basically an emotional and moral decline,'' he said.
``It's not an angry accusation. It's more of a meditation on the
decline of an empire. The biggest decline of empire is we won't
face our problems.''

   A collapsed lung will keep baseball Hall
of Famer Harmon Killebrew hospitalized for at least 10 days, his
brother says.
   Killebrew, 53, underwent surgery Friday at a Phoenix-area
hospital, said his brother, Bob.
   ``The problem was a gastric ulcer that ruptured in his
stomach,'' he said. ``The fluid backed up into his chest cavity and
collapsed his lung. He's still unable to talk.''
   During his 22-year career Killebrew hit 573 home runs, fifth
best in major league history. He played for the old Washington
Senators, the Minnesota Twins and the Kansas City Royals.
   The former slugger has a home in Payette, Idaho, and was in
Phoenix on business.

THOROUGHLY MODERN MADONNA; 
</P>
<P>
FASHION: THE WORLD'S MOST FAMOUS CHAMELEON IS ABOUT TO SLIP INTO THREE NEW 
LOOKS FOR THE '90S. COPYCATS TAKE NOTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA FOLEY, Foley, a free-lance writer, often contributes to the Times 
fashion pages. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Madonna watchers, get ready for another eyeful. The woman who has influenced 
the fashion scene more than anyone else in the '80s is about to reveal three -- 
that's right, three -- new looks. 
</P>
<P>
They are all dramatically different, but all basically blond. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have blond hair, I attract attention," Madonna says, after repeated 
switches between light and dark. "Dark hair is for those times when I want to 
be anonymous." 
</P>
<P>
She will unveil her first new image when "Blond Ambition," her world concert 
tour, begins this month. On stage she'll play a tarty blond, dressed in 
costumes that cross 1930s Berlin cabaret outfits with images from "A Clockwork 
Orange," the street-smart sci-fi movie made in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Each change of clothes is built around a bustle-skirted mini with a corset-like 
top designed by Marlene Stewart, who has worked with Madonna on her wardrobe 
through most of her musical incarnations. 
</P>
<P>
"My style is all about irony," explains the songstress, speaking from a 
reclining position on a bare mattress in a room cluttered with other people's 
clothes. She is in a Hollywood studio, resting between rehearsals for her world 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna's appearance reaffirms her love of contrasts. Except for her black 
fishnet hosiery she is dressed like one of the boys, in a hooded sweat shirt 
under a black denim jacket, shorts, boxer's shoes, and a leather cap worn 
backwards over her light, short hair. But physically, everything about her is 
entirely feminine. She has the complexion of a rose, her voice is a whisper, 
and she moves with the grace of a dancer. 
</P>
<P>
But Madonna wanna-be's would do well not to get too attached to the Blond 
Ambition look, because there's a blond bombshell hot on its vampy heels. In 
early June, Madonna will splash across the big screen as buttery-haired 
Breathless Mahoney, the love interest in the new "Dick Tracy" movie. 
</P>
<P>
She plays the '40s doll her way, of course, wearing Tracy's mall-brimmed fedora 
with her beaded, body- gripping gown. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Beatty portrays Dick Tracy, and for months now, the very public romance 
that blossomed during filming has been the talk of many towns. Late nights, 
Madonna and Beatty show up at Club Louie in Los Angeles. She dances with the 
crowd, he stands back to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Two new Madonnas would be enough. But there is a third one on the way. This is 
an icy blond from the pages of a '50s fashion magazine, a type created for 
"Vogue," the music video that will be released from the "Dick Tracy" sound 
track album. Madonna poses here as a cool mass of waves and curves, dressed in 
goddess gowns that cover everything but cling to almost all of it. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever will the fashion crowd do when their most active inspiration tosses 
them so many images at once? Already they have to hustle to keep up. Even Yves 
Saint Laurent succumbed to Madonna's lead this winter, with a new couture 
collection that is all about Monroe. Or is it all about Madonna playing Monroe? 
She's been updating the role for five years, since she imitated the dress, the 
voice and the hair, and called it "Material Girl," her hit song of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
And what will Jean Paul Gaultier make of the three new Madonnas? The hip French 
designer has had a fashion fling going with her since she starred in 
"Desperately Seeking Susan," her trend-setting movie of 1985. She wore black 
lace bras peeking out from beneath every outfit, and he showed fashion 
collections of underwear as outerwear, with tops that resembled long-line bras 
and bottoms that looked like girdles. Gaultier and Madonna keep trading off 
ideas (he designed several costumes for her Blond Ambition tour). And he is one 
of the few fashion big shots whose clothes she admits to wearing. 
</P>
<P>
Italy's Franco Moschino is another. "They have a sense of humor," she says 
about them. "I hate taking fashion and style seriously." 
</P>
<P>
While she inspires some of the biggest names in the clothing business, she says 
the people from the racially mixed neighborhood in Bay City, Mich., where she 
grew up, still inspire her. They knew her by her full name, Madonna Louise 
Veronica Ciccone, after her mother who died when Madonna was 6 years old. And 
she knew them as people with a flamboyant sense of style. "These people managed 
to look good without money," she recalls. She seems to pride herself on the 
fact that she still wears few designer labels. 
</P>
<P>
Without realizing it, her father influenced her fashion awareness, too. "My 
father would go crazy when I wore pants to church," she says of her strict 
Catholic upbringing. Seeing how potent a certain way of dress could be, she 
says, helped her develop what she refers to as "combinations of strictness and 
rebelliousness." Such Madonna fashion details as crucifix earrings and rosary 
bead necklaces were born of that awareness. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years she has constantly shifted fashion roles from toughie to 
temptress, mixing man-tailored suits with lace underwear, motorcycle jackets 
with tulle dresses and "Boy Toy" belt buckles. At first it was all by 
intuition. Now, she can explain it. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to cross the boundaries between men and women," she says. "That can be 
frightening, but the things I'm most affected by are things that frighten or 
challenge me." 
</P>
<P>
"I like to nudge people, to break through stereotypes. There are too many 
stereotypes. Even liberated women stay in certain categories; no one is too 
threatening." 
</P>
<P>
Madonna has surrounded herself with a trusted group of creative people who have 
worked with her from the beginning, yet rarely allow their names to be 
associated with hers. They all seem to want to stay in the background. 
</P>
<P>
In part that's because she expects to be the the only star in the group. But 
it's also because she has her own eclectic view, a collision of images from 
street fashions, ethnic dances and glamorous old movies that only she could 
combine. 
</P>
<P>
Her definite tastes don't always make her easy to work with. 
</P>
<P>
"She knows she's difficult," says Victor Vidal, one of her regular hair 
stylists. 
</P>
<P>
"But her saving grace is that being difficult is part of being honest, for her. 
She complains for a reason. It might be after 14 hours of rehearsal. She'll 
say, 'Let's get this done,' but everybody else feels the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her strong point of view about absolutely everything, the people around 
her say she respects and trusts them, starting with her art director, 
29-year-old Christopher Ciccone, who is also one of her seven siblings and 
looks remarkably like her. 
</P>
<P>
"She calls me the 'tastemaker,' " Ciccone says. A painter who has worked 
closely with Madonna since the early '80s when she peddled her record demos to 
New York deejays, he is artistic director for the Blond Ambition tour. He is 
also responsible for the interior design of both her California home and her 
New York apartment. He describes both as spacious and serene, punctuated with 
important art. 
</P>
<P>
"She has her own vision, I offer her different ways of looking at things. Other 
people do, too, but it's different with us. We fight a lot, and either she wins 
or I win, but we don't let up. Neither of us is afraid to be direct, and 
Madonna has always known what she wants." 
</P>
<P>
Costume designer Stewart gives Madonna full credit for creating her distinctive 
clothing style. "She's an actress, not just a singer. For costumes she thinks 
in terms of story and character." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Savic, her other hair stylist, created Madonna's flirty hair styles for 
"Desperately Seeking Susan," and has worked steadily with her since then. He 
also designed her glamour girl styles for "Dick Tracy." 
</P>
<P>
Vidal made up the bleached, cropped, chopped look Madonna wore for her "True 
Blue" video in 1986. "I told her about this vision I had of her. I wanted to 
bleach her hair almost white and cut it short. She thought for a moment, said 
yes, picked up a magazine and never looked up until I was finished." 
</P>
<P>
Madonna's two makeup artists, Francesca Tolot and Joanne Gair both say she 
knows what she wants. Their only basic rules are to use deeper shades of color 
when her hair is dark, paler shades when she is blond. And they use less makeup 
now than ever before, because she wants a less painted look these days. But 
neither Tolot nor Gair takes credit for teaching her anything new. 
</P>
<P>
"She is aware of her face, she knows what looks good and what does not," says 
Gair. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 Madonna added personal trainer Rob Parr to her inner circle. She works 
out with him for two hours daily. 
</P>
<P>
"She challenges herself more than I ever could," says Parr. "Our workouts often 
start at 5 in the morning, when she is filming. We work on stamina and 
endurance for her singing and dancing and we work on the shape of her body." 
</P>
<P>
"I work out for emotional reasons as well as physical," she says. "It makes me 
feel more in control. I can say to myself, 'At least I've accomplished one 
thing for the day.' " 
</P>
<P>
Photographer Herb Ritts and video director Mary Lambert are two others in 
Madonna's stable. 
</P>
<P>
Lambert directed "Material Girl," and "Like a Prayer," perhaps the most 
controversial of all Madonna's works so far, because of its martyr/victim 
overtones. 
</P>
<P>
"Madonna makes no effort to mask any of her feelings," says Lambert. "I think 
part of her appeal is that she personifies the way a lot of people want to be." 
</P>
<P>
Madonna relates that notion to clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm in a bad mood I dress the way I feel," she says. All of a sudden an 
underlying toughness about her shows through and she turns defiant. "I don't 
comb my hair, I put on a cap, a leather jacket, jeans, a T-shirt. It works 
because I'm dressed the way I feel." 
</P>
<P>
Ritts met Madonna five years ago, while photographing an ad campaign for her 
movie, "Desperately Seeking Susan." 
</P>
<P>
"She strutted in dripping in rubber bracelets, crucifixes, carrying armloads of 
clothes and trinkets in a cigar box. I liked the definite way she felt about 
herself." 
</P>
<P>
Concerning the many faces of Madonna the world has seen since then, Ritts says, 
"Her attraction isn't about hair or makeup or clothes, it's about her evolution 
as a person." 
</P>
<P>
Truly, we've all watched her grow up, from the 20-year-old kid still reliving 
Catholic school days to Madonna the MTV star of the decade, the 31-year-old 
mogul in charge of her own music and movie career, who is said to earn $20 
million or more every year. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, including criticisms and counter-criticisms that she can't 
sing, can't act, can't keep her personal life together, no one has questioned 
her reputation as fashion's leading chameleon. And she is the one who decides 
when to change color. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to me to express myself, as an artist, as a woman, as a jerk if 
that's how I feel," she says, putting on a slick black, knee-grazing trench 
coat to go on to another rehearsal. "Nobody has done what I've done quite the 
way I've done it. I don't know what people will be saying about me in 50 years, 
but I know they'll be talking about me."

<HEAD>Newest Madonna Video Reportedly Too Hot for MTV</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Madonna gave herself a stigmata in her ``Like a
Prayer'' video, wrapped herself in a flag and bikini for a
get-out-the-vote commercial and told Arsenio Hall she likes to be
spanked.
   But this time she's gone too far.
   Her new video for ``Justify My Love'' - which includes
portrayals of Madonna and her boyfriend's fantasies of voyeurism,
bisexuality, cross-dressing and mild sadomasochism - has been
rejected by MTV as too risque.
   The video, which was to premiere Saturday, shows Madonna and a
lover - played by real-life boyfriend Tony Ward - in a steamy
encounter i a Paris hotel.
   Clips of the video have already aired on MTV to plug the
station's 48-hour ``Madonnathon'' this weekend. But executives at
the cable music station got a look at the entire video Monday and
decided it was too hot to handle.
   ``We respect her work as an artist and think she makes great
videos. This one is not for us,'' MTV said in a statement.
   Madonna said in today's The New York Times, ``MTV has been good
to me and they know their audience. If it's too strong for them, I
understand that.''

<HEAD>10 Worst-Dressed Fashion Frumps `A Parade of Terrors,'' Mr.
Blackwell Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Blackwell, the acid-tongued clothes
critic who crusades against crimes of fashion, has placed singer
LaToya Jackson atop his most-wanted list, calling her ``Cher for
the 1990s.''
   And in case you think that's a compliment, think again. Cher
also made Blackwell's 1989 10 Worst-Dressed Women list, along with
eight other actresses, singers and a member of the British royal
family.
   ``In leather and chains, she's Cher for the 1990s,'' the
outspoken oracle of style said of Miss Jackson, who gained
notoriety when she posed nude for Playboy magazine. ``If I had her
face and body I'd stay in bed all day.''
   Blackwell also had unkind words about the sartorial splendor of
Roseanne Barr, Demi Moore, Kim Basinger, Princess Anne, Emily
Lloyd, Daryl Hannah, Paula Abdul and, in a tie for 10th, Madonna
and Sandra Bernhard.
   ``The finalists were a parade of terrors that make The Joker in
`Batman' look positively conservative by comparison,'' said
Blackwell. ``Ninety-nine percent of these people could be mistaken
for a baglady.''
   Blackwell reserved special dishonorable mention for singer Grace
Jones, whom he termed ``Darth Vader's S&amp;M fantasy in a martian
birdcage.''
   Blackwell, whose real name is Richard Sylvan Selzer, held court
at his well-appointed Hancock Park home Wednesday to unveil the
30th annual Worst-Dressed Women list.
   Television's Miss Barr was zinged as a ``bowling alley reject,''
former brat-packer Miss Moore was ``a spandexed `Nightmare on
Willis Street,''' and ``Batman'' star Miss Basinger was a
``parading peep-show (who) should be banished to the batcave.''
   Princess Anne was reduced to ``lumpy, dumpy and frumpy,'' Cher
to a ``bag of tattooed bones in a sequinned slingshot,'' Miss
Hannah to a ``Vegas Venus on steroids,'' Miss Abdul to a ``fashion
gypsy (who) dances in the light (and) dresses in the dark,'' and
Madonna and Bernhard to ``the Mutt and Jeff of MTV: vampy, trampy
... and cartoon campy.''
   While some have questioned Blackwell's fashion credentials, he
boasts that he formerly designed dresses for a distinguished
clientele, including Zsa Zsa Gabor and Marilyn Monroe, before
devoting full attention to his yearly list.
   ``I was a fashion designer with 450 accounts all over the world,
but I left it two years ago when the miniskirt came back,'' he said.
   Blackwell said he does the list so that ``people who want star
status don't make a mistake and copy'' the fashion frumps.
   After reading off the fashion rap sheet, Blackwell turned his
attention to a select group of woman he considers fashion paragons.
   His Top 10 list of Fabulous Fashion Independents included first
lady Barbara Bush, Geena Davis, Ivana Trump, Angela Lansbury,
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Liza Minnelli, Barbara
Walters, Tina Brown, Princess Diana and Jacqueline Onassis.
   Blackwell said only two of his targets for disdain ever
complained _ Beatrice Arthur and Dinah Shore.
   ``They were furious,'' he said. ``But most of them love to make
the list. I never insult them as people. This is an observation of
what they look like to me.
   ``I adore many of them as performers,'' he said.

MTV: THE NAUGHTY ENVELOPE, PLEASE;

<P>
TELEVISION: THE MTV VIDEO MUSIC AWARDS PROGRAM PROVIDES IMPROMPTU STAGE FOR 
MUSICIANS ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF CENSORSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
What so proudly they hailed, 'round about the twilight's last gleaming Thursday 
night at the MTV Video Music Awards ceremony, was Sinead O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
The target of controversy recently for threatening not to perform if the 
American national anthem were played before her show at a New Jersey hall, 
O'Connor won scattered boos but more cheers on Thursday at the Universal 
Amphitheatre as she picked up three MTV Video Music Awards. 
</P>
<P>
Accepting the best video of the year honor for "Nothing Compares 2 U," which 
came after her awards in the best female video and best post-modern video 
categories, a seemingly surprised and bashful O'Connor thanked her associates 
and then used the podium as a platform to address the issue that was the 
dominant motif of the irreverent three-hour show -- the C-word. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a very great respect for people of all countries, including American 
people," said O'Connor, defending her action in New Jersey. "I'd like to say 
that my attitude over the national anthem was in order to bring attention to 
the censorship issue. As far as I'm concerned, censorship in any form is bad, 
but when it's racism disguised as censorship, that's even worse, and that was 
the point I was trying to make." 
</P>
<P>
Host Arsenio Hall helped defang the seriousness of the moment afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"Sinead! Way to go, baby!" yelled a typically cheerleader-ish Hall (who had 
called the Irish singer "that cute little lady with the bald head" earlier). "I 
never heard 'em sing 'The Star-Spangled Banner' at a concert! Maybe you ended 
up at a baseball game or something -- you took a wrong turn!" 
</P>
<P>
If inevitably seen by some as self-aggrandizing, O'Connor's was one of the more 
tasteful plugs for freedom of speech in a self-consciously naughty show that -- 
with racy performances by Madonna and 2 Live Crew -- pushed the edge of the 
envelope of what can be shown on TV, or MTV, but nonetheless stayed well within 
the realm of self-censorship. (KTTV-TV Channel 11 will rebroadcast the show 
Wednesday at 8 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
Compared with last year's show, which featured profane comedy from now-banned 
Andrew Dice Clay and a backstage fistfight between members of Motley Crue and 
Guns N' Roses, the 1990 telecast was relatively tame. But it wasn't for lack of 
trying. 
</P>
<P>
Proudly introduced by actor Eric Bogosian as "my fellow Americans -- with 
honor," the controversial rap group 2 Live Crew performed one of its few 
non-misogynistic songs, "Banned in the U.S.A.," sounding like ventriloquists' 
dummies as they haplessly parroted quasi-patriotic defenses of their First 
Amendment rights. In a show of rap solidarity, M.C. Hammer, Public Enemy's 
Flavor Flav and members of N.W.A. also walked out on stage. 
</P>
<P>
If 2 Live Crew (w)rapping its dirty ditties in the flag lacked class, the 
clean-imaged M.C. Hammer still managed perhaps even worse taste -- by showing 
up at the podium to accept his best rap and best dance video awards pointedly 
swigging and plugging the diet cola whose advertisements featuring him 
dominated the commercial breaks in the show. The audience half-expected him to 
announce he was going to Disneyland next. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna was also a contender in the most shameless sweepstakes, with an 
otherwise wittily choreographed "Vogue" dance number -- in an amusingly 
incongruous baroque setting -- marred by moments in which subservient boy 
dancers in short pants placed their hands on her heaving bosom (twice) and 
stuck their heads up her dress (twice). 
</P>
<P>
Far more shocking was Cher, who showed up to present the climactic award . . . 
conservatively dressed. 
</P>
<P>
The best rock 'n' roll moment occurred off-camera, when Aerosmith ripped 
through a rave-up version of the Beatles' "I'm Down" during a commercial break 
before performing the scheduled "Love in an Elevator" -- for which the veteran 
group won best hard rock/metal video. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you Tipper (Gore) and Jesse (Helms)," said singer Steven Tyler, keeping 
the evening's main riff going, "for making sure that as long as there are a few 
four-letter words on the album, it'll sell an extra million copies!" 
</P>
<P>
Other winners included Don Henley (best male video), the B-52's (best group 
video), Michael Penn (best new artist), Billy Idol (best video from a film) and 
Tears for Fears (breakthrough video). Madonna herself was shut out, though her 
"Vogue" video won in three technical categories, including best director for 
David Fincher.

<HEAD>Madonna Withdraws Assault Complaint Against Sean Penn</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Madonna is withdrawing an assault complaint
against her estranged husband, Sean Penn.
   ``Madonna asked that there be no criminal charges pressed. There
is no other evidence with which to base a criminal charge so there
won't be a criminal charge filed,'' district attorney's spokesman Al
Albergate said Tuesday.
   Madonna filed the assault report at the Sheriff's Department over
an incident alleged to have occurred at the couple's Malibu home
during the New Year's weekend. Contents of the report were not
disclosed.
   However, the British tabloid press reported that Madonna was
beaten, gagged and left strapped to an armchair for nine hours
before she escaped.
   Nationally syndicated columnist Liz Smith also reported the
alleged incident, saying Madonna was ``trussed up like a turkey.''
   Those reports could not be verified.
   Neither Albergate nor sheriff's detectives would comment. Deputy
District Attorney Lauren Weiss, who met with the singer-actress on
Monday, did not return telephone calls, nor did attorney and an
publicist for Penn.
   Madonna's publicist, Liz Rosenberg, said the sultry songstress
had no comment.
   Madonna moved out of the couple's Malibu home following the
alleged attack and filed for divorce to end her turbulent three-year
marriage.
   The divorce petition followed an earlier divorce filing and
fights between photographers and the hot-tempered Penn, one of which
led to a 60-day jail term for the actor.

POP FACES: LOUIE LOUIE: LUXURY WITH A BIG BEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Louie Cordero grew up in Orange County, reading his mother's copies of Hit 
Parader magazine and listening to a bedroom radio tuned each week to the 
"American Top 40" countdown. 
</P>
<P>
Now, under the stage name Louie Louie, Cordero is on the hit parade himself. 
"Sittin' in the Lap of Luxury," the first single from the 25-year-old dance-pop 
singer's debut album, "The State I'm In," has moved quickly to No. 27 on the 
Billboard pop chart. 
</P>
<P>
The song, which tells the story of a gigolo who finds true romance, is the 
first tangible success in Louie's focused, concerted quest to make it big. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I need gratification constantly. (Stardom) is the most incredible 
thing that could ever happen to somebody," said the handsome, athletically 
built singer. "Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to be on TV or in the movies. 
It attracted me because if you're familiar to everybody in the world, it seems 
safer. I don't think people know me unless they see me perform." 
</P>
<P>
Louie's quest to be known began in Southern California dance clubs, where his 
reputation as a flashy teen-age dancer landed him the role of leading man in 
the video for Madonna's 1984 song "Borderline." Louie says that Madonna and her 
managers were the first people in show business to encourage him to sing and 
write songs. 
</P>
<P>
He was let down by some early setbacks, but made the best of them. "I kind of 
like to fail," he noted. "You have to have a lot of humbling experiences, 
because then you know where you come from." 
</P>
<P>
Louie wrote or co-wrote all of "The State I'm In," moving beyond dance-pop 
cliches in songs like the gospel-funk title track, a spirited, propulsive 
rallying cry for positive change that recalls Prince's style. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody can write a song about pushing to the groove, or moving to the beat," 
Louie said. "I don't think songs about sex and dancing are enough. There should 
be a lesson in every song." MIKE BOEHM

MADONNA'S PARTY: STARS AND DANCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Madonna and a few hundred of her close, personal friends invaded the Park Plaza 
over the weekend as her record label threw a late-night fete to celebrate the 
release of her new album, "Like a Prayer." 
</P>
<P>
Paparazzi staked out the entrance, while inside, guests paid tribute to the 
singer/actress/soft-drink hawker by dancing to her latest single, "Like a 
Prayer." The newly peroxided (and newly single) Madonna showed off her dancing 
skills too, but showed no signs of acquiring stigmata all night. 
</P>
<P>
"Is that part of her new album? Is that?" asked guests, who were trying to 
guess which of the disco-y tunes blasting through the speakers were part of 
Madonna's current repertoire. Most everyone commented on how fabulous she 
looked. 
</P>
<P>
Wandering through the vast, Viking-like rooms of the Plaza were Madonna gal-pal 
Sandra Bernhard (the two were also dance partners); Warren Beatty hanging with 
Lauren Hutton, Beverly D'Angelo and Lori Singer; too-hip modeling agents Omar 
and Paul Fisher; the Hollywood Kids; Dwight Yoakum (almost unrecognizable sans 
cowboy hat); Little Richard; chain mail designer Michael Schmidt; actor Billy 
Wirth; cosmopolitan gadfly Amos Newman; artist and boulevardier Jeffrey Knoll; 
and various record execs, musicians, models and denizens of the night. 
</P>
<P>
There was no sign of Sean Penn. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros. served canapes, make-your-own tacos and an entire table of 
desserts. But why was no one eating? This crowd couldn't have been that 
diet-conscious. Maybe no one wanted to dribble salsa on their leather, the 
preferred fabric of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Agent-types opted for oversized suits and an occasional ponytail, while rockers 
showed off tattoos and nose rings. And let's not forget girls in cut-out minis 
and bustiers, the latter vaguely reminiscent of Maddie in her old days. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the evening, rappers took the stage in one of the rooms, while others 
danced to Madonna songs while watching the new "Like a Prayer" video. Some 
opted to watch the crowd or work it. 
</P>
<P>
And when the party wound down about 1-ish Sunday morning, where did the 
cognoscenti scatter? Why, to b.c., of course, where just the night before 
patrons had danced atop the bar. 
</P>
<P>
Although the hot-hot supper club has only been open a scant few weeks, one girl 
was overheard whining to her friend in the bathroom: "Cynthia, I think this 
place was cooler when no one knew about it, y'know?"

"C'mon L.A. . . . Express yourself!" Those were Madonna's opening words at one 
of her sold-out concerts here this week. And the erstwhile Material Girl's 
faithful fans did indeed respond to her call, expressing themselves through 
mimicry. Madonna wanna-bes hit the L.A. Sports Arena in full force, providing a 
walking retrospective of the fashion styles that, as much as her music, have 
made the singer a cultural icon. Racing to copy her ever-changing fashion 
shifts, these youthful fans had her previous looks down pat, but the object of 
their flattery-by-imitation stayed one step ahead of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
On stage, in her latest incarnation, Madonna mixed high style with high camp. 
With dark eyebrows, electric red lips and her blond mane slicked back and 
topped with a fountain-like, fake ponytail, the songstress shifted through a 
wide array of costumes, most of them by Paris designer Jean Paul Gaultier, 
others by Los Angeles based Marlene Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
Revolving around her wardrobe's main staple -- a corset with pointy, heavily 
stitched bra -- Madonna's costume changes included a double-breasted pinstripe 
pantsuit with corset worn over the pants, under the jacket, a striped hooded 
Lycra top worn over the corset and pants, without the jacket; a silver sequined 
and fringed outfit reminiscent of a Las Vegas chorus line costume, and a long 
black, shroud-like dress. The encore outfit was a little bit more frivolous: a 
polka dotted halter with mega-flared hip-hugger pants. Her main accessory was a 
gold lorgnette on a long, gold chain that she first wore for her "Express 
Yourself" video. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the Sports Arena, fans squealed, "Strike a pose," in reference to 
Madonna's new hit video, "Vogue," but they did not adapt the Old Hollywood 
glamour looks she wears for that video. One homage outfit included a black 
sequined bustier over cut-off, rolled-up blue jeans, patent leather Doc Martin 
shoes and a slew of crucifixes. As the wearer, Karen Jimenez put it, she 
imitates the singer because "Madonna's baaad." 
</P>
<P>
 Styles featured on Madonna's recent videos, particularly "Express Yourself," 
found their way into the wanna-be repertoire. Kathlene Kolian, 23, had the look 
down to a T with a mannish-cut dark suit and curly platinum hair. 
</P>
<P>
Even men got into the act. Kolian's companion, Mitchell Stevens, paid tribute 
to Madonna with knee-length shorts and a string of pearls around his neck. 
Emerson Chavez, in a black "Express Yourself" suit replete with plunging 
neckline and carefully coiffed hairdo, described his fascination with Madonna's 
look. "Every time she comes out with something new, some new look, I try to 
copy her. She's the one. She's got great style." 
</P>
<P>
Liz Rosenberg, vice president of publicity at Warner Bros. records, has been 
touring with Madonna and found that, like their idol, the Madonna mimics are 
changing. "They've grown up," she noted, adding that most of the people who 
started copying Madonna in their teens are now easing into their 20s but they 
haven't turned away from their idol. 
</P>
<P>
"Madonna says, 'Be like what you want,' and what they want is to be like her." 
</P>
<P>
While not every fan went for all-out imitation, some tidbits of Madonna's 
fashion sense were noticeable on almost everyone. Rolled-up, knee-length jeans, 
see-through chiffon tops and small black hats like one she wore for her "Open 
Your Heart" video, were spotted. 
</P>
<P>
The Gaultier influence was not lost on the fans either. Many sported knockoff 
versions of the designer's contoured jackets and T-shirts imprinted with the 
Gaultier logo. "It's Madonna and Jean Paul Gaultier," said Maya Rudolph. 
"They're what style is all about." 
</P>
<P>
Fans copped lifestyle tips from their idol as well. Recalling a scene from 
Madonna's film "Desperately Seeking Susan," long lines formed at the 
wall-mounted hand dryers in the ladies' room. The faithful weren't there to dry 
their hands though. A twist of the nozzle and the wanna-bes had created a 
makeshift hair dryer. Express yourself, indeed.

<LEADPARA>  SO WHAT happened to all the fat guys and wimps in pop music? You used to see
herds of them at concerts and on MTV, playing their guitars, surrounded by
gorgeous women. Guzzling beer and wearing black T-shirts stretched to the
limit, they gave the male audience just the right reinforcement.;    But the
golden age is over; the beer aesthetic is gone. Across the cultural board,
from movies to advertisements, men have become not just erotic figures, but
really erotic figures, and in pop they're not wearing too many clothes.
Whether it's Jon Bon Jovi, M.C. Hammer, Vanilla Ice, L.L. Cool J, Bobby Brown,
Faith No More, the Red Hot Chili Peppers or Danzig, athleticism has taken over
and shirts have been taken off. Drill-sergeant exercise routines and exposed
torsos have become the real subject of shows.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  POP GOES FOR THE BEEFCAKE
BANDMATES OF THE MONTH  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Pop Music  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Men in pop are getting the treatment that used to be reserved for women --
tight clothes, obsessional camera angles, figures turned into fetishes. The
choice is simple: Nautilus or the nether world of marginal success.;    The
new attention to skin is all about making performers mythic, creating a gap
between the ordinary audience and the glamorous, inaccessible stars. Over the
years, pop music has always swung between the romantic and the everyday,
between the glamour of Madonna and the anti-glamour of, say, Dire Straits, an
earnest rock band playing for the sake of music.;    With the rise of punk in
the late 1970s, which ostensibly democratized popular music, rock and pop were
shorn of their glamour.;    Not until the creation of MTV in 1981 did a
Hollywood sensibility enter the world of music. With MTV came the same sort of
elevation experienced by film stars. And like film celebrities, who are
carved, chopped and implanted, pop personalities came under pressure to
correct their physical appearances to fit current notions of what is
acceptable. The out-of-shapers didn't have a chance. In the last half of the
'80s, audiences wanted glamour, not democracy.;    Today, men are using their
bodies to storm a position formerly occupied by women. Not that sexuality
hasn't always been a selling point for men in music, from Duke Ellington to
Frank Sinatra, from Elvis Presley to Mick Jagger, Jim Morrison to Marvin
Gaye.;    But the athletic male body, usually shirtless and well displayed in
concerts and videos, is now standard among superstars. Where women were once
the focus of an audience's unresolved desire, now men have joined the action.;
   It's no coincidence that beefcake arrived after the rise of a generation of
women performers such as Janet Jackson, Madonna and the now-forgotten Cyndi
Lauper. They and others have given the impression that they controlled their
own eroticism, that they have been exploiting themselves instead of being
exploited.;    The use of the body has become less a sign of subservience than
an emblem of empowerment. Feminism, in its attempt to give decision-making
powers to the exploited, inadvertently allowed for a whole new type of
commercialism.;    Male performers have taken their cue. Made aware of an
affluent market -- as demonstrated by the incredible popularity of New Kids on
the Block -- they found that teen-age girls were more than willing to buy
images of the new beefcake. Add that discovery to the gym culture in the
1980s, and the death of the fat rock star became inevitable.;    So the
on-stage body must now be perfect or the artist risks commercial failure; the
use of Rob Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan as front-bodies for Milli Vanilli and a
model stand-in for Martha Wash on the video and in performances of Black Box's
hit "Everybody Everybody" shows how essential eroticism is to selling pop.
Eroticism, for years the province of pop music, is based on denial -- but
before you can deny an audience something, you have to make them want it.;   
Rock's traditional image of self-destruction is also used as a sales ploy.
Many bands today have adopted the traditional romantic image of the artist as
victim or outcast.;    A group such as the Black Crowes relishes a certain
emaciated look that suggests a sense of danger. That skinniness has to be
shown: in concert, the band's lead singer, Chris Robinson, lets the loose
blouse he is wearing slip to show some skin; in the video for their latest
hit, "Hard to Handle," there are plenty of shirts open to the waist and shots
of Robinson without any shirt at all, showing off a skinny but well-muscled
body. Fifteen years ago, he would have just been skinny; now he's also well
defined.;    Where the Black Crowes suggest decadence through emaciation and
take off their shirts to show it, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Urban Dance
Squad -- two bands that depict an idealized California -- remove their shirts
as an argument for fun in the sun with the boys.;    In the world of male pop,
the element of shock also helps in constructing an image. From its beginnings
in Elvis or Little Richard all the way through Madonna, rock has invested a
great deal of energy in cultivating outrage: like sex, it sells. As sexuality
became standard in the 1970s, pop music looked around to find something to
generate a sense of transgression.;    So Madonna turned sexuality into
self-assertion, and fiddled around with religion to appear as if she were
breaking a taboo. But men always had self-assertion in their arsenal; it was
neither a novelty nor a transgression. Until now, few men in rock felt a need
to hone their bodies into the ideal expected of women.;    Today, audiences
clearly love the mythmaking of modern pop: Bobby Brown, who can't sing to save
his life, has an audience, mostly female and mostly young, that goes crazy for
him in concert. Critics bemoan the loss of musical values in pop music, but
audiences don't. They want the spectacle, the explosions and the glory.;    As
any M.C. Hammer video hints, the excessive athletic control of a body can seem
militaristic, a sign of power and force. The perfect male body, glorified and
venerated, ends up representing discipline instead of freedom and may just be
a symbol for these bellicose, male-dominated times.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Betty Boo, already a star in Britain and riding
``Doin' the Do'' up the charts in the United States, doesn't mind
being compared to Madonna - up to a point.
   ``But I don't want people believing I'm a wannabee. I admire
Madonna, like I admire Margaret Thatcher - though I don't agree
with her politics - because I like to see strong women, women in
control,'' said the feisty, ravishingly attractive 20-year-old.
   ``I feel weak if I am not in control. I always like to be in the
driver's seat. That's why I don't like flying: I always think I am
going to crash, I don't trust the pilot.''
   She's flying high on her own.
   In Britain she has had two Top 10 singles, and her album,
``Boomania,'' has made the top five. And she has signed a U.S.
recording contract with Seymour Stein of Sire Records, the man who
signed Madonna.
   ``Madonna told Seymour Stein she liked my video, she thought I
was cute. She told Seymour, `Oh, she needs a choreographer, she
should use Luis''' - Luiscamacho Jose Gutlerez, who did Madonna's
``Vogue'' video.
   He is helping with Betty Boo's next video, and other connections
are happening quickly. She has signed up with Larry Frazin and
Larry Tollin, the American managers who also handle Paula Abdul.
   Half-Scottish, half-Malaysian by birth and 100 percent Cockney
in speech, the singer changed her name from Alison Clarkson because
someone once remarked that she looked like Betty Boop, the ditzy
cartoon character.
   ``I don't see myself as a bimbo, because I'm headstrong,'' she
said. ``I'm not thick. A lot of people think I look good and it
helps. But I'm not going to go topless or anything like that.''
   She began her music career with two girlfriends as the rap group
She Rockers. Three years ago they met Professor Griff of Public
Enemy at a McDonald's near their home in the west London working
class district of Shepherd's Bush.
   Griff liked their insulting attitude, and offered to produce a
single in New York. ``Give It a Rest'' was the result.
   But the singer didn't identify with the radical black separatism
and hard-core rap she encountered in New York. She returned to
England, disillusioned, after a month.
   Fired with new determination in 1988 after the death of her
father, a driver on the London subway, she took a course in studio
sound engineering so she could control her own work.
   She connected with the pioneering British dance label Rhythm
King and wrote the rap and sang on ``Hey DJ'' by the Beatmasters, a
top 10 song in Britain last year.
   Her own record deal followed, and the company bought her a
keyboard, sequencer and sampler. She mastered the equipment and
composed 10 songs in six weeks.
   ```Doin' the Do' was the first real song I wrote,'' she said. It
was aimed at a math teacher who gave her a hard time and sums up
Betty's need to be in control and to win.
   She later ran into the teacher, who asked how she as doing.
   ``I said I had just received my 10,000 pounds ($20,000) bonus
and it made him mad,'' she said.
   ``I think I show people that a 20-year-old girl with hardly any
academic qualifications can be successful. I really wanted to show
my teacher. I think he is really pleased for me now.
   ``Looking back at school, what I did was wrong. I should have
studied. But in a way I'm glad I didn't because I wouldn't be doing
what I do now.''
   Betty Boo's videos reflect her style, sort of a B-movie version
of ``Barbarella.''
   ``I like the way they did their makeup in the '60s, I like the
clothes. They were simple, quite sexy and raunchy, but it still had
a hard-edged appeal. It's really tough, like the Emma Peel stuff,''
she said, referring to Diana Rigg's karate-kicking role in ``The
Avengers.''
   All this toughness is her revenge for growing up as an outsider.
   ``A lot of people can't tell whether I'm half white or half
black, can't tell whether I'm half Puerto Rican or half Japanese,
or half this or that. I used to lie. I used to say I was white so I
could fit in. Afterwards I was really proud of my looks. I used to
see models who looked more like me than the common girls who
criticized me.''
   Betty Boo is recording her second album and hopes to tour in
1992 with a Hollywood musical-style live show. And she's coping
with the stresses of success.
   ``Being in this business makes me very moody and determined. I
want things to be done and I can get very stroppy if they are not
done. I can see why Madonna is the way she is. I am going through
what she went through 10 years ago. I am quite frightened it will
change me.''

Evansville are assuring reporters at the scene that the cable service,
including MTV, was properly installed at the house where she stayed.;   And
its relevant equipment disappeared when Madonna trundled herself hastily out
of town. That's the bill, $750, that Garrison says she might end up stuck
with.;   Garrison said she had the cable installed under her name to speed up
the process when Madonna decided to move in earlier than planned. Madonna
arrived in Evansville on Aug. 12.;   "I sure learned something from this:
Don't put a bill in your name if you don't even know the last name of the

Ciccone's accountants have been paying the cable bills, along with phone bills
also placed in Garrison's name.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>10 Worst-Dressed Fashion Frumps `A Parade of Terror,'' Mr.
Blackwell Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto LA4</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fashion critic Mr. Blackwell, who has ripped
into the wardrobes of celebrities for three decades, put LaToya
Jackson atop his worst-dressed roll Wednesday because he considers
her more freak than chic.
   ``In leather and chains, she's Cher for the 1990s,'' said the
outspoken oracle of style. ``If I had her face and body I'd stay in
bed all day.''
   The acid-tongued critic also flung 1989 fashion darts at
Roseanne Barr, Demi Moore, Kim Basinger, Princess Anne, Emily
Lloyd, Cher, Daryl Hannah and Paula Abdul and, in a tie for 10th,
Madonna and Sandra Bernhard.
   ``The finalists were a parade of terrors that make The Joker in
`Batman' look positively conservative by comparison,'' said
Blackwell, a designer. ``Ninety-nine percent of these people could
be mistaken for a bag lady.''
   The year's uncontested fashion frump, however, was singer Grace
Jones: ``Darth Vader's S&amp;M fantasy in a Martian bird cage.''
   Blackwell, whose real name is Richard Sylvan Selzer, held court
at his well-appointed Hancock Park home to unveil the 30th annual
Worst-Dressed Women list.
   Television's Miss Barr was zinged as a ``bowling alley reject,''
actress Miss Moore, wife of actor Bruce Willis, was ``a spandexed
`Nightmare on Willis Street,'' and ``Batman's'' Miss Basinger was a
``parading peep-show (who) should be banished to the batcave.''
   Britain's Princess Anne was reduced to ``lumpy, dumpy and
frumpy,'' entertainer Cher to a ``bag of tattooed bones in a
sequinned slingshot,'' actress Miss Lloyd to ``a sweater girl for
Field &amp; Stream,'' actress Miss Hannah to a ``Vegas Venus on
steroids,'' singer-choreographer Miss Abdul to a ``fashion gypsy
(who) dances in the light (and) dresses in the dark,'' and singer
Madonna-comedian Bernhard to ``the Mutt and Jeff of MTV: vampy,
trampy ... and cartoon campy.''
   Blackwell, resplendent in a black double-breasted suit, also had
something good to say.
   His Top 10 list of Fabulous Fashion Independents included first
lady Barbara Bush, actress Geena Davis, Ivana Trump, actress Angela
Lansbury, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, entertainer
Liza Minnelli, television personality Barbara Walters, Vanity Fair
editor Tina Brown, Princess Diana and Jacqueline Onassis.
   Special barbs were aimed at Barbra Streisand and Bette Midler,
perennial Blackwell favorites who have been on his worst-dressed
list so often they are now lifetime holders of the dishonor.
   ``We don't have any star-status people anymore _ the Elizabeth
Taylors,'' he said. ``Poor Bette Midler, she's helpless. Why
bother? And Barbra Streisand, she's on some kick for visual
self-destruction.
   ``I don't know how she has a mirror in the house.''
   Blackwell said only two of his targets for disdain ever
complained _ actresses Beatrice Arthur and Dinah Shore.
   ``They were furious,'' he said. ``But most of them love to make
the list. I never insult them as people. This is an observation of
what they look like to me. I adore many of them as performers.''
   Blackwell also offered a dreary forecast for the 1990s.
   ``After a decade of glitz, it will be dull, boring and drab,
almost to a point where fashion will be mourning itself,'' he said.
The fashion future? ``Understatement is the trend for the 1990s.''

THE HOOFERS STEP AHEAD OF THE SINGERS AT MTV VIDEO AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Woe to all Madonna wanna-bes who have joyful voices but not happy feet. The 
full import of gotta sing, gotta dance never applied more than Wednesday night 
at the MTV Video Music Awards, which boasted a performing lineup full of 
hyphenates who hoof at least as well as they hum. 
</P>
<P>
The prime exemplar of this shift in pop paradigms was Laker 
Girl-turned-choreographer-turned-chart-topper Paula Abdul. Her "Straight Up" 
clip captured four trophies (for female video, dance video, choreography and 
editing) and her three-song production number on the stage of the Universal 
Amphitheatre was a highlight of the sixth annual edition of the awards, which 
were carried live on the event's namesake video channel. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul's live vocals were inevitably even more thin than her likeably girlish 
recorded crooning, but a routine that began with a spirited tap dance and ended 
with a crew of motley kiddies stepping up a storm rendered all attention to 
actual vocals moot. 
</P>
<P>
Also putting on the rhythmic ritz, with real precision and surrounded by two 
fellow dancers per, were the mockingly self-worshipful Madonna (opening the 
show with "Express Yourself") and the less mockingly narcissistic Bobby Brown. 
Less impressive were minimally choreographed rug-cutting appearances by Cher 
(baring nearly all, natch) and rapper Tone Loc (flashing his bulging tummy for 
a moment but otherwise baring minimal dancing skill). 
</P>
<P>
Since most of the instrumentals were obviously canned -- as if there weren't 
enough lip-syncs and hand-syncs, even Abdul's celebrated tap dance was in fact 
a toe-sync -- all these fast moves provided most of the real excitement of the 
show, which was gamely cheer-led for the second year in a row by obsequious 
host Arsenio Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Some live playing was evident -- Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora of Bon Jovi 
did a couple of pretty acoustic numbers ("Livin' on a Prayer" and "Wanted Dead 
or Alive"), their self-mythologizing hard-rock cowboy lingo somehow less 
noxious from guys sitting on stools than from guys strutting. And the Cure and 
Cher's band seemingly had their instruments turned on. The surprise finale had 
Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers joined by Guns N' Roses' Axl Rose for duets 
of "Free Fallin'," an excellent Petty ballad that Rose had trouble fitting 
into, and a raved-up "Heartbreak Hotel," which brought out the famous Axl 
screech. Softer-headed were the tape-bound hard rockers Def Leppard and a 
ridiculous-looking Cult of no personality. 
</P>
<P>
As further proof that this was not Memorex, there was infamous 
I-hate-chicks-ha-ha comedian Andrew Dice Clay, who lapsed into his usual 
foul-mouthed misogyny -- much to the alleged surprise of the producers. (Home 
viewers missed the amusing sight of producer Dick Clark coming onto the stage 
and glaring at Clay from 10 paces during the monologue.) MTV VP Barry Kluger 
issued an apology backstage and decreed Clay's banishment from the channel, 
saying that "Clay did not do this in rehearsal and we were very surprised by 
it." 
</P>
<P>
These high-profile celebrity appearances are what the MTV Awards are about, not 
the statuettes themselves, which carry little of the prestige of the Grammys. 
(Quick, ask the kid down your block who won for "Best Post-Modern.") The show 
is interesting mostly for its lineup and as a gauge of how increasingly savvy 
MTV is about being all things to all teens -- blacks as well as whites, in 
contrast to the channel's notoriously lily-white early days. Still, there were 
noteworthy surprises among the prizes themselves: 
</P>
<P>
No one can claim that the awards are stacked by MTV after the win given by the 
700-plus industry voters to Neil Young's "This Note's for You" in the highly 
regarded best video category. This was, after all, the controversial piece of 
satire that brought the cable channel a flood of bad publicity -- and enmity 
from Young -- for its refusal to air the video until very late in its shelf 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Another upset came in the male video category, which went to Elvis Costello for 
his stunning, touching "Veronica" clip despite more commercial contenders like 
Bobby Brown and Steve Winwood. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other winners: Living Colour picked up three awards for best group, 
stage performance and new artist. George Michael received the "Video Vanguard" 
award for career achievement. Madonna's clips claimed prizes for 
cinematography, direction and art direction, in addition to her "People's 
Choice" award for "Like a Prayer," voted by callers during the telecast.

<LEADPARA>  The teeny-bop sensation New Kids on the Block knocked TV dad Bill Cosby out of
the No. 1 spot on Forbes' list of the world's 40 richest entertainers.;   The
musical group's projected earnings for 1990 and 1991 total $115 million,
Forbes said in its Sept. 30 issue, released Sunday.  </LEADPARA>

COSBY DROPS FROM TOP OF FORBES' LIST  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Cosby's millions; Cosby, who collects millions every month on syndicated
reruns of the "Cosby Show" alone, comes in a close second. His 1990-'91
earnings will total about $113 million, the magazine said.;   The estimated
gross incomes are based on two-year projections because of the lag time
between an entertainer's work and the compensation for it.;   Forbes said its
figures were calculated through talks with industry executives, lawyers,
agents and managers. It said earnings figures for recording artists were based
on royalty payments from record and video sales and estimated pre-tax gross
for concert tours.;   This year's survey marks the first time since Forbes
began compiling its annual list of top-paid entertainers in 1987 that neither
Michael Jackson nor Bill Cosby held the No. 1 position.;   Jackson drops to
5th; With estimated 1990-'91 earnings of $60 million, Jackson ranked fifth,
down from second place last year.;   Taking third and fourth place
respectively were two female sensations best known by their first names --
Oprah and Madonna.;   TV talk host Oprah Winfrey -- whose straightforward TV
banter reaches 99 percent of the U.S. television markets and 15 foreign
countries -- will make an estimated $80 million in 1990-'91; Madonna's raunchy
lyrics and stage act will give her $63 million.; Here is Forbes' list:;   1.
New Kids on the Block, pop music group, $115 million.;   2. Bill Cosby, 54,
television personality, $113 million.;   3. Oprah Winfrey, 37, talk-show host,
$80 million.;   4. Madonna, singer, 33, $63 million.;   5. Michael Jackson,
33, singer, $60 million.;   6. Kevin Costner, actor-director, 36, $59

LIZ SMITH: MATERIAL GIRL MADONNA WILL BE PERFECT AS 'EVITA'

"I WORSHIP the paper he writes on!" That's what Madonna says about the prolific 
and talented Andrew Lloyd Webber -- and with good reason. Any minute, there 
will be an official announcement stating that the star of the coming "Dick 
Tracy" movie is definitely set to play the long a'borning female protagonist in 
the film version of "Evita." 
</P>
<P>
I know, I know -- Madonna was up for this movie once before and it didn't work 
out. Then-to-be-director Oliver Stone wanted her to audition for him before she 
could be cast; he says Madonna refused. (As you know, practically every actress 
who can even hum has been considered for the role of the late wife of the 
Argentine dictator, Juan Peron of the '40s.) 
</P>
<P>
Stone went on actually to audition and then hire Meryl Streep for the part. The 
actress bowed out some months ago, saying she was exhausted. This was in the 
middle of her back-to-back filmings of "She-Devil" and "Postcards From the 
Edge." Now Stone is also out of the "Evita" project. 
</P>
<P>
This time, no director has yet been chosen. But the movie will begin filming in 
the fall. I think Madonna was born to play Eva Peron and she may just be 
brilliant as the infamous first lady who sings Tim Rice's immortal words, 
"Don't cry for me, Argentina!" If everything goes according to plan, Webber 
will be a very busy man from now until at least the end of the year. He'll have 
two of the biggest movie projects in show biz history -- "Evita" and "The 
Phantom of the Opera" being filmed at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
OH, FORGET those ridiculous gloom and doom rumors about liquor bottles hidden 
under her bed and just know that Elizabeth Taylor is doing just fine. She is 
already 43 pounds lighter and in good spirits. The other day, Shirley MacLaine 
came to visit La Liz at St. John's Hospital, bearing a large chocolate cake in 
an unmentionable male shape. She also brought along a naughty X-rated movie. 
The two famous ladies devoured half the cake and hooted and howled at the film. 
</P>
<P>
MTV HAS shown us Cher's nearly naked backside (after 9 p.m. at night, that is) 
and they've offered up Madonna in chains. But the powers that be at MTV draw 
the line at "male" bondage. At least they weren't too thrilled with the group 
Revenge and their "Pineapple Face" video. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Playboy's Suze Randall, this offering has been deemed 
"unacceptable," because -- among other things -- it features male band members 
wearing chastity belts around their necks. 
</P>
<P>
Just remember how fastidious MTV can be the next time they show you some half 
nude woman squirming and writhing under male domination. MTV does have its 
limits -- sort of. Chauvinistic ones.

Madonna on Tour: Who's That Girl?

   "Youse girls big Madonna fans?" the Jersey dude asked three fetching young women in the throng at Veterans Stadium hoping to score last-minute tickets for the Corsetted One's imminent concert. 
"Nah," one of them replied, "we just want to party." 

   They came to the right place. 
On Saturday, the steamiest night of the year here, a crowd of 47,000 turned the home of the Phillies into the hottest dance party in town. 
The first rumble of Madonna's band brought the spectators to their feet, on top of their seats -- and they didn't come down for a sweaty two hours. 

   In addition to all the girls who wanted to have fun, the largely college-age crowd included lots of guys, like the brawny pair sharing a bottle of Jack Daniel's and beer chasers. 
There were kids with grown-ups, and grown-ups without kids. 
In scarce supply, though, were "wanna-bes" -- the pubescent hordes outfitted in vintage Madonna mode with fingerless lace gloves, Merry Widow bustiers and floppy hair bows -- who packed the houses for Madonna's Virgin Tour in 1985. 

   This may be a sign of their maturity -- or hers. 
The current Madonna look -- platinum tresses and retro movie-queen glamour -- is a lot more difficult to pull off than slapping on a couple of crucifixes. 

   Keyboard player Pat Leonard votes for maturity. 
"There are more adults in the audience this time, which I attribute to the songs on the latest album being more mature," said Leonard, who co-wrote several of these songs and is now leading Madonna's seven-member band on a U.S. tour scheduled to run through Aug. 9. 

   Not so long ago, it seemed to many that the brash young woman from Bay City, Mich., was just a lucky star, a pop-tart whose bellybutton-baring videos and glossy dance tracks amounted to little more than a novelty act. 
Were they ever wrong. 

   Today Madonna's three Sire albums have sold more than 30 million copies. 
Her infectious, dance-conscious songs have scored 11 consecutive Top 5 hits -- a record topped only by Elvis in the '50s and the Beatles in the '60s. 
Despite the occasional misstep, mostly in projects undertaken with hubby Sean Penn, Madonna has generally been very able at exploiting her many talents -- as a creditable live performer and dancer on the Virgin Tour; as an actress in the movie "Desperately Seeking Susan"; and as a producer and songwriter on her latest album, "True Blue." 

   But even so -- perhaps because her campy "Boy Toy" image was misread as bimbo -- she gets little respect. 
It's as though, for all her accomplishments, Madonna still has something to prove on every outing. 

   That's why, when the time came to promote her newest projects (the movie "Who's That Girl" and its soundtrack album) a stadium tour must have seemed the logical choice. 
After all, the legendary names in pop, the Springsteens and the Stones, play stadiums. 
It would be, literally, a new arena to conquer. 

   There were also seductive commercial considerations. 
Madonna did not want to do a long tour, her publicist says. 
In one date at the Vet, she could sell the same number of tickets as in three nights at this city's major indoor venue. 
And the terms she was able to command would make any Material Girl pant (a reported $500,000 per show guarantee plus a percentage of the gross on all those $21 ducats). 

   Thus was conceived the Who's That Girl 1987 World Tour, Madonna's vision of "Broadway in a stadium." 
The production, which took four months to put together, is big in every respect. 
It's directed and staged by a big-name choreographer, Jeffrey ("Flashdance") Hornaday. 
It has a big-time band, most of which also played on the Jacksons' Victory Tour. 
It even has a big stage -- so big it takes three days to assemble. (Because of this, three identical stages are being used for the tour.) 

   But when it comes to pop concerts, bigger is not necessarily better. 
The main lure of the live experience -- what can make it worth standing on a chair for two hours being jostled and sweated on by strangers -- is the opportunity it affords performers and their audiences to forge a personal bond. 
It's well nigh impossible to feel the force of even the most charismatic personality when the star is a home-run's distance away. 

   Madonna tried her trouper's best to get the audience into her groove. 
She sang strongly, during dynamic production numbers and intimate ballads. 
She danced energetically -- and more intelligently than on the last tour. 
Her newly taut body gave the choreography an added edge. 
The skips, spins and angular freezes were familiar from her videos, but looked fresh in the extended routines. 

   Madonna whipped Marlene Stewart's costumes on and off her basic bordello corset so that the pace never let up. (At one point she even made like Superwoman and changed in a big red telephone booth on stage.) 
All the while, she poked knowing fun at her image, joking bawdily with the crowd. 
"Now stop throwing your underpants up here," she called out at one point. 
"I don't wear them." 

   But all this showmanship wasn't enough to overcome the cavernous setting. 
Madonna's voice didn't suffer; it's the kind of piercing, metallic instrument suited for stadium amplification, where only the high timbres tend to survive the mix. 
The band didn't fare as well. 
What one could hear of it through the mix sounded good. 
But the double-key board attack was muffled, the nuances of the musicianship missed. 

   What you couldn't hear, however, was nothing compared with what most of the stadium crowd couldn't see. 
Even from my perch in the 28th row, some of Madonna's floor work was visible only on the two giant video screens bookending the stage. 
But from up in the grandstand, where I went to watch the encores, Madonna was a Lilliputian figure, the carefully wrought choreography no more compelling than the movements of ants on a hill. 
Despite all the warmth and care visible at close range, from most of the stadium Madonna looked very much like a wee, almost immaterial girl.
