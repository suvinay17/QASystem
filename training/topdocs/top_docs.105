<LEADPARA>  WHEN the word "chili" is mentioned, images of tortured diners with flames
leaping from their mouths come to mind. Of course, a healthy sprinkle of
jalapenos will add an impressive tingle to most tongues. But the chili's role
in Mexican cuisine is hardly limited to culinary pyrotechnics.;   The
immensely versatile and popular chili poblano is a case in point. It has a
subtle piquancy, rich, mellow flavor and firm, meaty flesh. It can be the star
of the show, such as in a hearty chili relleno, or used as a flavoring.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     At its most dazzling, the stuffed poblano is dressed up in the colors of
the Mexican flag -- red, white and green -- in the dish Chiles en Nogada.
Served in this manner on Mexico's Independence Day on Monday, the chilies are
filled with a sweet ground-beef stuffing, studded with pineapple and raisins,
drenched in a creamy walnut sauce and garnished with deep red pomegranate
seeds and parsley.;   While poblanos are popular year-round in Mexico, they
literally explode onto the scene in their high season, starting in June and
peaking in September. I remember passing countless summer afternoons in the
bustling market near my home, marveling at the wondrous things the women found
to do with the poblano harvest.;   My favorite treats by far were those warm
tortilla bundles that held a delicate mixture of fresh poblanos sauteed with
onions and creme fraiche. To this day when I whip up this simple dish, it
brings back the smell and feel of my childhood summers.;   Something magical
happens to the poblano when it is dried. Not only does its name change -- the
light green variety becomes chili ancho, while the darker chili is dubbed the
chili mulatto -- but its flesh takes on a rich smoky flavor, similar to a
sun-dried tomato but with a special kick.;   Both fresh and dried poblanos are
readily available at supermarkets and produce stores in this country. However,
shopping for them can be confusing. Depending on where they are grown, the
names of these chilies vary tremendously. When cultivated in California, both
fresh and dried poblanos are referred to as chili pasilla.;   To bring out the
unique flavor of fresh poblano, it is best to roast it over the direct flame
of a gas stove or under a broiler. The traditional procedure is to char the
chili on all sides and place it in a paper bag. After "sweating" the chili for
8 to 10 minutes, peel off the thin skin and rinse the chili under a stream of
running water.;   The next important step is to devein the pepper. This means
removing the thin, lightly colored veins inside that give the chili its fire.
To do so, slit the poblano carefully along the side and remove the veins with
a sharp knife. The aroma of the chili will permeate the air, giving you an
idea of how piquant it is.;   When preparing dried poblanos -- or any dried
chili, for that matter -- it is important to rinse them thoroughly before
cooking. Mexicans traditionally dry chilies in the open air, and dust and dirt
can become trapped in the vegetable's irregular surface.;   Cooking with fresh
and dried poblanos is a great way to begin exploring the vast and varied world
of Mexican chilies.;   (hbox);   This famous dish, native to Puebla,
commemorates Independence Day. Its colors are those of the Mexican flag --
green, white and red. Though there are many ingredients, it is not a difficult
dish to make if you take it one step at a time.; CHILES EN NOGADA; (Stuffed

   Who's doing Thanksgiving this year?
   Is it at your children's, and are they cooking up the big bird
with all the trimmings, celebrating with their favorite foods and
introducing them to their children? Or is it just the two of you,
where a capon, duck or Cornish hen with a tasty stuffing,
vegetables, salad and a light dessert fit the bill?
   Whatever the setting or number of people, all the holiday
favorites bring back memories of this wonderful day from our own
childhoods.
   At our house, it was old-fashioned stuffing: white bread,
celery, onions and a hefty sprinkling from a yellow poultry
seasoning box with an illustrated turkey on it. A lot of stuffing
went inside me and come dinnertime, my appetite was diminished. My
grandmother always made salted cashews for holiday dinners, baked
until a burnished bronze, rubbed with brown paper to remove excess
fat, then placed in tiny silver nut dishes that I had polished. My
sister, Gerry, and I would tiptoe around the table taking a nut or
two from each dish; my hunch is the grownups were aware of the
game, but winked it away.
   It's very likely that we'll enjoy many of our favorites:
cranberry sauce, sweet potato pudding, mashed potatoes with gravy,
creamed onions, tunips, green beans, pumpkin or mincemeat pie. To
really enjoy the day, we should eat smaller portions, but not enjoy
it less.
   If you are having Thanksgiving with your family, you may want to
pitch in the next day and do something with the leftovers. Turkey
salad with fall fruits would be a delightful entree that puts the
bird in a different setting.
   If it's dinner a deux, a light, refreshing all-natural fruit ice
cream dessert leaves out the cream and eggs but doesn't change the
flavor or texture.
   And if you're taking a covered dish, turnip souffle is a part of
the traditional vegetable scene that even non-turnip fans will like.

<LEADPARA>  SO, WHAT'S growing out on the farm that's new and exciting? At first glance,
not much.;   Unless you are a winter squash or root vegetable zealot, cold
weather produce can be challenging. It is not as flashy as
straight-off-the-vine summer produce and it's not as approachable because it
takes more effort to cook with. But, believe me, fall produce is worth the
effort, especially because of its warm earthy flavors and colors.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Food  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  DELICIOUS PUMPKINS AREN'T JUST FOR FUNNY FACES  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Seasonal produce; Chef Jesse Cool is co-founder of Flea Street Cafe and Late

<TEXT>     Burnt sienna russet potatoes, golden sugary beets, brackish green acorn
squash, crimson radishes and baby ochre carrots are beginning to replace the
final blaze of ripe tomatoes, peppers and raspberries. All are an invitation
to good fall eating, but nothing is more plentiful in October than pumpkins.; 
 Halloween sends us to the pumpkin patch for jack-o'-lanterns but, lest we
forget, pumpkins are simply a variety of winter squash -- good for the table
in more than one way. Though the big orange, carving pumpkins get all the
attention, we see more and more white ones on the market. Little Boos, with
their hard white skin, are not for cooking. They will add a festive touch to
an arrangement of Indian corn and decorative gourds that will last until
Thanksgiving.;   Those cute little miniature pumpkins also are better for
decoration than cooking because they are very difficult to cut and clean. In
addition, their flesh is not very sweet.;   Big pumpkins, with their hollow
cavities and thin lining of meat, beg to be used as attractive terrines for
soups and stews.;   To do this, cut off the top as you would for a carved
jack-o'-lantern, seed and brush the inside with oil, salt and pepper. Bake
uncovered in the oven at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes or until it is
tender when pierced with a fork. Fill with just about any piping hot
concoction and place in the middle of the table with warm corn muffins.;  
After ladling the filling into bowls, top with scoops of the tender pumpkin
flesh.;   When you visit the pumpkin patch, choose a few small ones for use in
cooking. Be sure to get cooking pumpkins rather than decorative ones. Look for
smaller ones, especially smaller Sugar Pie pumpkins. They generally weigh
between six and eight pounds.;   The meat on these (smaller pumpkins) is
delicate, sweet and purees well. Have you ever made a pumpkin pie with this
fresh pulp? It's fabulous. Follow your favorite recipe, but substitute fresh
mashed pumpkin or squash. I always leave a few lumps to add a refreshing
unrefined quality to this harvest dessert. In general, 1 pound of raw pumpkin
equals 1 1/2 to 2 cups pureed.;   Early white pumpkins are softer skinned and
have a delicate, tender, sweet flesh. Try them in a recipe that does not call
for the orange color to enhance the dish. If used in pumpkin pie, expect a
paler version.;   The remaining melange of winter squash deserves further
attention and I will do that in the Nov. 6 produce column.;   Meanwhile, there
are a few new items on the market.;   (check) Pomegranates bring back memories
of fall in Pennsylvania when my mother would give them to us as an
after-school treat. We would sit in nearby cow pastures eating them, our hands
and mouths turning magenta with juice as we spit the seeds every which way.;  
Pomegranate juice makes an extraordinary marinade. Blend the juice with garlic
and cloves and use the mixture to marinate meat or fowl. Roast the meat or
fowl with chunks of pumpkin, basting both often. Serve with couscous or rice.;
  (check) Fennel is in its prime right now, but it is a very misunderstood and
mystifying vegetable. People seem to stand at the produce stand and ponder its
use.;   Fresh fennel is a hearty vegetable. It has a mild anisette flavor and
the consistency of celery. The two can be interchanged. The smaller heads are
best used raw in salads. Larger ones roast well. Cut into big chunks, coat
with olive oil and roast at 375 degrees until soft. Braise in chicken broth
and toss with rice or risotto.;   If you're more interested in ways to use
fall produce such as pumpkin and winter squash, you might want to attend two
classes on the subject I'll be teaching at Draeger's Cooking School in Menlo
Park on Oct. 17. Call (415) 688-0688 to reserve a spot.;   Meanwhile, keep
eating those fresh string beans, tomatoes, and peppers while they last. Keep
in mind that apples are a good choice over unripe pears.;   Venture into fall,
but pay attention to your own garden and the lingering treasures of summer.;
Cool tips; (box) Get the kids to paint rather than carve faces on their
jack-o'-lanterns. They keep indefinitely if not carved and you can then
recycle them by getting the children to help you bake a real pumpkin pie when
Halloween is over.; (box) Stuff a whole pumpkin with your favorite savory
stuffing. Bake until the pumpkin is fork-tender and slice as a side dish or an
unusual vegetarian entree.; (box) Use cooked, pureed pumpkin as a thickener
for soups or stews. It adds a sweet, deep quality.; (box) Peel and cube
pumpkin, steam it and toss with pasta, sweet and hot chilies, garlic, cilantro
and olive oil. Grate Cheddar cheese over all.; (box) Thinly slice raw pumpkin
and saute with butter until tender. Splash with a bit of brandy and sprinkle
with brown sugar and serve as a side dish to crispy fried chicken.  </TEXT>

HOLIDAYS: FOUR RENOWNED L.A. CHEFS SAY 'YES' WITH FANTASTIC LOW-FAT FEASTS.

A magnificent crown roast. Creamy mounds of mashed potatoes. Aromatic mincemeat 
pie perfumed with spices. This is the time of year when tables sag beneath the 
weight of sumptuous feasts. It is the time of generous holiday dinners, when we 
expect -- and want -- food to taste especially rich. This is not the time to 
even think about lean or light or low-fat fare. Or is it? 
</P>
<P>
Is it possible to get through the holidays without wreaking havoc on your diet? 
Can eating right be every bit as delicious as eating wrong? The Times asked 
four well-known restaurant chefs to develop holiday menus using a minimum of 
fat. We suspected that even the experts would find it difficult to create a 
harmonious balance between food that is good for you and food that tastes 
wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
We were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"Menus like these are great examples of how you can have wonderful, flavorful 
food that just happens to be healthy," said Evelyn Tribole, the registered 
dietitian who helped develop the market basket of limited fats. "It shows that 
low fat doesn't mean you have to choose between alfalfa sprouts and chocolate 
cream pie at the Christmas dinner table." 
</P>
<P>
Take Patrick Clark of Bice Ristorante. "We spare no amounts of butter," Clark 
says of the Christmas dinner he cooks for his wife and four children. Though 
the restaurant features dishes such as cheese-stuffed ravioli in walnut sauce 
and scallops in a lobster-saffron broth, the Clark Christmas table reflects 
Southern hospitality at its finest: roast beef, ham and turkey, plus chestnut 
and oyster stuffing and sweet potatoes. "It's very ethnic, hearty, hefty food," 
Clark says, "and a lot of it." 
</P>
<P>
But Clark had no trouble coming up with a wonderful holiday menu that 
restricted the fat to 30%. His menu reflects his affection for lavish food, and 
you'd never know that the thick, smoky celery root soup is made with no cream 
(rice is the trick) and just a single strip of bacon. You couldn't feel 
deprived after feasting on pheasant, couscous with pumpkin and pine nuts and a 
wonderful warm pear compote. Less than 30% fat? Nobody would ever know it. 
</P>
<P>
When Tony Di Lembo of Indigo reminisces about Christmas at home, he remembers 
how well his family ate. "When I was a kid, we had a traditional non-meat day 
before Christmas Day," he says. He recalls eating some "pretty weird stuff." 
The Christmas menu in his Italian home often centered entirely around fish: an 
octopus salad or eels sauced with olive oil, garlic and perhaps some fresh 
tomato. "My grandmother used to buy live eels and she would keep them alive. 
I'd peer over the sink and see these live eels swishing around." 
</P>
<P>
With this background, it's not surprising that Di Lembo had no trouble coming 
up with a festive holiday menu that is only around 30% fat. His salad is tossed 
with walnuts and just enough Roquefort to torque up the flavors; there's a 
simple, but far from ordinary grilled breast of chicken served with a zesty 
cranberry-pear chutney and a truly spicy corn-and-wild-rice salad. By dessert 
time, you're grateful for the cool simplicity of the fresh-squeezed orange 
juice gelatin. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Clark and Di Lembo, brothers Toribio and Javier Prado of Cha Cha Cha and 
Prado Restaurant were raised vegetarian; they learned early to appreciate the 
advantage of eating light -- even at Christmastime. "We ate mostly grains and 
pasta and a lot of fruit and nuts," says Toribio. 
</P>
<P>
Their menu of low-fat party foods is notable not only for its good taste but 
also for its extraordinary eye appeal; this is very pretty food. It starts with 
a spectacular salad made of colorful grilled vegetables and goes on to Cornish 
hens served with a sauce made of papaya, pineapple, cranberries and herbs. The 
side dish, a colorful counterpoint of rice and beans, adds substance. For 
dessert there is a fruit "flan" flavored with vanilla and colored with 
pomegranate juice. Their menu is less than 25% fat -- but this is entirely 
festive food.

AL TAYEBET'S WONDERFUL THINGS: SOUR CHERRIES AND SUJUK

<P>
Al-Tayebat Middle Eastern Grocery, 1217 S. Brookhurst St., Anaheim, (714) 
520-4723. Open Monday-Saturday 9 a.m.-7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In Arabic, Al-Tayebat means wonderful things. It's a fitting name for a market 
with butchers who make lamb sausages studded with pine nuts and hand-cut shish 
kebabs to order from fresh sides of halal lamb. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't buy precut meat," says Al-Tayebat's owner, Sami Khouraki, who comes 
from a family of Syrian merchants. 
</P>
<P>
Al-Tayebat carries the fresh seasonal herbs, fruits and vegetables used in 
Middle Eastern cooking: eggplants the size of your thumb, 2-foot-long 
pale-green English butter gourd and the tart, unripe grapes and sour red 
cherries used for flavoring Iranian meat dishes. 
</P>
<P>
But you don't have to cook Syrian, Lebanese or Iranian food to appreciate the 
store's conventional produce. I found Spanish saffron, shimmering green 
Lebanese extra-virgin olive oil and sour cherry preserves from a Belgian 
company, thick with whole fruit. And on the day I was there, five kinds of 
pears were displayed. One flaming scarlet variety was fully ripe and juicy -- a 
rare occurrence these days. There were also huge red grapes the size of walnuts 
and pencil-thin yellow wax beans. 
</P>
<P>
Each morning at 3:30, Khouraki, a former manager for the K mart Corp., drives 
downtown to the Los Angeles Central Produce Market, although his store is 
located in Anaheim. He prefers to select the produce himself rather than having 
it delivered sight unseen. 
</P>
<P>
And he has the butchers in Al-Tayebat's modest meat department prepare kufta to 
each customer's specifications. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people like their kufta seasoned with hot pepper, others prefer sweet 
pepper or cinnamon," Khouraki says. "And though lamb is traditional, we also 
get calls to make it with beef." 
</P>
<P>
Culinarily speaking, the Middle East begins in the Balkans and extends right up 
to the edge of India, dipping down to Northern Africa. And though each country 
has its distinct cuisine, Al-Tayebat caters to them all. These countries use 
similar ingredients, and their tables have long been a product of cultural 
exchange prompted by the comings and goings of pilgrims, trade caravans and 
invaders. Certain staples are widespread, such as lamb, wheat, rice, eggplant 
and olives. 
</P>
<P>
So the plump, fresh walnut halves behind Al-Tayebat's counter might end up in 
Lebanese baklava or a Georgian satsivi (cold chicken with a spicy walnut 
sauce); the filo dough may wrap Greek tiropita or Yugoslavia's meat borek, and 
the small eggplants could be stuffed with walnuts and then pickled to make 
Syrian beitinjan makbus or sauteed for a Turkish rice pilaf. 
</P>
<P>
When you shop at Al-Tayebat, take a shopping basket rather than try to 
manipulate a cart through the store's narrow aisles -- although carts won't be 
a problem much longer. Khouraki has acquired the adjoining property, and the 
remodeled store will nearly double the space for Al-Tayebat's wonderful things. 
</P>
<P>
SHOPPING LIST: 
</P>
<P>
 Halal lamb: The fine-quality lamb carried at Al-Tayebat is halal -- which 
means it has been butchered according to Islamic religious prescriptions. You 
can purchase whole or half lambs for roasting and perhaps to stuff in the 
traditional Greek or Armenian way. 
</P>
<P>
If you need less meat, the butcher will bone a leg of lamb with a pocket to 
hold stuffing. Each country has its own stuffing recipes. In Syria and Lebanon 
it's likely to be a simple combination of garlic and herbs or a more elaborate 
one of chopped figs, raisins and prunes (about 2 ounces each) with 1/2 teaspoon 
each of dried thyme and sage and sprinkled with a little melted butter. The 
stuffed pocket must be tied shut before the meat is roasted. 
</P>
<P>
Another specialty Al-Tayebat's customers might have the butchers prepare is 
meat for Chelo Kebab: lamb cut into wide strips, to be marinated in yogurt or 
lemon juice and olive oil. After a charcoal grilling, the meat may be served 
with rice that has been cooked so that it has a crisp crust at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb is also the main ingredient in many of the famous Iranian stews known as 
khoresh. The ingredients in a khoresh, which can include fruit and nuts or 
pomegranate juice, make a lush sauce. And the khoresh is always served over a 
huge mound of fragrant basmati-style rice to absorb it. 
</P>
<P>
Ma'ani: These lamb sausages are made in Egypt and the Fertile Crescent (the 
pronunciation of the name varies from region to region -- in written Arabic 
it's naqaniq). Khouraki is justifiably proud of the shop's small, finger-length 
ma'ani scented with a seasoning that includes allspice, cloves and pine nuts. 
</P>
<P>
Sujuk: This is the Turkish- and Armenian-style cured beef sausage. Most 
Armenian-Middle Eastern delis sell commercially made sujuk. Al-Tayebat's 
butchers prepare their own, which is not cured as long. As a result, the 
sausage is pleasantly moist. Saute chunks of the sujuk and toss it with cut 
tomatoes for an appetizer, or use it in scrambled eggs and omelets. 
</P>
<P>
SPECIALTY PRODUCE: 
</P>
<P>
Before the days of hydroponic gardening and international fruit imports, the 
seasons dictated what was put on the table. This seasonality still rules 
Al-Tayebat's produce department. Items come and go according to their growing 
time. Off-season, just as in the Middle East, you'll find some fruits and 
vegetables dried. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh dates: If you've eaten only dried dates, the subtle perfume-like flavor 
of the fresh ones will surprise you. Fresh dates come to market in September 
for only about 10 days, and Al-Tayebat sells them in bunches just as they come 
from the tree. 
</P>
<P>
Green almonds: These are picked while the outer shell is still green and before 
the nut has ripened. The immature almond is a faintly flavored jelly. Green 
almonds are available in June. 
</P>
<P>
Young fava beans: The mature and dry fava beans so often called for in Middle 
Eastern recipes need to be shelled and then have the skin of each bean removed. 
But in the fall, when young favas are in season, cooks rejoice for they can 
serve the tender beans unpeeled either raw as mezzeh (appetizers), or lightly 
cooked. 
</P>
<P>
Molukhia: This exotic green leafy vegetable gives its name to an Egyptian soup. 
"Similar to spinach," is how some describe molukhia, but its properties are 
quite different. The leaves release a viscous liquid as they cook, rather like 
okra, which thickens soups and stews. Fresh molukhia is only available in the 
summer, but it is always dried for winter cooking. In Egypt the molukhia soup, 
which some families eat every day, is served sprinkled with ta'leya, a paste of 
crushed garlic and coriander fried in clarified butter. The soup is always 
consumed with lots of rice on the side. 
</P>
<P>
Quinces: Golden in color and shaped like lumpy, slightly elongated apples, 
quinces are a mainstay in Middle Eastern confectionary and a popular ingredient 
in Iranian meat stews. Because they yield abundant pectin, the fruit can easily 
be cooked up into the conserves, fruit leather and the jellied confections so 
popular there. The fruit isn't sweet enough to eat raw, but when cooked slowly, 
as in a Moroccan tajine, it develops a delectable fruity taste. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh sour cherries: Also known as alubalu, these are another fruit often 
cooked with meat. Until recently, they've only been available dried or as a 
preserve, but now Al-Tayebat carries this particular type of cherry fresh 
during the summer. Iranians stew them with lamb and lentils or use them in 
their famous alubalu polo, a cherry-studded rice dish cooked with chicken. The 
cherries make a superlative jam that is served with thick cream for dessert. It 
also makes a delicious drink mixed with ice water; you eat the cherries from 
the bottom of the glass when you've finished drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Unripe grapes: The sour liquid pressed from unripe grapes is available all 
year long in bottled form, but for a few weeks in the late summer, the unripe 
grapes themselves are available at Al-Tayebat. The taste of their juice is much 
sharper and more astringent than lemon or lime juice. It adds sparkle to rich 
meat and cooked fruit dishes such as an Iranian khoresh. 
</P>
<P>
 Karg: In her book "The Cuisine of Armenia," Sonia Uvezian observes, "the 
Armenian enthusiasm for stuffing foods reaches its zenith with vegetables and 
fruits that can be hollowed out." The long, narrow karg, also known as opo or 
English butter gourd, is a perfect vehicle for those famous Armenian stuffings. 
These are elegantly seasoned mixtures of ground meats with rice or bulgur and 
sometimes nuts. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional cooks simmer the stuffed vegetables in broth with lemon juice and a 
little olive oil, but you can also microwave them in a lightly covered glass 
dish. The broth, when poured into the cooking implement should reach about 
three-quarters of the way up the side of the squash. 
</P>
<P>
Butter gourd is also delicious simply steamed and buttered or mixed into stewed 
dishes or soups. 
</P>
<P>
Kusa: Another squash good for stuffing or just eating plain. It resembles a 
pudgy green and white pin-striped zucchini with wavy stripes. 
</P>
<P>
Middle Eastern cucumbers: These are so good that they are often eaten like 
fruit. They inevitably turn up in the ever-present bowl of salad vegetables 
that is placed unadorned on the Middle Eastern mealtime table; everyone simply 
slices off pieces to munch. 
</P>
<P>
When you taste the pale green moqti (the cucumber with raised lengthwise ridges 
also known as Armenian cucumber or ghoota), you'll understand the appeal of 
this custom. Moqti is one of the most delicate and fruit-like cucumbers I have 
ever tasted. Another delicious cucumber sold at Al-Tayebat is the midget, dark 
green khiar. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh herbs: Al-Tayebat has wonderful bushy bunches of fresh tarragon, various 
mints, dill, tarragon, cilantro, chives and the garlic greens known as garlic 
chives. 
</P>
<P>
STAPLES: 
</P>
<P>
Middle Eastern olives: The importance of olives in the Middle East is summed up 
with the Lebanese saying, "Wheat and oil are pillars of the house and olives 
are the sultan of the table." The Syrians, who grow an astounding variety of 
olives, cure them at all stages of ripeness to produce an even larger variety. 
Unfortunately, most are only sold domestically. 
</P>
<P>
Al-Tayebat, however, carries Aleppo and Kura olives, two seldom-seen varieties 
from the region. The black, dry-cured Aleppos seem mostly pit but their intense 
flavor is habit-forming. They resemble somewhat the wrinkly dry-cured Moroccan 
olives which the store also carries. A popular way to serve Aleppos, Khouraki 
says, is to marinate them in lemon juice with a little olive oil, a hint of 
Middle Eastern cumin and Aleppo pepper. The Aleppo olives are in the dairy 
cooler case sealed in plastic, not with the other olives in the butcher's case. 
</P>
<P>
The green, cracked Kura olives look almost identical to Greek nafplion olives, 
but have a crisp, slightly bitter taste, different from the tart lemony flavor 
of the Greek olives. Al-Tayebat also carries Greek kalamata olives. 
</P>
<P>
Remember that when a dish calls for cooking with olives, it's best to add them 
at the end of the cooking time so they will just warm through. 
</P>
<P>
Pickles: Even in the modern Middle East, torshi (all kinds of pickles) are made 
and sold in old-fashioned specialty shops. These places are full of color and 
you can always smell the aroma of curing turnips, eggplants and other 
vegetables amid the lively banter of bargaining in process. At Al-Tayebat there 
is a long, well-stocked pickle shelf. There are the ridged moqti cucumbers, hot 
red pickled peppers, leeks, whole baby eggplants and even Italian giardinera. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomegranate molasses: This unsweetened concentrate of pomegranate juice is 
used when a dish needs the flavor of the fruit, but not too much liquid. 
Muhammara, a spicy dip for mezzeh, is an example. Many recipes call for 
pomegranate juice instead, however, which is also available bottled. 
</P>
<P>
Jibna Khadra: The name of this fresh, bland cheese literally means green (that 
is, uncured) cheese. It isn't an eating cheese but rather a basic ingredient in 
dessert pastry fillings and savory pies. Jibna khadra can also be made into 
string cheese by heating and kneading it -- the longer the kneading, the 
stringier the cheese. For Aleppo-style cheese it is kneaded with black caraway 
seeds and mahleb, the fragrant kernels of cherry pits, and then formed into 
patties and stored in brine. Al-Tayebet also sells Aleppo-style cheese ready 
made. You'll find it in jars in the cooler case. 
</P>
<P>
Licorice ramzy: This dried licorice plant is made into a popular iced tea-like 
drink. You simply let it steep, strain it and chill the infusion. 
</P>
<P>
Baba ghannouj: Anyone who has ever prepared this creamy puree of roasted 
eggplant pulp knows what a tedious chore roasting and peeling the charred 
eggplants can be. At Al-Tayebat I came across a brand of canned baba ghannouj 
imported from Lebanon. Al-Wadi baba ghannouj has a nice smoky flavor that many 
commercially prepared brands lack. When you add fresh garlic and olive oil to 
this puree, as the label suggests, your baba ghannouj will taste almost 
homemade. 
</P>
<P>
Sumac: This staple in all Middle Eastern cooking is made from dried, crushed 
sumac berries. You often see in shakers on the tables in Middle Eastern 
restaurants, where it is used to add a tart flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Middle Eastern cumin: Basically the same variety that we see in supermarkets, 
this has a stronger flavor. It comes ground and packaged in plastic bags in 
Al-Tayebat's spice section. 
</P>
<P>
 Like hummus and baba ghannouj, this spicy mixture is designed to be eaten with 
plenty of pita bread and many other small appetizers of the mezzeh table. 
</P>
<P>
 For hot red pepper paste Khouraki uses Indo-European brand, for sweet red 
pepper paste use Adriatic brand.

<TEXT>
PORTUGAL is not the place to go to if you are trying to lose weight. The
Portuguese have large hearts and large appetites to match. They like to tuck
in twice daily to fulsome meals, and tea and cake shops beckon in between.
The influences of nouvelle cuisine, if they exist, were not evident during
my brief visit. I met only homely comfort food, plainly cooked and simply
presented, much of it good. Chaps who have never really grown out of nursery
food will love it, and of course you can move straight on to sticky Elvas
plums and glasses of port when there is no nanny to chivvy you about eating
up everything - although I doubt that many will want to leave out the creamy
cinnamon and lemon-scented rice pudding.
The Portuguese make excellent soups (most meals begin with soup) and
first-class bread. I particularly liked the heavy maize-meal loaves, white
of crust and golden crumbed.
Maize was one of the vegetables brought back from the New World, along with
tomatoes, peppers and potatoes. All these are vital to Portuguese cooking
now, as are the spices seafaring traders returned with from the East, but
the vegetables we were served most often were roots and cabbage.
I bet the Portuguese word for garden is cabbage patch. They have a variety
of cabbage that is all their own, couve gallega. It ought to be a national
emblem, like the Welsh leek, so ubiquitous is it. When finely shredded it is
central to caldo verde, probably the nation's favourite soup, and it is
often mixed with potatoes or moistened bread to make a version of migos,
another hugely popular dish, this one a sort of Portuguese
bubble-and-squeak.
Two of my most vivid images of Portugal concern cabbage. First the sight of
them growing. Every other house seems to boast a single tall row of them.
Standing sentinel by the gate, on long leggy stalks with their large
loose-leafed heads undulating in the breeze, they appear to wave you on your
way.
I saw them a second time in the market, vast squeaky green piles of them
being stuffed into manually operated slicing machines. The machines looked a
bit like my old fashioned meat mincer but were as large as the grinders in a
coffee merchant's. The cabbage emerged as fine as grass cuttings, was packed
into bags and snapped up by shoppers as fast as it was prepared.
Kale is probably our nearest equivalent to Portuguese cabbage, spring greens
can be substituted at a pinch, and I dare say a Whitehall secret service
letter shredder would slice them suitably finely, though you can of course
chop them by hand.
The other convenience veg I found in the market and have not seen elsewhere
was massa de pimentao. This looks disconcertingly like tomato ketchup, but
is in fact a flavoursome paste of skinned and pureed red peppers seasoned
with a little garlic and salt and drizzled with oil so that it will keep for
a couple of days.
Turnip tops, harvested before the root ball is formed, are another favourite
vegetable, while fresh green coriander leaves are the best-loved herb.
Fruit stalls were piled with citrus of all sorts, grapes, figs (including
the best dried figs I have ever tasted), quince and pomegranates.
Driving east from Lisbon towards the border with Spain, through the regions
of Ribatejo and Alto Alentejo, the fertile countryside grows increasingly
lovely. Cork oak and olive groves flourish, eucalyptus shade the road and
quinces fruit grow in the hedgerows. The whitewashed villages are Persil
clean and postcard pretty. Signs of highly mechanised agriculture are few.
We stopped at a farm where I saw my first pomegranate tree. Indulging my
whim, the good natured owner allowed me to climb the tree to pick the fruit,
which I did and promptly fell to the ground. That was ignominious enough.
What was worse was the discovery that I had brought a couple of branches
crashing down with me, crushed under the weight of my Portuguese acquired en
bon point. The taste of that ultra-fresh fruit was exquisite.
The contrast between countryside and capital was marked. I did not stay long
enough in Lisbon to explore it so maybe I did not give myself the chance to
be charmed. But one night was long enough to be appalled by the noise and
the traffic, and long enough to be impressed by the police. I mean a
restaurant of that name, O Policia (tel: Lisbon 76.35.05). This is no
sophisticated city slicker of a place but an unpretentious establishment.
The decor is uninspired but the service is friendly and efficient and the
food was the best I ate in Portugal.
Appetisers included a fine example of presunto ham, neither too dry nor
salty, a creamy ewe's milk cheese, and miniature salt cod fishcakes.
However, the best dish by far, outstanding by any standards, was a richly
savoury casserole that is a speciality of the Alentejo region.
The idea of combining surf with turf has never really appealed to me before,
though I confess I am not averse to steak and kidney pudding with a few
oysters slipped under the crust just before serving, but the Portuguese
marriage of pork with clams as achieved by the kitchen at O Policia was full
of excitingly subtle flavour. Here is my attempt at making this splendid
dish, based on the recipe given by Edite Vieira in The Taste of Portugal
(Robinson Publishing):
PORK WITH CLAMS Serves 4-6 - depending on whether appetites are Portuguese
or modest British.
Loin or leg of pork weighing 2 lb after the rind and bones have been
removed; 2 lb Venus clams; 1 large onion; 3 garlic cloves; 1 tablespoon
sweet paprika; a bay leaf and 2-3 sprigs of parsley; 8 fl oz dry white wine;
2-3 teaspoons wine vinegar; 1 oz lard; 2 tablespoons or so olive oil; 1
tablespoon maize meal or oatmeal.
Chop then crush the garlic to a paste with the paprika and a teaspoon each
of salt and olive oil. Cut the pork into large bite-size chunks. Toss it in
the paste to coat it. Pour on the wine and vinegar. Cover and leave to
marinate overnight.
Drain and dry the pork, reserving the marinade. Let the lard and a couple of
tablespoons of olive oil sizzle in a flameproof casserole or heavy-based
stewpot. Add the meat, colour it all over and remove it.
Chop the onion and fry it gently for five minutes. Return the pork, pour on
the marinade, add the bay leaf and parsley. Cover and cook over a gentle
flame until the meat is perfectly tender. Use a simmer-mat, turn the meat
occasionally and add a splash more liquid if necessary.
While the meat cooks, prepare the shellfish. Fresh clams lack the barnacles
and beards of mussels but they tend to trap a lot of sand in their shells.
To rid them of this, put them into a bucket of cold water, add salt and a
little maize or oatmeal and leave for half an hour. With luck they will open
and feed, disgorging sand in the process. Repeat using fresh salt water and
meal.
Discard any clams that do not close their shells when tapped. Put the rest
into a pan with a few spoonfuls of clean water. Cover and cook for a few
minutes, shaking the pan occasionally, until the clams open.
Throw away any clams that do not open. Add the rest, still in their shells,
to the pork and pour on the juices from the clam pan, straining them through
a muslin-lined sieve. Cook for a few minutes more and check seasoning before
serving with plenty of good bread, preferably Portuguese cornbread, or
boiled or steamed potatoes.

TREATS FOR MEXICAN INDEPENDENCE DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mexican Independence Day this weekend will no doubt inspire a round of 
celebrations. Since parties usually mean chips and dips, this is the time to 
try out a crunchy, full-flavored chip that is authentically Mexican but not 
commonly known: duritos. 
</P>
<P>
Think of duritos as a cross between Indonesian shrimp chips, pasta and 
chicharrones. Raw, they look like strips of hard, ridged, translucent pasta. 
When deep-fried, they puff up like shrimp chips. And they look a little like 
chicharrones -- crisp-fried pork cracklings that also make good snacks. The 
difference is, duritos are made from flour and not from meat. 
</P>
<P>
The raw chips are manufactured in Mexico and exported to Los Angeles. They're 
available here in a variety of markets, among them the Tianguis chain, the 
Grand Central Public Market in downtown Los Angeles and Market Basket in 
Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
Or you can buy bags of fried duritos processed by Del Mar Foods Co. of 
Oceanside and packaged under its Don Victor label. Del Mar produces duritos 
flavored with chili powder and lemon in two sizes -- small dippers and 
large-sized chips. The large chips are also available without seasoning, and 
the little dippers come in two additional flavors: shrimp and jalapeno. 
Tianguis carries the Don Victor chips. 
</P>
<P>
Olvera Street is a good source for another type of treat -- candy. The 
selection of typical Mexican dulces (sweets) displayed in stalls there includes 
biznaga, which is cactus candy. Biznaga is often cut fine and added to the 
filling for chiles en nogada -- fresh poblano chiles stuffed with meat, fruit 
and nuts and topped with walnut sauce and pomegranate seeds. It's a dish linked 
to pomegranate season, which is getting underway now. 
</P>
<P>
Look also for candied sweet potato (camote) and squash (calabaza). Coconut 
turns up in alfajores (blocks of white coconut candy tinted shocking pink on 
one side) and cocadas, baked confections that vendors define as macaroons. 
</P>
<P>
Pepitoria, the Mexican version of pralines, contains either peanuts or pecans. 
And there are individually wrapped circles of mazapan (marzipan) made of 
peanuts ground as fine as dust. 
</P>
<P>
Milk and sugar cooked together is the base for a number of candies including 
jamoncillo (bars of plain milk fudge); rosquilla (ridged bars of 
coconut-flavored milk fudge); marina (balls of milk fudge coated with chopped 
pecans); gorditas de leche (milk fudge patties) and leche quemada (burnt milk 
fudge). 
</P>
<P>
And there's still more -- balls of sweet-sour tamarind-flavored candy, rolls of 
guava paste, melcocha (taffy) and large cookies, either plain or coated with 
multicolored candy sprinkles (grajea). Look for the candies at the stands that 
line the center of the street. 
</P>
<P>
In some Olvera Street shops, you'll find equipment for cooking and serving 
Mexican meals. The Casa de Sousa's stock of pottery includes stunning, large 
talavera-style bowls in deep blue and cream from Guadalajara and a hand-painted 
brown dinner set from Michoacan. Blue-rimmed, handblown glassware and 
ornamental tin service plates would create a striking table. On the practical 
side, there are molcajetes (rough stone mortars), tortilla presses and iron 
comales (griddles) on which to bake the tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
The Casa California offers pottery bean pots and enormous cazuelas that could 
function as serving containers for a large gathering. 
</P>
<P>
Here you will find the highly effective aluminum lime squeezers that are 
manufactured in Mexico. A larger size in the same design is used for oranges. 
Other kitchenware includes wooden spoons, rolling pins and molinillos, the 
wooden beaters that are used to froth hot chocolate. The shop also carries 
yarn-embroidered baskets for tortillas and has at least one of the large, 
unlined copper cazuelas in which Mexican cooks prepare sweets and other dishes.

FT  25 APR 92 / Food &amp; Drink: Recipes to stir the pulses - Cookery /
Vegetarianism has come of age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VEGETARIANISM has come of age at last. Gone are the deadly-serious pulse and
wholegrain menus that lay like lead on the stomach and depressed the spirit
of those who did not worship at the altar of the health food religion.
New-wave vegetarianism is concerned not with cant but with the pleasures of
good eating without meat. Red meat, that is: fish remains on the menu for
many and game and poultry for some. The new style is generous of spirit,
full of joie de vivre, rich in textures, bursting with fresh tastes, often
robust but also capable of lovely subtleties.
The most exciting new exponent is a young cook called Annie Bell, whose
first book has just been published: A Feast of Flavours, subtitled The New
Vegetarian Cuisine (Bantam Pounds 14.99).
Bell is a talented and instinctive cook, no stickler for the confines of
tradition but breaking new ground happily with her own menu structures. Her
meals are designed as 'a series of little courses that complement and mingle
with each other' rather than what my husband calls the obligatory
three-piece suite: first course, main course and pudding.
The idea is appealing, but I am not convinced entirely that some of her
menus are practicable. It is all very well for caterers and chefs (she is a
caterer) to continue working behind the scenes as a meal progresses, and to
deliver an extra little dish here and there. But most home cooks, surely,
want to hang up their aprons when the doorbell rings and spend the evening
with those gathered round the table.
Perhaps I am just too old a dog to learn new tricks. Certainly, some of her
menus made me salivate as I read them, and they include many triumphs. Her
cooking style, and the way she combines ingredients, show a fine
understanding of, and respect for, the raw materials.
She seems fond of many of the ingredients I love: lemons, aubergines,
fennel, spinach, globe artichokes, caramelised onions, pears, pine nuts, red
peppers, basil and rocket. Like many who eschew meat, she displays a
weakness for sweet things, particularly chocolate.
There are some lovely pastry recipes: phyllo tartlets filled with parsley
puree and grilled courgettes; scallops and artichoke bottoms in puff pastry
with a puree of roasted garlic; and a rhubarb tart that throws all
pre-conceived notions of rhubarb tart out the window.
Some of the dishes that attract me most are beautifully simple: wilted
spinach with hazelnut oil and pomegranates; wild rice and fennel salad;
peaches baked on brioche with a sabayon sauce; and the two I quote below.
Her recipe for stuffed peppers is far and away the easiest I know to prepare
 -and it is one of the best stuffed pepper dishes I have eaten.
Here is a vegetarian cook who is not shy of butter, cream or eggs. She does
not once suggest using wholewheat pastry or brown rice. Indeed, her book is
very nearly a pulse-free zone (Le Puy lentils are served with mussels,
tapenade toast and quennelles of tomato mousse) and there is a notable
absence of the quiche-style cliches that pass as vegetarian options in some
circles.
This is happily hedonistic vegetarianism. The title is apt. Annie Bell has
delivered a feast.
PEPPERS ROASTED WITH CHERRY TOMATOES AND HONEY (serves 6)
Luscious and brilliantly simple - I wish I had thought up this recipe
myself. Bell advises that the peppers are best served warm, and suggests
using a mixture of red and yellow vegetables to create a harlequin effect.
Ingredients: 3 red or yellow peppers;  3/4 lb red or yellow cherry tomatoes;
3 teaspoons honey; olive oil; flat-leafed parsley to garnish.
Method: Cut the peppers in half from stem to base, leaving the green stalk
attached. Remove the seeds and pith. Halve the cherry tomatoes and fill the
pepper cavities with them. Dribble over the honey and a little olive oil.
Season with salt and pepper and bake in a very hot oven for 20-30 minutes
until the peppers are wilted and patched with brown. Serve garnished with
chopped parsley.
As the peppers cook, the juice from the tomatoes combines with the juice
from the peppers, merging with the honey and olive oil into a heavenly
liquid which demands that a loaf of good bread is at hand.
CHAR-GRILLED FENNEL WITH FRESH HERBED CHEESE (serves 6)
Ingredients: 3 fennel bulbs; 1 lb ricotta or fresh cream cheese; 2
dessertspoons finely-chopped chervil, chives, parsley, fennel, lovage; good
Italian olive oil; lemon juice; 6 slices coarse-textured white bread,
char-grilled on a stove-top griddle just before serving.
Method: Combine the cheese and herbs in a bowl. Shape the mixture into a
square or cylindrical log about 7in long, cover, and chill until required.
Quarter the fennel bulbs by first cutting them in half vertically, slicing
between the shoots, then cutting each half in half, again vertically. Nick
off any excess root, leaving enough to hold the layers together.
Steam the fennel for 5-7 minutes. Pat it dry and brush with olive oil.
Season and char-grill for 20-30 minutes until it starts to char in patches.
Squeeze lemon juice over the fennel. Serve it with slices of the herbed
cheese, olive oil trickled over and a sprinkling of salt, plus the
char-grilled bread.

RECIPES: CAMPANILE AND PATINA RESTAURANTS HAVE RISEN TO THE WASHINGTON STATE 
APPLE COMMISSION'S CHALLENGE TO CREATE ALL-APPLE MENUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Restaurant chefs are always being asked to put together special "theme" menus. 
Wine dinners are the most common -- the idea is to create dishes that flatter 
some visiting wine-maker's product. When truffles are in season, chefs often 
build a meal around them. (Ken Frank of La Toque went so far as serving truffle 
ice cream -- it sounded weird, tasted swell.) All-garlic menus are frequently 
offered. 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes special meals are put together for promotional purposes. If, say, 
the Potato Board is about to launch a new TV campaign, you'll find some chef 
somewhere tossing potatoes into every course, from delicate hors d'oeuvres to 
dessert (potato brownies aren't bad at all). One of the strangest of these was 
a lunch Michel Richard of Citrus did for the French soda pop, Orangina. Anyone 
for Orangina beurre blanc? 
</P>
<P>
 A relatively more reasonable request was made recently by the Washington State 
Apple Commission. Chefs around the country are being asked to create all-apple 
menus. In Los Angeles, Campanile and Patina accepted the challenge. Here are 
the results.

<LEADPARA>  MENTION Russian food and many Americans envision long lines, empty store
shelves and those hapless meals of thin borscht and stringy stroganoff served
in state-run restaurants and hotels.;   But venture beyond newspaper reports
and Intourist service, and a meal in the Soviet Union can prove a culinary
voyage of discovery around the largest nation on Earth.  </LEADPARA>

BEYOND BORSCHT: SOUTH, CENTRAL AREAS OFFER EXOTIC
FARE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Anya von Bremzen and John C. Welchman are the authors of "Please to The Table"
(Workman Publishing).  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Within the Soviet borders, more than 100 languages are spoken every day,
and the diversity of produce and preparations is astonishing.;   For many, the
revelations of Soviet cuisine come from the exotic, healthful foods of the
Caucasus and Central Asia, whose lush climate and cooking styles are related
to the great traditions of the Mediterranean and Middle East.;   The
picturesque Caucasian republics of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, for
example, share much with the cuisines of neighboring Turkey and Iran -- arrays
of stuffed vegetables, bulgur and rice pilafs, meat grilled on skewers,
eggplant in a thousand disguises, egg and lemon or garlicky yogurt sauces, and
sinful honey and nut-based sweets perfumed with rosewater.;   Yet, as
everywhere in the USSR, their cooks work with flair and distinction. While the
Georgians work wonders with walnuts, the Armenians prefer pine nuts and
almonds. Cilantro is the herb of choice in Georgia, but the Azerbaijanis adore
mint and tarragon, which they wrap in flatbreads along with a slice of feta
cheese for a casual snack. All of the Caucasian republics are devoted to
spices, but the favorites are cumin, allspice, cinnamon and mild chilies in
Armenia; coriander, hot chilies and fenugreek in Georgia; and turmeric and
saffron in Azerbaijan.;   In the tiny western nation of Moldova there is a
delightfully diverse Balkan-style cuisine. Corn is the main staple, and
mamaligha, a cornmeal mush much like Italian polenta, accompanies almost every
meal. If mamaligha doesn't make the daily menu, then a savory, feta-flavored
corn bread is sure to appear. This bread is at its best accompanied by a
beautifully textured vegetable caviar called givech, or by roasted red
peppers. Other regional temptations include bountiful moussakas, feta-stuffed
peppers and a profusion of sweet and savory strudels.;   This is a land of
plenty. On a recent trip to the Uzbek and Kazakh republics in Soviet Central
Asia, even in the winter, there was no sign of the lines and distribution
problems that afflict the colder northern areas of the USSR.;   The modern
Olai bazaar in the Uzbek capital, Tashkent, was ablaze with piles of bright
orange and yellow carrots, carefully julienned and mounded into spectacular
heaps on the white-slabbed counters. Nearby were baseball-size green radishes,
purple-tinted garlics and piles of ripe pomegranates sliced through to expose
their sparkling crimson seeds. The region's yellow carrots lend the Uzbek's
favorite lamb pilaf a delicious mild sweetness punctuated by a skillful blend
of spices -- cumin, hot and sweet ground chilies and barbaris (a tart purple
berry).;   Here and there were fast-food joints selling perfect lamb-filled
steamed dumplings (borrowed from neighboring China; steaming is one of the
preferred cooking methods in Central Asia), and savory, filled pastries called
samsa -- not dissimilar to the Indian samosas from which they take their name.
Among other culinary debts to India were the stacks of warm "non" flatbreads
baked in outdoor clay ovens, and the many mung bean dishes so popular in both
regions.;   Soviet cuisine is probably the most diverse in the world, and as
the USSR emerges from its momentous social and economic changes, food lovers
everywhere will be fascinated to encounter its wide world of cuisine.;   This
version of a Georgian recipe makes a great buffet dish and is a real treat for
those who love crispy baby vegetables. The sauce also works well as a dip with
raw vegetables.; COLD STEAMED VEGETABLES WITH WALNUT SAUCE; (POSTNEULI
NIGVZIS; SOTSIBELIT);  Walnut Sauce:; 3/4 cup walnut pieces; 2 large cloves
garlic; 1/2 small dried chili pepper, seeded; 6 small sprigs cilantro; 1/8
teaspoon coarse (kosher) salt; 1 1/4 cups chicken stock;  Small pinch saffron
threads, crushed in a mortar and diluted in 1 tablespoon warm water; 1/4
teaspoon sweet Hungarian paprika; 1/4 teaspoon ground coriander; 1/8 teaspoon
ground fenugreek; 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar;  Vegetables:; 1 1/2 pounds
mixed vegetables (such as small new potatoes, baby carrots, asparagus, green
beans, cauliflower florets, wax beans);  Salt, freshly ground pepper;  To make
sauce, process walnuts, garlic, chili pepper, cilantro and salt in food
processor until pulverized. Transfer to medium saucepan and add chicken stock.
Slowly bring to simmer, stirring. Add saffron, paprika, coriander, fenugreek
and more salt if needed. Cook, stirring, without allowing mixture to boil, 3
to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vinegar. Cool, cover and
refrigerate until ready to use.;   Fill large pan with 2 inches salted water
and fit with steamer basket. Bring water to boil and steam each vegetable
separately to desired doneness. Refresh under cold running water. Drain well
and pat dry with paper towels. Refrigerate, covered, until ready to use, but
no more than 1 day.;   To serve, place bowl with walnut sauce in center of
serving platter. Arrange vegetables attractively around bowl. Makes 8
servings.; (hbox); This is a potato soup to top all potato soups. Thick and
creamy, it has the woodsy aroma of wild mushrooms enlivened by bacon
cracklings and paprika.; LATVIAN POTATO; AND WILD MUSHROOM SOUP; (KARTOFELNY
SUP S GRIBAMI); 1 ounce imported, well-rinsed dried wild mushrooms (such as
Polish, porcini or cepes); 5 1/2 cups water;  Salt; 6 medium russet potatoes,
peeled and cubed; 4 slices bacon, finely diced; 1 small onion, finely chopped;
2/3 cup whipping cream;  Sweet Hungarian paprika;  Freshly ground pepper; 
Chopped fresh dill for garnish;  Soak mushrooms in 1 cup of the water 2 hours.
Drain and strain liquid through coffee filter. Bring mushrooms, their soaking
liquid and remaining 4 1/2 cups water to boil in large soup pot over high
heat. Add salt. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, 30 minutes.;   Add
potatoes. Increase heat to medium-low and cook 15 to 20 minutes, or until
potatoes are tender. Remove from heat. Remove mushrooms with slotted spoon.
When cool enough to handle, chop them very fine.;   Using slotted spoon,
transfer potatoes to food processor. Add 1 cup cooking liquid and process
until pureed. Whisk potatoes back into cooking liquid in pan. Stir thoroughly
with fork or wire whisk until there are no lumps. Set aside.;   Saute bacon in
small skillet until it renders its fat. Drain off all but 1 tablespoon fat,
then add onions and mushrooms. Saute, stirring occasionally, over medium-high
heat until mixture is well browned, about 15 minutes.;   Return soup to low
heat. Add cream and simmer gently 2 minutes, until soup is about to boil. Stir
in sauteed onion-mushroom-and-bacon mixture. Season to taste with few dashes
paprika, salt and pepper. Simmer an additional 3 to 4 minutes. Serve garnished
with fresh dill. Makes 6 servings.; (hbox); This bread is excellent with stews
and soups, or with just a slice of feta cheese or smoked ham, as it is often
enjoyed in Moldavia. It is a very savory corn bread, indeed.;   MOLDAVIAN CORN
AND FETA CHEESE BREAD; (KUKURUZNIY KHLEB S BRINZOY); 3 cups crumbled feta
cheese; 1/2 cup sour cream; 2 large eggs, lightly beaten; 2 cups milk; 6
tablespoons unsalted butter, melted; 2 cups yellow cornmeal, preferably stone
ground; 3/4 cup unbleached flour; 1/2 teaspoon sugar; 2 teaspoons baking
powder; 1/2 teaspoon baking soda;  Stir together feta cheese, sour cream,
eggs, milk and melted butter in large bowl.;   Sift together cornmeal, flour,
sugar, baking powder and baking soda and stir into feta mixture. Blend
thoroughly. Cover and let stand 15 minutes.;   Transfer batter to buttered
13-by-9-inch baking dish. Bake on middle rack at 375 degrees until light
golden brown and firm to the touch, 35 to 40 minutes. Serve warm. Makes 6 to 8
servings.;   (hbox); Serve this dish with a tomato, onion and pepper salad.;
CENTRAL ASIAN LAMB PILAF WITH GARBANZO BEANS; AND RAISINS; 1/2 cup light oil;

RECIPES REINFORCE L. A.'S CROSS-CULTURAL APPROACH TO CUISINE

Think America is the melting pot of the world? Then Los Angeles must be its 
salad bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos, Asians and Europeans, Easterners, Southerners and other Americans from 
every direction are tossed together into a show of colors that is reflected in 
the way we have learned to cook and eat. 
</P>
<P>
And as comfortable as we have become with crossing cultures in the kitchen, we 
as easily amalgamate our seasons. Between our climate and the availability of 
produce from all over the world, we are as able to eat red-ripe strawberries, 
golden peaches, peppers and potatoes of unimaginable colors and crisp green 
salads in January as we are in June. 
</P>
<P>
A few cross-cultural, multiseasonal salads in point are illustrated here. One 
mixes Japanese with French, in another Thai mingles with Mexican. A New York 
steak sandwich is turned into a salad with an Italian influence and Waldorf 
salad becomes well-traveled with the addition of smoked turkey, 
California-grown Asian pears and Roquefort cheese. Any of them would make a 
fine main dish for a simple holiday meal that will celebrate our complexion, 
climate and crossroads. 
</P>
<P>

<HEAD>Exotic Vegetables Catching On In American Supermarkets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bok choy and escarole aren't crops for every
farmer, but an Agriculture Department economist says such exotic
food items are catching the eye of supermarket shoppers.
   Increasingly, produce counters are also including fruits that are
a bit off the trodden path of consumers: pomegranates, guava,
kumquats, and melons named Santa Clause, Casaba and Crenshaw.
   ``Specialty fruit and vegetable displays form a fundamental part
of the new up-scale image of many produce sections,'' said Catherine
Greene of the department's Economic Research Service.
   Rising demand for specialty produce is in line with a general
increase in fruit and vegetable consumption, she said. The average
American consumed 427 pounds of fruits and vegetables last year, up
12 percent since 1972. That is a farm weight equivalent before
trimming, processing and after-harvest losses, she said Wednesday.
   Greene said the per capita trend is expected to continue upward,
although there could be some year-to-year variations. For example,
she said, this year's drought probably will cause some decline from
the 1987 average.
   In any case, specialty fruits and vegetables are the rage among
many consumers, and there is no sign the demand will taper off soon.
Greene, writing in the agency's National Food Review, said there are
a number of reasons.
   ``Americans have become more health conscious, eating lots of
fruits and vegetables as part of a well-balanced diet,'' she said.
``Consequently, we want a huge selection of produce.''
   Further, Americans travel more frequently than they used to, and
many want ``foreign'' foods when they return home.
   ``Unusual fruits and vegetables are appearing on restaurant
menus,'' Greene said. ``Also influencing our diets are recent
immigrants from the Caribbean, Central America and Southeast Asia
who have brought their native foods with them.''
   A recent survey by the industry's Food Marketing Institute showed
that the number of items sold in supermarket produce departments
more than doubled to 150 between the mid-1970s and the early 1980s.
Today, more than 250 items is the norm, including new packs and
sizes of traditional fruits and vegetables, along with exotic and
specialty produce.
   Another survey conducted for a trade journal, The Packer, showed
the most frequently tried specialty fresh vegetables were alfalfa
and bean sprouts, followed by snow peas, pearl onions, parsnips,
leeks, baby vegetables, Chinese cabbage and shallots.
   Moreover, about a third of those surveyed also had seen or heard
of less widely known specialty vegetables such as Belgian endive,
bok choy, celeriac, daikon, kohlrabi, parsley root and Jerusalem
artichoke.
   The most frequently tried specialty fresh fruits, in order, were
pomegranates, persimmons, kumquats, quince and guavas.
   Additionally, at least a third of those surveyed had seen or
heard of breadfuit, passion fruit, plantains, prickly pear and red
bananas. But some fruits were nearly unkown: Asian pears,
carambolas, cherimoyas, sapotes, radiccho and rappini.
   Greene said the survey showed that consumers in the western
United States are more likely to try specialty produce and fresh
herbs, another group of growth items. One factor is the West's large
Asian and Hispanic populations, with their interests in exotic
produce.
   Also, it was shown that consumers in the upper income brackets
eat more of the speciality fruits and vegetables.
   ``They may be better informed about the variety of produce
available and better able to afford the premium prices that
specialities sometimes command,'' Greene said.

   The Agriculture Department says the value of
U.S. agricultural exports jumped 26 percent to a four-year high of
$35.2 billion in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30.
   Actual quantities of grain and other commodities totaled 147.5
million metric tons, up 14 percent from 129.2 million tons shipped
in 1986-87 when the value was $27.9 billion.
   The new figures released Wednesday were up from the previous
forecast issued on Aug. 25, when the value was projected at $34
billion and the volume at 146 million tons.
   Despite the sharp gains, the year's totals were still far below
the record levels of $43.8 billion and 162.3 million tons in 1980-81
before world economic conditions, high interest rates, foreign
competition and other economic factors triggered annual declines.
   Deputy Secretary Peter C. Myers credited the 1985 farm law's
lower price support mechanisms with making U.S. commodities more
competitive in world trade.
   Myers said a decline in food prices last month ``proves that
export increases did not occur at the expense of U.S. consumers,
despite this summer's damaging drought.''
   The USDA says higher commodity prices point to another increase
in the value of exports in the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1. But
it says the actual volume may decline.
   A forecast of 1989 farm exports is scheduled for release on Nov.
29.
   Wheat accounted for two-thirds of the volume increase last fiscal
year, and ``significant increases'' were reported for corn,
livestock feed and fodder, and vegetable oils.
   Overall, exports of grains and feeds accounted for more than
$12.7 billion of the total, up 37 percent.
   Other categories included: oilseeds and products, $7.7 billion,
up 19 percent; livestock products, $4.9 billion, up 24 percent;
horticultural products, $3.8 billion, up 21 percent; cotton, $2.15
billion, up 50 percent; and tobacco, $1.3 billion, up 8 percent.

   This year's drought-reduced grain and soybean
harvests will mean sharply higher feed costs for livestock producers
in the coming year, with some items costing almost half again as
much, says the Agriculture Department.
   Drought and hot weather reduced total feed grain production by 34
percent this year to the smallest total since 1983.
   Prices of feed grains, mostly corn, are expected to average 25
percent to 45 percent above last year's weighted average of $76.70
per ton, the department's Economic Research Service said Wednesday.
Soybean meal prices may average $235 to $275 per ton, compared with
$222 in 1987-88.

<HEAD>Solomon's Temple Treasure Returned To Israel</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</NOTE>

   An ivory pomegranate, believed to be the only
existing relic of Solomon's Temple, has gone on display at the
Israel Museum after officials paid $550,000 into a secret Swiss
bank account.
   The thumb-sized object, which measures 1.68 inches by .83
inches, has a hole in the bottom and may have been used as the top
of a scepter carried by a temple priest.
   ``We have never had anything that was in Solomon's Temple.
Minuscule as it is, this is an exquisite treasure,'' said Meir
Meyer, vice chairman of the museum.
   A museum official who demanded anonymity said the money was paid
to the secret account of an anonymous owner in Zurich, Switzerland,
after the museum raised the money from an anonymous donor in Basel.
   The cream-colored relic, which dates to the 8th century B.C. and
is badly chipped on one side, was returned to Israel last week
after it was apparently smuggled out of the country after 1979.
   It is the only exhibit in a long narrow room, displayed in a
case with a dim light to prevent damage to the ivory.
   An armed guard stood nearby as workers rushed to finalize
details of the exhibit before the object was placed on display
Monday.
   Officials said they were reluctant to spend so much money to
return the pomegranate but agreed to do so after two months of
negotiations because it was a national treasure.
   ``The question is whether to bring it back or leave it. Of
course, any object that has such high historical and cultural value
should be brought back,'' said Nahman Avigad, a Hebrew University
archaeologist who authenticated the pomegranate.
   Avigad said ``in all probability'' it was used in the ancient
temple, which was looted and destroyed by the Bablylonians in 589
B.C.
   Thus the pomegranate is likely part of the great treasure of
gold, ivory and precious objects that King Solomon invested in the
temple, which was built about 960 B.C. and housed the Ark of the
Covenant, two stone tablets containing the law of Moses.
   The temple was rebuilt in the 6th century B.C. and expanded by
Herod before being destroyed in A.D. 70. Today, the Dome of the
Rock _ a Moslem shrine that is part of the Al Aqsa complex _ is
located near the site of ancient temple, according to Israeli
scholars.
   Written on the pomegranate in ancient Hebrew is an inscription
that says ``Belonging to the Temple of the Lord (Yahweh), holy to
the priests.''
   Meyer said it was the oldest Hebrew inscription using the name
of God, predating by at least 100 years two silver scrolls with
biblical inscriptions found in Jerusalem a decade ago.
   Meyer said he had been tracking the pomegranate since hearing
about it in 1985. He said a tour guide walked into his office in
1987 and put him in touch with a lawyer for the anonymous owner.
   The pomegranate first came to light in 1979 when Andre Lemaire,
a French expert on ancient inscriptions, stumbled on the relic in
the shop of a Jerusalem antiquities dealer.
   Lemaire of Paris wrote in a 1984 article for the Biblical
Archaeology Review that the dealer only showed him the pomegranate
so he could photograph it.
   Lemaire said the dealer did not know where the pomegranate was
found. But Lemaire speculated it may have been unearthed in the
limestone caves surrounding Jerusalem, which were often used for
tombs.
   The pomegranate next turned up in an exhibition in Paris in 1985
and then disappeared again.
   Israeli laws ban excavation or the export of antiquities without
a permit from the education ministry's Department of Antiquities.
Officials are currently drafting proposed legislation to tighten
controls and virtually outlaw antiquities trading.

MEXICAN EXOTICA FEATURED AT THE EL PASO CANTINA GRILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CHARLES PERRY

<TEXT>
<P>
Deja mange . . . it starts out like a case of deja mange. A tart tomatillo 
sauce, a mild red chile sauce with a roasted flavor, fresh flour tortillas made 
by a slightly scary-looking tortilla-stamping machine at the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant, which utilizes the word grill in its name, is the showcase of a 
chain with Orange County roots. 
</P>
<P>
However, this is not the El Torito Grill but the El Paso Cantina Mexican Grill. 
It's not somewhere in Beverly Hills, but at the old 385 North location on La 
Cienega, brightly lit but with a dim (and underutilized) bar. 
</P>
<P>
And it doesn't claim to be Southwestern but attempts Authentic Mexican, to cite 
the title of a book by one of the authors of the menu. So the decor is 
grotesque Day of the Dead mask, not Navajo rug motif, and the food is not so 
much inventive as authentic exotic: say, jicama salad topped with pomegranate 
seeds. 
</P>
<P>
The appetizers might be the best part of the meal. Tortilla soup, filled with 
tortilla strips that virtually turn into fettuccine, is stunningly flavorful, 
the broth dark mahogany brown from ground dried chiles. One of the quesadillas 
is made with a smooth and mild goat cheese, sweetened with grilled red onions. 
Even things that are often boring are likely to be worth trying; the taquitos 
are for once genuinely crisp, and about as good as taquitos will ever get. 
</P>
<P>
Special appetizers might include gorditas, little corn masa cakes the size of a 
Ritz cracker split open and filled with guacamole and various meats. When 
tamales are offered, the rich, light masa might be stuffed with duck. Great 
fun. On the other hand, the Mexico City quesadillas are a little less 
interesting than they sound, being more like deep-fried turnovers. Call them 
smallish corn meal samosas filled with cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Entrees on the regular menu are limited to only tacos, enchiladas and burritos. 
To be sure, among the tacos you can order duck or catfish, and once in a while, 
on special, there's a rather beef-like venison marinated in hot pepper and 
cumin. The enchiladas, for their part, have meaty stuffings and a mouth-filling 
dark red chile sauce with a smoky, bittersweet flavor. 
</P>
<P>
The small regular menu might lead you to presume that the drama will be on the 
large list of entree specials. Well, yes, there is drama in several senses. A 
grilled game hen, marinated in garlic and sweet spices, is a big surprise: the 
meatiest and most flavorful game hen I've ever had. 
</P>
<P>
But the other specials are a very mixed bag. Scallops in spicy pipian verde 
sauce sounds interesting, but the sauce -- elegant though it was with its hint 
of anise -- had a thin, chilly quality. Duck breast in another version of 
pipian sauce, this one with chipotle peppers and ground pumpkin seeds, is more 
enjoyable. The question is exactly what this sauce has to do with duck. The 
rack of lamb in a pleasant, somewhat neutral cascabel pepper sauce has a 
faintly disagreeable smell, possibly some diabolical compound of the scorched 
exterior of the meat and the aromas of squash and beans. 
</P>
<P>
Tread a little carefully among the specials, say I. But the desserts, like the 
appetizers, are very good. Espresso ice cream deserves special notice for the 
strongest, truest coffee flavor you're ever likely to taste below room 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
But it should be noted that these desserts are not always autentico Mexican. 
True, you can get flan or fried plantains -- which are excellent, not mushy 
like the usual fried banana -- served with banana walnut ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the desserts, though, are things like chocolate pecan pie or 
apple-quince crisp topped with cinnamon ice cream. (Actually, the pie is 
nothing like an American pecan pie: it's just filled with chocolate and lots of 
pecans.) 
</P>
<P>
Deja mange, it ends like a case of deja mange. 
</P>
<P>
El Paso Cantina Mexican Grill, 385 N. La Cienega Blvd.; (213) 659-1533. Open 
for lunch Monday-Friday, for dinner nightly. Full bar. Valet parking. American 
Express, MasterCard and Visa accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $30 to $60.

CALIFORNIA ONCE HAD DUENDE -- THE MYSTERIOUS ESSENCE THAT MAKES SOMETHING 
SPANISH. IT CAME TO CALIFORNIA WITH THE EARLY SETTLERS. MY 
GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER WAS AMONG THEM. 
</P>
<P>
He was granted a rancho by King Ferdinand VII of Spain in 1821, but during my 
childhood it was spoken of as if it had happened only yesterday. Like that of 
the other soldados who came through Mexico to conquer California, his rancho 
was a vast holding with boundaries defined only by oak trees, stream beds and 
distinctive rocks. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, there were only the ranchos and the missions. Occasionally a 
foreigner filtered in through the mountains or a passing ship stopped, but they 
were rare. Within this glorious isolation, the old Californios tried to 
recreate Spain from what they chose to remember. 
</P>
<P>
Their food customs were flagrantly borrowed from the Indians and from the 
people they had known during their time in Mexico. They made it all theirs and 
called it Spanish. Grandma always insisted that the huge flour tortillas she 
stretched with her fingers were Spanish. Years later, when I grew up and 
traveled to Mexico, I was shocked to find the same tortillas in Sonora. 
Grandmama had made a very convincing case that they were from Spain. 
</P>
<P>
With their roots foremost in their minds, my ancestors subscribed to an acute 
sense of honor and prided themselves on their graces. The courtesies of life 
were so intertwined with the ceremonies of food as to be inseparable. There was 
an old saying, "It is better to arrive on time than to be invited." Nobody was 
ever turned away. In Walter Colton's 1850 diary of life in Monterey, he notes 
that "were the Devil himself to call for a night's lodging, the Californian 
would hardly find it in his heart to bolt the door but would think he could 
manage in some way." 
</P>
<P>
I can remember my grandmother being surprised by guests when her larder was 
empty. A white cloth suddenly appeared on the table, and then teacups with hot 
chocolate. A bowl of jelly was found in some forgotten jar. Stale soda crackers 
were crisped in the oven. Slices of cheese were displayed in the English cheese 
dish that was a family heirloom. A small bunch of red grapes was put out with 
the grape scissors, and some candy. The guests were astonished at the silent 
appearance of the little dishes. No apologies were made for the simple fare. 
</P>
<P>
The courtesies lingered. There was a short period of about 25 years during the 
last century that encapsulated all the romance associated with Old California. 
The Californio had a complete disregard for money and the need to work for it. 
It was not unusual for a ranchero to stage a barbecue rather than drive his 
cattle to market so that he could make payment on a loan. This was frowned upon 
by most Anglo-Saxons, who were shocked by such laziness; most written accounts 
by Anglos fume over the fact that people with such natural wealth could be so 
profligate as to prefer dining alfresco when they could be doing something more 
useful. 
</P>
<P>
So while land robbers and loan sharks and Yankee businessmen pressed in upon 
them, the Californios dined. And lost almost everything. My family ended up 
with about 20 acres of the thousands of the original land grant. All they had 
left was their food, their dining -- and their style. 
</P>
<P>
Cuisine is too grand a word to describe the food served on the ranchos. When I 
first moved far away from home, dazzled by French cooking and Julia Child, I 
was struck by how simple our food was. But there was a perfection in that 
simplicity; I couldn't even make a pot of beans the way my grandmother and 
mother did. 
</P>
<P>
The most important word in the cook's vocabulary, and one for which there is no 
translation, is guisar : It will never taste flat. I still fear the thought of 
cooking a meal for my Spanish uncle; for him and also for my grandfather, a 
dish is never guisado. It always needed a pinch more of basil, or pepper, or 
salt. Or less salt. 
</P>
<P>
My father, who was raised on a Wisconsin dairy farm, never recovered from the 
shock of my mother's family. Brought up to believe that food was meant to be 
eaten quickly, he hated the long after-dinner discussions about whether the 
lamb marinade had contained enough rosemary. When I was 5, one of my uncles 
asked what I thought of a fresh batch of olives. Knowing a reply was important, 
I told him they weren't salty enough. My father looked at me like I was headed 
for hell. 
</P>
<P>
Exquisite attention was paid to the smallest details of daily life. Although 
their repertoire was not extensive, the women were all good cooks and loved 
tending the herbs so important to the rancho dishes. Gardens were stocked with 
yerba buena (mint), cilantro, Italian parsley, chamomile, sweet basil and 
anise, and we grew an ancient stock of wild marjoram (oregano) that was 
marvelously sweet and pungent but not bitter. The cooks used herbs in vegetable 
stews, marinades, salads and in curative brews such as chamomile tea. Grandma 
always added slivers of sweet basil to her famous corn pie. 
</P>
<P>
Besides herbs, one of the most distinctive features of rancho cooking was the 
use of olive oil. Since most of the ranchos pressed their own olives into oil, 
they used it for frying instead of lard. Salads were always simply iceberg 
lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers anointed with droplets of olive oil, red wine 
vinegar, salt, and finely ground pepper out of a can. My grandmother even 
blended olive oil and sea salt and gave it to me as the most ungodly cough 
syrup known to man. 
</P>
<P>
Cooking was not considered women's work. The men loved knowing about every 
detail; when it came to barbecue, they took over completely. The asador was 
even more important: Any man could oversee the parillas (grills), but only a 
man of experience could hold sway over the stone-lined pits where large chunks 
of beef shoulder or a whole bull's head were roasted. My grandfather relished 
this role. 
</P>
<P>
First, the asador chose the meat. Then he and his compadres watched over the 
fires that were built at least 12 hours in advance so there was a deep bed of 
glowing coals. Then he dictated the gathering of the shovels, wheelbarrows, 
sheet iron, soaked gunny sacks and the necessary libations for his cronies. 
Lastly, he went somewhere to mix up his secret blend of herbs and spices and 
his own basting sauce. He never revealed his recipe (even if it was just salt, 
pepper and wine), not even to his wife. During his moments at the barbecue, the 
asador reigned supreme. He was the most opinionated man you ever met. 
</P>
<P>
The morning of a barbecue, the dirt pathways that meandered through fig trees, 
olive trees, oaks, and flower pots of geraniums were swept and tidied with 
palm-frond brooms. The long tables near the grape arbor were covered with white 
cloths and anchored with more pots of flowers. The fires were built using 
fruitwood and vine cuttings. 
</P>
<P>
The menu hardly varied. The meat was beef or lamb. Chicken was reserved for 
invalids. Huge pots of thick pink beans were cooked in the same way that they 
had been for a hundred years. Beans were always rolled into a triangle of 
tortilla and they had to be thick enough so the juices did not run down your 
sleeve. (The only other place I have found these thick beans is in the little 
restaurant on Olvera Street across from the bandstand.) 
</P>
<P>
The necessary accompaniment to barbecued meats was sarsa, a rancho version of 
salsa, a mixture of tomatoes, green chilies, onions, garlic and cilantro. The 
cook might add a dash of olive oil, wine vinegar, salt and finely ground 
pepper. Sarsa is not incendiary but a relish that can be put on everything -- 
barbecued meat, beans and numerous warm flour tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
It was absolutely essential that there be many long pans of red enchiladas to 
accompany the meat as well. First, the thin, hand-stretched flour tortillas had 
to be made while the red chili sauce simmered. Several pounds of onions had to 
be chopped and slowly simmered. The combination of the hot red chili with the 
sweet onion filling is one of the best. 
</P>
<P>
Pilillis are another of the Californios' culinary inventions. The word, like 
sarsa, is untraceable, but pilillis are remarkably similar to sopaipillas, the 
puffy fried bread of the Southwest. Anyone who came for one of the great Sunday 
barbecues and snuggled into one of the ghostly rooms of the old ranch house for 
the night would wake up the next morning to the smell of pilillis and 
dark-roasted coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Lastly, when the embers of the great barbecue were dying, they carried out huge 
platters holding wedges of watermelon; if peaches or apricots were in season, 
Aunt Nicolassa and Mama baked at least a dozen pies. 
</P>
<P>
After a barbecue, nobody wanted to go home. They sat at the long tables 
chatting until Grandmama carried out the kerosene lamps. They did not want to 
let go of the day. They sat in the dark, their image of the rancho intact, as 
if they were still surrounded by thousands of acres. There in the ambiente of 
the grape arbor, they had dined like royalty on tortillas, beans, and 
enchiladas. 
</P>
<P>
Herbs, garlic, finely ground pepper and red wine were used as marinades for 
barbecued meats. Fresh rosemary was a favorite with lamb and I have substituted 
pomegranate juice for the red wine for a less harsh but fruitier flavor. 
</P>
<P>
BUTTERFLIED LAMB IN ROSEMARY AND POMEGRANATE JUICE 
</P>
<P>
1 (5-to-6-pound) leg of lamb, boned and butterflied 
</P>
<P>
6 cloves garlic, cut into slivers 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup fresh rosemary leaves, bruised to release 
</P>
<P>
herb oils 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Pepper 
</P>
<P>
3 cups pomegranate juice 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
Sprigs fresh rosemary 
</P>
<P>
Barbecued Peppers 
</P>
<P>
Cut slits on both sides of meat and fill with garlic slivers. Trim off all fat 
from meat, but thin film of fell may be left intact. 
</P>
<P>
Place meat in shallow dish and rub with 1/4 cup rosemary, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 
teaspoon pepper. Add pomegranate juice. Marinate 6 hours in refrigerator, 
turning meat occasionally so marinade penetrates evenly. 
</P>
<P>
Remove meat from refrigerator 1 hour before grilling. Build fire of hardwood 
briquettes, almond wood or fruitwood. When coals are covered with white ash, 
rub lamb with olive oil and grill 5 to 6 inches above coals about 20 minutes 
per side for rare and 30 minutes per side for medium rare, or to 135 degrees on 
meat thermometer. 
</P>
<P>
During last 10 minutes of grilling, toss a couple sprigs of rosemary on coals. 
Herbal oils released into smoke will flavor lamb. Sprinkle with more salt and 
pepper just before removing meat from grill. 
</P>
<P>
Allow meat to rest at least 10 minutes before slicing crosswise. Place slices 
on platter garnished with more rosemary sprigs and Barbecued Peppers. Makes 8 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Have butcher bone and butterfly lamb. Pomegranate juice may be purchased 
at health-food stores. A can of water and a short stick with cloth tied at one 
end can be used to drizzle water over any flare-ups that could blacken meat 
during grilling. 
</P>
<P>
 The vegetables to accompany the lamb should be sweet and simple. 
</P>
<P>
Barbecued Peppers 
</P>
<P>
2 sweet red peppers 
</P>
<P>
2 green peppers 
</P>
<P>
4 Anaheim chiles 
</P>
<P>
2 poblano chiles 
</P>
<P>
2 cloves garlic 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
2-3 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
During last 20 minutes of grilling lamb, place red and green peppers and 
Anaheim and poblano chiles alongside meat on grill. Turn peppers and chiles 
every 2-3 minutes until evenly charred. 
</P>
<P>
Mash garlic with salt and whisk in olive oil. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Remove peppers and chiles, place in large brown shopping bag and fold over top. 
Let steam 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Remove peppers and chiles and use small, sharp knife to peel off most of 
blackened skins, leaving some black flecks for character. Cut peppers and 
chiles into halves, remove cores and seeds and drizzle with garlic olive oil. 
</P>
<P>
These are the ones Grandmama called Spanish. They are rolled and then 
hand-stretched. They call for much less fat than many of the thick flour 
tortillas requiring lard. You will only enjoy these at the table of a rancho 
family or your own. In the old days, there could not be a barbecue without 
flour tortillas in which to roll up meat, salsa and thick beans. 
</P>
<P>
RANCHO FLOUR TORTILLAS 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 teaspoons salt 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups warm water 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup shortening, about 
</P>
<P>
4 cups unbleached flour 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
Dissolve salt in warm water and set aside. Cut shortening into flour and baking 
powder with pastry blender until mealy. Finish by using fingertips. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly add just enough warm salted water to make dough form soft ball. Knead 1 
minute in bowl. Cover ball of dough with plastic wrap and let rest 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Divide dough into 12 pieces and form into balls. Place on greased pan. Flatten 
each ball with heel of hand. Let balls rest, covered with plastic wrap, 30-45 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Heat griddle or comal over medium flame. Roll out first tortilla on lightly 
floured surface with 7-inch sawed-off broom handle or dowel. Roll in quick, 
short strokes, and keep lifting and turning tortilla to retain even circle. 
When tortilla is about 8 inches wide, hang from 1 hand and draw fingers of 
other hand across bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Cook on grill about 1 minute, turning tortilla every 10 seconds. To turn, push 
thumb into edge of tortilla and turn over. Tortilla will develop golden spots 
and puff. Tortilla is cooked when puffing ceases. Wrap in towel, then foil. 
Makes 12 tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a salsa that must be hand-chopped. 
</P>
<P>
SARSA 
</P>
<P>
5 tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
4 Anaheim chiles 
</P>
<P>
1 sweet onion (Bermuda or Vidalia) 
</P>
<P>
2 jalapeno chiles, seeded 
</P>
<P>
2 cloves garlic 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon wine vinegar 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon olive oil 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup snipped cilantro 
</P>
<P>
Cut tomatoes in halves and squeeze out seeds. Char Anaheim chiles over flame. 
Cool, then remove skins, seeds and stems. 
</P>
<P>
Dice tomatoes, Anaheim chiles and onion. Mince jalapeno chiles and garlic. Stir 
together tomatoes, Anaheim and jalapeno chiles, onion, garlic, vinegar, olive 
oil, salt to taste, marjoram and cilantro. Marinate at least 1 hour before 
serving. Makes about 5 cups. 
</P>
<P>
 When I tried to cook these beans from memory, complicating them with gourmet 
tricks, I failed miserably. How could something so utterly basic as beans, 
water and salt be so difficult? It is all in the patience needed for the second 
simmering -- and the mashing. Use a big spoon, not a blender as is sometimes 
recommended. It is just as necessary to cook the beans in a humble, cheap pot 
instead of one that cost you $75. These beans were eaten twice a day on the 
ranchos; they were always pink. 
</P>
<P>
THICK RANCHO BEANS 
</P>
<P>
1 pound pink beans 
</P>
<P>
1 onion, chopped 
</P>
<P>
2 cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons ground New Mexican chile powder 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons canola oil or bacon fat 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Pepper 
</P>
<P>
Wash beans in sieve and pick over for stones. Cover beans with water, bring to 
boil and simmer 3 minutes. Let beans soak at least 2 hours. Drain off soaking 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Cover beans with 6 cups fresh water, onion, garlic and chile powder. Bring to 
boil, then reduce heat and simmer 2 hours or until tender but not mushy. (Beans 
may also be cooked in pressure cooker 50 minutes.) 
</P>
<P>
Heat oil in large cast-iron pan. Add 1/2 cup beans and small amount of bean 
liquid. When mixture starts to bubble, mash beans with back of large spoon. 
</P>
<P>
When mixture thickens add another 1/2 cup beans and bean liquid. Simmer, then 
again begin mashing beans. Do not add too much bean liquid at any one time. 
</P>
<P>
Keep adding beans slowly, and gradually add liquid. Simmer 10 to 20 minutes or 
until beans are desired degree of thickness. Do not mash all beans, but just 
enough to make mixture thick. 
</P>
<P>
Add salt and pepper to taste. Beans thicken upon standing, so reserve some of 
bean liquor to add later. Makes 6 cups. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Any leftover beans may be refried. Heat cast-iron pan with 2-3 
tablespoons oil or bacon fat, and fry beans until crisp around edges. Sprinkle 
with grated Parmesan cheese, or stir in cubes of Jack cheese. Serve with huevos 
rancheros. 
</P>
<P>
 These are two typical and popular rancho barbecue dishes. 
</P>
<P>
RED ENCHILADAS 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
5 medium onions, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Pepper 
</P>
<P>
3 cups Red Chile Sauce 
</P>
<P>
10 flour tortillas, preferably homemade 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 pounds sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded 
</P>
<P>
1 (6-ounce) can pitted black olives, halved 
</P>
<P>
Heat olive oil in large skillet and saute onions slowly 20-30 minutes, stirring 
frequently to prevent sticking. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
Warm Red Chile Sauce and place 1/2 cup sauce on wide dinner plate. Dip both 
sides of tortilla into sauce. Place scant 1/2 cup cheese, 4 olive halves and 
scant 1/2 cup sauteed onion down center. Fold each side of tortilla over 
filling. 
</P>
<P>
Place each enchilada, folded edges down, in oiled 4-quart rectangular baking 
dish. Pour remaining chile sauce over top. Sprinkle with remaining olives and 
shredded cheese. Bake enchiladas at 350 degrees 20 minutes or until heated 
through. Makes 10 enchiladas. 
</P>
<P>
Red Chile Sauce 
</P>
<P>
10 dried red California or New Mexican chiles 
</P>
<P>
6 pasilla chiles 
</P>
<P>
1 clove garlic, mashed 
</P>
<P>
1/2 onion, chopped 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons oil 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons flour 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon dried oregano 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon vinegar 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Rinse California and pasilla chiles. Break off stems and shake out seeds. Place 
chiles in 5-quart sauce pot with garlic and onion. Cover with 12 cups water and 
simmer 30 minutes. Drain, reserving liquid. 
</P>
<P>
Puree chiles, garlic and onion in blender in 3 batches using about 1/2 cup 
cooking water for each batch. Add more water if puree is too thick. Press puree 
through sieve to remove chile skins. 
</P>
<P>
Heat oil in skillet; stir in flour. Add oregano. Heat until golden brown, then 
stir in chile puree and vinegar. Simmer sauce 20 minutes. If sauce seems thick, 
add additional cooking liquid. Season to taste with salt. Makes about 4 1/2 
cups. 
</P>
<P>
 These pastry clouds are dusted with powdered sugar just like the beignets of 
New Orleans. They are best eaten for breakfast when you are wearing a white 
bathrobe! 
</P>
<P>
PILLILIS 
</P>
<P>
3 cups unbleached flour 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup vegetable shortening 
</P>
<P>
1 (13-ounce) can evaporated milk 
</P>
<P>
2 cups canola oil 
</P>
<P>
Powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
Sift together flour, baking powder and salt. Using pastry blender or fingers, 
work shortening into mixture until texture resembles coarse meal. Warm 
evaporated milk to 95 degrees, and slowly add to mixture to produce dough of 
soft consistency. Knead dough until smooth, about 3 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Cover and allow dough to rest 30 minutes. Divide dough into quarters. Roll out 
1 quarter at a time, keeping remaining well covered. Roll dough into 8-inch 
circle, 1/16-inch thick. Cut into four triangles. 
</P>
<P>
Heat oil in large saucepan or deep-fryer kettle. When oil is hot, almost 
smoking, fry one triangle at a time until golden, continuously spooning hot oil 
over dough. Turn and brown other side. 
</P>
<P>
Remove triangles with slotted spoon to paper towels. Sprinkle with powdered 
sugar. 
</P>
<P>
Turn off heat under pan while rolling each batch, then reheat before frying 
triangles. Makes about 24.

work and disdained money -- but they knew how to entertain. A barbacoa at 
Ventura's Los Olivos Adobe meant that vast platters of food -- enchiladas, 
hand-made tortillas, and the world's best beans -- came out of the rustic 
kitchen. But the important food -- rosemary-marinated lamb -- was cooked

<DESCRIPT>  FRUIT; RECIPE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  WHEN I was looking for a quick, easy dessert that was also low in fat, fruit
compotes naturally came to mind. These refreshing treats appeared often on the
table during my childhood, and were second only to my mother's homemade cakes
as my dessert of choice.;    Compote, another word for poached fruit, can be
made from fresh or dried fruit or a mixture of both. At elegant restaurants,
it is served in a stemmed dessert dish called a compotier.  </LEADPARA>

INTO DELICIOUSLY WARM DESSERT

<MEMO>  Cook It Quick
Faye Levy is the author of the three-volume "Fresh from France" cookbook
series, published by E.P. Dutton, and of "Sensational Pasta," published by HP
Books.)  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The classic poaching syrup is made of sugar and water and scented with a
vanilla bean. For dried fruit and pears, the syrup is often made with red
wine, which imparts a wonderful color and flavor to the fruit. Port, Madeira,
sherry, sweet white wine or apple cider can replace half the water in the
syrup. Honey or maple syrup are sometimes substituted for the sugar.;    If
you prefer zesty desserts, there is a wide range of spices and other aromatic
flavorings you can add to the syrup such as lemon or orange peel and juice,
cinnamon sticks and cloves, fresh ginger, allspice berries, aniseed or even
black or white peppercorns.;    Since compote is a light dessert, it is
perfect after a copious meal. It involves little work, can be made ahead and
is ready in minutes.;    Compote is served warm or cold with a few tablespoons
of the syrup. If you like a more sauce-like syrup, you can boil it down or can
thicken it further with a few tablespoons of jelly. At serving time, a splash
of Grand Marnier, Calvados (apple brandy) or pear brandy gives the fruit
sparkle.;    Offer compote as a refreshing accompaniment for angel food or
pound cake. Serve warm fruit compote over pancakes or waffles for brunch. For
a fast fruit crumble, sprinkle apple or pear compote with granola, warm it
briefly in the oven and top it with scoops of vanilla ice cream.;    (hbox);  
 If you like baked apples, you will appreciate this apple compote, which cooks
much faster. Serve the compote on its own or topped with whipped cream or
vanilla ice cream. If any syrup is left over, you can use it to poach more
fruit or as a light sauce for ice cream. If vanilla beans are not available,
or for a different taste, substitute 1 cinnamon stick.;     VANILLA-SCENTED
APPLE COMPOTE;  3/4 cup sugar; 3 cups water; 1 vanilla bean;  Zest of 1 lemon
or 1 orange, removed with a vegetable peeler, optional; 1 to 1 1/4 pounds
golden delicious or Granny Smith apples (3 or 4 medium); 1 tablespoon lemon
juice;   Combine sugar, water, vanilla bean and lemon zest in medium saucepan.
Bring to boil, stirring gently to dissolve sugar. Remove from heat.;    Peel
apples, halve and remove cores. Cut each half in two. Return syrup to boil and
add apple quarters and lemon juice. Reduce heat to low. Cover with lid that is
a bit too small for saucepan to keep apples submerged. Cook 8 to 12 minutes or
until apples are very tender when pierced with point of knife.;    For thicker
syrup, remove apples and simmer syrup a few minutes or until thickened to
taste. Let apples cool in syrup. Serve warm, at room temperature or cold.
(Apples can be kept in syrup about 4 days in refrigerator.) Makes 4 servings.;
   Pear compote: Peel 1 1/2 pounds ripe, but fairly firm, pears and rub them
well with cut side of lemon half. Halve pears and remove cores. Poach about 12
minutes. For pears in red wine, substitute dry red wine for the water -- in
this case there is no need to rub peeled pears with lemon.;    Pineapple
compote: Increase sugar to 1 cup and water to 3 1/3 cups. Peel 4-pound
pineapple and cut crosswise in 1/2-inch-thick slices. Cook 8 minutes or until
slices are tender at edges.; (hbox);    Prunes are the best fruit for
preparing this way, but a package of mixed dried fruit gives the dessert a
variety of colors and textures.;     DRIED FRUIT COMPOTE WITH RED WINE; 1
pound pitted prunes or mixed dried fruit; 1 bottle (3 cups) dry red or white
wine;  1/2 to 1 cup water; 1 cinnamon stick; 1 bay leaf, optional;  Zest of 1
lemon or 1 orange, removed with vegetable peeler, optional;  1/2 cup sugar;  
Combine fruit and wine in saucepan and add enough water to barely cover. Add
cinnamon stick, bay leaf and lemon zest. Sprinkle mixture with sugar. Gently
stir over low heat to dissolve sugar. Cover and cook over low heat 20 to 30
minutes or until tender. Transfer to bowl and let cool, spooning wine over
fruit from time to time. Serve cold. (Fruit can be kept, covered, 2 weeks in
refrigerator.) Makes 6 to 8 servings.; (hbox);    This easy, elegant dessert
combines poached fruit with a quick berry sauce made from the poaching syrup
and frozen berries. If you like, top each portion with a scoop of vanilla ice
cream and spoon a little sauce over it.;     FRUIT COMPOTE WITH BERRY SAUCE; 
Apple, pear or pineapple compote (recipe above), with 1/4 cup of its syrup; 1
(10- to 12-ounce) package frozen unsweetened or lightly sweetened
strawberries, raspberries or blackberries, thawed; 3 tablespoons syrup from
compote; 3 or 4 tablespoons powdered sugar or to taste; 1 to 2 tablespoons
lemon juice, optional;  Fresh mint sprigs for garnish, optional;   Prepare and
cool compote. Puree thawed berries with 3 tablespoons syrup from compote in
food processor or blender. If using raspberries or blackberries, strain sauce,
pressing on puree so seeds remain in strainer. Sift powdered sugar into sauce
and mix well. Taste and add more syrup, powdered sugar or lemon juice to
taste.;    Spoon fruit pieces into 4 dessert dishes and spoon over a little
sauce or make a bed of sauce and spoon fruit pieces on top. Garnish with mint.
Serve remaining sauce separately. Makes 4 servings.  </TEXT>

   Supermarket produce counters are taking on a
special look these days, with bean sprouts, bok choy, guava and
other exotic items catching the eye of food shoppers, an Agriculture
Department economist said Wednesday.
   ``Specialty fruit and vegetable displays form a fundamental part
of the new up-scale image of many produce sections,'' said Catherine
Greene of the department's Economic Research Service.
   Rising demand for specialty produce is in line with a general
increase in fruit and vegetable consumption, she said. On the
average, Americans consumed 427 pounds of fruits and vegetables last
year, up 12 percent since 1972. That is a farm weight equivalent
before trimming, processing and after-harvest losses, she said.
   Greene said the per capita trend is expected to continue upward,
although there could be some year-to-year variations. For example,
she said, this year's drought probably will cause some decline from
the 1987 average.
   In any case, specialty fruits and vegetables are the rage among
many consumers, and there is no sign the demand will taper off soon.
Greene, writing in the agency's National Food Review, said there are
a number of reasons.
   ``Americans have become more health conscious, eating lots of
fruits and vegetables as part of a well-balanced diet,'' she said.
``Consequently, we want a huge selection of produce.''
   Further, Americans travel more frequently than they used to, and
many want ``foreign'' foods when they return home.
   ``Unusual fruits and vegetables are appearing on restaurant
menus,'' Greene said. ``Also influencing our diets are recent
immigrants from the Caribbean, Central America and Southeast Asia
who have brought their native foods with them.''
   A recent survey by the industry's Food Marketing Institute showed
that the number of items sold in supermarket produce departments
more than doubled to 150 between the mid-1970s and the early 1980s.
Today, more than 250 items is the norm, including new packs and
sizes of traditional fruits and vegetables, along with exotic and
specialty produce.
   Another survey conducted for a trade journal, The Packer, showed
the most frequently tried specialty fresh vegetables were alfalfa
and bean sprouts, followed by snow peas, pearl onions, parsnips,
leeks, baby vegetables, Chinese cabbage and shallots.
   Moreover, about a third of those surveyed also had seen or heard
of less widely known specialty vegetables such as Belgian endive,
bok choy, celeriac, daikon, kohlrabi, parsley root and Jerusalem
artichoke.
   The most frequently tried specialty fresh fruits, in order, were
pomegranates, persimmons, kumquats, quince and guavas.
   Additionally, at least a third of those surveyed had seen or
heard of breadfuit, passion fruit, plantains, prickly pear and red
bananas. But some fruits were nearly unkown: Asian pears,
carambolas, cherimoyas, sapotes, radiccho and rappini.
   Greene said the survey showed that consumers in the Western
United States are more likely to try specialty produce and fresh
herbs, another group of growth items. One factor is the West's large
Asian and Hispanic populations, with their interests in exotic
produce.
   Also, it was shown that consumers in the upper income brackets
eat more of the speciality fruits and vegetables.
   ``They may be better informed about the variety of produce
available and better able to afford the premium prices that
specialities sometimes command,'' Greene said.

A wind-swept "Moon Over the Mediterranean" gala that celebrated Fashion Island 
Newport Center's $100-million renovation. On Wednesday night, a few thousand 
well-heeled guests swept along gleaming tile walkways, rhapsodized over new 
fountains, explored new shops, and sipped, supped and swayed till the wee 
hours, helping to chalk up more than $250,000 for seven local youth charities: 
the Orange County Philharmonic Youth Programs, the Mardan Center of Educational 
Therapy, the Irvine Theatre Children's Programs, the Orange County Bar 
Foundation, Shortstop Program, Childhelp USA and the Irvine Children's Fund. 
</P>
<P>
The Food 
</P>
<P>
The Mediterranean never had it so good. Thymes caterers was faithful to the 
theme, serving up 5,000 pounds of herb-seasoned beef and 1,000 pounds each of 
grilled tuna and swordfish, not to mention bushels of pasta and enough 
chocolate brownies to sink a yacht. Other highlights: three kinds of fresh 
pears quartered and dipped into an apricot candied syrup, grilled, then served 
with a zabaglione cream. Another mob pleaser: chicken marinated in pomegranate 
juice (400 pomegranates were crushed to a pulp to pull this one off) and 
seasoned with sage, garlic and thyme. The bubbly, served on silver trays, never 
stopped flowing. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted 
</P>
<P>
"Newport Center has become a Mediterranean town," said billionaire Donald Bren, 
chairman of the Irvine Co., which, along with The Times Orange County, 
sponsored the benefit. "The climate here is the same as the Mediterranean's and 
so is the architecture. This center exudes a radiance, an energy. It will 
become a special way of life for everyone." His favorite shop? "I enjoy them 
all," Bren said. His favorite restaurant? "I enjoy them all too." 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There 
</P>
<P>
Benefit chairpersons Sharon Sarvak, Joyce Gwidt, Ginny Hayward, Mary Ellen 
Hadley, Judith Ryan and Mitzi Tonai, along with a herd of Irvine Co. heavy 
hitters, a horde of Yuppies and a gaggle of socialites. 
</P>
<P>
What They Wore 
</P>
<P>
Bren sported a deep-burgundy tie with a supremely well-cut charcoal gray suit. 
A white pocket square accented his ensemble. He also wore a golden-boy tan (we 
hear he's taken up wind-surfing in Maui and on the Caribbean). The chairwomen 
were dressed to kill, with Judy Ryan sporting a chic St. John knit jumpsuit and 
Joyce Gwidt shielding herself against the nippy breezes in a suede coat she'd 
purchased during a recent getaway in Italy. Thymes owner Janet Rosener proved a 
walkie-talkie looks absolutely charming with figure-hugging black velvet. And 
furs -- loads of them -- were flung over glittery party dresses. 
</P>
<P>
Tender Moment

ETHNIC EATING: PAKISTANIS SET SPICY TABLE AT BUNDOO KHAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Picture a free-living Pathan tribesman on Pakistan's northwest frontier. He 
takes a handful of chopped meat, spices it vigorously and tosses it onto the 
grill. Pressing the meat flat with a big, rough hand, he cooks it to a 
sizzling, earthy brown. This is chaplee kebab, and you can have it at Bundoo 
Khan, a new Pakistani restaurant in mid Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province is mountainous land adjoining 
Afghanistan. In this rugged terrain, even vegetables are boldly cooked. Strong 
notes of vinegar, lemon juice and ginger turn a combination of ordinary produce 
such as cauliflower, broccoli and carrots into a dish that demands respect. And 
frontier gosht adds powerful seasonings to beef cubes grilled Pathan style. 
</P>
<P>
Away from the frontier, food is pretty zesty too, judging by the rest of Bundoo 
Khan's menu. Karahi gosht can be downright dangerous if you bite into one of 
the small green chiles simmered with this lamb dish. The grilled morsels of 
beef called boti kebab are thick with spice paste, and seekh kebab shows how 
spices can electrify ground beef. 
</P>
<P>
Even the vegetable samosas are exciting thanks to bright seasonings that 
include dried pomegranate seeds, cumin and garam masala. Another vegetable 
dish, aloo palak, includes spinach that might have been too hot for Popeye. The 
spinach hides little cubes of potato, and its dark hue shows off a scattering 
of golden channa dal, one of the pulses that add protein to Indian vegetarian 
dishes. 
</P>
<P>
One has to admire a fledgling restaurant (it opened in June) that is courageous 
enough to serve this intensely flavored food rather than taming it down for 
average palates. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is an Islamic state, and Bundoo Khan is Islamic right down to the sign 
by the door that warns against the drinking of alcoholic beverages. The flowing 
Arabic inscriptions on the wall plaques are passages from the Koran. And the 
menu makes it clear that the food is halal, meaning acceptable to Muslims. 
Meats come from animals that have been slaughtered according to Islamic 
precepts; pork is excluded. 
</P>
<P>
A rare Muslim dish that Bundoo Khan offers occasionally is haleem, a highly 
seasoned puree that includes whole wheat, three kinds of lentils and beef. The 
texture and flavor call to mind refried beans, but instead of cheese, the dish 
is garnished with fried onion shreds and ginger. Another special dish, nihari, 
features shreddy beef in a dark sauce that has a strong note of cloves. Ginger 
shreds and sliced hot green chiles augment the spices. 
</P>
<P>
Ready-made masalas (spice mixtures) for nihari and haleem are available down 
the street at the Islamic Food Mart, which is the source of Bundoo Khan's 
meats. The masalas, imported from Pakistan, come with recipes in English and 
Arabic. The market also stocks Pakistani mango chutney, which the restaurant 
serves along with its own tamarind and mint chutneys. 
</P>
<P>
What Bundoo Khan lacks is a tandoor oven, but you wouldn't know that from 
tasting the tangy, red-tinted chicken tikka. Whole roast chargha chicken 
curiously had very little flavor, although the seasonings included finely 
ground jalapenos, cilantro, mint, cloves and peppercorns. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of tandoori breads there are chapatis so large they have to be folded 
into the bread basket and parathas that are browned in oil to make the exterior 
crisp and flaky. Pistachio kulfi (ice cream) is far from mild. The flavoring 
that will make you wonder what you are tasting is kewra essence, which even in 
small quantities gives the effect of eating lumber in a pine forest. Here the 
dose is small enough to mute that woodsy quality. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a large chargha chicken at $20 and a whole roast leg of lamb for 
$50, the prices at Bundoo Khan are low. Most entrees, including the chaplee 
kebab, haleem and nihari, are $6.95. Two large samosas are $2, and aloo palak 
and frontier vegetables are each $3.95. Another dish worth trying is lamb 
biryani, a combination of lamb and rice for $6.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Bundoo Khan, 116 S. Vermont Ave., Los Angeles; (213) 380-7574. Open daily from 
11 a.m. to 11 p.m. MasterCard and Visa accepted. Free parking in the shopping 
center lot.

FT  04 DEC 93 / How To Spend It: Flowers for the festive season - Fabric and
foliage are fashionable accessories when it comes to decoration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you had asked either of my grannies they would have been quite astonished
at the notion that flowers could be in and out of favour. The very idea that
the chrysanthemum, the iris or the carnation (let alone, shudder, shudder,
the poor old spray carnation) would be given such a heave-ho by the
chicken-wire and 'oasis' set would have been enough to confirm them in their
vision of a world gone mad.
But I am sure that those of you who are even now planning the decorations
for the festive season at chateau mon repos would like to know that the
marigold (once a real no-no) is back in favour.
How do I know?
Well, Caroline Dickenson ('one of London's most innovative florists') tells
me so and she ought to know.
Caroline has recently turned the ballroom and other banqueting areas at the
Dorchester Hotel into a veritable scene from Arabian Nights and, using
12ft-tall candelabras decked with cream roses (not one to emulate chez vous
 -a trifle ambitious perhaps for the domestic setting) transformed a London
site into a set from the film Orlando.
In addition, she regularly does the flowers for chic eateries such as Le
Gavroche and Mosimann's as well as Christian Lacroix, Cartier and Yves St
Laurent.
This Christmas, says Caroline, it is artificial decorations that are the
no-no: 'The trend is towards mixing berries and natural evergreen foliages
such as trailing ivy, blue spruce and larch twigs with seasonal flowers
combined with fruits, nuts and vegetables.
'If you are aiming for a traditional look, use strong colours such as rich
dark reds, bright oranges and purples with various shades of dark green.
'Fabric is very much in evidence, too - ranging from bows made from silk
organza to lengths of crushed velvet swathed through and round decorations.
To add some glitz use gilded fruits such as pomegranates, apples and oranges
and nuts. Adding spices and herbs such as cinnamon sticks, anise and bay to
an arrangement will fill the room with a subtle yet exotic scent.'
Indeed, great florists obviously think alike - at this week's grand Royal
Opera House dinner at the Whitehall Palace, one of London's most
sought-after creators of magical effects, Paul Dyson, had used a very
similar decorative approach.
He had featured lots of brilliant strong colours in the flowers - reds,
oranges, ambers - and the staircase was richly swathed with flowers, foliage
and generous swags of ruby red velvet.
'Candles,' says Caroline, 'shed a soft glimmering light but if you are
trying to create a rich, warm effect use dark red, green and purple coloured
candles instead of white.
'To create a strong effect group decorations together rather than scattering
them around separately. There should be continuity in the theme. For
instance, if you are using blue pine you can use it in all sorts of
different ways - from decorating a fireplace and a staircase to forming the
base for a wall hanging or door wreath.'
The scheme photographed here at Mosimann features many of her precepts -
deep rich colours, strong groupings, fabric and, above, all a sense of
generosity. Decorations should never be mean and sparsely scattered.
Fireplaces are often the focal point of a room and a decorated mantelpiece
can set the warm and welcoming scene. Swagging made from blue spruce can be
draped along the mantelpiece and down each side of the fireplace.
Bunches of red and orange full-blown roses and bunches of red anemones (for
which 10 stems per bunch seems the approved number) can be tied on tightly
with string or floristry wire. These will obviously only last for a few days
so be prepared to change them and to put them in place as close to the last
minute as you can bear.
Bunches of evergreen foliages, berries and larch twigs with lichen can be
attached with floristry wire along the swagging to soften the look. A length
of crushed velvet could also be swagged along the mantelpiece. Add bundles
of cinnamon sticks, apples and tangerines - again attach with floristry
wire.
When it comes to the table she suggests taking several different-sized
terracotta pots. Line them with black bin liners to prevent water leaking.
Then fill them with evergreen foliage, berries, anemones and roses echoing
the colours used for decorating the mantelpiece.
A large terracotta pot in the centre and smaller ones around the table works
well. (They might also make good presents to give guests to take home.)
The pots can be linked with swathes of crushed velvet (velvet, you will have
gathered, is the fabric of the year) along the centre of the table or with
trails of ivy leaves and foliage such as skimmia or variegated holly.
Bunches of berries, foliage and flowers can also be attached to candelabras
with floristry wire.
Many of these precepts apply to decorating the tree - above all, do not
skimp, do not be mean. You should allow at least 10 lights for every foot of
tree and try to make sure the wire and tape are the same colour as the tree.
Decorations can be made from bows of velvet ribbon or silk organza, with fir
cones, bunches of lavender, tiny terracotta pots stuffed with paper and
topped with glued-in nuts and the whole effect can be softened with added
bunches of larch covered in lichen.
If you can handle all that little lot yourself you are a better person than
I am - or better organised or less busy.
The ill-organised, the lazy or the genuinely over-worked can call in
Caroline Dickenson herself: she can either supply the wherewithall (the blue
spruce swagging, the door wreathes, the flowers, the floristry and chicken
wire, the oasis and the gilded pomegranates, dried orange slices, peppers
and chillies) which you can deploy skilfully around the house. Or she will
come and do it all for you.
Her prices range from Pounds 10 for a simple arrangement to Pounds 5,000 for
a grand hall but there is a lot more in between.
Caroline Dickenson is at 5, William Street, Knightsbridge, London SW1X 9HL.

EGGPLANT: FOOD INDIGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVAN KLEIMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eggplant is the food sponge of the vegetable world; its greatest asset is its 
ability to absorb flavors. In addition, its own natural sweet, bland flavor 
acts as the perfect foil for an endless combination of seasonings. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its unique spongy flesh, the taste and texture of eggplant changes 
dramatically depending on the cooking method used. Grilling lends a meaty 
succulence to the vegetable, especially when followed by a savory marinade of 
good-quality vinegar, olive oil and herbs; frying brings out the sweetness; and 
roasting results in a creamy, nutty flesh. 
</P>
<P>
Although all varieties, regardless of shape or color, have the same taste, 
different types of eggplant lend themselves to different preparations. The 
small white egg-shaped fruits and the Japanese types are perfect for stuffing 
and baking; we also like to roast them whole with heads of garlic. Standard 
large purple eggplant yield slices suitable for grilling or frying. In 
addition, standard eggplants are perfect when roasted whole so that you can 
scoop out the creamy flesh for dips and cold salads. 
</P>
<P>
Of the standard eggplant varieties, Black Beauty, Beauty Hybrid and Burpee 
Hybrid are the most commonly grown. Some Japanese-type eggplants are Ichiban, 
Early Long Purple and Long Tom Hybrid. For lovely small white fruits, try 
planting Easter Egg. Rosa Blanca yields a large, round violet- 
and-white-streaked fruit. All varieties of eggplant are perfectly suitable for 
growing in containers, which should be a minimum of 5 gallons in size. Japanese 
eggplants grown in containers are particularly beautiful on a sunny porch. 
</P>
<P>
A few words about salting. Many recipes suggest salting sliced eggplant before 
cooking to extract bitterness. The source of the vegetable's potential 
bitterness are its seeds, which have a high water content. Salting draws out 
the water and -- with it -- the eggplant's bitterness. When the eggplant is 
young, as it usually is when picked from the home garden, its seeds are pale. 
Older fruits have darker, sometimes even black seeds. We feel that it is 
necessary to salt only older eggplants with darker seeds. Whether in the garden 
or the supermarket, always look for eggplants with taut, glossy skin; these 
qualities are good indicators of youth. 
</P>
<P>
 A highly seasoned mixture of ground lamb and spices is stuffed into the shell 
of the eggplant and baked. For the right portion size, pick eggplant when they 
are about 6 inches long and 4 inches in diameter.

PLANTING ALERT: 
</P>
<P>
Fall can be an incredibly rewarding time in the garden. It's when we realize 
that, in Southern California, we can plant year round. 
</P>
<P>
Now is the time to plant onions, garlic, shallots from sets. Greens such as 
chard, spinach, collards and all types of lettuce can be started from seed, as 
can beets and turnips.

<LEADPARA>  Traditional food for Rosh Hashana, which begins at sundown Sept. 8, varies by
region. But the theme of sweetness and joy for the New Year unites Jewish
celebrants around the world. Foods frequently served include honey, apples,
dates, quinces, pomegranates, leeks, Swiss chard, green beans, carrots,
turnips, zucchini, lamb and fish, according to Alain Levy, chef at the
Culinary Institute of America. Levy says it is customary before the meal to
dip a piece of apple in honey and wish for the coming year to be just as
sweet. Honey stands for the sweetness of the year ahead; stuffed foods for
abundance; the leek for good luck; fish for fertility, among other happy
aspects of life.;  LAMB WITH VEGETABLES  </LEADPARA>

<LEADPARA>  WITHOUT question, this is the best time to buy local produce, because summer
and winter produce seasons have overlapped.;   There's barely enough room for
everything at produce stands, and what's there is exploding with color --
black globe eggplants, red and gold tomatoes, deep orange and green winter
squash.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Food  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  SEASONS COLLIDE AT PRODUCE STAND  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Produce; Chef Jesse Cool is co-founder of Flea Street Cafe and Late for the
Train in Menlo Park.; Additional information attached to the end of this
article.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Savor it because the bulk of summer produce is nearing its end, and there
won't be many new and exciting crops from our growing area until next spring.
Local corn, grapes, melons, eggplant and summer squash will disappear within
the next few weeks.;   But as long as the weather stays warm, there will be a
wide variety of local organic tomatoes. The dry-farmed ones from Molino Creek
Farm I mentioned recently are sweeter this year than ever. Basil is still
prolific and peppers and chilies are flooding the produce stands.;   Fall
vegetables and fruits are just beginning. Baby root vegetables, tender young
fennel, winter squashes, pumpkins, root vegetables, cabbages, choys and the
vast arrays of leafy bitter and spicy greens will be at their peak as the
weather gets colder.;   A few fruits and vegetables are in their second
harvest and perfect for eating now.;   The second crop of fresh potatoes is
ready. My favorite, because people oooh and aah over them, are the bright
purple-fleshed Purple Peruvians. Irregularly shaped with black skin, they are
wonderful steamed or roasted. Forget peeling them or any tender-skinned
potato.;   Red-skinned baby Pontiacs, white-fleshed baking russets, golden
nutty Yellow Fins and, from Santa Cruz, sweet and nutty, finger-shaped
potatoes called ruby crescent or fingerlings may be eaten now or stored for
your holiday feasts.;   There is also a second harvest of berries from the
Watsonville area. Raspberries and strawberries are prolific and I think
sweeter this time around.;   There are many varieties of beans available too.;
  Snap beans will be around through November. Yellow wax, green and yellow
Romanos are coming from Pescadero. Baby Blue Lakes are still being harvested
at Webb Ranch in Menlo Park. When you can find them, purple runner beans (they
have glossy purple pods) should be eaten raw, because they turn dark green
when cooked.;   Interesting at their prime are fresh shelling beans. Look for
maroon-and-cream-skinned fresh cranberry beans. Although Phipps Ranch in
Pescadero specializes in dry beans, they occasionally have fresh shelling
beans for sale. They also give the kids big recycled cans to go out and pick
fruits and vegetables for themselves. You'll be amazed at what kids will eat,
beans included, if they pick their own.;   At Phipps, I've never seen so vast
a variety of dry beans. Just to look at them is worth the trip. Plus, it is
great for kids because it has a mini-aviary and zoo.;   Meaty and full-bodied
in flavor, fava beans take some time to remove from the pod, but they are
worth it. I simmer them until tender and then dress as I would fresh limas.;  
Tiny light green flageolets are a favorite in France and take barely any
cooking time. Butter and salt and pepper is all they need. I bet you won't be
able to stop eating them.;   Remember: Shelling beans such as cranberries and
favas must be removed from the pod before cooking.;   By mid-November, be sure
to have your dry storage bins full of apples, pears, potatoes, onions, garlic
and squash to use when little else is growing.;   I want to encourage you to
eat summer produce while it lasts. Freeze or can as much as possible now when
it's in its prime. This will ensure good-tasting treasures when the fresh
alternative is not in season.; FRESH FAVA BEANS WITH OLIVE OIL, LEMON AND
GARLIC; 1 pound fresh shelled fava or lima beans;  Water to cover; 1/4 cup
virgin olive oil; 3 to 4 cloves fresh garlic, chopped;  Juice of 1 or 2
lemons; 1/2 cup Italian parsley, coarsely chopped; 2 tablespoons fresh
oregano, chopped;  Salt and fresh ground pepper to taste;  Asiago, Parmesan or
aged Romano cheese;  In a covered saucepan, simmer beans in water until
tender, approximately 20 minutes. Drain off water and immediately toss with
all remaining ingredients. Serve warm as a side dish or room temperature as a
salad or appetizer. Garnish with thinly shaved aged Italian cheese.;   Note:
You can also coarsely chop the seasoned beans, add more olive oil and
seasonings and serve on slices of crusty baguette as an appetizer.; COOL TIPS;
(box) Seed and freeze yellow or red bell peppers. Thaw, drain and chop or
puree to add sweetness or zestiness to cold-weather sauces and stews. Drizzle
with a little olive oil, serve on top of a salad or with an antipasto.; (box)
Remove stems from fresh basil, blanch for 10 seconds, puree in food processor
and freeze in ice cube trays for later use.; (box) Core whole tomatoes, then
coat with olive oil and roast until the skin is brown. Freeze. Thaw and puree
for a tomato sauce that should knock your socks off.; (box) Remember those
old-fashioned desserts like pudding, tapioca and shortcake? Make them from
scratch. Top with fresh whole or pureed strawberries or raspberries and
whipped cream.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Can't get your kids to eat vegetables? Perhaps you're not trying the right

<TEXT>     (box) Rich in vitamin C and potassium, watermelon has 50 calories per cup
and no fat or cholesterol.;    (box) When choosing a watermelon, some people
thump, some smell, some shake, some feel the rind. But one out of four
consumers rely on plain old luck to choose a ripe watermelon.;    (box) The
most reliable method is turn the melon over. If the underside is yellow and
the rind overall has a healthy sheen, the watermelon is probably ripe.;   
(box) Choose a watermelon that if free from dents, bruises and cuts. The skin
should be even, but several insect bites in the rind or marks left from the
vine won't affect the melon's flavor.;    (box) The watermelon should be heavy
for its size.;    (box) Never cook watermelon; cooking returns it to its
cucumber roots, losing texture and sweetness.;    (box) Don't chop watermelon
too finely or it will disintegrate when mixed with other ingredients.;   
(check) Store whole watermelon between 50 and 60 degrees for no more than two
weeks. Once cut and wrapped, watermelon slices should be kept chilled and
eaten within two days.;    (box) Don't wrap pre-cut slices too tightly, or the
flesh will become mushy.;    (box) Freezing also makes watermelon mushy and
mealy.;    (box) All watermelon stored more than two weeks loses its sugar

<LEADPARA>  THE fermented black beans have been sitting in the door of my refrigerator
since Reagan's first term. They're positioned just above the sweet chili sauce
I bought at a Thai market that has long since gone out of business. And the
tahini just below that? Well, how much hummus can you eat?;   Sound familiar?  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Food  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  NOW,...WHAT DO I DO WITH THIS
IS YOUR FRIDGE SCREAMING TO BE CLEARED OF ALL
THOSE HALF-USED JARS OF SAUCES, OILS AND OTHER
CONDIMENTS? TAKE HEART; THOSE FORGOTTEN FOODS CAN
BE USED TO CREATE DISHES WORTH REMEMBERING  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Story; See also related article on page 7E of this section.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Perhaps the dark recesses of your refrigerator contain the remains of a
half gallon of Kansas City barbecue sauce (too bad you're just plain barbecued
out). And what about that Vietnamese fish sauce, those funny little capers
(are they still good?) and the family-size bottle of oyster sauce your husband
bought at Price Club because it's cheaper per ounce than the smaller sizes?;  
Now, every time you open the refrigerator or pantry door, a dozen half-used
jars of exotic and not so exotic ingredients stare you in the face and bleat,
"Use me! Use me!";   Don't put up with that jabber. Here's what to do with
those sauces and other condiments so they won't haunt you until the next power
failure forces you to chuck the whole lot of them.;   The first rule of using
ingredient leftovers is to take off your culinary blinders. Who says sesame
oil can be used only in Chinese dishes? The other day on KCBS radio, Narsai
David said he uses sesame oil in his bread recipes instead of vegetable oil.
He reasoned that it would give the bread a nice nutty flavor. And because
sesame oil is pungent, he uses less of it than other oils.;   Rule No. 2 is a
corollary of No. 1. Here's an example. If a vinaigrette is made up of oil and
acid (vinegar and/or lemon juice), why can't you mix sesame oil and red wine
vinegar or olive oil and rice wine vinegar?;   Rule No. 3 is to think balance.
If you're combining sharp flavors such as vinegars and spicy condiments,
mellow out the dish with a dab of cream. Or give it a fresh accent with fresh
herbs.;   Rule No. 4 is to have fun. Hey folks, this is food, not nuclear
disarmament. And if your wife says the fermented black bean vinaigrette smells
fishy, so what?;   Here are a bunch of common and not-so-common leftover
ingredients and how to use them up.;    Barbecue sauce;   If the thought of
one more thing on the grill turns you off, try that leftover barbecue sauce
with pasta. Combine a 28-ounce can of chopped tomatoes with half as much
barbecue sauce. Throw in four ounces of sliced mushrooms sauteed in butter
with some chopped onions. Add fresh chopped basil and simmer 20 minutes. Add a
cup of heavy cream and simmer 10 minutes more.;   In general, use in place of
ketchup for dishes such as meatloaf (good old meatloaf hides a lot of things),
on hot dogs, in taco fillings and in baked beans. Or try on pizzas (especially
if you have a little barbecued chicken left over to go with it).;   Fermented
black beans;   Yes, they smell like they've been taken from the compost heap,
but these salted (and partially decomposed) soy beans add a distinctive accent
to Asian and non-Asian dishes alike. Put them in a vinaigrette with olive oil,
garlic and sherry vinegar and toss with bitter greens. Use with hot pepper and
ginger in a sauce for shellfish. They go surprisingly well with tomatoes in a
sauce for pasta or clams (see recipe). Also, try with garlic in a stir-fry of
hearty greens such as kale. To modify their strong flavor somewhat, soak in
warm water for 30 minutes and drain. Or use in a marinade and discard them.;  
Fish sauce;   Nuoc mam if you're Vietnamese, nam pla if you're Thai, and
stinko if you're just about anyone else. The flavor of this fish sauce isn't
as strong as the smell. Since both cultures use it in lieu of soy sauce,
substitute it in recipes that call for soy -- sauces, marinades and dressings.
Use in fish marinades with chopped shallots, sherry vinegar and nut oils such
walnut (if it's a mild fish) or sesame oil.;   Use in recipes that call for
anchovy such as tapenade (a puree of olives, garlic and anchovies). Add a
tablespoon to Caesar salad dressing (not as weird as you think; the original
Caesar had Worcestershire sauce, made with anchovies). Add to garlic, white
wine and olive oil as a quick sauce for steamed mussels. If you need a little
fish stock or clam juice but don't have either, try fish sauce, perhaps
diluted with a little water. And with hot pepper, garlic, rice vinegar, lime
or lemon juice and a little sugar, it makes a great all-purpose dip for almost
any fried food.;   Tahini;   A paste of ground sesame seeds, it's most
commonly used in hummus, the Middle Eastern bean dip. But Asian dishes often
use sesame paste, though Asian sesame paste has toasted seeds. So, try it in
cold, spicy Sichuan noodle dishes with leftover chicken. Add garlic to it and
thin with water and lemon juice for taratoor sauce, great on steamed or fried
vegetables or mixed with roasted sweet peppers. Since it has the look and
consistency of peanut butter, use it as such, spread on toast or bagels with
jam (try with Middle Eastern fig jam). Or put in a satay instead of peanut
butter.;   Sesame and other oils;   Use in combination with other oils,
notably peanut, for salad dressings. Use as a simple marinade for meats, fish
and poultry. Asian food expert Bruce Cost suggests adding a little to
scrambled eggs or mixing it with mustard for basting roast fowl. When you run
out of tahini but not chick peas, make this variation of hummus from "Good &amp;
Plenty" by Victoria Wise and Susanna Hoffman (Harper &amp; Row, $22.95): Puree 2
cups drained chick peas with three cloves garlic in a food processor. Add 1/2
cup olive oil, 1/4 cup sesame oil, 2 tablespoons lemon juice and salt to
taste. Puree.;   Use almond and walnut oils for fish and poultry marinades and
in lightly seasoned vinaigrettes for mild greens or fruit. Avocado oil can be
used in dressings (especially with tomatoes) or to give an extra punch to
guacamole.;    Oyster sauce;   Think of this as the Chinese equivalent of A-1
Sauce and use it accordingly. Terrific on grilled steak. Enliven it with some
hot chilies, soy and sesame oil, if you like. A few dashes accent stir-fried
broccoli or greens such as collards. Or try this dip from "The Encyclopedia of
Asian Food and Cooking" by Jacki Passmore (Hearst Books, $25): In a saucepan,
mix 1 tablespoon each soy and oyster sauce with 2/3 cup chicken stock, 2
tablespoons minced scallions, 1/2 teaspoon sugar and 1 teaspoon cornstarch.
Bring to a boil, then stir until thickened.;    Hoisin sauce;   Use this thick
soybean sauce as is for a barbecue sauce or mix in barbecue sauce recipes
instead of ketchup. You can even use it elsewhere as a sub for ketchup such as
in meatloaf (see recipe). Use as a dip or condiment for roast pork. Spread on
tortillas for a Mexican mu shu pork with carnitas.;   Or, try this delicious
hoisin marinade for chicken adapted from "Ken Hom's East Meets West Cuisine"
(Simon and Schuster, $19.95): Combine two teaspoons fresh thyme leaves, six
tablespoons hoisin sauce, four tablespoons rice wine and two tablespoons olive
oil. Split a chicken in half, lengthwise, and rub marinade on halves. Put in a
dish or plastic bag with rest of marinade and let rest at least one hour.
Grill over indirect heat or bake in a 400 degree oven.;    Chili sauces;  
There are many styles, flavors and levels of heat, depending on whether
they're from Thailand, Vietnam or China. Use them as dips for fried foods by
themselves or mixed with soy sauce and chopped scallions. Add to meatloaf
instead of ketchup (or hoisin sauce). Or make a delicious barbecue glaze with
sweet Thai chili, red wine vinegar (to cut some of the sweetness) and fresh
chopped basil. Follow as above for hoisin marinade.;   Wines;   Chinese rice
wine (shaoxing): Substitute for sherry or sherry vinegar in recipes. Use it in
marinades for chicken, fish or pork with scallions, ginger, garlic and soy
sauce.;   Sherry: Use in vinaigrettes, in Chinese dishes that call for rice
wine or to deglaze a pan with sauteed chicken breasts or pork medallions.;  
Sake: Use in salad dressings, dips for fried foods (with soy sauce) and
marinades for grilled dishes.;   Madeira or Marsala: Deglaze a pan with
sauteed chicken, turkey or veal. Use Marsala to flavor Italian pastry creams.;
  Port: Poach fruit such as pears.;   Ginger;   When fresh, grate fine and use
in marinades, salad dressings and in salsas with fruit (mangoes are especially
good). Or make a simple chutney with leftover jam. Take a half jar of orange
marmalade, peach or apricot preserves, add a tablespoon of ginger (fresh or
candied) and a teaspoon of mustard seeds, if you have them. You can stick
candied ginger inside cored apples with butter and lemon juice and bake them
for a simple dessert now that apples are coming into season.;   Capers;  
Throw them in with sauteed veal, chicken or turkey with lemon juice and white
wine or vermouth.;    Anchovies;   Mix a small amount in salad dressings (it
doesn't have to be Caesar salad). Swirl some into beef or lamb stew. Or mix
with garlic and put into slits made in leg of lamb.;   Pickled jalapenos;  
Use on pizzas; in mayonnaise, sour cream or yogurt dips; in fruit chutneys and
salsas; and in pasta sauces.;    Star anise;   The best beef stew I've ever
eaten (at Food Street in Mountain View) was loaded with this. It can
substitute for regular anise or fennel.;   Pimentos or roasted peppers;  
Saute in olive oil with onions and garlic and throw in a can of drained
cannellini beans for a great side dish. Or toss with green beans, broccoli or
zucchini.  </TEXT>

FT  12 SEP 92 / Drink: A vodka or two in Tbilisi - Nicholas Woodsworth falls
victim to Georgian hospitality - and wonders how they manage to live so long
when they drink so much vodka and eat so much spicy food
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
TIMES are as hard for cooks as they are for everyone else these days in the
former Soviet empire, and it is not always easy to get something to eat. So
when I found a small restaurant on Pushkin Avenue, in the Georgian capital
of Tbilisi, actually open and serving food, I went in and sat down
gratefully.
It was not much of a place; just a few tables covered with plastic
tablecloths and laid with bent and tinny cutlery. A fluorescent tube
flickered on the low ceiling and a cold draught blew in under the door. In a
kitchen behind a self-service counter, greasy pots sat on a sauce-spattered
cooker. It was not the world's most cheerful establishment.
It was much more cheerful, though, than the world that lay immediately
around it. Just outside the door, soldiers of the Georgian National Guard
patrolled the streets, Kalashnikovs cradled on their chests. Store-front
windows were smashed, buildings were pock-marked with bullets, and many
shops and offices were closed.
Since declaring independence from the Soviet Union, Georgians had been swept
up in a spiral of economic chaos and political violence. Arriving in a lull
between bloody demonstrations, and street battles, I found little sense of
pleasure or relaxation in Tbilisi.
Great was my surprise, then, when I noticed a party of five elderly Georgian
men celebrating in a small alcove at the back of the restaurant. None
appeared to be under 80. Dressed in baggy suits and flat caps, their
stubbly, unshaven faces flushed with drink and emotion, they were carrying
on as if in advanced warm-up for a bacchanalian orgy.
In front of them lay a table scattered liberally with the remains of grand
over-indulgence: kebab skewers, chicken bones, empty cigarette packets,
scraps of food, the gnawed stems of pickled peppers, bowls of spicy sauces
and condiments, a dozen empty pots and serving dishes, and countless wine
and brandy bottles. The feast had been a large and protracted one.
The main meal over, the party had turned its attentions to drink, and was
well along its way to inebriation. There were long, loquacious and emotional
speeches, whiskery kisses and bear-hugs of comradeship, and many, many
up-endings of tumblers brimful of brandy. By the time I had finished eating
and was getting ready to leave, the old gents were preparing their voices
for a round of five-part Georgian counterpoint. As far as they were
concerned, it seemed, the world had never been a more convivial place. The
incident so impressed me that it was the first query I put to Nino, my
Georgian guide, as we rattled out of Tbilisi on our way to a tour of the
high Caucasus mountains.
Nino laughed. Such a thing, she said, was not so strange as it might seem.
'We Georgians have a reputation for good living. For us, friendship,
generosity and hospitality are the most important things in life. We love to
get together, to talk, to sing, to eat and to drink; probably a little too
much, sometimes.'
That was all very well, I replied, but even the most enthusiastic of bon
vivants tend to find tear gas and riot truncheons something of a damper to
any celebration. But, once again, Nino found little out of the ordinary in
this.
'What you saw last night,' she said, 'was not so much celebration as
commiseration. Georgia has been a land of violence and suffering through
much of its 3,000-year history. In the past 1,500 years alone, Tbilisi has
been invaded and sacked 29 times.'
'When we get together to eat, it is often to share not just food but our
suffering. When we toast each other over brandy, it is not in congratulation
but to ask for peace, security, fraternity and all the other things we need
so much and rarely have. Tbilisi is a sad place right now. I hope we will
have a chance to see Georgians when they are really happy.'
And so, a little while later, we did. What Nino did not mention, but what I
was soon to find out in the mountain village of Ushguli, was that the
Georgian code of hospitality extends not only to friends and family but to
complete strangers as well.
The inhabitants of the isolated villages of the Caucasus may no longer
believe, as once they did, that guests come from God, but they continue
nonetheless to reserve a heavenly welcome for them. Nowhere is Georgian
hospitality demonstrated more effusively than at the dinner table.
Protected behind a high wall of mountains, Georgians are something of an
anomaly among the many peoples of the former Soviet Union. Gregarious,
emotional, sensual, jealous of their traditions and and ferociously proud of
their fertile land, they have far more in common with the Mediterraneans
than their cousins to the frozen north. As in character, so in food. Ask any
Russian in Moscow where you can get the richest, most lavish meal in town
and chances are that he will point you to one of the capital's
highly-popular Georgian restaurants.
While much of Russia's daily cooking revolves around cabbages, beets,
potatoes and turnips, that of Georgia, taking advantage of productive soil
and a warm climate, is a far more exotic affair. Italians, Turks, Greeks,
Moroccans and Frenchmen might all be excused for finding elements of their
own cuisine in the area's rich fare.
Georgian cooking is, however, unique. Georgians are great meat-eaters but
their classic dishes, based on lamb, pork and chicken, are enlivened by
additions of great variety and contrast. Georgians are not afraid to combine
many different tastes in one individual dish. Take, for example, the popular
dish pkhali - minced spinach mixed with ground walnut paste, vinegar, garlic
and spices, the whole topped with tart pomegranate seeds. The result,
incongruous as it might seem, is delicious.
Nor do Georgians shirk from serving highly different dishes at the same
table at the same time. Ground hazelnut stuffings; delicate spicings of
basil, coriander or tarragon; meat dishes set off by pomegranates and plums;
fiery sauces of chilli peppers and garlic; cooling preparations of yoghurt
and mint; mille feuille pastries dripping with honey - typically, all will
be found at one time at the same Georgian meal.
Individual courses, in fact, have no place in Georgia. What is crucial - an
expression of the Georgian exuberance for abundance, generosity and sharing
 -is that the table is covered from one end to the other.
Loaded with serving bowls, platters, tureens, heaped plates, bottles of all
descriptions and glasses that are never empty, it must creak with the sheer
weight of food and drink.
More than 7,000 ft high in the mountains and a 14-hour, spine-rattling Jeep
ride from Tbilisi, Ushguli largely is cut off from the rest of the world
and, on the whole, remains as self-sufficient in food as it does in
everything else.
Snowed-in for most of the year, and with only the shortest of summer growing
seasons, the village cares as little for such normal Georgian delicacies as
stuffed baby aubergines as it does for communist theories of collective
production; neither has much role in this rude and demanding climate where
families rely on their own efforts to survive. What counts instead in these
high mountain valleys, and has counted since the bovine religious cults of
pre-Christian times, is cattle breeding and the products that come from it.
Stocky cattle farmer Kolia Nijaradze did not slaughter an entire cow when we
pitched up, tired and hungry, in Ushguli; such an operation is reserved for
special festivals and involves the whole community. But visits to Ushguli
are rare, and guests honoured there. Shortly after we were taken into the
warm kitchen of Kolia's solid, stone-built house, his daughter disappeared
out the back door with a long knife and a large tub of boiling water.
The terrific, high-pitched squealing that broke out a minute later ended in
a sudden, ominous silence; before long, a good-sized baby pig, its skin
scalded of bristles and its throat sewn-up neatly with thread, was baking in
a cast-iron stove that was stoked until it glowed red.
Suckling pig, wild mushrooms fried with mountain herbs; a fresh,
mint-sprinkled, mozzarella-like cheese swimming in a bowl of warm milk;
various pork organs simmering in a hot pepper stew; newly-baked bread with
yet more cheese cooked and melted inside - this is only some of the fare
that appeared on the table when, along with Kolia's brothers, cousins,
father, uncle and friends, we sat down to dine.
I remember discussing mountain trout-fishing with Kolia's cousin, and wild
goat-hunting with his father. But at this point my recollection of the
conversation, and the meal itself, grows somewhat hazy.
By the time the second bottle of vodka had been opened and we had toasted St
George, patron saint of both Georgia and England, I was feeling elated and
ready to give up life in the West, marry Kolia's red-cheeked daughter, and
settle down in Ushguli.
After we had finished the fourth bottle and elaborated numerous toasts to
international friendship, I realised what I was up against - not only
eaters, but also drinkers of epic stature. A permanent life in Ushguli, I
saw, might prove strenuous.
Some time after the fifth bottle of vodka, when we had moved on to toasting
our genes and future generations and were beginning to limber-up our voices
for a little counterpoint, I had to admit I was no match for the Georgians,
and conceded.
Stumbling upstairs and falling into bed, I found myself thinking of the five
lusty octogenarians singing in that little Tbilisi restaurant. How, if this
was the kind of life they had led one decade after another, had those
elderly gentlemen survived so long? Was it possible to over-eat, over-drink
and over-smoke oneself into vigorous old age?
The secrets of Georgian longevity have yet to be revealed, and more
investigation is needed. But given the boundless nature of Georgian
hospitality and the pleasures of the table there, there can be no lack of
researchers. Having barely recovered from my first bout of inquiries, I
drifted off in happy contemplation of further intensive study just a short
night and a sunrise away.

IRANIAN CUISINE: HEARTY, HUNKY, FLUFFY AND SUBLIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone unfamiliar with the meaty kebabs, hearty stews and honeyed desserts of 
Iranian food is in for a treat. It's a cuisine for the very hungry, where large 
hunks of meat run into mountains of fluffy rice, but it's also a cuisine for 
the sensualist, with fragrant herbs, pickles that bite and the exotic perfume 
of fruits and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's Iranian restaurants are surprisingly good, and incidentally 
surprisingly cheap. Dekadeh, a mini-mall pink palace in the city of Orange, 
provides a good introduction to this food. 
</P>
<P>
The name means "small village" in Farsi and the decor is quite simple. About 
the only bit of atmosphere comes from a few framed color prints depicting 
nomadic life on the rocky, parched landscape of southern Iran. (From a 
distance, they look like covers of Louis L'Amour westerns.) 
</P>
<P>
Lunch is the best time to come here for a first visit. That's when the 
restaurant serves one of the most generous buffets in the entire county, 
encompassing more than half of the restaurant's menu. Uniformed waiters lift 
the metal covers off the steam trays as you pass through the line, announcing 
the dishes proudly by their Farsi language names. 
</P>
<P>
The one familiar course is a salad of coarsely sliced cucumber, tomato and 
iceberg lettuce, and it might seem the logical place to begin. But make sure to 
leave the house dressing off. It tastes like what you get in plastic sacks on 
airlines, and it will dampen your appetite for the adventures that wait. 
</P>
<P>
And they really are adventures. First you come to a few stews: gheymeh, 
flavored with yellow split peas and a spicy tomato puree, and fesenjan, with 
mashed walnut and a pomegranate sauce. The gheymeh, made with veal, is 
delicious and not at all sour as it can often be. But the fesenjan is a real 
star, the deep crimson sweet and sour sauce marrying perfectly with boiled 
chicken. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are wonderful kebabs, slowly marinated meats served off the skewer 
such as chicken or beef chunks or small lamb loin chops, tender enough to cut 
with a fork. Eat these with any one of the three rice dishes the restaurant 
serves: the green bean and stewed tomato rice called lubia polo, baghala polo 
with its chopped dill and lima bean flavoring, or the tart, exotic barberry and 
saffron rice, zereshk polo. 
</P>
<P>
There's also fluffy pita bread, fresh raw onion (to chew on boldly between 
mouthfuls of kebab) and some well-crafted pistachio baklava (which is not 
included in the buffet price). This buffet covers most of the menu, the only 
significant missing parties being a shish kebab where tomatoes alternate with 
chunks of meat and some traditional side dishes such as the sharp vinegar 
pickles called torshi and a side dish/appetizer called kashk bademjan, which is 
sliced eggplant topped with baked yogurt. For those, you have to come back at 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Dekadeh is inexpensive. Its regal lunch buffet is only $7.95, and nothing on 
the dinner menu is over $9.95. 
</P>
<P>
The Tea Room -- a large, slightly garish dining room overlooking the Newport 
Beach Public Golf Course -- was a French restaurant for a while but is back in 
the hands of former owner Hussein Zahidi, and as a result several Persian 
favorites have crept back onto its small but self-assured menu. 
</P>
<P>
You could begin with one or two of the menu appetizers, such as the greasy 
onion rings or the flavorless, over-battered popcorn shrimp. You could begin to 
doubt the good things you've heard about Iranian restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
So get right into the meaty kebabs: plump, juicy chicken kebab, the filet 
mignon kebab barg or kubideh, a ground beef kebab that looks like a foot-long 
hamburger. All these grilled meats are served with the mandatory mound of rice, 
and the servers automatically bring sumac, a tart, purple-brown Persian 
flavoring (it's the dried berries of the sumac plant) to sprinkle over them. 
These kebabs are the real article, nicely marinated and perfectly broiled over 
a flame. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the menu is non-Iranian: a first-rate prime rib, mesquite-broiled 
salmon with a nice cream sauce, even chicken Marsala. Friday and Saturday 
evenings there are several Persian dishes on the menu that don't appear during 
the week -- eggplant puree and stuffed grape leaves to name two -- and after 10 
p.m., Iranians make up a higher proportion of the clientele. 
</P>
<P>
This restaurant serves a buffet lunch, too. It is best described as 
international, but you will find some Persian dishes on it. Dishes range from 
chicken enchiladas to kebabs and stews, and there are always at least six mixed 
salads to choose from. At $4.95, it is a phenomenal value. 
</P>
<P>
The Tea Room is inexpensive, and an excellent value at dinner. Appetizers are 
$2.95 to $6.95. Complete dinners are $6.95 to $9.95.

<DESCRIPT>  FOOD; RECIPE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  CAUTION: The holiday season can be -- or make that will be -- a dietary
hazard.;   With the onslaught of turkey and glazed ham, holidays play havoc
with good intentions so many of us have in mind. Cutting back on meat
consumption (and its quota of fat) becomes next to impossible.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Vegetarian  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The vegetarian menu that follows is designed for when you feel as though
you've reached the meat eater's limit.;   The centerpiece is acorn squash
baked then filled with a mixture of couscous, vegetables, garbanzo beans and
dried fruit. Light and tasty, it offers a complete protein source.;   Many
salad possibilities balance the meal. You might select your favorite tossed
green salad. But wilted cabbage slaw is a fine option that is easy to make and
can be done ahead of time.;   For dessert, an old-fashioned steamed pudding
made from persimmons is clearly an indulgence. Or try a simple fruit compote
for a low-fat alternative.; SQUASH STUFFED WITH; COUSCOUS; 2 acorn squash; 2
dried ancho chilies, see note; 1 cup couscous; 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons
water; 1 bunch cilantro stems; 1 slice fresh ginger; 1 teaspoon cumin seeds;
1/2 teaspoon salt; 1 16-ounce can garbanzo beans, drained; 1/2 of a small tart
apple, unpeeled, finely diced; 1/2 small red bell pepper, finely diced; 4
green onions, thinly sliced; 1/4 cup dried apricots, finely chopped; 1/4 cup
chopped cilantro leaves; 2 tablespoons olive oil; 1 tablespoon fresh lemon
juice; 1 hot chili pepper, such as jalapeno, seeded if desired, minced; Salt,
pepper to taste;  Heat oven to 350 degrees. Cut squash in half crosswise and
scoop out all the seeds and stringy membrane. Add 1 inch of water to a 13- by
9-inch baking dish; crumble one ancho chili into the water. Put squash in pan,
cut side down. Bake until tender, 50 to 60 minutes, depending on size. Or, to
cook in a microwave oven, prepare as above, using a microwave-safe dish. Cover
tightly with plastic wrap and cook on high power until tender, about 15 to 18
minutes.;   Meanwhile, put couscous in a medium bowl and set aside. Heat 3/4
cup plus 2 tablespoons water, 1 ancho chili, cilantro stems, ginger, cumin and
salt to a boil in small saucepan; boil rapidly for 2 minutes. Pour through a
strainer over the couscous. Stir with a fork, cover tightly with plastic wrap
and let stand 10 minutes. Remove cover and separate grains with a fork.;  
Stir in remaining ingredients, including salt and pepper to taste.;  
Carefully trim a slice from the stem ends of the baked squash so they will
stand flat; divide couscous mixture among squash halves. Put trimmed stems of
squash over to make a cover. Return to oven and bake until heated through,
about 20 minutes. Or, place in microwave dish and cook on high power, loosely
covered, until hot, about 6 minutes. Makes 4 servings. Preparation time, 20
minutes; cooking time, 1 hour, 20 minutes;   Note: Dried ancho chilies are
available at Hispanic markets.; (hbox); WILTED CABBAGE SLAW; WITH ORANGE
SESAME; DRESSING; 1 small head green cabbage, about 1 1/4 pounds, thinly
sliced; 4 green onions, slivered; 1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro or parsley;
1/3 cup vegetable oil; 3 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar or rice vinegar; 1
tablespoon honey mustard; 2 teaspoons sesame seeds; 1/2 teaspoon mustard
seeds; 1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste; Grated rind of 1 orange; 2 to 3
tablespoons orange juice; Red cabbage leaves or red leaf lettuce for serving; 
Mix cabbage, onions and cilantro in a bowl; set aside.;   Whisk oil, vinegar,
honey mustard, sesame and mustard seeds and salt together in a small pan. Heat
gently until the seeds begin to brown. Remove from the heat, add orange rind
and juice. Pour over cabbage mixture. Toss well. Salad can be served
immediately or covered tightly and refrigerated overnight. Toss well and
adjust the seasoning before serving on cabbage or lettuce leaves. Makes 4
servings. Preparation time, 10 minutes; cooking time, 3 minutes.; (hbox);
STEAMED PERSIMMON; PUDDING WITH DRIED; CRANBERRIES; 1/2 cup dried cranberries
or dried currants; 2 tablespoons dark rum; 1/2 cup finely ground butter cookie
crumbs (such as shortbread); 1/2 cup all-purpose flour; 1 1/2 teaspoons baking
soda; 1/2 teaspoon each: cinnamon, salt; Freshly grated nutmeg; 1 cup sugar;
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened; 2 large eggs; 1 1/4 cups
persimmon pulp, see note; 1 tablespoon lemon juice; 1 cup chopped pecans;
Whipped cream;  Mix dried fruit and rum in a small plastic bag. Set aside for
several hours or overnight.;   Mix cookie crumbs, flour, baking soda,
cinnamon, salt and nutmeg in a bowl and set aside.;   Cream sugar and butter
with an electric mixer until light. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after
each addition. Add persimmon pulp and lemon juice and mix well. Add dry
ingredients and mix lightly; fold in pecans and soaked fruit with liquid.;  
Transfer to a buttered mold with a 6-cup capacity. A ring mold, pudding mold
or kugelhopf pan can be used. Cover tightly with foil, making sure that no
water will be able to get inside the mold. Secure in place with twine or a
heavy rubber band.;   Select a pot large enough to hold the mold and place a
steamer rack in the bottom. Pour in several inches of water then put the
pudding mold on the steamer rack. Cover the pan and heat to a boil. Reduce
heat and simmer gently 1 3/4 hours. Check periodically to make sure there is
water in the bottom of the pan.;   Carefully remove the mold from the pan.
Blot any water from the top of the foil then carefully remove the foil. Cool
in the mold for 10 minutes then invert onto a serving platter. Serve warm with
a dollop of whipped cream. Serves 10. Preparation time, 20 minutes; standing
time, several hours or overnight; cooking time, 1 1/2 hours.;   Note: Select
very ripe persimmons. Remove the stem end and scoop out the soft flesh from
inside the fruit. Mash with a fork or puree in a food processor.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  FOOD; PRODUCT; BUDGET; PLANNING  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  IN California, where we worship the Goddess of Fresh, the idea of eating
canned food may seem as sacrilegious as conducting high mass during a roller
derby match. But who doesn't come home from the supermarket without at least a
few canned goods in his environmentally correct canvas bag?;    More than 17
billion cans of food are produced in the United States each year, accounting
for 12 percent of grocery sales nationwide.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Our favorites? In order of preference, they are soup, tuna, pasta, pork and
beans, corn, green beans, tomatoes, evaporated condensed milk, tomato sauce
and peaches, according to a survey by Selling Areas Marketing Inc. (SAMI).;   
Despite its popularity, canned food has traditionally gotten a bad rap for
nutrition when compared to fresh and frozen food.;    "That's because older
studies compared canned vegetables with produce that was just picked," says
Anne-Marie Farley of the Canned Information Council, "but when both were
analyzed after they had been cooked for consumption, the nutritional content
was comparable.";    Here are my 15 favorite canned foods and suggestions on
how to use them.;    (check) BEANS -- Canned beans can be just as effective as
dried beans at reducing cholesterol, but you don't have to wait hours while
they soak. Simply rinse off the surface starch and unnecessary salt that comes
with most canned beans.;    Chick peas are one of my favorites. Puree them
with sesame paste (tahini), garlic and lemon juice for hummus, the Middle
Eastern dip. Mix them with cannellini beans, scallions, parsley, lemon juice
and olive oil for a delicious bean salad that can be fortified with a topping
tuna for a main course. Or just sprinkle them on salads.;    Black beans make
a delicious Southwestern dip when pureed with minced canned jalapeno peppers,
ground cumin, chili powder, garlic and scallions. Make a quick bean soup with
canned chicken broth, crushed rosemary and canned lima beans in ham sauce (or
use plain lima beans and add bacon). Your signature chili with canned red
kidney or pinto beans is a snap with the addition of ground beef, onion,
garlic, tomatoes and that secret blend of spices.;    (check) TOMATOES -- Try
sauces from canned tomatoes with mussels and hot pepper over linguine; with
mushrooms and ground beef or turkey over fusilli; with sweet peppers and hot
Italian sausage on rigatoni; or with garlic and onion sauteed in olive oil
with a splash of red wine.;    Putting whole tomatoes through a food mill
eliminates the arduous task of removing seeds by hand and creates a
fresh-tasting puree that needs little or no thickening. Though plum tomatoes
are often thought to be best for sauces, many non-plum varieties are just as
good.;    Canned tomatoes are indispensible for soups and stews. Make a quick
winter gazpacho with canned tomatoes, canned diced green chilies, spicy V-8
juice and canned corn.;    (check) TOMATO and V-8 JUICES -- Jazz up either one
with Tabasco, Worcestershire sauce and horseradish for a delicious
non-alcoholic cocktail. Or just buy spicy V-8 and save yourself the trouble.
Both are good at stretching soups like gazpacho and as braising liquids in
lieu of stock or water. My wife's favorite low-cal dish is a stew of
vegetables in V-8 juice.;    (check) PEACHES -- Use them in cobblers, in
sauces for pork or chicken, in a baked fruit compote with a topping of
amaretti cookies, or in your own canned fruit salad (see recipe). They can be
combined with vanilla ice cream and pureed frozen raspberries for a quick
peach Melba or made into this no-fail dessert from "Super Meals from
Supermarkets" by Joe Famularo (Barron's, $12.95): Simmer 1/2 cup each of dark
rum and dark brown sugar in a pan until sugar dissolves. Drain a 29-ounce can
of sliced peaches and toss with the juice of one lemon in a bowl. Pour rum
sauce over and toss well. Serve in goblets topped with whipped cream and
nutmeg.;    (check) CORN -- Comparable to frozen and superior to out-of-season
fresh, canned corn makes a fine corn salad with pimentos, scallions and cumin.
I prefer to make my own succotash with frozen lima beans, bacon bits and fresh
chives. Also try it with okra, chopped tomatoes, scallions and green peppers
for an interesting side vegetable.;    Creamed corn is a favorite comfort food
that gives wonderful texture to cornbread made with a mix. It can be added to
canned New England clam chowder and sherry for a hearty soup. And corn pudding
is an easy affair when mixed with flour, baking soda, eggs and cream.;   
(check) ARTICHOKE HEARTS -- Buy the whole hearts in water rather than the
wedges marinated in oil, for greater versatility and calorie control. For
pizza and pasta toppings, they can't be beat. Natural partners include
prosciutto, olives, thyme, garlic, olive oil and pimentos or fresh-roasted red
bell peppers.;    Add some artichoke hearts to sauteed chicken breasts and
olives, then top with some grated Parmesan cheese and bake. Or make a quick
artichoke soup with some canned chicken stock and cream.;    (check) CLAMS --
When I can't think of what to eat for dinner that's quick and satisfying,
linguine with clam sauce often comes to mind. The only other ingredients you
need are garlic, olive oil, white wine and parsley. Use coarsely chopped clams
for pasta, minced clams with cream cheese for clam dip or sandwich spread and
whole clams for an easy paella (see recipe). Whole clams can also be the basis
for your own clam chowder or they can add punch to canned clam chowder.;   
(check) BEETS -- It's hard to justify the trouble of cooking fresh beets when
canned beets are so consistently good. I use pickled beets as part of an
antipasto platter for an easy cold meal on hot days. Plain canned beets are
the main ingredient of chlodnik, a refreshing cold soup with capers,
cucumbers, pickles, dill and sour cream. Add beets to salads, combine them
with minced onions for their own salad, or serve them as a hot vegetable
microwaved with orange juice, orange zest and sugar.;    (check) PUMPKIN PUREE
-- I defy you to tell the difference between fresh and canned pumpkin when
baked in a pie. But don't limit pumpkin puree to pie. A while back, I made a
delicious creme brulee with canned puree, eggs, cream and spices.;    Go
beyond desserts to use pumpkin puree in a soup with canned chicken stock,
cream and a dash of nutmeg. Add some pumpkin puree to a spoon bread recipe.;  
 (check) OLIVES -- Though I prefer the deeper flavors of cured olives, canned
ripe olives can be used in so many dishes, it's hard to keep them off the
list. Use them in tomato sauces for pasta and in pasta salads. Slice or
coarsely chop them for pizza and nachos. Mix them with cream cheese for
sandwich spreads or wrap them in thin slices of salami for hors d'oeuvres
coronets.;    Colossal olives can be stuffed with a horseradish cream for easy
hors d'oeuvres. Or they can be marinated as a condiment for submarine
sandwiches. Drain two cans of colossal olives. Mix 1/2 cup olive oil, 2
tablespoons red wine vinegar, 1 teaspoon dried thyme and 4 cloves peeled
garlic that have been crushed but left whole. Add the olives and allow to
marinate several hours or longer. Taste and remove the garlic when the flavor
suites you.;    (check) EVAPORATED OR CONDENSED MILK -- Evaporated milk is a
very good substitute for cream in many recipes and far less caloric. An old
favorite recipe involves breaded pork chops sauteed in a skillet until crisp
and almost done. Add evaporated milk and reduce to a thickened sauce. Serve
with garlic mashed potatoes that have also been made with evaporated milk.;   
Evaporated milk whips up like cream if it's well chilled. And it can be
reconstituted simply by adding water.;    Sweetened condensed milk is a key
ingredient in key lime pie (see recipe on 2C) and other desserts such as
cheesecake and rice pudding.;    (check) ANCHOVIES -- Anchovies are flavor
enhancers for more than Caesar salad. They add a subtle complexity to tomato
sauces for pasta, especially if gently sauteed with garlic in olive oil first.
Combined with garlic, olive oil and cream, they make a great dipping sauce
called bagna cauda for vegetables. Flavor braised lamb or veal shanks with
anchovies too.;    Make anchovy butter for anchovy toast hors d'oeuvres. Toss
anchovy fillets with freshly roasted sweet red peppers, olive oil and a touch
of garlic for an appetizer. And for a kinder, gentler flavor on pizzas, cut
them in bits and spread them underneath the tomato sauce before baking.;   
(check) CHICKEN BROTH -- Though I make my own, I'm never without a few cans.
In soups and stews you can hardly tell the difference from homemade. Use a
little chicken broth to deglaze the pan after you've sauteed some chicken,
veal or turkey breasts. If fats are a problem in your diet, "saute" onions or
garlic in chicken broth instead of oil or butter.;    Reduced sodium broths
are available for those on sodium-restricted diets. Be sure to remove the fat
before you use canned broth. Put the can in the freezer for 20 minutes to
allow the fat to rise to the top. Then skim it off.;    (check) PINEAPPLE --
Heat crushed pineapple pieces with some rum and brown sugar for a pound cake
or ice cream topping. Or combine crushed pineapple with pecans in a sweet
potato casserole.;    Use pineapple chunks in sweet and sour sauces for
chicken or pork. Drain chunks for fruit salads or eat the chunks by themselves
as a breakfast fruit. Pineapple rings can be used in an old-fashioned
upside-down cake.;    (check) CAPONATA -- As a kid, I used to eat this
"eggplant appetizer," as it is also called, right out of the can for a snack.
Made by Progresso, it's an Italian ratatouille. Use on antipasto platters or
as an appetizer with a topping of tuna.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  HOLIDAY; FOOD; RECIPE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  THANKSGIVING is a day to pay homage to the earth's bounty.;   For early
Americans, it was a day to humbly give thanks for the generosity of the summer
harvest, conferring reverence to the hard work spent preparing for the cold
months ahead. I've always been interested in how the settlers and the Indians
prepared for winter.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  GIVING THANKS FOR FALL'S BOUNTY  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Additional information attached to the end of this article. Produce; Chef
Jesse Cool is owner/creator of Flea St. Cafe in Menlo Park.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     In the spring and summer, they ate food from their gardens or nuts and
berries from the forests. They paid careful attention to preserving whatever
they could.;   Squash, potatoes, pears, apples and persimmons were carefully
secured in cold storage with the hope that there would be enough to last the
winter. Grains were dried whole or ground into flour.;   Root vegetables were
harvested until the earth froze. Then they were canned or stored. All this
completed, it was time to give thanks, eat what was available, and pray for an
early spring.;   This day epitomizes my feeling about honoring the seasonality
of fresh produce.;   While, unlike the early settlers, we won't starve if we
don't prepare for the winter, we still must do so. We're lucky this year
because summer lingered longer than usual.;   At the same time, fall crops
such as brussels spouts, quince and persimmons are abundant. For many people,
they are the stuff of traditional Thanksgiving dishes.;   Suggest organic;  
As usual, I recommend using organically grown produce. Brussels sprouts rank
high on the list of produce that is heavily sprayed.;   Some people wince when
they hear talk of brussels sprouts. Maybe this a partly because they've been
treated badly by generations of cooks. See my tips for advice.;   Brussels
sprouts can be eaten in any size, but they are best about the size of a silver
dollar. Both green and purple brussels sprouts are available in markets.
Although the purple are interesting-looking, I don't detect much difference in
flavor.;   You can purchase them on the stalk or in baskets. To prepare, cut
them off the stalk, trim a bit of the bottom off and make an "X" in the stem
to help with cooking.;   Avoid raw quince;   If you've ever eaten raw quince,
it made you wince.;   Quince is not at its best when eaten that way. When it
is cooked, it turns pink and has a delicious fragrance and flavor. Use your
favorite apple pie recipe and add sliced quince, but increase the amount of
sugar a bit.;   Persimmons are an often overlooked fall fruit. Primarily grown
here in California, they are not only beautiful, hanging like little lanterns
from naked tree branches, but they are a versatile delicacy.;   Fuyus, the
squat, round-shaped variety, are fine to eat raw. Or peel and substitute in
any apple recipe. At Flea St. Cafe we use them in pies, fruit crisps and in
salads with bitter greens and pungent cheeses.;   The oval, nearly
heart-shaped Hachiyas or American Persimmons are astringent and tannic until
ripe. They are best when the flesh is very soft and full of natural sugar.
They are commonly used in steamed puddings or spiced fruit breads.;   Now that
you've got some of fall's bounty in mind for the Thanksgiving feast, let's
talk about how to make the day less stressful.;   If you don't want to fuss
with a turkey or are a vegetarian who loves stuffing, fill partially cooked,
seeded winter squash with your favorite stuffing and serve as an entree or
side dish.;   Spread the workload;   Don't stress out trying to do too much.
Let guests bring a dish to contribute or keep your menu very simple. If all
you can accomplish is to create one recipe from scratch, acknowledge that and
feel good about it.;   With all this in mind, I'd also encourage you to
discuss the relationship between the settlers and the American Indians over
dinner.;   Moreover, this would be a perfect time and place to teach our
children that there is more to Thanksgiving than turkey and mashed potatoes.
More than many cultures today, American Indians continue to worship Mother
Earth for her favors that physically and spiritually feed us.;   This recipe
remains a traditional dessert at the All Hallows Thanksgiving Dinner, a
traditional pilgrim-style dinner held in Maryland. It is derived from The
Maryland's Way Cookbook. Get through the mindset that mashed potatoes can't be
sweet and you are in for a treat that originated in England and was brought to
this country by the original Pilgrims.; MARYLAND THANKSGIVING; WHITE POTATO
PIE; 1 pound baking potatoes; 2/3 cup butter; 1 cup sugar; 1 teaspoon salt;
1/2 cup heavy cream; 1/2 cup milk; 1/2 teaspoon baking powder; Juice of one
lemon; Zest of one lemon; 1/2 teaspoon fresh grated nutmeg; 1 1/2  teaspoon
vanilla; 4 eggs, beaten; 1 unbaked 8-inch pie crust;  Peel, cook and mash
potatoes. Add butter and after it has melted from the heat of the potatoes,
combine thoroughly. Whisk together sugar, salt, cream, milk and baking powder.
Add to potatoes with lemon juice, zest, nutmeg and vanilla, and beaten eggs.
Mix well.;   Fill pie shell with potato batter. Bake at 375 degrees until firm
and brown, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Serve with rum-scented whipped cream.; Don't
overcook brussels sprouts. Braise them in chicken stock or water until tender,
finish simply with garlic butter and a sprinkling of fresh chives and toasted
almonds and encourage people to try just one.; (box) Another alternative for
quince is to peel, slice, and preserve it in honey. This is delicious served
as a condiment with wild game or roast pork.; (box) Gardening expert Ros
Creasy recommends freezing and serving persimmons whole, peeling back the skin
and spooning out the flesh. Think of it as a low-calorie, intense sorbet.  </TEXT>

SAYING YES TO PERSIAN FOOD AT GLENDALE'S YAAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Once meat and potatoes, Glendale is now full of small, colorful ethnic 
restaurants -- places where you can sample the world's cuisines at suburban 
prices. Yaas Restaurant stands near the head of the list; it's one of the most 
authentic Persian kitchens around. Many of the dishes here compare favorably 
with similar ones served in Westwood, where the Farsi-speaking community is 
concentrated. Prices do too. 
</P>
<P>
Yaas (it means jasmine) bills itself as a Persian-Armenian dining room. On a 
quiet downtown street, it looks more like a ski lodge than a restaurant. The 
walls are paneled in stained wood, with plenty of disco-style mirrors hanging 
on them. But look more closely, and you notice that a dark Persian rug hangs on 
a back wall. Listen more carefully, and you hear mysterious music emanating 
faintly from speakers. In Glendale, exoticism is understated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
American Heart Assn. 
</P>
<P>
But what comes out of this kitchen certainly is not. Owner Madhu Gandhi's menu 
offers most of the traditional Persian favorites. Yet unlike many of those 
Persian restaurants in West L.A., several dishes are marked with hearts, 
indicating that they have been approved by the American Heart Assn. This is 
accomplished because Gandhi trims his meats religiously, using little oil in 
preparation. Much of his food is light and lean. 
</P>
<P>
The dishes that aren't marked with hearts are divinely heavy. In the best 
Persian tradition, these dishes are full of nuts, oils and the bounty of the 
region they represent. And despite the raised health consciousness of the 
management, they are the better dishes in the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Best of all is kashk budemjoon ($4.99), fried Japanese eggplant dripping with 
kashk, a fragrant, thickened yogurt. Atop the kashk is minced garlic, a crunchy 
fried spice topping made from dill, cilantro and plenty of olive oil. You dip 
the eggplants into the wonderful, piping hot, sesame-topped house bread, and 
sprinkle the whole thing with chopped fresh onion. If there is a more 
soul-satisfying appetizer in town I don't know about it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exotic Yogurt 
</P>
<P>
Other starters are good too. Dolmeh ($3.89), stuffed grape leaves, are more 
familiar to most, but these are dolmeh with a twist. Besides being far meatier 
than those in Greek or Lebanese restaurants, they are topped with garlic 
yogurt. Yogurt fanciers will be pleased to note that there are mint and shallot 
yogurts on the appetizer list. Just try to find those in your dairy case. 
</P>
<P>
The extensive kabob list is the heart of this menu, and probably what most 
people come for. I found the kabobs rather hit and miss. Barg ($8.99), a fillet 
steak in thin strips, had very little flavor, despite being lean and tender. 
Other Persian restaurants must use more marinade, or tastier meat. Ditto for 
the koobideh ($5.95), a long, tubular skewer of ordinary ground beef, which 
tasted Middle Western, rather than Middle Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, lamb chop kabobs ($11.95) were wonderful, meaty, juicy and 
flavored just right, with the meat falling from the bone. Shrimp kabobs 
($11.99) were equally fine, eight large, slightly blackened shrimp, with a 
pungent lemon-garlic butter as an inspired compliment. 
</P>
<P>
Good kabobs notwithstanding, I would say the stews and specialty dishes here 
make more pleasing main courses. They are homey and comforting, big enough to 
share, and more interesting. My favorite of these is fasenjoon ($7.99), chicken 
floating in an impossibly rich sauce made from walnuts, pomegranates and stock. 
The sauce is sweet and grainy, the texture of pipian (a Mexican sauce made from 
pumpkin seed). A few bites of it are enough to make anyone swoon. How one 
person is expected to eat the whole thing is anyone's best guess. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly lighter (but also plenty filling) is bagali pulo ($6.99), lamb shank 
in tomato stock with a lima bean rice overwhelmed by a mountainous heap of 
chopped dill. I'd personally choose the chicken cherry ($7.99), known in Farsi 
as albaloo pulo. Yaas' version is a tasty rice reddened by the juice of sour 
cherries that aren't really sour, flanked by an excellent flame-broiled chicken 
kabob. The chicken kabob itself is not on the menu, but is the best kabob the 
restaurant serves, tender, juicy and pleasantly spiced. The mild pungency of 
the rice balances it well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coffee and Dessert 
</P>
<P>
Try to save a little room for those sticky desserts. Persian ice cream ($2.65) 
is perfumed and creamy, loaded with pistachios and the scent of rose water. The 
Heart Assn. wouldn't come within miles of it. I like zoolbiah ($2.45), swirling 
rings of floured batter that are deep fried and drenched in honey; they remind 
me of the Tunisian pastry shops in Paris. And there is always that thick, 
sweet, muddy coffee, called Armenian coffee on the menu. I wondered why Yaas 
billed itself as a Persian-Armenian restaurant. I guess it must be the coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes; kashk budemjoon, $4.99; aashreshteh, $2.99; lamb chop 
kabobs, $11.99; shrimp kabobs, $11.99; fasenjoon, $7.99; chicken cherry, $7.99.

MEAL IN DISH FROM PUERTO VALLARTA; 
</P>
<P>
EMISSARY: BEA BENDER'S ARRIVAL IN THE RESORT COMMUNITY BENEFITED MEXICAN AS 
WELL AS AMERICAN MENUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 20 years ago, an American woman named Bea Bender moved to Puerto Vallarta 
and began to explore the local cuisine. As years passed, Bender became an 
expert in preparing traditional Mexican food and also in adapting the available 
ingredients to American favorites. The result was a weekly cookery column, "Out 
of Bea's Kitchen . . . With Love," that appeared in the English language 
newspaper, Vallarta Today, starting in November, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Bender's recipes ranged from carne asada, nopales salad and guacamole to 
American-style tomato spice cake with cream cheese frosting. In between were 
such cross-cultural dishes as shark bisque, mango bread and tacos filled with 
chicken salad. 
</P>
<P>
When Bender arrived in Vallarta, meals were based largely on seafood and on 
dishes that did not require refrigeration. Local meats were tough, and 
convenience foods were unknown. Not until the early 1980s was whipping cream 
available. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was made from scratch, like cakes, mayonnaise, yogurt, biscuits, or 
brought by northern friends and guests from a long-running want list of 
stateside goodies," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Born in New York City, Bender and her husband, Bernie, lived for many years in 
Van Nuys before moving to Mexico. In Puerto Vallarta, their son, Michael, 
opened the town's first modern, air-conditioned meat market with refrigeration. 
This was the Super Carniceria "Chico's," a place where expatriates could get 
American cuts of beef, and turkeys for Thanksgiving. Bernie Bender, a retired 
dentist, helped out in the market, and Bea provided recipes for the customers 
and cooked batches of deli-style foods. 
</P>
<P>
"My culinary reputation grew rapidly as I found myself preparing kilos of 
granola, sauerkraut, corned beef, mango chutney, sour dill pickles and yogurt 
to service the meat market," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The limited refrigeration, water and electric power shortages of early-day 
Vallarta led to the popularity there of a type of dish called tinga, which 
Bender defined as "a meal-in-a-dish stew." 
</P>
<P>
The following menu centers around Bender's festive chicken tinga, Pollo de la 
Patria. Carrots, chayote, green beans and green pepper go into the pot along 
with the chicken. Almonds, raisins and capers add to the rich flavor, and the 
seasonings include orange juice, saffron, cinnamon and cloves. Baked Cumin 
Rice, a recipe from Bender's column, goes with the chicken. 
</P>
<P>
An appetizer plate, a chilled soup and a chutney show off the fruits and 
vegetables that are so well-liked in Mexico. The appetizer plate combines 
orange and cucumber slices, pickled onions and marinated poblano chiles. The 
soup contains cantaloupe and grapes, and the chutney is made with mangoes. 
</P>
<P>
For dessert, Bender suggested a walnut torte drenched with a combination of 
melted butter and honey. 
</P>

THANKSGIVING; 
</P>
<P>
THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO STUFF A TURKEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN RAICHLEN, Raichlen is a Boston cooking school teacher and food 
writer. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Next Thursday, eight out of 10 Americans will sit down to a turkey dinner. To 
supply the demand, 45 million birds will meet their maker in the weeks leading 
up to Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
Our national bird might well have been the turkey. Benjamin Franklin thought it 
"a much more respectable bird, and withall a true original native of America." 
The bird was already domesticated when the Spanish reached Mexico in 1518. The 
Aztecs ate it with a sauce made from chiles and unsweetened chocolate. (The 
preparation survives in the Mexican dish mole poblano.) Europeans, usually 
finicky about New World foods, adopted the bird with gusto: A 16th-Century 
German cookbook listed 20 turkey recipes. 
</P>
<P>
One of the problems with turkey is that it's a party animal. You need at least 
10 people to eat a small one. If you have a smaller group, you might want to 
serve a game bird, such as partridge, pheasant and quail. They are loaded with 
flavor and perfect for celebrating Thanksgiving when you have only four to six 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
Game birds include, in descending order of size, wild turkey, goose, duck, 
pheasant, partridge, grouse, squab, dove, thrush (the alouette of the French 
children's song) and, the most delicious of them all, woodcock. Game is leaner 
than chicken or duck, which makes it a boon with dieters. Prone to drying out, 
it does best with a moist cooking method, like stewing or braising. Another way 
to keep game birds moist is by wrapping them in bacon or other fat. 
</P>
<P>
Game used to be available only to hunters, but more and more of it can be found 
at specialty markets and butcher shops. True wild game has the richer (and in 
many cases, muskier) game flavor. The pen-raised birds, on the other hand, are 
free of such inconveniences as feathers and wayward buckshot. Game farms have 
proliferated around the United States; many sell their wares by mail order. 
</P>
<P>
Looking for something different for this Thanksgiving? Here are some offbeat 
ways to prepare turkey and some game bird recipes for serving small crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 In pre-Columbian times, chocolate was consumed as a spice, not a sweet. Its 
bitterness goes well with the pungency of chiles. This recipe comes from "The 
Complete Book of Mexican Cookery" by Elizabeth Lambert Ortiz (Bantam Books: 
1968).

 "When I devised this stuffing, I thought of all the things a quail would eat 
in the fall, or at least the things I wished it would eat," says Greg Parks, 
chef of the Four Columns Inn in Newfane, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
ROAST QUAIL WITH WILD RICE STUFFING 
</P>
<P>
8 quail, preferably fresh 
</P>
<P>
1 lemon 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
Stuffing 
</P>
<P>
Wash quail inside and out and dry with paper towels. Sprinkle few drops lemon 
juice, salt and pepper into cavity of each bird. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Fill each quail with Stuffing. Season birds with salt and pepper. Arrange quail 
in lightly oiled roasting pan, breast side up. Tie drumsticks of each bird 
together and baste skin with olive oil. Roast at 450 degrees about 20 minutes, 
or until cooked to taste. To test for doneness, insert slender skewer into 
cavity of bird -- it should feel very hot to the touch. (Parks likes to serve 
quail slightly pink.) Untie legs and serve quail at once. Makes 8 appetizer 
servings or 4 entree servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: This stuffing would also be good in Cornish game hens or guinea fowl. 
</P>
<P>

<DESCRIPT>  VEGETABLE; FRUIT; RECIPE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  THE BOUNTY of late summer is ours to enjoy.;   Impressive displays of locally
grown prime vegetables and fruits still can be found in most produce stands --
gorgeous tomatoes, crisp crimson plums, succulent red and golden raspberries,
glorious grapes and juicy summer melons.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  CHILIES AND PEPPERS AND PEARS, OH MY!  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Seasonal Produce; See also related article on page 4D of this section.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     But there are new kids on the block -- pears, chilies and bell peppers.;  
(check) PEARS -- Many pears are picked before they ripen because they are
delicate and bruise easily. Because their flavors develop over time, pears
keep well in cold, dark storage -- although not necessarily a refrigerator.
Some of the heartier varieties can even be stored until early spring.;   Among
those that store well are the mild, white-fleshed Anjou pears. Their delicate
flavors actually come through better after two months in storage.;   Red or
green with amber spots, juicy sweet-fleshed Bartletts are also better when
ripened off the tree. They are excellent for fresh pear pie.;   Succulent
French and Italian butter pears will be ready to eat sooner than most. They
have a delicate light flesh and light brown skin and are a perfect match for
provocative brie-like cheeses and spicy nuts.;   It also best to pick tiny
Seckel pears, one of my favorites, before they are ripe and let them develop
their natural juices. Although not always pretty, they are one of the sweetest
pears, with spicy, rich tropical aromas.;   Store light-green and
russet-skinned Comice pears if they aren't ripe when on the stands. With their
rich, juicy flesh, they are best eaten raw. Bosc pears, with tender, aromatic,
smooth white flesh and long gourd-like necks, are fine for eating, baking and
drying. They are ready to eat when the skin is russet brown.;   Asian pears
tend to have thin skins and can come in odd shapes. For those who like a pear
with apple-like crispness, try one of the many varieties found at specialty
produce stands.;   (check) CHILI PEPPERS -- While they may often resemble each
other, bell peppers are sweet and chilies give off some degree of heat. There
are some chilies that are not hot, and they tend to have a deep, peppery
flavor.;   Stop by any Mexican produce stand or the Santa Cruz Flea Market. At
both sites, you are likely to find a phenomenal range of unusual chilies.;  
Look for a new one (at least to me) called a chilaca. It has a shiny
green-black skin, long, thin, pointed body like a pasilla and a mild, musky
flesh with hints of pepper. It is delicious on thinly sliced bread soaked with
olive oil.;   The horn-shaped golden Corno di Toro and the spherical tiny
cherry pepper are good examples of chilies that embody a sweet yet peppery
flavor.;   Poblanos are dark green with broad shoulders, coming to a point at
the tip. They are mild, meaty and perfect for chili rellenos.;   On the spicy
side, commonly found jalapenos -- red, yellow or green -- have great flavor
and impart plenty of heat.;   The hottest pepper I have ever tasted is the
tiny red Thai chili. Tepins are as big as a fingernail, but they are extremely
hot. Cayennes are red, long and slightly wrinkled.;   Thais, tepins, and
cayennes do not have much flavor, but they do create heat. All three dry
well.;   (check) SWEET BELL PEPPERS -- Red, gold and green peppers are the
sweet-tempered lookalikes to chilies.;   California Wonders, with thick skin
and meaty flesh, are sold green. But when they are ripe, they are sold as a
sweet red, yellow or sometimes black bell pepper.;   New on the market are
Gypsy peppers, red bells with tinges of gold. They are thick-fleshed but very
sweet, and are excellent eaten fresh or roasted. Pimentos are meaty and
perfect for roasting. Look for a Chocolate Pimento, a dark-skinned bell, at
Whole Foods Market in Palo Alto or the Palo Alto Farmers' Market.;   The
golden bells I've tasted this year are superb. Use them in any recipe that
calls for red bells or combine them for a confetti-like effect. Albino bells,
with their shiny white skin and light flesh, are very sweet and great for
salads.;   One person who makes excellent use of bell peppers is Lolly Font of
Los Altos, yoga teacher, devoted Italian mother of five and good friend to
many. She's also known for her passion for roasted sweet peppers. She roasts
them everywhere: on her outdoor grill, her indoor gas grill, in the broiler or
right over the gas burner. Rather than using a paper bag to steam off the
skins and to save the juices for other recipes, she tosses them into a covered
pot until they cool.; LOLLY FONT'S FAMOUS; ITALIAN ROAST PEPPERS; 4 large
sweet peppers (red, gold, or white); 4 tablespoons olive oil; 2 teaspoons
sliced fresh garlic; Salt and fresh-ground black pepper; 4 teaspoons fresh
parsley, chopped; 2 teaspoons fresh oregano, chopped; 2 tablespoons fresh
basil chopped; 6 ounces whole milk mozzarella;  Roast, peel and seed peppers,
reserving any juices. Slice or tear each pepper into 4 or 5 large pieces and
place in four individual baking dishes. Drizzle on each 1 tablespoon of olive
oil, 1/2 teaspoon sliced garlic, roasted pepper juices and salt and pepper to
taste.;   Chop together parsley, oregano and basil. Toss equal amounts on each
casserole. Top each with 1 1/2 ounces sliced mozzarella. Warm under broiler
until cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown. Serve with crusty Italian bread
for sopping up the juice.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; This is Organically Grown
Week, a time when the people who produce organic foods for a living want us to
ponder the chemicals used to grow food and consider that it can be done
another, safer way. Hidden Villa Farm on Moody Road in the Los Altos Hills
will conduct a workshop called "Organic: Is it really better for you?" on
Saturday from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. A soup made of farm products will be
served. Admission is $10. Call (415) 949-8650.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  FALL; FRUIT  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  WHETHER it's a warm apple cobbler topped with vanilla ice cream, a satisfying
quince and fig compote or a crunchy cranberry crisp, there is something
soothing about fall fruit desserts.;   Summer fruit produces glossy tarts and
svelte sorbets. Autumn fruit desserts are more rustic as befits cooler weather
and heartier eating.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  COBBLERS AND COMPOTES AND CRISPS...OH, MY!
IT'S MIND-BOGGLING. JUST THINK OF ALL THOSE
COMFORTING DESSERTS YOU CAN MAKE FROM FALL FRUITS
THE COMFORTOF DESSERTS THAT CAN BE MADETHINGS FALL
FRUITS'TIS THE SEASON FOR FALL FRUITS THAT WARM US
IN DELICIOUS DESSERTS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  See also related article on page 4F of this section.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "It's the kind of food that really makes me happy," says Jesse Cool,
Mercury News produce columnist. "The world is so confusing and these desserts
bring us back to basics. They're also in tune with the simplicity of
American-style cooking.";   Simplicity is a real key for fall fruit desserts.
No need to worry about less-than-ethereal tart crusts, cakes that don't quite
look the way they do in food magazines or directions that vaguely resemble the
tax code. With fall fruit desserts, you can pretty much throw things together
and -- wham! bam! -- you've got something that will warm even the stoniest of
hearts.;   Here's a guide to many facets of fall fruit desserts.;   Cobblers; 
 Though you can make a cobbler with any kind of fruit, sturdy autumn fruits
are especially appropriate.;   "Summer fruit tends to break down in cobblers
giving you a mushy texture," Cool says, "but fall fruits hold their shape and
texture.";   Cobblers are essentially deep dish pies with sweet pastry or
biscuit crusts. Though they can have bottom crusts, they often don't. And that
makes them all the easier. Crusts can be a single layer of dough or made up of
individual biscuits, even scones. Serve them warm or at room temperature with
ice cream, whipped cream or creme fraiche.;   Compotes;   Generally defined as
cut-up fruit that has been slow-cooked in syrup and spices and chilled, the
compote has a dowdy image. But compotes can be elegant. At The Sherman House
in San Francisco, chef Donia Bijan's seasonal French menu includes cheesecake
topped with a compote of quince poached in Sauternes with vanilla and orange
peel.;   The addition of dried fruit gives compotes a contrast in texture. The
cooking syrup can contain any number of liquids from fruit juices to red
wine.;   And compotes don't have to be cold. They are even more satisfying
served warm or at room temperature with a splash of heavy cream and soft
oatmeal-raisin cookies or date bars. Eliminate the cream and you have a
relatively low-calorie dessert.;   Poached fruit;   A vastly underappreciated
method of preparing fruit desserts.;   "Poached apples or pears are just
wonderful," Bijan says. "Poaching and baking brings out the flavor more in
fall fruits than summer fruits.";   Unlike compotes, poached fruit is usually
served whole. As a result, the fruit, such as Bosc pears, needs to be firm so
it won't break down. Poaching liquid can include fruit juices, white or red
wine, or any number of fortified wines such as port, vermouth or Compari. Or
intensify the fruit flavor with brandies such Pear William or applejack.;  
Seasoning includes cinnamon sticks, allspice, nutmeg, cloves, peppercorns,
vanilla, lemon or orange peel. Instead of granulated or brown sugar for
sweetening, you can use honey, maple syrup, or preserves such as orange
marmalade. The syrup is often reduced and poured over the fruit to give it a
lustrous sheen and added flavor.;   As with compotes, poached fruit is low in
the fat department, especially if you skip that dollop of whipped cream on the
side, and relatively low in calories.;   Crisps;   Also called crumbles,
because their topping has a crumbly, crunchy texture. The topping provides a
marvelous contrast to the sweetness of the fruit. Here's where nuts such as
almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts and pecans work their magic. Often one or more of
these nuts are mixed with oatmeal or similar grains (you can even use a cereal
such as Grape Nuts) for added texture. The topping can also include sharp
cheddar if the crisp contains apples.;   Crisps of individual fruits such as
apples or cranberries are fine. But try combining them as well.;   Bettys;   A
cousin to crisps and crumbles, according to Linda Zimmerman and Peggy Mellody,
authors of "Cobblers, Crumbles and Crisps" (Clarkson Potter, $11), this homey
fruit dessert was originally made of layers of sweetened and spiced apples and
buttered crumbs. Today, bread cubes often replace the crumbs, and any fruit
can be used.;   The bread doesn't have to be plain, old white bread either.
Try raisin bread, nut breads, eggy challah or Italian panettone. A great way
to use up leftovers.;   And you can use leftover fruit as well. Super chef
Jacques Pepin makes a betty with leftover baked apples.;   Baked fruit;   Like
poached fruit, an underutilized method of dessert-making that's perfect for
sturdy fall fruit, especially apples, quince and pears. And as with poached
fruit, it can be low in fat and relatively low in calories.;   Apples make the
best baked fruit because there are so many varieties to choose from and
because they accommodate so many other flavors.;   Dried fruit -- especially
prunes, raisins, dates, apricots and figs -- are wonderful stuffed inside
baked apples. For added flavor, you could soak them in brandy, rum or fruit
juice. Nuts go well in stuffing too. In addition to walnuts, almonds and
hazelnuts, try toasted pine nuts.;   For sweeteners, apricot preserves or
orange marmalade work especially well. Seasonings can include cinnamon,
nutmeg, candied ginger, cardamom and allspice.;   Gratins;   Technically this
is also a baked fruit dessert but it usually involves cut up, rather than
whole fruit. The fruit or fruit mixture is baked in a gratin dish until it
caramelizes in a hot oven or under a broiler. Occasionally, the fruit is first
mixed with a cream sauce such as creme anglaise. A simple combination might be
apples and seedless grapes with apricot preserves or pears with preserved
ginger in syrup.; Pandowdy;   Another variation on deep-dish pie, this was
originally a breakfast dish served on New England farms. (Not a bad idea for
any of these desserts.) Usually made with apples, it has the same structure as
a cobbler but with one fillip. After it has baked about two-thirds of the way
through, the crust is broken into pieces (called "dowdying"). The pieces are
pushed down into the fruit and the dish returned to the oven for completion.; 
 Try an updated pandowdy of apples, quince and dried cherries seasoned with
cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and ginger. Spoon into bowls and serve hot or warm
with heavy cream or ice cream.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  THIS time of year, you want to welcome friends into your home. But for
practicality's sake, preparations must be streamlined to fit in with all the
other activities of the season.;   This menu is great for that, because it is

Cooks who have cooked more Christmas turkeys than they care to remember
often dream about, and may even plan on, serving something different on
December 25. But when it comes to the crunch the conservative will of the
family nearly always wins.
Ah well. Console yourself with the thought that if you give in and stick to
the inevitable bird and all its trimmings that large family gatherings seem
to expect and demand, at least the Christmas day mood in your household will
be more peaceable than in those in which novelty has been forced on the
natives.
It is only when small groups of like-minded adults join forces, and children
and grandparents are notably absent, that alternative Christmas celebrations
stand any real chance of coming to happy fruition.
For those who have managed to escape the year-in year-out routine, here are
some celebratory suggestions that centre on seafood rather than poultry.
Those committed to the same old Christmas menu as usual might like to save
these ideas for January dinner parties.
DOVER SOLE WITH OYSTERS AND MUSHROOMS
Three good size Dover soles are enough to serve four people as a main
course, or six as a first course, but as this is Christmas I would use four
fish. Ask the fishmonger to skin and fillet them for you and bring home all
the trimmings - essential flavourings for the sauce.
4 fine plump Dover soles; 1 1/2 dozen oysters; 4-6 oz chestnut mushrooms;
1/2 pt double cream; 2 tablespoons Noilly Prat; half a lemon; 2 tbsp chopped
parsley.
Simmer the fish trimmings and mushroom stalks in 1 1/2 pt water for half an
hour. Strain and reduce to  3/4 pt to concentrate flavour. Just  1/2 pt is
needed for this dish. Save the remaining  1/4 pt for another day (you could
use it, for example, to make the scallop and squash ravioli recipe given
below). Boil the Noilly Prat until reduced by half, mix it with  1/2 pt of
the stock, season lightly and reserve.
Slice the mushrooms, put them into a small saucepan with the cream, some sea
salt and a grinding of pepper. Half-cover and bring very slowly to simmering
point. Remove the lid and simmer for about 10 minutes until the liquid is
somewhat reduced and sticky. Stir occasionally during this time to prevent a
skin from forming. Set aside.
Shuck the oysters. Lay the sole fillets in a buttered gratin dish and pour
the oyster juices over them. Add a grinding of pepper and a squeeze of lemon
and lay butter paper over the top. (Everything up to this stage can be done
ahead.)
Cook the fish on a pre-heated baking sheet in the oven at 375'F-400'F
(190'C-200'C) gas mark 5-6 for 5-6 minutes. Transfer the fish carefully to a
warmed serving dish and keep hot while you finish the sauce.
Boil the sole cooking liquor for a minute or two and gently reheat the
mushroom cream. Add the first to the second and bring back to simmering
point. Continue simmering briefly if needs be to achieve good consistency.
Chop the oysters roughly and slip them into the pan. Stir to immerse them,
then quickly cover with the lid and turn out the flame but leave the pan
where it is for 5 minutes. That way the oysters will heat through without
danger of toughening.
When time is up, check seasoning, spoon the creamy mixture over the fish and
sprinkle lightly with parsley - like a green backbone down the centre of the
dish.
SCALLOP AND SQUASH RAVIOLI
Decorative and flavoursome, this will serve six as a not-too-substantial
main course. To make more of a meal of it add extra scallops or large raw
prawns freshly grilled. If possible enlist a pair of helping hands for the
final stage of cooking so one of you can sear the scallops while the other
deals with the pasta, then both can assemble the dish.
10 fine scallops; 1 butternut squash; 8 sheets lasagne, home-made or bought
(fresh not dried); 1 oz sun-dried tomatoes in oil, drained and cut into
snippets; 2-3 table-spoons toasted pinenuts; a bunch of basil; 1 generous
teaspoon finely chopped ginger root; 1 generous teaspoon coriander seed,
freshly toasted in a dry frying pan and reduced to a powder; 2 garlic cloves
and 1 onion, both finely chopped; 4 fl oz richly flavoured fish stock; 4 fl
oz freshly squeezed orange juice and the finely grated zest of 1 orange; 4
tablespoons olive oil; 3 oz butter.
Halve and seed the squash and steam it for 10-12 minutes until tender. Blot
dry, peel and quarter the flesh. Cut most of it into  1/4 inch thick slices.
Dice the rest finely. Cover and reserve.
Clean the scallops, gently separate the corals from the whites and slice
each white across into two or three discs depending on the plumpness of the
cushion. Set aside.
Sweat the onion for 10 minutes in the oil in a heavy-based pan with a well
fitting lid. Add the garlic and ginger and sweat for 10 minutes more.
Cut the pasta into large ravioli squares and prepare the other ingredients
as described in the ingredients list. (Everything up to this stage can be
done ahead.)
Add 1 oz butter to the onion pan. When it has melted and the mixture is hot
stir in the coriander and sun-dried tomatoes. Add the orange juice, zest and
squash. Cover tightly and cook over a minimal flame for about 15 minutes
until everything is well heated through. Shake and stir the contents of the
pan once or twice and season with salt and pepper after the first five
minutes.
When ready, lift most of the solids out of the pan with a slotted spoon
(leaving some of the diced squash, onion and flavourings behind with the
liquid) and keep them hot in a covered dish in a low oven.
Add the stock to the pan and the remaining 2 oz butter cut into dice. Let
the mixture bubble up and blend to make a rich sauce and check seasoning.
Meanwhile, cook and drain the pasta and sear the scallops in batches in a
hot saute pan barely filmed with oil. Scallops need only to glance at the
heat; turn and remove them in the order in which you added them to the pan,
and keep them hot with the squash.
Finally, to assemble the open ravioli, lay some of the pasta squares on a
warmed serving dish. Spoon some of the filling over them, sprinkle with
freshly torn basil leaves, cover with more pasta squares and pour on some of
the sauce. Add extra layers in the same way, ending with the last of the
sauce. Scatter with the pine-nuts and strew with basil for the sake of its
colour and sweet peppery bite.

desserts. (Color)  </CAPTION>
<DESCRIPT>  RECIPE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  WHEN THE  thermometer starts pushing past 80, it's time to start thinking
about vinaigrettes to dress the myriad salads we'll be eating this summer.;   
Vinaigrette is the original and only true French dressing. Forget the orange
stuff that comes in a bottle and tastes like cough syrup.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Food  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  BEST-DRESSED SALADS OF SUMMER WEAR VINAIGRETTES  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  See related article on page 8C  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     In its simplest form, a vinaigrette contains only oil and vinegar, salt and
pepper. Indeed, as Cordon Bleu cooking instructor Richard Grausman points out,
"If the oil and vinegar used have excellent flavor, nothing else is needed."; 
  But with an endless selection of oils, flavored vinegars, fruit purees,
mustards, herbs and spices, vinaigrettes can be varied to suit almost any kind
of dish, from avocado and papaya salad to grilled fennel and leeks.;    Most
vinaigrette recipes call for three parts oil to one part vinegar. But
recently, Julia Child scoffed at that ratio.;    "A three-to-one-ratio is much
too strong of vinegar," Child said. "It should be more like five or six to
one, or just enough vinegar to remove the oily taste.";    In an effort to
reduce fat content of dressings, consumers have reduced oil to the point of
throat-gagging excess acidity. So how do you satisfy the dual gods of taste
and health? Keep in mind that a vinaigrette should coat food, not float it.
Most salads are badly overdressed. A healthy portion of green salad shouldn't
have more than two tablespoons of dressing, and some of that is going to be
vinegar and seasonings.;    Another way to combat excess vinaigrette is to
make sure greens and other foods are properly dried, so a minimum of dressing
is needed to adhere to them.;    Vinaigrettes can be swirled together in a
mixing bowl or shaken in a jar with a screw-top cap. The order in which you
mix a vinaigrette isn't usually important. But the late James Beard suggested
that only a small amount of vinegar should be added initially, and more added
later to suit individual tastes. "It is easier to add vinegar than to
counteract it," Beard reasoned.;    About the only time the order of
ingredients is important is when you make a creamy vinaigrette, which is
basically a thinned mayonnaise. To make a creamy vinaigrette, start with an
egg yolk and add oil gradually, as if making mayonnaise. Then add the
remaining ingredients. You can eliminate the egg if you use prepared mustard,
but the mustard must be at room temperature and the oil added very slowly.;   
And what about safety with that raw yolk? Make your creamy vinaigrette the day
before and the acids (vinegar or lemon juice) will kill any chance of
salmonella. In general, vinaigrettes, with or without egg yolks, should be
refrigerated and brought to room temperature for use.;    Here are some tips
for better vinaigrettes.;    Oil;  Like all things simple, vinaigrettes
require quality ingredients. It doesn't make sense to cut corners with
substandard oil and third-rate vinegar.;    (box) Olive oil: The primary oil
for vinaigrettes. Flavors and strengths can range from light and gently
perfumed to pungent and peppery. The oil you use should match the food it is
complementing. A heavy-duty olive oil won't wilt the flavor of mustard greens,
but it will overpower bibb or other mild lettuce.;    (box) Nut oils: Walnut
and almond oil are good for fruit and delicate salads. But buy nut oils in
small quantities and use them quickly, since they turn rancid faster than
other oils.;    (box) Sesame oil: Wonderful as an accent in Asian vinaigrettes
but it's strong stuff. Use it sparingly and make up the difference with peanut
oil.;    (box) Neutral oils: Though neutral oils such as safflower, canola and
corn oil are often called for in vinaigrette recipes, my feeling is "what's
the point?" They carry the same amount of calories as other oils, but none of
the flavor. Sometimes, however, you may want to emphasize the vinegar over the
oil and only a neutral oil will do. In that case, you might as well use
canola, which has the highest amount of heart-beneficial monounsaturated fat.;
   Vinegar;  (box)  Wine vinegars, white or red: Most commonly used in
vinaigrettes. But don't assume all are alike. Choose and shop for the kind you
like. Technically, sherry vinegar is a wine vinegar, but it's milder than most
wine vinegars. Try it with salads that have citrus fruit in them. I like to
use sherry vinaigrette on a salad of sliced oranges, with thin red onions and
oil-cured olives.;    (box) Asian vinegars: Mild rice wine vinegars don't have
to be used only in Asian dishes. Dark Chinkiang vinegar is also mild and has a
neat, malty taste.;    (box) Balsamic vinegar: It has a richness and natural
sweetness that make many vinaigrette combinations excel. Because it is milder
you can often use a higher percentage of it than other vinegars.;    (box)
Flavored vinegars: From raspberry to tarragon, they have their charms, but
they're more limited than most other vinegars.;    (box) Cider vinegar: Though
lost in the vinegar shuffle in the past few years, I like its light fruitiness
and somewhat mild flavor.;    Vinegar substitutes;  Lemon juice is the most
common substitute for vinegar, but you can also use it in combination with
vinegar. Lime juice is a good choice if you're doing a Latin or Asian-style
vinaigrette. Since you don't need a lot, there's no excuse for not using
fresh-squeezed juice.;    Other liquids;  A touch of wine gives a vinaigrette
sparkle. And if you use dry vermouth, you can eliminate adding herbs. Soy
sauce is a natural in Asian vinaigrettes. Nuoc mam or fish sauce can be used
to accent Thai or Vietnamese salads.;    Herbs;  Beard said that parsley and
chives were standard for all vinaigrettes. His other favorites were tarragon,
basil and dill. Child likes minced shallots. A good rule to follow is to have
one or two neutral herbs such as parsley and chives (or shallots or scallions)
and one other. Too many herbs confuse the taste buds.;    Other herbs to
consider are chervil, oregano, marjoram and thyme. Use fresh herbs whenever
possible.;    Spices;  Salt and pepper are the two most common seasonings, but
don't take them for granted. Kosher salt has a cleaner, less chemical taste
than most commercial salt. And there's nothing like fresh-ground black
pepper.;    Garlic adds wonderful flavor to vinaigrettes, but it can be
overpowering. Some recipes call for pounding it in a mortar with salt.
Delicious but pungent. For a less potent garlic accent, do what my mother
does. Add a whole, crushed clove of garlic to a vinaigrette several hours
before the dressing is used. Check the flavor every hour until the suggestion
of garlic is just where you want it. Then remove the clove. Or, you can roast
the garlic (one hour in a 325-degree oven) until it assumes a pleasing, nutty
flavor.;    Here are some more spice ideas: chili powder and ground, toasted
cumin for Southwestern vinaigrettes; finely minced lemon grass for Thai and
Vietnamese vinaigrettes; caraway seeds for a salad of shredded cabbage and
carrots; minced ginger with lime juice and scallions for Asian vegetables.;   
Et cetera;  Dijon mustard is a regular in my vinaigrettes, for its piquancy
and emulsifying properties. And don't forget all those flavored mustards such
as sweet and hot, dill, garlic.;    Try these too: capers, especially with
vinaigrettes for cold seafood or meat; pureed, kalamata or oil-cured olives to
brush on grilled bread; orange zest, especially with sherry vinegar; anchovy
paste for Caesar vinaigrettes on roasted red peppers.  </TEXT>

Drop the beans into a large pan of lightly salted boiling water and simmer
over medium-low heat for about 4 minutes, or until barely tender. Drain into a
colander, then run cold water over the beans to stop the cooking and to help
retain the color. Set aside. Remove the stems from the shiitake mushrooms and
discard. (If using regular white mushrooms, trim the stems, but leave them
attached to the caps.) Rinse the caps and pat dry on paper towels. Cut the
caps (or the whole white mushrooms) into 1/4-inch slices and set aside. (May
be done ahead up to this point.);   Combine the butter and oil in a large
skillet or wok over medium-high heat. When it is hot, add the beans and
mushrooms and cook, stirring and tossing, until the mushrooms are limp and the

The lure of the stove fades fast in hot weather. Good eating still appeals -
providing the dishes are light and fresh, not stodgy or creamy - but the
less cooking involved the better. This is a time when good shopping comes to
the fore and classy offerings from the delicatessen seem worth their weight
in gold.
As good fortune would have it, the hot spell in southern England has
coincided with the arrival in the UK of some fine foods from Italy.
Masseria is a small estate in Apulia, the heel of Italy. Its artisanal
products are strictly seasonal and quantities are limited. Own-grown
vegetables ripened in the southern sun are a speciality. Harvested in small
batches when at their peak, they are cooked and preserved within hours, and
this freshness is evident in the eating.
Unusual offerings include a vibrant green pasta sauce, made from the cooked
and pureed tips of a sort of wild broccoli, cime di rapa. Even more
noteworthy is a range of antipasti vegetables preserved in olive oil.
Of these the grilled wedges of artichoke are truly outstanding: the firm
sweet texture of the fresh vegetable is retained and the delicate artichoke
flavour shines through.
They are quite unlike most other preserved artichokes, which tend to be soft
verging on soggy and mildly sozzled with an overdose of vinegar.
These Masseria artichokes are in their prime now, having been picked,
grilled and bottled just recently. As the months go by they will soften a
little. But supplies of this year's crop will be snapped up and eaten long
before that happens.
Any day now Masseria grilled baby onions will come on stream. By September
sun-dried red peppers will be harvested, bottled and ready for sale, as will
lampasconi (delicately flavoured hyacinth-like wild bulbs). Treats to look
forward to.
September will also see the arrival in Britain of the new season's peperoni
farciti, an exquisite offering from Roi of Liguria. These stuffed peppers,
which I sampled at last year's harvest, are tiny round medium-hot peppers,
each carefully stuffed with whole anchovy fillets and capers, packed in
Roi's delicate extra virgin olive oil.
Like Masseria's grilled artichokes, Roi's stuffed peppers are a star product
to which I could easily become addicted. Try either or both of them with a
few slices of good ham, a hard-boiled egg or two and a smattering of fresh
chopped herbs. Perfect for lunch in the garden.
Sardinia is uncharted gastronomic territory so far as most Britons are
concerned. But not for long, as some of the best of the island's produce is
just beginning to trickle into the British marketplace.
San Giuliano, near Alghero, northern Sardinia, produces a commendable
selection of vegetable antipasti preserved in olive oil, that includes wild
cardoons, antunna mushrooms (a member of the oyster mushroom family
indigenous to Sardinia), and sun-dried tomatoes stuffed with anchovies,
herbs and spices.
There is also a San Giuliano extra virgin olive oil which, at less than
Pounds 6 per litre, strikes me as a very agreeable, very affordable everyday
olive oil; while from Sartos and San Raimondo in middle and southern
Sardinia respectively come prize-winning fruttato olive oils.
Casar's canned vegetables, from the Cagliari region in the south, include
excellent pulses: canned lentils, borlotti and, best of all, large mealy
white beans known as fagioli di spagna. The canned plum tomato products are
the best I have come across.
The Sardinians, like the British, are notably sweet-toothed. Some of their
biscuits and sweetmeats are Arab influenced. High fruit content jams include
a fine bilberry. Intensely flavoured hazels, almonds, walnuts and sultanas
stored in honey are especially delicious. This is an ancient preservation
method almost forgotten elsewhere.
Long-keeping foods are a hallmark of Sardinian cuisine. Traditional island
breads include pane carasau, colloquially known as carta di musica, or music
paper. Crackling, parchment-thin, it will keep for up to a year after
baking.
Even longer lasting is botarga, the salted and dried roe of mullet or blue
fin tuna. This fishy treat is Sardinia's greatest delicacy and is so
intensely savoury that only minute quantities are needed to kick-start the
appetite. Just as well, for it is a luxury item in the caviar and truffle
price bracket, food for high days and holidays.
One classic (and effortless) way to serve botarga is shaved wafer thin or
grated to a powder, sprinkled over a generous handful of rocket or broken
pieces of carta di musica drizzled with olive oil. (The poor man's version
substitutes sea salt for botarga.)
This is a splendid dish for reviving jaded appetites on summer days, when I
might preface it with a thirst-quenching soup, well chilled and agreeably
thin - made perhaps with Sardinian canned tomatoes, sieved to a puree,
generously diluted with light stock or iced water, enriched with a splash of
olive oil and aromatised with crushed fennel seeds and a sliver of garlic.

Shortened daylight hours and the return of cooler evenings might seem like two 
good reasons to give up summer out-of-doors activities. But for some, the 
beloved picnic is an outing too relaxing to abandon. That's how fall tailgate 
parties came into favor. 
</P>
<P>
The activity has typically accompanied a seasonal sporting event such as 
football or an early evening at the races. But whether the trek leads to a 
favorite scenic spot or the stadium parking lot, now is the time for a tailgate 
picnic. 
</P>
<P>
Although standard picnic fare such as cold fried chicken and mayonnaise-laden 
salads can be fairly high in fat and calories, it is possible to picnic and 
have all the fun and good taste of a celebration even when reducing the fat 
content of your menu.

These tips, from the Human Nutrition Information Service, an agency of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, will help picnic-packers assemble more healthful 
baskets -- ones that are in line with the U.S. Dietary Guidelines and emphasize 
foods that are low in sodium, sugars, fat and calories. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Grill chicken, hamburgers and lean steaks so the fat runs off during 
cooking. Remove the skin from poultry, particularly if the fried variety will 
be served, and trim visible fat from steaks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use salt, butter and margarine sparingly, if at all, on corn-on-the-cob. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Load up on mixed green salad or vegetable relishes, featuring cherry 
tomatoes, radishes, cucumbers, carrots, celery, green peppers, broccoli and 
cauliflower. Have smaller helpings of coleslaw, potato and macaroni salad. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Liven up the flavor of burgers with lettuce, tomatoes, onions or other 
vegetables instead of barbecue sauce, catsup, mustard, relish and pickles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Enjoy bananas, grapes, pears, apples, figs and other fall season fruits. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pack small cans or cartons of fruit juice or unsweetened ice tea rather 
than soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Take along small boxes or bags of raisins or dried fruit mix, or prepare a 
snack mix with plain popcorn, unsweetened cereals, bite-size pretzels and 
seasonings such as paprika, hot pepper sauce and onion or garlic powder. These 
items can replace cakes, cookies, potato chips and other snacks. 
</P>
<P>
The following recipes for homemade breads, soups, and sandwiches will give the 
excursion a healthful and tasty flair. 
</P>
<P>

SHAHRZAD IS MORE THAN JUST KEBABS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ihave a sneaking suspicion that the rise of Persian restaurants around here has 
something to do with the rise of yogurt in our diet, but I can't prove it. 
</P>
<P>
I do know that Ventura Boulevard is lined with frozen yogurt shops the way the 
Champs Elysees is lined with trees. I also know there has been a tremendous 
influx of Iranians to Los Angeles since the fall of the shah. Let's hedge our 
bets and say the Persian restaurant boom is tied in with both these facts 
somehow. 
</P>
<P>
Shahrzad started as a humble kebab restaurant in Westwood and today is a 
near-conglomerate with four branches. The Encino Shahrzad, nicknamed Bahar 
(spring), shows how far Iranian restaurants have come since the '80s. The 
dining room is stark and shapely, with modish, quasi-Scandinavian chairs and 
tables. The white postmodern ceiling is a jumble of sharp edges and mysterious 
corners that looks as if it had been designed for a disco. 
</P>
<P>
What better dish to start a Persian dinner with than yogurt? Mast o mosir, an 
enormous bowl of plain yogurt and finely minced shallots, makes a pungent, 
highly digestible accompaniment for sheets of parchment-like Iranian bread 
rolled up with butter and/or various torshi, the Iranian pickles that the 
restaurant prepares. 
</P>
<P>
Torshi are made from onion, garlic or chili peppers; Iranians happily eat them 
straight. They have a very sharp, vinegary quality, and I find them to be an 
acquired taste -- or to be exact, a taste I haven't acquired. 
</P>
<P>
Hot appetizers in Persian restaurants are basically the Turkish appetizers 
familiar to most of us through Greek, Armenian and Arab restaurants. I found 
the hot appetizers here oily and painfully overcooked. Dolmeh are grape leaves 
with a delicious rice and meat filling, but they're unattractively soggy. 
</P>
<P>
"Eggplant delight" is a hot appetizer that actually is Iranian in origin, but 
Shahrzad's is one of the few unappealing renditions of this dish -- usually 
known as kashk o bademjan -- I have ever run into. The puree of eggplant and 
garlic topped with thickened yogurt has a vaguely sour, tired taste instead of 
the sweetness and freshness that should make it a perfect snack or dip. 
</P>
<P>
Among the entrees, there is a wide variety of Persian stews and house 
specialties, but as a Persian family at the next table informed me, most of the 
customers come for the kebabs. Apparently the grilled dishes are harder to make 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the kebabs here are mostly quite good, marinated in coriander, 
garlic and other fragrant things, then flame broiled and served on an 
outrageously large pile of rice. The best I tasted was the lamb kebab, weighing 
nearly a pound and tender as a baby's cheek. 
</P>
<P>
Soltani, the largest dish served, is a combination of kubideh (ground beef and 
chopped onion molded onto a skewer and served in one long piece) and barg 
(steak kebab that tastes heavily tenderized). Both meats are extremely well 
seasoned with garlic and coriander. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't get to the chicken kebab, but that was by design. The one at the next 
table came charred black. 
</P>
<P>
The more curious diner may wish to sample some of the house specials. Proceed 
at your own risk in this restaurant. Their fesenjan, or pomegranate walnut 
chicken stew, was just awful, oily to the point of rancidity. That is a shame; 
the dish can be one of the true showpieces of a good Persian kitchen. Ghaimeh, 
yellow split peas cooked in a tomato saffron sauce, didn't please me either. 
Like many dishes here, it was more sour than anything else, with little 
subtlety or dimension. 
</P>
<P>
Only the albaloo polo, rice cooked with sour cherries, was as pleasing as I'd 
hoped. Oddly enough, the cherries weren't as sour as they might have been. 
</P>
<P>
You'd better like rose water if you plan on having dessert here; they have 
rather a heavy hand with it. Persian ice cream, for example, seems to be 
vanilla ice cream with a healthy snootful of it. There's plenty more in the 
zolbia, a lattice-shaped fritter soaked with honey that resembles the Indian 
jilebi. The baklava, made with a mixture of walnut and pistachio, is truly 
overloaded with the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Finish up with Turkish coffee or dough (pronounced "doog"), which is a sort of 
yogurt-soda. It tastes like mineral water and plain yogurt shaken together, and 
no, I didn't try it this time. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because I'm waiting until they serve it frozen. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: mast o mosir, $2.50, lamb shish kebab, $10.95, barg 
sandwich, $9.95, baklava, $1.

<DESCRIPT>  FOOD; RECIPE; HOLIDAY  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  HOME cooking has definitely changed.;   These days it's rare that anyone
spends four hours over a stove to prepare a single dish. Or starts cooking for
a party three days ahead. Or follows Julia Child recipes for an entire menu.
But, on the other hand, home cooking is more than opening a microwave oven,
sticking in a frozen box and punching the pad.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Food  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  WRITER ADVISES COOKS TO 'FOLLOW LOOSE APPROACH'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Florence Fabricant wraps it all up in her latest book, "New Home Cooking:
Feeding Family, Feasting Friends" (Clarkson Potter, $30). For more than 20
years she has written about food for the New York Times and the Nation's
Restaurant News.;   Fabricant credits restaurant chefs with bringing about
changes in home kitchens. "Were it not for the explosion of restaurant chefs
and their talents, the idea of today's home cooking would not have come
about," she said recently at a book-signing reception at Meadowood in St.
Helena.;   Her book is good -- and usable. The menus are quick, stylish, easy
(most of the time), informal and allow for spontaneity. "People say my recipes
work," Fabricant says proudly.;   Fabricant finds great pleasure in
entertaining. But she warns against using preconceived menus and recipes.
"Follow a loose approach," she says. Decide on meat or fish, salad or not,
cake or pie. Hold off on ingredients until you get to the market and see
what's in season, what's top quality. Revise the menu accordingly. Fabricant
says she has been known to change an entire menu plan when she found something
new or unusual while shopping.;   Say you've decided to make a sauteed pepper
stir-fry. You get to the market and discover some great baby artichokes or
napa cabbage. The peppers can wait.;   While Fabricant says chefs have
contributed to major changes in the kitchen, she also says most chefs are
unaware how home cooks function. And the more complicated a recipe is, the
more prone it is to error. In her book, she takes ideas and recipes from
professional chefs and translates them into ordinary language.;   Most of
Fabricant's menus reflect classic, homey fare. Occasionally, though, she gets
carried away. Take her "Pasta, Pesto and Pears" menu with its arugula salad
with pesto vinaigrette; penne with eggplant, tomatoes and mozzarella; and
lemon-pepper pears splashed with grappa. Too much, too trendy.;   Her
fall-holiday menu shines, however, with roast turkey breast with sweet mustard
glaze, corn bread and pepper dressing, braised brussels sprouts and
cranberry-pecan pie. The dishes are straightforward and uncomplicated, and
many lend themselves to advance preparation and reheating. With this menu,
Fabricant recommends a fruity red wine such as beaujolais or full-bodied
chardonnay.; (hbox);   This recipe calls for long, slow cooking at very low
temperature to produce a moist, tender turkey breast.; ROAST TURKEY BREAST
WITH SWEET MUSTARD GLAZE; 1 boneless turkey breast, about 3 1/2 to 4 pounds,
rolled and tied; 1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened; 1/2 tablespoon
grainy mustard; 1/2 tablespoon light brown sugar; Salt and freshly ground
black pepper;  Heat oven to 200 degrees. Place turkey breast on a rack in a
roasting pan.;   Mix butter with mustard and brown sugar, and rub this mixture
over the exposed surfaces of the turkey breast. Season lightly with salt and
pepper.;   Roast the turkey about 3 hours, until a meat thermometer registers
150 degrees. Remove the turkey from the oven and allow to sit at least 20
minutes before removing the trussing strings and slicing. Makes 8 servings.;  
One serving: 365 calories, 1 gm. carbohydrate, 68 gm. protein, 8 gm. fat, 157
mg. sodium, 159 mg. cholesterol.; (hbox);    This following basic corn bread
recipe can also be used to make muffins. To do so, add 1/4 cup sugar to the
batter.; BASIC BUTTERMILK CORN BREAD; 1 1/2 cups yellow cornmeal; 1 cup
all-purpose flour; 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda; 1 teaspoon salt; 1 1/2 cups
buttermilk; 1 large egg, beaten; 2 tablespoons corn oil;  Heat oven to 400
degrees. Butter a 9- or 10-inch round baking pan or a cast-iron skillet.;   In
a large bowl, blend the cornmeal, flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir in
buttermilk, egg and oil. Spread batter in pan, and bake 30 minutes. Makes 6 to
8 servings.;   One serving: 279 calories, 46 gm. carbohydrate, 8 gm. protein,
7 gm. fat, 636 mg. sodium, 38 mg. cholesterol.; (hbox); CORN BREAD AND PEPPER

<LEADPARA>  THE pungent scent of the six "hot spices of Christmas" are as much a part of
the holiday as the perfume of the pine.;   They are cinnamon, cloves, ginger,
nutmeg, mace and allspice, according to McCormick/Schilling, a major U.S.
spice producer.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Food  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  HOW BEST TO USE HOLIDAY SPICES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     When buying spices, remember that whole spices keep longer than their
ground counterparts. Although spices do not spoil, they should be checked once
a year for potency. Once opened, they lose flavor and aroma.;   Never store
spices near a heat source or near strong, direct light. To test for freshness,
give the container a sniff. If the aroma greets you without having to bury
your nose in the container, the spice is still in peak condition.;   Here's a
spice primer, with some tips on how to use them in holiday foods:;   (box)
Despite its name, allspice, often called Jamaican pepper, is the berry of an
evergreen tree, native to the Caribbean. The flavor is a combination of
cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves, which accounts for its name. Any or all three may
be substituted for allspice in a recipe. If a recipe, such as fruitcake, calls
for allspice and nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon, it's often wise to cut back on
the cloves to avoid overpowering the food.;   The Scandinavians popularized
allspice, using it in marinades to pickle fish. While the whole berries are
good in marinades, tomato sauce and other liquids, they do not soften and
should be set aside when eating. Ground allspice will color a food, so use it
only when color is not a factor.;   (box) Cinnamon is the bark of a tree,
which is peeled and dried in the sun. In this country, what we call cinnamon
is really cassia, a member of the cinnamon family. True cinnamon is sold in
Mexico and has a milder flavor than cassia.;   Use cinnamon sticks to stir hot
chocolate or other creamy hot drinks; or use to flavor hot punches. Ground
cinnamon is a natural in apple pie, sprinkled on grapefruit or French toast,
added to stewed or baked fruit and coffee cakes.;   (box) Nutmeg and mace
commonly are grouped together because they both come from the nutmeg tree.
Nutmeg is the seed of a fruit that looks something like an apricot. Mace is
the orange-red lacy covering of the seed.;   Although nutmeg is stronger and
darker in color than mace, they can be interchanged. However, many people find
the lesser known mace to have a more pleasing flavor. Try substituting mace
for nutmeg in chocolate dishes.;   Sprinkle either or both on eggnog; add to
spiced nuts, liver pate, cocktail meatballs or creamy seafood.;   (box) Cloves
are the unopened bud of a tree. If the bud opens to a flower, the "crop" is
ruined. Permanent scaffolding is usually is placed around the tree, so pickers
can pick the buds daily.;   Use a whole clove to flavor the water when cooking
beets or in a spice pouch when flavoring a hot punch. Use ground cloves in
spice cakes and cookies and in barbecue sauce. Whole cloves increase in flavor
as the dish stands, so when refrigerating the food overnight, you may want to
remove the cloves.;   (box) Ginger was an ancient Oriental spice, one of the
earliest Oriental spices known to Europeans. It is the rhizome, a root-like
structure of a plant. It is well-known in its knotty form as the stuff of
Chinese food and in its ground form as the major ingredient in everyone's
favorite Christmas cookie.;   Crystallized or candied ginger has been cooked
in a sugar syrup.;   Ginger will complement chicken, pork and carrots. Add a
dash of ginger to the mayonnaise when making Waldorf salad. Use in pumpkin and
apple pie, sweet potato dishes and syrup for fruit punches.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Fruit Desserts: Indulgences for the Health-Conscious</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the things that makes a healthy diet hard
to stick to is the feeling that you're missing out.
   Try fruit.
   Fruit is, of course, tempting when local fruits are at their
peak. Then, they are the ``first and foremost of the fast food
desserts,'' say cookbook authors Sheryl and Mel London.
   But year-round, dressed up, fruit can be elegant and wipe out
any sense of deprivation.
   Herbs or flowers mixed with fruit seems a new combination in
American cooking, but, in fact, it's an idea that dates back
centuries and is now being revived as cooks search for more local,
healthful foods to replace the butter and cream and chocolate that
have so often signaled dessert.
   Sorbets are fat-free, easy to make and can be adapted to just
about any fruit.
   In warm weather, fruit can be grilled. The natural sugars in
fruit carmelize over the coals, so all that's needed is to skewer a
selection of fruits and place them on the barbecue. A yogurt-based
fruit sauce makes it fancy.
   ``We are both addicted to a healthful diet: low in fat and
relying mostly on fish and chicken for our protein needs,'' the
Londons write in their new book ``Fresh Fruit Desserts: Classic and
Contemporary'' (Prentice Hall Press, $24.95).
   While theirs is not a diet book, they kept health in mind: ``We
have attempted to address our concerns about cholesterol by relying
more upon spices, herbs, citrus and liqueurs to provide flavor,
while being quite prudent in paring down the amounts of cream,
eggs, butter and sour cream.''
   To that end, they think about fruits as ``the featured
players.'' The flavor is brought out, not disguised. For
out-of-season or tropical fruits, shipped from far away, that might
mean poaching, baking or gratineeing.
   In designing recipes, Mrs. London said in a telephone interview,
``We sort of did a countdown backward and eliminated.''
   ``We'd look at a recipe and say, `Six eggs! Let's try it with
one and egg whites.' You'd be surprised at how often it works,''
London said.
   A banana souffle, for example, calls for just a half-cup of milk
and two egg yolks to serve four. Strawberry witches froth, served
in wine glasses, needs just fruit, egg whites and a half-cup of
sugar, along with flavorings, to serve eight people.

   Among the Londons' desserts without guilt is the following.

<HEAD>Poached Oranges with Green and Red Grapes and Grenadine Orange</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Peel
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Serves 6 to 8
   The oranges are peeled and sliced, poached, and then marinated
with pale green and red seedless grapes. The orange peel is cut
into julienne strips and steeped separately in a grenadine syrup.
It's a colorful and light dessert that is assembled just before
serving.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Oranges</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   6 large navel oranges
   1 cup water
   { cup sugar
   2 cups seedless green grapes
   { cup seedless red grapes
   3 tablespoons Grand Marnier or other orange-flavored liqueur
   2 teaspoons vanilla extract
   Cut off thin slices from both ends of each orange. With a
vegetable parer, remove long strips of orange peel as thinly as
possible and set aside. Score the oranges and peel away the thick
white pith and then slice across into {-inch slices using a
serrated knife. In a skillet large enough to accommodate the
oranges in one layer, bring the water and the sugar to a boil. Add
the sliced oranges and allow it to come to a boil again, then lower
the heat and poach 3 minutes. Remove the slices with a slotted
spoon and place in a glass serving dish, and add the grapes. Boil
the remaining syrup in the skillet, until reduced to { cup. Remove
skillet from the heat and add the liqueur and vanilla. Cool
slightly and pour over the oranges and grapes. Cover with plastic
wrap and chill in the refrigerator for several hours. During this
period, tilt the bowl once or twice and baste with the liquid.

<HEAD>Grenadine Orange Peel</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Reserved orange peel strips
   1 cup cold water
   One-third cup grenadine syrup
   Cut the orange peel into very thin long strips. There should be
about 1 cup. Add the cold water to a medium saucepan along with the
peel and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and drain in a sieve.
Repeat twice more to remove any bitterness. After the third
draining, put the peel in a plastic container and pour grenadine
syrup over it. Mix well, cover and refrigerate overnight.
   rve, remove half the orange peel with a slotted
spoon and drain on paper towels before sprinkling over fruit. Save
remaining peel for another time.
