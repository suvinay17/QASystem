<LEADPARA>  Odds are that players will be the big winners in the crisis gripping the
California Lottery.;   A new lottery director, apparently former Illinois
lottery chief Sharon Sharp, will be appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson as early as
Wednesday. It will be her job to reverse a startling $300 million sales
decline over the past year.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  California News  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Sharp is likely to give players what recent studies by the lottery and
independent consultants show they want: more prizes and better odds.;  
Players want better odds of winning lotto's big jackpots and would like to see
a greater number of moderate-size prizes, such as those in the $20 to $100
range, in all the games.;   Money for the changes probably would come from
making the biggest prizes a bit smaller, lottery officials and private
analysts say. The lottery-authorizing ballot initiative says the operation can
spend no more than half its total revenue on prizes.;   The experts say the
6-year-old games probably cannot be revitalized without the prize overhaul, a
move that has been resisted historically by the lottery.;   "Prizes are the
central core issue" in the surveys, Chon Gutierrez, the current director of
the state-run lottery, said in a recent interview. "The California Lottery is
at a crossroads.";   Wilson said he will replace Gutierrez, appointed in 1987
by former Gov. George Deukmejian. Wilson froze Gutierrez's plans for prize
changes in the meantime.;   Critics have blamed sales declines on poor
management, including the remaking of Lotto 6/49, with 1 in 14 million odds,
into a game with longer odds in an attempt to foster larger jackpots.;  
Lottery marketing surveys show players feel the Lotto 6/53 game is producing
few winners because the odds are so tiny: 1 in 23 million. The lotto change
"has clouded attitudes toward all lottery games," according to a summary of
the studies.;   Lottery officials, meanwhile, have attributed sales declines
largely to hard economic times.;   Sharp, the probable new lottery director,
is a 51-year-old consultant who had successes directing Illinois' games.
Sources close to the selection process said she is the choice, but Wilson
spokesmen and Sharp declined comment.;   There's a pressing need to convince
Californians that the games have contributed as promised to public education,
research shows. Funding shortages in schools have made Californians
skeptical.;   The situation "has raised questions in people's minds about
where the lottery money is going and why the lottery hasn't solved education's
problems," Gutierrez says. "The questions must be answered to create a
receptive climate for . . . sales-building strategies to be effective.";   So
experts say it's likely the new director will launch a publicity campaign to
ease the problem.;   The Lottery Commission has avoided the approach since a
similar campaign backfired. Teachers criticized TV ads as inaccurately
depicting how lottery funds were used in schools and exaggerating the effect
of lottery funds on education.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  The former director of the Illinois state lottery has been chosen to take the
helm of California's troubled lottery, Gov. Pete Wilson announced Friday.;  
Wilson appointed Sharon Sharp, a 51-year-old Republican, to head the state-run
games of chance that have been plagued by declining sales and player
skepticism over the past year.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  WILSON PICKS NEW CHIEF FOR CALIFORNIA LOTTERY
FORMER ILLINOIS OFFICIAL ACCEPTS CHALLENGE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "Sharon's track record at the Illinois Lottery proves she can do the job
here in California and turn the fortunes of the California Lottery around,"
Wilson said.;   Sharp, who directed the Illinois system from 1987 to 1991,
said she will arrive in California on Wednesday to begin figuring out how to
boost the game's image and income.;   "I've read and studied as much as I can
about the California Lottery, but it's simply premature to say whether I am
going to do this or this or this," Sharp said in a telephone interview from
Illinois. "I am certainly not going to come in with any rosy glow that this is
going to be easy.";   California introduced its lottery in 1985 as a way to
provide added money for schools, which receive about 35 percent of all lottery
revenues.;   Ticket sales rose to a high of $2.6 billion in 1988-'89, bringing
schools an average of $178 per pupil. But sales then tumbled to $2.15 billion
in 1990-'91, and the schools' take slipped to $124 per student.;   This year,
the decline has continued. Total lottery sales from July 1 to Sept. 7 were
only $265 million -- less than three-fourths of what had been expected.;  
Legislators, lottery staff members and lottery commissioners have scrambled
for ways to reverse the decline. Some blame the current economic recession or
the gradual loss of the lottery's novelty.;   Others blame changes in the
state's lotto game that made prizes larger while making the already-slim odds
of winning the top jackpot even slimmer -- from one in 14 million to one in 23
million.;   "There is a general perception that nobody wins the lottery and
that the only prizes are $2 prizes," said Chon Gutierrez, whom Sharp will
replace as lottery director. "(Sharp) is going to have to face these
challenges, and face them in an environment where she doesn't have a lot of
control -- a very soft economy.";   Sharp faced similar challenges when she
was chosen to head the Illinois Lottery in 1987. She made numerous changes,
which included altering Illinois' lotto game to give it higher prizes and
slimmer odds -- the same combination that has come under fire in California.; 
 Illinois' lottery sales rose under Sharp's tenure, with a 48.6 percent lotto
increase in 1989 and record sums going to schools in 1990.;   Sharp -- who
started a lottery consulting firm when she left the Illinois post earlier this
year -- will earn $95,052 a year. Her appointment requires state Senate
confirmation.  </TEXT>

SHARP SEEKING NEW GAMES, QUICK PAYOFFS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     But don't tell that to Sharon Sharp, the new chief of the California
Lottery. After two weeks on the job, she has come up with a new plan to offer
more games, prizes and lotto terminals throughout the state.;   The energetic
and upbeat former director of the Illinois state lottery won approval from the
lottery commission on Thursday for a package that includes increasing the
amount of winnings scratcher players can collect on the spot.;   Her fans
predict that she will be able get California's limping lottery back on its
feet.;   Praised for her skill; "Sharon Sharp is known as one of the
outstanding lottery marketing people in the United States," said Bill Bergman,
executive director of the North American Association of State and Provincial
Lotteries based in Washington, D.C. "With her in charge, I have no doubt the
California Lottery will return to No. 1.";   Sharp, who was appointed by Gov.
Pete Wilson to replace former lottery director Chon Gutierrez, is equally
confident. "We will be moving very quickly to bring about changes. The
California Lottery's financial situation is serious and can't wait," she
said.;   Not an easy job; It won't be an easy recovery.;   Ticket sales have
slipped from a high of $2.6 billion in 1988-'89 to last year's $2.15 billion.
A recent poll shows that only 49 percent of Californians have a favorable view
of the lottery. That is down from 1985, just after the lottery began, when 75
percent looked fondly upon the games. And last year, Florida jumped ahead of
California as the top-selling lottery in America.;   But Sharp remains
undaunted.;   "If Sharon thought it would help lottery sales, she would
probably have dressed up as a lottery ball and marched down Chicago's Michigan
Avenue," said Lynn Sweet, a political writer for the Chicago Sun-Times. "She
was just a super saleswoman for the Illinois lottery.";   In her first
commission meeting Thursday, Sharp gave a glimpse of her aggressive marketing
tactics with a new plan to offer more games, prizes and lotto terminals
throughout the state.;   Her proposal, approved by the five-member commission,
calls for reducing the state's lottery staff and increasing the amount of
winnings scratcher players can collect on the spot. Right now, winners of $25
or more must mail in a claim. Sharp wants to provide immediate payments of up
to $599.;   The director said she will be proposing a full package of game
changes, including revising the ailing 6/53 Lotto, within several weeks.;  
Sharp said the nation's lagging economy may be partly to blame for
California's lottery woes. But she also said new games and promotions are what
is needed to draw people back.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Scuttling an unsuccessful experiment to rejuvenate stagnant lottery sales with
record jackpots, the California Lottery once again is offering better odds on
smaller prizes.;   The new game, named Super Lotto, began Sunday, replacing
the spectacularly unsuccessful Lotto 6/53 game, which produced a 25 percent,
$500 million-a-year decline in sales. Because there were no grand prize
winners in the final 6/53 drawing Saturday night, that $2.9 million jackpot
rolls over into the first Super Lotto pot for Wednesday.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  California News  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  LOTTERY TAKES A CHANCE ON NEW SUPER LOTTO
LOWER-ODDS GAME IS RESULT OF POOR SALES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The most important change in the new game reduces the field from which
players must match six winning numbers for a jackpot from 53 numbers to 51.;  
That may not sound like much, but it improves the odds of winning the jackpot
from one in 23 million to one in 18 million. It also slightly improves a
player's chances of winning smaller prizes for matching five, four or three of
the six numbers picked in the twice-weekly lottery drawings.;   Theoretically,
the jackpots could be just as big as they have been in the past, when the top
prize in one jackpot last April reached a record $118.8 million.;   But those
big prizes come from unclaimed top prizes rolling over for several weeks into
ever-bigger jackpots. The slightly better odds reduce that potential
enormously, increasing the chances for many more smaller jackpots.;   The
Lotto 6/53 game replaced the original 6/49 game, which had odds of one in 14
million for the top prize.;   The 6/49 game was dropped when sales leveled
off. The bigger jackpots expected from the 6/53 game were predicted to boost
sales. Instead, sales declined, with many players feeling the odds against
winning had grown too stiff.;   The new game, whose first drawing is Wednesday
evening, also eliminates the bonus number, which was good only with five of
the regular drawing numbers for a secondary jackpot of about $250,000 to
$500,000.;   The new Super Lotto game is the first major change in the lottery
proposed by its new director, Sharon Sharp, former Illinois lottery director,
who was hired in September to revitalize the California Lottery.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Gov. Pete Wilson, stepping directly into the California Lottery crisis, has
headed off plans to scrap the troubled Lotto 6/53 game and says he wants to
replace Lottery Director Chon Gutierrez before any overhaul is attempted.;  
The policy-setting Lottery Commission, at Wilson's request, voted 5-0 Tuesday
to delay a proposal by Gutierrez that would have made sweeping changes in the
lottery. A primary aspect of the plan, which Gutierrez said was compiled by a
summit of "the brightest minds" in the lottery, would have dropped the Lotto
6/53 game in favor of returning to the more popular Lotto 6/49, with its
better odds.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I am in the process of selecting a new executive director, and will
announce my decision very soon," the Republican governor said in a letter to
the lottery commission, which is composed of Republican administration
appointees.;   Wilson said the new executive director "will have a mandate to
undertake a variety of initiatives that will make the California Lottery the
nation's leader once again.";   Although the commission delayed changes, it
left the way open to call a special meeting on 48 hours' notice in the next
few weeks in case a new director is appointed and wants to move forward with
any proposals.;   Gutierrez, who has held the post since 1987, said that
unless the commission acts in two to three weeks, any game changes might have
to be postponed until next year. The Thanksgiving-Christmas holiday period has
been found to be a poor time for introducing new lottery games.;   Once a
trendy pastime, the California Lottery is now the biggest loser in the lottery
industry nationally, where runaway sales growth is flattening, according to
industry analysts. Annual lottery sales have fallen from a high of $2.6
billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 1989, to $2.1 billion in the
last fiscal year with projections as low as $1.7 billion for 1991.;   National
decline; Though lottery sales have been weakening across the nation,
California's decline has been much sharper. Nationally, lottery sales are
expected to grow no more than 3.5 percent for 1991, after double-digit growth
in recent years, said William Bergman, executive director of the North
American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries. California, though,
saw sales fall 14 percent for its 1991 fiscal year.;   Bergman cited several
reasons for the slowdown in lottery sales nationally: weakness in the national
economy, news about the Persian Gulf war crowding out publicity that the
lottery normally would reap, and California's decision to greatly lengthen the
odds of hitting the lotto jackpot, from one chance in 13 million with Lotto
6/49 to one chance in 23 million with Lotto 6/53. A study presented to the
lottery's commission Tuesday says that the longer Lotto odds have driven
players away from all of the lottery's games.;   James Hosker, president of
the lottery association and head of Kentucky's lottery, said he believes
California sales have lagged for several reasons.;   The lottery's payout in
prizes -- 50 percent -- isn't big enough, he said. Too many prizes must be
claimed weeks after winning, instead of being instantly payable at ticket
agents, he said. And there have been too few games offered at any one time, he
said.;   Revenue to California public education, which gets at least 34
percent of the lottery's gross sales, has dropped as a result of the sales
decline.;   Although lottery funds make up just 3 percent of the budget for
schools, about two-thirds of school districts have rejected state officials'
advice and used the money for ongoing needs rather than supplementary uses.;  
Gutierrez has said he would consider shifting a higher percentage of lottery
revenues to prizes and a lower percentage to schools if it could be
demonstrated that overall revenues would increase. Educators opposed the
suggestion, however.;   Public doubt about the amount of money the
state-sponsored game of chance is pumping into schools has hurt the lottery,
the study presented Tuesday said.;   Education problem; "The constant barrage
of education-crisis stories has raised question's in people's minds about
where the lottery money is going and why the lottery hasn't solved education's
problems," the study said.;   Advertising for the lottery initiative and early
games emphasized money for schools and Gutierrez said people have become
suspicious because education problems were not solved. "The lottery was
oversold," he said.;   Gutierrez said it's not fair to blame him or his staff
or the declining fortunes of the lottery but insisted he is not troubled by
Wilson's decision to replace him or the drawn-out, public search for a new
director.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  California Lottery officials are considering a proposal to reduce the schools'
percentage of lottery proceeds to increase the prize pool, lottery director

only if research indicated it would result in a large enough increase in
ticket sales to offset the lower percentage for schools.  </LEADPARA>

OFFICIALS SAY 6/53 IS STILL A BIG LOSER  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Additional information attached to the end of this article.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     But school officials vowed to oppose any reduction in their share.;   
"Absolutely, we would fight it," said California Superintendent of Public
Instruction Bill Honig. "Tell them to take it out of their share instead.";   
Schools now get 34 percent of all lottery money. Fifty percent is set aside
for prizes, and 16 percent goes to lottery administration.;    In response to
slumping lottery revenues, Gutierrez told the California Lottery Commission on
Wednesday that he would recommend scrapping the Lotto 6/53 game for a format
with better odds of winning.;    At a news conference Thursday, Gutierrez said
changes in the lotto game would be recommended as part of an overhaul of all
lottery games in an attempt to build participation.;    Los Angeles Unified
School District officials, who just cut more than $274 million from their
district's budget, said the district would be devastated by a reduction in
lottery revenues.;    "I'm in such shock I'm still trying to pick my jaw off
the floor," said Los Angeles school board member Julie Korenstein. "It's
absolutely appalling news. We're talking about an 'Alice in Wonderland'
approach to a measure that was passed by the voters precisely to be used for
education.";    In addition to setting aside more money for prizes, Gutierrez
said lottery officials would propose adding games based on themes now
prohibited, such as horse racing and poker.;    Gutierrez said lottery
marketing specialists are studying the feasibility of the various proposals
and said that he will ask the Lottery Commission, at its Sept. 17 meeting, to
endorse those ideas considered most likely to increase lottery revenues.;   
He acknowledged that changing the percentage of revenues going to schools --
which would require approval of the California Legislature -- would not be
easy. But he said the change could be beneficial if it boosts participation in
the games and increases revenues to schools.;    "These things have to be
addressed. It's time to make some changes," Gutierrez said.;    Lottery sales
are in their third consecutive year of decline, after peaking at $2.6 billion
in the 1988-89 fiscal year.;    "Lotto 6/53 produced a world record $118.8
million jackpot and slowed the year-long lotto sales decline that occurred in
the last year of 6/49, but it didn't stop the decline," Gutierrez said.;   
Gutierrez rejected Honig's suggestion to cut the amount of lottery revenues
going to administer the games of chance. Of the 16 cents of every dollar that
goes to administration, he said retailers get 6 cents and the advertising
budget takes 2 cents, leaving 8 cents for administrative costs such as
salaries, ticket printing, and computers.;    Gutierrez told the Lottery
Commission on Wednesday that players were staying away from the 6/53 game
because of a perception that its astronomical odds make it impossible to win.
One lottery commissioner recommended an immediate return to the 6/49 game
abandoned in favor of the 6/53 game in June 1990, but the other commissioners
opted to wait until next month's meeting to take any action.;    The lottery
director said other alternatives that might be considered by the commission
next month include:;    (check) Recommending that the Legislature allow games
now barred under the 1984 initiative that created the lottery, such as games
with horse racing or poker themes. Those prohibitions were included in the
original law to minimize opposition from Nevada casinos.;    (check) Starting
a public relations campaign to inform people where the lottery money goes and
how it helps schools and emphasizing that local school districts are free to
budget it as they see fit.;    (check) Changing the lotto game so that the
public believes it is "more winnable." The odds are 23 million-to-one against
picking six numbers right in the 6/53 game. In the 6/49 game, the odds against
a perfect card were 14 million-to-one.;    (check) Maximizing the amount of
prize money retailers may pay to winners in cash. Winners of $100 or more now
must wait several weeks for the state to determine that the person does not
owe money to the state. Gutierrez proposed raising the instant cash prize
limit to $599, the maximum allowed by the Internal Revenue Service.;   
(check) Selling two chances for $1, rather than at a dollar each, and
elimination of the "quick pick" option. When players use the quick-pick method
and allow a computer to choose their numbers, it tends to distribute the
numbers further across the possible combinations than those chosen by
players.; Putting the spin on lottery; In addition to reducing the percentage
of lottery revenues for schools, the state lottery commission will be asked to
consider:; (box)Recommending that the Legislature allow games currently
barred, such as games with horse racing or poker themes.; (box)Starting a

<LEADPARA>  The state decided Thursday to remake its ailing lottery by scrapping most
games in favor of a lineup that features Super Lotto, designed to give players
better odds of winning a fat jackpot.;   But there are questions about whether
the public will agree it's a super game when it replaces Lotto 6/53 on Dec. 15.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  LOTTERY'S GAME PLAN: SUPER LOTTO IS IN; MOST OTHERS
OUT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Super Lotto, a 6/51 (pick six of 51 numbers) game, will have 1-in-18
million odds, better than Lotto 6/53's 1-in-23 million odds but worse than the
original lotto game's 1-in-14 million odds.;   Officials expect the size of
Super Lotto jackpots to be at least as large as those of the current lotto
game.;   Other games planned for introduction next year or in 1993 include a
pick-five-numbers game, a daily lotto game and a game based on Keno.;  
Officials said many of the designs are based on popular games in other
states.;   Scratch-off ticket games will continue.;   The policy-setting
Lottery Commission voted 4-0 to approve the overhaul, which was proposed by
new director Sharon Sharp.;   "The California Lottery has never reached its
full potential. We have plans in place to take it where it should be," said
Sharp, who was picked by Gov. Pete Wilson to replace former director Chon
Gutierrez in September.;   Longtime board member William Johnston said he
liked the overall plan. "I think the excitement the new director has brought
us is promising," he said.;   The changes were spurred by sagging sales. This
fiscal year, sales have hit just over $500 million -- 25 percent below
projections for 1991-'92.;   Gutierrez and others blamed much of the problem
on the economic recession, but critics cited poor marketing decisions.;   The
lottery, approved by voters in 1984, gives at least 34 percent of its total
revenue to public education. The funds make up less than 3 percent of schools'
budget.;   Until the new games go into effect, Sharp said she was "ready to
beg the players to stick with us." She said there is a negligible budget for
advertising.;   In Super Lotto, there will be no five-plus-bonus category, as
in Lotto 6/53. The match-five numbers prize will be reduced somewhat below the
same category in the current Lotto 6/53, but the match-three and match-four
prizes will continue at their current levels and have improved odds.;   The
other new games in the lineup include "Fantasy 5," a pick five-of-39 game that
will replace Little Lotto, a pick six-of-39 game; a daily pick-three-numbers
game to replace Decco; and a Keno game, in which players will pick odds and
prizes up to $1 million.;   Fantasy 5 is scheduled for introduction in
February 1992, the daily pick-three-numbers game for April 1992, and Keno for
sometime in fiscal 1993.;   Central to plans is winning state controller
permission to pay off larger prizes instantly at the retailer, rather than
forcing players to wait for mailed payoffs from the lottery.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Gov. Pete Wilson stepped directly into the California Lottery crisis Tuesday,
saying he will soon appoint a new director to overhaul the games and freezing
current plans for reversing steep sales declines.;    The policy-setting
Lottery Commission, at Wilson's request, voted 5-0 to delay a proposal by
Executive Director Chon Gutierrez that would have made sweeping changes.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  California News  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  WILSON: NEW LOTTERY CHIEF WILL BE APPOINTED SOON
GOVERNOR SEEKS OVERHAUL TO STOP SLUMPING SALES  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Mercury News Staff Writer Christopher H. Schmitt contributed to this report.; 
SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 9/19/91, pg. 1E);  Because of an editor's
error, a chart in Wednesday's Mercury News gave the wrong figure for
California lottery sales per capita for 1990. The correct figure is $83.10.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     A primary aspect of the plan, which Gutierrez said was compiled by a summit
of "the brightest minds" in the lottery, would have dropped the new Lotto 6/53
game in favor of returning to the more popular Lotto 6/49, with its better
odds.;    "I am in the process of selecting a new executive director, and will
announce my decision very soon," Wilson said in a letter to lottery
commissioners.;    "I must urge . . . the commission to postpone action on
such (major policy change) proposals until they are presented to you by the
next executive director," the Republican governor told the commission, which
is composed of Republican administration appointees.;    Can call special
meeting;  Although the commission delayed changes, it left the way open to
call a special meeting on 48 hours' notice in the next few weeks in case a new
director is appointed and wants to move forward with any proposals.;   
Gutierrez, who has held the post since 1987, said that unless the commission
acts in two to three weeks, any game changes might have to be postponed until
next year. The Thanksgiving-Christmas holiday period has been found to be a
poor time for introducing new lottery games.;    Unprecedented downturns in
sales recently have meant unprecedented cutbacks in the lottery's
administrative operations. The commission Tuesday approved cutting another
$5.5 million from an already pared down 1991-'92 spending plan by slashing
more jobs and the promotions budget.;    Officials can use only up to 16
percent of the lottery's expected total sales of nearly $2 billion for
operations. The figure is set by the 1984 ballot initiative that authorized
the lottery.;    Once a trendy pastime, the California Lottery is now the
biggest loser in the lottery industry nationally, where runaway sales growth
is flattening, according to industry analysts.;    Sharpest decline;    Though
lottery sales have been weakening across the nation, California's decline has
been much sharper. Nationally, lottery sales are expected to grow no more than
3.5 percent for 1991, following double-digit growth in recent years, said
William Bergman, executive director of the North American Association of State
and Provincial Lotteries.;    California, though, saw sales fall 14 percent
for its 1991 fiscal year. The 33 U.S. lotteries in 1990 grossed $20.8 billion,
up 7 percent over the previous year's $19.4 billion. The growth rate slowed
from double-digit gains of 14 percent in 1989 and 30 percent in 1988.;   
Bergman cited several reasons: Weakness in the national economy, news about
the Persian Gulf war crowding out publicity that the lottery normally would
reap, and California's decision to greatly lengthen the odds of hitting the
lotto jackpot.;    "This has not been an easy year for anybody's business,
never mind lotteries," Bergman said.;    James Hosker, president of the
lottery association and head of Kentucky's lottery, said he believes
California sales have lagged for several reasons.;    Payout too small;  The
lottery's payout in prizes -- 50 percent -- isn't big enough, he said. Too
many prizes must be claimed weeks after winning, instead of being instantly
payable at ticket agents, he said. And there have been too few games offered
at any one time, he said.;    "These are the way you sell products," he said.
"I'm out here to sell a product.";    Revenue to California public education,
which gets at least 34 percent of the lottery's gross sales, has dropped as a
result of the sales decline.;    Although lottery funds make up just 3 percent
of the budget for schools, about two-thirds of school districts have rejected
state officials' advice and used the money for ongoing needs rather than
supplementary uses.;    In asking the commission to delay action of current
management's proposals, Wilson said that the new executive director "will have
a mandate to undertake a variety of initiatives that will make the California
Lottery the nation's leader once again.;    "I am sure you will agree . . .
that the next executive director should assume office with as much flexibility
as possible to design new games and reduce unnecessary expenditures," he
said.; CHART: Carl Neiburger -- Mercury News; Lottery woes; Lottery sales ahve

CHANGES PLANNED TO BOOST SIZE OF LOTTO JACKPOTS, KEEP THE DOLLARS FLOWING 
</P>

<P>
In an effort to attract more gamblers, the state Lottery Commission has 
approved changes in the Lotto game designed to generate significantly larger 
jackpots, while lessening the odds of winning. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also approved the introduction of two more lottery games to be 
called Topper and Decco, which are expected to appeal to players who prefer 
something that will give them a better chance of winning, even if the prizes 
are minuscule by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to provide our players with lots of choices, lots of options in 
picking a game that has the odds they want. We want to be able to provide a 
broad range of games that appeal to all our players," said Carolyn Walker, 
publicity manager for the California Lottery. 
</P>
<P>
It is all part of a long-term strategy to get more people to play the lottery 
and keep a steady stream of dollars flowing to the state's education system, 
Walker said. In the 1988-89 state fiscal year, the lottery contributed $1.05 
billion to schools on sales of $2.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Greatest Interest 
</P>
<P>
Walker said officials found the greatest interest in the lottery was generated 
by the big jackpots of $20 million to $30 million, while sales seemed to slump 
when the pot dwindled to $5 million or $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
To create bigger jackpots and cash in on the heightened interest they bring to 
the lottery, the commission has voted to add four more numbers to the field 
that players select from when they buy a Lotto ticket. Beginning in April, for 
each $1 ticket, Lotto players will pick six numbers from a field of 53 instead 
of 49. 
</P>
<P>
With the extra numbers, the odds of winning will change from one in 14 million 
to one in 22 million. The odds of winning any cash prize in the Lotto game will 
go from one in 54 to one in 67. 
</P>
<P>
Walker said officials expect the change in the game to produce more roll-over 
jackpots, or instances when there are no big winners, so that whatever is in 
that day's pot is added to the jackpot for the next drawing. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to maintain the excitement of the Lotto game, we needed to increase 
the field size so we would have more roll-overs," Walker said. "Our sales 
increase very dramatically when we have a very large jackpot." 
</P>
<P>
California has not had a huge jackpot since March when eight winners divided a 
$44.8-million prize. The lottery accumulated its biggest pot in October, 1988, 
when it grew to $62 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lotto game is so popular that well over 50% of the adults in California 
play Lotto on a fairly regular basis," Walker said. "Because of the number of 
players, there were lots of people picking number combinations, so the jackpot 
was being hit frequently, keeping it low. It made our sales a little soft or 
unpredictable." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Free Game 
</P>
<P>
But for those who like a better chance of taking home some cash, the commission 
has created Decco, a new game that will debut in January or February. Players 
will pick a card from each of the four suits in a deck. The lottery computer 
will then also pick a card from each of the suits. 
</P>
<P>
If the player holds the same four picks, he wins $5,000. If he can match three 
of the four, he collects $50. If he matches two of the four, he wins $5. For 
holding one of the four, he gets a free game. His odds of winning top prize in 
the game are one in 28,561. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly different odds will be offered in another new game to be introduced in 
April. Called Topper, the game will piggyback on the Lotto game. After 
purchasing a $1 Lotto ticket, the player will be able to activate Topper for 
another $1. 
</P>
<P>
Under the rules of the game, for each play the computer will automatically pick 
three California cities from a field of 100. At the twice weekly drawings for 
Lotto, there will also be a Topper drawing. Players holding a ticket with all 
three cities picked in the drawing will win $25,000. Those holding two of three 
cities will get $95 and those holding one will collect $2. 
</P>
<P>
The odds of winning $25,000 will be one in 161,700.

THOSE LONGER LOTTO ODDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just as everyone expected, and feared, the California Lottery keeps escalating 
the hysteria level to get more and more people to play. The curious thing about 
the latest move of the California Lottery Commission, however, is that in order 
to get more people to spend more money on the lottery, the commission is making 
it harder to win. 
</P>
<P>
From the outset, players in the Lotto game had to pick the correct six numbers 
from a field of 49 to win the big Saturday prize. Then the commission added a 
Wednesday drawing. Now it is increasing the field from 49 numbers to 53. It 
seems that a prize of $5 million or $10 million is just not sufficient to get 
jaded players to play enough. By increasing the odds, the commission lessens 
the chance of someone winning the Wednesday or Saturday drawing. Thus the prize 
will roll over from one lottery night to the next and build in size. This is 
necessary "to maintain the excitement of the Lotto game," a commission official 
says. Some logic. How big is big enough? Fifty million dollars? A hundred 
million? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps to soften the criticism of making the long Lotto odds even longer, and 
ostensibly to give players all sorts of options, there will be new games that 
allow people to have a greater chance of winning smaller prizes. Even so, the 
odds of winning anything at all in the lottery will increase from 1 in 54 to 1 
in 67. The odds on catching the big Lotto prize will go from 1 in 14 million to 
1 in 22 million. 
</P>
<P>
The frantic lottery ads still tout the benefits to California education from 
playing the lottery. But Neal R. Peirce was correct when he wrote in the 
National Journal earlier this year that state lotteries have become "a massive, 
regressive debilitating tax -- especially on lower-income people." Peirce 
proposed a number of actions to bring lotteries under control that should be 
considered by the California Legislature. One is to ban lottery advertising. 
Another is to cap the size of jackpots. A third is to limit the proliferation 
of lottery outlets, such as the mini-lottery terminals established in some 
California supermarket checkout lines. 
</P>
<P>
The lottery is a sordid adjunct to public policy. Every time the state cranks 
up the hysteria to get more people to play, it becomes just that much more 
sordid.

<LEADPARA>  The California Lottery will introduce a new lotto game -- with better odds and
smaller prizes -- in mid-March in response to requests by customers, officials
said Tuesday.;    The game will offer a top prize of $500,000, to be paid in
one lump sum, said lottery spokeswoman Cynthia Moore. If more than one person
wins, each will get the half-million lump sum -- unless more than 20 people
win, in which case the prizes will be smaller, she said.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The new game, unofficially dubbed Little Lotto, will require players to
match six numbers randomly chosen from a field of 39 numbers, Moore said, with
odds of 1 in 3,262,623.;    That compares with a field of 53 numbers for the
current lotto game, which will continue. The current lotto game recently was
expanded to 53 numbers from 49, increasing the odds from 1 in 14 million to 1
in 23 million. Lottery officials said the higher odds increase the likelihood
of bigger jackpots, and therefore more players.;    There will be no bonus
number in the new game, but a $2,000 prize will be offered for picking five of
six numbers, with odds of 1 in 16,478. Picking four of six will be worth $50,
with odds of 1 in 412. Picking three of six will be worth $3, with 1-in-30
odds.;    The name of the new game and the exact date it will begin are being
kept secret until the lottery makes a formal announcement, Moore said.;   
Drawings will be held at 7:57 p.m. on Tuesdays and Fridays, while the Lotto
6/53 game will continue its Wednesday and Saturday drawings.;    Officials
said the game is not being introduced to bolster sagging revenues -- although
they concede revenues have been sagging.;    Ten other states have both big
and little lotto games, and "the performance range is really huge," said
Joanne McNabb, the lottery's director of public affairs. Because of that
uncertainty, the state is looking initially for a "very low-level" return from
the new game.;    McNabb said lottery revenues for this fiscal year are
expected to be $2.15 billion, including the new game. In fiscal 1990, revenues
were $2.48 billion.;    Given uncertain economic times, the games are "holding
their own," Moore said.;    But "holding their own" translates into smaller
revenues for schools. In fiscal 1990, the schools' share was $980 million. The
estimate for this fiscal year is $762 million.;    Last year, in addition to
changing the big lotto game, lottery officials introduced Decco, in which
players seek a $5,000 top prize by trying to match four playing cards drawn by
the lottery.;    Decco also was an attempt to boost sales by adding games to
appeal to more players, after customers said they wanted frequent drawings,
lots of smaller prizes instead of a big jackpot like lotto, and familiar
symbols that aren't numbers.;    After an initially strong response, Decco
sales dropped off.  </TEXT>

   Luck Is Running Out at Some Lotteries,
   As Competition and Boredom Take Toll

   Lotteries for years have pushed dreams of easy millions,
both for bettors and the states that sell tickets to
potential fame and fortune. But, like more pedestrian
businesses, state lotteries are beginning to feel the effects
of increased competition and plain old customer boredom.
   Since lotteries were introduced in the mid-1960s, states
have distilled the public's lust for instant riches into a
bonanza for cash-strapped coffers. Lottomania has swept 33
states and the District of Columbia, pumping more than $7
billion into education, senior citizens' programs and other
causes last year alone. Estimated 1990 sales rose to a record
$20 billion, although the approximate 6% increase was the
smallest since 1987 and resulted largely from new states
starting games.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While new lotteries usually enjoy robust double-digit
growth for a while, the real trick is producing steady growth
once the novelty wears off. "There are people who think
lotteries are in a world by themselves, but they're not
immune to the laws of the marketplace," says Saul F. Leonard,
a gambling industry consultant in Los Angeles who works with
state lotteries. And lottery officials, who are looking for
new games and technologies that can produce solid long-term
growth, warn that there aren't any quick fixes.
   In the short term, many lottery officials say the
recession is chipping away at customers' discretionary
spending, debunking the old myth that gambling is
recessionproof. While executives say it's difficult to know
just how damaging the recession will be, it's clearly
affecting lottery sales in New York and a number of other
states.
   Although lotteries are a form of gambling, they compete
directly with movies, video rentals and other discretionary
purchases for the consumer's entertainment dollar. The
expansion of riverboat gambling, Indian bingo, off-track
betting and other forms of gambling may also hurt.
   "Lottery growth is continuing, but in many cases it's not
meeting expectations," says William S. Bergman, executive
director of the North American Association of State and
Provincial Lotteries. While new lotteries are continuing to
do well, he says, "for the more mature lotteries, especially
those in the Northeast and the Rust Belt, things are
softening a bit."
   Total sales in California dropped to $2.47 billion in the
year ended June 30 from $2.62 billion the prior year,
although lottery officials say the decline has leveled off
since last summer. Iowa's sales dropped about 2% to $169.5
million last year, while such other states as Pennsylvania
have also shown declines in the past year.
   In several states, lotto game sales are declining, but the
drop is being offset somewhat by increases in other games.
Peter D. Lynch, director of the New York lottery, thinks
higher gasoline prices are a prime suspect in the sharp
falloff of state lotto sales since last summer. "Someone who
spent $15 to fill up the gasoline tank and $5 in lottery
tickets is now spending $22 to fill up the tank," Mr. Lynch
says. Lotto sales have dropped 8% since last summer, he
estimates.
   The problems affecting the New York lottery, long
considered one of the nation's most successful, are typical
of those bedeviling mature lotteries. Tight-fisted state
officials slashed the lottery's ad budget 40% this fiscal
year. A special promotion in January produced a spectacular
$90 million jackpot, and officials hoped it would pump up
sales by grabbing big headlines. But hardly a word appeared
in the press because of coverage of the war. Nonetheless, Mr.
Lynch expects sales to hit $2.1 billion this year, up from
$1.92 billion in the year ended March 31.
   Bigger jackpots alone no longer guarantee player interest,
experts say. And serious gamblers have always argued that
lotteries are a lousy bet: The odds of picking the correct
six of 53 numbers, for example, are a staggering 23 million
to one. Many lotteries operate under guidelines similar to
those governing California's lottery, which allocates at
least 34% of sales to public schools, 50% to players and a
maximum of 16% to retailer commissions and other expenses.
   Given those odds, many lotteries are shifting their
pitches from "become an instant millionaire" to the fun of
playing. "We stress winning too much," says Jim Davey,
director of the Oregon lottery and president of Lotto
America, a lottery game that is played in several smaller
states. "We haven't done a good job in positioning it as
entertainment."
   The Oregon lottery was a pioneer in a new generation of
lottery games when it started the nation's first sports pool
games last year. The games fell short of expectations, and
faced formidable opposition from the National Football League
and the National Basketball Association, which are fighting
in Congress and individual states to block lottery sports
betting.
   Many experts believe sports games could help lottery
growth, but most say new technologies hold greater promise.
South Dakota is among the first to try video lottery
terminals, which offer instant results and have proved
popular with players. But many lottery directors worry about
a public outcry over video terminals, which some might think
blur the line between traditional lotto and "hard" gambling.
   The format that may hold the greatest potential -- and
faces the biggest hurdles -- is an interactive telephone
lottery. A group of lottery directors is exploring a
multi-state lottery that would let players gain access to the
game from their telephones. A television show tie-in would
provide the excitement and "player engagement" that makes
casino gambling so popular.
   "Phone interactive is one of a very, very few remaining
big-time events for lotteries," says Sharon Sharp, director
of the $1.6 billion Illinois lottery and a leading proponent
of the game. Mrs. Sharp acknowledges that political
opposition could be formidable but notes that lotteries are
by their nature controversial.
   Chon Gutierrez, who oversees the nation's biggest lottery
in California, believes the key to growth isn't in new games
but in making lotteries more accessible to players. "The key
to the future of the lottery is in broadening the player
base," Mr. Gutierrez says. "We have to minimize the hurdles
that force the occasional player to go out of his way to
play."
   Despite the slowdown in lottery growth, the games seem
certain to spread. Resistance to lotteries has succumbed to a
need for revenue even in such conservative states as
Louisiana, and experts bet that other Bible Belt states and
Texas won't be far behind. "When their financial situation
becomes stressful enough, you'll see gambling come through,"
says Mr. Leonard.
   In fact, lottery officials say, some cities are looking at
lotteries as a possible way of stemming their own flood of
red ink, either by tapping into their state's lottery or
starting up a separate municipal game, a move likely to meet
heated opposition from state games. New York City considered
a 25-cent surcharge on ticket sales and even wanted to start
its own scratchoff lottery game, but the Legislature didn't
approve them. Industry experts say the issues are bound to
recur as fiscal crises deepen around the nation.
   As lotteries enter their next phase, some worry that
states may seek a higher payoff for themselves. "Expectations
are so high," says Illinois's Mrs. Sharp. "But if we see
states get too greedy for lottery dollars, it can hurt."
Increasingly, lotteries find themselves stuck in the
political crossfire among legislatures, constituents and
state leaders as they search for cash cows to supplement
shrinking tax bases.
   Mr. Lynch of the New York lottery says the current
slowdown in lottery growth proves clearly that "there's a
limit to the public's discretionary spending on all forms of
entertainment, and lotteries in particular." But considering
the huge "gray market" for such activities as video poker
machines, he adds, "there's still plenty of room for
lotteries to grow without reaching a saturation point."

<LEADPARA>  California lottery officials are considering a proposal to reduce the schools'
percentage of lottery proceeds in order to increase the prize pool, lottery
director Chon Gutierrez said.;    Gutierrez said Thursday he would support the
plan only if research indicated it would result in a large enough increase in
ticket sales to offset the lower percentage for schools.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  LOTTERY OFFICIALS INVESTIGATE PLAN TO RAISE
PRIZES BY CUTTING SHARES GIVEN TO SCHOOLS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  California News.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     But school officials vowed to oppose any reduction in their share.;   
"Absolutely, we would fight it," said California Superintendent of Public
Instruction Bill Honig. "Tell them to take it out of their share instead.";   
Schools now get 34 percent of all lottery money. Fifty percent is set aside
for prizes and 16 percent goes to lottery administration.;    In response to
slumping lottery revenues, Gutierrez told the California Lottery Commission on
Wednesday that he would recommend scrapping the Lotto 6/53 game for a format
with better odds of winning.;    At a news conference Thursday, Gutierrez said
the changes in the lotto game would be recommended as part of a major overhaul
of all lottery games in an attempt to build participation.;    Los Angeles
Unified School District officials, who just cut more than $274 million from
their district's budget, said the district would be devastated by a reduction
in lottery revenues.;    "I'm in such shock I'm still trying to pick my jaw
off the floor," said Los Angeles school board member Julie Korenstein. "It's
absolutely appalling news. We're talking about an 'Alice in Wonderland'
approach to a measure that was passed by the voters precisely to be used for
education.";    "It's absurd," said Mark Slavkin, another Los Angeles school
board member. "If it goes into place it exposes the folly of using the lottery
to finance public education in the first place, the ridiculousness of making
school children dependent on the gambling habits of California's citizens.";  
 In addition to setting aside more money for prizes, Gutierrez said lottery
officials would propose adding games based on themes now prohibited, such as
horse racing and poker.;    Gutierrez said lottery marketing specialists are
studying the feasibility of the various proposals, and said that he will ask
the Lottery Commission, at its Sept. 17 meeting, to endorse those ideas
considered most likely to increase lottery revenues.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  The state lottery as Californians know it soon may be history.;   New lottery
chief Sharon Sharp will go to the Lottery Commission today with her specific
plan to dump virtually all existing California Lottery games and give the
ailing system a fresh start.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  California News  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  PROPOSAL TO REVAMP LOTTERY GAMES TO BE HEARD TODAY
IN SACRAMENTO  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "Yes, my proposal will suggest that," Sharp confirmed Wednesday. The
five-member commission is expected to vote today whether to approve Sharp's
plans for new games.;   While Sharp declined to disclose specific proposals
for new games before the board has had a chance to consider them, lottery
officials said the current Lotto 6/53 and 6/39 Little Lotto, as well as Decco
and Topper, would get the boot.;   The only game that would continue is
Scratchers, the cards from which players rub a coating to see if they are
instant winners. Sharp said the Scratcher games will be expanded.;   It is a
good bet that the California Lottery will end up with games similar to those
that have been successful in Illinois and other states.;   Sharp, who has been
on the job a little more than a month, is the former director of the Illinois
lottery, where she gained a reputation for hard work, aggressive marketing and
positive results. She was appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson to run the California
gaming agency, which has been in a downward spiral for two years.;   "There
are only basically so many lottery games," Sharp said. "When you select, you
select generally from games that have been successful in other states. You
select from what you already know or you've used before. You do some refining,
and you tailor-make it to your state.";   Two daily drawing games, where
players pick three or four numbers, have been successful in Illinois.;   "They
are very, very popular games . . . in many states," Sharp said. She said the
daily games also have been mentioned most often by California players as
something they want to play.;   Sharp said she is a firm believer in corporate
or sports tie-ins to instant lottery games and has used them a lot throughout
the years. She mentioned Pepsi, United Airlines and the Chicago Bulls as
examples.;   In the case of United Airlines, she said, the airline contributed
trips and shared advertising costs in games called Cash and Fly. With the
lottery contributing cash, she said, "You give your players an added value on
their tickets. . . . between the two of us, you had a really great game.";  
Sally Simonds, director of promotions and game operations for the Sacramento
Kings, confirmed she has spoken with Sharp about the possibility of a lottery
tie-in with the basketball team.;   "We'd love to do something with the
lottery," Simonds said. "We will be meeting with them (lottery officials)."  </TEXT>

   Gamblers and dreamers watched the bucks pile
up and the clock tick Tuesday while the jackpot for Wednesday
night's California lottery drawing crept closer to a North American
record.
   Customers lined up at liquor stores, truck stops and neighborhood
markets throughout the state and lotery officials jacked up their
estimate of the Lotto 6-49 jackpot to $53 million.
   That's still shy of the all-time California record of $61.98
million, which was set by the Lotto 6-49 game Oct. 29, 1988, with
the jackpot was split among three winning tickets.
   Pennsylvania claims the North American record payoff with a
$115.5 million jackpot in April 1989. The prize was split among 14
winning tickets.
   The Lotto 6-49 game sold exactly 1,064,388 tickets, at $1 each,
between 11 a.m. and noon Tuesday. ``And that's not even our busiest
time of the day, by any means,'' said Lottery spokeswoman Joanne
McNabb.
   By 3 p.m., sales were $7.4 million, Ms. McNabb said.
   Lotto officials and 7,900 retailers across the state braced for
the evening rush as Californians motored home from work.
   The jackpot in the twice-weekly game has gone unclaimed since
Aug. 26. Monday's sales reached $8.2 million, more than six times
the usual Monday sales _ but again short of the one-day record of
$31.5 million, set the day of the October 1988 drawing.
   Even with the odds of winning at one in 14 million, the chance
for instant megabucks attracted people who don't usually play the
game, and some out-of-staters.
   ``More people who normally don't play do play when the jackpot's
big,'' said Ms. McNabb, noting that regular players account for more
than half of ticket sales in non-rollover weeks.
   Ed Gentalen, an architect from Fullerton, Calif., filled out
tickets with two friends at Lee's Liquors in downtown Los Angeles.
   ``I hardly ever play this,'' he said as they worked on 30
tickets. ``But 50 million dollars is getting me into it.'' He
described his chances as ``about one in a zillion.''
   About 150 hopefuls jammed the Wills Fargo Country Store in Baker,
a town on Interstate 15 about 45 miles from the Nevada border.
   ``Oh yeah, everybody's going for that big dream,'' said manager
Steve Zwerner. ``It's packed. They're going down one aisle, back up
another aisle and across another,'' he said.
   Most who came to Wills Fargo, one of the biggest Lotto ticket
sellers in the state, were from Nevada, Zwerner said. On Tuesday,
they began waiting at 5 a.m., an hour before sales began.
   ``Many of them just came, bought their tickets and got back to
Vegas,'' he said.
   Lotto officials have extended sales by an hour nightly, to 11
p.m. Sales will end at 7:45 p.m. Wednesday, exactly 13 minutes
before seven numbered balls will drop into a slot, determining the
winner or winners, if any.
   The winner or winners will enjoy their earnings in 20 annual
installments.

<LEADPARA>  The California Lottery will introduce a new Lotto game -- with better odds and
smaller prizes -- in mid-March in response to requests by customers, officials
said today.;    The game will offer a top prize of $500,000, to be paid in one
lump sum, said lottery spokeswoman Cynthia Moore. If more than one person
wins, each will get the half-million lump sum -- unless more than 20 people
win, in which case the prizes will be smaller, she said.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The new game, unofficially dubbed "Little Lotto," will require players to
match six numbers randomly chosen from a field of 39 numbers, Moore said, with
odds of 1 in 3,262,623.;    That compares to a field of 53 numbers for the
current Lotto game, which will continue. The current Lotto game recently was
expanded to 53 numbers from 49, increasing the odds from 1 in 14 million to 1
in 23 million. Lottery officials said the higher odds increase the likelihood
of bigger jackpots, and therefore more players.;    There will be no bonus
number in the new game, but a $2,000 prize will be offered for picking five of
six numbers, with odds of 1 in 16,478. Picking four of six will be worth $50,
with odds of 1 in 412. Picking three of six will be worth $3, with 1-in-30
odds.;    Drawings for the new game will be held at 7:57 p.m. on Tuesdays and
Fridays, while the Lotto 53 game will continue its Wednesday and Saturday
drawings.;    Officials said the game is not being introduced to bolster
sagging revenues -- although they concede revenues have been sagging.;    Ten
other states have both big and little lotto games, and "the performance range
is really huge," said Joanne McNabb, the lottery's director of public affairs.
Because of that uncertainty, the state is looking initially for a "very
low-level" return from the new game.;    McNabb said lottery revenues for this
fiscal year are expected to be $2.15 billion, including the new game. In the
1989-90 fiscal year, revenues were $2.48 billion.;    Given uncertain economic
times, the games are "holding their own," Moore said.;    But "holding their
own" translates into smaller revenues for schools. In the 1989-90 fiscal year,
the schools' share was $980 million. The estimate for this fiscal year is $762
million.;    Last year, in addition to changing the big Lotto game, lottery
officials introduced Decco.  </TEXT>

He may have been standing in a 15-minute line to buy $4 worth of lottery 
tickets on a lark Friday, but Harry Anderson denied he was buying into 
"Lottomania." He said he knows his chances of winning the $40-million jackpot 
are one in 14 million. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents and grandparents would be spinning in their graves if they knew the 
government was taking the poor people's money like this," said Anderson, a 
computer programmer from South Pasadena, while waiting his turn at the Olympic 
gift shop in Los Angeles' Little Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
But Anderson and millions of other Lotto players up and down the state queued 
in pharmacies, liquor stores, markets, restaurants and convenience stores in 
pursuit of the third-largest payoff since the California Lottery began. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Rexsteiner, owner of an Anaheim convenience store, said the Lotto rush 
started early Friday as morning commuters stopped in for coffee. 
</P>
<P>
"From 6 to 8 in the morning we sold a lot more Lotto (tickets) and Quick Pick 
because of the fact that the pot is large," Rexsteiner said. "We've had no 
lines, but there's been a lot of activity all day." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difference in Strategies 
</P>
<P>
David Mejia, a convenience market clerk in Costa Mesa, said he has noticed a 
difference in the buying strategies of his Lotto customers. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had as many people as we expected, but those who have come in buy 
$20 or $30 worth of tickets, much more than they normally buy," Mejia said. 
</P>
<P>
Although both Mejia and Rexsteiner say they like playing Lotto, only Rexsteiner 
had already purchased a "winning ticket." 
</P>
<P>
"I've got this one wrapped up already," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lucille Jackson, who lives on disability payments, bought two lottery tickets 
at the Palace International Cafeteria on San Francisco's Market Street, where 
the line of hopeful customers stretched out into the street. 
</P>
<P>
"With this $2 I could have bought another blouse at Goodwill," she said. "But . 
. . they say once in your life you are supposed to experiences riches. I 
haven't yet." 
</P>
<P>
The stakes began to swell this week as Wednesday's $22-million jackpot went 
unclaimed, marking the third game in a row without a winner. The prize money 
was rolled over into today's game, which is expected to provide $40 million for 
the person or persons, if any, able to pick all six winning numbers. 
</P>
<P>
California Lottery spokeswoman Joanne McNabb said the prize, although far less 
than October's world record of $61.98 million, would be the eighth-largest 
lottery jackpot ever awarded in the United States. Four of the top 10 jackpots 
nationwide have been won in California, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Ticket sales Thursday reached $3.9 million, far more than the $1.5 average 
revenue for that day of the week, McNabb said. Lotto playing hours were 
extended for an extra hour Friday, to 11 p.m, but officials said they expected 
the longest lines to materialize at 6 p.m. today, one hour and 45 minutes 
before closing.

$40 a Month

Meanwhile, at the Columbus Pharmacy in Los Angeles' Chinatown, Dave Osborn, a 
plumber from Newport Beach, said he has been shelling out $5 a week for tickets 
since the lottery's inception. He has won only once -- collecting $5. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps he could have spent the money on a vacation, he mused. Yet he said he 
has no regrets. "I figure I could blow $5 on something a lot worse than a 
chance to win $40 million," he said.

LOTTERY SALES SLUMP WILL REDUCE SHARE TO EDUCATION 
</P>

<P>
The failure of a new Lotto game to produce a record-breaking jackpot combined 
with a softening economy has caused a sales slump at the California Lottery 
that officials predicted Friday could reduce the game's contribution to 
education next year by as much as $280 million. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the lower than expected sales already have forced them to cut 
$59 million from their administrative budget by severely reducing advertising, 
declaring a hiring freeze and postponing equipment purchases. 
</P>
<P>
"We are cutting as close to the bone as we can," said Joanne McNabb, the 
lottery's public affairs director. "It's what many businesses are going through 
now. Any business whose sales are down below expectations is looking to cut." 
</P>
<P>
McNabb said sales, totaling $880 million since the beginning of this fiscal 
year, are 5% below the goal for the period. Given this trend, coupled with 
expectations that the economy will continue to decline, McNabb said officials 
are estimating that total sales by the end of the fiscal year will range from 
$2 billion to $2.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
That would provide only $700 million to $800 million for education next year as 
compared to the $980 million the lottery provided this year, McNabb said. Under 
state law, the lottery must allocate at least 34% of its revenues to education. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Lange, public relations director for the California Department of 
Education, said the drop in lottery money would come at a time when schools are 
experiencing tremendous enrollment growth. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be really damaging to districts especially now when many of them have 
become dependent on their lottery money because of the lack of revenue from the 
state," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the lottery was intended to provide "extras" for school districts, but 
many districts in recent years have used proceeds to provide "necessities" as a 
way of balancing their budgets. 
</P>
<P>
McNabb said officials are attributing the slow lottery sales to the same 
nemesis that dogs many of their players -- bad luck. The Lotto game was changed 
in midsummer to produce more of the big jackpots that drive up sales. While the 
change provided some very large jackpots -- four were more than $30 million 
since July 1 -- it did not produce the super jackpots of $70 million or more 
that drive sales up significantly, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We did have a turnaround in the downward trend of Lotto sales and that was a 
good sign," McNabb said. "It just went more slowly then we would like." 
</P>
<P>
In other states that have changed their Lotto games, she said the big explosion 
in sales did not come until there was a jackpot that broke the record for that 
state. In California, the biggest jackpot has been $68 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike many other businesses in this economy," McNabb said, "we have a luck 
factor. What's happened in other states is that the sooner they've hit a record 
jackpot after the change (in Lotto), the sooner their sales have taken off. 
It's our bad luck that we haven't had that." 
</P>
<P>
The change in the game required players to choose six numbers from a field of 
53 instead of 49, making it nearly twice as hard for players to win but also 
adding to the potential size of the prizes. 
</P>
<P>
McNabb said officials also believe economic conditions have been a sales 
factor, but they have no way of determining how much of a factor. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that our lottery has been in an economic downturn," she 
said. "This is new territory for us." 
</P>
<P>
Within the agency, McNabb said advertising will take a particular hit as a 
result of the sales slump. She said television advertising of Decco and Topper, 
two games of chance introduced this year, has been stopped and the advertising 
of Lotto, which produces two-thirds of the lottery's revenue, has been reduced. 
</P>
<P>
She said 50 vacant positions in the department have not been filled and will be 
recommended for elimination. 
</P>
<P>
McNabb said officials believe the volume of lottery ticket sales could rise 
dramatically if there is a record-breaking jackpot or if a game to be 
introduced next spring does exceptionally well. The game, to be called Little 
Lotto, would allow players to chose six numbers from a field of 39. The top 
prize would be $500,000 paid immediately in cash. The Lotto jackpots are paid 
over a 20-year period. 
</P>
<P>
McNabb said revenue projections for Little Lotto have been conservative because 
similar games have had mixed results in other states.

surpassed national record, winning numbers. Picks up 10th graf pvs

   Lottery players streamed to ticket outlets
across California Saturday, hoping to pick the winning numbers in a
national record jackpot estimated at $51.2 million.
   By the time the drawing took place Saturday night, the odds of
winning were about one in 14 million, said state lottery officials.
As usual, lottery computers will not determine whether anyone has
won the jackpot until Sunday. A winner would not be verified until
Monday.
   Ticket sales on Saturday alone reached more than $33 million, a
one-day all time high, lottery spokesman Bob Taylor said.
   ``At 4 p.m., our ticket sales pushed the lotto prize past $46
million,'' he said, ``past the Pennsylvania record.''
   The nation's previous richest lottery prize, $46 million, was
awarded in Pennsylvania in October. The biggest previous California
jackpot, $25.4 million, was split by two players in October.
   ``There's no way we could have predicted anything like this,''
Taylor said in releasing the anticipated sum and a statement from
Lottery Director Chon Gutierrez calling sales a ``phenomenal tidal
wave.''
   Many stores brought in extra help to keep up with ticket sales.
   ``I cannot handle it. Too many people,'' said Paul Lee, owner of
the New Lun Wah grocery store in San Francisco's Chinatown, where 50
people lined up for tickets Saturday morning.
   ``It's been crazy,'' said Alex Lichine, manager of Lichine's
Liquor, Deli and Catering store in Sacramento. ``It's going to get
worse. Everybody's playing today. Everybody's playing four or five
times more than normal.''
   Ticket buyers forked over dollars at the rate of $2 million per
hour statewide, said lottery spokesman John Schade.
   A player beating the 1-in-14 million odds of winning the jackpot,
which began growing when there were no winners in several previous
drawings of the Lotto 6-49 game, would receive the money, after
federal taxes, in an annuity paid over 20 years.
   The actual size of the jackpot depended on how many tickets were
sold.
   The winning numbers, six of 49, were picked in a 7:56 p.m.
drawing in Sacramento. They were: 48, 42, 9, 14, 19, 31. The bonus
number was 37.
   ``I tell you the sky's the limit today. We had almost $5 million
(in ticket sales) at 10 o'clock today,'' said Taylor. ``Last
Saturday at this time we had $904,000. These figures are just mind
boggling.''
   As the game heated up, a Los Angeles psychologist cautioned
players not to fall victim to what he called ``lottery fantasy
syndrome.''
   ``People purchase a ticket, ignore the odds and start thinking of
the impossible: quitting their jobs, buying items that they have
always wanted, going places that they have never been, and some even
think of divorcing their spouses and starting their lives completely
over,'' said Robert Butterworth.
   The jackpot lured players across state and national borders.
   Leo Gronich, owner of Garlan's Inc., a Calexico department store
with a currency exchange, said some players were Mexicans trading
pesos for tickets. Oregon residents drove south to Yreka, Calif.,
for tickets, said clerk Dan Jerden at Sports and Spirits.
   At Tahoe Tom's in South Lake Tahoe, the fat pot drew Nevada
residents across the border, three blocks away.
   ``We were joking yesterday that it would be funny to have the
(ticket) line up to the state line and have the casino executives
wonder what's going on,'' said owner Tom Erickson.
   What to do with the enormous sum?
   ``Party forever,'' said Leslie Beagle, 43, of Riverside, as she
plunked down $10 for her shot at the jackpot.
   ``You'd probably have to take six months off to think about it,''
said Bill Masterson, 46, of South Lake Tahoe, who planned to buy
five tickets.

JOSEPH N. BELL: HE'S AN ODDS-ON FAVORITE TO NEVER WIN LOTTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By JOSEPH N. BELL

<P>
I gamble whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
In high school in Ft. Wayne, Ind., poker was our favorite pastime after sports 
and girls. In flight training, I used to bet with the guy sitting next to me in 
chapel whether the next hymn would be an odd or even number. In college, my 
roommate and I ran a football card operation briefly -- until two men wearing 
snap brim hats pulled up in front of our rooming house in a black sedan and 
suggested we cease and desist or we might get our legs broken. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the most fortuitous thing that has happened to me in recent years is 
the escalating air fare to Las Vegas that has limited my trips there to two or 
three a year. 
</P>
<P>
With a weakness like this, it would seem to follow that I am sorely tempted to 
put the mortgage money at risk by plunging it into the California Lottery. 
</P>
<P>
But actually I'm not tempted. I seldom play the lottery -- and never the Lotto 
game -- and don't read those periodic newspaper stories about the janitor in 
Garden Grove or the waitress in Anaheim who won $50 million or some such 
staggering sum by correctly guessing six random numbers. I demand two things 
when I gamble: a game that requires some small element of skill and a game in 
which the odds give me at least a fighting chance of winning. Since neither of 
these conditions prevail in the California Lottery, I don't play it. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't stop me from being fascinated by the psychological 
manipulation that goes on to pull more players into the game. And the most 
recent ploy has puzzled as much as it has intrigued me. I'm talking about the 
decision on the part of the people who run the California Lottery to increase 
the bank of numbers to be drawn from their Lotto game. This has the 
simultaneous effect of reducing even further the almost astronomical odds 
against the players while increasing the jackpot prize because it won't be 
claimed as often. 
</P>
<P>
From my perspective, it would seem that the best way to increase the number of 
players would be to shrink the bank of numbers and divide the prize pool into 
smaller but much more numerous prizes, thus materially increasing the chance of 
winning. But the people who buy Lotto tickets apparently don't think that way. 
And sales figures strongly support this assumption. 
</P>
<P>
When the Lotto jackpot hit $55 million recently, two men brought four $5,000 
cashier's checks into a liquor store and spent the whole day punching 20,000 
tickets. They lost. Ticket retailers in Orange County reported that sales were 
from five to 15 times the normal amount because of the record jackpot. 
Thousands of workers went without lunch to stand in line and buy tickets. One 
of them was quoted in The Times saying: "Where can you go in this world and 
possibly come away with $50 million. This might be my lucky day." 
</P>
<P>
The odds are about 14 million to 1 that it won't. 
</P>
<P>
The question that baffles me is: Why is it that when the Lotto odds go up, the 
number of players increases? And in our society today, when such a question 
arises, you go to a shrink. So I did. 
</P>
<P>
I asked this question of Dr. Edward R. Kaufman, a practicing psychiatrist in 
Orange County and professor of psychiatry at the UCI Medical School who 
specializes in addictive behavior. Kaufman points out, first of all, that 
people addicted to gambling are usually addicted to other things as well -- and 
that this addictive behavior probably doesn't apply to most of the people who 
buy lottery and Lotto tickets each month. 
</P>
<P>
"The average lottery player," he said, "is probably relatively poor and hoping 
to pull down the big money. The small bettor figures, 'What the hell, it's only 
a buck.' So he gives them his buck or two or three 52 times a year. He doesn't 
look at the odds. To him, the size of the jackpot is all that's important. 
</P>
<P>
"People like that, you offer to bet them 10,000 to 1 for a million dollars and 
2 to 1 for five bucks, they'll take the long odds every time. How else can they 
get rich? Their fantasy is 50 million bucks, not $500." 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman didn't, however, preclude real gamblers from going for the big Lotto 
killing. He said that the man who bought 20,000 tickets "sounds like a true 
compulsive gambler, out of control." And he described a patient who, after 
prolonged treatment, "has given up all his compulsions -- drugs, drinking, even 
his weekly poker game. But the one thing he hasn't given up is the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
"He thinks he has control. The compulsion is dormant but he satisfies it for 
the moment with the lottery. But once he allows this kind of thinking, there's 
a great danger he'll be headed right back where he was. Gamblers gamble for the 
high and for the fantasy. And most people look at the big money and not at the 
odds. This is part of the self-destructiveness of gamblers." 
</P>
<P>
Now don't get me wrong. I have no objection to winning $50 million. It would 
probably blight my life, but I'm willing to give it a shot. It's one of those 
life conundrums that I'd be perfectly willing to risk. But even for a buck, I 
can't bring myself to think this way. It isn't that I could put the buck to 
better use someplace else; that's not why I'm holding back. It's just that I 
react badly to scams, and 14-million-to-1 odds is a colossal scam. 
</P>
<P>
So I'll play blackjack in Vegas and pick a few football point spreads here and 
there and play poker whenever anyone invites me -- as long as they don't play 
one-eyed jacks and red queens wild. I'll never make $50 million that way, but 
I'll also never have to go to sleep at night trying to remember a half-dozen 
sets of numbers that aren't going to win anyway.

<LEADPARA>  Frank Briltz can't believe his luck at the Lariat Bowl in Red Bluff.;    Three
months ago, Briltz, 75, married his wife Sharon -- whom he met at the bowling
alley.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  10 TICKETS STRIKE IT RICH IN LOTTO  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Then, Wednesday night, Briltz learned he and 30 bowling friends held a
winning ticket in California's bank-busting lottery drawing and will split a
national-record jackpot of $118.8 million.;    Lottery officials today said
that 10 tickets were sold with the winning numbers of 1, 7, 16, 19, 26, 53.
The bonus number was 52.;    Each ticket would be worth $11.9 million and
would be paid out in approximately $470,000 installments a year after taxes.
Winners are paid in equal annual checks for 20 years.;    That's a lot more
than what the 31 customers and employees of the Lariat Bowl will get -- nearly
$15,500 a year after taxes -- but they aren't complaining.;    Other winning
tickets were purchased in Santa Cruz, Hawthorne, Stockton, Lancaster, Culver
City, Anaheim, Los Angeles, Fontana and Victorville, officials said.;   
Wednesday's jackpot topped the previous record of a $115.58 million prize set
in Pennsylvania in 1989. But it was not a world record. Spain has an annual
lottery that reached $1 billion, said lottery spokeswoman Joanne McNabb.;   
Wednesday's ticket sales also set a record -- $54 million in one day, she
said.;    Briltz, the oldest member of the pool, said he broke out in a cold
sweat and goose bumps when the happy news was announced at the bowling alley
Wednesday night. Red Bluff is 130 miles north of Sacramento.;    "I feel
great, but I'm scared," he said. "I know so many poor people and I've been a
poor man. I'm afraid that people will be bouncing on me for money.";    This
morning he said he's not making any plans for the money but admitted he'd like
to use some of his winnings for a honeymoon.;    The retired heavy-equipment
operator said he'd also like to pay off his house, but beyond that he's
waiting till he actually has the money in his hands.;    "I'll be satisfied
with whatever I get," he said.;    Bob and Patty Funk also were in the bowling
alley lotto pool and put in $10 to help purchase 310 tickets. Patty Funk works
as a cook at the bowling alley.;    "Hey, I'm retired and this is going to
come in at the right time," said Bob Funk, 63. "We're going to enjoy it; this
only happens once in a lifetime.";    A man claimed to hold the Hawthorne
ticket but declined to reveal his name.;    "I guess he's a private person,"
said Frank Kumamoto, owner of the Blue Bird Liquor Store in Hawthorne where
the unidentified man bought his ticket.;    The store has been the site of
three other big lottery wins, he said. A $4.5 million prize went unclaimed;
one customer won a $1.27 million prize; and another ticket paid $110,000.;   
With news of the store's luck spreading quickly, the place was a mob scene
today with customers lining up to buy tickets for the next jackpot, Kumamoto
said. "It's like a party.";    Kumamoto said he sold 27,000 lottery tickets
Wednesday alone compared to 20,000 that are sold in an average week.;   
Lottery officials said 24 tickets in Wednesday night's drawing had five of six
numbers plus the bonus number; each ticket was worth $254,882. Bay Area
winners were sold in Sunnyvale, Oakland and Cupertino.;    A total of 1,361
tickets had five of six numbers, claiming $4,494 apiece, while 84,034 tickets
had four of six numbers and were worth $66. A total of 1,674,838 tickets had
three of six number and won $5 each.;    The Topper cities were Palo Alto,
Vallejo and Ventura.;    Officials said the jackpot for Saturday's draw would
be $5 million. Total sales for the draw were $111,221,666.;    Since the
lottery game began rolling over the prize amount on March 17, the game has
collected $246.6 million, or nearly a quarter billion dollars, McNabb said.;  
 "There are a lot of (player) pools of 100 or more. A couple of guys bought
1,000 (tickets) at a time. They're really going hog-wild. It's never been this
busy before," said Sam Sahouria, owner of Fox Plaza Grocery in San Francisco.;
   Lottomania touched Gov. Pete Wilson, who walked from the Capitol to a
restaurant to buy his first-ever lotto ticket. Wilson bought a
computer-selected "quick pick" with the numbers 7, 20, 37, 38, 51 and 53. He
said if he won, he would donate the money to the state.;    At least one
public official remained immune from dreams of never having to work again,
however. Asked if he would resign if he won the prize, Los Angeles Police
Chief Daryl F. Gates chuckled, then replied, "I don't play the lottery." His
wife did, he said.;    A thousand people, mostly from Nevada, waited for hours
to buy up to $6,800 each in tickets for the Lotto 6/53 game at Wills Fargo
Country Store in the Mojave Desert town of Baker, 90 miles from Nevada.
"They're looking for their dream," said general manager Steve Zwerner.;   
Lottery director Chon Gutierrez said identifying and verifying the winners
could take many additional hours, or even days, he said.;    The biggest lotto
winner in U.S. history is a Florida player who landed a windfall of more than
$55 million in September 1988.;    California's largest previous jackpot,
$68.5 million, was divided among four winning tickets in February 1990. The
single largest winner, Tom Tehee of Upland, won $45.3 million in December 1990.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Lottery officials upped the state Lotto jackpot
to $62 million today _ a national record _ as gamblers and dreamers
from as far away as Europe clamored to play.
   The geographical range is ``something we've never seen before,''
Illinois Lottery Director Sharon Sharp said Thursday.
   Travelers passing through O'Hare International Airport jammed
Lotto booths, where sales for Saturday's drawing have been just
about double the average, said Bob Flynn of the Paralyzed Veterans
of America, which runs the six Lotto kiosks.
   ``Who knows when the wheel of fortune spins or not?'' said
ticket-buyer Arthur Beane, a salesman from South Carolina.
   ``I want to win,'' said Florida developer Jack Ross.
   Ticket sales were also particularly brisk at lottery outlets
near Illinois' borders with Indiana, Wisconsin and Missouri, as
residents from those states flocked to get in on the action.
   ``They're ordering them by the hundreds. One runner from Indiana
just bought $3,200 worth,'' sat Pat Poulos of the Deluxe Restaurant
in Danville.
   The Illinois jackpot had risen to $58 million by Friday morning.
And shortly after noon, lottery spokeswoman Kathy Rem announced it
had swollen to $62 million _ topping the old record of $61.98
million set last October in California.
   Three winning tickets were bought in the California lottery, and
two of the three tickets had been purchased by groups of
co-workers, so the winnings were actually split more than 40 ways.
The largest lottery prize that went to a single ticket buyer was
claimed last September, when a Florida woman won $55 million.
   Ticket sales have increased the Illinois jackpot _ already
swollen by rollovers from three straight winless drawings _ by $5
million each day since Sunday.
   More than 23 million tickets had been sold by late Thursday.
   Ms. Rem said officials have received inquiries about the drawing
from California, Tennessee, Texas and other states.
   ``We've also gotten calls from Europe _ England, the Netherlands
_ with people asking how they can play,'' she said.
   Ticket sales have broken records every day this week. A total of
7.5 million tickets were sold Wednesday, a 20 percent increase over
the previous mark for a Wednesday set in 1986, Ms. Rem said.
   Each $1 ticket has two plays. In each bet, the bettor _ or the
computer _ picks six numbers between 1 and 54. The odds of winning
the Lotto on a two-play ticket are 12.9 million to one.

<TEXT>
   There's a new multimillionaire
somewhere out there, as only one Lotto ticket held the six numbers
needed to win America's richest-ever lottery jackpot of at least
$54 million, officials said Sunday.
   The winning $1 ticket for Saturday night's drawing was purchased
in Longwood, a town of 14,500 in central Florida, Lottery Secretary
Rebecca Paul said. She declined to name the store until the winner
steps forward.
   Eight-digit riches were also doled out in New York, where one
winning ticket was purchased for a $23 million jackpot Saturday
night, and in Illinois, where holders of four winning tickets will
split a $21 million prize.
   The previous national record jackpot, $51.4 million, was shared
by two California lottery players in June. A Pennsylvania couple
had the largest single-ticket lottery prize until now when they won
$46 million in 1987.
   The new Florida millionaire _ or millionaires, if several
persons shared the ticket _ get 180 days to claim the prize. The
earliest it can be claimed is Tuesday, after the Labor Day holiday.
   The prize will be doled out over 20 years. The state lottery
withholds 20 percent of large payouts for federal income taxes,
although actual federal taxes owed could be higher. Florida has no
state income tax.
   Splitting a $54 million payout into 20 installments, and
deducting 20 percent, would bring the annual check to $2.16 million.
   Officials had estimated Saturday's jackpot at $52 million, but a
last-minute frenzy of sales that sometimes topped 850 tickets a
second raised the total to $54 million. It could be even larger,
depending on final sales figures.
   Saturday sales totaled 14.6 million tickets, and total weekly
purchases were 44.78 million by the 11 p.m. drawing.
   Players had turned to psychics, gimmicks and other formulas to
beat the 14 million-to-1 odds of picking the six winning digits out
of 49. The winning numbers were 3-5-19-20-27-35.
   Until Saturday, there hadn't been a winner in the drawing since
Aug. 6. That boosted the jackpot with each passing week.
   ``This became an international news story. What better way to
let people know about your lottery than through an international
news story?'' Mrs. Paul said at a news conference. Florida began
its lottery only this year.
   At least $20 million of the week's lottery profits will go to
state education, she said.
   Longwood Mayor David R. Gunter said he was delighted to have the
$54 million ticket sold in his town. The bedroom community 18 miles
northeast of Orlando has several lottery outlets.
   ``I think we're due to be on the map,'' said Gunter. ``This is
one great way to put us on it. It's always good to have a small
city wake up and learn that one individual has had such fantastic
luck.''
   Besides the jackpot, more than 1 million other Lotto players won
smaller prizes.
   Ticket vendors across the state reported brisk Saturday sales.
   ``Frantic isn't the word,'' said James Salvatore, owner of Lotto
News in Miami. ``It's madness.''
   Meanwhile, lotteries in other states credited Florida's Lotto
with boosting their sales.
   ``That kind of publicity raises the awareness of lottery of
everyone in the nation, and we all see an increase in sales,'' said
Kathy Rem, a spokeswoman for the Illinois lottery.
   As in Florida, the winners of the $21 million Illinois drawing
and the $23 million New York lottery were not immediately
identified.
   The winning ticket in New York was sold in prosperous
Westchester County, north of New York City, while the four winning
tickets in Illinois were sold in the suburbs of Chicago.
   Florida Lottery spokesman Ed George spoke via telephone on an
Arizona radio talk show and said he was deluged with questions from
people who wanted to play Florida's game.
   ``I told them to climb into a good solid car or buy a plane
ticket and come on out and visit,'' George said.

   The numbers game turned into a waiting
game Sunday as California Lottery officials waited for holders of
two winning tickets to claim a $51.2 million jackpot, the biggest
ever in a North American lottery.
   The holders of the winning tickets cannot claim their share of
the prize until the start of business Monday. Each winning ticket in
Saturday's Lotto 6-49 drawing is worth $25,618,116, payable over 20
years, said lottery spokesman John Schade.
   The lottery's computers determined that the two winning tickets
were sold at a liquor store in Fairfield, about 45 miles east of San
Francisco, and at a supermarket in the Sacramento suburb of
Carmichael. The computers cannot identify the owners of the tickets,
though.
   The winners will be announced when they present their tickets at
lottery offices for verification.
   A small crowd of reporters and store employees gathered at the
Carmichael supermarket, hoping the winning ticketholder would come
in to announce the win.
   ``They usually show up at the retail outlet,'' said lottery
spokeswoman Susan Kossack, who was waiting at the store. ``We've had
big, big winners never surface ... but with jackpots this size, I
don't think that will happen.''
   ``It's just crazy right now,'' said store clerk Sheri Routh. ``So
far we don't know who the customer is, but we have all the news
stations here.''
   The odds of picking all six numbers out of 49 were about one in
14 million, said lottery officials. The winning numbers were 48, 42,
9, 14, 19, 31. Tickets cost $1 each.
   The waiting game capped three days of frenzied Lotto playing.
   At the peak, sales hit $4 million an hour. Sales on Saturday
alone totaled more than $33 million, a one-day record, spokesman Bob
Taylor said. Weekly sales normally average about $23 million,
officials said.
   Lotto players clutching $20 bills were lined up 40 deep by 6 p.m.
Saturday at a bakery in Oakland.
   ``We've had people buying $1,000 worth of tickets, $400, $600 ...
$50 is nothing. There are $50 buyers all over the place,'' said
bakery president Walter Harmon.
   The late rush pumped millions of extra dollars into the grand
prize pot before sales were halted at 7:45 p.m. Saturday, 13 minutes
before the drawing.
   ``At 4 p.m., our ticket sales pushed the Lotto prize past $46
million, past the Pennsylvania record,'' previously the biggest
North American lottery prize, Taylor said Saturday.
   That Pennsylvania jackpot was awarded in October. The biggest
previous California jackpot, $25.4 million, was split by two players
in October.
   The lottery drew players across state lines and from Mexico. At
Tahoe Tom's in South Lake Tahoe, the fat pot drew Nevada residents
away from casinos across the border, three blocks away.
   ``We were joking yesterday that it would be funny to have the
(ticket) line up to the state line and have the casino executives
wonder what's going on,'' said owner Tom Erickson.

<LEADPARA>  Little Lotto -- the latest effort to boost lottery sales -- was unveiled
Thursday by state officials who trumpeted it as the right gamble for people
who want shorter odds and an immediate jackpot payment of $500,000.;    "We
have been hearing for a long time that we needed a game with a big top prize
-- something between Big Lotto and the top scratcher prizes," said spokeswoman
Joanne McNabb.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  California News  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  LITTLE LOTTO GAME IMPROVES ODDS OF WINNING  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  California News.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The game has odds of winning the top prize at 1 in 3.2 million, compared
with 1 in 23 million of winning the 6/53 jackpot. Big Lotto jackpots range
from $4 million to $69 million while scratcher top prizes run in the tens of
thousands.;    Beginning Sunday, lottery players will be able to buy $1
tickets for Little Lotto. The winning Little Lotto numbers will be drawn every
Tuesday and Friday.;    Little Lotto has only 39 numbers to choose from and
the $500,000 top prize is paid in one lump sum, rather than in installments
over 20 years. If there are more than 20 top prize-winning tickets, however,
they would split $10 million.;    Little Lotto is a fixed game like
Scratchers, Decco and Topper, rather than a game such as Lotto 6/53 where the
size of the big jackpot depends on how many tickets are purchased.;    Besides
the top prize, a player who matches five of six numbers wins $2,000; four of
six numbers $50; and three of six numbers $3.;    Lottery officials increased
the numbers from which lotto players can choose -- from 49 to 53 last summer.
Complaints about the high odds in the 6/53 game, prompted the lottery staff to
accelerate plans to develop Little Lotto.;    Big Lotto game sales dropped 5
percent or just under $100 million from $1.86 billion during fiscal year
1988-'89 to $1.77 billion for fiscal year 1989-'90. This fiscal year the
projection is that sales will come in at about $1.5 billion.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  More lotto terminals, more scratcher contests with bigger cash payouts, and
severe staff cuts -- those are the elements of the new lottery director's
strategy to breathe life into California's stagnant games.;   Lottery Director
Sharon Sharp, addressing her first meeting Thursday of the state Lottery
Commission, said the state lottery has "not been player-friendly and (we must)
make winning easy for the customers. . . . The more you pay the players, the
more the players buy and the more the state makes."  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  California News  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  NEW DIRECTOR DETAILS LOTTERY REVIVAL PLANS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The five-member panel approved her strategic plan, which focuses on a
cranked-up marketing scheme, boosting the number of scratch-off games
available, and requiring the games to pay prizes instantly at the point of
purchase.;   The panel must now decide the specifics of her proposal -- the
kinds of games, the promotional campaigns and the prizes.;   The maximum
instant payment currently is $25; Sharp's plan would raise the instant payout
to nearly $600. Currently, there are few scratcher contests; Sharp said
marketing studies in other states show that players will participate in an
"almost unlimited" variety of scratch-off games.;   Players "have made these
scratchers one of the big growth products in lotteries in the past five
years," she added. In other states, a player who wins a scratch-off is paid
instantly, but "in California you scratch, and you mail in your claim.";  
Sharp, 51, newly appointed by Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, also called for
5,000 new lotto terminals statewide. "There are literally entire areas in the
state where if you wanted to buy a Lotto 6/53 ticket, you couldn't find it,"
Sharp said. California has about one terminal for every 3,100 residents, she
added, while other states have one machine for about 1,500 or 2,000
residents.;   The lottery, crippled by a stubborn recession and dwindling
public interest, has suffered a $300 million revenue decline over the past
year. At the end of June, revenues totaled an estimated $2.1 billion, down 14
percent from the $2.5 billion of the 1989-'90 fiscal year.;   And since June,
lottery revenues have been running less than three-fourths of projections.;  
Under the terms of the 1984 voter-approved lottery initiative, half the
revenues from ticket sales are awarded in prizes, 34 percent goes to schools
and up to 16 percent goes to administrative services, including salaries,
ticket printing and advertising.;   Sharp said the lottery administration
should be "running sleeker and more efficiently, and we are all going to hurt.
We will indeed have to cut the payroll in some ways. People are going to work
an awful lot harder.";   Earlier this year, before Sharp took over, lottery
authorities announced plans to reduce the staff by more than 170 positions.  </TEXT>

GAMBLING: CHANGES ARE PLANNED TO MAKE IT EASIER TO WIN $1-MILLION PRIZES. MANY 
PLAYERS WERE DISSATISFIED WITH A RECENT CHANGE INCREASING THE ODDS TO WIN.

<P>
Admitting they miscalculated player reaction when they increased the odds in 
Lotto, state lottery officials are preparing to order changes in the game that 
would make it easier to win $1-million prizes. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery Commission Chairman Dennis Malody said player dissatisfaction with a 
decision implemented in June that nearly doubled the odds of winning super 
jackpots has led lottery commissioners to "revisit" the issue. 
</P>
<P>
He said the five commissioners have given their staff a month to come up with 
recommendations for changing the game in a way that would "restore player 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners have asked the staff to look into an array of options, he said, 
including the introduction of a new game that would have smaller jackpots and 
better odds, modifications in the current game to improve the odds or a return 
to the game that was played before the June changes. 
</P>
<P>
"My interpretation of the response is not necessarily that (the new game) is 
the problem. The odds issue is the problem," Malody said. "The answer is to 
make the odds more attractive to the players and how that is accomplished I 
have to leave to the people who are more involved in game design than I am." 
</P>
<P>
To rekindle player interest in Lotto, the most popular of the state lottery 
games, officials made alterations in the game that were designed to generate 
more super jackpots. Instead of choosing six numbers from a field of 49, on 
June 21 players began choosing six from a field of 53. The expansion of the 
field changed the odds of winning from 1 in 14 million to 1 in 23 million. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Malody said, individual commissioners as well as the lottery have 
received a flood of complaints from players who objected to the higher odds. To 
add to their troubles, he said, the game changes have not yet produced a huge 
jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
By expanding the field of numbers, officials had hoped to have more drawings 
where there were no winners so that one day's pot would be added to the next 
one. While there have been several jackpots exceeding $30 million, there have 
not been a succession of rollovers to produce the kind of jackpots -- like the 
recent $100-million lottery jackpot in Florida -- that draw national publicity. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a product on the street which is designed to be a large jackpot game 
under theory that there is a portion of the population who want to play for 
that jackpot," said Malody. "There is also a group of people who play and do 
not want large jackpots. They would rather have 20 $1-million jackpots than one 
$20-million jackpot." 
</P>
<P>
Among the changes suggested by the lottery commissioners, was the introduction 
of a game that would have players choosing six numbers from a field of 40. 
</P>
<P>
But more likely to be recommended by the staff are changes in the current Lotto 
game that would still allow super jackpots to accumulate and at the same time 
give players a chance at winning a smaller jackpot with better odds. 
</P>
<P>
Joanne McNabb, the lottery's communications manager, said officials are 
conducting a trial this week with a new twist on the game that makes all 
players holding three of the six numbers drawn participants in a second 
drawing. That drawing, to be held automatically by computer right after the 
main drawing, will pick 10 winners who each would be awarded a $1-million 
prize. 
</P>
<P>
So far ticket sales have been brisk, she said. While the odds of winning a 
$1-million prize depend on the number of tickets sold, officials estimated they 
will be about 1 in 1.7 million. The odds of getting into the second pool are 1 
in 71. 
</P>
<P>
McNabb said the lottery staff has been aware for some time that there is a gap 
in the variety of lottery games offered and has been working on a new game to 
close it. She said studies show that a large number would like a separate game 
offering lower odds with a jackpot of around $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
She said commissioners have asked the staff to study the possibility of 
hastening the introduction of the new game, now under development. It has been 
scheduled for introduction next summer. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be responsive to our playership and we don't want them to feel . . 
. that we don't care," said Malody.

LOTTO JACKPOT REACHES RECORD $67 MILLION

<P>
Californians' frenzied buying of up to 1,250 lotto tickets a second pushed the 
jackpot to a state record of $67 million, virtually assuring there was at least 
one winner in Wednesday night's drawing, lottery officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But authorities will not know for sure until about 6 a.m. today whether anybody 
beat odds of 1 in 14 million by picking these numbers: 44, 27, 34, 12, 21, 41, 
and the bonus number, 6. 
</P>
<P>
It will be later in the day before they can say where the winning Lotto 6/49 
tickets were purchased. And the announcement of who won depends on when winners 
come forward for verification. 
</P>
<P>
With sales as much as 35 times normal for the dream windfall that will pay off 
at about $2.5 million annually after taxes for 20 years, officials said they 
believe more people watched the televised drawing than tuned in to the Super 
Bowl last month. 
</P>
<P>
The prize pools were $9.03 million for players picking five of six numbers plus 
the bonus number; $4.6 million for picking five of six and $4.2 million for 
picking four of six. Players picking three of six will win $5, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Odds grew to 98 in 100 Wednesday that at least one gambler among the horde 
snatching up tickets would win the big prize. 
</P>
<P>
"It's extremely likely that there will be a winner because most of the (14 
million) possible combinations of numbers have been picked," state lottery 
spokeswoman Joanne McNabb said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are only two chances in 100 that there will not be a winner." 
</P>
<P>
The odds were substantial, but not calculated precisely, that there would be 
more than one winning person, McNabb added. Sometimes the winning tickets are 
held by groups, so the riches from this jackpot may be spread to dozens of 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery Director Chon Gutierrez said the top prize exceeds California's record 
jackpot of $61.98 million on Oct. 29, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
There were three winning tickets for the October, 1988, record jackpot -- two 
of which were held by groups. The jackpot ranks fourth in the nation, trailing 
a record $115-million lottery prize in Pennsylvania last year. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how sales were running at the Ramona Village convenience market in Chino, 
assistant manager Adria Singleton said: "Like crazy." 
</P>
<P>
"We're running around chasing our tails here," Singleton said, laughing. "In a 
matter of two hours I probably did over $800 to $1,000 in sales on lottery 
tickets alone." 
</P>
<P>
The store might normally take in $400 to $500 in total sales during the same 
period, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"People are buying them up hundreds at a time," she added. "We even have our 
own little pool going here at the store just in case." 
</P>
<P>
McNabb, the lottery spokeswoman, said the pace of sales had hit a state record 
of $4.5 million per hour at one point, compared to a normal hourly sales pace 
of about $125,000. That figures to about 1,250 tickets per second, roughly 35 
times normal.

IT CELEBRATES ITS FIFTH BIRTHDAY AS THE LARGEST IN NORTH AMERICA. BUT OFFICIALS 
ADMIT THEY HAVE HAD A STRING OF BAD LUCK AS NEW GAMES FAIL TO INCREASE 
REVENUES.

<P>
By all rights, it should be a phenomenal success story -- a business that has 
grown from nothing to $10.6 billion in sales in five years, created 3,000 jobs 
and given schools $4 billion to boot. 
</P>
<P>
But as the California Lottery modestly celebrates its fifth birthday this week, 
it is getting as much criticism as it is accolades. 
</P>
<P>
Revenues on its major games -- Lotto, Decco and Scratchers -- are flat. Many of 
its hard-core players are angry about a change in the Lotto game that 
dramatically heightened the odds of losing. A public-interest group is starting 
a campaign against its advertising, labeling it "misleading and deceptive." 
</P>
<P>
Most troublesome of all, today, the day the lottery commemorates its first 
ticket sales in 1985, a state Senate committee is convening to question lottery 
officials about some of their business decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery officials, who see the creation of a multibillion-dollar business in 
five years as nothing short of "incredible," seem mystified by the sudden 
onslaught of criticism. They concede that they may have miscalculated some 
players' reaction to the change in the Lotto odds, but they say the lottery -- 
like everything else -- has been the victim of economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"Is Disneyland mismanaged because the oil crisis is resulting in their tourism 
being down?" asked Chon Gutierrez, the ebullient director of California's 
lottery. "Is government mismanaged because there is a recession and revenues 
are down and the budget is tight?" 
</P>
<P>
Even in good economic times, he said, the lottery is a roller coaster business. 
Revenues soar when jackpots, new games and new twists in old games spark 
players' interest and slide when the novelty wears off. Whenever there is a dip 
in enthusiasm, he said, lottery management adjusts the games to reignite player 
interest, but often it takes time to reach a new high. 
</P>
<P>
Players are seeing a typical slide, he said, that is exacerbated by economic 
uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
I. Nelson Rose, a Whittier College law professor and expert on gambling law, 
agreed. He said it is common for lotteries to come under intense criticism 
after about five years of operation. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember, this is a consumer item and it is a very poor consumer item," he 
said. "The chances of winning a significant prize are so small that people are 
literally being frustrated every day of their lives. What they're doing is 
airing that frustration. The state lottery isn't doing anything it shouldn't be 
doing. The problem is people are spending a lot of money on the lottery and 
losing." 
</P>
<P>
Even the criticism cannot overshadow the fact that the lottery celebrates its 
fifth birthday firmly entrenched in the California lifestyle. From an operation 
that began with four secretaries and three executives in March, 1985, it has 
become the biggest lottery in North America and the fifth largest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, 90% of California adults have played the lottery at least once, 
according to state lottery figures. On its busiest days, it logs more 
transactions than the New York Stock Exchange. In five years it has made 577 
people millionaires and distributed about $5.2 billion in prizes. 
</P>
<P>
Who plays the lottery is a question that has been debated over its five-year 
lifetime. Critics claim it preys on the poor by capitalizing on dreams of a 
better life. Lottery officials say they try to attract urban professionals and 
the well-to-do. Independent polls by the Los Angeles Times in 1986 and 1987 
showed the lottery was most popular with individuals who earn from $10,000 to 
$40,000 annually, with blue-collar workers and with men. 
</P>
<P>
Enthusiasm for the lottery in California began before the first ticket was 
sold. On Nov. 6, 1984, voters overwhelmingly approved an initiative 
establishing California as a lottery state despite a vigorous opposing campaign 
from church groups and parimutuel gambling interests. 
</P>
<P>
Leo McElroy, the political consultant who ran the campaign to try to defeat the 
lottery, said once the issue was settled at the polls, active opposition seemed 
to cease. "The people who didn't like it didn't have to play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Its early success helped lottery fever spread to other states. In 1984, 
California was the 21st state to approve a lottery. Today, 30 states and the 
District of Columbia have lotteries. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its popularity and general public acceptance, there are some public 
officials who acknowledge an uneasiness. Although at least 34% of lottery 
revenues must be dedicated to public education, there is a widespread feeling 
even among the original promoters of the lottery that it has not been that good 
for education. 
</P>
<P>
So much emphasis in the original promotion of the lottery was given to the 
benefits for education, they said, that in many voters' minds it became a 
solution to education's money problems. 
</P>
<P>
"People thought all of a sudden it would be this cornucopia of endless funds 
for education. It was an unrealistic expectation," said Rose. 
</P>
<P>
In the early years, bond issues and other efforts to raise money for education 
were defeated in part because voters believed the lottery had already taken 
care of education, critics and supporters agree. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Fadem, a San Francisco lawyer who sponsored and helped author the 
initiative for Scientific Games in 1984, said the lottery's promoters put so 
much emphasis on the billions of dollars that the games of chance would raise 
for education that voters never understood those billions only represented 3% 
of education's total budget. 
</P>
<P>
"My only regret is that a lot of California voters carried the impression that 
the lottery would solve all of California's education funding woes," said 
Fadem. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said he originally opposed the lottery 
initiative, believing that it would never be the "icing on the cake" for 
education that its promoters promised. He said he suspected -- and experience 
in the initial years has proved him right -- that the money given to education 
by the lottery would encourage the governor and Legislature to provide less 
from other sources. 
</P>
<P>
Honig, who has no criticism of the way the lottery is being run, talks, as do 
many public officials, of being troubled by the fact that a state-run gambling 
operation is used to finance the education of California's young people. 
</P>
<P>
"We are certainly appreciative of the money but I'm just uncomfortable 
encouraging people to gamble," he said. "There's a philosophical problem. Here 
we're trying to tell kids work hard, study hard, make the long, slow effort to 
learn and it will pay off. And then we have advertising on television that says 
play the lottery and lightning will strike." 
</P>
<P>
Controller Gray Davis, whose office regularly audits the lottery, said, "If I 
had to grade the lottery I'd give it a B. It has fulfilled its mission to 
provide an additional 3% funding to schools. . . . On the other hand, I feel 
badly that revenue for important public services such as education have to be 
generated by gambling." 
</P>
<P>
In the same vein, Carl Oshiro, supervising attorney for the University of San 
Diego's Center for Public Interest Law, has filed a complaint with lottery 
officials contending that its television advertising is misleading because it 
fails to disclose the odds of winning. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we have the state of California teaching folks through its advertising 
that gambling ought to be part of their daily life, part of their daily routine 
and spending massive amounts of money to do it," Oshiro said. "It didn't seem 
to us that there was any money spent on putting out any other message either in 
terms of what the product really is or perhaps warning people of the 
consequences of excessive gambling." 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez said it would be difficult to disclose the odds in a 30-second 
television spot. He said the agency is considering some type of advertising 
campaign to warn against excessive gambling. He said that under his direction 
the lottery has been careful never to use children in advertising or promote 
its link to education as reason people should gamble. 
</P>
<P>
The lottery has been one of the top advertisers in the state -- last year it 
spent $63.9 million on advertising and promotion -- since it opened its doors 
in 1985 with a game called Scratchers, which allowed the player to scratch off 
the surface of each $1 ticket to determine if it was a winner. A year later, it 
was advertising another game, Lotto, which was to become its most popular 
offering. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, players selected six numbers from a field of 49 and the winning 
combinations were picked during televised Saturday night drawings. Now, players 
pick from a field of 53 and drawings are held Wednesdays and Saturdays. The 
lottery has recently added Decco, a game using card symbols, and Topper, an 
add-on to the Lotto game that utilizes the names of California cities. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Topper, the results for all games in recent months have been 
disappointing. Decco has not produced the revenue that Lottery officials 
anticipated. Scratchers has been in a steady decline and Lotto revenues have 
not surged to their heights of a year ago. At the end of the 1989-90 fiscal 
year, the lottery reported that its total sales revenues would be $100 million 
less than the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
In a move designed to produce more super-jackpots, officials in June expanded 
the field of numbers from which Lotto players can pick. Instead of choosing 
from 49 numbers, players are allowed to choose from 53. The idea was that by 
increasing the odds from 1 in 14 million to 1 in 23 million, fewer jackpots 
would be won and there would be more roll-overs. An accumulation of roll-overs 
produces the super-jackpots. 
</P>
<P>
Since the change, however, there has been no string of super-jackpots and 
revenue has not increased appreciably. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Love, editor of The Lotto Edge, a Los Angeles-based newsletter that 
caters to regular players, said the change in odds caused the backbone of the 
lottery's business -- the hard-core player -- to cut back. 
</P>
<P>
"What's happened is exactly what the regular players told them would happen a 
year ago. The consensus among us was we would either stop playing or play less 
(if the odds were changed)," he said. "Many of my readers did exactly that. 
People who were playing $40 and $50 a game or even $100 a game now play $5 or 
$10." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-Gardena), chairman of the Senate Governmental 
Organization Committee that oversees the lottery, has asked lottery officials 
to be prepared to defend the change and explain at his hearing today how they 
expected to increase sales by reducing a player's chance of winning. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez said the increase in sales would have come naturally if the change to 
53 numbers had produced a number of super-jackpots. But the lottery has been 
faced with the same thing that many gamblers face -- bad luck. Since the 
change, there has been one $44-million jackpot, and that unfortunately occurred 
at the same time Florida had a $106-million jackpot. The California jackpot, 
which in other times would have attracted major publicity, looked like small 
potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
On top of that, Gutierrez said he could never have foreseen the crisis in the 
Middle East, which sent gasoline prices soaring, pushing the economy into a 
slump and leaving consumers with less expendable cash. 
</P>
<P>
"Had we anticipated perhaps the things that are driving the economy to be a 
little bit soft like the gulf crisis, had all of this been in our crystal ball, 
then obviously we would have made the (change) a year ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez said it is still early to determine whether the Lotto change is a 
success or failure. He said the lottery is taking the criticism from the 
players seriously and is planning a new game in a few weeks -- possibly a Lotto 
game with a number field of 39 -- which will offer top prizes of about $1 
million and better odds. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, experts disagree on the long-term significance of the criticism. 
Fadem believes it will quickly fade; Rose agrees but suggests that overall 
doubts about the lottery may linger. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't view this as a long-term problem," said Fadem. "It (player interest) 
moves in cycles. Looking back over the last five years, I think they've done a 
helluva job and I think in general Californians are satisfied with the games 
that are available." 
</P>
<P>
Rose observed that lotteries, like their games, go through cycles. In 
post-Colonial days of the 1820s and 1830s, it was "easier to buy a lottery 
ticket than it is today." By the Civil War, they had nearly disappeared. After 
the war, the economic devastation in the South sparked a revival. Then, by the 
turn of the century, there were no legal lotteries in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We go through these great swings from permissiveness to prohibition," Rose 
said. "We're definitely on the upswing of a permissive era now, but the 
question is, 'Will it last?' I am sure after the Civil War it was inconceivable 
that they would ever be outlawed, but (several decades later) they were."

<TEXT>
   Just eight weeks after Florida's $55.1
million jackpot eclipsed lottomania in California, the Golden State
is back with a $55 million-plus jackpot that will be North America's
richest ever.
   Lottery officials and merchants said ticket sales for Saturday's
drawing already were double what an average Thursday would rake in.
   The official estimate of ``over $55 million'' for the drawing is
conservative, based on previous betting patterns in the two-year
history of California's computerized lottery game, said lottery
spokesman Bob Taylor.
   ``Over $55 million'' could mean several million dollars over,
officials acknowledge.
   It all depends on how wildly Californians react to the
1-in-14-million chance of winning the jackpot, which would be paid
in an annuity of at least $2.75 million before taxes for 20 years,
for the cost of a $1 lotto ticket.
   The size of the jackpot depends on sales and jackpot rollovers,
which fuel each other to produce the heavy gambling periods dubbed
lottomania.
   When no one picks all six winning numbers out of a choice of 49
numbers, the jackpot is rolled over, or added, to the top prize for
the next twice-weekly drawing. Four rollovers, including a $33.4
million jackpot Wednesday night, produced the current record prize
estimate.
   The exact size of the jackpot depends on how many tickets are
sold. Twenty cents of every $1 ticket feeds the jackpot.
   The California lottery produced a $51.4 million jackpot, North
America's largest at the time, in June. It was evenly split between
two players, an aircraft mechanic and a supermarket clerk.
   That record was eclipsed Sept. 3 by a $55.1 million prize in
Florida that went to a 63-year-old real estate broker.

   As six states and the District of Columbia
launch a new multistate Lotto game, Associated Press bureaus in 26
states checked on their states' experience with legal wagering.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-six states are now wheedling extra dollars from their
taxpayers with lottery games, helping senior citizens in
Pennsylvania, schools in Ohio and economic development in Iowa and
Oregon.
   Total sales exceeded $12 billion last year. Eight states sell $1
billion or more in lottery tickets a year, keeping a third or more
of that amount to support state programs. Within the last year,
Florida, Kansas, Montana and South Dakota have joined the club, and
Wisconsin and Virginia will begin games this year.
   Though most states report rising income from wagering, some have
to hustle to keep bettors interested.
   Last week, Pennsylvania scrapped a lotto game that had sold $2.2
billion worth of tickets since 1982 and launched a ``Wild Card
Lotto'' game. Players in the old game picked six numbers out of 40,
but the new game has 48 choices.
   That changes the odds of winning from one in 1.9 million to one
in 6.1 million. That, in turn, increases the chances of creating
one of those humongous $30 million or $40 million jackpots that
inspire frantic ticket sales.
   ``We've had so many people who've won a million or more, it now
takes a pot of $10 million to generate the interest that $5 million
did once,'' says Laurie Kipp-Klecha, a spokeswoman for the lottery
in Michigan, where on Sunday officials said someone was holding a
$17 million ticket after the latest drawing.
   ``People like to spend a dollar to have a shot at the moon,''
said Kathy Rem, a spokeswoman for the Illinois lottery.
   That's also the theory behind the new six-state ``Lotto
America'' game, launched last week in Oregon, Iowa, Kansas,
Missouri, Rhode Island, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.
With more bettors to lose money, the game can offer bigger prizes _
a minimum of $2 million.
   ``Our motivation is to offer Oregonians a chance to play in
games they could play in one of the big states,'' said James Davey,
whose state lottery faces big-jackpot competition along the
California border.
   No one picked all seven numbers to win the jackpot in the first
Lotto America drawing held Saturday night. More than 2 million
tickets were sold, spokesman Brett Voorhees said in Des Moines,
Iowa.
   Colorado legislators, who have seen lottery sales slump from
$136.9 million in the first year, 1982-83, to as low as $105.3
million in fiscal 1985, are debating a big-jackpot lotto game this
year.
   Donald L. Bean, assistant director of the Ohio lottery, credits
the state's ``Super Lotto'' game with helping build ticket sales
from $100 million in the first year, 1974-75, to $1.07 billion last
year.
   There are seven other states in the billion-dollar club:
California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York
and Pennsylvania.
   New York has the most lucrative games, earning $666.8 million on
sales of $1.46 billion, a 45 percent profit, in the fiscal year
ending March 31, 1987.
   New Jersey, Michigan and Pennsylvania all extract more than 40
percent from their games as well.
   However, Missouri's 2-year-old lottery has run into problems
because the state constitutional amendment authorizing the games
requires that 45 percent of the proceeds go to the state and that
no more than 10 percent go to administration.
   An independent audit commissioned by the Legislature concluded
that the game would fail early in 1989 unless more money was
offered as prizes and more money was available for administration.
An amendment reflecting those recommendations will be on the
Missouri ballot later this year.
   The Missouri lottery earned $80 million last year, far less than
the $250 million a year some legislators had forecast.
   Even a successful operation such as the New York lottery
contributes only 2.5 percent of the state's general fund budget,
and there is no reason to believe that lotteries have been a
substitute for tax increases.
   New York's game began at the same time sales, personal income
and corporate taxes were rising in the free-spending years of Gov.
Nelson Rockefeller. Washington state's lottery came with a package
of tax increases in 1982, when the state was hard-pressed for cash.
   Dave Ellis, spokesman for the Massachusetts lottery, recalled
that the lottery was promoted in 1971 as a way of avoiding a sales
tax increase from 3 percent to 4 percent. In 1975, the sales tax
went up to 5 percent _ part of a program by newly elected Gov.
Michael Dukakis to eliminate a $600 million deficit.
   Pennsylvania's receipts are earmarked for senior citizen
programs such as tax subsidies and prescription drugs. Despite
projected growth of 11 percent next year, revenues were lagging
behind program requirements, and Gov. Robert P. Casey has
recommended returning some of the senior citizen programs to
general funding.
   Iowa decided not to depend on lottery profits for state
operations. Instead, ``Iowa Plan'' proceeds go into one-time
economic development programs such as grants to new or expanding
businesses.
   Oregon also directs its lottery profits _ $47.3 million last
year _ to economic development.
   Florida, which began its lottery last month, has a novel clause
making things more difficult for unscrupulous prize winners. It
provides for prizes to be awarded to dependents if the winner is a
child-support deadbeat. Already, $70,000 has been earmarked for
dependents.

<TEXT>     Sharp, addressing state lawmakers at an informational hearing, said her
plan is based on the proven formula of investing money to make money.
"California players are tired of not winning," she said.;   More than $1 per
student;   Sharp told members of the Assembly Governmental Organization
Committee she is proposing that about $7 million in lottery interest earnings,
which would go to schools this year, be used instead to increase scratch-off
ticket prizes by next spring. That step would cut school funds by more than $1
per student.;   The director said she hopes eventually to use an additional
$25 million in unclaimed prize money that would go to schools for scratch-off
ticket prizes, as well.;   Sharp said that in better financial years, she
would use administrative funds to bolster prizes, but falling sales have
forced cuts in staff and operating funds.;   The recently appointed director
said that as prizes increase, Californians will gamble more, boosting lottery
sales and maintaining public education's constitutionally guaranteed 34
percent share of total revenue.;   The gains for schools will more than offset
the $1 per student decrease, she said.;   Something needs to be done to
reverse the trend, said Jim Baughman, superintendent of San Jose Unified
School District.;   Desperate for funds;   "Right now the lottery revenue has
dipped so badly," Baughman said, "that if she could come up with a strategy to
turn the revenue around, I would be all for it.";   Representatives of other
education groups said they do not oppose the change as long as schools,
overall, get their 34 percent of lottery sales.;   Sharp said that she drew
considerable opposition when she mentioned interest in lowering the percentage
of the total contribution to schools earlier, and now has no intention of
pursuing such a change.;   "I stepped into it. I've pulled back. I will never,
ever mention again getting into the 34 percent," she said.;   "The California
Lottery, if it were a corporation, would be in Chapter 11 (bankruptcy) right
now," she said.;   The 6-year-old lottery's sales may hit $1.5 billion or less
in 1991-'92 if the current pace continues, down from a high of $2.6 billion in
1988-'89, state officials said. It would be the worst year since its first
full year of operation in 1986-'87, when the lottery logged $1.39 billion in
sales.;   Education's share, guaranteed at 34 percent of total lottery sales
by the 1984 lottery-authorizing ballot initiative, would drop to about $570
million from last year's $804 million.;   At its peak in the 1988-'89 school
year, the lottery provided $176 per student.  </TEXT>

   Lottery players began queuing up today to buy
tickets for next week's state lottery jackpot, which is projected
to top $62 million and will be the second-largest in U.S. history.
   ``We'll just be jammed. We were jammed this morning as soon as
we opened'' at 6:30 a.m., said June Gerken, who sells tickets for
the Super 7 lottery from a balloon shop she operates in Pittsburgh
with her husband, Larry.
   Despite record sales, no ticket sold for Wednesday's drawing
contained seven winning numbers for the jackpot of at least $42
million.
   Lottery officials set next Wednesday's jackpot at $62 million
based on projected ticket sales. The jackpot will be at least that
much and could go higher, spokeswoman Terry Murphy said today.
   The nation's highest lottery jackpot of $69.9 million came just
last week in Illinois. That jackpot was split among four winning
ticket holders after Saturday's drawing. The previous record, set
last fall, was a $61.98 million jackpot split among buyers of three
tickets in the California lottery.
   The largest single winner was a Florida woman who won $55.16
million in that state's lottery in September 1988.
   In the Pennsylvania lottery's ``Super 7'' game, players pick
seven out of 80 numbers. The lottery then picks 11 numbers, and the
winner is anyone whose choices are any seven of the 11 numbers. The
odds of winning are calculated at one in 9.6 million.
   Sally Carpenter, manager of Dunkin Donuts in Woodlyn, said only
a few people have bought tickets this morning for next week's
drawing.
   ``They seem to all wait to the end, and I don't know why,'' she
said.
   ``Most people are in shock. They can't believe it didn't go last
night. They're all excited. They feel they've got another chance,''
said Dorothy DeLuca, who runs the lottery machine at DeLuca's State
News and Variety Store in Erie. ``We have people who don't know how
to play playing.''
   Lottery officials braced for a record number of ticket buyers in
the coming week and advised buyers to use the computer to pick the
numbers, to speed up the sales.
   Lottery official Michael Keyser said a record 29,258,972 tickets
were sold for Wednesday night's drawing, exceeding the previous
number of 27,662,192 on Oct. 14, 1987, when a Hollidaysburg couple
won the previous largest state jackpot of $46 million.

   A projected $55 million-plus lottery
prize that would return the North American title for big jackpots to
the state is making Californians' gambling fever rise again.
   Lottery officials and merchants said ticket sales for the
Saturday drawing were running about double the usual pace for
Thursday's sales.
   The official estimate of ``over $55 million'' for the drawing is
conservative, based on similar situations in the two-year history of
California's computerized Lotto 6-49 game, said lottery spokesman
Bob Taylor.
   On June 4, California's lottery paid out a $51.4 million jackpot,
North America's largest at the time. That jackpot was eclipsed Sept.
3 by a $55.1 million prize in Florida.
   The state-run lottery's policy is to estimate the jackpot
conservatively, then revise the projection upward as sales soar.
   It all depends on how wildly Californians react to the
1-in-14-million chance of winning the jackpot.
   ``The jackpot is going to generate an awful lot of sales,'' said
Taylor.
   The size of the jackpot depends on sales and jackpot rollovers,
which combine to produce heavy gambling periods, dubbed
``lottomania'' when they first struck other state's games.
   When nobody picks all six winning numbers out of a choice 49, the
jackpot is rolled over, or added, to the top prize for the next
twice-weekly drawing.
   Four rollovers, including the rollover of a $33.4 million jackpot
Wednesday night, produced the current record prize estimate.
   The exact size of the jackpot will depend on how many tickets are
sold. Of every $1 ticket, 20 cents goes into the jackpot.
   Each time the jackpot climbs, so do sales, pushing the total
still higher, generating even more sales. Historically, most of the
sales occur in the last few hours before the televised drawing at
four seconds before 7:57 p.m. Sales are cut off at 7:45 p.m.
   By 2 p.m. Thursday, sales hit $1.2 million, which is normally the
total for the entire 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. sales period on a Thursday,
said Taylor.

<HL> REGIONS:
Multistate Lottery's Prospects
Grow, Even Absent Big States
---
By Eugene Carlson
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL>
<DD> 08/18/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   RULE ONE in the lottery business: The bigger the jackpot, the more tickets you sell. 
So if you're running a state lottery that offers relatively small cash awards, and you know that hundreds -- perhaps thousands -- of your potential customers are playing the multimillion-dollar lottery in the big state next door, your strategy is pretty clear: Double, triple or quadruple your own grand prize, and keep those ticket sales at home. 

   That's exactly what Iowa and Missouri, whose citizens are regular players in the wealthy lottery in neighboring Illinois, hope to do. 
Starting early next year, Iowa and Missouri plan to join forces with several other states in a coast-to-coast, multistate lottery. 

   The idea is to promote the same lottery"America's Game" is one of the names being considered -- in states from Oregon to Rhode Island. 
The states would be linked by satellite every Saturday night for the weekly drawing. 

   The new game is likely to hurt ticket sales in participating states' existing lotteries. 
But organizers of the multistate game are betting that the public's usual response to lotteries will prevail. 
That is, a large population base will produce lots of ticket sales, which will build big jackpots, which will inspire even more sales, far outweighing any revenue loss in single-state games. 
As usual in the lottery business, the odds of winning will be infinitesimal. 

   THE BIG QUESTION is membership. 
Six states, with a combined population of 16 million, already are committed to the plan: Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Oregon, Rhode Island and West Virginia. 
The District of Columbia says it's in, too. 
If past experience is any guide, that should make the multistate lottery one of the nation's richest games of chance. 

   It would be richer still if New York and Illinois, both early supporters of the multistate idea, weren't sitting on the sidelines. 
Illinois Gov. James Thompson is stringing out a decision whether to participate. 
New York's lottery director, John Quinn, says his state won't play unless Illinois does. (New York's legislature needs to approve the state's multistate membership; a bill to that effect apparently died last month when the assembly recessed.) 

   Signing up the two big states would triple the multistate lottery's projected population base to 45 million. 
The small states think this is wonderful, because residents of Iowa or West Virginia would have a shot -- albeit tiny -- at a huge grand prize in a homestate lottery. 
Ticket sales in those states would presumably soar. 

   THE RATIONALE BEHIND LOTTERIES, after all, is to raise money for state government programs and thus ease the bite on taxpayers. 
Oregon's lottery, just two years old, has already earned $70 million for state economic development programs ranging from new university buildings to commercial fishing piers. 
In Illinois, 42% of lottery income goes to elementary and secondary schools. 
Last year, that came to $553 million. 

   Indeed, Illinois, with its own popular lottery, has less incentive than the smaller states to join the multistate lottery. 
It was Illinois, after all, that produced the richest prize won by a single ticketholder in a North American lottery: $40 million in September 1984. 
The huge pot came after the lottery went four weeks without a winner, the grand prize rolling over and growing each week. 

   "During those four weeks, we had tremendous ticket sales," recalls Michael Jones, Illinois's lottery superintendent at the time and now a Chicago-based lottery consultant. 

   It's what lottery directors dream about: a game designed in such a way that every so often, no one wins the grand prize for two or three weeks in a row. 
The prize money builds, newspapers and television give the game big coverage, and people line up everywhere to buy tickets in a sort of gambler's feeding frenzy. 

   But Illinois's grand prize hasn't come close to that level since , leading the state's lottery strategists to wonder how to boost business. 
One way is to join the multistate game. 
Rebecca Paul, who resigned as Illinois's lottery director last week to head Florida's new lottery, thinks that's the wave of the future. 
In Canada, Australia, Switzerland and West Germany, multistate or multiprovince lotteries are the most widely played. 
"I think that's where we're headed three to five years from now," Ms. Paul says. 

   MR. JONES FORESEES a different format. 
"I see the large states getting together in a super lotto." 
He suggests a "triangle game" with Florida, New York and Illinois, or a Great Lakes regional lottery, with Ohio, Michigan and Illinois. 
There is a precedent: Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont already run a lottery called Tristate Megabucks. 

   Ms. Paul, whose Florida game will begin Jan. 15, doesn't like the idea of such fragmented lotteries. 
"I think it's bad for the industry to have competing multistate games," she says. 

   Multistate games aren't the only way to draw more players; states can also change the odds on an existing game. 
Illinois did that in April, introducing a new Wednesday night lotto drawing that makes it easier to win a cheap prize (last week it was one chance in 89 to win $12 on a $1 ticket), but tougher to win the grand prize (one chance in 15.4 million). 
The idea paid off late last month, when the jackpot reached $22 million, Illinois's highest in three years. 

   As for the multistate plan, Sharon Sharp, who took over yesterday as Illinois lottery director, says she hasn't made up her mind about Illinois membership. 
If the answer is yes, Chicago will be the site of the weekly multistate lottery drawing. 
If Illinois says no, the winning numbers will be picked in Des Moines, Iowa.

<HEAD>Winners Claim $39.8 Million Prize With Mangled Ticket</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Days after the Lotto America numbers were
drawn for a $39.8 million jackpot, three Connecticut residents knew
they had the winning ticket but thought it was so badly damaged it
might be rejected.
   Two of the three tickets purchased by Sheila E. Phillips, her
boyfriend, George H. Brown, and George Mages, were destroyed when a
can of whipped cream exploded in the cooler the ticket was sitting
in. Only the winning ticket survived.
   ``The ticket was mangled and we all said `Gee, I wonder if
they're going to take the ticket?''' said Brown, 46, of Montville,
Conn. All three are managers at the General Dynamics Electric Boat
division in Groton, Conn.
   Their numbers were drawn Saturday in the lottery, which is played
in six states and the District of Columbia. The trio turned the
ticket in Wednesday to the Rhode Island Lottery Commission to claim
the prize.
   The three were visiting friends in West Warwick, R.I., when they
bought tickets at Haxton's Package Store shortly before the numbers
were drawn Saturday night.
   Phillips found out Monday night she had the winning numbers, but
the trio waited until Wednesday to turn in the ticket so they could
bring a lawyer along.
   The prize was the largest in Lotto America history and the fourth
largest lottery jackpot won in the United States on a single ticket,
according to lottery executive director Peter J. O'Connell.
   Each of the three will receive $664,333 annually for the next 20
years. They said they will quit their jobs.
   States participating in Lotto America are Iowa, Missouri, Kansas,
Oregon, Rhode Island, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.
   None of the three had immediate plans for their share of the
fortune.
   In other lotteries:
   _Nine weeks of waiting ended in Pennsylvania when lottery
officials announced Wednesday that two winning tickets had been sold
for a Super 7 jackpot worth at least $60 million.
   The prize is the second largest in the state lottery's history
and the fourth largest nationwide.
   _Two players correctly picked all six numbers in the California
Lottery's ``Lotto 6-49'' game held Wednesday night and will split an
$11.03 million jackpot, state lottery officials said.
   The two winners will take home $5,515,173 each.
   The winners in Pennsylvania and California have not been
identified.

   A world-record lottery jackpot drew
entrants from as far away as England as 265 tickets a second were
sold for a shot at the $52 million Florida Lotto drawing tonight.
   ``We've got so many people running in and out of here. I had
somebody call at 6 o'clock this morning wanting to know if I was
open,'' Bill McMurtray, manager of the Sing convenience store and
gas station in Bradfordville near the Georgia line, said Friday.
   Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul said she met a man from London
who read about the jackpot and flew to Florida to play.
   The record prize in the 4-month-old lottery also is attracting
droves of players from neighboring states.
   Eight of the state's top 10 ticket sellers are in the Panhandle
or northeast Florida counties bordering Alabama and Georgia,
neither of which has a legalized lottery, said lottery spokesman Ed
George.
   Half the sales at the Sing convenience store, about eight miles
south of the Georgia line, are to Georgia and Alabama residents.
One man purchased more than $500 worth of tickets Friday morning
for a lottery pool.
   ``He comes down every Friday,'' McMurtray said. ``The higher the
jackpot has been, the higher the influx of people from Georgia has
been.''
   The lottery's telephone hotline has been receiving calls from
out-of-state residents wanting to buy tickets without coming to
Florida. But Postal Service regulations prohibit selling lottery
tickets through the mail.
   Many Lotto players dreamed of what it would be like to win.
   ``Parties, trips, plays, travel. I'd throw a big party first
thing,'' said Gail Thomas, a Georgia juvenile detention officer who
bought her tickets in the border town of Iamonia.
   Pasco Donald, 74, said he would remember his 12 children, 60
grandchildren and more than 50 great-grandchildren.
   ``I'd give each of them $1,000,'' he said. ``Well, maybe some of
them. Not all of them.''
   Despite the 14-million-to-1 odds of winning, the $1 Lotto
tickets were selling at a rate of about 265 per second Friday, said
George.
   Last week about 32 million tickets were sold for a $32 million
jackpot. This week, officials expected sales to hit 40 million. The
pot has been climbing because no one has won since Aug. 6.
   Officials said half of any week's sales are usually made on
Saturdays before computerized ticket machines shut down at 10:30
p.m. for the 11 p.m. drawing, which is televised.
   California set the world lottery jackpot record in June with a
$51.4 million prize that went to two people, said Terri La Fleur, a
senior editor at Gaming and Wagering Business Magazine, a monthly
trade publication in New York.
   Sam Valenza, publisher of Lottery Players magazine in
Moorestown, N.J., agreed with La Fleur.
   California's biweekly numbers game took 20 months to produce the
prize. It took Florida only four months to break the California
mark. The increase in Florida's jackpot was aided by the stiff odds
against winning _ among the highest of any state lottery.
   Players select six numbers from 1 to 49 and mark their
selections on a computer card, which is read by a ticket machine.
   Spain's ``El Gordo'' lottery gave away $56 million in 1983, but
it was not a Lotto-style game.

CONTROVERSY OVER STATE LOTTERY'S NEW GAME TO INCREASE JACKPOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the state goes into the numbers racket, the consequences are bound to be 
embarrassing -- for everyone involved. 
</P>
<P>
As a Californian, I am embarrassed to see a state commission hawking lottery 
tickets as if its enterprise were a legitimate function of government. 
</P>
<P>
Parents in our school district are embarrassed to learn that their support of 
the California lottery, touted as a major source of help for our faltering 
educational system, has brought no relief from overcrowded classrooms and 
over-stressed teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators must be embarrassed to realize that the big jackpots which entice 
poorly educated citizens to double their bets will never actually be paid from 
the betting pool. The operators of this grandest of all scams have the 
government's own blessing on a formula which spreads the payoff over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Time enough for them to invest the money and cover the winners' annual checks 
with the interest. Twenty years from now they will still have the principal. 
</P>
<P>
Now you tell us ("New Lotto Game Aims at Super Jackpots," Part A, May 25) that 
lottery officials will try to boost revenues by further diminishing the odds on 
the new Lotto game in order to produce more giant jackpots. (Starting on June 
21, players will pick six numbers from a field of 53 instead of the present 
49.) 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it's time to change the motto on the official seal of our great state. 
</P>
<P>
From "Eureka" to "Never Give a Sucker an Even Break." Sort of a Lotto motto.

   From the sea to the Sierra, long lines
of Californians snatched lotto tickets at 10 times the normal pace
Friday as gamblers dreamed of overnight wealth in a record jackpot
that's climbed to more than $57 million.
   The top prize in the Saturday night drawing will bring the title
for North America's largest jackpot back to California, exceeding
the $55.1 million prize awarded by Florida on Sept. 3, California
Lottery officials said.
   Lotto ``6-49'' players were expected to spend roughly a dollar
for every man, woman and child in California Friday, with sales for
the day projected at nearly $30 million, said lottery spokesman Bob
Taylor. Normal sales for a Friday would be about $3 million, he
added.
   Some of the players needed the jackpot less than others.
   ``I come from a long line of people with money, but you know it
wouldn't hurt to replenish the bloodline, so to speak, with a little
new cash,'' said 53-year-old Dorothy Williams, who was standing in
line to buy five $1 tickets at a store on San Francisco's
prestigious Nob Hill.
   In contrast, Lee Tran, a 29-year-old Vietnamese immigrant
standing in a line of 10 people at a Market Street convenience store
in San Francisco, said, ``My whole family has put up money for our
chance to win the big jackpot. This is our dream. This is why we
came to America. To make it big.''
   Tran, who lives in a three-room apartment with eight other people
in the city's run-down Tenderloin District, was undaunted by the
1-in-14-million odds of picking the correct six numbers out of 49
numbers.
   In the Southern California community of Ojai, 70 miles northwest
of Los Angeles, Henry Anderson spent $100 on lottery tickets at the
Attitude Adjustment liquor store. ``I'm going for broke,'' he said.
``Maybe I am already, though.''
   The jackpot for Saturday's drawing was estimated in the
$55-million range Thursday after four previous jackpots had no
winners and were rolled over, or added, to the prize.
   With gambling heavier than conservatively estimated, the
state-run lottery on Friday revised the projected jackpot _ which
also is fed by sales _ upward to more than $57 million.
   The lottomania that has stricken Californians means almost
certainly that the figure will go higher _ perhaps $60 million _
before betting is cut off just before the televised drawing at 7:57
p.m., Taylor said.
   ``Sales are just fantastic,'' said Tom Licouris at Uncle Tom's
Liquors in the San Joaquin Valley community of Fresno. ``I've never
seen it start so early. This is the biggest I've ever seen. Since
they missed (having a winner) the other night, they've been coming
in like crazy.''
   Miles Turquist's 7-Eleven store in the Sierra Nevada community of
Truckee, 20 miles southwest of Reno, sells more lotto tickets than
any other California retailer because thousands of Nevada residents,
who account for 95 percent of his business, flock to his store each
week.
   Although Nevada has legalized gambling, the state doesn't have a
lottery.
   Turquist said that as usual he was keeping extra employees on
hand to handle the crowd. ``When lottomania hits, well, everybody
works and we've got lines out the store and down the street,'' he
said.

NEAR-RECORD LOTTERY JACKPOT IS SPLIT 9 WAYS

<P>
Gamblers from San Diego to Milpitas celebrated their share in nine winning 
lotto tickets Thursday but, with so many winners, the near-record 
$56.34-million jackpot was carved into prizes of routine size. 
</P>
<P>
Each holder, or holders, of a Lotto 6/49 ticket with all six correct numbers 
out of the field of 49 won $6.2 million, said California Lottery spokesman John 
Schade. 
</P>
<P>
The prizes will be paid in annual installments of about $250,000 after taxes 
over 20 years -- a little more than would be received by a single winner of the 
game's normal jackpot of about $5 million. The estimated jackpot for Saturday 
is $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
At least one group shares one of the winning tickets, reducing their individual 
take still further. Twenty friends in a San Diego office of Pacific Bell who 
pooled their money came up with one of the winning tickets in the Wednesday 
night drawing. Splitting the prize 20 ways works out to about $12,500 each for 
20 years, after taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"Last night, I made a lot of plans for the $110,000 a year I thought we'd be 
getting," said one of the San Diego winners, Rick Kruger. "Driving to work this 
morning, I heard on the radio there were nine winning tickets, so I started 
computing in my head, 'Let's see, from $110,000 to $12,000. I've got to call my 
wife and tell her not to quit her job.' " 
</P>

Another winning ticket was purchased in San Diego and two in Los Angeles, 
Schade said. The other winning tickets were bought in Milpitas, Pomona, Baker, 
Hesperia and Sherman Oaks, he said.

<P>
The lottery was still in the process of verifying the winners Thursday 
afternoon, Schade said.

Two Northern California men took an expensive chance at the huge lotto jackpot 
by buying more than 20,000 tickets. They failed to win the big one.

Jerry Therault and an unidentified neighbor put down $20,075 for quick-pick 
tickets -- those on which a computer picks the numbers -- at the Village Bottle 
Shop in Scotts Valley in Santa Cruz County. There were no jackpot winners in 
Scotts Valley.

Checking Numbers 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether Therault and his neighbor had winning tickets for lesser 
amounts. He and his wife, Mary-Ann, had neighbors over Thursday night to help 
check numbers on the piles of lotto tickets. 
</P>
<P>
More than 66 million $1 tickets were purchased since last Saturday by gamblers 
hoping to beat the one-in-14-million odds of winning the jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
There were 37 tickets with five of six numbers plus the bonus number. Each of 
those tickets is worth $190,611, Schade said. Fifteen of those tickets were 
purchased in Northern California and 22 in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
In the no-bonus five of six category, 1,494 winners won $2,432. In the four of 
six category 74,055 players each won $44, and 1,286,909 players will collect $5 
dollars apiece for picking three correct numbers. 
</P>
<P>
The winning numbers picked in a televised drawing were 2, 32, 21, 11, 28, 19 
and the bonus number was 27.
