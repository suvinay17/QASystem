<HEAD>Beethoven Reportedly Suffered From Rare Rheumatic Disorder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ludwig van Beethoven, the composer who gradually
went deaf, lost his hearing and died from a rare rheumatic disorder
that is easily treated by modern medicine, a doctor was quoted
Sunday as saying.
   The theory challenges previous claims that the German composer's
deafness was caused by syphilis and that he died from liver failure
brought on by alcoholism, the Sunday Times said in reporting the
findings.
   The newspaper said Dr. Tom Palferman, a rheumatologist and
amateur cellist, has spent 10 years sifting through Beethoven's
private letters and autopsy reports to arrive at his diagnosis. It
said his findings will be published in the Royal Journal of
Medicine this month.
   ``I approached the problem as if Beethoven was one of my own
patients,'' Palferman told the newspaper.
   His theory is that Beethoven died of sarcoidosis, which affects
hearing and eventually destroys the liver, the newspaper said. The
doctor believes Beethoven could have been treated with modern
steroids and his life saved by a liver transplant.
   The composer lived from 1770 to 1827.

FT  27 AUG 94 / Arts: The Borodin Quartet takes up Beethoven theme - Music
in Edinburgh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just in case the moral seriousness of Beethoven looks as though it might
make a heavy theme for a festival, Edinburgh has thrown in Chabrier as well.
Whoever brought these two composers together certainly has a sense of
humour, but at least the two together are providing variety.
That a composer as well-known as Beethoven should have been chosen at all as
a festival theme has been criticised in some quarters, which is hardly fair.
Leaving aside the need to attract an audience, a big international festival
like Edinburgh will always have to focus on composers who left great music
across as wide a range of disciplines as possible, preferably including
opera as well as orchestral and solo music. Beethoven fits the bill - just.
His weak area was opera, but the festival director, Brian McMaster, neatly
side-stepped that problem by offering a 'Fidelio day' that widened our view
of Beethoven's experience in opera to take in the years of struggle and
re-writing during which Fidelio was born.
The rest of Edinburgh's Beethoven is less adventurous. Assorted pianists are
offering piano sonatas and all nine of the symphonies are being performed by
sundry orchestras, both period and modern. No attempt to be dogmatic about
performance style there.
For the string quartets, the Borodin String Quartet has monopolised the
field. The Borodin is of course, a modern-instrument quartet. (Although
period orchestras are making notable headway with Beethoven, period chamber
groups have had less success; perhaps four period strings just sound too
thin and scratchy in our present-day recital halls.)
There need never be any complaint about tonal blend when the Borodin is
playing. Over nearly 50 years, and despite changing its personnel on the
way, this quartet has maintained an admirably civilised tone quality, second
to none for subtlety. Its Beethoven mornings in the Queen's Hall this year
were far removed from the Lindsay's strenuous, abrasive combat or the
Emerson's hard-edged intelligence, but perhaps that was half the problem.
Of their five programmes, I attended two. The early quartets - Op. 18, Nos 4
and 5 - were playful in the gallant manner, elegant court games, not
Beethovenian rough-and-tumble. The sforzandos needed a tougher attack.  In
the A Major's slow movement one of the variations was nevertheless
marvellously rapt.
Of the two mature quartets, the concise Op. 95 held together better than Op.
130, which passed through some finely cultivated passages without suggesting
it had any decisive goal in mind.
Trenchant Beethoven playing only firmly took the stage with the Grosse Fuge,
a challenge to which all four players roused themselves with fire in the
belly.
That performance drew enough applause to warrant an encore. The Borodin
Quartet is among Edinburgh's favourites: hopefully it will be back next
year, whatever the theme.
The Queen's Hall recitals were sponsored by the Bank of Scotland; and
Fidelio by the Royal Bank of Scotland

FT  16 APR 94 / Arts: Sweet music to their ears - Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the eyes of the public, but not academics, the major auction houses have
an outstanding reputation for scholarship. And yet their experts often
wrongly catalogue an item for sale. Often this makes little difference to
the price, but occasionally the percipient dealer can pick up for a hundred
pounds or so an object worth hundreds of thousands, even millions.
The most embarassing examples in recent years have involved Old Master
paintings and Renaissance bronzes, but in a specialist London book auction
last year an attentive browser came across a musical manuscript in a job lot
which looked as if it might be valuable. For a start there were six staves
on the page, which meant that it was English and pre-1720.
The lot cost little, but on May 26 Sotheby's hopes to make at least Pounds
300,000 from what its experts Dr Stephen Roe and Simon Maguire consider to
be the most interesting musical manuscript to have emerged in decades. The
small calf bound volume contains 21 pieces for the harpsichord in the hand
of Purcell, the only autograph keyboard music by the late 17th century
British composer yet known.
Pre-1700 autograph manuscripts are exceptionally rare. No one knows what
music in the hand of Palestrina or Scarlatti or Monteverdi looks like: no
certain examples have emerged. Hence the excitement over the Purcell. The
auction record is for another discovery, nine autograph symphonies by
Mozart, believed lost, which surfaced in 1987 and sold for Pounds 2.6m.
Fortunately for Sotheby's, and the vendor, Purcell, along with Byrd, is the
only British composer sought by the leading collectors. The fact that music
is an international language ensures that there is a global market, and
gives some protection from national recessions. But demand is selective.
Elgar and Vaughan Williams appeal little to the major German and Swiss
collectors, although Britten has some attracion. In the main the most
popular composers command the top prices - Mozart followed by Beethoven
(Pounds 1.1m for a piano sonata). And the major scores attract the keenest
interest: the market really arrived when Stravinsky's Rite of Spring sold
for Pounds 330,000 in 1982, at the height of a recession.
Like Old Masters and Impressionists the great musical scores - the Mozart,
Wagner and Puccini operas; the Beethoven string quartets; the Tchaikovsky
symphonies - are now mainly in museums and secure collections. But some
major works have yet to be pinned down. No one knows where Beethoven's
manuscript for the Hammerklavier sonata is, or whether it still exists.
Wagner's opera Rienzi is believed to have disappeared with Hitler when his
Berlin bunker was destroyed, but might have survived. Puccini's La Rondine
is another work which might leak into the saleroom one day.
The inflation in prices has naturally attracted the forgers and fraudsters.
Some of the most celebreated recent examples, like the apparant emergence of
some unknown Haydn sonatas last year, were just attempts to make
presumptious scholars look foolish. As soon as the actual manuscripts,
rather than photographs, were studied there could be no mistaking the 20th
century paper. But Christie's had to quickly withdraw half a dozen lots from
its recent auction, and there are always attempts to add a forged signature
to a composer's printed score or photograph.
Sotheby's auction is its largest ever in the field, with over 430 lots,
including manuscripts and letters by Haydn, Beethoven, Mahler and Verdi. The
recession has depressed demand, but in the main musical manuscripts have
borne up well.

FT  02 JUL 93 / Arts: Cherubini's Beethoven - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not old Cherubini the Franco-Italian opera composer, but the young(ish),
all-German Cherubini Quartet, who are delivering the complete 'cycle' of
Beethoven quartets at the Wigmore Hall. Though they have not yet recorded
anything by their eponym, their recent recording of all Mendelssohn's
quartets has excited admiration and delight.
On Wednesday, during the first three numbers of Beethoven's opus 18, one
could hear what excellent Mendelssohn interpreters they must be. About their
Beethoven I was less persuaded. Since they are not merely born-again
Mendelssohnians but highly cultivated performers, they offered many passing
rewards and suave insights; transparent balance too, unimpeachable tempi, a
cool, intellectual grasp of structure - and even some calculatedly playful
moments. Yet there was never much muscle, despite their incisive fortissimo
playing, nor much sign of young Beethoven's truculent thrust.
Their leader, Christoph Poppen, is a violinist with a soft, sensitive timbre
of no great amplitude. In the romantic drama of the 'Adagio affetuoso ed
appassionata' of the F major quartet, for example, while the lower strings
grew properly forceful and doomy his own song - which should carry warmly
over it all - remained gentle and wan. In the G major, where Beethoven plays
at being gracious whilst emitting constant hints of something more
rumbustious, graciousness was all.
More typical of their best strengths was their subito diminuendo, an artful
drop into keen whispers, which they exploited often; also their delicate,
knowing indentation of musical paragraphs, accomplished with unanimous
fluency. Finesse of that kind is ideal for Mendelssohn, a precociously
conservative composer who never needed to advertise himself, whose radical
turns were always disguised by perfect polish. The Beethoven of the opus 18
quartets, however, was determined to show not only how well he had mastered
the arch-Classical medium, after Haydn and Mozart, but how much unfamiliar,
unsettling power he could invest in it.
That was scarcely to be felt here. At the Cherubini's hands, the young Turk
was made to sound like a serenely assured old pro. Far from aiming to
recapture the original force of the music, they dressed it reverently in
period costume. It should be interesting, at least, to hear how they adapt
their pretty style to the towering last quartets which come at the end of
their cycle on July 7, 9 and 10.

RICHARD GOODE PLAYS 4 BEETHOVEN SONATAS AT PAVILION
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALBERT GOLDBERG
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the active concert repertory dwindles almost from day to day for lack of
nourishing replenishment, the opportunities for performing specialization
likewise shrinks apace.
</P>
<P>
Richard Goode, the American-born and trained pianist who played a Beethoven
recital in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on Monday night, may resent this
categorization, for he does on occasion indeed play music other than Beethoven.
But when a pianist records all the Beethoven sonatas, as Goode has done, and
goes about playing recitals devoted to that composer, he must expect to be
regarded as a specialist.
</P>
<P>
The Beethoven that Goode offered at his recital did not project an air of
finality. It did not convince for a moment that this was the last word, or that
nothing is left to be said on the subject.
</P>
<P>
It was actually rather understated and repressed Beethoven, that had a good
deal to do with clean, fluent piano playing, but very little to do with a
tempestuous composer hurling thunderbolts at heaven and earth.
</P>
<P>
The four sonatas that Goode selected -- Opus 31, No. 1 in G; Opus 81a in
E-flat; Opus 101 in A, and Opus 111 in C minor -- were set forth as neatly as
official blueprints. The designs were clear, the notes and interpretive ideas
indisputably correct, but the music seldom roused to vivid life. It made
pleasant listening, it seemed to hold the public attention and it stirred up a
few bravos. But the style was small, an academic shadow hovered over all and
passion was a sometime thing.
</P>
<P>
Still, that may be better than tearing it to tatters. You could honestly say
that this was civilized, mannerly, polite and unpretentious. But eloquent, it
was not. ALBERT GOLDBERG

<HEADLINE>  POLIVNICK SHOWS A FIRM GRIP ON BEETHOVEN, WAGNER  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Polivnick showed himself in secure control Friday, with a clear beat and a
thorough immersion in his music. He is technically skilled, evoking high
polish from the string and woodwind sound. He let the brass and drums
overwhelm more than once, however, in the Wagner "Rienzi" Overture opening the
program.;   Imbalances of the overture aside, Polivnick acquitted himself
nicely, catching the pomp of the piece, and leading from memory.;   The
Beethoven Fifth is a work of grandeur too. Polivnick accompanied responsively,
though the first movement was very tentative.;   Pianist Santiago Rodriguez
proved as mercurial in his performance as in his career, which has seen many
ups and downs since he took second in the Cliburn Competition a decade ago.
His impact in this brilliant piece waxed and waned, ranging from the
pedestrian to the sublime. I was impressed by his anti-virtuosic approach,
viewing the opus neither as a showpiece nor as a sonnet, but rather as a
vigorous, closely meshed interaction with the ensemble.;   By the third
movement, Rodriguez, Polivnick and orchestra were as one, propelled in unity
to the final cadences, which brought a warm audience response.;   Polivnick's
program is an unexpected one, showing fewer contrasts -- and therefore less of
his diversity -- than other programs offered by guest conductors in the past
year.;   The novelty on the program was Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an
Exhibition," offered not in the familiar 1922 orchestration by Ravel but in
the much more recent setting by the Russian-born Vladimir Ashkenazy. This
orchestration is being heard in San Jose for the first time.;   The choice of
instrumental solos in the piece is, of course, entirely arbitrary. In the "Old
Castle" section, Ravel's saxophone solo becomes an oboe d'amore in the
Ashkenazy version. And in the "Ox Cart" section, Ashkenazy gives Ravel's high
tuba solo to the entire horn section. The result is "heavier . . . and more
Russian" than Ravel, as Polivnick pointed out this week in an interview.;
The one clear plus of the new version is the correction of earlier errors in
Mussorgsky's published piano score. The Ashkenazy is neither as brilliant, nor
as idiomatic in its orchestration as the Ravel; I find it a paler, coarser and
at times downright awkward construction.;   Polivnick brought out its big
gestures with a flourish. Numerous stirring solos rained down on the
appreciative audience, including the showiness of James Dooley's trumpet and
the feistiness of Byung-Woo Kim's violin.; San Jose Symphony; Paul Polivnick,

ON THE RECORD: CELEBRATING A NON-CELEBRITY QUINTET
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The quintets Mozart and Beethoven wrote for piano and winds are frequently
recorded, inevitably appearing as a coupling. The Quintet in E-flat, K. 452,
was a favorite of Mozart's among his own works (Beethoven's Opus 16, in the
same key, is delightful but rather too obviously a knockoff) and it has proven
attractive as a recording vehicle for celebrity pianists, among them Murray
Perahia, Radu Lupu, Alfred Brendel, Andre Previn and James Levine.
</P>
<P>
It is, however, not music frequently encountered in live circumstances since it
is scored for winds rather than the usual string quartet.
</P>
<P>
The aforementioned big names notwithstanding, the piece's manifold beauties are
more consistently exhibited and its problems most successfully solved by a less
starry pianist, Carol Rosenberger, within the context of stunningly
accomplished work by present and former members of the Los Angeles Chamber
Orchestra: oboist Allan Vogel, clarinetist David Shifrin, bassoonist Kenneth
Munday and hornist Robin Graham (Delos 3024).
</P>
<P>
Mozart's most problematic writing occurs at the very outset, where the piano's
bare chords, unsupported by sustained wind phrases, create wide-open spaces
that cry out for ornamentation but receive it too cautiously or not at all from
other interpreters.
</P>
<P>
Rosenberger, through the simple expedient of arpeggiating those opening chords,
allows the music to coalesce and take off, and when ornamentation is suggested,
here and elsewhere in the score, she takes appropriate, tasteful advantage.
</P>
<P>
But what Rosenberger offers isn't merely convincing from a musicological or
structural standpoint. Her playing -- in both Mozart and Beethoven -- sparkles
with wit and intelligence, as does that of her colleagues.
</P>
<P>
While Brahms' Clarinet Quintet is hardly a stranger to our concert halls, one
would be hard put to recall a live performance (perhaps even one on recordings)
with the degree of thoughtfulness, warmth and ensemble polish shown in a new
recorded version by David Shifrin and fellow members of Chamber Music
Northwest, the annual event that makes Portland a summer paradise for
aficionados of the intimate muse.
</P>
<P>
The accompanying work (on Delos 3066) is the less frequently encountered Brahms
String Quintet in G, Opus 111. It is lamentable, considering the parade of
string quartets to which we are annually treated in Southern California, that
not one is ever sufficiently enterprising to add the second viola which would
allow us to hear the small, choice repertory for string quintet.
</P>
<P>
At any rate, the G-major Quartet is given a soaringly dramatic, songful reading
here by the Chamber Music Northwest strings (all, in fact, New York-based):
violinists Ani and Ida Kavafian, violists Walter Trampler and Steven Tenenbom,
and cellist Fred Sherry, who with the exception of Tenenbom are also heard in
the Clarinet Quintet.
</P>
<P>
Beethoven's sole string quintet, in C, Opus 29, is neglected even on
recordings, perhaps because "early Beethoven" is still regarded with
insufficient seriousness by Romantically inclined interpreters and critics. Too
bad, for Opus 29 is a beauty, dramatic and tuneful without the sweat and
complexity of the late works.
</P>
<P>
Its compact disc debut (Nimbus 5207) is energetically, if roughly presented by
Britain's Medici Quartet and violist Simon Rowland Jones, but the coupling was
ill-chosen: Beethoven's First "Rasumovsky" Quartet as part of the Medici's
ongoing Beethoven quartet cycle. The competition here is overwhelming and the
Medicis do not give the impression of being world class.
</P>
<P>
One of the masterpieces of the tiny repertory of vocal chamber music is Ravel's
"Chansons madecasses" for voice, flute, cello and piano and a midpriced re-
release (Elektra/Nonesuch 71355) of the dozen-year-old recording featuring the
late Jan DeGaetani serves as a fitting memorial to that treasurable artist.
DeGaetani's coolly precise, soft-grained vocal delivery is strikingly
contrasted to the exotically sexy lyrics, "collected and translated" by an
18th-Century literary faker, the Vicomte de Parny, who in fact neither visited
the land of their supposed origin, Madagascar, nor spoke its language.
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the exceptionally attractive Ravel program is devoted to the
Sonata for Violin and Cello (Isidore Cohen and Timothy Eddy, respectively) and
a pair of rare two-piano pieces, "Sites auriculaires" and "Frontispice",
enlisting the services of Gilbert Kalish, Teresa Sterne and the late Paul
Jacobs.

INTERPRETATION KEY TO HOT SUMMERFEST

<P>
SummerFest '89 continues to surprise its Sherwood Hall audiences -- and for all
the right reasons. Some surprises have come from exotic repertory -- rare
specimens such as the recent Mel Powell opus String Quartet and Edward Elgar's
Piano Quintet. But even when the programming has not been that unusual, the
interpretations have consistently offered new insights into familiar music.
</P>
<P>
Friday night's concert to a full house of about 500 listeners provided two such
unexpected journeys.
</P>
<P>
Ravel's F Minor String Quartet, a staple of the quartet circuit, usually
receives a kid-glove approach that savors its translucent harmonies and hovers
over its delicate textures. In the hands of, say, the Tokyo String Quartet, the
piece borders on a precious parody of every flowery textbook definition of
musical Impressionism. Friday's Ravel offering was quite another matter.
</P>
<P>
Unlike an ensemble that has long worked together to produce a finely blended
sound, the four SummerFest string players do not regularly work together.
Violinists Masuko Ushioda and Julie Rosenfeld, and violist Toby Hoffman exhibit
strong, individual musical personalities, which gave both a less refined
texture and a far more energetic, vibrant interpretation of the piece. Bold,
animated, even angular describe the three fast movements.
</P>
<P>
In the Ravel piece's slow movement, Hoffman's luminous, sensual solo was
nothing less than a revelation. Second violinist Rosenfeld (she is the Colorado
String Quartet's first violin) played with equal bravura to Ushioda's
forthright lead. Only the overly proper -- almost aloof -- cellist Peter Reijto
failed to share this unusual but vigorous vision of the work.
</P>
<P>
Violinist Cho-Liang Lin made Beethoven's E-flat Piano Trio, Op. 70, No. 2, soar
with his simultaneously elegant and passionate playing. Lin's enthusiasm for
the work riveted this listener's attention from the first phrase. He was
well-partnered at the keyboard by David Golub, whose crisp, well-accented
realization of the score exploited its asymmetrical phrases and structure with
uncommon grace.
</P>
<P>
Cellist Ralph Kirshbaum shared this approach to the Beethoven composition, and
his phrasing admirably mirrored Lin's. But in contrast to Lin's ever-smiling
sonority, Kirshbaum rarely emerged from a labored grimace.
</P>
<P>
Between the Beethoven Trio and the Ravel Quartet, five SummerFest wind players
gave Hindemith's Kleine Kammermusik, Op. 24, No. 2, an emotionally restrained
but engaging performance, one that refuted the work's reputation as a relic of
well-crafted neoclassical carpentry.
</P>
<P>
On most programs, this reading would have been exemplary, especially with
bassoonist Dennis Michel's plaintive declamations and flutist Damian
Bursill-Hall's deftly sculpted lines. (The other players were oboist Allan
Vogel, clarinetist David Peck and Richard Todd, French horn.)
</P>
<P>
Friday night, however, it was diminished by its stellar company.

YOUTHFUL GERMAN QUARTET SPARKLES ON A SOVIET GEM
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH HERMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Though the program book was not emblazoned with the now-familiar red logo of
the San Diego Soviet arts festival, Saturday evening's Auryn Quartet concert at
UC San Diego's Mandeville Auditorium did feature a minor treasure of the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
The youthful, visiting ensemble from Cologne, West Germany, opened the 15th
season of UCSD's chamber music series with a compelling performance of Alfred
Schnittke's Third String Quartet.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1934, Schnittke is considered one of the leading Russian composers from
the generation after Shostakovich. At last year's Soviet arts festival in
Boston, Schnittke's Requiem Mass for chorus and orchestra was one of the major
musical performances of that cultural exchange. This UCSD event was not part of
the current Soviet Arts festival, but the performance of Schnittke's work
expands the festival's portrait of contemporary Soviet music.
</P>
<P>
Schnittke's three-movement quartet, written in 1983, revealed that the composer
is keenly aware of trends in Western European composition. Although his idiom
is demanding, it is not daunting. Like Western composers who have taken their
cues from Edgar Varese, Schnittke values sound for its own sake and tends to
use sonic clusters as motivic building blocks.
</P>
<P>
Though this approach made the Third Quartet's droning, modal first movement
seem unusually static, the rest of the work was replete with contrasting ideas
organized by a recurring dissonant chorale theme. The composer even included an
agitated, highly motoric section that sounded like an homage to Shostakovich.
If Schnittke's structure was elusive on a first hearing, surely his dense
concentration of feeling was unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
The Auryn Quartet (violinists Matthias Lingenfelder and Jens Oppermann, violist
Steuart Eaton and cellist Andreas Arndt) followed the usual practice and
surrounded this unknown contemporary work with two familiar offerings,
Beethoven's A Major Quartet, Op. 18, No. 5, and his F Major Quartet, Op. 135.
Neither performance shed new light on these works, although the A Major Quartet
was notable for unusually clean delineation and a sunny balance among the
players. Beethoven's Op. 135, however, received a perfunctory and sometimes
ill-tuned reading.
</P>
<P>
All that jazz. Although the surprises in the world of music resulting from
glasnost cannot compete with the startling political events unfolding in
Eastern Europe, they are worth noting. Tonight at Elario's in La Jolla, two San
Diego Symphony guest soloists in town for the Soviet arts festival will hold a
unique jam session. Russian pianist Nicolai Petrov and U.S. clarinetist Richard
Stoltzman will play a program of American jazz for 150 friends and supporters
of the symphony.
</P>
<P>
These two soloists can be heard in their usual context Nov. 2-3 at Symphony
Hall, when Petrov will play the West Coast premiere of Rodion Shchedrin's
Second Piano Concerto and Stoltzman will perform American composer John
Corigliano's 1977 Clarinet Concerto.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Batting 0 for 2. The San Diego Symphony has not been having any luck thus far
importing guest conductors for the Soviet arts festival.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Soviet conductor Evgeny Kolobov failed to show for the orchestra's
"Alexander Nevsky" production. Now this week, Soviet conductor Pavel Kogan
canceled his Nov. 2-4 symphony concerts on account of illness.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Jansoug Kakhidze, San Diego Opera's guest conductor for its "Boris
Godunov" production, was able to fill in for Kogan on short notice. One of the
featured works on Kogan's program is Rodion Shchedrin's Second Piano Concerto,
a work performed only a few times in this country. In an interview before
"Boris Godunov" opened, Kakhidze noted that he was well acquainted with
Shchedrin's concerto, and in fact had conducted it last year in Boston as part
of that American city's Soviet arts festival. Kakhidze, creative director and
principal conductor of Georgia's Tbilisi State Opera Theatre, received high
accolades for his conducting of the San Diego Opera orchestra in "Boris
Godunov." Local culture vultures eagerly await Kakhidze's symphony debut here.
</P>
<P>
Music and the future. In the 19th Century, Richard Wagner immodestly claimed
that he was composing the music of the future. Since Wagner's time, most
composers have been content to write for their own era. UC San Diego's Center
for Music Experiment, however, regularly works on the frontiers of tomorrow's
music.
</P>
<P>
Much of the center's current research will produce the next generation of
musical computers, according to F. Richard Moore, the center's director.
</P>
<P>
"These will be the first computers to have their musical capacity built in
rather than added on," explained Moore, who will lecture on these new
electronic tools and on the related topic of psychoacoustics (the perception of
sound) at the La Jolla Athanaeum Nov. 6 .
</P>
<P>
"Technology in Music and Art," the La Jolla library's current lecture series,
began last night with a lecture by UCSD's Pulitzer Prize-winning resident
composer Roger Reynolds. One of the founders of the center, Reynolds has
composed many of his works using the center's computer facilities. On Nov. 13,
UCSD art professor Harold Cohen will talk about his computer-collaborated
artwork, and all three men will participate in a panel discussion on Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
According to Moore, in the last decade -- he came to the center in 1979 -- the
most significant thing researchers have learned is how little they really know
about musical processes.
</P>
<P>
"At one time, it was common wisdom that, by analyzing the works of great
composers, we could get a computer to write, say, Beethoven's 10th Symphony.
This was one of many early misconceptions," Moore said. He further noted that
breaking down seemingly simple musical expressions into the requisite series of
step-by-step instructions needed for programming computers has usually turned
out to be much more complex than originally thought.
</P>
<P>
Though he was a composer before he became the center's director, composing has
taken a back seat to his research and administrative chores. Moore now
describes himself as a musical engineer, a term Wagner probably never
contemplated when he was looking into the music of his future.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- In Concert:
   Celebrating Haydn
   ----
   By Heidi Waleson
</HL>

<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A7
</SO>
<LP>
   New York -- If the pianist Andras Schiff were running
things, we wouldn't be carrying on about Mozart's
bicentennial. "Mozart doesn't need a year," says Mr. Schiff.
His candidate for celebration is Haydn, whom he believes is
the victim of "huge misconceptions."
   "It's Mozart's fault," Mr. Schiff says. "Somehow, we think
that if we love Mozart then we cannot afford to love Haydn.
In Germany, in Austria, he is a name, not more. Only the
Anglo-Saxons really like him."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So Mr. Schiff recently came to this English-speaking if
not purely Anglo-Saxon stronghold with his own Haydn-boosting
campaign of concerts featuring the composer's late chamber
music. Mr. Schiff played a sonata on each of six programs at
the Metropolitan Museum. He then joined his wife, violinist
Yuuko Shiokawa, and cellist Boris Pergamenschikow for a trio
or two. The young mezzo Cecilia Bartoli stepped in to sing on
one program, John Shirley-Quirk on two others. A string
quartet, played by Mr. Schiff's Hungarian colleagues, the
Takacs Quartet (emigres like the pianist, they are now based
in Colorado Springs), finished out each evening.
   Americans normally don't hear much from Mr. Schiff these
days, except on records, but he makes many of them. He lives
in Salzburg ("it's peaceful there"), and even at the
relatively young age of 38, he is already tired of dashing in
and out of cities. What is more, he is cutting down on his
concerto engagements. "Orchestra concerts are the worst
prepared today," he says. "It's beyond my comprehension why
people like to go to them. I think they like to see a lot of
people onstage. I want to give up playing Mozart concerti.
It's such a frustration. There's no way to get a good
performance with one or two quick rehearsals, and you never
get more."
   Mr. Schiff's idea of a good time is to get down to music
with a small circle of friends. The Haydn event, first heard
in 1988 at Wigmore Hall in London, reportedly to great
acclaim, and headed next for Vienna, is just one example. Mr.
Schiff has his own little festival playground at Mondsee,
Austria, where for 10 days each fall he and his chums focus
on two composers. This year, Schubert and Janacek will be
dissected.
   In Cologne, he plays with a woodwind and piano quintet
(Heinz Holliger is the oboist) that is busy commissioning new
works from composers as thorny and Olympian as Elliott
Carter. He also estimates that at least half of his concerts
are solo recitals. His predilection there is also for
one-composer concerts. Lately his focus has been Bach, and
beginning in 1992, he will be playing the 18 Schubert sonatas
on six programs destined for Vienna, Budapest, London, Paris,
and . . . maybe . . . New York.
   Mr. Schiff says he was first attracted to Haydn's humor,
and from there to the composer's remarkably sophisticated
manipulations of the classical style. "Haydn always surprises
you," he says. "You know how the theme in a rondo always
comes back. Well, Haydn always delays it, and it never comes
when you expect it. It makes you laugh out loud. It's a
wonderfully bubbly feeling. But you play these things in
central Europe, and nobody laughs."
   With that kind of buildup, one would have expected the
Haydn Festival to be a cross between a romp and an
intellectual voyage into the labyrinths of the classical
style. But the first two concerts did not turn out that way.
Mr. Schiff's traversal of the C major Piano Sonata (Hob.
XVI:50) was promisingly light and crisp, but the Trio in F
sharp minor (Hob. XV:26) was ominously full-bodied and
somber, while the evening's second Trio, (D major, Hob.
XV:24) was downright dour.
   Gradually, one got the feeling of a different subtext at
work in this festival. Haydn, Mr. Schiff contends, is not
taken seriously. So what do we do to change that? Play him as
though he were Beethoven, whom everybody takes seriously.
   Beethoven's roots were certainly in Haydn's music, as the
festival's overly dry and pedantic program notes were at
pains to point out. So Mr. Schiff makes the association even
tighter. Reversing Roger Norrington's strategy, of injecting
some of Haydn's spirit into Beethoven, Mr. Schiff transfuses
Haydn with some raging Beethovenian torment.
   At the sold-out, seats-on-the-stage first concert, Mr.
Schiff performed the cantata "Arianna a Naxos" with Ms.
Bartoli, who has spectacular low notes and a beautifully
produced sound. She hit her emotional peak halfway through
the piece and found nowhere else to go. She also seemed a bit
constrained, as though she had little faith that her
strapless gown would hold its own if she really let loose.
The Takacs then finished up with an airless, middle-European
reading of the Quartet Opus 76 No. 1.
   There were happier moments at the more sparsely attended
second concert. The third movement of the Trio in E flat
(Hob. XV:29) erupted into a joyful, driving dance, as the
three players seemed to catch a mood and start to have a good
time. And the Takacs let up a bit on the drama in the Quartet
Opus 76 No. 2 and started to play clearly. It showed off
Haydn's twists and turns on their own merits, though the
overall mood was still closer to the unkempt Beethoven than
Haydn's tidy wig.
   Mr. Schiff did not give New York the Haydn who is newly
beloved in AngloSaxon halls. The English, the Americans and
the Dutch are the champions of "authenticity." Mr. Schiff is
Hungarian-born and trained, though he left his country in
1979 with no regrets. His impeccable playing, usually
note-perfect, splendidly colored, voiced and accented, is in
service to other gods, and his total immersion in the music
of this particular composer seems to have resulted in a
curious discrepancy between theory and practice.

FT  06 FEB 92 / Arts: Lindsay Quartet - Queen Elizabeth Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To a packed house on Tuesday the Lindsay played Beethoven and Ravel, and
Schumann's piano quintet with the 1990 Leeds winner Artur Pizarro. As we
expect from them, every performance was both exciting and seriously
interesting. In their impassioned Beethoven - the C minor Quartet from opus
18 - there was a newly emphatic twist in the Finale. Their leader Peter
Cropper gave the rising phrase that ends the main tune a sharp
whipcrack-sting, and later Bernard Gregor-Smith's cello marked the switch
into C major with the same explosive flash.
Once heard, not only not forgotten but instantly persuasive: that must have
been what Beethoven meant, for it magnetised the whole movement.
For these players, Ravel's early quartet is some way off the paths they have
been cultivating. The Lindsay made their name with the Viennese classics,
Bartok, Tippett; they have expanded eastwards - notably to Janacek - and
also backwards, but not much in other directions. (A dozen or so years ago I
tried to persuade them to look at Elliott Carter's Quartet no. 1, which they
could play magnificently, but either they didn't take the bait or they
didn't like it.) France has been unexplored territory. In this Ravel, they
took heroic care to curb their customary thrust for the sake of a properly
soignee Gallic surface.
The opening Allegro moderato sounded frail and lovely, but almost enervated.
Hugh Wood's lively programme-notes declared that by comparison with
Debussy's mature Quartet, Ravel's is 'frankly feminine: like a very
beautiful cat': true as far as it goes - but there are rippling muscles
beneath the velvet, and the balance of the whole piece requires that they be
felt from the start.
In the crackling pizzicato Scherzo the Lindsay of course got the bit between
their teeth, and they made a much better fist of the Finale (too frantic and
too thin, in a Conservatoire vein that Ravel never tapped again) than most
quartets do. Between those movements, their Tres lent was deceptively simple
and poignant.
Though they are no more than middle-aged, the Lindsay were probably trying
out Schumann's quintet before Artur Pizarro was born. It showed. With eyes
glued to the piano-score, young Pizarro was a model of good taste, alertness
and controlled energy - a faultless team-member, in fact; but in his hands,
scarcely one phrase had the sculpted expressive force that his Lindsay
partners gave it.
No doubt he was too polite, or too honest, to force anything upon the music
which might be naively tendentious. It was odd, nonetheless, to hear the
instrument that usually bids to dominate Schumann's proceedings, by reason
of its rich musical role, reduced to the level of faithful athletic support.

MUSIC AND DANCE NEWS: PERLMAN, CLOSE TO HOST OVATION AWARDS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Itzhak Perlman and Glenn Close will host the third annual Ovation Awards --
honoring current recordings of classical music and the performers who make them
-- at Carnegie Hall in New York City Oct. 26.
</P>
<P>
The awards show will be taped for later broadcast on radio and television,
according to Sharon Dec, coordinator of the awards for Ovation magazine. In
1988, the awards program was shown on cable (Arts &amp; Entertainment). This
year, Dec says, the management is seeking sponsors for network distribution.
</P>
<P>
With awards scheduled in 14 categories, voting by a 250-member panel made up of
music professionals and Ovation readers, begins this week.
</P>
<P>
"The voting, in a window of time between Saturday and Aug. 15," says Dec, "is
by a computerized telephone system. The voters have an access code as a group,
and each one has another, individual access code. After each participant has
voted, the separate code will be destroyed."
</P>
<P>
The voters fall into two groups. The first, which Dec refers to as the
"credentialed group," comprises 125 professionals -- music critics from
newspapers and magazines, professional record buyers from retail outlets and
program directors from classical music radio stations. This group's votes are
"weighted two to one," Dec says, against the votes of the second group of 125
music-lovers who are subscribers to Ovation magazine.
</P>
<P>
None of the names of the voters can be revealed, another spokesman for the
awards show told The Times last week. This in accordance with the rules laid
down by the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse, which will tabulate the
results and keep them secret until the Oct. 26 event.
</P>
<P>
The nomination procedure, according to Dec, was this: More than 55 record
companies submitted more than 300 recordings for consideration. A panel of six
judges from the national music community -- Robert Conrad, Dave Conant, Israel
Horowitz, Denise Pineau, Paul Turok and John von Rhein -- listened to these
recordings and submitted their rankings. From these, the list of competitors in
14 categories was made up.
</P>
<P>
What each of the 14 winners -- plus 11 recipients of special, uncategorized
awards -- will take home is a silver sculpture designed by Vivianne Bulow-Hube
of Georg Jensen Silversmiths.

ON THE RECORD: THE QUARTET SCENE, EAST AND WEST
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
String quartets were once classified according to certain perceived national
characteristics. The typical American group (forget about the melting pot) was
a tough bunch whose work was predicated on drive and hard edges. East European
ensembles were purveyors of a lush, rhythmically free style. Britons were
undemonstrative, etc.
</P>
<P>
While once there may have been some validity in such simplifications, the
listener unfamiliar with the performers' names in recent chamber music
recordings would be unlikely to determine their national origins.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Lindsay String Quartet brings a powerful ensemble personality to
three Haydn quartets: in F minor, Opus 20, No. 5; in B-flat, Opus 33, No. 4,
and in D, Opus 71, No. 2, all recorded live at London's premier chamber music
venue, the Wigmore Hall (ASV 674). These are aggressive but hardly slapdash
readings. The Lindsay is attentive to modern scholarship in matters of
Classical articulation without totally forswearing the use of expressive
portamento.
</P>
<P>
And if Czech ensembles are inevitably fat-toned purveyors of Romanticism, then
what is the Panocha Quartet doing playing the first four of Haydn's magical
Opus 33 quartets (Supraphon 0634, mid-price) with such short-stroke lightness,
such zippy incisiveness and elegant wit? The question is rhetorical.
</P>
<P>
From Hungary comes the New Budapest Quartet, a daring name if ever there was
one, with what would seem to be its debut recording (Hyperion 66401). While
these gentlemen may not efface memories of the Budapest Quartet, the present
group has a claim to authenticity denied their illustrious predecessor: the old
Budapest in its final and finest configuration comprised four Russian-born
Americans.
</P>
<P>
The "New" group presents the first two quartets of Beethoven's Opus 18 in
finely tuned, sweet-toned readings that miss some of the edginess and
presentiments of later-Beethoven danger lurking in both scores. Perhaps one
could summon more enthusiasm for their playing if we were offered something
more necessary than this first installment of yet another Beethoven cycle.
</P>
<P>
The prospect of the 20th CD version of Schubert's "Death and the Maiden" (MCA
25899) didn't rouse the passions, either. Still, the New World String Quartet,
Harvard University's first quartet in residence, demands attention, responding
with undeniable skill and flair to the familiar measures.
</P>
<P>
The New World, as captured in MCA's attractively intimate sonics, has a big,
warm ensemble tone joined to a driving style that moves the music along smartly
but with no feeling of haste. The coupling finds the New World illuminating
much earlier, but hardly negligible, Schubert, his Quartet in G minor, D. 173.
</P>
<P>
If a Russian school of quartet playing still exists, its vestiges reside in
Moscow's venerable, venerated Borodin Quartet. While its kind of grand manner
is sorely missed in some repertory, the Borodin's big-toned, emotionally
generous style is as ill-suited to the flickering half-lights of the Debussy
and Ravel Quartets as is the over-resonant recording (Virgin Classics 91077).
</P>
<P>
London's hot-ticket Arditti String Quartet, which specializes in 20th-Century
scores -- consider them a Kronos Quartet without the props, funky threads and
carefully cultivated mystique -- has begun what promises to be an exciting
series for the French Disques Montaigne label. The initial release (without
catalogue number) pairs the two works in the medium by Alban Berg: the String
Quartet, Opus 3, and the "Lyric Suite."
</P>
<P>
The interpretations blaze with conviction and skill, without quite capturing
the off-kilter lyricism of what some take to be the ironic title of the Suite.
Still, it would be foolish to argue with such technical mastery, or with the
solidity of tone these artists bring to music that is often encountered as a
succession of frenetic scrapes and scratches, distancing us from the score's
elusive emotional core.
</P>
<P>
The Artaria Quartet, while taking its name from the old Viennese publisher of
chamber music, hails from San Francisco, where its members are principals of
the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra. The foursome presents on period instruments
three of Boccherini's six quintets for strings with guitar obbligato (Richard
Savino), including the irresistible G-major Quintet, with its stomping Fandango
finale (Harmonia Mundi 9007026).
</P>
<P>
The playing combines sweetness of tone and rhythmic punch, with Elisabeth Le
Guin meriting particular praise for her skillful execution of the tortuous,
high-lying cello parts.

<TEXT>     The "Save Our Symphony" benefit concerts next weekend at Flint will feature
Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 ("Choral") and Vivaldi's violin concertos, "The
Seasons.";   Vocal soloists for the Beethoven are Evelyn de la Rosa, Donna
Petersen, Daniel Harper and Ronald Gerard. The chorus will be drawn from
several South Bay groups.;   Clearly, a benefit is not the time to bring in
heaps of contemporary music. But the rest of the season tends to confirm that
the orchestra shies away from music by living composers.;   In the mainline
Masterworks series, conductor George Cleve's valedictory season is built
around a survey of Johannes Brahms. It features all four symphonies and the
awe-inspiring Violin Concerto. The season is also sprinkled with other
romantics, such as Gustav Mahler, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Richard Strauss,
Hector Berlioz, Felix Mendelssohn, Sergei Rachmaninoff and Jean Sibelius.;
Only three compositions for more adventurous listeners will surface this
season. One is the rarely heard "Concerto for Piano, Timpani and Two String
Orchestras" by the Czech master Bohuslav Martinu (concerts of Nov. 22-24),
whose centennial is being celebrated this year. The second is Witold
Lutoslawski's "Concerto for Orchestra" (concerts of Feb. 13-16), an early
piece (1950-54) by a highly inventive Polish composer-conductor whose style
has grown by leaps and bounds since then. The third is the sole American
selection, Roy Harris' marvelously concise, neoclassical Symphony No. 3 in One
Movement written in 1938 (concerts of March 12-15), one of the few American
works ever performed and recorded by Arturo Toscanini.;   The Lutoslawski and
Harris programs will also mark the first time a regularly scheduled San Jose
Symphony subscription series has featured four concerts, with the addition
each time of a Thursday-night program at the Center for the Performing Arts.;
 Cleve will conduct all but the first set of the remaining Masterworks season.
It features:;   Nov. 15-17: Music of Hindemith, Mozart, Schumann, with guest
conductor Gabriel Chmura and pianist Franklin Larey.;   Nov. 22-24: Mozart's
Symphony No. 36, Martinu's concerto, and (recent program change) Mozart's
Piano Concerto No. 25 in C Major with pianist Rudolf Firkusny.;   Jan. 3-5,
1992: Music by Vaughan Williams, Debussy, Ravel and Sibelius, with harpist
Susan Mildonian performing two works.;   Feb. 13-16: Lutoslawski's concerto
and music by Mendelssohn and Brahms.;   March 12-15: Music by Harris and
Brahms, and Rachmaninoff's First Piano Concerto with Jean-Philippe Collard as
soloist.;   April 9-12: Music by Berlioz and Brahms, Ravel's Piano Concerto in
G Major, and (recent program change) De Falla's "Nights in the Gardens of
Spain," with pianist Alicia de Larrocha featured in the last two works.;
April 24-26: Music by Vaughan Williams, Richard Strauss and Brahms, with
violinist David Abel.;   April 30-May 3: Music by Beethoven and Brahms with
Garrick Ohlsson playing Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto.;   June 5-7:
Cleve's farewell concert, with Haydn's "Farewell" Symphony, and Mahler's
Symphony No. 2 ("Resurrection"); vocalists and chorus to be named later.;   In
all these concerts, the Sunday matinee is at Flint Center, the rest at the San
Jose Center for the Performing Arts.;   The Kickback Classics series, with
lighter, shorter fare and chats by the conductor, continues at Flint Feb.
29-March 1 ("fantasies"); March 19 (Cleve leading pieces from the city of his
birth, Vienna); and May 14 (mariachi and Latin music).;   The symphony's pops
concerts feature still lighter fare that crosses over into Broadway, pop and
film music. The series includes Marvin Hamlisch Feb. 7 and 8; Henry Mancini
March 6 and 7; and Cleve conducting a Gershwin program May 22-23.  (box)  </TEXT>

Brahms and 'Figaro' in the Desert
---
By Raymond Sokolov</HL>

<DATELINE> Santa Fe, N.M.  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the hills around here are not alive with the sound of music, it is no fault of the Santa Fe Opera or the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival.
The opera, founded 31 years ago by John Crosby, is putting on five full-scale productions in its outdoor theater.
The Chamber Music Festival, in its 15th year, covers the widest imaginable repertory and attracts the cream of the younger generation of musicians.
Although it does not have the high visibility of the opera, the Chamber Music Festival, because of the high caliber of its participants and the intelligence of its artistic director Alicia Schachter, is in fact the greater of two goods.

   Sunday's concert began with Beethoven's Trio in E-flat major for violin, cello and piano, which is listed as Opus 1, No. 1 (1793-94), but was by no means the composer's first work.
It was, however, as Ursula Oppens, the pianist that evening said, "the first piece he was proud of."
He probably would have been proud to hear the propulsive rendition of it she, Daniel Phillips (violin) and Carter Brey (cello) brought off in the Spanish-colonial-style St. Francis Auditorium.

   One imagines that Beethoven would have adjusted enthusiastically to the eclectic idiom of the Argentine master Alberto Ginastera's String Quartet No. 1, Opus 20 (1948).
Here was another breakthrough piece, one that launched him internationally.
It was followed, after an intermission in the brisk desert air of downtown Santa Fe, by the truly youthful Phantasy Quartet for oboe and strings, Opus 2, composed by Benjamin Britten in 1932 when he was 19.

   Here was another key early work.
Britten had, as Harris Goldsmith's program notes informed us, burned many earlier compositions.
This one put Allan Vogel, principal oboist with the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, leading the strings (Nicholas Mann, violin; Geraldine Walther, viola; Marcy Rosen, cello) in and out of the virtuoso and undissonant paths where Britten led them.

   Then, as if on cue, Brahms took the stage, a very mature Brahms, who wrote the Quintet in G major for two violins, two violas and cello, Opus 111, in 1890, at 57.
Brahms intended the work as a last bow, but its vitality, after so much juvenile high hope on the same program, was the best kind of recommendation for growing old.
James Buswell, in fine fiddle, led the ensemble with an almost demonic passion.
In the third movement, he and Mr. Phillips lobbed the theme back and forth to the two female violists, Kim Kashkashian and Ms. Walther.
Mr. Brey played his cello in the middle like a bemused chaperone.

   National Public Radio will broadcast the Chamber Music Festival later in the year.
By now, festival audiences in Santa Fe will have heard the Mendelssohn String Quartet's world-premiere performance of Tobias Picker's "New Memories," commissioned by the festival to commemorate the centennial of Georgia O'Keeffe, who lived and painted for so long at Abiquiu, just a few canyons out of town.
Tonight and three more times over the next two weeks they will also hear the crossover music of the Argentine Astor Piazzolla and his New Tango Quintet.
Mr. Piazzolla, his bandoneon (the Argentine accordion) and his group will be appearing at the Central Park Bandshell Labor Day weekend as part of SummerStage's World Music Series, hoping no doubt that their "classical" tango will find an audience already attuned to its folk sources by previous exposure to the traditional, wildly successful review "Tango Argentina."

   Meanwhile, for the rest of the month, the opera here will carry on with Strauss's "Die Schweigsame Frau," with a static revival of "Madama Butterfly," with a revival of Shostakovich's curiously unmusical staging of Gogol's surreal short story "The Nose" -- and with two productions worth the trouble of getting here via the construction site also known as Albuquerque airport.

   The big draw this season is Handel's "Ariodante," an Italian opera written for London's Covent Garden in 1735, based on Ariosto's 16th-century Italian epic "Orlando Furioso" and set in a mythical Scotland.
This cultural and historical mish-mash was tailor-made for the post-modern treatment, which it got, in John Conklin's exaggeratedly neoclassic/Renaissance/romantic set and Michael Stennett's court costumes of all ages between 1500 and 1750.
This is a long work that marches from set piece to set piece in the standard manner of Handelian "opera seria."
But impeccable singing by Tatiana Troyanos and Benita Valente, as the hero Ariodante and his betrothed Ginevra respectively, made it easy to stay awake.
This was a first-class production of an opera almost never seen uncut and fully staged.

   Of the opera's "Le Nozze di Figaro" it can be said: Everyone on the stage played his part to the hilt.
The performances sometimes almost cavorted over the edge into slapstick, particularly Edward Crafts as Count Almaviva, but overall it was a joy to see an opera that worked as theater.
And the broad playing went very far toward making da Ponte's Italian adaptation of Beaumarchais's French play for Viennese audiences in 1786 a comprehensible comedy for English speakers in New Spain.

   Considered purely as singers, the cast was, typically for Santa Fe, of uneven quality.
But the Israeli Zehava Gal was a fine Cherubino.
Kathryn Gamberoni made herself the center of the performance as Susanna, through sheer stage presence and despite a light, although lovely voice.
Her husband George Manahan conducted the usually humdrum Santa Fe orchestra with great vigor, transforming it into a crisp and accurate instrument.
One step more and he would have reached the sublime level of the score and challenged the gargantuan lightning bolts visible above and beyond the opera's incomparable site.

ON THE RECORD: A BLENDING OF STYLES IN CELEBRITY CHAMBER GROUPS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Celebrity chamber music, the superstars getting together to form a supernova,
proving that they can submerge their egos in the interests of intimate
ensemble, is more often a lark for the performers than a service to the
composer. But the exceptions can offer memorable rewards.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Grammophon in notes for its new recording of the complete Beethoven
string trios (427 687, 2 CDs) offers no information on the performance history
of the ensemble composed of violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, violist Bruno
Giuranna and cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. The results, however, indicate that
they did not meet in a studio, shake hands and sit down to sight-read some fun
stuff. These performances not only crackle with virtuoso intensity: they are of
a piece, and they are Beethoven.
</P>
<P>
Not a trace of flippancy here. Even in the hyper-extended Opus 3, rhythms are
precise, phrases fully formed. And in the three trios of Opus 9, Beethoven's
splendid warm-ups for the Opus 18 quartets, Mutter/Giuranna/Rostropovich,
whether assuming a single voice or as three individuals, give us the full quota
of fiery drive, conversational elegance, Olympian serenity -- whatever the
music calls for. The darkly rapturous slow movement of the Trio in D, Opus 9,
No. 2, says it all. A splendid achievement.
</P>
<P>
Celebrities of the recent past, violinist Henryk Szeryng, cellist Pierre
Fournier and pianist Wilhelm Kempff assembled in 1970 for the first and only
time to contribute the six big Beethoven piano trios to Deutsche Grammophon's
massive, limited-circulation Beethoven bicentennial release. The trio
recordings return now as a readily obtainable, mid-priced DG set (415 879, 3
CDs).
</P>
<P>
The results are curious, with Szeryng, normally the aggressive player,
deferring to the senior member, Kempff -- the dozing man's pianist -- in
matters of tempo (slow, when his is
</P>
<P>
the opening gambit, slowed-down when he is preceded by Szeryng) and dynamics
(narrowly soft).
</P>
<P>
Kempff dominates not through physical strength but strength of will, imposing
his underemphasis, his miniaturization, presumably in the interests of Good
Taste and Classicism, in which intensity and music-flexing were at one time
verboten.
</P>
<P>
Add to Szeryng's frustration and Kempff's browsing Fournier's earnest,
gray-toned cello and you wind up with, well, very little.
</P>
<P>
Another mid-priced reissue (EMI/Angel Studio 63124, 3 CDs) offers the piano
trios with opus number as well as some snippets without recorded in 1970 by the
young, powerhouse assemblage of violinist Pinchas Zukerman, cellist Jacqueline
du Pre and pianist Daniel Barenboim. Their playing here, whether or not always
in accord with the chamber music ideal of thinking with a single mind, was --
and is -- so imbued with vitality and affection, to say nothing of sheer
mechanical skill, that academic critical standards become irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
While the perfection of an interpretive concept may be the end-all of chamber
music, if what emerges after years of ensemble gestation is playing of solid
proficiency, one would much rather have the stars in less than perfect
alignment.
</P>
<P>
These thoughts are inspired by Germany's dozen-year old Abegg Trio -- violinist
Ulrich Beetz, cellist Birgit Erichson, pianist Gerrit Zitterbart -- offering
every last scrap Beethoven wrote for their combination of instruments on four
individual Intercord CDs (860.860 through 860.863).
</P>
<P>
But the humor of, say, the flashing finales of Opus 1, No. 2 or Opus 70, No. 2
elude these people; the heavenly arches of the 'Archduke' are flattened out in
their rhythmically square reading, etc.
</P>
<P>
Much is made in Intercord's program notes about the performers' adherence to
the fast tempos indicated by Beethoven's original markings (as recalled by
Czerny).
</P>
<P>
OK, but Abegg speed plus Abegg stolidity do not add up to liveliness. It might
be noted in this connection that the more or less ad hoc
Perlman-Harrell-Ashkenazy trio, in EMI/Angel's 1987 set, play nearly everything
faster, and far more imaginatively, than the Abegg without citing (or, perhaps,
even being aware of) historical precedent.

NORRINGTON'S BEETHOVEN FEST EXPLORES THE MISSA SOLEMNIS;
</P>
<P>
FESTIVAL: THE CONDUCTOR LED THE SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY IN A DIDACTIC YET
EXULTANT CELEBRATION OF THE DIFFICULT MASTERWORK.

<TEXT>
<P>
The intersection of art and education is a notoriously accident-prone
crossroads. The almost inevitable crash between the extremes of popularizing
platitudes and intuitive mysteries is seldom pretty to witness.
</P>
<P>
Given the inherent perils, the Beethoven Discovery Weekend that closed the 12th
annual Beethoven Festival in San Francisco this year proved a surprisingly
enlivening and enlightening event. Little pedantry, much wit and even some
inspired music-making were invested in an exploration of the grandeur and
subtlety of the Missa Solemnis, a.k.a. the Mass in D.
</P>
<P>
The festival leader was Roger Norrington. In the last few years, the
56-year-old English conductor has graduated from the relative obscurity of Kent
Opera to unlikely eminence atop the period-practice school, with a major in
Beethoven and a minor in proselytizing.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Norrington and his London Classical Players presented a "Haydn
Experience," followed by weekends devoted to Beethoven and Berlioz. Last
summer, they took the Beethoven show -- centered on the Ninth Symphony -- to
Summerfare in New York.
</P>
<P>
Norrington's weekend-long "experiences" are baptisms by total immersion into
the historical and artistic context of a major work, extending the typical
pre-concert lecture to a point just short of an undergraduate course in music
appreciation.
</P>
<P>
The pillars of the San Francisco weekend were under the direct guidance of
Norrington -- a concert of Missa Solemnis antecedents Friday, an open rehearsal
of the Mass Saturday, and the culminating performance Sunday. In between were
three miniconcerts and four lectures, all in Davies Symphony Hall.
</P>
<P>
The sessions got off to a soft start, didactically at least. The excerpts by
composers ranging from Palestrina to Cherubini were left largely to acquire
significance by association, as Norrington's remarks Friday were seldom
specific or memorably stated.
</P>
<P>
But the performances included some gems, with the heroes the obviously
well-drilled and enthusiastic San Francisco Symphony Chorus. The singers
launched the evening with bright-toned and finely spun lyricism in the Kyrie
from Beethoven's own, earlier Mass in C.
</P>
<P>
The orchestra had overtures by Beethoven and Mozart to itself, revealing
generally crisp, balanced and energized playing, though the finale to the
"Pastoral" Symphony sounded skittish. Norrington kept the singers and orchestra
firmly pointed forward, seldom giving the attention to releases that he gave to
entrances.
</P>
<P>
Norrington also showed a stubbornly 19th-Century interpretation of the Kyrie
from Palestrina's Missa "Assumpta est Maria," keeping it square and metrically
insensitive.
</P>
<P>
Baritone John Cheek contributed a rich "For behold, darkness shall cover the
earth" and soprano Amanda Halgrimson a radiant "Come unto Him," in German and
in Mozart's arrangements, which is how Beethoven knew "Messiah."
</P>
<P>
In the Saturday rehearsal, Norrington nurtured his audience with pertinent and
engaging remarks. He seemed much more relaxed, and gave easily understood
demonstrations of specific points in the score.
</P>
<P>
He also elicited strong cooperation from his musicians in the bits-and-pieces
approach. Mezzo Janice Taylor and tenor John Aler joined Halgrimson and Cheek
as a reasonably unified, but remote-sounding, solo quartet.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Halgrimson gave a limpid, textually connected account of
Beethoven's "Gellert" Lieder -- minus some verses -- though their relevance for
the Missa was never made clear.
</P>
<P>
Her sensitive accompanist was Helene Wickett. The pianist made a clear,
understated case for the poignant power of Beethoven's A-flat Sonata, Opus 110
-- which does connect with the Mass.
</P>
<P>
Susan Kagan of Hunter College introduced the social circumstances surrounding
the creation of the Missa Solemnis with a dry lecture on Beethoven and his
patron the Archduke Rudolph. Michael Steinberg, the versatile program annotator
for the San Francisco Symphony, provided a wise and funny guide to points of
musical interest in the work itself.
</P>
<P>
Sunday morning came the final contextual elements. Art historian Patrick
Werkner gave a fascinating look at the iconography of the myth of Beethoven.
The Aurora String Quartet -- all members of the orchestra -- probed the Opus
132 Quartet with utmost refinement and seriousness, and Steinberg provided an
emotional summation.
</P>
<P>
These preliminaries left a large, though far from capacity, audience primed for
the emotionally exhausting, sublime complexities of the Missa. Sunday
afternoon, Norrington satisfied the demand he helped create with a limber,
dramatic, exultant account of the notoriously difficult masterwork.
</P>
<P>
This was Norrington's first "experience" without the London Classical Players.
But however much he might prefer period instruments and practices in the
orchestra, on the podium he is another Leonard Bernstein, dancing and miming in
the grand manner little relevant to the way this music was originally
performed.
</P>
<P>
Fronting the San Francisco Symphony -- slightly reduced in strings -- and the
large chorus, his extroverted display did not seem as incongruous as it might
at the helm of a period-instrument band. In any case, at the end of a 19-day
festival with the San Franciscans, he had them playing with much of the taut
clarity associated with antiquarian orchestras.
</P>
<P>
Norrington's Missa Solemnis retains all of the majesty and mystery of a work
still more honored in textbooks than performances. (Both Norrington and the
Missa will be with us next season, though not together: the English conductor
will lead his orchestra and the Los Angeles Philharmonic in concerts at the
Music Center and the Orange County Performing Arts Center, while the Missa
Solemnis opens the Los Angeles Master Chorale season.)
</P>
<P>
The propulsive, always musically motivated pace for which Norrington's
Beethoven is noted was a constant, conspicuous factor. Less expected was the
devoted tenderness and lyric simplicity that he revealed in the Sanctus and
Benedictus, and the sheer revelry of the Dona nobis pacem, powerfully
contrasted with the harrowing intimations of war.
</P>
<P>
Norrington drew an impressive lot of focused, balanced sound from the eager
choristers. They delivered maximal clarity in the great fugues, where
Norrington tellingly stressed dance rhythms rather than polyphonic
pontification.
</P>
<P>
The orchestra gave good weight in the hushed sections, and rushed along lithely
when launched on the meteoric openings of the Gloria and Credo. Concertmaster
Raymond Kobler soared eloquently in the Benedictus, heading the list of assured
orchestral soloists.
</P>
<P>
The solo quartet sounded better in concert than in the pseudo-rehearsal. They
proved strong enough to emerge with operatic pathos in the war-torn parts of
the Agnus Dei, and sensitive enough to keep their essential but often
self-effacing parts well integrated into the overall texture.

   A 15-minute piece of music that the arranger said
was reconstructed from Beethoven's last work was warmly applauded
at its premiere Tuesday night but an occasional discordant note
came later from the audience.
   The work, presented at London's Royal Festival Hall, is
described as the first movement of what would have been Ludwig van
Beethoven's 10th symphony.
   Barry Cooper, a researcher at Aberdeen University, said he spent
five years piecing together symphonic fragments found in Berlin,
Bonn and Vienna after the German composer's death 161 years ago.
   ``The sketches struck me as being particularly good, even by
Beethoven's standards,'' Cooper told reporters Tuesday as the Royal
Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra rehearsed for the premiere.
   ``Even though my completion won't be as good as Beethoven, I
think the overall result has got enough really good Beethoven in it
to make it very well worth hearing.''
   Violinist Sir Yehudi Menuhin, who conducted the second half of
the concert but not the movement, said: ``I think it is a valuable
work. It is certainly Beethoven.''
   Some purists disagreed.
   ``Calling this Beethoven's 10h was a bad idea,'' said John
Dankworth, a classically trained jazz composer. ``It should be
named `Excerpts and Snippets.'''
   Martin Woolf, who described himself as a music lover, said, ``I
thought it was marvelous fun, though I doubt Beethoven would have
followed the Ninth with anything like that.''
   Cooper, who wrote a book on Beethoven's creative process while
working on the musical reconstruction, said Beethoven's plans to
finish the final symphony were mentioned in a letter written eight
days before his death in 1827.
   ``He actually offered it to the Royal Philharmonic Society'' of
Britain, Cooper said, ``And now they've got it, or as much as there
is of it.''
   Speaking as a white bust of Beethoven solemnly peered over the
rehearsing musicians, Cooper called his work ``a chance for other
people to get some idea of what Beethoven had in mind. Knowing what
the 10th symphony is like has increased our knowledge.''
   The music ranges from whispery quiet sections to bold, soaring
themes over its 15 minutes.
   Menuhin, after hearing the music for the first time at the
rehearsal, said it was ``a very beautiful work.''
   The 71-year-old musician called the controversy over the
premiere ``rather silly.''
   ``Everyone is eaten with curiosity,'' he said.
   Asked if the work was important, Menuhin said: ``They use the
word `important' for all kinds of sales of antiques and `important'
gold coins. I think it's at least as important as that.''
   Conductor Walter Weller called the piece ``very, very
interesting.''
   ``It sounds like a very young, powerful Beethoven,'' he said
after the practice session. ``Not the Beethoven you can hear in a
slow moment of the Ninth (Symphony), the Beethoven with one leg in
another world. This is a powerful one.''
   However, Weller said, he could tell which parts are the real
Beethoven, and where Cooper filled in the blanks.
   According to Cooper, two-thirds of the work was taken directly
from Beethoven's sketches, which sometimes were nothing more than a
single line of notes.
   ``There's something of Beethoven in every bar,'' he said. ``You
can't say Beethoven stops here and Cooper starts there. In
practically every bar, it's part Beethoven and part me.''
   Orchestra members were taking the Beethoven brouhaha in stride.
   First cellist Francis Bucknall said the movement ``is certainly
Beethoven. We haven't heard this piece of music before, so of
course it's important.''
   ``I don't think it's the best Beethoven we've ever heard,'' said
violist Andrea Creech, ``but obviously it is very exciting.''

FT  29 OCT 94 / Arts: Putting a fresh twist on Beethoven - A controversial
conductor who likes his players to take risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unusual musical partnership takes to the stage in London and Birmingham
over the next two weeks: Nikolaus Harnoncourt will conduct the Philharmonia
Orchestra in two cycles of the Beethoven symphonies. Harnoncourt is the pope
of historically-aware performing practice in continental Europe. The
Philharmonia represents the modern symphony orchestra par excellence.
Harnoncourt has been hailed as one of the most original and dynamic
interpreters of classical repertoire, celebrated for his ability to make
people hear familiar music with fresh ears. Well-known to record-buying
cognoscenti in the UK, he has been a rare visitor to London. The
Philharmonia concerts are his first encounter with a British orchestra - one
which helped shape a previous generation's knowledge of Beethoven through
its concerts and recordings with Otto Klemperer.
Just how easily the Philharmonia will absorb Harnoncourt's ideas is the
subject of much speculation in London's music establishment. Whatever
happens, the results are unlikely to be dull. Harnoncourt's Beethoven is
worlds away from the traditional approach. He favours shorter, more eventful
phrasing, rationed vibrato, sharply-defined timpani and horns that rasp like
their valveless antecedents.
He is equally far from the opposite pole of 'authentic' gurus. He has never
conducted Beethoven with a period-instrument ensemble, his dictum being that
the player is more important than the instrument. He drives Beethoven's
allegros with blinding intensity, but unlike Roger Norrington or John Eliot
Gardiner, he introduces subtle inflexions of tempo. The result is a marriage
between historical nicety and the need to project and re-invent the music
for today.
Harnoncourt, a Berlin-born Austrian, made his name as a specialist in
baroque and early music, but now spends most of his time with conventional
orchestras. Those who have worked with him speak of his instinctive feeling
for the music, backed by extensive study of contemporary sources. Francis
Hunter, who played oboe in Harnoncourt's Mozart cycle at the Zurich Opera
House, refers to 'his ability to slot into the gut level of each piece and
convey what is meaningful and expressive'.
Harnoncourt spent 17 years as a cellist in the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, so
he knows what it is like to sit listening to conductors. 'He has answers to
why he wants things done in a certain way,' says Dane Roberts, a double-bass
player in the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, with whom Harnoncourt has
recorded the Beethoven symphonies.
Harnoncourt, 64, is less forbidding in conversation than his platform manner
would suggest. He speaks good English and is accompanied everywhere by his
wife, Alice, an experienced violinist who acts as his agent.
His biggest triumphs in recent years have been at the Salzburg Festival:
cold-shouldered during the Karajan years, he has become a fixture of Gerard
Mortier's programme, and will conduct Le nozze di Figaro next summer. His
present repertoire ranges from Purcell's Fairy Queen to Bruckner's Third
Symphony. He acknowledges numerous blind spots, including Gluck, Berlioz,
Mahler and Strauss, but has late Verdi and Berg's Violin Concerto in his
sights.
Central to Harnoncourt's understanding of Beethoven is what he calls the
musical rhetoric - word-like units of phrase which grew out of the
connections between music and language in the baroque and early classical
era. 'Composers a generation after Beethoven would laugh at the idea,' he
says. 'Beethoven drew on the same musical vocabulary for 30 years of his
life - words, figures, formed from a handful of notes - and used them in a
rhetorical way. Is the musical speech a continuation of the previous phrase
or a response to it? It's important that the players know, because his music
tells you something - it's on the verge of programme music.'
Harnoncourt dismisses the idea of musical authenticity. He says that even
when orchestras play with period instruments, they are realising their idea
of sound from a 20th-century perspective. 'Musical interpretation changes
with every generation. Each laughs at its predecessor and believes it is
closer to the will of the composer. I do all the repeats in Beethoven's
symphonies, but 30 years ago it was not the done thing, and in another 30 it
will be different again. It is like changing fashion.'
One reason why the field of interpretation is so wide is that Beethoven did
not always make his final intentions clear. Harnoncourt says the autograph
scores are different to most composers of the period, 'because Beethoven did
not correct them - he gave them to a copyist and corrected the copy. The
parts were printed before the full score, so he corrected the parts. You
cannot even say the last source is the will of Beethoven, because he changed
a work like the Fourth Symphony for certain performances. You have to make a
lot of judgments yourself.'
At the same time, Harnoncourt is determined to root out modern accretions,
such as the trumpet's 'note of victory' in the first movement of the Eroica.
'Orchestras today play a note which was not written by Beethoven. You could
say the theme is not complete without it, that the trumpet players of
Beethoven's time were not good enough, so let's add it. I think Beethoven
included the failure, just as he asks the sopranos in the Missa Solemnis to
sing a note that's too high for them. He wanted their faces to be blue and
the voice to crack - this is part of the composition. A hero likes to show
only his heroic side, but what Beethoven does is to show that after all, the
hero is a failure.'
He dismisses the argument that if Beethoven had had access to today's
instruments, he would have adapted the parts accordingly. 'Then he would
have written everything differently. The limitations of the instruments were
a source of inspiration. We don't know what Beethoven would have done with
the instruments of today - geniuses always do things differently to what we
expect. I don't agree with the retouching that goes on. I don't change a
note.'
Harnoncourt also questions modern trends in orchestral sound, saying the
American-led drive for technical perfection puts the emphasis on security at
the expense of beauty. That is why he encourages brass players to experiment
with the old valveless instruments.
He describes beauty as 'something to do with unevenness - it's changing all
the time, there is a bit of dirt in it, it's not pure. If you have a group
of semi-quavers and you play them absolutely equal, it's sterile.
'For me, the most beautiful instrument lies at the edge of catastrophe. I
prefer risk - I like a musician who makes a mistake because he risks too
much.'
The Harnoncourt/Philharmonia Beethoven cycle begins at London's Royal
Festival Hall tonight and Birmingham's Symphony Hall next Thursday.

ON THE RECORD: NEW LIFE FOR OLD MASTERS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A welcome side effect of the escalating expense of producing new CD product is
the raiding of the pre-digital (even pre-stereo and pre-LP) archives --
unthinkable in 1983, when the digital compact disc was the new technological
Wunderkind on the block. Then, industry-wide wisdom dictated that the new
system would succeed only if represented by the sonic state of the art.
</P>
<P>
Such reasoning was responsible for new-tech remakes of much of the piano trio
repertory by its most famous purveyors, the Beaux Arts Trio, who by the '80s
were well past their prime.
</P>
<P>
Welcome, then, an intrepid little French firm, Ades (distributed by Harmonia
Mundi), to remind us how the Beaux Arts achieved its stature, the evidence
being 1962 recordings (originally for Philips) of Dvorak's "Dumky" and
Mendelssohn's D-minor Trios, in superbly clear, full-bodied pre-digital stereo
sound.
</P>
<P>
Here (on CD 13.273) is playing as fierily, fearlessly emotional as the works
themselves from the original Beaux Arts personnel: the group's perennial,
evergreen pianist, Menahem Pressler, violinist Daniel Guilet, cellist Bernard
Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
This was a powerhouse combination, less refined in tone and technique but far
more incisive than their later incarnations, when the elegantly aloof Isidore
Cohen became violinist and Greenhouse just seemed to lose interest.
</P>
<P>
One imagines the Beaux Arts Trio growing up with the legendary 1920s recordings
of Beethoven's "Archduke" and Schubert's B-flat Trios by pianist Alfred Cortot,
violinist Jacques Thibaud and cellist Pablo Casals: three superstars, each more
or less going his own way in matters of phrasing and articulation, but finding
common ground often enough to keep the music together.
</P>
<P>
But these gentlemen did more than make pretty sounds while maintaining a
semblance of structural integrity. Each was in his physical prime at the time
of these recordings and each clearly felt deeply about the music.
</P>
<P>
The string playing is luscious, Cortot's piano a marvel of subtle fluency, and
the interpretations, whether or not quite of a piece, are grandly
communicative. The reissue, quite decent-sounding in view of the age of the
originals, is in EMI/Angel's mid-priced "Great Recordings of the Century"
series (61024).
</P>
<P>
Violinist Daniel Phillips, pianist Richard Goode and hornist William Purvis,
though decidedly in our midst, are not living legends. They are simply three of
the kingpins of chamber music in America and they combine their gifts for a
superbly well-knit reading of Brahms' Horn Trio, Opus 40 (Bridge 9012) -- no
less mechanically secure and a good deal less sentimental than the celebrated
Perlman-Ashkenazy-Tuckwell edition.
</P>
<P>
The Brahms is imaginatively coupled with Gyorgy Ligeti's 1982 "Hommage a
Brahms" -- specifically an homage to Opus 40, which it resembles by way of a
common reference point in Beethoven's "Les Adieux" sonata and frequent
employment of natural horn harmonics.
</P>
<P>
But Ligeti's Trio would not be confused with a work of the Romantic era, least
of all in the final movement, music of the most profound pessimism, delivered
in an intensely dissonant, harshly emotive language.
</P>
<P>
The Ligeti performers, in addition to the seemingly superhuman Purvis, are
contemporary music masters Rolf Schulte, violin, and pianist Alan Feinberg.
</P>
<P>
Notable among a mass of new string quartet CDs -- even the big labels have come
to realize that it costs less to record the most expensive string quartet than
the least expensive symphony orchestra -- are outstanding releases by two
youthful American ensembles.
</P>
<P>
In a stimulating, offbeat release, the Muir Quartet impersonates the
"orchestra" in Mozart's own chamber arrangements of two great early Viennese
piano concertos, in A, K. 414, and in C, K. 415, as well as the earlier
Concerto in B-flat, K. 238 (EMI/Angel 49156).
</P>
<P>
The pianist, hitherto not identified with Mozart, is Jean-Philippe Collard, who
emerges a nimble, sensitive interpreter, in perfect accord with the Muir's
suavely punctilious but by no means precious ensemble execution.
</P>
<P>
Mozart again, this time from the even younger Colorado Quartet: the familiar
"Dissonance" Quartet and the less-known and perhaps most unique of the six
quartets dedicated to Haydn, the work in A, K. 464 (Fidelio 8813).
</P>
<P>
The Colorado's Mozart is sharp-edged and rhythmically crisp, their ensemble
buoyantly light-toned. Their overall excellence in this coupling is highlighted
by splendidly lithe projection of the infinite, elusive wonders of the slow
movement of K. 464.

JUILLIARD BEGINS BEETHOVEN CYCLE
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Juilliard String Quartet, which appeared at Ambassador Auditorium on
Thursday for the first of five season-spanning concerts devoted to the complete
quartets of Beethoven, has, in various personnel configurations, been putting
on this show for four decades.
</P>
<P>
So the critical pulse hardly races in anticipation of yet another Juilliard go
at the canonic 17. But it didn't take long before Beethoven and the best
Juilliard configuration ever -- founding first violinist Robert Mann and his
younger colleagues, second violinist Joel Smirnoff, violist Samuel Rhodes and
cellist Joel Krosnick -- made us willing captives.
</P>
<P>
To open, there was the quartet in F, Opus 18, No. 1. Its bluff joviality
embraces a slow movement as intensely emotional as anything Beethoven ever
created, although its formal clarity would give way to the less direct methods
employed in the later works.
</P>
<P>
The creative perspiration of self-consciously deep works of Beethoven's last
period -- such as the Quartet in A minor, Opus 132 -- was minimized by playing
of uncommon sweetness and lightness of tone.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the performers backtracked to the composer's middle period with the
grandly self-assured, vivacious "Razumovsky" Quartet in C, Opus 59, No. 3.
</P>
<P>
If they lost some of their concentration here -- the Minuet tended to wander --
the precipitous finale offered that combination of ardor, technical aplomb and
linear clarity that is the essence and particular joy of Juilliard. HERBERT

<TEXT>     On Wednesday night, two of the biggest favorites among quartet lovers will
compete head-to-head -- the Guarneri Quartet at Stanford's Dinkelspiel
Auditorium and the Tokyo Quartet at Berkeley's Zellerbach Hall. Buffs will
have to make a choice.;   Then there's duplicate opera, the most popular game
since duplicate bridge.;   The San Francisco Opera and the Los Angeles Music
Center Opera are both presenting "Don Giovanni" and "Carmen" this season, the
first of the works in concurrent runs.;   Later this season, though, Los
Angeles will get an exclusive item: the world premiere of Aulis Sallinen's
"Kullervo." This Finnish work, opening Feb. 25, will feature singers and a
production team from the Finnish National Opera, capped by baritone Jorma
Hynninen.;   VOCAL HEROES -- Closer to home, the Hidden Valley Music Seminars
in Carmel Valley will offer a double-barreled vocal master class Nov. 14 to
21, with stellar teachers (and international performing artists) Phyllis
Curtin and Hans Hotter on hand. For information, call (408) 659-3115.;
PROGRAM NOTES -- The San Jose Symphony's new concertmaster, Byung-Woo Kim, a
resident of South San Francisco, will step into the spotlight for the first
time as conductor and violin soloist in Vivaldi's "The Seasons" (a quartet of
violin concertos) at the orchestra's Save Our Symphony benefit concerts Nov. 8
to 10 at Flint Center in Cupertino. George Cleve will lead Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony, the other work on the program.;   Offering unexpected competition
will be a Beethoven Ninth the following weekend (Nov. 17) in San Francisco's
Davies Hall, with the San Francisco Choral Society.;   The San Jose Chamber
Music Society must make do for a year, maybe two, without its founder, Larry
Bryan. Bryan is teaching in the United Arab Emirates.;   On a more
instrumental note, Fremont composer Frank La Rocca got a $15,000 fellowship
from the National Endowment for the Arts to compose a new piece for the
Alexander String Quartet.;   The San Francisco Girls Chorus has received a
$72,500 challenge grant from the NEA, to be matched three-for-one from other
sources.;   YOU DESERVE BAROQUE TODAY -- The biggest Mozart concert of all
time? The Dec. 5 "Requiem" in Birmingham, Ala., could be it. The program
promises more than 1,000 voices, plus the Alabama Symphony playing in a
17,000-seat coliseum, which is more commonly rented for circuses, rodeos and
tractor pulls.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  AUDIENCES for serious music are noticeably smaller this season because of the
recession and the war, but they are also unpredictable -- as proved by the
overflow crowd for the Guarneri String Quartet Wednesday night.;    An annual
staple at Stanford's Dinkelspiel Auditorium, the Guarneri had its first
sellout in years here, and 50 extra seats had to be set up on stage to
accommodate extra patrons, who were almost close enough to turn pages.  </LEADPARA>

QUARTET OFFERS UNEVEN PROGRAM TO PACKED CROWD  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Classical Music Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     If you were turned away, not to worry: You can catch the group next week in
Berkeley or in June at San Francisco's Mozart &amp; His Time Festival.;    The big
draw may have been something intangible about these routine selections,
leading off with an early Mozart quartet, then, of all things, an early
Beethoven trio.;    Or maybe it was an outpouring of sympathy for first
violinist Arnold Steinhardt, who has an arm more worrisome to chamber-music
buffs than Joe Montana's.;    In any case, the Guarneri came across like an
old-line European ensemble, with serious mien, high formality and a sense of
detachment. Yet the unpredictability of the group is a focal point.;    The
players are highly individualistic. As "High Fidelity," a 1989 film
documentary on the quartet demonstrated, the four may have been inseparable on
stage for the past 26 seasons, but off stage they're volatile. Arguments
punctuate even the choice of works.;    The excitement Wednesday was packed
into the second half. The popular Dvorak "American" Quartet, Op. 96, is a work
of high lyricism, encompassing both exuberance and despair. The music rolled
in the swell of pseudo-American (actually more Bohemian) melodies, propelled
by the contrasting sound textures of the foursome.;    The accompaniment of
violist Michael Tree and cellist David Soyer fairly danced in the Scherzo,
while leader Steinhardt, despite his nagging left-elbow inflammation, carried
the themes with flair and freedom.;    The encore, the Scherzo from Ravel's
String Quartet, was no less brilliant: The arch rhythms were full of wit,
whimsy and wicked vagaries.;    The first half of the program was less
satisfying.;    Steinhardt got much-needed rest during the fastidious String
Trio, Op. 9, No. 1, in G Major by Beethoven. The piece is moderately
interesting structurally but decidedly pale when contrasted to any of the
Beethoven quartets. The sound textures ran amok, perhaps because the players
overemphasized the dialogue between the sole violin (John Dalley) and the
viola-cello pair.;    Mozart's F Major Quartet, K. 168, is often cited as the
piece where the composer discovered Haydnesque counterpoint. But the fugato of
the Andante inspired another pregnant thought: Had the 17-year-old Mozart also
just discovered Bach's "The Musical Offering?";    Stanford's thorough printed
programs were not up to par: They indicated the Beethoven had one too many

<HEAD>Orchestra To Play Fragment Of Beethoven's 10th Symphony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The only surviving movement of Beethoven's 10th
symphony, which he was writing while on his deathbed in 1827, will
be played in public for the first time at a concert in London on
Oct. 18.
   The Sunday Times said the movement has been ``painstakingly and
brilliantly reconstructed'' from fragments of Beethoven's original
manuscripts by Dr. Barry Cooper, a lecturer in music at Aberdeen
University in Scotland.
   The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Walter
Weller, will perform the symphony's first movement at Royal
Festival Hall, a spokeswoman said.
   Beethoven had promised the 10th symphony to London audiences
eight days before his death and had assured a London friend that
sketches of the new work were ``already in my desk,'' the Sunday
Times said.
   But the paper said posthumous researchers failed to find any
retrievable music among Beethoven's possessions. Biographers
disregarded an account by his secretary, Karl Holz, who said the
composer sat at the piano and played him the opening of the 10th
symphony.
   Five years ago, The Sunday Times said, Cooper was doing research
in a West Berlin library and found a set of sketches that matched
Holz's reminiscences of the opening movement. Cooper's belief that
these were from the missing 10th symphony was reinforced by the
discovery of additional sketches in the Beethoven archive in Bonn,
the paper said.
   ``By combining the two sets,'' Cooper was quoted as saying, ``I
began to find what Beethoven had in mind for the first movement. I
tried to keep very close to the sketches, to reconstruct the
movement as Beethoven envisaged it at that time.
   ``I had to fill in some harmonies and compose myself a few
linking sections but I did not invent any new themes. Those are all
Beethoven's,'' he was quoted as saying.
   The Sunday Times said none of Beethoven's scraps of notes
contained more than 20 bars, just a few seconds of music. But the
paper said that by laying the scraps end to end, Cooper assembled
an entire movement lasting almost 14 minutes.
   While Beethoven's Ninth Symphony ``shocked contemporary
listeners with its unprecedented choral finale,'' The Sunday Times
said that the first movement of the 10th symphony ``threatens to
dissolve the traditional barriers between movements, inventing a
more fluid structure for the symphony.''

   Music of Grainger, Koechlin, Piston, Walton and Diepenbrock
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   When a new recording technology such as the compact disc
matures, the listener benefits.
   Such major labels as Sony Classical may keep churning out
war-horse pieces by war-horse performers and rising stars making a
name.
   Even the usually admirable Telarc can perpetrate something as
shameful as a ``Best of Beethoven,'' as it did recently in a CD
consisting of movements from various Beethoven works in its catalog.
   But smaller companies, and lately some of the conglomerates, can
turn to other things: reissues of historical performances by
legendary artists on discs with improved sound, or CDs of music by
the lesser known composer, even the historical nonentity, which
broaden our knowledge and open us up to new delights.
   The latter category is examined here.
   Quick! Name a famous Dutch composer! Maybe Sweelinck comes to
mind, but since his lifetime (1562-1621), the Netherlands has not
had many composers of international renown _ until Alphons
Diepenbrock, who died at the age of 68 in 1921. A self-taught
follower of Wagner, he was influenced by late Beethoven and
Debussy. Diepenbrock had a literary bent and was a trained
classicist.
   It's not surprising, then, that a recent Chandos disc devoted to
him includes his overture to Aristophanes' play ``The Birds,'' the
Marsyas Concert Suite based on Greek mythology and the Elektra
Symphonic Suite. Included is the Hymn for Violin and Orchestra.
   Diepenbrock's appealing music is dramatic and extroverted. He
uses leitmotifs (short, recurring musical themes) and shows a
strong grasp of orchestral colors. The Residentie Orchestra of the
Hague, conducted by Hans Vonk, performs convincingly. Emmy Verhey
is the able soloist.
   Also in the dramatic vein is the same company's first volume of
Sir William Walton's film music on a disc full of sirs. Sir Neville
Marriner conducts the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields, with Sir
John Gielgud narrating Sir Laurence Olivier's ``Hamlet.'' Also on
the disc is the music to ``As You Like It.''
   Like practically all film music, one hears traces of Stravinsky
and Wagner, and like all really good film music, one wants to see
the movie while listening to it.
   The project is worthy and makes good music accessible. The
various sections are well woven together by Christopher Palmer.
   Gielgud, as to be expected, reads portions of the text as a
knight of the theater. Unfortunately, his aged voice sounds
completely inappropriate for Hamlet. But that's fine if the words
are listened to for their music.
   Another composer of film music was the neglected French composer
Charles Koechlin (1867-1950), who turned to the form late in a life
that produced more than 200 works.
   The West German label Audite has released a disc of Koechlin's
oboe works, played by Lajos Lencses.
   The pieces are introspective, yet not intimate, composed in a
delicate and sometimes meandering style. Lencses is a graceful,
full-bodied oboist with a tendency to sound monochromatic.
   Koch International Classics has released a disc of Percy
Grainger orchestral pieces played by the Melbourne Symphony
Orchestra, conducted by Geoffrey Simon.
   The Melbourne-born Grainger (1882-1961) was friends with Delius
and Grieg, trained in Germany and lived most of his life in the
United States.
   His chief characteristic, amply displayed on this disc, lies in
a propensity to use folk tunes, which can sound irritating in big
orchestral treatments. It's a particular taste. The recorded sound
is slightly murky and the orchestra a little bland.
   Walter Piston uses another kind of indigenous music _ jazz _ in
his works, though more artfully so. One of the great American
composers, Piston (1894-1976) is a master of orchestral color,
whose symphonic music bubbles with syncopated energy.
   Gerard Schwarz, conducting the New York Chamber Symphony and
Seattle Symphony, brings an intensity and compactness of sound to
the second and sixth symphonies and Sinfonietta on an excellent
Delos recording.

<LEADPARA>  AROUND San Jose, Napoleon is getting a lot more credit than he deserves as the
person who inspired Beethoven's "Emperor" Concerto (No. 5).;   "Some say
Napoleon had a hand in Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5," trumpets the
misleading ad for the San Jose Symphony's concerts this weekend, identifying
the "Emperor" of the title as Bonaparte himself.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BEETHOVEN WAS NO FAN OF NAPOLEON
GIVING CREDIT WHERE IT'S NOT DUE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Classical Music  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     In fact, Beethoven never called the piece "Emperor." And by the time he
composed it (1809), Napoleon was probably the last emperor on earth who'd get
a dedication from Beethoven.;   The composer's admiration for the Frenchman
ended abruptly six years earlier, when the enraged composer ripped up the
title-page dedication of the "Eroica" Symphony after hearing that the little
general had taken on the imperial mantle.;   When Beethoven was writing the
concerto, his city of Vienna had just been conquered by Napoleon, about whom
the composer wrote, "Now he, too, will trample on all the rights of man."
Beethoven had just one word to sum up those days of occupation: "Misery.";
BACK FROM RETIREMENT -- Milton Salkind, 75, thought he was retiring in 1990
when he left the presidency of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. But
now he's back as acting president after the precipitous departure of Stephen
Brown.;   In addition, Salkind is artistic adviser of a newly merged
orchestra. The new San Francisco Chamber Symphony combines the Sinfonia San
Francisco (which abruptly fired conductor Sam Cristler in April) and the
Chamber Symphony of San Francisco (whose conductor moved to Uruguay).;   A
music director is being sought for the new amalgam. Meanwhile, the season will
open Jan. 27 with guest conductors at Herbst Theatre. These include Stanford's
Robert Black, who will lead the orchestra on April 20, 1992, and the San Jose
Symphony's Peter Susskind, who will conduct on May 18.;   FEW CHAMBERS PLAY ON
-- Also prominent in the shrinking ranks of San Francisco chamber orchestras
is Artea, led by Dusan (also known as symphony violinist Dusan Bobb).;   As
recently as two years ago, the city's roster featured five chamber orchestras,
including the San Francisco Chamber Orchestra and Parlante. San Mateo also had
the Bay Chamber Orchestra.;   On more of an uptick down the Peninsula is Eric
Kujawsky and his Redwood Symphony. In a concert at Flint Center on Oct. 11,
the group will become the second American orchestra (after the New York
Philharmonic) to perform Leonard Bernstein's last symphonic piece, "Concerto
for Orchestra.";   "Last year, while we were playing some Bernstein works at
Flint Center, Bernstein died," recalls Kujawsky. "It was eerie -- and sad. I
idolized him."  </TEXT>

CHAMBER MUSIC L.A. FESTIVAL TURNS TO EAST;
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: ARTISTIC DIRECTOR YUKIKO KAMEI TAKES A NEW APPROACH, INCLUDING FIVE
CONTEMPORARY JAPANESE COMPOSERS IN THE EVENT.

The percussionist sits behind a large setup of Japanese instruments. Next to
him is the yokobue (traditional Japanese flute) player. Accompanying them are a
piano and double bass. Meanwhile, the fifth performer, a calligrapher, is
painting large Japanese characters while producing an assortment of groans and
other vocalizations.
</P>
<P>
This mix of Oriental, Occidental, music and art -- Isao Mitsushita's "Kizuna"
-- will be a part of the opening program Sunday for the fifth annual Chamber
Music L.A. Festival at Japan America Theatre. A markedly different approach
from the four previous festivals, the series of five concerts over two weeks,
titled "East/West Encounters," presents music by familiar Western composers
such as Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven but also includes a local premiere at every
concert of a contemporary Japanese composer.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to just present the Japanese music," explained Yukiko Kamei,
artistic director of the festival. "I wanted to present the new works along
with Western classics. I feel the same about all contemporary works, not just
those that are Japanese. Presenting the unfamiliar along with the familiar
tends to make the familiar classical sounds fresher."
</P>
<P>
A former student of and assistant to the late Jasha Heifetz, Kamei, 41, began
studying violin as a child in Tokyo where she was born. Four years ago she
developed an interest in traditional Japanese music.
</P>
<P>
"I heard Japanese music on the radio when I was growing up, but I only studied
Western music," Kamei said. "I never felt very close to the sound of the
traditional music. As I grew older and performed contemporary music more and
more, I started to listen to Japanese music differently. Suddenly, I recognized
a closeness to the music and was surprised to feel that in myself. It felt very
natural to me. So I can't tell whether my interest is more a coming of age or
going back to my roots."
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Shunsuke Kurakata (also a participant in the festival as a
pianist), directs a concert series in San Francisco devoted to new music from
Japan, where all but one of the pieces for the Los Angeles festival were first
heard by Kamei. The other work, Tadao Sawai's "Homura," written in 1974 for
17-string koto and koto ensemble, will receive its West Coast premiere May 24
and was discovered at another festival for contemporary Japanese music in New
York.
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles gives premiere performances of Japanese works at Monday Evening
Concerts and at CalArts, but there is no concentrated effort here as there is
in New York and San Francisco," said Kamei.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I wasn't looking for premieres and was surprised to see that these
pieces had never been performed in Los Angeles. I was happy enough to have the
work of five renowned Japanese composers."
</P>
<P>
Other Japanese works to be performed include Toru Takemitsu's "Entre-temps"
(1986) for oboe and string quartet, Toshi Ichiyanagi's "Paganini Personal"
(1982) for marimba and piano and Maki Ishii's "A Gleam of Time" (1983) for solo
harp.
</P>
<P>
Matsushita, who plans to attend the festival, will present his music on
Sunday's program, "Kaze-no-rosho" (1988) for solo yokobue (a Japanese flute)
performed by local musician Michiko Akao and "Kizuna" (1985) for yokobue,
percussion, bass, piano and a calligrapher.
</P>
<P>
"Calligraphy is usually a very quiet activity," says San Francisco-based artist
Shioh Kato, who will serve as calligrapher in the Matsushita piece.
</P>
<P>
"But this time I'll be making vocal sounds, and movement will be involved."
</P>
<P>
Kato will paint three large Japanese characters which translate into English as
"flying across the universe" while the ensemble plays. He also participated in
the U.S. premiere of the work three years ago in San Francisco, where he has
lived for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Western works programmed along with the Matsushita premiere will be Haydn's
Quartet, Opus 76, No. 2, and Beethoven's Septet in E-flat. Other European
composers represented in the festival are Mozart, Schumann, Mendelssohn,
Shostakovich, Dohnanyi, Dvorak, Schubert, Saint-Saens and Brahms.

L.A. MASTER CHORALE OPENS CURRIE'S FINAL SEASON AT PAVILION
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beethoven's Missa Solemnis is one of those pieces that was born a monument,
more often saluted than performed. Its choral terrors are legend and its
interpretive complexities daunting. Sublimity was never easy.
</P>
<P>
Saturday evening at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Beethoven's Mass was the
inaugural vehicle for John Currie's final season with the Los Angeles Master
Chorale. Inevitably, it took the measure of the man and his chorus, to say
nothing of the Sinfonia orchestra and a quartet of soloists.
</P>
<P>
The frustratingly incomplete accomplishment could well be a paradigm for
Currie's tenure here. Always an uncommonly score-bound conductor, Currie often
let the work slip from limber glory into lumbering banality, usually at the
least likely moment.
</P>
<P>
The Gloria, for example, began well, though majestic rather than ecstatic. But
the concluding fugues moved from the ponderous to the scrambled, in a welter of
unrelated tempos and awkward transitions.
</P>
<P>
Something similar happened in the Credo, following an unnecessary intermission.
What had seemed slow but playfully controlled buoyancy launching "Et vitam
venturi" quickly became merely slow, unredeemed by the ensuing frenzy.
</P>
<P>
And so it went. In the main, Currie's tempos were conservative, though when he
opted for speed he pushed for the maximum possible. His dynamic scale was huge
and apt, though the orchestra did not prove as flexible there as the chorus,
skewing balances at the extremes.
</P>
<P>
The 124-voice chorus provided potent and accommodating resources. The great
ascending rockets that Beethoven sets off throughout the work could burst in a
raucous shout from the tenors and basses, but otherwise this was choral singing
of optimal impact, articulate in both text and music.
</P>
<P>
The soloists occasionally lingered longer on a note than Currie wanted, though
not justifying the in-your-face cues and pedestrian subdivisions he foisted on
them, binding them rather than accompanying them. Soprano Carolann Page offered
amplitude and nuance at the top, warmly and evenly seconded by mezzo Christine
Cairns. Tenor Agostino Castagnola sounded wan and strained in the ascents, but
baritone Anthony Michaels-Moore delivered a solid, expressive foundation.
</P>
<P>
Concertmaster and personnel manager Stuart Canin soared sweetly and fluently in
the Praeludium and Benedictus solo. The orchestra he assembled gave good weight
despite intermittent patches of misintonation from the winds and struggles in
the strings with Currie's abrupt gear changes. JOHN HENKEN

<TEXT>
   Raisa Gorbachev on Monday toured the
narrow hallways and cramped rooms of Ludwig van Beethoven's
18th-century birthplace and said the composer occupies a special
place in Russian hearts.
   Beethoven ``is one of the world's greatest musical geniuses,''
Mrs. Gorbachev said as she visited the modest structure on the
fringes of Bonn's historic old town.
   The wife of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev toured the
house, now a museum, in a ceremony formalizing an exchange program
of young musicians from the Soviet Union and West Germany.
   She was accompanied by Hannelore Kohl, the wife of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.
   Outside the museum, about 20 demonstrators huddled on a nearby
sidewalk carrying placards protesting alleged Soviet atrocities in
Afghanistan.
   The protest was overshadowed by hundreds of well-wishers who
shouted ``Raisa! Raisa!'' and waved as she arrived by limousine.
   After a brief ceremony that included a performance of several of
Beethoven's works, the two first ladies toured the tiny green house
now surrounded by tall modern buildings and busy shops.
   ``It's amazing that such great men can be born in such small
rooms,'' Mrs. Gorbachev said.
   ``Beethoven is in all of our hearts,'' Mrs. Gorbachev said,
referring to the Soviet people's appreciation of the German master.
   During the tour, Mrs. Gorbachev displayed intense interest in the
house's history and appearance. At one point she stumbled in the
courtyard, but Mrs. Kohl quickly grabbed her arm to keep her from
falling.
   Mrs. Kohl told her Beethoven was born in a part of the house
behind an inner courtyard that was heavily damaged by bombs during
World War II. She said restoration efforts were continuing there.
   The museum in the front part of the building is open to the
public and displays period furniture, a piano used by Beethoven, and
other artifacts.
   Beethoven was born in Bonn in 1770, and lived there until age 13.
He died in 1827.

<LEADPARA>  BUCKING all the recession trends is the Bay Area's incredible Philharmonia
Baroque Orchestra. One of the handful of period-instruments orchestras outside
Europe, it is going for baroque in 1991-92, expanding from six to seven
concert sets and growing from 30 to 39 subscription concerts, on the strength
of rousing turnouts this year.;    In addition to concerts in San Francisco,
Berkeley, San Rafael and at Palo Alto's First United Methodist Church, it will
also perform all its sets at Walnut Creek's Regional Center for the Arts,
which opened last fall.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The group, however, will not make a national tour.;    The season opens
Sept. 19, with Handel's oratorio "Theodora" in its West Coast premiere. The
work will be recorded with the same cast, capped by Drew Minter, Lorraine
Hunt, and Jeff Thomas. Recordings also will include a package of Handel arias
by soprano Hunt, entitled "Arias for Durastante.";    The season will end with
the Philharmonia going (relatively) modern with Beethoven's "Eroica" Symphony.
The season will be conducted from beginning to end by the bright-eyed Nicholas
McGegan, who clearly has the method to the baroque madness.;    MAKING TRACKS:
On an equally fast track is the music director of the Bay Area Women's
Philharmonic, JoAnn Falletta. She has been named music director of the
Virginia Symphony in Norfolk, starting July 1, beating out, among others,
Richard Buckley, formerly head of the late, lamented Oakland Symphony, and
Leif Bjaland, formerly one of the conductors at the San Francisco Symphony.;
 Falletta will give up the Denver Chamber Orchestra but will head three
ensembles at once, including the Long Beach Symphony.;    In 1991-92 the
Women's Philharmonic will present four world premieres, by Libby Larsen, Lucia
Hwong, Joelle Wallach and Sarah Dawson. Larsen's dance piece "Ghosts of an Old
Ceremony" will be presented at the University of California, Berkeley's
Zellerbach Hall, with dancers from ODC/San Francisco. Featured women composers
from the past include Lili Boulanger, Germaine Tailleferre, Amelie Julie
Candeille and Fanny Mendelssohn.;    A RARE BEETHOVEN FIND -- The Beethoven
Center at San Jose State University has just acquired the earliest printing of
Beethoven's first three piano sonatas, Op. 2. Only three copies are known to
be extant. Of special interest are the numerous errors in the printing, which
have been corrected by various hands.;    Center director William Meredith is
ecstatic about the 1796 score, which was bought through a European dealer from
unknown owners. "It's the only first-edition copy in the country of
Beethoven's first piano sonatas. Until this came out, Beethoven was famous
only as a fortepianist, not as a composer.";    Other reasons to celebrate:
four encores and a standing ovation at the center's April 16 lieder recital by
German tenor Peter Schreier, and two $5,000 gifts for the center's endowment
from Ben Passen and founder Ira F. Brilliant.;    COMPOSERS, COMPOSERS --
Santa Clara composer Henry Mollicone had two world premieres within nine days.
In addition to his "Adventures of Alice" at San Jose Dance Theater on April
12, he had "Five Songs" premiered soon after in St. Louis, with conductor
Leonard Slatkin, no less, as the piano accompanist.;    San Francisco composer
Kirke Mechem, best known for his "Tartuffe" hit at Opera San Jose several
years ago, is back from the Soviet Union, having made history there: He became
the first living American composer ever featured in a symphonic evening
devoted entirely to his works. Corrick Brown of Santa Rosa conducted the USSR
Radio-TV Large-Concert Orchestra in a program built around Mechem's Symphonies
Nos. 1 and 2. The toughest part was not the music, says Mechem, a 1951
Stanford graduate, but the interview he did there in connection with the
concert: He did it partly in hastily assembled Russian.;    ANNIVERSARIES --
The wildly over-celebrated bicentennial of Mozart's death, coming up Dec. 5,
1991, is eclipsing several major anniversaries of composers, including the
centennials of Sergei Prokofiev (April 23), Arthur Honegger (March 10, 1992)
and Darius Milhaud (Sept. 4, 1992), and the 80th birthday of the very active
Italian-American composer Gian Carlo Menotti, on July 7 of this year. The
unfortunate result: Those four are being overlooked in concert tributes, while
Mozart thrives.;    Prokofiev, perhaps, had the biggest misfortune. Even his
death date is overlooked, because he died the same day as his countryman,
tyrant Josef Stalin, in 1953.  </TEXT>

JUILLIARD STRING QUARTET

<TEXT>

The prospect of dredging up adjectives with which to praise the Juilliard
String Quartet at the top of its form has become wearying, although "probing,
lush-toned, technically masterful" could easily be recycled to describe their
playing of the Beethoven Quartet in B flat, Opus 130, on Sunday afternoon at
Caltech's Beckman Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
What went awry in their encounter with the Second Quartet of Leos Janacek is a
good deal easier to describe.
</P>
<P>
While Janacek's knotty textures were clarified to a quite remarkable degree by
these brilliant and brainy artists, there were too many slips to make this
disjunct, ferocious, moonstruck but by no means incoherent thriller achieve its
full impact on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
First violinist Robert Mann encountered intonational difficulties in the
opening movement; in the finale, second violinist Joel Smirnoff scrambled his
strummings on their first appearance whereas they were swamped by Joel
Krosnick's cello -- which elsewhere proved uncharacteristically faint-toned --
the second time around. Leaving only Samuel Rhodes' succulent viola playing
unscathed amid the Juilliard's losing battle with Janacek.
</P>
<P>
Then, too, the excitement of the first movement -- and thereby of the work as a
whole -- peaked too early. This is, after all, music in which climaxes are as
common as crescendos in other composers' creations.
</P>
<P>
The program opened with a jaunty, not-quite-elegant traversal of Haydn's
Quartet in G, Opus 77, No. 1, and the Coleman Concerts audience was sent home
happy with Beethoven's aforementioned Opus 130, with its brief, jolly second
ending rather than the massive, nerve-rattling "Grosse Fuge." HERBERT GLASS

FT  02 JUN 92 / Arts: Musicians who miss the Wigmore - Music in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN and PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only four months to go. During the Wigmore Hall's year-long closure various
of the other musical venues in London have been putting on recitals, but
none has been able to offer the combination of intimate acoustics and
friendly atmosphere which makes that hall so precious.
From time to time the Barbican endeavours to promote itself again as a
recital hall and the past year has been a clear opportunity. The sound is
perhaps less poor for chamber-music than one might have feared, as the
acoustic gains in clarity as the number of players gets smaller. But nothing
can stop the hall looking and sounding empty when there is only a handful of
people on stage.
For the celebrity recital by the Takacs Quartet Barbican last Wednesday no
attempt was made to disguise the chilliness of the setting. The players sat
centre-stage, surrounded by a vast expanse of deserted platform. The upper
tiers of the auditorium looked to have been closed off. At quiet moments the
sound became unhelpfully distant and it was fortunate that so fine a group
was playing, as the audience was compelled to sit in silence.
This is a quartet with the ability to make its presence felt in any hall.
The players' tone is well matched, their style unexaggerated. Warmth and
lyricism are their hallmarks, although just occasionally there was a
seasoning of their native Hungarian paprika in Bartok's First Quartet and
also the scherzo of Haydn's B Flat Quartet, Op. 76 No. 4, where the vigorous
stamping rhythm was taken up rather noisily by the leader's left foot.
In their performance of Schubert's 'Death and the Maiden' Quartet neurosis
was held at bay. Where the Lindsay Quartet seizes the music by the throat,
or the Amadeus was wiry and tensile, the Takacs still find time to shape
broad lyrical phrases (the elegiac opening of the slow movement was coloured
with particular sensitivity). The players will be hosting their own festival
at the Wigmore Hall in 1994, so they clearly recognise where their true
London home lies.
A word of recommendation, too, for the Beethoven Trio, who gave the first of
three recitals at the Purcell Room on Friday. Each of these programmes
features a new work by an Austrian composer together with Mozart and
Beethoven trios, for which the players are winning an increasing reputation
at home and abroad.
To judge from the standard of performance in this first recital there is no
reason to question those high opinions. The Beethoven Trio is a meeting of
three equal musicians, less dominated by the pianist than is often the case
in more starry ensembles, a trio of young and fresh interpreters, able to
build long paragraphs of music into statements of some depth and import.
The new work on this occasion was Gerhard Schedl's Second Piano Trio,
subtitled 'Lamento', which takes the music of the two Armed Men from
Mozart's Die Zauberflote and sets isolated phrases from it afloat in a sea
of vaguely expressionist sounds: not a piece of strong individual merit,
although at 10 minutes it did not outstay its welcome. The third and final
recital, with a new work by Thomas Pernes, follows on Friday.
                           *       *      *
In a Purcell Room agreeably tarted up with paintings from the Arts Council
collection, including Gillian Eyres's eye-catching 'Spica' and a yellow and
blob-red Caulfield, the English tenor Adrian Thompson and pianist Iain
Burnside gave a recital on Thursday, fifth in a song series which would
normally be staged, one presumes, in the Wigmore Hall.
Certainly the Wigmore acoustics would have been more accommodating to Mr
Thompson's searingly powerful instrument. He makes a clarion sound which is
apt to go frantic with decibels in upper register climaxes and produce a
cuttingly painful effect in the confinement of the Purcell Room, which oddly
seems to stop the voice dead without muting it.
Passionate and in many ways persuasive, Mr Thompson's recital problem was
sheer vocal bulk. From the start he was overwhelming his pianist as well as
flattening his listeners in a Schubert group, though the passionate,
storm-lashed Der Schiffer (The Boatman) positively benefited from the
ferocious despatch. Among a selection of Hugo Wolf's Morike settings, Der
Tambour, a drummer boy's fantasy of food, and Storchenbotschaft
(Stork-tidings), with its bitonal piano part figuring the shepherd's creaky
hut (and anticipating the methods of Britten), made a vivid impression. An
eine Aolsharfe (To an Aeolian Harp) received a strong, solemn delivery.
I found the five Gerald Finzi songs after the interval dullish, and the four
Samuel Barber's not much less so: Sure on this Shining Night sets words by
James Agee but isn't a patch on Knoxville. Mr Thompson came on in chef's
togs for Leonard Bernstein's Faure send-up, La bonne cuisine, the four
song-texts being French recipes.
The 33-year old Russian conductor Yakov Kreizberg (he emigrated to the USA
in 1976) made his London debut on Sunday night with the Philharmonia
Orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall in an all-Russian programme. It was not
an exceptionally interesting programme, but Kreizberg made it uncommonly
gripping and the orchestra's playing was of the highest stylishness
throughout.
The Polonaise from Tchaikovsky's opera Eugene Onegin was a brief but
cracking opener and its brilliant bluster was no sooner in our ears than
forcibly contradicted by the bleak depression of Shostakovich's second cello
concerto, Op. 126, a late work written for Rostropovich in 1966 between the
thirteenth and fourteenth symphonies.
Our soloist was the American Lynn Harrell (in the news because of his
appointment as next principal of the Royal Academy of Music), and no more
searching or finely shaped interpretation could have been asked for.
Harrell's tone is as clear as it is expressive, as minutely governed as it
is boldly (and with seeming effortlessness) projected. Shostakovich's
invention is not perhaps of the most distinguished in this work, which is
just a very good performance 'on the Shostakovich'; but Harrell read in a
marvellous intensity everywhere and the orchestra answered Kreizberg's
evident commitment with a high-tension accompaniment notable for individual
excellences (the sturdy peculiar horn calls at the end of the first
movement, the split-second demented xylophone interjections of the scherzo)
as well as formidable group cohesiveness.
Kreizberg cuts an impressive figure on the podium: unflamboyant but intense,
dapper but keenly effectual. His account of Rakhmaninov's second symphony
was beautiful, profoundly persuasive (the work can easily become a romantic
thrash) and, in its slow movement, quite overwhelming. The string textures
of the slow introduction were built up with glistening precision, and brass
layers superadded with a disciplined ear for balance. The performance of the
scherzo was masterly; one blessed Kreizberg for the tiny touches of violin
portamento. Michael Whight's quiet, poised clarinet solo in the spacious
Adagio took our breath away, if not his; and the movement went its noble way
'among the deepening shades'.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Arts: British fanfare for Beethoven - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Under orders to help promote new music, the London orchestras have each come
up with their own solution. The Philharmonia has introduced a series
entitled 'Music of Today' timed at 6pm before the evening's concert - a
clever idea, as it can draw on a captive audience, while leaving the
orchestra free to programme the standard classics in its main concerts.
So far the new music seems to have been concentrated on weekends. On
Saturday a reasonable number of Beethoven-lovers, gathering for the start of
the symphony cycle that night, was attracted to the earlier event: three
short pieces by British composers all in their mid-30s. An opening fanfare
was provided by James MacMillan. Then came Mark-Anthony Turnage's jazzy
romp, Release, and Steve Martland's Shoulder to shoulder, a more disciplined
exercise in post-Stravinskyan rhythmic battery. Each was a useful thumb-nail
sketch of its creator, though not more.
None of them will have stolen the thunder from Nikolaus Harnoncourt's
Beethoven cycle, which started its two-week journey that evening. For the
Philharmonia, which went down in history as the orchestra that marked the
Beethoven bicentenary with a symphony cycle under the revered Otto
Klemperer, this was quite a jump.
On the face of it Harnoncourt is the antithesis of everything Klemperer
stood for: a former standard-bearer of the 'authentic' brigade, tireless in
overturning accepted ideas, controversial, dynamic. His Beethoven with the
Chamber Orchestra of Europe, both live here in London and on record, has
made a name for itself with its drive and clarity. Teamed with the full-size
Philharmonia, Harnoncourt is able to replicate the drive, but the clarity
does not come so easily.
The First Symphony opened with two unexpectedly thick-sounding, heavy
movements. Then the scherzo and finale exploded with energy. 'Authentic'
Beethoven conductors - especially Norrington - have found a Haydn-like
humour in this early symphony, but as far as Harnoncourt is concerned,
Beethoven bursts forth fully-formed, a tempestuous symphonic composer
heading for battle.
The 'Eroica' is more Harnoncourt's piece. He relishes its determination to
fight until the issues are resolved. Some of the climaxes reached a high
pitch of intensity. Although there were rough patches of playing, one can
imagine Harnoncourt in rehearsal, knowing exactly what he wants and going
over every passage until he has stamped his authority on each note. His
Beethoven is entirely his own, which should make the rest of this cycle one
to recommend. In that respect he is as worthy a successor to Klemperer as
the Philharmonia could have found.
Beethoven symphony cycle at the Royal Festival Hall in London and Symphony
Hall in Birmingham until November 13.

Other arts organizations may grouse about the difficulty of raising money in
this county's highly competitive market, but not the Orange County Philharmonic
Society. At the society's meeting in Newport Beach Monday night, executive
director Erich Vollmer reported that contributions were up 64% from 1988 to
1989.
</P>
<P>
By far the bulk of the rise from $406,067 in 1988 to $667,257 in 1989 came from
contributions from individuals, corporations and private foundations.
Government support rose a modest $641 from the $52,657 figure in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Vollmer credited the increase to "hard work."
</P>
<P>
"We really had a challenge, and the board met it," Vollmer said Tuesday. "I
think it's also an indication that we were wise in creating the position of
director of development. It was long overdue." Eve R. Henderson was appointed
development director in October.
</P>
<P>
"This is a case where no one person deserves the lion's share of the credit,"
Vollmer added. "It was truly a group effort. It was nonprofit at its best."
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the society ended the year with a small deficit of $16,588 in a
$2.3-million budget. "That's piddling, after what we dealt with last year,"

<HEAD>15 Minutes Of Beethoven Gets Mixed Reception</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 15-minute piece of music apparently
reconstructed from fragments Beethoven wrote for a Tenth Symphony
that he never finished received mixed reviews today from critics.
   The piece was the result of five years' work by Barry Cooper, a
researcher at Aberdeen University in Scotland. Played by Britain's
Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, and conducted by Walter
Weller, it had its public premiere Tuesday night at a concert at
London's Royal Festival Hall.
   Edward Greenfield, writing in the London newspaper The Guardian,
wrote: ``Though even Dr. Cooper would never assert that it was what
Beethoven would finally have delivered ... I marvel that the long
Andante sections which framed this unexpectedly structured movement
are so genuinely Beethovenian.''
   Paul Griffiths of The Times of London wrote: ``Proper judgment
of how Dr. Barry Cooper has interpreted Beethoven's presumed
sketches for a presumed Tenth Symphony will have to await
publication of the score: his statement that `about two-thirds of
it is based directly on Beethoven's sketches' begs an awful lot of
questions, especially when we are concerned with a composer of such
notoriously untidy working habits.''
   Anthony Payne wrote in another London paper, The Independent:
``The audience was only mildly enthusiastic. In truth, the music
sounded half-formed.''
   Payne added: ``There has always been speculation about sketches
for a Tenth Symphony. Until the mid-1980s, however, no scholar had
been prepared to identify much material from the 8,000 or so pages
of sketches which Beethoven left at his death (in 1827) as possibly
relating to the mythical Tenth.''
   Violinist Sir Yehudi Menuhin, who conducted the second half of
the concert after the piece was played, said: ``I think it is a
valuable work. It is certainly Beethoven. I have huge admiration
and respect for Dr. Cooper, who has done an extremely good job.''
   Cooper told reporters the years researching the musical mystery
uncovered sketches that ``struck me as being particularly good,
even by Beethoven's standards.''
   He said Beethoven's plans to finish the symphony were mentioned
in a letter written eight days before his death. ``He actually
offered it to the Royal Philharmonic Society'' of Britain, Cooper
said, ``And now they've got it, or as much as there is of it.''
   Cooper added, ``I think the overall result has got enough really
good Beethoven in it to make it very well worth hearing.''

PIANIST O'CONOR SELECTS FULLERTON FOR SOUTHLAND DEBUT;

IRISH STAR IMPRESSIVE WITH RENDITIONS OF BEETHOVEN SONATAS

<TEXT>
<P>
Fullerton High School on a Sunday afternoon might seem an unlikely place for a
winner of two major international piano competitions to make his Southern
California debut. Nevertheless, there he was, Irish pianist John O'Conor,
winner of both the International Beethoven Competition and the Bosendorfer
Piano Competition, ready to perform at the appointed time and place for the
North Orange County Community Concert Assn.
</P>
<P>
His program was a strong one, consisting of two sonatas by Beethoven -- the
"Waldstein" Sonata, Opus 53 and the Sonata Opus 31, No.1 -- the Four Piano
Pieces, Opus 119 by Brahms and Book One of Debussy's "Images." Though hampered
by the gymnasium-like acoustics of Plummer Auditorium and an edgy-toned piano,
O'Conor managed intelligent and communicative readings.
</P>
<P>
The two Beethoven sonatas framed the program. O'Conor began with the relatively
neglected Opus 31, No. 1 in a crisp, straightforward account that quietly
revealed the work's gentle humor and untroubled discourse. His attention was
directed toward subtleties of dynamic and rhythmic clarity.
</P>
<P>
His "Waldstein" Sonata was a different matter. He attacked the first movement
with considerable aggression at a very brisk pace. Driving energy was the main
concern. But he didn't leave detail behind, and moments of repose, such as his
warm, roundly shaped playing of the second theme, gave his reading dimension.
Variety of color and articulation marked his serene, spacious account of the
Finale.
</P>
<P>
The Brahms pieces were intimately communicated with a clear, understated
lyricism. Each was a concise, carefully molded statement. O'Conor gave the
three pieces from Debussy's "Images" an elegant, multicolored, atmospheric
performance. In both the Brahms and the Debussy works, climaxes had breadth and
controlled emotion; O'Conor never stooped to impress through piano-slamming
sonority or glittering virtuosity. One's concentration was always firmly drawn
to the music.
</P>
<P>
He spoke briefly before each work in much the same intelligent and personable
manner in which he played them. His sole encore was a beautiful, simple
nocturne by fellow Dubliner John Field.

<TEXT>     The well-traveled artist, who was born in East Germany, has hardly been
affected personally by his Communist-led country's absorption into what was
West Germany. But the region's musical life has suffered substantially, he
says. Along with new political and artistic freedoms have come economic
deprivation.;    "Overnight, the artistic life became worse," he told the
Mercury News in an interview last week. "The public has no money for concert
tickets, and the halls that were formerly full have empty seats. Also there's
no money to hire first-class (concert) artists.;    "Because of the
uncertainty, the number of concerts has dropped. And I believe that some
smaller symphonies out in the provinces will become victims of the economic
crisis . . . though none have shut down yet.";    Asked to what extent
limitations, either overt or subtle, were imposed on musicians under the East
German regime, the Dresden-based lyric tenor said, "Very little, actually.
There were certain political considerations (to keep in mind) -- for instance,
not to perform often in West Berlin or in Israel. And whenever I came home
from abroad, I did not dare tell friends how marvelous it was over there.";
For decades the veteran singer was one of East Germany's most traveled
artists. He has made more than 200 recordings, ranging from Bach and Mozart to
Wagner and Weill.;    He said there were no restrictions in the East on
performing music by Hitler favorites such as Wagner or Richard Strauss. "Once,
in 1985, we were even able to perform the opera 'Palestrina' by the Nazi-era
composer Hans Pfitzner," he noted.;    When Schreier returned home from tours
in the West, he had to pay a percentage of his earnings to the East German
concert agency. "It was less than half (the total)," he said, looking for a
silver lining.;    Last week Schreier was busy doing his world-renowned
specialty, singing the part of the Evangelist in Bach's "St. Matthew's
Passion" with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. But this time he added a new
twist: He was also the conductor for the performance.;    He began his
conducting at midcareer, back in 1973 in East Berlin, and since then he has
added more and more symphony orchestras to his list of engagements. Oddly
enough, he conducts little opera.;    "Opera's problematic," he observed, "and
the musical expectations are seldom fulfilled. There are so many potential
difficulties, and you may have another performance eight days later, with no
rehearsal in between. By then, concentration is lost.";    Here in San Jose,
Schreier will sing song cycles by Schumann and Beethoven, plus six Beethoven
songs on texts by Goethe. Of special interest will be Schumann's "Poet's Love"
("Dichterliebe"), a piece so popular, noted Schreier, "that it's almost
whistled in the streets.";    He will also sing Beethoven's "To the Distant
Beloved," which some analysts believe was for the same woman who inspired his
anguished "Immortal Beloved" love letter -- most likely Antonia von Brentano,
according to recent research.;    The embers of the composer's complex affairs
of the heart will be stirred again in a pre-concert lecture, "Beethoven in
Love," given by Dr. William Meredith an hour before the concert.;    This
summer Schreier will give recitals in London and at the Salzburg Festival,
with piano virtuoso Andras Schiff as accompanist.;    How does he keep his
repertory fresh?;    "I always think of each evening of lieder as being a
whole new experience. In addition, I frequently change accompanists and let
myself be inspired by each new pianist-collaborator.";    His pianist tonight
is Armen Guzelimian from the University of Southern California.; Peter

FT  03 SEP 92 / Arts: Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra - Edinburgh
International Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Riccardo Chailly announced a Rossini encore to mark the composer's
bicentenary at the end of Monday's concert, somebody in the row behind me
exclaimed, 'But the Beethoven was just like Rossini already]'. Whether out
of jest or annoyance it was not clear, but there was some truth in his
remark.
The Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra's transformation is complete. The days
when it played with deeply-considered sobriety under Bernard Haitink seem a
long way off. With Chailly, the orchestra still gives serious performances,
but it is serious about different things - about clarity and beauty,
lightness of touch and Italian effervescence.
In the two concerts they gave in Edinburgh, nothing suited Chailly and his
players better than the 20th-century works, Webern's Passacaglia and Berio's
Requies. The Berio, an elegy upon the death of the composer's former wife,
moves like an angel in flight. Its quicksilver blendings of wind and strings
float along as though no bass sound can hold them down and finally they
disappear altogether in a flutter-tongued flute solo. The piece could not
have been played with more ravishing delicacy.
Whether the same virtues are as welcome in Haydn and Beethoven is
questionable. There was no jovial rough-and-tumble in Chailly's perfectly
manicured delivery of Haydn's 'Farewell' Symphony. For example, it is
difficult to give the surprise ending of the Minuet any punch, when every
twist of the music has been prepared so assiduously in advance.
In Chailly's hands, both Haydn with his earthy humour and the reputedly
uncouth Beethoven became cultured gentlemen. The latter's Fourth Symphony,
the main work in the first concert, was exquisite in every detail, but it
lacked guts and drive.
One wanted to go up on stage, grasp the drumsticks and give the timpani a
jolly good thwack. Only an Italian, though, could make the slow movement
sing so eloquently. And the finale was marvellously lucid, with a twinkle in
the eye.
For the Beethoven work in the second concert, the conductor had chosen his
partner well in Maria Joao Pires. Neither is the type of performer to make
Beethoven sound ponderous when he is not in the mood to be. Their combined
sensitivities resulted in a beguiling performance of the Fourth Piano
Concerto, and Pires, in particular, managed to commune with the soul of the
music without sounding in the least precious.
Then to Tchaikovsky, the festival's omnipresent composer of the year.
Panache, virtuosity and plain force, all had to be brought into play here,
as Chailly can when he wants to, and the Fifth Symphony went with plenty of
excitement, wanting only the remarkable passion that the St Petersburg
Philharmonic had brought to its native Tchaikovsky when visiting the week
before.
These reservations apart, Chailly is a good musician and the Amsterdam
orchestra sounds as impeccably groomed as ever. Their Rossini encore,
incidentally, was a delight.
When the Royal Concertgebouw arrives in London, I recommend that the Proms
audience applaud long and loud to hear it.

MUSIC AND DANCE / CHRIS PASLES: '10TH SYMPHONY' NEEDS A BEETHOVEN TO MAKE IT
WORK
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

At the Orange County Performing Arts Center tonight and Thursday night, Keith
Clark will lead the Pacific Symphony through Beethoven's "Tenth Symphony."
Surprised that such a work exists? You're not alone.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the work is not a full-fledged symphony. And no one says that it is
really by Beethoven.
</P>
<P>
It consists of just one movement -- lasting about 15 minutes -- as
reconstructed from the composer's widely scattered sketches, fragments and
jottings. It was put together last year by Barry Cooper, 39, a professor of
music at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Cooper, who reportedly spent 5 years surveying 8,000 pages of sketches,
maintains (in a statement distributed by the symphony) that "there is more than
enough thematic material for the first movement in Beethoven's sketches, so
that a realization of it does not include any significant new motives, just
developments, extrapolations and continuations."
</P>
<P>
Still, critics reacted with caution at the work's premiere by the Royal
Liverpool Philharmonic, directed by Walter Weller, on Oct. 18. (The U.S.
premiere was given by Jose Serebrier and the American Symphony on Oct. 23.
George Cleve and the San Jose Symphony offered the California premiere in
November. There is a recording by Wyn Morris and the London Symphony.)
</P>
<P>
One London critic called it "a short-lived wonder which will disappear into
justified oblivion." Critic and scholar Andrew Porter, in the Nov. 28 issue of
the New Yorker, agreed that the work is "unconvincing."
</P>
<P>
"It is an essay 'in the manner of Beethoven,' which again and again bumps over
the switches, lurches, noodles through development sections," Porter wrote.
"Some of it sounds more like Schumann imitation."
</P>
<P>
One might well wonder: If Beethoven felt he had something left to say in a
symphony, why -- after finishing his monumental Ninth in early 1824 -- did he
spend the rest of his life (2 1/2 years) writing only string quartets?
</P>
<P>
Still, as news spread of his final illness (he would die of jaundice and
ascites on March 26, 1827), the Philharmonic Society of London sent him a
get-well gift of 100 pounds. Touched deeply, he told the society that
"sketches" for a Tenth Symphony were "already in my desk."
</P>
<P>
After his death, though, his sketchbooks were ransacked by souvenir hunters and
widely scattered, not to be re-collected until late in the 19th Century, and
even then pages remained missing.
</P>
<P>
Scholars say fragments of many uncompleted works, including other symphonies,
can be found among the sketches that survive.
</P>
<P>
It just takes a Beethoven to put them together.
</P>
<P>
 Keith Clark will conduct Barry Cooper's reconstruction of Beethoven's "Tenth
Symphony" tonight and Thursday at 8 p.m. at the Orange County Performing Arts
Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Also on the program: Brahms' First
Piano Concerto, with soloist Horacio Gutierrez, and Joseph Schwanter's "New
Morning for the World," with text by Martin Luther King Jr., narrated by
baritone William Warfield. Tickets: $9 to $49. Information: (714) 556-2787.

BEETHOVEN SONATAS IN AN INDUSTRIAL PARK

<TEXT>
<P>
Far less fascinating than one might have wished, Eric Stumacher's return
engagement Sunday afternoon on the Chamber Music in Historic Sites series
offered Beethoven sonatas and recent new music for computer-engaged piano.
Despite the helpful presence of one of the living composers represented, it was
easy to leave the event unamused.
</P>
<P>
As he had at his last Historic Sites appearance three years ago, pianist
Stumacher offered a work by John Steinmetz; but this time he recycled the
then-new Steinmetz piece he had played in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Sunday, heard from within a new conference room shaped like the inside of a
football, neither piece intrigued the listener. Another unfamiliar contemporary
work, Jon Deak's 11-minute narrative, "Shiver Me Timbers," using a text by
Robert Louis Stevenson, also left the observer in the ho-hum mode.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the most gripping element at this event, in a reconstituted
industrial building in the southeast corner of Culver City, was the site
itself.
</P>
<P>
This 6,000-foot-square complex, different parts of which are 60, 50 and 40
years old, has been rehabilitated near-totally under the supervision of
architect Eric Owen Moss. Visiting different parts of the complex before the
recital and during its intermission became the best part of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
As played competently by Stumacher, Steinmetz's Four Preludes for piano and
computer are innocuous diatonic studies accompanied by plain sound effects.
</P>
<P>
His earlier, 21-minute "DATACOMP" seems to be a comedy routine with incidental
music, and not one the listener wishes to hear a second time.
</P>
<P>
Stumacher's first half also disappointed. His playing of Beethoven's Sonata in
E, Opus 90, and "Waldstein" Sonata, Opus 53, brought forward no fresh insights
into familiar music. Indeed, inconsistencies of rhythm, as well as quirks in
phrasing and dynamics, put both these acknowledged masterpieces well out of
focus. DANIEL CARIAGA

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN: PIANIST SEEMS
OVERQUALIFIED FOR POPS' 'RHAPSODY IN BLUE'
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH HERMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Pianist Robert Taub's sophisticated resume bristles with world premieres,
compositions by contemporary composers such as Mel Powell and Milton Babbitt.
The Mel Powell Concerto for Two Pianos, in which Taub performed last year with
the Los Angeles Philharmonic, was awarded the 1990 Pulitzer Prize in music, and
Taub has just made the first recording of Vincent Persichetti's Piano Concerto
with the Philadelphia Orchestra under Charles Dutoit.
</P>
<P>
And Wednesday night the 32-year-old New Yorker plays "Rhapsody in Blue" with
the San Diego Symphony Pops orchestra at Hospitality Point.
</P>
<P>
This unlikely progression from the sublime to the overworked prompts an obvious
question: "What's a nice guy like you doing in a place like that?"
</P>
<P>
"I like the 'Rhapsody in Blue'," Taub said, carefully crafting his explanation
as if he were answering a question on a grant application.
</P>
<P>
"I played the piece last summer with the London Symphony Orchestra. That piece
captures something I relate with as a New Yorker -- like a Woody Allen movie."
</P>
<P>
If the orchestra's Summer Pops all-Gershwin concert is a kind of obligatory
annual ritual, Taub believes he can transcend its casual familiarity.
</P>
<P>
"My approach to the 'Rhapsody in Blue' is not at all fluffy and light. I take
it seriously, and whatever the programming context may be, I think I can make
it come off."
</P>
<P>
Taub's strong identification with 20th-Century American music has changed his
approach to more traditional piano repertory.
</P>
<P>
"Playing new music sheds a refreshing perspective on all music. After all, what
we now regard as 'classical' was once new. For instance, when I play
Beethoven's 'Waldstein' Sonata, I try to infuse it with the same enthusiasm it
had on its listeners at its original opening. I have been very careful to make
sure that the music I choose to play reflects my deep convictions about music
generally, even though the bulk of my repertory is still Beethoven, Brahms and
Rachmaninoff."
</P>
<P>
Pianists that influenced Taub included Dinu Lipatti, Josef Hoffmann and Artur
Schnabel. Schnabel's refined aesthetic has molded his preference for the late
Beethoven works as opposed to those from the composer's earlier stormy period.
Nor is Taub devoted to the flashy, crowd-pleasing showpieces by Franz Liszt.
</P>
<P>
"I read a biography of Schnabel in my late teens, and the author stressed that
Schnabel was a great musician as well as a great pianist. That distinction
stuck with me. A great pianist has control over keyboard, knows how to play the
instrument and create a wide palette of colors from the piano. But a great
musician knows how to use these tools to really express something in a work of
art."
</P>
<P>
Taub's ability to verbalize his musical experiences will serve him well over
the next two years when he serves as Harvard University's artist-in-residence,
a post that includes giving solo recitals, performing with the
Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, and lecturing on performance techniques and piano
literature.
</P>
<P>
This week, however, he can put philosophy on the back burner and devote all of
his artistic horsepower to five straight nights of "Rhapsody in Blue."
</P>
<P>
Soprano power. Brenda Wimberly, who made an auspicious local debut two years
ago as the Mother in West Coast Lyric Opera's production of Menotti's "Amahl
and the Night Visitors," returns this week for two distinctly different
engagements. In this week's San Diego Symphony all-Gershwin concerts (Aug.
15-19), she will sing the soprano parts in a "Porgy and Bess" medley. On Monday
at 8 p.m., the soprano from Texas will sing a recital of art songs by Mozart,
Strauss and Faure in the sanctuary of La Jolla's St. James Episcopal Church.
Her recital is another offering in West Coast Lyric Opera's chamber music
concerts at the La Jolla church.
</P>
<P>
Siberian Superstar. Dmitri Hvorostovsky, arguably the hottest new singer in the
operatic firmament, will give his debut local recital in La Jolla's Sherwood
Auditorium a week earlier than originally scheduled. The golden-voiced baritone
will perform a program of Italian art songs and opera arias Oct. 28.
</P>
<P>
San Diego Opera executive director Ian Campbell signed the 28-year-old singer
from Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, when he won first prize in the BBC Cardiff Singer of
the World Competition last summer. Since that dramatic exposure to the West,
Hvorostovsky has been inundated with glowing reviews. The New Yorker's Andrew
Porter declared him to be "one of the best voices to be heard today," and his
first recording for Philips Classics was recently released with no small amount
of fanfare.
</P>
<P>
Light Opera in East County. "Luisa Fernanda," a Spanish-language operetta,
properly called a zarzuela, will open 8 p.m. Thursday at El Cajon's East County
Performing Arts Center. A popular art form in Spain, the zarzuela is named
after the royal palace of La Zarzuela outside Madrid where these entertainments
first took place.
</P>
<P>
"Luisa Fernanda" was written by Federico Moreno Torroba, one of the two great
zarzuela composers of the 20th Century. This East County production will be
conducted by his son, Federico Moreno Torroba Jr. The San Diego Lyric Assn. and
the Grossmont College opera workshop are producing "Luisa Fernanda," which runs
through Aug. 19.
</P>
<P>
Cast problems. Because violist Cynthia Phelps is recovering from a broken arm,
her assignments in the opening week of the La Jolla Chamber Music Society's
SummerFest will be covered by Toby Hoffmann and festival artistic director
Heiichiro Ohyama. Ohyama will take Phelps' place in Schumann's Piano Quintet on
the Aug. 17 opening night program, and Hoffmann will substitute in the
Beethoven G Major String Trio on the Aug. 18 private gala concert. Society
officials expressed confidence that Phelps will be sufficiently recovered to
resume her playing duties during the festival's second week.

A music manuscript by Ludwig van Beethoven and a letter from him to a woman
friend broke world auction records for the composer today, Sotheby's auction
house said.
</P>
<P>
Otto Haas, a London dealer, paid $892,000 for the 16-page first movement of the
Sonata for Violoncello and Piano in A Major, a celebrated piece of chamber
music.
</P>
<P>
Beethoven wrote it in brown crayon and black ink between 1807 and 1808, saying
it was composed "amid tears and sorrow."
</P>
<P>
Scholars have been unable to determine what he meant by the remark.
</P>
<P>
The previous highest auction price for a Beethoven music manuscript was
$168,000 paid in London in May, 1988, for his Ninth Symphony.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous buyer paid $159,800 for a letter of 1811 to Bettina Brentano, a
poet and writer, containing references to two of the greatest German literary
figures, Friedrich von Schiller and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Beethoven mentions Antonie von Brentano, the recipient's
sister-in-law, who is believed by some historians to have been the "immortal
beloved" to whom the composer referred in a letter found unsent after his death
in 1827.
</P>
<P>
In May, 1985, $67,600 was paid in London for a letter by the composer to
Antonie von Brentano, the previous highest price for a Beethoven letter.
</P>
<P>
The manuscript and letter belonged to Felix Salzer, who taught music theory at
the graduate school of the City University of New York. He died in 1986, and
his collection was sold by his collaborator and widow, Hedwig.

<LEADPARA>  MICHAEL Morgan makes his debut tonight as the first music director of the
Oakland East Bay Symphony -- an event that caps the remarkable, phoenix-like
comeback of an orchestra in this community.;    The 52-year-old Oakland
Symphony left a big void when it went bankrupt in 1986. Now its 74-member
successor celebrates Morgan's appointment with a concert, at the city's Calvin
Simmons Theater, featuring Beethoven's Violin Concerto (with Ian Swenson as
soloist), Ruszczynski's "Twelve Secrets" and Aaron Copland's "Appalachian
Spring."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  OAKLAND EAST BAY SYMPHONY OPENS WITH CLASSIC
COPLAND MUSIC  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The event is also a tacit memorial for Copland, who died last month at 90,
since "Appalachian Spring," one of the early symphonic trailblazers of pure
Americana, has become his best-known instrumental work. The lively, witty,
Brooklyn-born Copland would have loved this rebirth of an orchestra.;    "I
scared the wits out of the people, especially in America (with my
compositions)," Copland told me with a chuckle at the Cabrillo Music Festival
in August 1978, where he was conducting the same Appalachian opus. He said he
was regarded as a wild experimentalist in the 1920s and '30s.;    "To write
something that everybody loved right away seemed too easy," he went on. "One
only knew too well what everybody would applaud for.;    "You write the music
that you have to write.";    Following that dictum, he created "Rodeo," "El
Salon Mexico" (which he also did at Cabrillo), "Quiet City," the stylish
Symphony No. 3 (being performed by the San Francisco Symphony May 2-4) and one
of the most remarkably exuberant clarinet concertos of our century.;    Two
months after Cabrillo, he returned, leading Oakland Ballet performances of his
"Billy the Kid" for his Bay Area swan song.;    He took up conducting late (in
his 60s) and put down composing a mite early (at 73). He stopped when the
juices ran out and offered no apologies, even when reminded that Verdi and
some others were composing in their 80s. "Some lucky devils can do that. . . .
(But anyway) I did it for 50 years.";    There were other surprises about
Copland. He called himself "an ignoramus" in jazz, even though numerous
Copland works are definitely jazzy.;    His favorite composition appeared to
be the forbidding, dissonant, half-hour-long Piano Fantasy. Playing it, he
conceded, was a "monster task.";    Fielding a question he said he'd never
been asked before, he said he had no trunks full of half-done manuscripts or
other musical leftovers.;    "No, and I never burned anything," he said. "I am
a slow worker.";    He clearly loved conducting. "I recommend it," he said
with a grin. "(It's) great fun. You go like this" -- he made a broad sweep of
his arm -- "and you hear beautiful sounds!";    But he admitted he'd be in big
trouble as a symphonic music director. In his gentlemanly way, he knocked
audience conservatism ("a big drag"), the excesses of Bach, Brahms, Beethoven
("really exaggerated") and the music of rival New York composers.;    His only
regret? Never writing a five-act opera for the Met.;    Despite his modesty,
this composer was a colossal force on the American scene. A very private man,
he was one of our most articulate authors and, at heart, a jolly soul who
always had time for one more young composer, one more interview, one more
silly question.;    An object of hero-worship for decades, Copland sheepishly
admitted falling prey to the same ailment himself while in Paris as a student
in his 20s.;    "I said, 'My God, that's (Igor) Stravinsky!' I followed him
for two blocks, like a magnet, until I realized how ridiculous that was.";
After his student days, Copland went his own way, never to look back.; Oakland
East Bay Symphony; Michael Morgan, conductor; Where: Calvin Simmons Theater,
10th and Fallon streets, Oakland; When: 8 tonight; Tickets: $10-$30, (415)

   A London dealer on Thursday bought a Ludwig van
Beethoven manuscript of a celebrated chamber work for nearly
$900,000, breaking a record for the composer's music, Sotheby's
auction house said.
   In addition, an anonymous buyer paid $159,800 for an 1811 letter
by the composer to a woman friend, the highest sum ever for a
Beethoven letter.
   Otto Haas, a London dealer, paid $892,000 for the 16-page first

   Beethoven wrote it in brown crayon and black ink in 1807-08,

   The Salzer Collection of music manuscripts and letters fetched a
total of $1.85 million.
   It included Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's manuscript of his
``Rondo'' for piano in F major, which brought $161,700.
   A letter from a disconsolate Franz Schubert to the poet Franz
von Schober fetched a record price for a Schubert letter. It sold
for $121,000.
