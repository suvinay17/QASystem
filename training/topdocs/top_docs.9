   Art historians are split over a doctor's theory
that Michelangelo's ``Creation of Adam'' on the Sistine Chapel
ceiling contains a huge image of a brain, symbolizing God endowing
man with intelligence.
   Dr. Frank Lynn Meshberger contends the fresco has been
misunderstood since it was created in 1512. The painting was
covered with dirt until a recent restoration, ``so it might have
been difficult to visualize a brain,'' he said.
   The painting shows Adam and God reaching toward one another,
arms outstretched, fingers almost touching. God has his arm around
Eve, and angels lookon. God and the angels form the shape of the
brain, Meshberger said.
   Meshberger, a gynecologist at St. John's Medical Center in
Anderson, Ind., said in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association that Michelangelo intended to symbolize God giving man
intellect, rather than life, as commonly believed.
   Kathleen Weil-Garris Brandt, a fine arts professor at New York
University and a consultant for Renaissance art at the Vatican
Museum, disputed Meshberger's theory as a ``retrofit'' of his own
knowledge.
   ``All the elements in the image have profound traditional roots
in the visual culture of the Renaissance and Middle Ages,'' she
said. ``God is more than a flying brain.''
   Other art historians are reluctant to dismiss the theory, noting
that artists and scientists of the time studied sections of the
brain.
   Meshberger said he learned through his research that
Michelangelo had deep religious beliefs and dissected cadavers to
study the human form for his art.
   ``The idea of God being equated with the mind is quite
attractive,'' said Graham Smith, who specializes in 16th-century
art at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
   Lynn Orr, curator of European art at the Fine Arts Museums of
San Francisco, said, ``Anybody can look at artwork and say, `Oh,
that means such and such to me,' but that's one of the wonderful
things about art.''
   ``I guess the thing to do now is for a bunch of people to look
at the picture carefully to see if it really does look like a
brain,'' she said.
   Meshberger said the theory came to him after he dissected and
drew a brain in medical school in 1969. He said he saw a three-page
fold-out photograph of the painting in a magazine and ``had a
tremendous sense of deja vu.''
   ``I like to think of it as a brainstorm,'' he joked.
   Meshberger said he waited 20 years to publish an article on it
because he was establishing himself as a doctor and had little time
to research Michelangelo.
   Meshberger said that the painting also includes a representation
of the vertebral artery, which feeds blood to the brain, and that a
cleft-footed angel forms the two lobes of the pituitary gland.
   For centuries after the fresco was created, art lovers did not
have the benefit of clear photography, and artists who would have
had access to the painting generally were not skilled in the study
of anatomy, the doctor said.
   ``For someone to make this observation, you would have had to
travel to Rome to the Sistine Chapel, stand on the floor and look
up at a ceiling about 65 feet away,'' he said.

<HEAD>Restorers Will Not Remove Additions to Michelangelo Fresco</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Restorers cleaning Michelangelo's ``Last
Judgment'' have decided not to remove changes another artist made
to cover images deemed offensive in the Sistine Chapel fresco,
Vatican Museum officials said.
   In 1564, Pope Pius IV, after siding with some 16th-century
church officials shocked by nude figures in the 60-by-30-foot
painting on the wall above the chapel altar, ordered artist Daniele
da Volterra to cover up the most ``indecent'' nudes.
   Fabrizio Mancinelli, directing the cleaning of Michelangelo's
Sistine Chapel frescoes, told a news conference Tuesday that
instead of painting over Michelangelo's creation, da Volterra
substituted his own fresco after first removing Michelangelo's.
   ``Since the additions are in fresco _ removing the original
fresco _ there is no real choice to take away those portions,''
said Kathleen Weil-Garris Brandt, a New York University art
historian who is a consultant on the Sistine Chapel project.
   Mancinelli and Ms. Brandt said a conference of 54 international
specialists who met last week at the Vatican decided there would be
no attempt to remove the additions.
   Michelangelo painted the ``Last Judgment'' more than 20 years
after he finished the ceiling, which he worked on between 1508 and
1512. The painting, now hidden by scaffolding, depicts a forceful
Christ standing in judgment surrounded by apprehensive saints,
angels and mythological figures.
   Mancinelli said the work to clean the masterpiece, the last
phase of the Sistine Chapel restoration, will take about four
years, including the time needed for scientific evaluation of the
painting and the cleaning methods to ensure the work is not damaged
in the process.
   The chapel restoration has been been surrounded by controversy.
   Critics led by James Beck, a Columbia University art historian,
charged that the restorters were removing some of Michelangelo's
retouchings and altering the colors of the frescoes.
   Mancinelli said the team left Michelangelo's work intact,
removing only a dirty glue-varnish that had been added by restorers
in the 17th and 18th centuries.
   To protect the newly cleaned frescoes and still allow them to be
seen by thousands of visitors each day, the Vatican is regulating
the humidity and has installed anti-dust carpets.

   Michelangelo's ``Creation of Adam'' painted on
the ceiling of the Vatican's Sistine Chapel contains an image
misunderstood for 478 years - a huge brain that symbolizes God
bestowing intellect on man, a doctor says.
   The fresco, completed in 1512 for Pope Julius II, shows Adam and
God reaching toward one another, arms outstretched, fingers almost
touching. Many scholars have interpreted the painting to mean God
bestowed life on man.
   But Frank Lynn Meshberger, a doctor at St. John's Medical Center
in Anderson, Ind., says Adam's eyes are already open, suggesting
he's alive. He contends Michelangelo intended the painting to
portray God giving man the gift of intellect.
   ``Look at the image that surrounds God and the angels,''
Meshberger wrote in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association. ``This image is the shape of a brain.''
   One art historian was skeptical.
   ``Holy mackerel! I never heard tell of such a thing,'' said Olan
Rand, a professor of art at Northwestern University in Evanston.
   ``I always thought it was a cloak,'' Rand said Tuesday. ``I'd
better go look at it again.''
   Meshberger said his conclusion is obvious - particularly if you
studied a picture of the fresco following classes on dissecting a
human brain. He had just finished dissecting and drawing a brain in
a medical school class in 1969 when he happened across a three-page
fold-out photo of the painting in a magazine.
   Meshberger said he waited 20 years to publish an article on it
because he was busy establishing himself as a doctor and had little
time to do research on Michelangelo's background.
   ``As a medical student, I was quite busy and, at the time,
thought it was an interesting observation but didn't have time to
look into it,'' he said.
   Meshberger said that when he began researching the question
years later, he learned that Michelangelo had deep religious
beliefs and used to dissect cadavers to study the human form for
his art.
   Other art lovers might have reached the same conclusion before
this century except they didn't have the benefit of the clear
images seen in modern photography, Meshberger said. He also said
artists who would have had access to the painting generally weren't
skilled in anatomy.
   He plans to give a lecture on his theory at a two-day science
reporters conference in Boston this week and expects doctors
attending to debate his interpretation.

   Michelangelo was not, contrary to popular
belief, an angry loner who spent countless hours lying flat on his
back as he painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, a Washington
University art historian concludes.
   In fact, the Italian Renaissance master did his work standing on
innovative scaffolding, and he had help from as many as 13
assistants, says William E. Wallace, assistant professor of art
history.
   ``One of the larger myths about him is that he was incapable of
working with others,'' Wallace said Friday. ``But the fact is that
for very large projects it was necessary to work with assistants.''
   ``I think of him as something of an entrepreneur ... a fairly
efficient businessman,'' Wallace said. ``It's just another side of
an artist who's constantly surprising us.''
   Depicting the biblical story of creation on the chapel's ceiling
was not without discomfort, however. Michelangelo described his
painting position _ on his feet, head tilted back _ to a friend in
this way:
   ``My beard toward Heaven, I feel the back of my brain upon my
neck.''
   Wallace spent last year in Italy on a grant from the National
Endowment for the Humanities researching Michelangelo and studying
the ceiling, which is undergoing a major renovation. Workers are
using a special, mild solvent to remove layers of dirt, candle
smoke and even Greek wine, which was once used to brighten the
colors.
   ``It's truly stunning,'' said Wallace, who climbed the
scaffolding four times, as the restorers worked to bring out the
work's true colors, for leisurely close-up looks.
   ``I think the thing that's most important is the coloration,''
he said. ``Although it comes as a surprise to some people, it's
really probably exactly as Michelangelo intended it.''
   Wallace said Michelangelo used vibrant colors so they could be
seen from the floor, 65 feet below.
   Now that he's back home, Wallace is working on a book about
Michelangelo and the assistants he used on his major works.
   In Italy, he spent hours compiling scattered information on the
Sistine project, which took from 1508 to 1512, and came up with a
list of 13 assistants who helped Michelangelo.
   An architect friend helped design the overhead scaffolding and a
carpenter named Piero Basso built it, Wallace said. Michelangelo
also hired assistants to grind colors, mix paints, trim and clean
brushes, and take care of other mundane tasks, and he recruited
other artists and instructed them in the technique of fresco
painting.
   Some historians have believed Michelangelo had help in the
project, but workers cleaning the ceiling in the 1930s were the
first to notice the tell-tale details, Wallace said. He thinks his
book will be the first to provide an overall picture of
Michelangelo's assistants in the Sistine Chapel.
   ``Examination of the ceiling from the scaffold clearly reveals
the presence of helping hands, especially painting in the
architecture, decoration and many of the secondary figures,''
Wallace said.
   ``Much of the architecture, for example, was a reptititous task
that required competence but no imagination, and the presence of
more than one hand is particularly evident when viewed at close
range,'' he said.
   Wallace said the myths about Michelangelo painting alone will
probably continue, however, because ``they are fictions that
attempt to grasp a superhuman achievement.''
   But knowing he had a little help ``does not in any way detract
from the greatness of the work of art.''
   ``Rather, it is to the credit of his genius that the final
product is a unified work of art.''

A Pristine Sistine: Michelangelo Unveiled

   Claustrophobic winding corridors lead to a hike over a creaky gangplank attached several stories above ground to the outside wall of the Sistine Chapel, and then, finally, comes an undignified scramble up a two-stage ladder to a platform slightly larger than a boxing ring. 
That's the workshop of the conservators who are cleaning the filth of five centuries from the most famous painted ceiling in the world in a crossfire of controversy. 

   A few more steps yet and one can touch Michelangelo's vaulting fresco. 
Between 1508 and 1512, he decorated this monstrous 128-by-45-foot span with his singular vision of the Creation, of stars and planets, plants and animals, Adam and Eve. 
Along with the accumulated dirt, the Vatican conservators have spent the last seven years peeling away long-held notions about the painter's brooding palette. 
Dusty colors are giving way to mauves, yellows, pale blues and ice greens. 
But lately, every new square inch of newly bared brightness provokes a shriek of outrage from a small group of standpatters, mostly non-specialists, who want to keep their Michelangelo in the dark. 

   A few weeks ago, for instance, a handful of Los Angeles artists signed a petition asking the pope to stop this sacrilege. 
They were copycatting an earlier petition signed by 15 New York artists. 
So far, though, the pontiff has shown no interest in this color controversy, issuing no bull and not even bothering to clamber up to the platform. 

   So conservator Gianluigi Colalucci and his small team are free to clean away, and are just now reaching the midway point in their epic task, which should be complete when the Last Judgment on the altar is finished in 1992. 
The chapel will remain open to the public throughout. 

   Last week, the conservators threw their atelier-eyrie open to special deputations from around the globe, including curious American and Italian conservators sent over by the Kress Foundation. 

   Above our heads was the result of the last three months of work: A fresh-skinned Adam and Eve reaching for the fatal fruit and then heading unhappily out of Eden. 

   Michelangelo spent about a month painting the scene, brushing water-based paints directly onto fresh, wet plaster (the buon fresco technique). 
A sculptor at heart, he didn't enjoy himself much and left bilious poems and caricatures that complain about his paint-covered, painwracked time on the Sistine scaffold. 

   Contrary to popular perception, though, he did not work lying on his back, and neither do the conservators. 
Like Michelangelo, whom he otherwise does not resemble -- no temper, no sheepskin leg-wrappings -- Mr. Colalucci stands upright when he applies the cleansing agent. 
This gel does not sink into the frescoed plaster and forms no chemical bond with the pigments. 
For Adam and Eve, two careful, time-controlled applications, each followed by a rinse of distilled water, generally sufficed. 
Cracks are filled in with watercolor. 

   Among the assembled experts, there seemed general agreement that the formerly sallow parents-of-us-all now look wonderfully spruce, godly almost in their cleanliness. 
"Who would have guessed that underneath all that glue and grime was flesh painted with such an extraordinarily delicate yet sensuous hand," said David Bull, head of paintings conservation at Washington's National Gallery of Art, agog under Eve. 
The cleaning has brought out her two-toned nipples, lightened Adam's yellow mop of hair and returned to the serpent the golden-green glimmer of meaty coils. 

   But these tonalities are still fairly discreet compared with the pastel hues emanating from the once-gloomy lunettes that decorate the window level. 
Tidied up patriarchs and prophets fill these half-moon spaces, some in raspberry outfits not unlike the bulky sweater worn by Balthus, the painter of prurient pre-pubescents, who was hovering near the conservators' computer and had nothing to say except that he was not influenced by Michelangelo. 

   Pushing a few buttons on the terminal, Mr. Colalucci called up the expulsion from paradise on his screen with the help of a speedy video mouse. 
This mini-Michelangelo marked trouble spots in the ceiling as it went along. 
Dirt was far from the only problem. 
Water seepage has left a number of patches damaged by an efflorescence of salts; candles and oil lamps that once lit the gloomy chapel added a sooty smear. 
And, probably in the 18th century, janitorial squads slathered animal glue on the vault with long poles to brighten the darkening colors. 
The faint of heart will not want to read about the enterprising fellow who scrubbed away with a mixture of stale bread and retsina. 

   "Not surprisingly Michelangelo's ceiling entered our consciousness long ago as a dark, mysterious object," says Kathleen Weil-Garris Brandt, a professor at New York University's Institute of Fine Arts and a regular visitor to the platform. 
Like most scholars of Renaissance art, she's ready to see Michelangelo as a painter of his time, with a color sense gleaned from his teacher Domenico Ghirlandaio and then filtered on to such younger artists as Pontormo and Rosso Fiorentino, whose paintings blaze with unusual colors. 

   And why ever not? 
Even someone without a Ph.D. might wonder why Michelangelo would have darkened his colors so dramatically only five years after having painted the Doni Madonna's glacial blues. 
Perhaps his abilities as a painter are best attested to by that other titan, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. 
On the Italian journey that he described in a classic journal and illustrated with memorable sketches, Goethe ate a picnic lunch in the Sistina in 1786 and noted down some comments by artists he met: "In addition to the other qualities they admired, they said that he surpassed all others in his sense of color and it became the fashion to dispute whether he or Raphael was the greater genius." 

   That isn't how our artists see it. 
Along with a handful of Italian and American historians, they claim that the conservators are scrubbing away l'ultima mano -- the final veil-like layer supposedly applied by Michelangelo on the completed ceiling. 
But where is the proof for this layer? 
Certainly not in the biographies of Condivi or of Vasari, who reports that Michelangelo "complained that because of the pope's haste he could not finish it as he would." 
And anyhow, this never-spun veil would very likely have been a bit of aquamarine and the brightening gold that Julius II was always nagging him to use. 

   Beyond the hard evidence favoring color over crepuscule is common sense. 
Michelangelo's subject was the coming of light into this world, the creation of the visible heavens. 
The protesting artists seem to have forgotten that Genesis says: "Let there be light." 
But from the Sistine scaffold, one saw convincing proof that Michelangelo had not meant to blacken the eternal noon of Paradise. 

   "The people making this witless protest are almost criminal in my opinion," said John Brealey, chairman of the conservation department at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. 
"If this cleaning is suddenly abandoned it will be a catastrophe." 
Along with five other conservators, among them the National Gallery's Mr. Bull and the Getty's Andrea Rothe, he has signed a statement issued by the Kress Foundation indicating his full support of the project. 

   The experts hesitated with their endorsement only long enough to descend to earth safely, among the tourist groundlings with their Instamatics snapping the newfound incandescence above, more luminous than it has been since Michelangelo put down his brush.

   The loincloths painted on some nude figures
in Michelangelo's ``Last Judgment'' on orders of Pope Pius IV
should be left on the 16th-century masterpiece, Vatican restorer
Fabrizio Mancinelli said Friday.
   ``To remove them, we would have to make a hole in the wall, and
frankly I don't want to make a hole in the wall,'' said Mancinelli,
who is directing the cleaning of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel
frescoes.
   The ``Last Judgment'' is a 60-by-30-foot painting on the wall
above the chapel altar.
   Mancinelli spoke at a news conference presenting a Vatican
exhibit on Michelangelo and the 11-year-old project of wiping away
centuries of soot, grime and dust from the Renaissance work.
   The Sistine Chapel restoration has long been surrounded by
controversy. Critics, led by Columbia University art historian
James Beck, charged the restorers were removing some of
Michelangelo's retouchings and altering the colors of the frescoes.
   But Mancinelli said the Vatican team left Michelangelo's
original work intact, removing only glue-varnish added to the
painting by 17th and 18th century restorers.
   Restorers recently finished cleaning the 5,533-square-foot
vaulted chapel ceiling, revealing bright and dynamic colors. Early
next month, they will begin the four-year restoration of the ``Last
Judgment.''
   Some 16th-century church officials were shocked by the nude
figures in the ``Last Judgment,'' and in 1564, Pius IV ordered
those found most offensive to be covered up by artist Daniele da
Volterra.
   Some art experts argue the loincloths should now be removed, but
Mancinelli said the rules of Italian restoration call for all
essential elements of an artwork to be maintained, including da
Volterra's reworkings.
   He noted previously that the whole issue may be moot, since some
historians think the nude parts were removed when da Volterra made
his additions. If they are correct, taking away the loincloths
would reveal bare spots on the wall.
   The issue is expected to be debated by 50 international
scientists, restorers and art historians meeting at the Vatican
next week to discuss plans for the ``Last Judgment'' restoration.
   Carlo Pietrangeli, director of the Vatican Museums, said the
results of the ceiling restoration had eliminated the bitterness he
felt over the ``unjustified criticism'' of the project.
   There has been talk of limiting the number of tourists in the
chapel, which on peak days can attract up to 19,000 visitors. But
Pietrangeli said it would be ``practically impossible'' to turn
back tourists.
   Pope John Paul II is scheduled to inaugurate the Michelangelo
exhibit on Saturday in the Braccio di Carlo Magno in St. Peter's
Square. Entitled ``Michelangelo and the Sistine Chapel _ Technique,
Conservation and Myth,'' the exhibit will open to the public Sunday
and run through July 10.
   The exhibit includes a selection of Michelangelo's drawings
showing how he planned the Sistine Chapel decoration; a scale model
of the scaffolding he used; a video on the cleaning techniques; and
drawings by Raphael, Rubens, Caravaggio and others underlining
Michelangelo's impact on other artists.

<TEXT>     The Vatican team says that peeling the thick, grimy layers from the Last
Judgment on the altar wall may well produce an even more astonishing result.; 
  The experts say they have developed new techniques and learned from the
cleaning of the ceiling, an undertaking that over the past decade has caused
concern and sometimes angry debates.;    "We have analyzed every patch very
carefully," said Gianluigi Colalucci, who heads the Vatican restoration team.
"We will start with a large area of sky and perhaps two or three figures.";   
Cleaning the sky will bring one of the main surprises, Colalucci said. Today
this backdrop for the almost 400 figures of the giant fresco is a gloomy dark
blue and gray.;    But tests have shown that the sky, which covers almost
one-fourth of the painting, will be transformed into a vast expanse of
brilliant blue. Colalucci said analysis had confirmed that Michelangelo
painted the sky with the potent blue pigment of lapis lazuli.;    Art
historians are also eager to see whether the great Renaissance master changed
his methods and techniques as he grew more experienced.;    He made the mighty
figures of the Creation on the ceiling -- apparently with reluctance after
much pressure from Pope Julius II -- between 1508 and 1512. He began work on
the Last Judgment 23 years later, finishing it in 1541 after six years of
work.;    Michelangelo's vision of the Last Judgment, crowded with people
rising ecstatically toward heaven and falling horror-stricken toward hell, is
said to have deeply impressed his contemporaries and rather terrified Pope
Paul III, who commissioned it.;    The latest round of tests has also
apparently settled the question of the fresco's nearly 30 nudes. They were
ordered covered up after the Council of Trent ended in 1563.;    Michelangelo
refused to do the work. His message for the Pope was, "Let him make the world
a suitable place and the painting will fit in." But Daniele da Volterra, a
reputed admirer of the master, agreed to paint cloths over the genitals.;   
Tests have now shown that in several cases Volterra apparently did not simply
paint over the plaster but replaced the plaster or retouched it in fresco, so
the colors merged with the original surface. In either case, the restorers
cannot remove the additions.;    The Vatican has thus been spared a debate
over propriety.  </TEXT>

FT  05 APR 94 / Arts: Judgment day for the restorers - A 'new' Michelangelo
is unveiled this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since its completion during the papacy of Paul III in 1541,
Michelangelo's 'Last Judgment' fresco in the Sistine Chapel has been the
subject of criticism. The Pope's Master of Ceremonies, incensed by his cameo
role as Minos at the Mouth of Hell, begged the pontiff to destroy it;
unseemly baggy shorts were added to tone down the prevailing nudity while El
Greco modestly volunteered to paint something better in its stead. Even
among Michelangelo's supporters, the fresco, on the altar wall, has not
enjoyed the celebrity of Adam, on the Sistine ceiling, or Moses on the Tomb
of Julius II.
Now, however, as the Pope prepares to celebrate mass on Friday to mark the
unveiling of the newly restored 'Last Judgment', the attacks will be
directed at a different target. The work of art itself will barely get a
look in as every detail of the restoration will be pored over. Voices will
be raised in protest against the destruction of a great masterpiece, echoing
the clamour that surrounded the unveiling of the ceiling frescos four years
ago after a decade of restoration work.
Then, the prime objection centred on the claim that Michelangelo had
combined true fresco, which is painted on to wet plaster and forms a
chemical bond with it, and secco, which is painted after the plaster has
dried. Critics argued that the Vatican restoration team had cleaned off the
secco and that subtle layers of pigment had been eradicated. For the
critics, Friday's unveiling is the last chance for a high-profile lament on
the whole issue of restoration.
The Sistine Chapel, and above all the ceiling, is so familiar that people
commonly feel they have always known what it looked like. It is an old
friend. This is particularly true of art historians, many of whom had
recorded their descriptions of the frescos as sombre and sooty. Michelangelo
had always been presented as no colourist, as a sculptor press-ganged into
painting who preferred to work in monochrome. The Ancestors of Christ,
depicted in lunette frescos, had been plunged into darkness, it was argued,
because they lived before the light of revelation. Suddenly the restoration
revealed them bathed in light and dressed in startling acid colours.
The new Michelangelo was revealed to be far less the isolated genius than a
recognisable child of his time - the pupil of Domenico Ghirlandaio and the
inspiration of Pontormo and Rosso Fiorentino, the next generation of
Florentine painters. These colours were not unfamiliar: they were all around
Michelangelo, but for some reason he was not thought to have used them.
Maybe geniuses are not meant to conform to any norms of their age.
The truth so conveniently ignored by the non-interventionists is that almost
no painting or fresco has escaped tampering in the past. A vote for the
status quo is rarely going to preserve the unadulterated patina of
centuries. Rather it is often a preference for the unscientific messing
about of the past as opposed to the marginally more informed approach of the
late 20th century. Today's restorers not only tend to give a truer picture
of the original but also frequently wipe away the misdemeanours of their
predecessors, who were not above petty censorship or the concealment of
signatures.
Even the sternest purists have had to accept the necessity of conservation
as opposed to restoration: works of art frequently require life-saving
operations when they do not need facelifts. In the case of the Sistine
Chapel, something had to be done. The glues and resins, used by restorers
since the late 16th century to revitalise Michelangelo's ever darkening
colours, were deteriorating and in the process detaching colour from the
plaster. If nothing had been done, the master's work would simply have
crumbled away. The 1980s restoration cleared the frescos of centuries of
dust and smoke - from candles, oil lamps and the braziers formerly used for
heating - as well as earlier restorers' glues and the blackish overpaintings
added in desperate bids to accentuate lighter passages. The difference
before and after was astounding. It is hardly surprising that cleaning
should have divided opinion so radically.
The idea that the work of art one grew up with and learned to love was not
all that it seemed is invariably painful. But there is a real possibility
that the transformation wrought by restoration can be for the best. In other
media similar battles are all but won. The experience of a 'Messiah' played
on original instruments and performed on the scale which Handel intended
might be enough to set the old Huddersfield Choral Society turning in its
grave, but few now would deem it an arid exercise in musical archaeology.
The new 'Last Judgment' is bound to spring plenty of surprises, not least
Michelangelo's more painterly technique and use of almost Venetian rich
colour, but only the most deluded of observers can really believe that there
was no room for improvement in its previous appearance. The Vatican team has
proceeded with admirable caution, taking - at 14 years - four years longer
over the restoration of the frescos than the the master took to paint them.

Some clothes belatedly painted onto naked bodies in Michelangelo's "Last 
Judgment" in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel could come off during a restoration 
project, returning the work to what the artist originally intended. 
Michelangelo painted "The Last Judgment," conceived as a warning to the 
unfaithful, above the altar between 1535 and 1541, filling the huge fresco with 
writhing naked bodies. Veils were painted over the hips of about 30 figures on 
the orders of Pope Pius IV later in the 16th Century. These cannot be removed 
because the artist used the same fresco technique as Michelangelo. The garments 
scheduled to come off were painted onto the figures when the work was touched 
up in the 18th Century. Restoration to Michelangelo's frescoes in the chapel 
has been under way since 1980. It will take about four years to clean "The Last 
Judgment," the final phase of the project. Claudia Puig

FT  25 JUL 92 / Weekend Interview: The man who paints like Michelangelo -
Gianluigi Colalucci is tackling the art world's greatest challenge:
restoring the Sistine Chapel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOETHE claimed that only by seeing the Sistine Chapel with Michelangelo's
frescos could one have a complete understanding of what a single man can
achieve.
Few have a greater understanding of the achievements of this man than
Professor Gianluigi Colalucci. He has been in charge of the painstaking task
of restoring these frescos in the Vatican from the moment the first
experiments were carried out on an area the size of a postage stamp 12 years
ago.
The complexity and sheer scale of dealing with Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel
ceiling and the wall, with the gigantic composition of the 'Last Judgement',
has made it one of the most remarkable acts of modern restoration.
Ironically, the work of cleaning and restoration, together with pauses to
assess progress, has taken longer than the combined time Michelangelo took
to paint the frescos. The ceiling with the famous central depiction of the
creation was painted from 1508-12; while the turbulent 'Last Judgement' was
begun 22 years later and completed in 1541.
Restoration is in its final phase and the magnificently fresh colours - Prof
Colalucci's critics say too fresh - of the ceiling can be seen by all. On a
scaffold behind a white net at the far end of the chapel, the team is now
working on the surface of 'The Last Judgement'.
'I deliberately left this until the end as it the most complex part of the
whole restoration', says Colalucci. Pope Paul IV dismissed 'The Last
Judgement' as a 'stew of nudes' and outrage over the nudity of the figures
led breeches and loincloths to be painted over some of the figures. At one
stage the entire fresco was nearly white-washed.
Working so close to Michelangelo, does he feel the presence of the genius?
'Ah, yes' he sighs deeply.
He is familiar with every brush stroke. 'I've known him for so long . . .
even before I started this project, when I first came to work at the Vatican
(in 1960) I was given the task every year of dusting the Judgement. Even
then I was taking photographs, trying to understand his extraordinary
technique.'
In his office in the bowels of the Vatican museum he has a blow-up
photograph of the 'Judgement' as he calls it affectionately. Covered with
coloured stickers and numbers indicating the work schedule, it looks like
one of those German Christmas cards with windows to open for each day until
Christmas.
Colalucci puts in at least four hours a day on his 'Judgement'. Mindful of
the physical ravages wrought on Michelangelo producing this masterpiece, was
this not a gruelling project for a man of 62? 'Last year I began to feel a
few aches in the back for the first time. But I have been helped a lot
through keeping fit because I go to a gym.'
He chuckles quietly over the casual way he entered his chosen career. 'I
don't come from a family of artists.' His father was a famous sports
journalist. He himself was an indifferent student and entered the world of
art restoration through a chance meeting with a leading restorer. However,
he says he realised that being brought up in Rome surrounded by a vast
accumulation of ancient monuments imbued him with a natural sense of
culture. 'It is part of my character to enter into the past.'
He is a great believer that Culture cannot only be acquired through learning
and books. 'There is also an intuitive element which comes from deep inside
you. This makes you feel the work of art closer, and treat it in a familiar,
not a reverential, way.'
When he decided to enter the Rome Restoration Institute in 1949 he was one
of only five students - 'Now there are queues waiting to get in.'
His first job was a one-month stint in Sicily which turned into an
unexpected stay of seven years during which developed an expertise restoring
early paintings on wood. Parts of Sicily then were like a return to the 18th
century. He recalls driving round the island in a Fiat 500, coming across
priceless paintings which sacristans had sought to embellish with olive oil,
others retouched by enthusiastic amateurs.
When the Vatican was looking for new blood in 1960, he was recruited for his
skills with wood. He eventually moved on to fresco work by virtue of the
Vatican possessing 90 per cent of its painting in the form. This becomes
obvious as one walks with him through the endless painted corridors, halls
and rooms to the Sistine Chapel. (From the museum entrance to the Chapel it
is nearly a kilometre).
What is the secret of a good restorer?
'For me the important thing is not necessarily the iconography of a work of
art but to understand how it is painted, the choice of colours, the movement
of mass . . . it is like understanding the structure of a piece of music.'
It is the natural approach of a craftsman and he does not wish to be
distracted by academic debate over, say, the identity of a saint. He talks
often of restoring paintings to the original 'text for a proper reading'.
Modern restoration, he says, is in essence based on 'a great respect for the
original and minimum interference. Everything done to present the work,
providing the damage is not too visible, is carried out in such a way so
that you can see the original. In the past there was a lot of retouching and
too much reconstruction of what was missing and damaged.' He feels that
attitudes in Italy differ towards restoration because there is little money
and so much to restore, whereas many rich countries have little to restore.
Is one not intimidated by approaching something so immense and so well known
as the Sistine Chapel?
'My experience on wood, which is a much more delicate medium, has helped
enormously in my work on the Sistine chapel. The mentality of a restorer of
paintings on wood is very special - the work does not permit experiment, you
cannot take short cuts: you need to be very clear-headed . . . You cannot
make mistakes. Frescos, on the other hand, were often done by large numbers
of people and are executed generally on a grand scale on big spaces.
'However, restoring Michelangelo requires all the techniques used for
wood-based painting work because his painting is so refined, so delicate -
and so well known. You need the mentality of someone used to working on the
square centimetre.'
The restoration presented special problems because he says Michelangelo
changed techniques often. Technically it has been difficult both to remove
the glue varnish, which over time had left scales, and to return to the
original colours while all proper conservation procedures were observed.
Does one also need to jump the centuries and get inside the mentality of the
artist?
' As a man he left nothing, but one can see as an artist he was extremely
severe with himself and with others. And I understand him: if a person
possesses such talents he cannot get on with anyone else.'
For Colalucci, the most painful aspect of the restoration has been the
criticism directed against his work - because he is the first one to want to
get it right. Can he ever therefore relax and feel no that mistakes have
been made on a work which the world regards as one of its foremost art
treasures, and which thousands queue to see every day?
' I fear being overconfident. I found it positive that people challenged
what I was doing. The polemics could destroy me as a person and my work, but
they could also act as a stimulus to improve. I never undervalued any
criticism even when I thought it stupid, and this has enabled me to be
serene about all that's been said. I think I have been proved right.'
The criticism has so far referred to the ceiling. Though the arguments are
complex, one polemic was over the belief that Michelangelo had modified the
original fresco with extensive glazing and additions in secco after the
original work had dried. Others centred on the use of certain chemicals
which it was feared might affect future conservation. Yet another complained
that the restored colours simply looked too modern. One US critic even
called the restoration a 'disaster'.
Colalucci divides his critics into two categories. 'There are those who know
a work of art as if it belongs to them, something they have learned from
childhood, seen on a special trip or have studied - and they don't want it
to change.' Looking with him at pictures of the 'before' and 'after', it is
as though a fine grey veil has been peeled away from the ceiling. 'The main
critics have in fact been painters because they have studied Michelangelo in
a certain way, often from books - for them it is sacrosanct. I understand
this, even I can have problems with an excellent restoration by a colleague
in this way. But this is a sentimental reaction.'
On technical aspects, he claims 'the challenge has come from persons who
knew nothing about technique'. But he believes the polemic has subsided over
the past 18 months, especially as the lighting has been corrected. He adds:
'It is not as if this has been done in-house, we have had a team of 18
internationally recognised experts monitoring the project.'
But does he ever ask tourists what they think as he wanders around the
chapel? 'No. I just listen to the comments.'
These days many of the comments are in Japanese, as a sizeable proportion of
visitors are groups from Japan. Japanese television has also paid Dollars 4m
(about Pounds 2m) for the rights to film the whole process of restoration.
How does he imagine the Japanese confront western art and Michelangelo's
very personal interpretation of Christianity? 'I know well what it feels
like to look at another culture from the outside; but what the Japanese
think about this remains a mystery.'
Indeed crowds, and the conservation issues raised by mass tourism, are an
increasing problem for the Sistine Chapel. Often it is impossible to
contemplate the frescos in reasonable tranquillity. Should limits be placed
on the number of visitors? Should they be made to be content with replicas?
Colalucci wryly observes that the replica of Michelangelo's 'Pieta' in the
Vatican museum is usually treated with the same reverence and curiosity as
the original in St Peter's, which is more difficult to see as it is behind
glass. 'Works of art today are subject to stress but it's not just people in
museums but pollution in general. Why should you deny people the chance of
seeing these masterpieces? I think it would be impossible.'
Is this restoration like repainting the Forth Bridge - once finished, one
immediately begins again?
'No. This will last.'

<TEXT>
   Art restorers probably will strip the loincloths
from many figures in Michelangelo's ``The Last Judgment'' in the
Sistine Chapel, it was reported Thursday.
   ``Many of the veils that cover the nudity in `The Last Judgment'
by Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel will probably be removed,''
Fabrizio Mancinelli, director of Vatican restoration work, told the
Roman Catholic magazine 30 Days.
   Michelangelo painted the main altar wall containing ``The Last
Judgment'' in 1536-41. Pope Pius IV, scandalized by the nudes,
ordered artist Daniele da Volterra to paint loincloths on some of
the figures about two decades later.
   Mancinelli said da Volterra's paintings would be too difficult
to remove since they were frescoes, and only those loincloths added
in the late 17th century and 18th century would be erased, the
magazine said.
   The Sistine Chapel has been under restoration since 1980.

Art restorers said Tuesday that they could not remove veils and other coverings 
added to hide nudity in Michelangelo's Last Judgment frescoes in the Sistine 
Chapel because the originals had been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made after a weeklong international symposium of art 
historians studying the first phase of a multimillion-dollar restoration of one 
of the world's greatest art treasures. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-year cleaning of the ceiling frescoes was completed last month and 
scaffolding has been built for a four-year project to restore a massive, 
300-figure scene depicting The Last Judgment on the wall behind the main altar. 
</P>
<P>
The 1545-1563 Council of Trent ordered that some of the nudes on The Last 
Judgment be covered. Most of the work was done by Daniele Da Volterra after 
Michelangelo died in 1564. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference marking the start of work on the 1,800-square-foot panel 
depicting Earth, Heaven and Hell, officials said the originals of the doctored 
frescoes could not be restored. 
</P>
<P>
"The additions that were painted by Daniele da Volterra shortly after 
Michelangelo's death were painted in fresco and that means that Michelangelo's 
original frescoes were taken out," said Kathleen Weil-Garris Brandt, the 
Vatican's consultant on Renaissance art. 
</P>
<P>
In the fresco technique, artists paint on wet plaster which becomes part of a 
wall or ceiling when dry. If Da Volterra, known as the "breechmaker" because of 
his censorship, had used a dry technique to cover the offending frescoes, 
restorers could have uncovered the original. 
</P>
<P>
In his most famous modification of The Last Judgment, Da Volterra ripped out 
the figures of St. Catherine and St. Blaise, both originally nude, and 
repainted them with flowing garments.

<HEAD>Michelangelo Would Have Run Afoul of Schlock Art Law, Attorney Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michelangelo would have run afoul of Massachusetts
law if he tried to sell his painting of the Sistine Chapel as an
original, an attorney challenging the state's new ``schlock art''
law claimed Monday.
   ``The statute as it is written defines `original' as requiring
only one person to work on it, and Michelangelo had apprentices that
helped him out,'' said attorney Alvin Nathanson.
   Nathanson represents United Oil Paintings Inc., which sells oil
paintings for $35 to $200 in seaside art galleries and shopping
malls up and down the Eastern seaboard. The company sued
Massachusetts saying the state law _ the first of its sort in the
nation _ is vague and unconstitutional.
   The law bans the sale of ``non-original art'' unless it is
labeled ``not an original.'' It defines original as ``independently
created and executed and signed by the individual artist'' _ a
standard Nathanson insists many Old Masters could not meet.
   After a three-day trial last week, both sides are now waiting for
Suffolk Superior Court Judge John Cratsley to decide what separates
original art from schlock. Cratsley is not expected to rule until
next month at the earliest.
   The state legislator who wrote the law said he only intended to
keep consumers from being sold cheap copies under the guise of
``original'' art.
   State Sen. Robert Buell said ``schlock art'' companies put names
similar to those of famous artists on paintings that are very
similar to the well-known works. While such paintings stop short of
forgery, Buell said, they are certainly not original.
   ``There's nothing wrong with selling it,'' said Buell, who
sponsored the law on behalf of artists in the seaside resort of
Rockport. ``It's just deceitful to tell the customer who's paying
$45 or $65 that he's getting an original painting.''
   United Oil, in a broad attack on the law, has asked the court not
only to define original but also to explain how police officers
charged with enforcing the law could be expected to make such
distinctions.
   Douglas H. Wilkins, the assistant attorney general defending the
state, has argued that the point is moot since United Oil has never
been prosecuted, though it has sold more than 60,000 paintings since
the law was passed.
   Wilkins also has argued that the law is constitutional because it
protects consumers against deceptive marketing.
   He told the judge it could be used to prosecute those who copy
others' work, make machine reproductions and sell them as original
oil paintings or sign false names to paintings.
   Wilkins dismissed the Michelangelo example, saying any law could
be challenged in the abstract using far-fetched examples.
   ``How are they going to sell the Sistine Chapel, anyway?'' he
said. ``Is it like selling the Brooklyn Bridge?''

FT  22 OCT 94 / Arts: Early works of a genius - William Packer on
Michelanglo at the National Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Gallery's admirable series of study exhibitions, Making &amp;
Meaning, focussing on particular works in terms both of the artist's
intentions and techniques, continues with a look at the early career of
Michelangelo. The period in question is the very end of the 15th century and
Michelangelo's first extended working visit to Rome.
He arrived from Florence in 1496, aged 21 yet already free from his early
apprenticeship in the studio of the brothers Ghirlandaio, Domenico and
David. His five-year stay was to see not only the confirmation of his
stylistic independence as a painter, but an astonishing burst of activity as
a sculptor and a sequence of masterpieces - the Bruges 'Madonna and Child',
the Rome 'Pieta', the 'Taddei Tondo' from Florence and the 'Pitti Tondo'
from the Royal Academy, all represented here in casts of the highest quality
 -that established him at once as an artist of the first rank and the
fullest maturity.
Sculpture took him back to Florence in 1501, to carve the monumental
'David', and it was sculpture that had brought him to Rome in the first
place. Having been advised to pass off a carved 'Sleeping Cupid' as an
antique, he learned that his Roman dealer had cheated him and so set out to
claim it back. He failed, and the 'Cupid' ended up in the hands of Isabella
d'Este at Mantua, along with a genuine antique of the same subject. It has
long since been lost, passing perhaps into the collections of Charles I and
destroyed in the Whitehall fire of 1698. Who knows? Two such similarly
exquisite 'cupids' are in this exhibition, one a Roman fountain-head of the
2nd century, from the Uffizi, the other a 16th century pastiche from Corsham
Court.
It is tempting but over-fanciful, no doubt, to take this last for the lost
Michelangelo. What is certain is that questions of false attribution and
dissimulation hung about him even at the very outset of his career. Small
wonder then that they do so still. The paintings, rarer than the sculpture,
have always been the more problematical. Only three panels are known from
Michelangelo's early career, of which the Uffizi's 'Doni Tondo' of the Holy
Family, tentatively dated about 1504, is the only one complete and
undisputed.
The other two, both of them unfinished, are in the National Gallery's own
collections. The earlier of them, from around 1497 and painted in egg
tempera, is known as 'the Manchester Madonna' and clearly carries with it,
if not the mark, at least the influence of Ghirlandaio. That is not to say
that it is not entirely authentic to Michelangelo. The easy, graceful
naturalism of the Virgin's gesture is alone enough to affirm the presence of
a younger hand and a fresher eye, to say nothing of the simple, sculptural
monumentality of the composition as a whole. The comparisons in detail with
the sculpture are conclusive. That has not stopped certain scholars from
proposing the existence of a corpus of work by a shadowy 'Master of the
Manchester Madonna'. This theory is immediately scotched, however, by direct
comparison with an example from Vienna of this putative master. There is no
comparison.
But it is the mysterious 'Entombment', dated about 1500 to fix it to a known
commission for an altarpiece for Sant'Agostino and painted in oil, which is
the greater puzzle. A drawing from the Louvre of a kneeling nude is
supposedly a study for the figure of Mary at the lower left of the
composition. A lone scholar has suggested it is not by Michelangelo at all,
and he has a point. For while this study is close enough in spirit, it
displays an openness and almost awkward linearity in its working that is not
quite up to the denser and more fluid modelling of Michelangelo.
But does a single dodgy drawing call into question the authenticity of the
entire painting? Was a drawing by someone else never useful to an artist? Do
inconsistencies in the handling and the drawing suggest anything more than
that one artist accepted help from another? Does lack of documentary
reference to a work, that was clearly full of formal problems and no less
clearly left off abruptly, necessarily require its removal from the canon?
Such arguments do seem so often to be put forward in a spirit of all or
nothing, when the probable reality was something altogether more practical
and mundane. Paintings take time, ideas shift and change, things go wrong.
My own view is that 'the Entombment' is a magnificent failure in a time when
the sculpture was going from spectacular to glorious success. It was not to
be until the Sistine paintings of only a few years later that Michelangelo
would be able finally to resolve, in terms of painting, the easy yet
monumental naturalism that he had already achieved in such sculptural
marvels as the 'Pieta'. The comparisons passim, between the paintings, the
sculpture and the ceilings soon to come, effectively make the point.

FT  01 OCT 93 / Arts: Drawn to Michelangelo - Susan Moore visits the Casa
Buonarroti in Florence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's museum revolution is gathering momentum. Earlier this year, the new
Minister of Culture Alberto Ronchey decreed that the country's notoriously
inhospitable state monuments, museums and galleries should be open from 9am
to 7pm. No more apologies pinned to firmly closed doors. No more closures at
two.
Over the summer in Florence, for example, some 20 museums welcomed visitors
for late evening viewing too. The city's museums have authorised an
unprecedented number of loans to London's Accademia Italiana for a Lorenzo
the Magnificent show which opens later this month. A few years ago, such a
project would have been unthinkable.
This cultural perestroika is also affecting what the public sees. Visitors
to one of Florence's least known small treasure houses, the Casa Buonarroti,
off the tourist track in via Ghibellina, will find 18 of its finest
Michelangelo drawings on show together for the first time (until October
31). Their display is a bold move in a country where museums tend to exhibit
facsimiles of drawings rather than originals.
Michelangelo never lived at the Casa Buonarroti. The present house was built
on a site he bought for his nephew and was later decorated by his
grand-nephew Michelangelo the Younger with frescoes which turned the
master's life into history. Loans and gifts supplementing the family
holdings, including works returned by the Medici, have transformed the house
into a veritable shrine.
Alongside portraits by Bugiardini and Daniele da Volterra is the most recent
addition to the Michelangelo iconography: a marble group of the young
Michelangelo sculpting the famous head of a faun by one Cesare Zocchi
(1851-1922). It seems a fearless act of homage seen beside Michelangelo's
technically daring low-relief 'Madonna of the Steps' and the tumult of
intertwined figures in the 'Battle of the Centaurs'.
The greatest glories of the drawings collection have long since gone,
dispersed by the family and now largely divided between the British Museum
and the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. What remains, as represented here, is a
fascinating group that reveals a great deal about the artist's range,
working practice and ever astonishing inventiveness.
We find figures studies and compositional sketches in pen and ink, black
chalk and red chalk, plans and elevations of churches and schemes for city
fortifications. There are vigorous working drawings precise enough to be
used by craftsmen, alongside extraordinary flights of imagination. A few
swift strokes of the pen on a letter to a friend describe how he painted the
Sistine ceiling.
Many of the drawings reveal Michelangelo's obsessive desire not to waste
paper, even though paper was no longer a luxury commodity. One particularly
beautiful early figure drawing, after a figure of Hercules on an antique
sarcophagus relief, was kept for some 20 years before being folded in four
and its verso re-used for jotting down expenses. The list includes the cost
of a pair of slippers for his nephew and heir Leonardo.
It is typical of Michelangelo's genius as well as his frugality that his
sketch for the elevation of San Lorenzo should be only some 10cm wide and
free-drawn in soft red chalk with little concern for accuracies of scale or
proportion. Other sheets here show him trying out various schemes for the
great staircase in the vestibule of the Laurentian Library and designing the
desk and benches for the reading room inside. On a drawing for the base of a
pilaster in the New Sacristy, he cannot resist adding an eye and a few extra
touches to turn the elaborate moulding into a profile of a gaping-mouthed
human head.
Most remarkable is a design for the monumental Porta Pia in Rome, the city
gate commissioned by Pope Pius IV and still immortalising his name. In this
much altered pen and wash drawing, heightened with white bodycolour,
Michelangelo has given his design a sculptural richness never previously
seen in architectural drawing.
In pride of place in the collection is one of the so-called 'presentation'
drawings. These exquisite chalk drawings were conceived as works of art in
their own right and given to his closest friends. This idealised head of
Cleopatra was presented to the Roman nobleman Tomasso dei Cavalieri. Its
recently uncovered verso presents an altogether more convincing image of the
queen post asp, wide-eyed and screaming.
Tomasso was obliged to surrender the drawing to Duke Cosimo de' Medici. In a
letter lamenting its departure, he said that it was like losing one of his
own children.

<HEAD>Collection Of Priceless Papal Gifts, Commissions Comes To Baltimore</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX DOMINGUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A collection of priceless religious items that
popes from the Middle Ages to the Baroque era commissioned or
received as gifts goes on display Thursday, the first time many
have been seen in the United States.
   The exhibit at the Walters Art Gallery commemorates the
bicentenntial of the Baltimore Archdiocese and the beginnings of
the Roman Catholic hierarchy in this country.
   ``Since we are celebrating the presence of the papacy on
American shores, every object has been commissioned by or given to
the pope,'' said Robert Bergman, director of the public museum.
   The collection consists of nearly 30 works, most of them created
for use in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel, the papal household's
private chapel.
   It includes a ninth-century gold enameled reliquary cross said
to have held pieces of the cross on which Christ was crucified, and
one of the most important medieval enamel objects in existence.
   Also in the collection are two tapestries designed by Raphael,
gold-threaded vestments made for Pope Clement VII (1523-1534) and
several illuminated manuscripts.
   About half the items have never been displayed in the United
States, and most have never been seen together, Bergman said.
   The exhibit, ``Splendor of the Popes: Treasures from the Sistine
Chapel and the Vatican Museums and Library,'' runs through Jan. 7
and is the culmination of two years of negotiations.
   ``It was sort of an elegant ballet of courtesies,'' Bergman
said. ``The negotiations took place on a clerical and
museum-professional level. We benefited from intervention from the
highest levels of the church.''
   The tapestries, vestments, artworks, crucifixes and manuscripts
have been arranged to resemble a chapel. A mock altar has been set
up at the head of the exhibit with tapestries and vestments along
the walls and religious manuscripts and other items in the center.
   ``The exhibit gives you the impression of the cascading levels
of embellishment of the Sistine Chapel that would have descended
from Michelangelo's frescoes,'' Bergman said.
   The two 15-foot tapestries designed by Raphael depict the
stoning of St. Stephen and the conversion of St. Paul, and are part
of a set of 10 made to be hung below Michelangelo's frescoes on the
Sistine Chapel's ceiling.
   ``Raphael's designs for the Sistine tapestries are considered
his most perfected and heroic works,'' Bergman said. ``The
monumental scale of Raphael's figures and their highly energized
character were clearly influenced by Michelangelo's recently
completed ceiling frescoes.''
   The tapestries have had eventful histories. Stolen twice and
taken as far Paris and Constantinople, they were reassembled during
the reign of Pope Paul III (1534-1549). In 1932, Pope Pius XI had
them placed in the Raphael Gallery of the Vatican Museums.
   The reliquary cross was made for Pope Paschal (817-824), and is
one of the Vatican's most precious treasures. It is the highlight
of the Sancta Sanctorum Treasure, a collection of objects and
relics found in the private chapel of the Lateran Basilica, the
seat of the papacy before the 14th century.
   Both the tapestries and the reliquary have never been seen in
the United States.

TRAVEL VIDEOS: A COUPLE OF WAYS OF VIEWING 'THE ETERNAL CITY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rome is filled with countless historic, artistic and architectural treasures 
that support its claim to the title, "The Eternal City." 
</P>
<P>
It's also a city of elegant shops, outdoor markets, museums, cappuccino bars, 
trattorias, gelaterias, sidewalk cafes and monumental traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
In two diverse Rome videos, each of which is less than an hour and reviewed 
below, the producers capture its essence very well. 
</P>
<P>
"Rome" (International Video Network, Video Visits, 55 minutes. 1989). 
</P>
<P>
Most of the historic attractions in this mosaic are at the numerous piazzas 
that dot the city. At the piazzas, Romans are usually surrounded by tourists 
attracted by the classical palazzos, churches, monuments and fountains. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the many popular places are the Piazza del Popolo, with its huge 
Egyptian obelisk; the Piazza di Spagna with the Spanish Steps and the piazzas 
Barberini, Navona and Trevi, with their wondrous fountains. 
</P>
<P>
Other stops include the Palazzo dei Conservatori (city of hall) on Capitoline 
Hill, where viewers are guests at a wedding, and the impressive Pantheon, the 
oldest and best preserved of Rome's ancient buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In the shadow of Capitoline Hill is the ancient Forum, where scenes include the 
Colosseum, the site of the Circus Maximus and the ruins of Palatine Hill, where 
Rome was founded. A side trip follows the Appian Way to the historic catacombs. 
</P>
<P>
The video also makes visits to the beautiful Borehese Gardens, lake and art 
gallery; the Mouth of Truth sculpture, which is said to bite the hand of a liar 
who puts his hand in it; the island of Tiberina, and the old Left Bank 
Trastevere district, with the lovely 3rd-Century Church of St. Cecilia. 
</P>
<P>
The segment on Vatican City includes the Ponte Vittoria Emanuele (bridge), 
Castel Sant-Angelo and St. Peter's for scenes of the Pope, the Vatican Gardens 
and museums and the Sistine Chapel dominated by Michelangelo's monumental 
ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
Other churches to see include the basilica of St. John Lateran, St. Peter in 
Chains and St. Paul's Outside the Walls. 
</P>
<P>
The video concludes with scenes of Rome at night, the Via Veneto at sunset and 
lighted views of fountains. 
</P>
<P>
Although it holds no surprises, this is a well-photographed and well-narrated 
traditional travelogue that will appeal mainly to the armchair traveler. 
</P>
<P>
It offers no tips or travel recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
A tape is available from International Video Network, Video Visits, 2242 Camino 
Ramon, San Ramon, Calif. 94583, (415) 866-1121. Price: $24.95. 
</P>
<P>
"Rome" (VPI/AC Video, produced by Robin Williams, 50 minutes, 1988). Travel 
film maker Williams' video focuses on the cultural attractions found in Rome, 
concentrating on classical art, architecture and ancient history. It should 
have a special appeal for armchair travelers, and if used in conjunction with 
the above "Rome" video, should enrich the trip of a vacationer. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' interest in the piazzas of Rome centers on the fountains created by 
such artists as Giovanni Lorenzo Bernini and on the history and architectural 
significance of the surrounding churches and palazzos. 
</P>
<P>
A few that he examines include the charming Tortoise Fountain in tiny Piazza 
Mattei; the Boat Fountain and the Spanish Steps in the Piazza di Spagna; the 
Triton Fountain in the Piazza Barberini, and the impressive Fountain of the 
Four Rivers, the Moor and the Neptune in the Piazza Navona. Others are the 
Fountain of Trevi and the elegant churches of the Piazza Quirinale. 
</P>
<P>
On an extensive tour of the Vatican, Williams describes the design of St. 
Peter's Square and basilica and singles out the famous "Pieta" by Michelangelo 
and "The Throne of St. Peter's" by Bernini, for special attention. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight is a visit to the Sistine Chapel and its ceiling for close 
studies and a history of Michelangelo's magnificent work. Also studied is 
Raphael's "School of Athens," as well as many of his other paintings in the 
Papal quarters. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican visit concludes with a history and film on the Swiss Guard and a 
tour of the Vatican Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
A segment of interest follows the journey of St. Paul from the time he landed 
in Italy through his trial, death and burial, including scenes of the Appian 
Way, the Forum (with drawings as it looked then) and the Basilica of St. Paul's 
Outside the Walls where he is buried. 
</P>
<P>
The video and narration also describe the founding of Rome, the building of the 
Colosseum and give a detailed examination of the Forum and its ruins, including 
the Arch of Septimus Severus that Napoleon used as a model for the Arc de 
Triomphe in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Other ancient sites include the Palatine Hill, the Circus Maximus and the 
Trajan Markets and column. 
</P>
<P>
Two pleasant side trips visit the tower of Tivoli with the Villa d'Este and its 
beautiful gardens and fountains and to the lakeside summer retreats of Nemi and 
Albano in the Alban Hills. 
</P>
<P>
It seems as if Williams' video was filmed by two cameras. The scenic shots are 
often fuzzy, but the artworks are good and the musical score is effective. It 
will be helpful to those interested in an aesthetic view of Rome. 
</P>
<P>
No tips or travel recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
A tape is available from VPI/AC, 381 Park Ave. South, New York 10016, (212) 
685-5522. Price; $24.95.

   Call it the crawfish war.
   When Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower said Louisiana
crawfish are smaller, smellier, dirtier, dumber and less tasty than
those in the Lone Star State, his counterpart in Louisiana was quick
to respond.
   ``Jim Hightower will have to back out and crawl,'' Commissioner
Bob Odom said Wednesday, referring to the way a startled crawfish
runs from danger.
   ``The one market we've gone head to head with Texas crawfish has
been in the Swedish market,'' Odom said.
   ``Louisiana beat the hell out of them.''
   But Hightower crowed about his state's crawfish, saying the Texas
variety were cleaner because packers put them through a brief fast
to clean out intestinal impurities.
   ``At long last we have a pure Texas crawfish that is going to
save us Texans from the shame and humiliation that we have
experienced over the last many, many generations of having to eat
those smelly, mud-coated, itty-bitty, slow-witted crawfish from
Louisiana,'' Hightower said.
   The crawfish skirmish is of no little consequence. Hightower
estimated that the crawfish industry could mean $120 million in
direct sales for Texas farmers and about 1,000 jobs.

   Jennifer Brown isn't looking for a
little Michelangelo, but she did teach her middle school art
students something about the difficulties of painting the ceiling of
the Sistine Chapel.
   Ms. Brown's students at the Childers Middle School were required
recently to draw on paper taped to the bottom of their desks.
   ``There were a lot of moans and groans,'' she said. ``Some
thought it was cruel. Some thought it was cool. But once they got
started I think most of the students enjoyed it.''
   The youngsters spent parts of three days on their backs, drawing
a likeness of their hands.
   ``Michelangelo painted figures on the ceiling of the Sistine
Chapel, so we painted hands instead, which is a part of the body, at
least,'' she said.
   The teacher said some students who had trouble with other
assignments excelled on this project. ``I joked with some of them
that they would have to draw on their backs all the time,'' Ms.
Brown said.

FT  04 JUN 93 / Technology: Grime removed from Michelangelo's frescoes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DECADE of work by Vatican restorers has removed nearly five centuries of
ancient and modern grime from Michelangelo's frescoes in the Sistine Chapel,
writes Andrew Baxter.
But now that the frescoes are clean, how can they be kept so when subjected
to the breath and body heat of 2m visitors each year? Today, Pope John Paul
II officially accepts the answer - a completed air treatment system for the
Sistine Chapel from William Frago, president of Carrier, the world's largest
air conditioning manufacturer.
Years of research by Carrier of the US and the Vatican's own experts have
gone into designing a system that is effective and discreet. Temperature and
air flow studies indicated that warm, moist air was rising up towards the
ceiling every morning as doors opened and visitors flowed in. The warm air
spread across the ceiling, then cooled and descended, leaving behind
moisture and dirt on the frescoes. Excessive moisture would encourage the
growth of mould and the formation of salt deposits.
The solution, therefore, was to install a system that provided a clean,
stable microclimate for the frescoes. Control of relative humidity is the
most important aim, because large swings allow water movement into and out
of the plaster. Minimising overall temperature differences reduces expansion
and contraction of the fresco material.
A Carrier air handling unit delivers fresh air which has been filtered,
washed and processed before entering the Chapel through diffusers under the
south windows, about 15m up. These create two air flows, one of low velocity
which flows over the surface of the frescoes, and a second which effectively
bathes visitors with a 'shower' of clean air at floor level, where the air
is extracted. The windows will remain closed to Rome's noise and pollution.
Two computer terminals, one in the Vatican's energy centre and the other
with the restoration scientists, allow information from the system to be
stored and evaluated, to ensure the frescoes retain their new-found sparkle.

<TEXT>     As the article on the restoration of the Sistine Chapel noted, "the
restoration of Michelangelo's last piece, his apocalyptic painting of the Last
Judgment, cannot recover the true colors and painting of Michelangelo because
the 30 nudes were not just painted over, they were covered with plaster and no
one can remove the additions. They were covered up in compliance with the
rulings of the Council of Trent in 1563.";    And in the Supreme Court's
ruling against nude dancing at an Indiana bar, Chief Justice William Rehnquist
wrote for the majority that "Public nudity is the evil the state seeks to
prevent, whether or not it is combined with expressive activity." And the
nudes were covered up with the paper of a legal opinion shaped into pasties.; 
  Four hundred and 28 years have gone by, but nothing has changed. In the
minds of the modern day Republican justices, nudity is as evil as it was in
the minds of the members of the Council of Trent. In one case the decision was
the work of appointees of two Republican presidents, Reagan and Bush, in the
other, appointees of the Catholic Church.;    Morality and the power to
control it were the only issues then and are the only issues today. A legal
finding of the Supreme Court was, only, a cover up. The real issue was the
high court's power to mandate morality.;    Then, Michelangelo refused to
paint over his work. His message for the Pope was "let him make the world a
suitable place and the painting will fit in." So it was another artist who
covered the offending genitals.;    But what of today? Who shall stand for us
as Michelangelo did? Thomas Paine is no longer among us and the opposition
party has no one with the strength of character to do so. We are not yet lost,
but I fear we are close.;    -- Fred C. Stanford; Redwood City  </TEXT>

   The Gallery: A Gericault Retrospective
   ----
   By Alexandra Tuttle

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12
</SO>
<LP>
   Paris -- In 1820, it was one of London's most popular
entertainments. The public queued up outside the Egyptian
Hall, Piccadilly, for hours in order to pay a shilling for
the privilege of beholding "The Raft of the Medusa," Theodore
Gericault's huge, 24-by-18-foot painting of shipwrecked
sailors adrift in the sea off the coast of Africa. Today art
is still one of the best spectacles on offer, but we live in
a more cautious age. The painting that traveled across the
Channel in the early 19th century is now deemed too fragile
to make the half-mile trip up the Champs Elysees from the
Louvre to the Grand Palais for the first major retrospective
of the art of Gericault.
   That Gericault's best-known work should be missing from
this exhibition of 300 paintings, drawings and engravings is
ironic but appropriate; the fame of the "Medusa" has long
obscured the true worth of an artist who is arguably the
equal of his more famous contemporaries, Jacques Louis David
and Eugene Delacroix. Everyone knows the painting but few
recognize the painter, and this is for several reasons.
Gericault died when he was 32, at a time when, like most
painters, he was just emerging from his long apprenticeship
to the past.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Moreover, he is an art historical enigma, a copyist of
startling originality whose work manages to be derivative yet
modern. In their energetic brushwork and melodramatic
lighting, Gericault's copies of Raphael and Michelangelo
presage the later work of Courbet and Cezanne. He even
managed to make the classical themes he copied from such
constipated academics as David and Jean-Antoine Gros
interesting if not downright exciting. What's more, David
knew what he was up against. The old master was puzzled by
Gericault's 1812 portrait of an anonymous "Officer of the
Imperial Guard," saying: "I don't recognize this touch." And
indeed, the "touch" would not show up in French painting for
another 40 years.
   These days, Gericault is merely hard to characterize and
explain, but his contemporaries found his art both confusing
and unsettling. He painted during a period (1812-1824) that
stands as a parenthesis in French history, a historical
vacuum during which history seemed to have lost the momentum
that carried it through 20 years of revolution, war and
empire. Not yet a republic but no longer a convincing
kingdom, post-Napoleonic France was rudderless and drifting,
very much like the raft in Gericault's painting.
   Such successful painters as David and Gros played up to
the era's most cherished myths with portraits of generals and
battle scenes in the flat, technicolored academic style
perfectly suited to the strident claims of imperial bombast.
The show at the Grand Palais, which runs until Jan. 6, begins
with Gros's tribute to Napoleonic overstatement, the stately,
static painting of "Murat, King of Naples." On the wall
opposite hangs Gericault's more somber portrait of the
"Officer of the Imperial Guard" from the same period.
Although well received by the critics who saw Gericault's
officer as heroism personified, the painting is more
subversive than the hagiographic work of Gros and David.
Hesitant and reflective, the officer seems at odds with his
powerful horse, looking backward over his shoulder as his
mount charges into war. French historian Jules Michelet wrote
that "he makes war while thinking," a sure recipe for
disaster in battle.
   The Paris show is full of the horses Gericault loved and
painted in abundance throughout his short career. He devoted
entire canvases to horse parts; a large painting depicts
three rows of hindquarters-abstracted and detached from the
rest of the animal, but powerful nonetheless. Whether painted
alone in the "Barberi Race," a riderless horse race held at
the end of Carnival every year in Rome, or mounted in the
portrait of "Three Trumpeters on Horseback," the horses
express a superhuman and unfettered sexuality.
   The ironic juxtaposition of the horse's power with the
rider's impotence illustrates in formal terms Gericault's
tragic view of the human nature. The rounded, sensual
horseflesh represents a physical ideal that no spindly
soldier can attain. However heroic the posture of the officer
in the 1812 painting, he can only be diminished by comparison
with the horse. And yet, Gericault's irony manages to be
romantic; unlike his classical masters, he is able to paint
failure in all its heroism.
   The artist's compassion for that failure can be seen in
the superb portraits of madmen he painted at the end of his
life. They supposedly were commissioned by a specialist in
the study of monomania to illustrate different kinds of
insanity: kleptomania, envy, the compulsion to gamble,
pedophilia. The illnesses could be picturesque, but Gericault
avoids caricature by means of his rigorous realism, his
fidelity to the details that make these textbook
illustrations individuals rather than mere types. Like the
arms and legs from the morgue he drew in preparation for his
"The Raft of the Medusa," these faces are poignant rather
than macabre.
   How well Gericault articulates the tragedy of the insane,
shipwrecked in their madness, adrift, unmoored but desperate
for contact with the rest of the world. And nowhere is that
theme better expressed than in "The Raft of the Medusa," his
painting of a real-life shipwreck off the coast of Senegal.
The many preparatory oils and drawings at the Grand Palais
show that the artist took his theme seriously, interviewing
two of the wreck's 15 survivors and commissioning a small
model of the raft from which to paint.
   Many of the preliminary drawings for the "Medusa" exhibit
Gericault's unique and paradoxical blend of formal beauty and
grisly content. The hacked-off arm and hand in one drawing
retains its expressive power, its nobility, though it has
become a "thing," long separated from its human origins.
Similarly, the painting's pathetic survivors appear in all
their failed grandeur. Hungry, thirsty and nearly dead after
weeks at sea, a few still manage to wave frantically at the
speck on the horizon that was to become the ship that rescued
them. Despite the artist's grim realism, his eye for grisly
detail, the wasted bodies near death are as beautiful as
those vital bodies on the ceiling of Michelangelo's Sistine
Chapel.
   Like any great painting, "The Raft of the Medusa" has much
to say about life and art. Shipwrecked sailors or shiftless
madmen, we are never equal to the challenge of the other; we
always fall short of our desire to connect with the world.
But our despair and frustration possess a violent and
creative energy. As he lay dying of a bone abcess brought on
by repeated falls from his horse, Gericault complained that
he had never painted anything worthwhile. Yet he took to
drawing his left hand with his right, explaining that "I am
using myself." In Gericault's world, we have to make do with
what remains, and what remains is art.

   Modern Artists Forget Their History

   A great cry has been raised by the contemporary art world
that the tiniest infringement of total freedom exerts a
crippling effect on an artist's creative imagination.
   It's a cry that would be silly if it weren't so rabid, as
any art historian should know that none of the titans of past
centuries -- neither Michelangelo nor Rembrandt nor El Greco
nor Shakespeare -- was ever free to insult and/or belittle
the fundamental beliefs of his church and people. Nor until
modern times did many of them even want to.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The only significant event in the reign of England's King
John was the signing of the Magna Carta. Viewed by
Shakespeare as impairing the power of the Tudor monarchy, he
omitted it entirely from his "King John." A principle feature
of the Battle of Agincourt was the slaughter of French
prisoners and wounded by English soldiers. Shakespeare barely
hinted at it in his "Henry V." Two earth-shaking events of
14th-century England were Wat Tyler's Peasant Rebellion, when
rebels took London and beheaded the Archbishop of Canterbury,
and Wycliffe's fiery theological heresies. Chaucer's
"Canterbury Tales," a supposedly all-embracing tapestry of
medieval life, mentions them nowhere.
   Yet, despite these political inhibitions, Shakespeare and
Chaucer managed to produce works generally thought to have
artistic merit. As every schoolchild should know, the female
roles in Shakespeare were played by boys, as the Elizabethans
considered it indecent for women to exhibit themselves on the
stage. So at the Globe theater Romeo had to declare his
passionate love for Juliet to a 14-year-old boy. Somehow he
managed.
   Cervantes, unlike the image of him evoked by Broadway's
"Man of La Mancha," never had a word to say against the
Spanish Inquisition. Far from a dissident spirit "dreaming
the impossible dream," he fought as a Spanish officer against
the infidel Turk at Lepanto, one of the greatest naval
battles in history. Spain's most illustrious playwright, Lope
de Vega, sailed to conquer England in no less a venture than
the Spanish Armada.
   Michelangelo, closer in temperament to some artists of
today, quarreled with his principal patron, Pope Julius II.
Considering himself a sculptor, Michelangelo had little
interest in painting, but the pope had means of inducement
and Michelangelo, under protest, relented. The result of this
tyrannical coercion was the Sistine Chapel.
   Although there had been earlier flareups (Florence's
Savonarola, who carried out the original "Bonfire of the
Vanities"), the censorial spirit made a massive entry into
the arts with Oliver Cromwell. His Puritans, considering the
theater the "devil's workshop," shut it down entirely.
(Cromwell also banned as a pagan holiday Christmas, which
somehow survived.)
   But theatrical censorship in the modern sense was
introduced in England in the 18th century by Sir Robert
Walpole, the country's first prime minister. Much nettled at
the barbed satires of a young dramatist named Henry Fielding,
Walpole endowed the Lord Chamberlain with strict powers of
censorship, both political and moral, which he retained for
some 250 years, doing no noticeable damage to the works of
Sheridan, Goldsmith, George Bernard Shaw, or Oscar Wilde.
   For his part, Henry Fielding took to the novel, wrote "Tom
Jones" and, entirely unembittered by Walpole's attack -- a
lawyer as well as a writer -- became England's first police
magistrate. A strong law-and-order man who thought the
government was indulging criminals, Fielding organized the
"Fleet Street Runners," which became London's police force.
   A sea change took place in the West's artistic communities
in the late 18th and 19th centuries, writers and artists,
beginning with the Romantics, becoming by fits and starts
"adversarial."
   But the great artistic hullabaloos in France, where in
this period the art world became firmly centered, are often
misrepresented by modern activists seeking martyrs. Although
censorship existed, the Impressionists were not condemned for
offenses to decency but, briefly, for violation of artistic
conventions -- and not by the state but by the day's art
establishment.
   What were these Impressionists doing painting ordinary,
vulgar people? In bourgeois apartments? In the open air? In
such garish colors? The brouhaha did the Impressionists far
more good than harm, and Claude Monet's ascent was such that
he became a regular Sunday dinner companion of French Premier
Georges Clemenceau. Vincent van Gogh, whose "Portrait of
Doctor Gachet" was just sold at Sotheby's for $82.5 million,
could hardly have been condemned, as almost nobody had heard
of him. In his lifetime he sold only one painting.
   As for political dissent, when painter Gustave Courbet
sided with the Communards in the abortive Paris Commune of
1871, he was brought swiftly to justice by the Third
Republic. When Jean-Louis Barrault, director of France's
national Odeon Theater, took the side of student rebels in
1968 he was as swiftly sacked by Culture Minister Andre
Malraux of the Fifth Republic.
   Attempts by America's current art establishment to obtain
absolute immunity for publicly funded "cutting edge" artworks
are doubly specious, as the cutting-edge artistic "rebellion"
of our day is in no way comparable to the past's great
stylistic upheavals. There are now, simply, no artistic
canons left against which to rebel.
   Painter Robert Rauschenberg talks of the necessity of
shock to create a "new social awareness," and Roy
Lichtenstein of "suffering the sophomoric to achieve the
sublime." But artistic rebellion today is empty, driven for
meaning to a shabby assemblage of hand-me-down radical
political cliches. As a means of achieving the sublime it is
not likely to have impressed Julius II or Lorenzo de Medici.

   A Michelangelo drawing of the suicide of
Cleopatra, discovered only last August, will go on display for the
first time on Sunday at the National Gallery of Art, Director J.
Carter Brown said Tuesday.
   The new drawing had not been noticed before because it was on
the reverse side of a better known work that had been pasted onto a
backing. Conservators decided that the well-known drawing, which
also depicts the ancient Egyptian ruler, was not being preserved
properly on the backing, so it was removed.
   ``When they did, to everyone's great delight they were able to
reveal the fact that there was this drawing on the reverse, which
was also of Cleopatra, but in a very different mood,'' said Brown.
   The well-known drawing on the front illustrates the traditional
story of her suicide, in which she had an asp brought to her in a
basket of figs and put it on her arm. It shows the snake biting her
breast. Cleopatra's hair is carefully dressed and her expression is
calm and melancholy.
   The newly-found drawing, much less finished, shows her hair in
disorder, her eyes staring out at the viewer and her mouth open as
if in a scream.
   Bernard Berenson, the American critic, spent much of his life in
Florence, Italy, studying Michelangelo and other painters of the
period. At the turn of this century, he questioned whether the
drawing on the front was by Michelangelo, suggesting that it might
be by a collaborator he called ``Andrea di Michelangelo.''
   Later critics have become convinced that Michelangelo himself
did the drawing.
   ``There is no such person as Andrea di Michelangelo,'' said
Giuseppina Ragionieri, director of the Casa Buonarotti, the
Florence museum lodged in what was once the painter's home.
   She has come to Washington for the exhibit ``Michaelangelo:
Draftsman@Architect.'' The largest showing of his graphic work ever
mounted in this country, it will be at the gallery's West Building
until Dec. 11.
   Cleopatra killed herself in the year 30 B.C. to avoid being
taken to Rome and put on display by the man who later became the
Emperor Augustus. He had defeated Cleopatra and her lover, Mark
Antony, in the great naval battle of Actium the year before.
   Her story has been told many times in art and literature,
including Shakespeare's ``Antony and Cleopatra.''
   Michelangelo drew her some time before 1534, about 70 years
earlier than Shakespeare's play.

FT  16 APR 94 / Arts: Triumph of Architecture Exhibition in Venice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Venice has always offered some of the most brilliant architectural
experiences in Europe. This year it is also possible to experience the whole
history of Italian Renaissance architecture in one Venetian palazzo. The
exhibition, organised by Fiat's cultural institute at the Palazzo Grassi, is
a total triumph. No one with any interest in the architectural and cultural
history of Europe can afford to miss it.
The story goes that on a visit with the Pope to see the revelatory
restoration of Michelangelo's frescoes in the Sistine Chapel, Giovanni
Agnelli, chairman of Fiat, asked if the Vatican, 'had any more great
surprises ..' 'Well' came the reply, 'we do have the legendary Renaissance
model of St Peter's - perhaps the greatest architectural model in the world
 -but it is in desperate need of repair and no one ever sees it.'
From this conversation was born the idea of the exhibition. Fiat has brought
together the architectural work of Michelangelo, Raphael, Bramante,
Leonardo, Peruzzi, Sangallo and many other masters.
Antonio da Sangallo produced his final design for the greatest church in
Christendom in the 1530s. It took seven years to build the model, between
1539 and 1546, and the designer tragically died before it was completed.
Sangallo's plan for St Peter's was a major adaptation of Bramante's design,
but it was never executed and the model we see was succeeded by
Michelangelo's dynamic plan. For 450 years Sangallo's St Peter's was stored
in the Vatican and inevitably became the victim of slow decay.
Today, the restored model - four and a half metres high - stands at the
heart of the exhibition at the Palazzo Grassi. It is possible to walk under
its dome and see the detail and finishes of the interior. Because it stands
in the great central court of the palazzo it is also possible to have a
bird's eye view from above.
Once you have had the extraordinary experience of walking through the model,
you are confronted by the second wonder of the show; Michelangelo's sublime
model of his dome for St. Peter's. This is brilliantly shown suspended above
the main staircase. It would not be fair to say that the contrast makes
Sangallo's work look unsettled but the serenity of Michelangelo's design
explains why his scheme for the basilica was preferred.
The sub-title of the exhibition is 'the representation of architecture' and
it is a challenging theme for an exhibition that has to be both scholarly
and accessible. Architectural exhibitions are notoriously difficult to stage
but I have no doubt that this is the best one I have ever seen. I recall the
brilliant Palladio exhibition, that also depended for its success upon
architectural models, at the Royal Academy. But no one has ever before put
together the whole range of Italian Renaissance models in a way that makes
them moving objects in themselves and telling demonstrations of the progress
of architectural history.
A great deal of the credit for the success of the exhibition belongs to
Mario Bellini who designed it. His task was to tell the story of how
Renaissance architecture developed and how it succeeded in replacing the
Gothic style. There are 31 surviving 15th and 16th century models, each one
providing a high point in the story. They are supported by documents,
drawings, paintings and manuscripts which provide the intellectual
foundations for the buildings.
The setting is one of low light and grey walls, but there are literally
magic moments of high illumination which bring visual drama and excitement
to the complex story. There is a particular moment of clarity when you reach
the 'Ideal City' painting from Urbino which is shown at the end of a sloping
perspective, brilliantly lit in a darkened room. Paintings are used
throughout to show that people and architecture belong together.
Architecture is often used in paintings as a stage setting, framing crucial
political events or scenes of spiritual progress. Stage design and
architecture meet here to create the new world of great Renaissance palaces
or churches. This exhibition utilises the same disciplines of display and
drama to expose the story of Renaissance architectural creativity.
This great exhibition needs to be visited more than once. It brings the
third dimension to life making the buildings of the Renaissance both
comprehensible and amazing in the scale of their achievement. The catalogue
is 700 pages long but do not be daunted - the glory of the architectural
models and the soaring triumph of the great Sangallo basilica will always
remain in your mind.
Renaissance - from Brunelleschi to Michelangelo: the Representation of
Architecture: Palazzo Grassi, Venice, until November 6 (closed for mid-show
conservation July 18-August 18): sponsored by Fiat, with Alitalia.

   The United States will begin its first

Nuclear Forces treaty on Sept. 8.
   The Defense Department, in a brief statement Monday, said the
notice was forwarded to Moscow in accordance with the terms of the
treaty signed by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev in Washington last year.
   Destruction of the solid-fuel rocket motors for the Pershing II
missiles will begin on Sept. 8, ``weather permitting,'' at the
Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant near Marshall, Texas, the Pentagon
said.
   The treaty, which became effective earlier this summer, requires
the superpowers to dismantle and destroy the intermediate-and
shorter-range nuclear missiles in their arsenals. The United States
has two such types of missiles _ the ground-launched cruise missile
and the Pershing II.

   The House has approved legislation to bring
the United States into line with an international agreement to
combat illegal trafficking in African elephant ivory.
   The measure sent to the Senate by voice vote on Monday would
prohibit imports into this country of any ivory taken in violation
of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.
   That worldwide agreement uses a system of quotas and ivory
markings in an effort to regulate the international trade in ivory
from African elephants, whose numbers have fallen to an estimated
700,000 from 1.5 million in 1979.
   The bill would ban importation of raw ivory from any nation
without a native elephant population and would prohibit exportation
of raw ivory from the United States.

   Did Michelangelo zap you?
   As you must know by now, we're not talking about the man
who painted the Sistine Chapel, or your eight-year-old child
dressed up as a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle. The Michelangelo
of the moment is a sinister bit of software rigged to kick in
at the stroke of midnight last night, wiping out all the data
inside a PC as soon as it's turned on.

<TEXT>
   The world will find out today whether Michelangelo is a
genuine plague or just a digital common cold. But already
Michelangelo-mania qualifies as the greatest high-tech
hysteria to grip the nation since Skylab fell out of the sky
in 1979.
   All week, Nightline, McNeil-Lehrer and hundreds of other
TV shows and newspapers have been on Michelangelo watch. Like
air-raid monitors warning how to duck and cover during an
attack, computer experts have been demonstrating how to
practice "safe computing" by administering software
"vaccines" with names like PC-cillin and PCrx.
   McAfee Associates, the No. 1 vendor of anti-virus
software, has been logging 2,500 calls a day for the past
week. Cable News Network was planning to broadcast live from
McAfee's Santa Clara, Calif., office throughout today.
   "People are really coming unglued," the company's chief,
John McAfee, said yesterday in a breathless exchange on his
way to a TV interview. "We've had about six hours' sleep in
five days."
   It's not as if Michelangelo is the only virus out there.
The Pakistani Brain, the Maltese Amoeba, the Kennedy Virus
and about 2,000 other strains are all said to be coursing
through the world's computers.
   But Michelangelo has become the first celebrity virus. One
reason is its enormous element of suspense: a countdown to
disaster culminating on the birthdate of its namesake. Its
threat -- total data annihilation -- is unusually dire. And
Madison Avenue couldn't have given it a catchier name.
   "Suddenly it's like living in California waiting for the
earthquake," says Jacob Slichter, a Minneapolis musician and
writer. He says local radio stations have been issuing
regular Michelangelo warnings, and just yesterday a rumor
circulated that a nearby nuclear power plant caught the dread
virus. "Now people are fantasizing about South Minnesota
going up in ashes because the plutonium is somehow wired into
the computer," he says.
   Much about Michelangelo is still a mystery, including its
origins. Computer viruses spread invisibly, programmed to
copy themselves from one disk to another. According to Mr.
McAfee, a professor in Germany first spotted the Michelangelo
program in early 1991. Virus-watchers think it may actually
have originated in the Netherlands, because of an early
cluster of sightings there.
   Reports of a Michelangelo epidemic started circulating on
computer bulletin boards a few months ago. "This destructive
virus is spreading world-wide very rapidly," read one January
posting on a California board.
   The whispers quickly turned into a roar, thanks in large
part to a media blitz by a hitherto obscure sub-segment of
the software industry. Like evangelists thundering against
doomsday, they sent a loud message that the way to computing
salvation lay in investing $80 or $100 in new anti-virus
software.
   The message worked wonders. Central Point Software Inc.,
maker of the "Michelangelo Protection Kit," recently hired
workers for a new 12-hour shift so it could pump out products
round the clock. Sales have also been brisk at Peter Norton,
where callers are greeted with a message urging them to buy
its "Michelangelo Limited Edition" software. McAfee
Associates, which distributes its anti-virus program via
computer bulletin-board, says the board's 16 lines have been
busy 24 hours a day.
   Mr. McAfee has a team of virus-busters who walk around his
office wearing black gloves. His office wall has a lush
painting of a spaceship cruising through the universe zapping
viruses. This week he has been going on television and
warning that 500,000 to 1.5 million computers are infected
with Michelangelo -- an estimate some scoff at.
   "He's got a terrific product, but he has a tendency to
hype things," says Charles Rutstein, author of the Executive
Guide to Computer Viruses, just out in a hastily issued
second printing.
   It's no hype, says Mr. McAfee. Major high-tech companies
like Intel Corp. and Leading Edge have found viruses in their
computers. Dataquest, a respected market-researcher, this
week reported that 15% of companies it surveyed had at least
one outbreak of Michelangelo.
   Israel Rittberg, president of a small Levittown, N.Y.,
company that sells software to real-estate offices, worked
round the clock Wednesday night removing the Michelangelo
virus from a customer's computers. He caught two hours' sleep
and then raced to another customer who also found the virus.
"These people are vandals," he says angrily.
   Some virus-watchers were expecting damage as early as
yesterday, since computers' built-in calendars may have
overlooked leap year and declared March 6 a day early. And
indeed, Mr. McAfee said late yesterday that he'd heard
reports that the virus had already destroyed data at more
than a dozen U.S. companies, but those reports were fuzzy and
unconfirmed.
   Even if Michelangelo turns out to be underwhelming, that
won't necessarily put an end to virus fever. For one thing,
the antivirus vendors can always take credit for safely
inoculating the nation's computers -- like the old joke about
the man who walks around with an "elephant stick" even though
he's miles away from any elephant. "See, it works]" he
retorts.
   And a few software companies are already pushing products
to eradicate the next looming threat to computer data: the
Friday the 13th virus. That's a week from today.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Travel: A Tuscan history lesson - The Arno and Tiber valleys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE GARDINER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the forest you walk on velvet. The only sound along paths of deep-piled
leaf-mould is that of a beech leaf or prickly chestnut detaching itself.
Here in middle Tuscany you see no bird or animal, nothing on the move until
next Thursday when the forestry vehicle passes by. The occasional woodcutter
stares in amazement: 'What are you doing up here? Looking for mushrooms?'
You cross a clearing, the fairy ring of the charcoal- burners, a vanished
trade. You come to a silent village which has sprouted off the rock, under
the woodland canopy, as harmoniously as a clump of flowers.
The pink marsiglia pantiles, all askew, are reinforced with flagstones, the
lintels pitted with chisel marks, the doors tied up with old stockings and
the cracks in the bulging walls strapped with iron bands. A woman in peasant
black stares at you.
We are on the horseshoe curve of hills which encloses the Casentino, the
valley of the infant Arno river. From one side you might almost see the
domes of Florence, from the other the tower blocks of Rimini. Up the valley
a road and a light railway crawl this way and that, looking for the Arno's
source. One or two roads struggle up to the watershed and, at summit level,
you can park your car and walk into that rarest of modern Italian qualities
 -solitude.
History ancient and modern is locked up in these hills. On a small road
above Arezzo we explored La Verna's rock-cut monastery, important in the
life of St Francis of Assisi. Displayed here are his staff, rope girdle,
sandals and flagella. On Sundays the place is thronged. Several hundred sit
down to lunch which, being prepared by the monks, is cheap and ghastly.
I walked the Pratomagno or 'Great Meadow,' starting at Vallombrosa where
Milton played the organ. The switchback trail along the tops begins at a
lonely rifugio where huntsmen, at 8am, were drinking brandy and cursing the
mist. It was misty all the way. Long before I saw it I heard the wind
whistling through the latticework of the Croce di Pratomagno.
Nearby I located the stone which commemorates Bert Hinkler, long-distance
aviator and native of Queensland. A wreath of flowers lies there,
camouflaged in fallen leaves. The Australian ambassador had been up there a
few days earlier in a helicopter, marking the 60th anniversary of the night
when Hinkler in his Puss Moth, en route from Croydon in England to Sydney,
crashed into the mountains. Two months later, when the snows had melted, a
shepherd found the wreckage and a search party found the body, some distance
away, partly eaten by foxes.
From heights like these you look down on the Casentino with its steady
stream of traffic and a rail-car which stops at every wayside halt. Down
there, promiscuous housing spreads over the fields where Dante fought in the
last battle of the civil wars. Down there, light industry pollutes the
Casentino brooks which, in Dante's Inferno, tormented souls longed for.
Italy's economic growth has transformed rural Tuscany. It is hard in that
semi-industrial scene to pick out the box-like 12th-century towers of the
Guidi counts which dot the course of the Arno.
Never mind. It is still haunted, hallowed ground. This district was the
seed-plot of Renaissance genius. Pratovecchio, terminus of the little train,
gave birth to Paolo Uccello, whose Battle of San Romano used to hang over
Lorenzo de' Medici's bed.
Masaccio, enfant terrible of the Florence art scene (his name meant 'Wicked
Tom'), was born at Loro Ciuffenna on the Pratomagno. Vicchio, just beyond
the horseshoe of the hills, was the cradle of Giotto. From the valley towns
came Vasari and Petrarch (Arezzo), Luca Signorelli and Fra Angelico
(Cortona).
Both the Arno and Tiber rise in these hills. On a green-topped hill between
them sits Caprese Michelangelo, crowned with a feudal castle. I walked into
the bar and asked the barmaid, aged about 12: 'Who is this Michelangelo?'
'I don't understand you.'
'You have a Michelangelo birthplace, a Michelangelo bar. Who is he? Some
politician?'
The child took a deep breath. 'He was no less than the greatest artist who
ever lived. If you could see his works, signore, you would say they were
done not by the hand of man but by the hand of God.'
He was born there by accident; he does not really belong to the local
pantheon. His mother was making her way to Rome when a thunderstorm
frightened the horses. The carriage overturned and she went into labour. The
Buonarotti family owned the local castello, so she stayed there until the
baby was born. In the 1920s the government started dignifying place-names
with the names of native celebrities - Sasso Marconi, Arqua Petrarca, Torre
del Lago Puccini. Caprese became Caprese Michelangelo.
The local hero, however, is not Michelangelo but Piero della Francesca, born
at Sansepolcro. His works are scattered over the countryside in churches,
cemetery chapels and dusty municipal halls. Often they are protected by
nothing more than a frayed rope and the jealous piety of villagers. When
Charles de Gaulle persuaded the mayor of Monterchi to lend Piero's Madonna
del Parto for a Paris exhibition, women lay in the road and refused to let
it go.
Sansepolcro has Piero's Resurrection, which Aldous Huxley considered the
finest painting in the world, but this artist's supreme legacy was the
series of frescoes which illustrates The Legend of the Cross at Arezzo, on
the walls of what looks like a disused barn but is really the old church of
San Francesco.
The Casentino and upper Tiber valley, popular with Italian weekend tourists
and art students, are not much penetrated by foreigners. A bungaloid rash,
and the quarries and new roads which disfigure the Pratomagno slopes, do not
encourage exploration. In 20 years this has become a different world, but a
few communities remain intact. The flagged lanes of Poppi; the perfect
defensive ring of Anghiari's walls; the whole town of Sansepolcro inside its
gates and the upper town of Arezzo haven't changed in seven centuries.
The stone sockets of town houses blossom with banners on days of
celebration. At weekends the crossbowmen and flag-jugglers sustain ancient
rivalries in explosive encounters; for the rest of the time the citizens
move serenely and aimlessly about - 'Like fish in an aquarium,' I suggested.
'Like characters in Piero's paintings,' said my guide.
Arezzo's hotels are cheaper and less sophisticated than those of Florence;
nevertheless, at the Minerva, Etrusco or Continentale you may pay up to
Pounds 60 a night. Sansepolcro's best, in a picturesque setting, is La
Balestra, about Pounds 40 a night. There are serious parking problems in
this town.
Most villages of the Casentino have adequate small hotels, sometimes
attached to gourmet restaurants, sometimes closed in winter. Notable among
them are Parc Hotel at Poppi (Pounds 40), Buca di Michelangelo at Caprese
(Pounds 26), Fonte della Galletta at Alpe Faggeto (Pounds 28), Oliver at
Anghiari (Pounds 36) and Croce di Savoia at Vallombrosa (Pounds 45). All
these places are in red Michelin.
For walkers and cyclists among the hills, almost every hamlet has its
locanda (private lodging house) at under Pounds 12 a night, including food.
All Casentino and Tiber valley localities have bus connections with Arezzo
and Sansepolcro, at least once a day.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- The Gallery:
   Abstracting Reality

<LP>
   New York -- In the fall of 1962, Robert Rauschenberg began
a series of paintings that combined silk-screened images of
photographs taken from newspapers and magazines with broadly
rendered abstract brushwork. During the next two years he
used this mixed technique for some 79 paintings, in which the
conflicting languages of photographic imagery and abstract
gestural painting are counterposed and balanced in a
remarkable way. In retrospect, these paintings seem to mark
an important point of transition between abstract
expressionism and pop art.
   Forty of these pictures are now on display at the Whitney
Museum of American art in "Robert Rauschenberg: The
Silkscreen Paintings, 1962-64," the first museum show given
to this body of work. I must admit that I went to see them
with certain misgivings. Although these pictures are
impressive when seen one at a time, their imagery tends to be
somewhat repetitious and I wondered whether a large number of
them could hold one's interest very long.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As it turns out, the silk-screen paintings hold up very
well when seen together. Rather than being merely redundant,
the repeated use of certain images and gestures creates a
provocative thematic framework and a pictorial world that is
at once easily accessible and intensely hermetic. Because
these paintings contain depictions of familiar things and
events, they initially seem to be organized around common
experiences and shared social values. But the more you look
at them, the more ambiguous they seem, and the more they
appear to be engaged in something like a deconstruction of
social and artistic norms.
   In this, and in their stylistic and structural
ambiguities, they anticipate the aesthetics of a good deal of
postmodernist painting, from Andy Warhol to David Salle. A
lot of the strength in these pictures comes from the
continual tension they set up between public and private
experience, between the familiar image and the unexpected
context.
   On the one hand there is something reassuring about the
familiar photos of buildings, sports events, famous people
and street signs. This sense of accessibility is reinforced
by images of easily recognizable contemporary events: a space
rocket blasting off, a new pope being elected in the majestic
setting of the Sistine Chapel, Roger Maris hot on the trail
of Babe Ruth's home-run record. Even the somewhat ominous
images of helicopters and armored vehicles, signs of the
growing U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia, are balanced by
pictures of the Statue of Liberty, American eagles,
flag-bedecked Boy Scout parades, and astronauts floating in
space.
   The early '60s were the best of times and the worst of
times, these images seem to suggest. But the elaborate
brushwork reminds you that these are not merely photo
montages, but paintings, and very expressively executed ones
at that. The Whitney's installation brings out the formal
richness of these pictures very nicely. It devotes the first
galleries exclusively to works in black and white. This not
only follows Mr. Rauschenberg's own progression from black
and white to color when he was making the pictures, but also
points up the stronger documentary emphasis of the monochrome
works.
   Later, when Mr. Rauschenberg begins to work with bold
swatches of bright color, his compositions become more
flamboyantly expressionistic. Throughout, the brushstrokes
seem to assert the artist's physical presence and to act as a
strong mediating force between the diverse events represented
in the silk-screen photos. This counterpoint between the
coolly objective and the intensely personal heightens our
consciousness of our own dual awareness of the world. Like
the artist, we find ourselves marveling at how many different
things there are going on all at once, with us right in the
middle of them all.
   Art with a capital "A" plays an important if ambiguous
role in many of these pictures. Images of Velazquez's svelte
"Rokeby Venus" keep popping up, along with parts of Rubens's
"Toilet of Venus," suggesting that maybe art and the subjects
of art are as much part of everyday life as street signs or
baseball players. Reinforcing these overt allusions to works
of art are numerous indirect references, some of them fraught
with subtle irony.
   In "Bait" (1963), an image of the Sistine Chapel
containing Michelangelo's scenes from Genesis is superimposed
on a photo of a construction site. In "Express" (1963), a
multiple-exposure photograph of a nude woman walking down an
incline evokes Marcel Duchamp's "Nude Descending a
Staircase." The paintings are also full of formal puns, the
painterly equivalents of wordplay. At the top of "Choke"
(1964), for example, a burst of dripping orange paint
cascades down against a "One Way" street sign that
insistently points in the opposite direction.
   Mr. Rauschenberg has sometimes been characterized as a
passive observer of the world around him, a man without ideas
guided purely by his intuition. This exhibition, I think,
gives the lie to that myth. When he made these paintings, Mr.
Rauschenberg seems to have been as involved in intellectual
sleight of hand as he was with manual dexterity. He was also
both clever and courageous enough to know when to stop. In
1964, after he had won the grand prize for painting at the
Venice Biennale, he telephoned a friend in New York and asked
that the more than 100 silk-screens he had used for these
paintings be destroyed, so that he could start with fresh
imagery when he got back. The exhibition, which is
accompanied by a fully illustrated catalog, will be on view
until March 17 and will not travel.

   A man with a knife slashed a painting by the 16th
century Italian artist Federico Baroccio at the National Gallery,
officials said. He was ordered today to stand trial on charges of
causing criminal damage.
   The state-funded gallery, home of some of the greatest art
treasures in Britain, said in a statement that the painting _ ``The
Madonna and Child with St. Joseph and the Infant Baptist'' _ was
cut in nine places in Wednesday's attack.
   Guards wrestled the knife from the assailant, identified as
Martin Came, 27. No hometown was provided.
   The National Gallery said its conservation and restoration
department will take ``maybe more than a year'' to repair the
painting, which measures 44 inches by 36 inches and is said to be
worth at least $1.6 million.
   ``At the moment, we believe that complete restoration will be
possible,'' said a gallery spokeswoman who refused to be identified.
   Came appeared at Bow Street Magistrates Court today on charges
of causing criminal damage and was ordered to stand trial Feb. 1
pending medical reports from a western England hospital where he
has undergone unspecified treatment.
   Baroccio, or Barocci as he is sometimes known, worked at the
same time as Michelangelo. Baroccio spent most of his time in the
Italian city of Urbino but the two men met in Rome in the 1550s and
Michelangelo encouraged the younger artist with his work.
   The damaged painting had been on display since it was bequeathed
to the gallery in 1831.
   Gallery experts refused to estimate its value. But a lesser
known work by the same artist sold for $209,160 at Christie's
auctioneers last year.
   Britain's domestic news agency, Press Association, said the
painting, has been valued at $1.6-4.8 million.
   But art critic Brian Sewell said the painting could fetch as
much as $25 million. Baroccio was ``monumentally influential in his
time ... and none of his work that is really authentic has come on
the market for donkey's years,'' he said.
   In 1987, a man with a shotgun blasted one of the gallery's
greatest treasures, Leonardo da Vinci's drawing The Virgin and
Child with St. Anne and St. John the Baptist, as it hung on show.
   The da Vinci drawing underwent an intricate 15-month restoration
and is now back on show. The gunman, Robert Cambridge, age 38 at
the time, was ordered to be held indefinitely at Broadmoor hospital
for the criminally insane when he appeared at London's Old Bailey
Central Criminal Court in June 1988.

The Art of Florence" is an extraordinarily handsome book, full of superb color 
plates taken especially for this publication, printed on fine, heavy paper, 
well bound and boxed. However, this is emphatically not a book intended to be 
seen only. "The Art of Florence" has a major text of impeccable and 
up-to-the-minute scholarship and, happily enough, it is written with great 
clarity and a minimum use of technical terminology. The text is not only full 
of information, but a joy to read. Its analyses of the various works of art are 
full of insights and comparisons that make it clear why Florence was in the 
forefront of the Renaissance. For anyone who loves Florence, Renaissance art 
and architecture, or fine book making, this work is worth every penny of its 
somewhat formidable price. 
</P>
<P>
The way the book is set up is particularly interesting and valuable. It is 
divided into sections historically, usually about a generation in length, 
opening in each case with a lucid account of the history of Florence for that 
period, stressing the political, social and economic events that play a major 
role in the patronage of art in that period. This is followed in each case by 
separate accounts of the architecture, sculpture and painting done in that 
period. It is a system that allows one to follow very clearly not only the way 
in which the arts are related to the history but also the ways in which they 
influence each other in a given period. In the cases of long-lived artists, 
their works may appear in two sections, a division that helps us to understand 
their development and stylistic changes. Since Florence was fairly small by our 
standards, with a population of under 100,000 through most of the period 
covered, the interplay between the arts and the constant awareness of exactly 
what was being done were particularly intense. 
</P>
<P>
This is a fresh approach. So many books deal with only one of the arts or only 
one artist that it is easy to lose sight of this rich and exciting interplay 
and particularly to lose sight of how all of it is constantly influenced by the 
events of the time. 
</P>
<P>
For anyone interested in cultural and intellectual history this book is a must. 
It gives an extraordinary immediacy to the particular climate in Florence that 
made it the artistic leader for all of Europe. Though three authors are 
involved, writing on their individual specialties, the tone of the book is 
remarkably uniform, arguing that they worked closely together and share similar 
points of view. 
</P>
<P>
The book restricts itself to dealing only with artists who are Florentine, or 
in a few cases who lived for some years in Florence, and only to those works by 
them that are now in Florence, so the concentration is always on the city and 
what can be seen there. There are, of course, references to other works, but 
they are minimal. For example, Michelangelo as a painter is discussed in terms 
of the Doni Madonna, the only painting by him in Florence. His work in the 
Sistine Chapel is mentioned, but only just. What is surprising and fascinating 
is how fully most of the artists can be discussed within those restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
The period covered extends from the 13th Century to the beginning of the 17th, 
the period in which Florence is at its peak artistically and politically. The 
last monument it discusses is, fittingly enough, the massive, oppressively and 
richly gloomy Burial Chapel of the Medici Grand Dukes, begun at the beginning 
of the 17th Century and only completed in the 19th. Florence did not, of 
course, die with the Medici; but its days of unique creativity did, at least in 
the arts covered in this work. Within that long period, all of the major 
artists and architects are discussed in full detail with one rather odd 
exception: Piero di Cosimo is never mentioned at all, though there are enough 
works by that strange and rather enigmatic painter still in Florence to make it 
possible to have included him. Still, if that is the only oversight, the flaw 
is a small one in a book that covers so much so brilliantly. 
</P>
<P>
There is a particular nicety in the production of the book that deserves 
special mention. The stunning color plates are gathered in groups scattered 
through the two volumes; but small black-and-white pictures of the works being 
analyzed appear in the margins of the text where they are discussed. The reader 
can follow very precisely what is being said and can then turn to the color 
plate for a fuller view, a system that is a boon and a delight to the reader. 
</P>
<P>
Works such as the painted interior of the dome of the cathedral of Florence 
were specially lit to be photographed for this work, which allows one to see 
what is there in a way you will never manage on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
I think it is only fair to add that the two volumes are among the heaviest I 
can think of. This is not a book to be read happily in bed, or even trying to 
hold on your lap. It has to be put on a desk or a very sturdy table in order to 
be read. A small robot to carry it around, say a cousin of R2D2, would have 
been a useful and happy addition to the package deal.

POWER, THE NEWPORT BEACH ARTS COMMISSION, CENSORSHIP AND THE FULL NAKEDNESS OF 
ADAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I recently have witnessed a most brazen and benighted abuse of official power 
in the censorship of artworks by the Newport Beach Arts Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Rosa Williamson, an artist and resident of Orange County, was invited by the 
commission to exhibit more than a dozen of her works (along with those of two 
other artists) at the Newport Beach City Hall Gallery. She duly delivered her 
pieces (for) exhibit from April 5 through May 2. (Then,) on receiving an 
anonymous complaint and viewing a paper sticker placed over one of Ms. 
Williamson's paintings, the commission decided to remove several of her works 
from the main showroom. 
</P>
<P>
The painting under review is a figure of a naked Adam, and it reminds me of 
another naked Adam on public view -- on (the) Sistine (Chapel) ceiling, by 
Michelangelo. If Pope Julius II saw fit to have that Adam unchanged and 
unclothed, with genitalia open to view, it behooves the shaking and quaking 
Newport Beach Arts Commission to take a more enlightened aesthetic view and 
restore these works to the viewing public, and have an end to this regressive 
act of censorship.

<LEADPARA>  City officials brought the most talented graffiti artists in Los Angeles to a
Hollywood studio last month for a demonstration they hoped would gain
community backing for a program to encourage spray-can Picassos.;   The city
cultural affairs department had hoped to prove to civic leaders and
community-based graffiti abatement programs that graffiti art can be
beautiful, and that a youth program to support the craft could help steer
teen-agers away from crime and drugs.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But as the Raleigh Studios sound stage filled with paint fumes, and 1,000
youthful graffiti fans cheered on their favorite artists, a handful of avowed
graffiti fighters in the audience saw that -- to their horror -- the city
actually was contemplating funding a program to help their enemies.;   "I
think it's wrong, absolutely wrong," said Hannah Dyke, president and
co-founder of Sylmar Graffiti Busters. Sylmar is an area of Los Angeles.;  
"To me, that would do nothing more than perpetuate the problem," Dyke said.
"Every artist who came to see it also added their 'tagging' in the area.;  
"The entire area for miles around ended up becoming a tagging trail of who
came to see the artwork.";   City officials acknowledge it will be a battle to
win approval for a graffiti-art program because it touches on such sensitive
issues as cultural and generational differences, the question of property
rights vs. freedom of expression, and the connection between graffiti and gang
violence.;   "One of the things we've been saying to all of the anti-graffiti
folks is that their approach has got to be a little bit more holistic," said
Al Nodal, general manager of the cultural affairs department.;   "A few years
ago, we thought all we would have to do is give everybody some beige paint and
we would get rid of graffiti," Nodal said. "To be smart about graffiti, we
can't just say it's all bad.;   "We need to identify the parts that are bad
and get rid of that, and identify those parts that are good and try to help
some kids out.";   The concept of encouraging good street art and providing
sites for it to take place legally is one that many members of the city's
artistic community support.;   The artists say graffiti can be art without
being vandalism.;   "We all dislike tagging and vandalism," said Diane
Alexander, a Los Angeles fiction writer who founded a street art support group
called the Graffiti Coalition. "But all they do is try to arrest the guys or
buff out what's on the wall -- the tagging. It's not working. The tagging is
exploding.;   "So I think that it's more than time that we tried an
alternative.";   Some Los Angeles homeowners say any attempt to glorify
graffiti as art threatens their neighborhoods. Graffiti, no matter how well
painted, is vandalism by definition, they said.;   "If Michelangelo had broken
into the Sistine Chapel and sprayed the ceiling, that's graffiti, that's not
art," said Gerald A. Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino.;   Graffiti
has developed from the turf marking and public threats of the street gangs, to
the tagging of rebellious youth, to "piecing," in which crews of spray-can
painters "throw up" their masterpieces on the wall.  </TEXT>

SEASON OF GIANTS: Part 1, 5 and 7 p.m.; Sunday; Part 2, 5 and 7 p.m. Monday,
TNT (cable);  A RARELY seen version of Sherlock Holmes' most popular
adventure, starring TV's "Dr. Who" as the famed sleuth; an original family
film about an alienated high school girl who just might be an alien; and an
epic miniseries about Michelangelo, Raphael and Leonardo from the man who gave
us "Shogun" -- they're all part of a TV weekend devoted to the unusual.;   
Holmes hounds, enjoy;  First up -- and easiest to take -- is "The Hound of the
Baskervilles," which San Jose's KTEH (Ch. 54) has dusted off to replace its
usual "Mystery Night" lineup as a special event for the station's pledge
period.;    This handsome edition of Conan Doyle's "Hound," filmed on the
story's actual Dartmoor locations, isn't new, but hardly anyone else shows it
these days. So it may seem like a discovery to fans of the station's "Dr. Who"
serial who've never seen its star, Tom Baker, play anything else. Baker's
Holmes is excellent.;    There's a good reason why "Hound" has been filmed so
often: It has everything -- gloomy moors, a quicksand "mire," an escaped
convict, a fake Holmes, a mystery man, an eccentric recluse, whispered
warnings and, of course, the savage "hound of hell"!;    Divided into four
half-hour episodes, this "Hound" is less frightening than interesting, but it
does give Dr. Watson (Terence Rigby) one of his toughest solo assignments, and
it offers Holmes a chance to fool everybody -- including us.;    Strictly from
Mars;  In contrast, the only people fooled by the Family Channel's "The Girl
from Mars" were the people who put up the money to make this well-intentioned
but stupid cable movie.;    At first, it seemed like an interesting concept: A
bookish, unpopular high school girl (Sarah Sawatsky) is so traumatized by the
death of her mother that she escapes into a favorite fantasy and actually
begins to believe she's from Mars.;    The program also offers a rare
opportunity to watch veteran actor Eddie Albert, who plays a kooky scientist,
working alongside his real-life son, Edward Albert, who plays the girl's
widowed father. But the story veers off in an infantile direction and leaves
them both looking rather embarrassed.;    What might have been an interesting
commentary on an alienated youngster turns increasingly silly with each new
"special power" young DeeDee (Sawatsky) reveals. By the time the troubled girl
shaves her head to make it easier "to peel off my skin," all poignancy is
plundered.;    Maybe kids will enjoy this -- mutant kids, that is, with
dehydrated taste buds.;    Spaghetti 'Lives of the Artists';  Quite another
story is TNT's two-part spectacle of late 15th-century Italy, "A Season of
Giants." This miniseries is sort of the All-Star Game for Renaissance artists
or, if you prefer, a spaghetti remake of "The Agony and the Ecstasy" with a
little Leonardo on the side.;    Like most Italian-made TV shows, this one
looks great but sounds as if it were recorded in the BART tube by drunken
language students.;    Still, it has many effective moments, especially the
one in which Leonardo da Vinci gets ticked off at the pretty girl modeling for
his "Mona Lisa" because she moves just when he's getting the smile right. "A
few moments ago, she was truly beautiful," he fumes. "Now that moment has
fled.";    The miniseries, directed by American Jerry London, who made
"Shogun," is about the rise to fame of Michelangelo (Mark Frankel) in a time
of perhaps the greatest artistic ferment the world has ever witnessed. His
rivalry with Leonardo (John Glover) and his influence on the young Raphael
(Andrea Prodan) are examined. And the final part of the film deals with
Michelangelo's testy relationship with Pope Julius II (F. Murray Abraham), who
forces him to tackle his greatest achievement, the Sistine ceiling.;    I'm
sorry to say this is all rather hard to follow, and the drama ends abruptly
with a peculiar sequence suggesting Michelangelo did it all to win the respect
of his highly critical father.;    Yet "A Season of Giants" is very impressive
when it shows us "behind the scenes" glimpses of the making of great art, such
as Michelangelo's creation of his towering "David.";    There's precious
little action, though, and what romance there is comes off as gratuitous,
especially the scene where the glamorous Onoria (Ornella Muti) shows her
breasts to Michelangelo as "a gift" for his genius.;    The miniseries
presents Michelangelo as rather mean-spirited. However, he meets his match in
Pope Julius, who wants to "fill his papacy with the din of deeds" and refuses
to let Michelangelo back out of the job that will take the rest of his life.; 
  Young Mark Frankel, the British newcomer who made such a vivid impression as
the lover of Catherine the Great in TNT's "Young Catherine," is a superb
Michelangelo. Glover's Leonardo is a nice change of pace for the actor who
usually plays heels, villains or losers. Abraham, the Oscar-winner for
"Amadeus," is excellent in a role that seems too brief.;    But, even though
"A Season of Giants" has many merits, it's still like a long train ride: It
may take you where you want to go, but you'll have to guard against falling
asleep along the way.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  A lavishly illustrated book on the restored Sistine Chapel ceiling goes on
sale this week at the suggested retail price of $1,000, making it the most

<HEADLINE>  $1,000 SISTINE CHAPEL BOOK MAKES PUBLISHING HISTORY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Alfred A. Knopf, a division of Random House, has printed 2,500 copies of
the two-volume tome, which features detailed color photographs of
Michelangelo's frescoes minus centuries of grime and varnish.;   "That's a
large number to try to sell because . . . well, because $1,000 is a lot of
money to spend on a book!" said John Brancati, vice president of merchandising
for Rizzoli, which has ordered 75 copies for its nine bookstores.;   A few
books have been more expensive than "The Sistine Chapel" but all were printed
in small numbers and sold to bookstores at a small discount and on a no-return
basis. Stores typically ordered such books for specific buyers only.;   Knopf
is selling "The Sistine Chapel" as a trade book; it gives stores a big
discount -- 40 percent off, or $600 -- and promises to buy back unsold
copies.;   The publisher also is aggressively marketing the book. At the
American Booksellers Association Convention in June it set up a 10-by-20-foot
replica of the chapel that was papered with photos from the book.;   Knopf is
betting that the book will transcend the art library-and-collector market and
appeal to the mall shopper.;   "It's a big commitment on their part," Brancati
said. "They're running a risk."  </TEXT>

Vatican to Celebrate Sistine Restoration: The Vatican plans an exhibition, an 
international symposium and books to mark the completion of the restoration of 
Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling frescoes. The Vatican said Thursday that 
an exhibition will open March 25, marking the end of a 10-year project that 
cleaned and restored the Renaissance artist's 16th-Century masterpieces. The 
cleaning of the Sistine has been one of the most ambitious and significant art 
restoration projects in history. CLAUDIA PUIG

When Michelangelo had finished his Last Judgment fresco in the Sistine Chapel, 
certain Vatican art experts were disturbed by all those nudes with their 
privates visible from anywhere in the room. Full frontal nudity was just a 
little too racy for Counter-Reformation sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
The authorities got the painter's student and friend, Daniele da Volterra, to 
paint little curls of cloth over the offending parts of the figures, much to 
the relief of the moral arbiters of the Church. Immediately upon completion of 
his thankless project, Daniele was dubbed by local wags "the Diaper Maker," a 
name that has stuck to this day.

Leafing through the May 13 Book Review, one discovers an illustration by

Here hunches the poor, wet Japanese scholar before Francois Rude's "La 
Marseillaise." In the original relief, standing among a clutch of hairy Gauls, 
is the personification of the youth of France clad in a bundt-cake mold, a 
length of rope and his socks. 
</P>
<P>
As he is presented by M. Rude, there's not much question about the gender of 
this very physical spirit. The boy in Danziger's drawing, however, wears an 
ABD-pack wrapped around his right quadriceps/femur, which hides the source of 
any possible Mother's Day embarrassment to Times readers. Thanks to Danziger 
and The Times Curia for protecting us from the awful truth.

INSTALLATION ART text by Michael Archer Thames and Hudson Pounds 28, 208
page
Turning these pages is to experience the tedium of scanning catalogues of
light fittings and office furniture, lift cages, sound-baffling materials
and air conditioning ducts. If this book is intended to excite our interest,
engage our sympathy, or at the very least to enter into reasonable
intellectual debate with those who find the installation risible as an art
form, then it is utterly defeated by the mannerisms and affectations of
design.
The brief introduction offers little enlightenment, its notions of hybrid
discipline, the questioning of autonomous art forms, the crossing of
frontiers, the activation of space, the specific influence of local sites,
are already commonplace in criticism and excuse - we all already know that a
bold band of critics believes and preaches that painting has descended from
the wall, that sculpture has stepped from the podium, that art is now
anything anywhere if anyone says so, and that Everyman is now an artist if
he thinks he is.
The text avoids the pitfalls of definition by declaring that the book's
compilers do not wish to confine the subject so, but only to set out 'a
series of markers', and only by the weary turning of pages do we learn that
anything from grand pianos, billiard tables and the racing car, to empty
rooms, shafts of light and the discarded jockstrap are now the stuff of art.
The Happening, that tiresome business of the late 1960s, of which the young
man who knelt in Grosvenor Square to shoot an imaginary arrow from an
imaginary bow at the eagle atop the American Embassy is an example, is (or
was), we learn, art as a process, not as an object - it was, it seems, more
important that Michelangelo should spend four years with a crick in his neck
and paint in his mouth, than that he should have left posterity the Sistine
Ceiling. Installation, we learn (and here; by chance, we have a definition
of sorts), is 'a method of art production', justified by Duchamp,
Schwitters, Dada and Surrealism, the development from Schwitters' pretty
little Merzbau (a thing of fairy tale fantasy) to the vast assemblages of
last year's forgotten art school graduates, seen as a match for the rise of
the Italian Renaissance from Masaccio's Brancacci Chapel frescoes to the
Sistine Ceiling.
The trouble with installation is that so little of it is by any stretch of
the imagination beautiful, and little of it now, post-Dada, post-Surrealism,
stretches the imagination, for we have become inured to shock and the
frisson of dismay. The vast enlargement of a tonguing kiss is merely a
trifle nasty, the functionless machine an old familiar, the inconsequential
conjunction of even the rolls of felt and grand piano of Joseph Beuys
already too homespun to be noticed.
Too many installations make the same demands as advertisements on hoardings,
and we close our eyes; too many have less to do with the arts of painting
and sculpture than with the illusions of the set for theatre, ballet, opera
and window dressing, television and the computer game - Indonesian shadow
puppets seem a prime influence. Some depend on sexual imagery, others on the
visual pun (excavating machines stationed in the forecourt of the British
Museum, for example), or on the sheer scale and number of the elements
involved, or on the contrast of hallowed setting and unhallowed, even
mischievous, intervention. Some incorporate printed texts for ready
exegesis, others consist only and entirely of printed texts of Sybilline
obscurity.
On the rare occasions when beauty plays a part, it is the beauty of material
and natural accident - a flooded crypt, a shaft of sunlight, the broken
stones of Richard Long's arrangements - all beautiful without an artist
there to tell us so; and sometimes it is the beauty touched on by the
discreet interior decorator - matters of placing and proportion, texture and
tone - but these can be seen a-plenty in the pages of The World of
Interiors, unblemished by the fumbling, bumbling and pretension of the
self-proclaimed installation artist.
This wretched book performs two unintended functions - it offers all the
assistance of an old-fashioned 'How to . . . ' book, so that we may make our
own installations from the detritus of the household - potato peelings and a
used condom, for example, should intrigue one's visitors  - and it reveals
the business to be, with rare exceptions in which political allusion or
autobiography play their part (usually with artists who have traditional
skills) - a shallow fraud.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Arts: A Pre-Raphaelite abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMONG casualties in the great shift against Victorian taste early this
century, Burne-Jones was a spectacular artistic victim. 'Love and the
Pilgrim', now in the Tate Gallery, sold for Pounds 5,775 in 1898, Pounds 210
in 1933 and was bought in at Christie's in 1942 for Pounds 21. Yet when the
English tide was already turning against him in the 1900s, Burne-Jones was
still lauded in Europe. Of the Victorian painters, he set himself most apart
from the naturalistic school, and his symbolic forms and sometimes
near-abstract motifs appealed first to French and Belgian symbolists, then
to European art nouveau designers, and later had an important effect on
Picasso and Kandinsky. His biggest literary fan was Proust, whose characters
in Jean Santeuil plastered their walls with Burne-Jones reproductions.
It is the European connection that the British Council celebrates in its
touring exhibition of the artist's drawings, the first solo Burne-Jones show
ever seen outside the UK. It opened in Nantes to coincide with a Burne-Jones
acquisition; at Charleroi, outside Brussels, it emphasised the symbolist
links with comparisons of drawings by Burne-Jones and Belgian symbolist
Fernand Khnopff; and at Nancy, art nouveau capital of France, where the show
has just arrived, it trumpets the influence on art nouveau architecture and
interior design.
Like many Victorians, Burne-Jones reacted against his times. 'Then science
became materialist, and then I painted angels,' he said. But while artists
such as Leighton escaped into paradisical fictions, Burne-Jones depicted
contemporary conflicts in symbolic language. His mythological figures are
desperate, contorted creatures; in the drawings they are running, fleeing,
cowering in terror. In an Aenead illustration, shipwrecked women, bodies,
legs, gowns, hair hurtle across each other in panic. In the Merlin studies,
the convoluted, swirling movement of robes and drapes conveys the agony of
the half-drawn bodies beneath. Repeatedly, in sketches of Dido, of Chaucer's
heroines, figures twist away, heads turn from the viewer, looking down, out
of the picture; one is blindfold.
Where there counterparts in oil remain remote, ethereal, the pencil and
chalk portraits are intimate, suggestive of personality, tenderness. In one,
Burne-Jones mistress Marie Zambaco as Chaucer's Phyllis, swerves from our
glance in a deliberately distancing pose even as her elusive melancholy
tempts us back. The head of the pilgrim in a study for 'Love and the
Pilgrim' has fleshy androgynous features, the averted eye wide open and
confused. The inner mood is hinted at; here is a human type rather than the
black-clad allegory in the painting. Khnopff, who sought to paint the
'invisible' admired above all Burne-Jones precise expression of myth and
sentiment.
The most potent drawings date from the 1870s when Burne-Jones developed the
'quattrocento' style of highly wrought, multi-toned pencil works such as the
studies for Merlin and the Mirror of Venus here. Several display his
obsession with Renaissance hairstyles, locks tensely plaited, twisted,
swathed about the head, which he copied from Leonardo and Michelangelo. (He
once took opera glasses to the Sistine Chapel, 'folded his railway rug
thickly, and lying down on his back, read the ceiling from beginning to
end.')
By the 1890s, the lines are broader, there is a new softness in the head
studies, especially those in red chalk. One of the plums at Charleroi is a
dreamy late 'Study of a Woman' from a private collection, inscribed to
Khnopff, shown alongside Khnopff's similar 'Study of a Sphinx' dedicated to
Burne-Jones.
Khnopff called himself a 'co-reveur des pre-Raphaelites anglais'. This show
casts a doubly illuminating focus on Burne-Jones. A spotlight on the
drawings, more stylised and decorative, less dynamic, than the paintings,
goes to the heart of the artist's aims and vision, giving a closer insight
into his personality. Second, seeing the drawings in a foreign context in
which they were influential, raises questions about the Victorian role in
European art history and suggests that had Burne-Jones and the
pre-Raphaelites been appreciated at home early this century, rather than
seen as an aberration of the 19th century psyche, the British might have
more easily welcomed the European modern movement.
At the Musee des Beaux-arts, Nancy, October 20 to December 21.

   One after another, proud symbols of
cities and empires are disappearing from public view in Italy,
victims of pollution and discouraging testimony that restoration
can't rescue every monument and artwork.
   In Florence, the 15th-century gilded panels on the east entrance
to the Baptistry _ a door so beautiful Michelangelo thought it was
fit for paradise _ are destined for specially sealed glass chambers
inside a museum.
   Now blackened and devoured by automobile pollution, the 10
bronze panels were done over 23 years by Lorenzo Ghiberti before
his death in 1455 to depict the Creation and other Old Testament
stories. Today they are being delicately restored, one by one, to
much of their shining splendor.
   But since no known chemical coating can protect them from car
exhaust, the panels will be replaced in the door by copies; the
originals will end up inside the oxygen-less, humidity-controlled
chambers of the museum across from Florence's cathedral.
   Ghiberti's work, dear to Florentine hearts, has good company.
   Earlier this decade, the four gilded bronze horses on the facade
of St. Mark's Basilica in Venice were placed, after restoration,
inside the church, and their places outside were taken by copies.
   The statues outside Milan's cathedral also are going inside, and
Rome will not soon see its symbol back at the city hall square atop
Capitoline Hill: The 1,800-year-old gilded bronze statue of Emperor
Marcus Aurelius astride his noble horse, recently restored, is too
frail to withstand the pollution and vibration of Rome's relentless
traffic.
   Restoration has had some heady days in recent years. There have
been gala unveilings of Venetian canalside palaces, the emergence
of Michelangelo's bright colors during the cleaning of the Sistine
Chapel ceiling and the titilating discovery that Adam and Eve's fig
leaves were a cover-up added to Masaccio's fresco in a Florence
church.
   But less attention has gone to the sobering realization that,
despite the marriage of high technology to restoration, restorers
often watch helplessly as monuments crumble and others, like
Ghiberti's masterpiece, must be removed from their glorious
settings to survive.
   In its current state, ``technology is more suitable to
diagnosis'' than prevention of the decay, said Alessandra Melucco,
who directed restoration of the statue.
   And what do you do with a monument like the 65-foot-high Arch of
Settimius Severus, which isn't easily moved, along with its
spectacular setting in the Roman Forum?
   ``In a generation, we are losing an historical heritage of 2,000
years,'' said Roberto Nardi, an archaeologist and restorer who was
part of a team that restored one-half of the arch, one of Rome's
most badly damaged monuments.
   ``What took 2,000 years to erode, then took 50, now takes five
years.''
   Like some other restorers, Nardi said its time to rethink the
approach to restoration.
   In the case of the arch, restorers had to stop work because they
ran out of money from a special fund established by Parliament
earlier this decade. The restored half is more or less white, while
the untouched half is coffee brown with soot and grime.
   Nardi says they would have stopped anyway because they saw that
pollution was damaging the monument as fast as they cleaned it.
   ``In five, six, 10 years,'' said fellow restorer Luisa Barucci,
``it will be the same argument. The black crust (will return).
Italy always waits until these things are falling apart.''
   Restoration, said Nardi, should be resumed only when the state
begins a program of regular maintenance.
   ``We stopped work but maintenance didn't begin,'' he said.
   The arch was restored with a natural material, limestone
plaster, that lasts about five years. The temptation is to use
harsh, plastic resins that could last longer, but in some cases,
the coatings made it impossible for the stone to ``breathe'' and
the coatings themselves were difficult to remove without damaging
the monument.
   At a recent conference in Florence, experts called for more
chemical research specifically to aid restorers.
   Arnold Wolff, in charge of restoring the Cathedral of Cologne in
West Germany, projected slides that showed how in less than a
century, the face of a stone angel was disfigured by pollution.
   ``We desperately need a chemical agent to protect stone,'' he
said.
   Sponsored by ENI, Italy's state energy company, the conference
also discussed the role of private companies.
   Alitalia, for example, backed the cleanup of the angels on
Castel Sant'Angelo Bridge across the Tiber. Olivetti sponsored the
cleaning of Leonardo da Vinci's ``Last Supper,'' a restoration now
being criticized as too slow and perhaps faulty.
   Offers of private funding are difficult to dismiss in Italy,
where cultural projects occupy a miniscule slice of the
deficit-ridden national budjet.
   But Luis Monreal, director of the California-based Getty
Conservation Institute and a speaker at the conference, maintained
that ``the private sector is more project-oriented and doesn't have
an overall view.''
   Private donors often want to work only on the most famous works
or something that will capture public attention rather than on
works most in need of restoration, said Roberto Boddi, an art
conservator at Florence's Fortezza da Basso, one of Italy's leading
restoration centers.
   Adriano La Regina, Rome's superintendent of archaeology for the
past 12 years, said money is lacking for regular maintenance.
   He added in an interview at his office at the Forum that his
department asked for the equivalent of about $150 million last year
for a minimal, three-year plan of restoration and maintenance,
including the needs of museums.
   Parliament approved only $6.6 million.
   Nardi said his calculations indicate that it would cost about
$15,000 a year to maintain a major monument in Rome, about ``the
same cost of providing a car and driver to a deputy'' in Parliament.
   La Regina said the underlying problem is not money but pollution.
   ``We need severe laws, to be implemented very quickly: filters
on cars, abolition of harmful fuels and traffic bans,'' he said.

ART NEWS: OAKLAND MUSEUM EXHIBITION: A WHOLE NEW BALLGAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Art lovers who also find excitement in that national pastime -- the game of 
baseball -- can combine both interests by visiting "Diamonds Are Forever: 
Artists and Writers on Baseball," an exhibition combining both visual artworks 
and literature on the game, opening at the Oakland Museum on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition includes 112 paintings, drawings, prints, photographs and 
sculpture, and features works by artists including Claes Oldenburg, Raoul Dufy, 
Elaine de Kooning, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Alex Katz and Eric Fischl. 
Featured literary passages on baseball are by John Updike, Garrison Keillor, 
Phillip Roth, Bernard Malamud, Neil Simon and others. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an absolute commonality of experience in the life of the (artists and 
writers) represented in the exhibition," said Don Grant, the museum's head 
preparator and exhibition designer. "Baseball is a part of all of our 
experience, at least at one point in time. And I think that's one of the 
reasons for (the artists') doing these works -- to give a sense of importance 
to the game and to people's experiences at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Grant said another reason for the exhibition, which was organized by the New 
York State Museum in Albany, is to "illustrate the mythic or iconic quality of 
baseball as it's perceived in many people's eyes." 
</P>
<P>
One work that particularly illustrates that "mythic" quality, Grant said, is 
Michael Langenstein's "Play Ball." In a takeoff on Michelangelo's "Creation of 
Adam," Langenstein's post-card collage depicts Michelangelo's hand reaching up 
to the hand of God and passing him a baseball. The work illustrates the passing 
on of youth and innocence that can be accomplished through baseball, Grant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Other themes depicted in the art works, Grant said, include "archetypal 
conflict situations (in which) one person is poised against all the elements," 
and works that "speak to how one's image as a kid growing up is . . . formed in 
relation to other kids (by) comparing oneself through baseball." As an example 
of the latter, Grant cited "Boys at Bat," by Eric Fischl, which shows "an image 
of a naked ball player, an older boy, batting, and a younger boy looking on." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which is divided into five thematic sections -- The Place, The 
Equipment, The Players, The Action and Something Else, which involves less 
tangible elements such as childhood memories and the smells of spring -- runs 
through Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: Works of art by Los Angeles workers whose unions are affiliated with the 
Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, and three paintings by union 
guest artist Phyllis Diller go on view Monday at the City Hall Bridge Gallery, 
201 N. Main St. 
</P>
<P>
The "20th Annual Union Artist Exhibit" includes 115 pieces of painting, 
sculpture and photography. Works by union members and their children were 
entered in a juried competition that included the categories of amateur works, 
professional works, high school and college works, grade-school works, and 
works by undocumented workers who have applied for amnesty through the county 
labor federation's Labor/Immigration Project. 
</P>
<P>
According to the federation, the purpose of the show is to call attention to 
the "hidden" talents of working people. 
</P>
<P>

<HEAD>Evidence Assembled in Washington on Rome's Cathedral</HEAD>
<HEAD>By CARL HARTMAN</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The biggest show of Michelangelo drawings ever
exhibited in this country will give Americans a unique chance to
judge a major argument among art-lovers: did he design a round dome
for St. Peter's in Rome, or the taller dome St. Peter's now has,
like the U.S. Capitol?
   Originally the Capitol, built and rebuilt three centuries after
St. Peter's, had a round dome.
   The exhibit called ``Michelangelo: Draftsman@Architect'' opens
Sunday at the National Gallery of Art.
   One of the people who put it all together was Henry A. Millon,
dean of the museum's Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts.
He wrote in the catalogue that never, before this exhibition, has
so much of the evidence on St. Peter's dome been brought together.
   ``If you are an Anglo-American scholar or a German scholar, you
believe that Michelangelo in the period 1558-61 built the model
that he intended (for) St. Peter's..., a model with a hemispherical
inner and outer dome,'' he told a news conference.
   ``If you are (an) Italian or French (scholar) you believe that
after the model was finished in 1561 he changed his mind and
decided to elevate the outer dome, to the profile that it has
today.''
   The wooden model itself, 16.5 feet high and made under
Michelangelo's direction, is part of the exhibit. It has the same
elongated dome seen on the cathedral today.
   But some scholars believe the shape of both the model, and the
actual dome, was changed on the orders of Giacomo Della Porta, who
finished the dome after Michelangelo's death.
   Also on show is a pen-and-ink drawing attributed to a Frenchman,
Etienne Duperac, from the period between Michelangelo's death and
the completion of the dome. It says:
   ``This building, following the design of (Michelangelo)
Buonarotti, will be finished in this manner...''
   It depicts a round dome, not an elongated one.
   Another feature of the show is a newly-identified Michelangelo
drawing of the suicide of Cleopatra, never shown publicly before.
   Among the unusual pieces is a drawing in black chalk of the
torture of Tityus, a figure in Greek mythology who was punished by
having an enormous bird tear at his vitals. Michelangelo held the
drawing up to the light, traced it on the other side of the paper,
elimninated the bird, added a Roman soldier and presented the
result as a resurrected Christ.
   The show will be open in the gallery's West Building until Dec.
11. After that, the part of the show that consists mainly of figure
drawings will go to the Louvre in Paris.

GRAFFITI: LIKE '60S FLOWER POWER AND '70S PUNK, HIP-HOP IS BOPPING RIGHT INTO

Michelangelo had the Sistine Chapel. On this early Sunday morning, "Slick," a 
22-year-old graffiti artist from Baldwin Park, has the back wall of the Levitz 
furniture warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
He also has an aluminum ladder for those hard-to-reach spots, a plastic milk 
crate stuffed with cans of spray paint and an artistic vision. 
</P>
<P>
"The can is my brush," Slick says, standing knee-deep in weeds on a desolate 
strip of land between the Levitz warehouse and the Los Angeles River. "The wall 
is my easel and canvas." 
</P>
<P>
His latest work-in-progress is an enormous Superman in vivid reds, blues and 
flesh tones. Cape flying, Superman clutches a goofy-looking human figure with 
one hand while winding up for a punch (kazow!) with the other. 
</P>
<P>
But more than artistic expression is at stake here. 
</P>
<P>
Slick is warming up to challenge "Hex," another graffiti artist who has been up 
on Melrose Avenue, flaunting his talents by spray-painting a huge Batman. Slick 
has vowed to "take out" the archrival he calls "Hoax." This weekend, starting 
today, the two plan to battle for the title of graffiti king, dueling with cans 
of spray paint at this industrial site. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to make a Super-Slick, dedicated to dissing him, crushing his bat," 
Slick says. "Ever since he came to town he's been irritating me." 
</P>
<P>
Spray-painting a wall without permission is still illegal, of course. Those 
convicted face fines of up to $50,000 and a maximum prison term of one year. 
And property owners must clean up graffiti or face fines of up to $1,000 and a 
maximum jail term of six months. 
</P>
<P>
But some authorities are beginning to draw a sharp distinction between the 
growing number of "aerosol artists" who paint graffiti-inspired murals and the 
street gang members who write their names -- in a practice called "tagging" -- 
on everything from RTD buses to schoolyard walls. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing more and more of those big, nice-looking ones in 3-D and 
different colors. They're different from our gang graffiti," said Detective 
Robert Contreras, a member of the Los Angeles Police Department gang 
information section. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, public agencies and private firms are even considering setting 
aside wall space for the aerosol artists, providing they agree to pressure 
others to stop tagging -- which more sophisticated artists consider unsightly. 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma is that, although some authorities believe the young artists need a 
place to paint, "If they don't get permission, it's still against the law," 
Contreras warns. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the world of graffiti art. With one foot in the police station and 
the other in the art gallery, the phenomenon, which started in New York in the 
1970s, is hot today in Los Angeles, where the city's horizontal sprawl and 
abandoned industrial spaces provide countless opportunities to leave one's 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
It's all part of "hip-hop," a subculture that blends elements of rap music, 
skateboarding, underground dance clubs and graffiti art. In the past year, Los 
Angeles has become the acknowledged center of hip-hop. There is even "Ghetto 
Art," a publication that is subtitled "Los Angeles' Only Aerosol Newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
Aerosol artists say they are motivated by a desire to create, not destroy. 
Their crews -- groups that spray-paint together -- are highly organized, with 
their own codes and styles. Whereas a few admit to being current or former gang 
members, most see graffiti as a positive way to channel pent-up energy. 
</P>
<P>
"We make a real point of saying we're not affiliated with any gang," says 
"Frame," a friend of Slick, who sometimes "bombs" -- paints -- with him. Frame 
says up to 90% of the estimated 500 or more local graffiti artists are just 
creative kids. 
</P>
<P>
The police, however, say up to 80% of the city's graffiti are still scrawled by 
gang members and delinquents. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever its motives, hip-hop, like '60s flower power and '70s punk, is bopping 
right into the mainstream culture. Its influence has already seeped into 
fashion, design, film, music, dance and billboard advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at some of the lettering used in advertising today, and you see it 
came directly from graffiti art," said Jim Prigoff, a self-styled graffiti 
expert whose book "Spray Can Art" has sold 55,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
If L.A. is the center of hip-hop, Slick is one of the key players. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, he and his partner "Risk" walked away with first prize at "Street 
'89," an International Street Art Festival held in East Yorkshire, England. The 
duo, who call themselves The Aerosolics, were asked by New York graffiti artist 
"Vulcan" to represent the United States. Their 20-by-6-foot mural beat out 
graffiti art from Denmark, Italy and nine other countries. 
</P>
<P>
The dynamic duo aren't given to modesty. "Risk rules the lettering, and no one 
can burn my characters," says Slick, whose given name is Richard Wyrgatscht. He 
stands more than six feet tall. His head is shaved, except for one long black 
strand that hangs down over his forehead. He keeps a large, black scorpion 
named Bertha. 
</P>
<P>
But far from being a gang member, Slick is a middle-class guy whose father is a 
policeman in Hawaii. His partner, Risk, lives in an upper middle-class Westside 
suburb. Graffiti art has definitely gone uptown since primitive man first 
scrawled on a cave wall. Today's subculture heroes, including The Aerosolics, 
come equipped with faxes, pagers and Day-Glo business cards to promote 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
What puts Slick ahead of the pack is his talent at " 'piecing" -- short for 
creating masterpieces. Unlike most other youths painting the town, Slick is a 
trained artist who could parlay his graffiti art into a career, say those 
familiar with his work. 
</P>
<P>
At Pasadena's Art Center College of Design, where he once studied illustration, 
Slick showed "tremendous potential," said Philip Hays, chairman of Art Center's 
illustration department. "The guy can draw beautifully in a traditional sense. 
He's a really good draftsman." 
</P>
<P>
Hays sees a parallel between Slick's work and that of Keith Haring, the New 
York East Village graffiti artist who spray-painted his way to fame in the 
1970s on the city's subways. Slick is part of the second generation, and his 
3-D figures have spawned a host of copycat artists, Hays said. 
</P>
<P>
Slick got his start in Hawaii, painting petroglyph-inspired figures while in 
high school. But after seeing "Wild Style," a movie about New York rap and 
graffiti artists, he traded in his paintbrush for a can and began to spray. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, he moved to Los Angeles to attend the Art Center. In between 
drawing Michelangelo-inspired nudes, he honed his cartoon characters on the 
walls of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He dropped out of Art Center in late 1989. Now, primarily supported by his 
parents and friends, he weighs whether he should go back. There are so many 
options. He hears that the Japanese might pay up to $4,000 for hand-painted 
leather jackets emblazoned with his characters. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike walls, which get painted over, jackets are permanent. And Slick is 
enough of an artist to be attracted to the idea of permanence. 
</P>
<P>
He won't even call his work graffiti. "We don't use the G word," Slick said 
solemnly. "That confuses people." 
</P>
<P>
And he is giving legitimate art galleries a try. 
</P>
<P>
His first big break came this fall, when the Pico House Galleria in downtown 
Los Angeles included one of his works in a graffiti art exhibition. Although 
Slick didn't sell anything, the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art for the 
first time signaled an interest in Los Angeles graffiti art when it picked up a 
work by an artist named "Mondoe," said museum spokeswoman Angela Escobar. 
</P>
<P>
But Slick worries about the future and that "there's so much negativity 
associated with a can." 
</P>
<P>
To squelch some of those bad feelings, Slick and his friends sometimes get 
permission now before they whip out their spray cans. 
</P>
<P>
On this recent Sunday, Slick and Frame had gotten the thumbs up from Levitz, 
which has long fought a losing battle with "the ugly kind of graffiti," said 
Anita Tellez, operations manager for the store, located on the Los 
Angeles-Glendale city line. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, we've been pretty pleased; they've put up some interesting artwork," 
Tellez said of the building's rear walls, which are covered with 'pieces and 
great big swirling 3-D names with characters or skylines sprouting from them. 
</P>
<P>
In between slugs from a bottle of mineral water, Slick wields his spray can 
like a paintbrush. His arm makes large arcs as he shades in five different 
colors to show Superman's muscle tone. A few more deft strokes and a torso 
emerges, twisted and tortured, reminiscent of the German Expressionism of Egon 
Schiele. 
</P>
<P>
Slick and Frame are putting up a message as well. In big, bold letters it says: 
"PLEASE RESPECT. NO TAGGING." 
</P>
<P>
Tagging "makes the rest of the neighborhood look all thrashed," Slick said, 
sounding for a moment like a peevish burgher. "Most property owners, they don't 
mind the mural art, but when kids write their names they get mad." 
</P>
<P>
Still, even artistic graffiti frequently is on the wrong side of the law. Many 
artists admit they steal their paint, which runs $4 a can over the counter. 
</P>
<P>
And not everybody draws distinctions between tagging and mural art. "It's all 
graffiti to us," says Detective Roger Mora, a spokesman for the Los Angeles 
Police Department. "If it goes up on a privately owned wall, it's going down." 
</P>
<P>
Graffiti artists concede that what they do is illegal. But they see themselves 
as outlaws, taking risks to make an artistic statement. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of graffiti art is getting up, getting fame in the most outrageous places 
possible, places that are illegal," Frame said. "Whether people accept it or 
not, to become kings on the street, to get fame, not with the media or the art 
world, but with the street, with our peers." 
</P>
<P>
But these young people also know that a dead end often lies at the bottom of a 
can of spray paint. Only one in a million of them will make it into the 
mainstream art world. 
</P>
<P>
"You should stay in school," one onlooker tells Slick. "Yeah," he responds. 
"Knowledge is king."

FT  10 JAN 92 / Arts: Drawn to conclusion - The cream of the Courtauld
collection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
According to the gospel that the best art is spontaneous and inspirational,
drawings should reveal artists at their most creative and the more swiftly
executed they are the better. Any subsequent polishing represents a watering
down and loss of the initial divine spark.
Drawing may indeed be the automatic writing of art, yet the first draft is
not invariably the last word. The sequence of 80 sheets on show at Somerset
House which represents the cream of the Courtauld collections, serves as a
reminder that drawings were also conceived as stepping stones in a process
leading to the creation of a fresco, panel, canvas or print. On occasion
they were deemed finished works of art in their own right. Here is abundant
evidence that drawings may be finished without being dry, polished but not
pedantic.
The sheets on view veer towards the highly finished and reflect the tastes -
as well as the generosity - of the Courtauld Institute's great benefactors.
All the early Netherlandish and Italian drawings - like the ethereal Hugo
van der Goes, the minimalist, almost Rembrandtesque Fra Bartolommeo
landscapes in pen and ink, Durer's Wise Virgin and an extraordinary Giovanni
Bellini - were bequeathed in 1978 by Count Antoine Seilern, along with the
Rubenses, Parmigianinos, the Tiepolos and Watteau.
Sir Robert Witt spent the more modest means at his disposal acquiring then
unfashionable Guercinos, and highly decorative 16th and 17th century
Northern landscapes. The short but spectacular run of English watercolours -
including JR Cozens's infinitely subtle view of the Castel Sant' Angelo -
came from William Wycliffe Spooner. Anthony Blunt gave Bernini's
unacceptably Baroque project for the east facade of the Louvre.
The Courtauld drawings, far less well known than their painted cousins, are
remarkable by any standard. This celebratory show was originally planned to
coincide with the opening of the new galleries in 1990, and to inaugurate
the Institute's first proper drawings gallery. That proved impossible, and
the show was postponed until this winter. Sadly the event seems to be
slipping by almost unnoticed; the gallery was forlorn and silent. It will
probably be another decade before these or any comparable selection of
masterpieces are shown again.
Immediately striking is how many artists are seen at their best.
Parmigianino's 'Conversion of St Paul' is exceptionally large and
elaborately wrought but also thrilling. The chaos and terror of the moment
as Saul falls from his horse blinded by heavenly light, is captured in
quick, nervous lines, and the drama heightened by the contrasts of brilliant
white bodycolour and sepia washes.
Guercino is represented by a study from everyday life of two girls drying
their hair by the fire; Piazzetta by characteristic large black chalk heads.
Tiepolo illustrates his inimitable verve and vitality in pen and ink and
wash; Turner his virtuoso watercolour technique with two grand English
landscapes.
These artists are justly admired but prolific. The collection is remarkable
for its rarities, the sheets from an earlier period when drawings were not
valued or collected and tended not to survive. Giovanni Bellini's Nativity
of the 1470s, carefully built up with a web of hatched strokes, for
instance, is one of only three or four pen and ink drawings by the artist.
He has endowed his Bethlehem with a skyline reminiscent of his native
Venice. Ox and ass kneel to worship the Christ Child and warm him with their
breath. Another handsome rarity is a compelling Holbeinesque portrait
drawing by Lorenzo Lotto.
Most celebrated of all the Courtauld drawings, however, is Michelangelo's
challenging allegory of 'The Dream of Human Life' which, like so many of his
presentation drawings, may have been given to his beloved Tommaso de'
Cavalieri. It has been described as one of the finest drawings in the world,
and as a technical miracle.
Such is Michelangelo's mastery that the sculptural central male nude seems
less to have been created out of black chalk than confected out of thin air.
Michelangelo chooses to bring to the fore and fully model Man, who leans
against a trumpeting angel. In the surrounding arc the ethereal vices seem
distant and dreamlike and as if carved in low relief. This is evidently not
a first draught, but it is the last word.
Master Drawings from the Courtauld Collections, sponsored by Toray
Industries, continues at Somerset House until January 19.

WEEKENDER: MOVING FAITH KEEPS THEM MOTIONLESS AS THEY BRING THE OLD MASTERS TO

They're among the world's most famous works of art, and it would take an 
international trip to see them all. 
</P>
<P>
But through the illusion of painting, costumes, makeup and lighting -- and the 
willingness of some 40 people to hold perfectly still -- works by the likes of 
Da Vinci, Vermeer, Michelangelo and Raphael will be in one place on the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula this weekend and next. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth annual Pageant of Our Lord, which opens tonight at the Rolling Hills 
Covenant Church, uses church members as live models to recreate 10 famous 
paintings or sculptures that touch on events in the life of Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
Between artworks, costumed actors portraying Lazarus -- the man Jesus raised 
from the dead -- and his sisters, Mary and Martha, recount their memories of 
Jesus. A 34-piece orchestra and a 120-voice choir provide a rich musical 
background, drawing extensively on Handel's "Messiah" but also including 
"Silent Night" and pieces especially composed for this year's pageant. 
</P>
<P>
"We do this as our unique way of presenting Easter," said David Halverson, 
minister of worship, music and drama at the church. "We started it because we 
thought it might attract people, and it did." 
</P>
<P>
The church, which has a 1,100-seat sanctuary, expects 6,000 people to see the 
pageant during its seven performances. It is open to everyone, not just church 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Though the artworks vary from year to year, Leonardo Da Vinci's "The Last 
Supper" is one of the most popular, according to Halverson and the pageant's 
artistic director, Rassie Harper. And one of the most spectacular is Thomas 
DeKeyser's "Crucifixion," in which three men are suspended 12 feet above the 
floor. This work comes complete with a crashing thunder-and-lightning effect. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, a retired Gardena firefighter, said the pageant is a form of worship 
for the volunteer church members who put it on. "It is a wonderful way to use 
the talent God gave me and in turn, giving glory to Him, a way of giving 
thanks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Bostelaar, who lives on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, has portrayed Mary 
for the last two years in the "Pieta," the serene marble sculpture by 
Michelangelo of the crucified Jesus and his mother. "Last year during the 
performance, I got such an overwhelming feeling of sadness that I started to 
cry," she said. "I know how Mary must have felt." 
</P>
<P>
Bostelaar said being in the pageant again this year was very important to her 
after a diagnosis of breast cancer last August, followed by a mastectomy and 
chemotherapy. "I thought that it might be the last year," she said, adding with 
a smile that everything "looks good" now. 
</P>
<P>
If the pageant is a deepening of faith for the church members who paint the 
artworks, model, work backstage and provide the music, getting the whole thing 
ready for the public can have its light moments. 
</P>
<P>
During a rehearsal this week, one of the disciples wore a Hobie sweat shirt, 
and the Prodigal Son sported a blue T-shirt that proclaimed Action Tools. And 
the "Crucifixion" painting was missing a key member: Jesus. It seems that the 
man portraying him was outside and missed his cue. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Ibscher of Lawndale, who plays Nicodemus in the reproduction of a 
16th-Century bronze plaque, recalls that when a painting of Christ calming the 
waters was portrayed last year, one of the men who played a disciple wore a 
skipper's hat. 
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old Pageant of the Masters in Laguna Beach was the model for this 
pageant, which strives to make every live work look identical to the original. 
In "The Last Supper," even the worn look of the fresco -- its cracks, chips and 
the doorway that was cut into it -- is captured. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, church artists have learned that even the great masters made 
mistakes about dimensions or deliberately distorted them. In "The Last Supper," 
Harper said, one of the disciples is extending a knife. But no one's arm could 
be that long, so the pageant model holds a stick attached to a foam-rubber hand 
and knife. 
</P>
<P>
Wood and cardboard are used to create depth, and stiff painted muslin serves as 
the backgrounds and clothing that cover the figures. In most instances, the 
live models fit themselves into the work by thrusting their heads or limbs 
through the background and blending into what has been painted. There are few 
full, costumed figures. 
</P>
<P>
Harper said lighting and makeup are key ingredients. The makeup, he said, "like 
painting . . . might change the mouth or make the cheekbone protruded or look 
sunken in." 
</P>
<P>
White body makeup and glycerin give the sheen of marble to the models in the 
"Pieta." It looks so real, Harper said, that "you'd expect the marble to crack 
if anybody moved." Gerald Faris

<LEADPARA>  Michelangelo's David, one of the world's most famous sculptures, was damaged
in a Florence museum Saturday when a man police described as deranged took a
hammer and broke off part of a toe, saying he had been ordered to do so by a
16th-century painter's model.;   Officials at the Galleria dell'Accademia
museum said the physical damage to the Renaissance masterpiece was reparable
since all the fragments from the shattered toe had been collected.  </LEADPARA>

HAMMER-WIELDER SAYS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     But museum Director Antonio Paolucci said: "The moral impact remains. The
world's most famous statue has been damaged.";   The 13-foot-high statue was
carved from a single block of marble between the years 1501 and 1504. While a
replica is displayed in a Florence square, the original -- attacked Saturday
-- is kept in the museum.;   "It is not possible to put every work of art in
Italy under bulletproof glass," said Francesco Sisinni, director general of
the Italian Culture Ministry. "But one cannot express the deep sorrow felt
because of the disfigurement of the most celebrated statue in the world.";  
As police officials recounted the incident, the statue's attacker, Piero
Cannata, 47, an unemployed Italian, hid a hammer under his jacket and entered
the museum, then struck at the statue, breaking the second toe of the left
foot.;   Patrons grab attacker; Other patrons of the museum subdued him until
the police arrived.;   The man said his action was part of a "story of spirits
connected to a 16th-century Venetian woman," according to the Italian news
agency ANSA.;   "It was Veronese's beautiful Nani who asked me to hit the
David," he was quoted as saying, apparently referring to a woman who often sat
as a model for Veronese, who died in 1588, 24 years after Michelangelo's
death.;   Police said the attacker had been charged with damage to Italy's
cultural patrimony.;   'I only hit it once'; "I only hit it once, and I hit it
gently because I didn't want chips to end up in any tourist's eyes," ANSA
quoted the attacker as saying. "Then I lay down and threw away the hammer
because I didn't want to risk being beaten by the people around me. To tell
the truth, I thought marble was much harder.";   It was not immediately clear
whether the sculpture would be withdrawn from public view.;   The last attack
on a Michelangelo work was in 1972, when a Hungarian-born geologist, Lazlo
Toth, took a hammer to La Pieta in St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City,
disfiguring the face of the Madonna and shattering the left arm.;   Toth was
ordered to an Italian mental institution, where he spent two years, and the
reconstructed Pieta is now shielded from visitors to St. Peter's behind a wall
of protective glass.  </TEXT>

   Are neon lights windows to the soul? Can
billboards evoke the Renaissance?
   Imagine shampoo ads hanging in the Louvre, newspaper headlines
in the National Gallery, television sets at the Metropolitan Museum
of Art.
   Advertising and Art. Soup cans and the Mona Lisa. Billboards and
Michelangelo. Cable and Cubists.
   Visual images _ magazines, television, film _ have forced
artists to acknowledge the enormous volume of information
transmitted each day and incorporate it in their work.
   From Nov. 9 through Feb. 18, the Whitney Museum of American Art
will present ``Image World: Art and Media Culture,'' a wide-ranging
exhibit of art and artifacts from the past 30 years, including
posters, magazine montages and a stamp machine.
   In a world where everything, even art, is for sale, ``Image
World'' shows how commerce can be turned into art. So get ready to
appreciate the aesthetic beauty of the five-day forecast, gaze at
lovingly drawn portraits of surveillance cameras and analyze
electronic transfers of Elvis.
   ``There's no way walking through the streets of New York one can
avoid this visual culture of these popular images,'' said John G.
Hanhardt, the Whitney curator who organized the show. ``You can't
even avoid television if you don't watch it. It influences the way
people dress, what they buy, how they talk.''
   In the last 300 years, has anyone made a greater impact on art
than Volney B. Palmer? Who? Why the founder of the first
advertising agency, of course, back in 1841. What about William
Henry Fox Talbot, who that same year patented the calotype, a paper
negative capable of producing multiple copies?
   And don't forget Earnest Elmo Colkins, who in 1890 promoted the
concept of art direction in advertisements, or Walter Dill Scott,
author of the 1908 book, ``The Psychology of Advertising,'' which
urged the incorporation of emotional and motivational techniques
into the selling of products.
   Starting in the late 1950s, Nam June Paik, Andy Warhol, James
Rosenquist, Roy Lichtenstein and other artists attacked the
onslaught of product and imagery, taking recognizable objects and
placing them within the structure of the art world. That meant
glossy portraits of cigarette ads, a television set coated in
cement or a lifesize porcelain sculpture of Michael Jackson and his
chimpanzee.
   ``The show kind of tracks that response,'' said guest curator
Marvin Heiferman. ``You get a Warhol and wonder if it's critical or
celebratory. You have a picture of an electric chair or Elvis
Presley. Is he the `King' or some tragic heroic figure? There's an
enthusiasm and brashness which you didn't see before.''
   Media began creeping into art around 1912 when Braque and
Picasso used newspaper bits in their Cubist collages. A few years
later, Marcel Duchamp began appropriating actual consumer objects,
such as a paint advertisement, into his art.
   The works of Berlin Dadaists John Heartfield and Raoul Hausmann
consisted entirely of images cut from newspapers and magazines.
Surrealist Salvador Dali directed segments of Hollywood movies,
appeared in commercial advertisements and created ``Dali's Dream
House'' specially for the 1939 World's Fair.
   Also in 1939, Hollywood's most artistic and productive year ever
headlined by ``Gone With the Wind,'' an essay by art critic Clement
Greenberg, ``Avant-garde and Kitsch,'' warned that synthetic art
had become ``an integral part of our productive system in a way in
which true culture could never be,'' and that its ``enormous
profits are a source of temptation to the avant-garde itself.''
   With the proliferation of television after World War II, cereal
and toothpaste were being beamed into millions of homes every day.
Philip Morris cigarettes were smoked on ``I Love Lucy,'' quality
theater was presented by General Electric and John Cameron Swayze
was host for the ``Camel News Caravan.''
   ``Pop Art'' was the response, an attempt to inject ``truth'' in
advertising. It was created, ironically, by artists who had once
worked in the advertising world. Warhol designed shoe posters;
Rosenquist painted billboards in Times Square.
   ``I was struck by the numbness I felt by painting images like
huge noses and huge eyes,'' Rosenquist recalled.
   ``Eyes three feet wide. Noses 10 feet long. Very large imagery.
I couldn't focus on the image although I was mixing the color
accurately. I made paintings where I placed objects in the picture
plane in different scales, and where the largest and closest image
would be the most difficult to identify.''
   Movies were big when Paik was growing up in Korea, and Shirley
Temple was the most famous person in his country in 1937. He saw
television for the first time in the early 1950s and was working on
electronic music a decade later in Cologne, West Germany, when the
``idiot box'' inspired a stroke of genius.
   ``I was at an impasse, a dead end,'' the artist recalled. ``So I
thought I would rather create electronic pictures than electronic
music. There were electronic music composers but no electronic
picture composers.
   ``I bought 13 old TV sets in Germany and changed the insides of
them. Then I showed them in German galleries and got a very big
reception.''
   Technology. It's everywhere, and Pop Artists consumed it. Thanks
to the portable movie camera, one didn't have to be a Hollywood
director to make movies. Thanks to the silkscreen, a picture could
be lifted off a newspaper and duplicated on canvas.
   Anything can now be turned into art: manhole covers, toilets,
subway signs. At the ``Image World'' exhibit, even the ticket booth
can't be trusted. Dennis Adams, best known for his designs of bus
shelters, has put together a special construction.
   ``It's the idea of a ticket booth, using images of homelessness
instead,'' he said. ``There are photographic images that create the
walls of the ticket booth _ large photographic images _ and you'll
be paying through the slot in the photograph.
   ``I love those structures. They bring capitalism to its most
basic level, a small window with money being exchanged.''
   With originals by Warhol and Rosenquist now worth millions of
dollars, Adams sees his work as returning to the very idea of Pop,
making art accessible to the public, using everyday objects and
presenting them in a different way.
   ``Very simply, my work deals with the idea of taking a
functional structure that everyone recognizes and using that as a
kind of instrument for getting to another agenda,'' Adams said.
``The functional element is just a kind of decoy, a way of making a
viewer feel comfortable.''
   In an age of jumbotrons, space shuttles and photo opportunities,
the possibilities for art are limitless. Rosenquist talked of
projects involving electronic nymphs in space and particles of
nuclear ashes.
   It may all seem, literally, a million miles away from the
Sistine Chapel, but Rosenquist insists art and communication have
always been linked.
   ``You go back to the gossip of the Renaissance paintings,'' he
said. ``Later on, printing started, and hand-in-hand with art,
communication changed.''

IN THE FACE OF HOUSE VOTE, MUSEUMS ARE PUZZLED BY UPROAR OVER EROTIC WORKS

In a display case in a room off the Inner Peristyle Garden at the J. Paul Getty 
Museum in Malibu, there is a small statue of a satyr, an ancient Greek 
half-man, half-beast figure that, when closely scrutinized, is obviously 
aroused. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, a vase from about 510 B.C. -- attributed to Euthymides, a contemporary 
of the famed Greek vase maker Euphronios -- is vividly illustrated with a scene 
depicting a couple engaged in what is clearly steamy foreplay. 
</P>
<P>
And in the next room, another vase, discreetly titled "Drunken Singing Reveler 
and His Young Attendant," shows a pretty-faced teen-age boy holding a pitcher 
into which his older male companion is urinating. 
</P>
<P>
Across town, at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, a tall, phallic structure 
by Robert Graham includes numerous explicit scenes of sexual intercourse. Two 
or three rooms away, a couple makes love in the back seat of a 1938 Dodge. 
</P>
<P>
In still another room, Jean-Simon Berthelemy's 1778 painting, "Death of a 
Gladiator," shows its subject complete with pubic hair. Philip Conisbee, the 
museum's curator of European painting and sculpture, points out that the work 
probably was completed by Berthelemy while he was in Rome, studying under a 
French government grant. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the '38 Dodge scene -- by Edward Kienholz, which caused a scandal 
over its content after it was completed in 1964 -- none of these anatomically 
explicit or sexually suggestive artworks has precipitated a single complaint by 
the millions of people who have viewed them in the last five years or so, the 
two museums say. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the Kienholz, said Pamela Jenkinson, public information officer at 
the county museum, "we haven't heard squat since we opened the building." 
</P>
<P>
Among curators at the Getty and at LACMA, this is a source of puzzlement. Why, 
when a single room at the Getty contains a dozen pieces of sexually explicit 
art, has similar subject matter in contemporary art caused such a fuss? Witness 
the ruckus surrounding the late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, whose 
homoerotic and sadomasochistic work -- except for its medium -- focuses on many 
of the same things the ancient Greeks did. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the single most controversial image in a disputed show of 
Mapplethorpe's work is a self-portrait in which he appears nude, with a 
bullwhip protruding from his buttocks in a fashion reminiscent of the bestial 
detail of Greek satyrs. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, then, it is Mapplethorpe -- whose work received partial 
federal financial support -- who has become such a large part of the arts 
funding crisis unfolding in Washington this week. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute, fomented by conservative congressmen, may reach a preliminary 
climax Wednesday with a budget vote in the House of Representatives that could 
strip millions of dollars from the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
After all, said Marion True, curator of antiquities at the Getty, 
homosexuality, explicit nudity and a variety of sex acts have been legitimately 
a part of artistic expression since at least Greek times. Tina Oldknow, 
associate curator of ancient and Islamic art at LACMA, agreed, noting that, 
while the Getty may have the explicit statue of the satyr on display, LACMA has 
in its collection a Greek vase that goes even further: It shows two satyrs -- 
masturbating. 
</P>
<P>
Little is known about the personal life styles of Greek artists, said True and 
Oldknow. At that time, said True, artists lacked the social stature they enjoy 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Chances are good, however, that Greek artists -- working in a society in which 
homosexuality, for instance, was accepted behavior -- were people not unlike 
Mapplethorpe. 
</P>
<P>
The battle against government support for controversial art has been led by 
Sens. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.) and Rep. Dick Armey 
(R-Tex.). With assistance from fundamentalist religious groups, the 
conservative congressmen have challenged the National Endowment for the Arts to 
devise ways to control subject matter to prevent funding of art that Armey has 
described as "blatantly offensive to the vast majority of the American people." 
</P>
<P>
The conservatives contend that the national endowment has no business financing 
art whose subject matter may be perceived as sacrilegious or pornographic. 
D'Amato and Armey have said they are not trying to limit artistic freedom of 
expression -- only to ensure that public money doesn't pay for anything the 
most conservative members of art's audience don't like. 
</P>
<P>
"If we take the representations of life that they (Greek artists) have left for 
us," said True, "one has to assume they were familiar with all kinds of things. 
Group sex was nothing new to the Greeks. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certainly representations of people being spanked with slippers and 
sandals. There are people with whips in their hands. I'm not suggesting they 
are equivalent (to Mapplethorpe's photographic images), but I don't think there 
is much that goes on in the contemporary world that would shock a Greek." 
</P>
<P>
"In Greek art, nudity shouldn't just be seen as nudity. It denotes something," 
said Oldknow. "It means as much about something as a person wearing clothes. It 
tells us a lot of things about the figure being represented. Ideal youths and 
their nudity is thought by some people to denote their spiritual excellence and 
their power in their physical perfection. 
</P>

"The ideal qualities of a male in the 6th Century B.C. would be that he would 
be athletically developed, physically powerful, courageous and honorable. So 
you would have the male figure nude. You don't have nude female figures because 
the ideal qualities were that they would wear fashionable clothes and be very 
demure." 
</P>
<P>
Two centuries later, said Oldknow, the direction of Greek art shifted enough so 
that the female nude is frequently seen. In that era, state support of art was 
virtually unknown, said True and Oldknow. Many vases, in particular, featuring 
the most explicit subject matter, were private commissions. "You would have 
dinner parties where men would gather together and drink and discuss things," 
said Oldknow. "Women who would accompany the men would be prostitutes, not 
their wives. It was also acceptable for a man to be married and have a male 
lover. It really wasn't an issue." 
</P>
<P>
The acceptability of such subject matter has gone through permutations over 
time. In the Victorian age, it became commonplace for a wide variety of nude 
sculptures, for instance, to be draped or for their genitals to be covered with 
fig leaves. Michelangelo's famed fresco on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in 
Rome, completed in 1512, has from time to time aroused controversy because it 
depicts garland-bearing nude youths. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1920s and '30s in the United States, said True, the racy subject matter 
of Greek vases became such an issue that some museums painted over the genitals 
of figures depicted on them. 
</P>
<P>
While the function of nudity and explicit sexual conduct in art has changed 
through history, True contended that the contemporary controversy is 
characteristic of cyclical clashes between fundamentalist religious beliefs and 
artistic freedom that have recurred over many centuries. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's predictable," she said. "I think the problem is that, whenever 
you have a very conservative period politically and socially -- which we have 
right now -- and great interest in fundamental religious ideals, people tend to 
impose them on other people. 
</P>
<P>
"(They seem to say), 'Not only do I not want this, but I don't want money going 
to support anybody else doing this.' It is one of the problems with art today." 
</P>
<P>
To True, such a climate demands courage from museum directors and others in the 
arts community, whose function in such cycles may well be to try to hold out 
against the running of the political tide. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that any museum that is receiving (government) funding should refuse 
to be intimidated by the threat that the funding is going to be taken away if 
government officials who are supporting the national endowment say they don't 
approve of the art," she said. 
</P>
<P>
If this week they don't approve of Mapplethorpe and photographer Andres 
Serrano, whose image of a crucifix immersed in urine also played a major role 
in the current controversy, she added, "next week they won't approve of 
Euphronios and Exekias and the Greeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We have explicit representations of couples copulating. Are we supposed to 
take them off exhibit because someone doesn't approve of them being on display? 
Thank you, I won't do it. When an institution is intimidated by that kind of 
thing, there's no way of defining the limits of it. It is not going to stop at 
modern art." 
</P>
<P>
At least indirectly, True was criticizing Washington's Corcoran Gallery of Art, 
which last month canceled a Mapplethorpe show due to open at the beginning of 
this month. In announcing the cancellation, the Corcoran said it was attempting 
to defuse the political controversy, but the decision itself caused such 
disagreement that the gallery succeeded in potentiating it. Subsequently, the 
Washington Project for the Arts, another private agency that receives national 
endowment support, announced that it would host the Mapplethorpe exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
To LACMA's Conisbee, the current crisis -- which observers of the national 
endowment say is the first in the agency's nearly 25 years of existence 
provoked by the visual arts -- has been intensified by the fact that 
photography is a medium unknown in any previous period of history. 
</P>
<P>
"We tend to associate photography with life," Conisbee said. "A photographer 
has as much control (over subject matter) as any sculptor or painter, but 
nevertheless, (photography) has a kind of immediacy or presence. It seems to us 
not to deal so much with the idea as painting and sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that, if you can imagine some of the Mapplethorpes done as paintings, 
it would take some of the immediacy away. You know that, in the photograph, 
you're seeing exactly what Mapplethorpe saw in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I find Mapplethorpe in a way not easy to look at. It takes you into a kind of 
sexual underworld. They are disturbing images." 
</P>
<P>
But having said that, Conisbee strides through a gallery at LACMA, stopping at 
Rodin's "Iris, Messenger of the Gods," executed in 1890 and 1891. It is a 
headless -- but otherwise anatomically explicit -- depiction of a woman, 
standing, legs spread, with one knee thrust into the air. 
</P>
<P>
"Rodin was deliberately playing the slightly sensational romantic artist's 
role," Conisbee said. "He knew perfectly well he was going to shock people. A 
lot of his work has a very autoerotic strain. There were drawings by him that 
were completely explicit. He also acted out the role with his models. He was 
famous for it." 
</P>
<P>
To George Goldner, curator of drawings and acting curator of paintings at the 
Getty, the history of art in terms of subject matter is a meandering stream of 
sorts. "Each period defines what is sexually explicit a little bit 
differently," he said. "There are periods when (sexual content) is rare, if 
existing at all . . . periods when religious sentiment was preeminent. In the 
15th Century, there were very few or no sexually explicit themes. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say that there has necessarily always been sexually explicit 
subject matter, but I think for hundreds of years, there has been. We tend 
probably today, in the 20th Century, to have more of that than was true in the 
16th Century. There are complicated reasons for that that have to do with the 
social role of an artist. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 16th Century, painting was an essential medium of communication. Today, 
artists are a bit more functionally out of the center of society, so there's a 
tendency for the people who practice it to be a bit more unconventionally, but 
I think one can easily exaggerate that. 
</P>
<P>
"Going back to the 16th Century, there were artists who were unconventional. 
There were homosexual artists in the Renaissance. There is no way of telling 
whether the proportion is greater or less now than it was then. 
</P>
<P>
"Mapplethorpe is more provocative than most artists have been. But we've all 
been numbed by provocation, so you have to go pretty far to provoke."
