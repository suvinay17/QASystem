NOTHING MUCH COOL ABOUT PHOENIX EXCEPT FOR ITS FEELING TOWARD NFL CARDINALS

<P>
There is a popular assumption that the honeymoon between the transplanted
football Cardinals and the people of Phoenix is over.
</P>
<P>
This is wrong. There never was a honeymoon in the first place.
</P>
<P>
When Cardinal owner Bill Bidwill brought his team from St. Louis before the
1988 season, it seemed that his first move was to alienate his new customers.
The Cardinals' price-gouging and general front-office ineptitude combined to
turn off fans before their imported heroes had played a game.
</P>
<P>
A year later, the animosity has died down somewhat, but the damage isn't close
to being repaired. Cardinal season-ticket sales have plunged 31% from 55,000 to
37,900, and a crowd of only 40,000 to 45,000 is expected Sunday for their home
opener against the Chargers.
</P>
<P>
Once it became obvious that an adversary relationship had been established,
Phoenix sports writers began bombarding Bidwill in print.
</P>
<P>
Joe Gilmartin, veteran columnist of the Phoenix Gazette, summed up the
situation with a remark after Bidwill underwent gall bladder surgery.
</P>
<P>
Wrote Gilmartin: "The bladder was removed, but the gall remained."
</P>
<P>
This wasn't the first time the Cardinals had packed their belongings and left
town. They were originally based in Chicago but, tired of playing second fiddle
to the immensely popular Bears, they moved to St. Louis after the 1959 season.
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals and Bears are the only surviving charter members of the National
Football League, which was founded in 1920 as the American Professional
Football Assn. Since the Bears began as the Decatur Staleys, the Cardinals are
the only team to carry the same nickname throughout the league's 70 seasons.
</P>
<P>
Still, tradition hasn't helped the Cardinals. Even after escaping the shadow of
the Bears, they failed to catch on in St. Louis. They drew only 23,336 per game
in their first season there, reached their all-time high at 48,084 in 1981 and
fell to 27,821 in 1987. Their largest crowd in 28 seasons at Busch Memorial
Stadium was 51,010 for the Rams in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Considering the franchise's long history of frustration, Bidwill might have
been expected to shower the folks of Phoenix with kindness. He finally had
found a city that was hungry for an NFL team, one with a stadium big enough for
him to turn a profit. The Cardinals arranged to play in Arizona State's Sun
Devil Stadium, which has a seating capacity of 72,000.
</P>
<P>
But all these positive factors did for Bidwill was lead to greed. He set up an
average ticket price of $38, the highest in the NFL by a whopping $12. When the
fans rebelled, they had to air their complaints by mail, because the Cardinals
didn't list their telephone number for three months.
</P>
<P>
Bidwill was even hindered by a ticket situation that was beyond his control.
Under a previous agreement with Arizona State, season-ticket holders of the
Arizona Outlaws of the defunct United States Football League had first call on
season tickets of any NFL team that would occupy Sun Devil Stadium. There were
only 15,000 of those, but ASU had 55,000 for college football, and they held
second priority.
</P>
<P>
The result was that any new Phoenix fans had to pay exorbitant prices for bad
seats.
</P>
<P>
"It was a public relations blunder of monumental proportions," Gilmartin said
in a phone conversation. "The Cardinals as much as said, 'If you can't afford
it, sorry. Just get your money out.'
</P>
<P>
"After the initial reaction, they compounded their mistake. They had an
opportunity to backtrack and roll back the prices. Sometimes you can turn a
negative into a positive. But they didn't budge, and matters only got worse.
</P>
<P>
"It was almost as though they called the people in the front office together
and said, 'Everybody likes us. How can we turn that around in an instant?' The
hostility was incredible."
</P>
<P>
In spite of all this, the Cardinals drew a franchise-record 472,937 fans last
year, a 59,117 average. They sold out one game, against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
The ticket scale has been restructured for the Cardinals' second season in
Phoenix, but the average price has dropped only to $36. Bidwill will more than
make up this meager difference with revenue from the stadium's 60 new luxury
boxes, which rent for $60,000 each per year. The Cardinals will get $2.4
million of the $3.6 million, ASU the remainder.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I've kind of praised the Cardinals lately," Gilmartin said. "I've
suggested that Bidwill may be the league's most improved owner. The team had a
good draft for a change, made some positive moves in the front office and
signed 11 Plan B free agents, including (quarterback) Gary Hogeboom.
</P>
<P>
"The trouble is, Bidwill had too much ground to make up."
</P>
<P>
Gilmartin added that the Cardinals face the handicap of sharing the stadium
with a college team that has made a habit of winning.
</P>
<P>
"The people here aren't bumpkins," Gilmartin said. "Having watched ASU over the
years, they believe a 10-1 record on up is OK."
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals have started out 2-1 but figure to finish under .500 in the tough
NFC East. They were 7-9 last year, and since then have lost quarterback Neil
Lomax with what may be a career-ending hip injury.
</P>
<P>
From the start, Bidwill has declined to discuss the controversy swirling around
him. Because he is inaccessible by phone, Terry Bledsoe, vice president of
communications, served as the Cardinals' spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we're concerned about the decrease in season tickets," Bledsoe
said. "We expected it to be down, but not this much. We've got to build it up,
but we've got to win to do it.
</P>
<P>
"There are any number of valid reasons for the problem, and part of it is
nothing more than the economy in Phoenix. By the year 2000, this will be the
seventh or eighth largest city in the country, but we're in a recession right
now. The housing market is in a bad slump."
</P>
<P>
The excuse used most often is the intense heat in Phoenix. There already have
been 125 days this year with the temperature above 100, and the heat wave isn't
over yet. Because of this, the NFL scheduled the Cardinals' first three games
away from home.
</P>
<P>
"We've had 90% (season-ticket) renewals on the shaded side of the stadium,"
Bledsoe said. "Virtually all the cancellations have been on the other side.
</P>
<P>
"Personally, though, I think the heat will be overcome when we win. The people
here are outside more than they are anywhere other than a place like San Diego.
If they're not at the game, they're playing golf or doing something else
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
"People live here because of the weather. They jog, ride bikes, things like
that. If they want to do it, they do it. People in Green Bay sit outside in
winter weather. You can say they're insane to do it, but they do it."
</P>
<P>
In case the Cardinals don't win often enough to beat the heat, one solution
being considered might be called outdoor air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
"It sprays fine mist around the stadium," Bledsoe said, "and the mist
evaporates as it descends, so the fans get cooled off without getting wet."
</P>
<P>
Playing at night would help, but the Cardinals can do that only when television
dictates, and that won't happen this year. The networks want winners on their
prime-time telecasts. Charger Coach Dan Henning suggested the other day that
the Cardinals start games at 4 p.m. instead of 1, but TV commitments make that
impossible.
</P>
<P>
"If we were in the East, we would have the option of playing at 1 or 4,"
Bledsoe said. "Here, we have to play at either 10 or 1, or 11 or 2 when the
rest of the country goes off daylight time. We're on standard time all-year
around.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we don't want to start games in the morning. One hope we have is
that ESPN may have 16 Sunday night games under the new TV contract next year
instead of eight. Maybe we could get a couple of early-season games on that
schedule."
</P>
<P>
In any case, the road ahead for Bidwill and the Cardinals will go uphill. Heat
or no heat, they have many fences to mend.
</P>
<P>
As Gilmartin put it, "When you start out by kicking people in the fannies and
then try to put those fannies in pews, you're tackling a tough task."

NFL LOSES, MUST PAY $5.5 MILLION TO USFL;
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: SUPREME COURT LETS STAND A RULING THAT THE LEAGUE MUST PAY LEGAL FEES
IN ANTITRUST SUIT.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court today refused to free the National Football League from
having to pay more than $5.5 million in legal fees to the defunct U.S. Football
League.
</P>
<P>
The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the NFL must reimburse the
USFL for attorney fees the failed league incurred in winning only $3 in a
much-publicized antitrust suit.
</P>
<P>
The USFL was formed in 1982 with 12 teams playing a spring-summer schedule. It
collapsed in 1984 after the owners decided to switch to a fall schedule, a move
that never materialized.
</P>
<P>
The USFL filed a $1.7-billion suit in 1984, accusing the NFL of federal
antitrust violations in its treatment of player contracts, television coverage,
stadium availability and other matters.
</P>
<P>
A jury found that the NFL deliberately acquired or maintained monopoly power
over major league professional football but ruled against the USFL on other
claims.
</P>
<P>
The jury awarded the USFL $1, and the presiding judge tripled that figure to $3
in accord with antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
The NFL claimed the lawsuit was an unsuccessful and unjust ploy to force a
merger with the established league.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals last October upheld the award of $5.53
million in lawyer fees to the USFL, which had sought more than $7.6 million to
pay its attorneys.
</P>
<P>
The appeals court said, "The jury found that the NFL's monopolization of the
United States major league professional football market injured the USFL. An
injury having been found, the awarding of attorney's fees to the USFL was
compulsory.
</P>
<P>
"The award of only nominal damages to the USFL does not affect its right to
attorney's fees."
</P>
<P>
Allowing recovery of the fees encourages "the detection and cessation of
anti-competitive behavior" by assuring that when lawyers prevail they will be
paid by the losing side, the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
In another ruling today, the high court refused to kill a $100-million lawsuit
against Dade County, Fla., and developers of Joe Robbie Stadium, home of the
Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
The justices, without comment, let stand an appeals court ruling that three
black residents of the stadium neighborhood can pursue in federal court their
constitutional attack against the county and developers.
</P>
<P>
That portion of the suit revived by the appeals court alleges that the zoning
changes made to accommodate construction of the stadium complex violated
constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
The suit says the zoning changes represented both a "taking" of private
property without just compensation and "a stark pattern of discriminatory
practices affecting the property and housing rights of black citizens."

<TEXT>
   Oregon doesn't have a National Football League
team, but it may soon become the only state in the nation to offer a
lottery game based on the point spreads of NFL games.
   NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle is threatening legal action, saying
such a betting game would harm the integrity of professional
football.
   Boosters of the game say it would tap a new audience for the
Oregon Lottery and could be used to raise money for college sports
programs.
   Gov. Neil Goldschmidt initially said he shared Rozelle's concerns
about the game, which for a $1 investment would allow players to
predict the outcome of some or all of the 14 weekly NFL games
against the point spread.
   This week, however, Goldschmidt said that after discussing the
game with lottery officials he's warming up to the idea.
   ``I'm not saying I would prefer to do what it is they're
proposing, but my comfort level is slightly higher than it was,''
the governor said at a news conference Tuesday.
   Goldschmidt has said he supports a bill pending in the
Legislature calling on the lottery to create a new game to generate
up to $9 million a year for Oregon intercollegiate sports. In
general, proceeds from the Oregon Lottery are used for economic
development programs, which can ben anything from a current prison
construction program to local sewer improvements.
   Oregon Lottery Director Jim Davey hopes to use the NFL betting
game for the college sports fund, although he's drawing up a list of
possible alternatives.
   New games must be approved by the five-member Lottery Commission,
which can act without the governor's approval although the members
and Davey are appointed by the governor and serve at his pleasure.
   The commission members are considering meeting in the next two
weeks and have said they support the proposal. Chairman Debbs Potts
said earlier this week that he hoped the commission would approve
the game.
   Under the lottery's proposal, players would try to predict the
outcome of four to 14 games against the point spreads set by Nevada
casino oddsmakers. The more games they bet, the more money they
could win, from about $8 for a perfect four-game card to about
$8,000 for a perfect 14-game card.
   Though Oregon's lottery is small by national standards _ $150
million in annual sales _ the football betting game proposal is
viewed by the NFL ``with genuine alarm,'' Rozelle said in a recent
letter to Goldschmidt.
   The NFL chief said linking a lottery game to the outcome of NFL
games would jeopardize the public's confidence that every player was
doing his best and that referees were calling plays as they see them.
   ``It could change the fundamental character of fan interest in
the game,'' League spokesman Jim Heffernan said in a telephone
interview from NFL headquarters in New York. ``They would not be
concerned about who won the games but by how many points a team
wins.''
   Davey said people already bet millions of dollars each year on
NFL games, whether legally in Nevada or through bookies and office
pools elsewhere.
   ``It's already happening, and all we're doing is tapping into
that market,'' the lottery director said.
   Heffernan argues, however, that there's no comparison between the
long-established legalized gambling in Nevada and proposals
elsewhere to base lotteries on NFL games.
   ``It's already on the books in Nevada,'' he said. ``The National
Football League can't repeal a law in Nevada. But certainly, with
something that's not on the books, we can voice our opinion.'
   The league might sue Oregon if the state goes ahead with a
football lottery game, Heffernan said.
   The league took the state of Delaware to court when that state
tried a football betting game. But the lawsuit became moot after
Delaware gave up its game after one season in 1974 because it lost
money.

<TEXT>
   Television is teaching Britons to love the once
little-known sport of football, and American sporting goods
companies are cashing in on a craze for everything from uniforms to
T-shirts, badges and fluffy toys bearing NFL team logos.
   ``The market here is a six-year-old market,'' said Andrew
Maconie, whose company, Licensing Management International, handles
licensing, publishing and marketing for the National Football
League in Britain. ``It was created with television.''
   Britain's Channel 4 television began broadcasting weekly
highlights of NFL games in 1982, calling the program ``American
Football'' to distinguish it from soccer, called simply
``football'' here. Audiences have tripled to around 3 million
viewers each week, the TV station's studies say.
   Many British fans have gone beyond armchair-quarterbacking. More
than 100 teams have sprung up in the country, a league has been
formed sponsored by Budweiser beer, and several magazines dedicated
to the imported sport are being published.
   As the game has caught on, sales of American football
paraphernalia have taken off.
   Last year, Maconie sold more than $43 million worth of
NFL-licensed products, a 15 percent increase over the previous
year. He expects a similar climb this year.
   ``We started with zero in 1982, so we've obviously had some very
dramatic growth,'' said Maconie, who worked to put football on TV
here.
   The growth has attracted some of the top names in American
sporting goods to Britain. They have been helped by the U.S.
Embassy, which staged an ``American Football Equipment Exhibition''
to coincide with a pre-season NFL game Sunday at London's Wembley
Stadium between the Miami Dolphins and San Francisco 49ers, dubbed
``The American Bowl.''
   The British market for football items ``is here to stay, there's
no question about that,'' said Tom Knight, general manager of All
American Import Co., which distributes products made by St.
Louis-based Rawlings Sporting Goods.
   Standing at his booth decorated with samples of team shirts,
footballs and shoulderpads, Knight said sales of playing equipment
have leveled off as the sport has become more established.
   But, he said, sales of souvenir-type items, especially to
youngsters, ``is a side of the business which has been very big.''
   ``They, having seen their fathers and big brothers play, now
want to play themselves. That market can develop well,'' Knight
said.
   Chris Bye, an official with the Thames Valley Chargers, a team
in the Budweiser league, was hoping to find a good deal on helmets
at the trade fair.
   ``Each player takes 300 pounds (about $500) or more to kit each
year,'' he said. ``You have a squad of 50 players, that's a lot of
money.''
   Bye added that he was hoping to find higher quality goods for
his team.
   ``I believe that the existing stuff marketed to the general
public in England at the moment isn't of high enough quality,'' Bye
said. ``The stuff in the States is very good. We could sell some of
that over here.''
   Teddy Craze, whose Fast Lane Sports distributes for Champion
Products of Rochester, N.Y., says his sales of uniforms and various
NFL-licensed items have gone up by 300 percent in one year.
   ``There's really a good hard core'' of fans hungry for
American-made football goods, he said, ``and this is really
developing very strongly.''
   Another British firm, Woolgrove American Imports, recently began
distributing products made by Wilson Sporting Goods of River Grove,
Ill.
   Product manager Doug Proctor, his sales booth crammed with
Wilson footballs and other football paraphernalia, agreed that the
televised NFL highlights created a market that did not exist before.
   He said the NFL pre-season contests staged at Wembley the past
three summers also have sparked a lot of interest _ and sales.
   ``I think it's probably the best marketing system we have, in
fact, to have the top teams coming over here and showing how the
game is properly played,'' Proctor said. ``And it's a big spinoff
in the market.''

   Topps Is Suing the NFL,
   Charging Trade Restraint

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Topps Co., which sells trading cards, flipped
a lawsuit at the National Football League, charging restraint
of trade.
   The suit in federal court by the Brooklyn-based company
accused the league of an "unlawful attempt to block Topps"
from selling its 1990 series of professional football player
cards. The suit alleges that the league and NFL Properties
Inc., its licensing arm, seek "to eliminate Topps as a
competitor to Pro Set Inc."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Dallas-based Pro Set, also licensed by the NFL and NFL
Properties, introduced its first cards under the trademark
"NFL Pro Set" and "The Official NFL Card" prior to the 1989
season, and according to Topps, "were the top-selling
football cards in 1989."
   Topps's suit charges that the NFL, its teams and licensing
arm conspired to restrain competition in the football-card
market. The suit charges the NFL with trying to monopolize
the market, in violation of U.S. and state antitrust laws.
   The Topps suit "lacks any merit," said John Flood,
executive vice president and general counsel for NFL
Properties, which is also a defendant. Topps officials
declined to comment.
   Topps asked the court to rule in a so-called declaratory
judgment that its 1990 football cards, which are licensed by
the NFL Players' Association, do not infringe upon any
trademark rights of the NFL or its member clubs.

<P>
Miami Dolphin owner Joe Robbie, who two years ago moved the NFL team to his own
privately financed stadium, died Sunday at age 73, Coach Don Shula said.
</P>
<P>
Robbie, who had reportedly been ill in recent months, died at an undisclosed
Miami-area hospital.
</P>
<P>
"I was aware he was seriously ill, but I only found out about this a half hour
ago, and it's still a shock," Shula said.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate information on the cause or exact time of his death.
</P>
<P>
Robbie is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and 11 children, three of which work
for the Dolphins. Late last year, he announced the establishment of a living
trust for the franchise that he said ensured family ownership for at least the
next generation.
</P>
<P>
Robbie was a successful trial lawyer when he got involved in the sport in
August 1965 at age 49 with a franchise in the American Football League.
</P>
<P>
In 1970, Robbie hired Shula as coach. In his first season, Shula improved the
Dolphin record from 3-10-1 in 1969 to 10-4. Two years later, the team compiled
a 17-0 record -- still the best in league history -- to give Miami its first
NFL championship.
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins repeated as NFL champion in 1973 and have won five AFC titles and
have pro football's best record since the NFL-AFL merger in 1970.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Dolphins moved their home games from the half-century-old Orange
Bowl to $115 million Joe Robbie Stadium. Super Bowl XXIII was played there last
Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
Robbie put up all his possessions -- including the Dolphins franchise -- as
collateral to assure completion of construction.
</P>
<P>
Robbie was born July 7, 1916, in Sisseton, S.D. He attended Northern State
Teachers College in Aberdeen and the University of South Dakota Law School.
</P>
<P>
Robbie, a Democrat, served in the South Dakota Legislature. He ran
unsuccessfully for governor in South Dakota and for a U.S. House seat in
Minnesota.

There are few people more familiar with the problems of the National Football
League than Paul Tagliabue. It has been his rather difficult job to defend the
league against the glut of lawsuits that contributed to Pete Rozelle's
retirement.
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue was the loser in the suit brought by the Los Angeles Coliseum
Commission against the NFL for antitrust violations. The jury awarded the
commission about $20 million in damages for the league's violations of
antitrust laws. The suit cost the NFL $10 million in legal fees.
</P>
<P>
Technically, he was the loser in the suit brought by the United States Football
League against the NFL. However, the USFL asked for $1.6 billion but was
awarded only $3 in damages. That defense cost the NFL $26 million in legal fees
and greatly enhanced Tagliabue's reputation among the league's owners.
</P>
<P>
And he was the loser in the Raiders' antitrust suit against the NFL for trying
to stop the team's move to Los Angeles from Oakland. The NFL had to pay $20
million in damages.
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue joined the powerful Washington law firm of Covington &amp; Burling in
1969. After being made a partner, he almost exclusively handled the league's
Washington affairs.
</P>
<P>
Despite the losses, Tagliabue's reputation as an excellent antitrust lawyer has
remained intact.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of his selection as NFL commissioner was met with equal
enthusiasm by his courtroom opponents and supporters.
</P>
<P>
"He's a fine gentleman and a scholarly lawyer, and unlike his predecessor he
may pay some attention to antitrust laws," said Max Blecher, an attorney who
represented the Coliseum Commission against the NFL. "He'll keep them on the
straight and narrow, I hope. They need it."
</P>
<P>
Harry Pregerson, formerly a U.S. district judge now at the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, also had positive recollections of Tagliabue during the
Coliseum trial.
</P>
<P>
"He's an outstanding lawyer and certainly has a complete understanding of how
the league functions, knows all the owners and I'm sure many of the players,"
Pregerson said, while admitting that he has never seen an NFL game in person or
on television. "He made some cogent arguments, and my impressions were always
very favorable and straightforward."
</P>
<P>
Peter K. Leisure, the U.S. district judge who heard the USFL-NFL trial, was
also impressed with Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
"He's a man for all seasons, even though we're only talking about a fall
season," Leisure said from his office in New York.
</P>
<P>
"He takes great care in approaching very difficult problems, shows patience and
thoroughness and above all has a high intellect. I could not be more pleased to
hear that he would be at the helm during difficult times as well as good times
for the National Football League and professional sports in the United States."
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue is a specialist in antitrust law and the author of "Antitrust
Developments in Sports and Entertainment," which appeared in the Antitrust Law
Journal.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Sullivan, a professor at the University of California and one of the
country's leading experts on antitrust law, said the choice of Tagliabue is a
good one.
</P>
<P>
"I have general impressions of him as being a very competent, rather balanced
type of person and probably a wise choice," Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
Antitrust legislation is at the heart of the NFL problems. The league has long
contended that its monopolistic practices are used to increase competition
rather than to discourage it. Tagliabue told Fortune magazine: "Any normal
business can decide where it wants a plant, but we're treated like a group of
conspirators rather than a meeting of the board."
</P>
<P>
This is a view that the courts have not accepted, instead ruling that each team
is a separate entity. The NFL has long sought an exemption similar to the one
granted major league baseball. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes said
in 1922 that baseball is a national pastime and exempt from antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue also represented the NFL in the suit filed by the National Football
League Players Assn. after the 1987 strike. The matter is yet to be decided by
a Minneapolis court.
</P>
<P>
Still, his reputation is not one of being anti-union.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have him listed as a union buster," said Virginia Diamond, an
attorney with the AFL-CIO. "We've never considered Covington &amp; Burling a
union-busting firm."
</P>
<P>
Gene Upshaw, executive director of the NFLPA, said that he expects good
relations with the new commissioner. "I want to congratulate Paul Tagliabue on
his selection as NFL commissioner and I look forward to working with him,"
Upshaw said in a statement. "I have always found him a straight-forward
thinking type of person interested in resolving differences."

<TEXT>     It's all part of the new NFL Spirit Actionwear for Women from the New
Jersey-based sweater company of Cliff Engle. Prices range from $60 for a
fleece pullover to $900 for the fringed leather jacket.;    Robert De Martino,
executive vice president of Cliff Engle, is projecting first-year retail sales
of $8 million to $9 million, rising to more than $50 million by the third
year. Future plans also call for expanding the NFL Spirit line into other
areas of women's clothing, including sleepwear and lingerie.;    De Martino
backs up his optimistic sales projections with a blast of statistics:;
(check) "The NFL did $1.4 billion at retail in 1990, but not one dime was
spent on anything specifically manufactured for women.;    (check) "Forty-two
percent of everyone who watches or attends NFL games is a woman.;    (check)
"The NFL has a couple of official catalogs and 68 percent of purchases are
made by women. Of those, 86 percent are purchasing for themselves items like a
T-shirt or a team jacket. But until this point it's strictly a man's item and
they're wearing the same jacket a boyfriend or husband has.;    (check)
"Citibank issued Visa affinity cards (with NFL team logos) to 37,000 women in
their names only, not combined with a husband.;    "Somebody's been missing
the boat," De Martino concludes.;    Recognizing a market niche, De Martino
talked to NFL Properties, which handles licensing for all 28 teams. Cliff
Engle already held licenses for NFL men's shirts and sweaters, as well as
licenses for men's sweaters with the National Hockey League, Major League
Baseball and the National Basketball Association.;    The company hired Ruth
West, known within the fashion industry for her innovative designs at Ocean
Pacific, to design the first NFL Spirit collection. It was previewed at an NFL
Properties meeting for its 423 license holders and 600 retailers at the Super
Bowl.;    "We've shown the line to 52 retailers so far this year and we've
taken 52 orders," boasts De Martino. Bay Area stores that have placed orders
include Sports Fan, Macy's and Nordstrom.;    "We went fairly heavy with it,
mainly in Niners (colors)," says Bob Blonder, who ordered $86,000 worth of the
NFL Spirit line, including more than two dozen of the fringed jackets for his
10 Sports Fan stores.;    "I think it's going to sell pretty good, especially
at Christmas. A lot of husbands will buy it for their wives," Blonder says.;
 To kick off the line, NFL Properties and Cliff Engle are launching a
cooperative $1 million advertising campaign featuring Jennifer Montana
modeling the 49er version of the $900 fringe jacket. That famous number 16
jersey is hanging behind her and the ad says "This Montana has a style all her
own.";    While it describes her as "wife of All-Pro 49er quarterback," it
fails to mention that quarterback's first name. The ads are now running in
trade journals such as Women's Wear Daily and in August will pop up in Elle,
Vogue, People, Cosmopolitan, Sports Illustrated, US and other magazines.;
"Jennifer is the first lady of football, she's attractive and a former model
so it made a lot of sense and it's done incredible things for our sales (to
stores) in the Bay Area," says De Martino. However, he says he has contacted
both Candice Bergen and Jamie Lee Curtis, "who have more national appeal," for
possible future advertising campaigns.;    One obvious customer who hasn't
called is Eddie De Bartolo, owner of the 49ers and known for his gift-giving
when it comes to players' wives and girlfriends.;    "We haven't done anything
with the teams on a direct basis; we just haven't had time," De Martino says.
"From a selfish standpoint, what we're going to sell to teams doesn't make or
break us. It's more important to sell to established retail stores."  </TEXT>

NFL'S ELECTION OF FINKS IS BLOCKED BY 11 OWNERS

<P>
Eleven National Football League club owners got together here Thursday night
and blocked the election of the old guard's candidate for commissioner to
succeed Pete Rozelle, who resigned three months ago.
</P>
<P>
In the center of the storm was Jim Finks, general manager of the New Orleans
Saints, who, as the only candidate yet nominated, is still in the running for
an office that the league expects to fill at a later meeting this summer .
</P>
<P>
When they refused to vote him in, the dissidents seemed to be shooting not at
Finks, but at the old-line owners who backed him.
</P>
<P>
As Hugh Culverhouse, president of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, said the other day,
the NFL's newer owners have been outraged lately by what they called the
high-handed tactics of the league's old guard.
</P>
<P>
At a stormy six-hour meeting, the representatives of 27 NFL clubs took only two
ballots on Finks, both secret, and got the same count each time, 16 ayes and 11
passes.
</P>
<P>
To elect a commissioner, 19 votes are required.
</P>
<P>
Ram owner Georgia Frontiere's representative, John Shaw, was one of the 11 who
abstained from voting for the nominee.
</P>
<P>
Raider owner Al Davis voted for Finks.
</P>
<P>
The four leaders of the dissidents are Culverhouse, Norman Braman, Edward
DeBartolo Jr. and Mike Lynn. The last three are the presidents of,
respectively, the Philadelphia Eagles, the San Francisco 49ers and the
Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
The ownerships of all four clubs are comparatively new, as time is measured in
the 70-year-old NFL. Others voting with the dissidents were the new owners of
the Denver Broncos, the Seattle Seahawks, the New England Patriots and the
Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Frontiere, the owners of two other old-line teams, Joe Robbie of
the Miami Dolphins and Robert Irsay of the Indianapolis Colts, lined up against
Finks.
</P>
<P>
But their stands were not a surprise. Frontiere often votes with Culverhouse.
The other two, Robbie and Irsay, are considered independents rather than
old-guard regulars.
</P>
<P>
Braman, taking charge of the dissidents in the absence of Culverhouse, said the
group spent most of the day in meetings here ahead of the NFL session that
began at 4:30 p.m., CDT.
</P>
<P>
"We considered boycotting the session," he said. "But at the last minute, we
decided to attend."
</P>
<P>
Rozelle had stepped in as peacemaker. Informed at 3:30 by a petition from the
dissidents that they weren't ready to vote for a commissioner, he persuaded
them to come down and make their case in person.
</P>
<P>
The establishment people could have gotten a 17th aye, if necessary, from the
absent owner of the Houston Oilers, Bud Adams, but that would still have left
them two votes shy.
</P>
<P>
"No other candidates were nominated," Braman said. "This wasn't that kind of
meeting."
</P>
<P>
Asked when the owners will convene again, Art Modell, president of the
Cleveland Browns, said: "Sometime this summer on seven days' notice from the
commissioner."
</P>
<P>
The dissidents had objected that they had only six days' notice this time and
that four of those days were over a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
This was one of their many objections. The others included:
</P>
<P>
 -- First, three months ago, they had made a strong protest against the
membership of the search committee, which is exclusively staffed by old guard
members and headed by Wellington Mara of the New York Giants and Lamar Hunt of
the Kansas City Chiefs. The newer owners had wanted at least one of theirs on
the committee, but the old guard failed to oblige.
</P>
<P>
 -- Second, the rebels had expected a slate of three or four candidates. The
committee came up with only one.
</P>
<P>
 -- And third, that candidate turned out to be a favorite of the old guard,
Finks, who has spent the last three decades working with long-established NFL
owners.
</P>
<P>
All this was too much for the dissidents.
</P>
<P>
Said Rozelle: "Their main concern was (this) process. No criticism of Finks was
expressed by anyone."
</P>
<P>
Hunt agreed. Said the Kansas City owner of his hand-picked candidate: "Jim is
very much alive when we (vote again at the next meeting). I spoke with him a
few minutes ago, and he's still very much interested in the job."
</P>
<P>
Whether the search committee will nominate further candidates at the next
meeting is still uncertain.
</P>
<P>
"Finks is our candidate," Hunt said, speaking for the committee. "We were for
him unanimously going in, and we still feel that way."
</P>
<P>
Whether this point of view will be satisfactory to the rebels was in doubt.
</P>
<P>
They seem ready to take charge of the league, if they can, unless the older
owners pay more attention to their wishes and demands.
</P>
<P>
The rupture is the most serious in the history of a league whose members have
often enough disagreed in other years -- but never before brought the machinery
to a halt.
</P>
<P>
What's different now is the cost of the franchises. When the older clubs -- the
Chicago Bears, the Giants, the Green Bay Packers, the Browns and the others --
came in, their owners paid little to enter pro football.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the eight owners who have joined in the 1980s paid up to $100
million apiece. And even in the late '70s, franchise prices were staggering in
contrast with those of the 1960s and earlier.
</P>
<P>
The new gang is of the opinion that the old guys aren't sufficiently interested
in their problems, which are to a large extent financial. Most of them put up
many millions and borrowed many millions more to become NFL owners, and their
debt structures prompt them to look at most NFL problems in a different way.
</P>
<P>
They're angry that the established owners don't understand this -- but until
just a few hours ago, that anger was mostly misdirected. Indeed, the rebels
lacked leadership as recently as last week, except for Culverhouse, and they
lacked any semblance of organization as well.
</P>
<P>
Mainly, most of the new owners have been too busy in their own businesses to
work up any NFL plots.
</P>
<P>
The difference Thursday was that Braman finally got them organized, and the NFL
may never be the same.
</P>
<P>
Voting with the old guard were two new owners, Alex Spanos of the San Diego
Chargers and Tom Benson of the Saints. Spanos often votes with the Raiders'
Davis. Benson defected because he liked the idea of having his own man, Finks,
in the commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
The other teams that voted the establishment way were the six from which the
search committee was chosen -- the Giants, the Chiefs, the Browns, the Packers,
the Buffalo Bills and the Pittsburgh Steelers -- plus the Washington Redskins,
the Bears, the Detroit Lions, the Phoenix Cardinals, the Atlanta Falcons, the
Cincinnati Bengals and the New York Jets.

   Every time the National Football
League's stars butt heads on network television, Julie Nimmons
says, her company is being thrown for a loss.
   She is president of Schutt Athletic Sales Co., which had
supplied 40 percent of the helmets used by NFL players until this
year, when the NFL's licensing arm signed an agreement with her
prime competitor, Chicago-based Riddell Inc.
   In an agreement with the NFL, Riddell is making helmets,
shoulder pads and other gear available to the league's 28 teams for
free if 90 percent of a team's players use its helmets. Players who
wear helmets by other companies must conceal those companies' logos.
   That agreement has landed the two companies in the Chicago
courtroom of U.S. District Judge James Zagel, where lawyers for
Schutt argued at a trial in September that Riddell has violated
federal antitrust laws. A decision is pending.
   ``Other people want to emulate their heroes,'' Mrs. Nimmons
said. ``They will use what their heroes use.''
   She said her central Illinois-based company could be forced out
of business by the agreement, which she says hurts its sales of
helmets to college and high school football teams.
   But David Kagan, an attorney for Riddell, said football helmets
aren't ``impulse'' items that coaches or equipment managers would
buy after glimpsing the helmets during televised NFL games.
   ``No one has ever tried to advertise football helmets on TV like
you would dishwashing detergent or bubble gum, because no one is
interested in that sort of thing,'' Kagan said. ``You would no more
advertise a football helmet than you would a B-1 bomber.''
   No money is involved in the Riddell-NFL deal. Riddell is gaining
exposure that might help the company launch a line of running shoes
and sportswear, Kagan said.
   Mrs. Nimmons contends that exposure is worth $750,000 a game or
$12 million a season _ the amount her company would have to pay for
television advertising during NFL games to match Riddell's air time.
   That is more than her company's annual gross receipts from
helmet sales, she said.
   Schutt, the nation's second-largest manufacturer of football
helmets, is privately held and Mrs. Nimmons declined to provide an
exact sales figure.
   Fortune magazine estimated Riddell's annual sales at $20 million
for 1988. Riddell officials did not return repeated phone calls.
   Frank Vuono, vice president of NFL Properties, which handles the
league's licensing rights, said the NFL hooked up with Riddell
because the company has been a licensee of NFL Properties for
years. A licensee has the right to market helmets with clubs' names
on them.
   ``Riddell has always provided good service to the clubs, and
it's not much of a change in the status quo,'' he said.
   In the last 10 years, the number of major football helmet
companies has dropped from 18 to three because of lawsuits over
helmet safety, Mrs. Nimmons said. The other major manufacturer is
BSN Corp.
   That trend has helped drive helmet prices higher, said John
Horan, editor of Sporting Goods Management News.
   ``A coach is probably paying $120 for a helmet that, taking away
the insurance and given a competitive situation, would probably
cost a fraction of that,'' Horan said.
   Deals like Riddell's will only push the price higher, Mrs.
Nimmons said.
   ``The cost of providing all those free goods will be borne by
the consumer,'' she said. ``All of a sudden the poor guy is paying
for the rich guy to get free stuff.''

   A former team owner thinks the NFL should be flagged for a
penalty -- a $348 million penalty.
   An antitrust suit against the National Football League by
former New England Patriots owner, William H. Sullivan, could
open the gates for corporate ownership of football teams and
send franchise values soaring.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Sullivan, longtime owner of the Patriots, filed suit
in federal court in Providence, R.I., charging that in 1987,
the NFL unfairly prevented him from selling a 49% stake in
his team to an investment bank that would have resold
interests to the public.
   Mr. Sullivan says he was blocked because of an NFL rule
that prohibits selling any interest in an NFL team to "any
company not involved in the business of professional
football." In the suit he says that's a violation of the
Sherman Antitrust Act. He also complains that selective
enforcement of the rule provides a way for the league
commissioner to control independent franchise owners,
"depending on pure whim, caprice, favoritism or devious
maneuvering."
   If he wins, the ban on corporate ownership would
presumably be effectively overturned, opening the league to
potentially vast changes. Unique among major professional
sports leagues, the NFL has tried to limit ownership to
individuals and partnerships. That provides a clubby
atmosphere and forces owners to control expenses because they
generally can't write off losses on football against profits
in other lines of business.
   "This is certainly not a frivolous lawsuit," says Martin
J. Greenberg, a sports attorney and director of the National
Sports Law Institute at Marquette University in Milwaukee.
Because few individuals can afford the potential $150 million
cost of a professional football franchise, if Mr. Sullivan
prevails it could boost demand and value "by creating a new
community of potential owners."
   In a statement, the NFL said, the charges, "are totally
without merit." It added that "The NFL's ownership policies
were always applied fairly to Bill Sullivan and the New
England Patriots."
   Mr. Sullivan sold the team in 1988 to electric razor
magnate Victor Kiam and a partner, in a a deal valued at
about $65 million. Most of the transaction consisted of Mr.
Kiam's assuming $20 million in bank debt, as well as other
debt and contingent liabilities. Mr. Sullivan says in the
lawsuit he received $2.5 million at the time and an
additional $2.1 million over three years. Mr. Kiam also paid
$400,000 for Mr. Sullivan's Patriots memorabilia.
   Mr. Sullivan and the team were debt ridden because of a
disastrous decision to manage a concert tour for pop singer
Michael Jackson and because the franchise had never been well
capitalized. Mr. Sullivan said he filed the lawsuit after
finding out last year that the NFL had allowed the San
Francisco 49ers to be sold to its owners' real estate
development corporation.
   There isn't any assurance that Mr. Sullivan will win.
However, his attorney, former San Francisco Mayor Joseph
Alioto, has successfully challenged NFL rules on antitrust
grounds three times since 1957. Most recently, Mr. Alioto
represented Oakland Raider owner Al Davis, who won $18
million from the NFL owners in an antitrust suit over rules
that kept him from moving his franchise to Los Angeles.
   Mr. Greenberg, the Milwaukee attorney, notes that the
courts might conclude that the NFL is a voluntary association
that makes and interprets its own rules. "If these
{ownership} rules are the rules of the majority, maybe they
have to prevail." However, he said, "Nobody can tell how
courts will rule with claims made on antitrust grounds."
   Earlier this year, when reports of the impending suit
first emerged, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, was quoted in
the Boston Globe, "Bizarre -- there's no other way to explain
it." He recalled that Mr. Sullivan had bought out public
shareholders of the Patriots in the 1960s, and testified in
later court suits in favor of the league's prohibition of
outside ownership.
   In fact, many observers think the NFL is likely to open up
to corporate ownership in any event. This past fall, Mr.
Tagliabue said the league would review its ownership
standards to see if they remain appropriate. "It's more
historical than anything else," says a league spokesman. "The
philosophy is that a business whose primary interest was not
sports, may not be in the best interest of the league."
However, the spokesman notes that corporate ownership is
permitted in other sports.
   Indeed, the Chicago Tribune owns baseball's Cubs; Turner
Broadcasting owns baseball's Atlanta Braves and basketball's
Atlanta Hawks, and CBS Inc. once owned the New York Yankees.
   Glenn Wong, head of the Sport Management Program at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst, says, "With publicly
traded corporations as owners, there would be many more steps
in league decisionmaking and it would allow lots more
information to become public."
   Unlike many of the current wealthy generation of sports
team owners, Mr. Sullivan's main business was football. At
the time he ran into his worst financial troubles in 1986,
the Patriots were achieving their greatest triumph, going to
the Super Bowl.
   Mr. Alioto, who is married to Mr. Sullivan's daughter,
notes that the Boston Celtics had just sold a minority stake
to the public, and Mr. Sullivan saw a sale of 49% of the
Patriots as a way to realize at least $40 million and pay off
his debts and get working capital for the team. Mr. Alioto
says that Smith Barney -- which had handled the Celtics deal
-- Allen &amp; Co. and others "were all ready to go." However,
the other NFL owners prohibited the plan at a meeting in
October 1987.
   In the suit, Mr. Sullivan says his case was bolstered by a
story that appeared in Forbes magazine last year giving
details of how in 1986, Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., owner of the
San Francisco 49ers, transferred ownership to Edward J.
DeBartolo Co., a closely held shopping mall developer in
Youngstown, Ohio. The article disclosed that then league
Commissioner Pete Rozelle had been aware of the move and
allowed it.
   This past fall, the league fined Mr. DeBartolo a record
$500,000 for the action but let the ownership arrangement
stand, pending completion of a review of league policy. Some
owners have charged that the 49ers success in the 1980s
reflected Mr. DeBartolo's ability to pay high wages for free
agent back-up players because he could write off the costs
against profits of the development company. Mr. DeBartolo
declined to comment.
   In the suit, Mr. Sullivan also says that the NFL itself is
contemplating selling to the public a 49% stake in the
lucrative NFL Properties unit that licenses team memorabilia.
The NFL declined to comment.

<HL> U.S. Football League Loses Appeals Ruling In Suit Against NFL </HL>

<DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The defunct U.S. Football League lost an appeal of the jury verdict in its antitrust suit against the National Football League.

   The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a July 1986 jury verdict that found the NFL had a monopoly on professional football in the U.S.
But the jury awarded the USFL only $1 in damages, concluding the older league hadn't monopolized fall football telecasts and hadn't pressured major TV networks to refuse to offer the new league a fall contract.

   Under federal antitrust law, the damages were trebled to $3.

   The USFL had sought either a new trial or a new look at the damage claim.
But the appeals court said evidence was "ample" that the USFL didn't make "the painstaking investment and patient efforts that bring credibility, stability and public recognition to a sports league."

   The panel noted that various USFL moves "eroded fan loyalty and reduced the value of USFL games to television," ending "by its own hand any chance of a network contract."

   The USFL folded in mid-1985 after losses of more than $200 million over three seasons.
The suit accusing the NFL of predatory tactics was filed in October 1984.

   Harvey D. Myerson, attorney for the USFL, couldn't be reached for comment.

   Robert B. Fiske Jr., counsel for the NFL, said the decision "confirms what has been our basic position from the outset: that the USFL's problems were caused by its own mismanagement, not by any misconduct by the NFL."

   NEW YORK -- The National Football League Players
Association filed a lawsuit accusing the NFL of illegally
interfering with the union's licensing business.
   In a suit filed in federal court in Manhattan, the union
accused the NFL of intimidating potential licensees to stop
doing business with the players' association. It also accused
the league of enticing individual players into breaking their
licensing agreements with the association.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The suit claims that the NFL is trying to cripple the
union financially by hurting its licensing business, the
union's main source of revenue. Last year, licensing brought
in $6.1 million in revenue for the players' association, the
suit said.
   The suit seeks at least $40 million in damages for the
alleged antitrust violations.
   The suit accused the NFL of threatening the union's
licensees by telling them they wouldn't be allowed to use the
league's own trademarks unless they broke their licensing
agreements with the players' association. It said the NFL
offered to protect the licensees from any legal actions the
union might take as a result of abandoned agreements.
   The suit also charged that the league enticed several
individual players into breaking their agreements with the
association by paying the players $8,500 to $100,000 each to
assign licensing rights to NFL's own licensing arm.
   NFL officials couldn't be reached for comment.

WHAT'S IN THE CARDS FOR SPORTS FANS;

<P>
PRO FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL ARE JOINING BASEBALL IN THE BOOMING MARKET FOR
COLLECTIBLE PASTEBOARDS.

Gregory Sanchez sometimes apologizes for the inadequacies of a collection that
includes 800 football cards, 2,000 basketball cards and about 400,000 trading
cards of the baseball variety.
</P>
<P>
"I would have a lot more basketball cards, but they've been hard to find at
times," explained Sanchez, a 36-year-old manager of a resort near Frazier Park.
"Basketball and football cards haven't been distributed as well as baseball
cards."
</P>
<P>
Mindful of potential customers such as Sanchez, professional athletic leagues
and a number of companies are entering the trading card business. The new
players in this business hope to score in the wide-open field for basketball
and football trading cards, estimated to have a combined sales value of only
about $13 million in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of hobbyists trade or sell or save sports trading cards,
collectibles that tend to appreciate in value with age. Sanchez, a sports fan
who prefers basketball, is part of a burgeoning customer base that is rapidly
convincing sports marketing firms that profits -- big profits -- are in the
cards.
</P>
<P>
The National Football League kicked things off earlier this month when it
introduced a product called "The Official NFL Card," a package containing 14
player cards and bonuses -- a card commemorating Super Bowls and a scratch-off
card for prizes. The NFL, which manufactures its cards, will butt heads with
Score Inc., a Dallas-area firm that began to distribute NFL-licensed cards this
summer. The NFL and Score are lining up their gridiron collectibles against a
version produced by Topps, the established producer of NFL-licensed cards.
</P>
<P>
The competition will expand again when the National Basketball Assn. takes a
shot by introducing NBA Hoops Cards through the Durham, N.C.-based Liggett
Group, a candy- and tobacco-making firm that will produce and distribute cards
bearing photographs of professional round-ballers. The Hoops cards will go
one-on-one against the Philadelphia-based Fleer Corp., the veteran producer of
NBA basketball cards. While Fleer's product is licensed by the NBA, the Liggett
Group's entry will carry the official endorsement of the league.
</P>
<P>
The new competitors in the card market hope to challenge baseball card
producers, firms that have long dominated the sports collectibles industry. The
baseball card business was once dominated by New York-based Topps Co., the sole
maker of the major league collectibles until 1980. The industry is now highly
competitive, accommodating a Chicago-area firm called Donruss and two other
major producers. In fact, industry observers say the new players helped
generate the boom in the sale of new baseball cards, boosting it from a
$25-million business in 1980 to a $350-million enterprise in 1988.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Promotional Campaign
</P>
<P>
"The basketball and football card market is taking the same course that
baseball took when competitors entered the market," observed Jeffrey Kurowski,
an editor at Sports Collectors Digest, an Iola, Wis., publication that assesses
the value of vintage trading cards and other sports collectibles. "Baseball has
a gigantic (card) market. By making its own card, the NFL is stimulating more
interest in football cards . . . and the NBA is generating more interest in
(basketball) cards by officially backing a product."
</P>
<P>
The NBA and the Liggett Group are now gearing up for an advertising and
promotional program for the Hoops card, which will debut in stores in
mid-November, according to Don Fish, the NBA's vice president for marketing.
</P>
<P>
"There's a mania for all sports trading cards now," Fish said. "A lot of things
were put together real quickly to put this deal together. There are 100,000 to
150,000 new collectors each year. We wanted to be prepared to take advantage of
this (interest)."
</P>
<P>
Liggett also arranged to market and distribute the NFL's official football
cards in conjunction with Pro-Set, a Dallas-based firm. Tony Dale, publishing
director for NFL Properties, said the NFL will spend about $1.5 million this
year and $3 million to $5 million in 1990 to tout the cards. Media vehicles
will include cable television's Nickelodeon, publications such as Boys' Life
and sports magazines such as Sports Illustrated and Street &amp; Smith. "With
the astounding growth of trading card sales the past few years, it seemed
appropriate to get involved in cards," Dale said. "We're interested in the
collector market, which is primarily adults. But we're also interested in
youngsters because kids are more enthusiastic about baseball cards and we hope
to tap into that."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Faces Create Identity'
</P>
<P>
The NFL hopes to stimulate youthful interest in the cards and the sport through
its promotional campaign. Dale said football card sales have traditionally
lagged far behind the baseball collectibles partly because younger sports fans
-- ages 6 to 15 -- find it more difficult to identify with the game's players.
</P>
<P>
"We deal with the unfortunate obstacle of player helmets," Dale explained.
"Young fans don't see (player) faces and faces create identity for players."
</P>
<P>
To compensate, the NFL produced a card that shows two sides of its athletes.
One side shows a player in action -- sprinting, throwing or poised to make a
block or tackle. The same player appears sans helmet on the flip side.
</P>
<P>
The NFL and other new competitors are already generating new interest in the
football and basketball card market, according to James Echeandria, head of
American Consulting Corp., Orlando, a Florida-based consultant to the
confectionary food and trading card industries.
</P>
<P>
"The common wisdom was that football cards don't sell," Echeandria said. "(NFL)
Pro-Set and Score are proving that thinking is wrong. Football card sales could
more than quadruple . . . and easily reach $50 million by the end of the year."
</P>
<P>
NFL and NBA executives hope to generate some new sales by promoting their cards
at card trading shows, marketplaces that have been dominated by baseball
collectibles. While a 1984 Michael Jordan basketball card fetches about $50 and
a 1976 Walter Payton football card might sell for $100, those classic cards
cannot compare to the valued collectibles in baseball. Buoyed by the heavy
demand for all baseball cards, a 1952 Mickey Mantle sells for $6,500 and a 1909
Honus Wagner nets a whopping $100,000.
</P>
<P>
Greg Sanchez, who has trudged through card shows in a disappointing search for
football and basketball cards, hopes the NBA and the NFL successfully cultivate
the trade show market.
</P>
<P>
"Basketball and football need more of a presence at shows because people who
collect cards as an investment are a big part of the market," Sanchez said.
"Collectors are like athletes. Some are in it for the love of the sport, and
some are in it for the money."

OREGON APPROVES CONTEST DECIDED BY POINT SPREADS

The Oregon Lottery Commission approved rules Monday for a new game that makes
Oregon the only state with a lottery contest based on National Football League
point spreads.
</P>
<P>
The commission, on a 5-0 vote, endorsed the game despite the objections of an
NFL attorney, who said the action would harm the integrity of professional
football. No further approval is needed for the lottery, and ticket sales are
to begin Sept. 6 for the NFL's first week of games on Sept. 10.
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the game, called Sports Action, are to go to Oregon college and
university intercollegiate sports programs, which currently do not receive
state funding.
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Oregon Legislature approved a bill calling on the Lottery Commission
to create a sports-oriented game to generate money for college sports. Oregon
Lottery director Jim Davey and the lottery staff put together the specifics of
the NFL contest.
</P>
<P>
Davey estimates the game will generate between $4 million and $9 million each
year for Oregon intercollegiate sports.
</P>
<P>
Athletic directors at Oregon and Oregon State say state aid is essential if the
schools are to remain in the Pacific 10 Conference.
</P>
<P>
In the football lottery, a $1 investment will allow players to predict the
outcome of some or all of the 14 weekly NFL games against the point spreads set
by Nevada oddsmakers.
</P>
<P>
Under rules of the game, players will try to predict the outcome of four to 14
games against the point spreads. The more games they bet, the more money they
could win, from about $8 for a perfect four-game card to about $8,000 for a
perfect 14-game card.
</P>
<P>
NFL attorney Jim Noel told the commission the game would create a situation in
which fans are more interested in point spreads than how their favorite teams
fare.
</P>
<P>
Noel said the league is concerned that Oregon "is on the brink of triggering a
nationwide trend."
</P>
<P>
"The entire nation is watching," he said. "Lottery officials in other states
have stated publicly that if Oregon does this successfully, they will try it,
too."
</P>
<P>
Noel also said the NFL would consider legal action to block the contest.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't come out here to threaten anyone," he said. "There are some very
viable legal issues here that we're going to evaluate."
</P>
<P>
The NFL took Delaware to court when that state tried a football betting game,
but the lawsuit became moot after Delaware gave up its game after one season in
1974 because it lost money.
</P>
<P>
In approving the new game, Lottery Commission members noted that betting on
professional sports already is widespread in Oregon and around the country.
</P>
<P>
They said many people take part in office football pools or bet on games
through bookmakers, either illegally or through operations in Nevada, the only
state that allows gambling on team sports.
</P>
<P>
"All you have to do in Oregon is pick up a phone and place a bet," Davey said.
"People do it every day."
</P>
<P>
Commission member Mike Schwartz of Eugene said he thinks the NFL should embrace
the idea as an opportunity to market professional football to new audiences.
</P>
<P>
"It will make people more excited about NFL football," Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
Noel rejected that argument, and said the NFL does not want to see an expansion
of gambling on professional sports.
</P>
<P>
"The net effect of the Oregon Lottery game will be to increase the overall
volume of betting on NFL football," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lottery officials have said the game could later be expanded to include
National Basketball Assn. games.
</P>
<P>
In his appearance before the commission, Noel read statements from the NBA and
Major League baseball saying they oppose the football lottery on the same
grounds as the NFL.

<HL> Appeals Court, Backing NBA, Overturns
Ruling on Movement of Sports Franchises
---
By Hal Lancaster
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL>
<DD> 04/22/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<IN> JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) </IN>
<TEXT>
   An appellate court ruling has strengthened the control professional sports leagues have over franchise movement, legal sources say.

   The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco yesterday overturned a summary judgment against the National Basketball Association in its suit against the Los Angeles Clippers.
The court ordered a trial on the factual issues.

   The litigation stems from the Clippers' 1984 decision to move to the richer Los Angeles market from San Diego.
The NBA sued, alleging that the Clippers were required to seek prior approval from the league.
The suit was dismissed last year by Judge Leland C. Nielsen, who "suggested that the NBA could not possibly win its case under the guidelines established" in an antitrust suit between the Los Angeles Raiders and the National Football League, according to the opinion issued yesterday.

   In that case, the appeals court ruled that the NFL had violated antitrust laws in opposing the Raiders' move from Oakland.

   But Judge Nielsen misinterpreted the Raiders case, Judge Warren Ferguson said in his opinion.
"A careful analysis (of that case) makes it clear that franchise movement restrictions are not invalid as a matter of law," he concluded.

   Instead, the "rule of reason" must apply to franchise relocation decisions -- meaning that various interests must be weighed to determine whether the move is procompetitive or anticompetitive, the judge concluded.
Those interests include: Can the team survive in its present market?
Does the move to a stronger market present travel hardships for other league members?
Is a market being over-saturated with teams?

   If the rules established to determine these issues are reasonable, they can withstand antitrust challenges, sports lawyers said.

   "This sends a clear signal to everyone that the leagues have the authority -- and the responsibility -- to control franchise relocation in most cases," said Steven Ross, a former Justice Department attorney who teaches sports law at the University of Illinois.
"The decision of where to locate a franchise would be up to the league.
If the league abuses its power, it should then be scrutinized by the court," he said.

   Jeffrey E. Birren, general counsel for the Los Angeles Raiders, agreed, adding that "the Clippers tried to turn our case into a per se victory for any team that wants to move.
That's wrong.
Our case was not a manifesto for anarchy."
Ultimately, he said, "what you need are the procedural safeguards, so that neither the league nor the team can act in a capricious manner."

   Mr. Ross suggested other effects, as well.
"This may be a defeat for some league owners, who can't use the moving threat to rip off the taxpayers," he said."If this was on the books three years ago, the mayor of Philadelphia could have put his foot down and demanded that the NFL not permit the move and thus avoided putting up millions of dollars of taxpayer subsidies to keep the team from moving."
Three years ago, the Philadelphia Eagles threatened to move to St. Louis and the city offered subsidies to keep the team from leaving.

   Mr. Birren, however, isn't convinced that things will change on that front.
"The league will allow teams the threat to move to get the concessions," he said.
"That's the unwritten rule for most of the brethren."

   The NBA was ecstatic over the decision.
The appellate court says that "if we prove what we allege, we should win," said Michael Cardozo, the league's attorney.
"The trial judge said that even if we prove what we allege, we can't win because of the Raiders' case.
No one has won anything yet in an absolute sense, but we're a lot closer that we were."

   Arn Tellem, the Clippers' general counsel, said he couldn't comment until he read the decision.

   One professional sport remains unaffected by the legal jousting over franchise movement: baseball.
Its long-held antitrust immunity prevents teams from challenging its relocation decisions, said Edwin M. Durso, executive vice president of Major League Baseball.
"But I'm glad to see they have a chance to establish that their league's rules are valid," he said.
"It's in the league's interest to control the movement of franchises."

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: BARS WANT TO TAKE IT, SO NETWORKS COULD DISH IT OUT

<TEXT>
<P>
The NFL, scrambling for a solution to its television-signal scrambling problem,
is beginning to see a clearer picture.
</P>
<P>
The sports-bar business isn't the enemy -- it's an ally.
</P>
<P>
Most sports-bar owners say they would gladly pay a rights fee to be able to
show NFL games legally via their satellite dishes. But they've never been given
the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
That may change.
</P>
<P>
"Sure, the obvious solution would be to sell subscriptions to bars much the way
HBO sells subscriptions to viewers at home," said Greg Aiello, the NFL's
director of communications.
</P>
<P>
"Although that has not been part of the thinking in the past, it's an option we
are looking at now. But it's a rather complicated issue."
</P>
<P>
John Morris doesn't see it as complicated.
</P>
<P>
He has a plan, just as he did when he and former Ram Dennis Harrah opened
Legends, a bar in Long Beach, in 1979. Morris' plan then was to install a
satellite dish on top of his new bar-restaurant so he'd be able to show sports
events people couldn't get at home.
</P>
<P>
His plan now, he says, would allow the NFL to make millions off the sports-bar
business without much effort.
</P>
<P>
He recently sent letters to NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, other league
officials, the heads of CBS Sports and NBC Sports and advertising executives of
Anheuser-Busch, Inc., and the Miller Brewing Co.
</P>
<P>
Here's what Morris has in mind:
</P>
<P>
 -- Set up a telephone number for bar owners interested in subscribing.
</P>
<P>
 -- Establish a fee, say $3 a person, based on the fire-code capacity of each
establishment.
</P>
<P>
 -- Allow each bar owner to decide how he recoups the fee, either by a cover
charge or simply by food and drink sales.
</P>
<P>
 -- And, most important, have the bar owners police each other.
</P>
<P>
"When you subscribe, you'd get a list of other bars in your area signed up,"
Morris said. "If you've paid and your competitor down the street hasn't but is
still showing games, you would simply call the 800 number to report it.
</P>
<P>
"The league would then take appropriate action -- probably a warning at first."
</P>
<P>
Morris says this system could be implemented almost immediately because it
doesn't require the expensive and complicated process of scrambling and
de-scrambling TV signals.
</P>
<P>
And, Morris points out, when scrambling does go into effect, subscribers would
already be in place. All they would need would be a decoder.
</P>
<P>
There would be problems, such as appeasing network affiliates, but Morris
believes the money that could be generated would more than compensate.
</P>
<P>
"Let's say you've got 50,000 bars and other establishments across the country
paying an average of $500 a week," he said as he scribbled some figures.
"That's $25 million a week, and about $500 million for the entire season,
counting playoffs and the Super Bowl."
</P>
<P>
Those kinds of numbers might get the NFL's attention.
</P>
<P>
It appears that the NFL, as well as CBS and NBC, underestimated the furor that
scrambling would cause.
</P>
<P>
At first, the league's posture was to take on the sports-bar business head-on.
"Let them squawk," the NFL said.
</P>
<P>
But then Anheuser-Busch and Miller aligned themselves with the sports bars and
their patrons and for good reason.
</P>
<P>
It didn't take them long to realize what scrambling would do to sales. Morris
said Legends sells about 100 cases of Budweiser on an NFL Sunday. Without pro
football, it's about 30 cases.
</P>
<P>
So, once the beer-makers, who pour millions of dollars into NFL commercials,
started doing the squawking, the NFL and the networks started listening.
</P>
<P>
And they postponed scrambling.
</P>
<P>
Scrambling is still coming. But apparently it has been learned that, first,
there needs to be a system for de-scrambling signals that go to sports bars and
homes equipped with satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
Among the NFL's reasons for wanting to scramble is its tentative pay-per-view
plans after the 1993 season, when the current TV contract expires.
</P>
<P>
According to the NFL's Aiello and network officials, the thinking is to
continue showing games on the networks, but also make a smorgasbord of other
games available for something like $10 a game.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the viewer would have the choice of watching any game -- some for a price
-- either at home or at a sports bar.
</P>
<P>
For years, boxing fans have had that choice for pay-per-view fights, and the
plan has worked.
</P>
<P>
It also should work for pro football.
</P>
<P>
The NFL season opens Sunday with Los Angeles limited to two network games,
because the Raiders, at last check, are playing at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
At 10 a.m., it's the Rams against the Packers at Green Bay on CBS, with Verne
Lundquist and John Madden reporting. Pat Summerall is at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
At 1 p.m., the NBC game is the Pittsburgh Steelers at the Cleveland Browns,
with Don Criqui and Bob Trumpy.

For those with cable, TNT will televise its first regular-season NFL game, the
Philadelphia Eagles vs. the New York Giants, at 5 p.m., with Skip Caray and Pat
Haden.
</P>
<P>
ABC's college football schedule begins Saturday with Oklahoma vs. UCLA at the
Rose Bowl at 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Keith Jackson, who will work the game with Bob Griese, is back for his 25th
season at the helm.
</P>
<P>
"I've had my ups and downs, but it's been a great run," said Jackson, 61, who
has whittled his work schedule to 26 weeks.
</P>
<P>
"I've now got the greatest job in the world. I get the spring and summer off to
recharge my batteries, then I get to do something I love, college sports."
</P>
<P>
About Saturday's game, Jackson said: "If Oklahoma can't throw, UCLA should win
the game."
</P>
<P>
About quarterback Bret Johnson, who left UCLA after losing the starting job,
Jackson said: "I think his leaving is a positive thing for UCLA. I don't know
what's going on in his head, but it appears he doesn't want to compete, and
you're usually better off without those kinds of people."

TV-Radio Notes
</P>
<P>
After the UCLA-Oklahoma game on Channel 7, there will be a nicely done one-hour
NFL preseason special, produced by GGP Sports, with Dan Dierdorf as host. It
repeats Sunday at 4 p.m. . . . The UCLA-Oklahoma game will be repeated on Prime
Ticket Saturday at 6 p.m. . . . On Sept. 15, the Bruins' home game against
Stanford at 3:30 p.m. will be nationally televised over the Prime Network,
which includes Prime Ticket. On Sept. 22, USC at Washington will be the Prime
Network's Pacific 10 game of the week.
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive week, CBS is ignoring the baseball races to cover
the U.S. Open. There's nothing wrong with tennis, but does CBS really think
it's more popular than baseball? . . . Attention, history buffs: "This Week in
the NFL," on Channel 2 Saturday at 4:30 p.m., there will be a segment on great
opening-day performances. Highlighted is Norm Van Brocklin completing 27 of 41
passes for 554 yards and five touchdowns in a 54-14 Ram victory over the old
New York Yankees on Sept. 28, 1951.
</P>
<P>
Sunday won't be an NFL day without Brent Musburger, after all. He'll be ESPN's
guest on "SportsCenter" at 8:30 a.m. and later at 8 p.m. and on "GameDay" at 9
a.m. . . . "GameDay" has moved from 8:30 to 9 a.m., but CNN has a new pregame
show at 8:30 a.m., with Vince Cellini and Ken Stabler. . . . Geoff Witcher has
replaced John Rebenstorf as Cal State Fullerton's football play-by-play
announcer. Rebenstorf, now the UCLA radio football commentator, will return to
Fullerton for basketball.
</P>
<P>
Spanish-language baseball broadcasts are commonplace, and now there is a
Korean-language broadcast. Sunday's Dodger-Cincinnati game will be broadcast
over Radio Korea USA and can be heard in Los Angeles on KAZN (1300). Moon Il
Lim will handle the play-by-play, and also taking part will be Jong Hwan Park,
assistant to the commissioner of baseball in Korea.

PATRIOTS DECRIED BY AGENT;
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: HE SAYS FORMER NEW ENGLAND LINEMAN SIMS SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN
COUNSELING BEFORE BEING WAIVED.

<P>
The agent for waived New England Patriot defensive end Kenneth Sims said Friday
that the team failed to adhere to the NFL's drug policy in not providing
counseling after Sims had tested positive for banned substances.
</P>
<P>
Agent Witt Stewart of Sherman Oaks threatened to sue the NFL, saying "Nobody
knows what the drug policy is."
</P>
<P>
Although the league has an established drug policy, it has been under fire
recently. That criticism resulted in the resignation of Dr. Forest Tennant as
the NFL's drug adviser Feb. 23.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Sullivan, Patriot general manager, told Boston television station WCVB
Friday that, in accordance with the drug guidelines, Sims had been offered
counseling.
</P>
<P>
"We made an effort to pay for Kenneth Sims' rehabilitation before he was
waived," Sullivan said. "That offer still exists."
</P>
<P>
Stewart said Friday that the only offer made to Sims was on June 19, when he
was waived.
</P>
<P>
"Patrick said the club would pay the deductible on the insurance policy," said
Stewart, adding that Sims was considering obtaining counseling in his home
state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
Sims cleared waivers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 1981 Outland Trophy winner as college football's best lineman, Sims, of the
University of Texas, was the first player chosen in the 1982 NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Sims was among a group of six Patriots who tested positive for
marijuana. The tests received additional notoriety when it was learned that
their results were not released until the club had played the Chicago Bears in
Super Bowl XX in January of 1986.
</P>
<P>
In August, 1987, test results showed Sims to have cocaine in his system,
according to documents revealed by Washington television reporter Roberta
Baskin Friday at an Associated Press Sports Editors' seminar here.
</P>
<P>
Stewart said that the test was used only to make Sims take additional tests,
which he passed until September of 1988, when results showed a trace of cocaine
in his system. Stewart said Sims denied having used cocaine during that period.
</P>
<P>
At no time during that period had Sims been offered counseling, Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
Sims signed a two-year contract with the Patriots May 24 that would have paid
him $300,000 for the 1990 season and $400,000 in 1991, plus bonuses. He was
arrested for allegedly driving 85 m.p.h. on an Austin (Tex.) freeway in early
June. Police said that while he was getting out his driver's license, an
envelope said to contain two-tenths of a gram of cocaine fell from Sims'
wallet. A charge for possession was lodged.
</P>
<P>
The Patriots then waived Sims, saying he had not been in good enough physical
condition during a mini-camp.
</P>
<P>
Stewart said he had sought clarification of Sims' drug status with the league
and had been told, "I don't know" by Sullivan, who instructed him to call the
NFL. Stewart said the league office has not returned his three phone calls.
</P>
<P>
Attempts to reach Sullivan at his vacation home on Cape Cod Friday were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
Stewart said that the Patriots' action and the furor surrounding Tennant's
resignation shows that whatever policy the NFL has is "not about helping
anybody. It's about policing people."

TAGLIABUE IS WARY OF TV SATURATION
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILBON, WASHINGTON POST
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only a few months after the National Football League signed contracts with five
television networks that will pay more than $3 billion over the next four
seasons, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Tuesday the NFL is closely monitoring
any indicators that may suggest oversaturation.
</P>
<P>
In a wide-ranging interview with editors and reporters of The Washington Post,
Tagliabue spoke in detail on the possibility of Dexter Manley returning to the
NFL after one year of his drug-related suspension; on his desire for the
Washington Redskins' new stadium to be located in the District of Columbia;
random testing for steroids and the support it has among players, and the
imminent implementation of a practice squad and expansion.
</P>
<P>
It is now possible to watch NFL programming Sunday's from noon until midnight,
with games also scheduled on Mondays and, later in the season, Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
"One of the problems is that we have so much on television now," Tagliabue
said. "In the early '60s there was no NFL game on television at all if the home
team was playing at home. That was until 1964 or 1965. Now we have three or
maybe four (in every city except sometimes Los Angeles and New York). And the
cable game on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
"We're very concerned -- maybe concerned is a bit too strong -- but we are
looking very closely at the amount of television we have. I think baseball
(which now has more than 200 games on TV) is going to have to take a look at
where they are, frankly. You've seen the numbers on ESPN and how much money
they're going to lose on baseball. You've seen the ratings; they're 40 percent
below what (ESPN) projected and the revenue is 40 to 50 percent below what they
projected."
</P>
<P>
The NFL signed contracts last winter and spring with CBS, NBC, ABC, ESPN and
TNT to televise all 224 regular season games plus the playoffs. Those networks,
in turn, will play the league more than $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
"We're not reassessing, because we think what we set up will work," he said.
"But we're looking at it closely and monitoring it on a monthly basis. ... So
far the public has made it clear they're interested in NFL telecasts in a way
that has no parallel in sports and few parallels in television. But that
doesn't mean it's going to be that way forever."
</P>
<P>
Asked if he could foresee a time when the networks have to cut back on the
amount of NFL programming, Tagliabue said: "That may have to happen at some
point. At some point there will be over saturation and it will not be sensible
from the fans' standpoint or the league's standpoint to keep going."
</P>
<P>
One of Tagliabue's more immediate concerns is what to do with Manley, the
banned Redskins defensive end, assuming he applies for reinstatement in
October. If Manley demonstrates he has been drug-free since his suspension in
November, Tagliabue could lift what is called a lifetime ban. Manley has been
at a rehabilitation facility run by former NBA star John Lucas.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to talk to Bob Woolf (Manley's attorney) in October and ask him him
'what has he been doing? Give me an up-to-date status report in terms of his
participation in the Lucas program in Houston,' " Tagliabue said. "The other
thing we need to look at together is his contract status. It's complicated.
What I hope to do is get on top of it in October and be prepared to deal with
it without a lot of delay. I have reinstated a couple of players this year;
Tony Collins (recently cut by the Dolphins) is one. In each case, where I had
an application for reinstatement, I had medical evaluations, I had my own
examination as to what they were doing in terms of employment, in terms of what
they were doing in rehabilitation and treatment. And I also tried to focus on
what effect coming back into the National Football League would have.
</P>
<P>
"This is a tough area. I'm clear that some of these players will do pretty well
outside the pressures of participating in the NFL, but when you subject them
again to those pressures they have problems. It's a real dilemma. ... I think
my policy is going to have to be if a player establishes a record he's going to
have to come back in and we'll have to worry later about making sure he has the
support and can survive the pressure-cooker environment. I don't yet have a
scientific basis for letting them back in. To this point I think I've leaned
over backward to let them back in, recognizing that it's a big penalty if I
don't let them back in."
</P>
<P>
In other matters, Tagliabue said NFL management representatives and the NFL
Players Association has agreed to re-establish a practice squad of three to
five players for the rest of the season. Players would be unrestricted free
agents if another team wanted to sign them onto an active roster, and salaries
would vary.
</P>
<P>
On the subject of entering a third season without a collective bargaining
agreement between players and management, Tagliabue said he knows there is some
sentiment around the league that an agreement is not necessary because the
league is thriving. "I don't agree with that," he said, "because I feel we
could be more productive if we could work together in more areas." Courts can
tell you what you did wrong in the past, but for the most part they don't give
you much of a prescription for the future."
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue says it would make more sense to work out a contract now because of
the $3 billion from television. "In 1987 there was no opportunity to do
anything new or creative if there was a dollar sign attached to it. Now we have
that opportunity." The commissioner said he has been having only
"off-the-record" talks with the two sides and that things are moving "slowly."
</P>
<P>
On the topic of the Raiders not moving to Oakland, he said: "I think everybody
has regrets about the way the city was dealt with by the team. ... I always
said it was the best-supported franchise in the league at the time and it was
by almost any measure. They came to us late and they had a lot of problems
getting their own community together. I think there are a lot of people in the
league who still feel that Oakland is very, very deserving of a team."
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue said one school of thought in the league is that Oakland, Baltimore
and St. Louis, all of which have lost teams in the 1980s, are deserving of a
second chance. Another group prefers the "fresh-market" approach of the
Carolinas, Memphis, Jacksonville, Fla., to name a few.
</P>
<P>
"There is concern," he said, "that the net effect of a team move is negative in
terms of fan interest. The cumulative effect has a lot of people concerned that
you lose the tradition, you lose the continuity, you lose the commitment in the
community and all that is very fragile."
</P>
<P>
On the league's drug-testing programs, he said, "the big problem we have on the
street drugs is we only test once a year (as dictated by an arbiter's decision)
and as a result we really don't know about problems until they surface with law
enforcement authorities. On steroids we're testing virtually every week on a
random basis, and I think that will be a tremendous deterrent to the use of
steroids.
</P>
<P>
"Congressman Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., and others have talked to me about, in
effect, ignoring the arbitrator's decision and going ahead and testing four,
five or six times a year or on a random basis for street drugs. I've decided I
would revamp the steroid program first -- the players are extremely supportive
of the steroid testing -- so I decided I would revamp it there, go to random
testing there, develop credibility, develop trust and then see where we go as a
next step on the street drugs."

   A federal judge rejected the U.S. Football League's effort to carve out a niche on network television, thus closing the books on the initial trial phase of the league's $1.69 billion antitrust suit against the National Football League.

   The USFL, which received only $1 in damages in the trial, had filed a motion for injunctive relief based on the jury's finding that the NFL monopolizes professional football in the U.S.
A motion for a new trial also was denied.

   But in his ruling, Judge Peter K. Leisure noted that the jury's monopoly finding was limited strictly to the market for professional football; the six-person jury specifically ruled that the NFL didn't monopolize the TV market.

   Harry Usher, USFL commissioner, said the league will appeal the case.
That appeal would focus, he said, on what he charged were Judge Leisure's "confusing and erroneous" instructions to the jury, his pre-trial rulings, which Mr. Usher said narrowed the case, and on the judge's refusal to grant injunctive relief despite the jury's finding that the NFL was a monopoly.

   In its request for injunctive relief, the USFL proposed three different plans that in effect would have limited the NFL to two of the three major commercial networks; the league currently has contracts with all three.

   The USFL suspended operations in early August after the jury's initial ruling.

<LEADPARA>  The World League of American Football is about to embark on a mission:;    "To
globalize American football and export it worldwide," said Mike Lynn,
president of the WLAF and former general manager of the Minnesota Vikings. "We
plan to go anywhere we can develop a market."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  MISSION IMPROBABLE
NFL TRIES TO BRING AMERICAN FOOTBALL TO THE
WORLD
WLAF KICKS OFF SEASON SATURDAY  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Pro Football  </MEMO>
<TEXT>      This global takeover, intended to spread the joy of the forward pass and
nickel defense to the far corners of the earth, begins Saturday. The league
opens its 10-game season in limited fashion, beginning in six U.S. markets,
Montreal and three European cities: Barcelona, Spain; Frankfurt, Germany; and
London.;     Not surprisingly, the birth of yet another football league has
been greeted with a healthy dose of skepticism. After all, the last
professional football ventures -- the USFL (1983-85) and the World Football
League (1974-75) -- went down in flames.;  THE 'WORST YEAR' TO START SINCE
1945;  And given the economic and political climate, there's plenty of reason
to question why this one will succeed.;     Even the optimistic Lynn concedes
that the timing of the league's debut is problematic.;     "We picked the
worst year since 1945 to start a new international sports league, not only in
terms of economic conditions, but in terms of the Persian Gulf war," Lynn said
from the WLAF offices in New York.;     But unlike other recent football
ventures, this league has the support and financial backing of the NFL, which
could profit greatly from worldwide interest in football.;     And unlike
leagues in the past, the WLAF has a strict cap on salaries. Contracts are
signed with the league, rather than with teams, to prevent the salary wars
that plagued the USFL.;  League has control; over player salaries; "New
leagues have failed because of economic reasons," Lynn said. "The single
biggest reason they fail is that their expenses are greater than their income.
But we have control as a league over what owners can pay in salaries, and we
will not pay more than we take in.";     Though the league has the support of
the NFL and is intended to help develop an international market as well as
potential expansion sites in the United States, Lynn said the WLAF is not
designed to be a developmental league for the NFL in terms of players.;     "I
think we're going to develop our own stars," Lynn said. "And we're going to
develop an athlete that can play in our league but may not be able in the
NFL.";     WLAF rules will differ from the NFL's, including a 35-second clock
and radio transmitters linking quarterbacks and coaches, making the no-huddle
offense a prominent feature. Several other rules will be implemented not only
to keep the game entertaining for new fans, but also to keep the length of
games under three hours.;  Expansion could; occur next year; Lynn said the
league is prepared to expand as soon as next year, but the initial goal is to
establish 10 solid teams. The next 2 1/2 months will determine how sound the
league is.;     Lynn said the Persian Gulf war -- now that it is over -- might
actually help the WLAF get off the ground.;     "There is a high euphoria and
a desire for things American," he said. "In Europe, America has never been
more popular.";    But whether that means that Americans in helmets and pads
-- rather than combat fatigues -- will be welcomed abroad remains to be seen.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  PROFESSIONAL; FOOTBALL; SAN-FRANCISCO; GAME; BERLIN  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  In Europe, Joe Montana thought he would enjoy a brief hiatus from the
autograph-seekers, gawkers and clamorous fans who intrude upon his daily life
in the United States.;    The NFL is doing all it can to ensure that he won't.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  NFL DRIVES TO SCORE BIG INTERNATIONALLY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "I thought I would find some peace," said Montana, whose respite from
attention was short-lived. Every afternoon when he steps off the gargantuan
practice field next to Berlin's Olympic Stadium, the people start running
after the 49ers' quarterback, whose stardom transcends the time zones.;
"Everyone, they know Montana, they know of 49ers," says Roland Gebauer, 22,
one of the 500 or so Berliners who watched the 49ers practice Thursday against
the Chicago Bears.;    "Forty-Niners rule!" a group of German schoolboys
scream, waving a banner as the players trot by. "Rice rules!" Wide receiver
Jerry Rice can't escape it, either.;    All over Berlin, NFL shirts, jackets,
caps, footballs and helmets are displayed in storefronts, part of the almost
$10 million the league expects such licensed products to bring in this year
from overseas.;    Out at the field, the selling is more subliminal, but just
as effective.;    The week of practices leading up to Saturday's American Bowl
exhibition game between the 49ers and Bears is open to the public. An
NFL-sponsored clinic is open to German coaches eager to brush up on
techniques.;    And the game itself, the NFL hopes, is an open door to
perpetuating the aura of American football in Europe and across the world.;
"I think all of us would like to see this become the No. 1 international
sport," says newly appointed NFL President Neil Austrian, a New York
investment banker who knows what it takes to make money in these economically
troubled times.;    Go global.;    This preseason, as it has since 1983, the
NFL is doing just that, staging exhibition games and bringing its headliners
to Berlin, Tokyo and London's Wembley Stadium, where American Bowl contests
have been played every year since 1986.;    Feeding an appetite;  Enormously
successful, the games exploit the NFL's inherent panache, bringing that image
to countries hungry to embrace all that is American.;    While the
introduction this year of the NFL-sponsored World League of American Football
has helped bring the game overseas, the American Bowls are what bring out the
stars -- and capture the imagination.;    "Baseball is not the American
pastime -- professional football is," Austrian says. "It has star quality.";
 And this is all part of a grand plan to expose the most American of sports to
a world that, for the most part, thinks of a football as round, not oblong.;
 Where does it begin?;    On television, of course. Thanks to years of
satellite broadcasts of NFL game highlights, German youngsters see Montana and
Rice, Fridge, Marino and Elway. They are awestruck by the size and strength of
defensive linemen, the speed of wide receivers, the explosiveness of running
backs.;    "They are the greatest athletes in the world," says Frank Stahnke,
23, considered by many to be the greatest wide receiver in Germany, where club
football is rapidly gaining fans.;    First organized in 1979, prestigious
Division I league football in Germany has 15 semi-professional teams in two
groups, with such names as the Cologne Crocodiles, Monheim Sharks and Bad
Homburg Falken.;    Naturally, the exposure-hungry NFL was the catalyst.;
Stahnke, the star of Berlin Adler, winner of two consecutive German Super Bowl
titles and well on its way to its third, remembers stuffing socks in the
shoulders of his shirt and sprinting with a rugby ball when he was 5,
emulating the NFL stars he saw on TV.;    Development programs; He and
teammate Roman Motzkus, 22, came up through Berlin Adler's development program
as 16-year-olds. Linebacker Jorg Opulchlik, 27, answered an ad in a store
window for players. David Spencer, 30, an ex-USFL player living in Germany,
did the same.;    "These guys are so hungry for knowledge about this game and
we just can't get enough," says Spencer, a self-proclaimed "utility man.";
Says Austrian: "Ultimately, and it's hard to put a time frame on this, we'd
like to be one of the true international sports. . . .;    "We're not saying
we're going to overtake soccer -- that's a ludicrous goal. But I think we can
have a real international sport, in the truest sense of the word."  </TEXT>

   Let the games begin.

   Not professional football games, of course.
Those contests -- at least with the National Football League's regular players -- ended Monday night when the league went on strike.

   Rather, the games now getting under way are those between the players and team owners in their contract talks, and those among the NFL, the television networks and the big advertisers who grease the whole television machine.

   Should players and owners resolve their gripes in the next day or two, everybody will be having a good laugh about all this at next week's tailgate parties in stadium parking lots across the country. (The two sides met for 90 minutes yesterday and are scheduled to meet again today.)

   But if the strike drags on anywhere near the 57 days of the 1982 strike, a lot of people along New York's Madison Avenue and "Broadcast Row," homes to the major advertisers and television networks, will be standing on line to renegotiate contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
The brunt of that financial burden will ultimately fall on the NFL.

   Major financial pressure to settle the strike will come from the three major television networks and ESPN Inc., a sports cable programming service.
In March, they collectively agreed to pay $1.43 billion over three years for football broadcasting rights.
The strike isn't expected to seriously hurt short-term network profits, however.

   The networks are already scrambling to fill their schedules for Sunday and beyond.
CBS Inc. says it is prepared to rebroadcast last January's Super Bowl game this Sunday, while National Broadcasting Co. plans to air baseball games Sunday.
Capital Cities/ABC Inc. plans to broadcast a movie in place of its popular Monday Night Football.

   Why have the football powers-that-be taken away America's weekly pigskin fix?
Mostly, it has come down to the issue of free agency.
The players' union originally made a complex proposal with interlocking demands and steadfastly denied that free agency -- the right of players to sell their services to the highest bidder -- was the most important issue.

   But as the strike deadline approached and passed, even Gene Upshaw, executive director of the NFL Players Association, found himself talking more and more about free agency and less about everything else.
And Jack Donlan, executive director of the NFL Management Council, said that everything currently on the table is negotiable -- except free agency.

   The owners have proposed liberalizing the current method of free-agent compensation.
But junking the entire system?
Never, says Mr. Donlan.
Average player salaries, he says, have already jumped to $230,000 from $90,000 in 1982.

   The owners' fear of free agency is twofold: Should teams bid willy-nilly on free agents, as baseball owners did, they could find themselves wallowing in red ink, as baseball owners did.
If they refuse to sign free agents, as baseball owners did, they could find themselves on the legal griddle, as baseball owners do.
Unlike their baseball brethren, however, the NFL owners don't enjoy total antitrust exemption, and would thus face an antitrust suit and the possibility of paying treble damages.
Baseball's grievances are arbitrated.

   "They feel they would fare much worse in the courts and that it is better to fight it out in a labor context," says Louis Guth, senior vice president of National Economic Research Associates Inc., a White Plains, N.Y., market research company that has done much sports work.

   Ironically, the strike was announced the same day as an arbitrator's finding that baseball owners violated their labor agreement with players by conspiring to close down the free-agent market.
Later that day, the NFL Management Council issued a statement that said, in part: "Today's decision by a baseball arbitrator strengthens our commitment to a settlement without the unrestricted free agency demanded by the Players Association."

   Nevertheless, both sides will feel considerable economic pressure for an early settlement from the various constituencies affected.

   NFL owners insist that the league's schedule will be suspended for one week and then resume with teams staffed by previously cut free agents and other assorted couch potatoes -- including, owners hope, some current stars who have threatened to cross the picket line.
Expect the relentlessly efficient, computerized Dallas Cowboys to dominate these games; they already have a full team drilling, while some rivals have yet to sign a player.

   Will America watch the games?
In two separate polls taken recently, more than 60% said they would.
Teams will offer refunds to ticket holders who ask.
Most will also offer refunds to luxury-box holders, who represent the largest chunk of unshared revenue in the largely socialistic NFL. Disgruntled corporate lessees could weaken the owners' resolve.

   In Miami, Dolphins owner Joe Robbie used the $12 million of guaranteed revenue from its 10-year leases on luxury boxes and less-expensive executive-level seats to finance his new $102 million stadium.
He could become financially stretched by a long strike.
Indeed, the Dolphins have indicated that they won't provide refunds to those preferred seat holders because the money has been used as collateral for stadium-construction loans.

   The New England Patriots, plagued by heavy losses and debt and on the auction block for more than a year, know that a long strike "will obviously hurt them financially," says a team spokesman.
But he points out a mitigating factor: the significant savings on player costs.

   Michael Duberstein, research director for the players' union, estimates that the average team spends $837,000 a game on player salaries, plus $17,000 in player fringe benefits.
An additional $200,000 in expenses will probably be saved each game, he says.
But the strike could cost each team a big chunk of the $1.9 million it takes in each week from national television money, gate receipts, luxury boxes, parking and concessions and local radio outlets.

   Players have also groused about losing big paychecks and, possibly, income from outside endorsements.
James Steiner, an agent for players, doesn't think that will happen unless the strike "becomes a long, embroiled situation and gets ugly with strikebreaker games and players fighting among themselves."

   Still, rumors of cracks in the players' claims of solidarity have abounded.
One rumor -- staunchly denied by all concerned -- is that the Chicago Bears gave the union a week to settle the strike before walking back in.
Some players, including the Jets' Mark Gastineau, have said they will continue playing.

   Fans registered their displeasure at Monday night's game by loudly booing the players' pre-game solidarity handshake and chanting "Strike!
Strike!
Strike!" after an uninspiring first quarter.
Fans also registered complaints with their dollars.
During the 1982 strike, they bought far fewer souvenir items, a small, but growing source of NFL revenue.
Thomas Shine, president of Logo 7 Inc., a large NFL licensee, estimates that the last strike cost his company $2 million.

   A battle appears to be brewing over whether the networks will carry the league's nonunion games.
NFL officials say the networks must carry the games if they are offered, but some network officials say their commitment to carry such games is unclear.

   Meanwhile, CBS says it is considering college football games, professional golf, boxing matches and sports anthology shows as possible long-term substitutes for NFL games.
A spokesman for NBC says that, so far, the network has only ruled out picking up games from the Canadian Football League, which NBC did during the 1982 players' strike.
Beyond Monday, ABC's plans are uncertain, a spokesman says.
In 1982, ABC broadcast movies throughout the strike.

   Such network schedule changes likely will throw advertising contracts into turmoil.
When the networks sell commercial time to advertisers, they typically guarantee them that their messages will reach a certain number of viewers.
If those targeted audience levels aren't met, the networks must compensate advertisers with free, or "make-good" advertising.
Advertisers will spend $500 million this year in network advertising to reach the large number of male viewers that professional football attracts.

   With recent sales of sports advertising time rebounding from stagnant levels of the past two years, network officials report that most commercial time for NFL games is sold out.
One reason: Network forecasts of larger television audiences for football appear to be on target.
ABC's first Monday Night Football game scored a strong 41% share of the prime-time audience.

   But network and advertising officials doubt that nonunion games or substitute programming will attract similar audiences.
Thus, they are bracing for negotiations on placing make-good advertising in alternative shows -- a move that may be difficult because network advertising is nearly sold out for non-sports programming as well -- or for demands of cash rebates.

   Network executives say, however, that they are protected from large advertising losses.
Under the networks' new contract with the NFL, the league must reduce the amount of the broadcast rights fees the networks pay them by the estimated loss of advertising revenue.
In 1982, the NFL cut its rights fees by $110 million because of the players' strike.
"It's not easy to identify your estimated losses, however," one network official says.

   Network executives are more concerned about the long-term effects of a strike.
They note that after the 1982 strike, viewing levels for football didn't recover to 1981 levels for several seasons, a reduction they attribute in part to fan and audience backlash over the strike.

   "Nobody is jumping around here excited about what is happening," says a CBS official.
"It's not going to be fun."

               Battling Over the Free-Agent Issue
   The NFL Players Association has proposed that any player,
after four years of service and regardless of salary, may
become a free agent and sell his services to the highest
bidder. Moreover, the player's new team wouldn't have to
compensate his old team in the form of draft choices. By
contrast, NFL owners propose that players become eligible for
free agency after two years (as it was in the last agreement)
but that teams would still receive some compensation for
losing players under a complicated formula. Some examples:
    Player's Annual Salary:    $120,000
    Years of Service:          4 years
    Current System:            Player's former team receives
                               third-round draft choice
    Owner's Proposal:          Player's former team only
                               has "first-refusal" rights*
    Players' Proposal:         Former team receives no
                               compensation
    ---
    Player's Annual Salary:    $210,000
    Years of Service:          7 years
    Current System:            Player's former team receives
                               first-round draft choice
    Owner's Proposal:          Player's former team receives
                               fifth-round draft choice
    Players' Proposal:         Former team receives no
                               compensation
    ---
    Player's Annual Salary:    $450,000
    Years of Service:          10 years
    Current System:            Player's former team receives
                               two first-round draft choices
    Owner's Proposal:          Player's former team receives
                               one first-round and one
                               second-round draft choice
    Players' Proposal:         Former team receives no
                               compensation
   ---
   *Under the owners' proposal, a free agent's current team
would retain the right of "first refusal," the ability to
match the salary offer of another team under certain
conditions of salary and years of service. The players want
to eliminate first-refusal rights.

<HEAD>NFL Considers Suing Over Capital's Planned Sports Lottery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEROY TILLMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Football League criticized the
District of Columbia on Thursday for a planned lottery that would
allow residents to bet on professional teams and said it will
consider suing the city.
   NFL spokesman Joe Browne said the league opposes gambling
``legalized or otherwise'' and would review the lottery and explore
its options, including litigation.
   ``With increased betting on sports, the nature of fans would
change and they would become more concerned about winning bets than
seeing their team win a game,'' said Browne.
   The city's Lottery and Charitable Games Control Board
tentatively approved the plan Wednesday night. It would have to be
approved by city lawyers and passed again by the lottery board,
following a 30-day comment period, before it could be started.
   Although a similar sports lottery is under suit in Oregon, the
district's would be the first in the nation to allow wagering by
residents of an area on their region's home teams.
   The NFL say such legalized gambling would make it easier to fix
games, unlawfully makes money from their private enterprise and
could turn fans against their home teams.
   Browne said, for example, Washington Redskins fans may jeer the
football team as it protects a three-point lead in a game in which
the team is favored by four points.
   ``We don't want to create a situation where ... people are more
concerned about how much a team wins by rather than if they win,''
he said.
   ``Our players are straight and they play hard,'' said Abe
Pollin, owner of hockey's Washington Capitals and basketball's
Washington Bullets. ``But what would happen if fans started booing
them because even though they were playing well, they didn't cover
a point spread? The whole thing is very negative.''
   Under the district's proposed game, a bettor would wager on a
minimum of four games on each betting card. The bettor could choose
up to 14 games on each of four cards. Point spreads would be used,
just as in illegal gambling. Prizes would range from $1 to $4,000,
depending on the number of selections and correct picks.
   The Redskins, Capitals, Bullets and nearby Baltimore Orioles
would be included in the district's planned betting.
   The National Basketball Association is suing the ports betting
lottery in Oregon, which allows wagering on professional football
and basketball games.
   Oregon has no professional football team and its NBA franchise _
the Portland Trailblazers _ are exempt from the game.
   The NFL lost a suit to block a similar game in Delaware in the
1970s. The state later dropped the game due to a lack of interest.
   Pollin said he would talk with NBA Commissioner David Stern and
National Hockey League President John Ziegler about to prevent the
game from getting started.
   ``I think it's absolutely horrible and it sends a terrible,
terrible signal to people involved in sports,'' said Pollin. ``The
idea of that money could be legally wagered on professional sports
is a terrible thing.''
   ``We're trying to teach our young people to lead very straight
lives and then this sort of thing comes along,'' he added.

A decade ago, Rick White wrote a master's thesis on the business of baseball.
Today he is one of baseball's most successful businessmen.
</P>
<P>
For four years, the former Southern Californian has presided over soaring sales
of official baseball memorabilia -- everything from traditional caps, pennants
and baseball cards to more exotic orange Orioles beaks and Angels air
mattresses.
</P>
<P>
White is president of Major League Baseball Properties, which licenses
souvenirs and apparel bearing major league team insignia. The former Chapman
College student returned to Orange County on Friday for an annual convention of
350 memorabilia makers, culminating with today's All-Star game at Anaheim
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
According to sports business observers and competitors, White deserves much of
the credit for transforming the memorabilia business from a marginal operation
to a major source of revenue and improving Major League Baseball's financial
fortunes in the process.
</P>
<P>
"There's been phenomenal growth in the sale of baseball souvenirs, and Rick
White has been the main reason," said Brent Diamond, publisher and editor of
Team Licensing magazine, which monitors sale of paraphernalia sponsored by
professional sports teams. "He's the marketing force that's driven almost all
of their recent success."
</P>
<P>
Major League Baseball turned a profit for the first time in decades in 1986 and
has remained in the black ever since. From 1986 to 1988, league attendance
jumped 11.5%, and radio and television revenue increased 33.5%.
</P>
<P>
But the gains in attendance and broadcast revenues are dwarfed by growth in
sales of official baseball merchandise.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, retail sales of Major League licensed goods totaled $225 million. The
figure soared to $700 million in 1988 and is expected to top $1 billion this
year. Major League Baseball, including the 26 teams and the commissioner's
office, gets about 4% of that total and then divides it based on an undisclosed
formula.
</P>
<P>
This year's expanded sales put baseball ahead of the National Football League,
which has long dominated the memorabilia market, according to White.
</P>
<P>
Frank Vuono, senior director of licensing for the NFL, said it is unclear
whether Major League Baseball is now the leader. The NFL declines to disclose
its souvenir royalty revenue.
</P>
<P>
"That sort of thing is hard to measure, and we don't release any figures," said
Vuono. "But Rick has done a tremendous job in centralizing and developing their
business . . . and most retailers say we're about even."
</P>
<P>
White, 36, began his career with Major League Baseball after completing a
"regression analysis" of baseball salaries for his master's thesis at Purdue
University.
</P>
<P>
"We figured out that Hank Aaron should earn the most, and he did," said White,
who had been an all-star catcher at La Mirada High School and student body
president at Chapman College in Orange. "Sometimes you have to prove the
obvious."
</P>
<P>
After a short stint as a public relations officer for baseball's umbrella
organization and then as an assistant branch manager with Carnation Co., White
went back to work for Major League Baseball in 1979. He was assigned to Major
League Promotions, the forerunner of Major League Baseball Properties.
</P>
<P>
"Things were somewhat sloppily run then," said White. "Commissions varied
radically, and the league, the teams and everybody else marketed the goods.
(Then baseball commissioner) Bowie Kuhn didn't want to clog up the game with a
lot of commercialism."
</P>
<P>
When Peter Ueberroth took over as commissioner in 1984, however, things
changed. Under pressure from both players and owners, Ueberroth centralized
souvenir sales within Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
Paraphernalia sales had been paired with an unprofitable media operation, which
was spun off as Phoenix Communications in 1985. A former Time Inc. executive,
Charlie Bear, was hired as a consultant for the new souvenir sales group, and
an overall marketing plan was adopted.
</P>
<P>
"We found the money teams were making (on memorabilia), even after a World
Series, wouldn't even pay for a utility infielder," White said. "Peter allowed
us to make a change. He didn't tell us how to do anything but said we had to
create some sort of strategy."
</P>
<P>
Bear and White worked together to forge a marketing plan, which was designed to
follow the NFL strategy of centralized sales, publicity and trademark
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
"They got a late start and learned from the NFL's mistakes," said Diamond at
Team Licensing magazine. "They've seen by far the most growth, largely because
Rick put together a good marketing program."
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, Major League Baseball assumed responsibility for stopping
counterfeit goods. When the program began back in 1986, shipments of unlicensed
foreign-made baseball products were turned back at the borders, and retailers
were assured that they would not be undersold by makers of inferior products
who cut separate deals with team owners.
</P>
<P>
Around the same time, Major League Baseball also dumped 25% of its former
licensees and began seeking more established producers.
</P>
<P>
In the last 2 1/2 years, the organization has spent more than $6 million to
police and prosecute counterfeiters.
</P>
<P>
"We want to establish ourselves as an upper-end producer," White said. "So we
are opening our own stores and are working with major department stores."
</P>
<P>
As part of that move, the league last year began sponsoring the Diamond
collection of authentic major league style apparel and the Cooperstown
collection of historically accurate uniforms.
</P>
<P>
Last year the league opened five Major League souvenir and apparel stores, in
San Diego, Oakland, New York, Pittsburgh and Milwaukee. It plans to open two
more by the end of 1989 -- one in Brea and one in Boston. The stores sell
parkas, towels, sheets and even wallpaper, as well as more traditional items.
</P>
<P>
In the future, White said, Major League Baseball Properties will begin more
joint ventures with players and increased marketing of such collectibles as
baseball cards and old jerseys.
</P>
<P>
Asked if anything could dampen demand for Major League-sponsored goods, White
mentioned counterfeiting, over-saturation of the market, and, of course, a
players' strike.
</P>
<P>
"We don't play baseball, we don't make money," he said. "It's that simple."

   They average $230,000 in salary for working less than six months of the year.
If they are injured on the job, their employers assume medical costs.
When they close out their careers, their employers pay them a handsome pension.

   But that's not enough, say the 1,400 striking players of the National Football League.
They want "free agency" -- the ability to sell their services on the open market to the highest bidder among the league's 28 employers.
That way, they say, they can bring their average compensation closer in line with that received by their peers in professional baseball and basketball.

   The NFL Players Union complains that, in the league's system of free agency, players are little more than chattel property of NFL owners.
First, it argues, the league conducts a draft of college seniors, granting each of its 28 franchises exclusive rights to the players selected.
Then when a player's contract with a particular club expires, he may offer his talents to other teams, but his original club has the right to match any rival offers.
If a player signs with another team, his original employer is entitled to compensation in the draft based on the player's salary level.

   Over the past 10 seasons, roughly 2,000 players have qualified for free agency.
Only one has signed with another club.
This statistic, the players' union maintains, is prima facie evidence that the NFL enforces a closed labor market.

   The players' grievance reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of their profession.
By suggesting that the owners are engaged in labor-market collusion, the players imply that the 28 NFL clubs operate as competitive, independent enterprises.
The clubs do compete -- but only on the playing field.
Where matters of finances are concerned, it's one for all and all for one.

   The league has a formula for evenly apportioning revenues from television contracts, licensing arrangements, gate receipts and other sources among the 28 franchises.
No matter how successful or unsuccessful a team is on the playing field -- whether it is a Super Bowl contender or league doormat -- it receives approximately the same amount of league revenue as any other club.

   Thus, the addition or subtraction of a player -- no matter how talented -- has little if any impact on an NFL club's bottom line.
It is unlike professional baseball or basketball, in which a star player can not only make a difference in a franchise's fortunes on the field, but off the field as well.
Indeed, a popular player in those sports -- a Larry Bird or a Dwight Gooden -- can measurably boost a club's attendance, and thereby increase revenues.
Attendance figures much less in an NFL club's profitability and owners rely less on individual performers to draw fans to the stadiums.

   The NFL is not an entire industry.
It is more a single entity, with 28 appendages.
Any owner under the delusion that he is operating in a competitive market would threaten the stability of the entire institution.
The same goes for the players.
Whatever individual club they play for, they ultimately work for "NFL Inc."
NFL Inc., with its 28 subsidiaries, competes collectively for consumers' entertainment dollars.
The sooner the NFL players recognize this, the sooner they can stop throwing eggs at other "free agents" and get back to playing football.

<HL> Sports Leagues Increasingly Put Retail Licensing on Starting Lineup </HL>

   Enter the stadium and step out on an artificial-turf playing field.
Browse around a concession stand and pick up a cap or a jersey or tickets to a future game.

   Just don't expect to see an actual game here.

   This proposed "stadium" is professional sports' latest -- and perhaps splashiest -- foray into retailing: The Baseball Clubhouse stores, being developed by the major leagues in a partnership with W.C. Bradley Co. of Columbus, Ga.
The first clubhouse store is scheduled to open later this year in Oakland, Calif., and if all goes well, as many as 20 could be operating by the end of 1989.
But some retailers and manufacturers warn that baseball's adventure in retailing could backfire, creating problems for everyone in the sports-licensing field.

   Baseball's clubhouse experiment spotlights the growing importance of retail licensing throughout the professional-sports industry.
Sports licensing now brings in an estimated $1 billion to $3 billion annually.
Though it remains a distant second in the $50 billion-a-year licensing field to character licensing -- mainly of cartoon and movie characters -- the appeal of licensed sports merchandise is growing as leisure time, spendable income and media exposure increase.
"It's virtually impossible to not have sports as part of your life," says Ralph O. Irizarry, senior executive for sports at Licensing Co. of America, which handles licensing for the National Hockey League.

   At least professional sports teams certainly hope so.
That's a far cry from a few years ago, when professional sports organizations were hardly paying attention to retail licensing.
As long as TV revenues continued to climb, they hadn't much motivation to pursue the market.
And without prodding from the leagues, retailers rarely carried more than a few T-shirts and sweatshirts bearing the local team's name.
"The leagues and retailers always felt it was a kids' business," says David A. Beckerman, president of Starter Sportswear.

   Sports licensing began to pick up in the early 1980s as fan shops, which specialize in merchandise bearing team logos, began to spread.
The success of those small stores prompted big mass merchandisers to also carry more licensed sports goods.
And the development of "authentics" -- licensed duplicates of gear used by the pros -- resulted in an upscale line of licensed products appealing to affluent baby boomers.
Now, says David S. Mitchell, director of apparel licensing for NFL Properties Inc., the National Football League's licensing arm, "we cross every demographic market that exists."

   The interest in licensing also has been spurred by the need to find other sources of revenue.
Baseball owners, for instance, face the possibility of costly new bidding wars for free-agent players and a cut in network television proceeds.
As the TV-network gravy train has slowed, league officials have started pursuing the retailing market more aggressively -- recruiting professional retailers to run licensing operations, for instance.

   The leagues' increased attention to retailing has paid off.
Retail sales of National Basketball Association goods reached $250 million last year, after climbing at least 50% in each of the previous five years.
The National Hockey League's sales last year climbed to more than $50 million.
And baseball soared to $450 million in 1987, from $90 million in 1980.

   But retailing can be as risky as a knuckleball pitch with the bases loaded.
Already sports retailers are warning that teams may risk overlicensing their names and insignias.

   These days, sports fans can get everything from key chains to football-helmet-shaped furniture to the $5,500 NFL beaver coat in last Christmas's Neiman-Marcus catalog.
Basketball junkies can slam dunk their dirty clothes through a hoop into an NBA hamper.
The NFL is considering a line of high-fashion evening wear.
There are limits, though; Mr. Mitchell passed on NFL toilet seats "for taste reasons."

   Some licensees say the market is being flooded with marginal products.
The number of NFL licensees has climbed to 250 from 100 just 10 years ago, one licensee complains.
The NFL's Mr. Mitchell replies: "We've got a long way to go before we're overlicensed."

   Some retailers also are concerned about the unchecked spread of franchised fan shops.
The leagues and teams shouldn't put themselves "in the position of (giving licensing rights to) too many people and losing the integrity of the product, and we can't sell it on every corner in every store of America and lose the value," says Mr. Beckerman of Starter Sportswear.

   Baseball's plans for the clubhouse chain have contributed to fears of a shakeout.
"There are too many people dividing the pie," says Michael Lewis, former head of Adidas U.S.A. Inc.'s apparel division and who now is starting his own retail business.

   But such concerns haven't stopped other fan shops from expanding.
With so many shopping malls in the U.S., "there's plenty of room" for more fan shops, says Gary Adler, chief executive of the 65-store Spectathlete, which got its start seven years ago.
Merle Harmon's Fan Fair, founded by the sportscaster in 1977, is "looking intermediate term at 400 stores before we stop to take a breath," says Robert L. Pagel, president and chief executive of the 82-store chain based in Milwaukee.

   Other leagues also are undeterred as they consider following baseball's lead.
The NHL wants to expand distribution of its licensed goods, and starting its own stores is one of the ideas being considered, Mr. Irizarry says.
The NBA is encouraging teams to open stores.
The NFL also has considered its own retailing venture but isn't eager to battle existing fan shops, Mr. Mitchell says.

   Baseball's clubhouse plan takes the leagues directly into the operating of retail outlets -- something no league has tried before on such a wide scale.
Brad Plumley, who heads up both the proposed baseball clubhouse stores and W.C. Bradley's 23-store Sports Fantasy chain of fan shops, is aware of the potential pitfalls.

   The clubhouse shops, which will be named for the home team in each major-league city, will be 2,000 to 2,500 square feet, about twice the size of most fan shops, and "won't be inexpensive to build," he says.
Although Sports Fantasy stores can turn a profit on sales of $300,000 to $400,000 a year, the clubhouse shops will need sales of more than $500,000 because they will be more expensive to build and operate.
The stores also will face stiff competition for mall sites.
Sports fan shops "only get one location per shopping center," says Mr. Plumley.
"We're kind of like a pet store."

   And the clubhouse shops will need to sell merchandise from other sports in order to make enough money.
"We can't run a 12-month business on a seasonal product," says Richard E. White, vice president of Major League Baseball Properties.
It isn't clear, though, whether fans will think of turning to the baseball clubhouses for football jerseys.

   Some retailers and licensees wonder whether the baseball leagues will hurt themselves in the long run by competing with shops that currently sell about 25% of the sport's goods.
"Once (baseball's) stores are around, why should other stores keep carrying their items?" says Mr. Lewis.

   Mr. Plumley doesn't agree.
"I suppose there are always going to be retailers that are going to say you've been my supplier and now you're my competitor, but I don't think the better retailers will be that shortsighted," he says.

   The league's Mr. White promises that the clubhouse stores won't seek preferential treatment from its licensees.
"We have to be very careful to be nothing but honest competitors," he says.

   But the clubhouse chain will have some advantages.
Mr. Plumley says the stores will offer actual game-day souvenirs that won't be sold elsewhere -- lineup cards, broken bats, baseballs, for instance.
And what other fan shop can command as much free advertising, from plugs on the thousands of games broadcast each season to store appearances by star players to recognition on stadium scoreboards?

   "This is the single most unique concept in this industry," Mr. Plumley says.

   TOKYO -- It's show time in the Japan corporate football
league.
   With the Onward Oaks trailing the Sunstar Finies 10-7, and
with time running out in the first half, the Oaks have driven
deep into Finie territory.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Touchy-down, touchy-down," implore the Onward
cheerleaders, in their rhinestone-studded yellow and blue
outfits. Oaks partisans leap to their feet, waving yellow
pompons. Across the packed Tokyo Dome, Finie fans brandish
their little plastic megaphones, tomahawk-chop style.
   It is the fifth annual Tokyo Super Bowl, and 53,000 fans
are on hand to see Onward Kashiyama Co., a major Tokyo
clothing maker, do battle with a club sponsored by Sunstar
Inc., an Osaka toothpaste powerhouse, for bragging rights in
the 79-team salarymen league. But in the burgeoning world of
Amefuto, as American football is known here, there's as much
action off the field as on it.
   Amefuto is in fashion in Japan these days -- and fashion
is the word. "The action is tough, yet the cheerleaders and
uniforms look sharp. It's the perfect combination," explains
Toshiyuki Noda, general manager of football and public
relations at Onward. Football's "air of youthfulness" is
important to fashion companies, says the natty Mr. Noda.
Onward is "determined to be No. 1."
   A look around the Tokyo Dome shows why. A young
consulting-firm employee in a double-breasted suit slips his
arm around his date while he explains some of the game's
finer points. A woman in a short skirt and knee-high boots
sashays up the aisle, past a trio of unseasonably tan young
men in soft business suits and narrow ties. Football aside,
the place is a fashion show.
   In the chic new Town of Greenwich boutique in Tokyo's
Shibuya district, 18-year-old Tomoko Isaku is about to shell
out 22,000 yen ($170) for an official National Football
League jacket -- if only she can decide whether to go for
Philadelphia Eagles green or Seattle Seahawks blue. The
highschool senior has never actually seen a football game.
But she thinks the jackets are cute.
   "Most Japanese know very little about football," says Sam
Kusunoki of Japan Marketing Services Inc., which handles NFL
marketing efforts here. "But the sport scores high on image
surveys," just a rung below skiing and golf. Like those
colorful outdoor sports, football is kakko ii, or "cool,"
especially to young consumers.
   "So we must try to tie the sport to fashion," says Mr.
Kusunoki.
   It looks like a winning strategy. A chain of NFL specialty
shops opened last year has 31 outlets across Japan, with
products ranging from helmets to highlight videos. Satin
jackets are the biggest sellers, with Raiders black
threatening to overtake 49ers gold as the color and logo of
choice, says Katsushi Takahashi, planning chief for K.K. East
Point, which runs the NFL shops under license.
   The growing array of NFL accessories includes such
novelties as Miami Dolphin and New York Giant watches (made
by Seiko) and NFL-brand men's toiletries by Kanebo Ltd. Sales
of NFL stuff are expected to reach $39 million in the next
year, according to Mr. Kusunoki.
   For many years after the first game, in 1934, between
Tokyo college students and the Yokohama foreign club, Amefuto
languished. It was played on a few Japanese campuses -- with
about the status Rugby has in the U.S. But the advent of NFL
exhibition games in Japan in 1976 gave the game a boost. NFL
reruns from the U.S. have become a staple of late-night TV.
   The company league, meanwhile, has more than tripled from
the 29 teams extant in 1985. And the Tokyo Super Bowl is but
one of a string of post-season bowl games for company and
student leagues.
   The biggest of all, the Rice Bowl, will be held this
Friday, matching Onward, the Japanese corporate champs (and
winner of the Tokyo Super Bowl), and the collegiate champs.
The college men usually run away with the game. Although
company contenders such as Onward and rival fashion-house
Renown are stocked with former all-Japan players, the
full-time salarymen practice after work and can't match the
six-hour-a-day training regimens of the top college squads.
   Unlike some sports, such as basketball, foreign ringers
aren't allowed to play in the Amefuto company league. There
is talk of eventually admitting U.S. small-college alumni,
but authorities worry that the Japanese players would be
overpowered by Americans. Even U.S. Ivy League squads have
trounced Japan's best college players.
   "Our sumo wrestlers could go head-to-head with NFL
linemen, and our best baseball players would make quick
backs," but not enough young athletes here get into football,
says Hideki Matsuoka, Renown's star running back and
underwear model.
   The talent pool is swelling, however. Proliferating school
leagues now include 216 college teams and 123 high-school
squads. There is even an 18-team medical-school conference.
   The growing appeal of football to young males may have
something to do with young females. Miwako Fukasawa saw her
first football game in college, on a date, and was taken with
the spectacle of "men crashing into each other with such
force." In their shoulder pads and helmets, the players "look
big and powerful," Ms. Fukasawa says. "It's kakko ii."
   Now a 22-year-old Onward office worker, Ms. Fukasawa is
head cheerleader for the Onward Oaks.
   One reason the level of play is rising too is the arrival
of foreign coaches such as Dave Powroznik, a former
University of Southern California quarterback who supervises
Onward's offense. Mr. Powroznik fortified his players with
weight-training, new plays and a get-tough style. In the
U.S., "you've got the Dick Butkus type {of player} who wants
to hit people hard enough to take their heads off," he says.
"Here they'll say, `Sumimasen -- sorry -- are you OK? I hit
you too hard.' In the states, that's absurd."
   Not that Amefuto players are wimps. Tadashi Odera,
Renown's center and captain, is brawny, nearly 5-foot-10 and
weighs 209 pounds. The 29-year-old Mr. Odera, rubbing his
thick neck, says he used to be slightly taller but shrank
from the battering by beefy opponents.
   Commercially, it isn't just fashion houses like Onward and
Renown that are wrapping themselves in pigskin. Mitsubishi
Electric Corp. hired Joe Montana to pitch its new video
cameras because the 49ers quarterback projects "speed,
intelligence and youth," says a company spokesman. The ad
campaign could also inspire Mitsubishi's own team, the
Socio-Techs.
   What's kakko ii today, of course, can be passe tomorrow.
Tennis was all the rage in the mid-1980s, when young women
slung rackets over their shoulders purely for show as they
walked around Tokyo. Today, tennis is just another sport.
   Very few Japanese actually play football, but as a fashion
trend Amefuto is going strong. East Point is planning to open
20 more NFL shops early next year to promote its new "Team
NFL" women's wear. There, the Ivy League look will be out. In
will be California feel-loose pants, shirttails sticking out,
and cute logos, says Mr. Takahashi. The new made-in-Japan
line, he says, will give the NFL chain a "total American
image."

Arizona's on-again, off-again holiday honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was
off again Wednesday, the victim of a narrow defeat at the polls that threatened
to cost this city the 1993 Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the defeat Tuesday of two King Day propositions, National
Football League Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said it was not "in the best
interests of the NFL" to hold the football game in Phoenix and he will ask
league owners to move it to another city.
</P>
<P>
Some observers blamed the potential loss of the game, first mentioned during a
televised NFL game Sunday, for setting off a voter backlash that defeated the
King Day proposal.
</P>
<P>
"Arizona has not seen the last of this (King Day holiday) issue," said Terry
Hudgins, campaign president for the Martin Luther King Better America
Committee, a group that fought for a paid holiday. "We'll be back."
</P>
<P>
Voters on Tuesday defeated by a 3-1 margin a proposition that would have
created a King Day at the expense of Columbus Day. And they rejected by a
percentage point Proposition 302, which called for a paid King Day as well as a
paid Columbus Day.
</P>
<P>
With 99% of the precincts reporting, Proposition 302 was losing 522,840 to
511,017, or 50 to 49%.
</P>
<P>
Cloves Campbell, publisher of The Arizona Informant, a weekly newspaper serving
the black community in Phoenix, said black leaders will meet today to determine
what steps to take next. "They are not ready to throw up their hands" he said.
"They are ready to talk it over and regroup."
</P>
<P>
Hudgins and others blamed CBS Sports and the NFL for the defeat after a
televised report Sunday said Arizona's Super Bowl would be moved if voters did
not approve the holiday. The news, which aired during halftime of the Phoenix
Cardinals-Miami Dolphins football game, was denied Monday by local Super Bowl
organizers.
</P>
<P>
But Hudgins said voters who perceived the announcement as "economic blackmail"
may have cast ballots opposing the holiday in protest of the threat.
</P>
<P>
However, other black leaders said the Super Bowl news could not have made that
big a difference. State Sen. Carolyn Walker, a Phoenix Democrat who is one of
three black legislators, said she knew the vote would be within a point or two.
</P>
<P>
"It simply proves what everyone outside the state has been saying about us. I
keep saying we are not racist and not bigoted. But the numbers show we are,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The King Day controversy was first thrust into the national spotlight by
then-Gov. Evan Mecham shortly after he took office in 1987 when he canceled a
paid King holiday established by his predecessor. Mecham, who was later
impeached and removed from office, proclaimed the third Sunday in January to be
King Day/Civil Rights Day.
</P>
<P>
In September, 1989, legislators approved a King holiday and eliminated the paid
Columbus Day holiday, a move that outraged Italian-Americans. A few days later
a petition drive was launched, which resulted in the soundly defeated
proposition creating a King Day at the expense of Columbus Day.
</P>
<P>
After Phoenix was awarded the 1993 Super Bowl in March, community leaders
lobbied for further action on the holiday in hopes of avoiding any problems
with the league. Legislators responded in May by passing another bill creating
a paid King Day as well as a paid Columbus Day.
</P>
<P>
But King Day foes, led by Mecham, launched another drive that placed that law
on the ballot for voter approval.
</P>
<P>
Walker said legislators could take up the issue again but they might be wise to
let the matter rest awhile. Leadership from the executive office could be
lacking, because although both gubernatorial candidates supported a paid King
holiday, that race was still up in the air.
</P>
<P>
Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard, a Democrat, and Phoenix developer Fife Symington,
a Republican, each garnered 49% of the vote Tuesday in the race for governor,
forcing an unprecedented runoff election which may not occur until spring.
</P>
<P>
Retiring Gov. Rose Mofford, the secretary of state who took office when Mecham
was impeached two years ago, was expected to stay on as a caretaker after her
term expires in January.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: INTERFERENCE: HOW ORGANIZED CRIME INFLUENCES PROFESSIONAL
FOOTBALL BY DAN E. MOLDEA (WILLIAM MORROW: $19.95; 436 PP.)
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"Most Americans," Dan E. Moldea says, "view sports as a vehicle of inspiration
and entertainment" -- and as something to bet on. The estimated 25 million
people who wager tens of billions of dollars on National Football League games
each year eagerly accept the NFL's assurances that these games are honest. They
don't know, or don't care, that the 10% "vigorish" that bookmakers charge on
losing NFL bets provides the underworld with more illegal gambling income than
all other sports combined. They prefer to believe that the league has
rigorously investigated gambling and drug scandals, that team owners are
sportsmen and that players always give their best. These are myths, Moldea
says, but "powerful forces in America have built empires around these myths."
</P>
<P>
The truth is quite different, according to Moldea, a veteran crime reporter
whose last book was "Dark Victory: Ronald Reagan, MCA and the Mob." The NFL
claims that gamblers have made only two attempts, both unsuccessful, to fix
games in the league's 60-year history. Instead, Moldea says, as many as 70
games may have been fixed outright or manipulated to affect the point spread
set by mob-connected oddsmakers. Even when games are honest, gamblers use their
close ties to the NFL to gain inside information. Widespread drug use by
players gives the mob even more leverage. What Moldea calls "the sweetheart
relationship between the federal government and the NFL" has reduced many a
promising investigation into the league's dirty secrets to the equivalent of
three downs and a punt.
</P>
<P>
"Interference," in contrast, is like a hard-nosed fullback, gracelessly written
but packed with names, dates and places, hitting the holes until the defense --
one's incredulity -- gives way. This is not the first time such accusations
have been hurled; longtime NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle dismissed a 1983 PBS
TV expose of the league as "a rehash of press clippings, gossip and rumor."
Moldea's targets could say the same, but the weight of evidence is
overwhelming. Moldea, shows, for example, how former Los Angeles Rams owner
Carroll Rosenbloom partnered mob figures in business throughout his career. He
was also a heavy gambler who, when he owned the Baltimore Colts, bet $1 million
on them to win the 1958 NFL championship game with the New York Giants -- a sum
that puts the recent Pete Rose baseball scandal in perspective. And Rosenbloom,
Moldea makes clear, was -- and would be today -- just one of the boys. Michael

   The question before the house, says Jim Finks, is whether a football team must "get good" before it can win, or win before it can get good.
He suspects that the latter of those propositions is true.

   That should come as good news to fans of the National Football League's New Orleans Saints, who need all the encouragement they can get.
In their 20 years of travail, the Saints have neither won nor gotten good, so it's nice to know that someone in authority (Finks is the Saints' president and general manager) thinks you can have one without the other.

   This also ought to buoy the Saints players, struggling through another purgatorial training camp at Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond, an hour north of their home base.
It's so steamy here that it's a daily tossup whether the temperature or humidity will top 90 first.

   "Kinda hot for two-a-day, huh, Rickey?" shouted a fan to Rickey Jackson, the Saints' veteran linebacker, as Jackson trudged onto the field Wednesday afternoon for the second of the day's workouts.
"Kinda hot for just one," Jackson grunted.

   In the near past, the Saints might have been excused for wondering what all the sweat was for.
They are the only team in the NFL that not only hasn't made the post-season playoffs, but also has never finished with a better-than-.500 won-lost record.
Last season, under new prexy Finks and new coach Jim Mora, they threatened respectability by winning six of their first 11 outings.
But they drooped to a 7-9 mark overall.

   Nevertheless, the showing was good enough to spark hope for the coming season.
"We had a touch of success, and because we're so young we gotta think we'll improve," says defensive back Dave Waymer, an eight-year veteran.
"At least, our fans wore regular caps at our games, not shopping bags."

   That last reference was to 1980, Waymer's rookie season and the Saints' nadir.
They posted a 1-15 record, and some of the folks who showed up for their games redubbed them the "Aints" and wore shopping bags over their heads in protest.
The gesture remains the team's main contribution to American sporting culture.

   The Saints then were the property of John Mecom Jr., the son of a wealthy oilman.
His regime began when New Orleans was awarded an NFL franchise in 1967 after some antitrust wheeling and dealing by Russell Long and Hale Boggs, the state's two congressional wheel-and-deal horses.
It was marked by what one former employee calls "unorganized chaos."

   Mecom changed coaches nine times in his 19 years as boss, almost as often as he traded in his limos.
Three of those coaches bore the dreaded "interim" label, and lasted 16 games all told.

   The Saints also distinguished themselves in that era for some eccentric drafting.
In 1979, they amazed and amused footballdom by using their No. 1 choice to draft barefoot punter Russell Erxleben of the University of Texas, who, it turned out, could punt in the pros neither barefoot nor shod.
Their top pick in 1982 was Lindsay Scott, a slow wide receiver from Georgia.
He was cut after four so-so seasons.
Also among the missing are quarterback Richard Todd and running back Earl Campbell, over-the-hill types that cost the Saints their No. 1 picks in 1984 and '85.

   Mecom made his best deal in mid-1985, when he sold the team for $70 million to a group headed by Tom Benson, an auto dealer.
Benson might have made his best deal six months later, when he hired Finks to run the team.
Finks is a respected football M.D. who previously had spanked life into the infant Minnesota Vikings and helped resuscitate the Chicago Bears.
He brings to his house calls a philosophy as well as his doctor's bag.

   "You build good teams from the inside out, starting with big linemen," Finks declares, opining that the 20-game NFL schedule (16 regular-season contests plus four pre-season outings) has turned the one-time autumn game into an endurance test.
He's backed that up by making Jim Dombrowski, a 6-foot-6, 290-pound offensive lineman, his No. 1 draft pick in 1986, and Shawn Knight, a 6-6, 290-pound defensive end, his top choice in '87 (alas, Knight is still unsigned).

   Finks says he also believes in surrounding himself with "honest" evaluators of talent because "you don't get ahead by kidding yourself," and the blunt-spoken Mora, his choice as head coach, seemingly fills that bill.

   "How good were we last year?" echoes Mora, whose teams won two titles in the old U.S. Football League.
"Not very good.
We could have been 5-11 as easily as 7-9.
But we accomplished a few things, like getting our rushing defense together and establishing our own ground game.
That gives us something to build on."

   The Saints defense is anchored by vets Jackson, defensive end Bruce Clark and nose tackle Tony Elliott.
It has been on offense that the Finks-Mora partnership has made itself felt most.
Rueben Mayes, a third-round draft choice out of Washington State, ran for 1,353 yards last year and was named NFL rookie of the year.
He'll be joined in the backfield this season by Dalton Hilliard, Mel Gray and Barry Word, all in their first or second seasons.

   Mora tapped his USFL connections for Chuck Commiskey, a large, (6-4, 290) quick guard, linebacker Sam Mills and safety Antonio Gibson, all starters.
None spent the last training camp with the Saints, so Mora considers them virtual NFL rookies.
The continued good health of Brad Edelman, an injury-plagued guard, would be another plus.

   The Saints have problems at quarterback and wide receiver, among other places, so their millennium probably isn't yet at hand.
But they at least have begun to think positively.
"When my neighbors in New Orleans bug me about 20 bad years, I remind them I've only been here five," says tight end John Tice.
"I also tell 'em that I'll only listen to their beefs if they promise to applaud me real loud when we turn it around."

   NEW YORK -- Neil R. Austrian, a managing director of the
investment-banking firm Dillon, Read &amp; Co., was named to the
new position of president of the National Football League.
   Mr. Austrian, 50 years old, will be responsible for the
league's business and financial operations, including all NFL
broadcasting, special events and other revenue-producing
activities. Mr. Austrian, who will assume his post this
spring, will also have responsibility for the NFL Films and
NFL Properties units.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The league said the creation of a presidency is part of
the reorganization of league operations approved by the 28
clubs in November. The reorganization followed a review of
league operations by consultants Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton. Mr.
Austrian will work closely with Commissioner Paul Tagliabue,
who supervises all league activities and determines league
policy.
   Mr. Austrian, a former chairman and chief executive of the
cable channels Showtime/The Movie Channel Inc., becomes the
second executive with an entertainment and media industry
background to assume a major position in professional sports.
Francis T. Vincent Jr., who had been chief executive at
Columbia Pictures Inc., is commissioner of Major League
Baseball.
   Mr. Austrian, who also has ad agency experience, said he
has been talking with Mr. Tagliabue about some issues
regarding the NFL and television, including the scrambling of
broadcast signals for some games into restaurants and
taverns.
   The appointment of Mr. Austrian, who is a self-described
football fan who grew up in the Bronx, N.Y., comes as the NFL
is also exploring the idea of delivering some games to
viewers on a pay-per-view basis by 1993. This is the final
year of the NFL's four-year, $3.6 billion contract with the
three major broadcast networks as well as two cable networks,
all-sports ESPN and the vintage movie-oriented TNT, a
subsidiary of Turner Broadcasting System Inc.
   The NFL has said the move to pay-per-view wouldn't replace
free broadcasts, nor include the Super Bowl or playoff games.

<LEADPARA>  Here's one more reason to hate Washington: The Redskins are 9 and 0.;   As if
bounced checks and bad restaurant debts weren't enough, the nation's capital
once again is conspiring to stick it to the 50 states.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  THE TEAM AMERICA LOVES TO HATE
WASHINGTON IS CRAZY ABOUT THE REDSKINS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     More than halfway through this National Football League season, the
Redskins are the lone unbeaten team -- the 13th team since World War II to go
9-0. If you thought folks here were talking about economic jump-starts --
well, they're talking Super Bowl.;   "We love our Redskins," said Stephen
Hess, a Brookings Institution scholar who usually studies government. "We're
crazy about 'em.";   The rest of the country apparently is not. The Redskins
may be blessed with the most passionate, single-minded hometown fans in pro
football, scholars and football observers say, but they will never be
America's Team.;   "People hate Washington," said Richard Lapchick, director
of the Center for the Study of Sport in Society in Boston. "They are fed up
with government, and Washington teams embody it.";   "They're the
establishment team," said Joe Horrigan of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in
Canton, Ohio.;   "They're the team of the permanent bureaucracy and
government," said Condoleezza Rice, a former member of the National Security
Council who teaches at Stanford University and follows the Cincinnati Bengals
and Denver Broncos.;   Heck, even the guy at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. doesn't
root for the Redskins. George Bush publicly picked the Houston Oilers to beat
the Redskins last Sunday at RFK Stadium. Like some of his other recent picks,
this one was wrong.;   That the town's most prominent resident would decide
that the astute choice was anti-Redskin, however, says something about the
team's appeal beyond the capital region -- or perhaps about Bush's concern
that the Redskins' name is, indeed, politically incorrect.;   "It definitely
hurts when the Bushman, the guy who lives here rent-free, says he wants
Houston to win," said Tony Kornheiser, a sports columnist for the Washington
Post. "If America's No. 1 fan, the guy who was born in nine different states,
turns his back on the neighborhood team, what are people supposed to think?";
 The NFL determines team popularity by calculating sales of licensed items
sold by its subsidiary, NFL Properties. Based on current numbers, the
undefeated Redskins rank only ninth in merchandise sold, said Ann McDowell,
senior licensing manager. The Raiders, 49ers and Giants lead the list.;   In
fact, in the previous eight years, the Redskins never have ranked first, she
said.;   "That's nine out of 28 teams!" Jack Kent Cooke, who owns the
Redskins, said about this year's rankings. "I think the Redskins are
tremendously popular.";   As for the city's bleak image rubbing off on his
team, "the football team transcends the alleged -- the alleged! --
unpopularity of Washington" is all Cooke will say on the record.;   But Cooke
himself blurs the line between the team and its political environs by filling
his box with establishment heavies. For instance, in attendance for the
Redskins' 16-13 overtime victory over Houston were Vice President Dan Quayle,
conservative columnist George Will and Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, a
Democratic presidential candidate. Checking out the occupants in Cooke's box
is itself a Washington sport.;   Like Bush, many people who have worked in the
White House support teams other than the Redskins, Stanford's Rice said.;
"Everyone is a transplant," she said. "They don't glom onto the Redskins the
way Congress does. It's another example of split government.";   For the rest
of Washington, there are few split loyalties. The Redskins are icons, selling
out their 55,000-seat stadium this season, as they have since 1966.;   In a
city divided by party identification, class, race and crime -- a city without
a major league baseball team -- the Redskins remain the single common thread,
say people who live here.;   "They may be the only unifying force," said Wes
Heppler, an attorney who moved here 11 years ago from Detroit and still roots
for the Lions. "I've never seen a city that devotes so much press time, air
time -- so much time -- to a sports team.";   Some of that coverage is now
focusing on the Redskins' name, which Webster's Dictionary lists as an
offensive term. American Indian groups intend to protest outside each
remaining home game. But Cooke's son, John Cooke, recently told the Washington
Post, "We're keeping the name.";   With anti-Washington sentiment at perhaps a
record high, naming capital teams won't become any easier, either.;   "If a
baseball team ever comes back to Washington," said Brookings scholar Hess,
"believe me, it will not be called the Senators."  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  PROFESSIONAL; FOOTBALL; COLLECTIBLE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  A NEW football card set that represents a major project by NFL Properties will
be issued this year, two sources connected to the league revealed last week.;
  The set will be called ProLine Portraits, and the cards will be designed as
an upscale product to rival the quality of the cards from Upper Deck, which
will issue a football set under licenses from the NFL and NFL Players
Association (NFLPA).  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  MORE CARDS FLOOD MARKET  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Collectors' Connection  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The sources, who asked for anonymity, emphasized that the set is being
created and controlled by the NFL, although Pro Set, another licensee, will be
involved in the manufacturing and distribution.;    The NFL's control is
significant because the league needed to sign up players -- to buy their
rights -- and by doing that, the league has moved into territory previously
controlled by the NFLPA.;    The willingness of players to cooperate with
league management could spell disaster for the NFLPA, which may find its
licensing fees and merchandising royalties severely undercut by management
projects. Fees and royalties have been the financial lifeblood of the NFLPA
and critical to funding litigation against the league.;    Until recently,
licensing control basically was divided, with logo and design rights belonging
to the league and player rights belonging to the NFLPA. But the league took a
major step in a new direction earlier this year when it signed 11 quarterbacks
for endorsement deals, and the two sources said last week that there already
are about 100 players in the fold for the ProLine cards.;    ProLine cards
also may prove to be an economic challenge to consumers. Although one source
said ProLine is expected to have a lower retail price than Upper Deck, the
problem for collectors is the proliferation of brands. Every season, budgets
have to expand substantially to accommodate a complete collection of football
cards.;    Last season, the principal national sets were issued by Action
Packed, Fleer, Pro Set, Score and Topps. Those sets will return for the 1991
season, accompanied by ProLine, Upper Deck and a set from Pacific Trading
Cards (a Lynnwood, Wash., company), based on a license the NFL announced at
the end of March.;    As recently as 1988, Topps had the national market to
itself.;    In the style of Pro Set, the Dallas-based company that shares
ownership of a manufacturing plant with NFL Properties, the ProLine set will
include some kind of prize system that gives collectors a chance at
memorabilia. Pro Set, for example, has given away such items as a Joe
Montana-autographed helmet.;    Still, the key question remains whether the
marketplace can support what seems to be a glut of card products. The research
done by NFL Properties must have predicted a very healthy collecting
environment for at least the near future.;  WLAF CARDS: One of the features of
Pro Set's 1991 set will be 32 World League of American Football cards,
including cards for the head coach and a quarterback from each team. There
also will be a card for Mike Lynn, the league president.  </TEXT>

NFL'S OWNERS IN RIFT?;
</P>
<P>
THEY MAY SPLIT OVER COMMITTEE'S CHOICE OF FINKS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fight between the National Football League's two principal factions is likely
Thursday if an NFL committee persists in its plans to recommend a new
commissioner at that time, a club owner said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hugh Culverhouse, president of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, said that many of the
league's newer owners are bitter over two of this week's developments:
</P>
<P>
 -- The selection committee's unanimous endorsement of Jim Finks, general
manager of the New Orleans Saints, to succeed Pete Rozelle.
</P>
<P>
 -- The plan to round up NFL owners on less than a week's notice for a special
meeting to choose the commissioner Thursday in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
"I'm outraged that they would unanimously recommend Jim Finks," Culverhouse
said. "They said they would present three or four names -- and they come up
with one man.
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, it's an outrage to call a league meeting for July 6 on six days'
notice. That's two days after a four-day holiday -- a holiday for which many
people made travel plans long ago.
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I'm leaving as planned for South America tomorrow. Other (owners)
are overseas or out of town. It's inexcusable for them to call (a meeting) at
this time.
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the most important NFL meeting any of us will ever attend --
after all, we're selecting a commissioner -- and they call it on unbelievably
short notice. That's arrogance."
</P>
<P>
Other owners made similar points but asked not to be quoted.
</P>
<P>
The co-chairmen of the selection committee, Lamar Hunt of the Kansas City
Chiefs and Wellington Mara of the New York Giants, were unavailable, as was
Finks.
</P>
<P>
All were observing a long weekend over one of the few national holidays
available to pro football people, who, Culverhouse noted, play games during
many of the other holiday periods.
</P>
<P>
Unable to reach the chairmen, Culverhouse, saying he was speaking for several
of the newer owners, wired both Mara and Hunt to express discontent.
</P>
<P>
" 'I urge you to reconsider your plans,' " he said.
</P>
<P>
Finks has been called the favorite of the NFL's old guard.
</P>
<P>
The other faction is largely made up of owners who have come into the NFL in
recent years. Eight clubs have changed hands in just the 1980s -- Denver,
Philadelphia, San Diego, New Orleans, Seattle, Minnesota, New England and
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of these teams, who paid up to $100 million apiece for
franchises, say their problems are much different from the problems of the
old-guard owners, some of whom paid little or nothing for their franchises in a
different era.
</P>
<P>
The newer group is concerned that Finks or any other old-guard choice might
ignore them and their large debt structures.
</P>
<P>
If Finks is the only candidate endorsed, they said they'll nominate a candidate
of their own at the Chicago meeting, precipitating a fight.
</P>
<P>
It takes 19 of 28 owners' votes to elect.
</P>
<P>
"When the (selection) committee was named at the spring meeting (in March),
they said they'd come up with several (candidates) for us to (consider),"
Culverhouse said. "That's what we want."
</P>
<P>
Asked what he expects if Finks' name is the only one presented, Culverhouse
said: "The (old guard) will be in deep trouble."
</P>
<P>
It's a sore point because, to begin with, the new owners' faction was bitter
that none of them was named to the selection committee.
</P>
<P>
"That committee represents one point of view," said Norman Braman, owner of the
Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Hunt and Mara, the selection group includes Art Modell of
Cleveland, Ralph Wilson of Buffalo, Dan Rooney of Pittsburgh and Robert Parins
of Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
"When the committee was named, I was afraid of something like this," a younger
owner said.
</P>
<P>
Culverhouse said: "I think they should postpone the meeting for a week or
schedule it to coincide with a (special Chicago) meeting already scheduled for
July 18."
</P>
<P>
Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie, set to leave for Europe Sunday, said his plans
were now unsettled.

OREGON IGNORES SUIT, BEGINS BETTING ON NBA

The Oregon Lottery's venture into sports with wagering on professional football
expanded today into basketball over strong protests and a lawsuit from the
league.
</P>
<P>
The new version of the betting game Sports Action includes outcomes of the
weekend's National Basketball Assn. contests. (See Durslag, C3.)
</P>
<P>
The lottery has been operating the weekly Sports Action game based on National
Football League contests since Sept. 6. The new version of the game will
include both football and basketball until the NFL playoffs end in late
January.
</P>
<P>
Sports Action tickets go on sale each Wednesday for the coming weekend's games.
</P>
<P>
Lottery Director Jim Davey said Tuesday that the new version of the game was
all set despite the fact that the NBA took legal action last week seeking to
prohibit sales.
</P>
<P>
No restraining order was requested in the lawsuit brought in federal court in
Eugene, and Davey said no date has been set for a court hearing.
</P>
<P>
"The game is on," he said, urging bettors not to hold back because of the legal
cloud.
</P>
<P>
"People shouldn't hesitate in buying tickets because of the lawsuit," Davey
said. "It's not going to impact them one way or the other."
</P>
<P>
The NFL protested when the lottery began its football game, the only one of its
kind in the country, but did not take legal action.
</P>
<P>
The NBA argues that the game will unfairly exploit the league's property
rights, infringe on trademarks and violate federal gambling laws and state
constitutional provisions.
</P>
<P>
The betting system for NBA-related games is the same as for the football game:
About 14 basketball games will be listed on each weekend's betting lineup. Bets
will be based on point spreads developed by a Las Vegas odds maker. Bettors can
wager at least $1 on three to 14 games.
</P>
<P>
The Portland Trail Blazers are not included in the game in what Davey said was
a courtesy to the home state team.

FT  03 SEP 94 / Sport: 49ers make the cap fit - American Football
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new American football year opens tomorrow, but if there was a prize for
the best performance during the off-season, the National Football League
would have crowned its champions already: the San Francisco 49ers.
Not because the 49ers had the best pre-season record. They won three out of
four games, but two teams, the Chicago Bears and Indianapolis Colts, went
undefeated in exhibition games.
But because of the team management's accomplishment in adding a formidable
group of talented veterans to one of the most highly-paid rosters in the
sport while keeping the payroll under the limit imposed by the NFL's new
salary cap.
The salary cap is the cause of the US professional baseball players' strike.
Unlike their counterparts in football, baseball players are not prepared to
accept a limit on their pay. The NFL players' union last year accepted a
ceiling on the total each team could pay its players in return for securing
free agency - which allows players to move teams after a certain period in
the league.
The difference between the NFL's salary cap and the cap proposed by the
baseball owners, is the flexibility of the NFL system. There is a lot of
'wiggle room' under the football cap, and no one has proved more adept at
wiggling than the 49ers.
At the end of last year, the team's total payroll exceeded Dollars 40m. It
seemed that they had to reduce salaries and / or shed players to fit under
the Dollars 34.6m (Pounds 22m) cap the NFL had set for the 1994 season.
Today, however, the 49ers have all their top players from last year on
long-term contracts, including stars such as quarterback Steve Young and
wide receiver Jerry Rice. And they have five new players, each an
established NFL star - on extended contracts. Yet the 49ers team payroll has
dropped from more than Dollars 40m to Dollars 34.59m, just under the salary
cap.
How did they do it? They started late last year by hurriedly signing several
key players to lucrative 'front-loaded' long-term contracts, which paid the
players a lot of money for the 1993 season, and considerably less for
subsequent ones. By paying out so much money in 1993, before the cap came
into effect, the 49ers left themselves considerable room to sign new players
for 1994, year-one of the salary cap.
In basketball - the other sport with an existing salary cap - teams have
fallen foul of the league authorities with this kind of creative accounting,
but in football, the wiggle room leaves plenty of scope for creativity. As
Carmen Policy, president of the 49ers, put it: 'We wanted to be the hunters,
not the hunted. We wanted to do what we could to manipulate the system,
rather than have it control us.'
After anchoring many of their best players to the team, the 49ers went
hunting. They bagged several top free agents, including Super Bowl winners
Ken Norton of the Dallas Cowboys and Richard Dent of the Chicago Bears, and
veterans Rickey Jackson of the New Orleans Saints and Bart Oates of the New
York Giants. It was no coincidence that all of the new signings were
defenders, for the defence has been the chief weakness of the
attack-oriented 49ers for the past few seasons.
Some of the money needed to pay the newcomers came from the release of
well-paid reserve players, including Steve Bono, the back-up quarterback who
so often deputised for injured stars such as Joe Montana and Steve Young.
Also, the 49ers chose to hire a lot of relatively cheap 'rookie' players
fresh from university teams.
The result is a well-balanced team, a favourite to reach the Super Bowl in
January. The only likely obstacle is the defending champions, the Cowboys,
who beat the 49ers in the last two National Football Conference finals. The
Cowboys, however, have lost their coach, Jimmy Johnson and several leading
players including Norton.
Yet, the 49ers' policy of squeezing so much expensive talent under the
salary cap involves a risk. Because the 49ers have let go so many veteran
reserves and replaced them with mostly untested players, a team that was
once renowned for its 'depth' now has little insurance if its stars get
injured. And in the NFL, that is quite a gamble.

OREGON GETTING SET FOR WAGERING ON NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE GAMES
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a couple of weeks, a new football season opens in Oregon. Fans will walk up
to counters around the state, plunk down a dollar, make a few choices and leave
with a ticket -- their lottery ticket.
</P>
<P>
Before this summer, the National Football League and the state of Oregon
probably were never mentioned in the same sentence. Then along came a new,
controversial lottery and the result is a war of words over the ideals and
realities of U.S. sports, a war that yet may land another professional sport in
court.
</P>
<P>
The Oregon lottery game, approved by the state's lottery commission and
seconded by the state's legislators in July, is called Sports Action. For as
little as a dollar and up to $20 a card, players pick four to 14 NFL games
against the point spread. Picking four games correctly will pay about $8 on a
$1 card. Fourteen of 14 is expected to pay about $8,000.
</P>
<P>
Oregon Lottery officials predict sales of $10 million to $30 million this
season. And after paying off winners and administrative costs, the lottery's
proceeds will go to the athletic departments of the state's seven universities
and colleges. Between $4 million and $9 million is expected to benefit college
sports in the state, with a potential $3 million apiece going to the University
of Oregon and Oregon State this year.
</P>
<P>
The NFL hates this. It is on record as being opposed to gambling on its games,
even though point spreads are an unmistakable part of newspaper statistics and
televised network football broadcasts. And the fact that the money goes to fund
college sports makes matters even worse, according to the league.
</P>
<P>
"We view it as a change in the traditional stance that colleges have taken in
opposition to legalized gambling," said NFL spokesman Joe Browne. "We're all
for full funding of athletic programs, but not for piggybacking on NFL games in
this way."
</P>
<P>
Administrators of both the lottery and college athletic departments in Oregon
love it. Gambling is a fact of life, they say, and their game is small change
to the big money of Las Vegas bookmaking. They are happy to take whatever they
can get.
</P>
<P>
"It's terrific," said Oregon Athletic Director Bill Byrne. "We have the only
state legislature in the country that chose not to fund women's sports when
Title IX was instituted, so we had to drop swimming and baseball to add women's
programs in 1980. Those sports won't come back because of this, but the money
certainly will help us. All this is, really, is a state-run office pool. I have
no problem at all accepting the money."
</P>
<P>
The NFL still is considering legal action, Browne said, but it must act fast:
The season starts Sept. 10. NFL attorney James B. Noel recently met with Jim
Davey, director of the Oregon Lottery, to find out the specifics of the
lottery.
</P>
<P>
"Now we see where we go next," Browne said.
</P>
<P>
Faced with a similar situation in 1976 in Delaware, the NFL sued and lost, but
the lottery went under during the appeals process. Projected revenues of $6
million to $8 million fell far short; the lottery did about $700,000 in
business.
</P>
<P>
But the Delaware lottery was different from the new Oregon lottery. Delaware
had predetermined winnings, while Oregon is going to use a parimutuel payout
system, meaning that winners receive a share of the prize pool. Also Delaware
officials set their own point spreads; Oregon officials plan to use a Las Vegas
oddsmaker. This, the folks in Oregon say, will lead to more realistic odds.
</P>
<P>
"I think they might be successful, just on a smaller scale than Las Vegas,"
said Mike Tenay, a supervisor at the race and sports book of the Gold Coast
Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. "It's the office pool, only larger stakes. I
like the idea."
</P>
<P>
In a 1977 opinion in a federal court in Delaware, Judge Walter K. Stapleton
said that betting on NFL games had been going on so long without damaging the
league or its reputation that there was no reason to stop the Delaware lottery.
But, Browne said, the NFL "felt very strong" about its chances on appeal when
the lottery folded and the case was dropped.
</P>
<P>
Since then favorable decisions on trademark and licensing issues "would help
our case, we feel, if we do go to litigation," Browne said.
</P>
<P>
But Davey said the lottery commission is aware of those concerns and has been
careful to avoid conflicts with the NFL in its new game.
</P>
<P>
"We use no team nicknames, no team colors, no team uniforms," Davey said. "It
will just say Washington and Dallas, with the point spread. That's it."
</P>
<P>
The advertising also is generic. Posters appear at the counter showing football
players in nondescript uniforms.
</P>
<P>
There also is a disclaimer saying the game is not sponsored or promoted by the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
"If the NFL is so concerned about gambling, why don't they go into Nevada and
clean that out? We have $1 bets. They have $1 million bets. Go after the big
boys, then come after us," Davey said.
</P>
<P>
The problem isn't Oregon, but the developing trend that has the NFL all worked
up. Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia conduct lotteries, but
none, save Delaware, ever involved professional team sports.
</P>
<P>
"We are not concerned about the two senior citizens in Oregon putting down $1
on a gambling sheet," said Browne. "What we are concerned about is what this
will lead to."
</P>
<P>
Lottery officials in Kentucky are talking about a similar game, and New
Hampshire and Massachusetts are interested. "We don't want to see this
throughout the 50 states," said Browne.
</P>
<P>
The amount of money gambled on sports in this country in a year is staggering:
an estimated $20 billion to $40 billion. Counting non-sports betting, estimates
range to more than $200 billion, with approximately $40 billion going through
illegal bookmakers, Davey said.
</P>
<P>
"We don't think we're expanding gambling at all," he said.
</P>
<P>
What bothers the NFL is the thought that fans, betting legally, will be more
concerned about the point spread than about their team winning or losing. As
for Las Vegas, the sports books were doing business "when we were simply a
cottage industry," Browne said.
</P>
<P>
"The lottery commission says the state will reap the benefits that now go to
the neighborhood bookie," he said. "Well, if people believe that, I've got a
bridge in New York I'd like to sell them. This state-approved lottery allows no
credit, no tax-free earnings and gives smaller odds and smaller payoffs than a
bookie. Rather than taking business away from a bookie, lotteries like this
will just produce a new generation of gamblers in America."
</P>
<P>
"You have to laugh a little bit at the NFL's argument," retorted Byrne, who
said the estimated $3 million that the Oregon athletic department will receive
will just about cover the cost of non-revenue sports this year.
</P>
<P>
"They raise the specter of the evils of gambling on a $1 bet. I've heard them
mention organized crime. It's just a little bit ridiculous. I haven't heard the
NFL complain about oddsmakers on TV. They seem to enjoy the broadcasting
revenue. They don't complain about point spreads in the paper."
</P>
<P>
Byrne also said it's not a novel idea for money bet on state lotteries to be
sent to state colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
"We will fund our faculty salaries from video poker," he said. "A $50 million
science center is under construction at the University of Oregon, thanks to the
lottery. The $100 million Portland Convention Center too. If it's perfectly all
right for the lottery to fund these things, why not help the athletic programs
too?"

NFL MAY HAVE ITS MAN, AND NOT KNOW IT

For better or worse, the National Football League committee searching for the
next Pete Rozelle hopes to find him tonight.
</P>
<P>
Only it won't know -- for sure -- that he's the one.
</P>
<P>
At this stage, the next commissioner will merely be classed with eight or 10
other finalists, Wellington Mara, co-chairman of the search committee, said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We'll get the final group down (from nearly 50 candidates) when the committee
meets (tonight) in New Orleans," said Mara, president of the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
"We're going into this meeting with fewer than 10 names. And we expect that
there will be fewer than 10 (others) submitted by the professional search firm
that's working with us.
</P>
<P>
"There won't be any new candidates after (today).
</P>
<P>
"I can't get into names or exact numbers, but we've asked the search firm
(Heidrick and Struggles) to evaluate them all. Next, after we choose the
(finalists), the search firm and perhaps some (NFL people) will interview them
all.
</P>
<P>
"Then the committee will make one or two or three recommendations to the clubs
at a special election meeting. If we stay on target, the election will be next
month."
</P>
<P>
The search committee members have agreed to mention no names but other NFL
people say former Congressman Jack Kemp is still the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
"Kemp is the one candidate who would have a chance to get quick approval," one
source said. "Kemp has no enemies.
</P>
<P>
"But he personalizes the dilemma facing the owners. On the one hand, you've got
to have something on the ball to get as far as he has -- powerful congressman,
(Republican) candidate for president, secretary of housing and urban
development.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, what do we really know about Jack Kemp? You don't know
anybody until you know them -- you personally see how quick they are.
</P>
<P>
"The league is totally flying in the dark in this. I don't care how careful you
are, you could make a whale of a mistake."
</P>
<P>
The only in-house candidate seems to be Jim Finks, the general manager of the
New Orleans Saints, and at 62, Finks is Rozelle's age.
</P>
<P>
The only other candidate with NFL connections is Washington lawyer Paul
Tagliabue, who often represents the league.
</P>
<P>
There is a possibility that more than one man will be chosen, as
co-commissioner or a commissioner and one or two deputy commissioners, because
there is a consensus in the league that the job has become too much for one
man.
</P>
<P>
Other business to be considered will include the new 80-player roster limit and
the direction of the NFL's new international league.
</P>
<P>
More than half the clubs are concerned about the roster limit, which they say
should be lifted to a more realistic 85 or more. An effort will be made to
raise it.
</P>
<P>
The Worldwide American Football League, as the new league is being called by
Commissioner Tex Schramm, has caused a bit of a split. Some NFL club owners
want the WAFL to be an NFL subsidiary. Others want WAFL investors to be
individual NFL club owners, not the NFL itself.

<HL> NFL's TV Contract
Expected to Bolster
Profits at Networks

Accord Totals $1.43 Billion;
ESPN's 13-Game Portion
Is Gamble for Cable Firm

   The National Football League's new $1.43 billion television contract is expected to help bolster network profits, but it is a gamble for ESPN Inc.

   The NFL said it has approved a new three-year contract with CBS Inc., National Broadcasting Co. and Capital Cities/ABC Inc. for rights to air NFL games.
The NFL also agreed to sell rights for 13 games to ESPN, a 24-hour cable sports programming service that is 80% owned by Capital Cities/ABC.

   Overall, the new package reduces rights fees to the NFL by about 3%, to about $476 million annually, from about $490 million in 1986, the final year of a five-year, $2.1 billion contract with the networks.

   The networks had been seeking a reduction in fees in the face of a soft advertising market for sports programs and declining viewership of games.
Last year, the networks had losses totaling about $75 million on broadcasts of NFL games, though they made a slight profit on the overall five-year package, industry sources said.

   Network executives hope the transaction will be a benchmark in future negotiations for other sports rights fees, including major league baseball, which is currently in the middle of a six-year contract.

   Kenneth D. Schanzer, executive vice president at NBC Sports, said the NFL's willingness to reduce fees "is significant beyond measure because it augurs a new climate in the sports television marketplace.
The NFL has historically been the bell cow."

   Under the contract, CBS will continue to broadcast Sunday games, though its rights fees will fall more than 6% from the last year of the previous agreement to about $150 million annually.
NBC, a General Electric Co. unit, also will continue to air Sunday games, but sources say its fee was cut more than 10% to about $120 million annually because of weaker viewership of its package.

   ABC will pay about $115 million each year -- about flat from a year earlier on a per-game basis -- for 16 "Monday Night Football" broadcasts, but it dropped five "special" games that were aired under the old contract.
ESPN bought rights for eight regular-season Sunday night games, four exhibition games and the Pro Bowl for about $50 million a year, sources said.

   The NFL considered bids from several cable concerns as it sought to make up the revenue it expected to lose from the networks.
"This is the toe in the water for cable with the NFL," acknowledged one network executive who asked not to be identified.
"The league -- as it looks ahead long-term, like all other sports leagues -- thinks cable is where it is at."

   But the transaction is a gamble for ESPN, which currently reaches 41 million homes through about 4,000 cable systems.
ESPN hopes to cover the cost of the contract through advertising revenue and increased subscriber fees, which are paid by cable system operators.
But it will have to compete for viewers against network prime-time programming.

   Roger Werner, executive vice president of ESPN, said the increase in the current subscriber fee of 27 cents a month would be "substantially less than 20 cents per subscriber per month."
If the charge was 10 cents a month for all 41 million homes, for example, the resulting $49.2 million a year would come close to covering ESPN's rights payments.

   ESPN is expecting a rating of nine to 10 for its NFL games, more than double the ratings of its college football broadcasts.
One rating point equals 874,000 homes with televisions.

   Mr. Werner said he assumes advertising rates on ESPN's NFL broadcasts will be slightly less than for comparable network games, but those rates will still be the highest ever for cable telecasts.
The highest advertising rate ESPN has charged was $12,000 to $14,000 per 30 seconds on its Saturday night college football broadcasts.

   The pet product industry's annual trade show is
not a place dogs would find rough, rough, rough.
   It's a world where dogs strut in T-shirts and neon sun visors,
fish live in designer aquariums and birds eat from National
Football League helmet feeders.
   The 485 booths at the American Pet Products Manufacturers
Association show have such standard fare as pet foods, Kitty Litter
and bird cages, but also offbeat items.
   There is a full line of NFL-licensed items that identify pets
with their favorite team _ or at least the team of their owner.
   ``It's important to get kids and adults to think about their
pets and bring them into the family, not just look at them as
disposable things,'' said Karen Long MacLeod, editor of the trade
publication Pet Age. ``Those products are designed to keep pets
healthy and to have fun.''
   Anne McDowell, senior licensing manager for NFL Properties Inc.,
said the idea for the NFL pet products came from a dinner party
attended by a league official in Pittsburgh, where the hosts had
knit a Steelers sweater for their dog.
   When the NFL decided to sanction pet products bearing team
logos, Ms. McDowell said, ``We decided, don't do it piecemeal. Go
all the way. Let's do everything.''
   Animal T-shirts, sweaters, dinner bowls, beds, collars and bird
feeders all bear NFL insignias.
   There's a variety pack of rawhide chews in the shapes of
helmets, footballs, jerseys and pennants.
   The three-day show was ending today.

<HL> Cable Crossroads: ESPN Will Soon Learn
Whether NFL Football Can Score Profits

   For months, William Grimes has been telling anyone who would listen that the National Football League would be the hottest piece of programming ever to hit cable television.

   Now that ESPN Inc., the cable sports network Mr. Grimes heads, has won a piece of the professional football pie, will his prophecy hold true?
Stay tuned for about eight months.
By then, cable operators, advertisers and ultimately, the viewing public will let Mr. Grimes know if he is a visionary.

   For now, he is basking in the considerable glow cast by the biggest programming jewel in the history of cable television.
"The NFL remains, year-in and year-out, the most watched sport on television," says ESPN's president.
"It's the only sport that hasn't been on cable."

   In the current television market, however, prestige takes a back seat to profits.
When ESPN's sales force starts swarming on cable operators and advertisers next Monday with the network's plan for televising 13 Sunday night games -- including four pre-season and eight regular season games plus the Pro Bowl -- the network will begin finding out whether it can make money on the NFL.

   "We'll make money," Mr. Grimes says.
"Not a lot . . .."

   ESPN only got the NFL because the crummy market for sports advertising caused the three broadcast networks to lose an estimated $75 million on NFL telecasts last season.
When they insisted on cutbacks in the NFL's lifeline -- the rights fees that provide about 60% of each team's revenue -- the league turned to ESPN, which is 80%-owned by Capital Cities/ABC Inc., to make up the difference.

   The network was happy to oblige.
Landing the NFL just about completes ESPN's transformation into a major programming force from what a rival cable operator once described as "24 hours a day of underwater Australian wrist wrestling."

   But unlike some high-exposure sports such as college football and professional hockey, ESPN's Australian Rules Football and fishing shows make money.
The network will charge its affiliated cable systems extra for the NFL package in hopes that the revenue will cover the $153 million rights fee it paid for three years.
Still, for the network to turn a profit after a production and promotion budget estimated by some at $10 million this season, advertisers will have to pay more than they ever have for commercial spots on cable.

   Cable operators will be the network's first target.
They currently carry ESPN into 38 million homes. (Another three million satellite-dish owners get the service free; that will end in mid-June when ESPN begins scrambling its signal.)

   A bigger audience base means higher advertising rates and lower costs to the operators, Mr. Grimes explains.
If all the affiliates sign up for the NFL package, he estimates, they will pay an added 10 cents a subscriber each month to ESPN; if only 70% sign on, the fee goes up to 15 cents.

   Mr. Grimes argues that system operators will recoup their investments from local advertising-ESPN is alloting them 40% of the games' commercial rights, twice as much as usual -- as well as from new subscriptions.

   ESPN says its telephone survey of non-cable subscribers in cable-connected areas projects a one- to two-percentage-point gain in market penetration because of the NFL.
"That could be a substantial increase in revenues," Mr. Grimes says.

   Still, larger cable operators are expected to drive hard bargains.
Some have already asked for a share of the revenue ESPN will get by selling local broadcast rights to over-the-air TV stations in the participating teams' markets each week.
The NFL demanded the local-rights sales to avoid stirring up antitrust sentiment in Congress. (In the event that the home team doesn't sell out at least 72 hours before the game, both the local outlet and ESPN will be blacked out in that city.)

   In preliminary talks with cable operators, Mr. Grimes says, "we have said we will consider giving back a certain part of that money, since it does diminish somewhat the value of the package to the operators."
Most are expected to sign up.

   Says Barry Frank, a television consultant and former network executive: "I don't think any cable operator in his right mind will be able to resist the will of the people in his area.
As soon as people realize they're not getting these games, it will be a cause celebre and people will be storming the station."

   The network hopes to reach most of the larger operators by mid-May; then, ESPN will offer all-day presentations at the fiveday National Cable Television Association convention in Las Vegas in hopes of reaching the rest of the industry.
By June or July, he says, the network needs to know its audience base so it can begin serious negotiations with advertisers.

   ESPN's sales department is already fielding calls from advertisers, particularly after the announcement last week of what looks like a strong schedule, featuring eight of last year's ten playoff teams and several other perennial contenders.
The network expects as much as a 10.0 rating for its eight regular-season games (one rating point equals 411,000 homes for ESPN), which would top its previous high rating of 8.0 for a St. John's-Georgetown University basketball game.

   The highest advertising rates ever charged by ESPN were $12,000 to $14,000 for a 30-second spot on its prime-time college-football telecasts.
For the NFL, ESPN will seek $40,000 to $50,000 for a 30-second spot.
By comparison, ABC is expected to ask $200,000 for a 30-second spot on Monday Night Football.
Last season, the weak market forced ABC to sell some spots at a discount.
Mr. Grimes says ESPN's cost to advertisers of $10 to $11 per thousand viewers will be comparable to ABC's.

   ESPN officials hope that because it plans to sell only 60% of the games' commercial time itself -- 36 half-minute-spots -- national advertisers will be standing in line to get the limited time.
But some advertising agency officials argue that it may be difficult to draw a big audience to a third Sunday football slot that competes against the networks' prime-time schedules.
And half of ESPN's regular season games will involve teams from one of the three largest television markets.
Sale of those rights to local carriers could diminish the value of ESPN's commercial time, they say.

   "I just think $40,000 is a lot for them to get," says Paul Isacsson, executive vice president of the Young &amp; Rubicam agency.
Mr. Grimes counters that even in the worst case less than 10% of ESPN's overall audience base will be affected.

   Another agency executive wonders whether advertisers will rob Peter to pay Mr. Grimes.
"Am I going to take it from my network scatter budget, my prime-time or sports budgets or my cable budget?" he asks.
"I don't think you're going to see many advertisers say we're going to make new money available to ESPN. Somebody's going to be a loser."

   Are we a nation governed by laws or judges?
While the issues of this great debate are complex, one cannot deny an unfortunate tendency of many federal judges to decide cases based on personal policy preferences.
This is well illustrated in antitrust cases challenging the draft and reserve rules of professional sports leagues.

   Player-union antipathy for these rules, which limit the ability of players to choose the team they will play for, has resulted in bitter collective bargaining, strikes and antitrust lawsuits.
Such suits are pending in New Jersey against the National Basketball Association (Bridgeman v.
NBA) and in Minneapolis against the National Football League (Powell v.
NFL).
Preliminary rulings in both cases indicate that, as in earlier cases, the law may not determine the result.

   Three federal statutes unequivocally require that labor disputes be resolved by collective bargaining, not in antitrust courts.
The 1914 Clayton Antitrust Act states that "the labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce," and thus restraints only on labor cannot be subject to antitrust attack.
The Norris-LaGuardia Act of 1932 expressly prohibits federal courts from entering injunctive orders in any "case involving or growing out of a labor dispute."
And the 1935 Wagner (or National Labor Relations) Act, as amended by Taft-Hartley in 1948, mandates that employers and employees bargain in good faith over all "terms and conditions of employment," and that the government and its courts refrain from any substantive involvement in that process or the resolution of such matters.

   The law could not be clearer.
Disputes between employers and employees must be worked out in private collective bargaining, with each side using whatever economic or political leverage it can muster.
Employers can lock employees out.
Employees can strike.
Both sides can appeal to public and political sentiment.
The union can ask its sympathizers to use their influence in bringing pressure on management.
Short of committing unfair labor practices, each party may do whatever it can to improve the final agreement.

   But Congress has thrice prohibited federal courts from resolving such labor disputes or involving themselves in the bargaining process under the guise of a claimed antitrust restraint of labor, even if the court believes the relative bargaining strengths to be unequal or any agreement reached to be unfair to either side.

   The Bridgeman and Powell cases would not be the first instances of courts disregarding the law in order to aid professional athletes.
In the mid-1970s, a federal court held in Mackey v.
NFL that the old NFL reserve system (the "Rozelle Rule") violated the antitrust rule of reason.
To get around the three statues that ban such suits, the court stated that the proscription on judicial interference in labor disputes applies only if the union has included the reserve rule in a collective-bargaining agreement.
Without such a union agreement, the court said, courts are free to intervene.
The union subsequently agreed to a modified reserve rule, so Mackey was not appealed.
Since then, various courts have reiterated the Mackey ruling in upholding restrictive player rules contained in collective bargaining agreements.
It was never clear, however, how the contrived Mackey limitation on the bar to judicial interference in labor disputes would apply after a CBA had expired.

   The current NBA and NFL player suits were filed in the hope that a judge would compound the Mackey error and intrude into the private labor-management process after, as well as before, the collective bargaining agreement.
Since the players in the NBA and NFL suits could not win everything they wanted in collective bargaining after their old agreements expired, they now want an antitrust court to give it to them. (To enhance the chance for success, the NBA players even temporarily decertified their union to make the Bridgeman case appear less like a labor dispute.)
Early rulings in both cases suggest a judicial willingness to disregard the law again.
These rulings state that the ban on judicial involvement in shaping employment terms (the so-called labor antitrust exemption) disappears as soon as it becomes clear either that the league cannot obtain union consent for its rules (the NBA case) or that the parties are at a bargaining "impasse."

   There is nothing in the language or underlying policy of the three proscriptive statutes that justifies either of these limitations on the exemption.
It is judicial arrogation of lawmaking power in clear disregard of congressional enactments.
Further, these new "interpretations" create incentives that are destructive of the congressionally mandated bargaining process.

   If, as the courts ruled, the exemption ends as soon as the parties reach some kind of stalemate, no players union will ever make any compromises or concessions in bargaining.
A union will take the hardest line at the bargaining table, never budge, and when the inevitable impasse is reached, it will ask the courts to give them what they couldn't achieve through the process mandated by the labor laws.
Employment terms won't be hammered out at a private bargaining table, as the National Labor Relations Act requires.
Instead, either they will be imposed by antitrust courts after the union has forced an impasse, or they will be dictated by the union because a hostage management cannot risk the possibility of an enormous antitrust judgment.

   Perhaps the greatest irony is that the courts have subverted the collective-bargaining process and three federal statutes in order to assist workers who as a group probably are the highest-paid salaried employees in the world.
In any other industry, employees know that gains can be achieved only through hard bargaining, mutual compromise, flexing of economic and political muscle, and perhaps even a strike; but in the end the terms of employment will be established by private agreement.
Steelworkers, mineworkers, millworkers, and the like know that what they get they get only by sticking together and winning it at the bargaining table.
There is no hope that a federal court will step in and give them what they can't bargain for because the judge thinks it's more fair.

   Only professional athletes, who are in the least need of such judicial assistance, can get courts to give them more than they can lawfully obtain in good-faith bargaining.
It's no wonder that the NFL players deserted their union and caused last year's strike to collapse; they might win all they wanted in the courthouse at no cost or sacrifice.
It makes one wonder why they ever went out on strike at all.

   It is curious at best that federal judges find it appealing to subvert three statutes and undermine collective bargaining to benefit highly paid athletes.
But whatever their motivations, these cases are further evidence of the often-voiced view that we are indeed becoming a nation ruled by judges instead of law.
It is just this type of judicial usurpation of legislative authority that causes an erosion of public confidence in the federal judiciary.

   The justice of gender in the locker room was
supposed to be settled 12 years ago. Courts gave women
sportswriters equal access to dressing rooms so they would have the
same chance as men to do their jobs.
   Yet the issue of women in the clubhouse keeps making headlines.
Denise Tom of USA Today was barred Monday night from the Cincinnati
Bengals' dressing room hours after the National Football League
named an investigator to look into charges of harassment of Boston
Herald reporter Lisa Olson.
   ``We go into locker rooms not because we want to, but because we
have to,'' wrote Christine Brennan, a sportswriter with The
Washington Post and one of pioneers who fought for equal access.
   ``It's not exciting or sexy or tantalizing. It's cramped and
steamy and messy,'' she said. ``But most stadiums are too old to
have a room big enough for all reporters and all players to meet
for interviews. So the only place we can do our jobs is the locker
room.''
   About 500 women work as sports journalists, according to the
Association for Women in Sports Media. They have the same right to
do their jobs as women who drive trucks, mine coal, doctor the sick
or practice law.
   Precedent was established in 1978 when a federal judge ruled
Melissa Ludtke, a reporter for Sports Illustrated, could go into
the New York Yankees' clubhouse. Barring her violated her
constitutional right to equal protection under the law, Judge
Constance Baker Motley ruled.
   In 1985, Commissioner Pete Rozelle ordered all NFL teams to
treat reporters equally in interview areas, regardless of sex. Some
teams like the Dallas Cowboys set up rooms where players could be
interviewed; others handed out bathrobes or towels to players.
   Major league baseball provided equal access that year, too.
Basketball and hockey already had set open policies. The National
Basketball Association schools rookies on how to deal with the
media - male and female.
   But the going has hardly been easy for women in the world of
jocks, where clubhouses smell of sweat and salve and soiled
athletic supporters but where reporters have to go for interviews.
   In 1986, Susan Fornoff of The Sacramento (Calif.) Bee received a
live rat wrapped in a shoe box from Dave Kingman of the Oakland
Athletics. Joan Ryan of The Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel once told of a
player from a defunct football league who ran a razor up her leg as
she conducted an interview.
   Earlier this year, intern Jennifer Frey of the Detroit Free
Press was told by Detroit Tigers pitcher Jack Morris: ``I don't
talk to people when I'm naked, especially women, unless they're on
top of me or I'm on top of them.''
   When the newspaper complained, Tigers president Bo Schembechler
wrote back: ``No female member of my family would be inside a men's
locker room regardless of their job description.''
   Now, former Watergate investigator Philip Heymann has been named
to look into charges that New England Patriots' players exposed
themselves and made suggestive remarks to Olson on Sept. 17. The
Herald reporter called it ``nothing less than mind rape.''
   Tight end Zeke Mowatt was fined $2,000 and apologized, but
denied making lewd gestures or comments. He said the only thing he
told her was: ``You are not writing; you are looking.''
   Patriots owner Victor Kiam at first called the locker room
incident ``a flyspeck in the ocean,'' then told the paper it was
``asking for trouble'' by sending a female reporter into a football
dressing room. He was also quoted as calling her ``a classic
bitch.''
   After the National Organization for Women called from a boycott
of Remington Products Inc., which Kiam owns, he took out full-page
ads in The New York Times, the Boston Herald and The Boston Globe.
   Kiam apologized and said ``there's no excuse for what
happened.'' He also denied calling her a name.
   She was booed at Sunday's game.
   In Seattle, Bengals Coach Sam Wyche kept USA Today's Tom from
the locker room because ``our guys don't want a woman to walk into
a situation like that.'' In the past, Wyche has closed the locker
room to all reporters in violation of NFL policy and was fined last
year.
   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Wyche faces another fine for
not letting a woman into the locker room.
   ``If he wants to make a stand on the issue, he can make a stand
on the issue. He will be fined very heavily for it. If he wants to
quit, he can quit, because he has been warned twice already,''
Tagliabue said.
   Tuesday's edition of USA Today contained a column by
sportswriter Rachel Shuster aimed at NFL brass. She concluded:
``We've earned our place in the locker room. Now, just give us some
respect, and we'll do our jobs and let you do yours.''

<LEADPARA>  FOOTBALL fans longing for the good old days can wrap themselves up in a new
line of nostalgic sweat shirts, caps and jackets to match their memories this
fall.;   "Throwbacks" is the catchy name of a new line of vintage-inspired
clothing licensed by the National Football League. Original logos, team colors
and names that have changed over time as well as old photographs provide the
graphics for most of the items, priced from $18 for caps, $22 for T-shirts,
$40 for sweat shirts and $250 for a jacket.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The graphics "harken back to a different feeling about the game -- a
reflection of players who were down and dirty, leather helmets and
play-it-in-the-streets-if-you-had-to. It's indicative of the way the league
started in the '20s and '30s," says Jeff Sofka, senior licensing manager for
NFL Properties.;   "The good old days always seem better than what we have
today," Sofka adds. "The nostalgia craze in America obviously has been growing
and we have had some nostalgic products in our assortment over the years, but
never a complete collection. We felt it was time to take a stand in the
nostalgia business and create a themed marketing program.";   Unfortunately
for 49er Faithful, East Coast teams dominate the initial offerings. For San
Francisco's single T-shirt or sweat shirt with a "weathered" finish there are
three for the Canton Bulldogs and two each for the Chicago Bears, Green Bay
Packers, New York Giants and Washington Redskins.;   "The NFL teams with the
most interesting histories will make for the best Throwbacks market," Sofka
says. "Chicago, Green Bay and New York are the three that come to mind first
because of the tremendous histories of the Bears, Packers and Giants. But as
we research into team histories we're finding some great stories about the San
Francisco 49ers and the Los Angeles Rams that used to be the Cleveland Rams.";
  The Throwbacks collection covers three periods of NFL history -- "The
Originals," 1920-1949; "The Expansion Years," 1950-1969 and "The Modern Era,"
1970-1990. First shown to retailers in July, shipments are expected to start
in September.;   Dave Alioto, owner of seven Sports Stuff stores in the Bay
Area and one in Reno, says he will be carrying the line and expects the caps
to be the most popular item, as they have been with a similar nostalgia-themed
collection of baseball apparel.;   THE UNIFORMS OF THE OLYMPIAD: With the
Games of the XXVth Olympiad less than I year away, manufacturers and retailers
are starting to carry their own torches for Olympic-themed products.;
Designer Henry Grethel scored the biggest coup by being named designer for the
parade uniforms for both the Winter Games in Albertville, France, and the
Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain. The task means coming up with outfits for
more than 1,100 athletes, coaches and officials in women's sizes 4 to 18 and
men's sizes 36 short to 58 extra-long jackets, 14 1/2- to 20-inch shirts and
26- to 52-inch waist pants. Best news of all is that Grethel plans to go
beyond the tired, warm-up suit look so many countries use.;   Sunglasses
manufacturer Bausch &amp; Lomb signed on to be one of 12 worldwide sponsors of the
1992 games and in conjunction with that commitment is launching the Ray-Ban
Olympic series. All styles in the collection feature the Olympic rings motif.;
  Besides marketing Olympic sunglasses, Bausch &amp; Lomb is also planning to give
each Olympic medal winner a special limited-edition pair of bronze, silver or
gold Ray-Bans. Go for the glasses.;   J.C. Penney continues as the exclusive
retailer of the USA Olympic brand of clothing and shoes. The chain has
contributed $12.5 million to the United States Olympic Committee from its
sales of $98 million on products carrying the USA Olympic symbol over the past
two years.  </TEXT>

GROUP FORMED TO BATTLE NFL 'SCRAMBLE'

More than 40 owners of sports bars and restaurants met Tuesday night in
Hillcrest to discuss strategies for contesting a lawsuit by Home Box Office and
fighting the threat by the National Football League to "scramble" its fall
telecasts.
</P>
<P>
They emerged from the meeting, which was also attended by eight attorneys, to
announce the formation of a new organization, the Assn. for Sports Fans'
Rights, which they hope will gain national backing.
</P>
<P>
"Tonight, all present agreed to join together to investigate options that may
exist, including rallying the customers of the bars and restaurants, as they
are the ones being denied the games," Norman Lebovitz, the owner of Sluggo's,
said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
Lebovitz's comments came in reaction to a suit brought by HBO against the
owners of more than 30 San Diego sports bars for showing the recent heavyweight
title bout between Mike Tyson and Henry Tillman, via a Mexican satellite feed.
The suit, filed Aug. 8 in U.S. District Court, gives the defendants 20 days in
which to respond.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the NFL stunned owners and customers of sports bars and restaurants
across the country by announcing it plans to scramble its telecasts beginning
with the first regular-season game Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
Lebovitz said sports bars and restaurants are dependent on showing NFL games by
use of rooftop "dishes" that pick up the games as they're beamed from
satellites. The shock of the NFL's announcement was that no descrambling option
will be available.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't get the $3.6 billion the NFL got," Lebovitz said, referring to the
new four-year network television agreement, "and we're not about to lay down
and die. Many of us are dependent on these games for our livelihoods. Some
people will go under if this is enforced."
</P>
<P>
Lebovitz said the Assn. for Sports Fans' Rights plans another meeting next
week.

<HL> NFL Flirts With Cable as It Begins
Negotiating New Broadcast Deal
---
By Hal Lancaster
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL>

<TEXT>
   Does the National Football League's enormously successful television recipe need to be spiced up?

   For nearly two decades, the NFL has mixed a shot of CBS, a dash of ABC and a pinch of NBC to brew a very rich alphabet soup.
The last contract for broadcast rights, for example, a five-year pact that expired after the Super Bowl last month, brought in $2.1 billion from the networks.

   But now, with serious negotiations on a new contract beginning, the chefs at the NFL may add a little HBO, ESPN or WTBS to the stock.
All three are products of cable technology -- heretofore an unknown concept in the NFL universe -- which could make these the most complex and significant negotiations in league history.

   While the inclusion of cable stations is far from certain, the mere fact that the NFL is considering such radical tinkering illustrates how times have changed for both the league and the broadcast industry.
Five years ago, the NFL was the unassailable crown jewel of highly profitable network sports divisions.
Negotiating a television contract was simple then: After a few cozy lunches with network executives, Pete Rozelle, the league's commissioner, got pretty much whatever he wanted.

   Since then, however, NFL ratings have foundered.
Why?
Everybody has an explanation: overexposure, predictable and repetitive play, overpaid athletes striking for more money, drug problems, image-tarnishing litigation, bad karma.
Whatever the reason, advertisers fled and network losses on the games grew -- to an estimated $100 million this past season, although the NFL insists the figure was closer to $75 million.
And so the networks vowed to seek redress through lower rights fees.

   The decision couldn't come at a worse time for the NFL.
A recent bidding war for players with the now-dormant United States Football League helped drive up the NFL's costs and narrow its profits.
Moreover, with ticket prices already high and most NFL stadiums sold out or nearly so, chances of making up the difference at the gate seem slim.

   Unlike in the past, NFL strategists delayed these television negotiations as long as possible, gambling that ratings would rebound after a three-year decline.
They did eventually rise, but fell off slightly last season.
Even the mighty Super Bowl produced lackluster numbers, despite the presence of the New York Giants, a team from the nation's biggest TV market.

   Of course, the NFL remains a potent ratings draw compared with other sports.
"It does a consistent double-digit rating," says one advertising agency buyer.
"The National Basketball Association doesn't do that; regular-season college basketball or football doesn't do that."
And A.C. Nielsen Co.'s planned switch to "people meter" measuring devices this fall may make the league look better.
The new meters measure group viewing more accurately than Nielsen's old methods, and the NFL, more than many other types of programming, tends to attract group viewing.

   Still, the days of doubling rights fees, a common thing in the past, are probably over for the NFL.
What will they do about it?
The NFL owners plan to meet in Maui, Hawaii, in mid-March.
By then, Mr. Rozelle and Arthur Modell, owner of the Cleveland Browns and chairman of the league's television committee, hope to have a package ready that will differ little structurally from previous contracts.
"But," Mr. Modell says, "there's a better chance than not that there would be a fourth package (for cable).
We have to look at all our revenues and see that our members are protected."

   Cable's hopes rest on the reactions of the three over-the-air networks, particularly ABC, which threatened to drop the NFL if the price wasn't right.
Few of the people involved in the negotiations believe ABC would drop all rights, as that could accelerate the defection of affiliates from the network.
The "Monday Night Football" show "is the linchpin of ABC's fall schedule," says Peter Lund, who until recently was president of CBS Sports and is currently president of CBS Inc.'s owned-and-operated stations.
ABC, he adds, "doesn't have a lot of things" that match that program's ratings.

   But under the cost-conscious tutelage of Capital Cities, its new owner, ABC still could shed its Thursday and Sunday prime-time games, making them available to bids by a cable operator.
And while network executives downplay the importance of a cable agreement, they have spoken out, warning the NFL about "devaluing" its product through overexposure.

   Cable also raises antitrust questions.
Congressional legislation in 1961 granted a special antitrust exemption to the NFL, permitting it to pool its TV rights and sell them on "sponsored" telecasts.
But does that include such outlets as ESPN or HBO, which didn't exist then?
Congress intended the exemption to bring more games to free television, not fewer, says Stephen Ross, a former Justice Department lawyer who teaches sports law at the University of Illinois.

   The NFL now contends that the antitrust laws would apply only where several games are being televised and teams enter agreements carving up territories.
A "game of the week" on cable, for example, wouldn't raise any antitrust issues, the league argues.

   But that attitude seems to contradict the NFL's past words and deeds.
Last year, Mr. Ross says, the league agreed to exclude pay and cable television from the exemption in order to gain passage of a bill that would strengthen its control of franchise relocations.
The agreement was scuttled when other professional sports leagues objected.
And in a 1982 Senate hearing, Paul Tagliabue, an NFL attorney, said that "the words 'sponsored telecasting' in that statute were intended to exclude pay and cable."
He added, though, that it wasn't clear whether the league could pool and sell TV rights to pay and cable networks without an exemption.

   Despite possible legal challenges, cable has pursued the NFL ardently, with an eye on the coming negotiations.
ESPN has lined up financial support from cable operators to bid for Monday night football and anything else it can get its hands on.
Most of those same operators have joined a consortium seeking Sunday night games.
WTBS has declared itself interested, despite its recent financial woes.
The USA Network also wants an NFL deal.
And HBO is independently seeking a Thursday night package.

   HBO, however, reaches fewer than 15 million of the nation's 87.4 million television homes, and subscribers must pay a premium over the basic cable fee to get it.
While such conditions appear to make it vulnerable to an antitrust challenge, Seth Abraham, HBO's executive vice president, doesn't see it that way.
"If the three commercial networks pass on the supplemental package," he asks, "shouldn't the NFL be free to sell a fourth package to someone who wants it?"

   ESPN, naturally, feels that its sports bent is just right for the NFL.
And to ease concerns about the national advertising market, it plans to increase the percentage of local advertising run by affiliates during NFL broadcasts to 60% from 20%, something a satellite-beamed superstation like WTBS can't do.

   And all the cable outlets have one advantage: "We can schedule games at the times the NFL wants," says Rex Lardner, director of sports at WTBS. "ABC looks at Thursday night differently; they're going against Cosby.
We're an alternative to Cosby; we don't have to have the bulk numbers."

   Some cable executives, however, argue that a single programming coup -- particularly one that could cost $50 million to $100 million -- won't have much effect on a cable network's audience growth.
As Terrence J. Elkes, president of Viacom International Inc., asked at a recent conference: With so much college and pro football already on the air, "what's so unique about national football on Sunday night?"
Viacom, the tenth-largest cable system operator, refused to join the cable consortium seeking an NFL package.

   Despite cable's bright promise, the NFL may prefer to maintain the status quo a little longer.
The league's flirtation with cable is seen in some quarters as a ploy to get the networks at least to match last year's rights fee of $495 million.

   "This," says HBO's Mr. Abraham, "is going to be the greatest poker game in the history of sports television."

That Cuts Fees Up to 10%</HL>

   The National Football League is close to an agreement on television broadcast rights that would reduce fees paid by the three major networks as much as 10%, broadcasting executives said.

   The NFL could announce as early as this week a new three-year contract with CBS Inc., Capital Cities/ABC Inc. and General Electric Co.'s National Broadcasting Co. unit, executives said.
The NFL's annual meeting begins today in Hawaii.

   Executives said that under the new contract, the three networks will pay slightly less each year than the $490 million they paid the NFL in rights fees in 1986, the final year of a $2.1 billion, five-year contract.
The networks, which reportedly lost as much as $75 million broadcasting NFL games last year, have been seeking lower fees in light of a softer sports advertising market and declining viewership of games.

   To make up lost network revenue, the league is also expected to announce a fourth rights package with a cable concern, possibly ESPN Inc., Time Inc.'s Home Box Office unit, or Cable Football Network, a consortium of cable companies.
ESPN, a cable sports television service, is 80%-owned by Capital Cities/ABC.

   The cable concerns have bid on a package of eight Sunday night games, four exhibition games and the Pro Bowl, sources said.
ABC will continue to air Monday Night Football, though ABC reportedly is dropping five "special" broadcasts of games on other nights.

   An NFL spokesman wouldn't confirm or deny reports of progress at the talks.

Raj Bhathal, an Orange County swimsuit manufacturer and real estate developer,
has acquired majority ownership of the Orlando franchise in the new World
League of American Football, league officials announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bhathal, 49, a Newport Beach resident, announced Wednesday that the team's name
will be the Orlando Thunder.
</P>
<P>
"NFL games played abroad have proven that people overseas enjoy the American
style of football," said Bhathal, who emigrated in 1962 from India to the
United States. "With Orlando's strong worldwide popularity, this will give us
an opportunity to enhance the City of Orlando as an international city.
</P>
<P>
"Owning a team in this league might be better than being in the NFL. I love,
love football . . . This city was the No. 1 city in the World League's
marketing. We feel this is an international league and Orlando is an
international city."
</P>
<P>
Bhathal, who founded Far Western Bank in Tustin and is a member of the
Executive Round Table at UC Irvine, announced that Paul Bartelt, 30, owner of
Pro Sports Management in Orange, will be a minority owner of the franchise and
handle daily operations. Bartelt's background includes negotiating NFL player
contracts and commercial advertising agreements.
</P>
<P>
The league expects to have 10 franchises and begin play March 10. Unlike
previous unsuccessful attempts by the World Football League and USFL to compete
with the NFL, the WLAF will be governed and operated by it. The new league has
a 21-country, $50-million television package.
</P>
<P>
Bhathal and his wife, Marta, reside in the Big Canyon area of Newport Beach.
They have a son who attends Corona del Mar High School and a daughter at USC.
</P>
<P>
"Raj Bhathal brings an impeccable background of business success and community
involvement to Orlando's World League franchise," said Mike Lynn, league
president. "As a native of India, he also has a strong appreciation for the
international dimension of this league and shares our vision of globalizing the
sport of American football."
</P>
<P>
The other U.S. franchises will be in Charlotte, N.C.; New York; Montreal;
Sacramento; San Antonio, and Birmingham, Ala. London, Barcelona and Frankfurt,
Germany, will be the European entries.
