Andreas Hillgruber, a controversial German historian and catalyst of 
acrimonious debate on the historical perspective of the Holocaust, died this 
month after a long illness, Cologne University said Thursday. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
The university said he died May 8 but did not provide details of his illness. 
</P>
<P>
Hillgruber, a Cologne University professor and prolific author, gained respect 
among historians around the world for his detailed works on Adolf Hitler's rise 
to power and the Nazi dictator's foreign policies. His theories also sparked 
widespread argument. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bitter Arguments 
</P>
<P>
Over the last three years, Hillgruber -- considered by some to be an apologist 
for German war crimes -- was involved in bitter arguments among West German 
academicians over the historical interpretation of the Holocaust, in which 6 
million Jews were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Hillgruber supported the view that, historically speaking, the Holocaust, 
although certainly atrocious, could not be singled out as generally different 
from other atrocities, like Josef Stalin's reign of terror in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
In a controversial 1986 book titled "The Destruction of the German Reich and 
the End of European Judaism," he also praised the German army's last-ditch 
attempt in 1945 to fend off Soviet troops, saying that it gave civilians time 
to flee from "revenge organs of the Red Army." 
</P>
<P>
His writings, it was suggested, encouraged comparisons between the Holocaust 
and the raping and pillaging by advancing Soviet troops. 
</P>
<P>
Hillgruber also contended that it was Austria, more than Germany, that created 
the anti-Semitism that produced the Holocaust, and that it was Hitler's 
personal extremism, not Germany's, that led to the persecution of Jews. 
Additionally, Hillgruber argued that the Allies decided to crush Germany long 
before they knew of Nazi atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Provoked Anger 
</P>
<P>
The book provoked anger among some West Germans, with many newspapers calling 
it a scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow historians said Hillgruber will long be respected for his earlier work. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an excellent historian, particularly on Hitler's political and military 
plans, which were the basis for Hitler's program to conquer the world," said 
Reinhard Meyers, a historian at Muenster University. 
</P>
<P>
Hillgruber's other works include "The Second World War 1939-45: Goals and 
Strategies of the Great Powers," "The Destruction of Europe" and "Hitler's 
Strategies, Policies and Leadership From 1940-41."

<HEAD>Newspaper: Hitler's Former Adjutant Buried in Duesseldorf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUESSELDORF, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100 former members of
Nazi German SS units attended the funeral of a former aide to Nazi
leader Adolf Hitler, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   Die Welt am Sonntag newspaper said former Hitler aide Richard
Schulze-Kossens died July 3 from lung cancer at the age of 73. His
funeral was held Friday in a Duesseldorf chapel, the newspaper said.
   Schulze-Kossens served as one of Hitler's adjutants from 1941 to
1944, the newspaper said.
   In 1944, he was promoted to a SS lieutenant colonel and named
head of a SS training school.
   After the Nazi defeat in 1945, Schulze-Kossens spent three years
in an American internment camp and later worked as a salesman and
writer, the newspaper said.
   Die Welt said Hitler's last personal adjutant, Otto Guensche,
accompanied Schulze-Kossens' widow to the services.
   Guensche reportedly was the Nazi aide who burned the bodies of
Hitler and Eva Braun after they committed suicide in Hitler's
Berlin bunker.
   Among the guests at the funeral were 100 former members of Nazi
SS units, many wearing the insignia of a group formed by SS
veterans to assist comrades after the war, the newspaper said.
   Die Welt said the casket was draped with wreathes bearing
tributes from several former SS units.
   Schulze-Kossens first served as an aide to Nazi Germany's
foreign minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, and was present when
Germany signed a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union in 1939.
   Die Welt said the former chief aide to SS leader Heinrich
Himmler, Werner Grothmann, a long-time friend of Schulze-Kossens,
was among two former Nazi officers who delivered eulogies during
the service.

<HEAD>Video Collection Documents Christian Resistance to Hitler</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID REED</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LYNCHBURG, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emy Bonhoeffer remembers everything about
the moment in 1945 when she realized her husband, Klaus, would die
for his involvement in the Christian resistance to Adolf Hitler's
fascist regime and his extermination of Jews.
   Among 36 people interviewed for a video archive in Lynchburg,
she said she was sitting with her husband in the ruins of their
bombed house in Munich when she exhaled a puff of cigarette smoke,
turned to Klaus and asked for the first time: ``How will it be when
you are arrested?''
   Her husband's words, as she recounts, were: ``It will be like a
lion passed through and devoured myself and all that I have.''
   Klaus Bonhoeffer, a member of the ``Confessing Church'' that was
set up in the crisis by church leaders to resist Nazism, told her
she could do nothing to prevent his demise.
   She related, ``He said, `Perhaps you can preserve your life and
our children, and, if you can, let them know that their father did
not do nothing.'''
   A few months later, Bonhoeffer and his brother, Dietrich
Bonhoeffer, the renowned theologian and Lutheran minister, were led
into the rubble outside a prison and executed on Hitler's personal
orders.
   James Patrick Kelley, professor of religious studies at
Lynchburg College, spent four years seeking and interviewing
Germans or their relatives who were involved in the Christian
resistance to Hitler, a generally unknown voice in the wilderness
of inaction against or collaboration with the Nazis.
   The collection he has established, 200 hours of videotape
available by mail for researchers and historians, was dedicated
recently at the college. Elie Wiesel, a Jewish survivor of the
Auschwitz death camp, termed the Christian resisters to Hitler
``righteous Gentiles.''
   Kelley's project was financed by Seventh Street Christian Church
in Richmond, Va.
   The only other videotape archives in the United States on the
subject of Nazi Germany is at Yale University, where interviews of
1,400 Holocaust survivors and witnesses to the atrocities against
Jews are maintained, said Kelley and Joanne Rudof, project manager
of the Yale collection.
   Kelley, who received his master's degree and doctorate at Yale,
said there were two questions for which he sought explanations:
Where were the Christians during Hitler's rise to power? Why did
they not prevent the horror of the Holocaust?
   ``It's important for people to know there was early resistance
to the Hitler regime and he's documenting this,'' Rudof said of
Kelley.
   On Kelley's efforts to explain why most Christians turned their
backs on the Jews while a few helped them, Rudof said: ``It's such
an unresolved question. There is still a great bitterness on behalf
of many Jews who ask, `Why didn't they help us more?' And there are
some Jews who praise the help given to them by Christians.''
   Kelley said that at one crucial point in 1934 when Hitler had
not yet consolidated his power, 45 percent of the clergy in Germany
were aligned with the Confessing Church, organized specifically to
oppose his racist regime replete with anti-Semitic policies.
   No other group of professionals followed the example of the
Confessing Church and publicly opposed Hitler, be it lawyers who
could have decried the arbitrary denial of rights to Jews or
scientists who could have spoken out against the dismissal of
Jewish colleagues, Kelley said.
   Kelley said if there had been more public opposition, Hitler's
policies could have been modified and the Holocaust, the systematic
extermination of 6 million Jews that began in 1941, might have been
prevented. In addition to the Jews, an estimated 5 million other
people died or were killed in the camps, including people branded
as liberals or opponents to fascism, scholars and homosexuals.
   But the movement faded and the number of Christians involved in
the resistance dwindled. Rudof said some pastors went so far as to
join Hitler's secret police.
   Why did so many Christians remain silent? ``Different answers
were given by almost everyone,'' Kelley said. ``They said some were
afraid. Some ignored the realities behind the propaganda. Some
people were preoccupied with personal affairs.''
   The most eloquent answer, Kelley said, came from Renate Bethge,
the daughter of an executed Christian resister and neice of
Dietrich Bonhoeffer.
   ``She said, `When people know enough to know if they learn more
it will require some risk ... then it is surprising how little
people want to learn.'''
   Kelley said he does not want to portray the Christian members of
the resistance as heroes. ``They failed to prevent the Holocaust,
World War II and the destruction of Germany. At the same time it
should be remembered that they tried to prevent those kind of
things. They should not be forgotten.''
   James Smylie, a professor of church history at Union Theological
Seminary in Richmond, said the remaining Christian resisters are
rapidly dying.
   ``Kelley gave 36 persons still alive an opportunity to talk,
live on camera, about their experiences in those excruciating
years,'' Smylie said. ``Their reflections are now part of the
record, which will assist us in reassessing this past and
understanding our own responsibilities today.''

While Rodenkirchen was on the rubbing table for a race at Princeton University

<TEXT>
   The president of parliament called the
early years of the Hitler era a ``glorious'' time for many Germans,
triggering a walkout during the government's ceremony Thursday
marking the Kristallnacht.
   The remarks by Philipp Jenniger threatened to overshadow West
Germany's carefully planned ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary
of the Kristallnacht, the night the Nazis began their first
organized assault against the Jews.
   But a leader of West Germany's Jewish community, Michael Fuerst,
defended Jenninger's speech, saying it was simply describing the
situation in Germany during those years. Fuerst said he did not
understand the calls for Jenninger to resign.
   ``I welcome that the parliament president described in full
clarity what was happening in Germany between 1933 and 1938,''
Fuerst, a deputy chairman of the Central Council of Jews in West
Germany, said in a television interview.
   ``Especially the fact that everything that Hitler did was
strongly supported by the masses of all Germans,'' he added.
   Jenninger's remarks prompted demands for his resignation by
members of the opposition Greens and Social Democrats, who were
among about 50 who marched out of the hall during the nationally
televised speech to parliament.
   The national ARD and ZDF television networks both reported late
Thursday that Jenninger was expected to resign shortly.
   The Bonn daily newspaper Die Welt, which is close to Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's conservative government, said Jenninger was expected
to announce his resignation Friday.
   In its early Friday edition, Die Welt said Kohl strongly
criticized Jenninger at a private meeting Thursday, but left it to
Jenninger whether to resign.
   Social Democrat chairman Hans-Jochen Vogel said in a letter to
Jenninger, a conservative, that the parliament president had shown a
``disturbing lack of judgment'' in his speech.
   In his speech, the 56-year-old Jenninger had talked at length
about the positive feelings of many ordinary Germans early in the
Hitler dictatorship.
   ``Didn't Hitler bring to reality what (Kaiser) Wilhelm II had
only promised, that is to lead the Germans to glorious times? Wasn't
he chosen by Providence, a Fuehrer such as is given to a people only
once in a thousand years?'' Jenninger asked.
   ``For the fate of the Germans and European Jews, Hitler's
successes were perhaps even more fateful than his crimes and
misdeeds,'' Jenninger said. ``The years from 1933 to 1938, even from
a distant retrospective and in the knowledge of what followed, still
are a fascinating thing today, since throughout history there was
hardly a parallel to Hitler's triumphal procession during the first
years.''
   Jenninger then cited such events as inclusion of the Saarland,
Austria, and part of Czechoslovakia into the Third Reich, as well as
the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.
   But some listeners also had sobbed when Jenninger read an
eyewitness account of the murder of concentration camp victims in
1942.
   ``Blood was running over the shoulders of almost everyone,'' he
read. ``Some of those shot were still moving, some lifted their arms
and turned their heads, to show they were still alive.''
   In Jerusalem, Israel's Foreign Ministry said it was astonished by
Jenninger's speech.
   ``We have known Dr. Jenninger for years as the man who headed
many friendly delegations to Israel,'' it said in a statement.
   ``The way of interpreting the Nazi era and the description of its
historical background in his speech are unacceptable for any Jew,''
it said. ``It was a miserable speech, whatever the original
intentions may be.''
   Edgar Bronfman, president of the New York-based World Jewish
Congress, said in a statement that Jenninger's remarks were
``reprehensible'' and demanded an urgent explanation.
   Later Thursday, a Greens lawmaker said Jenninger's speech showed
that ``anti-Semitism exists in the hearts of many members of this
house.''
   The statement by Jutta Oesterle-Schwerin brought loud jeers from
other lawmakers and parliament vice-president Annemarie Renger
several times tried to interrupt Mrs. Oesterle-Schwerin's speech,
finally shutting off the microphone.
   Starting with the Kristallnacht of Nov. 9-10, 1938, the Nazis
made clear their intentions to wipe out European Jews. On that
night, Nazi thugs destroyed Jewish homes, businesses and synagogues,
sending 30,000 Jews to concentration camps and killing 91 Jews.
   Shattered glass covered the streets and the Nazis, in a boastful
mood, named it Kristallnacht, which in English is Crystal Night.
   The Nazis killed 6 million Jews and many others during Hitler's
rule from 1933 to 1945.
   Before Jenninger spoke at the government's ceremonies, an
88-year-old Nazi concentration camp survivor Ida Ehre read from Paul
Celan's poem ``Todesfuge,'' one of the most dramatic poems about the
Holocaust.
   ``Death is a master from Germany, his eye is blue,'' Ms. Ehre, an
actress and director in Hamburg, read. ``He strikes thee with leaden
bullets, he strikes thee exactly.''
   In Communist East Berlin, thousands of people gathered at one of
Europe's largest synagogues for ceremonies marking the start of its
restoration, timed to coincide with the Kristallnacht rememberances.

   Philipp Jenninger said once he entered
politics in 1963 because his father told him to ``be of service''
and help prevent another war.
   Jenninger, 56, resigned Friday as president of Parliament after
sharp criticism of a speech in which he said many Germans felt Adolf
Hitler's early years were ``glorious.''
   He also condemned the Nazis in his address to Parliament on
Thursday, the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the night of terror
that began Hitler's extermination of 6 million Jews.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl criticized his close friend and former
aide for the tone of the speech, the conservative Die Welt newspaper
said.
   In his resignation announcement, Jenninger said he always had
opposed ``every type of totalitarian rule'' and has been a
consistent supporter of Israel.
   He told reporters in 1982 he entered public service because his
father told him the world must avoid another war like the one Hitler
started in 1939.
   ``Two of my brothers died in the war. My father told me when I
was 12: `Be of service during your lifetime so that something like
this can never again happen.' That influenced me,'' Jenninger said.
   He is a member of Kohl's conservative Christian Democratic Union
and reached the highest position in Parliament on a reputation for
fairness and effectiveness.
   As a close aide to Kohl, Jenninger was a leading figure in
persuading communist East Germany to let more of its people visit or
move to West Germany.
   He also was involved in preparations for a visit to West Germany
by East German leader Erich Honecker in 1984 that was vetoed by the
Soviet Union. Last year, Honecker became the first East German
leader to visit West Germany.
   Jenninger was born June 10, 1932, at Rindelbach in what is now
Baden-Wuerttenberg state, and earned a doctor of law degree in 1957
from the University of Tuebingen. He entered politics in 1963 as an
adviser in the Defense Ministry.
   From 1966 until he won a Parliament seat in 1969, Jenninger was a
political adviser to Franz Josef Strauss, a powerful conservative
politician from Bavaria who was finance minister. Strauss died last
month.
   Jenninger became the Christian Democratic Union's chief
parliamentary secretary in 1975, in charge of coordinating its
legislative affairs. When Kohl became chancellor in October 1982, he
made Jenninger state minister in the Chancellery.
   On Nov. 4, 1984, Jenninger became president of Parliament in
place of Rainer Barzel, who resigned in a corruption scandal. The
members elected him with 340 of 469 votes.

   A bitter, open debate marked by
charges that some prominent historians are trying to tone down the
horror of Nazi atrocities is capturing the attention of West
Germans.
   The controversy has been the topic of a best-selling book,
numerous newspaper articles and TV reports. It is known as the
``Historians' Dispute'' and has split prominent professors into
feuding camps.
   One group, represented chiefly by prominent Berlin historian
Ernst Nolte, is calling for a new perspective on the Third Reich
and German identity 43 years after World War II.
   Six million Jews were killed in Europe between 1933 and 1945 as
part of Adolf Hitler's ``Final Solution.''
   Nolte and his supporters tend to compare what happened under
Hitler to atrocities carried out by other governments, such as the
deaths of millions in the Soviet Union under Stalin.
   But their opponents, led by Frankfurt University philosophy
professor Juergen Habermas, say the conservative historians are
trying to lessen the magnitude of Nazi crimes through such
comparisons. Habermas, one of West Germany's best known
intellectuals, also says his opponents are paving the way for
nationalistic impulses.
   In December more than 300 historians, sociologists, and
philosophers met in Frankfurt to discuss the dispute's impact. No
resolutions were passed there, but lectures held at the meeting
will be published in a book scheduled for release in March.
   The debate, however, has moved far beyond academic circles.
   A book documenting the dispute made the best-seller list in the
news magazine Stern last year, and new arguments regularly make
headlines in leading newspapers. As recently as Jan. 20, regional
television in the state of Bavaria devoted a book-review show to
new history books associated with the dispute.
   Nolte told The Associated Press in a telephone interview
Wednesday that he stands by his arguments.
   ``Those who want to make the Nazis' mass murder stand alone by
forbidding every comparison with other events are guilty of having
an incredibly unhistorical attitude,'' Nolte said.
   Nolte sparked the historians' dispute with an essay called ``The
Past That Won't Go Away,'' published in the conservative
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper in June 1986.
   He suggested that Stalin's infamous forced labor camps and the
Communists' murder of millions of peasants were in a sense a
forerunner of the Nazi death camp Auschwitz and Hitler's genocide
program.
   ``Wasn't the Bolsheviks' `class murder' the logical and actual
precursor of the National Socialists' `racial murder'?'' Nolte
asked in the essay.
   Nolte's opponents have frequently called his phrasing unclear
and open to many interpretations.
   His critics also say he tries to justify Hitler's motives for
attacking the Soviet Union in World War II by arguing that the
dictator was mainly responding to the Soviets' goal of spreading
communism.
   ``To Nolte, Hitler is a European citizen who was historically in
the right in that he unwillingly went to war for democracy,'' the
Bayerischen Rundfunk television show ``Lesezeichen'' said in
reviewing Nolte's new book.
   Nolte and his supporters, however, say their arguments raise
valid questions in historical interpretation.
   Other Nolte arguments include comparing Nazi atrocities with
those of Cambodia's Pol Pot regime in the 1970s.
   Nolte says that he does not adhere to any one political party,
but many historians call him a conservative.
   ``I would say Nolte is a conservative,'' historian Christian
Meier of the University of Munich told the AP. ``Conservatives in
this dispute are those who see the horrible events of World War II
and the Holocaust as an instance of fascism, which also took hold
in other European countries, and not as a failure of German society
and values.''
   Habermas, in a newspaper essay, charged several conservative
historians with reinterpreting history to justify and minimize the
Nazi regime's crimes. The article appeared in the Hamburg-based
weekly newspaper, Die Zeit, in July 1986.
   The Nazi crimes ``lose their singularity'' in Nolte's arguments,
Habermas wrote in the article.
   Many historians hold that the Nazis' genocide cannot validly be
compared with other atrocities.
   ``Never before had a state, with the authority of its
responsible leader, decided and announced it would completely kill
off a specific group of people'' and put the plan into aciton,
historian Eberhard Jaeckel of Stuttgart University wrote about the
Nazi genocide in a 1986 essay as a response to conservative
arguments.
   Some historians say that too much dwelling on the Nazi past
could cause West Germans today, particularly younger ones, to
resent what they may see as a steady stream of accusation.
   ``Many (West) Germans today are at least one generation removed
from the Nazi period,'' Meier said. ``But the (West) Germans are
constantly being reminded of past actions. If it goes too far, it
could even provoke a counter-reaction.''
   Some liberal historians attribute the airing of conservative
views to a new, conservative ``political climate'' in West Germany.
In 1982, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative Christian Democrats
toppled the leftist Social Democrats.
   ``Ten years ago they (the conservative historians) wouldn't have
risked advancing such notions,'' historian Hans-Ulrich Wehler told
the AP. ``The conservative historians' arguments fit into today's
political climate.''

   Europe today paid solemn tribute
to the millions of victims of World War II, which started 50 years
ago on Sept. 1 when a German warship opened fire on a tiny Polish
garrison.
   Adolf Hitler's troops quickly overran Poland, and the war spread
around the globe. In the end, 50 million people had died.
   By then the Nazis had shocked the world with the extermination of
6 million Jews, and the United States had forever changed warfare by
dropping nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.
   Many of Belgium's 6 million Dutch speakers woke up to a broadcast
of Hitler declaring war on Poland. BRT state radio opened its
foreign news report with a tape of the original declaration and
Germans cheering for their fuhrer.
   In London, a reunion was planned of some of the people who were
evacuated during Hitler's savage Blitzkrieg bombings of the city.
   Italy's leading daily, the Milan-based Corriere della Sera, told
its readers that ``Europe paid the price of its lacerations with the
loss of its political supremacy.''
   West Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl told a special Parliament
session in Bonn: ``We feel sorrow for the unspeakable suffering
which was caused to human beings and nations in the name of the
Germans and by the hand of the Germans.''
   ``We mourn for the many innocent victims from within our own
people,'' Kohl added.
   As he spoke, a group of young Poles sat in the visitors' gallery.
The group had been invited as a sign of reconciliation between West
Germany and Poland, which suffered more than any other country from
the Nazi atrocities.
   There still are nagging questions over West Germany's
relationship with Poland. Kohl has been under pressure from the
opposition Social Democratic Party to visit Poland, as he has
promised to do, and provide more financial aid to Warsaw.
   ``By delaying his visit, the chancellor is wasting good chances
to give a clear expression to the reconciliation process between
Poles and Germans,'' party leader Hans-Jochen Vogel said Thursday.
   The Communist Party daily in Czechoslovakia, Rude Pravo, called
the fighting that spread to all corners of the globe ``mankind's
most terrible war.''
   In Communist East Berlin, Foreign Minister Oskar Fischer called
today a day of ``recollection and sorrow'' during a speech to the
500-member People's Chamber.
   Fischer also repeated the commitment ``to do everything in our
power to insure that war and fascism never again threaten our lives
and the lives of our children.''
   Corriere della Sera called Hitler's Blitkrieg ``the technology of
a new Genghis Khan,'' the dreaded Mongol conqueror of central Asia.
   It noted that Hitler had the support of the ``German masses,''
also pointing out that European political clout plunged after World
War II.
   Some of the most closely watched events were scheduled in Poland.
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski was to speak at Westerplatte on the
Baltic coast, where the first shots were fired.
   ``We will pay homage to all victims of the war, we will pay
homage to its heroes and we will express the will to live in
peace,'' said Wlodzimierz Lozinski, a spokesman for Jaruzelski.
   American conductor Leonard Bernstein was to lead an
internationally televised memorial concert in Warsaw, and Pope John
Paul II was to address fellow Poles in Warsaw by a TV hookup.
   But an event to bring together members of the world's dominant
religions to pray for peace appeared likely to be marred by a
boycott by Poland's only rabbi.
   Rabbi Menachem Joskowicz said he would stay away because the
Roman Catholic Church has not removed a convent from the Auschwitz
concentration camp that many consider offensive to the memory of the
2.5 million Jews killed there.
   Fifty years after the outbreak of World War II, there are still
many unresolved issues traceable to Adolf Hitler's dictatorship.
   They include the role of secret protocols in the 1939
non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.
   The agreement allowed the Soviets to take over the Baltic
republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and Western accounts say
the pact paved the way for the start of World War II.
   Recent Soviet reforms have emboldened residents of the Baltics,
now the site of a growing independence movement.
   The Kremlin on Thursday called World War II ``the most horrible
and destructive of all wars.'' The commentary from the official
Soviet news agency Tass then quickly lept to how the ``lessons of
the past'' should lead the West to agreeing with Moscow on arms
control issues.
   In Bonn, ultra-conservative Finance Minister Theo Waigel said he
did not deny ``one iota of German guilt'' for the war. But he added
that ``a one-sided view of history with the conclusion that only the
Germans are burdened with guilt would be unbearable and would lead
to dangerous condemnations.''
   Ultra-conservatives have long asserted that Soviet dictator Josef
Stalin also shares some of the blame for the outbreak of the war.

   The furor over a Kristallnacht speech
made by the parliament president, who resigned under intense
criticism, reveals West Germans' lingering sensitivity to the Nazi
past.
   The address by Bundestag President Philipp Jenninger prompted
charges that some Germans have not honestly faced up to what
occurred under Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, including the
extermination of 6 million Jews.
   ``The background of what happened is the inability of many
Germans to stand up to their own past,'' the leftist Greens party
said before Jenniger, a conservative Christian Democrat, resigned
Friday.
   In his speech Thursday marking the 50th anniversary of
Kristallnacht when Nazi thugs attacked Jews, Jenninger attempted to
set the scene of Germany in the 1930s when Hitler came to power,
saying Germans initially found the Nazi era ``glorious.''
   Jenninger says the speech was misunderstood and that he is an
``uncompromising foe of every type of totalitarian rule.''
   Both West Germany and communist East Germany devoted themselves
this week to decrying Kristallnacht, or Crystal Night, of Nov. 9-10,
1938, the prelude to the Holocaust. The night was named for the
shards of glass that littered streets after Nazis smashed and burned
Jewish business, homes and synagogues.
   West German President Richard von Weizsaecker has insisted
Germans bore full responsiblity for the Nazi era and warned against
any attempts to play down its horrors.
   ``Nothing that historical science brings to light today can
diminish the crimes of the Nazi era,'' Weizsaecker said last month.
   The East German government has also denounced the Nazi years but
rejects responsibility for Nazi crimes, they say, because the crimes
occurred before the 1949 founding of the communist country. West
Germany was founded the same year.
   For all their well-intentioned effort, the remembrances of
Kristallnacht this week went awry with Jenninger's speech.
   Jenninger recalled that many Germans in the 1930s at first felt
Hitler brought them ``glorious times.''
   His address ignited a storm of protest _ at home and abroad.
   Politicians across the political spectrum called for Jenninger to
resign.
   Angry responses came from Israel and from Jewish leaders in the
United States.
   East Germany's official news agency ADN called the Jenninger
speech ``a scandal.''
   Newspapers reported Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a close friend of
Jenninger, called him to the office to criticize him for the
emotionless tone of the speech.
   The leftist Greens said Jenninger's speech showed that despite
the passage of 43 years, many West Germans still have not
sufficiently come to grips with what happened under Hitler's rule.
   Hans-Jochen Vogel, head of the opposition Social Democrats, said,
``This event shows us how the darkest chapter of German history is
still a present-day thing.''
   In New York, Morris Abram, chairman of the Conference of
Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, said: ``Speaker
Jenninger, regardless of his intentions, was guilty of insensitivity
to that which can never be forgotten or forgiven.''
   But many observers rushed to his side, pointing to Jenninger's
record as a steadfast supporter of Israel. Also, no one questioned
his assertions that he is anti-Nazi.
   The conservative daily newspaper Die Welt in today's editions
said Jenninger's main error was the tone of his speech could have
given the impression he had ``found a way to understand the
developments of 50 years ago'' without balancing that against
harsher criticism of the Nazi era.
   The controversy is likely to keep West Germans thinking about how
best to deal with recollections of the Nazi years, the newspaper
said.
   ``The reasons for the fast plummet of the second-ranking official
in our country will be occupying us for a long time,'' Die Welt said.
   A leader of West Germany's Jewish community Thursday defended
Jenninger's speech.
   ``I welcome that the Parliament president described in full
clarity what was happening in Germany between 1933 and 1938,'' said
Michael Fuerst, a deputy chairman of the Central Council of Jews in
West Germany.
   ``Especially the fact that everything that Hitler did was
strongly supported by the masses of all Germans,'' Fuerst said.
   But Friday, Jewish council chairman Heinz Galinski was quoted as
disavowing his deputy's comments.
   ``No one is supporting him. That's shown by the numerous protests
that have reached me from all Jewish communities,'' the Neue Presse
of Hanover quoted Galinski as saying.
   The newspaper also quoted Galinski as saying Fuerst might lose
his job.

AN HONOURABLE DEFEAT by Anton Gill Heinemann Pounds 20, 293 pages
Between Hitler's assumption of power in 1933 and his suicide in 1945, three
million Germans spent time in prison or concentration camps on political
grounds or for Resistance activities. Efforts were made to overthrow Hitler,
and a number involved assassination attempts: bombs in Smolensk, Gerdorff
and Rastenburg, guns elsewhere; one man, Maurice Bavaud, tried to shoot him
on three separate occasions. But Hitler seems to have had an evil
inviolability.
These facts, Anton Gill tells us in his history of internal German
opposition to Nazism, speak for themselves. They bear witness that there was
honour in Germany in those terrible years, when to go along with the
criminal regime's excesses was easier by far than to dissent. Dissenters met
with a brutal answer: torture, imprisonment or a Gestapo bullet were the
likelihoods, yet nearly a tenth of the German population risked them.
Gill is an historian and commentator who has made the Germany of the period
brilliantly his own. In A Dance Between Flames, an account of life in Berlin
between the wars, he anticipated some of what this book records: the courage
of Germans faced with the cruel hubris, or the supine acceptance of the
majority of their fellows.
Opposition to Nazism came from the Social Democrats, the Communists, some
churchmen, student groups, and the patrician right. Because the two former
were organised parties with identifiable members - and because they were
hopelessly at odds with each other and therefore ineffective as oppositions
 -they were relatively easy for Hitler to destroy. He did so quickly,
leaving only isolated groups of pastors, students and noblemen working
uncertainly in a murderous environment of fear.
The most dramatic of the attempts against Hitler is well known. It has just
occupied centre-stage in the 50th anniversary celebrations of the German
Resistance. On July 20 1944 a colonel in the German army, Count Claus von
Stauffenberg, exploded a bomb in the conference room of Hitler's
headquarters, the Wolf's Lair at Rastenburg, while Hitler sat consulting his
staff. By a perverse miracle Hitler survived practically unscathed although
a number of those sitting around him died. Back in Berlin a secret
government-in-waiting was readying itself to take power. But the failure of
the plot meant that within hours they and Stauffenberg were being dragged
before a firing-squad.
This vertiginous effort was motivated by the fear of some Army officers that
if peace were not made quickly Germany would be pulverised. They were right,
although they could not foresee the benefits this painful expedient would
yield in the longer term. But it is not clear how much they were motivated
by still deeper reasons: by horror at the slaughter of Jewry, and by
opposition to the Gestapo state.
Such resistance came from other quarters, from men like the theologian
Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who died in a concentration camp, or the student
activists of the White Rose, a Resistance group that leafletted against the
Nazi regime under its very nose during the height of the war. With terrible
inevitability such people were arrested and shot or hanged. It is surprising
how many of them there were, and with what extraordinary courage they acted.
Gill details them all, and their tales make compulsive reading.
One young man, Hans Scholl, who with his sister Sophie was executed by the
Gestapo, was moved to resistance by witnessing the maltreatment of Russian
prisoners and Jews. 'One day he gave his tobacco to an old man,' Gill
relates, 'and his iron rations to a girl. The girl had thrown the rations
back at him, but he had picked them up, plucked a daisy, placed it on the
pile of rations, and laid them at her feet. After a moment's hesitation she
had accepted them, and put the flower in her hair.'
This story is emblematic of suffering on the one part, courage on the other.
Struggle against tyranny is one of the noblest human endeavours, just as
tyranny and oppression are amongst the most vile. In Germany during the Nazi
years a Manichaean struggle was waged internally; an unequal struggle,
because the evil was great, the complicity of the majority weighty, the
resisters relatively few and their struggles fragmented. But it was an
honourable struggle, full of hope for the human condition.

<HEAD>Researcher Says Hitler Suffered From Parkinson's Disease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West German researcher has
concluded that Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler suffered from Parkinson's
disease during the last years of his life, a leading newspaper
reported Wednesday.
   The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper said that Ellen
Gibbels, a neurology and psychiatry professor at the University
Psychiatric Clinic in Cologne, had examined Hitler's medical records
and had studied newsreels of the Nazi leader from the years
1940-1945.
   Hitler's health deteriorated greatly toward the end of his life,
and there has been previous speculation that he suffered from
Parkinson's disease.
   Parkinson's disease is a degenerative illness suffered in later
life. It is often characterized by tremors, muscular rigidity or
loss of balance.
   ``Adolf Hitler suffered in his last years from a definite
Parkinson's syndrome,'' the newspaper said in summarizing her
research.
   Ms. Gibbels based her conclusions on indicators such as
impairment of Hitler's arm movements, a shortening of his strides,
changes in his facial appearance and a trembling of his left hand,
the newspaper reported.
   Hitler committed suicide at the age of 56 on April 30, 1945, in
his bunker in Berlin. In addition to suffering from tremblings and
limb impairments, he also had become increasingly irritable and
suspicious of those around him.
   ``The researcher now wants to examine which effects the
Parkinson's disease may have had on the dictator's mental functions
and therefore also in the political and military decisions,'' the
newspaper said.

<HEAD>Report on Soviet Internment Camp Where Thousands of Germans Died</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have discovered mass graves
containing thousands of victims of a former Soviet internment camp
from the Stalin era, an East German newspaper reported today.
   Among those killed at the camp were Nazi prisoners of war such
as SS members, police officers, Nazi party officials and former
soldiers in Adolf Hitler's army, the Berliner Zeitung said.
   But the newspaper said victims also included ``many innocent
people'' and teen-agers. The youngest victim was 12 years old, it
quoted a surviving inmate as saying. The report did not say how
many thousands of bodies were found.
   The camp was run by the Soviet Union's dreaded NKVD state
security force, a forerunner of the KGB, according to the report. A
local historian discovered the remains earlier this month at
Fuenfeichen near Neubrandenburg, 80 miles north of Berlin, the East
Berlin newspaper said.
   Berliner Zeitung quoted West German estimates that 65,000 men,
women and children died in Red Army imprisonment at the end of
World War II. It likened the ``Stalinist terror'' to Nazi death
camps.
   The report, accompanied by a graphic photograph of an uncovered
skeleton, would have been impossible before the peaceful revolt
that toppled hard-line East German Communist leader Erich Honecker
in October and set the country on course for democracy.
   East Germany, formed out of Soviet-occupied Germany after the
fall of Hitler's Third Reich, was a particularly staunch Soviet
ally for decades but now is dealing publicly with its past.
   This includes reports on brutality in the postwar period when
the Soviet bloc was in the iron grip of Kremlin chief Josef Stalin.
   Berliner Zeitung noted that many German Communists and
socialists were also killed in Soviet camps.
   Forest wardens and farmers knew about Fuenfeichen but kept
silent until now, the newspaper said.
   The camp operated from April 1945 until October 1948. Many
inmates were taken to the Soviet Union when the Red Army closed it
and were never heard from again, the report said.
   It said one prisoner who died there had just been released from
a Nazi camp and was arrested by the Soviets because he resisted the
expropriation of his home.

<TEXT>
   A Jewish official who resigned under
fire after defending a blunt speech about the Nazi era said West
Germany's top Jewish leader pays too much attention to the problem
of antisemitism, a newspaper said Sunday.
   In a related incident, a city council member resigned after a
newspaper quoted him as saying ``they still haven't killed enough
Jews.''
   Both incidents surrounded West Germany's observance of the
anniversary of the Nov.9-10, 1938 Kristallnacht, the night of Nazi
terror against Jews that signaled the coming Holocaust.
   The Aachen Nachtrichten newspaper quoted witnesses as saying
councilor Willi Vossen Vossen made the comment as the Wegberg city
council reviewed plans to mark the anniversary.
   Vossen's wife on Sunday said her husband would not comment on the
newspaper report. She denied he made the remark.
   ``He didn't say anything like that at all,'' said Mrs. Vossen in
a telephone interview. She refused to give her first name.
   Wegberg, a city of 25,000 people, is 30 miles northwest of
Cologne.
   The newspaper Die Welt quoted Michael Fuerst as saying that
Jewish officials should concentrate more on day-to-day problems of
German Jews and place less emphasis on threats from antisemitism.
   ``The chairman of the Jewish Supervisory Council, Heinz Galinski,
places too much emphasis on the problem of antisemitism,'' it quoted
Fuerst as saying.
   Fuerst was the No.2 official in West Germany's Jewish community
until he resigned last week under heavy criticism from Galinski.
   Fuerst got into trouble with Galinski after defending a Nov. 10
speech by then-Parliament President Philipp Jenninger marking the
Kristallnacht anniversary.
   In his address, Jenninger reminded his audience that many Germans
initially embraced Hitler's campaigns. The speech outraged Jews and
others, who maintained his comments were not balanced with strong
condemnation of the Nazi atrocities. Jenninger resigned the next day.
   Fuerst had defended the speech, saying Jenninger had said ``with
full clarity'' what occurred in Germany after Hitler took power.
   Die Welt's report is to appear in Monday editions. The newspaper
telexed the report to other news organizations in advance.
   The Aachen newspaper quoted unidentified council members as
saying Vossen said during a meeting, ``They still haven't killed
enough Jews.''
   Mayor Fritz Jakobs said he did not know Vossen's exact words, but
council members told him it was ``something very similar'' to what
the newspaper reported.
   The mayor, speaking by telephone, read a statement that was
approved by the council after Vossen's resignation.
   It said, in part, ``I wish to state our deep concern. We distance
ourselves in every way from this unbearable and shameful remark.''

<HEAD>Report On Soviet Internment Camp Where Thousands Died</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An East German newspaper on Saturday reported
the discovery of mass graves of thousands of people who died at a
former Soviet prison camp set up after World War II. It said many
were innocent civilians.
   The dead included Nazi war prisoners, such as members of the
paramilitary SS, Nazi party officials and soldiers in Hitler's
army, Berliner Zeitung reported.
   But among the victims were ``many innocent people'' and
children, it reported. The youngest victim was 12 years old, it
quoted a surviving inmate as saying. There was no word on how the
victims died.
   A local historian discovered the remains this month at the camp,
which was in Fuenfeichen, 80 miles north of East Berlin. It was run
by the dreaded NKVD state security force, a forerunner of the
Soviet KGB, according to the report.
   Berliner Zeitung quoted West German estimates that 65,000 men,
women and children died in Red Army imprisonment at the end of
World War II. It likened the ``Stalinist terror'' to Nazi death
camps.
   The report, accompanied by a graphic photograph of a skeleton,
would have been impossible until the peaceful revolt that toppled
East Germany's hard-line Communist regime in October and set the
country on course for democracy.
   East Germany, formed out of Soviet-occupied Germany after the
fall of Hitler's Third Reich, was a particularly staunch Soviet
ally for decades but now is dealing publicly with its past. This
includes reports on brutality in the postwar period, when the
Soviet bloc was in the iron grip of Kremlin chief Josef Stalin.
   Berliner Zeitung noted that many German Communists and
socialists were also killed in Soviet camps.
   Nearby residents and farmers knew about Fuenfeichen but kept
silent until now, the paper said.
   The camp was in operation from April 1945 until October 1948.
Many inmates were taken to the Soviet Union when the Red Army
closed the camp and were never heard from again, the report said.
   It said one prisoner who died had just been released from a Nazi
camp and was arrested by the Soviets because he resisted the
expropriation of his home.

<HEAD>American Rabbi: Message of Hope for East German Jews On Rosh
Hashana</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Rabbi Herman Dicker says he's bringing a
message of hope to East Germany's tiny and isolated Jewish
community, but he says he'd like to see the communist government do
more for them.
   Dicker conducted a Rosh Hashana service for about 200 Jews
Sunday evening, as part of his two-week stay in East Berlin for the
high holidays. Rosh Hashana is the Jewish new year. The country's
practicing Jews, estimated to number between 450 and 600, have no
permanent rabbi.
   ``They (East German Jews) are somewhat isolated,'' the New York
rabbi told The Associated Press. ``I want to give them a feeling
they belong to a group. I'm bringing a message of hope.''
   While Dicker says he believes that ``things are loosening up,''
there is still more East Germany could do for Jews. ``An
improvement is possible,'' the 74-year-old rabbi said in the
interview in front of the Temple of Peace synagogue, the only
synagogue still in use in East Berlin.
   ``There is a recognition on the part of the officials that they
can do more than they have done in the past,'' Dicker said when
asked about Jewish life in East Germany. ``Things could be better.''
   He did not specify what improvements are needed.
   While emphasizing that part of his stay would include a ``spirit
of criticism,'' he said he did not wish to become embroiled in a
political dispute and said he had been well received.
   He is in East Berlin under an agreement worked out between East
Germany and the World Jewish Congress for the high holidays.
   Edgar M. Bronfman, president of the congress, said in July that
after years of pressure, there is a ``good chance'' that East
Germany would agree this fall to pay reparations to Holocaust
survivors.
   An estimated 6 million Jews died during Adolf Hitler's Third
Reich, and until now East Germany has refused to pay reparations.
   East Germany has agreed to restore a second East Berlin
synagogue that has fallen into disrepair.
   Dicker, now a research librarian at the Jewish Theological
Seminary in New York, was born in Hungary and was educated in
Berlin until 1936 when he was forced to flee by the Nazis. He
served as a chaplain with the U.S. Army in World War II and
participated in the liberation of a number of concentration camps,
including Mauthausen in Austria.
   Dicker said he would be ``a little sad'' to leave East Berlin's
Jews, a majority of them elderly people who survived the Holocaust.
   ``My ambition is great, but my effectiveness will be limited,''
he said, noting that Sunday's service was his first in a communist
country.
   The World Jewish Congress is searching for a rabbi to serve in
East Germany on what it calls a ``long-term appointment.''
   Dicker said he hopes the congress can find a such a rabbi.
   However, he added that finding a rabbi would be difficult. ``The
person would have to be part of Schiller and Goethe, but also be
horrified by Hitler.''

<TEXT>
   President Kurt Waldheim, himself accused
of war crimes, apologized on Austria's behalf Thursday for
atrocities Austrian Nazis committed after Adolf Hitler made his
native land part of Germany 50 years ago.
   ``We must not forget that many of the worst Nazi hangmen were
Austrians,'' he said in a TV speech. ``There were Austrians who
were victims and others who were perpetrators. As head of state of
the republic of Austria, I wish to apologize for Nazi crimes
committed by Austrians.''
   About 15,000 Viennese gathered for a rally outside City Hall on
the first of four solemn days marking the ``Anschluss'' of March
11, 1938, when German troops marched into Austria and were greeteed
by cheering crowds.
   Among the speakers were survivors of concentration camps and
Paul Grosz, who leads Vienna's community of 6,000 Jews.
   Austria's Jews ``cannot forget'' that 65,000 were killed by the
Nazis and many more thousands had to flee, Grosz said. ``We should
never let that stain of shame on the history of this city be
forgotten,'' he declared.
   Security was tight because of a bomb scare early Thursday.
Police removed cars parked nearby two hours before the rally began.
City officials prepared thousands of black ribbons bearing the
words ``50 Years, March 1938, Never Again.''
   An exhibit called ``Vienna 1938'' has been mounted at City Hall.
There are similar displays about the Nazi era at Linz, where Hitler
spent his youth; Salzburg, Innsbruck and Graz, where the Nazi
swastika was raised over the city hall even before German troops
arrived.
   Dozens of events are planned during the four days.
   Waldheim canceled a speech he was to have made at the official
government ceremony Friday _ some prominent Austrians had
threatened to stay away otherwise _ and substituted the televised
address Thursday in which he spoke of ``the avalanche of
suffering'' after annexation.
   He did not mention his own service in Hitler's army or a report
last month on his conduct as a lieutenant in the Balkans from 1942
to 1945.
   An international panel of historians, appointed by the
government at Waldheim's request, said he was in ``close
proximity'' to war crimes, knew of them and did not try to stop
them. The historians said they found no proof that he committed war
crimes, but left the question of guilt open.
   In his 12-minute speech Thursday, the former U.N.
secretary-general indicated again that he will not leave office
until his term expires in 1992. He announced plans for a ``moral
renewal'' program to counter disillusionment among young Austrians
about public service.
   At the rally, Grosz told the young: ``You are not the prisoners
of an evil past, because if you know it you are free to form the
present and the future creatively.''
   Hundreds of thousands of Austrians joined the Nazi party after
cheering German soldiers who poured across the border March 11-12,
1938, made Austria part of the Third Reich.
   Huge crowds welcomed Hitler when he entered his homeland in
triumph. By then thousands of Jews, intellectuals, Socialists and
Austrian nationalists had been jailed in a roundup overseen by SS
chief Heinrich Himmler.
   The Nazis said 99 percent of Austria's voters approved the
annexation in a nationwide referendum in April 1938.
   Austrians as both victims and perpetrators of Nazism was a theme
running through all pronouncements of major public figures as the
anniversary observance began.
   Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said in an interview with Western
news agencies that Austrians should learn from the past rather than
focusing on Waldheim.
   In a survey conducted for a television documentary, 47 percent
of 150 Austrians polled late last year said annexation brought both
good and bad results. Only 15 percent of those polled said it was
entirely bad.
   After 1918, when Austria lost its vast empire, politicians of
all parties had argued for union with Germany as a way to rescue
the economy and preserve the nation's German culture. The
enthusiasm of many wanted when Hitler gained control of Germany in
1933.
   Vranitzky said an important lesson of the 1930s was that
divisions between political parties never should be so deep again.
   After World War II, the past was suppressed the official view
came to be that Austria was Hitler's first victim. The controversy
over Waldheim's wartime past has prompted a much more thorough
investigation of the past.
   Mayor Helmut Zilk, unveiling a plaque to Vienna politicians who
died in concentration camps, said Thursday some Austrian ``victims
very quickly searched for victims of their own'' after 1938.
   ``We must openly admit this disgraceful fact and we should not
try to minimize it or play it down by a comparison with other
countries,'' he said.

   World War II began 50 years ago
Friday. One of many events marking the grim anniversary will be a
concert in Warsaw, the first target of blitzkrieg, Adolf Hitler's
fearsome ``lightning war.''
   The Soviet Union called the conflict ``the most horrible and
destructive of all wars.'' An ultra-conservative West German Cabinet
minister said Germans should not bear all the blame.
   More than 50 million people were killed in the war touched off by
the German invasion of Poland on Sept. 1, 1939. The Nazi
extermination of 6 million Jews shocked the world like no other
atrocity.
   Major events are scheduled for Friday in West Germany, East
Germany and Poland, including an internationally broadcast concert
in Warsaw conducted by Leonard Bernstein.
   Pope John Paul II used the occasion to declare: ``We have a duty
to learn from the past so that never again will there arise a set of
factors capable of triggering a similar conflagration.''
   In the statement issued last weekend, he called the Nazi
slaughter of Jews something ``which will forever remain a shame for
humanity.''
   John Paul is to address his Polish countrymen Friday evening by
means of a huge television screen set up in Royal Castle Square in
Warsaw's old city.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said Thursday: ``The sad
jubilee _ 50 years since the beginning of the most horrible and
destructive of all wars _ requires that the world public not only
learn the lessons of the past anew, but also determine guidelines
for the future.''
   Its commentary repeated Soviet calls for a reduction of armed
forces and weapons in Europe.
   Neues Deutschland, the official newspaper of East Germany's
Communist Party, said: ``The most important historical lesson of
Sept. 1, 1939, consists of never again letting fascism return.''
   In Hitler's native Austria, which he occupied and annexed in 1938
without firing a shot, the popular tabloid Kurier is running a daily
series it calls ``Hitler's War.''
   ``It scarcely ever happened in history that the responsibility
for a war was so clear,'' the newspaper said Monday. ``It was, in
the end, the work of one man. It was Hitler's war.''
   Austria has claimed to be the dictator's first victim.
   News media, politicians and intellectuals in West Germany have
used the anniversary for a review of Nazi atrocities.
   Special events included a concert Thursday night in Frankfurt
featuring violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter and Polish composer Krzysztof
Penderecki conducting his ``Polish Requiem.''
   As a gesture of reconciliation, the government said it was
willing to return the Polish Embassy in Berlin, seized by the Nazis
in 1941, to Polish ownership.
   The far right in Germany has taken the opportunity to try to
shift some of the blame.
   Theo Waigel, the federal finance minister, said he did not want
to deny ``one iota of German guilt'' for the Nazi era and the war,
but declared: ``A one-sided view of history with the conclusion that
only the Germans are burdened with guilt would be unbearable and
would lead to dangerous condemnations.''
   Waigel did not say who should share the guilt, but many on the
far right claim Soviet dictator Josef Stalin also was responsible.
The minister wrote in the latest issue of the Bayernkurier, party
organ of his ultraconservative Christian Social Union.
   Franz Schoenhuber, leader of the extremist Republican Party,
spoke of the ``war guilt of the Soviets, who together with Hitler
brought the people of Eastern Europe under their yoke'' _ a
reference to the Soviet absorption of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania
under a 1939 pact with Hitler.
   Schoenhuber said an international panel of historians should be
appointed to reassess whether Germans alone were responsible for the
war.
   At a service in Berlin, West German Jewish leader Heinz Galinski
denounced the resurgence of right-wing extremism in Germany.
   Anniversary events in Hungary included a live hookup with the
Voice of America, the BBC and Swiss radio Thursday night for a
dicussion show about the causes of the war and the postwar division
of Europe.

   Friedrun Huemer recently witnessed a street debate in Austria's capital between two old women. 

   One was the widow of an Austrian soldier who fell fighting for the German army at Stalingrad in World War II. 
The other's husband died fighting in the Austrian resistance against the Nazis. 

   "It was a classic clash of two worlds. 
Both ladies insisted their husbands were the true heroes and had done their duty," says Mrs. Huemer, a psychologist and organizer of a vigil last June outside Vienna's cathedral to honor the Austrian resistance. 
"It's amazing how much pent-up emotion there is." 

   Fifty years to the week after the Anschluss, the 1938 Nazi takeover of Austria, Austrians are immersed in a memorial-year flood of books, plays, films, exhibits and a television series confronting them with their long-suppressed wartime past. 

   The controversy surrounding Kurt Waldheim has deepened and complicated the nation's soul-searching. 
Last month, a commission concluded that Mr. Waldheim, elected president in 1986, had been far closer to Nazi atrocities than he has acknowledged. 
Demands that he resign, coupled with denunciations of Austria, polarized the nation. 

   While nearly 50% of Austrians surveyed say the memorial year further divides the nation, young people flock to lectures and demand Holocaust studies, synagogues are being renovated and vigils held, and newspapers run sections on the Anschluss. 
Austria was both "victim and perpetrator of Nazism," says historian Erika Weinzierl. 

   When 250,000 Viennese greeted Austrian-born Adolf Hitler a few days after German troops marched unopposed into Austria in March 1938, pictures of the event flashed around the world. 
But untold thousands remained home in fear and despair. 
If a planned plebiscite on Austria's independence had taken place, many historians believe Hitler would have gotten only 30% of the vote. 
Nor were all who cheered Hitler Nazis; many simply longed for union with stronger Germany. 

   After a rigged referendum that gave Hitler 99.7% of the vote, Austria was integrated into Germany. 
Austrians took part in the Holocaust, denouncing Jews, confiscating their property and sending them and others to concentration camps. 

   Austria lost 35,000 people in the resistance, 200,000 in combat and 65,000 murdered Jews. 
After the war, a coalition of the two main parties and a partnership of business and industry helped to create a stable democracy. 
Overt Nazi organizations were forbidden, 500,000 former Nazis were disfranchised until 1949 and of 60,000 Nazis investigated, 34 were executed. 

   But critics say real de-Nazification never took place. 
"Playing the role of the victim, Austria blamed Germany for Nazism. 
It never had a deep feeling of shame," says political scientist John Bunzl. 
Indeed, in 1949 the parties vied for the votes of the half-million former Nazis by bowing to anti-Semitic, German-nationalist tendencies. 

   Many students learned history as if the Austrian role in World War II never existed. 
A 1983 study of high-school pupils found that 18% blamed the Jews for the Holocaust. 

   Even so, many Austrians today seem eager for enlightenment. 
A highly praised TV series on Austrian history regularly draws as many as two million viewers. 
"It's not a question of collective guilt but of . . . 
Austria freeing itself of the historical burden by standing up and admitting it was all wrong," says Paul Grosz, head of Vienna's Jewish community. 

   The process is painful and risks renewed outbursts of anti-Semitism. 
Just a few days ago, vandals smeared a Vienna statue to Nazi victims with a swastika. 
Doron Rabinovic, a spokesman for Jewish students, says many Jews who "were under the illusion that Austria was somehow different from before" are now thinking of leaving. 
Vienna's pre-war community of 200,000 Jews numbers 6,000 today. 

   In many ways, Kurt Waldheim has come to embody Austria's conflicts over its past. 
The furor over whether he should resign forced him to cancel plans to speak at the Anschluss events, underlining deep divisions between his conservative backers and the Socialists. 

   Mr. Waldheim refuses to step down, citing his responsibility as an elected representative. 
Yesterday, he apologized for "the Nazi crimes committed by the Austrians" and pledged to work for improved public morality. 
But recent polls indicate he no longer commands an electoral majority. 
"Austrians are not jingoists at any price," says Christian Haerpfer, head of the Vienna-based Institute of Conflict Research. 
"They see he's bad for the country, a kind of political AIDS." 

   Western leaders have kept clear of Austria since he was elected, just as Austria is seeking to cement ties to the West. 
Exporters talk of a "Waldheim discount" necessary to sell their products. 

   "Earlier we were associated with the 'Sound of Music,'" says Anton Pelinka, a political scientist at the University of Innsbruck. 
"Now we're a Naziland. . . . 
Both stereotypes are ridiculous." 

   Clearly many Austrians would prefer Mr. Waldheim to take the initiative. 
If he goes, says one politician, "there will be a big sigh of relief." 

   Not everyone agrees. 
Some fear his departure would bury but not resolve bigger problems. 
Says Mrs. Huemer, the psychologist: "People will not change just because Waldheim resigns. 
What we need is an ongoing discussion about the past."

<TEXT>
   East Germany's first democratically elected
Parliament on Tuesday eulogized the millions of people who died at
the hands of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime.
   Recalling the horrors of the Nazis and the deaths of six million
Jews, in addition to millions of Russians, Poles and others,
Parliament President Sabine Bergmann-Pohl said ``the insane path of
German history found its end on May 8, 1945.''
   Referring to last fall's peaceful revolution that brought down
East Germany's hard-line Communist leadership and opened the way
for the reunification of East Germany and West Germany, Mrs.
Bergmann-Pohl said: ``Today we have the hope that May 8 does not
remain as the last mutually binding date for German history.''
   ``But it will always be closely tied to whatever happens along
our way into the future,'' she added.
   Also on Tuesday, a special ceremony dedicated to the thousands
of Soviet soldiers killed by Nazi troops in battles to capture
Berlin, was held at East Berlin's Treptow Park, the site of a war
memorial to the Soviets.
   Officials say about 5,000 Soviet soldiers died fighting the
Germans in the last few days of the war in Europe and the battle
for Berlin.
   The parliamentary ceremonies coincided with a meeting in East
Berlin's Palast Hotel between World Jewish Congress leader Edgar M.
Bronfman and East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere.
   Bronfman said at the meeting that a memorial should be erected
at the site of the Berlin Wall that was opened last Nov. 9, because
the date had ``dual importance.''
   On Nov. 9, 1938, Nazis killed dozens of Jews and ransacked
Jewish homes and stores in what became known as Kristallnacht, or
crystal night, because of the broken glass that littered the
streets afterward.
   ``Let me suggest that the date Nov. 9 is a really important date
in black distress and golden hope,'' Bronfman said.
   Prior to the meeting, leaders of the Jewish Congress held a
memorial ceremony at the Wannsee Villa in Berlin, where German
leaders met in 1942 to map out their so-called ``Final Solution''
that led to the death of 6 million Jews.

HITLER'S HOMETOWN IN A QUANDARY OVER MARKING 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS BIRTH

BRAUNAU, Austria 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This pleasant town across the Inn River from the West German state of Bavaria 
has decidely mixed feelings about a monument established to commemorate the 
activities of its most famous native son. 
</P>
<P>
The burghers are not quite sure how they want to commemorate, on Thursday, the 
100th anniversary of the man who was born in the three-story house at No. 15 
Salzburg Vorstadt -- Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
Since the end of World War II, most Braunauers would just as soon forget that 
Hitler was born here -- in effect subscribing to the adage that Austria has 
managed to convince the world that German-born Beethoven was Austrian and 
Hitler was German. None of the tourist brochures describing the attractive 
community of 16,000 mentions the German dictator, who committed suicide in 1945 
in his bunker in war-ravaged Berlin just 10 days after his 56th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moved Away as Infant 
</P>
<P>
But Hitler did come from here and Mayor Gerhard Skiba, a Socialist, has chosen 
to remind the world of that fact -- in a rather oblique way -- with a 
three-foot chunk of stone outside the house. 
</P>
<P>
An inscription chiseled on the granite from the quarry at the former Mauthausen 
concentration camp mentions neither Hitler nor the house but reads: 
</P>
<P>
 For Peace, Freedom and Democracy 
</P>
<P>
Never Again Fascism 
</P>
<P>
In Memory of the Millions of Dead. 
</P>
<P>
Skiba said: "As mayor, I have decided to erect a monument and reminder in front 
of Adolf Hitler's birthplace as a clear and open sign as to the way we in 
Braunau think about the past and remember the victims of fascism. 
</P>
<P>
"The 20th of April was in the past, and is in the present, a date which brings 
with it a particular meaning for our city -- through no fault of the citizens 
of Braunau." 
</P>
<P>
Skiba said the text "serves as a reminder, as a declaration and call to work 
against budding neo-Nazism and other obvious dangers to democracy." 
</P>
<P>
But other citizens say that Skiba is calling undeserved attention to Braunau's 
past, and they worry that the monument itself will attract neo-Nazis from 
Austria and Germany. Harald Klinger, district commissioner for the Braunau 
area, has received reports that neo-Nazis and others sympathetic to Hitler will 
gather here on April 20 to demonstrate. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have to reckon with violence," Klinger said. "We have to hope and pray 
no one gets killed. This could well be the last big anniversary here, but if 
there is a martyr we will have the same circus every year." 
</P>
<P>
The stone memorial outside the house, which is now used as a craft school for 
handicapped children, has become a magnet for snapshot-taking tourists, who 
might otherwise not have noticed the building just 50 yards from the city's 
main square. 
</P>
<P>
The irony is that, according to historians, Hitler never much cared for his 
birthplace. The family left when he was 3, first to Passau in 1892 and then in 
1895 to Linz, which Hitler regarded as his hometown. Hitler on several 
occasions said he remembered nothing about Braunau. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Returned Only Once 
</P>
<P>
The dictator came back only once, with German troops who annexed Austria in 
1938, and though the town staunchly supported the anschluss, or union, with 
Germany and made him an honorary citizen, Hitler never returned. 
</P>
<P>
Local historians point out that the name "Schicklgruber," which British leader 
Winston Churchill, among others, used to call the Fuehrer, resulted because his 
maternal grandmother, Maria Ann Schicklgruber, bore a child out of wedlock who 
was later given a step-uncle's name and became Hitler's father, Alois 
Schicklgruber. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the buff-and-white building at No. 15, which could stand a coat of 
paint, director Kurt Hell showed a visitor the brightly colored tapestries made 
by the children and said he did not know when the house was built. But he 
pointed out old wooden staircases and stone floors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attention a Nuisance 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody seemed to notice us before -- just the occasional tourist -- but now 
all the attention is getting to be a nuisance. We're trying to teach 
handicapped children. Actually, nobody knows what room Hitler was born in 
here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, townspeople said that the owner of the house, who rents it out, 
objected to a commemorative plaque being embedded in the wall -- and that is 
why Skiba placed the stone monument on the city street, next to a row of angled 
parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the nearby shopkeepers expressed indifference to the new stone marker, 
but one worker said: "I just don't like the look of it. I think it's ugly." 
</P>
<P>
A bookseller added: "All this is for the history books. I don't know why the 
mayor thought a marker was necessary." 
</P>
<P>
And another Braunauer commented, "Hitler was born an Austrian but he became a 
German." 
</P>
<P>
All around Braunau are reminders of the war, including a cemetery with World 
War I and World War II dead just outside of town. And the crypt of St. 
Stephen's Church, a 15th-Century building, bears the names of local residents 
who died in both wars. 
</P>
<P>
Hitler's name is missing, said Father Stefan Hofer, the parish priest, because 
he was not inducted into the army from Braunau. 
</P>
<P>
The priest said, "I think the inscription should have said, 'No more 
dictatorship,' rather than referring only to fascism. I really don't think it 
is fair to single out Braunau, since Hitler only lived here as an infant." 
</P>
<P>
Would the Hitler reminder be good or bad for Braunau? 
</P>
<P>
"We will see," said Father Hofer. 
</P>
<P>
And provincial official Klinger, looking uneasily toward April 20, cautioned: 
"The eyes of the world will be on us. The reputation of Austria is at stake."

   The German town of Dresden and the English city
of Coventry were officially enemies, but their grim, eerily similar
fates during World War II have drawn them together on the 50th
anniversary of the beginnng of the great conflict. Citizens of both
cities gathered for church services that were joined by a radio
linkup to recall their towns' flaming destruction a half century ago.

<TEXT>
   Once the jewel of Germany because of
its magnificent architecture, Dresden virtually burned to death a
half-century ago.
   For two days, Allied aircraft relentlessly bombed the city,
killing tens of thousands of people.
   In a solemn church service on Sunday, Dresden recalled the
firebombing and the Germans' own destruction of Coventry, England.
   Fifty years to the day after Britain entered the war, the people
and clergy of two cities spoke to each other via radio hookup and
shared their flaming pasts.
   ``We in Dresden, and you in Conventry ... we killed each others
people and we destroyed each others' cities,'' Rev. Christof Ziemer
told about 400 worshipers inside the Kruezkirche Lutheran Church and
500 others listening to his remarks inside Coventry Cathedral.
   ``We (Germans) are not minded to shake off the burden of our
guilt. But you have forgiven,'' he told his British listeners via
British Broadcasting Corp. hookup.
   Canon Paul Oestreicher of Coventry Cathedral told Dresden
residents he could never expect them to forget the firebombing of
Dresden in February 1945.
   ``When the war was practically over, and this city crowded with
refugees, British and American bombers turned it into a raging
inferno in which more women and children died than even in
Hiroshima,'' Oestreicher said.
   But Oestreicher also pointed out the horrors of the Nazi
Holocaust unleashed by the war that began when Hitler invaded Poland
on Sept. 1, 1939.
   ``I can't forget that many of my father's Jewish family were
killed in German gas chambers,'' said Oestreicher, who was born in
Germany but fled his homeland in 1939.
   An estimated 6 million Jews died in the Nazi Holocaust, many of
them gassed to death in German concentration camps.
   On Feb. 13-14 in 1945, combined Anglo-American bomber forces
attacked Dresden, creating a firestorm that destroyed the heart of
the city.
   Incendiary bombs set fire to wooden roofs that were hundreds of
years old. Heavy bombs created air suction that whipped up raging
balls of flames.
   Estimates of the dead range up to 135,000, many of them refugees
who had fled the Russian army that was rapidly advancing on Dresden,
93 miles south of Berlin.
   The skyline of this city of 500,000 still shows the marks of war,
such as the burned and gutted spires on the former Royal Palace.
   Downtown Dresden, once known for its lovely baroque and
Renaissance facades and spires, now has rows of post-war concrete
structures.
   Few of the city's old landmarks are still standing.
   Dresden and its destruction figured prominently in author Kurt
Vonnegut Jr.'s acclaimed 1969 novel, ``Slaughterhouse Five.''

from Bonn to Berlin, the old Prussian imperial capital. Now the leading
proponent of Prussian militarism is to get a new burial. Is there a sinister
conspiracy afoot? Can a Fourth Reich be far behind?  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  CONTROVERSY BORN IN PLAN TO REBURY PRUSSIAN
KING  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Such questions may seem far-fetched. But many Germans who worry about their
country's past and its future are mightily upset about the reburial of "Old
Fritz," as Frederick the Great was known to his subjects, on the anniversary
of his death in 1786.;    The great fear is that the ceremony will become an
excuse for a clash between neo-Nazis, who may decide to appropriate
Frederick's image for their own purposes, and extreme left-wingers hostile to
what they see as a Prussian revival.;    There is also consternation that
German military officers will take part in the ceremony and that Chancellor
Helmut Kohl will attend.;    Kohl sought to set fears at rest in a television
interview last week.;    "The old Prussia will not be reborn. . . . It has
vanished into history," he said. "Militarism will not be glorified. It doesn't
exist and never will again in Germany.";    But back to Frederick. The
Hohenzollern ruler, who extended Prussian power and paved the way for the 1871
German empire, specified in his will that he wanted to be buried next to his
greyhound hunting dogs, about a dozen of them, who were planted just behind
the French Rococo-style Sanssouci palace that Frederick built outside Potsdam
in the middle of the 18th century.;    But the nephew who succeeded him,
Kaiser Frederick William II, ignored the will. He had Frederick buried in
Potsdam's Garnisonkirche (Garrison Church) beside the father he hated,
Frederick William I, who once planned to have him beheaded.;    Coffins moved
to bunker; In 1943 the Nazis, fearing that allied bombing raids might hit the
church, moved their coffins into a bunker at Potsdam that had been built by
Field Marshal Herman Goering's Luftwaffe as his underground headquarters. Just
in time, too; the church later was demolished in a bombing raid.;    With
allied forces bearing down in 1945, Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler ordered the
coffins moved to a salt mine in Thuringia in southeastern Germany. There they
were found by U.S. forces.;    The Americans moved the royal remains to the
old university town of Marburg. They remained there until 1952, when they were
transferred to the Hohenzollern family's Hechingen Castle near Stuttgart.;   
The head of the family, Prince Louis Ferdinand, 84, advised Potsdam
authorities early this year that he would like to bring the well-traveled
bodies home. They will arrive Saturday by train at the royal station near
Potsdam, which has not been used since the last kaiser, William II, abdicated
after World War I.;    The coffins will be placed on horse-drawn carriages,
and Frederick finally will be separated from his detested father. Frederick
William's coffin will be taken to the Friedens (Peace) Church for burial, and
Frederick's will go to Sanssouci.;    Potsdam's leaders say they could do
without the controversy. Mayor Horst Gramlich, a Social Democrat, likes to
stress Potsdam's tradition as a city of tolerance. When Jews were persecuted
in Russia, and Huguenots in France, they were given sanctuary in Potsdam.;   
Voltaire's pen pal;  This tolerance was partly a legacy of Frederick, a
Huguenot-educated ruler who was enthralled by the French Enlightenment. He
spoke French in preference to German, called himself Frederic and made a pen
pal of the French philosopher Voltaire, who became Frederick's court
philosopher for three years starting in 1750.;    Under Voltaire's tutelage,
he wrote a book, "Antimachiavel," in which he outlined a princely ethic based
on virtue, justice and responsibility. His enlightened views led him to
abolish torture, press censorship and religious discrimination.;    But these
acts are remembered dimly. Frederick is known primarily as one of history's
great military strategists, an ironic twist in view of his childhood
experiences.;    Early in life, he displayed an interest in poetry, music and
philosophy. This angered his father, who wanted to instill a martial spirit in
his son. The father sometimes thrashed him in public and made him kiss his
boots.;    Frederick tried to escape to England with a friend in 1730, but
they were caught. Frederick's father had the friend beheaded and forced his
son to watch. He made clear that he intended the same punishment for his son,
whom he already had eliminated from the line of succession.;    But he later
pardoned Frederick, on condition that he serve in the civil administration.;  
 Young, rich invader;  Frederick William died in 1740. Within months of coming
to the throne, Frederick invaded Silesia -- then a part of the Austrian
Empire, now part of Poland. With characteristic humor, Frederick explained: "I
was young, had plenty of money and a large army and wanted to see my name in
the newspapers.";    In the War of the Austrian Succession, he completed his
takeover of Silesia. Then he invaded Bohemia and took Prague. In 1745, at age
33, Frederick was called "the Great" and was a hero in most of Europe.;    He
was victorious again, with the help of British money, in the Seven Years' War
that began in 1756, involving Austria, Russia and France. Prussia then became
the dominant power in Europe.;    Frederick's military successes led the
separate German states to look to Prussia for leadership. A German empire
based on Prussian militarism finally came into being in 1871.;    In 1933,
Nazi propaganda chief Josef Goebbels hit upon the idea of appropriating
Frederick's ghost to serve the interests of the Third Reich. To try to win
monarchist backing, Goebbels arranged a mass in the Garrison Church to
symbolize the marriage of Prussian glory and Nazi spirit. Hitler, in cutaway
coat, placed a golden wreath at Frederick's tomb.;    Hitler had come to power
only months earlier, and militarism was again about to dominate German history.  </TEXT>

<P>
Half a century ago, after six years in power, Adolf Hitler looked invincible. 
He ordered his generals to prepare for the invasion of Poland, in the 
blitzkrieg that precipitated World War II. An oral history, "Voices From the 
Third Reich," to be published this month by Regnery Gateway Inc., examines what 
it was like to watch and participate in the rise of Hitler from many points of 
view -- concentration camp victims, SS men, resistance activists, teen-age 
Nazis, emigres. The following is adapted from the book's epilogue: 
</P>
<P>
The Third Reich changed the history of the world, yet it endured for only a 
brief moment in time -- 12 years. The years of Nazi rule left Germany's cities 
destroyed, its people scattered, its government abolished. Foreign soldiers 
walked its streets as masters while millions of refugees sought safety from an 
Eastern Europe staging its own solution of the German question by systematic, 
brutal expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
What had become of the cheering crowds of 1933? Of 1938? Were the wartime 
Germans a generation of opportunists, rejecting the Nazi order only when the 
bill came due? This question is particularly significant because of the nature 
of the National Socialist regime. It was not a state like all the rest, a state 
which made its bid for world power, fought a war and lost. It was a criminal 
system that committed its atrocities "in the name of the German people." 
</P>
<P>
But questions of right and wrong are seldom as obvious at the time as they seem 
in retrospect, even under Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
The pace of events was rapid enough to sweep along millions of people with a 
current that seemed to flow ever faster. Modern states and modern ideologies 
have the means to blur processes of choice and action. Particularly for young 
people, there was no time to reflect, no refuge from the endless pressure to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
World War II had no parallel in history. It was waged without rules or mercy. 
It assumed a life of its own, as though it would go on forever. Yet at the same 
time it was waged with malevolent intelligence. No one in Europe escaped it. 
World War II mobilized children for the front. It made women the prizes of 
victory. It demanded the annihilation of entire peoples. It generated realities 
worse than any nightmare. Auschwitz, Stalingrad, and Berlin have in common that 
the abnormal became the stuff of everyday life. Chaos seemed natural. It was 
the way things had always been, the way things always would be. 
</P>
<P>
Clear thought was further discouraged by ignorance based on lack of 
information. Books, newspapers, radio, all were rigidly controlled. Even 
private conversations involved significant risk. Soldiers, whether at the front 
or in home garrisons, were in an even more restricted environment than 
civilians. Thousands of men in Werhmacht uniforms were executed or imprisoned 
for "damaging the national war effort" by "crimes" as insignificant as 
listening to foreign radio broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
If guessing was risky, knowing too much posed more than simple physical danger. 
Those who by chance glanced into the Nazi abyss promptly looked away. They 
denied it existed. They talked of "exceptions" or "excesses." They forced 
themselves to forget. Anything was preferable to the truth, because the truth 
was too horrible to acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
The men and women who share their lives in "Voices From the Third Reich" 
challenge three familiar myths about Germans under National Socialism. The 
first is the myth of collective opposition, the myth that the German people 
from the beginning rejected Hitler's siren call. The myth makes everyone at 
heart a Christian, a Marxist, a simple soldier or something else having as 
little as possible to do with National Socialism. Susanne Ritters, 17 at war's 
end, offers a bitter critique: 
</P>
<P>
"We believed in Hitler. We believed in the whole system, the entire leadership. 
There we were, already half-dead, still believing in victory. We could not do 
anything else. That was our generation and he was our idol. We didn't just 
adopt something. It was a given. It came from inside of us. And we sucked it in 
like mother's milk." 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is also denial of an opposing myth, the myth of collective guilt that 
makes every German living through this period an active, committed Nazi, 
endorsing when not supporting every aspect of the regime. Richard Lowenthal, 
forced into exile as a Jew and a Social Democrat, says he was "very much aware 
that anti-Semitism had always existed in Germany, but before Hitler's time it 
was confined to a very small minority. If I were to compare Germany with other 
countries before Hitler, I could say that there was considerably less 
anti-Semitism in Germany than in France, to say nothing of Poland or Austria. 
</P>
<P>
"What many people fail to realize is that Hitler did not come to power because 
of his anti-Semitism . . . . Hitler's coming to power was based on a wave of 
nationalism and the miserable economic situation in Germany." 
</P>
<P>
What attracted millions of Germans were National Socialism's positive appeals. 
Family, community, homeland -- these values are not contemptible in themselves, 
nor were they invented by the Nazis. Hitler spoke to a desire to have things 
better. He even delivered -- at least for a while -- long enough to add the 
German people to his list of victims. 
</P>
<P>
Our interview partners finally challenge a third myth -- the myth of oblivion, 
sometimes described as "Waldheimer's Disease": Live long enough and you forget 
you were ever a Nazi. German history neither began nor ended in 1945. The 
Federal Republic sometimes speaks of a "Zero Hour" from which all somehow began 
anew. East Germany boasts of a postwar revolution which swept away the old 
order. But the generation that bore the burden of Hitler's war remembers, far 
too well for its own comfort, the part it played. 
</P>
<P>
For the survivors, their war was not a collective experience. It was a 
composite of personal events and decisions, random happenings and blind chance 
against a background of confusion. They have struggled -- not least by 
participating in this project -- to come to terms with their country's history 
on a personal level. If recollection sometimes finds positive elements -- 
courage, comradeship, empathy -- that should occasion neither alarm nor 
surprise. Such memories are not harbingers of a Fourth Reich. They are rather 
part of the process of mastering a painful past. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1945, Western thought has been permeated by a utopianism leaving no room 
for misjudgment, no room for immaturity, no room for conversion. What is 
important is being right, morally right, the first time and from the first 
hour. In both Germanys younger generations say, "It would never have happened 
to us." They declare themselves too clever, too sophisticated, to have become 
part of Hitler's Reich. Our interview partners' experiences suggest another 
important lesson: the potential to learn from error, to learn from history, 
which remains a record of mistakes made for good reasons. They have been taught 
humility, and have paid high prices for the instruction. 
</P>
<P>
"Greater Germany" died with Hitler. But "Germany" remains a living concept on 
both sides of the current border. The emphasis may differ, but the roots are 
the same: two states, but one ethnic and cultural entity, one nation. The war 
generation built this new Germany as it had fought for the old one. After the 
war, this generation had to ask itself: What is more important, yesterday or 
tomorrow? Its answer can be seen by any visitor. Civilization owes these men 
and women, if not gratitude, then at least recognition.

<TEXT>
   Neo-Nazis are preparing
commemorations on the 100th anniversary of Adolf Hitler's birth next
month and West German officials are bracing for possible outbreaks
of rightist violence.
   The Nazi dictator was born April 20, 1889, in the Austrian
village of Braunau just over the border from Bavaria.
   ``This is the most important event we've had in a long time,''
said Michael Kuehnen, West German neo-Nazi leader.
   The preparations come as West Germans warily eye a rise in
extreme-rightist sentiments in their country. In January, for
example, the Republican Party made a strong showing in West Berlin's
elections by calling for the expulsion of foreigners and
asylum-seekers.
   Neo-Nazis from several countries are expected at the ``European
Hitler convention'' specifically designed to commemorate the
dictator's 100th birthday, but Kuehnen declined to specify exactly
when or where it will take place.
   ``We don't want to give the country time to gear up to prevent
it,'' he said but added that Spain or Scandinavia were possible
places. Federal law bars such a meeting in West Germany, although
Kuehnen promises smaller birthday commemorations in the Frankfurt
area.
   The neo-Nazi leader, who often wears a brown shirt and black
pants, said the number of participants at the Hitler convention
could range from 1,000 to ``several thousand'' depending on the
location.
   Kuehnen, whose organizing committee even has a logo with the
initials ``AH'' in the center, insisted there will be no ``organized
violence'' on the Hitler anniversary.
   ``But we aren't responsible for every young person and every
soccer rowdy,'' the 33-year-old neo-Nazi added in a telephone
interview. Fringe groups espousing neo-Nazi and rightist beliefs
occasionally disturb professional soccer games in West Germany.
   Kuehnen, who has spent more than seven years in prison for
neo-Nazi activities, has set up an office in Frankfurt to organize
the birthday event with the help of his followers. He's hoping
neo-Nazis and right-wing extremists from Spain, France, Denmark,
Belgium and Norway as well as West Germany will attend the European
convention.
   Although the birthday falls in April, there were reports as early
as January about plans for an observance in the West German news
media.
   The newsmagazine Der Spiegel said on Jan. 30 that this year's
celebrations are meant to attract public attention and distribute
propaganda, in contrast to previous years.
   In the past ``right-wing extremist cronies drank to the Fuehrer
in the back rooms of German bars and in hotels of Hitler's Austrian
birthplace of Braunau,'' Der Spiegel noted.
   Braunau itself was the site of a clash between neo-Nazis and
pro-Communists on Hitler's 90th birthday in 1979.
   This past Jan. 22, the conservative Welt am Sonntag newspaper
said officials already were bracing for acts of violence and that
Jews and foreigners were possible targets.
   Matthias Strohs, a spokesman on internal security issues for the
Baden-Wuerttemberg state Interior Ministry, agrees that trouble
could break out.
   ``There's no question _ you can count on acts of violence,'' he
said. ``The possible targets range from foreigners, to German
officials and allied military installations.''
   Allies France, Britain and the United States drew the neo-Nazis'
wrath for keeping Rudolf Hess, Hitler's deputy, in prison until he
died in what was officially determined as a suicide in 1987,
although the Soviets were primarily responsible for rejecting pleas
for clemency.
   Strohs, speaking by telephone from his office in Stuttgart, said
vandalism and pro-Nazi slogans painted on walls were also a
possibility around the time of the birthday.
   The spokesman said officials assume older-generation Nazis will
also commemorate Hitler's birthday, but in a much less public way.
   ``The older ones are much more careful in the way they act,''
Strohs said. ``They won't make such a spectacle out in the public.
It will be more of an internal affair.''
   Alfons Metzger, spokesman for the Bavarian Interior Ministry also
said ``violence can't be ruled out'' as a possibility on the Hitler
birthday and that police are alerted to it.
   Several smaller neo-Nazi groups also routinely celebrate Hitler's
birthday, and are expected to do so again this year. Federal
officials say there are about 28,300 right-wing extremists in this
country of 61.3 million people.
   The Deutsche Volksunion (German People's Union), identified by
federal authorities as West Germany's largest right-wing extremist
organization, has totally disassociated itself from the Hitler
commemorations.
   ``We are convinced that on April 20, 1989, there will be several
birthday celebrations for Hitler,'' said Bernd Droese, spokesman for
the party, which claims a membership of 25,000. ``Fifty percent of
them will take place in loony bins, where some people assert they
are the reincarnation of the Fuehrer.
   ``The other 50 percent will be organized by agents and
provocateurs who want to let the specter of the Fuehrer ghost wander
around.''

<HEAD>Dispute Over Captured Germans Who Helped Soviets In War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An emotional dispute has broken out in West
Germany over whether imprisoned German soldiers who spread
propaganda for their Soviet captors during World War II were
traitors or heroes.
   ``Many people consider these people traitors. But that's not the
case. They were opponents of the (Nazi) regime,'' said Peter
Steinbach.
   Steinbach, a Passau University historian, arranged an exhibit
called ``Resistance to National Socialism'' that has generated
controversy.
   The failed July 20, 1944 attempt by German generals to kill
Hitler is included in the Berlin exhibit, as are the wartime calls
for anti-Nazi actions by a group of university students known as
the White Rose.
   In both cases, those brave enough to oppose Hitler were tortured
and executed.
   But along with documents and photographs showing such widely
recognized attempts to disrupt the Third Reich is a controversial
display about thousands of captured German soldiers in Soviet
prisons who opposed the Third Reich and wanted the war to end.
   Some members of the National Committee for a Free Germany did
propaganda work for the Soviets during the war, using loudspeakers
at the front to urge German soldiers to quit fighting.
   That part of the exhibit has angered Germans who do not believe
the soldiers deserve the same place of honor as people like Claus
von Stauffenberg, who was executed for planting the 1944 bomb meant
to kill Hitler.
   Hartmut von Hoesslin, brother of another German officer involved
in the 1944 plot, Maj. Roland von Hoesslin, was at the exhibit's
opening on Wednesday.
   Hartmut von Hoesslin said the display on imprisoned German
soldiers ``insulted all resistance-fighters.''
   A protest letter presented by Hartmut von Hoesslin to the
exhibit's organizers said propaganda by the imprisoned soldiers
amounted to ``psychoterror'' against fellow German troops.
   But Steinbach said members of the National Committee for a Free
Germany deserve a place in the exhibit and argued they saw
themselves not as opportunists who wanted to placate Soviet
captors, but as authentic opponents of Hitler's rule.
   ``They felt they were representatives of the Allied cause to
stop the war,'' Steinbach said.
   The dispute has its roots in a long-standing German dilemma:
what kind of honor to bestow on German soldiers who died during the
war, and whether those who deserted are also deserving of praise.
   German peace activists have been behind numerous moves to erect
monuments to World War II deserters, often angering people who feel
it is an affront to those who died fighting.
   There is heated controversy in Bockhorn, where citizens are
embroiled in discussion over the community's memorial to soldiers
who fell during both world wars.
   An open letter from peace activists questioned whether every
fallen soldier deserves to be treated like a hero.
   The letter said, ``They (the fallen soldiers) had participated
in one of the greatest crimes of modern times,'' meaning the
tragedies and terror begun by Nazi Germany when it started World
War II.
   Kark Friedrich Schinkel, an officer in the West German navy,
said in the respected newspaper Die Zeit that such disputes
underscore the difficulties some Germans still have in coming to
terms with their homeland's Nazi past.
   He said such controversies ``raise the question, 50 years after
the German invasion of Poland, whether the concept of individual
heroism can be applied against the backdrop of mass murder.''

LUCY DAWIDOWICZ; AUTHOR, HOLOCAUST HISTORIAN

<P>
Lucy S. Dawidowicz, a distinguished historian whose accounts of the Holocaust 
are considered among the definitive works of that atrocity, died Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
She was 75 when she died of unreported causes in New York City, where she held 
a chair in the interdisciplinary studies of the Holocaust at Yeshiva 
University. 
</P>
<P>
"A Holocaust Reader" and "The War Against the Jews" were eyewitness accounts of 
the Holocaust, gleaned from her early years and postwar travels to Europe, 
where she helped survivors of Nazi concentration camps rebuild schools and 
libraries. 
</P>
<P>
Those books and others, including the 1989 "From That Place and Time: A Memoir, 
1938-47," were based on interviews and research with survivors and her own 
recollections of Vilna, Poland, where she had lived in her youth. 
</P>
<P>
The daughter of Polish immigrants, she was born in New York in 1915. She moved 
to Poland while in her 20s and managed to escape Nazi invaders because she had 
an American passport. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the war she came back to Europe, she told Publisher's Weekly last 
year in connection with the publication of "From That Place and Time," hoping 
to establish a center for Yiddish culture. 
</P>
<P>
When she found that Jewish culture and life had been nearly extinguished by the 
death camps, she helped recover some of the Hebrew literature seized by the 
Germans and returned to the United States to write and study. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Dawidowicz, who attended Hunter College and Columbia University, was often 
at the center of disputes within the Jewish community over the nature of the 
Holocaust and the responsibility of American Jews for not doing more to prevent 
it. 
</P>
<P>
She was critical of historians who postulated that European Jews were too 
passive and cowardly in allowing the Holocaust to occur. 
</P>
<P>
She argued that it was unfair to judge in hindsight those who actually went 
through the experience. She also believed that European Jews were too isolated 
and too militarily and materially weak to overcome the Germans. 
</P>
<P>
Her central work, "The War Against the Jews," argues that destruction of her 
people was not a byproduct of Germany's World War II strategy but a central 
force in Hitler's plan to conquer Europe. 
</P>
<P>
She had met her husband, Szymon, while in Vilna. He escaped from Poland and 
died in 1979.

<HEAD>Hitler's Autobiography Banned At U.S.-Operated Bookstores</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. military officials have
ordered a bookstore chain catering to American soldiers to stop
selling Adolf Hitler's anti-Semitic book ``Mein Kampf,'' an official
said today.
   Hitler's book has been banned at the 158 Stars and Stripes
bookstores in Germany, said Deane McDermott, circulation manager for
the U.S. government organization in Darmstadt.
   ``Mein Kampf'' and other Nazi literature have been banned in
Germany for decades, McDermott said, but Stars and Stripes stores
had been selling about 70 copies a month of the book.
   ``It is against German law even to display the book,'' McDermott
said. ``We're guests in Germany and I think we should show certain
respect to our hosts.''
   McDermott said the subject of Nazism has become increasingly
sensitive in recent days following last week's 50th anniversary of
Kristallnacht and former German parliament speaker Philipp
Jenninger's controversial speech marking the occasion.
   Kristallnacht, meaning Crystal Night, was a night of terror when
Nazi sympathizers burned and looted Jewish businesses and synagogues
in what is considered the beginning of the Holocaust. Under the
Holocaust, 6 million Jews were systematically killed.
   Jenninger was forced to resign as president of the Bundestag, or
parliament, after an awkward and inflammatory explanation of
Hitler's appeal to the German people. Jenninger said many Germans
considered Hitler's march through Europe ``triumphal'' and he
bluntly referred to the widespread anti-Semitism among Germans that
allowed Hitler's repression of Jews.
   Vandalism at Jewish cemeteries by presumed neo-Nazi groups also
has been reported over the past few days in Wiesbaden, Bad Buchau
and Berlin.
   Sales of ``Mein Kampf,'' ``My Struggle'' in English, at Stars and
Stripes stores came to the attention of American military officials
in Berlin last week when a television program, ``Abendschau,''
showed one of its reporters purchasing the book at the store in
Berlin's Truman Plaza.
   The book is filled with anti-Semitic outpourings and describes a
struggle for world domination.
   Heinz Galinski, West Germany's Jewish community leader, was
interviewed during the TV program and expressed dismay that the U.S.
stores were selling Hitler's book.
   McDermott said patrons are supposed to show their military
identification cards when shopping at the stores. He said the German
TV crew had received special permission from Stars and Stripes to
enter the Berlin store.
   ``There has been an awful lot of publicity on the Kristallnacht
anniversary and Philipp Jenninger's speech, and I think this all
came about because of that,'' McDermott said.
   About half of Stars and Stripes' 199 bookstores in Europe had
been selling Hitler's publication since about 1983, McDermott said.
   The order to remove ``Mein Kampf'' from the stores came on Friday
from Gen. Raymond Haddock, the U.S. commander in Berlin.
   On Monday, about 600 copies of the book were removed from the
German-based stores.

   A hotel has offered to pay for moving
Adolf Hitler's yacht from the sensitive coral reef where it was
mistakenly sunk earlier this month, officials announced Wednesday.
   The yacht, the Ostwind, was supposed to become an artificial reef
in 250 feet of water. It was sunk June 4 as part of a commemoration
of the ``Voyage of the Damned,'' in which the Coast Guard in 1939
turned away a ship carrying more than 900 Jews fleeing Nazi
persecution.
   But instead, the 85-foot Ostwind wound up in 25 feet of water
about a mile away from the intended site, creating a hazard in a
shipping lane and threatening a live coral reef.
   City Commissioner Abe Resnick, who helped organize the Ostwind's
sinking, announced the owner and manager of the Fontainebleau Hilton
Hotel had offered to pay an estimated $10,000 to move the Ostwind.
   ``We certainly do not want this yacht to be part of an
environmental problem, especially because Hitler was the first great
threat to the world's environment in the 20th century,'' said
Resnick, a survivor of the Holocaust.
   The Army Corps of Engineers had threatened to move the yacht and
bill Resnick for the costs.
   Resnick said the Ostwind will be moved to the site originally
intended, not far from where the Coast Guard turned away the S.S.
St. Louis. The ship was forced to return to Europe, where more than
two-thirds of the passengers died in the Holocaust.
   The Ostwind was commissioned by Hitler and used by Nazi
officials, although Hitler apparently only used the vessel once or
twice. It eventually fell into disrepair after World War II and was
bought by a Jacksonville marina owner.

<HEAD>Expert: 70,000 May Have Died In Stalin-Era Internment Camps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAARBRUECKEN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to 70,000 prisoners may
have died in Soviet internment camps on German soil after World War
II, a government official who is an expert on Stalin-era atrocities
said Monday.
   The remark by Gerhard Finn followed reports of the discovery of
mass graves containing the bodies of thousands of prisoners from a
former Soviet internment camp in East Germany.
   East Germany's Berliner Zeitung newspaper reported Saturday that
some Nazi prisoners of war _ such as SS members, police officers,
Nazi party officials and former soldiers in Adolf Hitler's army _
died at the former Fuenfeichen internment camp near Neubrandenburg.
   But the newspaper said the victims also included ``many innocent
people'' and teen-agers. It said the youngest victim was 12 years
old.
   Finn, a department chief in the West German Inter-German
Ministry, said Monday he expected that even more mass graves will
be found.
   ``We estimate that from 65,000 to 70,000 people died in the
internment camps of the Soviet occupying powers'' after World War
II, Finn told Saarlandischer Rundfunk radio in Saarbruecken.
   Finn is the author of a book on the subject, titled ``Political
Prisoners in the Soviet Zone.''
   He said it would be impossible to give an exact figure because
all death certificates of the camps were destroyed.
   Finn said that between 1945 and 1950, up to 200,000 people were
detained in 13 Soviet army camps in East Germany.
   Brutality during the Soviet occupation was kept secret in East
Germany until last fall's popular uprising swept the hard-line
Communist leadership out of power.

<TEXT>
   Jewish leaders said Wednesday a German
unification treaty must contain a clear statement of responsibility
for the victims of Nazi tyranny.
   In recent years, Jews have warned that younger Germans may begin
to shirk the legacy of Nazi Germany, where 6 million Jews were
murdered.
   As the two German nations come closer together, Jewish leaders
want the past clearly spelled out in the preamble to the treaty
linking both states.
   ``We are insisting that becomes part of the unification
treaty,'' said Heinz Galinksi, chairman of the Central Council of
Jews in Germany. ``That is our demand.''
   Galinski, in a statement distributed by his West Berlin office,
recalled that he had given a draft paragraph to West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl on July 18.
   In the draft, the 77-year-old survivor of the Auschwitz
concentration camp specified German responsibility for the Nazi era.
   Galinski told The Associated Press he was ``very disappointed''
when West German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble responded by
suggesting that the treaty contain general wording about democracy,
peace and human rights.
   There was no specific reference to the 12-years of Nazi rule,
Galinski said. The Nazis came to power in 1933.
   Schaeuble is leading the West German team negotiating the treaty
with officials from East Berlin.
   Jewish leaders insist the passage should specify the
``singularity'' of the Nazi era and acknowledge Germans'
``responsibility to all the victims'' of Hitler's tyranny.
   In addition to the Jews who died, the Nazis killed hundreds of
thousands of gypsies, homosexuals and others deemed undesirable by
the regime.
   The treaty is considered of enormous importance to the
approximately 36,000 Jews in West Germany and the almost 400
practicing Jews in East Germany.
   With the date of unity racing closer, possible East German
reparations to Holocaust victims have been the subject of separate
talks with Jewish leaders. For four decades, East Germany's
Communists refused to pay compensation to Jews, saying that as an
anti-fascist state they were not liable for Hitler's crimes.
   After the fall of the communists last year, the democratically
elected government in East Berlin offered to pay compensation.
   But Frankfurt Jewish community spokesman Michel Friedman said he
was pessimistic on the subject of reparations and said he fears the
matter may be left unresolved until after formal unification.

FINALLY, A THAW AT THE 'WHITE LAKE';

BERLIN: THE WALL'S OPENING IS AS LARGE AND AS SMALL A MATTER AS BEING ABLE TO 
VISIT A GRANDFATHER'S GRAVE.

<P>
I never knew my grandfather. He died in 1922, when my mother was 15 years old. 
</P>
<P>
But the past week's events in Germany have given me, from as far away as New 
York, a new sense of freedom. For the first time since I left Germany with my 
parents in 1936, a refugee from the Third Reich, I can visit my grandfather's 
grave without a hassle, without the long wait at the East Berlin border, 
without the indignity of intense questioning as to why I wanted to spend a few 
hours in East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
It is ironic that the postwar partition left Weissensee, the landmark Jewish 
cemetery, in East Berlin, which today has a Jewish community of only 200 or so. 
In West Berlin, the Jewish community is a thriving 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the wall was put up, it was difficult for Westerners to get into 
the east zone to visit Weissensee, althought for some years now, rabbis and 
cantors from the West have been allowed to travel with mourners through 
Checkpoint Charlie and on to the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
From 1880 until the Nazi persecution, Weissensee was the final resting place of 
Jews from all of Berlin. My grandfather, Sally Bacharach, lies in grave 62456, 
field B IV, row 15. Like so many of those resting nearby, he was, in a sense, 
fortunate. He didn't have to suffer under Hitler. He knew nothing of the Great 
Depression, the Cold War, nuclear war. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Weissensee -- "White Lake" -- is a serene place, a monument to nearly a 
century of German Jewry's history. I have been back to Berlin half a dozen 
times. I have never failed to visit the cemetery, to clean the ivy growth off 
the gravestone whose lettering has been greatly but not entirely eroded by 
nearly 70 years of summers and winters, storms and winds and political change. 
</P>
<P>
My great-grandparents, Heymann and Emelie Nathan, are also buried there, but 
the exact location of their graves has eluded me. They are in a section of 
Weissensee damaged during the intensive bombing of Berlin by American planes 
near the war's end. It is now covered by underbrush. 
</P>
<P>
A visit to Weissensee, about a 10-minute car ride into East Berlin, is a sad 
lesson in the history of modern German Jewry. Here lie many who died when 
royalty ruled. Others are in a field of honor that contains graves of the 
Jewish soldiers who gave their lives for Germany in World War I. (My father, 
Arthur Dzialoszynski, was wounded in combat and awarded the Iron Cross. His 
brother, Salo, did not survive his wounds; he died on his 28th birthday, while 
en route home for medical treatment.) Twenty years later, the relatives of the 
honored dead were being rounded up, to end their lives in places like Dachau 
and Auschwitz. As late as 1936, four years into the Hitler regime, 
German-Jewish veterans still commemorated their military service with 
ceremonies at Weissensee. 
</P>
<P>
Now the veterans, too, are only a memory, but evidence of the evil days 
abounds. Sigmund Deutsch and his wife Martha, for example, are buried together. 
They died on the same day, Oct. 22, 1942. They had committed suicide, unable to 
carry on. They are only two of the 811 Jews who took their own lives that year 
as an alternative to being hauled off to concentration camps. There is the 
single monument in memory of Mendel Wachsmann, born May 21, 1886, murdered Feb. 
4, 1941, at Sachenhausen; Georg Wachsmann, born April 27, 1918, killed May 27, 
1942, and Leo Wachsmann, born Feb. 11, 1923, died in Auschwitz sometime in 
1943. A father and his two sons, the whereabouts of their real graves unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Here, too, lie those who died when the century was new and full of promise. 
Their remains are marked by simple headstones and ostentatious mausoleums. 
There is one row of Berlin's rabbis. Another contains the most prominent Jewish 
physicians, among them Abraham Adolf Baer, Adolf Baginsky, Albert Fraenkel. 
Theodore Wolff, the editor of the Berliner Tagesblatt, and jurist Eugen Fuchs 
are buried here. 
</P>
<P>
As events unfold now, one thing is clear: Weissensee cemetery belongs to all of 
Berlin once again. And my grandfather is a bit closer. 
</P>
<P>
The wall is gone.

<HEAD>Experts on Nazi Era Dispute Bush's Claim that Saddam Worse Than
Hitler</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: SUBS grafs 3 and 19 to CORRECT spelling of `Wiesenthal.'</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush says a look at history will
back up his suggestion that Saddam Hussein is a barbarian
surpassing Adolf Hitler, but experts on the Nazi era disagree with
him.
   ``We don't see the kind of atrocities being committed in Kuwait
and Iraq that would match those of Nazi Germany,'' said Richard
Breitman, a professor of history at American University and a
specialist in the Hitler era.
   ``No one yet, and I hope no one ever will, match up to the
systematized brutalities and racist policies that Adolf Hitler
committed,'' said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate director of the
Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles.
   The center is devoted to the study of the Nazi Holocaust, in
which an estimated 6 million Jews were killed, and its contemporary
implications.
   Bush, speaking at a Republican rally in Mashpee, Mass.,
Thursday, said Saddam's Iraqi invaders ``have committed outrageous
acts of barbarism. Brutality - I don't believe that Adolf Hitler
ever participated in anything of that nature.''
   Later, at a news conference in Orlando, Fla., Bush said, ``I
don't think I am overstating it. I know I am not overstating the
feelings I have about it. ... I think the American people are as
outraged as I am about the treatment of the people in our embassy,
for example, and I think it is important that they know my concerns
on this subject.''
   ``I was told that Hitler did not stake people out against
military targets,'' the president said. ``He did respect the
legitimacy of the embassies, so there are some differences.''
   He added, ``I see many similarities between the Iraqi behavior
in Kuwait and the way the Death's Head regiments behaved in Poland.
Go back and take a look at the history and you can see why I'm as
concerned as I am.'' ''
   The Death's Head units were notorious blackshirted SS troops
that began as Hitler's personal bodyguard. They were blamed for
many atrocities during the German invasion of Poland.
   Breitman said many of the specific points Bush made were correct
and could make Saddam appear worse than Hitler in some respects,
``but I don't think the overall record would show that to be the
case.''
   He said that at the outbreak of World War II the Nazis interned
foreign diplomats in conditions ``that were not comfortable, but
were nothing like what we are seeing in Kuwait and Iraq.''
   These diplomats were eventually exchanged for German diplomats
in Allied custody, Breitman said.
   He said he was not aware that the Nazis ever took hostages to
potential military targets to use them as human shields as Saddam
has done.
   Cooper, however, said Bush was ``absolutely wrong'' on the
point.
   ``Look at the millions of people of all nationalities who were
forced into slave labor factories in Germany and many of them got
blown away by the Allied bombing missions,'' he said.
   Breitman said Hitler is not known to have visited any of the
Nazi death camps, but ``that does not mean he was not involved.''
   He also said the activities of the Death's Head units were
``only the tip of the iceberg in terms of brutality in Poland'' by
the German invaders.
   The historian said he was not defending Saddam. He said the
Iraqi leader has committed crimes ``that give the idea of a
Nuremberg-type trial a certain legitimacy to raise.''
Administration sources have said that such a trial, along the lines
of the war crimes trials held in Nuremberg, Germany, after World
War II, is a possibility.
   At the Wiesenthal Center, Rabbi Cooper said, ``Saddam Hussein
has a list of crimes that I don't think has to be compared with
anybody in order for the people of America to understand how
serious a threat he represents.''
   ``But let's also keep this thing in some sort of perspective,''
he said. ``And to say that he outstrips Adolf Hitler, I just think
it's either a slip of the tongue or a speech writer got carried
away.''
   Other Jewish leaders generally agreed.
   David Harris, executive vice president of the American Jewish
Committee, said, ``Both men, each in his own way, represents an
incarnation of evil. But to try and suggest that Saddam Hussein is
a man of even greater evil than Adolf Hitler to me doesn't add to
the discussion.''
   Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League
of B'nai B'rith, called Bush's remark ``an unfortunate exaggeration
that could hurt the president's credibility at a time when it is
very important that he remain credible.''
   ``Saddam Hussein is writing his own chapter of barbarism,''
Foxman said. ``It's the Saddam Hussein chapter and one need not
compare or exaggerate.''

<HEAD>Prussian Nostalia in Journalist's Best Seller</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 45 years after Russian tanks
rolled through East Prussia, one of West Germany's leading
journalists has produced a haunting memoir of an aristocratic and
tradition-bound world shattered by war.
   At the heart of Countess Marion Doenhoff's best seller,
``Childhood in East Prussia,'' is the chronicle of a proud East
Prussian family, which prospered there from the Middle Ages until
1945. It also details the family's loss to the German war machine
and the price it paid for resistance to Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.
   Doenhoff, who will be 79 on Dec. 2, is co-publisher of the
respected weekly newspaper Die Zeit. She shares the position with
former West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
   One of West Germany's most respected journalists and political
commentators, she has been a firm advocate of improved relations
with eastern Europe and has worked for reconciliation with the
victims of Nazi aggression.
   Doenhoff's book comes 26 years after she detailed the family's
dramatic flight from the advancing Soviet army in a best-selling
book titled ``Forgotten Names.''
   East Prussia, once the home of vast and imposing noble estates
and the German military aristocracy, was divided into parcels after
World War II and ceded to Poland and the Soviet Union. It bordered
the Baltic on the north and Poland and Lithuania in the south and
east.
   ``Childhood in East Prussia'' is filled with memories of the
region's rustic landscape and the stern, but unostentatious habits
of Doenhoff's family, one of the region's oldest and a member of the
Kaiser's court in Berlin.
   She also describes distinguished visitors to the Doenhoff
family's Friedrichstein estate, located in the sprawling timber-rich
region near the city of Koenigsberg, now Kaliningrad in the Soviet
Union.
   Referring to a visit in 1916 by Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg
to the family estate when she was a little girl, Doenhoff recalls
that she was disappointed by the legendary officer's appearance:
``He was tall and heavy and walked with a stiff gait. ... he did not
look like the godly hero I had imagined him to be.''
   As a teen-ager, she recalls exploring the family mansion's attic,
where she discovered the dusty records and long-forgotten
memorabilia of generations of Doenhoffs _ discoveries she says gave
her a sense of ``how far back my direct and formative past
stretches.''
   She also recounts the tragic fate of many of her relatives and
friends and her own brushes with death.
   Writing of preparations by East Prussian aristocrats who joined
together to plot the ill-fated July 20, 1944, assassination attempt
against Hitler, Doenhoff says: ``We were among one of the circles of
those sworn against Hitler. I was involved in some (local)
preparations, (my cousin) Heini Lehndorff with actions to carry it
out.''
   Lehndorff, who was to help assuming command of the Nazi garrison
in Koenigsberg, was later executed in Berlin along with hundreds of
other plotters and their sympathizers. A prominent local official
whom she had won over to the side of the conspirators was also
killed.
   ``I anguished for a long time over why he had been killed and I
was only questioned by the Gestapo,'' Doenhoff writes.
   Later, she learned that the man's name was on a captured list of
those who were to take over local positions of power after Hitler's
assassination.
   Doenhoff writes that Hitler's war also took a terrible toll on
the sons of East Prussia's aristocracy, many of whom fell in the
Soviet Union.
   Thousands of civilians were also killed as Russian troops
advanced.
   The Doenhoff estate, built in the 18th century, was burned to the
ground in 1945 by Russian soldiers, Doenhoff says. Three of her
nephews were killed in battle in Russia, as was a brother.
   The coming war and the region's ultimate destruction and loss,
was often the subject of grim humor among the family, as they
renovated buildings and modernized the estate's agricultural
production.
   ``We used to say, `The Russians will be pleased with the
improvements,''' Doenhoff writes. ``Long before 1939 we sensed that
this insane war would come and the Russians would be the inheritors
of our labors.''
   Extensive restoration efforts on the estate were completed just
before it was destroyed.
   It took decades for Doenhoff to finally accept that her homeland
was lost forever. ``For years I hoped that a miracle would happen,
although my political studies had proved that there could be no
miracles in this area.''
   The realities of post-war politics and the importance of
improving relations with eastern Europe forced her to accept its
irrevocable loss.
   ``If we wanted normalization, we needed clarity over the final
borders,'' Doenhoff said.
   The parcels ceded to the Soviet Union and Poland after the war
were made permanent in treaties ratified between 1970 and 1972 as
part of efforts by the West German government to pursue an active
rapproachment, or ``Ostpolitik,'' with the Soviet bloc.
   Despite recognition of the political necessities regarding East
Prussia, Doenhoff says the emotional legacy remains.
   ``Even today, after living happily in Hamburg for decades, I
answer `East Prussia' instinctively and without thinking when asked
where my home is. I miss the landscape ... of this lost land.''

<P>
On a warm spring morning Tuesday, 45 years to the day after the collapse of 
Nazism, the Holocaust came full circle. 
</P>
<P>
It happened outside the three-story stuccoed villa in the picturesque Berlin 
suburb of Wannsee where on Jan. 20, 1942, a handful of Nazi government 
officials gathered for just a few hours and clinically planned the 
extermination of European Jewry. 
</P>
<P>
After a protracted, controversial debate in the Judaic world, a small group of 
Jewish leaders gathered on the villa's grounds Tuesday with the stated aim of 
keeping the memory of what happened there alive so that it might never happen 
again. 
</P>
<P>
A declaration written by Nobel Peace laureate and Holocaust survivor Elie 
Wiesel said in part: 
</P>
<P>
" . . . when we Jews visit and listen to the somber and dark echoes at Wannsee, 
we aim at preventing future generations from inheriting our past as their 
future." 
</P>
<P>
Wiesel was absent because of an earlier commitment, but his brief statement was 
read in Hebrew, English and German. The ceremony was attended by several dozen 
Jews and a small group of German dignitaries. Many could not hold back their 
tears, unable to heed Wiesel's injunction: "Cry? One must not cry here! If you 
begin, you will not stop. How many tears does one shed for thousands of 
communities?" 
</P>
<P>
The commemoration came on the final day of the first formal gathering of world 
Jewish leaders in Germany since the rise of Nazism nearly 60 years ago. The 
gathering is part of a highly visible attempt by Jewish leaders to establish a 
new relationship with Germany as the process of reunification begins. 
</P>
<P>
World Jewish Congress officials have praised the success of West Germany's 
democracy, but there is apprehension as unity proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart says stay away, but my mind says there is a new Germany here," said 
World Jewish Congress Vice President Isi Leibler, explaining in an interview 
after the ceremony why he decided to attend. "With hope for the future, we must 
ensure that this new Germany will make a commitment that their children and the 
children of those children will understand (the Holocaust). Only then can we 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
Leibler referred to the powerful differences among Jews about the visit but 
said it was a matter of personal conscience. He said those who first supported 
the decision for the Wannsee ceremony were mainly concentration camp survivors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a good feeling to be here," said Samuel Pastarnak, 67, an Auschwitz 
survivor who now lives in Nuremberg. "But it is something that must be done." 
</P>
<P>
The Wannsee ceremony occurred exactly 45 years after Adolf Hitler's Third Reich 
surrendered unconditionally to the United States and its allies, ending World 
War II in Europe. The day was commemorated in several German cities. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, Jewish leaders meeting here have repeated a single plea to German 
leaders and opinion makers: Don't let the memory of the Holocaust die, don't 
let it be falsified. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's trip to Wannsee was in that spirit, conference organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't pray here, for I personally believe God has turned his face away from 
this place, as he did at Auschwitz," World Jewish Congress President Edgar M. 
Bronfman told the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
For many, the horror of that meeting captured the horror of the Holocaust 
itself -- that ordinary men, when told of the plan, never questioned it but 
instead planned the extermination of an entire race with a bureaucratic 
precision that made it seem simply one more routine task. 
</P>
<P>
The exact number of those who attended the Jan. 20, 1942, meeting that sealed 
the fate of about 6 million Jews is unclear. Some accounts talk of 12, others 
13 and still others 15. 
</P>
<P>
One of Hitler's top lieutenants, Reinhard Heydrich, presided, while a 
middle-ranking SS officer named Adolf Eichmann took the minutes. The rest were 
anonymous government and security functionaries. 
</P>
<P>
The villa, then a little-used retreat for senior SS (elite force) officers, 
lies in a particularly leafy and tranquil district of what is now southwestern 
West Berlin, taking its name from a nearby lake that serves as a playground for 
the city's residents. It was selected because of the sensitivity of the subject 
to be discussed. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ekkehard Klausa, who administers memorial sites for the West 
Berlin government, historical accounts show that both Eichmann and Heydrich 
were extremely apprehensive that some of the meeting's participants might 
protest what became known as the "Final Solution." 
</P>
<P>
They did not, and Eichmann and Heydrich celebrated that lack of dissent 
afterward with cigars and brandy. 
</P>
<P>
While the decision to murder the Jews had been taken earlier by Hitler, those 
at the Wannsee meeting carefully defined who was a Jew, where the Jewish 
populations were located and how they would be transported from their homes to 
the death camps. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, in the chamber rooms of this villa, regulations were determined that 
then went through the inevitable and proper bureaucratic procedure across 
hundreds of tidy desks to take the form of the cattle cars eastward, of 
barracks behind barbed wire and finally the gas chambers and crematoria," the 
head of the German Jewish Council, Heinz Galinski, told the Tuesday gathering. 
"The horror that we connect with the names Auschwitz, Treblinka . . . they have 
their origins here in Wannsee." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's ceremony concluded with the Israeli anthem. 
</P>
<P>
The villa, which was a youth hostel for much of the postwar period, is being 
turned into a museum and seminar center on the Holocaust and Nazi period. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the East German Parliament marked the day with a moment of silence 
and, for the second time in less than a month, admitted that East Germans share 
responsibility for the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
"No one should forget guilt and no one should deny responsibility," 
parliamentary Speaker Sabine Bergman-Pohl said in a ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere asked Jews for forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"We extend our hand in reconciliation and to work together for a common 
future," he later said in a luncheon address to a joint meeting of the World 
Jewish Congress and the European Jewish Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"A Germany without Jews never existed and it cannot exist without Jews. . . . A 
German unification cannot be a revival of 1933. We request you to have 
confidence in us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere also promised to fight a revival of anti-Semitic feeling among 
German youth. 
</P>
<P>
"It fills us with concern. No people can get rid of the dark side of its past," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Communists, who ruled East Germany for 40 years until last fall's 
revolutions swept through the region, had always denied that their country had 
any responsibility for the Holocaust, claiming instead that, because Hitler 
also persecuted Communists, East Germany shared a common legacy with the 
victims of Nazism.

<TEXT>
   The World Jewish Congress will hold its first
conference in Germany next week, ending with a ceremony at Wannsee,
the villa where Nazis planned the extermination of European Jews
half a century ago.
   Mass killing of Jews had begun when Reinhard Heydrich and his
companions convened in January 1942, at the elegant villa on a lake
in southwestern Berlin, to work out details of the Final Solution.
   On May 8, World Jewish Congress delegates from around the world
will gather at Wannsee to join their sorrow for the 6 million
Jewish victims to present-day concerns.
   Michel Friedman, a Jewish leader in Frankfurt, spoke of
increased anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union and what he considers
related, worrisome signs in East Germany and Poland.
   ``We see in Eastern Europe that these tendencies recently have
become much more pronounced than would have been thinkable a few
years ago,'' said Friedman, who will attend the WJC conference.
   ``If the past is suppressed, then there is an even greater
danger that things will happen in the present that also must be
condemned.''
   The World Jewish Congress, founded in 1936 in response to
Hitler's threats against Jews, will begin its meeting May 6 in the
West Berlin Jewish community building. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of
West Germany is to attend the opening.
   ``One of the intentions of this meeting is to give, from a moral
perspective, a Jewish point of view on the emerging process of
German unification,'' about which Jews have a ``special concern,''
said Elan Steinberg, the WJC executive director. About 500 people
are expected to attend.
   The ceremony at Wannsee will take place on the 45th anniversary
of Nazi Germany's unconditional surrender in World War II.
   West Berlin's government is renovating the villa and plans to
open it as a Holocaust memorial Jan. 20, 1992, the 50th anniversary
of the Nazi conference.
   Heydrich, a ranking officer of the Nazi SS, laid out his plans
to about 15 representatives of police agencies and Nazi government
ministries. He said 11 million Jews were to be wiped out.
   Raul Hilberg wrote in his book ``The Annihilation of European
Jews'' that the ``mood was upbeat due to the freely flowing
cognac'' at the two-hour meeting.
   Even before the Wannsee Conference, the Nazis had been
slaughtering Jews in Poland and the Soviet Union, and deportations
had begun.
   Adolf Eichmann, who was to oversee the deportation and murder of
millions of Jews, kept the official record of the Wannsee
proceedings. He was hanged in Israel in 1962 for crimes against the
Jews.
   Hitler did not attend the conference and there has been some
debate of whether he gave direct orders for such a systematic
slaughter.
   As early as January 1939, however, he called publicly for the
``annihilation of the Jewish race throughout Europe.'' Hitler
repeated the call 10 days after the Wannsee Conference.
   ``He knew about it and wanted it,'' said Dieter Senoner, a
spokesman for the Wannsee Villa memorial project. ``There's not the
slightest doubt about that.''
   The Wannsee Villa is between the Alsen Berlin sailing club and
the Sans Souci restaurant in one of Berlin's most popular excursion
spots.
   Many Germans stop outside 56-58 Am Grossen Wannsee and stare at
the sprawling beige villa, which fell into disrepair over decades
and now is being renovated.
   On a warm April day, a young mother stopped with her 10-year-old
daughter and pointed down the driveway to the villa and its
portico, supported by graceful ionic columns.
   ``That's where the National Socialists plotted the killings of
the Jews,'' she told the child somberly.
   Above them was a plaque reading: ``In this house in January
1942, the infamous Wannsee Conference took place. To the memory of
the fellow human beings slain by the Nazi tyranny.''

   Police in Adolf Hitler's hometown today
arrested at least eight people on the dictator's 100th birthday and
turned back several others at the West German border in an effort
to head off neo-Nazi violence.
   Hundreds of police roamed the area, helicopters circled overhead
and police vehicles were spotted as far as 10 miles from this town.
   The security measures were aimed at preventing a repeat of
clashes between neo-Nazis and left-wing opponents on Hitler's 90th
birthday.
   By midmorning, a constant stream of dozens of curious onlookers
clustered near Hitler's birthplace, which was sealed off by metal
barriers.
   Dozens of police cars blocked the street leading to the house
that is now a nursery for handicapped children. Many stores closed
and at least two shops boarded their front windows.
   A police spokesman said two Austrians, three Italians, two
Germans and one American were detained and face fines of up to
$2,300 dollars.
   The Italians, one of the Austrians and the American were seen
raising their hands for the Nazi salute, said a police official who
did not give his name. Earlier, officials erroneously had reported
that all five were Italian.
   One West German was picked up by gendarmerie after he shouted
Nazi slogans and spat at reporters. He was in possession of a large
knife, the police official said.
   Another West German also shouted anti-Semitic and Nazi slogans _
``Jew, go and rot'' and ``This will be a national holiday in 100
years' time'' _ as he was dragged away.
   Police declined to identify those detained. Schindler indicated
they would face misdemeanor charges and not more serious criminal
charges under an Austrian law that bans neo-Nazi activity.
   On Wednesday, four unidentified Americans, an Irishman and a
West German were ordered by police to change their clothes after
arriving in Braunau in black boots and brown shirts reminiscent of
the Nazi uniform, police said.
   Police said ``several people'' were turned back at the nearby
West German border. A spokesman declined to give details.
   In West Germany, scores of foreigners closed their shops and
many others kept their children out of schools in Hamburg today
because of fears of violence, officials said.
   In West Berlin, police arrested nine members of self-styled
``protection troops'' that had been cruising the streets to prevent
neo-Nazi attacks on foreigners and Jewish landmarks.
   West Berlin police also said that a Turkish cemetery was
vandalized early today. More than 38 gravemarkers were overturned
or damaged, officials said.
   The anniversary got little mention in West German newspapers,
but a senior official warned of possible violence by neo-Nazi
groups against foreigners.
   Peter Frisch, vice-president of the Federal Office for the
Protection of the Constitution in Frankfurt, said there are about
30,000 rightist extremists in West Germany, including about 1,500
neo-Nazis.
   Turks in recent years have flocked to West Germany in search of
jobs, triggering resentment among many working-class Germans.
Rightist groups have made foreign workers a political issue, and
the extremist Republican Party, campaigning on a platform opposed
to foreign workers, recently made surprising gains in some West
German municipal elections.
   ``They (the Turks) have assumed the role that the Jews played in
the Nazi ideology,'' Frisch said on the North German radio station.
   Hitler was born in the two-story house on April 20, 1889 and
spent the first three years of his life in Braunau, just miles from
the West German border. He committed suicide in a bunker in Berlin
on April 30, 1945, having ordered his body burned.
   In 1979, neo-Nazis and left-wingers clashed in the village
before police broke up the rival groups. No serious injuries were
reported then.
   Police said three anonymous letters were received threatening
violence this year on the ``Hitler House,'' Socialist Mayor Gerhard
Skiba and an anti-fascist memorial opposite the house.
   Skiba said the memorial, erected April 5, was intended to show
that Braunau's 10,000 residents oppose Nazism and remember its
millions of victims. It was made of granite from the quarry once
worked by thousands of prisoners at the former Nazi concentration
camp, Mauthausen.

   In a junior high classroom in a state with
fewer than 3,000 Jews, sociologist Charles Hildebrandt holds up a
photograph of Adolf Hitler and speaks about the need to be a
``witness'' to the Holocaust.
   ``What were Aryans?'' Hildebrandt asked his Keene Junior High
School students Wednesday. Hildebrandt directs the Keene State
College Holocaust Resource Center, a library of more than 1,400
books, thousands of articles, films, slides and videotapes that
opened in 1983.
   The five ``gifted and talented'' children whose parents
permitted them to attend the optional, after-school course screwed
up their faces, indicating they didn't know about Aryans.
   ``They were supposed to be the super-race with blonde hair, blue
eyes, tall and strong,'' said Hildebrandt. ``The supermen that
would conquer the world, the super-race that would destroy all
these inferior races like the Jews.''
   The children, who like Hildebrandt are Christian, nodded
solemnly.
   This week, as groups across the country hold Holocaust memorials
to mark the 45th anniversary of the Warsaw ghetto uprisings,
Hildebrandt is doing his part to ensure that the 6 million Jews who
died in Nazi death camps are not forgotten and that similar
atrocities never happen again.
   Education is ``what it's all about,'' he said. His lesson is not
lost on some of his students.
   ``It's not going to happen again because we listen and because
they're teaching us about it. If no one had said anything, then it
could easily happen again,'' said 11-year-old Erin Buzuvis.
   Hildebrandt was asked why New Hampshire needed the Holocaust
center, since its Jewish population is estimated by the Jewish
Federation of Greater Manchesterat at fewer than 3,000, or less
than one-third of one percent of the population.
   ``Why not?'' he replied. ``There should be a center everywhere.''
   As the state's handful of concentration camp survivors and
liberators die, it's even more important to convey the facts, he
said. Hildebrandt says many textbook writers are minimizing the
Holocaust; some even question the facts.
   ``There has to be a witness,'' he said.
   Hildebrandt does not dwell on the horror, but believes that
explaining the true events gradually is important. But how does a
teacher gradually describe genocide? How can gas chambers and
starvation be introduced without trauma?
   Hildebrandt advises elementary school teachers simply to begin
with classes on prejudice and less gruesome topics. For more
advanced children, he recommends two books:
   One is about a little girl, Rose Blanche, who sneaks food
through the barbed wire fence at a death camp. Her name, which
means white rose, is also the name of a German youth group that
resisted Hitler and eventually was eliminated.
   Another is about a little girl discovering concentration camp
numbers tatooed on her grandfather's arm and his explaining how
they got there. The book, illustrated by photographs of a girl and
an Auschwitz survivor, ends with the granddaughter saying, ``You
shouldn't be ashamed to let people see your number. You didn't do
anything wrong. It's the Nazis who should be ashamed.''
   By junior high and high school, Hildebrandt says, students
generally are better able to hear a more complete truth.
   Still, a couple of the children displayed some prejudices that
seem to indicate why Holocaust education is important _ especially
in areas with few minorities.
   ``It couldn't happen again because ... Jews aren't so Jewish
anymore,'' said one.
   ``They're more civilized,'' said another. ``They know more. They
act more like regular people.''

a first grab for national power with the abortive ``beerhall
putsch'' in Munich.
   Jan. 30, 1933 _ Hitler is appointed Reich chancellor amid
political chaos and mass unemployment of the Great Depression. The
Nazis, using slogans mixing populism, assertion of Germany's
identity and anti-Semitism, had become the biggest party in the

dictatorial powers within months.
   Sept 1, 1939 _ Hitler's army invades Poland, setting off World
War II.
   May 8, 1945 _ The Third Reich accepts unconditional surrender
after the Allied victory in a war that devastated much of Europe
and killed 55 million people. France, Britain, the United States
and Soviet Union divide Germany and its capital, Berlin, into
occupation zones.
   June 5, 1945 _ The U.S.-Soviet-British Potsdam Agreement awards
eastern German areas mostly to Poland.

<HEAD>British Spy Told Stalin of Nazi Attempt to Make Peace with Britain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kim Philby, the famed Soviet mole in British
intelligence, told Soviet authorities about Rudolf Hess's secret
mission to Britain to arrange a separate peace three days after it
happened, Tass reported.
   The May 1941 mission came a month before Nazi Germany attacked
the Soviet Union, and prosecutors at the Nuremberg war crimes trial
said the Germans, through Hess, were seeking peace with Britain so
they could concentrate their efforts against the Soviets.
   ``It would have been possible to save hundreds of thousands, or
even millions, of human lives, if Stalin had trusted Soviet
intelligence officers' reports about Nazi Germany's preparations
for an attack on the Soviet Union,'' Tass, the official Soviet news
agency, said Wednesday.
   Tass counted Philby among the Soviet agents. The British
intelligence officer spied for the Soviets for 30 years.
   Soviet secret archives on the flight of Hess, Adolf Hitler's
deputy, will be declassified in the next few days, the news agency
said. It will include materials sent by Philby, Tass said.
   Hess flew to England in a Messerschmitt fighter plane on May 10,
1941 to try to arrange a peace treaty. He said he did so without
Adolf Hitler's knowledge, but that was never proved.
   Hess was jailed after his flight. After the war, he was
convicted of war crimes and imprisoned until his death in 1987 in
Berlin.
   Tass claimed Philby helped thwart Nazi attempts to conclude a
separate peace with the Western allies.
   Philby also gave Stalin the allies' strategy going into the
Potsdam conference in July 1945, where the victors worked out
details of the post-war arrangements for Europe, Tass said.
   It said Philby's reports were responsible for Stalin's cunning
smile at the conference, which was noted by a number of journalists
who covered it.
   Tass said British Prime Minister Winston Churchill wrote in his
memoirs that he was shaken by the depth of Stalin's perception into
British policy in North Africa during the war.
   ``However, this `perception' was based on precise information
received from (British intelligence), where Philby was making a
sky-rocketing career,'' Tass said.
   Philby also used his position in British intelligence to warn
Stalin of Nazi plans for an offensive near Kursk in the summer of
1943, Tass said. The warning allowed the Soviets to build up troops
in the area before the great battle.
   Philby had access to intercepted German radio messages and
passed them on to the Soviets, allowing Soviet authorities to catch
German intelligence agents smuggled into the Soviet Union, Tass
said.
   A film about Philby, one of several Cambridge University
graduates who became Soviet spies in the 1930s, is scheduled to be
shown on Soviet television Friday. Tass promised it will contain
``many historical sensations'' on the spy, who fled to Moscow in
1963 ahead of British investigators. He died there in 1988.
   The television film, ``Cambridge Graduate,'' also will show
Philby's liaison officer, a Moscow woman named Zoya Voskresenskaya,
Tass said.

<TEXT>
   Greater historical and emotional distance to the Holocaust also
has sparked a re-evaluation of other artists and thinkers
associated with the Nazis.
   One example is German composer and conductor Richard Strauss
(1864-1949), who had been boycotted in Israel because he served as
head of musical affairs under the Nazis in 1933 and 1934.
   Two recent recitals included Strauss lieder and passed without
protest. On March 18, the Symphony Orchestra of Rishon Lezion, a
Tel Aviv suburb, played for the first time a major Strauss work,
the ``Metamorphosen'' for string instruments.
   It was received by the audience with shouts of ``bravo.''
   ``We cannot escape Richard Strauss. It is a must for the Israeli
music lover to hear this work,'' said Noam Sheriff, the orchestra's
musical director.
   Sheriff recently asked his musicians to play Wagner in
rehearsal, arguing that they would not become polished musicians
without mastering Wagner. The musicians, most in their 20s and 30s,
practiced ``Die Meistersinger'' without protest, he said.
   Another example is German philospher Martin Heidegger, a fervent
Hitler follower who denounced colleagues at Freiburg University to
the Gestapo, the Nazi secret police.
   The works of Heidegger, whose ideas influenced existentialists
such as Jean Paul Sartre, have been taught at the Hebrew University
of Jerusalem since 1982.
   Lecturer Gabriel Motzkin said that he included Heidegger in his
course on German philosphers because his work is too important to
ignore, but that he made students aware of Heidegger's political
beliefs.
   The dilemma faced by Israeli music lovers or philosphy students
is not present in the world of publishing.
   ``Totalitarianism by nature does not produce good books that are
worth translating,'' said Beth Elon, editorial director of the
Domino publishing house in Jerusalem.
   She said her company refused to publish a Hebrew version of
Hitler's manifesto, ``Mein Kampf'' (My Struggle), but said the
considerations were purely commercial.
   ``It was a dull, unwieldy book, real heavy going. Even the shock
value wasn't shocking,'' Ms. Elon said.
   These developments suggest that while certain barriers have
fallen, the trauma of the Holocaust remains a central part of
Israeli life.
   The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, for example, never set foot
in Israel because its conductor, Herbert von Karajan, had been a
member of the Nazi Party. Only Karajan's death last year paved the
way for a tour of Israel by the orchestra, scheduled for this month.
   This ambivalence also finds expression in other fields.
   On the one hand, German-made cars and electrical appliances are
proudly displayed as status symbols, and elderly German-born Jews
are no longer reluctant to speak their mother tongue in public.
   On the other hand, Israeli leaders are cautious in approaching
the question of establishing ties with East Germany, which refused
for years to accept any official responsibility for the Holocaust.
   This ambivalence still shows up on the concert stage. In Israel,
playing Wagner is not the same as playing other composers.
   But Gottfried Wagner expressed optimisim. ``The debate sparked
by my visit gives reason to hope that Wagner one day will emerge
from under Hitler's shadow,'' he said.

   A middle-aged woman spit and cursed at
a drawing of officers who served Germany's Third Reich. A European
man threw a beer mug to the floor, apparently enraged by the
decorations of Bangkok's ``Nazi Bar.''
   Trendy Thais are frequenting the new nightspot, but foreigners
have objected to the caricatures of Adolf Hitler, cartoons of
Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini, photos of storm troopers
and waiters with ``swastika'' armbands.
   ``For us, the bar is purely business-oriented, apolitical,
artistic and entertaining,'' said manager Aor Saratuk.
   He said he and business partners focused on the Nazi theme
because its ``powerful, catchy name and emotive appeal'' would draw
young patrons in a downtown area dotted with competitive pubs with
names such as ``Express'' or ``Studio West.''
   They flock to the bar to hear live music, seemingly oblivious to
objections that it glamorizes the brutal Nazi regime.
   Aor said there have been no complaints by Thais, but in recent
weeks several foreigners have criticized the bar in letters to the
English-language Bangkok Post newspaper.
   ``Simply stated, opening a bar that glamorizes any aspect of
Adolf Hitler or the Nazi regime is an offense against our common
humanity. If we can easily forget or trivialize the Holocaust, then
we are saying that human life is not sacred,'' one letter said.
   Thongbai Thongpao, Thailand's leading human rights lawyer, said
the management may not knowingly endorse Nazi Germany, but the
bar's name has had the ``unfortunate effect of hurting other
people's feelings because of memories evoked by the Holocaust
atrocity.''
   About 6 million European Jews were systematically exterminated
by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust.
   But not everyone finds the bar offensive.
   Jean-Paul Lorbach, a tourist from Brussels, Belgium, said,
``It's very pleasing here, just like any other bar. It's definitely
not Nazism.''
   A former Thai policeman, 25-year-old Boonserm Jitarasomkuan,
called Hitler a ``notorious criminal'' but advised the management
to keep the name because he said it was ``harmless.''
   Aor called some of the bar's decor ``deliberate distortions'' of
Nazism. A 10-foot portrait of Hitler reviewing troops in a trench
coat shows his moustache turned upwards and elongated _ not the way
he wore it. One color drawing depicted him in a straightjacket, and
was captioned: ``Captured German Painting.''

<HEAD>Berlin Marks 50 Years of Nuclear Fission</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifty years ago, German scientists Otto Hahn and
Fritz Strassmann discovered nuclear fission, a breakthrough that led
to the atom bomb and nuclear energy.
   On Thursday, Berlin held the first of several events marking the
fateful work.
   The discovery by Hahn and Strassmann also was intertwined with
the Nazi era. Albert Speer, a former top aide to Adolf Hitler,
strongly implied that Hahn was one of a group of German scientists
seeking ways to build an atomic bomb before the Americans beat them
to it.
   Hahn, a physicist and chemist who won the 1944 Nobel Prize in
chemistry for his discovery, worked closely with a Jewish colleague
forced into exile by the Nazis.
   The December 1938 work at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for
Chemistry in Berlin also represented one of the many feats of the
proud German scientific tradition.
   On Thursday, scientists and officials of the Technical University
of West Berlin outlined the impact of Strassmann's and Hahn's
discovery at an exhibition of models, photographs and scientific
equipment documenting the work.
   ``The development of nuclear physics and its technology has found
interest among the public like no other discovery,'' said Ulrich
Steinmueller, vice president of the Technical University.
   ``The technology carries implicitly in its use _ both in war and
peace _ a threat for mankind,'' Steinmueller said. ``The
well-founded worries and fears of people give scientists a challenge
to be aware of their responsibilities to society.''
   West Germans have been sensitive to some of the end results of
Hahn and Strassmann's discovery: the stationing of nuclear rockets
on their soil and the fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear accident in
1986 in the Soviet Union.
   ``That day 50 years ago in Dahlem (the Berlin district where the
discovery took place) must also be remembered along with the day of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the day of Chernobyl,'' Steinmueller told
the news conference at the Technical University.
   Steinmueller added that the peaceful use of nuclear energy
``leaves open more problems than it solves.''
   Hahn and Strassmann found that bombarding the uranium atom with
neutrons leads to its splitting. At first, they were unsure of what
they had discovered.
   From her exile in Sweden, Jewish colleague Lise Meitner and her
partner, Otto Robert Frisch, furnished the theoretical basis showing
such a splitting could release huge amounts of energy through chain
reactions.
   The experiments took place in the middle of December, with the
key test starting Dec. 16, 1938.
   In the years before his discovery, Hahn had worked closely with
Meitner, who had been forced to emigrate in 1938 as the Nazis
stepped up their attacks on the Jews.
   ``It was unusual at that time to have a man and woman working
together when they weren't married,'' said Jost Lemmerich, chief
organizer of the exhibition.
   When Hahn won the prize, no mention was made of the work by
Meitner or Strassmann. Hahn died in 1968 in West Germany.
   During Thursday's news conference, Lemmerich was asked why the
exhibition stops in 1939, without covering the Nazis' scientific
research in World War II.
   ``We stopped there because the history is incomplete,'' he
responded. ``We didn't have access to the documents.''
   But he hinted another exhibition is possible to show the darker
sides of Hahn's discovery.
   ``Couldn't we, say in five years, have another exhibition about
Hiroshima?'' he asked rhetorically.
   West Berlin's Tagespiegel newspaper on Nov. 27 said Hahn wrote in
his diary of the Hiroshima attack that he had a clear conscience
``that neither during the discovery nor later did I want to work for
the use of uranium fission as a war weapon.''
   At the time, Hahn and other top German atomic scientists were
being detained in a British camp, according to the newspaper.
   Speer, Hitler's armaments minister and the Third Reich's top
architect, said that in 1942 he had heard of ``a group of scientists
who were on the track of a weapon which could annihilate whole
cities, perhaps throw the island of England out of the fight.''
   He continued that two months later he visited with scientists in
Berlin to be briefed on ``atomic research,'' as the Nazi Reich
struggled to find a way to win World War II.
   ``Along with scientists whose names I no longer recall, the
subsequent Nobel Prize winners Otto Hahn and Werner Heisenberg were
present,'' Speer wrote in his memoirs, ``Inside the Third Reich.''
   Heisenberg told Speer that building such a bomb was possible but
it would take at least two years.

   Old Marshall Ferdinand Foch, who led the allies to victory in
World War I, said at the end of that conflict, ``This is not peace.
It is an armistice for 20 years.'' He was right, almost to the day.
   Nearly two decades later, after years of threat and bluster, of
depression and inequality, of fears and lies, on Sept. 1, 1939, 50
years ago on Friday, push finally came to shove. The first shots
were fired in World War II.
   No one could say the world did not have sufficient notice.
   For instance, on the last day of January 1939 at the White House,
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had called in the Senate
Military Affairs Committee to confide his fearful appraisal of the
world. His countrymen, many of them, suffered from a bad case of
isolationism. Yet he told the senators:
   ``About three years ago we got pretty definite information that
there was in the making a policy of world domination between
Germany, Italy and Japan...There are two ways of looking at it. The
first...is the hope that somebody will assassinate Hitler from
within; that somebody will kill Mussolini or he will get a bad cold
in the morning and die...The other attitude is that we must try to
prevent the domination of the world.''
   He had drawn the line. Adolf Hitler, whom he called a ``wild
man'' and ``a nut,'' was the enemy, whether the nation knew it or
not. Peace was slipping through the trembling fingers of Europe.
   Hitler had a timetable, had since he powered his way to control
of the German government on March 5, 1933, in Germany's last free
elections, a day after Roosevelt was inaugurated as president of the
United States.
   Hitler had taken a broken Germany, re-armed it in secret, bluffed
his way into the Rhineland which Germany had given up after World
War I. He buttressed the fascist dictator Francisco Franco in Spain
and conspired with Italian dictator Benito Mussolini to divide
Europe. He bullied his way into Austria and Czechoslovakia and so
intimidated Britain and France that they welcomed the Munich pact
which British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain considered a
guarantee of ``peace in our time.'' It only convinced Hitler that
the old World War I allies were willing to pay for peace at any
price.
   Hitler had already put Poland on the plate; he needed it not only
for a breadbasket but as a source of labor. He would have Poland
even if it drew Britain and France into war. He was not, however,
ready to fight a war on two fronts.
   So he sought Joseph Stalin's assistance in the East, one of the
most bizarre alliances in modern history, the communist and the
fascist, philosophy be damned.
   The allies had dillydallied over a pact with Stalin to outflank
Hitler. They obviously did not savor doing business with the Soviet
leader. Hitler had no such compunctions. On Aug. 20, 1939, he agreed
to a Soviet-drafted non-aggression pact. In return, the Soviets
would get a free hand in the Eastern Baltic and a share of Poland.
   Hitler then put the Polish question on automatic. If the West
went to war, Italy promised to rattle sabers in the South to occupy
some French troops without actually joining the battle.
   Suddenly, on Aug, 31, the Polish ambassador's lines from Berlin
to Warsaw were cut. That night Hitler broadcast to his people peace
proposals to Poland which the Poles never heard, his usual ploy for
preparing the German mind for war.
   Finally he launched Operation Canned Goods, planned months
before. SS troops in Polish uniforms staged a mock attack on a
German radio station at Gleiwitz on the Polish border, leaving a
drugged concentration camp inmate, smeared with blood, as a German
``casualty'' of the attack. There were other such ``provocations''
along the border.
   Berlin was calmly asleep, but all communications to the outside
world were cut. Berliners would awaken to a war that would
eventually destroy them and much of Europe as well.
   At 5:20 a.m., Sept. 1, smack on Hitler's timetable, a German
warplane attacked the Polish fishing village of Puck and an adjacent
air base on the Gulf of Danzig. Twenty-five minutes later a shell
from the World War I battleship Schleswig Holstein made a direct hit
on a Polish ammunition dump at Westerplatte. At first light the
Wehrmacht began a motorized march toward Warsaw, and a new word,
``blitzkrieg,'' lightning war, was introduced into the military
lexicon.
   At 2:20 a.m., Washington time, four hours after the attack began,
the phone at President Roosevelt's bedside rang. It was his
ambassador in Paris, Bill Bullitt.
   ``Tony Biddle has just got through from Warsaw, Mr. President.
Several German divisions are deep in Polish territory and fighting
is heavy. Tony said there were reports of bombers over the city.
Then he was cut off...''
   ``Well, Bill, it's come at last. God help us all.''
   In London, mobilization was ordered. On Sept. 3, Britain went to
war. Winston Churchill, who had warned persistently of the German
threat, was made a part of an expanded war cabinet and first lord of
the admiralty, where he had served previously. Before he got there,
the word went out to the fleet, ``Winston is back.''
   In Berlin, Hitler received the news of Britain's declaration with
an immobile stare, but Hermann Goering, the head of the Luftwaffe,
said, ``If we lose this war, then God have mercy on us.''

   Using newly released Soviet documents on
400,000 of Hitler's victims, a new Red Cross clearinghouse is
offering to help people track the fates of loved ones sent to labor
or death camps by the Nazis.
   The center opened here Monday to process a flood of expected
requests for access to the records in West Germany that the Soviets
began releasing last year. Soviet soldiers recovered the documents
when the camps were liberated at the close of World War II.
   Emmy Hubert Mogilensky, the daughter of Holocaust victims, said
at the opening of the Holocaust and War Victims Tracing and
Information Center that she sympathizes with relatives who still
don't know the fate of loved ones.
   The 67-year-old woman said she grieved with her brother when the
Red Cross sent them a message in 1946 saying their parents died in
a Nazi concentration camp.As time passed, she said the letter
became a ``comfort, a closure.''
   ``For us, the questions were finally answered and we could go on
with our lives,'' said Mogilensky, who was invited to speak at the
opening.
   Millions of people, mostly Jews, were sent to labor and death
camps under Hitler. An estimated 6 million Jews were killed.
   The Soviet papers include nearly 70,000 death certificates from
the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland. Also included are the
names of 130,000 prisoners used for forced labor and 200,000
victims in other camps, including Dachau, Sachsenhausen, Gross
Rosen and Buchenwald.
   ``The pain of not knowing where they were. If they were murdered
in the camp. Did they die in the cattle cars on the way to the
camp? It haunts you. It does not let you rest,'' Mogilensky said.
``Can you imagine after 45 years still wondering, still not
knowing?''
   Copies of the Soviet documents are housed at the International
Tracing Service in Arolsen, West Germany, a branch of the Central
Tracing Agency of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
   To use the Baltimore center, people can contact local American
Red Cross chapters to obtain inquiry forms. Caseworkers send the
completed forms to Baltimore, where they are translated into German
and forwarded to Arolsen.
   Center volunteers will provide progress reports so people don't
think their requests have been forgotten.
   Diane Paul, program director of the Central Maryland Red Cross,
said certifying a Holocaust victim's fate can take months. The
research is complex, involving cross-referencing with other lists,
she said. It is further complicated by the various spellings of
names and possible inaccuracies in the records.
   ``For example, the name Schwartz can be spelled 156 different
ways, and there are 400,000 persons filed under this name alone,''
Paul said.
   Western allies released concentration camp documents soon after
World War II. But Soviet authorities had kept the records sealed
despite repeated requests.
   There are 46 million documents already on file in Arolsen
covering 13 million people. Over 44 years, the center has responded
to 1.8 million people searching for information about missing
relatives.
   ``These people, their children, their brothers, their sisters,
their cousins, aunts and uncles were no longer able to give voice
to say, `Here I am,''' said Alfred Himmelrick Jr., a Baltimore
businessman who went to see the records in Germany on a liaison
mission for the new tracing center.
   ``It was then that the 13 million people on file became real,
not abstract.''

   The radios of the day 50 years ago crackled with
the news: Adolf Hitler, Neville Chamberlain, Edouard Daladier and
Benito Mussolini had gathered to keep the world at peace. The four
men, leaders of Germany, Britain, France and Italy, came away from
their conference in the belief they had succeeded. This was Munich
1938. Not only did their pact fail but it provided a spark that
ignited World War II.

<TEXT>
   A little past 1 a.m. on Sept. 30,
1938, in the headquarters of the Nazi Party here, the leaders of
Germany, Britain, France and Italy signed the Munich Pact and told
the world war had been averted.
   ``I believe it is peace in our time,'' trumpeted Prime Minister
Neville Chamberlain of Britain.
   A year later World War II started.
   Instead of being ``appeased'' by the dismemberment of
Czechoslovakia, as the Munich Pact provided, Germany's Adolf Hitler
invaded Poland.
   The pact was, in fact, one of the great stepping stones toward
war.
   A half century later, world politics is still being shaped by
the lessons learned, the lessons unlearned and the lessons
forgotten from the Munich Pact.
   ``The sort of attitude _ `Let's not have another Munich' _ has
become a way of thinking about international politics, particularly
on the more conservative side,'' said Reinhold Meyers, a West
German political scientist and specialist on the Munich Pact.
   Meyers added that is at least partially reflected in the
continuing mistrust between East and West.
   ``Munich has become a sort of ideological catchword because it
stands for a policy of capitulation,'' Meyers said in an interview.
   The Munich talks were a last-ditch attempt, led by Chamberlain,
to appease Hitler's militaristic craving for ``Lebensraum'' (living
space) and avoid war.
   Hitler was threatening to invade Czechoslovakia, which would
have triggered an immediate European war because of France's
commitment to protect the Czechs and Britain's alliance with the
French.
   ``The Munich Pact was not only one of the most important steps
leading to World War II, but it has also become a symbol of
successful political blackmail,'' said Hermann Graml, a top West
German historian.
   Chamberlain, Premier Edouard Daladier of France, Hitler and his
ally in Italy, dictator Benito Mussolini, began the Munich
Conference on Sept. 29, 1938.
   Czechoslovak leaders were excluded as Hitler demanded.
   The site of the talks, a long, three-story, barracks-like
structure built just three years earlier, still stands and is a
music school.
   But Hitler's private office, where the four leaders met,
disappeared long ago in postwar renovations.
   Firsthand accounts of the four-power meeting describe the Nazi
leader as extremely volatile and ready to wage war if he wasn't
given Czechoslovakia's German-speaking Sudetenland.
   ``Hitler was in a crude and rude and aggressive mood _ a very
unattractive character,'' the British statesman Lord Home, who
accompanied Chamberlain as his aide, said in a recent interview
with The Associated Press at his estate in Scotland.
   Daladier, writing years after the meeting, said of the start of
the discussions: ``Hitler arose and delivered a diatribe against
the Czechs. It was a real explosion. Spreading his arms or
clenching his fists, he accused the Czechs of a frightful tyranny
over the Sudeten Germans.''
   Historians say Hitler had used the argument of
self-determination for Czechoslovakia's minority Germans as a
propaganda device to justify his claims upon the bordering nation.
   ``What he really believed in was the right of supposedly
racially superior Germans to dominate other people,'' Graml, a
Munich University professor, said during an interview at his office.
   At one point during the discussions, Chamberlain objected to
Hitler's stipulation that Czechs who would evacuate their nation's
11,000-square-mile Sudetenland, an area slightly larger than
Maryland, could not even take their cattle.
   Paul Schmidt, Hitler's translator during the conference, wrote
in later years that the Nazi leader responded impatiently: ``Our
time is too valuable to be wasted on such trivialities.''
   Chamberlain dropped the matter.
   Faced with a hostile Nazi leader who appeared ready to throw all
of Europe into war if he didn't get what he wanted, the Munich Pact
was signed.
   Leaders from all over the world welcomed the agreement and what
looked like a last-minute escape from war.
   But Winston Churchill said the pact had shamed his country.
   ``You were given the choice between war and dishonor,''
Churchill told Chamberlain later. ``You chose dishonor and will
have war.''
   Hitler was given the Sudetenland, but it quickly became obvious
he had no intention of keeping his vow to be satisfied with just
that.
   In March 1939, German troops overran the rest of Czechoslovakia.
   Six months later German troops marched into Poland, and soon the
world's major powers, including France and Britain, were embroiled
in a war that did not end until Nazi Germany's defeat in May 1945.
   Many modern-day historians, like Meyers, say Chamberlain had no
choice but to sign the Munich Pact, arguing that Britain could not
have withstood a major war at that time.
   ``The British could not afford to go to war in September 1938
because of the negative status of its air force, and they had
hardly any expeditionary force at all,'' said Meyers, a professor
at Muenster University.
   But the Munich Pact has left a lot of bitter memories.
   Some French historians say the Munich accord may be one reason
there has never been a strong French pacifist movement since World
War II.
   ``Politically, mentally, pacifism was killed by Munich,'' said
Jean-Pierre Azema, a historian at Paris' Political Science
Institute.
   The Czechoslovaks, the sacrificial victims of the Munich Pact,
also have bitter recollections of the infamous accord.
   Czechoslovakia was rebuilt after World War II and Communist
leaders were installed.
   This past February, Milos Jakes, Czechoslovakia's new Communist
Party leader, defended the Communist takeover in 1948 as a
guarantee that the nation's alliance with the Soviet Union had rid
it of dependence ``on imperialist states, for which a tragic price
was paid after Munich.''
   But Hitler's invasion was replayed 30 years later with the
Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia that crushed the 1968
``Prague Spring'' reform movement.

<TEXT>
   Fifty years ago Wednesday Nazi
troops invaded Czechoslovakia in what one historian says was an
unavoidable consequence of the West's abandonment of the nation and
Adolf Hitler's plan to conquer Europe.
   In September 1938, Czechoslovakia's allies Britain and France
bowed to German pressure and agreed to Hitler's annexation of
Czechoslovakia's German-speaking Sudetenland region, nearly
one-third of the nation's territory.
   Any Western hopes that appeasement would dissuade Hitler from
all-out war on eastern Europe ended Germany invaded the rest of
Czechoslovakia on March 15, 1939.
   Less than half a year later, Hitler's army rolled across Polish
borders, and World War II began.
   The Czechoslovak invasion was inevitable, independent historian
Milos Hajek said in an interview.
   ``Hitler's intentions were quite clear'' after the annexation, he
said. ``The strategy of (the Czech) government was to make maximum
concessions to Hitler, but even that didn't pay off.''
   Another Czech, a 25-year-old left-wing student at the time, said:
``The greatest mistake was that they (Prague leaders) believed in
the West, which proved to be so weak.''
   When Germany swallowed Austria on March 12, 1938, hundreds of
thousands feted the arriving troops.
   In Prague and other Czech towns, none cheered.
   Witnesses in Prague recalled that citizens retreated to side
streets to hide their shame and disgust. Others confronted the
invaders with clenched fists and shouted abuse.
   ``I remember the weather was awful _ sleet and rain _ and I can
still see the German bombers hovering above Prague, which was quite
a feat in those days with that kind of weather,'' said the former
student, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``I said to myself, what would it be like if there was war today.
This must perhaps be better,'' he added.
   The last meeting of the Czechoslovak government in Prague was
held on March 9, 1939. State President Emil Hacha ordered the ouster
of the Slovak government after its dissident leaders negotiated with
German and Austrian Nazis.
   A day later, Hitler decided to invade, and German troops were
ordered to take up positions by the evening of March 12.
   After the Czechoslovak government received word of Hitler's plan,
Hacha and Foreign Minister Frantisek Chvalkovsky traveled to Berlin
late on March 14. They met with Hitler, who told them their homeland
would be invaded.
   Hacha suffered a fainting attack after the meeting. A short time
later, he and Chvalkovsky signed a document imposed on them by
Hitler.
   ``The Czechoslovak state president has declared that he .... lays
the fate of the Czech people and country trustfully into the hands
of the Fuehrer of the German Reich,'' it said.
   When Nazi troops had taken over Czechoslovakia, an ecstatic
Hitler ordered his two secretaries: ``Now, you kids give me a kiss
here and here,'' pointing to his cheeks, one of the women later
recalled.
