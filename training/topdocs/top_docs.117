FOES SEEK VETO OF EXEMPTION TO AIRPORT LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opponents of a bill exempting Los Angeles County from a new law aimed at 
controlling growth around California's airports are launching a last-ditch 
effort to persuade Gov. George Deukmejian to veto the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans, the city of Los Angeles and an airport advisory panel plan to 
recommend a veto of the bill, which is bound for Deukmejian's desk after 
clearing the Assembly last week on a 51-18 vote. 
</P>
<P>
The measure passed the Senate last month. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, by state Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach), would exempt the 
county from a 7-month-old law that puts teeth into statutes designed to ensure 
that new development is compatible with the state's 269 airports. 
</P>
<P>
Without the exemption, far-reaching regulations could be placed on development 
near Los Angeles International Airport, as well as airports in other parts of 
the county, including La Verne, El Monte and Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the bill to exempt Los Angeles County from the law say the county 
is special because the land around most of its airports is already densely 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
But foes of an exemption for Los Angeles County argue that regional airport 
planning is needed to promote air safety and minimize the exposure of homes and 
businesses to aircraft noise.

Opponents of a bill exempting Los Angeles County from a new law aimed at 
controlling growth around California's airports are launching a last-ditch 
effort to persuade Gov. George Deukmejian to veto the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans, the city of Los Angeles and an airport advisory panel created by the 
Legislature all plan to recommend a veto of the bill, which is bound for 
Deukmejian's desk after clearing the Assembly on Wednesday on a 51-18 vote. The 
measure passed the Senate last month. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, by state Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach), would exempt the 
county from a 7-month-old law that puts teeth into statutes designed to ensure 
that new development is compatible with the state's 269 airports. 
</P>
<P>
Without the exemption, far-reaching regulations could be placed on development 
near Los Angeles International Airport, as well as airports in other parts of 
the county, including Santa Monica, Torrance, Hawthorne and Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
The law that took effect earlier this year requires regional land use plans to 
be drafted for property surrounding the state's airports by June 30, 1991 -- 
except in Los Angeles County, which won an extension until Jan. 1, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
In counties that fail to meet the deadline, citizens can file lawsuits to block 
development within a mile of an airport's runways. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Beverly's bill to give Los Angeles County a complete exemption 
from the land-use law say the county is special because in all but a few cases, 
the land around its airports is already densely developed. Led by the Los 
Angeles County branch of the League of California cities, the supporters also 
object that the law will force cities to yield to a countywide airport planning 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly says he expects such arguments to carry weight with Deukmejian. 
"There's been some modest opposition, but I feel confident he'll sign it," the 
senator said. 
</P>
<P>
But foes of an exemption for Los Angeles County argue that regional airport 
planning is needed to promote air safety and minimize the exposure of homes and 
businesses to aircraft noise. They say such problems have led to the closure or 
conversion to private use of 18 airports in the state during the last 10 years 
-- a time of growing demand for air service. 
</P>
<P>
Among those planning to make these arguments to Deukmejian are the California 
Department of Transportation, the California Commission on Aviation and 
Airports and the city of Los Angeles, which wants planning mechanisms in place 
as it moves to develop a public airport in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
"No one wants an airport in their back yard," said Anne Blue, one of the city 
of Los Angeles' lobbyists in Sacramento. "So if you leave this planning up to 
the local governments, they're going to be responsive to their constituents and 
limit the expansion and siting of airports."

CONTROL TOWER MANAGER TOM REA IS PROMOTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Wayne Airport control tower Manager Tom Rea has been promoted to assistant 
air traffic manager at the Federal Aviation Administration's regional control 
center in El Toro, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Rea's move was not connected with recent criticism of El Toro center, known as 
Coast TRACON, by the National Transportation Safety Board, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Fowler, a member of the operations staff at the FAA's western regional 
headquarters in Los Angeles, has replaced Rea at the FAA's John Wayne Airport 
tower. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler also worked previously as an air traffic controller at Los Angeles 
International Airport. At John Wayne Airport, he will supervise a staff of 26 
controllers. He said Friday that he might ask for one or two more controllers 
later this year, when new air safety zones are scheduled to be implemented 
around John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Takeoffs and landings totaled 533,484 at John Wayne Airport in 1988, compared 
to 623,519 at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Aircraft arriving and departing John Wayne Airport are controlled within a 
five-mile radius by the FAA tower there. Beyond that radius, aircraft are 
controlled by Coast TRACON.

GOVERNOR VETOES AIRPORT BILL EXEMPTING COUNTY 
</P>

Gov. George Deukmejian on Tuesday rejected legislation that would have exempted 
Los Angeles County from a law designed to control growth around the state's 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
Under current law, county planners have until 1992 to fashion comprehensive 
land-use plans to ensure that commercial and residential development around Los 
Angeles International Airport and the county's other airports -- including 
those in La Verne, El Monte and Burbank -- are compatible with flight safety 
and noise control regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Those supporting the bill to exempt the county from this requirement argued 
that such plans are unnecessary because land around most local airports already 
is densely developed. 
</P>
<P>
But in vetoing the bill Tuesday, Deukmejian said, "Without such planning, 
airports and the businesses surrounding them may be forced to close as 
development encroaches" because the increasing population would put airports in 
violation of state law. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's action is the latest twist in a controversy that surfaced in 
1989 after Deukmejian signed a bill to put teeth into a 20-year-old requirement 
for land-use planning around airports statewide. That measure prompted an 
outcry from a number of Los Angeles County cities complaining that their 
planning authority around airports would be usurped by the county. 
</P>
<P>
The exemption proposal was introduced by Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan 
Beach), who earlier this year successfully shepherded legislation that gives 
Los Angeles County an extra six months to comply with the law. But in vetoing 
Beverly's follow-up bill, Deukmejian said he would not allow the law to be 
eased any more. 
</P>
<P>
Clancy Leland -- a lobbyist for Los Angeles County, which pushed for passage of 
the exemption measure -- said he was unsure if the proposal will be revived 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
Leland complained that the current law is "so vague, so general, it doesn't 
tell you what you are supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
Other critics of the current law have argued that Los Angeles County's Regional 
Planning Commission, designated by state law as the airport planning agency, 
does not have the staff to handle the workload involved in planning around 
airports.

   Braniff International Airlines filed for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code,
only five weeks after starting up flights from Dallas.
   Braniff said it took the action because of a dispute over
landing rights at Los Angeles International Airport. That, in
turn, caused the loss of a major charter contract with a
Canadian tour company and subsequently affected commercial
flights between Dallas and Los Angeles, Braniff said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An official from the Los Angeles airport disputed
Braniff's charge. "The Department of Airports has not denied
nor in any way interfered with access to LAX, and Braniff has
in fact been operating here since May 1991," said Clifton A.
Moore, the airports' executive director.
   Braniff also said it was financially damaged in recent
months by the actions of a lessor, which Braniff said wrongly
declared that it had defaulted on a leasing agreement. The
Miami-based company is an affiliate of International Air
Leases, and a spokeswoman there said no one was available to
comment.
   Braniff said it plans legal action against Los Angeles
International Airport and International Air Leases to recover
damages.
   Braniff is the third incarnation, and a separate legal
entity, from the other airlines of the same name that filed
for Chaptere 11 protection in 1982 and 1989, respectively.
The current Braniff is privately owned by real estate
developers Jeffrey A. Chodorow and Arthur Cohen, who were
backers of the last Braniff as well.

<TEXT>
   Air traffic controllers warned a British
Airways pilot he was on a collision course with another airliner,
allowing a hasty turn that averted a possible in-flight crash,
authorities said.
   ``There is an investigation. We did have two aircraft that
violated the parameters established for separation,'' Fred O'Donnell
of the Federal Aviation Administration confirmed Thursday.
   The British Airways and American Airlines jetliners came within
15 seconds of colliding Monday night over Westminster after one of
the jets was rerouted because a power blackout briefly closed Orange
County John Wayne Airport, the Orange County Register reported.
   Controllers at the Los Angeles Terminal Radar Facility said the
planes, flying at 9,000 feet, came within 1{ miles horizontally and
200 feet vertically of each other, the paper said. O'Donnell said he
was couldn't divulge the distances separating the planes.
   FAA regulations require that planes be kept at least three miles
apart horizontally and 1,000 feet vertically.
   An unidentified controller at the Los Angeles facility spotted
the potential collision and warned the British Airways jet.
   John Wayne Airport was closed to commercial traffic for about
four hours Monday night because a short-circuit shut down the main
runway lights.
   The American jet, scheduled to land at the airport 40 miles
southwest of Los Angeles, was diverted to Ontario International
Airport because of the blackout, said Jim Brown, an American
spokesman in Dallas.
   American Flight 1262 from San Jose had 66 people on board and was
being guided by controllers at the FAA's radar center at El Toro,
airline and FAA officials said.
   The British Airways Boeing 747, which can carry as many as 376
people, was departing Los Angeles International Airport for London.
It was being guided by Los Angeles controllers.

   Two jetliners came within 15 seconds of
colliding after one of the planes was rerouted because of an
electrical blackout at John Wayne Airport, a newspaper reported
today.
   The Federal Aviation Administration was investigating the near
collision Monday night involving a British Airways jumbo jet and an
American Airlines jetliner over Westminster, the Orange County
Register reported.
   Air-traffic controllers in the Los Angeles Terminal Radar
Facility at the time of the incident said the planes flew within 1{
miles horizontally and 200 feet vertically of each other. FAA
regulations mandate that planes be kept at least three miles apart
horizontally and 1,000 feet vertically.
   Controllers, whose identities were withheld because of a pending
investigation, told the newspaper that a controller in Los Angeles
spotted the potential collision just after 7 p.m. and quickly warned
the British Airways jet to turn.
   Controllers said the planes, which were flying at about 300 mph,
would have collided in about 15 seconds.
   ``There is an investigation for a possible (controller)
operational error,'' said Barbara Abels, an FAA spokeswoman in Los
Angeles.
   The planes were at an altitude of 9,000 feet, Ms. Abels said, but
she said she did not know how close the aircraft came. Neither pilot
filed a near collision report with the FAA, she said, adding that
pilots have leeway on whether to file a report
   An electrical short-circuit that blackened the main runway lights
prompted officials to close John Wayne Airport to commercial traffic
for about four hours Monday night.
   The American jet was diverted to Ontario International Airport
because of the blackout, said Jim Brown, an American spokesman in
Dallas.
   American Flight 1262 from San Jose had 66 people on board and was
being guided by controllers at the FAA's radar center at El Toro,
airline and FAA officials said.
   The British Airways Boeing 747, which can carry up to 376 people,

AIRPORT INQUIRY MAY DELAY FOOD SERVICES PACT AT JOHN WAYNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lucrative contract for food services at the new John Wayne Airport terminal 
scheduled to open next year may be delayed because of an inquiry into alleged 
misuse of minority contractor rules at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County officials identified Andy M. Camacho on Friday as the proposed 
minority partner for Host International Inc. at the new John Wayne terminal. 
Camacho, a Los Angeles resident who is a political ally of Los Angeles 
Councilman Richard Alatorre, is also a partner in a LAX concession now being 
reviewed by Los Angeles Airport officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think there's anything wrong, and he'll probably still get the 
contract here, but just to be safe we're going to run it by the Federal 
Aviation Administration's civil rights office," said Kathie Rutherford, John 
Wayne Airport spokeswoman. "We won't sign the contract until the FAA is 
satisfied with it." 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether Orange County's proposed minority-owned business contract 
with Camacho requires him to engage in hands-on management of Host's John Wayne 
Airport franchise. The minority business contracts at LAX have come under fire 
for allegedly allowing Camacho and others to serve as mere figureheads and not 
active corporate officials, contrary to the intent of federal 
disadvantaged/minority business enterprise regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Camacho could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Rutherford said airport officials believe that the John Wayne contract meets 
all regulations imposed by the FAA on minority contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent Joubert Jr., the FAA's regional civil rights officer, said his office 
will review John Wayne Airport's minority-owned business contracts at the 
request of Orange County officials. He said he does not know when the review 
will be completed. 
</P>
<P>
"I commend them for it," Joubert said of the county's decision to seek a 
review. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know yet what was contained in L.A. contracts, so I can't make a 
comparison with the John Wayne situation," Joubert said. "John Wayne Airport 
asked us to take a look at their contracts to make sure that the content 
prescribes levels of participation for joint venture partners. We said we'd 
keep them advised, but the final call is John Wayne Airport's. And so far 
they've done everything they're supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors selected Host International last March to operate a 
9,188-square-foot central food and beverage area, including a restaurant in the 
new passenger terminal scheduled to open April 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the board selected McDonald's to operate the new terminal's 
fast-food stands, which will be physically separated from the central food and 
beverage area operated by Host International. 
</P>
<P>
Host will also operate two cocktail bars at both ends of the new terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Host's contract with Orange County anticipates that the Los Angeles-based firm 
will gross $4.2 million during the first year of operation at John Wayne. The 
county will receive at least $760,000 a year from the Host contract.

50 ILLEGALS SEIZED AT LAX IN THIRD INS SWEEP IN 2 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From United Press International

<TEXT>
<P>
Fifty illegal aliens were detained at Los Angeles International Airport as they 
waited to board flights to other parts of the country in the third big 
immigration sweep at airports in two days, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Agents from the Immigration and Naturalization Service detained the illegal 
aliens late Thursday, said Ben Davidian, INS western regional commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, immigration agents in Atlanta detained 53 illegal immigrants 
aboard an Eastern Airlines flight. It was the second consecutive day aliens 
were captured while trying to make their way to New York from the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, agents swept through terminals at Los Angeles International 
Airport and rounded up 50 suspected illegal aliens by midnight, Davidian said. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration authorities decided on the Los Angeles sweep after the arrests in 
Atlanta, where suspected illegal aliens were pulled from flights that 
originated in Los Angeles, Davidian said. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said the sweeps, called Operation Red Eye Repeat, were part of 
a continuing operation in response to an increase in smuggling of illegal 
aliens. All major airports have been targeted, including Los Angeles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles is a real hub," Davidian said. "This is the main area where 
undocumented aliens want to come because there is so much employment." 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said the Los Angeles operation was a "drop in the bucket" 
compared to the 1,500 to 2,000 illegal workers that are picked up in the San 
Diego area every day. 
</P>
<P>
The 50 suspects detained Thursday night included people from Panama, Pakistan, 
India, Mexico and El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
The illegal aliens picked up in Atlanta were the cargo in a massive smuggling 
ring that has been under investigation since last year, the INS said. Most of 
the aliens were going to New York seeking employment, officials said.

<LEADPARA>  The fiery runway collision at Los Angeles International Airport that killed 35
people on Feb. 1 was caused by the failure of air traffic controllers to
follow Federal Aviation Administration rules, a federal safety panel said
Wednesday.;   The crew at the Los Angeles tower -- one of the busiest in the
nation -- was still not complying with FAA rules nine months after the
accident, the National Transportation Safety Board said.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  CONTROLLERS GIVEN BLAME IN L.A. CRASH  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The board also faulted the FAA for failing to discover that the tower at
Los Angeles International was improperly handling takeoffs, landings and
ground operations.;   "Such gross violations of national standards I find
unbelievable," said board Chairman James Kolstad.;   The accident occurred
when a Skywest Airlines commuter airliner preparing to take off for Palmdale
was told to hold its position on a Los Angeles airport runway. It was rammed
by USAir Boeing 737 from Columbus, Ohio, that was cleared to land on the same
runway.;   The wreckage of the two planes careened off the runway and crashed
into an abandoned airport fire station.;   Investigators found that the air
traffic controller handling both the Skywest and USAir flights had become
confused about which planes she was handling for takeoff.;   Under FAA rules,
slips of paper identifying planes are supposed to be handed off from one
controller to another as planes move in and out of the airport.;   The
controller handling the Skywest and USAir flights was given slips of paper,
but the number of slips did not match up with the number of planes she was
assigned. In her confusion, she failed to note that she had set two planes on
a collision course, the board said.;   Safety board Vice Chairwoman Susan
Coughlin accused the FAA of "a fairly gross lack of oversight" at the Los
Angeles tower, even though facility procedures were subjected to constant
review.;   The safety board said that while traffic at the time of the
collision was moderate, the controller handling the Skywest and USAir flights
was busy and should have been assigned an assistant. In addition, the
controller's radar screen that could have showed the location of planes on the
ground was not operating. The equipment is notoriously unreliable, board
investigators said.  </TEXT>

In an effort to make the Southern California skies safer, federal aviation 
officials announced Monday that they will use Miramar Naval Air Station in San 
Diego as the location for a radar approach center for air traffic control, 
consolidating four facilities in Los Angeles, Burbank, Ontario and El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
The new 100,000-square-foot center, which will be built on Navy land, will 
direct air traffic in a 30,000-square-mile area from Ontario to Santa Catalina 
and Burbank to Oceanside. The planned facility will monitor about 2 million 
flights annually, at altitudes up to 13,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, controllers and pilots were generally receptive to the 
consolidation plan at Miramar. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Terminal Radar Approach Control, or TRACON, at El Toro has drawn 
heavy criticism from controllers and congressional investigators in recent 
years because of its antiquated radar and computer equipment. In addition, 
Federal Aviation Administration officials say the building doesn't meet 
earthquake standards. 
</P>
<P>
Coast controllers also have complained of chronic understaffing. The facility 
is currently staffed with 60 controllers when it is allotted a total of 78, 
said a controller there. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's existing TRACON at Miramar will remain separate, though it may be 
combined with the proposed Southern California facility after 1995, said FAA 
spokeswoman Elly Brekke. 
</P>
<P>
"You now have four facilities that separately control airspace in the L.A. 
Basin -- now we're going to have one facility. When you manage a single 
facility you have much better control and that will enhance safety," Jerry 
Chavkin, the FAA Western-Pacific regional administrator, said. 
</P>
<P>
The radar center, expected to cost $114 million and open in late 1993, will use 
a new telecommunications system as well as equipment from the other four 
facilities, Chavkin said. There will be no immediate increase in the number of 
air traffic controllers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current system, a pilot might be in touch with several TRACON 
controllers in approaching an airport in the Los Angeles Basin. At the airport 
in Torrance, one-half of the airspace is controlled by the Los Angeles TRACON, 
the rest by the TRACON at El Toro, Chavkin said. Under the new system, the 
pilot would speak only with the Southern Californian TRACON at Miramar. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board, some pilots and air traffic 
controllers have criticized the FAA for inadequate controller staffing and poor 
equipment in Southern California TRACONs. Several say these conditions have 
contributed to several near-misses. On Feb. 13, for example, a British Airways 
Boeing 747 carrying 286 passengers came within two miles of an American 
Airlines jet with 70 aboard. FAA rules require three miles of horizontal 
separation. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems foolhardy that they would go build a new installation and not stock 
it with more staffers and top quality equipment," said Richard D. Russell, a 
pilot and the regional air safety coordinator with the Airline Pilots 
Association in Los Angeles. "Unless they can staff it with an adequate number 
of controllers, they're not going to be able to handle the traffic. They 
certainly cannot handle it right now." 
</P>
<P>
Southern California skies are among the most congested in the United States. 
Orange County has 12,200 licensed commercial and general aviation pilots; Los 
Angeles County has 27,000. In 1988, there were 533,484 takeoffs and landings at 
John Wayne Airport in Orange County and 623,519 at Los Angeles International 
Airport. John Wayne Airport handles a heavy amount of general aviation traffic, 
while LAX handles almost all commercial traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Chavkin with the FAA says he is confident the existing facilities can handle 
the current air traffic using their current equipment and that they will 
continue to do so until the San Diego center opens. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego site was chosen after a yearlong search during which proposals 
were solicited from 21 airports and military bases in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles TRACON employees will be among the first to move to the new 
facility, which eventually will house about 400 controllers, technicians and 
other personnel, she said. 
</P>
<P>
At Miramar, the reaction to the new center was muted. 
</P>
<P>
"No agreement has been made," said Chief Bobbie Carlton. "The next step is for 
them to come to Miramar with a shopping list of what they would like to do." 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Mike Desrosiers, a Coast TRACON controller for the past eight 
years, said there will be better equipment and newer facilities than what he 
and about 60 other controllers have had in El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Desrosiers said that working in one big radar center would not affect the way 
controllers handle airspace throughout the Southland. Jay Gassner, a flight 
instructor for Martin Aviation at John Wayne Airport, is not concerned with the 
controllers' location. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is to have the airspace covered and to have enough guys 
covering the (radar) screens," Gassner said. "As far as being physically 
located in one place or another, I don't think that's the issue." 
</P>
<P>
Gassner compared the consolidation plan for Southland TRACONs to one that has 
long been in effect for coverage of the nation's high-altitude airspace. 
Controllers work out of one facility in Palmdale and cover airspace above 
13,000 feet over all of Southern California and parts of Nevada and Arizona, he 
said.

FT  06 JUN 94 / UK Company News: WH Smith in US airport deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WH Smith, the retailing and distribution group, has signed its biggest US
airport deal so far, expected to add Dollars 25m to its current annual
turnover of Dollars 65m (Pounds 43.3m) from its 93 US airport shops.
The company has been awarded a contract to operate eight news and gift shops
at Los Angeles International, the world's fourth largest airport.
The contract is the largest news and gift concession in a US airport,
representing about 40 per cent of all concessionary business at Los Angeles
International,
Smith beat competition from the existing incumbent, Duty Free Shoppers, and
Allders International, the duty and tax free retailer.
The Los Angeles contract follows recent awards of concessions at Denver,
Atlanta and Louisville airports.
It takes the number of US airports where Smith has outlets to 15, including
Chicago, Orlando and Las Vegas.
The biggest airport where it is not yet represented is Dallas-Fort Worth,
but Smith says it will pitch for a contract there as soon as there is an
opportunity.
'We have broken through the sound barrier in terms of getting ourselves
established as a name in US airport retailing,' the company said. 'We now
have critical mass.'
Smith has been expanding in the US since 1985. In addition to airport shops,
it has 270 hotel outlets as well as the 170-store music chain The Wall, and
Waterstone's bookshops in Boston and Chicago. Other openings are planned.
While most of its airport outlets are news stands and gift shops under the
WH Smith name, it is keen to expand The Wall and Waterstone's formats into
airports, and has already done so at Pittsburgh airport.
With 60 more large US airports where it is not represented, and passenger
volumes expected to double in the next 15 years, the company sees
significant expansion opportunities. The business is lucrative, with sales
densities of more than Dollars 1,000 (Pounds 660) a square foot last year.
The company's ambitions are in line with forecasts by experts such as
Professor Gary Davies of Manchester's International Centre for Retail
Studies. He predicts that large travel termini, with their high customer
densities, will become increasingly popular sites for retailers.
Smith is also monitoring airport developments in east Asia with a view to
opening retail outlets there.

<HEAD>LA Most Dangerous, Dallas-Fort Worth Safest, Newspaper Poll Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pilots responding to a survey on airport safety
rated Los Angeles International the most dangerous in the nation
and Dallas-Fort Worth International the safest, it was reported
Monday.
   However, many of the pilots said the main factor governing
airport safety is people, and that can vary at any facility at any
time, according to the survey, conducted by The Atlantic
Constitution.
   The newspaper in February and March polled 2,200 pilots who hold
air transportation certificates, asking them to list in no
particular order the five safest and least safest airports.
   The newspaper, reporting the survey results in its Monday
editions, said 1,360 pilots responded. The report did not include
how many times a particular airport was named and did not list
additional airports.
   In addition to Los Angeles International, the airports listed as
the five least safe were Washington's National, New York's
LaGuardia, Chicago's O'Hare and, in a tie, San Diego's Lindbergh
Field and Denver's Stapleton International.
   In addition to the Texas airport, listed among the five safest
facilities were O'Hare, Hartsfield-Atlanta International,
Washington's Dulles and Seattle@Tacoma.
   Many pilots, in written comments, said it was difficult to rate
airports for safety.
   ``It depends on the people,'' wrote a Continental pilot. ``These
constantly change. So an airport that could be labeled unsafe today
might not be tomorrow.''
   A Trans World Airlines pilot said, ``It can be compared to the
question, `Where is the safest place to drive a car?' Texas has
great long and wide roads (that are) well lit. But you better watch
out because an animal or human with a gun might ruin your whole
day. The key is pilot complacency.''
   But quite a few pilots had gripes about specific airports. Some
of the harshest criticism was reserved for Washington's National,
where pilots expressed displeasure with that airport's noise
abatement procedures and the ban on flying over national monuments.
   National's noise rules require them to cut power on takeoff
while performing relatively tricky maneuvers at uncomfortably low
altitudes.
   ``This is particularly a consideration when aircraft are
departing for long flights and may be loaded to or near maximum
allowable weight,'' wrote a Pan Am pilot with 22 years' experience.
``Power loss in conjunction with low-altitude maneuvering and even
minimal wind shear or turbulence could be disastrous.''
   The rule about national monuments makes pilots take awkward
routes in and out of the airport, poll returns said.
   National, the airport of choice for Congressmen and lobbyists,
remains open ``only ... for political convenience,'' one pilot said.
   Los Angeles International also drew the ire of many respondents.
Among the problems at that airport, pilots said, was its varied mix
of small planes and jumbo jets.
   ``Any airport that mixes light aircraft and commercial jet
aircraft is less safe in direct proportion to the number of light
aircraft using the facility,'' one pilot wrote. ``Light aircraft
are difficult to see and often do not show up on air traffic
control radar.''
   Chicago's O'Hare stood out for making both the five-safest and
five-most dangerous lists. It received praise from several pilots
for its controllers' ability to deal well with the combined
pressures of heavy traffic and winter storms.
   To get to LaGuardia, pilots must run the gantlet between Newark
and Kennedy airports, both within 15 miles.
   ``That can make approaches kind of dicey,'' one pilot wrote.
LaGuardia also has strict noise-abatement rules similar to those at
National.
   The paper printed no specific comments on either the San Diego
or Denver airports.

FAA RULE THREATENS SAFETY ABOVE LAX, PILOTS' GROUP CHARGES

<P>
The busy airspace over seven U.S. airports, including Los Angeles International 
Airport, has been declared "critically deficient" in safety by an airline 
pilots' group because of an FAA rule that gives air traffic controllers more 
latitude in determining how far apart to keep planes. 
</P>
<P>
The seven locations -- areas of rigidly controlled airspace called Terminal 
Control Areas -- were placed on a "Black Star' list by the 70-member 
International Federation of Air Lines Pilots Assns., meeting this week in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The change was instituted at the seven locations in 1988 as part of a two-year 
test program. 
</P>
<P>
Under previous FAA rules, planes were required to be at least three miles 
apart. Under the change, which the pilots' group says was quietly instituted by 
the FAA, the controller "can now let aircraft get as close as he wants, as long 
as in his judgment they will not collide," according to Capt. Henry Duffy, 
president of the U.S. Air Line Pilots Assn., which is associated with the 
international group. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles spokesman for the federal agency Wednesday defended the FAA's 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a compromise of air safety," FAA spokesman Fred O'Donnell said. 
"This was done with full cognizance of the airlines in 1988. It's a test 
program. The objective is to reduce the near-midair-collisions possibility, 
increase service to the pilots and to handle more air traffic." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy said in a prepared statement that the newly adopted Black Star 
designations were aimed at the controlled airspace at the seven locations -- 
not the airports beneath them. 
</P>
<P>
"The Black Star rating does not mean that these Terminal Control Areas are 
'unsafe,' " he said. "It simply means that they now have a safety deficiency 
that warrants notification of airline pilots worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
Though the FAA instituted the change two years ago, the pilots' association did 
not discover the "positive separation" rule change at LAX and the six other 
sites until late last year, Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Los Angeles, the Terminal Control Areas added to the "Black Star" list 
include Charlotte, N.C.; Memphis, Tenn.; Cleveland, Dallas-Fort Worth, 
Philadelphia and Phoenix..

CITY CHARGES VAN OPERATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Atty. James K. Hahn has filed a 134-count criminal complaint against the 
operator of a hotel near Los Angeles International Airport for what he called 
its "stunning indifference" to safety problems in its airport shuttle fleet. 
</P>
<P>
The charges against Trusthouse Forte Inc. and company President Barry Lee 
Conrad stem from the firm's failure to adequately maintain its fleet of shuttle 
buses at the Viscount Hotel, at 9750 Airport Blvd., Hahn charged this week. 
</P>
<P>
Trusthouse Forte operates the hotel and runs its airport shuttle service, Hahn 
said. Conrad and other company officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The fleet has flunked four consecutive safety inspections since last August, 
mostly on violations of the California Vehicle Safety Code, Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Asha Saund, who is handling the case, said the vehicles were 
often in such bad condition that authorities ordered them removed from service 
due to "imminently hazardous mechanical defects," including emergency exit 
windows that were screwed shut, defective exhaust systems underneath passenger 
areas, and loose bolts securing passenger seats to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Arraignment in the case is set for Aug. 2 in West Los Angeles Municipal Court.

NEW COMMUTER AIRLINE BUCKS ODDS IN OXNARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A commuter air service will begin flights out of Oxnard Airport this month, 
despite the failure of at least four similar efforts in the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The California Air Shuttle will provide direct service from Oxnard to San 
Francisco, San Jose, Sacramento and Las Vegas. It adds to the offerings of 
American Eagle, which flies to Los Angeles International Airport, and United 
Express, which services Los Angeles International and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
While all three lines say they expect business to warrant expansion, the 
history is discouraging. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been many before them," said Nona Makinson, operations manager of 
Ventura County Airports. "They have come and gone." 
</P>
<P>
Those lines flew direct routes to places such as Los Angeles, Sacramento, Long 
Beach and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
But they have struggled to obtain airplanes, gain route approval from the 
Federal Aviation Administration and get permission to land at airports already 
crowded with larger planes, Makinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Desert Air leased counter space at Oxnard Airport for five months last year, 
but never offered any flights because its planes were never delivered, Makinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
California Air Shuttle, though, received three of its planes this week. It has 
received clearance from the U.S. Department of Transportation and awaits 
inspection by the FAA, said Michael Minson, company chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle, the first commuter line to base its headquarters in Oxnard, is 
scheduled to start flights next week on its 19-passenger, pressurized 
twin-turbo jet-propeller planes. 
</P>
<P>
The service is targeting business people who must fly north for a conference in 
the morning and return by evening, Minson said. 
</P>
<P>
Fares will be equivalent to prices charged for flying out of Los Angeles 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Minson picked Oxnard after a marketing study he commissioned indicated growth 
in Ventura County's higher-income, business-executive population. 
</P>
<P>
Further need was indicated by what Minson described as a doubling of commute 
time from the county to Los Angeles International in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
The other two carriers at Oxnard Airport -- the only county airport that 
provides commuter service -- also plan to tap into the potential market. 
</P>
<P>
United Express, which has operated out of Oxnard for almost two years, started 
direct service to San Francisco in September. 
</P>
<P>
And American Eagle, a subsidiary of American Airlines that has leased space at 
Oxnard for more than a year, plans to offer direct flights to San Jose sometime 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Minson already is thinking of expanding California Air Shuttle services to 
Orange County, Bakersfield, Oakland, Santa Rosa and Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is trying to avoid becoming another statistic by providing cushy 
comforts to passengers. 
</P>
<P>
To drown out plane noise, each passenger will have earphones to tune into a 
compact-disc player system offering pop music and classic radio comedies. 
</P>
<P>
The high-gloss, cardboard ticket jackets are designed to be reminiscent of 
those handed out on the Concorde, and the planes are decorated in bright red, 
royal blue and light beige. 
</P>
<P>
"They look like rockets," Minson said. 
</P>
<P>
Minson said he expected to see a return on his investment within the first 
three months of service. 
</P>
<P>
"People that travel have been waiting for this," Minson said. "There seems to 
be a lot of enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
But the shuttle service will help not only residents trying to leave Ventura 
County. It may aid in promoting Ventura County to tourists, said Rob Varley, 
executive director of the Oxnard Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
The direct Sacramento flight will help convention business, while Las Vegas 
residents looking for an escape from soaring temperatures may be attracted to 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's going to be a real plus for getting people into the area," Varley 
said.

<LEADPARA>  With last week's collision of two airliners at Los Angeles International
Airport highlighting the growing danger of runway accidents, the Federal
Aviation Administration is about to announce a new initiative to deal with the
hazard.;    Agency sources said the effort, to be announced as early as this
week, will begin by making runway and taxiway markings standard throughout the
nation, something the National Transportation Safety Board and safety experts
have advocated for years.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The FAA also will target four airports to test new ground radar technology
and study possible changes in how to move planes on the ground -- perhaps even
change ages-old flying terminology, the sources said. In addition, the FAA
intends to solicit breakthrough technology from the aerospace industry,
including such things as computer screen maps of airports for jetliner
cockpits.;    The FAA initiative comes as its own records show that
near-collisions among planes on the ground have increased to 267 in 1990, up
almost 50 percent from 179 such collisions in 1988.;    So-called runway
incursions have been relatively infrequent at Los Angeles International, but
the incidents have been increasing there, too. After two such incidents in
both 1988 and 1989, there were four last year.;    The timing of the FAA
initiative was coincidental, said an FAA official who asked not to be
identified. The effort was begun last year, the official said.  </TEXT>

FAA DRAWS CRITICISM IN AIRLINER NEAR-MISS; 
</P>
<P>
AGENCY FAILED TO FIX TRAFFIC CONTROL PROBLEMS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO O.C. 
INCIDENT, NTSB SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Government safety officials said Wednesday that the Federal Aviation 
Administration's "failure to address and correct" air traffic control 
deficiencies and problems contributed to a narrow miss between two airliners 
over Orange County last February. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board said an investigation of the Coast 
Terminal Radar Approach Control, or TRACON, facility at the El Toro Marine 
Corps Air station showed that FAA management personnel had verified and 
documented these problems over the last 3 years, but had taken no remedial 
action. 
</P>
<P>
"The FAA's quality assurance and safety oversight of the (air traffic control) 
system . . . is inadequate and ineffective," the NTSB concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The NTSB also noted that an El Toro air controller's failure to alert Los 
Angeles air traffic controllers of an approaching airliner led to the narrow 
miss of the two aircraft over Westminster in February. 
</P>
<P>
While not responding specifically to most of these criticisms, the FAA stated 
Wednesday that it has already undertaken a series of projects designed to 
correct any problems at Coast TRACON. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County facility helps direct traffic to and from Los Angeles 
International, Ontario, John Wayne and Long Beach airports through some of the 
most heavily traveled air corridors in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The NTSB investigation was launched in response to the incident over 
Westminster about 7:10 p.m. on Feb. 13. Radar data showed that a British 
Airways Boeing 747 jetliner with 286 passengers on board was climbing out of 
LAX, en route to London, when it passed within 2 miles of an American Airlines 
BAe-146B jet flying to Ontario at the same altitude with 70 people aboard. FAA 
rules require 3 miles of horizontal separation and 1,000 feet of vertical 
separation. 
</P>
<P>
A controller at Los Angeles TRACON, which had been tracking the 747, warned the 
British pilot that there was other traffic in the area and the pilot made a 
quick turn to avoid the other plane. Both aircraft continued on to their 
destinations without incident. 
</P>
<P>
The NTSB concluded that the near-miss occurred "because of incomplete and 
misunderstood coordination between controllers at LAX Center and Coast TRACON 
and because . . . controllers at coast TRACON failed to comply with provisions 
of letters of agreement between Coast TRACON and adjacent facilities." 
</P>
<P>
The board singled out the Los Angeles controller for praise, commending his 
"immediate and decisive actions" to warn the 747 pilot. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the board noted that the Coast TRACON controller cleared the 
American Airlines plane to fly into airspace delegated to the Los Angeles 
facility without properly notifying Los Angeles controllers that he had done 
so. 
</P>
<P>
The unnamed controller was temporarily removed from his or her post, retrained, 
retested and then returned to the same position, where the controller was 
closely monitored for 30 days, according to the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
Among the "numerous deficiencies and problems" cited by the board were 
"inadequate controller staffing, excessive use of overtime . . . and inadequate 
size and poor physical condition of the operational quarters" at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
"Specifically, the facility is run down, noise from military jets is a problem, 
rotary phone equipment is out of date and inadequate and the facility manager 
questions the health hazards of the environmental control system," the NTSB 
said. "Controllers have been working scheduled overtime since 1985 (and) 6-day 
workweeks are required 66% of the time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Error Rates Compared 
</P>
<P>
During 1988, seven controller errors were committed by Coast TRACON personnel, 
which worked out to 1.31 errors for every 100,000 flight operations. By 
comparison, the NTSB said, error rates during the same period at other 
facilities included 0.56 at Seattle TRACON, 0.56 at Ontario TRACON and 0.17 at 
Sacramento TRACON. 
</P>
<P>
The board concluded that these safety problems warrant "immediate action and 
corrective actions by the FAA to prevent a diminished level of safety in the 
high traffic density of the Southern California Basin area." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Ferrar, an FAA spokesman in Washington, said Wednesday that his agency 
already has begun a long-range program, "planned and developed over the past 
several years," to renovate and modernize the Coast TRACON facility. 
</P>
<P>
Admitting a "significant staffing problem," which he said was largely due to 
the high cost of living in the Orange County area, Ferrar said the FAA has 
begun a concerted recruitment program to attract more controllers. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Moore, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Assn. local at 
Coast TRACON, was in Washington on Wednesday preparing his testimony for a 
congressional panel investigating air safety. 
</P>
<P>
Moore agreed that part of Coast TRACON's inability to attract more controllers 
is the high cost of living in Orange County, and he said he supports an FAA 
plan to pay a 20% salary bonus to controllers at 11 FAA facilities around the 
country, including Coast TRACON. 
</P>
<P>
Moore added that "it's no coincidence" that the FAA has announced a delay in 
two air safety projects involving Coast TRACON due to a lack of controllers at 
the same time the NTSB findings were made public. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said that the two air safety projects -- one creating a radar control 
zone around John Wayne Airport and the other rerouting air traffic throughout 
the region -- would increase the workload at Coast TRACON from 530,448 flight 
operations in 1988 to more than 1 million a year by mid-1990. 
</P>
<P>
"The NTSB did not exaggerate the problem," Moore said. "We are understaffed. 
The manager at Coast TRACON recently picked 10 new controllers from 25 
applicants, and I know that eight of the 10 won't take the job unless they get 
the extra 20% pay incentive." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said the FAA remodeled the employee lounge at the facility 2 years ago, 
but the NTSB still found it intolerably small. 
</P>
<P>
Now, said Moore, the FAA is planning to install a 24-by-60-foot trailer next to 
the existing facility, to be used as an employee lounge and for two small 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
Said Moore: "It's better than nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Mandatory overtime remains a problem, although it is not as bad as it was a 
year ago, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't get me wrong. Overtime is great for the paycheck," he said. "But it's 
rough on family life."

<HL> Collision Course? 'Satellite' Fields
Seen Less Safe Than Major Airports

<TEXT>
   Russell Kelsey is in charge of air-traffic safety at California's Ontario Airport. 
He says it's safer to fly elsewhere. 

   The reason: Last year, eight near midair collisions were reported at Ontario, a "satellite" airport 45 miles east of giant Los Angeles International Airport. 
In the past two years, two United Airlines jets nearly collided with helicopters at Ontario. 
An Alaska Airlines flight dodged a glider. 
And a Delta jet came within 150 feet of a hot-air balloon. 

   The scare factor is far worse at satellite airports than at major airports, say pilots and air-traffic controllers. 
Satellites -- secondary facilities in or near big cities -- are becoming increasingly popular, partly for their convenience. 
But a review of Federal Aviation Administration reports shows that each of eight leading satellite airports had more near collisions in 1986 than its closest major airport. 

   In Chicago, for example, there were nine reported near misses around Midway Airport, compared with four at O'Hare International Airport -- even though O'Hare handles three times more traffic. 
One Midway Airlines pilot who had a near collision with a small plane recalls seeing "the startled look on the other guy's face." 

   "What's it like to fly these airports?" asks D.B. Robinson, a United pilot for 22 years. 
"Let's put it this way: We're just damn lucky." 

   Satellite airports harbor a greater potential for accidents because they are used more by general-aviation aircraft, which are mostly small planes and helicopters. 
The pilots of these aircraft are often less skilled than their commercial counterparts; some are just learning to fly. 
Also, many of the satellites are close to other airports, which launch still more small planes into the sky. 
And air-traffic control at satellites is limited. 
For example, within 30 seconds of takeoff from Ontario, most flights leave regulated airspace -- the territory where all aircraft must be in contact with controllers. 

   "The environment is more protected at major airports," says Dick Russell, a Los Angeles-area safety coordinator for the Air Line Pilots Association. 
"At satellites, it's every man for himself." 

   FAA officials don't deny that there are differences in safety between satellite and major airports. 
Even so, they insist, satellites are safe. 
They say that both near and actual collisions are extremely rare at satellites. 
And they add that a near collision isn't always dangerous, because pilots have varying standards for declaring one. 

   Many pilots, though, say there have been too many close calls at satellites. 
Keith Sleater, a Frontier Airlines pilot, sweated through three near collisions in four months last year at John Wayne Airport in Santa Ana, Calif., outside Los Angeles. 
In an FAA report, he concluded: "In my opinion, a disaster at (John Wayne) is not only possible, it is likely." 
In an anonymous report after another near miss, a pilot said safety must be improved at California's Burbank Airport "quickly before someone gets killed." 

   Such concerns weren't common a few years ago because airlines didn't fly much to satellite airports. 
But crowding at major airports has stirred a traffic boom at the satellites. 
Commercial takeoffs and landings at John Wayne swelled 48% in 1986. 
Continental Airlines moved into Houston's Hobby Airport last year, and yesterday United started service at Midway, where 1986 passenger volume jumped almost a third to 3.9 million. 
Travelers welcome the trend; most satellites are either closer to downtown or have fewer parking and baggage hassles than major airports. 

   As airlines have moved into satellite fields, though, they've run afoul of general-aviation aircraft. 
Such planes are common at satellites partly because at such fields they don't face the hefty landing fees levied at most big airports. 
So while general aviation comprises only 9% of the traffic at San Francisco International Airport, it represents more than two-thirds of the traffic at nearby Oakland International. 

   Oakland and other satellites try to segregate general aviation from commercial aircraft, partly by assigning them to separate runways. 
But the system doesn't always work -- because, controllers say, general-aviation pilots are prone to mistakes. 
In late 1985, the pilot of a small private plane got lost taxiing in the dark at San Jose International Airport. 
The plane wound up on the wrong runway, forcing a Trans World Airlines jet to abort a landing. 
The small-plane's pilot, who had never before used the airport, discovered that he was on the wrong runway only when the TWA jet's landing lights showed up in his rear-view mirror. 

   An AirCal 737 had to abort a landing in February 1986 at John Wayne because a small plane practicing a landing overshot its runway and tried to touch down on another landing strip. 
"He came right in front of us," recalls AirCal pilot Stephen Telepman. 
"You'd think they wouldn't let amateurs fly around big jets, but they do. 
It's goofy." 

   Many pilots are also disturbed by the air-traffic control system at satellites. 
Planes within 25 to 30 miles of most major airports are required at certain altitudes to contact controllers and to use devices that make them easy to spot on radar. 
But regulated airspace at Long Beach Airport and San Jose, as set by the FAA, extends only five miles for flights heading south. 
Small planes beyond these ranges don't have to contact the towers, so controllers must spot them on radar and pilots must keep a close watch. 

   FAA officials say the system, while not ideal, works. 
"If there was a problem, the safety record wouldn't be so good," says Robert Hughes, an FAA traffic operations specialist. 
But pilots say they sometimes have only seconds to react after spotting a small plane, and controllers complain that radar screens at satellites are flooded with traffic from surrounding airports. 

   Burbank Airport, for example, is only six miles from Van Nuys Airport, the nation's busiest general-aviation facility. 
Two big general-aviation fields, a naval air base and a public airport with heavy glider activity are within 15 miles of San Jose. 
"You've got all these planes that can come from anywhere and that you're not talking to," says Joseph Bellino, an official in Chicago for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. 

   Ground facilities also are less safe at the satellites than at major airports, many pilots say. 
Most satellites, built decades ago, lack modern runway layouts. 
At Long Beach Airport, all five runways intersect; at Los Angeles International, none do. 
Burbank's longest runway is 6,900 feet, compared with 12,000 feet at Los Angeles. 
Burbank's 55-year-old passenger terminal is only about 110 yards from one runway -- half the distance the FAA prefers. 

   "You're putting modern-day jets in World War II airports," says John Galipault, president of the Aviation Safety Institute, a private Worthington, Ohio-based group that investigates air-safety issues. 

   Still, the FAA has upgraded navigational equipment at some satellites. 
It recently expanded the regulated airspace at Hobby, plans to do so this month at Oakland, and is considering similar moves at Midway and San Jose. 
But the agency moves slowly in such matters; it first considered widening the regulated airspace at San Jose eight years ago. 

   What's more, FAA officials don't agree on how to handle general aviation at satellites. 
Keith Potts, FAA associate administrator for air traffic, maintains that small-airplane owners have every right to fly out of satellites. 
"Those people paid the taxes to build those airports," he says. 

   Some officials, however, say smaller planes should eventually be banned from satellites. 
"I know a doctor who likes to be able to hop in a plane and fly whenever he wants," says Gerald Walton, an FAA official who until recently was the tower manager at Burbank. 
"But I'm not sure the general public is best served by that."

GOVERNOR VETOES COUNTY AIRPORTS' EXEMPTION FROM TOUGH LAND-USE LAW

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian on Tuesday rejected legislation that would have exempted 
Los Angeles County airports -- including Palmdale, Burbank and Van Nuys -- from 
a law designed to control growth around the state's airports. 
</P>
<P>
Under current law, Los Angeles County planners have until 1992 to fashion 
comprehensive land-use plans to ensure that commercial and residential 
developments are compatible with flight safety and noise control regulations 
around the county's 15 airports. 
</P>
<P>
"Without such planning, airports and the businesses surrounding them may be 
forced to close as development encroaches" because the increasing population 
would put the airports in violation of state law, Deukmejian said in vetoing 
the exemption bill. 
</P>
<P>
The governor said he does not believe "that the county should be completely 
exempted from provisions of this act, which will assist in preserving necessary 
airport facilities." 
</P>
<P>
The governor's action is the latest twist in a controversy that surfaced in 
1989 after Deukmejian signed a bill to put teeth into a 20-year-old requirement 
for land-use planning around airports statewide. That measure prompted an 
outcry from a number of Los Angeles County cities, which complained that their 
planning authority around airports would be usurped by the county. 
</P>
<P>
The exemption proposal was introduced by state Sen. Robert Beverly (R-Manhattan 
Beach), who earlier this year successfully pushed through legislation to give 
Los Angeles County an extra six months to comply with the law. But Deukmejian 
said he would not allow the law to be eased any more. 
</P>
<P>
Clancy Leland -- a lobbyist for Los Angeles County, which pushed for passage of 
the exemption measure -- said he was unsure if the exemption proposal will be 
revived next year. 
</P>
<P>
Leland described the current law as "so vague, so general, it doesn't tell you 
what you are supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
Other critics of the current law have argued that Los Angeles County's Regional 
Planning Commission, designated by state law as the airport planning agency, 
does not have the staff to handle the workload involved in planning around 
airports. Other opponents say that most airports in Los Angeles County already 
are surrounded by development. 
</P>
<P>
But Ann Blue, a lobbyist for the city of Los Angeles, said the governor's 
action means "that the county will have to take on the responsibility of doing 
land-use plans around airports." She said the city opposed the Beverly bill 
because in many cases, including Palmdale, residential development already is 
coming too close to airports and preventive action is needed soon. 
</P>
<P>
One source familiar with the legislation predicted that Los Angeles County 
cities, worried that the county will begin to control local zoning decisions 
around airports, will go to court to challenge the constitutionality of the 
current law and regain power over airport planning for itself.

<P>
Persistent dense fog continued to hamper operations at John Wayne Airport this 
morning, causing the cancellation of one flight and the rerouting of several 
others after the airport was shut down at 6:45 p.m. last night because of poor 
visibility. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest Airlines Flight 112 scheduled to depart at 6:50 a.m. today for 
Minneapolis was canceled, according to an airline spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers were taken to Los Angeles International for a substitute flight, the 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Ticket agents and John Wayne Airport officials reported at least three other 
flight interruptions today. A number of flights were delayed last night, 
according to airport officials. 
</P>
<P>
One incoming American Airlines flight from Oakland was diverted today and its 
passengers bused into Orange County, said Gail McKinzie, assistant manager for 
airport information at John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
Delta Airlines officials reported that one flight from Tampa, Fla., had to land 
in San Diego this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Two Northwest Airlines flights -- one from Seattle and the other from Minnesota 
-- had to be rerouted to airports in San Diego and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Fowler, manager of the tower at John Wayne, said visibility "went below 
flight minimums for arrivals and departures." 
</P>
<P>
An airport official said he expected the fog to lessen this afternoon and 
Friday. He said flight operations will continue to be "hairy" and noted that 
rain predicted for Friday should help dissipate the fog.

<TEXT>     The smaller aircraft, carrying 12 people, was believed to be was trapped
beneath the wreckage of the larger jetliner, which carried 89.;    Los Angeles
television station helicopters circled the scene, bathing the charred wreckage
in searchlights and showing the scene live to television viewers across the
nation.;    USAir Flight 1493, a Boeing 737-300 twin-engine jet, had flown
from Columbus, Ohio, and was scheduled to continue to San Francisco.;    Seven
people with tickets to San Francisco were on the flight when it crashed, and
many more had been scheduled to board in Los Angeles. It was not immediately
known whether any of those who died was from the Bay Area.;    The jetliner
skidded off the runway, across a taxiway, slammed into an abandoned airport
fire station and burst into flames.;    Its nose was shattered, a huge hole
opened on top of the forward section, and the fuselage broke apart ahead of
the tail section. Black smoke and orange flames boiled out of the windows and
ragged holes in the wreckage.;    "I saw a flash, then this streak of flames
going down the runway. There were people jumping from the front and back of
the plane," said nearby resident Gretchen Emig.;    Claudia Hawkins was
pulling her airport shuttle bus, full of passengers, into the parking lot when
the flash appeared in the sky.;    In unison, it seemed, the dozen of them
yelled, "Look!";    "It was a ball of fire," Hawkins recounted. "One young man
said he thought for sure he saw the tail end of a plane fall off. First thing
everybody thought was, it was a bomb. What else are you supposed to think?";  
 Wartime security is in force at the airport, as at others across the country.
But an FBI spokesman said that there was no evidence of terrorism in the
crash.;    Jeff Rich, an investigator with the National Transportation Safety
Board, said 10 passengers and two crew members were aboard the commuter plane,
Skywest Flight 5569, which was leaving for Palmdale, about 50 miles northeast
of Los Angeles airport.;    The craft, a twin turbo-prop Fairchild Metroliner,
has two pilots and can carry 19 passengers.;    USAir officials said the
Boeing 737-300 carried 83 passengers and a crew of six -- two pilots and four
flight attendants. It had seats for 128 passengers.;    The flight originated
in Syracuse, N.Y., made stops in Washington, D.C., and Columbus, Ohio, and was
scheduled to arrive in Los Angeles at 6:11 p.m. It was to continue to San
Francisco International Airport at 7 p.m., arriving at 8:15 p.m.;    The crash
occurred after dark, as the USAir jet was landing on Runway 24 Left, the
closest of two runways on the north side of the sprawling Los Angeles airport.
Los Angeles has two more runways on the south side of the terminal complex.;  
 It was not yet determined whether the planes collided on the ground or in the
air, nor which aircraft had air traffic controllers' clearance to be on the
runway.;    A man living near the airport told CNN he watched the crash
aftermath through a telescope and saw at least three passengers escape through
the USAir craft's rear door before the exit was engulfed in flames and dense
black smoke.;    Eleven fire engines sped toward the wreckage and extinguished
the flames with firefighting foam.;    Ambulances rushed the victims to
several nearby hospitals, and a special burn unit was put on standby at the
Sherman Oaks Community Hospital in the San Fernando Valley, more than 20 miles
to the north.;    Federal safety experts have been worried about runway
collisions for several years. Last fall, the National Transportation Safety
Board put the problem on its "most wanted" list.;    The worst accident in
aviation history was a 1977 runway collision between two jetliners in fog at
Tenerife in the Canary Islands that killed 582 people.;    The latest
available figures on runway incidents nationwide showed 382 in 1987 -- cases
in which airplanes taxied onto runways without instructions or crews became
confused -- and 190 in 1988. Officials say incidents have been increasing
since then.;    The safety board turned its attention to runway problems after
three near-collisions on runways between June 1978 and February 1979.;    But
board members said many of their runway recommendations made after a collision
of two airliners in Detroit in December killed eight people had never been
carried out.;    The safety board investigates all major transportation
accidents and makes recommendations to avoid repetitions. But it has no power
to require the FAA or the airlines to take action.;     PASSENGER INFORMATION;
Information about passengers on the two planes involved in the crash is
available from USAir and Skywest.;    To obtain information about USAir Flight
1493, call (213) 485-5383.;    For information about the passengers on the
Skywest Flight 5569, phone (800) 654-8041.;     DIAGRAM: Ron Coddington,

flaming USAir flight, a Boeing 737-300, spiraled into an abandoned fire
station and shattered along the runway, apparently crashing on top of Skywest
commuter flight 5569 as it prepared to take off.; Witnesses say the USAir jet
split in two parts after the crash. Plane was engulfed in flames.; Unconfirmed

MOVE EL TORO, TUSTIN MARINE STATIONS TO GEORGE AIR FORCE BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whether we really need an international airport in Orange County, a better idea 
for the use of George Air Force Base would be to relocate both Tustin and El 
Toro to that location. 
</P>
<P>
For the same reasons that the other proposed sites are not suitable, it makes 
no sense for these military air bases to be located in urban Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Ask yourself if anyone in his right mind would consider establishing these air 
bases in their present locations at this time. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in view of the impending cutbacks of military operations, the desire of 
the residents near George to continue its operation, the more appropriate 
environmental and safety conditions there, and the minuscule economic impact on 
us here of eliminating El Toro and Tustin, let's do it. 
</P>
<P>
As for high-speed trains, why not use them to connect John Wayne and Los 
Angeles International Airport and downtown Los Angeles, where we'd get 
coordinated benefits other than a faster means to deposit money with the 
ganglords in Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
As for what to do with El Toro and Tustin, how about national parks and/or a 
bird refuge and/or the agricultural operations they replaced originally that 
could absorb some of the greenhouse gases created in overdeveloped Orange 
County?

SHOWERS EXPECTED TO WASH AWAY DENSE FOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY MARCANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An approaching weekend storm is expected to replace the dense fog that has 
shrouded Orange County in recent days and forced the closure of John Wayne 
Airport, stranding scores of travelers because of canceled flights. 
</P>
<P>
The fog was thickest Wednesday night, when John Wayne Airport was shut down 
from 6:45 to 10:45 p.m., said Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Elly 
Brekke. 
</P>
<P>
Fog-related problems at the airport continued Thursday morning, when one flight 
was canceled and three others were rerouted, according to airline officials. 
But by Thursday night, operations were back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
But a series of Pacific storms lined up in the Gulf of Alaska is expected to 
begin sweeping across California, bringing a 30% chance of rain to Orange 
County today and a 60% chance on Saturday with windy conditions. Rain also is 
likely on Sunday, both here and in San Francisco, where the Los Angeles Rams 
meet the San Francisco 49ers for the National Football Conference championship. 
The wet weather will continue into early next week, forecasters say. 
</P>
<P>
"It does look like we could get some real rain," said Rick Dittmann, a 
meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
While the weekend storm could cause new travel delays, the promise of 
measurable rain would be a welcome relief to parched Orange County, 
experiencing its fourth straight winter of below-average rainfall. Total 
rainfall for the county since July is 1.04 inches, a third below normal, 
WeatherData officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Dittmann said a changing weather pattern is the result of a developing onshore 
flow that should blow away the dense fog that has plagued the area. 
</P>
<P>
Early Thursday, Northwest Airlines reported that its 6:50 a.m. flight to 
Minneapolis was canceled because of low visibility. An airline spokeswoman said 
passengers were taken by shuttle bus to Los Angeles International Airport and 
placed aboard another Minnesota-bound flight. 
</P>
<P>
Three other early-morning flights scheduled to land at John Wayne Airport were 
rerouted. A Northwest flight from Seattle and a Delta Airlines flight from 
Tampa, Fla., were diverted to San Diego's Lindbergh Field, while an American 
Airlines flight from Oakland landed at Ontario International Airport, where 
passengers boarded buses and were driven to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
A total of eight flights bound for John Wayne, including five Wednesday night, 
were diverted because of fog to other Southern California airports over a 
two-day period. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Edwards, a spokeswoman for John Wayne Airport, said federal 
regulations prohibit planes from landing if visibility is less than half a 
mile, and from taking off if visibility is below a quarter-mile and passengers 
are on board. 
</P>
<P>
Most passengers who were stranded at John Wayne early Thursday appeared to take 
the delays in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"I got to read the newspaper for once and relax," said Beverly Richards, who 
was booked aboard an early-morning Northwest Airlines flight to the Bay Area. 
"I would have had to go to work when I got home, anyway. I don't mind missing 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Richards, who had been attending a convention in Orange County, eventually got 
on a northbound flight that departed John Wayne at 11:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Bauer, a Costa Mesa resident who was on his way back to his Navy post in 
Jacksonville, Fla., said he was among the lucky passengers who got advance 
warning of delays and managed to make other travel arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer was booked to leave from John Wayne Airport early Thursday morning, but 
changed his plans and left at 11:30 a.m. aboard an America West flight to Los 
Angeles, where he caught a connecting flight to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"It was no big deal," Bauer said. "At least I didn't have to be here early . . 
. and wait around." 
</P>
<P>
Fog-related delays were also reported at Long Beach Airport, where three 
flights were canceled Thursday morning because of near-zero visibility. The fog 
also grounded state helicopters scheduled to spray the pesticide malathion 
Wednesday night over several San Gabriel Valley communities infested with the 
Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
While aerial operations were sharply affected by the fog, the weather problems 
apparently did not hamper motorists. The California Highway Patrol reported no 
fog-related traffic problems in Orange County on Wednesday night or early 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Dittmann said the soupy fog that has blanketed the coastline and extended up to 
10 miles inland was caused by a combination of a low marine layer and a belt of 
low-lying warm air. 
</P>
<P>
"With a shallow marine layer and an inversion (a warm air mass) of around 2,000 
or 3,000 feet, you're going to get a squashed layer of clouds that goes down to 
the surface," Dittmann said. 
</P>
<P>
The fog was so thick in spots that temperatures varied by as much as 20 degrees 
in areas of the Los Angeles basin Wednesday, Dittmann said.

$500,000 VIOLIN STILL MISSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times wire services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $500,000 Stradivarius violin owned by violinist Erich Gruenberg remains 
missing today after disappearing from an airport baggage cart at Los Angeles 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"The violin is still outstanding and we have no suspects at this time," 
detective Jerry Sparks said. 
</P>
<P>
Gruenberg, 65, was carrying the violin, crafted in 1731, as he checked through 
customs at Los Angeles International Airport on Tuesday, Sparks said. 
</P>
<P>
But Gruenberg noticed that the violin was missing from the baggage cart 
"somewhere along the way" to ground transportation, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
Thefts at the airport are common, but in this case the thief may not have 
realized the cart was carrying a Stradivarius. 
</P>
<P>
The instrument was insured for about $500,000. Also stolen was a violin worth 
$8,000 and two bows worth $3,500.

FUTURISTIC, HIGH-SPEED L.A.-PALMDALE TRAIN CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A private partnership is considering submitting a bid to build a 280 m.p.h. 
magnetic-levitation train system from Los Angeles International Airport through 
the San Fernando Valley to Palmdale, serving commuters, airport-bound travelers 
and gamblers headed to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The futuristic line, which would be built along the San Diego, Golden State and 
Antelope Valley freeways, was endorsed Thursday by Los Angeles Mayor Tom 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley press spokesman Bill Chandler said the mayor views the proposed line as 
a "means to allow thousands and thousands of commuters on the congested 405 and 
14 freeways to utilize rail transit." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal also could save the city's long-shot bid to be connected to a 
proposed Las Vegas-to-Anaheim magnetic-levitation system, said Clifton Moore, 
general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Airports. 
</P>
<P>
"This sounds like what we have been waiting for -- a way to open up Palmdale 
Airport," Moore said, adding that he will urge the city Board of Aiport 
Commissioners to endorse the plan at its meeting Wednesday because it offers 
long-sought relief for congestion at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
But submission of the proposal, which faces formidable financial, technological 
and political hurdles, is "far from a sure thing," said a top executive at 
Perini Corp., the Framingham, Mass.-based construction firm that heads the 
consortium studying whether to submit a bid for a 65-mile LAX-to-Palmdale line. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was developed in response to a state program to encourage private 
construction of transportation facilities approved by the Legislature last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators authorized the state Department of Transportation to select up to 
four projects in which commercial firms would build and operate highways, 
tunnels, bridges or rail lines. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans, which will provide the right of way without charge, will own the 
projects but the firms building them will lease back the facilities for up to 
35 years and will keep all tolls or fees. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Caltrans selected nine companies and partnerships it deemed 
qualified to make bids. The selections included Perini and several other major 
construction firms. 
</P>
<P>
Proposals are due Aug. 1 and Caltrans expects to select the top four candidates 
by Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Cygan, Perini's manager of product development, said Thursday that the 
consortium is "withholding a decision to submit or not submit until the last 
minute." 
</P>
<P>
He said no ridership studies have been completed. But he said his firm has 
concluded that "three types of riders would use the line in significant 
numbers." These were identified as work-bound commuters, those headed to LAX or 
Palmdale Airport and those transferring flights from one airport to another, 
and travelers to and from Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The Las Vegas passengers would transfer in Palmdale to trains on the 41-mile 
Victor Valley-to-Palmdale spur off the proposed 265-mile Las Vegas-to-Anaheim 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Bechtel Corp. heads a consortium that on Monday proposed building a $5-billion 
magnetic-levitation line between the gambling mecca and Orange County that 
would largely follow the right of way of Interstate 15. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is being evaluated by the California-Nevada Super Speed Train 
Commission. The commission was created by the legislatures in the two states to 
stimulate construction by a private firm of such a line by offering the right 
of way without charge. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials, including Bradley, expressed disappointment the Bechtel 
proposal gave a low priority to the Palmdale spur, which they view as the key 
to expanded use of Palmdale Airport. 
</P>
<P>
At speeds up to 280 m.p.h., the Las Vegas-Anaheim trip would take little more 
than an hour, Bechtel officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Bechtel envisions using magnetic-levitation technology now being tested on a 
20-mile track in West Germany. That technology, however, has not entered 
commercial service. 
</P>
<P>
Magnetic-levitation systems use a magnetic field to propel trains forward and 
to elevate them one to four inches above an elevated guideway. 
</P>
<P>
Bechtel officials say a magnetic-levitation train at 250 m.p.h. generates less 
noise than a single automobile at freeway speed. 
</P>
<P>
Perini's Cygan said his firm and partners Daniel, Mann, Johnson &amp; 
Mendenhall have not decided whether to use German or Japanese 
magnetic-levitation technology, but that they "have pretty much ruled out 
monorail, light-rail and heavy rail. Those just don't have the speed or 
environmental benefits of mag-lev."

COMPLIANCE: LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICIALS CONTEND LAW TO CONTROL BUILDING TOO

<TEXT>
<P>
For years, many local governments in California have ignored a 1970 law that 
requires detailed land-use plans around large airports. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the law was broadened in 1984 to include most of the state's 
airports, many local governments failed to comply. 
</P>
<P>
But now, legislative staffers and airport officials say, a new law that puts 
teeth into the earlier statutes could curb development of hotels, homes and 
industrial parks around such airports as Los Angeles International and San 
Diego's Lindbergh Field, where no plans have been completed. 
</P>
<P>
State transportation officials estimate that plans have been completed for only 
57% of the state's 269 airports. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the poor compliance record, state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) 
last summer easily won passage of a bill -- which becomes law Jan. 1 -- to add 
a significant new step to ensure that developments are compatible with 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, if an airport does not have a plan, most construction projects 
-- possibly as far away as 2 miles from airports -- will need approval from 
county airport land-use commissions as well as local governments. 
</P>
<P>
The developments still could get the green light but "only under very limited 
conditions" until comprehensive land-use plans are finished, according to a 
fact sheet on the law prepared by Bergeson's Senate Local Government Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The law sets a June 30, 1991 deadline for completion of the master plans. But 
Los Angeles County officials are questioning whether the law applies to them 
because of vague wording -- an assertion disputed by Bergeson. 
</P>
<P>
Legislative aides said the 1970 law directed the Regional Planning Commission 
to conduct the airport land-use study for Los Angeles County. But county 
officials say the section of the law that applies just to Los Angeles may be so 
vague that it exempts the county. 
</P>
<P>
A clarifying opinion may be sought from Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, said 
John Huttinger, a planner with the Los Angeles County Regional Planning 
Commission. But in the meantime, Huttinger said, he making plans to enforce the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe the Legislature decided that the largest county in the state 
should be exempt from this law," said Fred Stewart, who oversees planning for 
Caltrans' aeronautics division. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson said she was surprised by the county's reaction, maintaining that such 
questions were not raised during legislative hearings. It's "rather bewildering 
that would occur now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Not complying with the law has resulted in the "erection of skyscrapers, radio 
towers and other tall structures in dangerously close proximity to our 
airports," according to Mark Pisano, executive director of the Southern 
California Assn. of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy (R-Monrovia), a pilot who supported the Bergeson 
law, said it was long overdue because cities "continue to let this rapid 
development go unchecked around these airports." 
</P>
<P>
The law has airport managers and planners scrambling to determine its impact on 
commercial growth. 
</P>
<P>
No plans have been completed for any of the 16 airports in Los Angeles County, 
according to state transportation officials. As a result, airport managers in 
the county predict some construction delays, but say it is too early to tell 
whether the law will affect any major projects -- such as a 400-acre 
development on the north side of LAX. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not prepared to tell you now whether we have a problem or not," said Bill 
Schoenfeld, deputy executive director of the Los Angeles Department of 
Airports. 
</P>
<P>
At John Wayne Airport in Orange County, a plan has been completed, so officials 
say that the county's airport land-use commission will not get final authority 
to make planning decisions there. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, a study of Lindbergh Field has not been completed, according to 
Jack Koerper, special projects director for the San Diego Assn. of Governments, 
which has responsibility for the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Koerper could not say what projects around Lindbergh Field might be affected. 
Earlier this year, the San Diego City Council approved construction of a 
10-story office building 80 feet north of the approach corridor -- a proposal 
that aroused concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Planners in Los Angeles County suggested that most airports in the county are 
in heavily urbanized areas and won't be affected. However, they said that among 
the developments that could be affected are a controversial proposal to build 
52 homes and an office building under the departure pattern at Torrance 
Municipal Airport and the possible addition of high-rises in Century City under 
the Santa Monica Airport flight path. 
</P>
<P>
At a minimum, the new law is expected to delay projects around airports. "The 
potential is certainly there for an overwhelming change" in the way airport 
hotels, industrial parks and other commercial structures are approved, 
Huttinger said. 
</P>
<P>
While the law is vague on the area for which a plan must be completed, 
Bergeson's committee says it would be within a 2-mile radius of airports. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, the Legislature began wrestling with the issue of growth around 
airports as land was gobbled up for homes, hotels and other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
By 1970, it required land-use studies around large airports with commercial 
service. That requirement was extended to most of the state's general aviation 
airports in 1984. But many counties ignored it, citing a lack of funds and a 
failure of the Legislature to provide a deadline for compliance. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Van de Kamp's office said the only way to force the adoption of 
land-use plans would be a lawsuit to stop all development near an airport until 
local officials complied with the law. 
</P>
<P>
Under Bergeson's law such lawsuits could not be filed until land-use plans are 
adopted or until June 30, 1991, when the law mandates that such plans be 
completed.

ONLY WEALTHY CAN AFFORD THE FARES AT JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that all the hoopla for the Orange County airport has died down, let's stop 
and realize that this airport is basically just for the rich. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, four friends and I decided to spend a weekend in Scottsdale. 
</P>
<P>
Flights from Ontario, Long Beach and Los Angeles airports averaged between $48 
and $68. The same flight out of Orange County was $220. Moreover, the cost of 
overnight parking is ridiculously high. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, my friends and I will be driving past John Wayne Airport on 
our way to Los Angeles International Airport (and adding to the rush-hour 
gridlock) because the air fares are too high for us middle-class peons. 
</P>
<P>
Another thought. All the executives in my office demand that we secretaries 
book their flights out of John Wayne Airport when they are traveling for 
company business. 
</P>
<P>
However, when these same executives are planning their vacations and thus every 
nickel is their own, they make sure their flights are out of any airport but 
Orange County.

2ND AIRLINE TO BEGIN SERVICE TO PALMDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Skywest Airlines will become the second carrier to serve Palmdale Regional 
Airport, flying five round trips a day to Los Angeles International Airport 
starting June 1, the airline announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement by Skywest -- a feeder service for Delta Airlines -- follows 
the start Jan. 2 of service by America West Airlines. America West's four daily 
round trips between Palmdale and Las Vegas ended a five-year absence of air 
service from the Palmdale airport, which is operated by the city of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Skywest plans to use 19-passenger Fairchild Metro III turboprop planes for the 
30-minute flights to LAX. 
</P>
<P>
"We just thought the time was right to establish a link between Palmdale and 
Los Angeles," said Steve Hart, Skywest's director of market planning. 
"Obviously having America West reestablish service there will help us. We sort 
of hope to run on their coattails," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Skywest officials said they saw a market in the Antelope Valley, with its 
fast-growing population of about 200,000 and concentration of military and 
aerospace businesses. Airport officials, however, said both carriers' services 
mainly strive to capture passengers for their connecting flights. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Board of Airport Commissioners is scheduled to meet in 
Palmdale on Wednesday to approve a five-year lease for Skywest. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Department of Airports officials applauded Skywest's decision as a 
step toward development of Palmdale's airport. But they also said they had 
hoped the next carrier at Palmdale would have avoided feeding already-crowded 
LAX. 
</P>
<P>
Skywest, which carried about 1 million passengers last year, serves 43 cities 
in eight Western states. The introductory Palmdale-LAX round trip fare will be 
$98. But airline officials said they expect most of their passengers to catch 
Delta flights at LAX, entitling them to pay little or nothing for the 
connecting flight beyond the price of the Delta ticket.

<HEAD>Probe: How Did Mental Patient Smuggle Gun, Knives Aboard Jet?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While a Cuban exile awaited a court appearance in
the attempted hijack of an American Airlines jet, authorities tried
to figure out how he smuggled a starter gun and two knives on the
plane.
   Pedro Rene Comas-Benos, an escaped mental patient wearing green
military fatigues and a bomber-style jacket, was able to elude
X-ray machines and other security Saturday at Los Angeles
International Airport, considered one of the nation's most secure.
   ``He boarded Flight 30 in Los Angeles and that's where we should
have caught him,'' Ed Martelle, American Airlines spokesman said
Saturday from the company's headquarters in Dallas.
   ``We're very concerned about it because up to this point Los
Angeles has been our best security section,'' Martelle said. ``So,
as a starting point we have to look at if it was possible for him
to get by our screeners without them noticing.''
   Comas-Banos, 37, flew the first leg of his journey to Dallas,
then transferred to a Miami-bound flight that he allegedly tried to
hijack.
   ``After the flight left the ground on its way to Miami, he
produced a demand note and said he wanted to be taken to Havana,''
said FBI agent William Gavin.
   The Boeing 727 with 157 people aboard attempted to head toward
Cuba, but came back to Miami after the pilot told Comas-Banos the
jet was running out of fuel.
   Speaking Spanish, Comas-Banos told the flight crew he was
carrying a bomb in a duffel bag that actually contained the gun
used to start track races, two small knives and a pair of scissors.
   Ninety minutes after Flight 1098 parked in a remote corner of
Miami International Airport, Comas-Banos allowed children to leave
the jet and then collapsed in front of authorities.
   Comas-Banos was charged with air piracy and was jailed at the
federal Metropolitan Correctional Center south of Miami pending a
magistrate's hearing Tuesday. He faces a maximum penalty of life in
prison if convicted, Gavin said.
   Security at Los Angeles International was tightened in December
1987 after David Burke, a recently fired USAir employee, boarded a
Pacific Southwest Airlines jet and opened fire in the cabin and
cockpit.
   The jet bound for San Francisco from Los Angeles plummeted to
earth, killing all 43 people aboard.
   Among new measures taken since that tragedy, employees with
airline badges, including pilots, were ordered to pass through
metal detectors and have their luggage X-rayed like everyone else.
   Martelle said it wasn't immediately known how Comas bypassed
security.
   Although a starter's pistol would not be allowed in carry-on
luggage under any circumstances, pocket knives and scissors would
not automatically be considered weapons, he said.
   Comas-Banos had come to Los Angeles, where he lived on the
streets, after escaping from St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington,
D.C., where John Hinckley, who attempted to assassinate President
Reagan in 1981, is held. Comas-Banos was there from 1980 to 1982.
   Comas-Banos reportedly has a son in Cuba and had wanted to
return to his homeland.

TRAVELERS PAY THE PRICE FOR O.C. AIRPORT'S CONVENIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Gary Lavender were just an occasional air traveler, he might not be too 
concerned about the extra bucks that he has to shell out to use John Wayne 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
But as a sales manager who logs about 175,000 miles a year in the skies, the 
Mission Viejo resident has become a bit unnerved by the price gap between 
Orange County and other Southland airports -- so much so that he now flies out 
of other airports half the time just to keep within his business budget. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of times I don't fly out of John Wayne because I can get much more 
reasonable fares at LAX and some of the other airports," the 42-year-old 
Lavender said. "If I can save $75 to $100 on a road trip, I'll take the trouble 
to drive up to L.A. to catch a plane." 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts blame the sky-high fares at John Wayne on a range of forces -- 
the attraction of Orange County to business travelers who are willing to book 
flights first and ask questions later; a years-old environmental lawsuit that 
forced unusually severe flight restrictions, and the law of supply and demand. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that many of the thousands of local residents who will fly into 
and out of Orange County this Memorial Day weekend will do so with less money 
in their pockets -- sometimes much less. 
</P>
<P>
Data from the U.S. Department of Transportation reveals that for 12 of the 14 
major destinations across the nation, passengers at John Wayne pay higher 
average fares than their counterparts at the three other major airports in the 
area -- Los Angeles International, Long Beach and Ontario; for the remaining 
two destinations, Orange County is a close second. 
</P>
<P>
And while the four airports are separated by only a few dozen miles 
geographically, the gap in dollars can be dramatic: an average round-trip 
ticket to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, for example, 
would cost $156 more from John Wayne than from Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
"The demand is very high in Orange County, and the supply is just not there; we 
refer to it as our 'boutique market,' " said Dianne LaPorte, vice president of 
operations for the Santa Ana-based World Travel Bureau, which operates 17 area 
travel agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Even with all the current construction and parking problems to muddle through 
at the airport, she said, "the location is very convenient for all the local 
business people who are willing to pay whatever it takes to get there." 
</P>
<P>
People like Grant Lund. 
</P>
<P>
A J.C. Penney store manager in the Sacramento area who sometimes has to travel 
for business on short notice, Lund paid $315 for a round-trip flight into 
Orange County last week in order to attend a meeting in Buena Park. That's 
about the same price as he would have paid had he used Los Angeles 
International -- but $37 more than if he had used Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
"In my case, the expense isn't a factor" in using John Wayne, Lund said. "It's 
the convenience." 
</P>
<P>
Business people, often traveling on short notice through Orange County, are 
plentiful enough to ensure substantial profits for locally based airlines -- 
profits that some industry specialists suggest make the airport one of the most 
profitable in the nation. Local airport administrators say that perhaps 80% of 
their passengers are business travelers, compared to an average national rate 
of about 55%. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining casual fliers, however, saddled with the higher rates, may be out 
of luck -- or on the road to Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ridiculous," San Clemente resident Charles Hayden said of the ticket 
fares as he dragged a suitcase through construction zones at John Wayne this 
past week, just returned from a trip to Nashville with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden said he checked fares for the same trip out of Los Angeles -- and found 
that he could have saved $60. But in the end, he decided grudgingly that it 
wasn't worth the drive or the hassle. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's just something you have to put up with for the convenience," he 
grumbled. 
</P>
<P>
Not all agree. Consider Lavender, the sales manager from Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
The frequent flier says he used to fly to such spots as Chicago and New York 
City out of area airports other than John Wayne about a quarter of the time; 
now, combating what he sees as an increase in the Orange County gap in the last 
year, he seeks out other takeoff sites about half the time. 
</P>
<P>
That means a freeway trek of more than an hour from Mission Viejo to either 
Ontario or Long Beach, and sometimes more than two hours to Los Angeles 
International -- compared with about 25 minutes to John Wayne, Lavender says. 
But he added: "With those kinds of dollar differences, a lot of times it's 
worth the drive." 
</P>
<P>
No solid data is available on whether the gap between Orange County and the 
three other major area airports is actually growing. (The Burbank airport is a 
bit far even for most cost-conscious travelers.) Some industry officials do 
say, however, that they seem to be seeing more casual fliers seeking out other 
airports rather than paying the extra money. 
</P>
<P>
"The leisurely traveler who's looking for the best price seems to be giving 
more consideration now to traveling out of Ontario or Los Angeles," said 
LaPorte, the travel agency executive. 
</P>
<P>
Added Jack Keady, regional marketing manager for American Airlines: "We've 
discovered that people will travel enormous distances to save what for us would 
be considered small amounts of money." 
</P>
<P>
Industry specialists such as John Wayne Airport Manager George Rebella suggest 
that the ongoing airport expansion -- now mired in controversy by cost overruns 
and delays -- could help bring fares down by nearly doubling the site's annual 
passenger capacity to 8.4 million people. Another regional airport is also in 
the works but is still years away. 
</P>
<P>
But others, such as American Airlines' Keady, assert that there is such a 
terrific local demand among business travelers that, while there may be a 
temporary sag in fares as airport capacity expands, John Wayne prices would 
likely resume their place atop the local airports. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Beyond the heavy presence of local business travelers, industry officials 
say the price gap centers on years of litigation against the county by the city 
of Newport Beach and various citizen groups, resulting in a 1985 settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The litigants' complaints about noise and environmental concerns at the airport 
prompted a master plan, recently revised, that placed caps on the numbers of 
carriers, flights, passengers and noise levels, and also banned nighttime jet 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
"The Orange County airport is one of, if not the most, artificially constrained 
airports in the nation," said Roger Cohen of the Air Transport Assn. in 
Washington. "And the higher prices that you see are the clear result of those 
restrictions on access and capacity." 
</P>
<P>
To understand the restrictions at John Wayne, one need only consider that: 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, with a population of 2.3 million people, the number of annual 
passengers is capped at 4.6 million; by contrast, in Los Angeles, a county of 
8.8 million people, there were about 44 million passengers last year at its 
main airport -- or nearly 10 times as many fliers in a county just over three 
times as big. 
</P>
<P>
With those kind of supply-and-demand forces at work, officials say, airlines at 
John Wayne are essentially dealing from a stacked deck; because for every 
person resigned to making a trip to Long Beach or Ontario for a cheaper flight, 
there is likely someone right behind in line with bags packed and credit card 
drawn, willing to pay the price.

PALMDALE AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years Los Angeles city officials have talked about using the huge Palmdale 
Airport as an extension of Los Angeles International Airport. Since the city is 
predicting soaring LAX traffic (March 12), now is the time to put that facility 
to use. There could be an overhead monorail train running from LAX to Palmdale 
Airport to transport passengers, thus alleviating the traffic congestion and 
the presumed huge number of passengers expected by the year 2000. Such action 
would also increase employment and business in both areas.

   Airports in Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles stepped up
security Tuesday following Iran's vows to avenge the deaths of the
290 people in a jetliner shot down by an American warship.
   ``Our police and security people are very much aware of the
situation and and the potential for what could happen with talks of
retaliation,'' said Ron Wilson, spokesman at San Francisco
International Airport.
   ``We're sensitive to the Iranian incident and we've taken
immediate steps to increase our security posture,'' Dale Harris,
superintendent of operations at Los Angeles International Airport,
said Monday.
   Officials at airports in Atlanta, Baltimore, Miami, Oklahoma
City and Dallas-Fort Worth said no changes were made.
   Boston's Logan International Airport spokesman Phil Orlandella
said security was beefed up, but added ``It's stuff that probably
can't be seen.''
   Lynn Tierney, a spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey, which operates Kennedy, Newark and LaGuardia
airports in the New York metropolitan area, declined comment on
security.
   ``As in all matters involving security at our facilities, we
will not elaborate on specifics. However, the current situation is
being closely monitored with the appropriate authorities.''
   Bill Malone, spokesman for the Philadelphia International
Airport, also declined to comment on security.
   Cynthia-Val Jones, spokeswoman for the Chicago Department of
Aviation, said officials were stressing the need for ``extra
diligence'' but didn't plan to take any new security measures at
O'Hare International Airport.
   ``We're not adding any additional people. What we have done is
as different shifts come on we make sure that all our security
personnel are alert and aware of the threats and do their jobs with
extra diligence,'' she said Tuesday. ``They're keeping an eye out
for anything that might look suspicious.''
   Wilson said travelers in San Francisco might detect longer waits
at baggage-security points before boarding planes.
   ``More luggage will be opened and visually checked,'' Wilson
said. ``If there's anything that has the slightest question through
the X-ray machine, that person will be asked to open the bag and
let the monitor check it.''
   Airport police and security guards have been told to be extra
observant. But the number of security guards was not increased.
   No threats have been directed toward the airport, he said.
   Harris refused to reveal the extra precautions taken at Los
Angeles other than to say more personnel were on duty.
   ``We have increased our deployment and increased security
awareness or alertness,'' airport police Sgt. Karen Schultz said.
   Iran's ambassador to West Germany said Tuesday that retaliation
will not occur on U.S. soil for the downing of the Iran Air flight.
The 290 passengers and crew are presumed dead.
   Customs and border officials in Texas said they had not
tightened security because of Iran's threat.
   ``I do not know of any actions that have been taken because of
the plane being shot down,'' said Charles Conroy, Customs spokesman
in Houston.
   Doug Mosier, spokesman for the Border Patrol's El Paso sector,
said: ``To my knowledge, there's been no message relayed as to a
specific alert to be on the lookout for Iranian terrorists.''

   A United Airlines Boeing 737 jetliner with
107 people was unable to lock its right landing gear and skidded to
a safe emergency landing Tuesday, officials said.
   The jet's right main gear would not lock and the pilot set the
plane down at Los Angeles International on the nose gear, left main
gear and the engine under the right wing, said Federal Aviation
Administration spokesman Fred O'Donnell.
   The 102 passengers and five crew members slid down emergency
chutes, he said.
   Flight 1257 from Oakland was approaching
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport at 9 a.m. when a cockpit light
indicated an unsafe landing gear, O'Donnell said.
   The pilot made two low passes over the Burbank tower so
officials could see if the gear was extended, O'Donnell said. The
jet diverted to Los Angeles International.
   FAA and National Transportation Safety Board inspectors were
investigating.
   Passengers were bused to Burbank Airport, said United Airline
spokesman Alan Wayne.

<TEXT>
   A Pan American Boeing 737 airliner
made a precautionary landing at Long Beach Airport on Saturday
because smoke entered the cabin shortly after it took off from Los
Angeles International Airport, officials said.
   Flight 280 to San Diego, with 34 passengers and crew aboard,
landed safely at 7:38 a.m., said Alan Loflin, a Pan Am spokesman in
Dallas.
   There were no injuries and no damage to the plane, Loflin said.
   A small amount of smoke in the cabin was determined to come from
the ventilation system and was likely caused by some detergent that
may have gotten into a fan motor when the plane was cleaned Friday,
Loflin said.
   ``There was a presence of smoke in the cabin. It was definitely
not a smoke-filled cabin,'' Loflin said.
   The plane was scheduled to resume its flight to San Diego, he
said.
   A Federal Aviation Administration duty officer described the
landing as precautionary rather than an emergency. Loflin said
there was no emergency evacuation of the jet.
   Long Beach Airport is about 15 miles southeast of Los Angeles
International.

TRANSPORTATION: WEATHER ADDS TO THANKSGIVING TRAVEL WOES IN SOME AREAS OF 
NATION. THOUSANDS SUFFER DELAYS AT L.A. AIRPORT.

<P>
Passengers crowded Los Angeles International Airport and other airfields across 
the nation Wednesday evening as weather problems added to what had already been 
expected to be one of the worst holiday travel crunches on record. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of travelers trying to fly in or out of LAX were put on hold -- some 
for a few minutes, others for a few hours -- as some flights were delayed. 
</P>
<P>
By nightfall, automobile traffic around the airport was crawling, the airport's 
parking lots had started to overflow and the terminals were full, but the 
expected lines had yet to begin forming at terminal ticket counters, baggage 
carousels, restaurants, pay telephones and rest rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, it's not as bad as we thought it would be," said a clerk at an 
American Airlines reservations desk. 
</P>
<P>
Officials predicted that about 650,000 passengers would pass through the Los 
Angeles area's busiest airport during the four-day Thanksgiving weekend -- 
about 20,000 more than last year's all-time high. About 210,000 were expected 
just on Wednesday at Chicago's O'Hare, 50,000 more than normal. 
</P>
<P>
For some, the going was beginning to get tough by nightfall Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"My flight was supposed to leave 10 minutes ago," said Jeff Kurtzer, 22, a 
student at UC Santa Barbara, who was heading for a family reunion in Ft. 
Lauderdale and was worried about making a connection in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"My plane got in 20 minutes late," he said, gazing at the crowd gathering 
around the Delta Airlines boarding gate. "But (being Thanksgiving) I expected 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Fog in the Bay Area, the Sacramento Valley, Portland, Ore., and Salt Lake City 
and snow in the East and Midwest forced the cancellation of several flights 
Wednesday and prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to implement a 
nationwide air traffic quota system that caused delays of up to 2 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Hopkins, a spokesman for United Airlines in Chicago, said the delays along 
the West Coast were expected to intensify during the night as low clouds and 
fog moved inland from the Pacific over airports in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
FAA spokeswoman Ellie Brekke in Los Angeles said low overcast over Orange 
County could affect some flights at John Wayne Airport before dawn today. 
</P>
<P>
While the weather did not directly affect planes landing at and taking off from 
LAX, some flights in and out of the airport were held up because of traffic 
backups at other airports. 
</P>
<P>
For most of those along the West Coast, it was too late to switch to the train. 
Amtrak reported that many of its trains were booked to capacity, with 
reservations on this weekend's Seattle-to-San Francisco and Seattle-to-Chicago 
runs sold out two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Highway traffic was expectedly heavy in the Los Angeles area Wednesday when, as 
usual, most locals used their cars to leave town for the holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really bad -- we have advisories for heavy traffic all over," Officer 
Jill Angel, a spokeswoman for the California Highway Patrol, reported at 
sundown. 
</P>
<P>
"All the freeways are jammed," she said. "The San Bernardino Freeway is a mess, 
with everyone heading east, out of town. There's a major Sigalert where the 134 
(the Ventura Freeway) meets I-5 (the Golden State Freeway) because of an 
overturned big rig. There's just a tremendous increase in the volume of traffic 
everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
But the worst gridlock may have been in New York City, where more than a 
million cars -- 12% more than normal -- created an avalanche of traffic that 
officials say is becoming a Thanksgiving Eve ritual. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like lemmings marching to the sea," said Victor Ross, a spokesman for the 
New York Department of Transportation.

   Los Angeles Crash Inquiry Finds Factors
   That Complicated Air Controller's Task

   LOS ANGELES -- Investigators began giving details of a
series of problems that complicated the job of the
air-traffic controller who apparently permitted a USAir
jetliner to land on a runway occupied by a commuter plane
poised for takeoff Friday night.
   Meanwhile, the death toll from the collision climbed to
34, including all 12 aboard a SkyWest turboprop crushed under
the larger USAir 737.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   James Burnett, the National Transportation Safety Board
member who is acting as spokesman for the federal
investigation team, said it had found out of service a
ground-based radar system to assist Los Angeles International
Airport control-tower personnel in keeping track of traffic.
The system, called ASDE for airport surface detection
equipment, is one of only a dozen in place at the hundreds of
airports around the nation.
   An examination of records in the tower also showed that
even after 11 incidents of "operator error" in recent years
here, including one in which "a DC-10 landed over an Airbus
in position for takeoff" in July, officials hadn't ever
filled the assistant-controller position they created to help
alleviate the problem. Five controllers and a supervisor were
on duty in the tower at the time of the USAir-SkyWest
collision.
   Mr. Burnett also said an investigator looking from the
tower out to the point on the runway where the parked SkyWest
plane was struck from behind found that "his view was blocked
by a series of four light posts" on the airport property.
   Previously, Mr. Burnett had said that the controller was
involved in a "somewhat difficult" conversation with an
Aeromexico jetliner at the same time that she was authorizing
SkyWest's and USAir's aircraft to use the same runway. Tower
tape recordings later showed that yet another "lapse in
communication" was taking place at the same time between the
controller and a fourth plane.
   The safety-board investigation, too, hit some snags. The
USAir plane's "black box" voice recorder contained a tape
with "quality problems, I gather of a serious nature," Mr.
Burnett said, and investigators aren't counting on its
account of pilot conversations to shed much light on the
situation. He also said several parties involved in the
investigation had objected to a partial restaging of the
incident scheduled for last night to show investigators how
the SkyWest Fairchild Metroliner might have looked just after
6 p.m. PST to an arriving aircraft.
   Among the objections to the restaging, he said, were that
results could be misleading because exact visibility
conditions at the time of the accident would be difficult to
duplicate.
   The restaging was canceled because of weather conditions,
and airport officials said a new date hadn't been set.
   The safety board hoped today to interview the controller
who was handling both the USAir and SkyWest flights. She
hasn't been identified, except as a woman first employed by
the Federal Aviation Administration in April 1982 and a
veteran of stints at three other controller jobs before
coming here in September 1989. Results of drug tests
performed on the tower personnel haven't been released.
   Of the 89 USAir passengers and crew on board, 67 escaped
or were rescued from the flaming wreckage, 41 of them without
injury. Investigators also have begun assessing the
evacuation process and other "survival factors" related to
the crash.
   Operations returned to normal at Los Angeles
International, the nation's third-busiest airport with about
2,000 departures and arrivals daily, with the removal of the
last of the wreckage late Sunday. Flight delays of two hours
and more had snarled traffic at numerous other locations in
what an airport spokeswoman called "the snowball effect" from
closure of two of the four runways here.

<HEAD>Most of PSA Air Crash Cases Settled Just Before Final Arguments</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The families of 38 of the 42 people killed
when a fired airline employee brought down a jetliner in December
1987 settled their cases out of court on Tuesday.
   The settlements came just before final arguments were to be heard
in the liability trial against USAir and others. Damage cases
brought by the families of two passengers, a flight attendant and
the pilot remain.
   Families who did not request confidentiality said settlements
ranged from $200,000 to $3.7 million, attorneys said. The total
payment was less than $37 million but more than $20 million.
   Evidence presented during the trial included allegations of lax
security at both Los Angeles and San Francisco international
airports that allowed fired USAir employee David Burke to board
Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 1771 with a .44-caliber Magnum
pistol.
   ``I think we brought out how bad it was,'' said plaintiff
attorney Ronald Wecht, referring to airport security. ``Among other
things, this was the first public hearing of this airplane crash.
... I think the public had a right and a need to know about this
kind of disaster.''
   A telephone call seeking comment from lead defense counsel George
Manfredi was not immediately returned.
   Forty-three people, including Burke, died in the Dec. 7, 1987,
crash. Federal investigators concluded that midway through the
flight, Burke shot his supervisor, then entered the cockpit and shot
the crew.
   Minutes later, the BAe-146 four-engine plane slammed into a
hillside north of San Luis Obispo in an explosive crash. There were
no survivors.
   Marshall Foreman, who represented the families of crew members
killed in the crash, said the most damaging testimony in the trial
came from former USAir employee Joe Drabik, who loaned Burke the gun
used in the shootings and was a USAir supervisor in San Francisco at
the time.
   Drabik testified that in November he loaned the gun and 12 rounds
of ammunition to Burke, a longtime friend, at Burke's request. Burke
had already been fired by USAir for allegedly stealing $69 from a
petty cash box.
   Drabik said that on the day he loaned Burke the gun at the
airport he helped him get it through security by walking through an
employee bypass at the metal detector station while Burke walked
through the detectors.
   Although Drabik insisted that he did not carry the gun through
for Burke, he could not explain how Burke could pass through the
detectors and not set them off.
   ``Not one juror we talked to later said they believed that,''
said Foreman. ``It was the most damaging testimony for USAir. An
employee had knowingly violated security.''
   Other testimony came from experts on how Burke managed to sneak a
gun aboard Flight 1771 at Los Angeles International. Both sides
agreed that Burke used an unreturned employee identification badge
to move unchallenged through the airport, but his route to the plane
with the gun was disputed.
   Plaintiffs contended Burke could have simply flashed his
identification badge at security guards and used a bypass to avoid
metal detectors.
   Since the crash, the Federal Aviation Administration has
tightened requirements for airline employees passing through
security areas and regulation of identification badge issues.
   The settlements came before closing arguments or jury
deliberations began in the Los Angeles Superior Court case overseen
by Judge Jack T. Ryburn.
   Defendants included Pacific Southwest Airlines, its parent
company USAir, the city Department of Airports and Ogden Allied
Security, the private firm that handles metal detection and
passenger screening stations at Los Angeles International Airport.
   By agreement, the Airports Department was dismissed as a
defendant by all plaintiffs.
   Wecht, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys, suggested that the
remaining cases might eventually be settled out of court as well.
   ``It wasn't feasible for them to settle at this time,'' said
Foreman, who refused to elaborate.

<HEAD>Second Raid of Eastern Airline Flight Nets 69 Illegal Aliens</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sixty-nine illegal aliens were arrested as
they prepared to board the same Eastern Airlines flight that
immigration agents had raided on its previous trip, snaring 79
illegal aliens, authorities said Tuesday.
   In the second sweep, at Los Angeles International Airport Monday
night, agents also nabbed a Mexican they described as a principal in
the alleged smuggling operation. The man, whom police did not
identify, was arrested for investigation of transporting illegal
aliens.
   The first sweep had been at Hartsfield Atlanta International
Airport early Monday after Eastern's Flight 80, en route to New York
from Los Angeles, touched down for a stopover.
   U.S Immigration and Naturalization Service officials stressed
that several independent smugglers may have used Eastern's Flight 80
and that the group arrested in Los Angeles was not necessarily
linked to people seized in Atlanta. They also said the chief
smuggling operators remain at large.
   ``We feel like we have a number of individual smugglers who are
utilizing a rather low airfare to move their aliens away from the
border from Los Angeles and on up to the East Coast,'' said Thomas
Gaines, assistant Western District director for the INS.
   At a news conference at the INS' Los Angeles office, Gaines
speculated that the alleged smuggling operation may have gone ahead
Monday despite the arrests in Atlanta because the tickets had
already been bought.
   In Atlanta, the illegal aliens said they paid as much as $4,000
as part of a package deal to help start a new life in New York.
   Of those seized at the Los Angeles airport's Terminal Six, 54
were from Mexico, seven were from El Salvador, four were from
Colombia and four were from Guatemala, said Los Angeles INS Acting
District Director Donald Looney.
   INS spokesman Joe Flanders said most of the people, if found to
be illegal aliens, would be given the choice of going home or
requesting a deportation hearing. Flanders said some might be held
as material witnesses.
   One alien seized in Atlanta, Juan De La Cruz-Rodriguez, 34, said
he had come to the United STates to earn some money to send to his
wife and three young sons in the Dominican Republic. He told The
Atlanta Journal a smuggler in Mexico helped him and a dozen others
cross the border, then arranged to have them transported by flatbed
truck to Los Angeles.
   He said he sold his truck to raise part of the money and gave the
smuggler almost $1,000. Holding up a quarter, he said, ``That's all
I have left.''
   Gaines said the arrests at the Los Angeles airport resulted from
tips, but said the operation was not coordinated with the Atlanta
sweep.
   Tom Thomas, a spokesman for the INS in Atlanta, said thousands of
illegal aliens may have been shuttled across the country on the
daily Eastern Airlines flight from Los Angeles to New York. He said
Flight 80 might have been popular because no transfers were involved
and rates might have been cheaper.
   Gaines refused to speculate on how many people may have used the
flights, but said the technique is not new, recalling at least one
sweep in recent years that netted 200 people.
   Both Thomas in Atlanta and Looney in Los Angeles said Eastern
Airlines was not connected with the investigation.

<TEXT>     In her eight years as a controller, Robin Lee Wascher, 38, worked several
smaller posts before serving at Los Angeles International Airport.;    'Going
through hell';  Colleagues and friends interviewed for a story in Monday's Los
Angeles Times say Wascher is remorseful and "going through hell.";    People
who know her said her sensitivity to aviation accidents was enhanced by her
parents' deaths. She had told a former supervisor that she wanted to return to
California and resume the search for her parents, Norman and Beverly Jean
Wascher.;    "She said it was something that she dreamed about from time to
time," said Harry Pelphrey, her former Federal Aviation Administration
instructor.;    Wascher authorized a USAir Boeing 737 flight to land on the
same runway she had previously cleared for use by a Skywest commuter plane.
The collision that followed killed 34 people.;    She later told National
Transportation Safety Board investigators she had confused the Skywest plane
with a similar commuter aircraft on a nearby taxiway.;    The Los Angeles
disaster, said former brother-in-law James Nuciforo, "just dredges up an old
pain on top of a new one.";    Death certificates list her parents' fate as:
"Unknown; airplane disappeared in wilderness -- not found.";    Traumatic
experience;  "It was very traumatic" for Robin and her two sisters -- Cherie
and Heidi, Nuciforo said.;    After graduating from Thousand Oaks High School
and attending junior college, Robin Wascher joined the Air Force.;    In 1977,
Wascher was driving to her new assignment at Elmendorf Air Force outside
Anchorage, Alaska, when her parents' plane was reported missing, Nuciforo
said.;    Five weeks after her parents' disappearance, Wascher was discharged
from the Air Force and she rejoined her family's search for the plane.;   
After more than three months, family members called off the search.  </TEXT>

The hijacking was foiled after the pilot of the American Airlines 727 jetliner, 
carrying 140 passengers, turned back about 60 miles south of Miami because the 
plane was almost out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Rene Comas-Banos, 37, who had escaped from two mental hospitals during 
his stay in the United States, was arrested without incident and charged with 
air piracy, said William A. Gavin, head of the FBI's Miami office. No one 
aboard the jetliner was injured. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dressed in Fatigues 
</P>
<P>
The aborted hijacking began after Comas-Banos paid $417 in cash for a one-way 
ticket from Los Angeles to Miami. Shortly after midnight Saturday, dressed in 
camouflage fatigues and a bomber-type jacket, the sandy-haired Comas-Banos 
carried two red satchels on board American Airlines Flight 30 to Dallas-Ft. 
Worth. 
</P>
<P>
At 7 a.m., he left the Texas airport aboard Flight 1098. As the plane descended 
in its approach to Miami International Airport, Comas-Banos took out the 
starter pistol and demanded in a note to be flown to Jose Marti International 
Airport outside Havana, according to Gavin. Assisted by a Spanish-speaking 
passenger, he told the crew he had explosives with him and would blow up the 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Barker, the Federal Aviation Administration's regional spokesman, said in 
an interview from Georgia that air traffic controllers granted emergency 
permission for the plane to fly to Cuba. Barker said the plane headed south, 
but turned back because fuel was running low, landing in Miami at 11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agrees to Surrender 
</P>
<P>
After negotiations with the FBI continued for about 90 minutes, Comas-Banos 
agreed to surrender. A search of his luggage turned up no explosive. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Manzanilla, Cuba, he was sent to St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, 
D.C., shortly after arriving in the United States on May 27, 1980, during the 
Mariel boatlift. He escaped sometime in 1982, made his way to Los Angeles and 
was again hospitalized for psychiatric treatment at an unknown institution 
here, but again escaped, according to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
FBI spokesman Paul Miller said Comas-Banos had spent a considerable amount of 
time living on Los Angeles streets.

   An airline passenger with a beef over a
bunless hamburger threw his plate and eating utensils at a flight
attendant who was unable to placate him with a First Class roll, an
airline official said Friday.
   Matthew Wallis, 45, of New York City, was booked for
investigation of misdemeanor battery when American Airlines Flight
209 from New York landed at 10:15 p.m. Thursday at Los Angeles
International Airport. He was freed after posting bail of $500.
   Wallis was one of 50 people aboard the DC-10 who had ordered a
special meal, said Steve McGregor, a spokesman for American, based
in Fort Worth, Texas.
   ``He had ordered a hamburger. For some reason, the hamburger did
not have a bun with it. He became somewhat unhappy with that fact.
Our people notified the lead flight attendant who did obtain a roll
from the First Class section, thinking that might placate him. It
did not,'' McGregor said.
   Wallis' wife, who flew with him on the New York to Los Angeles
flight, ordered the same special meal, McGregor said.
   ``Her hamburger, in fact, did have a bun,'' McGregor said.
   When the proffered roll failed to satisfy Wallis, chief flight
attendant Sue Roen, of Los Angeles, advised the captain of the
problem. He ``told her to read him that portion of the law
outlining passenger misconduct,'' McGregor said.
   She did, but that only appeared to make the passenger angrier,
McGregor said.
   ``After using profanities, he picked up his plate with the knife
and fork still on it and threw it at her (Ms. Roen), hitting her
and narrowly missing a passenger with the flying knife,'' said Los
Angeles police Sgt. Joe Arreola.
   Ms. Roen was uninjured and none of the passengers around Wallis
was hurt, Arreola said.
   Wallis was placed under citizen's arrest by Ms. Roen after she
was struck by the plate. The captain contacted Los Angeles
International Airport and asked that police stand by, McGregor said.
   ``Interference with a flight crew is a federal offense and we
always prosecute. That will be the case here, too,'' McGregor said.
   McGregor was unsure how many passengers were aboard the flight
and didn't know what the menu item was for passengers who had made
no special requests.

<LEADPARA>  The architects who designed a new control tower for Los Angeles International
Airport say they were trying to combine the spirit of Los Angeles with the
spirit of flight.;   So they designed a control tower that looks something
like a palm tree with wings, perched atop a 22-story building only 32 feet
square at the base.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  California News  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  AIRPORT PANEL BALKS AT TOWER DESIGN
IDEA BLENDS FLIGHT WITH SPIRIT OF L.A., BUT
OFFICIALS DECLARE IT'S 'TOO GLITZY'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "This is sort of the ultimate high-tech tree house," said Kate Diamond, of
Siegel Diamond Architects of Santa Monica. "The idea was that these struts and
these wings become very much like the form of a palm tree, and that it's so
Los Angeles.";   The city's cultural affairs commissioners approved the design
July 25, and the Federal Aviation Administration has also given its blessing.
But when a cardboard model of the design was presented to airport
commissioners on Aug. 14, they sent the designers back to the drawing board.; 
 "We just wanted a functional tower," said airport commission President Robert
Chick. "What we saw was too glitzy. It has a lot going on. It's busy. I found
I would have preferred something that had less appendages on it.";   Chick
said the FAA had told the architects that they wanted a tower that would make
a statement.;   But FAA spokeswoman Elly Brekke said the FAA cares only that
the tower function according to regulations and isn't primarily concerned with
how it looks.;   Chick said the airport commission will work with the FAA, the
architects and the city Cultural Heritage Commission to work out a compromise
design.;   The FAA decided in 1980 that it needed a new tower to provide more
room and better visibility. The project, estimated to cost $15 million to $20
million, was put on hold while the FAA prepared for increased air travel
during the 1984 Olympic Games, Brekke said. Federal budget problems and the
search for a feasible site at LAX further delayed the project.;   Now all
that's standing in the agency's way is the airport commission's approval.;  
Diamond said it was probably a mistake to present the commission with a simple
cardboard model of the tower, which would be nearly twice as high as the
current one. She said her staff is working on a fancier model and full-color
tower illustration to present to the commission next month.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration has gotten
clearance for a pay-increase plan designed to attract more
experienced air traffic control employees in the nation's three
largest metropolitan areas.
   The Office of Personnel Management approved a ``demonstration
project'' Thursday calling for the FAA to boost pay by as much as 20
percent for some employees at hard-to-staff air traffic control
centers in the New York, Los Angeles and Chicago areas.
   The five-year experiment will determine whether incentives are an
effective tool in recruiting and retaining personnel, Transportation
Secretary James Burnley said.
   ``This project should make it possible for FAA to achieve full
staffing at facilities where living costs, highly complex operations
or other factors have made them less attractive locations for
employees,'' he said.
   More than 60 percent of the 2,000 employees eligible for the
bonus pay will be controllers, Burnley said. The rest are safety
inspectors and the technicians who maintain air-traffic control
computers and other equipment.
   Journeyman, or full-performance-level, controllers and some
inspectors at the nation's busiest airports make up to $60,683
annually in base pay, so a 20 percent salary differential would
boost their pay to as much as $72,819, FAA spokesman Fred Farrar
said today.
   However, he said not all controllers and inspectors receive that
much, and Farrar was not certain of the pay scale for technicians.
   The FAA said facilities chosen for the pay incentives include air
route traffic control centers at Chicago and New York, control
towers and terminal radar approach control centers at O'Hare
International and Los Angeles International Airport, terminal radar
approach centers at New York and Santa Anna, Calif., and flight
standards district offices at Los Angeles; Farmingdale, N.Y.; Valley
Stream, N.Y.; and Teterboro, N.J.
   The pay incentives are to begin next May.

<LEADPARA>  Federal safety officials and other witnesses Monday blasted the government's
slow-paced modernization of the nation's air traffic control system, saying
lives are at risk in the air and on the ground.;    Mayor Tom Bradley
criticized the Bush administration for using a $7 billion aviation trust fund
to balance the budget at the expense of passenger safety.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     People 'placed in danger';    "We cannot balance the budget of this nation
with the lives of the people who are placed in danger," Bradley told a hearing
of the House Government Activities and Transportation Subcommittee at Los
Angeles International Airport.;    Money from the trust fund, which pays for
such improvements as new radar, has been tied up by the federal budget
deficit. Originally intended to pay for airport capital projects, the fund has
bankrolled operating expenses.;    Spending the funds properly could prevent
the kind of runway collision that killed 34 people at the airport on Feb. 1,
Bradley told the committee.;    The hearing, chaired by Rep. Barbara Boxer,
D-San Rafael, also looked at a runway collision at Detroit Metropolitan
Airport on Dec. 3 that killed eight people.;    "Two hundred-forty runway
incursions in a year is just not acceptable," Boxer said. The FAA defines an
incursion as a ground collision hazard.;    "Incidents like the LAX collision
always appear random at first, like bolts from the blue or acts of God, but
upon closer examination the pattern of unfortunate trends and occurrences
emerges," Boxer said.;    The LAX collision occurred when an air traffic
controller allowed a USAir jet to land after clearing a Skywest commuter plane
for takeoff on the same runway.;    National Transportation Safety Board
(NTSB) investigators said most of the 22 people who died in the USAir jet
survived the collision but died trying to escape smoke and fire in the cabin.;
   The NTSB found that a 20-year-old ground radar system at LAX was not
working and that the USAir jet cabin was not equipped with advanced fire
retardant materials.;    Matthew McCormic, chief of the NTSB's survival
factors division, testified the materials must be installed on all new
aircraft, but on older aircraft only when they are refurbished.;    That could
take up to seven years, NTSB official Richard Wentworth said. He added that
over the last eight years, LAX has been second only to Boston's Logan
International Airport in the number of runway incursions.;    In written
testimony, the NTSB said the best way to prevent ground collisions is to
install advanced radar and other equipment that alerts controllers and pilots
about impending collisions.;    Boxer noted that LAX's ground radar hadn't
been functioning for most of the three months before the runway collision.;   
New system being tested;    FAA official Joseph Del Balzo, who declined to
comment on the LAX or Detroit accidents, said the FAA is testing an advanced
new ground radar system in Pittsburgh.;    But technical problems have delayed
its installation by four years, he testified. The system won't be working at
LAX and Detroit until October 1992, he said.;    The LAX ground radar system
goes down for lengthy periods of time while officials seek spare parts or
cannibalize other equipment, Del Balzo said.;    Less-sophisticated ground
radar systems at 13 other major airports fail roughly once every eight days,
Del Balzo added.;    "I believe we have a very safe air transportation system
in the United States . . . but the system isn't perfect," Del Balzo said.;   
Susan Bianchi-Sand, president of the Association of Flight Attendants,
criticized the FAA for failing to make it easier to escape airplane window
exits.;    Subcommittee members called on the Bush administration to
appropriate the aviation trust funds.;    "To me, virtually all of the deaths
on the USAir plane were preventable and never should have occurred," said Rep.
Mel Levine, D-Los Angeles.  </TEXT>

   Federal officials say they hope an offer
of higher pay will attract and keep air traffic controllers at the
nation's busiest towers and control centers.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner announced that 2,100
Federal Aviation Administration controllers, technicians and safety
inspectors at 11 facilities in the New York, Chicago, Los Angeles
and Oakland areas will get pay raises of up to 20 percent.
   ``The air traffic controllers in the busiest centers of this
country will be some of the highest paid people in the federal
government,'' Skinner said Monday at FAA offices near O'Hare
International Airport, the nation's busiest. ``I've been to those
centers and frankly I think those jobs deserve that kind of
compensation.''
   Many FAA control rooms have been chronically understaffed since
former President Reagan fired some 11,400 air traffic controllers
during an illegal strike in August 1981.
   The new plan was criticized as ``a Band-Aid on a hemorrhage'' by
Ray L. Spickler, executive vice president of the National Air
Traffic Controller Association. He said the raises would cover only
a fraction of a nationwide work force of 16,000.
   The union was certified to represent the nation's 7,000 air
traffic controllers in 1987, replacing the Professional Air Traffic
Controllers Organization, which was decertified after the 1981
strike.
   ``It will address short-term problems,'' union spokesman Tony
Dresden said of the wage plan. ``We would hope that the FAA would
look at fair compensation for all controllers.''
   FAA officials say the agency has difficulty staffing the 11
facilities with qualified workers because of high living costs,
complex operations and other unattractive features.
   In addition, many workers in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles
are close to retirement age, Skinner said.
   United Airlines, which has been urging higher salaries at O'Hare,
applauded the program.
   ``We believe this action is an encouraging step toward improving
O'Hare's ability to efficiently handle commercial air traffic at the
nation's busiest airport,'' the carrier said.
   Transportation Department officials said the program will cost an
extra $5 million a year from department funds, requiring minor
cutbacks in other programs. The 5-year demonstration project will be
made permanent if it is successful, Skinner said.
   Top-level air traffic controllers now make $60,000 to $65,000 a
year, including overtime, before the raises.
   Skinner said union representatives indicate the program is
already working at targeted facilities. The FAA has received a lot
of applications for the positions since the program was announced in
March, and those applying are highly skilled.
   The program earlier this year survived attempts by Congress to
restrict it workers at O'Hare and limit raises to 10 percent of base
pay, department officials said.
   The FAA facilities affected by the incentive plans include air
traffic control centers in Aurora, Ill., and Ronkonkoma, N.Y.; and
the O'Hare and Los Angeles international airport towers and terminal
radar approach control facilities.
   The program also covers approach-control facilities at Westbury,
N.Y., Santa Ana and Oakland, Calif.; and flight standards district
offices in Los Angeles; Farmingdale and Valley Stream, N.Y.; and
Teterboro, N.J.

BOMB SCARE AT AIRPORT IS JUST A CHILD'S GAME; 
</P>
<P>
 TERRORISM: IT LOOKED LIKE DYNAMITE IN THE X-RAY. BUT WHEN POLICE BLEW UP BAG, 
THEY FOUND NINTENDO.

<P>
To the U.S. Customs Service agent at Los Angeles International Airport, the 
object spotted by an X-ray machine in a piece of luggage bound for Colombia on 
an Avianca Airlines jet looked like "three sticks of dynamite, bound together." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Department bomb squad experts weren't willing to get that 
descriptive, but after viewing the X-rays early today they decided they had a 
"suspicious device" on their hands. They hauled it out to a remote spot at the 
western edge of the airport and blew it to smithereens. Then they examined the 
smithereens. 
</P>
<P>
The device turned out to be a Nintendo video game. Or what was left of one. 
</P>
<P>
None of the agencies involved -- not the airline, not the police, not customs, 
or the FBI, which was called in on the case -- criticized the operation. 
</P>
<P>
All of them agreed that, in the wake of the explosion of an Avianca jetliner 
over Colombia earlier this week, the concerns that led to the destruction of 
the luggage were well founded. 
</P>
<P>
The flight for which the luggage had been destined -- Avianca's Flight 73 to 
Bogota -- had originally been scheduled to leave LAX at 7:20 p.m. Tuesday. 
Because of mechanical problems, the jet to be used on the flight was held up at 
Mexico City, and Flight 73 was rescheduled for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, screening of the baggage for Flight 73 at LAX's Bradley 
International Terminal was delayed until about 12:30 a.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lovern, a customs supervisor at the airport, said the screening is a 
routine procedure for Avianca flights that has been intensified because of 
Monday's explosion of an Avianca Boeing 727 jetliner shortly after takeoff from 
Bogota that killed all 107 aboard. Drug traffickers have claimed they bombed 
the jet. 
</P>
<P>
Lovern said he was studying the images of the baggage passing through the X-ray 
machine shortly after midnight when he saw "the image of three sticks of 
dynamite, bound together," in a piece of soft-sided luggage. 
</P>
<P>
He said he ran the piece through again, and saw the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
The customs supervisor said he called Los Angeles Airport Police, who called 
Los Angeles police, who dispatched their bomb squad.
