TRADE THAT SHOOK THE NHL BENEFITED GRETZKY, TEAM

<P>
On Aug. 9, 1988, Wayne Gretzky bid a tearful adieu to the people of Edmonton,
choked out a few words that didn't really explain why he had asked to be
traded, climbed into Bruce McNall's private plane and flew into what was then
considered hockey oblivion.
</P>
<P>
Off to Los Angeles, of all places, in a stunning trade.
</P>
<P>
It changed the course of many lives, altered the balance of power in the
National Hockey League, affected television contracts and bottom lines, has
been reflected in many a player's renegotiations and, McNall believes, will
make Los Angeles a hockey town.
</P>
<P>
Somewhere over the Rockies, Gretzky dried his tears. He greeted his new life
with a smile and with the hope that he would, someday, waltz with another
Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
It was an amazingly quick transition, even for the Great One.
</P>
<P>
How long had he known it was coming? Was it really what he wanted?
</P>
<P>
Edmonton Oiler owner Peter Pocklington told reporters that day a year ago that
Gretzky had asked to be traded to the Kings because he wanted to spend more
time with his bride, Janet Jones, and that he had let Gretzky go with a heavy
heart.
</P>
<P>
However, Gretzky later said that Janet was not behind the trade, that there was
no cause for radio talk-show hosts in Canada to call her a Jezebel and liken
her role in breaking up the champion Edmonton Oilers to Yoko Ono's role in
breaking up the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
And how about Gretzky's tears? Were they real? Pocklington later said that they
were phony. All for show.
</P>
<P>
That was no act, Gretzky says. And he is sure that anyone who has ever seen him
try to act will agree.
</P>
<P>
"At that point in time, I felt like everyone else," Gretzky said. "I couldn't
believe it was happening. It wasn't as if we had just lost. We had just won the
Stanley Cup for the fourth time in five years. I had had, arguably, my best
playoff ever. I won the Conn Smythe, and, all of a sudden, I'm traded.
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of disbelief for everyone. That was my feeling more than anything
else. To this day, I'm like . . . every other sports fan. To think, two years
ago, that I would be playing in L.A.? It's hard to comprehend.
</P>
<P>
"The thing that is funny about it all, I was very disappointed when I left
Edmonton. I thought of all the great times and fun memories. And yet, on the
way home, with Mr. McNall, it was like it had happened a year ago. It was 10
minutes ago. By then, I was ready to move on. I was really looking forward to
L.A.
</P>
<P>
"It was time."
</P>
<P>
What was behind the trade that sent Gretzky, Mike Krushelnyski and Marty
McSorley to the Kings for Jimmy Carson, Martin Gelinas, three first-round draft
picks and $15 million?
</P>
<P>
Business. It was simply business.
</P>
<P>
As Gretzky said so often in the months that followed: "Owners don't do
$15-million favors for wives."
</P>
<P>
So what was Gretzky's role in the trade that caused Pocklington to be hanged in
effigy? And how does Gretzky feel after a year of living as a King?
</P>
<P>
It all started, Gretzky recalls, on the night that the Oilers won their fourth
Stanley Cup. It was as if someone had a secret, he said, and as soon as the
game was over, everyone wanted to be the first to tell him.
</P>
<P>
He was being shopped around.
</P>
<P>
Of course, he didn't believe it. Merely another rumor. He went out and
celebrated with his teammates.
</P>
<P>
But it started sounding pretty serious when he got a call at 8:30 the next
morning from Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
"I was just getting home," Gretzky said. "I hadn't even been to bed yet. I was
lying on my couch . . .
</P>
<P>
"It was a big surprise to get a call like that right after winning the Stanley
Cup. . . . I thought I had played pretty well."
</P>
<P>
Gretzky called Pocklington to ask what was going on and was told that the time
had come to get a new contract signed.
</P>
<P>
The contract that Gretzky and the Oilers had, at that time, was going to leave
Gretzky as an absolute free agent in 1991. Pocklington couldn't let that
happen.
</P>
<P>
The five-year contract had been signed hurriedly during the summer of 1987,
when Pocklington was planning to offer public stock in the Oilers. Pocklington
couldn't do that with Gretzky under the long-term personal services contract
that ran through '99 -- hence, Gretzky's number -- that they had signed when
Pocklington bought Gretzky's World Hockey Assn. team. Gretzky agreed to sign a
five-year contract with the Oilers without haggling as long as he had the
termination clause.
</P>
<P>
"I remember signing the contract knowing that I was going to be either re-done
or traded within one or two years, so it wasn't a surprise to me," Gretzky
said. "It came down to the fact that we couldn't come to an agreement. My
understanding was that if we couldn't come to an agreement, he would have to
move me. That's when it came down to business."
</P>
<P>
The shock he felt when Vancouver called him was, largely, the result of the
timing. He hadn't expected to be getting calls the morning after the
championship game, and certainly not before Pocklington had tried to get him
signed.
</P>
<P>
As the negotiations unfolded in the next few weeks, Gretzky came to understand
that he was in control when it came to the teams bidding for him.
</P>
<P>
"They felt that it would be best for everyone that I wasn't unhappy where I was
going," Gretzky said. "That's when I knew I could control my destiny.
</P>
<P>
"I did ask to go to Detroit or Los Angeles."
</P>
<P>
Detroit, near Gretzky's hometown of Brantford, Ontario, had always been his
sentimental favorite. Los Angeles meant Janet and lots of business
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"I knew when they were asking $15 million, the teams got narrowed down real
quick," Gretzky said. "There were only two or three teams I could really end up
with with that kind of a price tag. Detroit, New York and L.A. are about it."
</P>
<P>
Vancouver offered Gretzky a lot of money, but he didn't see what he had to gain
by going "an hour and a half west of Edmonton." The money, he said, didn't
matter. He killed the deal right away.
</P>
<P>
"I just said no," Gretzky said.
</P>
<P>
And Detroit didn't show Pocklington the kind of interest that Los Angeles
showed.
</P>
<P>
"That was when Bruce called me and told me that he had permission to talk to
me," Gretzky said.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between McNall and Pocklington went on for weeks.
</P>
<P>
"The Jimmy Carson part held up things at least two weeks," McNall said. "At
different times I thought maybe we could keep him. I thought they wanted to do
the deal so badly, that I had a chance.
</P>
<P>
"But when (the story) started to leak, the opportunity of keeping him was less.
The press, up there, began to get the story out and the response was coming in
so strong it was almost an impossible thing. (The Oilers) were starting to get
cold feet. So the Carson thing, we lost that."
</P>
<P>
McNall offered Pocklington a reported $5 million to keep Carson out of the
deal. McNall also offered more draft picks.
</P>
<P>
"I tried everything, but they were just adamant about it," he said.
</P>
<P>
At least he managed to hold onto Luc Robitaille. In the beginning, Edmonton had
been asking for both Robitaille and Carson.
</P>
<P>
McNall said he told the players in question what was going on.
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy knew it. Luc knew it," he said. "They understood that if we were going
to do this deal, we were going to have to give up something."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pocklington was trying to keep McSorley.
</P>
<P>
"I know that Glen Sather (Edmonton's coach and general manager) was not for the
deal," McNall said. "He was never real supportive of the idea. I didn't really
speak with him. He had resigned himself to doing it. But, again, he was adamant
about not wanting Marty McSorley to be a part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
"I was very concerned that, somehow, (the deal) was going to be messed up. . .
.
</P>
<P>
"Pocklington was under a lot of pressure from all sides. I thought he was going
to reconsider and say, 'Well, that's it.' He's the kind of guy who just might
say, 'Forget about it.' "
</P>
<P>
And Gretzky?
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough time because we were spending May and June getting ready for
our (July 16) wedding," Gretzky said.
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough wedding because we had to try to satisfy not only friends and
family, we had to satisfy fans, try to satisfy the media. We tried to make it
accommodating for everyone. It was hard. We were working almost full-time on
the wedding. My wife was pregnant. It was an emotional time.
</P>
<P>
"The official date that I was traded was when we got the telex, about a week
before it was announced. It wasn't supposed to be announced until about a week
later than it was, but somehow it leaked out."
</P>
<P>
Actually, McNall had called Gretzky while he was still on his honeymoon to tell
him that the trade had been agreed upon. And McNall took the Gretzkys and some
other friends out to dinner to celebrate in Los Angeles weeks before the Aug. 9
announcement.
</P>
<P>
Still, McNall says he feared that a last-second glitch would negate the
agreements.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really believe it was going to happen until late the night before, I
guess, Aug. 8, because we had gone around so often and it was so big, it's
almost unrealistic to think that something like that is going to take place,"
he said. "I came to the point where, actually, I think the day of Aug. 8, I
didn't really think it was going to happen at all.
</P>
<P>
"So that night I said to Peter, 'Look, if it's going to happen, it's going to
have to happen right now. If it's not, fine. But it's going to have to happen.'
I thought if it continued to muddle on, especially the pressure of the press,
with all the rumors, it would create such a huge stir up in Edmonton that it
wouldn't happen.
</P>
<P>
"I felt the more we kept it dragging, the worse it would get. I thought we had
to move on it now. I said, 'If you don't want the $15 million, fine.' That's
tough for a guy to say no to. So he said, 'Fine.' I called Wayne and got that
press conference thing set up real fast."
</P>
<P>
Gretzky said: "Bruce called me where I was staying at (entertainer) Alan
Thicke's house at about 1:30 in the morning and told me that we had to be on a
plane to Edmonton at 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
"I knew that I would have to sit down and talk with them (Pocklington and
Sather). It was one of the things that my wife and I had talked about. As I've
said, they were kind enough to let me go to L.A., and I was very appreciative
for that. But after some of the things that had been said and done, there was
no way, I just wouldn't have enjoyed myself playing hockey there."
</P>
<P>
McNall was nervous about sending Gretzky into those meetings alone. After all,
he had told Gretzky that if anything didn't feel right at the last minute, he
could pull out.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky said: "I never wavered. I knew that Mr. McNall was nervous when I went
in there, but I wasn't. I had no reason to think that anyone could talk me out
of it. I think that by that point in time, I was way beyond coming back to
Edmonton."
</P>
<P>
"I think they traded me to L.A. thinking that (with this club) I wouldn't come
back to haunt them," Gretzky said. "I think, in that, I was underestimated as a
hockey player."
</P>
<P>
The Kings' record in their first year with Gretzky improved to 42-31-7. They
went from 18th overall in the league to fourth, one point away from third
place. They came from behind to knock the defending champion Oilers out of the
playoffs before they lost to Calgary, which won the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
The success was reflected at the box office, even before Gretzky had played a
game.
</P>
<P>
The sellout for the Kings' opener last season was the team's first sellout of
an opener. They went on to a record 25 sellouts and their average attendance
increased from 11,667 to 14,875. And then they sold out all six playoff games.
</P>
<P>
The trade that was a business deal turned out to be good business for the
Kings.
</P>
<P>
That's why McNall thought, from the start, that it would be only fair to offer
Gretzky a share of the franchise that he was about to turn around.
</P>
<P>
"He's not just a hockey player," McNall said. "For what he's done for our team?
He's your partner.
</P>
<P>
"On one hand, he's a player and he just wants to be a player. On the other
hand, he's also a good friend. He's been there for us any time we needed him
for anything.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, selling a sport that has hit the way it's hit here has demanded a
lot of his time and his effort and a lot of his cooperation. We've become good
friends.
</P>
<P>
"If Wayne Gretzky ever gets bored with this sport one day and decides not to
play, until we've set up a tradition here, it could easily fall back to where
it was before. So I treat him more like a partner.
</P>
<P>
"If the league had permitted it on his contract deal, I had talked to him about
a part of the franchise. And Wayne didn't want it. He just wants to be a
player.
</P>
<P>
"But I was right in thinking that the value of the franchise would increase
enormously as a result of him. There is no other real reason for it. We can all
speculate about the change of colors and all the nice things we've done here.
The organization has done more to help promote the Kings. And that's certainly
a percentage of it. But it's not a very high percentage of it. I'd say 99% of
it is Gretzky."
</P>
<P>
McNall considers Gretzky the catalyst for all the things that followed.
</P>
<P>
"The Larry Robinsons and those kinds of things may not have happened," McNall
said. "It would be a different team and it might be going in a different
direction."
</P>
<P>
But what about the general perception that McNall and Gretzky are such close
buddies that Gretzky, more than General Manager Rogie Vachon, calls the shots?
</P>
<P>
McNall said: "We do pal around. We do discuss things. But he will never
volunteer something, like, 'I think we should get this guy for that guy.' Never
once has that happened.
</P>
<P>
"But what I do do, and what Rogie does, more than I do, is to ask him, for
example, 'What do you think of Keith Crowder?' Or, 'Of the free agents
available, who do you think will help our team the most?' If Rogie didn't do
it, I'd be disappointed. And if I didn't do it, I'd be crazy.
</P>
<P>
"My attitude is, use every asset you possibly can. I also ask other players,
too."
</P>
<P>
"In a way, you don't want to have so many cooks you mess up the soup. But when
you have the greatest player that ever lived, you'd be nuts not to use his
knowledge of the game."
</P>
<P>
And when they don't all agree? McNall said he puts Gretzky's call ahead of his
own, but puts Vachon's ahead of Gretzky's.
</P>
<P>
As proof that Gretzky doesn't always get what he wants, McNall points out: "If
that was the case, every Edmonton player would be here, one way or the other. .
. . He's never in a situation where he asks that much. He just doesn't do that.
He doesn't say, 'You've got to go out and get (Jari) Kurri, any way you can.'
</P>
<P>
"If I go to him and say, 'We can get Kurri for this that and the other thing,
what do you think?' he'll be honest. We've asked things about players he was
friendly with, deals that I thought, emotionally, he might want, and he'll say,
'No. That's too much.' "
</P>
<P>
McNall values Vachon, he says, because Vachon knows how to follow protocol.
</P>
<P>
"There's an old style in hockey that says a GM does a certain job," McNall
said. "Players, coaches, even owners to a certain extent, don't violate that
area. A coach does a certain job. And those areas are inviolate. I don't
believe in that. I'll listen to the press sometimes if I have to. I'll listen
to a fan. It doesn't matter. I get input from all directions. . . . I listen.
</P>
<P>
"But Rogie's authority is not in any way affected by it. I would have a
personal problem with a GM who had to be so forceful and arrogant about his
personal views of how things ought to be run that he didn't listen to anyone,
whether it be an owner or whether it be Wayne Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
"Again, realistically, who's going to win that battle, if there was such a
battle? I don't know how many GMs in this league sell tickets. I don't know how
many owners sell tickets when you really come down to it.
</P>
<P>
"So, the idea that Wayne runs the show, you'd be right to view things that way
from the point of view that his influence is always going to be great."
</P>
<P>
Gretzky is hoping that, in the coming season, the focus will shift away from
him, at least a bit, as new issues draw the spotlight away from the trade.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Mario Lemieux of Pittsburgh and Steve Yzerman of Detroit helped
shift some of the attention. So did the big year that Gretzky's new teammate,
Bernie Nicholls, had.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky says that this season, the addition of some Soviet stars will capture
the attention of a lot of NHL fans. And in Los Angeles, Gretzky will be glad to
share center stage with Nicholls again. And with Larry Robinson, who has joined
the Kings from the Montreal Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
First, of course, Gretzky will have to deal with the flood of attention that
will come with breaking the league scoring record, currently held by his idol,
Gordie Howe. He needs 14 points to break Howe's mark of 1,850 points.
</P>
<P>
McNall is hoping that the record goes in one of the first four games, so that
it happens in the Forum for King fans.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky says he would love to do it in Los Angeles, but he thinks it might be
more realistic to expect to see it in the sixth game, which happens to be in
Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
But if form holds, it's sure to happen early in the season.
</P>
<P>
"It was perfect last year, when I needed 182 points," Gretzky said. "It was so
far away that no one really talked about it. Now, with 14 to go, it's so close.
It will happen relatively quickly. We won't still be talking about it in
November, December and January."
</P>
<P>
Gretzky is also hoping that the Kings, as a contending team, will be worth some
attention.
</P>
<P>
"I always said that this is a sports city, and any time you have a sports city,
give them something they like, and they'll support it," Gretzky said.
</P>
<P>
"People used to say to me, 'You're going down there and it's a basketball town.
They have the Lakers.' Sure, they have the Lakers, and it's great to watch the
champions. But I always tell people, 'There's another (pro basketball) team in
town and they're only drawing 6,000. If it's such a great basketball town, why
are they only drawing 6,000?'
</P>
<P>
"People want to see winners. They come to watch and be entertained, see a team
win. I knew if the Kings could put a winning atmosphere here and a positive
attitude, we would do well.
</P>
<P>
"I think our team is much better right now than what we finished with. . . .
Just five or six more wins than we had last year would be a big improvement.
</P>
<P>
"Keith Crowder will help us a lot. He'll give us a very solid checking line. .
. . Larry (Robinson) will prove invaluable. He played well in the playoffs last
year, and I'm sure he'll play the same way for us. More important, he'll be
like a playing coach for our young defensemen. The two Swedish players that we
signed, who have not been talked about, are going to help.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have the depth Calgary had last year, but we stayed with them pretty
well. . . . Rogie and Mr. McNall are the ones who spent the summer working,
making sure the right people are here. . . . I think the team that comes out of
this division will have as good a chance as any for the Stanley Cup."
</P>
<P>
But the Kings need to have that kind of a chance every year to develop fans.
And the Kings need to have fans who are coming to see hockey, not just one
player.
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to build something that lasts," Gretzky said. "We don't want to
have another season like last year and then two years from now drop back down.
We want to build a foundation, build a following. Parents bringing their kids
to games now, I hope 20 years from now, those kids will being bringing their
kids. We need to build a relationship with the fans.
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how teams change year to year."
</P>
<P>
Like how the Kings changed between the playoffs of 1988 and the playoffs of
1989.
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was going to be tough year (last year), because it was a new thing
and an exciting time for everyone," Gretzky said. "It's part of the game that
you accept. Obviously, it's going to be a lot easier for me this year."

MIKE DOWNEY: NO RECORD FOR GRETZKY, BUT CANUCK FANS AREN'T LAUGHING

<TEXT>
<P>
Wayne, Wayne, go away, come again some other day.
</P>
<P>
You practically could hear the Canucks thinking it out loud. Welcome back to
Vancouver, friend Gretzky, they were saying to themselves, how's Los Angeles,
how's Princess Janet, how's it goin', eh? Now be a nice little legend and run
along. Don't go breaking Gordie Howe's all-time scoring record against our
poor, unloved, unknown, never-even-won-one-stinking-Stanley-Cup Canuckleheads.
Go pick on Edmonton. Take it out on the Oilers. They're the ones who traded
you, not us. Go light their lamps.
</P>
<P>
Well, Gretzky did not get the record. But you think Vancouver is happy about
that?
</P>
<P>
Canuck, yuk, yuk -- no way. Gretz's third point of the night Friday helped make
6-5 winners of the Kings -- with one second to play. Now if that's not the
Wayne Gretzky we have come to know and love, what is?
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to jump ahead of myself," Gretzky said afterward, unwilling to
predict that he will erase Howe's record Sunday at Edmonton rather than waiting
until next Tuesday's game at home against Boston.
</P>
<P>
"I think most everybody in Edmonton wants me to do it," Gretzky added, with
just the slightest hint of mischief in his voice. "I just think they want me to
do it on Tuesday."
</P>
<P>
A full house at the Pacific Coliseum was quite naturally pleased to see No. 99
again. The man always puts a few extra chills in the rink. He is more of a
hockey hero to many of these people than No. 9, The Great Gordie, ever was,
seeing as how Vancouver wasn't even in the National Hockey League during most
of the Ice Age, back when Howe was playing for Detroit. Was ice even invented
then?
</P>
<P>
There must have been more than a few British Columbians who were getting their
first look at Gordie Howe -- through binoculars -- as he watched his rightful
heir from King owner Bruce McNall's luxury box. Gretzky came into the game
needing five more points to eclipse Howe's scoring record of 1,850 points. He
got three -- all assists. Hey, a point is a point is a point.
</P>
<P>
Presumably, Howe will keep tailing Gretzky from town to town until the record
breaks, whether it be Sunday at Edmonton, or Tuesday in Inglewood, or . . .
well, there'd better not be another "or." Nobody in hockey likes an "or,"
unless it's Bobby.
</P>
<P>
Say, there's an idea. Let's drag Bobby Orr out of retirement. Maybe let him
play for the Kings, too.
</P>
<P>
You see, there's this goofy story going around that Gordie Howe is going to
suit up with the Kings sometime soon -- at age 61! Whether this idea is
practical or a practical joke, we can't yet tell. We also don't know for sure
what would happen should Howe get a hat trick on his first night playing for
McNall, then decides to work a couple of shifts every game for the rest of the
season. What if Howe re-breaks the scoring record after Gretzky breaks it? What
if McNall also signs Alex Delvecchio to play on his line?

<P>
Listen, Los Angeles is such a one-of-a-kind hockey town, anything can happen.
You think we're pulling your skate? We couldn't be more serious. Think about
it: Who are the three greatest scorers in hockey history? Marcel Dionne, who
played for the Kings; Wayne Gretzky, who plays for the Kings, and Gordie Howe,
who is going to play for the Kings. Now there's a trick for you.
</P>
<P>
We can't help but wonder -- will anybody ever break Wayne Gretzky's record,
once he breaks the thing? Where will it rank? With Pete Rose's hits? With Nolan
Ryan's strikeouts? With Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's points? Will Gretz be anything
like those guys and keep playing well into his 40s? Do you have any idea when
Wayne Gretzky will even turn 40? On Jan. 26, 2001 -- that's when he'll turn 40.
</P>
<P>
The guy might have 3,000 points by then. Maybe he'll turn out to be just like
Howe, his idol -- still playing at age 52, still talking comeback at 61. Or
maybe Old Man Gretzky will be up there watching from a luxury box by then,
watching some new kid scoring goals for the Kings, challenging his record.
Maybe the kid's last name will be Gretzky. Maybe her first name will be
Paulina.
</P>
<P>
It was exactly 10 years ago Tuesday that Wayne Gretzky scored his first NHL
point. It was exactly one year ago Oct. 6 that Gretzky scored his first Los
Angeles point. How time flies when you're torturing goalies.
</P>
<P>
The most famous 99 since Barbara Feldon on "Get Smart," Gretzky got a big hand
when he first took the ice Friday -- and after that, he was strictly the enemy.
Canuck-lovers were a lot more interested in seeing their team win than in
seeing Gretzky score five points against them. Still, they sold out the
building for the first time all season -- and we all know why, don't we?
</P>
<P>
The Kings were behind by two goals, then ahead by two goals, then locked in
mortal combat most of the third period, until the very, very end. Gretzky was
stopped point-blank on his one clean bustout, but assisted twice on goals by
Bob Kudelski and then on the game-winner. The record could wait. As usual,
Gretzky was more concerned with winning.
</P>
<P>
Edmonton, you're next.
</P>
<P>
And he isn't going away.

MIKE DOWNEY: AS HARD AS THEY TRIED, IT'S AN OLD STORY

Turn out the red lights, the party's over.
</P>
<P>
Joe Murphy, the man Edmonton got for Jimmy Carson, who was the man Edmonton got
for Wayne Gretzky, wrote the finish to the Kings' season Tuesday night at the
Forum. His overtime goal handed the Kings a 6-5 loss and a four-game Smythe
Division playoff wipeout.
</P>
<P>
Ow.
</P>
<P>
Talk about adding Inglewood insult to injury.
</P>
<P>
Here are the Edmonton Oilers, without the greatest hockey player since Gordie
Howe, and how good are they?
</P>
<P>
So good that, after Tuesday's game, Gretzky said: "I've never seen them play
better."
</P>
<P>
Seems sort of unfair that a team could trade Wayne Gretzky and get better.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky didn't play in this game; he watched it with a backache. The Kings,
somewhat weirdly, played their two best games of the playoffs -- Game 1 versus
Calgary and Game 4 versus Edmonton -- without Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
For a team that got broomed, the Kings went out like winners. Kelly Hrudey took
shots to his sore ribs and turned them away. The Kings got their fans out of
their seats and onto their feet with a rally from a 4-1 disadvantage that
nearly sent them back to the Great White North.
</P>
<P>
Crazy people, these King fans. They actually had the gall to chant "Ranford!
Ranford!" taunting the one man, Edmonton goaltender Bill Ranford, who had been
the star of the series.
</P>
<P>
There is no truth the rumor that they didn't chant "Hrudey! Hrudey!" because
they couldn't pronounce it.
</P>
<P>
The Kings outshot the Oilers in every game of this series. That's how awesome
Ranford was. They should have chanted his name after the game, as a nice
gesture.
</P>
<P>
But maybe, like the rest of us, they were too disappointed at another season of
Los Angeles hockey going down the old Forum drain.
</P>
<P>
This was the season the Kings could have lugged home the big silver jug.
</P>
<P>
There was nobody else left out there who scared them -- not the Blues,
Blackhawks, Bruins, Canadiens, Rangers or Capitals.
</P>
<P>
The Kings can consider themselves victims of alignment. Calgary and Edmonton
probably have been the two best teams in hockey over the last two seasons. If
Los Angeles played in the other conference, it might have made both the 1989
and 1990 Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the NHL might realign the divisions, putting all the Canadian
teams into one, and slipping the Kings into the Norris with St. Louis, Chicago,
Detroit and the Minnesota (California?) North Stars.
</P>
<P>
But, for the moment anyway, the Kings would rather not think about the future.
</P>
<P>
They are a team centered by an 11-year veteran with a bad back (Wayne Gretzky).
</P>
<P>
They are a team that relied this season on a 38-year-old defenseman (Larry
Robinson), a 34-year-old right wing (Dave Taylor) and a 33-year-old left wing
(John Tonelli).
</P>
<P>
They no longer have Bernie Nicholls, Jimmy Carson, Mark Fitzpatrick, Martin
Gelinas . . .
</P>
<P>
They are a team that hasn't gone one step further with Gretzky than they went
without Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
They are a team that took away Edmonton's greatest player and gave Edmonton
millions of dollars and all sorts of draft choices and still can't get past the
second round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
They are a team that did not play any better with Tom Webster as coach than
with Robbie Ftorek as coach, and, in fact, during the regular season played
worse.
</P>
<P>
They are a too-old team that lacks draft choices. They remain unsettled in
goal, not knowing whether to stay with Kelly Hrudey, give Mario Gosselin or Ron
Scott a chance, or hope that young Robb Stauber will be physically and
emotionally ready by fall.
</P>
<P>
They have not gotten much out of Mikko Makela or Brian Benning, two guys who
were supposed to be valuable pickups, and the jury is still out on whether
Tomas Sandstrom and Tony Granato will make them rue the day they let Nicholls
get away to New York.
</P>
<P>
The best thing the Kings have going for them is Bruce McNall's pocketbook and
his insatiable desire to bring Los Angeles a winner.
</P>
<P>
If he does not produce a Cup finalist with Gretzky working for him, how can he
be expected to deliver one without him? McNall might have to find some sucker
willing to part with a Mario Lemieux-type for a few billion bucks.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky made hockey a happening in this town. Most of us wouldn't trade the
last two seasons for anything.
</P>
<P>
But, as we said at the time, the Kings were gambling an awful lot on giving up
so much for Gretzky. They have gambled and lost.
</P>
<P>
It isn't over yet, for him or for them. You never know what tomorrow will
bring, and, like Scarlett O'Hara, they won't worry about tomorrow until
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
All we know is that, to win a Stanley Cup, the L.A. Kings need more than just a
new division.
</P>
<P>
It isn't enough to have the player. They need players -- plural.

<HL> NHL's Lowly Kings Seek Higher Ground With Great Gretzky --- Trade Upsets Oiler Fans; Move Could Help Hockey In Southern California </HL>
<AUTHOR> David J. Jefferson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lowly Los Angeles Kings acquired hockey's crown jewel, Wayne Gretzky, from Canada's Edmonton Oilers in a costly transaction designed to put the sport on the map in Southern California.

   Mr. Gretzky, 27 years old, led the Oilers to four Stanley Cup championships in the past five years and holds 47 National Hockey League records, including single-season records for most goals, assists and points.
The Kings, who placed 18th out of 21 in league play last season, have never won the league title.

   The Kings will pay the Alberta team more than $10 million and hand over three first-round draft choices in the trade, which also involves the exchange of four other players between the Kings and Oilers.
While it is hard to place a value on such a transaction, some experts speculated it could be the richest trade ever in any sport.

   "I don't think there's ever been a trade in pro sports that you can say is comparable," said Steven Matt, a manager in the Dallas-based appraisal and valuations group of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. that follows sports businesses.

   At a news conference in Edmonton, a tearful Mr. Gretzky indicated that he requested the trade as a result of his recent marriage to actress Janet Jones, who maintains a home in Los Angeles and has plans to continue her acting career.

   Although "disappointed about having to leave Edmonton," he said, playing for the Kings would be "for the benefit of Wayne Gretzky, my new wife and our expected child in the new year."

   Mr. Gretzky had been the league's most valuable player for eight straight years until last season and ranks third among hockey's all-time leading scorers with 583 goals and 1,086 assists.
His annual salary with the Oilers was estimated at about $1 million.

   Bruce McNall, who earlier this year became the Kings' sole owner, was recently quoted in news reports as saying, "I've got to do something radical to sell hockey in L.A."

   The Kings' season overlaps with that of the popular Los Angeles Lakers, who share the Forum arena with the hockey team.
The 11,600-person average attendance for a Kings game last year was in the bottom one-third for the league, a Kings spokesman said.

   But news of the trade had fans flooding the phone circuits at the Kings box office here, hungry for season tickets.

   Meanwhile in Edmonton, the lines were jammed with disgruntled fans steaming over the defection of their star player.

   John Ziegler, the hockey league's president, broke with a longstanding policy of not commenting on trades to say, "We wish all the players involved the best and hope that {the trade} continues the success of Edmonton and improves the fortunes of Los Angeles."

<HEAD>Canadians Shed `99 Tears' For Loss of National Treasure Gretzky</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor of Edmonton, members of Parliament and
even Wayne Gretzky's father bemoaned the loss of the hockey
superstar to the United States, but it's a path pioneered by many
other Canadians from Mary Pickford to Michael J. Fox.
   The decision Tuesday by the Edmonton Oilers to trade Gretzky _
``The Great One'' _ to the Los Angeles Kings touched the most
sensitive nerve in this northern culture: the fear that Canada's
best and brightest inevitably end up in the United States.
   The expatriates include economist John Kenneth Galbraith and
anchorman Peter Jennings, but it's Hollywood that has brought the
most fame to Canadians such as Miss Pickford, Fox, Glenn Ford,
Raymond Burr, Lorne Greene, Raymond Massey, Ruby Keeler, Yvonne De
Carlo, Rich Little, John Candy and Margot Kidder.
   ``It's like ripping a heart out of a city,'' said dejected
Edmonton Mayor Laurence Decore, who credits Gretzky with putting
his blue-collar city of 574,000 people on the map.
   It is not just for the four Stanley Cups and his numerous
records that Gretzky will be missed. His sincerity and quiet charm
made him a goodwill ambassador for the city.
   The tabloid Edmonton Sun carried a simple, sad headline
Wednesday: ``99 Tears,'' referring to the number on Gretzky's
jersey.
   Telephone lines to local radio stations were jammed.
   ``We've had literally hundreds of calls,'' said Rod Phillips,
play-by-play announcer for Edmonton radio station CFRN. ``Everyone
we talked to said, `That's it, I'm never going to see another
Oilers game.'''
   Callers blamed Gretzky's departure on the American he married
July 16, actress Janet Jones, who has a home in Los Angeles.
   Although 3,000 fans lovingly greeted the newlyweds when they
were married in a lavish ceremony in Edmonton, many people have now
turned against the bride. She was likened to John Lennon's widow,
Yoko Ono, blamed by some fans for the breakup of the Beatles.
   An Edmonton Sun editorial disagreed. ```The Great One' owes
Edmonton nothing ... It is Edmonton who owes Gretzky. And all we
can do it seems in repayment is label Gretzky a traitor (and) call
his new wife a Jezebel.''
   Many fans were bitter because the trade came one day after the
deadline for renewing season tickets, and one irate supporter
burned an effigy of Oilers' owner Peter Pocklington in front of
national TV cameras.
   In Ottawa, Parliament member Nelson Riis of the New Democratic
Party made a tongue-in-cheek demand for government intervention.
   ``Wayne Gretzky is a national symbol, like the beaver,'' Riis
said. ``The Edmonton Oilers without Wayne Gretzky is like apple pie
without ice cream, like winter without snow, like the `Wheel of
Fortune' without Vanna White.''
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's office stayed out of the
controversy.
   ``We wish Mr. Gretzky well and we're sure he will be a great
representative of Canada and all that's finest in Canada's national
game no matter where he plays,'' a spokesman for Mulroney told The
Associated Press.
   One official pointed out that Bobby Orr, Gordie Howe and Bobby
Hull _ three other Canadian hockey legends _ also played for
American teams.
   Legislators in Alberta Province demanded an investigation of
government loans given Pocklington on the basis of his contract
with Gretzky as collateral.
   ``The government should hold up the deal until they've
investigated to make sure the taxpayers aren't being honked,'' said
Liberal Party leader Nick Taylor.
   Gretzky's father, Walter, who trained his son on a backyard rink
in Brantford, Ontario, said he was as patriotic as any other
Canadian and was sorry to see the move.
   ``He's a Canadian institution and had been in Edmonton for nine
years. But if it's what Wayne wants and it makes him happy, then
I'm delighted for him,'' he said.
   If there was one bright spot on the Canadian landscape it glowed
in Calgary, the southern Alberta city whose team, the Flames, are
locked in a bitter rivalry with the Oilers.
   ``This should be a civic holiday here,'' said Calgary fan David
Scott.

<DATELINE>EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He married a movie actress and now he's
Hollywood-bound, but it's clear the city that won Wayne Gretzky
renown as the greatest ice hockey player of his time has scored
more than a few points with him.
   Gretzky said at a news conference Tuesday that he wanted the
trade from the Edmonton Oilers to the Los Angeles Kings for
personal reasons, ``for the benefit of Wayne Gretzky, my new wife
and our expected child in the new year.''
   Then, the Great Gretzky was overcome with emotion.
   ``There comes a time when ...,'' he said before pausing. He
rubbed bleary eyes trying to regain his composure, then seemed to
give up. Without continuing, he stood up and walked away from the
microphones.
   Gretzky said his wife, Los Angeles-based actress Janet Jones,
did not ask him to seek a trade. ``It's my own gut feeling,'' he
said. The two were married July 16.
   Gretzky led the Oilers to four Stanley Cup championships in the
last five seasons. He holds or shares 49 National Hockey League
scoring records.
   The trade involved four other players, three first-round draft
choices and more than $10 million.
   Oilers' president Glen Sather, also with tears in his eyes, said
he hated to trade Gretzky but it was a good deal ``for Wayne, the
Oilers and the National Hockey League.''
   But Oiler fans reacted swiftly to news of the trade. Callers
jammed the 21 telephone lines at the team offices, some threatening
to cancel season tickets.

POCKLINGTON'S MOTTO IS NEVER SAY NEVER
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edmonton Oilers owner Peter Pocklington has received a lot of abuse from fans
at home for trading Wayne Gretzky. But he says he doesn't blame them for being
bitter.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I'd ever forgive me (if he was a fan)," Pocklington said
recently. "If I was a fan I don't think I'd forgive me. If I weren't me, I
don't know if I'd trust me or not."
</P>
<P>
All this came up in the midst of a rumor that Pocklington was considering
selling goaltender Grant Fuhr. Pocklington denied the rumor, adding he would
never sell another player again like he sold Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
"I never say never about anything, but Wayne Gretzky was once in a lifetime,"
Pocklington said.
</P>
<P>
Edmonton Coach Glen Sather, responding to a recent report that the Oilers were
having difficulty filling the stands since trading Gretzky:
</P>
<P>
"We've had 97 and 98 per cent capacity. I'd have used 99, but we're not using
that number any more."
</P>
<P>
Bobby Hull, the legendary left wing, will become the second player in history
to have his number retired by two teams.
</P>
<P>
Hull, whose number has been retired by the Chicago Blackhawks, will be honored
by the Winnipeg Jets in March.
</P>
<P>
Gordie Howe's number has been retired by Detroit and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, Hull and Howe both wore No. 9.
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg center Dale Hawerchuk is trying be positive, even though the Jets have
been struggling of late.
</P>
<P>
After a recent 9-4 loss to Edmonton that was one of the low points of the
season, Hawerchuk said things could be worse.
</P>
<P>
How so?
</P>
<P>
"The low point of the season is when there are a couple of games left and you
haven't got enough games to catch up for the playoffs."
</P>
<P>
Who can Mario Lemieux thank for taking over Wayne Gretzky's spot as the NHL
scoring leader?
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
According to Chicago Blackhawks coach Mike Keenan, the main reason for
Lemieux's improvement in Pittsburgh the last two seasons is Gretzky. Keenan was
their coach on the Canadian team in the 1987 Canada Cup.
</P>
<P>
"I hope Mario has sent Wayne a thank-you note," Keenan says. "There's no
question he wouldn't be the player today if not for playing with Wayne in the
Canada Cup. "Wayne taught Mario everything he knew about hockey, then he went
out and met all the challenges from Mario on the ice. Your top players learn
from and desire challenges like that."
</P>
<P>
When the Soviet Red Army hockey team was in Hartford for a recent tour, the
players went to see the movie "Naked Gun." A scene in the film shows a
lookalike of Mikhail Gorbachev being grabbed by a guy, who rubs off the
distinctive birthmark on the Soviet leader's head.
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid they wouldn't like it," said Mike Hume, who was the NHL liaison
to the Soviet team. "But they were laughing so hard, they were holding their
sides."
</P>
<P>
The Red Army squad was unable to practice at Hartford's Civic Center, and the
players had to skate in an old, cold arena in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
"It was as close to Siberia as we could get for them," Hartford coach Larry
Pleau said.
</P>
<P>
The NHL is taking a tougher stance on criticism of officials.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the league sent a memo to the 21 teams advising non-playing personnel
they could be fined for criticizing referees. The memo, from NHL lawyer Gil
Stein, says even the "spirit and implication" of a coach's comments will be
considered a breach of the rules.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, for example, if a coach says to a reporter: 'I will say nothing about
tonight's officiating because I don't want to be fined by the league,' he'll be
fined."
</P>
<P>
The writing may be on the wall for New York Islanders veteran center Bryan
Trottier. The New York Islanders have told Trottier that his ice time will be
reduced in favor of younger players.
</P>
<P>
Trottier and his agent, Bob Thornton, talked to general manager Bill Torrey
about the issue.
</P>
<P>
"He does not want to be a part-time player," Thornton says. "If his ice time is
cut considerably, he doesn't want too be here anymore."
</P>
<P>
A stumbing block to dealing Trottier is his $700,000 salary.

GRETZKY TIES HOWE'S SCORING RECORD
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
He was called the Great Gretzky even before he played his first National Hockey
League game. On Sunday night, in only his 11th season and before the adoring
fans of his former team, he pulled even with Gordie Howe, hockey's greatest
all-time scorer.
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky, at age 28, tied Howe's record of 1,850 points with an assist
early in the first period of the Los Angeles Kings' game against the Edmonton
Oilers.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky fed defenseman Tom Laidlaw, who put the puck in front of the net, and
Bernie Nicholls knocked it past Edmonton goaltender Bill Ranford at 4:32 for
the game's opening goal.
</P>
<P>
It was fitting that Gretzky tied the record against the Oilers, who he led to
four Stanley Cup titles in nine seasons. Oilers owner Peter Pocklington traded
him to Los Angeles on Aug. 9, 1988 in the biggest trade in NHL history.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky was revered by Edmonton fans and left the city in tears on the day of
the trade. He had predicted before the season that he would break Howe's mark
on his first visit of the season to the Northlands Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's specialness, Howe said, made the loss of the record easier to take.
</P>
<P>
"If it was, pardon the expression, some clown breaking it, it would have
bothered me," Howe said earlier. "But not Wayne."
</P>
<P>
Howe was at the Northlands Coliseum Sunday night, along with NHL president John
Ziegler and Gretzky's family. Howe scored 801 goals and added 1,049 assists in
26 seasons. Gretzky, playing his 780th game, was one point short of a tie going
into the game and the Edmonton fans were rooting for the record to fall.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky already had the NHL assists record with 1,209. He's fourth in goals
with 640 but Howe's record of 801 doesn't figure to last too much longer.
</P>
<P>
"This one is different from all the rest," said Gretzky, who holds or shares 51
NHL records. "There's no urgency to do it."
</P>
<P>
The swiftness is what makes it so special. Gretzky is scoring points 126
percent faster than Howe. If he plays the same number of games (1,767) and
continues this pace, he would finish with 4,196 points.
</P>
<P>
At similar paces in their quests, Hank Aaron would have hit 1,614 home runs in
breaking Babe Ruth's record of 714 and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar would have scored
71,007 points (a 67.9 average) in breaking Wilt Chamberlain's National
Basketball Assn. record of 31,419.
</P>
<P>
That's why Howe realized shortly after he began playing that Gretzky would
easily top his records.
</P>
<P>
"When he started pumping out 200 points, 80 goals, you knew it wasn't going to
last long," Howe said. "One year he got 215 points and that was 85 more than
the next guy. I got 85 points one year and broke a record."
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's been scoring so fast that he's been the league's MVP in nine of 10
seasons since joining the NHL. He has seven scoring titles, was an All-Star in
all 10 years and has been MVP of the Stanley Cup playoffs twice.
</P>
<P>
Howe, Gretzky's idol, took over the all-time scoring lead from Montreal's
Maurice Richard on Jan. 16, 1960, when he scored his 947th point. Howe said he
didn't recall a big fuss being made.
</P>
<P>
"I can't remember. I played 32 years without a helmet," he said, adding in his
years with the World Hockey Association.
</P>
<P>
Joe Malone led the NHL in scoring in its first year, 1917-18, but was overtaken
in career points the next season by Cy Denneny. Malone went back ahead in
1919-20, but Denneny overtook him again in February of 1923.
</P>
<P>
Howie Morenz took the lead in 1931 and was passed by Nels Stewart in 1937-38.
Bill Cowley went ahead in 1945-46 and Elmer Lach went in front in 1952-53.
Richard took over the next season.
</P>
<P>
Now Gretzky has equaled Howe. And he did it in the most special way: against
the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
"This summer we were talking about Gordie's record," Edmonton's Kevin Lowe
said, "and Wayne told me he had a chance to do it in Edmonton. And I'm saying
to myself, 'Wayne's the only guy in the world who would know what the schedule
is in July.' "

OTHERLIVES: GRETZKY: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY BY WAYNE GRETZKY WITH RICK REILLY

It's unlikely we'll ever see a deal in sports to compare with the one that
brought Wayne Gretzky to the Los Angeles Kings in 1988. Gretzky so dominated
the National Hockey League that he had won its Most Valuable Player trophy
eight of the previous nine years; he had not only set but obliterated every
previous offensive record in the book.
</P>
<P>
So why was Gretzky traded? Money, he says here, in his first extended comment
on the deal; the trade had nothing to do with his marriage to aspiring actress
Janet Jones and everything to do with the financial straits of Edmonton Oilers
owner Peter (Puck) Pocklington. Gretzky didn't want to leave Edmonton, he says,
expecting to win the city a few more Stanley Cups -- the Oilers won their
fourth in five years just two hours before Gretzky first learned of the trade
talk -- but Pocklington had to break his personal-services contract with the
player before he could take the Oilers public and stave off possible
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Few athletes can claim to dominate a sport the way Gretzky has dominated. How
many have won their lifelong epithet -- Gretzky's is "The Great One" -- at age
10? That's when he scored 378 goals in 69 games in Little League play (the
next-highest scorer tallied 140), and it was only the beginning of a long
string of triumphs. Gretzky turned pro at 16, landed in the NHL -- his third
pro league -- at 17, and thereafter let his stick do most of the talking. In
the book, he does criticize the occasional coach, but rarely other players, and
is careful not to boast. He says he looks "like the guy who bags your groceries
at the local supermarket," he always finished dead last in the Oilers' strength
tests, and, amazingly, he has poor peripheral vision.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky tiptoes around his experiences to date in Los Angeles. He heaps praise
on the Kings' owner, Bruce McNall; hints at minor problems with coaching and
management, and talks of bringing the Stanley Cup to the city, but says he
still wants Edmonton "to be a home." Hockey fans will get a kick out of
Gretzky, for the author is more voluble here -- credit co-author Rick Reilly --
than his reputation would have us believe.

<HEAD>Wayne Gretzky First Hockey Player to Reach 2,000 Points</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wayne Gretzky, who already holds
almost every National Hockey League scoring record, became the
first player Friday to reach 2,000 points.
   The Los Angeles Kings player hit the mark when he set up a goal
by Tomas Sandstrom at 14:32 of the first period against Winnipeg.
   The game was stopped momentarily as Gretzky's teammates poured
onto the ice and a sellout crowd at the Winnipeg Arena gave Gretzky
a standing ovation.
   Gretzky, in his 12th NHL season, eclipsed Gordie Howe as the
league's all-time leading scorer with his 1,851st point Oct. 15,
1989, in a game at Edmonton.
   He has been the NHL's career assist leader since March 1, 1988,
when he passed Howe's total of 1,049. That milestone came against
the Kings, just five months before Gretzky was traded from the
Edmonton Oilers to Los Angeles. Gretzky's assist total is 1,316.
   Gretzky's 1,000th point also came against the Kings, on Dec. 19,
1984.
   Gretzky's only remaining target is the league's goal-scoring
record. He has 693 goals, fourth on the all-time list behind Howe,
with 801, Marcel Dionne, with 731, and Phil Esposito, with 717.

MIKE DOWNEY: WHEN WILL KINGS LAND BOBBY ORR?

Hockey in July. The guy has got us talking hockey in July. And just so the
general slapshot-happy public can keep everything straight -- although,
remember, this could change in the next 24 hours -- here are some of the few
remaining people Bruce McNall has not yet brought to the Los Angeles Kings, but
still might:
</P>
<P>
 -- The rest of the Edmonton Oilers.
</P>
<P>
 -- Bobby Orr, Bobby Hull or Bobby Clarke.
</P>
<P>
 -- The Howe family.
</P>
<P>
 -- Brian Boitano.
</P>
<P>
 -- That Russian goalie, Tretiak.
</P>
<P>
 -- Anybody born in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
 -- Either Esposito.
</P>
<P>
 -- Czech defectors.
</P>
<P>
 -- The 1980 Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
 -- Mario Lemieux.
</P>
<P>
 -- Pepe Lepieux.
</P>
<P>
 -- Any Detroit player not currently behind bars.
</P>
<P>
 -- Any Sutter brother, Stastny brother, Schmenge or McKenzie brother.
</P>
<P>
 -- Anybody nicknamed Boom Boom, Rocket, Toe, Punch, Tiger, the Cat, Moose or
Goose.
</P>
<P>
 -- Anybody named Guy who pronounces it Gee.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, McNall has gotten around to just about everybody. His latest
acquisition: Larry Robinson, 17-year veteran of the Montreal Canadiens,
defenseman deluxe and another of Canada's national treasures.
</P>
<P>
A million-six? Sure thing. Sign here. How many years you want, Lar? Two? Three?
You got it.
</P>
<P>
Love that Bruce! You gotta love this guy, if you love good hockey players. He
wants 'em, he gets 'em. Oh, we assume that General Manager Rogie Vachon dials
the phone, but McNall is the man behind the scenes, the man with the checkbook
as thick as the Yellow Pages, the man who is going to bring a championship
hockey club to California if he has to sell every expensive black silk suit he
owns and go around the Forum wearing a barrel.
</P>
<P>
McNall is turning into Bob Barker. Wayne Gretzky, come on down! Larry Robinson,
come on down! Kelly Hrudey, come out West! Steve Kasper, Mike Krushelnyski,
John Tonelli, Ron Duguay, Marty McSorley, Chris Kontos, good guys, tough guys,
old guys, unwanted guys, come on out to Bruce's Holiday on Ice! The Kings said,
"California is the place you oughta be," so they loaded up the truck and they
moved to Beverly. Hills, that is. Swimming pools. Movie stars.
</P>
<P>
Larry Robinson will lend a hand to a defense sorely in need of one. L.A. has
enough offense to take a Stanley Cup, but not enough defense, except in goal.
Even if Robinson is not the player he used to be, he was good enough to work
long shifts for Montreal during the 1989 Stanley Cup finals, and in savvy alone
he's an asset. Glad to have him.
</P>
<P>
Canadians (and Canadiens) must be going nuts, though. The sight of Gretzky and
Robinson in Los Angeles uniforms . . . ugh. Picture Magic Johnson playing for
San Antonio. Or how about Chris Evert defecting to Czechoslovakia?
</P>
<P>
Don't you get the feeling, too, that McNall is just getting started? He's got
an offensive super-hero, a defensive wonder, a goalie, a new coach, new
uniforms, a guy with a "lucky butt" as a good-luck charm, Sylvester Stallone at
rinkside.. . . What more could anyone want? A 25,000-seat arena in the Valley?
A practice facility in Palm Springs with hot-and-cold running Molson's from the
faucets? His own TV super-station?
</P>
<P>
McNall has it all. He and Gretzky own a horse together, so it'll probably win
the Breeders' Cup or something. McNall could probably buy a donkey and win the
Preakness, the lucky butt.
</P>
<P>
We thought for a while that the Kings might sign Guy Lafleur, who has been
around so long he calls Larry Robinson Sonny. But Lafleur has signed with the
Quebec Nordiques, proving that there are some guys even Los Angeles can't buy.
</P>
<P>
Montreal center Bobby Smith believes Lafleur is putting too much of a load on
himself. "He's going to be in the spotlight now, and he's going to have the
type of pressure he wouldn't have faced in Los Angeles, let's say, where Wayne
Gretzky and Bernie Nicholls and Luc Robitaille are such great players."
</P>
<P>
We can't help wondering who else McNall might get his hands on before too long.
</P>
<P>
Maybe he will raid Edmonton again. If he can't get goalie Grant Fuhr, who is so
fed up with Oiler management that he announced his retirement at 26, we can
easily see McNall getting his hands on Jimmy Carson, who could play out the
rest of his contract at Edmonton, then sign with the Kings as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
It is no big National Hockey League secret that Carson would love to return to
Los Angeles. He still has a house here. It wasn't Carson's fault that he was
ordered to leave the country in the great Gretzky trade on Aug. 9, 1988. Carson
is an all-star who still might be as good as Gretzky someday, and has a dozen
years or more left to prove it.
</P>
<P>
Boy, this is fun, talking hockey.
</P>
<P>
Let's get this baseball business over with and get back to the good stuff.

GRETZKY SCORES TWICE, BUT OILERS COME BACK TO GAIN A 6-5 VICTORY
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky had two of the Kings' goals as they played even-up through two
periods, but his former teammates, the Edmonton Oilers, typically jumped on
every opportunity down the stretch to come away with a 6-5 victory before a
sellout crowd of 16,005 at the Forum Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
It was a spirited game between teams that played to a standoff in their eight
Smythe Division games last season and then battled to the end before the Kings
eliminated the then Stanley Cup defending champions from the playoffs, winning
an emotional come-from-behind seven-game series.
</P>
<P>
Edmonton Coach John Muckler said: "I thought L.A. played pretty well. It was
like a playoff game. I don't think L.A. can play any harder."
</P>
<P>
The Oilers played hard, too, paying no special heed to Gretzky or his pursuit
of the National Hockey League's all-time scoring record.
</P>
<P>
The emotion of the big trade is starting to fade.
</P>
<P>
"If anything, they're worrying less about me," Gretzky said. "I'm worrying less
about them, too. Both of us are more and more comfortable. We're just playing
the game."
</P>
<P>
Gretzky had trouble scoring a goal against his former teammates last season,
not getting his first goal against the Oilers until the sixth game the teams
played, in March.
</P>
<P>
Not so Saturday night. He got into the spirit of his record chase, those orange
and blue sweaters giving him no pause.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's two goals against the Oilers were his first two of the season, adding
two more points to his career total -- which is now 11 from being the all-time
record in the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky has a total of 1,840 points and is closing fast on the total of 1,850
that Gordie Howe set during 25 years in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
Luc Robitaille, who had a goal and two assists Saturday night, said the team is
not distracted by the knowledge that everyone is watching and counting
Gretzky's points.
</P>
<P>
"There would be more pressure if it was at the end of the season and he had 92
goals or if he was trying to keep one of his big scoring streaks alive,"
Robitaille said. "Then you would have to want him to have the goals. But 11
points? He's going to get those points. The only question is when."
</P>
<P>
Robitialle assisted on Gretzky's first goal, making the pass for the shot that
scooted under the stick of Oiler goalie Bill Ranford, who has replaced Grant
Fuhr since his emergency appendectomy.
</P>
<P>
That first goal, midway through the first period, gave the Kings a brief lead.
</P>
<P>
Only 31 seconds later, Kevin McClelland stole the puck from Marty McSorley and
carried the puck back toward the Kings' goal. Kelly Hrudey came out to meet
him, but McClelland fired the puck right past him to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky scored his second goal 1 minute 7 seconds into the second period,
taking advantage of the power play with Oiler defenseman Kevin Lowe still in
the penalty box for a holding penalty at the end of the first period.
</P>
<P>
The Oilers were about to clear the puck out of their zone when Bob Kudelski
dived to the ice as if he were trying to cover a fumbled football. His body
deflected the puck out to John Tonelli, who sent it across the ice to where
Gretzky was waiting near the left post. Gretzky stopped the pass on his
backhand side, turned, took aim and put a forehand shot past Ranford.
</P>
<P>
Craig MacTavish tied it for the Oilers again at 4:33 of the second, racing up
the left side, passing across to Jari Kurri and then getting the puck back from
Kurri for the shot.
</P>
<P>
Bernie Nicholls put the Kings back on top, 3-2, with his first goal of the
season, scoring on a power play off a centering pass from Robitaille, who
waited until the split second before he crossed the goal line to make the pass,
letting Ranford think he was going around behind the net before making the
perfect pass back to Nicholls.
</P>
<P>
Soon after that, momentum took a turn toward Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen seconds before the Kings could get out of the second period with the
lead, Mark Messier beat Hrudey to the puck and poked it into the net. Hrudey
had gone to his knees to stop a long shot by Lowe. The puck was sitting in a
dangerous spot on the rebound, so Hrudey was scrambling to push it away when
Messier pounced on it to tie the score at 3-3.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's linemate in his Oiler days, Kurri, got the goal that put the Oilers
up, 4-3, early in the third period, scoring only nine seconds into a two-man
advantage.
</P>
<P>
Then a flurry of three goals in less than a minute left the Kings trailing by
two.
</P>
<P>
It was a bad stretch for the Kings, starting with a bad decision by Ken
Baumgartner.
</P>
<P>
At 9:29, Baumgartner decided to pull up near center ice to check MacTavish into
the boards. He took MacTavish out of the play, but he also took himself out,
leaving McSorley facing a two-on-one against Esa Tikkanen and Kurri that ended
with Tikkanen's goal.
</P>
<P>
At 9:50, Nicholls' second goal of the game, a strong shot from the right
circle, put the Kings within one.
</P>
<P>
But at 10:20, Glenn Anderson flipped the puck past Hrudey as Anderson was
falling to the ice with defenseman Larry Robinson on top of him. Both Anderson
and Robinson piled into Hrudey, and they all followed the puck into the net.
</P>
<P>
With 51 seconds left, Robitaille scored his second goal of the night on a power
play.
</P>
<P>
King Notes
</P>
<P>
After missing all exhibition games and the first two games of the regular
season with a pinched nerve in his neck, Dave Taylor plans to play tonight
against Detroit. . . . King center Hubie McDonough was not at the game Saturday
night. He had returned to New Haven, Conn., where his wife, Amy, was soon to
give birth to their first child. . . . Saturday night's game was delayed on
account of snow. Between the second and third periods malfunctioning
ice-resurfacing machines dumped three snowbanks on the ice, causing the fans to
boo and cheer as two machines appeared and disappeared, taking turns trying to
get the ice cleaned. Finally, one of the machines came to life to clean the
ice. The game was delayed about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GRETZKY'S COUNTDOWN TO 1,851 POINTS

</P>
<P>
KINGS' STAR STILL FACING SPLIT-LOYALTY SCENES IN EDMONTON
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Since last he skated for the Kings, Wayne Gretzky has been to Europe, where he
invested in a horse; to New York, where he was host of "Saturday Night Live;"
to Toronto, where he was honored as the most valuable player in the National
Hockey League; to Las Vegas, where he attended the Victor Awards; home to
Ontario, for his charity softball game; back to Los Angeles, where he played
host to a couple of vacationing Edmonton Oilers; to Victoria, Canada, for
another charity appearance, and back to Los Angeles where, Friday, he started
his day as a KIIS-FM guest disc jockey alongside Rick Dees.
</P>
<P>
From there, it was on to the Forum to talk with a small group of reporters
about last summer's trade from the Oilers to the Kings, a trade that ranks
among the biggest in the history of sport and is still being felt -- throughout
the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky calls it a trade that "definitely helped hockey."
</P>
<P>
It definitely helped hockey in Los Angeles. But it didn't do much for Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Edmonton would have traded me to L.A. if they had thought I
would come back to haunt them," Gretzky said Friday. "In that, I think I was
underestimated as a hockey player. They didn't think L.A. could compete the way
we did."
</P>
<P>
Gretzky remembers the weeks before the trade as "an emotional time . . . a hard
time . . . a fun time."
</P>
<P>
And it led into an emotional, hard, fun hockey season.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky is hoping that this season will be a little easier, with less emphasis
on his change of allegiance.
</P>
<P>
But before he skates for the Kings again, he has another of those emotional
scenes to face in Edmonton where, on Aug. 27, he will attend the unveiling of a
bronze statue of himself outside the Northlands Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
It's a statue of Gretzky in an Edmonton Oiler uniform holding the Stanley Cup
over his head.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky struggles with these split-loyalty scenes.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, he said that the exhibition game in Edmonton Sept. 22 might be one
that he sits out.
</P>
<P>
According to NHL rules, players can appear in only eight exhibitions and the
Kings have 11. That means the fans in three cities are going to be sorely
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
The trade has had a profound effect on the Kings' training camp and exhibition
schedule. According to King Vice President Roy Mlakar, camp and the exhibition
season used to cost the Kings more than $250,000. Now, they will make almost $1
million.
</P>
<P>
"I spent the months of January and February entertaining offers from promoters
throughout North America who wanted a game," Mlakar said. "It's big business
now. I tried to put the games in big buildings. In Milwaukee, they have already
sold 17,000 tickets at an average price of $20. . . . The promoter in Cleveland
has already sold 10,000 tickets at an average price of $25. We anticipate a
sellout in Denver.
</P>
<P>
"I won't be surprised if we sell out every game."
</P>
<P>
It also will be no surprise if the Kings open the regular season with a string
of sellouts.
</P>
<P>
At some point early in the season, Gretzky will break the all-time scoring
record set by his longtime idol, Gordie Howe, who scored 1,850 points. Gretzky
is only 14 points away from that.
</P>
<P>
The record will mean that the focus will stay on Gretzky for a while, even
though he's hoping for a little break sometime soon.
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was going to be a hectic, tough year last year because it was a new
thing for everybody," Gretzky said. " . . . Obviously it will be a lot easier
for me this year. It's not as new. The excitement will have died down a lot."
</P>
<P>
But the excitement over the scoring record?
</P>
<P>
"That's the fun part of the game," Gretzky said.
</P>
<P>
King Notes
</P>
<P>
Goalie Glenn Healy, a free agent with compensation, is not likely to be back
with the Kings next season. He is expected to sign with another team, possibly
the New Jersey Devils, early next week. . . . John Tonelli, the only other King
whose contract is still unsettled, is expected to reach an agreement with the
team soon.

IT'S MIXED EMOTIONS FOR OILERS
</P>

<P>
It was another hockey game, but it also wasn't. To the Edmonton Oilers, Sunday
night's game against the Kings was a broiling vortex of emotions.
</P>
<P>
Here was the Oilers' former captain, their current foe; their former leader,
their current nemesis; their former close friend . . .
</P>
<P>
Although reporters had quizzed the Kings' players about the distraction of
Gretzky nearing Gordie Howe's all-time scoring record, when it finally happened
Sunday night at the sold-out Northlands Coliseum, it seemed the Oilers had been
the more distracted.
</P>
<P>
The Kings' thoughts were on winning the game, which they did, 5-4. When Gretzky
got the record-breaking goal in the third period, the Kings swarmed the ice in
celebration.
</P>
<P>
As the game was stopped with 53 seconds left for an awards ceremony, the entire
King team stood by on the ice at a kind of respectful attention, whereas the
Oilers slouched and slumped at their bench, not wanting to watch, but desperate
to participate. For they knew that it had been them, not the Kings, who for 10
years had provided Gretzky that rare hockey climate that allowed him to compile
his impressive scoring statistics.
</P>
<P>
While the Oilers acknowledged Gretzky's achievement with the presentation of a
diamond bracelet, the team honored him later in a more meaningful fashion. The
players who had been his teammates through Edmonton's often-stormy history all
reserved the highest sort of praise for him -- the kind of praise that comes
from men in your own profession, men who labored alongside you and, clearly,
men who harbor a sincere admiration for your accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
In the nearly-empty Oiler locker room after the game, players were saying how
they hated to lose the game, but also how glad they were for Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
Mark Messier, Edmonton's team captain, wrestled with the awkward words that
spilled out as he tried to explain what Gretzky has meant to the city, the
organization and to his former teammates.
</P>
<P>
Eventually Messier abandoned his search for eloquence and put it this way:
</P>
<P>
"We came from a (expletive) expansion organization that went on to win four
Stanley Cups," Messier said. "He had a big part of it. No one here is ever
going to forget it . . . or him."
</P>
<P>
Messier and Gretzky had locked in a sweaty and sincere embrace during the
on-ice ceremony to commemorate the record. Words were whispered. But, for them,
the emotions rendered words inadequate.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't need any words," Messier said, struggling with his anger at the loss
and his joy for his friend's accomplishments. "It's obvious how Wayne and I
feel about each other."
</P>
<P>
Edmonton defenseman Charlie Huddy, a harsh and relentless player on the ice,
seemed washed with sentiment when he spoke of Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
"When I think about all we went through together . . . " he said, shaking his
head. "Wayne will always be a part of it here."

SCOTT OSTLER: THE SEASON HOCKEY BECAME A BIG DEAL
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Trade Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
That's what the Kings must do if they ever expect to become a respectable
hockey club, or any other kind of club. Trade him now, before lunch, before it
dawns on the rest of the league what a fraud he is.
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky calls himself a hockey player? How many times during the playoffs
did he sucker-punch an opponent? Did he even once slash, trip, high-stick or
cross-check -- i.e: execute the fundamentals? He probably doesn't even jaywalk.
</P>
<P>
Wasn't it Gretzky who was supposed to bring this city not only the Stanley Cup,
but also the Stanley Saucer?
</P>
<P>
Fifteen-million bucks for a guy and all he can do is skate and tap a puck
around? What a monstrous gyp. Believe me, I know my hockey, and as I was saying
to a friend of mine at halftime Monday night, Gretzky's got to go.
</P>
<P>
Wait, wait, what am I doing? Let me calm down here, I'm hyperventilating. I
guess I got caught up in the excitement of the Kings' playoff run, and I'm
still trying to deal with the crushing disappointment of the sweep at the hands
of the Calgary Flames.
</P>
<P>
Actually I have to admit that, as a true hockey fan of many, many days, I'm
proud of the Kings. And Gretzky, even though he is suspect as a player -- his
face doesn't even look like a map of the America's railroads -- has shown
potential. He could become a good one. Who knows, maybe even a great one.
</P>
<P>
It seems crazy now, but when King owner Bruce McNall made the trade for
Gretzky, there were a lot of knowledgeable hockey people who said McNall was
making a huge mistake, giving away too much, bankrupting the franchise.
</P>
<P>
All Gretzky did was jack the Kings up from the 18th-best team in the league to
fourth best, instantly revitalize the franchise and convert about 100,000 L.A.
fans to hockey.
</P>
<P>
"Bruce showed a lot of courage making that trade," Jerry Buss said Monday night
in the Kings' dressing room. "You don't just step up to the line with $15
million of your own money like that, plus (Gretzky's) additional salary."
</P>
<P>
Buss, the former King owner, tried hard to make a trade for Gretzky two years
earlier, at roughly the same price, and Buss and Rogie Vachon almost pulled it
off. At the last minute, Edmonton owner Peter Pocklington backed off.
</P>
<P>
When McNall came calling, though, the timing was better, Pocklington was ready
and was blinded by the cash.
</P>
<P>
In the dressing room after the Kings knocked Edmonton out of the playoffs, a
reporter asked McNall, "Does this represent a triumph of money over tradition?"
</P>
<P>
McNall wasn't offended, because he does not offend easily.
</P>
<P>
"That's a good question," McNall said. "It (money) didn't hurt any, did it?"
</P>
<P>
McNall could have taken offense. After all, he initiated and consummated the
trade of the century, put his $15-mil-plus on the line, and brought Los Angeles
a new winner, and now somebody is wondering if he is guilty of crass checkbook
sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
Seems to me that Los Angeles had had just about enough of Kings' tradition.
</P>
<P>
And what's wrong with using cash, along with cunning and courage, to build a
better team? Did anybody criticize the Yankees for buying Babe Ruth? Or the
Dodgers for buying Kirk Gibson?
</P>
<P>
Which brings us back to Gretzky, whose performance this season reminds me of
the time someone asked Yogi Berra if a brilliant rookie had exceeded his
expectations.
</P>
<P>
"He's done more than that," said Yogi.
</P>
<P>
Monday night Gretzky sat at his locker, his eyes red, and said, "It's been a
very tough year, emotionally. A lot has happened in my life the last nine
months."
</P>
<P>
I asked Gretzky if he feels like an L.A. guy now.
</P>
<P>
"I've enjoyed it here," he said, "I really like this building (The Great One
Forum), the atmosphere. People talk about Montreal, Toronto and Edmonton being
great hockey towns, and they are, but the atmosphere here is as good as
anywhere. Everybody involved with this team is excited about it."
</P>
<P>
As for his adjustment to a new city and its culture, that seems to have gone
well. Gretzky, a longtime Boston Celtics fan, has even come to appreciate the
Lakers and Magic Johnson.
</P>
<P>
"Magic's been great to me," Gretzky said. "This city, more than any city other
than New York, can eat you up pretty quick if you forget why you're here. So
many athletes forget why they're doing all the endorsements or making all the
appearances, they lose sight of what they're supposed to be doing. Magic is the
best example I've ever seen of an athlete who knows exactly why he's here. You
just come and do your job. I admire his ability to focus. We've talked and I've
learned a lot from him."
</P>
<P>
I should have known who was behind the Kings' success. Not only should Magic be
voted MVP of the National Basketball Assn., he should be the National Hockey
League's MVP, too.
</P>
<P>
The Kings, meanwhile, need some tuning, they need to make some moves. The Kings
will probably want to send Lucky Butt, the man named Robert who lowers his
pants and sits on the ice to bring the team good luck, to New Haven for
seasoning.
</P>
<P>
There are rumors that Coach Robbie Ftorek will be bounced. Another rumor is it
will be only a reassignment, that Ftorek will be asked to step out from behind
the bench and become the new Lucky Butt.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of cooling off, now that I've cooled off a bit, I'm starting to think
that maybe the Kings should hang onto Gretzky, give him one more chance.
</P>
<P>
Wayne could use a little help, though, and McNall is a fool if he doesn't go
out and get this Mario Lemieux fellow.

GRETZKY THRIVING IN AN UNLIKELY SETTING
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HERRMANN, NEWSDAY
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "zillions of possibilities" in every hockey game, as he calls them, help
make Wayne Gretzky so fascinating to watch and difficult to follow. A center
who eschews conventional skate-it-up-the-middle strategy, Gretzky regularly
surfaces along the sideboards, behind the net or at the edge of the crease. As
he likes to say: "I go where the puck is going, not where it was."
</P>
<P>
That sort of prescient adaptability has made a most unlikely move now seem
perfectly natural. He has elevated a team that always was closer to Mexico than
to the Stanley Cup. He has added luster to a franchise that still hasn't won so
much as a division title or a second playoff round. He has created a widespread
following for the Los Angeles Kings, whose former owner, Jack Kent Cooke, once
reportedly commented on Southern California's 600,000 Canadian expatriates:
"Now I know why they moved out here. They hate hockey."
</P>
<P>
"Hockey has caught on here," Gretzky said after practice one day last week.
"People want to see it, they want to watch it. It's abuzz right now. Everywhere
you go, kids are playing roller hockey outside. There's always groups
petitioning to get more rinks built."
</P>
<P>
More and more, as Gretzky begins his third year in Los Angeles, the Kings have
the look of America's team in Canada's game.
</P>
<P>
Kings' merchandise outsells that of any other NHL team nationwide. It has
sprouted three team-operated memorabilia shops in and around Los Angeles. They
had 36 sellouts last season. They drew nearly 26,000 for a preseason game in
St. Petersburg last month. Their games are televised regularly in Phoenix and
Honolulu, and their 10-station radio network is anchored by a flagship so
strong that it can be heard at home by Edmonton Oilers' owner Peter
Pocklington, whose cash-flow crisis prompted The Trade on Aug. 9, 1988.
</P>
<P>
Three months short of his 30th birthday, Gretzky is encouraged about his team,
content with his family and six-bedroom home in Los Angeles, and undaunted that
his former team won the Stanley Cup without him last season.
</P>
<P>
"Their challenge was to win a championship without Wayne Gretzky. My challenge
was to help hockey go here and win a championship here," he said. "I think that
I've got one of my two."
</P>
<P>
But there is a third, one that might be called Gretzky's greatest challenge:
Can Gretzky's popularity sustain the Kings even after Gretzky is gone? Time and
the Kings' performance will determine whether hockey is a fad or a fixture in
the Forum. It is an issue before team management, which is considering the
future while trying to figure out how to advance past the Smythe Division
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
It is a question made more pertinent by Gretzky's physical condition and age.
He has withstood a great deal of punishment in his 12 pro seasons. Not the
least of which was the cross-check from behind by the Islanders' Alan Kerr in
March. The resulting back injury kept Gretzky out for most of the playoffs.
Although he recovered with a summer of situps, he acknowledges the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
"I hope I can play for a long time, so my kids can come to the rink, watch the
games and really understand what's going on," said the father of Paulina, 2,
and Ty, three months. "But, unfortunately they won't. By the time they're 5 or
6, well, that's five or six more years."
</P>
<P>
After that, it is anyone's guess as to whether Sylvester Stallone and Tony
Danza still will have seats right behind the glass, Paula Abdul will show up as
guest of a player's wife, the lead singer from New Kids on the Block will be
dining at the owner's table or thousands of others will be standing and
shouting every time the red light goes on and the loudspeakers project a chorus
of "I Love L.A."
</P>
<P>
It is hard to forget what happened to the can't-miss soccer interest in New
York once Pele left the Cosmos (and after Giorgio Chinaglia temporarily kept
the fire burning). To put it in Hollywood terms -- with apologies to longtime
Kings fan Jamie Farr, the former Corporal Klinger -- could "M.A.S.H." have gone
on without Hawkeye?
</P>
<P>
There are mixed opinions on the subject.
</P>
<P>
"I always had a problem when I was a kid, getting people to come to (Kings)
games. But once they came, they were hooked. That's the reason why I think
people will be coming back long after Wayne's gone," said Bruce McNall, the
Kings' owner, who paid the Oilers $15 million plus Jimmy Carson, Martin Gelinas
and three first-round draft picks to acquire Gretzky, Marty McSorley and Mike
Krushelnyski.
</P>
<P>
"As long as we're bringing people in, we're letting them in on the excitement
and the enthusiasm of the game," McNall said before leaving for Paris, where he
watched a horse he co-owns with Gretzky win the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe,
Europe's richest horse race.
</P>
<P>
Then again, there is this sentiment about local hockey interest from a Forum
employee: "It's going to degenerate. You know how it is here, people just go
with whatever's hot."
</P>
<P>
Bob Miller, the team's television announcer for the past 17 years, has heard
the latter attitude more than once. "Most people are saying once this guy's
gone, that's going to be it," he said. "But I like to at least be positive
about it and say people are going to at least come out and see what an exciting
game it is regardless of whether he's here or not."
</P>
<P>
People who have been around the Kings for any length of time cannot help but
have positive feelings. With due respect to forwards Marcel Dionne and Bob
Berry, who starred for the Kings in the 1970s, and goaltender Rogie Vachon, who
was named The Hockey News player of the year for leading the Kings to a
105-point season in 1974-75, hockey is a whole new ballgame in Los Angeles now.
</P>
<P>
"We never had any respect in the sports community here until we made the big
trade," said Vachon, beginning his seventh season as Kings' general manager.
</P>
<P>
This year, the players were feted by a crowd of 900 at the downtown Biltmore
Hotel three days before the start of the season.
</P>
<P>
In a bow to last season's franchise-record average attendance of 15,707, the
Kings decided to display fans, not Gretzky or a teammate, on the cover of their
media guide.
</P>
<P>
On his part in fitting hockey into many sun-drenched lifestyles, Gretzky said:
"I think I've helped change some of the habits, but I don't think I've been
totally responsible for that. I think the management and ownership of the
organization have been very responsible."
</P>
<P>
Who's he kidding?
</P>
<P>
"He is the Babe Ruth of his time. The impact he had on Edmonton was dramatic
and the impact he's had on Los Angeles is dramatic," said Paul Staudohar,
professor of business administration at California State University, Hayward,
who has published two books on economics and sport. "I really can't think of a
player who has had that much of an impact. Of course, Babe Ruth did when he
went to the Yankees from Boston."
</P>
<P>
And the Kings' outlook?
</P>
<P>
Gretzky insists his team shows long-term promise. "They're hitting where they
have to hit: the young people. Those are the ones who are coming to the games
and they're eventually going to bring their kids to the games," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think this franchise is going to be very solid and successful for years to
come," said a player renowned for his foresight.

MIKE DOWNEY: LONG LIVE THE KING AND HIS WONDERFUL SCORING RECORD

<P>
Once in a great while, you feel privileged. You get to see something special --
someone special. You get to tell people the rest of your life: "I was there."
You get to describe what you saw, as best you can. Except where Wayne Gretzky
is concerned, seeing is disbelieving. You want to do more than just watch him.
You want to curtsy or bow.
</P>
<P>
After all, he is the King.
</P>
<P>
His stick is his scepter. He must have pulled it from a stone. It has mythic
qualities. It can slash dragons and split armor. It is a sword with a curved
blade, and its justice is both terrible and swift. It should be granted a name
of distinction, like a rifle called Old Betsy, or a baseball bat labeled
Wonderboy, or, yes, if so decreed, an Excalibur-like weapon, full of magic and
might.
</P>
<P>
After all, he is the King.
</P>
<P>
He has divided and conquered two countries. His Canadian subjects cannot help
but forgive him for leaving. They thanked him again Sunday for granting them an
audience. They hailed his return from another land, cried out his name, gave
him encouragement even as he sided with their natural adversaries. They even
bestowed gifts upon him, in celebration of a successful crusade.
</P>
<P>
They still accepted him as the King.
</P>
<P>
Homage was paid to Wayne Gretzky in the ice palace known as Northlands
Coliseum. These people knew something special when they saw it. They asked for
it and got it. Even those in an Edmonton throng of 17,503 who rued the day
Wayne Gretzky left for Los Angeles, who wished for their Oilers to show the
visiting Kings how the game of hockey was meant to be played, found themselves
touched by what happened. There was something so fair and appropriate about it,
something so . . . well, proper.
</P>
<P>
Even the players themselves treated the coronation of Wayne Gretzky as hockey's
all-time scoring king respectfully, bordering on worshipfully. After the goal,
which came with a suspenseful 53 seconds to go and Gretzky's own goalie pulled
from the game, there were tributes from both friends and foes. Gordie Howe's
record was gone for good, and moments such as this were rare.
</P>
<P>
The Oilers sat or stood near their bench, a few looking impatient for the game
to resume, but all polite as could be. Jari Kurri sat on the side rail, legs
dangling a foot from the ice, while Mark Messier rewarded their
once-upon-a-time teammate with a diamond-crusted bracelet. "Presented with
friendship," it was inscribed.
</P>
<P>
As for the Kings, they fanned out along one of the rink's two blue lines and
drummed the icy surface with their sticks, like musicians who salute a
performer by tapping their violins with their bows. A player would have had to
have a face as hard as a goaltender's mask not to be visibly moved by this
scene.
</P>
<P>
Minutes before, Gretzky had broomed a backhand into the net, beyond Edmonton
goalie Bill Ranford's reach, to start the party. Kurri and Messier, his trusty
old friends, occupied the ice at the time. Kevin Lowe, possibly Gretzky's
closest friend among the Oilers, happened to be in the crease, closest to him,
unable to delay the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky scored and then sprang into the arms of the nearest teammate, Dave
Taylor, who has waited longer than any other King for something to celebrate.
Soon they were joined by Bernie Nicholls, Luc Robitaille, Steve Duchesne and
Larry Robinson, who slammed Gretzky into the glass harder than any opponent has
in years. Then came the mob from the bench, given special dispensation to spill
forth from it, for just this one occasion.
</P>
<P>
They were on Cloud 99.
</P>
<P>
All night long, Gretzky had gone through hell and high frozen water, trying to
get the record-breaking point. He took a stick in the eye from Peter Eriksson
and got boomed into the boards by Jeff Beukeboom. He was tripped and flipped.
He whipped slap shots and threw a knuckle-puck that wobbled and flew softly
through the air, bouncing crazily before Ranford batted it down. For one crazy
instant he even went one-on-five, trying to zig and zag, until you said to
yourself, much the way Gretzky himself does on that Bo Jackson athletic-shoe
commercial, uh, "No."
</P>
<P>
What fate awaited the King?
</P>
<P>
Clearly, there were powers at work assuring him that something special lie
ahead. When at last the point would be scored, it wouldn't come in the second
period of a 7-2 loss to the Boston Bruins, or some such thing. It would come in
the final minute of a game in the city that was once King Wayne's private
dominion, and wouldst be followed by a game-winning goal in overtime, just in
case you still weren't absolutely certain that the gods were crazy.
</P>
<P>
Gordie Howe was there, to send in the crown. His successor was the same young
prodigy who used to hang around with Murray Howe, Gordie's youngest son, and
annoy the boy with questions about what his dad was really like. Gordie Howe
could not -- would not -- have hand-picked anyone else in the world to be the
next him. He might as well have taken a hockey stick and knighted Wayne Gretzky
with it, asking him to arise and assume his rightful place in the world.
</P>
<P>
After all, he is the King, and possibly shall be so, happily ever possibly will
be so, happily ever after.

<HEAD>Cable Sports Network To Pay Higher Rights Fees In Gretsky Deal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A regional sports network controlled by Denver
cable-TV magnate Bill Daniels will pay $2.4 million in higher
rights fees as part of the deal that lured hockey superstar Wayne
Gretzky to Los Angeles from the Edmonton Oilers.
   The L.A.-based Prime Ticket network paid the higher prices -- an
increase of $600,000 over four years -- because of the
contributions the star player could make to the network and the Los
Angeles Kings hockey team.
   Daniels said in an interview with the Rocky Mountain News
Tuesday that Bruce McNall, the team's owner, approached him before
the deal to talk about the money that would be needed to sign
Gretzky.
   ``Bruce came to me and said, `Would you raise your rights fees
on the Kings games so that I can come up with the amount of money
we have to come up with to get Gretzky?''' Daniels said. ``My
answer was, `You're damn right.'''
   The increased fees, Daniels said, will be paid only as long as
Gretzky plays for the Kings. The hockey star has a four-year
contract.
   Prime Ticket also agreed to triple the amount of money spent on
promoting and advertising the Kings broadcasts, Daniels said.
   The complicated Gretzky deal is expected to benefit Prime
Ticket, which has an exclusive contract to televise Kings games in
southern California, Arizona, Nevada and Hawaii.
   ``It pleases our affiliates, we'll gain more affiliates and we
can considerably increase the advertising dollars we charge,'
Daniels said.
   Prime Ticket, which also is owned by Jerry Buss, the principal
owner of the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team, is one of several
companies launching a regional sports network in Denver.
   The venture already has signed a deal with the Denver Nuggets to
telecast a number of regular-season and playoff games.
   As part of the Gretzky deal, Prime Ticket agreed to a
significant increase in coverage of Kings games -- from 37 to 60 a
year, said Tony Acone, the network's president.

KINGS SCORE 6-3 VICTORY TO FINISH OFF COMEBACK, DEFENDING CHAMPIONS

Without Wayne Gretzky, the Edmonton Oilers will not be the Stanley Cup
champions. Not this year, anyway. Gretzky and his new mates, the once
futureless Kings, eliminated the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions with
a 6-3 victory in the seventh game of their best-of-seven National Hockey League
playoff series Saturday night before a raucous capacity crowd at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
It's a new era of Kings hockey with the Great Gretzky, who scored the first
goal and the last goal as the Kings completed their comeback from a
three-games-to-one deficit against the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, who set a club record for points in a playoff series, with 12, and
tied a club record for assists in a playoff season, with nine,has brought the
Kings to life. And he has brought hockey to life in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
But to do that, he had to defeat, with some regret, the players with whom he
has shared four Stanley Cup titles. He also had to defeat, with some degree of
glee, the owner who traded him to the Kings last Aug. 9, Peter Pocklington.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky was last in line as the teams skated past each other, formally shaking
hands. He shook hands with most of his old teammates, hugged a few, then gave
his new fans a No. 1 sign as he skated off.
</P>
<P>
"I honestly had a lot of mixed emotions," Gretzky said. "I don't think it
affected me on the ice, but it bothered me off the ice.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy for the people of Los Angeles, for the players here, for the
coaches, and I'm especially happy for (King owner Bruce) McNall. . . . But I
know that no one takes losing harder than (Mark) Messier and (Kevin) Lowe.
Those guys are champions. I enjoyed playing with them. . . . I feel deeply
sorry for what they're feeling now.
</P>
<P>
"Going through the line was difficult. I wanted to talk with them, but I also
wanted to let them alone. . . . Personally, I didn't enjoy the series at all.
It wasn't fun for me. For 15 days or whatever, I saw those guys every day, and
no words were spoken. That's not what life should be about. You're supposed to
be able to talk to your best friends."
</P>
<P>
There were plenty of new friends packing the Kings' dressing room after their
impressive comeback. McNall was about as happy as a man can be on his 39th
birthday. "I felt like a father giving birth to a new franchise tonight," he
said. "I kept flashing back from Aug. 9 up to today. I was ready to cry,
really. I couldn't believe it."
</P>
<P>
After an epidemic of flu helped saddle the Kings with a 3-1 deficit, they came
back to win Game 5 at the Forum, Game 6 at Edmonton and Game 7 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
That's what home-ice advantage is all about. The Kings became only the sixth
team in the history of the National Hockey League to come back after trailing,
3-1.
</P>
<P>
The Kings will open their Smythe Division final series Tuesday night against
the Flames at Calgary.
</P>
<P>
The crowd of 16,005 and then some roared when the Kings skated out. The fans
stayed on their feet while the team skated through warmups, quieted for the two
national anthems and resumed the original roar through the final strains of the
Star-Spangled Banner and the opening faceoff.
</P>
<P>
Folks barely had a chance to settle back into their seats before Gretzky scored
on the first shot of the game, bringing them back to their feet for a frenzied
ovation.
</P>
<P>
It was a moment reminiscent of Gretzky's first game as a King, when a capacity
crowd cheered him onto the ice and then went wild when he scored on his first
shot on goal.
</P>
<P>
But Gretzky was not a one-man show Saturday night. Bernie Nicholls had two
goals, and goalie Kelly Hrudey, acquired late in the season from the New York
Islanders to give the Kings a veteran in the nets for a game such as this,
stopped 31 shots and earned a number of standing ovations.
</P>
<P>
As he held off the Oilers, preserving the Kings' tenuous one-goal lead through
most of the third period, and then continued to stop them when they attacked
with a two-man advantage (after pulling Grant Fuhr out of goal) in the final
minutes, the fans chanted "Hru-dey, Hru-dey, Hru-dey" on every save.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's goal, 52 seconds into the game, came on a two-on-one break, with
Gretzky slapping a shot at the left corner of the Oiler net. Fuhr was kneeling
there, ready for the shot, and he thought he had stopped it when the red light
went on and the crowd erupted. Fuhr glanced over his shoulder to see the puck
trickling in.
</P>
<P>
The Kings' lead was short-lived. Jari Kurri evened the score at 4:48, putting
in his own rebound of a shot he took off a three-on-one break.
</P>
<P>
Chris Kontos got credit for the Kings' go-ahead goal in the first period when
Nicholls' slap shot from the left circle went high and was about to fly past
the Oiler net when it hit Kontos, standing near the right post, and dropped in
behind Fuhr at 11:56.
</P>
<P>
Kontos' goal came on a power play, the result of a holding call on Normand
Lacombe.
</P>
<P>
A holding call on Kontos with just 26 seconds to play in the first period gave
the Oilers a power play at the start of the second period, and the Oilers took
advantage, tying the game again just 34 seconds into the second period when
Kurri centered a pass from behind the net to Craig Simpson, who fired the shot
past Hrudey.
</P>
<P>
Again the Kings went ahead by a goal, taking a 3-2 lead at 6:51 when Dave
Taylor battled for the puck along the right side boards, took the puck into the
right corner and then sent it across the ice to Nicholls, who took the scoring
shot from the left faceoff circle.
</P>
<P>
But again the Oilers tied it up, making it 3-3 at 7:48 when defenseman Lowe
followed up on his own shot and put the puck over Hrudey, who had been knocked
over by Simpson.
</P>
<P>
A shot by John Tonelli on a power play late in the second period hit high in
the back of the Oiler net and popped back out before goal judge Ted Metcalfe
saw it. Television replays from different angles showed that the puck had been
in, and both Gretzky and Nicholls pleaded, but since none of the on-ice
officials had seen it, the goal did not count.
</P>
<P>
Seconds after Tonelli's shot, Craig Muni was called for holding, giving the
Kings a two-man advantage for the 53 seconds that were left on an interference
call on Jeff Beukeboom.
</P>
<P>
Skating five against three, Nicholls put the Kings ahead, 4-3, with his second
goal of the period at 16:23. Gretzky sent him the pass from the left-side
boards and Nicholls went right in on Fuhr, tripping over the kneeling goalie
and then pushing the puck backward, behind Fuhr and into the left corner, while
falling head first to the ice.
</P>
<P>
A clinching goal, making it 5-3 at 14:50 of the third period, was scored on a
45-foot slap shot by Dale DeGray, a King who had not scored a goal since Dec.
21.
</P>
<P>
The Kings' sixth score, a short-handed goal on the net abandoned by Fuhr, was
not extra insurance. It was simply the finishing touch, just one more reason
for the fans to stand and cheer.
</P>
<P>
Nicholls said: "This was my first-ever seventh game, so obviously, it was the
most exciting game of my career. These are the loudest fans of any building in
the NHL. Once you step out on the ice, you get goose bumps. All year, they've
shown support and, hopefully, now L.A. will be a hockey town."
</P>
<P>
King Notes
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the best-of-seven Smythe Division final series between the Kings
and the Calgary Flames will go on sale to the public today at 9 a.m., following
sale by priority numbers at 8, at the Forum box office and all TicketMaster
outlets. The series opens in Calgary, and the first games at the Forum will be
Saturday, April 22, and Monday, April 24. Because of conflicts in the building,
the rest of the series will be announced Sunday after a conference call with
the NHL. Tickets will be $31, $22 and $16. . . . A shot by Bernie Nicholls that
bounced off Chris Kontos and into the Oiler net in the first period gave Kontos
a National Hockey League record for power-play goals in a playoff series (six)
and added to his club record for most goals in a series (eight). . . . Wayne
Gretzky's goal at 52 seconds of the first period gave him 11 points in this
series, breaking the club's playoff record of 10 that was shared by Mike Murphy
(1977 vs. Boston) and Daryl Evans (1982 vs. Edmonton). Gretzky's assist on
Nicholls' second-period goal gave him nine assists in the series, tying the
club record for assists in a playoff season.

<DESCRIPT>  HOCKEY; PROFESSIONAL; LOS-ANGELES; INJURY; PROFILE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Life hasn't been so great for The Great One lately.;   Suddenly, even playing
hockey has become a struggle for Los Angeles Kings center Wayne Gretzky, the
leading scorer in NHL history and generally regarded as the game's greatest
player.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  GRETZKY KNOCKED OFF STRIDE
BACK INJURY, FATHER'S ILLNESS CONTRIBUTE TO NHL
STAR'S SLOW START  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "My play has been nothing less than poor," said Gretzky, who makes his Cow
Palace debut when the Kings visit the Sharks tonight. "I haven't contributed
what I should to this hockey club. The way I'm going right now, they might
release me by January.";   Sure. And the Sharks might win the Stanley Cup.;
Gretzky, bothered by a sore back early in the season, has five goals and 12
assists in 15 games. Those would be good numbers for a lot of hockey players,
but not for a guy who has never had fewer than 137 points in 12 NHL seasons.;
 Gretzky's difficulties haven't been limited to on-ice tribulations, however.;
  On Oct. 16, his father, Walter, suffered a brain aneurysm. It was a severe
blow to Gretzky, who left the team and missed five games to be with his
father.;   "Everybody faces adversity in their lives, but this is really the
first case in our family," Gretzky told Bay Area reporters during a conference
call from Los Angeles on Monday. "For 30 years, my father has been my best
friend. We have a tremendous relationship. When that is taken away from you,
it's very difficult.";   Gretzky said he traveled from L.A. to Toronto to
visit his father Sunday, and said Walter has made a lot of progress.;
"Physically, he's almost 100 percent," Gretzky said. "But mentally, he has
short-term memory losses. He can remember a lot of things from the past, but
he can't remember things from the last couple of months or weeks. It's a
day-to-day thing, and we just don't know what the outcome will be.";
Gretzky, 30, refuses to use his father's illness as an excuse for his slow
start, but Sharks Coach George Kingston said he is certain the situation has
taken a toll on Gretzky.;   "He's a very sensitive and family-oriented guy,"
Kingston said. "He and his father are very close, and I'm sure he has been
worried and concerned. It's completely understandable that he wouldn't be at
the top of his game.";   Even before his father became ill, Gretzky was
struggling. He suffered a back injury Sept. 14 when he was checked by Gary
Suter during a game in the Canada Cup tournament, and the injury was bothering
him when the Kings opened the regular season Oct. 4. Gretzky went six games
without a goal at the start of the season, marking the longest season-opening
dry spell of his career.;   His teammates also have struggled. The Kings, the
Smythe Division champions last season, are 8-7-5 overall and 0-4-2 in their
last six games.;   "I still feel we're an extremely good hockey team," Gretzky
said.;   But the Kings aren't playing with the same confidence they had last
season, when they rolled to a 46-24-10 record, Gretzky added.;   Still, he is
handling the situation in his typically positive manner.;   "I'm not
frustrated," he said. "Disappointed would be a better word. I love to play.
It's a challenge for me. A lot of people have written us off, but I'm sure
we'll get through this. I'm excited about it.";   And somehow, you know that
life for The Great One is going to be great again soon.; A GRIND FOR THE GREAT
ONE; Los Angeles Kings center Wayne Gretzky, generally regarded as the
greatest hockey player in history, is having a difficult season. Here's a
rundown:; (box) SEPT. 14 -- Gretzky suffers a back injury when he is checked
by Gary Suter during the Canada Cup tournament. The injury causes Gretzky to
miss most of the Kings' exhibition games, and he still is nursing the injury
when the regular season begins Oct. 4. He goes six games without a goal at the
start of the season, marking the first time in his career that he has needed
that many games to score his first goal.;   (box) OCT. 16 -- Gretzky's father,
Walter, suffers a brain aneurysm. Gretzky leaves the Kings and misses five
games to be with his father.;   (box) TODAY -- Gretzky has only five goals and
12 assists in 15 games entering his Cow Palace debut against the Sharks.; --

<DATELINE>EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hockey's Wayne Gretzky made good on his
nickname, ``The Great One,'' by slamming in his 1,851st point to
make him the National Hockey League's all-time leading scorer.
   Gretzky erased Gordie Howe's record of 1,850 points with two
goals and an assist Sunday in leading the Los Angeles Kings to a
5-4 overtime victory over the Edmonton Oilers, his former team.
   Howe earned his 1,850 points over 26 seasons. Gretzky beat his
record during his 11th season.
   The sellout crowd of 17,503 in the Northlands Coliseum, many of
whom walked by Gretzky's statue on the way in, roared and roared.
But Gretzky almost didn't make it through the game.
   ``I almost didn't play the third period,'' said Gretzky, who
complained of dizziness. ``I got my bell rung a couple of times.''
   When he made the second record-setting point, Gretzky leaped
into the air and was surounded by his teammates. The crowd gave him
an ovation that lasted more than two minutes.
   The game was stopped as Howe, NHL president John Ziegler and
Mark Messier, who succeeded Gretzky as captain of the Oilers,
presented him with gifts marking the occasion, including a diamond
bracelet containing 1.851 carats.
   ``An award such as this takes a lot of help,'' Gretzky told the
crowd. ``Both teams that are here today are a big part of these
1,800 points.''

<TEXT>     "I can't root for those guys," Ferreira said the other day. "I'm supposed
to be starting a rivalry with them.";    The Kings have clinched first place
in the Smythe Division, marking the first division title in franchise history.
But Ferreira's sentimental choice for the Stanley Cup is the Calgary Flames
because he was a scout for the Flames in the early 1980s and helped build the
team that won the Cup in the 1988-89 season.;    Calgary's road to the final
is full of obstacles, however. The Flames open the playoffs against the
defending Stanley Cup champion Edmonton Oilers, and the winner of that series
will face the Kings in the second round if the Kings beat the Vancouver
Canucks in another first-round series.;    And although the Kings have never
advanced past the second round, they appear to be legitimate contenders this
season.;    Just don't expect Ferreira to root for them. It hasn't taken him
long to catch on to the Bay Area-L.A. rivalry.;  SHADES OF BLUE: Former San
Jose resident John Blue is playing for the Maine Mariners, an American Hockey
League affiliate of the Boston Bruins.;    Blue, a goalie who was on the 1988
U.S. Olympic team and led a U.S. squad to a victory over the Soviet national
team in an exhibition game in Oakland last summer, has been with the Mariners
since March 5, when he was sent there on loan from the Minnesota North Stars'
organization.;    Blue is 2-4-1 for the Mariners and has allowed an average of
2.57 goals per game.;  AROUND THE NHL: The public-relations department of the
Chicago Blackhawks is working overtime to push players for postseason awards.
The Hawks have mailed out clippings to promote goalie Ed Belfour for the
Calder Cup as the NHL's rookie of the year, Steve Larmer and Dirk Graham for
the Selke Trophy as the best defensive forward and Chris Chelios for the
Norris Trophy as the best defenseman. Belfour also is a candidate for the
Vezina Trophy as the league's No. 1 goalie. If he wins the Calder and the
Vezina, Belfour would become the fourth goalie to accomplish the feat. The
others were Hall of Famers Frank Brimsek (Boston Bruins, 1939) and Tony
Esposito (Chicago, 1970) and current Pittsburgh Penguins goalie Tom Barrasso
(Buffalo Sabres, 1984). . . . The Quebec Nordiques are expected to spend about
$200,000 on a huge light and sound show to mark Guy Lafleur's final NHL game
tonight. Fittingly, the Nordiques will face Lafleur's former team, the
Montreal Canadiens. . . . Rookie center Stephane Morin of the Nordiques
already is thinking about what life will be like with Eric Lindros, the
talented center who is expected to be Quebec's No. 1 pick in June's entry
draft. Morin moved to left wing for a recent game against Edmonton and had
four assists in a 7-6 loss. "It was the first time I've ever played left
wing," Morin said. "Maybe next year when Lindros is here, the coach will put
me on left wing with him. I like left wing." . . . Kings center Wayne Gretzky,
who just invested in a Honus Wagner baseball card worth nearly a half-million
dollars, has started a hockey card collection for his 2-year-old daughter,
Paulina. But this collection has only one card -- an autographed version of
the first card picturing Gretzky in a Los Angeles uniform. Gretzky says it's
the only copy of that particular card that he will sign, which should make it
quite valuable.;  SHARK BITES: The Sharks announced Saturday that they have
selected the Kansas City Blades as their top minor league affiliate. The
Blades presently are an independent franchise in the International Hockey
League. . . . Ferreira also said the Sharks may follow the lead of the Kings
and invest in a private jet. The Kings have traveled in their own plane this
season, and players have said the convenience has been worth several points in
the standings.;  SHOPPING FOR VALUE; Who is the most valuable player in the

KINGS LIMP INTO CALGARY, LEAVE GRETZKY BEHIND

<TEXT>
<P>
With the injured Wayne Gretzky a doubtful participant, the battered Kings open
the NHL Smythe Division playoffs Wednesday night against the defending Stanley
Cup champion Calgary Flames.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, sidelined after absorbing a hard check from Alan Kerr of the New York
Islanders on March 22, is one of six injured Kings. That's hardly encouraging
considering the Kings' 8-4 loss to the Flames in the season finale Sunday night
and a healthy Los Angeles team's playoff loss to Calgary last season in four
straight games.
</P>
<P>
"At this point, we do not expect to have Gretzky back in the lineup on
Wednesday," Coach Tom Webster said Monday before the Kings -- without Gretzky
-- left for Banff, Alberta, to prepare for the first-round series.
</P>
<P>
"I've no idea when Wayne will return," Webster said. "We just have to take it
day by day."
</P>
<P>
Team officials say Gretzky, who won his eighth NHL scoring title this season,
has spasms and a hyperextension of the back. But they haven't ruled out the
possibility, however remote, that he may play Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
"Wayne continues to be treated in Los Angeles, and remains on a day-to-day
basis," team physician Dr. Steve Lombardo said.
</P>
<P>
The other injured Kings are forwards John Tonelli, Dave Taylor and Steve Kasper
and defensemen Larry Robinson and Tom Laidlaw. All missed Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
"We do expect to have Robinson back, hopefully Tonelli and Kasper, too," said
Webster, himself recovering from an inner ear operation. "But both Tom Laidlaw
and Wayne Gretzky are big question marks."
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, who likened the Kerr check to being rear-ended in an auto accident,
had 40 goals and 142 points this season. Those were the worst numbers he has
posted since getting 137 points as a rookie in 1979-80.
</P>
<P>
His absence would be a severe blow to the fourth-place Kings, whose 75 points
this season surpassed only the Islanders' 73 among the NHL's 16 playoff teams.
</P>
<P>
"Gretzky is the best player in the world," Kings goaltender Mario Gosselin
said. "With him in the lineup, it changes the way the other team plays against
you."
</P>
<P>
Despite the injury, some of the Flames wonder if the questions concerning
Gretzky might be a ploy to throw them off their game.
</P>
<P>
"It could be," forward Theoren Fleury said. "The only guys that know are the
Kings. We can't be worried if he's going to be playing or not. We have to focus
on us and how well we're going to play."
</P>
<P>
The first-place Flames, whose 99 points are second-best in the league, will
host the first two games of the best-of-seven series. After Friday night's
second game at the Olympic Saddledome, the series shifts to Inglewood, where
games three and four will be played Sunday and next Tuesday. The teams would
alternate sites for games six through seven, as needed.
</P>
<P>
That rotation also would hold for the other Campbell Conference series.
</P>
<P>
In the other Smythe Division series, Winnipeg opens at Edmonton, where Gretzky
led the Oilers to four Stanley Cups in 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In the Norris Division, regular-season champion Chicago is host to Minnesota
and Toronto visits St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
The Wales Conference playoffs start Thursday night, with the second game in
each series set for Saturday. Games three and four would be Monday and next
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Boston Bruins, whose 101 points led the league, are at home against
Hartford to open the first round in the Adams Division. Montreal, a loser to
Calgary in the Stanley Cup final last year, opens at Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
In the Patrick Division, the Islanders open at the New York Rangers.

GRETZKY FAMILY: KING STAR DID NOT FORGET HIS PARENTS ON HIS PATH TO NATIONAL
HOCKEY LEAGUE STARDOM.

<P>
Walter and Phyllis Gretzky arrived in Edmonton Sunday morning in plenty of time
to see their oldest son break Gordie Howe's National Hockey League scoring
record.
</P>
<P>
With Walter busy escorting Wayne's horse, Golden Pheasant, to the prestigious
Arc de Triomphe race in Paris last weekend. And with a longstanding commitment
to be at a wedding Saturday, they took a chance that Wayne would not get five
points against the Vancouver Canucks Friday night. They were right. He made
three points to close to within two, saving the record for the city in which he
scored most of his points.
</P>
<P>
"It had to happen in Edmonton," Walter said with a knowing nod. "For one thing,
that's the way Wayne had it figured. Besides, it's more fitting, and that's
just the way things happen for Wayne.
</P>
<P>
"It's as if his life has been prewritten. If you go over all the things that
have happened in his life, one thing after another, it's as if it was destiny.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, it's a bit eerie. It's unbelievable."
</P>
<P>
His own father finds his golden touch unbelieveble? "I'm amazed at him," Walter
said.
</P>
<P>
And proud of him. Not only for the goals and the assists, but for the way he
has handled himself through all the success.
</P>
<P>
Walter likes to tell of the night that Wayne scored his 50th goal in the 39th
game of the 1982 season.
</P>
<P>
The family had planned to be at the game Wayne scored his 50th goal, knowing
that it would be well under the milestone of 50 goals in 50 games. But Wayne
was five goals away going into the 39th game, and Walter figured he wouldn't
get it at the game at Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
After the game, Wayne phoned home to Brantford, Ontario, with the news. He told
Walter, who said something like, "You did it, heh?" And then Wayne said he had
better get going because "all those people" were waiting.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky had let reporters, TV crews, the owner and all wait while he called
home.
</P>
<P>
"I was so happy, but when I thought about it, I was more happy about the call
than the record," Walter said. "Think about it. He was a young man who had just
done something incredible, and everyone around him was all excited. But he took
time, first, to call his mum and dad.
</P>
<P>
"I've wondered from time to time if I would have done the same thing. I would
have remembered them, but I don't know whether I would have thought of them at
that particular moment."
</P>
<P>
The Gretzky family is close, and has always been closely involved with the
boys' hockey.
</P>
<P>
Walter played junior hockey, but was too small to make it as a pro. Which is
what everyone used to tell Wayne. But Walter, who is a telephone company
technician, taught his son all the tricks a little player needs. He taught him
to play smart.
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, he tried to instill in Wayne a work ethic. He stressed the value
of perseverance and dedication.
</P>
<P>
In a TV special after Gretzky's first season as a King, Walter said: "I've seen
him spend hours and hours and hours that no other boy would do, just practicing
one little move. Sometimes he spends a year or two before he'll even try
something in a game."
</P>
<P>
Wayne was practicing shooting even before he could skate.
</P>
<P>
"Wayne used to slide around on a slick pine wood floor in his socks, pretending
that he was skating, and he'd use a little souvenir stick to shoot a ball into
a goal in the house.
</P>
<P>
"My mum, (Wayne's grandmother Mary, who died last December) would sit in a
chair with a goalie stick playing goalie for him. She was a hockey fanatic long
before Wayne came along."
</P>
<P>
Walter built a rink in the back yard and taught Wayne to skate. The Gretzkys
have film of Wayne skating at 2, not at all unusual for kids in Canada. And he
was playing hockey when he was 4.
</P>
<P>
Once he scored his first goal, at 6 in a league for 10-year-olds, it started to
happen. Everything started to fall into place.
</P>
<P>
There was a manifest destiny to Gretzky's hockey career.
</P>
<P>
Walter swears he wasn't a pushy father. He didn't make Wayne log all that time
in the back yard.
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't the kind of kid you would have to send out to practice," Walter
said. "With Wayne, you'd have to make him come in. I'd be out there yelling,
'Don't be shooting at the side of the house. Look what you've done to the
foundation!' "
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long before his brothers were out there with him.
</P>
<P>
Only one brother, Glenn, who works in real estate in the Edmonton area, was at
the game Sunday night to see Wayne set the record. Glenn's hockey days are over
now. Keith (The Great One's brother who has been dubbed The Good One) is with
the Buffalo organization and playing with the Phoenix Roadrunners of the
International Hockey League. Brent, who is another good one, is still playing
Junior A hockey in Belleville.
</P>
<P>
Wayne's sister Kim was not in Edmonton Sunday, although Walter's sister, Ellen,
was. Ellen, who has Down Syndrome, lives with Walter and Phyllis since the
death of her mother. Gretzky's wife Janet Jones also was in attendance.
</P>
<P>
The home of Walter and Phyllis Gretzky is unpretentious, but has turned into
something of an unofficial Gretzky museum.
</P>
<P>
Lined up among the wall-to-wall trophies, plaques and framed photographs are
more than 200 of what Walter calls "special" sticks commemorating records or
titles or hat tricks . . .
</P>
<P>
Walter will be toting home more memorabilia after the ceremonies here Sunday
and the ceremonies scheduled at the Forum Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
King owner Bruce McNall found Walter Sunday morning in the lobby of the hotel
where the team was staying, before Walter had had the opportunity to make
contact with his son. McNall started to fill him in on the plan for the
ceremony, saying, "Wayne wants me to take you down so that you can go out on
the ice . . . "
</P>
<P>
Walter collapsed into the chair behind him. "No!," he said. "Wayne wants me to
go out on the ice? Me? It was Wayne's idea? Oh, my goodness."

TEAMMATES HAPPILY JOIN GRETZKY'S CHASE
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As Wayne Gretzky embarked anew Thursday night on his pursuit of Gordie Howe's
National Hockey League scoring record, his teammates looked forward to sharing
the experience.
</P>
<P>
"I think, if anything, it will help us," defenseman Marty McSorley said. "When
great things happen, you can't help but enjoy it and feel a part of it,
especially if it's something as big as this."
</P>
<P>
In the first few weeks of his 11th NHL season, Gretzky is expected to eclipse a
record that required Howe 26 seasons to accumulate.
</P>
<P>
His assist on rookie Hubie McDonough's second-period goal Thursday night at the
Forum in the Kings' season-opening 4-2 win over the Toronto Maple Leafs left
him only 13 points shy of breaking Howe's all-time record of 1,850 points.
</P>
<P>
"What he's done in 10 years is unbelievable, and everybody knows it," teammate
Luc Robitaille said. "But once he gets (the record), it will be the cherry on
the sundae.
</P>
<P>
"I remember watching on TV that one year (1982, Gretzky's third season) when he
beat Phil Esposito's record for goals (with 92 in one season, 16 more than
Esposito's 11-year-old record). I couldn't believe it.
</P>
<P>
"But being there on the ice -- or on the bench -- is going to be something.
It's a tough feeling to describe. You just say, 'Wow, how could he keep doing
it for so long, every year doing the same thing?'
</P>
<P>
"It's an amazing thing. You play one year with him and you know he's great, but
you look (at the statistics) and say, 'That's a lot of points.' He really is
incredible."
</P>
<P>
His teammates, obviously, don't begrudge Gretzky his extraordinary
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
"He's the type of player you want to help achieve those goals," Robitaille
said. "A lot of times stars are just (jerks). Don't write that, but that's the
truth. And he's not like that."
</P>
<P>
But will Gretzky's pursuit of the record, and the hoopla surrounding it, become
a distraction to the Kings, who have set their sights on a Stanley Cup
championship?
</P>
<P>
Robitaille thinks not.
</P>
<P>
"Because it's not goals," he said. "When it's goals, you feed the guy because
you want him to score and he might feel (pressured). This is points. You might
get mad if he gives you a pass and you miss an empty net, but we know he's
going to get the record, so I don't think it will disturb the team."
</P>
<P>
If it does prove to be a distraction, "it will be a good distraction," Tom
Laidlaw said. "There's a lot expected of the team this year and maybe this will
take some of the pressure off the team and put it on Wayne's shoulders, which
will be tough on Wayne. But he's been under pressure since he was 12 years old,
so he's used to it."
</P>
<P>
It seems that, almost from the time he established a record with a staggering
212 points in only his third NHL season -- a record he broke in 1986 -- Gretzky
has been asked about the inevitability of beating Howe's record.
</P>
<P>
Still, when it finally happens and Gretzky passes Howe, it will be a special
moment, McSorley said.
</P>
<P>
When Gretzky eclipsed Howe's record for assists in a 5-3 Edmonton Oiler victory
over the Kings on March 1, 1988, "everybody on the team ran over and had their
pictures taken with Wayne and the puck," said McSorley, who also was Gretzky's
teammate at Edmonton. "Nobody said a lot, but you sat there quietly and
realized the magnitude of it."
</P>
<P>
When Gretzky gets within a few points of this record, McSorley expects the
pressure on Gretzky to increase dramatically.
</P>
<P>
Not from the fans or the media, but from the opposition.
</P>
<P>
"The guys who are checking him aren't going to want to be the guy who is burned
for the big point," McSorley said. "And no goaltender is going to want to be
the answer to a trivia question.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody will be bearing down and everybody will be conscious of it."
</P>
<P>
That includes his teammates, who seemingly will relish any small part they
might play in it.
</P>
<P>
"I've played with some great players -- Phil Esposito, Carol Vadnais, Barry
Beck -- but obviously Wayne's in a different class," Laidlaw said. "Obviously,
the ultimate is to win the Stanley Cup, but to be a part of things like this is
something you can talk about 20 years down the road, when you're sitting out on
your front porch in a rocking chair."

OILERS ARE NOT UNBEATABLE IN EDMONTON, BUT KINGS WILL HAVE TO PROVE IT

EDMONTON, Canada
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is not the habit of the Edmonton Oilers to lose playoff games at the
Northlands Coliseum. They didn't do so last year and they haven't done so this
year. In fact, they've won 14 straight on their home ice.
</P>
<P>
Which is not to say the Oilers can't be beaten in Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
"Oh, they've lost there before," Coach Robbie Ftorek of the Kings said.
</P>
<P>
Tonight, Ftorek is going to have to find a way for them to be beaten again if
the Kings are not to be ousted from the National Hockey League playoffs.
</P>
<P>
The Kings are going into Game 6 of the Smythe Division semifinal playoff series
trailing, three games to two. One more win by the Oilers and the Kings can go
on vacation.
</P>
<P>
The Kings keep harking back to the two games they won up here at the end of the
regular season. Granted, those were not playoff games, but by winning them the
Kings did remove the invincible tag from the defending Stanley Cup champions.
</P>
<P>
Still, no one understands the confidence the Oilers have in their playoff
streaks and the advantage they have on their home ice better than the players
who once played there.
</P>
<P>
"They have the best ice in the league," Wayne Gretzky said. "They thrive on
that ice."
</P>
<P>
Marty McSorley pointed out that the fans in the Forum are louder than the fans
in Northlands Coliseum, but said there is an intensity and a seriousness about
hockey at the Northlands that cannot be denied.
</P>
<P>
Yet, when the subject of fast, open ice was mentioned, McSorley thought for a
minute, admitted that the Oilers are fast, then added: "We have a lot of speed
on our team. We've scored more goals in the league this year than anyone. If
they want to turn it up a notch, fine. We'll have a shootout. We have some guys
who would be very happy to oblige."
</P>
<P>
In playing the Oilers, it is Edmonton's patience and discipline that the Kings
have to keep trying to match. These have not been high-scoring games. Said
Gretzky: "We felt like we have played pretty well throughout the series. There
hasn't been a dominant team."
</P>
<P>
The last time the Kings came to town for a playoff game against the Oilers,
their chartered plane left Los Angeles two hours after their game at the Forum
and they did not get to their hotel here until 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
They lost on each of the next two nights.
</P>
<P>
This time, after beating the Oilers in Game 5 at the Forum Tuesday night, the
Kings were allowed to go home and get a good night's sleep, skate at their own
practice rink the next morning, then catch a 1 p.m. charter that put them here
early Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky called that plan "a lot more reasonable."
</P>
<P>
Ftorek said that travel plans were changed because some of the players didn't
like the all-night travel.
</P>
<P>
Once again the columnists are wondering, in print, why Ftorek is the coach of
the Kings and how long he will keep the position.
</P>
<P>
His contract runs only through the end of this season, so the questions to
owner Bruce McNall are whether he wants Ftorek back, whether Ftorek's future
depends on the outcome of the playoffs, and when these things will be decided.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't even talked about it," McNall said. "Robbie is busy with the
playoffs right now, and we won't sit down and talk about it for a while. My
plan is to take a couple of weeks after the season and evaluate all personnel.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has been decided at this point. I don't even know what Robbie wants to
do."
</P>
<P>
John Tonelli, the oldest of the Kings and the man with the most playoff
experience gave the Kings a lift by starting at left wing on the first line the
Kings sent out Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
But he logged very little ice time after that. He was not 100% after losing a
reported 14 pounds last week while in hospital trying to recover from
complications of the flu, including respiratory problems and high fever.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had put Tonelli out there for the first faceoff to give the team a
psychological boost, Ftorek said: "I would imagine, possibly." That meant, he
explained, that his fellow coaches, Cap Raeder and Bryan Maxwell, seemed to
think it would give the team a boost.
</P>
<P>
"He's sound defensively and he knew he wasn't going to see a lot of ice time,"
Ftorek said. "But he's hungry."
</P>
<P>
King Notes
</P>
<P>
Game 6 of the Kings' playoff series against the Oilers will be televised by
Prime Ticket and broadcast by KLAC (570) at 6:35 p.m. tonight. . . . Chris
Kontos, signed by the Kings as a free agent on March 7, leads the NHL in
playoff goals with six. That ties the Kings' club record for goals in a playoff
series set by Marcel Dionne in 1976 against Boston. . . . With his goal Tuesday
night, Wayne Gretzky passed Maurice Richard to become the NHL's second-leading
playoff goal scorer with 83. Mike Bossy is first with 85. . . . Oiler Coach
Glen Sather was not predicting whether the series would go six games or seven
after the Kings stayed alive in Game 5, but he did take a little jab at one of
his former players, saying, "Marty McSorley said they'd win it in five. We've
already disrupted his plans."
</P>
<P>
If the series goes to a seventh game, the teams will meet at the Forum Saturday
at 7:15 p.m., with the scheduled Lazers' game being switched to Sunday at 11:30
a.m.

KINGS RALLY IN THIRD TO BEAT BLUES, 6-4

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky was too sick for the warmup skate. He was so weak from the flu
that he had to skate short shifts throughout the game. After the game, his
laryngitis was so bad he could barely croak out the admission, between coughs,
that the last few weeks have left him run down.
</P>
<P>
Still he somehow managed to score the Kings' final goal in a 6-4 victory over
the St. Louis Blues Saturday night in front of 17,204.
</P>
<P>
For the first few weeks of the season, all of the Kings were caught up in the
excitement of Gretzky's pursuit of the National Hockey League's scoring record.
Gretzky himself was overwhelmed -- by the games, the entourage, the media, the
extra appearances . . .
</P>
<P>
"That was a big part of it," Gretzky whispered. "It's been a tough week for me.
We've played a lot of hockey games. I've had a lot of family and friends
around. I probably ran myself into the ground."
</P>
<P>
So why did he play?
</P>
<P>
Jim Fox said it best: "Wayne Gretzky at 50% is better than most players at
100%. His being on the ice gets the other team stepping back. I think whether
you're too sick to play depends a lot on how valuable you are."
</P>
<P>
Fox was valuable himself, getting the eventual winning goal -- his first in
this comeback season -- as the Kings came on strong in the third period.
</P>
<P>
Fox gave a lot of credit for the goal, and the big comeback, to defenseman Tom
Laidlaw.
</P>
<P>
The Kings were down, 3-2, after the second period. And Laidlaw didn't like what
he was seeing. So between periods, he spoke up.
</P>
<P>
Laidlaw said: "I just said that, as a team, we have a great opportunity here.
The organization, the coaches, the general manager, have brought together a lot
of talent, and I felt like we were wasting it away . . .
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like we weren't working together. . . . Like we were waiting around
for playoff time.
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of expectations for this team, and it seemed like we were
waiting for it to happen. We needed to make it happen."
</P>
<P>
When the gate opened, Bernie Nicholls came out and tied the score, 3-3, only 1
minute 1 second into the third period. He carried the puck into the Blues' zone
to beat goalie Greg Millen at close range on the play.
</P>
<P>
Nicholls also assisted on the go-ahead goal three minutes later, giving John
Tonelli a perfect pass from the right side to the spot on the left side where
Tonelli could knock it in.
</P>
<P>
Less than two minutes later, Fox scored what turned out to be the game-winner
after Laidlaw sent the puck deep, giving Fox and Craig Duncanson a two-on-one
break against defenseman Gordie Roberts. Fox scored on a sharp angle from the
right as he skated past the net.
</P>
<P>
Brett Hull's second goal of the night brought the Blues back to within a goal
at 9:02. But Gretzky iced it for the Kings, waiting just to the right of the
crease for a pass from defenseman Larry Robinson that he put past Millen.
</P>
<P>
"It was a big question before the game whether (Gretzky) was even going to
play," King Coach Tom Webster said. "That's why I dressed an extra player."
</P>
<P>
Jay Miller skated in warmups but was scratched when Gretzky decided he could
go.
</P>
<P>
"We went with four lines, and I think that helped us at the end," Webster said.
"We have two games in two nights, and we had a few guys under the weather.
</P>
<P>
"Bernie jumped forward when we needed him. It was great to see that. He picked
up the whole hockey team. And Jim Fox. It was nice to get a contribution from
everyone."
</P>
<P>
Luc Robitaille had a goal for the Kings and John Tonelli had two goals after
they switched lines -- Robitaille going with the checking line of Steve Kasper
and Keith Crowder, and Tonelli going with Robitaille's regular line of Nicholls
and Dave Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Tonelli's goal was scored with the Nicholls' line. Robitaille scored on the
power play. All four of his goals this season have been on power play.
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to change things around a little," Webster said.
</P>
<P>
The Kings are 5-3 overall, 3-0 on the road.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky is expected to play at Chicago tonight.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have the zip or the extra legs I would have if I felt good," Gretzky
said. "I just have to play within the limits of what I can do. . . .
</P>
<P>
"Everybody, over the course of 80 games, is going to play sick. That's
professional hockey. I think I should play if I can. I think I give (my
teammates) some room to work."
</P>
<P>
King Notes
</P>
<P>
Mayor Vincent Schoemehl proclaimed it Wayne Gretzky Day in St. Louis in honor
of his recent breaking of Gordie Howe's scoring record. . . . Jim Fox, who sat
out all last season after having surgery on both knees, scored his first goal
Saturday night and said that he would give the puck to his therapists -- Clive
Brewster and Judy Seto of the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopedic Clinic. . . . The Blues
held Denis Savard, Mario Lemieux and Steve Yzerman scoreless in consecutive
games this week. They came within 2 minutes 13 seconds of shutting out Gretzky.
. . . King Coach Tom Webster was wearing his lucky purple socks Saturday night.
The socks are 3-0. Asked why he hadn't worn them when the Kings lost to Boston
Tuesday night, he said: "I wore my purple tie -- I've chucked that sucker."

MIKE DOWNEY: WHEN 2,000TH IS DOWN, THERE'S A LIFETIME TO GO
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hockey lovers probably won't remember forever where they were on the night
Wayne Gretzky got his 2,000th point.
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Gretzky is still so young that eventually we will all be witness
to his 2,500th point. . . .
</P>
<P>
And his 1,000th goal. . . .
</P>
<P>
And his 3,000th point. . . .
</P>
<P>
And his 1,500th goal. . . .
</P>
<P>
And then that magical night around the year 2005 when Paulina Gretzky, just up
from the juniors, joins her Dad on the ice.
</P>
<P>
And then, oh, you know, everybody will start calling her the Even Greater
Gretz, and she'll start scoring her own goals, and we'll start adding onto
their NHL record for father-daughter points, and the good name of Gretzky will
live on and on and on.
</P>
<P>
The night the guy got his 2,000th point?
</P>
<P>
Who'll remember?
</P>
<P>
It doesn't send chills down the spines of Americans -- not the ones south of
the Canadian border -- the way Henry Aaron's 715th home run did or Nolan Ryan's
5,000th strikeout or Pete Rose's 4,192nd hit, partly because hockey is not this
nation's national pastime, but partly because it's just another wonderful day
here in Wayne's World.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky himself would just as soon get this latest milestone over with, so
everybody can go back to concentrating on the rest of the hottest-thing-on-ice
Kings, who beat the Calgary Flames, 6-4, Tuesday night at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
Gretz got an assist on a Tony Granato goal 99 seconds -- yes, 99 seconds; this
guy is spooky -- into the second period, giving him 1,998 points for his
storybook career.
</P>
<P>
And during the final two minutes, Gretzky spoon-fed a pass to Bob Kudelski for
his 1,999th point -- yeah, nineteen ninety-nine -- and little Paulina, seated
on her mommy's lap, really seemed to like it.
</P>
<P>
This means the fresh prince of Inglewood will come up with the big Two Zero
Zero Zero sometime this weekend in Winnipeg, which will be the biggest news
event in Manitoba since a moose got loose in the general store.
</P>
<P>
And Gretz will smile sheepishly and say he couldn't have done it without his
teammates, and he will be sincere. Of course he couldn't have done it without
2,000 sticks and 2,000 pucks, either, but that's the trouble with professional
sports. Equipment never gets any credit.
</P>
<P>
Next day, Gretzky will simply get started scoring his next 2,000 points, which
should take him a little beyond the turn of the century, when hockey will be
played on Astro-Ice with an aluminum puck.
</P>
<P>
Wayne and his wife, Janet Jones, got comfy on Arsenio Hall's TV couch Monday
night, and Janet said she really likes that new aluminum stick her husband has
been using, because it gleams.
</P>
<P>
Just for the record, so does her husband.
</P>
<P>
And, further for the record, let's make sure that everybody knows what a
distinguished achievement this 2,000th point is for the favorite son of
Brantford, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
The next-leading scorer in hockey history is Gordie Howe, who scored 1,850
points.
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky is 29. Gordie Howe, as most of us know, played until he was
something like 65, then collected Social Security checks for a while, then came
out of retirement and played until his 85th birthday.
</P>
<P>
No, seriously . . . know how many more games Howe played than Gretzky? Nearly
900 more, that's how many.
</P>
<P>
The man played hockey before anybody even invented aluminum. He played a long,
long time.
</P>
<P>
And so did Marcel Dionne, who will have his number retired when the Kings
return home Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
Know how many points did Dionne score? He scored 1,771. Know how many more
games Dionne played than Gretzky? Nearly 500 more, that's how many.
</P>
<P>
Young as he is, Gretzky already has set NHL records for most assists, most
games with three-or-more goals, most 100-point seasons, most career Stanley Cup
points, most goals in one season, most assists in one season, most short-handed
goals in a playoff game, most times making a tough shot look easy, most
incredible passes by one man in a career, most fans who still can't believe
their eyes, and, oh, you know.
</P>
<P>
This season, Gretzky is out to get 200 points and take the Kings to the
promised land. So far, it looks as though such goals could be both scored and
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
And the 2,000th point?
</P>
<P>
People won't be talking about it for long. It won't have historic value. It
won't be the stuff of legends.
</P>
<P>
It'll just be another notch on the stick of a legend.

EDMONTON, Canada

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky was nervous before the National Hockey League All-Star game
Tuesday night. It was his ninth All-Star game, but it was special. Not like
those games of the past, the games he played for fun.
</P>
<P>
This game was being played in the Northlands Coliseum, on the ice that was his
during 10 years with the Edmonton Oilers. This game was being played before a
sellout crowd of 17,503 that rocked the building with a stirring ovation when
he was introduced.
</P>
<P>
This game gave him a rare chance to play on the same line again with his old
Oiler teammate Jari Kurri. With Oiler goalie Grant Fuhr in the net. With Oiler
defenseman Kevin Lowe on the team. With Oiler Coach Glen Sather behind the
bench.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky really wanted to win this game.
</P>
<P>
So he did. He charged the Campbell Conference team with the same kind of spark
he has used to jolt the Kings to life this season.
</P>
<P>
Just like old times, he and Kurri raced down the ice to combine for a goal with
a little over a minute played in the game. And the Campbell Conference was on
its way to a 9-5 victory over the Wales Conference.
</P>
<P>
The crowd went wild when Gretzky skated up the right side and slid the puck
across to Kurri on the left side, and Kurri put the puck in behind goalie Sean
Burke of the New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky scored the second goal himself at 4:33, picking up the puck that fellow
King Steve Duchesne had floated in front of the goal for him. Gretzky put his
stick down to stop the puck in his path to the left of the goal, then quickly
scooped it around to the right of Burke.
</P>
<P>
There was no mistaking the pure joy Gretzky felt at pleasing this crowd again.
</P>
<P>
And when he was named most valuable player of the game, he was moved. It had
not been an automatic choice. As Gretzky pointed out: "No one player dominated
the game."
</P>
<P>
Gretzky had a goal and two assists. Joe Mullen of Calgary had two goals and an
assist. Jimmy Carson of the Oilers had a goal and an assist. Mark Messier of
the Oilers had a goal and an assist. Luc Robitaille of the Kings had a goal and
an assist. Kurri had a goal and an assist. Gary Leeman of Toronto had a goal
and an assist. Duchesne had two assists.
</P>
<P>
For the Wales Conference, Walt Poddubny had two goals.
</P>
<P>
Mario Lemieux, the NHL's leading scorer and the man who stole this show a year
ago with six points for the Wales Conference, had just one assist and really
wasn't a factor.
</P>
<P>
Maybe he will be next year, when the game is played on his home ice at
Pittsburgh. This night belonged to Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky figures that having the crowd behind him was worth a couple of votes,
at least, for the MVP honor.
</P>
<P>
"I had a great time tonight," he said. "I don't think I stopped smiling all
night."
</P>
<P>
Explaining that it felt just like old times, he said: "I don't think it really
hit me that I'd been traded until after the first period tonight."
</P>
<P>
Yes, he admitted, he said that with a touch of longing.
</P>
<P>
"I've never denied that I miss Edmonton," Gretzky said. "I've never denied that
I miss my teammates. I won't ever deny that. We won four championships in five
years. We grew up from being a bunch of kids to being the best in the league. I
miss them a lot.
</P>
<P>
"But I'm in a situation now with an owner (Bruce McNall) who is just
outstanding, and I'm with a fine organization. Maybe we can build something
there. I'd like to do that for him.
</P>
<P>
"It would have been easy to sit back here, maybe even win another two or three
Stanley Cups. But I'm also enjoying the pressure and the challenge that I have
now."
</P>
<P>
On this night, though, he relived some of the old glory and allowed himself to
show the emotion he feels for the players he misses.
</P>
<P>
"Ten or 20 years from now, when I look back on my career, there will be times
that stand out," Gretzky said. "The first time that I was back here with the
Kings is a time I'll always remember. Tonight will be extra special. . . . I
think I'll go home and watch the tape."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the Campbell Conference's locker room, there were a lot of other
guys who didn't stop smiling all night.
</P>
<P>
Sather was, of course, very pleased to coach his first All-Star victory. He was
0-4 before Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Duchesne was happy for Gretzky and thrilled with the victory.
</P>
<P>
"Ecstatic," said the French-Canadian defenseman. "I'm ecstatic. Ecstatic.
That's a new word I learned today. That means very, very happy. That's what I
am. Ecstatic. I learned it from watching TV today. I'm ecstatic and everyone in
this room is ecstatic."
</P>
<P>
Getting a little more specific, Duchesne said that he was ecstatic to get the
assist on Gretzky's goal.
</P>
<P>
The game wasn't wrapped up at that point, though. The Wales Conference tied it
on goals by Cam Neely of Boston and Poddubny of Quebec before the end of the
first period.
</P>
<P>
Then the Wales Conference went up, 3-2, just 1:16 into the second period on a
goal by Glen Wesley of Boston. But the Campbell Conference scored three
straight for a 5-3 lead at the end of the second period.
</P>
<P>
It was 3-3 when both teams changed goalies at the game's midpoint (Rejean
Lemelin of Boston relieving Burke and Mike Vernon of Calgary relieving Fuhr),
and then Steve Yzerman of Detroit and Leeman scored just 14 seconds apart.
</P>
<P>
Poddubny scored his second goal of the night early in the third period to cut
the lead to 5-4, and Mullen answered with his second to make it 6-4. Then Mike
Ridley of Washington scored the last goal for the Wales Conference before
Robitaille, Carson and Messier ran up the score.
</P>
<P>
NHL All-Star Notes
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky said that he would give the car he won for being named most
valuable player of the game to a former Oiler teammate, Dave Semenko. "I think
the car should stay here in Edmonton," he said. "Dave was one of the guys who
really helped me in my career." . . . With his goal in the first period,
Gretzky tied Gordie Howe's All-Star career record of 10 goals. Howe scored his
10 in 23 games. Gretzky has scored 10 in nine games. . . . The Campbell
Conference's nine goals tied the All-Star record for most goals by one team in
a game, set by the Campbell Conference in a 9-3 victory in 1983. And the 14
goals set a record for most goals by both teams, breaking the record of 13 set
in the Wales Conference's 7-6 victory in 1984.
</P>
<P>
The Edmonton Oilers announced Tuesday night that they have acquired right
winger Dave Brown from the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for center Keith
Acton and a future draft pick. Brown, 26, has played all five years with the
Flyers. He has three assists and 100 penalty minutes in 50 games this season.

GRETZKY'S COUNTDOWN STARTS SLOWLY;
</P>
<P>
SCORER'S DECISION GIVES HIM LONE POINT AS KINGS WIN WEBSTER'S DEBUT
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Kings made Tom Webster's debut as their coach a success, skating to a 4-2
victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs in the season opener Thursday night before
a less-than-capacity crowd of 15,598 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
It was a successful debut, too, for defenseman Larry Robinson, playing for the
Kings for the first time after 17 years with the Montreal Canadiens. Robinson
led a strong defensive effort and even added two assists.
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, Robinson scored more points than Wayne Gretzky, who is on a
much-celebrated countdown to his destiny as the highest scorer in the history
of the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
As the season began, Gretzky needed 14 points to take the record from Gordie
Howe.
</P>
<P>
After the first game, Gretzky needs 13.
</P>
<P>
Just one point was all he managed against a determined Maple Leaf defense and
goalie Allan Bester.
</P>
<P>
And a most unimpressive point it was.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's first point of the season was awarded, long after the fact -- on a
scorer's decision between periods, in fact -- for a pass that occurred long
before Hubie McDonough scored his first goal as a King to give the Kings a 3-0
lead at 14:47 of the second period.
</P>
<P>
There was a carefully measured cheer from the crowd at the start of the third
period at the announcement of the dubious point that cut the gap between
Gretzky's career total and Howe's career total to 12 for the tie, 13 for the
record to change hands.
</P>
<P>
McDonough's goal was the last of a string of three quick ones in the second
period.
</P>
<P>
With all the attention on Gretzky, the most unlikely heroes did all the
scoring, striking in the second period, after more than half the game had
ticked away without a point for anyone.
</P>
<P>
Bob Kudelski, who spent more time in New Haven last season playing for the
Kings' American Hockey League affiliate than he spent in Los Angeles, found
himself all alone skating through the right circle. Robinson found him, too,
giving him the puck for the Kings' first goal at 10:54.
</P>
<P>
About three minutes later, defenseman Ken Baumgartner got a very rare goal --
unassisted no less -- when he fired a big slapshot from the blue line along the
left side boards. Baumgartner had scored just one goal all last year.
</P>
<P>
It was just 42 seconds later that McDonough wrapped around behind the Toronto
goal and sailed the puck between Bester's knees to help Gretzky to a point.
</P>
<P>
Hrudey was just 17 seconds from getting out of the second period with his
shutout intact when Toronto's John Kordic lifted a shot over Hrudey's
outstretched glove to make it 4-1.
</P>
<P>
Bester had stopped all 14 shots he faced in the first period, including the
lone shot by Gretzky, and had stopped the first five of the second period when
the barrage hit.
</P>
<P>
The Kings had one near-miss in the first period, thinking that they had a goal
by Jim Fox only to have the officials rule that the whistle had blown before he
scraped the puck out of the pileup of Maple Leafs in the crease and put it in
the net.
</P>
<P>
The Kings added to their lead in the third period.
</P>
<P>
Luc Robitaille scored his first goal of the season 17 seconds into a power
play, putting in a pass from Bernie Nicholls. Robinson also assisted on that
goal.
</P>
<P>
King Notes
</P>
<P>
The Kings sold out the season opener a year ago, getting their first sellout of
an opener for Wayne Gretzky's debut as a King. But they didn't repeat this
season, coming up short despite Gretzky's run at the all-time scoring lead. . .
. Defenseman Barry Beck has not yet made his debut with the Kings. He was
scratched for the opener, giving a groin injury more time to heal. . . . Mike
Krushelnyski left the game Thursday night after jamming his left wrist towards
the end of the first period. Bob Kudelski took Krushelnyski's place on the left
side of Gretzky's line. . . . The Kings will play the second game of this
four-game home stand Saturday night against the Edmonton Oilers. They also will
play Sunday night against the Detroit Red Wings. Tickets are available for both
games.
</P>
<P>
GRETZKY'S COUNTDOWN TO 1,851 POINTS
</P>
<P>
Gordie Howe's all-time regular-season scoring record (points and assists) is
1,850. Through Thursday night's game, the Kings' Wayne Gretzky is 13 points
away from breaking that record.
</P>

IT'S NOT EASY WHEN YOUR NAME IS GRETZKY
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<P>
The player with GRETZKY on his uniform and a somewhat familiar face steals the
puck in front of his own goal, skates swiftly to center ice and unleashes a
slap shot that sails into the net.
</P>
<P>
That's about where the similarities end between this Gretzky and his older
brother.
</P>
<P>
Keith Gretzky, 22, is playing for a mediocre Scottish team that doesn't even
have a home rink. Wayne Gretzky, 29, is adding to his NHL-record scoring total
for the Los Angeles Kings.
</P>
<P>
While Wayne is known as "The Great One," Keith has been nicknamed "The Good
One" by teammates and is trying to establish himself as a player.
</P>
<P>
"You can't compare Keith to Wayne," said former NHL journeyman Rocky Saganuik,
now Keith's coach with the Ayr Raiders. "For many years he's been stuck in a
Wayne Gretzky shadow and he hasn't been able to develop as Keith Gretzky. He's
deteriorated, he's rusted out a bit."
</P>
<P>
Ayr has the same black-and-white uniforms as Los Angeles and Keith resembles
his older brother. His style on the ice is similar and he is more apt -- like
Wayne -- to try to poke a puck away than lower his shoulder and apply a hard
check. Both are centers.
</P>
<P>
But Keith lacks the quickness of his sibling and is smaller at about 5-foot-8
and 160 pounds. Once voted the smartest player in Canadian junior hockey, he
simply has not been big enough to survive in the brutal North American game.
</P>
<P>
The name recognition is lower in Britain. As he took the ice recently for the
opening faceoff against the Solihull Barons, a local fan asked, "Who's this new
Canadian they have?"
</P>
<P>
His anonymity did not extend to everyone in the crowd, however. Sitting a
couple of rows behind the Ayr bench was 17-year-old Samantha Walker, wearing a
Kings jersey with Wayne's No. 99 on the back.
</P>
<P>
"I think he's good, but it must be pretty difficult trying to live up to
expectations," she said.
</P>
<P>
The younger Gretzky was not surprised when a journalist asked the customary
question about being Wayne's brother.
</P>
<P>
"Of course that's a problem, people expect a lot," he answered. "I've gotten
used to it -- sometimes it's a pain, sometimes it's not."
</P>
<P>
Keith scored 59 points in 68 games last season bouncing between Rochester of
the American Hockey League and Flint of the International Hockey League, but
asked for a move to Finland at the end of the season so he could get more ice
time.
</P>
<P>
He had six goals and six assists in 23 games for the Phoenix Roadrunners of the
IHL this season when he requested the transfer to Ayr. Still suffering from jet
lag, he had five goals and four assists in his first two games for the Raiders
in mid-January.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky said his hardest adjustments have been to British refereeing, which
players say tends to favor the home team, and to the lack of games.
</P>
<P>
British teams have only a 36-game league schedule and practice far less than
North American counterparts. Ayr is awaiting the opening of a new home rink and
now manages only one practice a week.
</P>
<P>
"It's tough getting used to your teammates when you don't play together that
much. Now I'm mentally getting into it," he said, tucking a pinch of snuff
under his lip. "And I don't know who I'm playing against. When you play against
guys eight times a year that really helps a lot."
</P>
<P>
Saganuik said Gretzky's on-ice savvy will be better rewarded when his teammates
get used to his slick passing, but refused to speculate on whether Keith has an
NHL future.
</P>
<P>
"His life in hockey is in Europe for now and maybe for the next couple of
years," the coach said.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky is not thinking about the future, only about Ayr's struggle to grab the
last spot in the six-team British playoffs.
</P>
<P>
On Super Bowl night he helped the Raiders score two goals in the final 89
seconds to defeat Solihull 5-4 on ice that had to be shoveled between periods
because the Zamboni machine was broken.
</P>
<P>
After a brief celebration in a locker room the size of a kitchen, the player
with the famous name was reminded again that he is not in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
"C'mon, Keith, we'd better go," Saganuik said. "The bus has to be returned by 5
a.m."

C'MON, HOWE HAS HAD ENOUGH COMEBACKS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gordie Howe said Wednesday he would like to wait until his 11-year-old grandson
makes it to the National Hockey League so that he can make another comeback and
play with him, just as he made a comeback to play with his sons, Mark and
Marty, until he was past 50.
</P>
<P>
Let's say his grandson, Travis Gordon, is at least seven years away from the
NHL. Howe would be 68 then.
</P>
<P>
Crazy? Is it any crazier than the talk about him coming back at 61 to play on a
line with Wayne Gretzky?
</P>
<P>
Oh, he was joking about the grandson comeback?
</P>
<P>
So what? This whole furor over his comeback started out as a joke. Or at least
as teasing. He mentioned it first at the Hall of Fame dinner to Richard Gordon,
owner of the Hartford Whalers, the team he last played for and the team he
still works for. Back East, the first flurry of stories concerned a one-game
comeback with the Whalers after New Year's, so he could claim to have played in
six decades.
</P>
<P>
Gordon originally thought it sounded like a good idea, but then started to back
off. Gordon was quoted in the Hartford Courant as saying: "I haven't thought
about all the ramifications. It reminds me of, 'What's a person's last wish?'
</P>
<P>
"I want to do what's right for Gordie. We've got to discuss this with the
general manager, the coaching staff and the players."
</P>
<P>
And when the idea was compared to the publicity stunt that Chicago White Sox
owner Bill Veeck pulled when he sent a midget up to bat, Gordon said: "Are you
saying I'm turning the greatest hockey player into a midget?"
</P>
<P>
It would be hard to pass off Howe's one-game comeback as an attempt to improve
a team and win a hockey game. It wouldn't exactly be a publicity stunt, but it
would be more ceremonial than serious.
</P>
<P>
Gordon turned the matter over to NHL President John Ziegler for consideration
regarding questions of "roster, insurance and league image."
</P>
<P>
When Howe arrived in Los Angeles to await Gretzky's breaking of his scoring
record, he joked in the locker room that he would like to make the one-game
comeback after New Year's and "challenge the little guy to do that."
</P>
<P>
Owner Bruce McNall of the Kings, asked if he would let Howe play for his team,
said it would be a fun thing to do, that the fans would enjoy it, that it would
be an honor for the Kings and that he would like to "accommodate" whatever Howe
wants.
</P>
<P>
Coach Tom Webster of the Kings said it was "a nice idea to try to do something
for this man who did so much for hockey."
</P>
<P>
Through the league, Howe's wife, Colleen, called it "a fantasy which will be
given some further thought."
</P>
<P>
Gretzky has said that if Howe wants to extend his five-decade record to six
decades, he needn't bother. "I think five decades is a safe record," Gretzky
said.
</P>
<P>
With his idol sitting at his side Wednesday, Gretzky was asked how he would
feel about playing with Howe again. Gretzky said: "If there's anyone who can
play at this age, it's Gordie. People say, 'He's 61.' But believe me, I know he
can take care of himself out there. If Gordie wants to play, I'm sure he can
play."
</P>
<P>
Howe has said much the same thing, sort of: "I wouldn't want to just stand out
there. How does John Candy look on blades? If I get there, Walter Gretzky
(Wayne's father) would probably want to suit up, too."
</P>
<P>
Next: Will Walter Gretzky skate with Wayne or wait until Wayne has a son, and
the grandson learns to skate?
</P>
<P>
The first NHL game pitting Soviet players against one another occurred Tuesday
night in New Jersey, and the Calgary imports ended up on the winning team.
</P>
<P>
This was no surprise to Viacheslav Fetisov, one of the two Soviets on the
Devils. Fetisov said of Calgary's Sergei Makarov, who won the Soviet League
scoring title nine of the last 10 seasons and who started his NHL season with
two goals and eight points in three games: "He's a player the same caliber of
Mario Lemieux or Wayne Gretzky. He's one of the strongest offensive players in
the world today."
</P>
<P>
Fetisov and Makarov played together on the Central Red Army team.
</P>
<P>
After the game, New Jersey Coach Jim Schoenfeld concluded: "We're a better team
with the Soviets. So are (the Flames). Especially with Makarov, a damn good
hockey player."
</P>
<P>
Mike Liut lost his ranking as Hartford's No. 1 goaltender last March, so his
start Wednesday night against Washington was his first in more than six months.
Peter Sidorkieweicz started the first two games of the season, and Kay Whitmore
started the third. In the Whalers' fourth game, Liut made 24 saves as they beat
Washington, 4-1. It was hailed as a turning point in his 11-year career.
</P>
<P>
Teammate Ray Ferraro said: "Lootie was kidding that never before has 24 saves
evoked such a round of enthusiasm."
</P>
<P>
Whaler Coach Rick Ley said he does not like a three-goalie system. "We have to
give all three a chance," he said. "But if one guy gets hot, he could become
the man. We'll have to make a decision by the end of the month."
</P>
<P>
Hockey Notes
</P>
<P>
At the end of the first week of NHL competition, the Whalers' Ron Francis was
the league's points leader. His response: "Scary, isn't it? Quick, draw me a
finish line before the other guys catch up." Francis has never had even a
100-point season. . . . Hall of Famer Guy Lafleur had three goals in his first
three games with Quebec. . . . Defenseman Doug Crossman, who played in 10 of
the Kings' 11 playoff games and then was let go in the trade for goalie Kelly
Hrudey, is the Islanders' leading scorer with eight points in four games.
</P>
<P>
Chicago defenseman Dave Manson was suspended for three games by the NHL for
inadvertently knocking official Ron Asselstine to the ice during a tussle with
the Rangers, after Chris Nilan poked Chicago goalie Alain Chevrier in the mask
with his stick. Manson argued that he didn't even see Asselstine: "I only had
eyes for Nilan." Blackhawk General Manager Bob Pulford was amazed by the
three-game suspension and will be watching to see if everyone who touches an
official this season gets hit with three games. By the way, Manson will be back
just in time for the Blackhawks' rematch with the Rangers Tuesday night.

MIKE DOWNEY: FOR ONE NIGHT, AT LEAST, NOBODY IN NHL IS BETTER
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the last period of the hockey season is anything like the first period, the
Kings can go get fitted for rings.
</P>
<P>
There is nothing Bruce McNall would rather be doing next May than be having
breakfast at Tiffany's when the Stanley Cup playoffs come to an end. But like
the rest of us, about all Bruce the Boss can do for now is sit back and watch
and wonder whether another long season will end with another Los Angeles loss.
</P>
<P>
In the Inglewood season opener Thursday night between the has-been New York
Islanders and the wanna-be Kings, there was more than just a chill in the air.
There was hope. Playing shot-a-minute hockey in those 20 minutes, the Kings
outhustled and outmuscled the Islanders, setting the tone for what turned out
to be a 4-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky lit the first red light -- which, if I am not mistaken, has been
written into the National Hockey League charter as mandatory. King Wayne, who
leads the Kings in goals, assists and autobiographies, got another goal and an
assist later in the game, christening the new season with his aluminum-shaft
stick, Excalibur.
</P>
<P>
It was the start of his 13th NHL season and the end of an interesting
off-season for Gretz. A horse he owns ran first in a million-dollar race, and a
book he co-wrote with Rick Reilly had some very interesting things to say about
the Edmonton Oilers, who have not as yet dismantled the statue of Gretzky that
sits outside their arena.
</P>
<P>
What interests Wayne most is where the Oilers and Kings will be at season's
end. As part of an apparent plan to spot Los Angeles a handicap, similar to
horse racing, Edmonton is now doing without Gretzky, Jari Kurri, Paul Coffey,
Jimmy Carson and Grant Fuhr, and is considering a request that Mark Messier
play with one glove tied behind his back.
</P>
<P>
The poor little rinky-dink Kings are bound to make it to the Cup finals one of
these seasons, so how about this season? They close the regular season March 31
at Calgary, and then the fun starts. Or at least that's the general idea.
</P>
<P>
While there were hardly wholesale changes on the King roster, the Forum crowd
Thursday was introduced to Rob Blake, the hotshot 20-year-old defenseman, who
found himself on a line with Gretzky, Tomas Sandstrom, Luc Robitaille and Steve
Duchesne at the time of the season's first goal.
</P>
<P>
Blake is so young that I'll bet Larry Robinson could call him "Toe" without the
kid understanding why. Robinson, who has a son in college, found himself in the
same pairing Thursday with Blake, which probably made Larry feel a little like
Ken Griffey Sr.
</P>
<P>
Although the Kings continue to have as many old faces as new, they did use
rookie winger Francois Breault. Now there's a name for a hockey player. Hockey
players should all be named Francois and Marcel and Jean-Hyphen-something, if
you ask me.
</P>
<P>
The Kings wasted no time putting Blake to work, using him on a power play 41
seconds into the game, when Rich Pilon of the Islanders decided the season was
never too young to start tripping people.
</P>
<P>
Four minutes from the end of the first period, the Islanders found themselves
being outshot, 18-3. That's how frisky the Kings were on opening night. They
made Tom Webster a happy coach on his birthday, playing with zest and
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
But do they have what it takes to go to the Land Beyond Alberta, or is this
going to be another of those years when Edmonton or Calgary get to have all the
fun? The Kings have the greatest player in the game, a generally reliable
goalie, a team plane worthy of Wonder Woman and an entire season, presumably,
with Sandstrom and Tony Granato at their disposal, which might make King fans
forget Bernie Nicholls by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
What they need most to do is be as aggressive on the last day of March as they
were in the first week of October. Nobody ever accused the Kings of being
violent cross-checkers or vicious defensemen. They can't just outshoot
everybody and leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
We shall see. It is only October, and the outlook for winter is bright. Now is
the season of our content.

<LEADPARA>  WHEN THE NHL last had a franchise with a Bay Area address, Gerald Ford was
running the country, Guy Lafleur was unstoppable and the Montreal Canadiens
seemed unbeatable.;   It was the 1975-76 season, and the California Golden
Seals were ending a miserable nine-season run at the Oakland Coliseum Arena.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Special Section  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  CATCHING UP ON THE LEAGUE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  HOCKEY '91. NHL BASICS  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Times have changed, and so has the NHL.;   Sharks have replaced Seals as
the sea animal of choice for Bay Area hockey fans, Wayne Gretzky is the game's
most dominant player and the Pittsburgh Penguins own the Stanley Cup.;   Even
in a league bound by tradition, there is room for change.;   When the Seals
played their final season in Oakland, the NHL was made up of 18 teams. But the
Sharks are team No. 22, and the league is scheduled to grow to 24 teams next
season, when the Tampa Bay Lightning and Ottawa Senators begin competition.;
The teams; The 22 teams in the NHL this season are divided into two
conferences and four divisions:; CLARENCE CAMPBELL CONFERENCE; Smythe Division
      Norris Division; San Jose Sharks       Chicago Blackhawks; Calgary
Flames         Detroit Red Wings; Edmonton Oilers        Minnesota North
Stars; Los Angeles Kings     St. Louis Blues; Vancouver Canucks     Toronto
Maple Leafs; Winnipeg Jets; Prince of Wales Conference; Patrick Division
Adams Division; New Jersey Devils     Boston Bruins; New York Islanders
Buffalo Sabres; New York Rangers      Hartford Whalers; Philadelphia Flyers
Montreal Canadiens; Pittsburgh Penguins   Quebec Nordiques; Washington
Capitals; THE BUILDINGS; The Forum in Montreal is regarded as the sport's holy
land. It's the home of the Canadiens, who have won the Stanley Cup
championship 23 times. It also has been home to such great players as Lafleur,
Jean Beliveau, Henri Richard and Ken Dryden.;      Other famous buildings in
the league include Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, Madison Square Garden in New
York, Chicago Stadium and the Boston Garden.;      The Sharks will call the
Cow Palace in Daly City home for two seasons while a downtown arena is
constructed in San Jose.; THE WINNERS AND LOSERS; The teams with the longest
and richest traditions in the NHL are Montreal, Toronto, Chicago, Detroit,
Boston and the Rangers -- the six teams that made up the league before six
expansion teams were added for the 1967-68 season.;      Of the newer teams,
the Islanders, Flyers and Oilers have been the most successful, winning at
least two Stanley Cup championships apiece.;      Hard times have hit the
Maple Leafs, Islanders and Flyers; none qualified for the playoffs last
season. But those teams haven't suffered as much in recent years as the
Nordiques, who have owned the league's worst record for three consecutive
seasons.; THE TOUGH GUYS; Not all players in the NHL are there because they
can score. Some are there because they can intimidate opponents and
occasionally beat them up.;      Dave "Tiger" Williams, who played in 962
games during 14 seasons with five NHL teams, is the leader in career penalty
minutes with 3,966. Other all-time penalty leaders include Chris Nilan (2,883
minutes in 12 seasons with three teams), Willi Plett (2,572 minutes in 12
seasons with four teams), Dale Hunter (2,471 minutes in 10 seasons with two
teams) and Dave Schultz (2,294 minutes in nine seasons with four teams).;
Nilan and Hunter still are active, with Boston and Washington, respectively.
Other heavyweights in the league today include Detroit's Bob Probert and Troy
Crowder, Buffalo's Rob Ray, Chicago's Mike Peluso and Stu Grimson and Los
Angeles' Marty McSorley and Jay Miller.; TODAY'S GREATS; Gretzky, the
superstar center of the Kings, is the NHL's all-time leader in scoring, with
2,142 points. But he isn't the only player in the league worth watching.;
Pittsburgh center Mario Lemieux was the league's most valuable player during
the 1987-88 season, center Mark Messier of Edmonton was the MVP during the
1989-90 season and right wing Brett Hull of St. Louis won the award last
season, when he scored 86 goals.;      Lemieux, Messier and Hull are the only
players besides Gretzky to be MVP since the 1979-80 season. The top 10 scorers
in the league last season were Gretzky, Hull, Adam Oates of St. Louis,
Pittsburgh's Mark Recchi, Hartford's John Cullen, Quebec's Joe Sakic,
Detroit's Steve Yzerman, Calgary's Theo Fleury and Al MacInnis and Chicago's
Steve Larmer. Each had at least 100 points last season.;   The list of players
to watch also includes Boston defenseman Ray Bourque (voted the league's best
defenseman four times in the past five seasons), L.A. left wing Luc Robitaille
(a 40-goal scorer in each of his five NHL seasons) and Chicago goalie Ed
Belfour (last season's Vezina Trophy winner as the No. 1 goalie in the league
and Calder Trophy winner as the rookie of the year).;      A dream-team lineup
of active NHL players might have Gretzky at center, Hull at right wing,
Robitaille at left wing, Bourque and MacInnis on defense and Belfour or
Patrick Roy of Montreal (a two-time Vezina Trophy winner) in goal.;
YESTERDAY'S HEROES; When Gretzky became the league's all-time leading scorer,
he broke a long-standing record held by Gordie Howe, who scored 1,850 points
in 26 seasons in the NHL, mostly with Detroit.;      A dream-team lineup of
former players might have Howe at right wing with Beliveau (507 goals in 20
seasons with Montreal) at center and Bobby Hull (1,170 points in 16 NHL
seasons, mostly with Chicago) at left wing. The defensemen might be Bobby Orr
(generally regarded as the best defenseman in NHL history after a brilliant
12-season career that he spent mostly with Boston) and Doug Harvey (a
seven-time winner of the Norris trophy during a 20-season career with
Montreal, the New York Rangers, Detroit and St. Louis). The goalie could be
Jacques Plante, a seven-time Vezina Trophy winner during an 18-season career.;
     Behind Gretzky and Howe in the top five on the league's all-time scoring
list are Marcel Dionne (1,771 points in 18 seasons with Detroit, L.A. and the
Rangers), Phil Esposito (1,590 points in 18 seasons, mostly with Boston) and
Stan Mikita (1,467 points in 22 seasons with Chicago).  </TEXT>

GRETZKY'S 1,000TH POINT WAS KEY BREAKTHROUGH
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Wayne Gretzky edges closer to becoming the most prolific scorer in National
Hockey League history, it is hard to believe that the Great One's greatness was
ever in question. But it's true. Gretzky, who needs only eight points to break
Gordie Howe's scoring record, was in the league five years before he was
considered something more than an upstart.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough probably occurred on Dec. 19, 1984, when Gretzky was playing
for the Edmonton Oilers against the Kings. He had a good night -- two goals and
four assists -- as the Oilers won, 7-3, and it was on Gretzky's first shift
that his assist on teammate Mike Krushelnyski's goal gave Gretzky his 1,000th
NHL point.
</P>
<P>
Krushelnyski, who is also a King and was playing on Gretzky's line until being
sidelined with a hairline fracture of his left wrist, said he doesn't remember
the goal, but he remembers the record and Gretzky's shot hitting the post.
</P>
<P>
"I saw Wayne break to the net and I was just going over to congratulate him
after he scored," Krushelnyski said at the time. "But I happened to follow him
in after he missed the shot and I went for the rebound. It went off my skate
and into the net."
</P>
<P>
The Oilers were prepared for the moment. Gretzky's family was at the game, and
a ceremony marked the occasion. Gretzky said it was the most satisfying
milestone in his career because of skepticism about his talent.
</P>
<P>
Then, even though he had been named an all-star the previous three years,
Gretzky was considered by many to be a slow skater and too small. These critics
also saw him as an offensive-minded center who was loath to pitch in on
defense.
</P>
<P>
Pat Quinn, who was the Kings' coach in '84 and is now the general manager of
the Vancouver Canucks, said much of the league didn't see Gretzky play often
enough to get beyond some easy stereotyping.
</P>
<P>
"When I was in Philadelphia (coaching the Flyers), I would get scouting reports
that said he was a little bit of a hanger," Quinn said. "They said he was slow.
Of course, now we know better. I think that 1,000 points won some of the
skeptics over."
</P>
<P>
Quinn said Gretzky is so subtle on the ice that he can dominate a game in a
discreet way. "What Wayne does is so cerebral, he is getting your defense out
of position and you don't even know it," Quinn said. "Much of what he does, or
did then, was not that apparent. I think that's why it took longer for him to
get recognition. A lot of nights as a coach, you'd look down on the sheet and
he had five points. And you'd think, 'How in the hell did that happen?'
</P>
<P>
Joining the 1,000-point club, and doing it faster than anyone before him, also
served to open the possibility that Gretzky was capable of breaking all the
scoring records, even Gordie Howe's sacred 1,850 career points.
</P>
<P>
"Some people may have seen it as a breakthrough," said Chris Baker, who covered
the Kings for The Times that year. "But I think it was determined long before
that night. It was just a matter of time and if he would stay healthy."
</P>
<P>
Krushelnyski said those who criticized Gretzky in the early years must not have
seen him play.
</P>
<P>
"Those people must not know anything about the game of hockey," he said. "We in
Edmonton knew how good he was, from the start. I knew, playing with him. I knew
how hard he worked and what he did in the game."
</P>
<P>
Of course, now all of that is a given. Gretzky's size hasn't hampered him, and
few skaters can catch him from behind.
</P>
<P>
The points are still coming, although he says that the first 1,000 seemed
easier.
</P>
<P>
"Now they are harder, I guess," Gretzky said. "I don't seem to be getting any
easy ones. Up to 1,800, it seemed I got a bunch of easy ones. One of the things
I've tried to do in my career is be consistent. I worked hard at it. If I did
have a bad game, I went out and made sure the next time I had a good one. To
minimize your bad games is crucial. That's one thing the 1,800 points stands
for in my mind, consistency."
</P>
<P>
Quinn, whose hapless King teams faced the very consistent Gretzky so often each
season, laughs now at the idea there was ever skepticism.
</P>
<P>
"Wayne makes a little inside move that used to get my defensemen every time,"
Quinn said. "I used to get on them about it. He's still doing that move and
still faking all the defensemen in the league. There must be something special
about it. I wish I'd known that then."

TIME FOR NEW KING FANS TO BRUSH UP ON THAT HOCKEY TALK

<TEXT>
<P>
Hockey is catching on in Los Angeles. The Kings are packing the Forum almost
every night, adding thousands of new fans to the old hard-core followers.
</P>
<P>
And we Americans think we're learning the game because we know the difference
between a red line and a blue line, a forecheck and a backcheck, a high stick
and a high five.
</P>
<P>
But that's not good enough.
</P>
<P>
With playoffs just around the corner, there's more to learn so that we don't
sound like a bunch of cementheads.
</P>
<P>
Sorry, that was a slip. Cementhead doesn't necessarily mean stupid or
uninformed. In hockey circles, a cementhead is a player whose specific role is
to be an enforcer, to fight. If he scores goals, fine. But that's not his job.
If his I.Q. is in the genius range, that's fine, too. But he's still a
cementhead.
</P>
<P>
And when cementheads drop their gloves (which means take off those big, bulky
cushions they wear on their hands, so that they can really punch) and tie up
their opponents' arms by pulling their sweaters (jerseys that are not knitted
of wool) halfway off, and smash faces and bloody the ice -- that's not brutal.
Not in hockey terms. Not if it's an even-up spilling of blood.
</P>
<P>
Brutal refers, loosely, to a mismatch. When a team loses, 11-3, that's brutal.
When a goalie gives up goals on the first three shots he faces, that's brutal.
A long trip can be brutal, too. But they never call a brawl brutal, no matter
what the degree of brutality.
</P>
<P>
No, a game filled with hard-checking and elbowing and defensive bumping and
lots of little scraps would not be called brutal, it would be called chippy.
Now, chippy may sound like a yuppie nickname or some happy derivative of
chipper but it's not a friendly term in hockey.
</P>
<P>
And only in hockey is the word turtle used as a verb, as in, "What could I do?
The guy turtled on me." That means that he dropped to the ice, cowering in a
defensive crouch and used those big old gloves to cover his head.
</P>
<P>
In a column in the Hockey News, in which he shared some helpful hints for
Americans "in the spirit of free trade," comic actor Bob McKenzie assumes that
Americans know the basic hockey terms, like cementhead and five-hole.
</P>
<P>
(Don't tell him if you don't know that the five-hole is the space between the
goalie's legs.)
</P>
<P>
For example, he explains that what the Zamboni does to ice between periods is
flood the ice. Not scrape ice. Not make ice. And a person who plays the right
wing position is a right winger, not a right wing. And there is no such thing
as a hockey locker room. It's the dressing room. Or the room. And to play
junior hockey is to play junior not juniors.
</P>
<P>
Somewhere in Canada there is a place called Medicine Hat that is always
referred to as the Hat. But if you ask a guy if he played juniors in the Hat,
you've blown it.
</P>
<P>
Those are the kinds of subtleties that give us away, that make those who speak
hockey in the native language grimace. The way we'd feel if somebody called Joe
Montana a quarterbacker.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, in the language of hockey, Edmonton Oilers goalie Grant Fuhr was
actually complimenting teammate Esa Tikkanen when he called him "a royal pain
in the . . . ."
</P>
<P>
Tikkanen has perfected the art of shadowing and generally harassing players
such as Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux. As if the constant physical
interference weren't enough, he talks nonstop. Tikkanen calls it yapping.
</P>
<P>
The Edmonton Journal collected these opinions on Tikkanen's style:
</P>
<P>
Dave Ellett of Winnipeg: "He gets under your skin. He's there to cause
trouble."
</P>
<P>
Coach Pat Burns of Montreal: "I don't know if despise is a strong enough word."
</P>
<P>
Craig MacTavish of Edmonton: "He's the best defensive forward in the game.
There's not a better checker in the NHL and he's got all kinds of offensive
tools."
</P>
<P>
Paul Coffey of Pittsburgh, a former teammate: "He's got a lot of talent, and
not a whole lot of fear."
</P>
<P>
Gretzky of the Kings, another former teammate: "I just felt like telling him to
shut up. I said, 'Tikk, I never understood you when I was playing with you, and
I don't understand you now."
</P>
<P>
Jari Kurri of the Oilers: "He's settled down. He's still a crazy Finn, but he's
learned a lot. . . . He's learned to play his own game now. Not sit in the
penalty box."
</P>
<P>
Tikkanen: "You need everyone good to win the Stanley Cup. Team needs a fighter.
Somebody checker. Somebody scoring. Grant Fuhr. Somebody yapping."
</P>
<P>
The Montreal Gazette polled 21 Canadiens, asking who they would rather have on
their team right now, Gretzky or Lemieux. Twelve picked Gretzky, six picked
Lemieux, two couldn't decide and one chose neither.
</P>
<P>
Canadien Ryan Walter added: "The Gretzky-Lemieux business is a fun thing. It
beats debating Wade Boggs and Steve Garvey."
</P>
<P>
Edmonton Coach Glen Sather has never been shy about giving honest opinions on
Gretzky, even when his comments weren't too flattering and even when the Great
One was an Oiler.
</P>
<P>
Sather said last week: "Over the years, (Gretzky) has developed an aura, a
mystique. Much of it is crap, but his teammates believe he can do anything."
</P>
<P>
Come to think of it, that's what a mystique is all about.
</P>
<P>
Hockey Notes
</P>
<P>
While Canada is exporting its hockey players to the U.S., the U.S. is stocking
Europe's teams. According to the Amateur Hockey Assn. of the United States,
there are 107 U.S.-born players on professional hockey teams in 12 European
countries. That's more than on NHL teams. . . . Just before New York Islander
Bryan Trottier played his club-record 1,061st game, one more than Denis Potvin,
General Manager Bill Torrey was saying, "I don't think he's finished as a
hockey player. You're dead wrong if you think that." Trottier, 32, scored the
game-winning goal Monday night in a 5-3 victory at Montreal.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Capitals had to cancel practice last Saturday when an employee
of the Capital Centre found road flares in a box labeled "explosives" and
thought they were dynamite. Fire officials evacuated the building. . . .
Several teams, including the Kings, have had charter flights canceled because
they were using Air Ontario. An Air Ontario jet crashed last Friday near
Dryden, Canada, killing 24. There was little grumbling when the Kings were told
they'd be busing between Montreal and Quebec.

GRETZKY AND COMPANY'S 'BIGGEST VICTORY' TIES PLAYOFF SERIES

<TEXT>
<P>
The trade of last August that took Wayne Gretzky away from the defending
Stanley Cup champion Edmonton Oilers and brought the Great One to the
struggling Kings was bound to affect the balance of power in the National
Hockey League sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
It's happening sooner. It's happening now.
</P>
<P>
Stunned Oiler fans saw some of that power slip away Thursday night at the
Northlands Coliseum as the Kings came from behind to beat the Oilers, 4-1,
snapping Edmonton's playoff-game winning streak on their home ice at 14 and
sending the series back to the Forum for the decisive seventh game.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky called it "the biggest victory" in the history of the Kings' franchise.
And owner Bruce McNall, the man who put up the millions of dollars to turn the
Kings into a winner, was quick to agree.
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely, the biggest," McNall said as he was knocked about in the crush
outside the Kings' dressing room by people wanting to shake his hand and pat
him on the back and tell him that Gretzky was worth all the millions.
</P>
<P>
But McNall has been close enough to the coaches and players this season to add
that the Oilers will "come out flying" Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
With the win, the Kings regained the home-ice advantage and took a giant step
forward in their quest for the Stanley Cup. Their climactic matchup -- the
first time the Kings and Oilers have met in a seventh game -- shapes up as a
classic.
</P>
<P>
"I think the fans who have tickets will get their money's worth," McNall said.
</P>
<P>
And all tickets have already been sold. Incredibly, the crowd at the Northlands
Coliseum Thursday night was a less-than-capacity 17,351.
</P>
<P>
Times are changing.
</P>
<P>
Game 6 started out looking like old times.
</P>
<P>
Seconds into the game, Gretzky blocked a shot by Oiler right wing Glenn
Anderson that ricocheted right back to defenseman Randy Gregg, who fired a shot
that King goalie Kelly Hrudey said bounced about 10 feet in front of him. He
couldn't stop the puck as it glanced off the ice. "I'm sure a lot of people
thought that was the series right there," Hrudey said.
</P>
<P>
The Oilers led, 1-0, with just 33 seconds gone. And there the score stayed
through almost two periods, until Mike Allison's goal tied the game at 16:22 of
the second period.
</P>
<P>
Allison fought for that goal. He got the puck in the right corner and then
scrapped and clawed and elbowed and kicked his way along the boards behind the
Edmonton net, trying to keep the puck and lose Gregg at the same time. Gregg
even pulled off one of Allison's gloves as he sought to slow him down. But when
Allison couldn't lose Gregg, he dragged him along, getting both the puck and
the defenseman around the left side of the net. As Allison was falling to the
ice, with Gregg on his back, he reached out with his stick and swept the puck
in a wide arc between the legs of Oiler goalie Grant Fuhr.
</P>
<P>
It was a goal for the highlight films. The kind of goal that turns a game
around.
</P>
<P>
Said Dave Taylor: "It was a great, great effort by Allison. Gregg was trying to
pin him on the boards and Mike just kept fighting him off and just outmuscled
him. That really gave our team a big lift."
</P>
<P>
The Kings had had a goal taken away just a few minutes earlier when referee
Bill McCreary ruled that the puck had dropped in behind Fuhr as a result of a
high stick by Taylor after Bernie Nicholls' shot was deflected into the air.
But television replays clearly showed that the puck went in off Oiler Esa
Tikkanen. It should have counted.
</P>
<P>
In that second period, the Kings outshot the Oilers, 10-4.
</P>
<P>
Jim Weimer scored the tie-breaker at 4:15 of the third period, teamming up with
Dave Taylor on a break toward the Oiler goal. Taylor took the puck up the right
side, passed it to Weimer on the left and kept driving toward the right side of
the net. Fuhr tried to keep an eye on both of them. But he wasn't quite quick
enough when Weimer decided to take the shot on the sharp angle from the bottom
of the left circle instead of making the pass to Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Weimer, too, is a former Oiler. He had played with Edmonton's Cape Breton team
all season before being traded to the Kings in a deal for some other minor
leaguers at the trading deadline, March 7.
</P>
<P>
When Weimer was recalled from New Haven just in time to score the game-winner
against the Oilers here March 21, Oiler Coach Glen Sather expressed no regret
at letting him go. In fact, Sather said at the time that Weimer was "old," that
he was "slow" and that he was, in fact, "a minor leaguer."
</P>
<P>
But that slow, old minor leaguer came home and scored another game-winner when
it counted most.
</P>
<P>
And then Chris Kontos, another player written off by the rest of the league but
signed by the Kings on March 7, scored the insurance goal. Gretzky had pulled
up at the top of the right circle, made one of his little swirls and then fired
the puck across the slot to Kontos, who was waiting at the left post to shovel
the puck over Fuhr's right skate.
</P>
<P>
For Kontos, it was playoff goal No. 7, setting a club record for goals in a
seven-game series.
</P>
<P>
But the Kings were not finished. Defenseman Dale DeGray tipped away a pass from
Oiler wing Jari Kurri, putting it right on Nicholls' stick. Nicholls made the
quick pass to Luc Robitaille, who fired the 15-foot scoring shot off the pass.
</P>
<P>
The Kings won with a solid defensive effort and a diversified offense.
</P>
<P>
"We can't rely on Wayne Gretzky to get all of our goals," Taylor said. "We had
some guys come through for us. Jim Weimer had a big goal. Chris Kontos, another
guy who wasn't even with us all season, came through with another big goal. The
Oilers like to key on Gretzky and Nicholls and Robitaille, but we have others
who can score."
</P>
<P>
Allison isn't one of the Kings' big guns, either, but even couldn't believe the
goal he scored. Allison said he was merely trying to stay in control of the
puck and get it out in front of the net, where other Kings were in scoring
position.
</P>
<P>
"As I came around, and I think I was already going down, I heard somebody,
maybe Stevie (Kasper) yelling that he was going to the net," Allison said. "I
reached out with one hand and pushed the puck around there.
</P>
<P>
"Did I think it had a chance of going in? Well, they say any time you shoot at
the net it has a chance of going in. But I was thinking that at least there
would be a rebound and a loose puck."
</P>
<P>
When the red light came on, the Kings on the bench erupted.
</P>
<P>
But it was still a 1-1 game when Kurri took a shot at the Kings' net that might
have changed the course of the game. Hrudey made one of his best stops.
</P>
<P>
Said Gretzky: "From our point of view, that goal by Allison was the kind of
goal that turns a game around. From (the Oilers') point of view, the turning
point might have been the stop on Kurri."
</P>
<P>
Both of those plays turned the tide in favor of the Kings, who are on a
two-game roll going into Saturday night's game.
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting," Gretzky said. "They're buzzing about hockey in Southern
California."
</P>
<P>
Asked if there might be a little magic taking place at the Forum Saturday,
Gretzky, the ultimate sports fan, responded: "Magic (Johnson, of the Lakers) is
playing the Clippers that night (at the Sports Arena). Hopefully, we'll make
some magic of our own."

TEAMMATE SAYS GRETZKY WAS FLU VICTIM, TOO;
</P>
<P>
KING STAR WAS SLOWED IN FIRST GAME OF NHL PLAYOFFS BUT IS ALL RIGHT NOW
</P>

<P>
The flu bug that took several King players out of the lineup last week seems to
be gone -- as might be the team's chances of advancing in the National Hockey
League playoffs.
</P>
<P>
In fact, even John Tonelli was back at practice Monday for the first time in
more than a week. But, Tonelli and goalie Kelly Hrudey were not the most
celebrated players to have influenza.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knows it, but Wayne (Gretzky) had the flu in the first game," teammate
Marty McSorley said Monday afternoon on the eve of tonight's fifth game in the
Forum in the best-of-seven series against the Edmonton Oilers. "Did you notice
that he was the first one off the ice on every shift? He never does that."
</P>
<P>
Gretzky also chose not to go to the interview room that night and when he did
talk with reporters in the locker room, he was looking tired and was sweating
profusely. Reporters thought that the loss, the 100-degree weather and the
crowd in the locker room explained his condition.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky also played only six minutes in the third period. At the time, it
seemed to be just another reason for some to criticize the coaching of the
Kings' Robbie Ftorek.
</P>
<P>
"Robbie isn't going to use excuses," McSorley said without alibiing for the
Kings' 3-1 deficit in this series. "He isn't going to say that."
</P>
<P>
Also, Ftorek's policy is to say as little as he possibly can about injuries and
illnesses. Gretzky was playing so he had no obligation to release information
on Gretzky's health.
</P>
<P>
McSorley mentioned it Monday because he was asked directly and because, he
said: "That's all behind us now. Wayne played a hell of a game last (Sunday)
night."
</P>
<P>
Asked if he, himself, had had the flu, McSorley said: "The only thing wrong
with me is I haven't been scoring."
</P>
<P>
McSorley doesn't always show up at optional practices, but he was among several
who surprised Ftorek by being there. The only players who were required to be
on the ice today were the three who had not played the night before. And
Tonelli had told Ftorek that he wanted to be there.
</P>
<P>
Still, half the team showed up anyway. Gretzky rarely shows up at optional
workouts and didn't break form Monday.
</P>
<P>
McSorley uses the 1987 Stanley Cup final series as a case in point. McSorley
was playing for the Oilers when they went up, 3-1, on Philadelphia with two of
the remaining games scheduled for Edmonton. Philadelphia managed to take that
series to seven games before losing.
</P>
<P>
"All it takes is a bunch of determined hockey players. . . . I've seen it
slowly slip away from a team and I've seen teams come back," McSorley said.
"Ask Doug Crossman, he was on that Philadelphia team."
</P>
<P>
Crossman, another player who chose to skate Monday, agreed: "It can be done. .
. . We have enough experience and enough composure to do it. We're not going to
roll over."
</P>
<P>
The Kings need to play a little longer, at least, if they want to give Tonelli
a chance to at least compete for a fifth Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
"It's got to hurt him to be out now," McSorley said. "The guy is dying to play.
He lives to play. That's why guys feed off of him. When he was in the hospital
we sure missed him. You can almost feel his presence with this team."
</P>
<P>
The Kings will have Tonelli's presence back at the Forum tonight, but whether
he plays is another question that won't be answered until game time.
</P>
<P>
As Ftorek points out, at playoff time, with only 20 players dressing, everyone
has to be ready.
</P>
<P>
Tonelli developed complications with his flu and has been in much worse shape
than the others who have come back in a day or two. Tonelli doesn't want to
admit that he had pneumonia. Just as he doesn't want to say how much weight he
lost or how high his temperature got. But it is with a serious tone that he
says, "I was sick."
</P>
<P>
Kings Notes
</P>
<P>
The fifth game of the Kings' best-of-seven Smythe Division semifinal playoff
series against the Oilers will begin at 7:30 p.m. and will be televised by
Prime Ticket and broadcast by KLAC (570). . . . Asked if he was feeling any
pressure to win this series to save his job, King Coach Robbie Ftorek said:
"That's something I wouldn't waste time thinking about. The only thing I'm
concerned with is winning the next game. I care about the team. As for me
individually, I don't give a hoot."
</P>
<P>
Marty McSorley, pointing out that the Kings' 91 points for second place in the
Smythe Division and the Oilers' 84 points for third added up to (175) more than
the total for any other second-and-third place matchups, said: "It's unusual to
have a first round matching teams of this caliber."
</P>
<P>
In assessing the Oilers' position after taking the 3-1 lead with Sunday's
victory at Edmonton, former King Jimmy Carson said: "We held serve. But by no
means are we going to get cocky at match point." . . . Carson acknowledged that
there is a certain confidence that comes with being the defending champions.
It's a feeling that was not there in his time with the Kings. "There is a sort
of a wave of emotion that is starting to build," Carson said. "They've won four
Cups in five years. You just ride with it."

<P>
The final image from Game 6 Saturday night at the Forum remains indelible.
</P>
<P>
Calgary Flame goalie Mike Vernon is on his knees, stretching like an outfielder
going for a fly ball. Just beyond his straining fingertips sails the puck,
moving seemingly in slow motion.
</P>
<P>
With it sails the prospect of keeping the Stanley Cup, won a year ago, but just
out of the grasp of Vernon and his teammates. The puck, hit by the Kings' Mike
Krushelnyski, lands in the net to end the series.
</P>
<P>
It's an image the Flames won't soon forget.
</P>
<P>
But it's an image that weighs heavily on the minds of the Kings, too, as they
prepare for Game 1 of the Smythe Division finals tonight against the Edmonton
Oilers at the Northlands Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
This is the 23rd season of existence for the Kings. It is their 15th appearance
in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
And they have never advanced beyond the second round. Good teams and bad,
Stanley Cup after Stanley Cup has eluded their grasp. It is no problem feeling
for Vernon.
</P>
<P>
Those not into ancient history need only remember a year ago to appreciate the
frustration the Kings have endured.
</P>
<P>
The team was flying high. It was Wayne Gretzky's first season in Los Angeles
and the Kings had just bumped off Edmonton, then the defending Stanley Cup
champion, in seven games. To add to the exhilaration, the Kings had done so by
coming back from a 3-1 deficit, becoming only the sixth team in NHL history to
do so.
</P>
<P>
Enter Calgary in the second round.
</P>
<P>
Exit the Kings, in four games.
</P>
<P>
Now, the roles are reversed. This time, the Flames were the defending champions
knocked off by the Kings.
</P>
<P>
And this time, Edmonton has come back from a 3-1 deficit to survive the first
round, beating the Winnipeg Jets in a seventh game Monday night.
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot different this time," Gretzky said. "We are so much stronger this
year.
</P>
<P>
"Last year, it (the playoff against Edmonton) was such an emotional series.
Then, we were horrendous (against Calgary) and it was over before we knew it."
</P>
<P>
Mark Messier, Gretzky's Oiler counterpart and the man considered the favorite
for the Hart Trophy as NHL most valuable player, doesn't want to dwell on last
season, either. Particularly, his team's collapse against the Kings.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think what happened is going to enter into it this time," he said.
"That's all behind us. We're not looking at that. That's like when you rip your
rear-view mirror on your car. What's behind you isn't important."
</P>
<P>
Unless you can use it as a motivator. Edmonton Coach John Muckler isn't
hesitant to bring up Gretzky, who led the Oilers to four Stanley Cups before
coming to the Kings two seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people remember the joy Wayne got from beating us (last season),"
Muckler said, "and it was joy. I don't blame him, but he's an opponent now and
has to be treated as such. Wayne will do everything in his power to win and we
should, too."
</P>
<P>
Messier, on the other hand, would prefer to leave Gretzky in the past.
</P>
<P>
"All the emotional ties are gone," he said. "This is a brand new club. Wayne
hasn't entered into our talks once all year.
</P>
<P>
"We have to contend with Wayne obviously because he's such a great player, but
it's not us against him. It's the Oilers versus the Kings. That's the truth."
</P>
<P>
If the emotion from last year has truly dissipated, how about the emotion
generated the last time these teams met in the regular season? The result was
an NHL-record 86 penalties in a confrontation that was more a brawl than a
game.
</P>
<P>
The Kings' Tomas Sandstrom wound up with a facial fracture and a scratched
cornea as a result of a punch thrown by Glenn Anderson.
</P>
<P>
"They were coming off a bad loss to Calgary," King Coach Tom Webster said, "and
we were trying to establish ourselves as a team. We both clashed at the wrong
time.
</P>
<P>
"We played with great discipline against Calgary in the playoffs, and we now
have to do the same thing against Edmonton."
</P>
<P>
The Kings got bad news from doctors Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Tom Laidlaw, out since March 17 with a lower back injury, may be
through for the season.
</P>
<P>
And veteran right wing Dave Taylor, who suffered a strained shoulder in Game 6
of the Calgary series, may not be back for the Edmonton series.
</P>
<P>
There was good news. Defenseman Tim Watters, out since Game 4 against the
Flames with a deep ankle bruise, may be back by Game 3 of this series.
</P>
<P>
And left wing John Tonelli, who bruised his knee in Game 6, skated Tuesday and
is expected to play tonight.
</P>
<P>
Taking Taylor's spot on the line with Luc Robitaille and Todd Elik will be
Scott Bjugstad, finishing his first season with the Kings.
</P>
<P>
For Edmonton, goalie Grant Fuhr is out for the year with an injured shoulder,
but backup Bill Ranford played well in the Jet series, stopping 26 shots in
Monday's 4-1 victory to finish the series with a 2.81 goals-against average.
</P>
<P>
Oiler center Craig MacTavish has a hip injury, but is expected to play.
</P>
<P>
King Notes
</P>

STANLEY CUP: EDMONTON WINS GAME, 4-1, AND SERIES, 4-1, FROM BOSTON FOR FIRST
CHAMPIONSHIP SINCE GRETZKY TRADE TWO YEARS AGO. GOALIE RANFORD NAMED MVP.

<P>
It was the trade that shocked a nation, angered a city and, supposedly,
decimated a team.
</P>
<P>
Goodby Wayne Gretzky. Goodby Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
For two years, that's all Edmonton Oiler owner Peter Pocklington has been
hearing after dealing The Great One to the Kings.
</P>
<P>
But no more. Not after Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky may be in Los Angeles, but the Stanley Cup is back in Edmonton after
the Oilers defeated the Boston Bruins Thursday night, 4-1, before a Boston
Garden crowd of 14,448 to win the finals in five games.
</P>
<P>
Pocklington, champagne dripping from his forehead, beamed outside the Oiler
locker room after his team won its fifth Stanley Cup in seven years.
</P>
<P>
Arguably the team of the last decade, the Oilers are alive and well in the new
decade. There is life after Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
"I was as much disturbed as anybody in Edmonton over the trade," Pocklington
said. "Wayne Gretzky is not just a hockey player. He's an icon.
</P>
<P>
"But to win in the '90s, you sometimes have to do something unpopular in the
'80s. I did what I had to do. There is no doubt in my mind I did the right
thing."
</P>
<P>
This was a night of vindication:
</P>
<P>
 -- For Pocklington, who has been under siege in Edmonton for the past two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
 -- For goalie Bill Ranford, who had never won a playoff game before this
season and wound up winning the Conn Smythe Trophy, given to the most valuable
player in the finals. Ranford had a 16-6 record, tying the all-time mark for
most playoff victories. In the five games of the finals, he allowed Boston a
total of eight goals.
</P>
<P>
 -- For center Mark Messier, who was handed the mantle of leadership when
Gretzky departed. He had a Gretzky-type regular season, and is the favorite to
win the Hart Memorial Trophy, given to the season's most valuable player. But
Messier struggled through the first three games of the finals, getting only one
assist. He came on strong in the final two games with four assists while
centering a line that collected 16 points in the last two victories.
</P>
<P>
 -- For a defense that was often forgotten behind the fast-skating, wide-open
offense that grabbed the headlines in Edmonton. But Kevin Lowe, Craig Muni,
Charlie Huddy, Steve Smith and Randy Gregg cleared out the puck and shut down
the Bruins in the Oiler zone game after game, allowing both Ranford and the
offense to shine.
</P>
<P>
 -- For John Muckler in his first year as head coach. Muckler, who finally
stepped out of the shadow of Glen Sather, proved he could make the right moves
on his own at the championship level.
</P>
<P>
 -- And vindication for Sather, who left the bench and the coaching to Muckler
and concentrated on doing the wheeling and dealing as general manager who
rebuilt this club.
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the nicest of the five Stanley Cups," Muckler said, "because
coming out of training camp, we never expected to be here."
</P>
<P>
Certainly not when they fell behind the Winnipeg Jets, three games-to-one, in
the opening round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
Edmonton won three in a row to survive that series, swept the Kings in four and
beat the Chicago Blackhawks in six.
</P>
<P>
The Oilers then won the opener of the finals in the Garden in triple overtime,
3-2, and also won Game 2 in Boston, 7-2.
</P>
<P>
After losing the third game back home, 2-1, Edmonton came up with its best
playoff effort in Game 4, winning easily, 5-1.
</P>
<P>
Still, Game 5 was expected to be tough. The Bruins, owners of the league's best
regular-season record, didn't figure to lose three in a row at home, surely not
against a club that had stumbled so often here before in the regular season,
going 2-13-2.
</P>
<P>
And sure enough, Boston came out aggressively Thursday night, smashing bodies
into the boards and the puck into the Edmonton zone.
</P>
<P>
But when it became obvious the Bruins weren't going to be able to handle
Ranford any better than they had in the past, it became merely a matter of
time.
</P>
<P>
The game was scoreless in the first period, but Glenn Anderson broke through at
the 1:17 mark of the second after Bob Sweeney smashed the puck off him near the
left boards at mid-ice.
</P>
<P>
Anderson controlled the puck, skated down the left side and into the slot,
where he found defensemen Don Sweeney and Ray Bourque awaiting him.
</P>
<P>
Wisely avoiding Bourque, Boston's defensive leader, Anderson, without breaking
stride, skated past Sweeney and rammed the puck through the pads of goalie Andy
Moog.
</P>
<P>
Boston never recovered.
</P>
<P>
Craig Simpson scored his league-high 16th playoff goal later in the period, and
Smith and Joe Murphy added third-period goals.
</P>
<P>
Lyndon Byers accounted for the Bruins' only goal late in the game.
</P>
<P>
Boston outshot Edmonton, 30-22, but it didn't matter with Ranford on duty.
</P>
<P>
Messier, the Stanley Cup held high over his head in the locker room with
champagne pouring out of it, also took a moment to look back.
</P>
<P>
"We all missed Wayne, he's a good friend of ours," he shouted above the roar of
celebrating teammates. "This is for you, Wayne. We love you."

GRETZKY'S THIRD POINT HELPS KINGS TO 6-5 WIN
</P>

<P>
Wayne Gretzky's third point -- an assist -- was a big one Friday night.
</P>
<P>
He passed to Steve Kasper, who scored a last-second goal that gave the Kings a
6-5 victory over the Vancouver Canucks in front of 16,123 at the Pacific
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
As seconds ticked away, the winning goal was set up when Gretzky carried the
puck into the Canucks' zone -- acting as a magnet to two defenders who couldn't
help but give chase.
</P>
<P>
Kasper, who used to lead the Boston Bruins' checking line, liked what he saw.
</P>
<P>
"I could see both Vancouver guys going at Wayne, and I started yelling for the
puck," he said. "I probably didn't need to be yelling, because he sees
everything. He doesn't miss anything.
</P>
<P>
"When I looked for the shot, which I think went between (Kirk McLean's) pads, I
knew time was running short. But I didn't know it was just one second."
</P>
<P>
Kasper gave the Kings their third victory in five games and helped Gretzky
close the gap on the National Hockey League points record.
</P>
<P>
"I knew from my years in Boston what was going to happen," Kasper said. "That's
why we used to designate one guy to go with him and say, hey, that's his
responsibility, let's not get caught trying to do everybody else's job. Because
when he draws two men, somebody's open."
</P>
<P>
Gretzky has made a career of setting up the open man.
</P>
<P>
All three points Friday night were assists.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky needs two to break the points record of 1,850 that Gordie Howe set over
the course of a 26-year National Hockey League career.
</P>
<P>
Howe and several league officials were on hand in case Gretzky set the record,
but it really was not expected to happen Friday night. Not even Howe thought
so. He quipped before the game: "If I thought he was going to get it, I'd have
worn my suit."
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's parents didn't even make the game. They were figuring they could show
up at Sunday's game in Edmonton without missing the milestone.
</P>
<P>
They were right about that.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky has said he would like to break the record at the Forum and, failing
that, his second choice would be to break in Edmonton. But Gretzky did not hold
back against the Canucks.
</P>
<P>
The Canucks held him back, perhaps, limiting him to one shot on goal. But he
didn't duck ice time.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky skated with his own line of John Tonelli and Bob Kudelski and took
turns with Bernie Nicholls centering a line with Hubie McDonough and Jim Fox.
</P>
<P>
And Gretzky did his share of penalty killing and skating on the power play.
</P>
<P>
But the Canucks know how to play him. Vancouver Coach Bob McCammon, who was an
assistant coach at Edmonton during Gretzky's reign there, said before Friday's
game that he knew what it took to slow -- if not stop -- Gretzky, including
using two lines to check him. Gretzky's stamina is such that he can wear down
one line.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the Canucks defend against Gretzky pretty well. He was shut out
here in one game last season.
</P>
<P>
In the first period, the Canuck defense stopped all the Kings, holding them to
three shots on goal -- none for Gretzky -- to 14 for the Canucks.
</P>
<P>
Vancouver took a 1-0 lead in the first period, on a play initiated when Trevor
Linden, one of the league's best rookies last season, blew past King defenseman
Petr Prajsler coming up the right side. That drew goalie Kelly Hrudey out and
he then passed through the crease to center Greg Adams, who scored in the open
net behind Hrudey.
</P>
<P>
Adams scored another power-play goal to put the Canucks ahead, 2-0, early in
the second period. But the Kings took control in the period, outscoring the
Canucks by three goals to take a 5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
The Kings started to rally with a power-play goal by Kudelski from defenseman
Steve Duchesne and Gretzky. Less than a minute later, Craig Duncanson's goal
tied it.
</P>
<P>
The Canucks' Soviet tandem stepped forward, with Igor Larionov scoring off a
pass from Vladimir Krutov on the power play for a brief lead before the Kings
scored the last three goals of the period.
</P>
<P>
Dave Taylor scored twice in that run, beating McLean to tie it at 14:36 and
again to make it 5-3 on the second goal of a four-minute power play that
resulted from a fight between Canuck defenseman Larry Melnyk and King
defenseman Keith Crowder.
</P>
<P>
They both received five minutes for fighting, but Melnyk also got two minutes
for charging and two minutes for instigating.
</P>
<P>
Kudelski scored first for the Kings on that power play off a centering pass
from Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
Petri Skriko and Larionov scored early in the third period to tie the score
again, and the game remained a standoff until Kasper and Gretzky won it with
one second left.
</P>
<P>
King Notes
</P>
<P>
Mikael Lindholm, the young Swedish player who has been on Wayne Gretzky's line
since the first day of training camp, was scratched Friday night. John Tonelli
was moved into his spot to play opposite Bob Kudelski, who now leads the Kings
with four goals. . . . Left winger Jay Miller was scratched to let a bruised
lower leg heal. . . . Since joining the Kings, goalie Kelly Hrudey is 3-0
against the Canucks. . . . The Canucks outshot the Kings in six of eight games
last season, and did it again Friday night.

<HEADLINE>  KINGS PURSUE DEAL FOR KURRI  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Hockey Report
Some information in this report was obtained from writers in other cities.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Gretzky and Kurri combined to help the Edmonton Oilers win four Stanley
Cups before the Kings acquired Gretzky in 1988 in the most-publicized deal in
NHL history. Kurri left the Oilers at the end of last season to play in Italy,
but the Kings have expressed interest in trading for his NHL rights, which are
still held by the Oilers.;    The Kings had been losers for years before they
gained instant credibility by acquiring Gretzky, who is the NHL's all-time
scoring leader. They are battling the Calgary Flames for first place in the
Smythe Division this season, and Kurri, 30, would be a significant addition.;
  Of course, the Kings would be gambling that they could persuade Kurri to
leave Italy if they made a deal. But when Kurri left the NHL, many insiders
guessed that he would return as a free agent to rejoin Gretzky in L.A.;
Because Edmonton kept Kurri's NHL rights, any team signing him as a free agent
would have to compensate the Oilers. But Kings General Manager Rogie Vachon
told a Vancouver, British Columbia, radio station that he wouldn't be
surprised to see Oilers General Manager Glen Sather trade Kurri's rights to
strengthen the Oilers for the playoffs. The NHL trading deadline is March 11.;
   "Glen has lost him for the year and doesn't have anybody in return," Vachon
said. "I'm sure he's going to try to move him to get some assets for the
playoffs.";    Before leaving for Italy, Kurri scored 1,043 points in 10
seasons with the Oilers. He helped them to another Stanley Cup last season,
and his 92 career playoff goals are a league record.; WEST STARS: Minnesota
North Stars owner Norm Green might be able to keep some of the young prospects
he is afraid of losing to the expansion San Jose Sharks, but only if he is
prepared to give up some veterans in exchange.;    Green has been trying for
months to restructure the complicated deal that allows the Sharks to stock
their initial roster with as many as 30 players from the Minnesota
organization, and the Sharks say they're interested if the changes would give
them access to some players they otherwise couldn't have.;    The deal allows
the North Stars to protect certain veterans when the teams begin their special
dispersal draft in June. But the number of players is in dispute because the
North Stars have traded or released several players who would have been
eligible for selection by the Sharks, who begin play next season at the Cow
Palace in Daly City and will move to San Jose's downtown arena when it opens
in 1993.;    Still, Art Savage, the Sharks' chief executive officer, said the
Sharks might be willing to compromise on the number of players the North Stars
can protect if it would land them some of those veterans. Otherwise, the
league might have to arbitrate the dispute.;    "We have no reason to bend
over backward on this," Savage said. "They're the ones who wanted to make a
deal, not us.";    Green wants the deal changed because he says the loss of
his best young players will put his team's future at risk.; SHARK BITES: The
Sharks had hoped to unveil their uniform sometime next week, but they now say
manufacturer delays have pushed the target date back to the second week of
February. . . . Purchasers of season tickets in club and rink-side locations
should receive their seat assignments in the next week or so, said Matt
Levine, the Sharks' executive vice president in charge of business operations.
People buying seats in other locations should start receiving seat assignments
in about a month. . . . The Sharks will begin a new ticket-selling push
Monday, when the team's first radio advertisements begin on seven Bay Area
stations. The Sharks have sold about 5,200 season tickets for next season but
hope to have about 10,000 sold by the time the season starts. . . . Levine
said the Sharks hope to play exhibition games at the Cow Palace during the
second and fourth weeks of September. He said the earliest available date is
Sept. 14 and indicated that the team also might try to play at least one
exhibition game in Fresno or Sacramento. . . . San Jose attorney Allen C.
Speare, who attended the NHL All-Star Game last weekend as a guest of the
Sharks, said the trip provided lots of lasting memories. Speare said he met
several players, including Gretzky, and found most of them to be quite
friendly. Speare was awarded the trip when his entry was randomly selected as
the grand-prize winner in the name-the-team sweepstakes run by the Sharks last
summer. . . . The Sharks are working to launch a "Sharks and Parks" youth
street hockey program and are asking advertisers to provide funds for
equipment. Levine, who plans to have organized leagues established by
September, said the team has contacted about 75 community centers in the Bay
Area and estimated that about 25 of them might be involved in the initial
phase of the program.  </TEXT>

KINGS PLAY WELL DEFENSIVELY, BUT ONLY GET A 1-1 TIE
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Now that the Kings have a goaltender whom they believe will keep the puck out
of their net, they've stopped scoring.
</P>
<P>
For the second straight game, in front of a crowd of 19,040 at the Meadowlands,
the National Hockey League's highest-scoring team was limited to a single goal
Sunday night in a 1-1 tie with the New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
The Kings, though, insisted afterward that they are not at all concerned with
this strange turn of events.
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to have scored one more goal tonight," Coach Robbie Ftorek said,
"but we're very pleased with keeping New Jersey down to one goal."
</P>
<P>
As Ftorek was quick to point out, the Kings have not allowed an even-strength
goal in two games, including a 4-1 loss to the Edmonton Oilers last Friday
night at Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
"They're really buckling down and doing the job that we've asked them to do,"
Ftorek said of his players, who have won only two of their last 12 road games.
"So, we're very pleased in that regard. We're creating scoring opportunities
off the work we're doing. We're just not putting them in.
</P>
<P>
"We're playing a much sounder game than we had been."
</P>
<P>
Indeed, creating opportunities wasn't the Kings' problem.
</P>
<P>
Converting them was.
</P>
<P>
Devil goaltender Chris Terreri, a rookie making only his second start of the
season, made several spectacular saves in pursuit of his first NHL victory,
allowing only a second-period goal by Dave Taylor.
</P>
<P>
John MacLean pulled the Devils even less than five minutes later, scoring a
power-play goal on a 20-foot shot from the left circle that sailed through the
legs of goaltender Kelly Hrudey, who otherwise played well for the Kings in his
second start since being acquired last Wednesday in a trade with the New York
Islanders.
</P>
<P>
Later, Terreri got a hand from the officials, who swallowed their whistles in
the overtime period, as is customary in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
The most obvious infraction of the rules was made by Tom Kurvers of the Devils,
who grabbed Wayne Gretzky in front of the Devil net and threw the King center
to the ice with about 2 minutes 50 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
When no whistle was blown and play continued, Gretzky made a beeline toward
linesman Pat DaPuzzo, giving him an earful as they skated up the ice.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky was still angry as the players and officials skated off afterward,
making sure that all three officials got a piece of his mind.
</P>
<P>
Was his anger justified?
</P>
<P>
"I can't answer for him," Ftorek said. "You'll have to ask him that question."
</P>
<P>
Should a call have been made?
</P>
<P>
"I can't answer that question, either," said Ftorek, apparently weary of being
fined. "I think the referee called (the game) to the best of his ability. He
didn't call it, so it must not have been a penalty."
</P>
<P>
And what did Gretzky think of the play by Kurvers?
</P>
<P>
"He didn't have his stick, so he grabbed the next closest thing," Gretzky said
of the Devil defenseman, who dropped his stick as he grappled with Gretzky.
"But I guess you learn after 10 years that in the last few minutes of a game,
that's not going to be called. It's as simple as that."
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, in fact, even insisted that he wasn't angry.
</P>
<P>
"I was more frustrated than anything else," he said. "I had an opportunity to
go to the net, and I had the guy beat."
</P>
<P>
For the first time as a member of the Kings, Gretzky was held without a point
for a second consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
And for the eighth straight game, dating back to Nov. 19, 1983, when he said
the Devils were "ruining hockey and putting a Mickey Mouse operation on the
ice," Gretzky failed to score in the Brendan Byrne Arena.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, though, said he was pleased with the direction that the more
tight-checking Kings seem to be headed.
</P>
<P>
"In order for us to win, we have to play better defensively," he said. "We're
not going to go anywhere if we score eight goals a game and give up nine. We've
played very well the last couple of games."
</P>
<P>
He smiled.
</P>
<P>
"Kelly's pretty good, too," he said of Hrudey.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Hrudey seemingly has had little trouble fitting in, although it's clear
that he still needs time to become fully acclimated.
</P>
<P>
When asked if he was concerned about the Kings' lack of productivity, the
accommodating Hrudey said that he wasn't and added: "I just can't envision Luc
Robitaille, Mario Lemieux, Bernie Nicholls and so on down the line being held
off the board for too many games in a row."
</P>
<P>
Obviously, he meant Gretzky and not Lemieux?
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yeah," he said. "Sorry."
</P>
<P>
King Notes
</P>
<P>
Owner Bruce McNall of the Kings said Sunday that officials of the Minnesota
North Stars probably weren't serious this month when they offered him $25
million for Wayne Gretzky during the All-Star break. "Sometimes it's easy to
say those things when you know the other guy isn't going to take you up on it,"
he said. McNall acquired Gretzky from the Edmonton Oilers last summer for $15
million, two players and three first-round draft picks.
</P>
<P>
McNall, General Manager Rogie Vachon and Coach Robbie Ftorek flew from Edmonton
to Minneapolis Saturday to watch Robb Stauber, the University of Minnesota
goaltender who was college hockey's player of the year last season and whose
rights are owned by the Kings. Stauber apparently wasn't called on to make many
tough saves Saturday night in a 7-1 victory over Colorado College. "We're glad
we saw warmups so we could see him take some shots," Ftorek said. . . . The
Kings are 2-7-3 on the road since beating the Vancouver Canucks, 5-2, at
Vancouver on Dec. 23. . . . Kelly Hrudey, asked to evaluate his play after
making 33 saves: "Steady. That's all. I want to be steady night in and night
out, so the team knows what it's getting."

</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: DESPITE NHL TITLES, THE OILERS' POCKLINGTON WAS A MISERLY GIFT-GIVER,
KINGS' GRETZKY SAYS IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY.

<P>
The Kings' Wayne Gretzky has written his autobiography and, not surprisingly,
he doesn't have many kind words for his former boss, Edmonton Oiler owner Peter
Pocklington.
</P>
<P>
In "Gretzky: An Autobiography," the captain of the Kings describes Pocklington
as a cheapskate and says "sometimes he could be a complete jerk."
</P>
<P>
Pocklington sold Gretzky to the Kings in August of 1988 for a reported $18
million, only months after Gretzky led the Oilers to their fourth Stanley Cup
in five years.
</P>
<P>
In the book, co-written by Rick Reilly, Gretzky says the first time the Oilers
won the Stanley Cup, Pocklington gave diamond rings to everyone on the team.
But the size of the diamond varied depending on how Pocklington viewed
contributions to the team effort.
</P>
<P>
"That meant the trainers and the equipment guys got these tiny diamonds and the
guys who sat on the bench got a little bigger diamond, but not much, and so on
until you-know-who got a huge one," Gretzky says in the book.
</P>
<P>
"Here we'd spent the last five years trying to bang through everybody's skull
that we were a team . . . and Peter goes and ranks us all by karat."
</P>
<P>
Gretzky says he didn't know anything about the rings until then-assistant coach
John Muckler told him that the hand on the diamond meter went the wrong way
when Muckler got his ring appraised. Muckler, assistant coach Ted Green and all
the training staff were given fake diamonds.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky says then-coach Glen Sather made Pocklington get the coaches genuine
diamonds. "I was so embarrassed I took all the trainers' rings and had them
done properly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky says the Ferrari that Pocklington "gave" him when he tied Marcel Dionne
for the scoring title his first year in the NHL was actually a three-year
lease.
</P>
<P>
"I had to pay the licensing and insurance on it and I had the option to buy it
out at the end of the term. I ended up selling it and I think I lost $3,000 on
the deal. Any more gifts from Peter and I was going to go broke."
</P>
<P>
Gretzky says he was thrilled when Pocklington gave him a $50,000 bond for his
first-born child after he broke Gordie Howe's all-time assist record in 1987.
</P>
<P>
"Then I found out the thing matured at $50,000 -- in 25 years. What that bond
cost Peter was about $3,500."

FLAMES, CAPITALS EXPECT MONEY'S WORTH

<P>
Although President John Ziegler of the National Hockey League estimates that
playing in a series next September in Leningrad and Moscow will cost the
Washington Capitals and the Calgary Flames a little more than $1 million
apiece, the teams seem ecstatic about being chosen.
</P>
<P>
Capital General Manager David Poile said at the news conference to announce the
series: "This is a wonderful opportunity. I think it would have been foolish if
we hadn't taken advantage of this. There are certainly going to be many
exciting experiences, both on and off the ice, that will make this a trip to
remember and savor. This experience will be a shot in the arm to our entire
organization. It's something we are eagerly looking forward to."
</P>
<P>
The teams also will train in Finland and Sweden before going to the Soviet
Union for four games each against Soviet First Division teams.
</P>
<P>
Dave (Tiger) Williams, the all-time leader in penalty minutes -- 3,966 -- after
a 13-year career with Toronto, Vancouver, Detroit, the Kings and Hartford, is
having no second thoughts about how he played the game now that he has retired.
As the debate rages on about whether the NHL needs fighting, the Detroit News
asked Williams his opinion.
</P>
<P>
He had one, too: "Not once, never, did I have an owner come up to me
disgruntled with the way I played. . . . I never look back, never say I wish I
had never played like that. I was a 50-goal scorer in junior. I was cracky
enough to take the challenge, year-in, year-out. Maybe I should have sat back
and let somebody else do it. In Toronto in 1974, we had nobody else to do it. A
lot of nights it was tough slugging."
</P>
<P>
And furthermore, Williams said: "Bossy gets up at a banquet, he thinks he
scored 50 goals because of Mike Bossy. Never gave any credit to (Clark)
Gillies, who was 6-4, 225. . . . No credit to Billy Smith, who wielded his
goalie stick like an ax. If Bossy thought fighting was so bad, why not say so
when he was still playing?
</P>
<P>
"Fact remains, there are a lot of players, if they knew they had somebody
behind them, they'd be better. But few guys come up to you after a game to say,
'Thank you, you bailed me out.' How does a guy come up to you and say, 'Thanks.
I'm chicken. Thanks for saving my butt.' "
</P>
<P>
According to Bob Johnson, former University of Wisconsin coach, former Calgary
Flames coach and now executive director of the American Hockey Assn. of the
United States, his amateur league went from 12,000 to 14,000 teams this year
and is expected to go to 15,000 teams next year.
</P>
<P>
Johnson said: "They're worried about hockey in Russia. They have only 180
indoor rinks and they don't get kids. Registration in Canada is down. Ours is
up. Hockey is making an upswing. I'd say hockey today is better in the U.S.
than ever before. Even in Phoenix, it's up. Why? Because they get Prime Ticket
from Los Angeles and watch Wayne Gretzky."
</P>
<P>
Thanks, Dad. Bobby Hull went to Maple Leaf Garden Monday to see his son, Brett,
who scored a goal and three assists for the St. Louis Blues in a 7-5 victory
over Toronto. But when it was over, Bobby could only marvel at how bad both
teams were.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever made the last mistake won the game," he said, apparently making one
himself.
</P>
<P>
After recording a hat trick against the Kings Monday night, Guy Lafleur of the
Rangers said of Gretzky: "I can't really compete with him. He's got about 900
more points than me. I know I don't get the same ice time he does, but any time
I'm out there, I want to prove to everybody I'm not over the hill."
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old Hall of Famer added: "My main goal is to finish the season so I
can sign another contract for next year."
</P>
<P>
A week earlier, Lafleur was quoted in Newsday as saying: "I think I'm living
everybody's dream. Every ex-hockey player, every old-timer -- if they could,
they wish they had this opportunity."
</P>
<P>
Ron Duguay of the Kings made news and notes all around the National Hockey
League when, after suffering a concussion in a game last month, he returned to
the ice wearing a helmet for the first time. But by the time the nation's
hockey writers had noted that his decision to wear a helmet left just six
active players without helmets -- Washington's Rod Langway, Chicago's Doug
Wilson, Toronto's Al Secord and Brad Marsh, Winnipeg's Randy Carlyle and
Lafleur -- Duguay had taken his hat off again.
</P>
<P>
He has explained that he wanted the protection until he was sure he was
recovered from the concussion.
</P>
<P>
On playing in Los Angeles: "The players don't even know who they're playing
against sometimes, but they always know they're going to L.A.," Quebec Coach
Jean Perron said. "They have the white suit and pink tie packed."
</P>
<P>
King owner Bruce McNall, in explaining that "there's no such thing as too much
of a good thing" after acquiring goalie Kelly Hrudey from the Islanders, said:
"We have Wayne Gretzky, but if somebody asked me if we wanted Steve Yzerman,
too, I'd say, 'What would it take?' "
</P>
<P>
Hockey Notes
</P>
<P>
As Stanley Cup time draws closer, the Montreal Canadiens get tougher. The
Canadiens had a record of 10-1-1 in their last 12 games before Wednesday
night's game at Edmonton. Goalie Patrick Roy is 20-0-2 at home. . . . Mike
Vernon of the Calgary Flames is 14-0-1 in his last 15 games. . . . Mario
Lemieux's three assists, to go with goal No. 65, in a game Sunday night made
him the third player in NHL history to have 100 or more assists in a season.
The two others are Wayne Gretzky and Bobby Orr. . . . The Chicago Blackhawks
got a scare last week when goalie Alain Chevrier, acquired from Winnipeg last
month, went down with a knee injury. But the knee is just sprained and he is
expected back in two weeks. . . . Tim Kerr, finally back with the Philadelphia
Flyers after having five operations to correct damage in his left shoulder, had
a hat trick and two assists in the Flyers' 6-4 victory over the Rangers last
Wednesday.

A KINGDOM FOR A CHAMPIONSHIP;
</P>
<P>
BOB MILLER HAS SEEN L.A.'S HOCKEY TEAM TRY JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING -- AND NOTHING
SEEMS TO WORK
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
During Bob Miller's 17-year tenure as the Kings' announcer, not even training
camp was a time for optimism.
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of years in my career when the season started there was no
chance we could win the Stanley Cup," Miller said. "We'd be lucky to make the
playoffs in some of those years."
</P>
<P>
And making the National Hockey League playoffs isn't exactly tough. For the
past 11 seasons, 16 of the league's 21 teams have advanced to the playoffs
under the most charitable system in pro sports.
</P>
<P>
But things figured to be different this year.
</P>
<P>
Miller observed the Kings had a new attitude in September, when the team
reported to training camp in Hull, Canada, after finishing second in the Smythe
Division and fourth overall last season. The team was further buoyed by the
prospects of a full season from goalie Kelly Hrudey and the free-agent signing
of future Hall of Fame defenseman Larry Robinson.
</P>
<P>
"We went into this season with more optimism than any season I'd ever been
involved with," Miller said. "There truly was the feeling this team could win
the Stanley Cup."
</P>
<P>
But what began for the Kings as a season with the most optimism in team history
has become the most disappointing.
</P>
<P>
The team has fallen to fourth place in the Smythe Division and will be decided
underdogs against the defending Stanley Cup champion Calgary Flames in the
first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs, which open Wednesday. Games continue
Friday, Sunday and Tuesday, all on Prime Ticket.
</P>
<P>
Miller blames the team's front office for the Kings' problems.
</P>
<P>
"Through its history, this team has never seemed to have a plan to get where
they're going to go and staying with that plan," Miller said. "When Jack Kent
Cooke (who owned the team from its inception in 1967 until 1979) was here, the
plan was to trade all the draft choices and get veterans. That didn't work and
they scrapped that. Then they kept their draft choices, traded some other
people and that didn't work. So a couple of years into what might be a
five-year plan, they change again.
</P>
<P>
"They brought Robbie Ftorek in here as coach because they had young players.
Then they got Wayne Gretzky and changed again to having an older team, and that
hasn't worked.
</P>
<P>
"The best chance to win is with Wayne Gretzky here and surrounding him with the
right kind of people. Thankfully, that's not my job, but it goes back to the
scouts and the general manager (Rogie Vachon), who know more hockey than I do,
to go out and find those players. The maddening thing is that you see other
organizations-Edmonton's the prime example-trading someone the stature of a
Gretzky, and two years later competing again for the Stanley Cup."
</P>
<P>
Miller's journey to Los Angeles began in Iowa. After announcing the University
of Iowa's football and basketball games for the school's student-run
10,000-watt radio station, the Chicago native's first post-college job came as
a newscaster for an Oelwein, Iowa, radio station in 1960.
</P>
<P>
"I felt it was important to have a job when I graduated," Miller said. "I
graduated on a Friday and started work on Monday."
</P>
<P>
After four months in Oelwein, Miller was hired by WITI-TV in Milwaukee, first
as a news reporter and later as a sportscaster. In 1964, Miller became sports
director of WMTV in Madison, Wis. Seeking a return to play-by-play announcing,
two years later, Miller joined WKOW radio and television in Madison, which
carried the University of Wisconsin's games.
</P>
<P>
After announcing football and basketball, Miller became a hockey announcer in
1968, not out of design but of necessity.
</P>
<P>
"It was the only sport on campus that was winning consistently and drawing
standing-room-only crowds," Miller said. "The program director at the radio
station came to me and told me we're doing hockey next Friday, and since you're
the sports announcer, you're doing it. I'd never done a game before in my
life."
</P>
<P>
In the small world department, Miller's first hockey broadcast partner was Ira
Fistell, then teaching at Wisconsin and hosting a WKOW talk show. Fistell now
hosts a KABC Radio talk show.
</P>
<P>
Miller quickly found hockey to be much different from om er sports he had
announced.
</P>
<P>
"The more I did hockey, the more I found it was more challenging than any other
play-by-play I had ever done," Miller said. "Football is structured more for
radio. You have time to recap the play and set up the next play. You have a
couple of spotters and a statistician and all kinds of help. Basketball, you
have five guys, and they don't change until the whistle blows, and there are
only six or seven guys who play all night, so that's fairly easy.
</P>
<P>
"But in hockey, you're on your own. When they drop the puck, if you're not
prepared and haven't done your homework, it's going to be very evident."
</P>
<P>
Miller first sought to join the Kings in 1972, when the team's original
announcer, Jiggs McDonald, left after five seasons to announce for the
expansion Atlanta Flames.
</P>
<P>
Venerable Lakers announcer Chick Hearn was in charge of finding a new
announcer. Miller said, "I sent him a tape and talked with him. He told me he
liked my stuff and would recommend me for the job."
</P>
<P>
However, Cooke overrode Hearn's suggestion, hiring Roy Storey instead. But
everything worked out for for Miller. Staying at Wisconsin, he broadcast the
Badgers' 1973 NCAA hockey championship, the only title-winning team Miller has
been involved with in his 30-year career.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the word out of Los Angeles was Kings management was unhappy with
Storey's work and would again be searching for an announcer.
</P>
<P>
Miller sent in new tapes to Hearn. As luck would have it, Miller was in Chicago
for a meeting when the Lakers were also there.
</P>
<P>
"I waited around their hotel for about four hours, thinking, 'If I just could
talk to Chick in person and let him know that I'm interested.' " Miller said.
"I went up and introduced myself to him. It was only a meeting of five minutes.
He said I think I might have something for you."
</P>
<P>
Four months later, Miller was offered the job. But while in Southern California
to sign his contract, the Pittsburgh Penguins called Miller's home in
Wisconsin, leaving word they wanted him to be their broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
"Chick was very gracious and told me to call Pittsburgh and find out what the
deal was, and if it was a better one to take it. I always appreciated that
attitude. It wasn't a better deal, and I'm very happy with the choice I made."

OILERS EXPECTED TO TRADE CARSON WITHIN A WEEK
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Edmonton Oilers are not going to let Jimmy Carson sit home in Redondo Beach
for long. General Manager Glen Sather is considering several offers for the
high-scoring, 21-year-old center, and is expected to trade him within a week.
</P>
<P>
When goalie Grant Fuhr "retired" from hockey last summer, the Oilers simply sat
back and waited for him to unretire, which he did before the start of training
camp.
</P>
<P>
When Paul Coffey held out at the start of the 1987 season, the Oilers let him
sit until the end of November, then dealt him to Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
But when Carson quit the team last Saturday, the Oilers started taking bids.
There obviously was going to be no reconciliation between the Oilers and
Carson, who wants to play in the United States, and he's much too valuable a
commodity to waste.
</P>
<P>
Until the Oilers make a deal, though, their roster has a gaping hole where once
there was Wayne Gretzky. Carson, the young talent sent to the Oilers as the
main on-ice compensation for Gretzky, scored 100 points -- 49 goals, 51 assists
-- for the Oilers last season.
</P>
<P>
To lose Gretzky for Carson was bad enough.
</P>
<P>
So there will be a deal made soon. But don't expect Carson to be back with the
Kings. Just about every other U.S. team has been mentioned.
</P>
<P>
New King teammate Larry Robinson on Wayne Gretzky: "He doesn't wear that number
for nothing. That's about the percentage of plays that he is going to execute."
</P>
<P>
Boston Coach Mike Milbury on shutting out Gretzky at the Forum for the first
time since Gretzky became a King:
</P>
<P>
"If I were him, after the week he just went through, I would have been in a
fog. He had some flashes and good chances. I don't know how the guy does it.
He's a marvel to me. If you one time deny him any points in the game, you've
got to feel really proud of yourself. It's a tribute to him that he gets other
teams up just to play against him. That's a tremendous tribute to a guy."
</P>
<P>
Compuware Corp. of Detroit wants to buy an NHL team and has inquired about the
Oilers. According to Compuware's hockey director, Jim Rutherford, Oiler owner
Peter Pocklington, "didn't say yes . . . didn't say no."
</P>
<P>
So, Rutherford concludes, "I guess there's always a chance."
</P>
<P>
When is a tie worse than kissing your sister? When your "rebuilding" team is
about to pull the upset of the young season, when you're leading the defending
Stanley Cup champions by five goals with less than four minutes left in front
of your home fans. Then a tie is sickening.
</P>
<P>
"I hope I never see another game like that," Quebec's Peter Stastny said after
Calgary scored three goals in a 27-second span and then added two more -- two
short-handed goals -- just four seconds apart to come up with the 8-8 tie on
the Nordiques' ice.
</P>
<P>
Quebec Coach Michel Bergeron, who knew he had his work cut out for him when he
took this job after being fired by the Rangers at the end of last season, said:
"I knew things would be hard this year because of all the changes we've made,
but this is hard to stomach. There was general panic out there. It's a real
shock. This is worse than a loss for sure."
</P>
<P>
Even though he said he had "closed the book" on Bob Probert when he was
arrested last March for smuggling cocaine into the United States, Detroit Coach
Jacques Demers showed up in court Tuesday to speak as a character witness
before Probert was sentenced.
</P>
<P>
Detroit President Mike Illitch and General Manager Jim Devellano also appeared
on Probert's behalf, and eight Red Wing players were in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Patrick Duggan sentenced Probert, a Canadian, to three
months in prison and fined him $2,000. Also taken into consideration was
Probert's agreement to plead guilty to the charge, which carries a maximum
penalty of 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
A Canadian attorney for Probert, Maria Carroccia, said that there would be a
hearing with the NHL on whether Probert will be allowed to play hockey again,
but that hearing will not be held until after a deportation hearing Oct. 26.
</P>
<P>
Probert has been in the United States since his arrest last March, undergoing
substance abuse treatment at the Holly Gardens clinic. He has said that he will
continue his treatment for alcohol abuse while in prison.
</P>
<P>
Hockey Notes
</P>
<P>
Alan Eagleson, head of the NHL players' association, reports that the average
NHL salary is $200,000, boosted by $4,000 by the million-dollar contracts
signed by Pittsburgh's Mario Lemieux and Detroit's Steve Yzerman. . . .
Minnesota was the last unbeaten team in the league before losing at Detroit
Thursday. The North Stars' surprising 5-1-1 start is their best in seven
seasons.
</P>
<P>
Montreal defenseman Chris Chelios, the first American captain of the Canadiens
since 1909, has hired a tutor to teach him French. He said he thinks he owes it
to the people." . . . Paul Coffey assisted on all of Pittsburgh's goals in a
9-3 loss at St. Louis Wednesday, increasing his total to 601 assists. He is the
sixth defenseman in the NHL to reach 600.

Word from France is that Bob Gainey, who retired from the Montreal Canadiens to
become a player-coach, has not only played and coached but has also driven the
Zamboni between periods. . . . Pittsburgh center John Cullen will be out for at
least two weeks with Type A infectious hepatitis. Team officials who have been
in contact with him recently and all of his teammates have been offered gamma
globulin shots to ward off the infection.

At Montreal Wednesday night, a fan in a Montreal sweater jumped onto the ice
and used a small, souvenir stick to knock a puck into the Calgary net, another
fan came onto the ice with a banner and two more lowered themselves from the
rafters on ropes, holding a banner to promote CKMF, a radio station that was
offering a $25,000 prize for the best stunt. After Montreal won the game, 2-1,
Chelios said: "Now that we have won, it was funny. If we'd lost, I don't know
how funny it would have been." And Calgary's Sergei Makarov said: "In the
Soviet Union, the home team would have been penalized two minutes."

<HL> Who's News: Pocklington, Scrappy and Outspoken, Weathers Heat Over Gretzky Trade </HL>
<AUTHOR> Gary Lamphier (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<IN> BIO </IN>
<TEXT>
   Canadian financier Peter Pocklington is used to being in scraps.
The outspoken owner of the National Hockey League's Edmonton Oilers has been sued by a psychic, held for ransom, reviled as a unionbuster and roundly thumped as an aspiring politician.

   But after Mr. Pocklington stunned the sports world last week by trading hockey hero Wayne Gretzky to the lowly Kings of Los Angeles, he found himself in a bigger pickle than ever.

   The issue: did Peter Puck, as the 47-year-old Mr. Pocklington is nicknamed, initiate the trade for Edmonton's favorite son and the most prolific scorer in hockey history?

   Mr. Pocklington says the trade was Mr. Gretzky's idea.
Mr. Gretzky initially agreed, saying he wanted the move for the benefit of his new wife, Los Angeles actress Janet Jones, and the couple's expected child.
But by Friday he had changed his story, telling a Toronto newspaper that Mr. Pocklington indeed forced the trade.

   For the moment, Mr. Pocklington may be the most disliked man in Edmonton, an Alberta city of about 600,000 that is fiercely proud of its four-time NHL champion Oilers.
Fans canceled season tickets, and there were rumblings about the team's future.
Last week, he defended trading players as necessary to maintaining a sports franchise.

   These troubles may soon pass.
Mr. Pocklington has survived other crises.
A former car salesman who in the 1970s rode the crest of Edmonton's real estate boom, he now has interests mainly in the meatpacking and food-processing businesses.
He estimated last week that total annual revenue of his business interests, which are closely held, is about 1.5 billion Canadian dollars (US$1.23 billion).

   The transition has been bumpy.
At one meat-packing plant Mr. Pocklington locked out union workers and brought in non-union replacements, which led to violent demonstrations outside the plant.
Three years ago he was sued (unsuccessfully) by a psychic who said he came to her for financial advice.

   When the value of Mr. Pocklington's real estate assets fell with oil prices in the early 1980s, his debts swelled.
Creditors grew restless.
Receivers took over his dealerships and seized his cars.
He sold off assets and even used the Oilers as security for a loan to keep his operations afloat.

   On top of all that, Mr. Pocklington in 1983 was held for ransom briefly by an armed intruder in his Edmonton home, and in his rescue by police he was injured.
Before Canada's last federal election in 1984, he made a bid for the leadership post of the Progressive Conservative party.
The nomination was won by Brian Mulroney, who went on to become prime minister.

   Mr. Pocklington, a vocal proponent of free enterprise, survived and rebuilt, albeit with financial help from Alberta's government.
In the past 13 months he spent $53 million to acquire a large dairy and a food company.
"When I first met him, he was interested in any business that walked.
Now he's much more focused and disciplined," says James Leech, president of Union Enterprises Ltd., which sold the businesses.

   Despite the storm of protest over the Gretzky trade and the way it was handled, some say Mr. Pocklington may yet have the last laugh.
In return for his 27-year-old star player and two others, Mr. Pocklington received 20-year-old Kings star Jimmy Carson, a second talented youngster, three high draft picks and an undisclosed cash sum, believed to be about $15 million.

   "One of the reasons the Oilers will be successful for many years is that I don't mind trading off my people," says Mr. Pocklington, who last year traded away another Oilers star, Paul Coffey.
"That's why the Edmonton Oilers won't be another New York Islanders."

   Jim Devellano, now general manager of the Detroit Red Wings and the man credited with building the Islanders into the NHL's premier team before the Oilers dynasty, agrees.
"It's a deal I would have made if I was in his shoes," he says.
"What Pocklington did was to perpetuate the Oilers well into the 1990s."

   Even Ed Mio, the best man at Mr. Gretzky's wedding, sees logic in the deal.
"I don't want to criticize Peter.
He's got a business to run.
If you look at it, it's not a bad deal from a business standpoint."

GRETZKY FIRST TO WIN NHL'S MOST VALUABLE TROPHY FOR NINTH TIME

Wayne Gretzky of the Kings was named the National Hockey League's most valuable
player Wednesday night, winning the Hart Trophy for a record ninth time.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky became the first player in NHL history to win the same award nine
times. Bobby Orr won the Norris Trophy as best defenseman eight times.
</P>
<P>
Mario Lemieux of Pittsburgh, who broke Gretzky's eight-year reign as MVP last
season and has won the last two scoring titles, was second in the voting,
conducted by the Professional Hockey Writers Assn. Detroit's Steve Yzerman,
third behind Lemieux and Gretzky in the scoring race, was third.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, who led Edmonton to four Stanley Cups in five years, was traded to the
Kings by the Oilers last August in a blockbuster deal. With Gretzky, the Kings
improved by 12 victories and 23 points, finishing second in the Smythe Division
and beating the Oilers in the first round of the playoffs. They also set
attendance records, selling out 24 of 40 regular-season home games.
</P>
<P>
Gretzky finished the season with 54 goals and 168 points in 78 games and he now
has 1,837 career points, 13 short of the all-time record held by Gordie Howe.
</P>
<P>
Four members of the Montreal Canadiens, who lost the Stanley Cup to Calgary,
received individual awards. Patrick Roy won the Vezina Trophy as the best
goaltender, defenseman Chris Chelios won the Norris Trophy and Guy Carbonneau
repeated as winner of the Selke Trophy, given to the best defensive forward.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Montreal's Pat Burns won the Jack Adams Trophy as the league's top
coach, an award voted by the NHL Broadcasters Assn.
</P>
<P>
Roy led all goaltenders with a 2.47 goals-against average and had a 33-5-6
record as the Canadiens finished first in the league in defense.
</P>
<P>
Chelios had 15 goals and 58 assists for 73 points, third on the Canadiens in
scoring. Carbonneau, who also had his best offensive season with 26 goals, was
one of the NHL's top penalty-killers and led the Canadiens at plus-37.
</P>
<P>
Calgary had only one award winner. Joe Mullen captured the Lady Byng Trophy,
given for skillful and gentlemanly play. Mullen had 51 goals and 59 assists for
110 points while taking only 16 minutes in penalties.
</P>
<P>
Mullen, the 1987 winner, beat out last year's winner, Montreal's Mats Naslund,
and Gretzky, who won in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Brian Leetch of the New York Rangers won the Calder Trophy as the rookie of the
year. Leetch, who came to the Rangers after serving as captain of the U.S.
Olympic Team, set an NHL record for goals by a rookie defenseman with 23. He
added 48 assists for 71 points, leading all rookies in scoring.
</P>
<P>
Leetch is the first Ranger to win the award since Steve Vickers in 1973.
</P>
<P>
Teammate Tony Granato and Vancouver's Trevor Linden also were considered for
the honor.
</P>
<P>
Bryan Trottier of the New York Islanders won the King Clancy Memorial Award,
given for humanitarian contributions to hockey. The Clancy Award, now in its
second year, was won last year by Calgary's Lanny McDonald.

ROBINSON AGREES TO A TWO-YEAR PACT WITH KINGS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last summer, owner Bruce McNall of the Kings committed millions of dollars to
get Wayne Gretzky from the Edmonton Oilers. Now he has come up with another
million or so to get defenseman Larry Robinson from the Montreal Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
How long can this go on?
</P>
<P>
"Until we stop owning the team or drop dead or go broke doing it," McNall said
Wednesday at the Forum in announcing that the Canadiens had not matched the
Kings' offer for the services of Robinson, a free agent since July 1.
</P>
<P>
"I think we've made it fairly obvious that our desire is to bring a Stanley Cup
to Los Angeles as soon as possible. Larry Robinson will help us do that,"
McNall said.
</P>
<P>
Robinson accepted a contract from the Kings to play for two years, with an
option year, for a reported $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
It was not easy for Robinson, 38, to leave the Canadiens, a team he has played
for all 17 years of his National Hockey League career. Robinson won two Norris
Trophies as the league's best defenseman, and played on six Stanley Cup
championship teams.
</P>
<P>
"This was a big step for me," Robinson said. "I know I'm not a young puppy
anymore, but I hope I can help them win a championship here."
</P>
<P>
Robinson asked to clarify reports that during contract negotiations, Canadien
General Manager Serge Savard refused to assure him that his No. 19 would be
retired.
</P>
<P>
"Donny (Cape, Robinson's agent) asked Serge if they were thinking of doing it,
and Serge said he couldn't give him an answer," Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
"But I never made any demands. I don't think it's something that you demand.
It's an honor that comes to you."
</P>
<P>
Jim Fox of the Kings thinks that is an honor that is sure to come to Robinson.
So when Fox -- who has worn No. 19 for the Kings since he joined the club in
1980 -- heard that the deal was official, he immediately offered Robinson his
number.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody asked me," Fox said. "I just said right away that he has to have No.
19. He's going to be a Hall of Famer five years from now. I didn't even have to
think about it. I just did it out of respect for him."
</P>
<P>
Robinson said he appreciated Fox's offer. He had told the Kings he would wear
any number available.
</P>
<P>
Among the Kings who showed up at the Forum to welcome the new teammate was Ron
Duguay. He said that he came "out of respect for the man," adding: "We're just
that much closer to the Stanley Cup. . . . We're bringing in winners."
</P>
<P>
Said McNall: "A few years ago, people thought that being sent to Los Angeles
was like being exiled. Hopefully, with Wayne's presence here, we're changing
that."
</P>
<P>
Robinson said that the idea of playing with Gretzky was "a joy." As a
defensemen, he has had more than enough of playing against Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
"Wayne has shown what he can bring to a club," Robinson said. "The Kings moved
up from pretty low (18th overall) to fourth last year. Hopefully, we'll up that
a little."
</P>
<P>
As for his age, Robinson said: "Everybody says I've been a teacher my whole
career. I don't know about that. But I do think that the best teaching is to
lead by example. . .
</P>
<P>
"They've been telling me I've been over the hill for the last five or six
years. Yet when they need someone in a big situation, they call on me. I've
always tried to look after myself. I have taken care of myself. I can't do what
I did at 24 or 25, but, then, I wasn't the greatest at 24 or 25."
</P>
<P>
Robinson's career took off right after that, however. He was a first-team
all-star in 1977, 1979 and 1980, a second-team all-star in 1978, 1981 and 1986.
And he has played in the All-Star game nine times.
</P>
<P>
He won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player in the playoffs in
1978.
</P>
<P>
The Kings figure he has a few good years left, even though he scored his first
NHL goal against Rogie Vachon, now the Kings' general manager.
</P>
<P>
Vachon, who was out of town Wednesday, has said that Robinson will add
"stability, character and leadership" and bring the Kings a "giant step closer
to a Stanley Cup championship."
</P>
<P>
Asked what he thought the Kings need most, Robinson answered: "Ice."
</P>
<P>
The Forum was set up for TeamTennis and that's not something he found at the
Forum in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
But he had earlier said that one thing he liked about Los Angeles was that
there is a hockey off-season. In Montreal, there is no down time, as he put it.
</P>
<P>
As for what it will be like for him to go back to the Forum in Montreal and
play against the Canadiens, Robinson said: "Thank goodness we don't have to go
there until the 11th of December."
</P>
<P>
But the Kings' training camp this year is at Hull, Quebec, a short drive from
Montreal. And Robinson will be reporting there Sept. 7.
