RAP'S PRINCE SOON TO BE TV ROYALTY?
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Will Smith, a 21-year-old rapper who calls himself the Fresh Prince, just got a
job with NBC. What is expected of him, as implied by his boss, NBC
Entertainment president Brandon Tartikoff, are three things:
</P>
<P>
* To bring the black street world of hip-hop to American TV audiences.
</P>
<P>
* To star in a sitcom bearing his name that will be the network's first
"hit-the-ground-running hit" since "The Golden Girls" five years ago.
</P>
<P>
* To be a "big, breakout star" along the lines of, oh, say Eddie Murphy.
</P>
<P>
"Brandon Tartikoff is making me nervous, comparing me to Eddie Murphy and stuff
like that," Smith said not long after Tartikoff made the comments.
</P>
<P>
"Hey, hey, slow down a little bit." He chuckled. "Let me practice first. This
has all happened so fast my head's spinning a little bit."
</P>
<P>
"The Fresh Prince of Bel Air" is backed by first-time TV producer Quincy Jones.
It's about a funky byproduct of Philadelphia's gang-infested streets who is
sent out West to live with his wealthy upper-crust cousins, whose plush
lifestyle has buried their black roots.
</P>
<P>
Smith quickly points out that the sitcom "is not about rapping. It took me a
while to make NBC understand -- and they understand now -- they don't want rap.
They think they want rap performers, but no. What they want is a hip show.
</P>
<P>
"Rap music -- which a lot of white America doesn't understand -- rap music is
not just a music. Rap music is a subculture: hip-hop. It's a style of dress, an
attitude, a look, a language. It's more than just music."
</P>
<P>
A middle-class kid from Philadelphia who never acted before, Smith is being
asked to shoulder a load that might wobble the knees of Murphy himself. He's
network television's first embodiment of a fresh generation. He's a prime-time
tap into the urban street market, which is pumping rap music, loud new fashions
and an Afrocentric political consciousness into mainstream society faster than
the booming bass tracks of a def jam.
</P>
<P>
Warren Littlefield, Tartikoff's right-hand man at NBC, said that the network
had been searching for a way to catch the rap tiger by the tail for some time.
</P>
<P>
"We were all looking at Newsweek and Time and seeing these cover stories (about
rap music)," he explained. "I was personally watching 'Yo! MTV Raps' and
feeling waves of something new and contemporary running through various streams
of culture in America. We felt there was a drum beat going on out there, and we
looked at our development (schedule) and said, 'It's not represented.' "
</P>
<P>
Smith, half of D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince, endeared himself to kids
everywhere in 1988 with the sympathetic rap hit "Parents Just Don't
Understand," about a shopping trip he takes with his mother for back-to-school
clothes. Although the duo's record sales have slipped since then, the
bubble-gum rappers are still hopping. Their 900-number hotline, which will be
used to promote an upcoming album, has set a music industry precedent by
grossing a reported $10 million since its debut two years ago.
</P>
<P>
"I think Will's a star," said Jones, a celebrated music producer/composer with
19 Grammys to his credit. "He really makes it pop. He's got this sense of
timing that's unbelievable. Right now he's not even thinking about it; he's
just doing his own thing. He's going to be dangerous when he finds out where
the cameras are. "
</P>
<P>
The real-life inspiration for "Fresh Prince" came from co-producer Benny
Medina. "It was partially based upon the way I was brought up, a juxtaposition
I was thrown into at an early age," Medina said. "I came from a broken home in
Watts, and I was in and out of juvenile detention facilities and foster homes."
</P>
<P>
Medina was living at St. Elmo Village, a community home center in Los Angeles,
when Jack Elliot, a white TV and film composer living in Beverly Hills with a
wife and three kids, decided to give Medina a chance. "They let me move in with
them," he said. "I fixed up their garage in the back of the house and became
part of the family. The deal was I had to keep a job, keep the grades up and be
respectful of household rules."
</P>
<P>
Medina wound up at Beverly Hills High School with the children of Motown
kingpin Berry Gordy and eventually started working for Gordy as a junior
executive at Motown. Today, Medina is head of black music at Warner Bros.
Recently, when he and partner Jeff Pollack began developing TV projects,
including an animated series called "Hip-Hop Junior High," Medina was thinking
back to his childhood.
</P>
<P>
Medina met Smith in December backstage at "The Arsenio Hall Show," which was
celebrating Jones' acclaimed comeback album "Back on the Block." Smith asked
Medina for directions to a Laker game. Not long after, Pollack began hearing
secondhand raves about Smith after the rapper's performance on Disney's
35th-anniversary TV special for NBC. Director John Landis cast Smith in the
special based on his energetic performance in the music video for "Parents Just
Don't Understand."
</P>
<P>
Medina and Pollack contacted Smith, who hooked into the project immediately.
"It was real," Smith said. "That's what everyone's missing on TV. You've
probably seen that Tide commercial where the kid stands up on the washing
machine and starts rapping, 'Mom my clothes are dirty/Gotta get some Tide/Go
get some.' America needs to see that there are intelligent, articulate black
people, and what better place to see them than on television?"
</P>
<P>
The producers took their idea to Quincy Jones, who they knew was meeting with
NBC to develop TV projects of his own for Warner Communications. "I'm not a big
fan of TV at all," said Jones, who is also working on a syndicated talk show
with Jesse Jackson, which will air on KCAL-TV Channel 9 this fall. "But blacks
have been repressed on TV for so long. When I was young, there was nothing on
the radio for blacks. It was like black people didn't exist.
</P>
<P>
"Now there's such a vibrant new culture, in all its different hues, that has
never been dealt with before. Everyone always thought of blacks in a
sharecropper situation. A white person isolated in Iowa sees blacks on the TV
set and thinks that's what black people are like, and they're always wrong. I
want to change that."
</P>
<P>
"Fresh Prince" was in line with NBC's fall goal of more youth-oriented
programming. But by this time it was mid-March -- late to get a new fall show
going -- and there was no script, no cast and no Fresh Prince. Their future
star was in Indiana on a concert tour.
</P>
<P>
NBC wanted to see Smith -- "Now!" -- to find out if he could act. So he
traveled 17 hours by bus and plane to make it to Los Angeles. A screen test was
arranged at Jones' home on his 57th birthday, the same night he received a
lifetime achievement award from "Soul Train."
</P>
<P>
Smith emerged from an upstairs bedroom, where he was studying a scene from an
old sitcom pilot that was developed for singer Morris Day. NBC's Littlefield
described the scene: "You gotta know, if you're a network programmer and it's
late in the pilot season and you're looking for a hit show, my heart starts to
pound at this point. Will says, 'OK, so I'm just going to, like, read this
scene, huh? Now, who are the guys from the network?'
</P>
<P>
"Then he did a couple of little scenes from this failed sitcom script, and he
just hit it. If he's a ball player, he hit a home run. We stood up, hugged him.
I kissed Quincy and said, 'Thank you. Let's go to work.' "

O.C.'S BARDEUX;

<P>
DANCE DUO STEPS OUT OF THE SHADOWS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the beginning, Bardeux was a musical marketing concept in search of a comely
embodiment.
</P>
<P>
The concept belonged to Jon St. James, the Orange County record producer best
known for his work with Stacey Q.
</P>
<P>
St. James' thinking wasn't exactly revolutionary, but events have proven it
sound: if you could find a couple of stylish, sexy-looking young women, give
them a peppy dance rhythm to shake and shimmy to and some light, catchy
melodies to sing -- well, the idea had sales potential.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Bardeux's debut album, "Bold As Love," produced one Top 40 hit,
"When We Kiss." Two other singles from the album did well on the dance charts.
Now "I Love to Bass," the first single from Bardeux's new album, "Shangri La,"
is moving up both the pop and black music charts.
</P>
<P>
Concept vindicated. But concept-embodier a little resentful -- at least when it
comes to the less-than-respectful reception Bardeux gets from some beholders in
the music press.
</P>
<P>
"The resentment's there only when people come up to me and give me ignorance,"
said Stacy Smith, a former Cal State Fullerton political science major who is
better known to Bardeux fans as Acacia, the fair-haired half of the concept.
"Don't try to treat me like some kind of bimbo, 'cause I'm not."
</P>
<P>
In fact, Smith came off sounding intelligent and self-possessed as she spoke on
the phone last week from St. James' studio in La Habra. She and her new singing
partner, Melanie Taylor, had been preparing for a Bardeux blitz that included
shooting a promotional video for "I Love to Bass," and a national tour that
begins Thursday night at Carnivale, a dance club in Smith's hometown of
Fullerton (the tour has Bardeux headlining a bill of Enigma Records acts that
also includes Japanese singer Hiroko and April Wayne, a swimsuit model whose
first record is being produced by St. James).
</P>
<P>
"If you're a good-looking girl to begin with, you're going to be dealing with
that your whole life," Smith said of the "bimbo" stigma. In Bardeux's case, any
such stigma would seem to be amplified by the fact that the concept calls for
the duo not only to look good, but to sing songs that typically emphasize a
kittenish, dance-floor seductiveness.
</P>
<P>
But even that quality deserves some respect, Smith said. "As far as being sexy,
that has to come from within. You can't just put that on."
</P>
<P>
Smith points out that she has her share of creative input as lyricist and takes
an active role in promoting Bardeux's business interests. It's not a case, she
insists, of a pair of passive pop starlets having their career orchestrated by
a producer-as-Svengali.
</P>
<P>
"There are so many girls out there who are producer puppets. They want to lump
Bardeux in that. But a producer can only do so much. When you get up on stage,
there's nobody holding your hand up there and if you can't carry your own
weight, you're going to sink."
</P>
<P>
Smith, 24, was carrying breakfast trays at Coco's restaurant in Brea when St.
James, one of the regulars, decided that his waitress had the look and
personality to make her Bardeux material.
</P>
<P>
"When he finally asked me if I could sing, I didn't know who he was," recalled
Smith, who is now St. James' girlfriend as well as his musical collaborator.
"Who was this slimy guy saying he would make me a star? I took two friends to
the audition as chaperones. I wasn't going to go by myself until I found out he
was legitimate."
</P>
<P>
Until that point, Smith's only pop-music experience had come as singer in "a
really terrible garage band" that never had performed publicly.
</P>
<P>
"It was always a fantasy-type thing for me to think about being in the music
business," she said. "But I never took it seriously enough until the
opportunity landed in my lap. It's something I probably wouldn't have knocked
myself out to get," she admitted. But, she says, opportunity brought with it a
determination to work hard.
</P>
<P>
Smith's first partner in Bardeux, Jaz, was recruited on the strength of a demo
tape. The singers had a similar vocal quality: the thin, girlish tone that has
marked most female dance-pop generated in Madonna's wake.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Smith says, Jaz decided that she would rather have more time
for a personal life than keep up Bardeux's pace as dance-pop careerists. Smith
found her replacement singing in one of the rock-oldies revues at the Hop in
Fountain Valley.
</P>
<P>
"I noticed Melanie in the show. I was really impressed that night after night,
although she was doing the same show, she had a smile on her face," Smith said.
"She had a conviction about the business." Taylor, 26, also had a good,
breathy-but-full-bodied singing voice, somewhat like Diana Ross'. It enabled
Bardeux to achieve more vocal contrast on "Shangri La" and to explore funkier,
R&amp;B-oriented material. Smith thinks the fact that Bardeux is now an
interracial duo may have helped it to get its first play on black radio
formats.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that on my own, a middle-class (white) girl from Orange County
would have been accepted on the black charts," she said. "But (choosing Taylor)
was never a question of was she black or was she white. I just hit it off with
her and she was the best qualified."
</P>
<P>
The songs on "Shangri La" offer a surface sheen of catchiness and an energetic
dance pulse, but the themes and lyrics are tried-and-true love-and-lust stuff
that shows little individuality or depth. So far, Bardeux remains more a
commercial concept than a vehicle for interesting or meaningful expression.
</P>
<P>
"I have a stack of notebooks with lyrics," Smith said. "I have lots of songs
that have nothing to do with 'Honey, kiss me' or 'Let's go out and dance.' But
right now I'm doing pop music. If they want to buy something serious, let them
get that from Tracy Chapman. I don't think they want to hear that from Bardeux.
I think I've written a really good song about child abuse, and another about
pollution and apathy, but these are things I don't think are right for this
particular project."
</P>
<P>
One thing that Bardeux would like to change is the fact that its shows --
including the coming date at Carnivale -- are sung to prerecorded music rather
than with live accompaniment. These "track shows," in which the use of backing
tracks renders the supposedly live singing suspect as well, are common in
dance-pop circles.
</P>
<P>
"You don't get to ad lib the way a true live performance would be," Smith said.
"That's something Melanie and I look forward to doing. The live situation is
always the best and we're working toward that. At this point it's more
cost-effective to do track shows. It would be wonderful to have a band."
</P>
<P>
Smith says her transformation from a college student waiting on tables between
classes to a dance-club glamour object has not drastically changed her material
circumstances. She still lives at home with her parents in Fullerton when
Bardeux isn't on the road.
</P>
<P>
"To dispel any myth that you're making millions as soon as you're on the radio,
I did buy myself a new car on the first album (earnings), but I'm not exactly
rolling in dough," she said. "My parents are still very helpful when I need it.
I'm waiting for the big check."
</P>
<P>
Bardeux, Hiroko and April Wayne play Thursday night at 10 at Carnivale, 1401 S.
Lemon St., Fullerton. Tickets: $8. Information: (714) 441-1666.

<TEXT>
   Bobby McFerrin's feel-good song ``Don't Worry,
Be Happy'' was the choice of the music academy for song and record
of the year over Tracy Chapman's downhearted ``Fast Car'' at the
31st Grammy awards.
   McFerrin, the vocal gymnast who uses his voice and body as an
instrument, won four Grammys Wednesday night, while Miss Chapman, a
shy 25-year-old folksinger from Boston whose self-titled album dealt
with racism, poverty and desperation, won three trophies.
   ``I think it was so popular because it went to the spirit,''
McFerrin said backstage of his song. ``I think, given the mood at
the time, it was such that people wanted something uplifting and
jovial and funny. The tempo was nice.''
   Both big winners lost to George Michael for album of the year. He
won for his platinum ``Faith,'' a crossover blend of ballads, rock
and soulful pop, including the hit single ``I Want Your Sex.''
   Fifteen of the Grammys were handed out in a 3-hour, 20-minute
long ceremony broadcast live to the East Coast by CBS. The rest of
the 76 awards for the National Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences were handed out during a pre-broadcast ceremony.
   Singer Anita Baker took two rhythm &amp; blues trophies for her
``Giving You The Best That I Got,'' including best female
performance and a shared songwriting award with Skip Scarborough and
Randy Holland.
   In country music, Randy Travis won best male vocal with ``Old 8 X
10'' and K.T. Oslin won female vocal honors for ``Hold Me,'' which
also was voted best country song. The Judds won best country group
for ``Give a Little Love.''
   Willie Dixon, the 73-year-old blues master whose songs have been
hits for so many rock groups, finally won his first Grammy for his
``Hidden Charms'' album in the best traditional blues recording
category. He mounted the stage with the aid of a cane and received a
standing ovation.
   ``I've been in the music business for about 50 years,'' Dixon
said backstage. ``It's about time, don't you think?''
   Dixon's compositions for rock groups include such hits as
``Spoonful'' for the British supergroup Cream in the late 1960s.
   McFerrin, asked by reporters about the difference in musical
style between him and Chapman, said he didn't like the idea of
competition with her.
   ``I am touched by her music,'' he said.``This is by no means a
gauge of artistic ability.''
   Besides best song and record, McFerrin won best pop male vocal
for ``Don't Worry'' and the male jazz vocal award for the song
``Brothers.''
   Chapman did not appear backstage to talk to reporters. Her
Grammys were for best contemporary folk recording, best new artist,
and best pop female vocal performance for ``Fast Car,'' a song about
a woman trying to escape poverty by driving away from it with her
jobless boyfriend.
   Chapman's debut album deals with such subjects as poverty, racism
and revolution and was a surprise hit in 1988, selling more than 3
million copies.
   ``I want to thank my family _ my mother, who bought me my first
guitar, my sister, who's always been my best audience, best critic
and best friend,'' Chapman said tearfully as she accepted the award
for best female pop vocalist.
   A check of Grammy records showed ``Don't Worry, Be Happy'' was
the first a capella song, or one without instrumental background, to
win best song and record of the year. Another a capella group, the
sextet Take 6, won the soul gospel duo-group award for their
self-titled debut album.
   In a new category, hard rock-metal vocal or instrumental, the
high-voltage rockers Jethro Tull won for ``Crest of a Knave,''
defeating newer groups such as Metallica and Jane's Addiction.
   Another new category _ rap _ was hit by a boycott by some of the
major nominees. The best song was ``Parents Just Don't Understand''
by D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince, who were among those not
attending the show because the award was given during the
pre-telecast presentations.
   ``I personally felt that the boycott was negative,'' said Kool
Moe Dee, an award presenter. ``I understand that they felt a little
upset because they didn't get the rap segment on television, but I
think it was more important for the rap fans, for America, to see
rappers in a different light.''
   Neil Dorfsman was named producer of the year for British rocker
Sting's album, ``... Nothing Like The Sun.''
   The late Roy Orbison won his third Grammy, sharing best country
vocal collaboration with country singer k.d. lang for their version
of Orbison's ``Crying.''
   Tina Turner won the female rock vocalist prize with ``Tina Live
in Europe.'' Robert Palmer won male rock vocalist for ``Simply
Irresistible.''
   Manhattan Transfer, the harmonious jazz vocal quartet, were
awarded best pop performance by a duo or group for the single
``Brasil.''
   Pop singer Linda Ronstadt took honors in the Mexican-American
category for her album ``Canciones De Mi Padre,'' dedicated to her
father's heritage.
   Terence Trent D'Arby won best male rhythm &amp; blues vocal for
``Introducing The Hardline According to Terence Trent D'Arby.''
   Irish rockers U2 won for rock performance by a group for the
single ``Desire'' and music video performance for ``Where The
Streets Have No Name.''
   Lifetime achievement awards were given to dancer-actor Fred
Astaire, blues chanteuse Bessie Smith, jazz pianist Art Tatum,
cellist Pablo Casals, violinist Jascha Heifetz, singer-actress Lena
Horne, soprano Leontyne Price, singer Sarah Vaughan, and trumpeter
Dizzy Gillespie.
   Other winners included the Rev. Jesse Jackson for best spoken
word recording for a speech included on Aretha Franklin's ``One
Lord, One Faith, One Baptism'' album. Franklin's album also won best
female soul gospel performance.
   Grammy winners are determined by balloting among members of the
academy, who are recording artists, songwriters, musicians,
producers and technicians.

   At 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighing 275 pounds, Frank
Shirey never fancied himself leading-man material.
   His only formal training remotely related to show business
was clarinet lessons in the fourth grade. Though he did place
second in the Latrobe, Pa., Lions Club talent show for
singing "Just Friends," a song he wrote a few years back, he
always figured he would make his living as a carpenter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now, at 26, he is a star -- in a very minor galaxy.
   People stop him in stores and ask, "Aren't you Sheriff
Jackson?" Why yes, he is. He is the guy who several times a
day, six days a week, gets shot in the rear end, yelps and
then chases down the bad guy in a regular Wild West skit at
Idlewild Park in Ligonier, Pa. Between gunfights, he croons
"Rocky Top" and strums his guitar.
   "I'm hanging around Idlewild, hoping someone will discover
me," says Mr. Shirey, who has been the sheriff at Idlewild's
Hootin' Holler for eight years.
   There are a passel of talented young people, with similar
dreams, all over the country. They spend their summers in
places such as Indiana's Santa Claus Land, belting out songs
on stages no bigger than a baseball dugout, for audiences
that didn't come to see them but to ride the roller coaster.
For performers, it is theatrical experience, a foot in the
door. Many hope to end up on Broadway, in Hollywood, or at
least in Anaheim, Calif. Disneyland is a plum job.
   The competition is fierce. Representatives of amusement
parks, theme parks and the Norwegian Cruise Lines for the
past month or so have been hopping from Muncie, Ind., to
Tulsa, Okla., and even to New York City, auditioning
potential Berenstain Bears and Lusty Lils for the coming
summer. More than 500 hopefuls show up at the typical
audition. Disney tends to draw crew-neck sweaters, ponytails
and more dimples than in a mile of cellulite. Nashville's
Opryland attracts big hair. Cruise ships draw red lips.
   Most who turn out are college students majoring in theater
or dance, who arrive with portfolios of publicity stills
under their arms. Other aspirants are straight out of the
church choir or have appeared locally somewhere in "South
Pacific."
   "For some, an amusement park is the equivalent of hitting
Broadway," says Charles Stephens, chairman of the music
department at St. Clair County Community College, which
played host to auditions in tiny Port Huron, Mich., for Cedar
Point Park in Sandusky, Ohio.
   Being an amusement-park entertainer is like being vice
president; people are more interested in the main attraction
-- like being dropped 200 feet in three seconds and eating
fried dough. Patrons will stop in for a little song and dance
because the theater is air-conditioned or the pool is closed,
or because the line for the Blue Streak is too long.
   "This is not Shakespeare Theater where people sit quietly
and applaud. You need to reach out to them," says Marje
Cronenewett, manager of park attractions for Cedar Point.
Singers at Kennywood Park in Pittsburgh had to outsing the
screams from a black octopus ride named the Monongahela
Monster, which flailed above the outdoor stage. This year the
park decided to drop its "Raz Ma Taz" song show, and replace
it with the Rocket Car: A stunt man rides a little car down a
chute, flips in the air and comes down on a landing pad, or
(occasionally) in the nearby lagoon. Another fellow swallows
swords and fire four times a day. That, too, requires talent.
   But for 22-year-old Kristi Smith, the years of voice
lessons and braces on her teeth were worth it, just for a gig
at Geauga Lake Park in Aurora, Ohio. There, she got to sing
and dance in a grueling 30-minute show, repeated 36 times a
week and requiring six costume changes, made possible by
Velcro. The stuff, she adds, loses zip after 250
performances. Once her dress popped open and she had to back
off stage.
   Ms. Smith's parents had wanted her to play the oboe, but
her woodwind career got sidetracked in the eighth grade, when
she was picked to make a TV appearance with Pearl Bailey. Her
two-minute, three-line debut earned her $2,000. "I thought
`Wow, this is it.' I don't want to be sitting in an orchestra
in 20 years playing an oboe. I want to be on stage." So she
took her two grand to the orthodontist and got her teeth
straightened. "I'm glad I did it. People say I have lovely
teeth," she says. This summer, she is going to Opryland to
sing George M. Cohan songs.
   Opryland, like Disneyland and Walt Disney World, is
considered a great job. They pay twice what some smaller
parks pay -- as much as $500 a week. And the big parks have
the most lavish shows. One of them, Kings Island, in
Cincinnati, has an underwater scene with twinkling
fiber-optic lights and mermaids who dress like Cher. The big
parks, like Disney's, often lip sync voices, so the performer
who moves like a swan but sings like a duck can still be a
star.
   At smaller parks, performers have to sing, dance and mend
costumes. (Mr. Shirey's mother mends his sheriff's uniform.)
"We're small potatoes," says Annie Hughes, whose 70-year-old
husband, Carl, runs Kennywood and Idlewild and books all the
entertainment, including a bird comedy routine called Alphie
Cockatoo and the Comedy MaCaws. There aren't many Las
Vegas-type, multisequined reviews at smaller parks.
   But small parks can be stepping-stones to bigger things.
One Cedar Point performer went to Broadway with "Annie,"
another is touring with Natalie Cole. Debbie Damp, of
Latrobe, Pa., who played Royal Wife No. 7 in "The King and I"
in summer stock and spent three summers at Idlewild, was a
Disney finalist this year.
   Ms. Damp has been dreaming of working for Disney ever
since the third grade, when one of the Seven Dwarfs in the
Crickett Theater's production of Snow White got chicken pox.
Overnight, she was elevated from a lowly tree to Doc. Miss
Jones, her teacher, told the audience little Debbie had saved
the show.
   Smitten, she took tap-dancing and starred in high-school
plays. But her big break was with Idlewild in 1988. She
played Ma McCoy, and got hit in the face with cream pies. Her
parents turned out every Sunday to see the show.
   Now, she hopes, her career is taking off. Aside from being
a Disney finalist who didn't make the final cut, she landed a
TV commercial for Arthur Treacher's Fish &amp; Chips and a radio
commercial for Highway Pizza, in State College, Pa. Next: the
big screen? Ms. Damp may soon be telling Cinema World theater
audiences: "No smoking, no big hats."
   While amusement-park performers may be aiming for the
Great White Way or the Hollywood Walk of Fame, most will
never get much further than singing "Bile Them Cabbage Down"
next to a cotton candy stand. "This will be the pinnacle,"
says Joseph McGoldrick, assistant performing arts director at
Point Park College in Pittsburgh, where amusement parks do
some of their hiring.
   Mr. Shirey, alias Sheriff Jackson, now works winters as a
security guard at Idlewild, and between summer shows has
operated the Rollocoaster and Spider rides. But he lives for
the stage.
   Last summer, Mr. Shirey decided that, after eight years,
he needed to jazz up his routine. He stood in the wings until
the other performers were on stage, ran out, jumped in the
air and touched his toes, like a member of the Bolshoi.
Dazzled by his agility, the audience gave him a standing
ovation, which a friend of his captured on videotape.
   "It was my moment in the spotlight," he says.

   Esther Smith, the girl who sings about ``The Boy
Next Door'' in ``Meet Me in St. Louis,'' was one of the most
sought-after roles of the new Broadway season. And one of the most
difficult to cast.
   ``Impossible to cast,'' insists Jay Binder, a top Broadway
casting agent and the man who helped put the performers on stage in
``Rumors'' and ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,'' two of last season's
biggest hits.
   ``You have to find someone to play a role that was created
expressly for Judy Garland,'' says Binder, referring to the
legendary singer who was Esther in the memorable 1945 film version.
   ``What you have to do is not even try,'' he says. ``You have to
find someone who can play Esther and not Judy Garland.''
   Louis Burke, producer and director of the lavish musical, goes a
step further.
   ``I was looking for somebody who had her own personality that
would make us forget Garland,'' he says.
   During a 15-month, cross-country expedition, Burke and Binder
saw some 2,500 actresses. They had to listen to what seemed like
never-ending renditions of ``The Boy Next Door,'' ``Have Yourself a
Merry Little Christmas'' and ``The Trolley Song,'' the show's
best-known numbers.
   ``Today, if I hear `The Trolley Song,' I recoil in horror,''
Binder sighs.
   Among the first performers to audition back in June 1988 was a
former Junior Miss runner-up named Donna Kane, best known to New
York audiences as pert, tap-dancing little Ruby in the 1985 revival
of ``Dames at Sea.'' She didn't know it then, but she was Burke's
first choice for the role.
   ``The very first day I saw her, I knew there was a magic there
that was pretty extraordinary,'' Burke says now. ``That was my gut
reaction.
   ``And Donna actually was quite clever. She wore a very lovely
white lace dress with a blue sash around her waist that seemed to
fit the character. It impresses me when people prepare themselves
for auditions.''
   But Burke and Binder felt they had to continue the search,
looking at everyone who wanted to audition. So Kane didn't meet
again with Burke until February, when she auditioned twice more
with a series of different actors being considered for other roles
in the musical.
   ``You do everything over again,'' Kane says now. ``I sang the
same songs. I worked on a few more scenes. I was matched up with
different boys next door, sisters, mothers and fathers.''
   When it finally looked as if the show would arrive late last
season, financial problems forced its postponement until this fall.
   Kane went off to do ``Show Boat'' with the Minnesota Opera and a
successful concert of Rodgers and Hart's ``Babes in Arms'' at
Lincoln Center. When she returned to ``Meet Me in St. Louis,''
there was a fourth audition at the Neil Simon Theater and then a
final audition with Jason Workman, the actor chosen to play John
Truitt, the boy next door.
   ``Sometimes I thought it was really going to happen,'' she
recalls. ``And other times, I would say, `No, you can't count on
things until it is definite.'''
   It became definite only in late summer. Burke picked her to
appear in the musical with George Hearn and Charlotte Moore, who
play her parents, Milo O'Shea, who is her grandfather, and Betty
Garrett, who plays the Irish cook Katie.
   The stage version of ``Meet Me in St. Louis,'' on view at
Broadway's Gershwin Theater, has been trumpeted as a family show,
an old-fashioned American musical, something Broadway hasn't had
for a while. Its songwriters, Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane, have
expanded on their original movie score, adding 10 new songs.
   ``They definitely don't write music like this any more,'' Kane
says. ``The songs have melodies that are not only catchy and
memorable but emotional, too.
   ``There's a whole new bridge section to `The Boy Next Door'
which will be a surprise to people,'' she says. ``And there's a new
duet that Esther and the boy next door sing called `You Are for
Loving.' It's a beautiful melody, with a wonderful counterpoint.''
   ``Meet Me in St. Louis'' is Kane's first chance to originate a
role on Broadway. She had come to New York in 1984 after graduating
from Mount Holyoke as a political science major, but she had two
summers of stock in Vermont while in college.
   ``It's helped me in the theater to have a liberal arts
education,'' she says. ``As an actor, you have to analyze the text
critically. Besides, you can't just focus on the performing arts.''
   Her first job in New York was in a small musical called
``Madison Avenue,'' for which she answered an ad in the trade
papers. The job called for a Seven Sisters graduate and she fit the
bill.
   Next came ``Dames at Sea,'' which kept her occupied for nearly a
year. After that, there were productions of shows like ``My One and
Only'' in suburban New York and New Jersey.
   Kane wasn't idle while she waited for word from Burke and
Binder. She performed in a show in Boston, went on tour with
``Grease'' and moved to England for four months with her husband,
Mark Staples, an oil trader.
   Born in Beacon, N.Y., she was raised on Long Island and New
Jersey. Her parents were in education, not show business.
   ``My grandfather was a singer on the radio in the 1930s and
'40s,'' she says. ``I have his legacy, a piano, which is one of my
most cherished possessions.''
   The best advice Kane ever got from a voice teacher was when she
was 8 years old. The teacher told her mother, ``She's not doing
anything wrong. Leave her alone.''
   ``I was fortunate that I never had a style or technique imposed
on me,'' she says now.
   She doesn't worry about the comparisons to Judy Garland.
   ``I have not watched the movie on purpose during the rehearsal
process,'' she says. ``Growing up, I'd seen it many times, of
course. Some people in the cast have watched the film, others
haven't. But we're not trying to compare ourselves to it.
   ``I'm just trying to concentrate on the character of Esther, not
who played it. She's a very honest and very sincere person and to
be able to produce that vocally as well as act it out is just
great.''

YOU'VE HEARD 'BLUES IN NIGHT' BEFORE
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
What could sound more inviting to a blues fan than an entire evening of blues
songs from the '20s and '30s? With such composers as Bessie Smith, Ann Ronell
and Jimmy Cox and such performers as Freda Payne and Obba Babatunde, how could
it go wrong?
</P>
<P>
"Blues in the Night," which opened Wednesday at the Los Angeles Theatre Center,
does not exactly go wrong. It just does not really go right. The problem lies
not with its performers (which also include Leilani Jones and Joanne Jackson)
but with what they're made to do -- or not -- by director Sheldon Epps.
</P>
<P>
Epps, who conceived the show eight years ago and has produced it off and on
Broadway, in London and on tour, has taken the straightest, shortest road from
point A to point B. It's a road paved with cliches. "Blues" is not a book
musical, but there is a standard-issue situation and some recycled linkage
about memories and having seen better days.
</P>
<P>
You've heard it all before.
</P>
<P>
The characters, too, are stereotypical, nameless people down on their luck.
What they share is the loneliness of the cheap hotel they inhabit. They are a
still-dashing Saloon Singer (Babatunde), an upbeat Big Mama known as the Lady
From the Road (Jackson), a mysterious Woman of the World (Payne) and a young if
not-so-fresh Girl With a Date (Jones).
</P>
<P>
No question that what you're promised is what you get: Plenty of blues, which
means plenty of gorgeous Bessie Smith, but also Johnny Mercer, Andy Razaf,
Alberta Hunter, Vernon Duke and Duke Ellington. Among many others.
</P>
<P>
If this were a straight cabaret act, the music and the singing would suffice.
Both are strong, and Sy Johnson's orchestrations, Perry Hart's musical
direction and the superior group of five musicians headed by Rahn Coleman
provide a solid backbone. It's when Epps tries to string it all together and
make each segment connect that he gets into trouble.
</P>
<P>
Have we ever known a Big Mama who was not full of bounce and optimism? Jackson
does the best she can with the trite patter she's given about remembering,
leafing through the old scrapbook and pulling something out of the trunk that
she can wear, attach a song to and cheer herself by.
</P>
<P>
Payne's Woman of the World has no such doggerel to contend with. Only exposed
nerves. Hers is the tortured silence (except when she sings) of the jilted
woman. As for Jones, her Girl With a Date hovers between eager innocence and
lonely disappointment.
</P>
<P>
Babatunde's Saloon Singer is the least encumbered of the characters, a handsome
devil who knows his powers of seduction and believes in the brightness just
around the corner. Not only is the singer a stylish dancer for whom Patricia
Wilcox has devised some happy-go-lucky choreography, but he has some of the
sharpest numbers in the show.
</P>
<P>
While Epps does mix it up, allowing the singer/dancers to team up or intercut
one song with another, there is too much symmetry to the show. Most of the
numbers are given equal weight and presented unimaginatively in a sequential
manner, separated by Douglas D. Smith's dark lighting scheme or that
unenlightening patter mentioned earlier.
</P>
<P>
Smith also did the evocative hotel set that provides rich context with Marianna
Elliott's sexy or satiny costumes in an array of moody colors: mauve to brown
to fuschia and soft pink and yellow. But the effect can misfire. In "Take Me
for a Buggy Ride," Jackson is decked out like a bumble bee in a yellow and
black stripe, with bustle and pink bows, that steals all the thunder. Her song
seems hollow under the lavish decor.
</P>
<P>
When the songs make a clean breast of the situational garnish, they're much
tastier, as with the haunting "Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out," sung
by all three women. But it doesn't happen enough. Has its age caught up with
it? Perhaps Epps needs to do revamp his format to catch up to some of the
classiness of more recent revues -- including "The Joni Mitchell Project."

   Film star Bruce Willis caused young
hearts to throb when he turned up unannounced at a ski area while
the set for ``Die Hard II'' was being arranged.
   ``Oh yeah, he created quite a stir,'' said Gordon West, a
manager at the Mission Ridge ski area. ``He had every lady going
`ooh ah ooh.' He came in incognito and rented his skis under some
other name.''
   Jason Stromme, a 17-year-old high school student, said he
noticed Willis eating lunch Sunday with four people at the central
Washington ski lodge.
   ``He got up and left because everyone was looking at him,''
Stromme said, and then youngsters pounced on his table, grabbing
the water glass and other items the star had touched.
   Scenes from the thriller ``Die Hard II'' were being filmed this
week in Leavenworth, said Chamber of Commerce director Laura Jobin.

   Guitar virtuoso Eric Clapton is planning a
six-week U.S. tour that will bring the British rocker to 27 cities
in the spring.
   It will be Clapton's first U.S. tour since 1987, although he
appeared with the Rolling Stones several times during their
just-completed ``Steel Wheels'' tour.
   Clapton's smashing groups of the 1960s and early '70s included
Cream, Blind Faith and Derek and the Dominoes. Unlike other
megastars on the road in the past year, his tour will not have a
corporate sponsor, publicist Mitch Zamarin said Tuesday.
   The tour opens in Atlanta on March 28, then heads up the Eastern
Seaboard before moving west and ending May 5 in San Francisco.
   Clapton's band features guitarist Phil Palmer, keyboardists Greg
Phillanganes and Alan Clark, bassist Nathan East, percussionist Ray
Cooper, drummer Steve Ferrone and backing vocalists Tessa Niles and
Katie Kissoon.

   Prince Charles appealed to architects and planners
to minimize their use of tropical hardwoods, whose harvest is one
cause of rampant deforestation.
   ``The sands of time in the tropical hour glass are running out
fast and we can't turn it upside down and watch the sands run out
again,'' Charles said Tuesday in a speech to the Royal Botanical
Gardens.
   Despite agreements to import only timber grown in sustainably
managed forests, it is impossible to know whether given shipments
come from properly managed forests or not, he said.
   Charles criticized the International Tropical Timber
Organization for making no mention of the rights and needs of the
forest-dwellers in its articles of agreement, and said new
mechanisms are needed to protect rainforest regions.
   ``This is clearly a massive challenge, but it seems to be that
we cannot simply go on talking about the need to protect the
world's rain forests and not create the kind of institutions and
mechanisms which will actually make that possible,'' Charles said.

   Ticky-tacky _ that's how actress Kirstie Alley
of ``Cheers'' fame first saw the city of angels.
   ``I was very amazed at how most houses in Los Angeles looked
alike,'' Alley told Good Housekeeping for its March issue. ``After
a while I thought that if I saw one more white-on-white-on-white
room I would gag. The furniture's too big, also.''
   When she headed for Los Angeles in 1981 to become an actress,
the Kansas-born Alley said, she left behind a job as an interior
decorator and a $400-a-week cocaine habit.
   ``I had spent a fortune decorating peoples' homes and I didn't
even know what I was doing,'' she said.
   With roles in ``Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan'' and the
miniseries ``North &amp; South'' under her belt, she is happily settled
into life with husband Parker Stevenson and their myriad pets and
guests, in a 22-room mansion on the former Al Jolson estate.
   ``She's a biker's chick,'' ``Cheers'' co-star Ted Danson said.
   ``If you want to have a verbal flirtation, Kirstie's your
girl,'' Danson said.
   ``He's a very good kisser,'' Alley responded.

 -- N. Scott Momaday, "House Made of Dawn"
</P>
<P>
Sometime last April, the spirits left the body of William Smith along Highway
33, about 25 miles north of Ojai. Smitty was a Shoshone Indian from Fort Hall,
Ida., and his body is buried there. But the spirits he collected during his
lifetime should also be put to rest, as is customary, one year after his death.
</P>
<P>
Born in California on April 18, 1955, to a relocated Shoshone woman from Idaho
and an absent white father, Smitty died homeless, caught like a shadow between
two worlds, Indian and white. Most Americans know and accept Indians only if
they are feather-bedecked caricatures: "redskins" and "braves" who bear
Hollywood names like Tonto and Iron Eyes and do fine as targets for John
Wayne's hundred-round six-shooter. American guilt can, to a certain extent, be
assuaged of the theft of native land and resources by painting Indians as
aboriginal oddities in the realm of natural history rather than human history.
William Smith was none of these. He was a son, a father, a brother, a friend,
and an Indian homeless in his own land.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, Smitty's mother found her way back to the reservation and
he grew up along the banks of the Snake River. Like most Indian reservations,
Fort Hall is an island of absolute poverty in the midst of awesome beauty. Like
most boys, Smitty was interested in baseball and fishing, and like most
Indians, he dropped out of school and learned a trade.
</P>
<P>
In past times, the native people marked the transition from child to adult with
a solitary stint in the womb of the earth mother. There they would seek out the
sacred names for predatory animals born into each human soul and shape the
animal spirit's energy into the cycles of all life. Nowadays, when the animals
awaken, there are no prayers. There is alcohol, and while it dulls the roar, it
also sharpens the claws and teeth until a beast is born that can rip the soul
to shreds. And so it was with Smitty.
</P>
<P>
Crime on an Indian reservation is a federal offense, and when the drunken spree
was over, Smitty was sent to a cell in Lompoc, less than a hundred miles from
his place of birth. Smitty was a short-timer, and was soon back on the streets.
He struggled with the beast, praying hard to hear its name, and for a time his
artwork and Indian singing kept the claws at bay. I remember his clear sweet
voice beside me in the sweat lodge, a place that Smitty sought out time and
again. There used to be lots of sweats around Southern California and Smitty
went to many. But the twin threats of pseudo-shamans and their new-age
supporters drove the sweats underground. And instead of the warm caress of
steam to still the beast he carried, Smitty poured poison down his throat.
</P>
<P>
In and out of jail a hundred times or more, and no one in the system could find
the name to call the beast growing inside Smitty. What had been an animal of
altruistic potential was now a monster who could only be tamed by ancient songs
and ceremonies. But many of the healing songs have died with the old ones,
stuck to their tongues, frozen there by the pilgrims who are only now wanting
to hear them, and steal them, like they did the land.
</P>
<P>
When Smitty's body could no longer absorb the alcohol, he tricked the monster
to sleep with a heroin assault. But the beast was tired, and angry, and hungry
for the songs that Smitty could no longer sing, for the fire that kept the
beast at bay also burned Smitty's throat until his voice cracked like dry
leaves underfoot. Since the songs the beast craved are born of the wind in the
language of the birds and four-leggeds, it was in their land, high up a
twisting canyon road, that the beast left the body of William Smith. No one was
there to see it, but Indians in the Americas know too well what happened; this
horror is familiar to us all.
</P>
<P>
The last time we saw Smitty, the beast was searching for a place for him to
die. And finally that happened, under some chaparral. Smitty's clothes were
strung out along the hill where the beast tore away the only things left that
looked human about the body of William Smith. In the last moments of struggle,
Smitty could not have sung his death song, for by then the chords were burned
like sticks to rattle in his throat.
</P>
<P>
There are other beasts, thousands of them, loose in the bodies of Indians who
can be healed only with ceremonies that can no longer be learned. For the wind
creates no songs against square stones and metal. And the lyrics of the birds
and four-leggeds are closed out with walls, or caged away. But I know that
there are still some songs being tended like small warm fires, here and there,
in sweat lodges. May one of them at this time be sung for the spirits of
William Smith.

HOW TO HAVE YOURSELF A MERRIAM-WEBSTER'S LITTLE CHRISTMAS
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
THE LANGUAGE of Christmas has hardly changed since Chaucer's time. That's
because the essence of this holiday is tradition and change is resisted. We
have carols and wassail and Christmas trees and the exchange of gifts, and
nobody wants it any other way.
</P>
<P>
Now and then we see a pink Christmas tree, and it is probably plastic, but such
trifling innovations don't change the spirit of the celebration.
</P>
<P>
According to Merriam-Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, the words
Christmas, yule, wreath, mistletoe, holiday, holly and angels date from before
the 12th Century. Carol, Xmas and wassail are also many centuries old.
</P>
<P>
The word Christmas itself comes from the Old English word Christes maesse,
which literally means Christ's Mass, and it is celebrated throughout the
Christian world on Dec. 25.
</P>
<P>
During the first few centuries of the church, however, it was celebrated on
various days in January, April, May, September and October, because the early
theologians disagreed on Christ's birth date. Finally, in AD 340, the Pope
settled on Dec. 25.
</P>
<P>
Webster's sets to rest a common misconception about the word Xmas, which is
often thought of as a sort of sacrilegious, modern, shortcut slang word for
Christmas. Not so.
</P>
<P>
The word Xmas has perfectly good credentials. The X in Xmas is a symbol for
Christ from the Greek letter chi, the first letter of Christos. A chi looks
much like our X, and the word Xmas has been in use since 1551.
</P>
<P>
Even so, it still looks like slang to me.
</P>
<P>
Yule, another word that means Christmas, also dates from before the 12th
Century and is related to the Old Norse word jol, which originally meant a
pagan winter feast. Yuletide first appeared in English during the 15th Century.
</P>
<P>
To "troll the ancient yuletide carols" is a tradition that dates to the singing
of the "heavenly host" of angels on the first Christmas day: "Glory to God in
the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men."
</P>
<P>
Carol comes from the late Latin choraula, meaning choral song; it dates in
English from the 14th Century. Troll means to sing, and comes from the 15th
Century.
</P>
<P>
To go a-wassailing is to sing carols from house to house. Originally wassail
was an Old Norse toast -- ves heill, meaning "be well." From that term came the
name of the cheerful holiday concoction made of wine, beer, cider, spices and
sugar.
</P>
<P>
Few words have been added to the Christmas lexicon in recent centuries, but
Scrooge -- a name we get from the born-again miser of Charles Dickens' beloved
story, "A Christmas Carol" -- is an exception.
</P>
<P>
Even more recently, the word grinch has become popular. A grinch is
anill-tempered cynic invented by Dr. Seuss in his children's book, "The Grinch
Who Stole Christmas."
</P>
<P>
Decking the halls with leaves of holly originated among the ancient converted
Danes. They believed that holly was used for the crown of thorns at the
Crucifixion, and that the red berries represented drops of blood.
</P>
<P>
The use of mistletoe goes back to the pagan Druids. It is a parasite that grows
on apple and oak trees. Druid priests made a solemn rite of collecting it from
oak trees. People paid them for pieces of the plant, believing that it kept
witches away.
</P>
<P>
The present notion that strangers may kiss under its aura is much more benign.
(If the Druids were right, one is not in danger of kissing a witch.)
</P>
<P>
As for Santa Claus, that name is a corruption (through the Dutch Sinter Claes)
of Saint Nicholas, a 4th-Century bishop of Myra, in ancient Lycia (Turkey), who
was much beloved of children and sailors for his alleged miracles in their
behalf.
</P>
<P>
How this hazy figure became the jolly fat man who drives reindeer through the
sky, squeezes down chimneys and leaves toys for children in millions of homes
at Christmas is beyond my learning.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, I don't believe in him, and I don't think parents should con their
children into believing in him, either.
</P>
<P>
Children with normal intelligence will soon figure out that the old fellow is a
fraud, and they will never trust their parents again.
</P>
<P>
This breach of faith at an age when children are entirely dependent on the
parents for their perception of truth and reality can never be mended.
</P>

Mele Kalikimaka from your grinch.

<HEAD>Golden-Haired Women Awaken Nobel Laureates On Lucia Day</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Some Nobel Prize winners will wake up
Thursday in their hotel rooms surrounded by golden-haired young
women with candles on their heads, singing carols.
   It's Lucia Day, when Swedes brighten up the darkest period of
the year with celebrations embracing a Roman Catholic martyr and a
pre-Christian light festival.
   Before the Gregorian calendar was adopted, the feast of St.
Lucia was on the shortest day of the year. It commemorated a virgin
who was martyred in Syracuse, Sicily in 304 A.D.
   Pagan Swedes had their own mid-winter celebrations of light on
the year's shortest day. After Sweden was Christianized, the Roman
Catholic saint portrayed with lights in her golden hair became a
natural favorite.
   Nowadays Lucia processions occur throughout Sweden in offices,
on the streets and in schools. Singing young women with
electric-candle crowns lead the parade. People dressed as gnomes
hand out ginger snaps. Little ``star boys'' march along with
cone-shaped caps and star-topped wands.
   The festival falls three days after the Nobel Prize awards
ceremony. Many of the scientists, authors and statesmen are still
on hand, giving lectures and participate in seminars.
   Gun Lannergren, who has directed the processions at the Grand
Hotel for 15 years, said the laureates always are told in advance
about the 7 a.m. Lucia Day wakeup calls. With the laureates'
agreement, young music students are given keys to enter their rooms
and awaken them with song.
   ``The girls go from room to room and sometimes the laureates
join the procession in their pajamas to hear the girls sing once
again,'' said Lannergren.
   Traditionally, only Nobel Prize winners have enjoyed the private
spectacle. Other hotel clients can enjoy the singing later in the
morning when 20-25 young women perform a brief concert in a
separate room at the hotel.
   Swedish children sing for their parents on Lucia morning before
going to school to participate in choir performances. Young women
go about with strands of tinsel in their hair. Cookies, saffron
bread and mulled wine are consumed at impromptu parties.
   The popular Neapolitan song, ``Santa Lucia'' is always sung.
It's about the oldest part of Italy's Naples, the Santa Lucia
quarter which was named after the saint.
   Lucia is considered the patron saint of Syracuse and the
patroness of eyes. She is frequently shown with two eyes in a dish,
a possible reference to her martyrdom. The name Lucia comes from
the Latin word for light.
   The first accounts of Lucia celebrations in Sweden date to the
17th century.
   In the old medieval calendar the ``Lussi'' night between Dec.
12-13 was the longest night of the year and associated with
mysterious happenings. Country folk believed all children should be
christened before Lucia or the devil could take them from their
parents.

The Who Is 'What?'
And Raffi Is the King

Pre-Schoolers Flock to Shows
Of Top Recording Artist
And Go Slightly Quackers

<TEXT>
   An hour before showtime at the Portland Civic Auditorium, Fred Trueax, assistant events director, is briefing his staff on crowd control.

   Try to keep excited fans from leaving their seats, Mr. Trueax instructs the 20 ushers gathered in the auditorium foyer.
"Believe it or not, these kids rush the stage," he warns.

   Soon, the fans stream into the 3,000-seat hall.
Some are clutching stuffed animals or sucking on pacifiers.
Others are crying.
All are very excited.

   These fans and their parents or teachers are here to see their idol, Raffi Cavoukian, known simply as Raffi.
Since he abandoned a struggling folk-singing career in Toronto a dozen years ago, Raffi has become North America's most popular children's entertainer.

   Long a superstar at Canadian day-care centers and nursery schools, Raffi is also attracting a big following in the U.S., where he has become the best-selling children's recording artist.

   "The kids' music industry in this country was almost dead, and he revived it," says Sherman Smith, the owner of the Ugly Duckling, a children's book and record store in Eugene, Ore.
"He's the foundation for the children's music industry in the U.S., and he's Canadian."

   Jimmy's mother found that out.
"I couldn't believe it when Jimmy wanted to come here" to the Portland concert, says Liz Russell.
"Here he is, a five-year-old groupie."
Jimmy wasn't alone.
"It was like trying to get tickets for The Who or the Rolling Stones," says Ms. Russell.

   "We had a three-hour lineup when the tickets went on sale the first day," says Carolyn Kelly, co-owner of a Portland children's bookstore that is promoting the concert here.
After selling out, the promoters added a second performance.
Jeffrey Creswell, a Portland teacher who plays Raffi tapes in his classroom, has come here with a group of 75, including almost all the pupils in his third-grade class and their families.
"He brings back to kids something we've robbed them of," says Mr. Creswell.
"In school, nobody sings to kids anymore."

   But this crowd certainly doesn't hesitate to sing.
From the time Raffi gets onto the stage with an enthusiastic "Hello, boys and girls" to the time he steps off a little over an hour later, the audience joins in with virtually every number.

   Dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and matching peaked cap, Raffi treats his fans to a mix of traditional children's songs, nonsense melodies and original ballads.

   "Are there any ducks in the crowd today?" he asks, and a chorus of quacks responds.
The audience enthusiastically provides lots more quacks to accompany Raffi as he sings "Five Little Ducks."
Ducks already figure in two other Raffi tunes.
Glenn Sernyk, Raffi's manager, says that Raffi's new album, due out this fall, will include yet another.
"We'll have a little more variety in the duck repertoire," he says.

   The nonsense songs are equally popular.
"I love to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas" turns into, "I love to eat, eat, eat, ee-pples and ba-nee-nees" and "I love to oot, oot, oot oo-pples and ba-noo-noos."

   Other songs require members of the audience to dance at their seats or "Shake My Sillies Out."
Raffi intertwines these fast-paced songs with slower ballads, including his best-known "Baby Beluga," a song about a whale.

   Gwynne Scholz, who runs Trespassers William, a children's bookstore in Albuquerque, N.M., says the mellow moments of Raffi's music make it superior to massmarketed "kiddies' music" that "winds up kids tighter than a drum."
That makes Raffi popular with parents, since the music is often played in the family car.
"Hell is being trapped for 600 miles with a {frenetic} licensed-character tape," Ms. Scholz says.

   Ms. Scholz and others link Raffi's success to a huge growth in the children's music industry.
"He definitely is the base line for kids' music," says Ms. Scholz.
"Nobody approaches him."

   "The stigma has been that if you can't perform for adults, you perform for kids, but this has changed in the past few years," says Gary Shontz of RosenShontz, a Vermont-based singing duo that caters to older children.
Mr. Shontz attributes most of the change to the success of Raffi and other Canadian children's performers.
"It all happened in Canada and has been spreading through the U.S.," he says.

   Born in Egypt 38 years ago to Armenian parents, Raffi emigrated with his family to Canada as a child.
In the late 1960s, he began performing as a singer-songwriter in Toronto coffeehouses.
"My folk-singing career was always a bit of a struggle," he says over a breakfast of chamomile tea prior to his two concerts here, part of a swing through the Pacific Northwest and western Canada.

   "Raffi was like John Denver part two," says Peter Goddard, the music critic for the Toronto Star.
"He came across as ultra-clean.
The times were wrong for him as an adult singer but right for him as a children's singer."

   In 1974, Raffi's mother-in-law suggested that he visit the nursery school where she taught.
He says, "My wife taught me three or four songs, including 'Baa Baa Black Sheep' and 'Eensy-Weensy Spider.'
I sat on a rug on the floor with a dozen kids and two or three teachers.
We had fun."

   Soon Raffi was performing in schools all over Toronto.
With $4,000, he recorded the album "Singable Songs for the Very Young."
"We thought it might do real well and sell 10,000 or 15,000 copies," says Ken Whiteley, who produced the album and plays with the Rise and Shine Band, which accompanies Raffi.

   So far, 320,000 copies have been sold in Canada, and although it is over 10 years old, it remains the top-selling of Raffi's seven albums in the U.S.
His eighth, "Everything Grows," is due out in August.

   Theoretically, there is a new audience every three years, says Raffi.
That hasn't been lost on A&amp;M Records, which distributes the records in the U.S. and Canada.
"It's turned out to be incredibly profitable for A&amp;M," says Mark Jaffe, the company's director of children's marketing.
He expects Raffi to sell over a million records and tapes in the U.S. this year.

   The appeal is definitely upscale.
In Canada, "It's just part of a yuppie's lifestyle to take the kids to a Raffi concert once a year," says Robert Bennett, a Toronto concert promoter who works closely with Raffi.

   The tradition is moving south.
The mother of a two-year-old who attended a recent concert in Santa Monica, Calif., says, "There were more Volvo station wagons in that parking lot than I ever saw before."

   All this is a bit of a surprise to the record industry, which figured that parents would never spend more than $5 on a children's record.
Raffi's records sell for up to $10 each, and one album recently came out on a compact disk.
"Within four days, we completely exhausted our supply," says A&amp;M's Mr. Jaffe.

   Although Raffi appeals primarily to pre-schoolers, children as old as 12 or 13 are at the concert here.
The older fans tend to be concentrated in smaller cities, says Mr. Sernyk, Raffi's manager.
"In the large metropolitan areas in the U.S., the cutoff age is six years old.
At seven, they're into Madonna."

   Despite his success, Raffi still refuses to become overly commercial.
Although he has produced one concert video, he has rejected offers to have his own TV show.

   "It doesn't please me to hear that kids watch my video endlessly," he says.
"Television isn't a friend of children.
Children need to play.
They need to interact with other people.
That's how they best find out about the world around them."

   Because of these beliefs, Raffi meets his fans after every performance, and this afternoon several hundred line up in the foyer, like children in a shopping mall waiting for Santa Claus.

   Seated with his legs crossed on a padded bench, Raffi signs autographs with a small heart beside his name and answers questions from the less bashful.
Some hug and kiss him or stroke his black beard.
"I have all your records and tapes," says five-year-old Curtis Wackerle.
"Well, really, I only have two.
I don't think anybody has all of them."

   The pace is exhausting, particularly when Raffi has two concerts in a day.
He usually is accompanied by his wife, Debi, who has given up schoolteaching to act as a "full-time consultant."

   Despite plans to perform in up to 80 U.S. cities starting this fall, Raffi expects to continue meeting his fans after every show.
"It's a wonderful opportunity for my audience to find out I'm a real person."

   Some aren't so sure.
Inevitably, one child asks, "How did you get off the tape?"
Another is more spiritual.
"Were you there when I was born?"

   Still others haven't quite mastered the etiquette of being a fan.
At a concert in Eugene, one little girl gets scolded by her mother soon after Raffi autographs her ticket stub.
"After you get an autograph," she says, "don't suck on it."

TRACY CHAPMAN SCORES BUT MISSES A GRAMMY RECORD
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tracy Chapman was derailed Wednesday in her bid to become the most honored
debut artist in the 31-year history of the record industry's Grammy Awards.
</P>
<P>
The singer-songwriter, whose folk-flavored tales about society's underclass
scored critical and commercial triumphs in 1988, won Grammys for best new
artist, contemporary folk recording and female pop vocal.
</P>
<P>
But Chapman lost to Bobby McFerrin's "Don't Worry, Be Happy" in the best song
category, eliminating any chance that she could break the record of five
Grammys set in 1980 by Christopher Cross' debut album.
</P>
<P>
The folk award was among 61 announced during a pre-telecast ceremony at the
Shrine Auditorium, site of the nationally televised event sponsored by the
6,000-member National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Other artists who picked up multiple awards during the pre-telecast affair were
Anita Baker, best female rhythm and blues vocal and best rhythm and blues song;
the Irish rock band U2, saluted for rock group vocal and music performance
video; Robin Williams, children's recording and comedy recording; Robert Shaw
and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, classical album, orchestral recording and
choral recording, and Sir Georg Solti, opera recording and chamber music.
</P>
<P>
Coupled with his best song victory, McFerrin's award Wednesday for best male
pop vocal was his seventh Grammy citation since 1985.
</P>
<P>
The country mother-and-daughter team The Judds were honored for best country
vocal by a duo or group for their recording of "Give a Little Love." It was
their fourth victory in that category in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
The late Roy Orbison won his second career Grammy, cited for his country vocal
collaboration with k.d. Lang on a remake of his own '60s hit, "Crying."
</P>
<P>
After accepting the award for her husband, who died of a heart attack on Dec.
6, Barbara Orbison said backstage, "Roy was so fortunate to have felt the love
of the fans and the whole world before he passed on."

On a lighter note, veteran blues man Willie Dixon, whose win in the best
traditional blues recording category was his first Grammy ever, quipped to the
press backstage, "Better late than never. I give in and I give out, but I don't
give up."
</P>
<P>
As the pre-telecast awards were announced inside the auditorium, about 350 fans
waited outside the Shrine, hoping to catch glimpses of the recording stars as
they entered the building. Unlike the Oscars, where film personalities make a
big splash by entering the building through the front door, most of the
performers and big-name guests at the Grammys enter the building through a
backstage area that is blocked off to fans.
</P>
<P>
Once the telecast began inside the hall, Chapman's quest to break Cross' 1980
record provided the most drama. (The record for most Grammys in a single
evening was eight, a mark achieved in 1984 by Michael Jackson.)
</P>
<P>
Chapman's pop female vocal award was the first award announced on the program,
and the singer accepted the Grammy with the same shy, retiring manner that
characterizes her concert appearances. She later returned to the stage to be
acknowledged as the best new artist.
</P>
<P>
Until her Elektra album was released last spring, Cleveland-born Chapman, now
24, was little known outside the club circuit in Boston, where she was living
while attending Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
Because the stark realism in her themes -- many of which deal with such
subjects as welfare mothers and children victimized by racism -- is so far from
the upbeat, dance-minded music that has dominated Top 40 radio station play
lists in recent years, Chapman's album was considered a commercial long shot
when it was released.
</P>
<P>
But the reaction was dramatic: glowing reviews and album sales of more than 2
million. Chapman climaxed her remarkable year by co-starring with Bruce
Springsteen and Sting on Amnesty International's worldwide "Human Rights Now!"
tour last fall.
</P>
<P>
Her most popular song, "Fast Car," was a look at a woman's struggle to break
free of emotional and economic bonds.
</P>
<P>
The single was up Wednesday for best record. Chapman was also nominated for
best album, song and new artist.
</P>
<P>
Though the music academy has made great strides in recent years in reducing
criticism for being out of touch with "cutting edge" elements in pop music,
there was one embarrassment Wednesday when three nominees in the newly
established rap category said they were boycotting the show because the rap
award was not included among the 15 awards announced during the telecast.
</P>
<P>
Will Smith, the Fresh Prince of rap duo D. J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh
Prince, said at an afternoon press conference in West Hollywood: "We're not
anti-Grammy. Our problem is with the 1989 Grammy Awards show. It's like you go
to school for 12 years and they give you a diploma, but you aren't allowed to
walk down the aisle.
</P>
<P>
"It's not like we got F's through school; we got straight A's," he said,
referring to the group's artistic and sales credentials. The duo's latest
album, "He's the D. J., I'm the Rapper," has sold more than 2 million copies.
Also not attending the ceremony: rap nominees Salt-N-Pepa and L. L. Cool J.
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, D. J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince won the rap award.
</P>
<P>
First time winners in jazz included Take 6 (group vocal), Betty Carter (female
vocal), Michael Brecker (solo instrumental). Others winning Grammys for the
first time included Carlos Santana (rock instrumental), Bill Monroe
(bluegrass), Shadowfax (new age recording), Roberto Carlos (Latin pop
performance), Ziggy Marley &amp; the Melody Makers (reggae).
</P>
<P>
Repeat winners: Robert Palmer, named best rock vocalist for the second time;
Amy Grant, female gospel performance, her fifth award; Larnelle Harris, male
gospel performance, fifth award; David Sanborn, pop instrumental, fifth award;
Robert Cray Band, contemporary blues recording, third award.
</P>
<P>
"Into the Woods" was judged best musical cast show album, while Mike Post's
"The Theme From L.A. Law" was named best instrumental composition. "The Last
Emperor" was voted best album of original musical score written for a motion
picture or television. Phil Collins' "Two Hearts" was named best song written
for a motion picture or television.
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Jesse Jackson won a Grammy in the spoken-documentary field for a
speech that was included in Aretha Franklin's "One Lord, One Faith, One
Baptism" album.

   NEW YORK -- With an hour to go before a scheduled
promotional bash at a big Manhattan record store, Michael W.
Smith, Geffen Records' newest hot property, is doing just
what you'd expect of a pop star: drinking, swallowing pills
and gossiping about the personal lives of rivals.
   But his drink is Diet Coke, his pills are Vitamin C and
odorless garlic, and the gossip is unusual:
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I hear U-2 is Christian," a Geffen publicist says.
   "Three of them are," Mr. Smith replies. "I hear the bass
player isn't."
   Mr. Smith isn't the first clean-living Christian rock star
to come along, but he is the first to be signed by Geffen
Records -- the same power-house that handles Guns N' Roses
and Cher, among other secular acts. He is, in fact, at the
vanguard of a trend: Gospel singers, suddenly popular, are
making videos, appearing on late-night television and being
signed and promoted by the same big record companies that
saturate the airwaves with satanic speed metal and mysogynist
rap.
   It is a crossover movement as tricky as it is potentially
lucrative. It gives Mr. Smith and a handful of other
Christian stars, who heretofore sold their records from the
backs of vans at prayer meetings, a shot at money and
celebrity that earlier gospel performers never could have
dreamed of. But it gives them the awkward job of staking out
a middle ground between sacred and profane.
   So, when he is asked on "Live with Regis and Kathie Lee"
whether he is a pop or gospel performer, the blue-eyed,
33-year-old Mr. Smith squirms a little. "My faith is the most
important thing in my life. I just want to be a positive role
model," he says.
   Growth in the gospel-music business has been nothing short
of spectacular for the past decade. While the overall music
industry's revenue doubled between 1980 and 1990, the gospel
sector's nearly tripled, to around $500 million from $180
million.
   The rising popularity of gospel music was confirmed
recently when Billboard magazine, the all-important arbiter
of the music industry, revamped its chart monitoring system.
Billboard used to rely on record outlets to report sales
figures, which turned out to be skewed toward rock and pop
genres. In May Billboard switched to a technology that scans
bar codes on records at retail checkout counters and
electronically tallies actual numbers sold. One result was
that Billboard's chart suddenly included Mr. Smith's hit song
"Place in This World," which rose to fifth place.
   In fact, gospel musicians have been tilting toward secular
idioms to get more air play for at least a decade. "The
gospel music industry began copying secular acts in an
attempt to get others to see the light," says John Styll,
president of the Gospel Music Association. "The music was the
bait in fishing for souls."
   This has stretched the definition of gospel. The Gospel
Music Association's annual Dove awards now are given in 33
categories, from Praise and Worship to Heavy Metal to
Traditional Southern to Contemporary Christian -- the latter
category including Mr. Smith.
   Even so, until very recently gospel has been confined to a
world of its own. Even during the "Jesus movement" of the
1970s, when Christian rock bands appeared, inspirational
music was generally performed for gatherings of believers and
marketed on the spot or through Christian book stores.
   Which is one reason many of Mr. Smith's new fans don't
know he's a gospel singer at all. At a Manhattan record-store
promotion, 20-year-old fan Robert Kaiser, a college student
wearing an earring and a tie-dyed shirt, waits in line for
Mr. Smith's autograph. When the star reveals that this is his
seventh album, Mr. Kaiser blurts, "Wow, really?" On learning
the others were contemporary Christian records, Mr. Kaiser
says, "I don't believe in religion. I'm into an
anthropological view, but hey, that's cool. I still like your
song."
   Another reason for that kind of confusion -- and a key
component in the presentation of Michael W. Smith to the pop
world -- is the chastely steamy video he made to promote
"Place in This World." The video, produced by the same
company that does sizzling videos for Prince, shows a dreamy
Mr. Smith singing and playing the piano in the middle of the
desert while a young, pouting, gorgeous woman wanders around
in the sand. Eventually the two find each other, hold hands,
hug, and sort of nuzzle. The video reached the top five on
cable television's VH-1.
   "Making the video was hard at first," concedes Mr. Smith,
who is married and the father of four young children. "My
wife didn't like me hugging another woman, and my kids said
their mother should have done the video."
   Other fans have objections of their own. "I'm totally
against Michael going secular," says Angela Hoth, an
18-year-old fan from Joplin, Mo., who has written to him
about her concern. She listened to Mr. Smith's songs for
"encouragement" in the last year, especially after a friend
was killed in a car accident. "I worry that he will throw
away his message and lose his ministry to make it in the
secular market," she says.
   The West Side Christian Book Store in Knoxville, Tenn.,
won't play his album over its sound system for fear of
offending older and more fundamentalist customers. "Mr. Smith
may lose some Christian fans by going this route," says store
manager Edward Osborn. "He must be willing to pay that
price."
   Radio station WNDA in Huntsville, Ala., has pulled Mr.
Smith's records from its library and has sent a letter to
other stations and Christian bookstores urging them to follow
suit. In the letter, WNDA said it was particularly offended
that Mr. Smith and another hot gospel performer, Amy Grant,
acted as hosts of VH-1's Top 20 Countdown show. "Not only are
they pushing secular rock stars, but the show is sponsored by
. . . Budweiser," the letter said. It concluded: "The artists
will not return to our playlist until we are satisfied that a
change of heart has taken place and their testimony is
uncompromised by associations with secular rock, alcoholic
beverages and other destructive products."
   Mr. Smith's personal assistant keeps up a lively
correspondence with fans who accuse the singer of selling
out. In one letter to a disappointed fan, the assistant cited
the Bible's admonition to "let your light shine before men,
that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in
heaven." Mr. Smith is following this scripture, the letter
suggested, adding, "Tons of prayer and accountability have
gone into this."
   Mr. Smith's music ranges from soothing ballads to
danceable pop tunes. His songs are sometimes sappy and always
positive in their outlook. He plays the piano and writes his
own songs, and while his voice has been criticized as "thin"
and "ragged," he is taking voice lessons.
   In his current album "Go West Young Man," Mr. Smith urges
listeners to run from the dangers of temptation ("When the
Evil goes East, Go West"). In his song "Old Enough to Know,"
he counsels against premarital sex. His new single, "For
You," is a chirpy confection about friendship ("When you're
up against the wall, you know I'll be here for you, for
you"). It is now moving up the charts.
   When Mr. Smith's label, Reunion Records, pitched him to
Geffen executives, they weren't immediately convinced. They
liked his catchy tunes, his moussed hair, his tight pants and
his Don Johnson stubble, but they made sure to send field
staff to check out his concerts last spring. "They wanted to
be sure he wasn't handing out Bibles," says Dan Harrell, one
of Mr. Smith's managers.
   They were convinced, and Reunion and Geffen signed a
"cross-marketing" agreement under which Reunion markets him
to Christian outlets and Geffen promotes him and distributes
his music to mainstream radio stations and retail stores.
Geffen suggested that he let his hair grow and call himself
"Michael W." rather than "Smitty," as he was known in gospel
circles.
   "Michael W. Smith is in the right place at the right
time," explains his manager, Michael Blanton. "Listeners are
tired of being hit over the head with dance and rap in recent
years, and now they're looking for melodies that they can
sing to and have meaning."
   "The recession has a lot to do with Michael's success,"
adds Terry Hemmings, president of Reunion Records. "When
times are tough, people are looking for a new angle and for
encouragement."
   The internal contradictions of his new stardom don't
appear to bother Mr. Smith. "I've been praying for mainstream
success for years," he says. "Now it's finally happening."
   Mr. Smith, a West Virginia native, moved to Nashville
after high school and broke into the music business as a
songwriter. At the same time he was penning gospel songs, he
was also using marijuana, LSD and cocaine. "I went off the
deep end and got into drugs, which messed me up for a while,"
he confides. His career went nowhere.
   Then in 1979, on the verge of a nervous breakdown, "I hit
the floor in my apartment face down and cried like a baby for
two hours," Mr. Smith recalls. "I got up, said a prayer to
God to turn me around and it's been different ever since."
   Soon, he had signed on as the keyboard player and
songwriter for Amy Grant. "I regret that I did drugs," Mr.
Smith now says, "but it has helped me relate to others with
similar problems due to drugs and low self-esteem."
   Now he is a role model of sorts. "There are almost no
pop-rock acts left that a parent can feel really good about
letting his children see," wrote a reviewer for the
Courier-Journal in Louisville, Ky., after attending Mr.
Smith's concert in May. "Smith offers an alternative."
   "Michael W. Smith is what top-40 radio desperately needs
right now," says Gary Bryan, a disk jockey for radio station
Z-100 in New York. "White, pop, middle-of-the-road hits
provide relief from rap and heavy metal, which are polarizing
our audience."
   This is not, however, just another case of a white
musician being promoted to skim the money off a black musical
idiom. American gospel music began when European settlers
brought over their psalms and folk melodies. "Later, when
plantation cultures tried to Christianize their slaves,
slaves added rhythm and soul to these songs," says Don Cusic,
author of "The Sound of Light: A History of Gospel Music."
   During Reconstruction and the 1890s, gospel music
continued to develop along racial lines, with white gospel
sticking close to hymns and black gospel evolving into
spirituals. The first recording labels devoted to gospel were
founded in 1916, and for decades the industry grew up outside
the mainstream music industry. Now, for the first time, the
gospel sector and major record labels are forming not-so-holy
alliances to exploit the changing marketplace.
   Besides the Reunion-Geffen agreement, Word Inc., the
biggest distributor of Christian music, has signed a
long-term distribution and marketing agreement with Epic
Records. Benson Music Group, an 89-year-old company that
started out selling religious pamphlets and sheet music, is
entering into a licensing agreement with A&amp;M Records. A&amp;M
made a similar pact with Perspective Records for the release
of "The Evolution of Gospel" by the Sounds of Blackness
(which produced a No. 1 hit on the rhythm-and-blues charts).
Amy Grant's "Baby Baby" hit No. 1 on the pop charts this
summer, and the gospel brother-and-sister duo BeBe and CeCe
Winans has become one of Capitol Records' hottest mainstream
acts, hitting No. 1 on Billboard's R&amp;B chart last week.
   Mr. Smith, for his part, is earning about $1 million a
year. He counts President Bush among his fans, and has
performed at the White House. He is reveling in his new
success, and he is comfortable in the curious musical
territory he inhabits. "I know if I'm too blatant about my
Christianity and talk about Jesus I won't succeed in the
mainstream," Mr. Smith says. "But hey, I'm not an evangelist,
I'm a singer."

   Two rap music groups nominated for Grammy
Awards say they are boycotting tonight's ceremonies because they are
insulted their new category was shunted off the the live television
broadcast.
   ``The real Grammy award is the chance to appear on the Grammy
Awards show, with its audience of 100 million Americans,'' said Will
``Fresh Prince'' Smith in a statement. ``Rap music is simply too big
to be overlooked like this.''
   The categories of rap and heavy metal were added to the 76
divisions of awards for the CBS-TV show, the 31st edition of the
Grammys. The show is hosted by Billy Crystal and produced by Pierre
Cossette.
   Folksinger Tracy Chapman and vocal gymnast Bobby McFerrin lead
the nominees. If Miss Chapman sweeps in her six nominated
categories, she will be the first artist to win six trophies in one
night since Roger Miller did it in 1966 for his single ``King of the
Road.''
   Fifteen of the awards are being televised, including the hard
rock and heavy metal for which the group Metallica is a nominee
along with Iggy Pop, Jane's Addiction, Jethro Tull and AC@DC.
   There will be a rap performance by Kool Moe Dee, but that award
category will be called during the usually fast-paced pre-televised
ceremony in which most of the awards are given.
   Rappers say it's an insult, and at least two nominated duos,
Salt-N-Pepa and DJ Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince, plan to boycott
the show.
   Among other musicians slated to perform are Whitney Houston, the
Manhattan Transfer, Luther Vandross, Kool Moe Dee, Sinead O'Connor,
Linda Ronstadt, Melissa Etheridge, Toni Childs, Tracy Chapman and
Itzhak Perlman.
   Special tributes also were set for jazz, country and western and
gospel music.
   Metallica is set to perform their new single ``One,'' from the
nominated album ``...And Justice For All.'' The group is popular
with heavy metal fans, but the band's uncompromising lyrics have
kept it from the wider radio airplay enjoyed by hard rock groups
like Bon Jovi.
   No one was more surprised than Metallica members to learn they
had been asked to perform, one member said.
   ``We've been very stubborn to make sure things would be done our
way and that we wouldn't have to give up creative control,''
Metallica member Lars Ulrich told The Associated Press.
   ``It's great we have been able to take this attitude all the way
to performing live on the Grammys and to be nominated, knowing it's
all being done on our terms,'' he said.
   For the top nominees, Miss Chapman was named in the best song,
record and female pop performance categories for ``Fast Car.'' She
also was nominated for best new artist, and her self-titled album
was nominated for the year's best LP and best contemporary folk
performance.
   McFerrin, already a Grammy veteran with five awards, had
nominations for best song, record and pop male vocal for ``Don't
Worry, Be Happy,'' his No. 1 single. McFerrin, who uses no
instrument except his own voice and body, also was nominated for
best male jazz vocal performance for the song ``Brothers'' and a
best album nomination for ``Simple Pleasures.''
   Another contender for top awards was singer Anita Baker with four
nominations for her one eligible song, ``Giving You The Best That I
Got,'' which competed with Miss Chapman and McFerrin in the record
and song categories. The tune also received best female rhythm and
blues performance and best overall rhythm and blues song performance.

<TEXT>
   Some golden oldies of the stage and screen are
best left undisturbed, particularly if they are going to be
repackaged in wrapping that smothers the charm of the original.
   A case in point is ``Meet Me in St. Louis,'' the old-new musical
that opened Thursday at Broadway's Gershwin Theater. It is a
relentlessly old-fashioned show, not only because of its subject
matter, but because the production is frozen in the cheery,
complacent and cardboard style of Broadway song-and-dance that
flourished in the mid-1950s.
   It's reminiscent of those undemanding, undistinguished shows of
yore, the kind that had big, expensive sets, pretty costumes,
athletic dancing, maybe a star or two and a couple of hummable
tunes. But what may have been, let's say, the best musical of 1953,
has a tougher time on Broadway 1989.
   The musical has its charms, primarily a sweet-singing young
woman named Donna Kane in what used to be called the ingenue role.
In the tradition of Barbara Cook, Florence Henderson, Susan Watson
and others, Kane is bright and, dare we say it, perky. She floats
effortlessly through the score written by Hugh Martin and Ralph
Blane. And the production looks good, thanks to designer Keith
Anderson's opulent, ever-gliding sets.
   But much of the material, spoken and sung, seems second-hand and
as emotionally involving as a saccharine greeting card. The musical
itself comes from an amalgam of sources. It's based on Sally
Benson's ``Kensington Stories'' in The New Yorker, the classic MGM
film starring Judy Garland and another stage incarnation _ also
with music by Martin and Blane _ which was done at the St. Louis
Municipal Opera in the early 1960s.
   This latest version, adapted by Hugh Wheeler before he died in
1987, faithfully follows the plot of the movie. It tells of the
Smith family, circa 1903, which lives in St. Louis right before the
opening of the big Louisiana Purchase Exposition.
   The big development of Act 1 is daughter Esther's attempt to be
noticed by the Boy Next Door, which also is the title of Martin and
Blane's best song. The second act concerns Papa Smith's attempt to
move his family to New York, a decision resisted by everyone in the
clan. For humor, there's little Tootie, the family's youngest
daughter who decapitates her dolls and buries them in the backyard.
   That's not exactly a barn-burner of a plot, so director Louis
Burke and his production team have filled the show with movement
and a lot of dance. Some of it works, particularly the way the
Victorian gingerbread home of the Smith family swirls and glides
into place. And the famous trolley of ``The Trolley Song'' fame
does indeed go clang-clang as it careens around the large Gershwin
stage.
   At other times, all that movement is just an exercise in killing
time. Joan Brickhill's choreography is upbeat, endless and
derivative, particularly a banjo number that suggests the musical
``Half a Sixpence'' and a Sousa march that could have the audience
wondering whether they are watching the finale of ``The Music Man.''
   Martin and Blane's best songs are left over from the Garland
movie. Besides ``The Boy Next Door,'' they include ``Have Yourself
a Merry Little Christmas'' and ``The Trolley Song.''
   ``You Are for Loving,'' a soaring love song from the Muny Opera
version, is the best of the newer numbers. But the other additions
range from pleasant to awful. In the latter category is ``Ice,'' a
hymn to ice-skating that includes the line, ``Ice is nice.''
   George Hearn plays the authoritarian father. He has little to do
but stand there and be stern. He does it quite well. Milo O'Shea as
the kindly grandfather and Betty Garrett as the Irish maid have
their own forgettable musical numbers _ he a little soft shoe, she
an Irish jig _ which they could probably phone in from home.
   Besides Donna Kane, the younger performers include Jason
Workman, in sterling voice and appropriately awkward manner as the
boy next door; Juliet Lambert as her equally lovestruck older
sister; Michael O'Steen as her pompous, Princeton-bound brother;
and an excessively aggressive Courtney Peldon as the unstoppable
Tootie.
   The production also runs on too long, more than two hours and 30
minutes. Director Burke and designer Anderson can pad the show with
fireworks, ice-skating, water fountains that spurt real water and
that ever-clanging trolley, but they can't disguise the fact that
``Meet Me in St. Louis'' never has much more than nostalgia going
for it.

   What other critics said:
   Frank Rich, The New York Times: What's the mission of the stage
replica at the Gershwin Theater? To spread the good will earned by
the overture, I guess. And that task, if not a lot else is
accomplished by this lavish show despite such obstacles as insipid
acting, an inane book and a complete lack of originality.
   Howard Kissel, Daily News: Maybe it's the onset of middle age,
but I found ``Meet Me in St. Louis'' an unexpected delight. There
are dull stretches, songs that don't really pay off, a bit too much
moving of scenery, but if the show doesn't charm you, your heart
must be even harder than a theater critic's.
   Linda Winer, Newsday: ``Meet Me in St. Louis,'' a $6 million
stage version of the MGM movie, opened at the Gershwin Theater last
night, leaving no cliche undecorated. This is a bankrupt idea with
a major bankroll _ a contradiction that amounts to very, very fancy
summer stock.

   Sandi Patti has been voted gospel
music's No. 1 female singer for the eighth straight year and Amy
Grant has been chosen top artist for the third time.
   The two heartfelt vocalists shared major honors Thursday night
with the new a cappella group Take 6, which won four awards at the
20th annual Gospel Music Association awards show.
   Ms. Patti, who has dominated Christian music awards this decade,
won five honors and Ms. Grant earned three.
   Besides winning female vocalist of the year, Ms. Patti won top
inspirational song for ``In Heaven's Eyes,'' No. 1 inspirational
album for ``Make His Praise Glorious,'' choral collection album of
the year for ``Sandi Patti Choral Praise'' and instrumental album
for ``A Symphony of Praise.'' The instrumental award was for the
musicianship of others on the album and not for her vocals.
   ``I sure like what I'm doing,'' Ms. Patti said later. ``I'd do
it if there were awards or not.''
   Ms. Grant broke Ms. Patti's two-year reign as artist of the year
and also won for best contemporary gospel album and short-form
video, both for ``Lead Me On.''
   She said the recording of ``Lead Me On'' was interrupted by the
birth of her son, Matthew, in 1987.
   ``I don't feel like the same girl who started the project,'' she
said, chuckling.
   Ms. Grant, of Nashville, also was voted artist of the year in
1983 and 1986.
   Take 6, which won two Grammy awards in February, added to their
award stockpile even though they have been singing for only two
years and have released just one album.
   The Nashville group was voted group of the year and best new
artist, and won top black gospel album for ``Take 6'' and No. 1
contemporary black gospel song for ``If We Ever.''
   Wayne Watson, who heeded his parents' suggestions to concentrate
on music rather than playing baseball, was named male vocalist of
the year.
   ``I try to be grateful to the Lord and not get puffed up,'' said
Watson, who sings about starving children, people with AIDS and
those who are unfulfilled in religion.
   Watson, of Houston, also won song-of-the-year honors for his
``Friend of a Wounded Heart.''
   Veteran gospel singer Shirley Caesar also was a double winner,
taking awards for black gospel song for ``Hold My Mule'' and
traditional black gospel album for ``Live in Chicago.''
   Two heavy metal categories were added to the awards this year,
and both were won by the four-member group Stryper. Their ``In God
We Trust'' was voted recorded metal gospel song of the year and
also metal album of the year.
   Bruce Carroll was another double winner, taking honors for
country gospel recorded song for ``Above and Beyond'' and country
gospel album for ``Richest Man in Town.''
   The awards, presented at a 3{-hour gala at the Tennessee
Performing Arts Center, are called the Dove Awards to signify the
bird that appeared in the biblical account of the baptism of Christ.
   Winners were chosen by the singers, musicians and songwriters in
the 3,000-member association, based in Nashville. The ceremonies
were not televised.

BRITNY FOX: A HIGH-VOLTAGE ROCK GROUP WITH A KISS OF METAL
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF ZEIGLER, The Allentown (Pa.) Morning Call
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Philadelphia's Britny Fox may look like your average heavy metal band, but the
quartet has more on its mind than the usual heavy metal themes.
</P>
<P>
"We are more hard rock than heavy metal," lead guitarist Michael Kelly Smith
said during a recent telephone interview. "You can hear a lot of influences
from AC-DC and Kiss, but we have developed our own style."
</P>
<P>
The group's self-titled first release contains messages about helping out your
fellow man -- unusual for hard rock -- but Smith is quick to point out that the
band is not ready for the pulpit.
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to preach anything. If you read the lyrics, we have a
message," Smith said, "but we don't base ourselves on that type of thing. We
aren't trying to tell you what to do or what not to do.
</P>
<P>
"The song 'Save the Weak' is saying to take a look around you and realize how
good you might have it because a lot of people are less fortunate than us.
Appreciate what you have," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Another song, "Rock Revolution," deals with censorship in rock and pop music, a
subject that Smith holds a hard line against. "That ("Rock Revolution") is
about the PMRC (Parents Music Resource Center) and how stupid it is," Smith
said. "Hard-rock bands always get the bad rap. They (the PMRC) act as though
that is the worst thing going on in the world. It's OK to put violence on TV,
but you can't have explicit lyrics. . . . "
</P>
<P>
Despite its recent success, Britny Fox has also had its share of tragedy.
</P>
<P>
When the band first formed, its members figured its lineup was set with Dean
Davidson on vocals and rhythm guitar, Billy Childs on bass and former
Cinderella members Smith on lead guitar and Tony Destra on the drums. But
Destra was killed in an automobile accident.
</P>
<P>
"It was a big blow and a real setback, but we wanted to carry on for his sake,"
Smith said. "He wouldn't have wanted us to quit. Things were going good, we had
record company interests. We went too far to quit." The band pressed on and
replaced Destra with Johnny Dee.
</P>
<P>
Smith said that Britny Fox, which derives its name from Davidson's 18th-Century
ancestry, has plans for a new album: "We plan on going into the studio this
summer. The record should be out by the fall or the end of the year. We have
songs left over from the last album's sessions, plus we've been working on
material since then."

   Pearl Bailey was 15 when she sang ``Poor
Butterfly'' in an amateur contest and won a $5 prize. She went on
to win the hearts of millions as a singer, actress and America's
``ambassador of love.''
   Bailey, 72, died at a Philadelphia hospital Friday night.
   ``She was a rare Pearl,'' her road manager E.B. Smith said
Saturday.
   Bailey was known for playing matchmaker Dolly in the black
version of the musical ``Hello, Dolly!'' on Broadway from 1967 to
1969. Others loved her throaty, expressive versions of ``Bill
Bailey, Won't You Please Come Home,'' ``St. Louis Blues,'' ``Row,
Row, Row,'' and ``That's Good Enough for Me.''
   But Bailey's favorite role was that of ``ambassador of love''
and special delegate to the United Nations, where she could spread
her warmth to the world.
   ``You may agree or disagree, but most of all, I think we love,
and we're never quite sure why we love or how we love,'' she said
in an interview in July. ``We just love. And that's it.''
   ``The entertainment world has lost one of the most creative
performers of our time,'' said Carol Channing, who played Dolly on
Broadway in 1964. ``Her talent was unique and enduring and her
warmth was felt by everyone in the audience.''
   Her co-star in ``Hello, Dolly!,'' veteran song-and-dance man Cab
Calloway, said, ``I have lost one of the greatest friends I've ever
had in my life.
   From Philadelphia, Pearl Mae Bailey's career took her to music
halls in small Pennsylvania coal towns, and then to vaudeville,
Broadway, movies and television. She performed with some of the
greatest singers, dancers and comedians of her time.
   Bailey had returned to Philadelphia in July for surgery to
replace an arthritic knee. Officials at Pennsylvania Hospital said
her surgery was without complications and her recovery was normal.
   She was staying at a hotel with her husband, jazz drummer Louis
Bellson Jr., to undergo physical therapy and see her two sisters
when she collapsed Friday night.
   She died later at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, said
hospital spokeswoman Kellyann McDonnell. The cause of death wasn't
known and an autopsy was planned. She had a history of heart
ailments.
   Bellson said Bailey was sewing a piece of needlepoint for one of
her doctors when she said something was wrong with her hands. He
said she asked him to call her doctor and the paramedics.
   Then, he said, ``the kind of look you never want to see''
crossed her face and she slumped in her chair, Bellson told the
Philadelphia Daily News.
   ``I just lost my best friend,'' he said.
   Bellson said that although everyone was devastated by the death,
it was important not retreat into a shell.
   ``It will be hard, but you just have to try and adjust to a new
life. You have to keep on going while you're living, '' he said.
``I know Pearl would have wanted me to forge ahead and do what I
want to do.''
   Bailey had returned to Philadelphia for knee surgery at the
recommendation of her friend, publisher Walter H. Annenberg, former
U.S. ambassador to Britain.
   Annenberg told The Philadelphia Inquirer that the singer was in
``great spirits'' when he saw her after the surgery.
   ``She was dancing around the room to show me how successful it
was,'' he said. ``She wanted to get back to her work at the United
Nations.''
   In 1970, President Nixon named her America's ``ambassador of
love'' to the world. She was a special delegate to the United
Nations under the Ford, Reagan and Bush administrations.
   ``Pearl Bailey was the mother of the world,'' said Stan Irwin,
her manager for 25 years. ``She was a very spiritual woman and she
never recognized color. Her ideology was, `We are humans.'''
   Songwriter Sammy Cahn said Bailey was unique.
   ``She came as advertised. When you said Pearl Bailey, it was a
spirit, a talent,'' he said.
   Bailey's direct and forthright manner carried over to her
throwaway style of singing.
   ``I'm more of a philosopher than a jazz singer,'' she said in a
June interview with The New York Times. ``When people say, `Pearl,
where did you get your style?' I tell them: `I have no style. I
just sing songs.'''
   On Broadway, she appeared in ``House of Flowers'' and ``Bless
You All,'' and enjoyed a long film career, with her movies
including ``Carmen Jones'' and ``Porgy and Bess.''
   The entertainer also wrote humorous and inspirational books,
including ``Raw Pearl,'' ``Talking to Myself'' and ``Between You
and Me.''
   Born in Newport News, Va., on March 29, 1918, she was the
daughter of a minister and the youngest of four children.
   She moved with her family as a child to Washington and later to
Philadelphia. In 1979, she moved from California with her husband
of 38 years to the Arizona resort community of Lake Havasu City in
1979.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete Saturday night. Smith,
Bailey's road manager, said she would be buried in Philadelphia,
near family members, Wednesday or Thursday.
   She also is survived by a son, Tony, and a daughter, Dee Dee.

   You would think that in this barren Broadway
season, just about any song and dance celebration sporting music by
Ellington, Arlen, Armstrong, Handy and others would lift the spirits.
   But for much of the time, that's not the case with ``Black and
Blue,'' the new musical revue that opened Thursday at Broadway's
Minskoff Theater. It's an uneven production that contains flashes of
sass and expert tap dancing but too often settles for the routine.
   Responsibility for that predictability lies with Claudio Segovia
and Hector Orezzoli who are credited in the program with conceiving
and directing this new revue. The duo, creators of the hit ``Tango
Argentino,'' have staged ``Black and Blue'' with surprisingly little
style, something their earlier show had in abundance.
   The musical attempts to recreate the sizzle and snap of the
Cotton Club and Apollo revues that galvanized Harlem audiences in
1920s, '30s and '40s. ``Black and Blue'' might work better in a
nightclub setting. In the cavernous Minskoff, the lack of production
values are apparent, as is the perfunctory quality of Henry LeTang's
ensemble choreography which seems more Las Vegas glitz than Uptown
swagger.
   Excitement is confined mainly to a small group of terrific tap
dancers, mostly in solos, duets and trios. The tappers include such
veterans as Bunny Briggs, Jimmy Slyde, Ralph Brown and Lon Chaney as
well as a talented young hoofer named Savion Glover.
   Briggs, a little man with saucer eyes and an impish smile,
infuses his tap routines with a delicacy that is astonishing. He
embraces Ellington's ``In a Sentimental Mood,'' treating the song as
if it were a partner, and creates a joyousness that is hard to
resist.
   Slyde gets similar results with ``Stompin' at the Savoy,'' but
his style is smoother, slicker, more like a Fred Astaire routine.
And how many dancers can skate across the stage in taps?
   The best number in the show is another Ellington ditty, ``East
St. Louis Toodle-oo,'' with Brown and Chaney, two elder statesman of
tap, showing that age hasn't diminished their love of dance.
   Most of the singing falls to three formidable ladies _ Ruth
Brown, Linda Hopkins and Carrie Smith. Each of these women has her
moment, a showcase to strut her stuff, but often their talents are
not used to best advantage.
   Miss Brown tears up the place in ``St. Louis Blues'' and the
raunchy ``If I Can't Sell It, I'll Keep Sittin' on It,'' but then
seems uneasy in an overly contrived version of ``Body and Soul.''
   Miss Smith, with the deepest voice this side of Vaughan Monroe,
shines through two ill-conceived production numbers, one to ``I've
Got the Right to Sing the Blues.'' It places her on a huge silver
orb that rolls out on stage and then tilts backwards, subjecting the
audience to a bad case of vertigo. The second, ``Am I Blue,'' has
her perched on a swing high above the stage while the long train of
her dress billows to the floor.
   Miss Hopkins may have the most forceful of the three voices, but
she tends to diminish its power by going for the easy laugh and cute
gesture or phrasing. That cuteness mars songs such as ``Cry Like a
Baby,'' a raucous Big Maybelle Smith number.
   Segovia and Orezzoli also created the scenery, costumes and
lighting. Their settings are minimal, mostly curtains in various
shades of red, yellow, blue and gray, but they serve as backdrops
for the team's striking lighting designs.
   The lighting allows for the performers' shadows, sometimes
reaching to proscenium, to hover over the stage, or to be splashed
on the side walls of the theater. These dancing shadows spark ``I'm
Confessin' That I Love You,'' the one ensemble number that really
utilizes the performers, the stage and the production design.
   The fine orchestra, conducted by Leonard Oxley, is composed of
expert musicians, including Sir Roland Hanna as its principal piano
soloist.
   The best of the recent black musical revues _ the original
``Ain't Misbehavin''' and the off-Broadway hit ``One Mo' Time,'' for
example _ harnessed an energy that built throughout the entire
evening. ``Black and Bllue'' scatters its resources and could end
after just about any number in the second act. There's no emotional
payoff. Instead, you have to wait patiently for those marvelous tap
dancers to come on stage and take over the place.
   In other reviews:
   Howard Kissel in the Daily News said the show ``is in a class by
itself.'' `` `Black and Blue' is closer in spirit to other eras,''
he wrote. ``If you listen ... you hear a dignity, an elegance, a
worldliness that stands in great contrast to the aggressiveness and
desperation that underlie so much of our pop music.''
   In the New York Post, Clive Barnes called the show, ``downright
terrific. ... It has passion, finesse, fun and, above all, style.''
   But Frank Rich in The New York Times said the show was ``a weird,
at times diverting, crosscultural mishmash.''
   ``While bursting with talent worthy of the Cotton Club or the
Apollo or Birdland, `Black and Blue' looks like the bloated
nightclub floor shows that used to flourish in decadent Latin
American capitals just before dictatorships collapsed.''

<LEADPARA>  ALMOST 20 years after her death, Mahalia Jackson remains the most famous name
in gospel music. Although she was only one of a number of great female
soloists, she was the one that crossed over to a white and mainstream
audience, which in turn meant major-label recordings, huge concerts in this
country and Europe and frequent television appearances. Given her wide and
enduring popularity, it is natural that Columbia records should make a Jackson
box set the flagship of their new "Gospel Spirit" series.;   Most people
remember Jackson as she was in her later years, and as she was on television.
A large woman, she would stand still on stage in a long dress. Her eyes would
be fixed on some point above and beyond the camera, and her voice and manner
proclaimed her majesty. Her solidity and respectability were those of a
classical singer, and she stood firmly for tradition and the old spirituals.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In fact, though, Jackson was far from a traditionalist. Traditional black
church singing (like European-based church singing) was a group activity:
There were song leaders, but no real soloists. It was the rise of the
fundamentalist churches, with their more fervently emotional forms of worship,
that led to the gospel revolution.;   Newer than jazz, blues; While gospel is
spoken of today as a roots music, it is hardly 60 years old. Often described
as the basis of jazz and blues, it is newer than either and influenced by
both. Through the years, it has freely borrowed what it wanted from the
secular music of its day, adding and changing instrumentation and style while
always keeping an eye on its traditional roots.;   Jackson was part of the
first generation of innovators. She often sang traditional hymns, but she also
acknowledged her love for popular blues singers. She cited Bessie Smith as an
influence, and her singing was marked by blues phrasing, sliding between notes
and playing with the beat. In the '30s, many church people still regarded this
style of music as practically blasphemous, a "jazzing up" of church singing.;
 "Gospels, Spirituals and Hymns" is a two-CD box of Jackson's work for
Columbia in the '50s and '60s. Unlike the Robert Johnson and Bessie Smith
boxes that led Legacy's blues series, it is a selection rather than a
comprehensive collection, but it gives a decent overview of her work for the
label.;   Along with the Jackson box, "The Gospel Spirit" includes five discs
by less familiar artists. The Golden Gate Quartet and the Staple Singers show
early and late versions of the gospel quartet style, the main force in gospel
in the '40s and '50s. A live recording of the Abyssinian Baptist Gospel Choir
gives a good picture of gospel church singing.;   As with their blues series,
Columbia has made some odd choices. The reissues include an album by Paul
Robeson, who was many things but in no way a gospel singer, and four of the
six albums include secular material. Even the Jackson box includes a couple of
markedly inferior country-western songs while missing some of her strongest
work. Still, the gems far outweigh the clinkers.;   Jackson made her first
recordings in the '30s, then in the '40s had a string of hits on the Apollo
label. By the time she moved to Columbia, her style was firmly fixed and
accepted by the church, and her new audience took her for a "pure"
traditionalist. And yet innovation is audible in every note, and you're
continually struck by her inventiveness. On standard hymns and spirituals that
we all have heard countless times, it is impossible to guess from moment to
moment which note she will hit or when she will hit it.;   The Columbia box is
weighted toward traditional spirituals, to which Jackson increasingly turned
as she performed more for white audiences, but it also has a fine sampling of
original gospel songs, including four by Thomas A. Dorsey, "The Father of
Gospel Music.";   Gospel at its purest; As a pianist and singer, Dorsey was a
blues star before becoming one of the foremost gospel composers. Jackson
toured with him in the '40s, and his blues-influenced compositions were
perfectly suited to her style. Her version of his masterpiece, "Take My Hand,
Precious Lord," is gospel at its purest. Jackson sings at a very slow pace,
the slowness creating astonishing tension, teasing the words and making us
wait. Her voice promises immense power as it begins a phrase, then
surprisingly trails off into a wisp of melismatic falsetto.;   Between lines,
when Jackson pauses to breathe, the breaths are clearly audible -- not
theatrically overstated, just there, emphasizing her reality. It is the
difference between virtuosity and slickness. Nothing seems forced, and all of
it is used to drive home the message of the lyric. Familiar as the song is,
Jackson makes it sound new.;   Dorsey favored female soloists, but they were
far from the only stars in gospel. They were more familiar to non-gospel
audiences, but within the church their popularity was equaled by male
quartets, female and family groups and church choirs.;   "Swing Low Sweet
Chariot," an album of classic 1940s recordings of the Golden Gate Quartet,
definitely has that swing. The Gates were the top "jubilee" quartet, with
intricately jazzy vocal arrangements and unmatched rhythmic precision. Today,
the Gates sound somewhat dated, lacking the emotional force of the "hard"
gospel singers, but they show a side of gospel that is often overlooked -- its
consummate technical expertise and professionalism. Interestingly, the Gates'
rhythmic recountings of Bible stories bear an uncanny resemblance to modern
rap.  </TEXT>

ZAN THOMPSON: A LOOK BEHIND THE NAME IN LIGHTS

Kirby was sitting at the piano in front of a window. It was raining, as it does
in the San Fernando Valley, as if it would not stop until water reached the
windowsills. There was a fireplace with a soft fire gossiping to itself and the
scent of the rain.
</P>
<P>
Kirby Tepper's parents weren't home, and Kirby was entertaining himself and me
by playing the piano. He played an insistent melody, with the refrain picking
up the counterpoints of the rain and the fire. "What's that, Kirby?" I asked
after awhile. He said, "Oh, nothing. I'm just noodling."
</P>
<P>
It was the kind of melody scrap that hurts like a half-forgotten love you
thought was safely laid to rest.
</P>
<P>
I thought to myself that Kirby, then about 16, had a pouch full of gifts. The
kid could dance, sing, compose, play the piano like an angel. He is the son of
very high-test friends of mine, his father a trial lawyer and his mother a
television executive, and I have rejoiced in their friendship for more than 20
years.
</P>
<P>
Kirby, even at 16, had the effortless style of a seasoned pro, the kind of
presentation that is seldom in place until it has been shined and molded by
nights without end in front of an audience.
</P>
<P>
I saw him again the other night at the Cinegrill. When we turned the corner to
the parking lot, I saw the name Kirby Tepper in lights on the sign on top of
the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. I screamed with delight. He has a nightclub act,
with songs he has written, tongue-in-cheek songs, love songs.
</P>
<P>
Since that rainy afternoon when I knew that Kirby was gifted with a large load
of talent, he has done the pro forma internship. He made the pilgrimage to New
York and landed a job in the revival of "On Your Toes," directed by its
originator, George Abbott, one of the revered names in musical comedy history.
It was the year Abbott received the Kennedy Center honors for his body of work.
So the show ran for a couple of weeks in Washington, D.C., and then went to
Broadway, where it ran for a year and a half.
</P>
<P>
Then Kirby came back to Los Angeles and continued to study his craft. He wrote
and was the linchpin in a show called, "Back Home -- A Los Angeles Musical," at
the Cast Theater in Hollywood. Kirby closed the show after six months because
he wanted to do other things, and every week of its run, "Back Home" was named
Critics' Choice for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
I asked him the other day what was the toughest material to write. He looked at
me as if I were speaking Urdu. "It isn't hard," he said. "It all comes easy. I
love to do the comic songs and have the people laugh. It's like doing a comic
scene."
</P>
<P>
He has been commissioned to write numbers for other performers, which he also
likes to do.
</P>
<P>
Danny Simon, brother of the icon Neil Simon, worked with Kirby on writing
comedy.
</P>
<P>
The act opens with a song called, "Don't You Just Love It Here," a paean to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
The pace and feeling change with a song about two people in love who then look
at each other and realize there is nothing there but a bittersweet fragrance in
the air. He calls it, "What Happened This Time." Kirby is joined for this and
other numbers by singer Kimberlee Baxter.
</P>
<P>
Kirby does a good-natured send-up of Michael Feinstein, playing the piano
thumpingly and hitting some fractured glissandos and vocal clinkers.
</P>
<P>
One of his songs is, "The Girl With Her Hair in a Bun," which is a study of
every toplofty ballerina who ever looked down her delicate nose at any other
kind of dancing.
</P>
<P>
Kirby does a comedy song on the Santa Fe-Sedona craze, which caused perfectly
sane people to do their houses in desert colors with replicas of Indian
cliff-dweller ladders reaching up to nowhere.
</P>
<P>
His accompanist for the evening is a young man named David Holcenberg.
</P>
<P>
He will appear at the Cinegrill again toward the end of summer, and he will
return to the Gardenia, a Hollywood nightclub that has sent forth a number of
performers.
</P>
<P>
When I saw him at the Cinegrill, I thought of that young boy sitting at the
piano on a rainy afternoon, "just noodling." Now his name is in lights.

   Ave Verum Corpus: Motets and Anthems by William Byrd (Collegium)
_ The Cambridge Singers, directed by John Rutter.
   Peter Philips: Paradisus Sacris Cantionibus (Accent) _ Currende,
directed by Erik Van Nevel.

   It is a comfort to have a recording at last of William Byrd's
``Non vos relinquam orphanos'' (``I will not leave you
comfortless'').
   Not even two minutes long, the motet is a little masterpiece of
Elizabethan music. Byrd combines a powerful feeling of sadness at
parting with a quietly affirmative ``alleluia.''
   Though he enjoyed the patronage of the Protestant Queen
Elizabeth I, Byrd clung to his Roman Catholic faith _ a devotion
that cost others their lives. ``Non vos relinquam,'' like most of
his later work, was written for Catholic services held in homes and
probably sung by musical amateurs.
   The Cambridge Singers, all adults, never approach the grandeur
of a cathedral choir of men and boys. However, with 71 minutes of
music and excellent notes, it's an exemplary addition to the small
but growing number of Byrd recordings.
   Peter Philips was also an English Catholic and may have been
Byrd's pupil before fleeing to the Low Countries, but he belonged
to another world.
   ``Ecce vicit leo'' (``Behold the lion''), the first of the 22
motets presented by the Belgian choir Currende, sounds very like
Giovanni Gabrieli's double-choir compositions for St. Mark's
Cathedral in Venice.
   The feeling is confident, extravagant, in contrast to Byrd's
restraint.
   Philips has been sorely neglected in recordings, and this
generous, polished recording is a solid beginning.

   ``Evidence'' (Chrysalis) _ Boo Hewerdine and Darden Smith

   This is a serendipitous musical meeting that almost makes the
Traveling Wilburys seem calculated by comparison.
   Boo Hewerdine fronts an obscure British band called the Bible.
Darden Smith is a struggling Texas singer-songwriter. In New York
City for the 1988 New Music Seminar, they were introduced by a
mutual friend, hit it off and began writing songs together. It took
just eight days to write a terrific album's worth of songs.
   ``Evidence'' exudes good feeling. This is folk-rock with a
smile, music with the spark of inspiration close to the surface.
``Out of This World'' vividly evokes the walking-on-air feeling of
new love, and does it with such simplicity that nursery rhymes are
quoted for lyrics. On ``Reminds Me a Little of You,'' a listener
can practically feel the presence of the woman for whom the
narrator is pining.
   Like so many albums today, the acoustic guitar is the musical
centerpiece, with other instruments added for dashes of colors.
Call it the Tracy Chapman Effect. It allows the artists to sink or
swim solely on the strength of their songs. Of the 12 songs on this
record (a lucky 13 on CD), there's not a weak cut.
   ``I want my cake mixed in with my pie,'' Hewerdine and Smith
sing on the slightly absurd ``All I Want (Is Everything).'' Here's
hoping they get their wish.

   ``Human Soul'' (RCA) _ Graham Parker

   Graham Parker is one of those artists the critics love but most
of the public has never heard. He's too intelligent and quirky for
Top 40 and AOR stations, and not quite radical enough for many
college stations.
   That's where home stereos come in.
   ``Human Soul,'' Parker's 12th LP, will tickle your tape deck,
rev up your record player.
   He continues in the bright pop rock groove of his last album,
``The Mona Lisa's Sister,'' but here he quickens the pace on many
tracks and cranks up his colorful imagination.
   ``Little Miss Understanding'' kicks it off with danceable,
ska-inflected sounds and typical wordplay: ``You're a woman with a
crazy man, Like a wasp that's stuck in jam, But I won't sting you
if you don't sting me.''
   After a few ballads and pop songs, Parker closes out the ``Real
Side'' _ or Side 1 _ with ``Soultime.'' The ska sound comes back
bigger _ with horns reminiscent of The Specials _ and blends with a
reggae-ified beat (something he's dabbled in on other albums).
   But the real action is on the ``Surreal Side'' _ or Side 2.
   ``Everything Goes'' starts off a suite of five continuous songs
that are faster and darker than those on the flip side.
``Everything'' showcases Parker's unusual talent for combining
heavy lyrics with lighthearted, punchy melodies. To a sweet tune,
he sings about a serial killer and more mundane horrors.
   He jumps right into the hyped-up ``Sugar Gives You Energy,''
then a sardonic tale of suburbia, ``Daddy's a Postman'' and ``Green
Monkeys,'' a cryptic doodling about AIDS.
   The suite closes out with ``I Was Wrong,'' where the music stops
cold, sucked right out of existence.
   On the last cut, ``Slash and Burn,'' he bites hard, but he still
offers a head-bobbing beat.
   Parker gets more urgent with this LP than he did on his last
record or in his mellower ``Another Grey Area'' period around 1982.
The world could end dead in its tracks, just as this record does,
he suggests.
   But not if Parker can help it.

GAZING INTO A CRYSTAL BALL;
</P>
<P>
BETS ARE ON NEWCOMER TRACY CHAPMAN FOR A SWEEP
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Tracy Chapman is about to become a household name.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year old singer from Boston is expected to sweep the 31st annual Grammy
Awards on Wednesday night, winning in all six categories in which she was
nominated. That would represent the best showing ever by a new artist,
surpassing Christopher Cross' five-award blitz in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Chapman's critically hailed debut album "Tracy Chapman" is the betting favorite
to win the Grammy for album of the year and her "Fast Car" -- a stark portrait
of a woman trapped in a cycle of poverty -- has the inside track to be named
both best record and song.
</P>
<P>
Chapman is also expected to win in three other categories: new artist, female
pop vocal and contemporary folk performance. Only two other performers have
ever won as many as six Grammys in one year: Roger Miller with six in 1966 for
"King of the Road," and Michael Jackson with eight in 1984 for the "Thriller"
album.
</P>
<P>
Jackson is back in the record of the year finals with "Man in the Mirror," and
could upset the Chapman bandwagon. There will be some sentiment to give the
award to Jackson to take the sting out of his Grammy shutout last year.
</P>
<P>
Perennial Grammy favorite Bobby McFerrin's "Don't Worry, Be Happy" will also
receive support in the best record balloting. The hit was so pervasive, it
found its way into the presidential race when George Bush briefly adopted it as
his campaign theme song. Also up for best record: Anita Baker's "Giving You the
Best That I Got" and Steve Winwood's "Roll With It."
</P>
<P>
Chapman's strongest challengers in the best album race are George Michael's
"Faith" and Sting's " . . . Nothing Like the Sun." Michael, the former leader
of the bubble gum duo Wham!, has come a long way in the past two years. But he
is still regarded by some as contrived and blatantly commercial. Sting is a
Grammy perennial, with nine awards since 1980. But ". . . Nothing Like the Sun"
didn't have the impact that "Tracy Chapman" did.
</P>
<P>
Also vying for best album: Winwood's "Roll With It" and McFerrin's "Simple
Pleasures."
</P>
<P>
"Don't Worry, Be Happy" is Chapman's main rival in the best song finals, but it
lacks the social consciousness of "Fast Car" and other recent champs like "We
Are the World" and "That's What Friends Are For." Also nominated: Baker's
"Giving You the Best That I Got," Sting's "Be Still My Beating Heart" and
Brenda Russell's "Piano in the Dark."
</P>
<P>
There's no contest in the best new artist race. The also-rans are Vanessa
Williams, Toni Childs, Rick Astley and Take 6.
</P>
<P>
Whitney Houston could give Chapman a run for the pop female vocal award.
Houston, nominated for "One Moment in Time," won in this category in 1986 and
1987, but she'll probably finish second this time. Also nominated: Joni
Mitchell, Taylor Dayne and Brenda Russell.
</P>
<P>
Chapman is a shoo-in in the contemporary folk category. The competition: Sweet
Honey in the Rock, John Prine, Michelle Shocked and the South African artists
on the "Homeland" compilation.
</P>
<P>
D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince's lighthearted, universal lament,
"Parents Just Don't Understand," is expected to win in the new rap category,
while Metallica's critically admired " . . . And Justice for All" is the one to
beat in the new hard rock/metal division.
</P>
<P>
Here are the likely winners in other key categories:
</P>
<P>
Pop Vocal Performance, Male: McFerrin's "Don't Worry, Be Happy," by the
narrowest of margins over Michael's "Father Figure." Also nominated in this
ultra-competitive race: Sting, Steve Winwood and three-time champ Phil Collins.
</P>
<P>
Pop Duo/Group: Look for the Beach Boys to win their first Grammy with the No. 1
hit "Kokomo." Also possible: Brenda Russell &amp; Joe Esposito's "Piano in the
Dark."
</P>
<P>
Rock Female: Tina Turner's "Tina Live in Europe" over Pat Benatar's "All Fired
Up" and releases by three critically acclaimed newcomers: Sinead O'Connor, Toni
Childs and Melissa Etheridge, who will likely split the "progressive" vote.
</P>
<P>
Rock Male: Look for Rod Stewart to win his first Grammy for "Forever Young" in
a close race with Eric Clapton's "After Midnight" from his "Crossroads"
compilation (which is a cinch to win for best historical album). Also possible:
Robert Palmer's "Simply Irresistible."
</P>
<P>
Rock Duo/Group: U2 triumphed last year with "The Joshua Tree" and is likely to
win again with the hit single "Desire." Also possible: INXS' "Kick."
</P>
<P>
R&amp;B Female and R&amp;B Song: Baker won in these categories two years ago
with "Rapture" and "Sweet Love," respectively, and should repeat this year with
"Giving You the Best That I Got."
</P>
<P>
R&amp;B Male: Look for Luther Vandross to win his first Grammy with his album
"Any Love." Also possible: Teddy Pendergrass and Stevie Wonder.
</P>
<P>
R&amp;B Duo/Group: Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips seem to be headed for their
first Grammy in 15 years with their hit "Love Overboard." Also possible: New
Edition and the Jets.
</P>
<P>
Country Female: Last year's winner, K.T. Oslin, and the 1987 champ, Reba
McEntire, are vying again. Look for Oslin to repeat with "Hold Me."
</P>
<P>
Country Male: Last year's winner, Randy Travis, is apt to retain his title with
"Old 8 X 10."
</P>
<P>
Country Duo/Group: The Judds -- for the fourth time in the past five years --
with "Give a Little Love."
</P>
<P>
Country Vocal Collaboration: Roy Orbison &amp; k.d. Lang's "Crying," one of
Orbison's last recordings before his death in December, should squeak past
Dwight Yoakam &amp; Buck Owens' "Streets of Bakersfield."
</P>
<P>
Grein correctly predicted all five of the album of the year nominees and four
of the five record of the year finalists earlier this year.

SCOPE: QUALITY TIME FOR SOME FAMILIES IS A TRIP TO CLASSROOM
</P>

<P>
Larry Nix had not been back to school in 14 years, and he never expected that
the day he finally returned he would find himself sitting in a circle singing
the children's song, "Cheesecake, gobble gobble, cheesecake gobble gobble."
</P>
<P>
But there he was, with wife Andrea, his two daughters Shante and Tiffany, and
15 other children he had never laid eyes on, watching a banjo-playing teacher
who called himself Michael Jackson and referred to the rest of the class as the
Jackson family.
</P>
<P>
"This is fantastic," Nix said. "It makes you feel like a kid all over again."
</P>
<P>
Nix, a 31-year-old janitor, went to Washington Elementary School in Bellflower
on a recent Saturday with his family to relearn some of the basic academic
skills he had forgotten since graduating from Centennial High School in
Compton.
</P>
<P>
What he got was his first computer lesson, a few sing-alongs with teacher Jim
Lanners, a.k.a. Michael Jackson, a lecture on personal safety from the
"Stranger Danger Lady" who warned the children against talking to strangers,
and his first homework assignment since 1976: instructions for the family to
create whatever they wanted from a bag of marshmallows, a box of Jell-O and
some toothpicks.
</P>
<P>
The Nix family is among the first participants in a Bellflower Unified School
District program for parents who do not have the money to go back to school and
who are looking for a way to spend more time with their children, project
coordinator Linda Bobkowski said.
</P>
<P>
Every Saturday for half a day, parents and their children meet at Washington
Elementary School, where they play together for one hour until parents separate
to attend classes that hone their reading, writing and mathematics skills on a
computer.
</P>
<P>
Bobkowski calls the 14-week program Parent Partners and said it is the only
program in Los Angeles County and perhaps Southern California designed to get
low-income families involved in school life. Bobkowski said children are taught
hygiene, self-esteem, good nutrition and personal safety, and their mothers and
fathers learn basic parenting and academic skills.
</P>
<P>
"How can the parents help their kids if they don't have the skills?" Bobkowski
asked parents recently. "A lot of parents don't want to help their kids with
schoolwork, because they don't know how to do it. It doesn't mean you are
stupid or uneducated. It just means you need help in basic skills."
</P>
<P>
During the first meeting of Parent Partners in a classroom with crooked
Valentine hearts pasted on the windows and wooden dinosaur toys scattered
about, Nix grabbed the chance to relearn what he said he did not learn well in
the first place -- math, reading and writing.
</P>
<P>
"This is a chance for me to make up for it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bobkowski said the program is modeled after a federal program known as Even
Start. It is Bobkowski's hope that Parent Partners will eventually be funded by
a federal grant. The $4,000 project was coordinated by Bobkowski, Merwyn Smith,
director of adult education programs, and Maryann Suggs, director of child
development programs. It is supported by federal funds for poverty level
families.
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure that when parents are learning, kids are learning, too,"
Suggs said.
</P>
<P>
Eleven families have joined already, and Smith said that because the program is
well under way no more families will be allowed to join.
</P>
<P>
On the first Saturday of the program, nine families with about 20 children gave
up a sunny weekend morning to go to school, and no one seemed to mind. They
came for different reasons: some to learn how to work with their children, some
to show their children that they are interested in what they do at school, and
some to brush up on academic skills.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to help everybody all the way around," said Donna Rodgers, 53, who
attended the classes with her daughter and 6-year-old grandson, Brian. "I've
always wanted to learn the computer. If I had one at home, I could find
something to do to supplement my income. Anything would help."
</P>
<P>
Third-grader Cheri Ballard, who was busy covering the classroom's frantic
gerbil with raw white rice, did not know much about her mother's being able to
take classes, but said she was glad her mother was coming to school. "We never
get to see her that much," Cheri said.
</P>
<P>
Cheri's mother, Sharon, said: "I wasn't sure what this program was going to be
about," Ballard said. "I just knew I needed more communication and time with my
daughters. This will give us a chance to have time together, I hope."
</P>
<P>
For Mireya and Sebastian Cerda, Parent Partners is much more than being able to
spend time with their 3-year-old daughter, Angela, or sitting down in front of
a computer for the first time. It is an indoctrination into American society,
Mireya Cerda said. The couple moved to Bellflower from Chile about 1 1/2 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
"We come from another culture," she said. "We are learning two things. We are
learning about the society and we are learning to be parents."

<TEXT>
<P>
In the parlor below the deck of her houseboat docked on the Potomac, a youngish
woman -- blond and dressed in white -- recounts the dream and nightmare of her
search for her long-hidden legend-filled past.
</P>
<P>
Among the framed old photographs decorating the wood-paneled room, there is
only one that really matters to Jett Williams: a black-and-white picture of a
handsome young man in a cowboy hat with a dreamy expression on his face.
</P>
<P>
It is no ordinary face, no ordinary family photograph. The man is famous, an
immortal icon of popular culture. Pictures just like this belong to his fans
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
But this 37-year-old married woman, who has embarked on a show business career
of her own, is more than an overzealous fan. The man in the photograph is the
object of a 15-year obsession that has taken her down a long, lonesome road of
legal battles and family feuds that have resulted in a complete transformation
of her identity.
</P>
<P>
He is the legendary country singer-songwriter Hank Williams. And she -- unaware
of it until she was 21 -- is his daughter.
</P>
<P>
Hank Williams is more than just a singer and composer; he can be credited, with
the equally legendary Roy Acuff, of being a founder of country music. His songs
emphasize the poetic beauty of romantic misery. Such Williams classics as "Your
Cheatin' Heart" and "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry" formed the basic vocabulary
of the country repertoire.
</P>
<P>
The story of Jett Williams -- adopted at age 3 -- and her struggle to establish
her identity as her father's daughter is a tale of more pathos, more twists and
turns, than a country ballad.
</P>
<P>
It is a story that has the ingredients of a Southern Gothic novel: a baby whose
father dies five days before she is born and whose mother abandoned her;
betrayal by relatives who placed her for adoption; a fight over an inheritance;
the refusal of the legitimate son to recognize his illegitimate sibling;
persistence in the face of great odds; a fortuitous discovery of a hidden
document; and, for good measure, a love affair with and eventual marriage to
the lawyer who helped right the wrongs.
</P>
<P>
Beyond and above all the maneuverings and scheming is the transcendent theme of
the love of a daughter for a father she would never know and her belief in his
love for her.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that I've had a guardian angel -- I really, really do. And I've
implied that I think my father is my guardian angel, and that he's looking
down," Williams says in her Alabama accent.
</P>
<P>
With the help of ghostwriter Pamela Thomas, Williams has written about her life
in "Ain't Nothin' as Sweet as My Baby" (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich). The book's
publication date is today, the birthday of Hank Williams Sr.
</P>
<P>
If there is one thing Jett Williams has learned from her decision to get to the
bottom of the truth about her past, it is that her efforts to establish herself
as who she really is -- Hank Williams' daughter -- have been met with less than
sentimental appreciation by many people, including relatives in her real and
adoptive families.
</P>
<P>
Her half-brother, Hank Williams Jr., 42, a celebrated country singer in his own
right, refuses to acknowledge his half-sister, although he and his lawyers have
been aware of her existence for at least 20 years.
</P>
<P>
They declined to discuss the case. "Since there is ongoing litigation between
us, our policy is not to comment," said attorney Chris Horsnell of Wyatt,
Tarrant, Combs, Gilbert &amp; Milom, the Nashville firm that represents Hank
Williams Jr.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Jett Williams -- as she is known professionally and to most of her
friends but whose legal married name is Cathy Deupree Adkinson -- established
in Montgomery County Circuit Court in Montgomery, Ala., that she was the
biological daughter of Hank Williams.
</P>
<P>
But she has yet to succeed in laying hold on the corollary to that fact: her
share of her father's estate and his royalties -- which are said to amount to
about $1 million a year.
</P>
<P>
Many of those who knew Hank Williams Sr. and have met his daughter agree that
she resembles him. She has the same distinct features and steady gaze.
</P>
<P>
Her quest for her father has a character of almost religious intensity that
represents an unsettling precedent for other families with adopted children who
decide to seek out their roots.
</P>
<P>
She always knew she was adopted because she could remember arriving at the home
of her adoptive parents, a prosperous Mobile, Ala., businessman named Wayne
Deupree and his wife, Louise. When Jett Williams was 21, her adoptive parents
visited her at the University of Alabama in Montgomery to tell her about a
$2,000 legacy left her by a relative of her real father.
</P>
<P>
With a clumsiness that only well-meaning relatives can achieve, Louise Deupree
informed her adopted daughter that her real father was famous, a famous
musician from Montgomery, and suggested that she take a guess at who he was.
The then-Cathy Deupree guessed Hank Williams quickly, not an odd coincidence in
view of his celebrity in Alabama. Her mother went on to tell her that there was
no proof.
</P>
<P>
In her 20s, Williams married and worked as a recreational officer in the parks
system of Montgomery. The idea of Hank Williams would not go away, and she set
about trying to garner information about her past. She encountered many brick
walls. Finally, as she was about to give up, she was introduced by a relative
to a Washington lawyer, F. Keith Adkinson, who had served as chairman of
Democrats for Reagan in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, Adkinson took an interest in the case and, subsequently, a
personal interest in Williams. After Williams was divorced from her first
husband, she and Adkinson married in 1986, and Williams says much of her
strength is due to her relationship with her husband.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, she and Adkinson had initiated legal action in Alabama and New York.
In July, 1989, the Alabama State Supreme Court found that Williams had been the
victim of fraud and ruled that the estate of Hank Williams Sr. be reopened, 15
years after it was closed. Williams has been judged an heir of equal dignity
with her half-brother; his application to have the case appealed to the U.S.
Supreme Court has been denied.
</P>
<P>
In New York, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed earlier orders
denying Williams a claim on her father's royalties and the Federal District
Court, Southern District of New York, has judged that she should be given a
jury trial to hear the merits of her claim.
</P>
<P>
Williams and Adkinson are understandably delighted with their legal
achievements. For five intense years, they have lived with the emotional
repercussions of intra-family litigation. Since that time, Williams has also
sued her adoptive family over the contested will of her adoptive mother, who
died in 1987.
</P>
<P>
There have been few questions in Williams' mind as to whether it has been worth
it. "I feel I'm a more positive person now," she says.
</P>
<P>
"You don't choose your real parents. For me the point is finding out what my
father wanted and then carrying out his wishes," says Williams, and she returns
to this idea, over and over again.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, she says, her life, from the time she was adopted, has always been in
the power of the courts. "My life is still being decided by the stroke of pens
-- somebody signs an order, and all of a sudden 'Bingo.' "
</P>
<P>
There have been many personal changes as a result of the pen strokes that have
brought her closer to her real father.
</P>
<P>
She has adopted a stage name made up of the last names of both her natural
mother (Bobbie Jett) and father. She moved from Montgomery to Washington after
she met and married Adkinson. And she has long since ceased being a recreation
officer and embarked on a singing career that emulates that of her father,
including singing his songs, and wearing white, his signature color.
</P>
<P>
Williams recognizes that her quest has not been without its complications: "On
this hand, I got this, and on that hand, I lose that. You win a father and you
never saw him."
</P>
<P>
Her story is different in several respects from that of the typical adoptee.
Although her natural parents were not married, they never planned to put her up
for adoption. She was put up for adoption because of the action of her father's
sister, contrary to wishes he had expressed in writing. This distinction has
given extra credence to her camp's legal arguments that she is a legitimate
heir.
</P>
<P>
Before her birth, Williams' parents signed a contract that provided for her
custody, partly with her father, Hank Williams, and partly with her mother.
This document had been hidden for 30 years and came to light in circumstances
that Adkinson will not divulge except to say that it was found in 1984 in
Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
For Williams, who never dreamed she would see written, signed, notarized
evidence that she was her father's daughter, it was the high point of her
search. "When I got that contract and I knew that he wanted me and that he was
my father, I just knew that I had to carry out his wishes, which I feel weren't
carried out."
</P>
<P>
Hank Williams' songs aptly reflected a life of emotional confusion. Williams'
mother, Bobbie Jett, was six months pregnant with her when Hank Williams
married his second wife, Billie Jean Eshliman.
</P>
<P>
In 1953, five days before his daughter was born, Williams died in the back of a
baby blue Cadillac. The cause of death, though never definitely established,
has been presumed to have been from complications brought on by alcohol and
drug addiction. He was 29 years old.
</P>
<P>
However, Hank Williams had considered what would happen to his daughter should
he not be around to take care of her personally. He had asked his mother,
Lillian Stone, to adopt the child should such a situation arise.
</P>
<P>
This she did. But her action did not protect the little girl, then called Cathy
Yvonne Stone, from the state adoption system. In a second twist, Lillian Stone
also died a short time after the adoption was legal. Provisions that had been
made to care for the baby in the Williams' family by Hank's sister, Irene
Smith, were not taken up. Hank Williams' daughter went to the state for
eventual adoption.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know exactly why Irene Smith chose not to keep me. I think it might
have been because of wagging tongues, but I'll never know for sure," Williams
says. Contacted by telephone in Texas, Irene Smith said she did not want to
comment.
</P>
<P>
As part of her battle to assemble the truth about her past, Williams has had to
face unpalatable facts. "I guess, as an adopted child, once you cross the
barrier of 'I want to know' then you pursue it. It's the 'want to know'
strength that keeps you going, even when you hit a dead end."
</P>
<P>
But Williams cautions other adoptees to think carefully before pursuing a
course like hers: "I wanted to warn adopted children to be careful when you do
this because it doesn't always turn out. You have to prepare yourself for the
worst-case scenario. I encourage adoptive parents that if the time comes, you
should be a part of it -- if you can be a part of it, then you don't alienate
yourself."
</P>
<P>
In Williams' own case, her adoptive father, Wayne Deupree, who died in 1983,
had been able and willing to support his daughter in her search. Her adoptive
mother found every part of her daughter's efforts toward her parents
emotionally painful.
</P>
<P>
Now that she knows who she is and where she came from, Williams' life has some
of the trappings of celebrity that her father knew.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after they met, Adkinson had the idea that Williams should consider a
singing career and saw to it that she was introduced to country music producers
in Nashville. Owen Bradley, who produced Patsy Cline and other country stars,
listened to her sing and felt she had potential.
</P>
<P>
Williams received voice coaching and took steps toward her own singing career.
Members of her father's original backing band, "The Drifting Cowboys," play for
her whenever she performs, which she does with increasing frequency at state
fairs, nightclubs and charity events. She says Hank Williams fans seem
fascinated to see what she calls "the little more of him" that she represents.
</P>
<P>
The Adkinsons live on a restored house boat, "The Jett Stream," moored on the
Potomac in sight of the Washington Monument. Although her legal battles have
yet to bear financial fruit, she hopes she is on her way to becoming Jett
Williams, country star.
</P>
<P>
"They say my father was the king of country music, which makes my brother the
prince, the crowned prince," says Williams. "But I'm Cinderella, not that I
marry the prince but that my life is totally transformed into being the
princess.
</P>
<P>
"To be a celebrity in the United States is like being royalty. Fairyland is the
word you're looking for. For me, at this point in my life, it's happening. I
haven't gotten to that fairy land, totally, but it's happening."
</P>
<P>
For Hank Williams' baby, it has been a long, lonesome, mixed-up road to get
there.

   Will Smith keeps a chessboard handy on the
set of NBC's ``Fresh Prince of Bel Air.'' But like the character he
plays, what he'd really like is a pool table.
   Smith, a Grammy-winning rap singer known as Fresh Prince,
frequently plays chess when he's not working on his new NBC comedy
series. The show is his acting and television debut in the role of
a tough street kid from Philadelphia sent to live with wealthy
relatives in Bel Air.
   The comedy hinges on his attempts to adjust to the alien
environment of wealth and excess, and to bring his relatives back
in touch with their humbler roots.
   The 21-year-old Smith's frequent chess opponent is Joe Marcell,
who plays Geoffrey the butler as though he's just stepped out of
``Masterpiece Theatre.'' They've also had a game on an episode of
the comedy series.
   ``I play a lot of chess, but I don't know if I could say it's a
passion,'' Smith says. ``Pool is more of a passion with me. I put
in a request for a pool table on the set.''
   Smith sees a similarity between himself and his character, also
named Will Smith and nicknamed Fresh Prince. Smith also comes from
the Philadelphia area and says he prefers not to fit in.
   ``I've never done any acting,'' he says. ``I've never had any
formal theatrical training whatsoever. I'm playing a character I
designed five years ago for my rap concerts. It's pretty much a
part of me now.''
   Smith, like his character, is a person who smoothes the way with
incredible charm and an ability to think - and talk - fast. On the
screen he seems at ease and natural, although his lack of training
and experience occasionally surfaces in scenes with other cast
members.
   Prior to its premiere in September, NBC ballyhooed the show as
its breakaway hit of the seasn. As often happens to highly touted
young racehorses, it stumbled coming out of the gate. ABC's ``Cop
Rock'' stumbled even more so, as did ABC's ``Chicken Soup'' last
year.
   In the ratings for its first weeks ``Fresh Prince'' has been
barely ahead of its Monday night competition, CBS' ``Uncle Buck''
and ABC's ``McGyver,'' and trailing ABC's NFL Monday Night
Football.
   Part of the problem may be that the audience apparently is not
reacting well to Smith's making fun of middle-class values. As a
result, some of the sharper edges of the humor are being honed
down.
   ``Fresh Prince,'' like NBC's ``Ferris Bueller,'' which
immediately follows it, is part of television's trend of
youth-oriented comedies - replacing ``sitcom'' with ``punk-com.''
In such shows, including NBC's ``Hull High'' and Fox's ``Parker
Lewis Can't Loose,'' wisecracking kids outsmart slow-witted adults.
   Among those hoping that Smith's ``Fresh Prince'' recording and
stage performance success will transfer to a new audience is 20th
Century Fox, which recently signed him for an action-adventure
movie.
   Smith picked up the nickname Prince in school. It has nothing to
do with rock singer Prince.
   ``My eighth-grade teacher started calling me Prince and it sort
of stuck,'' he says. ``She did that because I was a pretty charming
guy. I had a couple of different names. I don't remember all of
them. When you're rapping you change your name every week trying to
find one that fits. Once I was Willie Will. I settled on Prince in
1986, then I added Fresh because that's the new slang for cool.
   ``I was performing rap at parties by 1981 and getting paid for
it. I always did rap. I play a little piano and guitar.''
   His rap partner was Jeff Townes, and by 1986 they had become
D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince. Their first single was ``Girls
Ain't Nothin' But Trouble,'' which they recorded on their own label
and sold nearly 200,000 copies in Pennsylvania, Delaware and New
Jersey. A major company picked it up and it became an international
hit.
   They've since recorded three albums, one of which sold 3 million
copies. A fourth album is due out next year.
   ``Fresh Prince is not very different from Will Smith,'' he says.
``He's fun-loving, mischievous and very handsome. He's just a sweet
fellow. It's me, not a character. It's just me, rapping or acting.
   ``Rap is the only real musical art form we have in America now,
other than jazz. You can listen to Elvis Presley and other stuff.
It's all stolen from black Americans. Elvis is nothing but bits of
Little Richard and Chuck Berry.
   ``Rap is more expressive and more individual. You have to write
your own material because rap comes from the heart. I'd never sing
anyone else's song.''
   Smith says the show is loosely based on the life of Benny
Medina, a record company executive who is a co-producer of the
series.
   ``He literally went from the streets to Beverly Hills High
School in the span of a weekend,'' Smith says of Medina, who
recommended that the ``Fresh Prince'' of rap music would be a
natural TV character.
   ``He saw my music video and never considered anyone else,''
Smith says.

   Steven Curtis Chapman, who has been
making records for just three years after giving up his ambition to
become a doctor, has been voted gospel music's artist of the year
and top male vocalist.
   He won the two top honors and three others Thursday night at the
Gospel Music Association's 21st annual Dove Awards presentations.
   ``My prayer and desire is to represent Christian music to honor
my peers and the one to whom we all sing for: our Lord, Jesus
Christ,'' he said after the show.
   The 27-year-old Chapman's other awards, presented during a live
broadcast on cable's The Nashville Network, were songwriter of the
year and songwriting honors for the tunes ``His Strength Is
Perfect'' and ``I Can See the Hands.''
   Sandi Patti, who has dominated gospel music awards for much of
the past decade, was chosen best female vocalist for the ninth
straight time. She also received a Dove trophy for ``The Friendship
Company,'' voted top children's music gospel album.
   ``It's a privilege to travel around the country and remind
people they are not losers in heaven's eyes,'' Miss Patti said
during the 90-minute ceremony at the Tennessee Performing Arts
Center.
   She had been voted top artist in 1987 and 1988 and was a
finalist this year in the category that Chapman won for the first
time.
   ``I'm so proud of Steven,'' she said about the rising Christian
music star whose No. 1 gospel hits include ``His Eyes'' and ``My
Turn Now.''
   The Winans, a brother-sister duo from a well-known gospel music
family in Detroit, won four awards to add to the two Grammy honors
they won in February in Los Angeles. The four awards: best group;
No. 1 contemporary black song for ``With My Whole Heart''; and top
contemporary album and best contemporary recorded song, both for
``Heaven.''
   ``The Lord has appointed us for this time,'' CeCe Winans, the
sister in the act, said about the duo's recent achievements.
   Amy Grant, a traditional big winner in gospel music, received
one award when her ``'Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus'' won for best
country-gospel song.
   The winners were chosen by the 3,000 members of the
Nashville-based gospel association, mostly singers, songwriters and
musicians.
   Actor Clifton Davis and Miss Patti were the show's hosts.
   The honors are called the Dove Awards to signify the bird
mentioned in the Bible.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS:
   From Suburb to Hayloft: Country Music's New Stars
   ----

   Her father worked in the higher reaches of Time-Life
Publications. She grew up in Tokyo and a fancy suburb of
Princeton, N.J. She trained at figure skating and went to
Brown University. So what's a nice girl like Mary-Chapin
Carpenter doing in country music?
   Very well, thank you, most of Nashville will answer. To
everyone's surprise, including her own, Ms. Carpenter is the
current darling of a music world once disdained by too many
other products of her Eastern Ivy League background. She
broke to the top of the country music charts without wearing
rhinestones or going Grand Ol' Opry. She works from
Washington, D.C., where her parents retired, and she writes
her own songs with a cosmopolitan flair marked by her own
foreign travels.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now 33 years old, Ms. Carpenter spent the years after
graduation paying her dues in D.C. bars, with occasional
forays on to the college and coffee-house circuit. The
5-foot-3 Ivy Leaguer startled her audiences with a rich alto
and commanding stage presence. For years she dominated the
Whammies, the annual awards of the Washington Area Music
Association.
   But her sudden success as a national country act still
makes her laugh in disbelief. Yet it reflects a significant
shift in the demographics of country music. Thanks to
post-World War II prosperity and social mobility, younger
country performers often sport college (and even
post-graduate) degrees, and they're making major inroads in
the upscale market.
   Over the last year, the bustling new generation in country
music has started to collect its commercial payoff. Country
radio jumped 8% in listener ratings last fall after years
with little change. Country artists pulled in seven of the
top 10 concert grosses reported in a recent issue of
Amusement Business. And when Billboard magazine changed its
sales charts in May to reflect more accurate data, the number
of country albums in the overall top 200 nearly doubled.
   The best-selling performers were largely newcomers in
their late 20s and early 30s, such as Garth Brooks, Clint
Black and Alan Jackson. The new generation belies the hayseed
stereotype that still dogs Nashville. Instead of farm boys
fresh off the bus, you'll find sophisticated
singer-song-writer-promoters like Lyle Lovett, with a degree
in journalism, or Holly Dunn, with a college major in
marketing. Even the impeccably rural Reba McEntire, who spent
her youth on her father's ranch and the rodeo circuit, went
on to college, where she studied classical violin and piano
and "analyzed Mozart every which way."
   Privileged backgrounds are no barrier either. The
country-rock band Restless Heart, a favorite of country
radio, was organized by a professor of accounting at
Vanderbilt University. (The professor, Tim DuBois, now runs
the Nashville office of Arista Records.) One of the brightest
new banjo players in bluegrass is a native of Stamford, Conn.
named Alison Brown, who earned degrees at Harvard and UCLA.
Ms. Brown worked for Smith Barney as an investment banker
before joining the Grammy-winning band Union Station.
   Identifying with these performers, the upscale college and
young professional audience is opening up to the rest of
country music as well. College radios have become bastions of
hard-core country music. American University's WAMU-FM caters
to Washington, D.C.'s, vigorous bluegrass scene. Militant
country fans in New York City rely on the sophisticated
student programmers at WKCR-FM (Columbia University) and
WFUV-FM (Fordham) for the harder-edged honky-tonk and
traditional styles spurned by the "soft-country" programmers
on commercial AM radio.
   Mary-Chapin Carpenter is one of Nashville's prime assets
in reaching this audience. Although she missed taking a
Grammy this year, another award at the same time underscored
her importance to the industry. The National Association of
Campus Activities voted her the top country performer in the
college market.
   Part of her appeal comes from her cosmopolitan writing,
which can evoke southern France as quickly as the American
South. Like many students, Ms. Carpenter bummed around Europe
with a guitar, and she doesn't hesitate to drop names like
Argeles, a small town near the Pyrenees. Even her rural
Americana has a literary edge. She drew her highly successful
"When Halley Came to Jackson," about the appearance of
Halley's Comet in Mississippi, from a line in the memoirs of
Eudora Welty.
   Beyond her music, Ms. Carpenter displays the guilt-ridden
drive of her overachieving generation. She copyrights her
songs under the corporate label "Getarealjob Music," a
private joke that she says reflects pressure from her peers,
not her parents. "When I was a senior," she says, "I did what
everyone else did. I went to the recruiting office and signed
up for the companies that were coming on campus. Of course, I
was your ultimate liberal arts junky. I bought a suit and I
went and I sat with these recruiters, and I think they saw
right through me. I was kind of unfocused."
   Worried about what she had to show for four years of
college and a major in American Studies, Ms. Carpenter went
home to Washington and started playing the club circuit she
had been working during her summer vacations. "In my mind,"
she said, "I imagined, `I can do this and scratch out an
earning until I figure out what I want to do.'"
   After several years, she nearly let her anxiety drive her
out of music. "There was a period of time," she said, "when I
really got sick of being a bar singer, and said, `I'm not
doing this anymore. I'm going to get a real job, get health
insurance and get a life for myself.'"
   It was her parents, Ms. Carpenter remembers warmly, who
talked her through her crisis. "They both said, are you sure?
The music means a lot to you." She attributes her success to
her middle-class, suburban parents, who rose at the crack of
dawn not to milk the cows, but to drive her to Princeton's
Baker Rink for her figure-skating lessons. "If I didn't have
parents who were supportive of the notion that if you want to
do something you should try it," she said, "I wouldn't be
sitting here talking to you today about my records."
   In a happy compromise, she landed a job with a small
research group in Washington called the Arca Foundation. Her
sympathetic boss gave her the flexibility to keep her gigs,
her musical appearances.
   In the meantime, she made a tape of her songs "to sell out
of my back pocket at gigs." One of her managers sent it
around to record companies and Rounder Records, a major
independent label, offered a contract. Two days before she
signed, a talent scout from CBS called and asked for a chance
to hear the tape. "He came up that night," she said. "We left
a copy at his hotel, and he listened to it, and the next day
he said, `Let's sign.'"
   Her first album, "Hometown Girl" came out in 1987 to warm
praise. Her second, the 1989 release "State of the Heart"
sealed her reputation as a rising star. It also brought her
the bookings that allowed her to quit her day job. Even with
her artistic success, she marvels, she has only been making a
full-time living from her music for the past year and a half.
   Since its release last year, her third album, "Shooting
Straight in the Dark," has been getting star treatment, with
extended videos in heavy rotation. But it was a still
unrecorded song that brought Ms. Carpenter the biggest
triumph of her career. She stunned and delighted an audience
of Nashville's heaviest heavyweights at last October's
televised Country Music Association Awards show when she
anxiously performed a sarcastic ditty called "You Don't Know
Me." About the travails of an opening act, the unknown artist
who warms up an audience for the headliner, the song struck a
nerve, even in its heavily edited television version. "I
don't have a hit on the Billboard charts," she sang. "I don't
have a limousine that stretches three blocks/ Ready to take
me from door to door. . . ."
   She had lunch the next day with Tammy Wynette and
discovered that even the biggest stars in Nashville kept
vivid memories of their opening days.
   Ms. Carpenter is just now launching her career as a
headliner. But she will be Nashville's favorite opening act
for some time to come.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The man who created gospel music is as obscure
as his music is popular. Thomas Dorsey is now 88 and bedridden in
his Chicago home. A handful of gospel devotees are working to build
a foundation that would preserve both his music and his memory.
</TEXT>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than half a century ago, Thomas Dorsey
crossed the raw soulfulness of the blues with the sacred music of
his youth to create a foot-stomping, soul-slapping sound that still
fills black churches.
   A personal conflict over his strict religious upbringing and
love of the bawdy, bluesy tunes inspired by slave songs led the
young jazz pianist to create what he called ``gospel'' music.
   Now 88, bedridden in his Chicago home and suffering from
Alzheimer's disease, Dorsey is in danger of dying in obscurity, his
legend unknown by a generation of worshippers who revere his music
but don't know his name.
   ``He was the person who gave blacks a medium to keep their
tradition alive,'' says Michael Harris, a professor of religion and
African American studies at Temple University in Philadelphia and
the author of a new biography on Dorsey.
   Black church music before Dorsey ``was very easygoing. It wasn't
upbeat, it wasn't filled with a lot of rhythmic tones,'' says Bob
Storman, a former gospel performer who with a handful of other
aficionados is working to build a Dorsey foundation in Chicago.
   ``It wasn't until the late '20s and '30s that a lot of ministers
would let that kind of music into their church,'' Storman says.
``The ministers figured that it was indecent and unreligious. For
them it was like some people react to acid rock music today.''
   Dorsey's song ``It's Tight Like That'' hit the top of the blues
charts about September 1928, Harris says. ``A number of people were
very shocked to see the type of music they danced to the night
before the next morning in church,'' he says.
   Dorsey's all-time greatest hit, ``Take My Hand, Precious Lord,''
was the favorite song of the Rev. Martin Luther King, and was
popularized by the late Mahalia Jackson, who once toured with
Dorsey. It has been translated into more than 50 languages.
   Dorsey's work includes more than 1,000 gospel tunes and all
would be displayed, his wife, Kathryn, said in an interview from
the couple's South Side home.
   ``I think he would think it was one of the greatest things that
ever happened,'' she said. ``It would be the only one in the United
States'' dedicated solely to Dorsey, she said.
   But efforts to raise a half-million dollars for the foundation
have faltered. A Chicago concert in December was to be the group's
first fund-raising event, but it was canceled for lack of interest.
   Storman says that while people know Dorsey's music, they don't
know Dorsey. They confuse him with Tommy Dorsey, the jazz
bandleader of the 1940s.
   In promoting Thomas Dorsey, Storman and colleagues have found
that ``people thought we were talking about the jazz artist. We had
to remind people that Tommy Dorsey had passed.'' Tommy Dorsey died
in 1956.
   Thomas Dorsey was born July 1, 1899, just outside Atlanta. His
father was sickly, and he, his mother and four siblings had to help
support the family.
   ``His mother was a very, very religious woman who had been a
profound influence on him,'' says Harris.
   ``He became enamored of a resident pianist at a local theater.
Then as a 12-year-old boy he started playing in bordellos, playing
piano, blues. By that time, he was supporting his family.''
   Dorsey later began composing blues and playing jazz and blues
piano. He adopted the stage name ``Georgia Tom.''
   He began experimenting with gospel music as a way to reconcile
an internal conflict over his religious upbringing and his early
love of blues, Harris says.
   As a young man, Dorsey moved to Chicago, and gradually began to
concentrate on composing gospel music.
   ``He was the first black man in America to publish gospel music,
in 1926,'' and started his own publishing firm at that time in
Chicago, Storman says.
   He sent his first two gospel songs, ``If You See My Saviour''
and ``How About You,'' to hundreds of churches. ``Not a single
person ordered one,'' Harris says.
   ``He spent time going from church to church trying to sell this.
The people thought it was blues, an inappropriate kind of music for
formal worship.''
   In 1931, Dorsey was devastated by the deaths of his first wife
and baby daughter in childbirth. ``That was when he wrote his
all-time great, `Take My Hand, Precious Lord,''' Storman says.
``And that was when he became totally dedicated to just doing
gospel.''
   In January 1932, at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Chicago, the Rev.
J. Howard Lorenzo Smith hired Dorsey to form a choir.
   A month later, at Pilgrim Baptist Church, the Rev. J.C. Austin
invited Smith to preach an anniversary service, Harris says. Smith
brought the choir and ``staid Pilgrim Baptist Church ... went
wild.''
   Two days later Austin offered Dorsey the job of directing his
church chorus.
   ``I was a little boy then,'' says the Rev. J.C. Austin Jr.,
Austin's son and the current minister. ``You couldn't get into the
church. The fire department came to keep the traffic moving ...
every Sunday morning.''
   Under Dorsey, the choir gained national attention, and he
remained its director until the late 1970s, when he retired.
   Dorsey, a tall, thin, distinguished-looking man, was shrewd in
his business dealings.
   ``He was self-taught, never went beyond third grade. But he took
this gospel thing and built his own publishing business out of
it,'' Harris says.
   Dorsey sold his business in the early 1950s to New York-based
Chapel Music, which has continued to publish his music, his
attorney Jay Ross says.
   Dorsey also knew how to create music that performers want to
sing.
   ``There's no comparison to him. He's in a class all by
himself,'' says gospel singer Albertina Walker.
   ``The songs that he wrote ... they have such a meaning, they
have such a message. People are forgetting Dorsey. But you really
can't forget him. He should be remembered as the father of gospel
music, the founder of gospel music.''

"I'm as American as apple pie," says Angel Ferreira, adding after a pause, "or
a burrito."
</P>
<P>
Born in the East Los Angeles barrio, a drug-addicted high school dropout at age
17, Ferreira is now a professional dancer, choreographer and recording artist.
His music video -- "Wet Jam," a hybrid of home-boy rap and "Singing in the
Rain" -- elicited bags full of adoring fan mail when it aired recently on the
Spanish-language cable TV program MTV Internacionale. And eight major record
companies have been trying to sign him up.
</P>
<P>
Ferreira, 27, represents the latest evolution in American pop music, one that
reflects the country's changing demographics and cultural mix.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Create New Market
</P>
<P>
Having grown up listening to Top 40 radio while hearing their parents and
grandparents speak Spanish at home, a generation of Latino kids is creating a
market for a new kind of pop music -- born in the U.S.A., but with roots in the
Caribbean and Central and South America. What is more, the record companies are
gearing up to serve this new market, figuring that millions of dollars can be
made there.
</P>
<P>
Since the success of the movie and sound track album "La Bamba" two years ago,
the American pop music charts have become populated by young Hispanic
performers -- Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine, Sa-fire, Lisa Lisa
and Cult Jam, Sweet Sensation, Expose and Martika. The latter is a 20-year-old
Cuban-American whose single, "Toy Soldiers," recently reached the top of
Billboard magazine's Hot 100 chart.
</P>
<P>
Linda Ronstadt's most recent album, "Canciones de mi Padre" (Songs of My
Father), sung entirely in Spanish, has sold more than 1 million copies. The
group Los Lobos followed the commercial success of their "La Bamba" sound track
with an album of traditional Mexican music. And the debut album by the Gipsy
Kings, a band of authentic Gypsies from Southern France who play flamenco-style
guitar and sing in an obscure French-Spanish dialect called Gitane, has been
the most surprising hit of 1989, selling more than 500,000 copies in this
country.
</P>
<P>
"It's suddenly becoming cool to like Latin music," said Jose Behar, vice
president of the Latin music division of Capitol-EMI Music.
</P>
<P>
"I think you are seeing the influence of the Hispanic community," said Luis
Pisterman, managing director of WEA Latina, the Latin music division of Warner
Communications' overseas record operations.
</P>
<P>
"We're right at the birth of a whole new evolution in music," said Edward Sax,
an American-born, Mexico City-based businessman who is pumping several million
dollars into two new Los Angeles-based companies, Outpost Records and Latin
Sound Network.
</P>
<P>
"Latin music is right where black music was just before Motown exploded in the
early 1960s," Sax said. "It's coming. It's in the kids' blood. And it's not
only happening here in Los Angeles but also in Texas, Chicago, Miami and New
York."
</P>
<P>
The major U.S. record companies have been expecting it to happen for some time.
They can read the census figures as well as anyone.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, the Latino population of the United States has increased from 14.6
million to an estimated 21 million, a growth rate of about 44%, six times
greater than that of the total population. In fact, the United States now ranks
as the fifth-largest "Hispanic country" in the world, trailing only Mexico,
Spain, Argentina and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
What is more, it is a young population -- 68% of Latino Americans are under 35;
their median age is 23. And they are rapidly becoming more affluent. The total
household income of Latino Americans is about $170 billion, which represents a
larger purchasing power than is possessed by the populations of Mexico, Central
America, Venezuela and Colombia combined.
</P>
<P>
"You can't ignore that market; every instinct says I have to be in it," said
Joe Smith, president of Capitol-EMI Music Inc., who has greatly expanded his
company's Latin music division in the last few years "because I want to be
there when it happens."
</P>
<P>
Smith said he "got a real lesson" recently when he took one of Capitol's Latin
artists, singer Daniella Romo, to dinner at trendy Spago restaurant. "The
people who work there are used to seeing all kinds of stars and they don't
react," he said. "But when she got out of the car in the parking lot, they all
went crazy. They came out of the woodwork asking for her autograph. So you know
it's there."
</P>
<P>
For the big record companies, the problem has always been getting a handle on
the Latino marketplace and making it profitable. Traditionally, the Latin music
business has been seen as divided into five primary markets -- California,
Texas, Chicago, Florida and New York/Puerto Rico -- individual "little
countries" with different and mutually exclusive musical tastes.
</P>
<P>
For example, in New York and Miami, where the Latino population is mostly of
Cuban, Puerto Rican or Dominican ancestry, the "tropical" Caribbean dance beat
of salsa and meringue is popular. In Texas, with its large Mexican-immigrant
population, the preferred sound is called Tejano, or Tex-Mex, a bouncy blend of
traditional Mexican and American country and Western music. The conventional
wisdom has always been that you can't give away Tex-Mex music in New York City
or Miami, and salsa won't play in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
This regional segmentation is one reason the big record companies have not
invested more heavily in the Latin music business before now, since it has
meant that no one record or performer would likely sell on a mass scale. There
has also been a perception that young Latinos won't listen to Latin music.
</P>
<P>
"The young Latin population is much more interested in American music," said
one record company president. "They're buying Bobby Brown and Madonna. They're
here to assimilate or they would have stayed in Guadalajara."
</P>
<P>
Others disagree. "The regional thing is breaking down," said Mike Missile, a
marketing executive for Bertelsmann Music Group, which operates RCA Records.
"This year, salsa is selling on the West Coast and in Texas. And in New York
City, some distributors report that over 50% of their business is Mexican.
</P>
<P>
"Those false barriers are starting to tumble," said Missile. "Now you can
market to the entire country."
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, the force of change has been the young people -- first-,
second- and third-generation Americans with a shared "bicultural," big-city
experience.
</P>
<P>
"They are not illegal aliens. They've lived here all their lives. They are not
going to return home; they are home," businessman Sax said. "They've grown up
rooting for the Dodgers and the Lakers and listening to American Top 40 radio.
So what you have is a burst of new music that is basically American in origin
-- it's from the streets -- but Latin in its ancestry. It's American rock 'n'
roll with a Hispanic flavor."
</P>
<P>
"The thing is, even if these kids speak English as their first language, they
are hearing Spanish at home," said Greta Nodar, vice president of the Los
Angeles-based advertising agency The Hispanic Group. "Yes, they are
assimilated, but their soul remains Hispanic. Their family does not let them
forget they're Hispanic."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Want Their Own Madonna'
</P>
<P>
"Sure, they're listening to Madonna and Prince, but they also want their own
Madonna," said WEA Latina's Luis Pisterman. "There has been a misconception
that the young people won't listen to Latin music."
</P>
<P>
In the past, the big American record companies have focused their energies on
signing up Spanish-speaking international stars such as Julio Iglesias, Jose
Jose and Emmanuel -- singers of romantic ballads whose appeal is mostly to the
over-40 Latino consumer. Now, however, the search is on for young, home-grown
heroes from the streets of Los Angeles, New York and Miami.
</P>
<P>
According to Barbara Corcoran, the producer of MTV Internacionale, the
up-and-coming Latino stars more accurately reflect the attitudes and concerns
of their peers in the audience.
</P>
<P>
"The lyrics to their songs have to do with what they are going though in these
big urban centers, not what they left behind in some other country. Sa-fire's
song, 'Thinking of You,' is about her uncle who died of AIDS in the Bronx. Her
real name is Wilma Cosme."
</P>
<P>
And the audience is responding with what appears to be pent-up enthusiasm. "We
hosted a dance at a Houston club with a group called Pajama Party, which is
what I call a Miami girl group," Corcoran said. "Usually, we expect about 600
people at these shows. But 4,000 kids showed up, and they went crazy!"
</P>
<P>
According to Corcoran and others, while most of the young Latino performers
currently on the pop charts sing in English, the audience is equally receptive
to Spanish. "I'll tell you something, we have done very well with Spanish
rock," she said. "We don't believe that the only good rock music is in English.
There's some great Latin rock 'n' roll. It has swept all of Central America.
Rock is very political, and Central America is a very politically charged place
right now."
</P>
<P>
"It's really happening," Corcoran said. "We haven't gotten that one huge global
artist yet, but there are lots of stories in the works."
</P>
<P>
The stories are Latino versions of chasing the rock 'n' roll dream:
</P>
<P>
"We're from Texas; 'La Bamba' made us move here," said Reuben Cruz, the leader
of a Tex-Mex rock band called the Street Boys that recently relocated to Los
Angeles in hopes of landing a recording contract.
</P>
<P>
According to Cruz, before seeing the movie, the four band members -- age 20 to
27 -- were unfamiliar with the story of Richie Valens, the East Los Angeles
barrio kid who changed his name from Valenzuela and reached the top of the pop
music charts with "La Bamba" and "Donna" before dying in a plane crash in 1959
at the age of 17.
</P>
<P>
Although the Street Boys play rock, their musical influences include childhood
memories of "parties at our houses when we heard our parents' music," Cruz
said. "It was so lively and you saw the whole family dancing together when they
put that music on; it's very inspiring. Our music has that Latin feeling."
</P>
<P>
"We sing about our experiences," he said. "Our song 'Door of Glory' is about
leaving home, and how hard it is to step through that door of glory to find
what it is you're looking for, whether it's in a different city, state or
country. That's what we're doing."
</P>
<P>
At hard rock clubs such as Madam Wong's in West Los Angeles, the Street Boys
take the stage with Mexican flags emblazoned on their jackets. "We're not
embarrassed at being Mexican-Americans," Cruz said. "We're definitely proud of
it."
</P>
<P>
It took Austin-based singer-songwriter Tish Hinajosa nine years to land a
recording contract with a major record company. "No one knew how to market me.
I always wore my Hispanic heritage; it's a big part of my performing and
writing," said the 33-year-old mother of two whose debut album, "Homeland," was
just released by A&amp;M Records.
</P>
<P>
Born in San Antonio, the youngest of 13 children of Mexican immigrant parents,
Hinajosa's music -- like her name -- reflects the almost schizophrenic
experience of one who was "raised listening to the Beatles and hearing Spanish
being spoken at home."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wanted to Be American
</P>
<P>
Growing up, "everyone wanted to be so American. We were supposed to grow out of
the Hispanic culture. We had to prove that we were American. We were not
encouraged to be Hispanic. We had Hispanic surnames but only spoke English."
</P>
<P>
Three songs on her new album are sung entirely in Spanish, and several others
contain Spanish verses. They tell of life on both sides of the border:
</P>
<P>
 Joaquin loves his homeland, but it can't give him enough.
</P>
<P>
 He wants a good life, a job and a wife
</P>
<P>
 and some children with dreams that come true.
</P>
<P>
One song is clearly autobiographical, about Felipe and Maria, who crossed the
Rio Grande to raise a family of 13 on the west side of San Antonio:
</P>
<P>
 Days were good and days were bad,
</P>
<P>
 but mostly they were lean.
</P>
<P>
 School and shoes and food and books
</P>
<P>
 believin' in a prayer. . . .
</P>
<P>
 They were pilgrims that made
</P>
<P>
 a good life the hard way.
</P>
<P>
"The message I want to get across to younger Hispanic-Americans is that it's OK
to be part of both cultures," Hinajosa said.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most remarkable story of all is that of Angel Ferreira, whose
ticket out of poverty and drugs in East L.A. was a scholarship to the famed
Joffrey Ballet in New York City. From there he landed a role in the movie, "A
Chorus Line," and wound up as the principal dancer on Madonna's 1987 world
concert tour.
</P>
<P>
Now a resident of Los Angeles again, Ferreira has carved a niche for himself as
a choreographer of music videos, working with such groups as Pretty Poison and
Milli Vanilli. His own heroes range from soul singer James Brown to Fred
Astaire and Gene Kelly. And he admits that he was stunned by the thousands of
fan letters responding to his "Wet Jam" video on MTV Internacionale.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't 'I think you're cute, marry me' stuff. It was more 'I think you are
a great representative of our culture. You made me proud.' It obviously
inspired them," he said, slipping into the vernacular of his barrio roots.
"They're saying, 'Hey, this brother came from the neighborhood. Check it out;
he's really cutting it up.' "

A BREATH OF FRESH PRINCE;
</P>
<P>
WHY NBC HAS HIGH HOPES ON A RAPPER FROM PHILADELPHIA
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Daniel Cerone, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Will Smith, a 21-year-old rapper known as the Fresh Prince, just got a job with
NBC. His job expectations, as implied by his boss, NBC Entertainment President
Brandon Tartikoff, are threefold:
</P>
<P>
* To bring the black street world of hip-hop to American TV audiences.
</P>
<P>
* To star in a sitcom bearing his name that will be the network's first
"hit-the-ground running hit" since "The Golden Girls" five years ago.
</P>
<P>
* To be a "big, breakout star" along the lines of, oh, say Eddie Murphy.
</P>
<P>
"Brandon Tartikoff is making me nervous, comparing me to Eddie Murphy and stuff
like that," Smith said after Tartikoff made the comments.
</P>
<P>
"Hey, hey, slow down a little bit." He chuckled. "Let me practice first. This
has all happened so fast my head's spinning a little bit."
</P>
<P>
Smith sounded exhausted, speaking on a telephone from a hotel room in
Washington, D.C., where he was meeting affiliates to promote his new fall show,
"The Fresh Prince of Bel Air."
</P>
<P>
The sitcom is backed by first-time TV producer Quincy Jones. It's about a funky
byproduct of Philadelphia's gang-infested streets who is sent out West to live
with his wealthy upper-crust cousins, whose plush lifestyle has buried their
black roots.
</P>
<P>
Smith quickly points out that the sitcom is not about rapping. It took me a
while to make NBC understand-and they understand now- they don't want rap. They
think they want rap performers, but no. What they want is a hip show.
</P>
<P>
"Rap music-which a lot of white America doesn't understand-rap music is not
just a music. Rap music is a subculture: hip-hop. It's a style of dress, an
attitude, a look, a language. It's more than just music.
</P>
<P>
For a middle-class kid from Philadelphia who never acted before, Smith is being
asked to shoulder a load that might wobble the knees of Murphy himself. He's
network televisson's first embodiment of a fresh generation. He's a prime-time
tap into the urban street market, which is pumping rap music, loud new fashions
and an Afrocentric political consciousness into mainstream society faster than
the booming bass tracks of a def jam.
</P>
<P>
Warren Littlefield, Tartikoff's right-man hand at NBC, said the network had
been searching for a way to catch the wild rap tiger by the tail for some time.
</P>
<P>
"We were all looking at Newsweek and Time and seeing these cover stories (about
rap music)," he explained. "I was personally watching 'Yo! MTV Raps' and just
feeling waves of something new and contemporary running through various streams
of culture in America. We felt there was a drum beat going on out there, and we
looked at our development (schedule) and said, 'It's not represented.' "
</P>
<P>
Smith, one-half of D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince, endeared himself to
kids everywhere in 1988 with the sympathetic rap hit "Parents Just Don't
Understand," about a shopping trip he takes with his mother for back-to-school
clothes. Although the duo's record sales have slipped since then, the
bubble-gum rappers are still hopping. Their 900-number hotline, which will be
used to promote an upcoming album, has set a music industry precedent by
grossing a reported $10 million since its debut two years ago.
</P>
<P>
"I think Will's a star," said Jones, a celebrated music producer/composer with
19 Grammys to his credit. "He really makes it pop. He's got this magical sense
of timing that's unbelievable. Right now he's not even thinking about it; he's
just doing his own thing. He's going to be dangerous when he finds out where
the cameras are."
</P>
<P>
The real-life inspiration for "Fresh Prince" came from co-producer Benny
Medina. "It was partially based upon the way I was brought up, a juxtaposition
I was thrown into at an early age," Medina said. "I came from a broken home in
Watts, and I was in and out of juvenile detention facilities and foster homes."
</P>
<P>
Medina was living at St. Elmo Village, a Los Angeles community home center,
when Jack Elliot, a white TV film composer living in Beverly Hills with a wife
and three kids, decided to give Medina a chance. "They let me move in with
them," he said. "I fixed up their garage in the back of the house and became
part of the family. The deal was I had to keep a job, keep the grades up and be
respectful of household rules."
</P>
<P>
Medina wound up at Beverly Hills High School with the children of Motown
kingpin Barry Gordy and eventually started working for Gordy as a junior
executive at Motown. Today, Medina is head of black music at Warner Bros. When
he and partner Jeff Pollack recently began developing TV projects, including an
animated series that may go to Fox called "Hip-Hop Junior High," Medina
instantly thought back to his childhood.
</P>
<P>
"One problem I found growing up in a ghetto (is) you have a very limited
perspective of what you think the world is. Moving from one extreme to the
other gave me a real clear picture of how people get held back on the basis of
their situation.
</P>
<P>
"We adjusted the premise of the sitcom to fit Will. My upbringing didn't have
much comedy in it. Most of the kids I grew up with, if they're still alive,
they're in Watts right now. Four of the six cats I grew up with are dead. I'm
30."
</P>
<P>
Medina met Smith in December at "The Arsenio Hall Show," which was celebrating
Jones' acclaimed comeback album "Back on the Block," when Smith asked Medina
for directions to a Lakers game. Soon after, Pollack began hearing second-hand
raves about Smith after the rapper's performance on Disney's 35th anniversary
TV special for NBC. Director John Landis cast Smith in the special based on his
energetic performance in the music video for "Parents Just Don't Understand."
</P>
<P>
"Disney wanted to do a musical number," Landis said, Rand they gave me a list
of the same old boring names and said, 'Choose one.' I said, 'Gee, the Disney
song catalogue is so marvelous, let's get somebody fresh.' I suggested Fresh
Prince and D.J. Jazzy Jeff, and Disney basically said, 'Who? What?'
</P>
<P>
"But you should have heard them. They rapped 'Supercalifragilistic.' " Landis
broke into a brief rap-'Let's take an umdiddly break...' -and started laughing.
"I was raving about them."
</P>
<P>
Medina and Pollack contacted Smith, who joined the project immediately. "It was
real," Smith said. "That's what everyone's missing on TV. You've probably seen
that Tide commercial where the kid stands up on the washing machine and starts
rapping, 'Mom my clothes are dirty/Gotta get some Tide/Go get some.' America
needs to see that there are intelligent, articulate black people, and what
better place to see them than on television?"
</P>
<P>
The producers took their idea to -uincy Jones, who they knew was in meetings
with NBC to develop TV projects. "I'm not a big fan of TV at all," said Jones,
who is also working on a syndicated talk show with Jesse Jackson. "But blacks
have been repressed on TV for so long. When I was young, there was nothing on
the radio for blacks. It was like black people didn't exist.
</P>
<P>
"Now there's such a vibrant new culture, in all its different hues, that has
never been dealt with before. Everyone always thought of blacks in a
sharecropper situation. A white person isolated in Iowa sees blacks on the TV
set and thinks that's what black people are like, and they're always wrong. I
want to change that."
</P>
<P>
"Quincy understands rap music," Smith said. "You know, he was pretty much there
for the past 30 years of music. His input is valuable, because he understands,
where someone else, you know, his age, wouldn't. Whereas I can't communicate
what I'm trying to say to an executive, or someone I can't explain what hip is
to- they think hip is rap music-Quincy can. He's a good mediator."
</P>
<P>
"Fresh Prince" was in line with NBC's fall goal of more youth-oriented
programming. But by this time it was mid-March-late to get a new fall show
going-and there was no script, no cast and no Fresh Prince. Their future star
was in Indiana on a concert tour.
</P>
<P>
NBC wanted to see Smith "now" to find out if he could act. So Smith traveled 17
hours straight by bus and plane to make it to Los Angeles. A screen test was
arranged at Jones' home on his 57th birthday, the same night he received a
lifetime achievement award from "Soul Train."
</P>
<P>
"I went straight home from the show," Jones said. "It was about 10 p.m., and 20
NBC cars were lined up at my house. They all wanted to see Fresh Prince."
</P>
<P>
Smith emerged from an upstairs bedroom where he was studying a scene from an
old sitcom pilot that was developed for singer Morris Day. NBC's Littlefield
described the scene: "You gotta know, if you're a network programmer and it's
late in the pilot season game and you're looking for a hit show, my heart
starts to pound at this point. Will says, 'OK, so I'm just going to, like, read
this scene, huh? Now, who are the guys from the network?'
</P>
<P>
"Then he did a couple of little scenes from this failed sitcom script, and he
just hit it. If he's a ball player, he hit a home run. We stood up, hugged him.
I kissed Quincy and said, 'Thank you. Let's go to work.' "
</P>
<P>
NBC brought in veteran writers Andy and Susan Borowitz to write the pilot (he
was co-creator, executive producer and head writer of "Day by Day" and she was
producer and writer for "Family Ties"). Smith was given the freedom to adapt
his dialogue to suit his hip-hop lingo. Tartikoff even got in on the act,
writing two jokes for the pilot.
</P>
<P>
Littlefield said the pilot tested at record-breaking levels with kids and
teens, better than "The Cosby Show" did. NBC ordered 12 episodes to premiere in
September on Monday nights.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's rare in television or in film to find an actor and a character
who leaps out at you," Littlefield said. "As broadcasters we've been saying to
ourselves for years, "Where's the next Eddie Murphy?" What we found with Will
is someone unique and distinctive unto himself. We took a contemporary musical
artist and crafted a character who is a perfect fit. In no way is this an
effort to put a rap show on the air. This is an effort to put Will Smith on the
air. That's who we're banking on."

   Twenty years ago last month, ``Hair'' brought
the Age of Aquarius to Broadway and the American musical theater
was never quite the same.
   The show, with its contemporary sound and free-wheeling, almost
non-existent book, ran for more than 1,700 performances, spawning
countless touring and foreign companies as well as a successful
movie. Now it is back in New York for one night only, this time in
a unique concert version at the United Nations that will be a
benefit for children with AIDS.
   The concert, to be held May 26 at the U.N. General Assembly
Hall, will reunite the musical's creators _ James Rado, Jerome
Ragni and Galt MacDermot _ as well as many performers who appeared
in various companies of ``Hair'' or the film version.
   The ``Hair'' alumni include Melba Moore, Paul Jabara, Heather
MacRae, Treat Williams, Nell Carter, Andre De Shields and Donna
Summer. Among the other performers scheduled to appear are Bea
Arthur, Frank Stallone, Jay Leno, Rex Smith and Chuck Mangione as
well as a large cast of young, unknown singers.
   ``After 20 years, the anniversary came up and we said, `What are
we doing to do with it?''' Ragni said the other day. ``People told
us to do a big reunion of `Hair' kids and make it just a `Hair'
celebration. We didn't want to do that. In a way, `Hair' was always
used as a rallying point.''
   They found a new rallying point in the plight of children with
AIDS and the money raised from the concert _ ticket prices are
scaled from $250 to $5,000 _ will go to the United States Committee
for UNICEF and the Creo Society's Fund for Children with AIDS.
   ``Hair'' was the most influential of the rock musicals that hit
Broadway and off-Broadway during the late 1960s and early '70s.
More than any other rock show, it integrated te pop music sound of
the day into the Broadway musical.
   Tim Rice, lyricist for such ``Hair''-inspired musicals as
``Jesus Christ Superstar'' and ``Evita,'' calls it ``one of the
best Broadway scores ever written.''
   ``Hair'' was also one of the most popular. It spawned four top
four singles on the American pop record charts. Each was sung by a
different artist. Incredibly, one song got to the No. 1 spot,
``Aquarius,'' by the Fifth Dimension; another to No. 2, ``Hair,''
sung by the Cowsills; a third to No. 3, ``Good Morning,
Starshine,'' by Oliver; and a fourth to No. 4, ``Easy to Be Hard,''
by Three Dog Night.
   The musical first opened in New York off-Broadway in October
1967 at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater. The
following April it was remounted, recast and redirected and moved
to Broadway's Biltmore Theater.
   Rado and Ragni were in the cast. Rado played a young man named
Claude who was about to be drafted and spends his remaining free
hours with a tribe of first-spirited individuals on the outskirts
of conventional society.
   When the show is done today _ and it still has revivals around
the country _ it's done as a period piece, Rado says.
   ``There's nothing from that era that really showed what went on
with the hippie movement, what that time was about,'' Ragni said.
``It touched on the anti-war movement, racism, the ecology movement
and a lot of other things. All this was going on at the same time.''
   The title of the concert is ``Hair . . . For The Next
Generation,'' and for the show, the trio has composed 18 new songs
including several with such titles as ``Plant Love,'' ``Ozone'' and
``Sweet American'' that sound like they will fit right into the
show. Twelve of the new numbers will be used in the concert as well
as most of the original songs.
   ``We thought, `What would ``Hair'' be like now?' So we wrote
those kinds of songs,'' said Ragni. ``What's the difference between
now and then?''
   The children of today are ready to embrace this show again, its
creators say, and the concert may be the first step toward a new
edition of the show that may play the West Coast and work its way
east.
   ``There is such a revival of the '60s going on right now,''
Ragni said. ```What was that era about?, a lot of them are asking.''
   ``These kids are wondering what their parents were like or what
the kids in those days were like,'' said Rado. ``This show still
gives them a good idea.''

<P>
Need a reason to smile?
</P>
<P>
Just think: No more political commercials!
</P>
<P>
Election-night glamour was in particularly short supply at the Democrats' local
command base, the Biltmore Hotel.
</P>
<P>
The highest-ranking candidate to visit, attorney general hopeful Arlo Smith,
left at 8 p.m. Hollywood types were also scarce, though Smith was collared in
the lobby by a rap singer who crooned the following ditty:
</P>
<P>
The A to the R to the L to the O.
</P>
<P>
 I went to the polls and voted like so.
</P>
<P>
 The man on the ballot, well don't ya know.
</P>
<P>
 For attorney general, his name was Ar-lo.
</P>
<P>
 So I'm gonna make a rap and it goes like so:
</P>
<P>
 I love this tie, it's burgundy.
</P>
<P>
At that point, the rapper put his arm around the startled, 63-year-old Smith
and lifted his tie. The singer gave his name as Casanova Ace and said he was
originally of New York but now of Paramount (the city, not the studio).
</P>
<P>
Somehow, mention of an Arlo Smith rap song reminds us that the Doo Dah Parade
is approaching. And KCOP (Channel 13) is terming itself the only TV station
"with the guts to bring it to you." The 15th edition of the zany procession
will be televised live for the first time on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
Doo Dah czar Peter Apanel's strategy is obvious. With turnouts growing so large
in recent years, Apanel -- in the contrary tradition of the Rose Parade parody
-- has begun pleading with people not to attend.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, he even recorded a message on his telephone that said: "You
can't find a place to park. It won't be any fun. It's gonna be too crowded."
Several alarmed people phoned the city, thinking it had been canceled, and
Apanel was chewed out by Pasadena police.
</P>
<P>
So now he's adopted a new ruse. His hope: People will stay home and catch it on
TV.
</P>
<P>
And here's an event that sounds like a Doo-Dah joke:
</P>
<P>
The L.A. Business Council will host a speech today at noon on "The Outlook for
Real Estate in the 1990s," given by real estate agent Mike Glickman.
</P>
<P>
Yes, the same Mike Glickman whose lavish operation collapsed earlier this year,
forcing him to file for bankruptcy. Perhaps some of his 157 creditors will want
to listen to his pearls of wisdom.
</P>

be the oldest continuously open parking operation in the city.

   Actress Jaclyn Smith says television has treated
her better than the silver screen.
   ``I've been offered Hollywood parts, but they were as an
`armpiece' or decoration. Or there was nudity,'' the ex-Charlie's
Angel says in this Sunday's Parade magazine.
   ``And they were just not as good as the parts I get in
television.''
   Smith, 42, admits she's happy working in TV, although Broadway
could lure her from the tube.
   ``Broadway ... now that would be something else. I'd love to do
a stage musical,'' she said.
   Smith, who has appeared in several television movies and
miniseries, stars in the NBC movie, ``Danielle Steel's
Kaleidoscope,'' later this month.

   LAS VEGAS (AP) - Phyllis McGuire of the McGuire Sisters says
there's something about diamonds that make you smile.
   McGuire, 59, who says her jewelry collection is one of the
largest in the nation, put part of it on display Wednesday for the
first time at a jewelry store near the strip, as a favor for friend
and shop owner Wayne Christensen.
   ``No two stones are alike,'' said McGuire, pointing to a canary
yellow 42-carat diamond ring she was wearing and one in a display
case. ``Each have their own personality.''
   McGuire, who keeps expensive pieces in Las Vegas and New York
bank vaults, declined to reveal their value, saying only that it
was ``in the millions.'' She and sisters Christine and Dorothy
amassed a slew of gold records in the 1950s and '60s as one of
America's hottest trios before splitting up in 1968. They returned
to the stage five years ago.
   McGuire also is known for her relationship with mobster Sam
Giancana, who was slain gangland style in Chicago. She says she's
writing a book about their time together.

   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) - Gene Autry, owner of the California
Angels since the baseball team's founding in 1961, has passed on
the duties of club president so he can devote more time to his
Western Heritage Museum in Los Angeles.
   Autry, who turned 83 last Saturday, said Thursday the move
represents a withdrawal from the daily demands of the team's
affairs.
   ``It just got to be too much for me,'' the former movie cowboy
said at an Anaheim Stadium news conference. ``I've been so involved
with other things. I'll no longer have to take phone calls every
day about the team.''
   Named as Autry's successor was Richard M. Brown, an attorney who
has represented Autry's broadcasting empire since 1981 and has sat
on the Angels' board of directors since 1986.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Rapper Will Smith, better known as The Fresh
Prince, says he may have grown up too fast.
   ``I started my music career at 16, moved out of the house when I
was 18 - got my own house, had a car and was worrying about having
my taxes done when other kids were going to the prom,'' Smith said.
   Smith, 22, who now stars in NBC's ``Fresh Prince of Bel Air,''
said in this Sunday's Parade magazine he's now making up for his
lost teen years.
   ``It would have been nice to have a few more years just hanging
out. So I'm indulging my young tendencies now,'' he said. ``I just
bought my Nintendo yesterday, and I have it set up in the living
room.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - ``Saturday Night Live'' regular Kevin Nealon
took custody of three monkeys abandoned by a Soviet circus that
went bankrupt during a U.S. tour.
   Nealon said Wednesday the Bim Bom circus left the monkeys behind
because of ``behavioral problems.''
   ``They looked like there was no fight left in them. They looked
angry and upset and helpless. It made you want to cry,'' said
Nealon's wife, Linda.
   The couple, who took custody of the monkeys on behalf of People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said they hoped to return
them to the wild, where they would not be subjected to trainers'
discipline.
   The last of the original 115-member circus returned to the
Soviet Union on Aug. 23.

   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - Percussionist Alvin Patterson of
the Jamaican reggae group The Wailers, formerly led by Bob Marley,
is recovering in Brazil after undergoing surgery following a
stroke.
   ``Alvin was moved out of intensive care today,'' Sallim Emed,
director of the Cajuru Hospital in Curitiba, said Thursday. ''The
surgery was successful nd there were no complications.''
   Patterson suffered the stroke Sunday shortly before a scheduled
concert in Curitiba, a city 1,500 miles southwest of Rio. The
operation was performed Tuesday morning.
   The Wailers, one of Jamaica's most popular reggae bands, were in
Brazil for a series of concerts. Marley died in 1981 at age 36 from
brain cancer.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Singer Garth Brooks has been named one
of the regular performers on the Grand Ole Opry country music show.
   Brooks, 28, will be the youngest of the more than 60-member cast
when he debuts Saturday night.
   Brooks also is a finalist for five Country Music Association
awards that will be presented Monday night during a nationally
televised broadcast.
   He has been nominated for male vocalist of the year, music video
of the year for ``The Dance,'' the Horizon Award for a promising
performer and single and song of the year, both for ``If Tomorrow
Never Comes.''

President Bush today named 27 citizens, including medical pioneer Dr. Jonas
Salk, former Atty. Gen. William French Smith and ex-Dallas Cowboys Coach Tom
Landry, as advisers for the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
"All share my goal of ridding America of illegal drugs," Bush said at a White
House ceremony where he signed an executive order creating the Presidential
Drug Advisory Council.
</P>
<P>
With drug policy director William J. Bennett at his side, Bush gave the
advisory panel the mission of finding better ways to:
</P>
<P>
 -- Encourage employers to keep workplaces drug-free.
</P>
<P>
 -- Enlist the aid "of many Americans who want to volunteer their time and
energy to winning the war on drugs."
</P>
<P>
 -- "Communicate to all Americans, especially our young, the importance of
staying off drugs."
</P>
<P>
 -- Coordinate the multitude of private and nonprofit anti-drug efforts.
</P>
<P>
 -- Involve the private sector in the building of prisons and jails.
</P>
<P>
Bush, who in September unveiled an anti-drug strategy that will cost nearly $8
billion, said, "The scourge of illegal drugs upon the lives of many Americans
is simply devastating, and with the help of this advisory council, I look
forward to stopping this devastation and guiding our nation toward an
intolerance of illegal drug use."
</P>

   Twenty years ago last month, ``Hair'' brought

   Mark David Chapman says that he feels great
remorse for killing John Lennon but that the slaying doesn't make
him an evil person.
   ``You can't judge a man's life by one act. Before I became `The
man who murdered John Lennon,' I was basically a decent person,''
Chapman said from his isolation cell at Attica state prison, where
he is serving 20 years to life.
   In the interview in Sunday's Rochester Democrat and Chronicle,
Chapman said he suffered mental dissolution for years before
killing the former Beatle on Dec. 8, 1980 outside Lennon's
apartment building in New York City.
   ``I'm not an evil person,'' said Chapman. ``Like everybody,
there's a small part within me that's evil, and that's what took
over in my case. My energies turned foul and went toward something
destructive.''
   Chapman said he looks upon Lennon as ``a seeker of truth.''
   ``It was an end of innocence for that time,'' Chapman said.
``And I regret being the one that ended it.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Whoopi Goldberg was named black Entertainer
of the Year and won best supporting actress honors for her role in
``Ghost'' at the NAACP Image Awards.
   Morgan Freeman won best film actor for his role as a chauffeur
in ``Driving Miss Daisy'' Saturday night at the 23rd annual awards
honoring black achievement.
   No award was given this year for best female actress because of
the paucity of roles for black women, the NAACP said. It said the
lack of nominees was a sign of ``the imbalance and irresponsibility
of the film industry.''
   In the music category, Quincy Jones won the best album award for
``Back on the Block,'' and Luther Vandross received best male
recording artist honors.
   Best vocal group honors went to the Whispers for their album
``More of the Night,'' and Etta James won best blues artist for her
singing on ``Stickin' to My Guns.'' Best jazz artist was Jonathan
Butler for ``Deliverance.''
   Best rap group was M.C. Hammer for ``Please Hammer Don't Hurt
'Em.'' Anita Baker won best female artist for ``Compositions,'' and
the Winans were named best gospel artists for ``Return.''
   The show will be televised Jan. 16 on NBC.

   LOS ALAMITOS, Calif. (AP) - Burt Lancaster remained in serious
condition from a stroke that left him weak on his right side and
affected his speech.
   Lancaster was resting Sunday at Los Alamitos Medical Center,
where nursing supervisor Ardi Smith said the 77-year-old actor's
condition was ``basically unchanged.''
   Lancaster, who has starred in more than 60 movies and won an
Oscar in 1960 for his portrayal of an evangelist in ``Elmer
Gantry,'' had been listed in serious condition Friday, when he
collapsed and was taken to the hospital.
   ``He's having some difficulty with speech,'' Smith said. ``But
at the request of the family, I'm not able to say more than that.''

   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) - Kenneth Branagh was named Actor of the
Year for his role in ``Henry V'' at the Felix Awards, the European
version of the Oscars.
   The film Sunday also received the Young European Film of the
Year award.
   The Italian film ``Porte Aperte'' was named European Film of the
Year, and Spanish actress Carmen Maura was named top actress for
her role in the Spanish film ``Ay Carmela.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - Robin Leach of ``Lifestyles of the Rich and
Famous'' says he knows people are laughing at him, but so what?
   ``I've become Robin Leach the cartoon character,'' Leach said in
Sunday's The New York Times. ``But the cartoon character, that's
not who Robin Leach is. And when I wake up in the morning, I wink
at myself because I like me. I know who I am.''
   ``Lifestyles,'' now in its eighth year, is carried on 168
American stations and in 22 overseas markets.

   RADNOR, Pa. (AP) - Ed Begley Jr., the father in television's
``Parenthood,'' says when he applied for his driver's license at 16
he learned who his real mother was from his birth certificate.
   Begley, now 41, said in the Dec. 8 issue of TV Guide it took him
some time to adjust to the fact his father's first wife was not his
mother, as he had assumed.
   ``It's pretty strange when you think one woman is your mother
and you find out it's another woman,'' he said. ``That lady who
used to bring you Lincoln Logs? Yeah, I remember her. Well, for
good reason, son. That's your mom.''
   Begley said he gets along great with his mother, whom he knew as
a family friend during his childhood.
   The name of the woman, an NBC page and part-time actress, was
not revealed.

   The amount of money raised in the fourth annual Caring for
Babies With AIDS on Sunday was not immediately available.
   Arnaz, the daughter of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, stars as
Tess Hammersmith, a single professional woman raising an adopted
daughter and coping with an extended family this season in the CBS
series ``Sons and Daughters.''
   Luckinbill is working on a Broadway musical about the
rags-to-riches life of Desi Arnaz.

   RADNOR, Pa. (AP) - ``Guest star to the world'' is how Jay
Thomas, the abrasive tbloid-TV host Jerry Gold on ``Murphy
Brown,'' describes his career.
   ``It's almost like I have this fit for three hours every morning
- and then go to work,'' Thomas said in the Dec. 8 issue of TV
Guide.
   Los Angeles radio listeners know Thomas as ``The Morning Zoo''
host on radio station KPWR-FM. On his weekday ``nothing is sacred''
show, he trashes everything, including his Emmy nomination for
``Murphy Brown.''
   Then it's off to the set of his current show - ``Married
People'' - as Russell Meyers, a yuppie writer and househusband.
Thomas also plays hockey goalie Eddie LeBec on ``Cheers'' and was
deli owner Remo DaVinci on ``Mork &amp; Mindy.''

ON THE ROAD TO STARDOM -- AND LOVIN' IT;
</P>
<P>
THIS 25-YEAR-OLD SINGER FROM SANTA ANA WITH THE FASHION MODEL'S FACE AND
STREET-DANCER'S MOVES MIGHT BE THE NEXT BIG THING
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Greenberg, president of WTG Records, found himself in a Philadelphia
warehouse a few weeks ago, watching his prize rookie in action.
</P>
<P>
Louie Cordero, the Santa Ana-based singer whose stage name, Louie Louie, was
pinned on him during his days as a teen-age dancing flash in Orange County
nightclubs, was singing to a crowd of warehouse employees, youngsters whose job
it is to pack shipping crates full of records destined for retail shops. What
Greenberg heard was music to a record executive's ears.
</P>
<P>
"They were screaming by the time he was through," Greenberg recalled over the
phone from his Los Angeles office. "One girl yelled out, 'I'M going to throw
out my Bobby Brown records! From now on, Louie, you it.' "
</P>
<P>
The scene underscored what Greenberg and others at CBS Records (WTG's parent
company) suspect about this 25-year-old singer with the fashion model's face,
athlete's physique, street-dancer's moves, and -- in a genre where many a
success story is all window-dressing and no substance -- the ability to write
snappy songs an dsing them with authority. Louie Louie just might be it.
</P>
<P>
"The Latin world has never had an Elvis, a Prince, one of those totally unique
artists," said Bobby Colomby, the former Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears drummer who,
as a CBS Records executive, has served as Louie Louie's coach and mentor. "This
may be it. He may be the guy."
</P>
<P>
While Louie Louie's just released debut album, "The State I'm In", won't
challenge early Elvis or prime Prince on anyone's list of groundbreaking
records, it is state-of-the-art dance pop that might well induce the fans of a
star like Bobby Brown to set their favorite albums aside (if not throw them
out) and give this part-Puerto Rican, part-Irish contender a spin.
</P>
<P>
What they will hear is a record that incorporates rock, funk, rap and Latin
music while painting story-sketches of love and sex that manage to go beyond
the deadening cliches of much dance music. The early signs are that Louie will
get more than a fair hearing: An initial shipment of more than 100,000 copies
of the album has been sent to record stores, according to Greenberg, and the
single, "Sittin' in the Lap of Luxury," which featuers trumpet flourishes from
Dizzy Gillespie, is being added rapidly to radio play lists.
</P>
<P>
As for Louie, he doesn't appear to have been caught off balance by the touting
of highly placed backers or the onset of great commercial expectations. Far
from falling into the spotlight, Louie has been courting stardom all along. It
is what he has pursued for the past six years -- deliberately, aggressively,
and in the face of setbacks.
</P>
<P>
"He's a person who walks in the room, and every head turns," Colomby says, his
I-love-Louie rap slipping into high gear. "There are a lot of attractive people
out there. He has an intrinsic charisma that's magical, and he's a good kid.
He's not one of these maniacal people who spends his life trying to think of
how he can step over other people to make it."
</P>
<P>
In person, Louie Cordero turns out to be one of those people who can charm
almost without trying. Looks play a part in that: With his copper skin and high
cheekbones, he has the chiseled appearance of a young Indian brave. Streaks of
blue ribbon running through his black hair lend a touch of the exotic that is
further embellished by the patch of dyed-blond hair above Louie's neckline, and
the rap-fashion cornrows furrowed into his temple.
</P>
<P>
During a recent interview at a Costa Mesa restaurant, Louie was self-assured
without ever seeming arrogant, overbearing, or too full of himself. Most of the
time Louie would lean forward, fixing a listener with brown eyes locked in
concentration. But thornier questions about such issues as the inner motivation
behind is arena-size ambitions would prompt a commentary retreat. Louie would
ease back in the restaurant booth, slumping a little, as if to huddle with
himself. Lifting his right hand to his mouth, gnawing the thumb lightly as he
thought, he seemed to be making an earnest effort to render an honest
accounting for a drive that must by now be so internalized that he never much
considers it.
</P>
<P>
"I guess I need gratification constantly," Louie offered after a long pause.
Stardom "is the most incredible thing that could ever happen to somebody. Ever
since I was a kid, I wanted to be on TV or in the movies. I t attracted me
because if you're famliar to everybody in the world, it seems safer. I have
this thing, I always have to perform. I don't think people know me unless they
see me perform."
</P>
<P>
Louie's introduction to pop stardom came from the radio. When he was a boy, he
would spend Sunday mornings listening to Casey Kasem's weekly "American Top
Forty" show, paying special attention to the informational tidbits about the
performers that Kasem would sprinkle through the program's countdown of hits.
</P>
<P>
"My mom would buy a lot of music magazines, like Hit Parader," Louie recalled.
"They'd be lying around and I'd read lyrics of songs."
</P>
<P>
Louie said the family hopscotched from town to town in Orange and Los Angeles
counties, until he ultimately graduated from El Toro High School. His father,
Louis Cordero, was a businessman who ran liquor stores and markets, then went
into car sales; he and Louie's mother divorced when Louie was in his teens. The
second oldest in a family of four boys and two girls, Louie got a day job as a
car salesman, but his real goal was to be persuasive on the dance floor. "I
always wanted to be a singer, but I didn't think I could . . . (so) I pursued
dancing.
</P>
<P>
"You need confidence. As soon as you get the confidence to sing, you can sing,"
Louie said, offering the first of many maxims about show business that he
readily drops.
</P>
<P>
"Singing was exactly what I wanted to do," Louie said. "So I was scared. It's
like you had the perfect girl, and you shy away from her because you don't want
to get married."
</P>
<P>
But Louie wasn't shy about holding the spotlight on the dance floor of local
nightclubs, where he would perform in baggy '40s-style Zoot suits or '50s
rockabilly regalia. He became a regular competitor in club dance contests,
vying for prizes decided by audience response.
</P>
<P>
"You have to have a point of view, a style," Louie said (another maxim). "I
think I had that before my music did. I developed a character and a stage
presence before I had the music. The contests were part of shaping it. The Red
Onion is harder to perform at than the Forum. The people at the club didn't
come just to see a dance contest. So I learned how to work an audience, connect
with everybody in the room."
</P>
<P>
Louie's dance club successes led to auditions for dance-oriented films being
shot in Los Angeles around the time of the break-dancing craze. At one of those
auditions, he says, he was spotted by a director who was preparing to shoot a
video for a still-emerging singer named Madonna. Louie wound up playing the
leading man's role opposite Madonna in the 1984 "Borderline" video. The song
became the first Top Ten hit of her career.
</P>
<P>
Louie says that for a time he squired Madonna around Los Angeles on dates.
</P>
<P>
"We were just driving down the 10 Freeway and a song came on the radio," he
recalled. "I started singing, and she looked at me in amazement: 'My God, you
can sing too.' " At the time, he said, he had never sung in public.
</P>
<P>
Louie said that Madonna's manager, Freddy DeMann, took an interest in him and
encouraged him to start writing songs.
</P>
<P>
"I had all these big people telling me I had something," he said. "It was like
an awakening. It kept me going.
</P>
<P>
Then came a ruder awakening. "I was going to go on tour dancing with Madonna,
and it didn't work out. That was let-down No. 1. She had hired a choreographer,
which was the right thing for her to do. But (the choreographer wanted) jazz
dancing, not street dancing, and that's not what I'm about."
</P>
<P>
Louie says he lost contact with Madonna as her career took off. But Ron
Weisner, who had been part of her management team, continued to take an
interest in him "because of his persistence."
</P>
<P>
"He was very serious about his career," recalled Weisner, who now manages Paul
McCartney and Steve Winwood. "I told him it's a frustrating business. I told
him at the time, 'You've got to be able to deal with people saying no to you' .
. . (but) he's serious about what he's doing -- and he's a nice guy.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes," Weisner continued, "you see people who have talent, and you put
them together with somebody who might enhance that." Weisner helped Louie hook
up with Giorgio Moroder, the successful disco-era record producer. Louie says
he sang at some 1985 recording sessions produced by Moroder and his studio
assistants. But Louie and Moroder never reached a formal business agreement
that might have led to a record release.
</P>
<P>
That fruitless episode led Louie to his next important patron: his own father.
</P>
<P>
"When I first got into music, he was absolutely not supportive," said Louie,
who quit selling cars after his "Borderline" break. "I kind of was away from my
family for a year. But when he found out Giorgio Moroder was working with me,
that I was serious about it and it was not another whim, my dad gave me money."
</P>
<P>
Louie says his father equipped him with home recording gear and gave him the
use of a house he owned in Santa Ana. Louie began to build a band, which at one
point featured the dancer Cat, who later went on to perform in Prince's band.
His current lineup, which will begin touring this summer, includes
dancer-percussionist Sam Masarani, singer B.J. Smith, percussionist Gino G.,
drummer Herb Graham and bassist Tony Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
The next stop on Louie's climb was the La Habra recording studio of Jon St.
James, whose work with Stacey Q and Bardeux had made him Orange County's most
commercial successful record producer.
</P>
<P>
St. James, who began working with Louie in 1987, found him to be a natural
performer, willing to communicate his musical ideas in the most elemental way:
by just getting up and singing them.
</P>
<P>
"Louie's very flamboyant, and if you give him a chance to shine, he'll take
over," St. James said. "He'd walk in and start singing a cappella at the top of
his lungs. He'd come into the studio and say, 'Jon, you've got to hear this,'
and he'd start singing and dancing around."
</P>
<P>
That lack of inhibition carried over into Louie's stage act, recalled Romi
Marie, St. James' assistant at the time. The consensus around St. James'
Formula One Studio was that Louie's outrageous shows weren't helping him.
</P>
<P>
"In all honesty, a lot of people (in the music business) didn't take Louie
seriously," said Marie, who first brought the singer to St. James' attention.
"His type of dancing was like exotic dancing, real risque. He had Spandex pants
that were cut up, with holes all over him. A lot of people were saying, 'It's
too Chippendales.' "
</P>
<P>
Louie recorded one single with St. James, "The Girl Who Seduced the World." The
song, written by St. James and released on the Synthecide/Enigma label, was
roundly ignored.
</P>
<P>
"When he wanted to do a second record (Enigma) wasn't committed to it," St.
James recalled. "They said, 'Wait and see.' Louie got an attorney and got out
of the (recording) deal. I don't blame him for it. He's very impatient. He
wants to be a star overnight. I think anybody who has that quality wants to be.
That's how they get there. I envisioned him as another Prince."
</P>
<P>
"I felt constantly let down," Louie said of his string of early disappointments
with Madonna, Moroder and St. James. "I always blamed it on myself, that I'm
not that good, that I had to get better. But I kind of like to fail. You have
to have a lot of humbling experiences, because then you know where you come
from."
</P>
<P>
Though Louie didn't get a hit out of his tenure under St. James, he did acquire
a manager, Kelly Newby. Louie's script for stardom required somebody cast in
the Freddy DeMann patron role, and Newby filled it.
</P>
<P>
"I was looking again for somebody to say the (encouraging) things that Freddy
said, "Louie recalled. "You need people to believe almost more than you do to
get to the next level." By late 1988, Newby's contacts as a former film and
television agent had moved Louie to the level he wanted: a major label
recording contract.
</P>
<P>
Colomby, a friend of Newby's, saw Louie and his band play in Los Angeles and
agreed to work with him as musical adviser (Louie refers to Colomby -- who
previously had coached Richard Marx, among others -- as "like a navigator").
</P>
<P>
When pop singer Martika, a former television client of Newby's, saw Louie she
became so enthused that she called Tommy Mottola, president of CBS Records.
Mottola, based in New York, asked WTG's Greenberg to take a look. Greenberg,
seeking acts for the newly formed subsidiary label, liked what he saw.
</P>
<P>
Louie, meanwhile, was beginning to realize that the more extreme moves that had
won him acclaim in the Los Angeles and Orange County dance clubs might not go
over as well with the mass audience he wanted to reach.
</P>
<P>
"I toned it down," he said. "I took a lot of the sex out of the show because
people were coming for that instead of the songs. As the songs got better, I
wanted to concentrate on the songs."
</P>
<P>
Despite his dance floor beginnings, Louie wanted his songs to do more than
recycle the usual dance cliches.
</P>
<P>
"Anybody can write a song about that, about pushing to the groove, or moving to
the beat," Louie said.
</P>
<P>
"I think songs about sex and dancing (aren't enough). There should be a lesson
in every song. I think my album is like an emotional roller coaster. It takes
you up and down, and around."
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the album has its share of sex songs, but Louie typically manages
to weave a narrative situation around his romantic-encounter material. "Sittin'
in the Lap of Luxury," for example, embellishes the story of a young gigolo
with a bit of psychological underpinning for the character's life of luxurious
sin. Louie also gives the song a happily redemptive, true-romance ending. It
isn't exactly Bob Dylan, but compared to such dance-pop competitors as Paula
Abdul and Milli Vanilli, Louie's method seems adventurous and complex.
</P>
<P>
The album's best song, "The State I'm In," moves from nervous urgency to
gospel-tinged celebration as Louie sings about the pressures he encounters in
the outside world, and his own determination to find an inner balance that will
let him rise above it. The song is a catchy, propulsive rallying cry for
positive change.
</P>
<P>
Jerry Greenberg figured that Louie's debut held enough promise to merit some
unusual promotional attention. The veteran music executve, formerly with
Atlantic Records, left his label president's desk and shepherded Louie around
the Northeast on a recent pre-release jaunt aimed at winning over radio
programmers, journalists and buyers for record store chains.
</P>
<P>
Greenberg said the last performer he had personally introduced in that way was
Jason Bonham, son of the late drummer for Led Zeppelin, a band Greenberg had
worked with in his Atlantic days.
</P>
<P>
"We don't do it for every artist, but every once in a while there's somebody
special like Louie Louie," Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
What all this means is that highly placed people in the music business are
seeing Louie in the same light in which he has always seen himself.
</P>
<P>
"Forum-level concert shows," Louie replied when asked the extent of his
ambitions. "It's so big that it doesn't have any boundaries."
</P>
<P>
Amid the release of more than 100,000 copies of his just-released album, "The
State I'm In,"

<TEXT>
   If there's one thing Julie Wilson has learned
during her long career singing in nightclubs and high-tone places
like the Plaza and the St. Regis and the Algonquin, it's never count
on anything.
   ``I'm a total fatalist,'' says the sophisticated song stylist
known for her impeccable way with lyrics. ``I feel if it's going to
happen, it's going to happen. If it's not, it's not.''
   So when Peter Allen told her nearly five years ago that he would
write a role for her in his first Broadway musical, she didn't tell
anyone.
   ``Not a soul,'' Miss Wilson says. ``You know when you want
something so much, it's like the kiss of death if you talk about it.
I didn't open my trap.''
   Her silence _ and waiting _ paid off.
   Miss Wilson now is appearing with Allen at the Mark Hellinger
Theater in ``Legs Diamond,'' a new musical about the 1920s New York
gangster. Allen, who wrote the show's music and lyrics, also plays
the famous outlaw. Miss Wilson is Flo, a woman who fronts a
nightclub secretly owned by Diamond.
   ``They needed a woman of my age and experience to play this role,
someone who's been around the block _ more than once,'' she laughs.
``I'm the older woman in this show. Believe me, I am the oldie. I
like to say `oldie but goodie.'''
   For Miss Wilson, ``Legs Diamond'' is her first Broadway musical
in nearly two decades. Broadway has only been a part of her show
business career, which began at the age of 17 back in Omaha when she
was chosen Miss Nebraska. Since then, there have been touring shows,
radio, television, recordings, summer stock and stints in London
where she appeared in West End editions of ``Kiss Me Kate,'' ``South
Pacific'' and ``Bells Are Ringing.''
   But her bread and butter has been nightclubs. Usually wearing a
slinky gown and a gardenia perched behind her ear, Miss Wilson has
sung the best songs of Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Rodgers and
Hart, Kurt Weill, Stephen Sondheim and other Broadway writers.
   Allen's material has been a more recent addition. She met him for
the first time in the 1970s, but he knew about her long before that.
   ``When he was a kid, dancing in Australia, somebody sent him an
old record of mine called `Julie Wilson at the St. Regis,''' she
says.
   Those days in the early 1970s were lean years for Miss Wilson in
New York. Suddenly there was no place to sing. Big clubs were
closing all over town.
   ``I was fighting for my life,'' she recalls. ``I grabbed whatever
came my way. Things like small roles in plays like `Norman, Is That
You?' in Paramus, N.J.''
   At the time, Miss Wilson and Allen shared the same voice teacher
_ Keith Davis. They still do.
   ``I became very aware of Peter because my teacher was always
talking about him and because he had the big hit song, `I Honestly
Love You,''' the singer recalls.
   Whenever she got a job, there would be flowers and a note from
Allen. Sometimes, he and a group of friends would show up to cheer
her on. She attended a lot of his concerts, too, and they became
good friends.
   Then, in 1976, she left New York, returning to Omaha for an
eight-year sabbatical to take care of her ailing parents and raise
her two sons. When she came back in 1984 to resume her career, Allen
showed up at Michael's Pub, an East Side nightclub, to hear her
sing. It was then that he told her about ``Legs Diamond'' and his
plans for her.
   Nothing happened.
   A year later, she was at her voice teacher's studio and ran into
Allen again. ``Would you like to hear your song?'' he asked.
   Allen sat down at the piano and played ``The Music Went Out of My
Life,'' the song Miss Wilson sings in ``Legs Diamond.''
   ``It's a little soliloquy,'' she says. ``It's a woman singing
about her loves, what happened and why they didn't work out.''
   Then another year went by, and Miss Wilson was asked to perform
with Allen in a workshop production of ``Legs.'' The workshop was
done in March 1987. The show's producers decided the book by Charles
Suppon needed work.
   Harvey Fierstein, author of ``Torch Song Trilogy,'' was brought
in to help, to sharpen some of the characters and make the story
brighter.
   Then the show was finally announced to open on Broadway in the
fall of 1988.
   But before ``Legs Diamond'' went into rehearsal, Miss Wilson
found out she was under consideration to replace Dolores Gray and
sing the show-stopping ``I'm Still Here'' in the London production
of ``Follies.'' She told her agent ``no.'' Her heart belonged to
Allen.
   ``I don't want anything else,'' Miss Wilson told her agent. ``I
just want to hang out, do my club thing and hope that the show will
go.''
   She doesn't regret her decision.
   ``I'm on the boards until they get rid of me,'' she says. ``I
knew I had to chance it.''

LUCRATIVE LULLABIES;
</P>
<P>
DISCOVERY MUSIC WAKING UP MARKET FOR NEWBORN LISTENERS AND THEIR PARENTS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
In the "thirtysomething" era of aerobics videos for kids, fetal phones to talk
to the not-yet-born and gourmet baby food, it seems inevitable that someone
would produce music for infants.
</P>
<P>
Fivesomething years ago, record industry veteran Ellen Wohlstadter, 35, was
searching for music to play for her newborn son, Jason. Finding nothing she
liked, she and her husband, David, 36, produced their own cassette with a
variety of traditional lullabies such as "Rock-A-Bye-Baby," with ballads they
grew up listening to written by the Beatles and other artists. Selling for
nearly $10, primarily in baby furniture stores, the cassette was a hit.
</P>
<P>
So with about $30,000, the couple started their own firm, called Discovery
Music, a specialty music company that is becoming to infant music what the
K-Tel label is to oldies and Windham Hill is to New Age music.
</P>
<P>
From their comfortable, white-fenced home in Sherman Oaks, the Wohlstadters
have released five cassettes of music for infants since starting their company
in October, 1985. They include two anthologies of lullabies, one tape of songs
with morning themes such as "O, What a Beautiful Morning," a cassette of silly
songs and another tape of travel songs such as "Side by Side" to play in a car.
Planned for release this year is a bathing cassette featuring "Splish Splash"
and other songs.
</P>
<P>
Discovery Music is still in the infant stage itself -- the Wohlstadters have
only five employees -- but the couple closely guard their sales figures, citing
competitive reasons. The Wohlstadters say that sales jumped 85% in 1988 and
that they sell tapes in about 5,000 stores. Music industry executives say the
market for music aimed at children under age 3 probably has grown from
virtually nothing five years ago to $5 million to $10 million today. Some
believe that Discovery may have as much as half of that market.
</P>
<P>
As silly as it may seem to some, music for infants has become one of the
hottest areas of children's music, which overall is a nearly
$200-million-a-year business. Nashville music producer J. Aaron Brown, who
sells a Grammy-nominated recording of original lullabies written by his
in-house songwriters, said he sold 300,000 cassettes last year. Most were sold
in gift shops, he said, which sell the tapes for $12.95.
</P>
<P>
The business is starting to attract big-name companies, posing a threat to tiny
Discovery. Walt Disney Records in Burbank earlier this year released "Disney's
Lullaby Favorites," which includes a folk version of "When You Wish Upon a
Star" sung by rocker Stephen Bishop, whose hits include "On and On" and "It
Might Be You."
</P>
<P>
Ellen Wohlstadter said she is nervous that large companies such as Disney are
entering the market. "People say competition is good, but they have a lot of
money behind them. They can do a lot of advertising and other things we can't
do at this point," she said.
</P>
<P>
Other major record labels are also considering whether to produce lullaby
tapes.
</P>
<P>
"We think it's a very fertile market," said Mark Jaffe, director of childrens
marketing for A &amp; M Records. Jaffe said A &amp; M has yet to release a
lullaby tape, mainly because it is searching for a singer the label believes
can be marketed well.

Much of the lullaby cassettes' success comes because the tapes aren't sold so
much for infants, who most likely are indifferent to the music they hear, as
they are marketed to parents in their late 20s and 30s to listen to while
trying to soothe crying babies or put them to bed.
</P>
<P>
That explains why one Discovery lullaby tape includes a cover version of Elvis
Presley's 1950s hit "Love Me Tender" on the same cassette with the traditional
"German Lullaby."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nightly Music
</P>
<P>
Still, some parents believe that their babies enjoy the music. Rosine
Hermodson-Olsen, a mother in Frederick, S.D., said she is a strong believer in
playing music for infants and went so far as to play music for her 7-month-old
son, Joseph, while he was still in the womb. She said she plays Discovery tapes
for him almost every night.
</P>
<P>
"I play it if he's a little antsy or if his teeth hurt. I think it relaxes
him," she said.
</P>
<P>
Pediatricians interviewed said they see no harm in playing music for infants,
adding that it is unlikely that children will develop Pavlov-type conditioning
in which they must hear music to fall asleep. Pediatricians said their main
concern is that some parents might be tempted to use music too often as a
convenient baby-sitter, depriving the child of important human contact.
</P>
<P>
"Music is all right, but it doesn't replace people," said Dr. T. Berry
Brazelton, a clinical professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and one
of the nation's leading child-care experts.
</P>
<P>
Part of the Discovery sales pitch is that music helps babies, although limited
research has been done. One Discovery package says, "Research has proven
parents who lullaby their babies promote bonding, infant development and
speech."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Question of Research
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Esther Wender, a pediatrician at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center
who heads the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on early childhood, said
she is unaware of any such research on the effect of lullabies.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of anybody who has studied it," said Wender, who added that she
doesn't believe that listening to music would hurt a baby.
</P>
<P>
Ellen Wohlstadter said she informally gathered research on the subject. One
Swedish study she said she found concluded that it was important to sing to a
baby, even if it is off-key. A news article, she said, told of a Japanese study
that showed that babies were soothed more by lullabies than rock 'n' roll.
Despite the statements on the packages, she said, Discovery does not emphasize
psychological benefits of the music in selling it. "We promote it more as
entertainment," she said.
</P>
<P>
Discovery is based in the downstairs part of the couple's spacious home in the
foothills. One room is an office, where orders are taken, publicity is planned
and accounting work is done. The Wohlstadters, who share the title of
president, also share an office in what used to be their bedroom, which has the
guts of a new $40,000 computer in the closet. Discovery's shipping department
is in a guest house in the back yard.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TV Sports Producer
</P>
<P>
Ellen Wohlstadter formerly worked in production and distribution for RSO
Records, the New York record label owned by Australian Robert Stigwood that
scored one of the industry's biggest hits in the late 1970s with the "Saturday
Night Fever" movie sound track. David Wohlstadter is a television sports
producer who does free-lance work on weekends for the ESPN sports channel.
</P>
<P>
To produce a cassette, the Wohlstadters select a theme, such as travel or
lullabies, and listen to hundreds of songs. A royalty of 5.25% is paid to the
songs' owners. They also make frequent use of traditional songs in the public
domain, which don't require royalties.
</P>
<P>
Once songs are selected, singer Joanie Bartels, who was selected from a group
of singers who auditioned for the job, records the songs, with cassettes
duplicated at a plant owned by Warner Communications. Instrumental versions are
usually recorded on the flip side of each cassette, with lyrics enclosed so
parents can sing their own version of the songs.
</P>
<P>
Selecting songs can be a sensitive job. One parent wrote to criticize the use
of the traditional "Rock-A-Bye-Baby" because, the parent said, the song is
excessively violent. The reason was that the song contains the lines: "When the
bough breaks, the cradle will fall, and down will come baby, cradle and all."
</P>
<P>
Another angry parent called Discovery at 9 p.m. a few weeks ago to complain
about a 1986 tape that used a version of the Cat Stevens hit "Morning Has
Broken." The call came after the former pop singer, who has changed his name to
Yusuf Islam and become a strict Muslim, endorsed the Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's death threat against Salman Rushdie, author of "The Satanic Verses."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rejecting Tunes
</P>
<P>
A large number of songs ultimately are rejected. For Discovery's latest tape on
silly songs, a popular children's song called "Animal Fair" was nixed after it
was recorded. The Wohlstadters were reluctant to issue the song because it
refers to a monkey who gets drunk, sits on an elephant's trunk and ends up
flattened. But, they said, most songs are rejected because they have some kind
of romantic lyrics that parents might find objectionable.
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for Discovery's growth isn't so much the music as the
Wohlstadters' decision to initially sell the cassettes through distributors to
children's furniture stores and later to toy stores, children's book stores,
children's clothing stores and department stores. The cassettes are usually
hung on a stand that is placed on a store's front counter.
</P>
<P>
Had they tried to sell the tapes to record stores, they said, the cassettes
most likely would have been lost among popular adult albums more actively
pushed by the record stores. Baby furniture stores made more sense.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New-Mother Market
</P>
<P>
"That's where the mother goes when she is pregnant. The new mother is the
market we wanted to get, and the new mother does not go into record stores,"
Ellen Wohlstadter said.
</P>
<P>
Discovery Music is starting to feel growing pains. The Wohlstadters expect to
have to move to proper offices next year. In addition, an $80,000 advertising
campaign, their first, is being launched in magazines for new parents. And they
are considering whether to expand into such areas as compact discs and
videocassettes.
</P>
<P>
Still, she and others in the business believe that baby tapes won't be a
thirtysomething-type fad.
</P>
<P>
"People used to sing a lot to their children. People don't have the time today
and often don't know the lyrics. You can say it's a fad, but if it was, people
wouldn't be buying it as much as they are," she said.

success demand that they work like crazy.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  THE ODDS OF OPERA STARDOM? 10,000 TO 1, APPROXIMATELY
WITH A SONG IN THEIR HEART  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Classical Music  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "Some companies will listen to 70 to 80 singers in a day," says upwardly
mobile baritone Eli Villanueva, 30, whose younger brother LeRoy has already
sung numerous San Francisco Opera roles. "The Central City Opera recently had
1,200 applicants. They listened to 400 of them to cast exactly 31 roles for
the summer season in Colorado.";    Villanueva was part of a baker's dozen of
such California aspirants -- a highly impressive group of pros in the 22-32
age range -- who were invited here this past weekend as Opera San Jose held
tryouts for next season.;    By operatic standards, they were still young. At
an age when pro football players hang up their helmets for good, opera singers
are just getting to maturity.;    A 'crazy idea' bears fruit;  The unique OSJ
concept tied in auditions with an intensive three-day training session that
scarcely left time for the exhilarated singers to breathe.;    What OSJ's
Irene Dalis called "this crazy idea of mine I've been trying to bring off for
years" is sure to be repeated if the weekend's success is any indication.
Finding the new contract singers-in-residence for all next season, she
reasoned, can't be based on the usual audition tape and live two-minute aria
rendition.;    To be picked takes training, practice, and more training.;
"What outside life?" That was the question posed by soprano Julie Kierstine,
30, about a singer's leisure time. "It's no different from the marathon
training. You can't get sick; you have to stay in shape all the time.";    You
need funding as well. Coaching sessions indispensable for learning roles cost
$30-$50 per hour, and in New York City the tab is around $100 per hour.;
You also have to study roles, be ready for any audition anywhere. The
Villanuevas of today have to stand and deliver in five languages, including
Russian. Kierstine herself spent a year-and-a-half polishing and honing an
aria from Stravinsky's "The Rake's Progress" for the OSJ's private "Showcase
'91," closing out the proceedings at the Rehearsal Hall Sunday night.;    The
backgrounds of the showcased singers vary. Lyric baritone Earl Patriarco is of
Philippine descent. Tenor Jose Medina, 27, from Tijuana, Mexico, and more
recently San Diego, has performed in zarzuelas, or Spanish musicals. San
Francisco soprano Marlynn Smith, 30, has sung spirituals. And baritone Darin
Adams, 22, of Menlo Park has logged a lot of church-choir work.;    "Four of
the 12 here auditioning were people of color," remarked OSJ Development
Director Elliot Klein to a comment that OSJ had hired very, very few non-white
singers over the years.;    The weekend offered master classes, coaching
sessions, language study, recitatives -- just about everything short of
death-scene lessons.;    The reaction to the training? "Fabulous," says
soprano Smith.;    But why sing an ancient foreign-focused art like opera at
all, especially since it's much easier for vocalists to find other less taxing
jobs?;    "Mental illness helps," is the tongue-in-cheek response from tenor
Ravil Atlas of San Jose, who recently sang the lead in the San Francisco "Les
Miserables.";    "Opera is theater," says Patriarco. "But it's also the
highest form of vocal music that there is.";    A life in the opera;  "Opera
is in a class by itself," says mezzo Sarah Blaze. It has the highest
requirements of all, she adds. "Much more so than musicals. And the music --
it doesn't compare!";    Opera also takes panache, like that of soprano
Patricia McAfee. When it came time for her grand finale, she deliberately
selected the aria "O don fatale," the same work that OSJ Director Irene Dalis
had sung in her operatic debut abroad more than three decades ago. Much to her
relief, Dalis lighted up with enthusiasm after McAfee's rendition.;    The
operatic life is full of misconceptions. Some singers were asked about their
pet fallacies about their art. Some favorites:;    (box) "You've gotta be fat
if you're an opera singer." (Baritone Matthew Carey).;    (box) "You must be
earning a lot of money." (McAfee);    (box) "A kid came up to me after I sang
an opera and asked, 'Where are your horns?' (Villanueva, about a fan expecting
Brunnhildes everywhere.)  </TEXT>

   The disgraced pop music duo Milli Vanilli
surrendered their best new artist Grammy Award on Tuesday and
claimed their phony act as lipsyncing front men was a ``pact with
the devil'' that victimized them.
   Rob Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan, whose stardom was shattered last
week with the revelation that they never sang on the debut Milli
Vanilli album, said they were seduced into the deceit because they
were poor, young and naive.
   ``You get something, but for that you make a pact with the
devil,'' Pilatus said at a news conference.
   ``We feel really, really sorry about our fans,'' he said. ``We
really love our fans ... We just hope that they understand that we
were young, that we just wanted to live the life the American
way.''
   The pair and manager Carsten Heyn charged that Arista Records
President Clive Davis knew they were faking. Arista has repeatedly
denied the claim. Heyn also said recording industry officials
worldwide knew of the deception.
   The pair presented a videotape of themselves recording the hit
song ``Girl You Know It's True'' in a studio last weekend, but that
was greeted with skepticism and yells from reporters to prove they
really could sing.
   Pilatus belted out a few lines from the song and Morvan joined
in with the rap portion of the tune.
   Trustees of the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences
voted Monday to rescind Milli Vanilli's Grammy. The pair held up
their trophies Tuesday and declared they were returning them with
recommendation they go to the real singers.
   Academy president Michael Greene said giving the trophies to the
singers who actually sang was ``not a possibility.''
   Voice coach Seth Riggs, who said his clients include Michael
Jackson, Madonna and Stevie Wonder, gave a testimonial to the duo's
singing abilities, saying they were better than the men who
actually were recorded.
   Pilatus claimed he and Morvan were victimized because they were
living in poverty in a Munich housing project when German producer
Frank Farian offered them the deal. He said that at the time they
even had to steal food.
   Pilatus, who was born in New York and raised in Germany,
described in broken English a growing sense of guilt that came
along with stardom and money.
   ``There was everytime something that we had to lie,'' he said.
``We had very guilty complexes.''
   The album ``Girl You Know It's True'' sold 7 million copies
worldwide and made the two unknowns international stars. Pilatus
and Morvan, a native of the Caribbean island of Guadaloupe, are
both 25.
   Farian last week confirmed growing rumors that the duo did not
sing on the album. It actually featured the voices of vocalists
Johnny Davis, Brad Howell and Charles Shaw. Pilatus said Shaw's
role was minimal and the Grammy really belongs to Davis and Howell.
   The pair also lipsynced through an appearance on February's
Grammy show in Los Angeles when Milli Vanilli was honored as best
new artist of 1989.
   Singing coach Riggs said he was there and that Pilatus and
Morvan were ready to sing but were told to fake it. He did not know
who gave the order. The duo also did not say who it was.
   The duo's attorney, Alan Mintz, supported their claim that they
had pressed the producer to be allowed to actually sing and that
the producer only came forward with the truth because Pilatus and
Morvan were about to.
   Meanwhile, an Oakland woman who bought her son a Milli Vanilli
tape filed a class action lawsuit in state court Monday seeking a
refund for anyone in California who bought the group's recordings
or attended one of their concerts.
   In Illinois, Chicago college student Karen L. Smith on Tuesday
also sued in Cook County Circuit Court, claiming fraud because the
CDs she bought named Pilatus and Morvan as performers.

<TEXT>     2. Anna homma-duh homma-du-du-du hommaaaaaaaaa.;    3.
Dee-uh-dee-hah-hah-hah buh-huheee-buh-huhe-eee-eee-eee-ray-have.;    You say
you don't recognize it? Nonsense. Of course you do. It's likely that you've
heard and sung it dozens or hundreds of times, depending on your age. Your
parents sang it. And probably your grandparents too.;    You still don't know
it? I'll throw out a few hints.;    It's a very old song. The words were
written more than 150 years ago. The melody is even older than that. You still
don't know? Then you don't go to many Opening Days at baseball games.;    Of
course, when Francis Scott Key wrote that line, as well as the others that
precede and follow it, he kept the lyrics much simpler: "O'er the land of the
free and the home of the brave." And for many years, that's the way it was
sung.;    But it's no longer done that way. There has developed an informal
competition among singers at ballparks, hockey rinks, basketball stadiums and
other patriotic gathering places to see who can best turn "The Star-Spangled
Banner" into something resembling the howls of a maniac.;    I'm not sure when
these free-form interpretations began, although I vaguely remember some guy
named Jose creating a stir a few years ago by opening a World Series with a
rendition that sounded like the Star-Spangled Cha-Cha-Cha.;    Since then, I
have heard the anthem has been performed as the Star-Spangled Rock, the
Star-Spangled Disco, the Star-Spangled Gospel, the Star-Spangled Blues, the
Star-Spangled Hootenanny and the Star-Spangled Barbershop Quartet.;    A few
weeks ago, a woman who sang it before a Chicago Bulls game is believed to have
set a record by using a variety of prolonged howls, shrieks, warbles, screams
and other vocal acrobatics to drag it out to more than five minutes.;    A man
who was there told me: "I couldn't understand one word. And, I swear, if I
were a Chicago policeman and I heard those sounds coming from a building, I
would radio for backup, then draw my gun and go crashing into the place on the
assumption that a woman was being brutally attacked by a gang of fiends.";
I think it is time to draw the line. After all, it is our national anthem. As
such, it should be performed with some dignity, rather than sounding as if the
singer has been bitten in the rear by a pit bull.;    It's doubtful that
anyone would stand in center court at Wimbledon and sing: "Ga-hah
Say-hey-he-hey-iv ow-ow-owah guh-ray-hey-hey-hey-hey shush
Qwa-hey-qua-hey-heee-eeeen." (That's "God save our gracious queen," ballpark
style).;    And think of the children. Generation after generation of parents
bring their children to ballparks to introduce them to the national pastime.
Do we want these children later standing up in the assembly hall and saying:
"No, teacher, it starts like this: 'Oh-hoh-hey cah-han-you-see-uh-see-uh
by-the daw-haw-hawns err-uh-err-ee-uh-lee-lah-lite?"';    That isn't what
Francis Scott Key had in mind.;    On the other hand, some musicologists say
that the melody can be traced back to England where it had different lyrics
and was a drinking song. So maybe it's not totally inappropriate for today's
singers to sound as if they just downed a quart of Southern Comfort.  </TEXT>

Call her 1990's Tracy Chapman . . . this decade's Chrissie Hynde . . . or even
a new generation's Patti Smith.
</P>
<P>
Too much praise for a 23-year-old Irish singer-songwriter with just two albums
to her credit?
</P>
<P>
Not if you've heard Sinead O'Connor's seductively tender version of Prince's
"Nothing Compares 2 U" or her hauntingly personal "I Do Not Want What I Haven't
Got" album -- or if you saw her concert Tuesday at San Diego State University's
Open Air Theatre.
</P>
<P>
In the unending parade of pop faces and styles, O'Connor offers traces on
record and on stage of being a trailblazer -- someone like Chapman, Hynde and
Smith -- who not only entertains and inspires but also lifts our expectations
of pop music.
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's songs of personal exorcism and spiritual transformation are so
intimate and unguarded that you feel at times you're eavesdropping in a
confessional -- or overhearing a stormy scene in a bedroom, or in one song
witnessing the final, bitter goodbys of a couple in an attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
O'Connor -- who continues her U.S. tour with sold-out shows Thursday and Friday
at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles -- writes about betrayal and misjudgments
with anger and fury but she emerges from it all with a sense of optimism and
faith.
</P>
<P>
Coupled with the introspective, philosophical nature of her music, this
head-spinning success could tempt O'Connor into presenting herself as some sort
of precious angel -- an image she called to mind (no doubt inadvertently) when
she walked on stage at one stop on her recent European tour in a hooded robe.
</P>
<P>
By looking like a member of some exotic monastic order, O'Connor focused
attention during that concert on the spiritual undercurrents in the album.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, however, O'Connor wore a leather jacket, jeans and cowboy boots,
emphasizing the frisky, down-to-earth side of her personality and music.
</P>
<P>
When O'Connor, an outspoken fan of rap music, took off the jacket, the
lettering on her T-shirt spotlighted the playfulness even more. In a tip of the
hat to the controversial Los Angeles rap group N.W.A, the front of the shirt
read "P.W.A." -- for, as the lettering on the back explained, "Paddies With
Attitude."
</P>
<P>
As the concert proceeded, O'Connor moved from the cathedral-like tone of the
opening number through the rock 'n' roll sass of "The Emperor's New Clothes," a
tale of confrontation, to the sensual heat of "I Want Your (Hands On Me)."
</P>
<P>
Her greatest talent at this early point in her career is her singing, which
moves between a whisper and a scream with the suddenness and authority of a
stunt-car driver swerving to avoid an accident.
</P>
<P>
But her most prized attribute may be her ability to infuse music with the most
profoundly personal feelings, yet leave enough room for the audience to find
their own emotional connection.
</P>
<P>
A full review runs in Thursday's Calendar section.

Too much praise for a 23-year-old Irish singer-songwriter with just two albums
to her credit?
</P>
<P>
Not if you've heard Sinead O'Connor's seductively tender version of Prince's
"Nothing Compares 2 U" or her hauntingly personal "I Do Not Want What I Haven't
Got" album -- or if you saw her concert on Tuesday at San Diego State
University's Open Air Theatre.
</P>
<P>
In the unending parade of pop faces and styles, O'Connor offers traces on
record and on stage of being a trailblazer -- someone like Chapman, Hynde and
Smith who not only entertains and inspires, but also lifts our expectations of
pop music.
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's songs of personal exorcism and spiritual transformation are so
intimate and unguarded that you feel at times you're eavesdropping in a
confessional -- or overhearing a stormy scene in a bedroom, or in one song
witnessing the final, bitter goodbys of a couple in an attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
O'Connor -- who continues her U.S. tour with sold-out shows tonight and Friday
at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles -- writes about betrayal and misjudgments
with anger and fury, but she emerges from it all with a sense of optimism and
faith.
</P>
<P>
"God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to
change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference," she whispered
into the microphone at the start of Tuesday's concert, duplicating the familiar
"Serenity Prayer" that opens her album.
</P>
<P>
With just a trace of a spotlight on her, O'Connor stared into the darkness of
the audience after delivering that prayer and sang "Feel So Different," a song
about the changes in her own life.
</P>
<P>
Sample lines:
</P>
<P>
 The whole time I'd never seen
</P>
<P>
 All you had spread before me
</P>
<P>
 The whole time I'd never seen
</P>
<P>
 That all I'd need was inside me.
</P>
<P>
 Who would have imagined in the Me Decade of the '80s that the "first pop
superstar of the '90s" -- as Rolling Stone magazine describes O'Connor -- would
be someone proclaiming that you don't need what you haven't got.
</P>
<P>
Coupled with the introspective, philosophical nature of her music, this
head-spinning success could tempt O'Connor into presenting herself as some sort
of precious angel -- an image she called to mind (no doubt inadvertently) when
she walked on stage at one stop on her recent European tour in a hooded robe.
</P>
<P>
By looking like a member of some exotic monastic order, O'Connor focused
attention during that concert on the spiritual undercurrents in the album.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, however, O'Connor wore a leather jacket, jeans and cowboy boots,
emphasizing the frisky, down-to-earth side of her personality and music.
</P>
<P>
When O'Connor, an outspoken fan of rap music, took off the jacket, the
lettering on her T-shirt spotlighted the playfulness even more. In a tip of the
hat to the controversial Los Angeles rap group N.W.A, the front of the shirt
read "P.W.A." -- for, as the lettering on the back explained, "Paddies With
Attitude."
</P>
<P>
As the concert (which was opened by low-key English soul singer Hugh Harris)
proceeded, O'Connor moved from the cathedral-like tone of the opening number
through the rock 'n' roll sass of "The Emperor's New Clothes," a tale of
confrontation, to the sensual heat of "I Want Your (Hands On Me)."
</P>
<P>
The thin, doleful-eyed Irishwoman underscored the latter expression of desire
by caressing her body with as much eyebrow-raising abandon as anything Madonna
exhibited in the bedroom fantasies in her "Blond Ambition" show. Where the
Madonna caresses seemed choreographed, O'Connor's were more startling -- and
sexy -- because they appeared to be spontaneous: a lightning flash of naked
emotion.
</P>
<P>
It's precisely that quality that makes O'Connor so compelling. Like her shaved
head, there is something strikingly unadorned about everything she does on
stage -- from the naturalness of her mostly understated manner to the way she
uses her four-piece band. Instead of finding a place for them in every song,
O'Connor was sometimes alone on stage, and sometimes was joined by just one
other musician.
</P>
<P>
Her greatest talent at this early point in her career is her singing, which
moves between a whisper and a scream with the suddenness and authority of a
stunt-car driver swerving to avoid an accident.
</P>
<P>
But her most prized attribute may be her ability to infuse music with the most
profoundly personal feelings, yet leave enough room for the audience to find
its own emotional connection.
</P>
<P>
She also demonstrates, in "Black Boys on Mopeds," an ability to move beyond her
introspective feelings to reflect on social injustice. Sample lines:
</P>
<P>
England's not the mythical land of Madame George and roses
</P>
<P>
 It's the home of police who kill black boys on mopeds.
</P>
<P>
 And I love my boy and that's why I'm leaving
</P>
<P>
 I don't want him to be aware that there's
</P>
<P>
 Any such thing as grieving.
</P>
<P>
 It's a mother speaking intuitively in the line about leaving England, not a
literal declaration. O'Connor, who is married and has a young son, hasn't left
London in protest because she knows there is injustice everywhere.
</P>
<P>
But she left in the line in the song because it reflected her immediate
impulse, and it's that uncensored freedom of poetic expression that connects
O'Connor with the great artists in pop. This young talent has a long way to go
to prove she is an artist for the ages, but her beginning is as inspiring as
any in years.

In an interview before their appearance this past August at the Hollywood Bowl,
83-year-old saxophonist Benny Carter talked about the first time he saw Ella
Fitzgerald sing.
</P>
<P>
"It was 1934, and she was doing the amateur show at the Apollo Theatre in New
York," Carter said of the now-legendary night when a 15-year-old Fitzgerald,
worried that her legs were too skinny, made an instant career change. "She was
going to enter a dance contest there and something happened that changed her
mind and she sang instead. And that was the beginning of history."
</P>
<P>
Is that really the way it happened?
</P>
<P>
"Oh yes," Fitzgerald, who appears tonight at the Orange County Performing Arts
Center, said recently in a phone conversation from her home in Beverly Hills.
"I went on stage to dance. I had made a bet with a girlfriend of mine. We had
signed up for the amateur hour, and she told me I would be chicken if I didn't
go out and do it. And of all the times for it to happen, I was the first
amateur they called out.
</P>
<P>
"When I saw all those people, I lost my nerve. And the man said, 'You're out
here, you have to do something.' So I tried to do a song that my mother was
madly in love with that was sung by Miss Conee Boswell -- she played that
record all the time. So I started to sing and won first prize. But there was no
way in the world that I was going out there to dance."
</P>
<P>
The saxophonist was so impressed with the singer's Apollo Theatre performance
that he took her to meet bandleader Fletcher Henderson.
</P>
<P>
"But he didn't want a girl singer at the time," Fitzgerald recalls. "He told
me, 'Don't call me, I'll call you.' "
</P>
<P>
The turndown from Henderson was only a brief pause in the singer's rise to
stardom. Fitzgerald was soon recording with drummer Chick Webb's band, and, by
1937, she won the first of many Down Beat magazine polls, an honor she shared
that year with Bing Crosby.
</P>
<P>
 Carter, who's worked on and off with Fitzgerald in the last 55 years and
appears on her most recent album, "All That Jazz," recorded in 1989, still has
high praise for the singer. "Ella's singing is indescribable," he said. "She's
a creator who uses her instrument just as the guy who blows into his saxophone.
She has such acute hearing that she can hear the changes that are being played
and create accordingly. She's a great talent."
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald credits her mother with developing the aspiring singer's musical
taste. "She listened to records all the time. Conee Boswell was one of her
favorites -- that's how I started to sing "Object of My Affection" and "Judy"
-- and so was Bessie Smith. The Mills Brothers had just become popular, and she
liked them."
</P>
<P>
"I love to sing and I love people and that has been what's got me through," she
says of her success. Fitzgerald's incalculable popularity has come from her
willingness to embrace a number of song styles and not just limit herself to
jazz. She constructed her most recognizable hit, "A-Tisket, A-Tasket," in 1938
from the well-known children's rhyme, with help from arranger Van Alexander.
</P>
<P>
"The first place we played it," she says, "was Boston, Mass., and it was an
overnight sensation, I think because people remembered the game. I never get
tired of performing that one."
</P>
<P>
Her audience widened considerably beginning in 1956 when producer Norman Granz
enlisted the singer to do a number of recordings with music from various
composers. The first of these, "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Song
Book," became an immediate sensation. Collections from Rodgers and Hart, George
and Ira Gershwin, Duke Ellington and Harold Arlen soon followed.
</P>
<P>
"At the time I was with (Granz's) Jazz at the Philharmonic, and he thought a
lot of the jazz clubs were closing and that it was time to do something
different. And the songbook went over so well, we just continued doing that
kind of thing. I'm very grateful to him for that because it was like opening up
a new thing for me, a new beginning. I not only had my jazz fans, I had people
who like the pretty tunes. . . .
</P>
<P>
"In music, it's good to try a little of everything. That way, I feel like what
I'm doing is trying to satisfy the whole audience. There's always somebody who
comes up and says, 'You didn't do my song.' So we try to do a little something
from all the composers. When I don't remember the words, I make up my own."
</P>
<P>
Despite health problems in the last few years -- she had quintuple heart bypass
surgery in 1986, and a severe virus caused her to cancel some of her
engagements this summer -- Fitzgerald maintains the optimism and youthful
outlook that has separated her from singers like Billie Holiday. This outlook
is reflected in her aspiration to do a video that would recall her roots as a
young dancer and singer, one that would embrace her fondness of children. "I'd
love to do that. And I would love to do something that would give inspiration
to the young ones, the little children. I'd like to do some songs like 'Muffin
Man,' 'A-Tisket, A-Tasket' and a couple of things that are popular that the
kids would like and let them dance. And I'd do a little dance."
</P>
<P>
She also wants to study Spanish and do an album in the language someday.
</P>
<P>
"When I go to the market, I sing a couple little songs in Spanish for the kids
there. They like it, so I thought I might like to do an album -- I've done one
in Portuguese. Those are the things that keep you going, when each day you're
learning something. It might sound corny, but that's what I believe."
</P>
<P>
 Ella Fitzgerald sings tonight at 8 at the Orange County Performing Arts
Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $20 to $50. Information:
(714) 556-2787.

   Newcomer Garth Brooks led the finalists
for the 1990 County Music Associatian awards with five nominations
on Thursday. He says it's more than just a dream come true _ he
gets to rent a tuxedo.
   ``This is like getting five invitations to a dance and not
knowing if you'll get to dance or who with,'' Brooks said in
Springfield, Ill., where he was performing.
   Brooks, who's been recording for only a year and was boosted by
his touching song ``If Tomorrow Never Comes,'' outdid established
stars like Randy Travis, Hank Williams Jr. and the group Alabama in
nominations for country music's top awards.
   ``It's an award enough to be touring and fulfilling my dream,
but this is great,'' said the 27-year-old
singer-songwriter-guitarist. ``Plus I get to rent a tux.''
   The association announced its finalists Thursday; the winners
will be announced during a nationally televised show Oct. 8.
   Brooks was nominated for male vocalist of the year, single and
song of the year for ``If Tomorrow Never Comes,'' music video of
the year for ``The Dance'' and the Horizon Award for career
development.
   Brooks, whose songs deal with love and the value of romance and
affectionate communication, has had a quick career rise after just
three years in Nashville.
   ``If Tomorrow Never Comes,'' ``The Dance'' and ``I'm Much Too
Young (to Feel This Damn Old)'' have all been No. 1 country music
records during the past year.
   He briefly ran a boot store here before breaking into the music
business. Prior to arriving in the country music capital, Brooks
was a student at Oklahoma State University, where he was a javelin
thrower for the school track team.
   For the top CMA award, entertainer of the year, the finalists
are Clint Black, Kathy Mattea, Ricky Van Shelton, 1989 winner
George Strait and Travis.
   Travis, who has dominated country music awards for the past five
years, failed to win a nomination as top male vocalist. Those went
to Brooks, Black, Rodney Crowell, 1989 winner Shelton and Strait.
   The finalists for top female vocalist are Patty Loveless, 1989
winner Mattea, Reba McEntire, Lorrie Morgan and Tanya Tucker.
   The finalists and winners are chosen by the 6,000 singers,
musicians, songwriters and others who are CMA members.
   The other finalists for single of the year are ``Here in the
Real World'' by Alan Jackson, ``Killin' Time'' by Black, ``When I
Call Your Name'' by Vince Gill and ``Where've You Been'' by Mattea.
   The finalists for No. 1 album are ``Here in the Real World'' by
Jackson, ``I Wonder Do You Think of Me'' by the late Keith Whitley,
``Livin' It Up'' by Strait, ``Pickin' on Nashville'' by the
Kentucky HeadHunters and ``RVS III'' by Shelton.
   The song of the year finalists, besides Brooks, are ``Here in
the Real World'' by Jackson and Mark Irwin, ``Killin' Time'' by
Black and Hayden Nicholas, ``When I Call Your Name'' by Gill and
Tim DuBois and ``Where've You Been'' by Jon Vezner (Mattea's
husband) and Don Henry. This category is for songwriters.
   For vocal duo of the year, the finalists are Baillie &amp; the Boys,
the Bellamy Brothers, Foster &amp; Lloyd, five-time winners the Judds
and Sweethearts of the Rodeo.
   Country music superstars Alabama, Dolly Parton and Hank Williams
Jr. failed to receive nominations.

<LEADPARA>  IN A RECENT column on the East Bay hills, I mentioned a poignant phrase I'd
sung years ago, "From the hills I gather courage." I thought it was from a
hymn whose title eluded me. Turned out to be a Girl Scout song instead, a
vestige of my youth or my brief career as a Brownie summer camp counselor.;
As several veteran Girl Scouts told me, the song starts with the title line,
"Peace I Ask of Thee, O River." And the river in question -- surprisingly --
is the Kentucky River, not the biblical River Jordan.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  SCOUTING FOR ROOT OF RECALLED SONG  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "Peace" is frequently requested when former Girl Scouts turn nostalgic,
says Marian Gade of Kensington, vice president of the San Francisco Bay Girl
Scout Council and a folk song enthusiast. First published in 1941, it appeared
in such venerable scout songbooks as "The Ditty Bag," as well as in a
California grade school text, "Music for Living Around the World" in 1958.;
The words were written by a woman with the marvelous name of Glendora Gosling.
She and composer Viola Wood were taking a training cruise for Girl Scout
leaders on a river boat on the Kentucky River, explains Barbara Smith at scout
headquarters in New York. When the boat pulled over for a stop, Glendora and
Viola climbed to the top of a hill and -- inspired -- came back with a new
song. And it's made old Girl Scouts misty-eyed ever since -- even when they've
forgotten half the words or what a ditty bag ever was. (Oh, you knew  a ditty
bag was a small cloth bag used by sailors -- or old Girl Scouts -- to carry
personal items of gear.); (hbox);    CAMP FIRE, meanwhile, reminds us that
they are a separate and worthy organization. During February, 200 Camp Fire
youth in the Tri-Cities are selling mints, Almond Roca and almond caramel
clusters outside banks and supermarkets.;    Boys have been in Camp Fire since
the 1970s, leader Susan Blincoe says, "and it's especially frustrating for the
boys to be confused with Girl Scouts when people say, 'I've already bought
cookies.' ";    Another fact of Camp Fire evolution you might not know: Blue
Birds have been phased out in the last couple of years and replaced with the
Starflight program.; (hbox);    NEW-FOUND FUND FOLKS on the block: Shelter
Against Violent Environments' development director, John Ryder, came aboard
last month from the San Francisco Boys and Girls Club. He's already promoting
SAVE's fund-raiser at Francesco's in Oakland on May 15. That would be "Hunks
With a Heart" -- lunch with former Oakland Raiders John Vella, Tom Keating,
Carleton Oates, Dan Medlin, Marv Hubbard, Gary Weaver and George Buehler. For
information, call SAVE at (415) 794-6056. . . . At Serra Center, the
development director is Mim Carlson, formerly with the San Francisco Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Serra's recent first art show by
developmentally disabled adults was so successful that 20 works by Serra
clients are now in a lively exhibit on the third floor of Fremont City Hall
through March 15. Colors and brushwork by artists like Pat McGuire and
Margaret Van Ark show a sure sense of design. Prices are modest and the
framing is better than many gallery shows I've covered.; (hbox);    MOREAU
HIGH SCHOOL in Hayward draws some 400 of its students -- about a third of the
student body -- from the Tri-City area. Janet Avila, a 12-year Moreau parent,
alerts us that the annual President's Ball moves off campus for the first time
March 2. The elegant event will be at the Sequoyah Country Club in Oakland, as
befits the school's 25th anniversary. The John A. Raimondi Volunteer of the
Year award goes to Kip Wixson of Castro Valley. The new Alumni Recognition
Award honors Doug Uchikura of Alamo and Frank Montenegro. The latter is a
27-year-old Fremont teacher who has cared for his five youngest siblings since
his parents died in 1988. For ball tickets at $150 a person, call (415)
582-5831.; (hbox);    GRADUATION is nearly four months away, but four Fremont
high schools already are planning sober all-night grad parties on campus.
Parents and teachers are seeking money, prize donations and volunteer time at
Irvington, Mission San Jose, Kennedy and American high schools. You know the
June graduation accident headlines related to drugs and alcohol. You know the
interviews with grieving classmates. Check with your parent group.  </TEXT>
